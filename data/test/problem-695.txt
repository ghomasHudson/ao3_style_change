Irritation crawled beneath his skin, goading him to say: ‘I’m not a child, in case you haven’t noticed, Mother. I am perfectly capable of doing my shopping
‘I will hear you no matter where you are,’ Harry says fiercely. ‘I’ll come—just like how you came for me.’
Zabini opened his mouth, clearly about to probe further, but Draco pointed out the blackened window. The lights of Hogwarts castle were fireflies dancing in a sea of darkness. ‘I can see Hogwarts. We’d better get our robes on.’
Narcissa stays behind when the rest of them scatter off. ‘I have a few magical items,’ Harry hears her say with great delicacy. ‘I think they can be used to defend the castle.’
Luna was already on the dance floor, trying to force Blaise and Pansy to join her and Hannah in their strange, almost ritualistic dance. Harry laughed at the sight of Blaise’s pinched-face look of horror and Pansy’s embarrassment. There was nobody like Luna Lovegood and Harry fervently thanked Merlin for Luna in his life – even if she was a little
His mother was crying silently – the stars wheeling in the night sky outside captured and placed on her white cheeks – her pale blue eyes wide and bereft. She reached out both arms for him, her hands clawed as if she was unable to straighten them after hours of clenching them in an effort to bear the torture. Her face – her beautiful, soft, beloved face – looked misaligned; something within her had slipped irrevocably.
Sirius’s parents threw him out when he was fourteen and decided he was no longer going to take the omega suppressant potion they forced him to take. He would no longer live in denial, but it was a humiliation for the Black family to have an omega son. It was Harry’s dad’s family who took Sirius in. When the war came, Sirius didn’t show any mercy in fighting against his own family, and when his side won, he delivered those still hiding out in 12 Grimmauld Place to the Aurors himself, including his own father. But his mother escaped, and it was her who sent the assassins after Sirius.
Draco is bored. He sits next to his mother, kicking his foot against the table leg, ignoring her warning looks. They are at Mrs Parkinson’s tea party, sitting at dainty round tables in the middle of perfectly manicured gardens. The ladies are making mind-numbingly dull conversation over tasteless tea and bland cakes. He has eaten at least seven of those little cakes, and watched the dragon shrub cavort around them for the tenth time already.
Eltanin meets Potter's gaze now. The omega is inscrutable, mouth pressed into a flat line, and all Eltanin smells is the storm, the wind scattering loose black leaves. Blood pools in the lines of his palms.
‘A little more curious than your standard Ollivander’s visit,’ Moony says, a hand on Harry’s head. ‘But don’t mind what he said, Harry. You have a good wand, and that’s what matters.’
shy. He reaches out, unable to pull his eyes away from Harry Potter’s unwavering gaze. Time stretches out: eternity long enough for Draco to breathe Harry Potter’s distinctive scent, to feel a pulse that beats like a second heart in time to his, to see that he will now always be pulled inexorably in Harry Potter’s wake.
But she sits in an uncomfortable chair pulled up to his hospital bed, ignoring the buzz of spells and enchanted chains holding him to the bed, and she waits. Her expression is the same patient one she wears when he threw tantrums as a child for not getting his way.
‘We don’t know how he defeated the Dark Lord,’ Father points out. ‘He was only a baby then – imagine what he could be capable now.’
Draco stumbled, utterly shocked by the crippling desire that rippled through him at Potter’s touch. His arm was pressed up against Potter, who had turned his head towards him. They were nearly the same height, Draco being one or two centimetres taller, and Potter was standing so close Draco could feel the touch of Potter’s breath on his lips.
Potter was staring straight at Draco, green eyes piercing. Potter always had a way of looking at Draco as if he had scoured every inch of Draco’s soul and found every aspect of him utterly loathsome. Draco found himself shaking, pushed off-balance by Potter’s sudden appearance.
Draco knows very well his beauty. He is a Veela; beauty is his birth right, as much as his alpha strength and allure. But since the man who tried to assault him when he was eight, Draco is repulsed by any sort of attention given to his looks. He supposes it has something to do with sex, or mating—the act that gives adults babies—but he does not quite understand it.
Draco looks down at his hand, flexing his fingers. He has a feeling that Nev will be positively furious with him if he finds out what he did to Zabini, so he tells only Harry, who is struck by the realisation that Zabini is hiding his alpha status. ‘Strange. You’d think a Slytherin would be happy to prance around being alpha and powerful,’ Harry says. ‘Anyway, show me how you transformed only your hand. That’s bloody useful!’
They sit down, and it takes only a little gentle prodding from Jane for the story to come spilling out of Harry. When he has run out of words and his grief lies naked between them, Jane simply takes him into her arms once more, and holds him.
Harry is alarmed. ‘No! Please don’t. I—I’ll be careful, I promise. I can take care of myself, Sirius, I swear. Please don’t come. I—This is the first time I’ve been … alone.’
“I was walking one moment, and in pain in the next. No, I didn’t see my attacker. All I caught was a flash of … black robes, I think.”
Harry should have remembered from his childhood with the Muggles that words don’t need to be spells to hurt. Sirius’s tirade sears against his skin, delivered by a stranger so contorted with rage, he looks a monster’s league away from his loving godfather usually so quick with a good joke or a warm hug.
As he rambled, he set a fresh pot and a plateful of warm muffins in front of Harry. Harry listened, munching on the muffin, the sense of guilt deepening within him. Had he ever paused to consider his classmates outside of school? No, he hadn’t. He didn’t bother with people once he had branded them as Slytherin. What did Millicent Bulstrode, who had once support Umbridge, matter? Harry hadn’t realised what a stubborn, narrow-minded prick he could be sometimes.
‘I missed you too, love.’ He presses his palm closer against Harry’s skin, his fingers curling around the back of Harry’s neck. A thumb runs along Harry’s jaw, his cheek.
He laughed sycophantically at her joke now, ignoring the look Draco shot him. Before Draco could insert a jibe at Zabini’s expense, Slughorn ushered them into the classroom, greeting Zabini and Potter with ridiculous enthusiasm, completely ignoring Draco. Draco reminded himself sullenly that Slughorn was nothing more than a lousy teacher. He didn’t matter, had no real power.
Draco falls back, gritting his teeth against the fire spreading in his arm. Nagini hisses, slithering around him faster than he can imagine. He whirls around, gripping the fang, focussing his mind beyond the pain screaming across his skin. When the snake strikes next, Draco does too, sinking the fang deep into the snake’s belly.
They stood in the only clear space near the door, the towers of old desks terracing up to the ceiling in all directions. In the gaps between the stacked desks, Draco caught a glimpse of the far wall; it was all windows open to the cold night, a breeze slipping in once in a while.
Draco shot him a look. ‘That place hasn’t been home since the Dark Lord moved in … That Luna, she’s a Ravenclaw all right,’ he shook his head. ‘I don’t know how she convinced Voldemort to let her “serve” him … crazy girl.’
‘Good afternoon,’ Harry Potter says in a loud, clear voice. ‘Is it all right if I share your compartment? The others are full.’
She starts her diatribes so regularly in this manner that her listeners need ask her to clarify whom she meant.Harry hears Jane, who is sitting next to him, suppress a soft sigh. Mrs. Bennet receives no support from her audience, but she rarely requires encouragement to go on – particularly on a subject she feels personally insulted by.
‘Oh.’ And in the cold, wet darkness, Draco feels the chains looping around Harry and him once more, drawing them closer.
Draco releases his arm when he sees that Harry is better. He studies him, grey eyes piercing. Harry looks away. It would be better if he’s the slightest bit like Draco: gloriously golden, a boy whom people can see at a glance is meant for great things. People aren’t drawn to Draco only because he is Veela and alpha; they simply are, because Draco Malfoy tells the most entertaining stories and has the meanest, but funniest jokes.
Draco knows that he isn’t: Harry has lost weight, and his skin has taken on a grey pallor. He has also been oddly frantic, checking the
Harry is rescued from the Dursleys, and raised by Minerva, and his godfathers Sirius and Moony. Draco is a Veela child adopted by the Malfoys. An A/B/O AU where our boys are soulmates and grow up together through the years at Hogwarts.
‘I disagreed with them. So, my boy, don’t you dare disagree with me!’ Father said, smiling to show that he is only joking, and they both knew that Draco often got what
Silence clunks into place between them. Draco looks down, taking another sip of wine. Around them, the pub twirls with the merriment of a busy Friday evening. Friends heckle each other to guzzle more beer. Colleagues whine over wine.
Malfoy took the papers instinctively, his body shaking in the chill of the morning. He read the headlines and groaned, deep and painful. He picked up his wand, letting the newspaper flutter to the ground. He summoned a robe, wrapped it around himself and walked out of Goyle’s mum’s restaurant before Harry or Zabini could stop him.
A great, ear-splitting crack rings through the castle, the ground trembling beneath their feet, as they take the stairs two, three at time to the basement. Harry pauses, listening to the distant sound of lusty roars and shrieks. Draco seizes his hand, pulling him along; his godfathers are already in the kitchens.
‘Good evening, Potter.’ Malfoy had moved back a little, and he nodded politely at the others. ‘I won’t keep you from your nap. I just have a question for you.’
‘Is that so?’ Harry says, his heart beating a little faster. He takes a half-step forward. ‘That is an intriguing prospect. Where might I find this Wiltshire acquaintance of yours?’
—but Mathis’s eyes are steely, and his grip is painful on Draco’s shoulders. ‘Quite enough,’ he says firmly. ‘I believe you are seventeen, not
is his wand? Frantically searching through the grass, he slices his palms open on rock and marble fragments. He looks blankly at the blood pooling in his lifelines and wipes them on his robes. His wand is wedged between the broken parts of a headstone. He staggers to his feet, holding his wand out in front of him.
He has been thinking enough of Malfoy that he is startled to encounter the gentleman himself whilst taking a flight about the neighbourhood one night. He
Draco sits straight-backed, hands curled around a steaming mug of tea. Harry mirrors him across the kitchen table, gulping down his tea to chase away the last of the mead-induced fogginess. The Veela watches him, still and silent, grey eyes trailing from Harry’s face, to his throat, his shoulders and arms, and back to his face; like the stroke of soft, warm palms against his skin. Harry suppresses a shiver.
Harry nods, unable to speak. He rubs the wetness from his face. He won’t cry, because Sirius is hurt, and if there is anything Harry can do to help him, he must be strong enough to do it.
Harry looked around at his friends, who were in various states of surprise. Hermione turned to Ron, grinning triumphantly.
network, I do have an acquaintance of sorts who has house elves. They live in a creaky old manor in Wiltshire, which requires quite a number of hands to maintain. Perhaps they might be able to spare a house elf. I am certain that you might be able to come to some sort of agreement with them.’
Harry avoids their gaze, stabbing his fork into the sticky date pudding. Merlin’s pants, his godfathers are encouraging him to go have sex. Ron and Neville would find this hysterical. But, all right, there is some sense in what Sirius said. Maybe if he just has sex, he will stop being so affected by what Draco is doing, and he can finally –
He scarcely knows how to look the other boy in the eye now, knowing what he does: that their lives are unreservedly twined with each other’s from here on out.
Zabini was one of the few Slytherins who had friends in other houses. Despite what he said about Hufflepuff, he had a close childhood friend in the House of Badgers. His mother wasn’t even a Slytherin, but a Ravenclaw and as a socialite, had friends from all four Houses. This was one of the reasons the Malfoys, Parkinsons, Goyles and Crabbes did not care for Mrs Zabini’s company.
He shook his head, furious. How could he forget that the public eye was constantly on him? Merlin’s pants and ballsack, he had been too sodding careless.
With his tall, fine figure, pleasant countenance and status as an unmarried man, Mr. Charles Bingley is certain to cause a stir in society here, Muggle and wizard alike. Harry regards this with amused condolence for the other man, especially so when Mrs. Bennet and his youngest sister Lydia ply him with question upon question about Bingley.
He continues running, his mind blank with terror and despair. His skin is burning, but not with the pain he is used to. It isn’t wholly unpleasant; it feels like an awakening. His back is aching, the space between his shoulder blades tender to the touch. The monster within him is ready to take flight.
Narcissa’s eyes were swimming with tears. She reached up, placing a hand on the back of Draco’s neck, leaning her forehead against his. She closed her eyes, her tears slipping down her cheeks, perfect as pearls.
It is a simple matter for them to settle Draco’s trunk and owl cage in the compartment, leaving his parents with enough time to worry and fret over the small details. In the midst of Draco’s exasperated reply of
She peered at him worriedly. ‘Oh, you do have the worst dark eye circles. Did you even sleep last night?’
Halfway through their journey, they are joined by a Muggle-born first-year with bushy brown hair and an overbearing bossy demeanour. She is dragging a bewildered redheaded boy with her, saying that they are looking for fellow first-years. Draco is inclined to ignore her, but Harry is absurdly kind.
Hermione will surely be successful in whatever she chooses to do, and she will have plenty of options. Neville has already decided that he would go into Herbology. Ron waffles along, but Draco can see him settling into a job at the Ministry, like his father, and being perfectly contented with his lot.
Slughorn seemed to appreciate the lie though because he beamed beneficently at him. Behind him, Potter made a show of rolling his eyes and gagging. Draco wanted to simultaneously smack him on the back of the head and snog him silly.
Harry, Jane and Kitty part with Lizzy with great warmth, a degree high enough to mask Lydia’s churlishness and Mrs. Bennet’s peevishness. The latter’s exclusion is entirely Mr. Bennet’s doing; the patriarch understood that his children would be obliged to bring their mother, albeit at the cost of their overall felicity, and very sternly requested for his wife to stay behind. Harry is sufficiently surprised and pleased by his father’s rare display of action.
‘Draco is no coward,’ Mother’s voice was calm and arctic; her grip on Draco’s arm was tight to the point beyond pain. ‘He is
Harry privately thinks there is some merit to be considered of his mother’s suggestion of a holiday amongst larger society. Perhaps there are monies he could move around to make the wistful idea into reality. However, there is a large expense he foresees regarding the Longbourn house elf, Dobby. The house elf has come of age last year, and since his forebear’s demise six years prior, has been serving the Bennets alone. Harry wants to bring another elf to Longbourn, but he gathers from his thus far superficial research that it will be a complicated process involving the compatibility between house elf and house.
Harry whirls around, the bauble of light bobbing with his movement. Draco stops, blinking at him with too innocent eyes. The prat is
‘Will you answer my bloody question?’ Malfoy’s voice is low, controlled, suppressed. ‘Why is it so fucking important that you know what I went through during the war?’
It took a few moments for Luc to marshal his thoughts; he had clearly been expecting anger. He drew himself back, stamped down on his heaving anger, and said in a strained voice, ‘You’re advocating the so-called Slytherin Registry. You’re perpetuating the idea of Slytherin as an evil House, and you’re allowing thousands of innocent children to be branded as criminals. You’re –’
Elsewhere, someone is shrieking for help—they are under attack. ‘It’s Dumbledore!’ The professors have entered the fray. Draco cannot focus, because the world is swimming around him. He is sliding downwards, his claws catching on Harry’s robes, cheek pressed against Harry’s chest. His wings are not moving. His head tilts back, and he sees Harry looking down, eyes dark with desperation.
side of the war—was here. He wouldn’t know the abrupt recognition that crashes through Draco upon sight of Sirius Black’s godson, igniting the ludicrous desire to unfurl his Veela wings.
Lips trembling, eyes wet, curled up tight under the blanket, Draco looks once more like the eight-year-old boy who had to learn to fear his own beauty. Harry breaks his own rules, and reaches out to take Draco’s hand, closing his fingers around the cold fist. Draco’s eyes snaps to his face, tears slipping down his cheeks.
They fall silent, and in the silence, Draco hears his heartbeat pulsing at his temples. His muscles are trembling at the effort of keeping him in place, and he is frozen to the bone; there is only so long even his Veela body is capable of bearing the strain.
Potter is staring at the neat rows of tomato plants, arms crossed over his chest. "Yes, what was left of them, after we burned the palace down."
The man and woman are watching them, expressions cool and haughty. The man turns away, murmuring something to the kid, but the woman steps forwards, blocking her family from view.
‘Come here, you filthy little tart,’ Potter said with something akin to affection. He slung an arm around Draco’s shoulders and drew him up. Heedless of his own cum on Draco’s lips, he began kissing Draco very thoroughly.
In the end, Zabini is the one to crack. ‘You needn’t worry, Malfoy,’ he says, his low voice inaudible to human ears amongst the hubbub of class, but clear to Draco’s. ‘I’m not interested in Potter.’
before and loved it. We told Teddy he can’t transform in front of Muggles anymore or we would have to take him out of kindergarten – Ministry orders and all that. Teddy was so upset …”
‘Ah, how nice. All three of you have bought wands from me, haven’t you? And you bring me your progeny now,’ Ollivander says in a peculiarly dreamy manner. ‘Lovely, lovely.’
Potter’s eyes were steady on his. They were standing across the table from each other, but they might as well be mere centimetres apart. There was an indescribable expression on Potter’s face that caused Draco’s breath to stick in his throat. His gaze was molten on Draco’s skin.
‘I am sorry I was not strong enough to truly be your friend,’ Harry says. ‘You were right that night at Longbourn. I was not your friend, even though I
Harry huffs, twisting around to look up at the blond. The other man glares down at him, hands on either side of Harry’s head. Harry sees his beauty painted by moonlight: pale skin, eyes silver as daggers, flushed cheeks, kiss-swollen lips—and desire crashes through him, destroying all other thoughts. Oh, this is easy, far easier than he could ever have imagined with this man he once loathed.
The Cabinet was slumped to one side, on account of the broken leg; Draco had to shove old books beneath it to keep it straight. It was once a deep varnished black with sparkling glass doors. The glass was broken now and the black had faded to a whitish-grey. There was Fanged Fungus growing on the inside where water had got in.
He takes another deep clean breath, waiting for his heartbeat to slow. He is not hurt in any way; he was merely momentarily overwhelmed by the stench, incapable of understanding what it is. Ollivander offers no satisfactory answer to his brusque questions either, and he leaves the shop, feeling thwarted.
‘Yes, Professor, but I would like to have a little more time to mentally prepare myself for the experience,’ Draco says very seriously; that is a silly excuse no one will believe, but how can Draco explain his certainty that he must go after Harry, because he must make certain that they are in the same House?
He must go to Harry. He tries to think through the panic fogging up his mind, but there is too much commotion. People around them are pushing and shouting—something about getting away—and suddenly, Dumbledore is there, bearing down upon Draco with a grave look in his eyes. ‘Come with me, Mr Malfoy. No, no, stay here, Miss Granger, nothing to worry about. Yes, I believe Harry is in the lead.’
And Draco gives himself up to Harry’s touch and the tremors of pleasure and heat rippling across his skin. He drowns in Harry’s scent, melting chocolate and syrupy treacle, dripping into his open, panting mouth, his hands pressed against Harry’s hot, damp skin. At some point, his wings tear through his human façade, and they are surrounded in pale downy feathers, Harry whispering, ‘
should be hiding his true sex. He learns that in India, they pray to an omega Hindu god for luck and positive changes; that amongst the North American indigenous cultures, omegas fulfil important leadership roles; that on certain Pacific Islands, omegas are considered too precious to be allowed to mix with the rest of society.
to put his name into the Goblet of Fire, never mind the fact that he hasn’t the foggiest idea how to cheat the Age Line. He wouldn’t listen, that it must be someone who wants to see Harry injured in the Triwizard Tournament, because it’s surely going to be dangerous.
It is absurd that Malfoy is implying that Harry was in an assignation. What could Zabini have told him? Harry remembers the dark gentleman’s arch smile at the tea shop, and the tacit slyness in his questions earlier. Had Zabini
She was so angry when he told her what his aunt and uncle said about Lily and James Potter. ‘They are
With every beat of his heart, he was made more aware of how much he owed Potter, how Potter had saved his life
He kept a steady pace all the way through the burned-out Knockturn Alley, up Diagon Alley and straight to the doors leading to the offices of the
When Potter was kissing him, Draco could forget the persistent pounding headache that had sprung up behind his eyes, could pretend Zabini and Pansy weren’t still furious at him, could ignore the looming shape of the unfixed Cabinet.
, because he continues talking about his mother moving to France, his favourite spots on their French estate, and the fairly peaceful summer he spent there, and he is asking Harry about his summer, about Ginny.
‘Colin was very fond of you,’ Mr. Creevey continues, his voice gentle now. ‘You were so kind to him when he was a first year. You helped him immensely, Mr. Bennet – perhaps more than you realise.’
‘It is good to see you, Harry!’ Professor Sprout said cheerfully. ‘Come now, Minerva. Let the poor boy sit down and have a cuppa. Can’t you see he’s practically blue?’
Lord Voldemort raised a hand to stem her stomach-turning flood of words. ‘How touching,’ he said dryly. ‘Truly, there is nothing like mother’s love.’
They parted for the space of a breath and Potter dragged him in again, glasses skewed, eyes wild and unseeing. He pressed Draco down onto the desks, table edges digging into Draco’s back, but any discomfort was worth it because Harry Potter was
Dumbledore’s memory, which Harry refuses to talk about, only saying that it doesn’t change what they need to do. Draco knows that he is telling the truth now: the old professor has left him instructions on killing the Dark Lord. He nods, shrugging off Neville’s arm, and transforms with a shudder, his wings flourishing out.
‘No,’ Neville insists, lunging forwards to touch Harry; Draco crouches over Harry, hissing. ‘Let me see! You must be wrong—he can’t be dead—he must kill Voldemort. No one else can do it. We must end this! Let me
‘You’ve been up here all along and you haven’t killed the old coot yet? You useless imbecile!’ Yaxley shouted and shoved Draco forward, sending him stumbling. ‘Go on, do it then!’
‘I’m not doing anything wrong,’ Goyle blurted. ‘My ma owned this shop, see, it used to be a restaurant, only it isn’t anymore because it’s illegal to work here, but the law didn’t say anything about
The entrance sealed up behind him, leaving Draco standing alone in the cold corridor. He headed down the corridor in the direction of the Prefects’ Bathroom and the faint sound of footsteps started again. Draco’s teeth were ground so tightly together, his jaw ached. He forced himself to relax, to keep his stride loose and easy.
Still, Harry found himself undeniably drawn to Luc. The tender ache pulsing in his chest was now a constant whenever he was in Luc’s presence.
Harry chokes on his beer, spitting it out, and wipes his mouth furiously. ‘Draco’s not my boyfriend! Why do you think that?’
His heart was beating quick and loud. He would be stupid not to notice that Potter was looking at him more and more these days, his gaze lingering on Draco’s face, hands and body. His eyes were soft and warm with emotions Draco dared not consider. It was impossible that Potter could – no,
“Yeah, they were quite reluctant to talk about it. Something about it being highly experimental and unstable,” Potter shrugged.
Draco looks down at Harry pale and lifeless, and raises his heavy head. There is only one thing left to do before he can finally stop. He nods, and gestures for his friends to return to the castle; he would join them later. His friends leave on their brooms, Hermione weeping disconsolately. He sinks to his knees, cradling Harry’s head in a clawed hand, gathering the limp body to his chest. His head bowed, he regards the great darkness that crushes upon him, and he cannot breathe, his throat choking on a sob.
‘I couldn’t scream, couldn’t move—I was yelling, shrieking in my head, but nobody came,’ Draco’s eyes are wide and unseeing, looking past Harry and into darkness Harry cannot penetrate. ‘
Draco gave a sharp bark of laughter. ‘Well, you’ll have to go back to the female Weasley and have ten red-haired children, won’t you?’
‘I do not like the look of the Goyle brat,’ he murmurs to Mother. ‘You be careful of him and Crabbe Junior, Draco.’
He smells of damp earth and rotting plants, and his hand leaves moist black streaks on Draco’s face. His eyes – wide and unblinking – are scouring Draco from head to toe, desire piercing into Draco like needles under his fingernails. Draco’s skin is crawling with the fire ants of revulsion, his insides squirming with Flobberworms. He wants to throw up, his mouth watering with saliva, his throat convulsing.
She looks at him with her usual straightforward gaze. ‘I heard that Draco is back. He would stop me if he’s here, so I want to check with you now. Is there no chance that you would say yes if I ask you out?’
The Malfoys too, donated vast sums of Galleons to rebuilding Britain, to funds for orphans and the homeless, to a more humane prison on Azkaban. The political winds in post-war Britain changed swiftly, powered mostly by Malfoy money. This might have earned Draco influence, if he were a little more human, but everyone knows how Draco went berserk during the Battle of Hogwarts; society is expectedly leery of unmated alphas with inhuman strength.
Harry tries telling Yoshio-san that Draco is always hurt trying to protect him. ‘But it is his duty,’ the other man replies, dumbfounded. ‘As it was your duty to kill the Dark Lord.’
, memorising the plants in the textbook Minnie and he are working through, but worth it when Minnie and his godfathers are so pleased with him – even if Sirius teases him for being the most prepared-for-school eight-year-old in Britain.
‘So that’s how it is? You can snog me knowing you’re helping the man who wants me dead,’ Potter spat, his words, his eyes vicious.
Harry instinctively reaches out to catch the other man, and they are touching, and Harry’s defences shatters.
Theo worked at Flourish & Blotts, and dropped by often to have lunch with Draco. Draco admitted they didn’t have much in common, but Theo was sensible and moderate in a way the people around him had never been.
He walked past that joke shop set up by the Weasley twins, unable to keep himself from staring at the horrendous shop windows. He had to bite back a smile at the
One, he sees in the mirror that the woman, Sirius’ cousin, is not offended by his rudeness; in fact, she’s smiling. She’s pleased to have been even addressed by Sirius.
, evil fucker,’ Minnie said when she heard. Everyone gawped at her, until she snorted and added primly: ‘A lady swears when she must. An immortal Dark Lord calls for it.’ The twins applauded her loudly for that.
Draco looked at Potter and saw the other boy felt very much the same. It was an odd sensation, knowing that for once, he was in sync with Harry Potter when just a few hours ago, Draco had viciously broken a defenceless Potter’s nose.
‘As he should. James needed to be taken down a peg or two, admit it,’ Remus interjects. He turns to Draco, a look in his eyes that makes Draco queasy. ‘I suppose your parents have told you the usual fairy tales?’
Merlin, he was more tired than he had expected. He wondered when it would be appropriate to excuse himself to bed. However, it seemed that Theo was only getting into stride ranting about the injustice of discrimination against Slytherins.
‘That is a good question,’ Hermione says, eyes lit as it does when she encounters an intellectual challenge. ‘Hogwarts castle is ancient. There are bound to be more secrets—do you remember first year? All the underground chambers!’
‘Look, we are only going round and round in circles splitting hairs at this rate. You say you aren’t mad at me for anything, and the thought of blaming
The Weasleys make noises of disgust, as the brown-haired female looks exasperated, nearly identical to Mother's next to him. Blaise half-turns towards him, a furious look on his face, mouth opening, but Potter cuts through the rising chatter: "If you fuck anyone else," he says pleasantly, "I will cut your knot off and choke you with it."
“No, Foster! You are what’s costing me. Don’t kill me. Please.” His grip on Foster shook. He didn’t notice what the waterfall was doing until it was too late.
“That’s absurd.” Collin couldn’t help it. So far, he was doing a poor job at humility, even for his own survival.
The bracelet sat on a cushion of black velvet. It looked impossibly small, thin and delicate, not the iron-ore chunk he’d imagined. It was meant to look as innocent as a baby, he reasoned. Well crafted. Deceptively so. Sweet and harmless, like it could break. He knew that it was the hardest substance in the muggle world, and that it would never break. Its careful design was meant to have everyone who saw it, instantly forgive the parent for making a two-year old bear the weight of vanity, of selfish parental pride. A baby’s new skin was all the beauty and adornment any of them needed, without adults rushing to hurry and add value to the perfection that was already there.
“Be sharp, boy. I’m not mean spirited, I come to help you. I need you to use that noggin of yours to listen. Of course I know who you are. The same way everyone knows you. People talk. Pictures don’t always mind their own business, just like you don’t always mind your own business. Think very carefully about what you want to know from me, because our time is limited. My chores aren’t going to do themselves and I’m losing daylight.”
“Your testimony, your friends, and a sympathetic jury, allowed a Death Eater to walk free. What would a blood test show of your daughter’s parentage?”
So much was happening that night. Once I had her settled, I focused on you. I put it out of my mind. Now that she was here, it was like hitting the ground running. I guess I let myself forget. When I look back on it, I think, how could I? But I had to. I couldn’t tell you, so it was best to forget. And maybe that’s what those darker eyes mean. Forget you ever saw this, or she won’t be safe.
Gamy looked sharply at him. “You will do no such thing. If I thought it was safe, I’d open the attic terrace and let you all traipse up there to have your fill. But it’s not. Whatever’s going on, we’ll sit tight and wait it out.”
This youngest Malfoy was not known for escaping his father’s shadow. And the rumors were true. He was beautiful. His eccentricities were forgiven because he pulled it off quite powerfully. Talk changed from policies, to Draco’s ability to shmoosh the pants off the bourgeois. Guests doubled their donations when he stopped at their tables. Trippled, when he let it be known that he could be persuaded to dance. By the time the fundraiser exceeded its goal by two million galleons, at the strike of midnight, no one was talking politics. Everyone was talking Draco.
“The spirits who are constantly around you.” She stepped closer to him, her voice lowering. “You are being attacked. Psychically. Those who love you, will speak through anyone capable of hearing them, not just me. I bring their messages.”
Ash had seen Foster's body before. But a man in purpose and motion, was very different from one lying still and medicated. Foster handled his body the way he handled his business, brusque and efficient. In motion, his bare skin conformed to taut flexibility that boasted of a mature man's torso and midriff. The subcutaneous layer between muscle and skin filled out soft places down his arms and stomach, disappearing into his trousers. His upper arms and chest held an appealing roundness to them, but looked dense with underlying hardness. Ash memorized the details and said nothing as he watch Foster produce his wand.
Thella pricked the back of his hand and was now using a pestle and mortar to mix it with a series of powders and salts she’d pulled from her little stack of storage boxes. Some of it looked surprisingly like flour and dirt. The mixture formed a clay and she molded it with her bare hands. At one point, she turned her back to him and said something under her breath, but she turned back to him and finished the process by letting it heat in foil, over a simple tea candle.
There are stray sounds creaking up the foundation of the mansion at any given time. It’s what’s expected of a five hundred year old edifice, erected on battlegrounds soaked with the blood of his ancestors. The subterranean ventilation chambers and isolation cells alone, channel the wind through damp canals, turning the place into a vertical stone flute at times. Filtered through the bones of the architecture, it sounds like the gritty death throes of something beneath the earth, slowly and softly losing its life.
Avi held up his hands. "Don't panic. I don’t mean to alarm you. As severe as that diagnosis is, as serious, your body is recuperating at an incredible rate. Your magic really is something."
Since that day, he'd only given into Harry's plea to let Mrs. Weasley babysit twice. Between her and Hermione, the older woman did have valuable experience that Hermione lacked. But that didn't make it okay. Draco wanted to be all that his sister needed to stay safe and happy. He owed her that. He owed Harry that. Harry wasn't supposed to worry about who was looking after her. That was Draco's job. After two years, when he couldn't pretend to be some mythical superhero of a brother, or father, he'd made up his mind to have the balls to do what Harry could not. To say the words, "I can't do this anymore. I'm tired. I need help."
“The hell you aren’t! That’s crazy talk and it’s forbidden in our house. If I weren’t trying to impress you, I’d be guilty of some very inappropriate things by now. You looked so hot sleeping, I could’ve molested you right then.”
She'd told Ron and Draco afterwards, "He totally saw Harry in my mind. I couldn't stop him. But at the same time, I felt his alarm. I felt that he cared. It wasn't a lie, and I had to trust him."
Hell yes, the passion is hot. I want Draco knocked the bleep up! But not right away. I want him to be too proud to admit what he feels that he complicates everything. I want him always to be slender, elegant, and rich, next to Harry’s lackluster, common willingness to rub elbows with anyone. I want him to fit into Harry’s world like a square peg in a round hole, so that there is no rest to the challenges of their love.
Sirius had kissed his neck so softly. Below the waist, he was behaving himself. But the brush of his lips  did more to make Remus ultra aware of his readiness to go again, than the nudge he felt elongating on the slope of his ass. Sirius’ demand for him, evidenced by his weight, his draping of those toned tattoos and tight muscles along the length of Remus’ backside, said everything. Was everything. And Remus could’ve stayed that way all morning, had he not pressed for more. His kisses grew longer and lower as he talked.
If he did it, he mused, it would officially be the worst thing he'd ever done. He trusted his friends with his life, but there was no going back if he let them see the dog version of himself doing this.
Patrificus Totalus, is a harsh spell. Rankar explained that it was like clubbing someone over the head to temporarily stun their functions. He preferred the gentler,
He wondered briefly if it was storming outside. Muggle electronics couldn’t handle power outages or surges. He could remember the Dursleys losing the power that ran their house, and having to help Aunt Petunia gather up flashlights and candles. He knew there were things like backup generators, especially in hospitals, but it comforted him that the place benefited from magic that could take care of any power outage.
Rankar’s smile was friendly and sincere. He looked as handsome as ever, as if being cosmetically well-groomed and put together was what he did in his spare time. He appeared to hold no grudge against Harry.
She folded her arms and frowned. “James, technically, this is our son’s wedding night. It’s the biggest disaster in the history of disasters. Mother says the marriage isn’t cursed, but I can’t help feeling like it is. I just want to find an expert, someone who can tell us something. We’re holding that boy hostage!”
Harry thought of saying, ‘You’re the Minister. Just dig around in one of your convenient regulations and cite charges against the paper. Fine them. Have someone arrested for show, then let them back out. Address the barbaric practice of sneaking photos in a public manner, instead of side-stepping the issue in private with me. Oh, and I’m fine by the way.’
Prisoners are not allowed to dream in Azkaban. That is, sleep cycles are influenced by security spells which prevent one from entering the deepest stages of sleep for extended periods. It is in the deepest stages of rest that the body repairs itself and cleanses cellular chemistry with an influx of renewed vitality. A fresh start. If truest and deepest sleep were allowed, wizards would cure themselves of their nightmares. Trauma, inflicted by the presence of dementors, would lessen and heal over time, resulting in adaptation to conditions until finally being little affected by them. Eventually, every wizard would be able to reclaim his or her magic, even behind prison walls, which would of course render the concept obsolete. Can't have that. Spells and drugged food did not allow the soul to escape through dreams. The body's hold was not allowed to loosen.
“Okay.” She was right, that was best. Something about feeling how unyielding his father was, dislodged his foothold on his own integrity. He’d felt as if the strength coming from those fingers, were trying to speak to him in ways that words could not. There’d been a more urgent message in their grip, but Harry was too rattled to decipher it. How can right and wrong simply not matter to anyone? Surely, the Universe wasn’t that heartless. Surely, better answers lay somewhere else. And that wasn’t the man he’d loved and put on a pedestal. That energy had felt completely different.
When the sirens sounded, he was no where near killing Lucius, and that angered him enough to have him picking up landscaping stones and smashing them over various parts of Lucius’s body. He swore he wasn’t getting locked up until something broke. He had to actually hold Lucius down over a bird fountain and use the concrete bowl to brace his shoulder and chest while he pulled the arm back as far as he could get it. It took repeated smashings with a stone, to break the humorous and get it to pop out of its socket.
Once Harry spoke his full name to the group and invoked his magic to come to the foreground of their intentions by moving his napkin, Lucius looked to James Potter, who delivered a formal speech of welcome and a recital of what they were all there for. The ritual had begun. Lucius led the others in sipping his tea, as was the customary response of acceptance to the Potter’s request to allow the courtship of their sons. When all six drank, the act completed a circuit that identified the roles and wishes of all present at the table. The air thickened as unseen specters and ancestors entered to bear witness. In adjoining rooms, James’s mother, her two sisters, and Lily’s mother and uncle entertained themselves as they waited for the outcome.
He didn’t feel he had the right to move forward, to touch Draco even just to restrain him, but the changing color of the wall, got him leaping into action. He slipped on broken pieces of things, but sped into Draco’s body with enough impact to swing him away from the wall. One jerk, and the wand slipped free of his slick hands. Draco’s limbs were long and subtle in their strength as they struggled out of Harry’s grasp. Harry, shorter but stronger, put all his weight into caging the other’s arms to himself. He was counting on Draco’s lack of street skills, to make subduing him easier. Magic would’ve been easier, but cold. He had to face this battle at ground level, hand to hand. Touch still meant something in his family.
Tension strained around the table. Lily looked down, the only indication that she was struggling to hold her tongue. As long as her husband kept up the fight, she wouldn’t have to jump in unless he was in trouble. So far, she thought he was handling Lucius very well.
It took some doing to reassure her. At no point and time did he hear her say she’d give Foster up, and he listened for it, but her display of regret over her lies was satisfying enough for the moment. He talked her into pulling back onto the road and trusting what was to come next. “Take the day off and enjoy yourself.”
“Draco! Don’t you dare use me as an excuse to keep yourself from happiness. If you want a kid, I’d sign up to share him with you. Right now. I knew you were right for me, the minute I saw you. I’m not scared of the responsibility of having a kid with you. I’m honored. And if you don’t do it with me, I can tell that it’s something you want so much, that you’ll do it eventually. If I’m not a part of that, I’ll fucking lose it. I don’t want to see someone else enjoying what I could with you. Let me have that role in your life. You know me now. And I know, like you said, right or wrong, your gonna try to make up for what you did, by giving a child passage into this world. You want him back so strongly, you’d leave me out of the equation. Don’t leave me out. Let me give you the one thing that will soothe you.”
Harry wanted to say something, but he was both mesmerized and horrified by the ten pee-sized bump this produced on Draco’s skin. If he were awake, that would be excruciating.
“They would’ve mistreated him,” she sniffed. “They were. We did the right thing. It’s not as if he’s a common criminal. We couldn’t let it happen and we couldn’t expose our world. We’ll be fined, we’ll be slapped with community service, but I’m perfectly willing to pay my debt to both societies, in order to demonstrate my honesty and morality. My clients will trust me all the more when they see that I have firsthand experience with legal disparity, and how willing I am to make things right again.”
"And I ask only that you take your people out of here, not apologize." To aid his position on the matter, Avi was joined by two more figures wearing security stripes affiliated with CIUM. Central International of Unified Magic.
When the change happened, when he took one of the wafers and put on the special sunglasses Avi sent to him, his vision had opened to another world entirely. There were now buildings in places he thought were empty lots. There were young people he thought were homeless, wearing splendid robes and carrying wands. Seniors at the retirement village were flying on brooms and throwing balls through giant hoops. It was like a hidden world within the normal world. It was all so great. The wafer and glasses had come with a note: Observe only! Do not interfere with anything you see.
“I feel the magic in the blood. It tells me where to go and who needs my service. Very early, my training was with a great wizard family. I left the horde of my kind, to work with humans. That’s our tradition. That’s one way that we learn about the world, and how to get on in it. When I was new in their home, I was there for the birth of a female. I was allowed to play with her, but not to bound my service to her. We elves knew what was coming because of her magic. She grew into a strong witch. And sure enough, her family cast her out when her magic would not obey theirs. If I had been bonded by loyalty to that family, I could not have looked after her. I tried to help her when I could. As she made her own life, with her own husband, she shunned me. She thought I was spying for her family. But she accepted my help at times when she had no choice. She was too proud to ask for help. When she had a child, she forbade me to ever come to her again. She had cut ties with the magical world and I never saw her again.
“Yes, and humble as it is, this house is all the magical fortress that we need. All of our strength is in here. If you need a visual, then use all that technology your son talked you into buying. Surely you can see all around the place without standing on a bloody roof in the middle of a lightning storm.”
Canceling the lecture due to this strange emergency, was on the tip of his tongue. He couldn’t be expected to hold her while he attempted to engage the audience. He wouldn’t go through with it. Seems Banks was getting the photo he’d wanted after all, and Harry was royally pissed by the time he got to the stage. He was so thrown by Draco’s behavior, he wasn’t thinking of the talisman he’d made with Thella. He wasn’t anywhere in the vicinity of love and if anyone got in his face right now, there’d be no way for him to hide it.
To everyone else, Harry must’ve been a well-dressed presence, but the look he reserved for Draco, a monster’s scaly tail whipping out of the water too fast for others to see, practically lifted him off his feet and set him back down. That was just a warning, Harry's eyes had said.
Harry felt his legs make the decision for him, moving and stopping when they were three feet across from her.
The woman looked stricken. When she could speak, she asked with quivering lips, "How are you doing that without a pensieve?"
He wanted to go and look inside, but he didn’t want to wake Draco. Their moments were too few and too precious as it was. Any sudden disturbance could break his concentration and throw him from this dreamscape, back into the confusion he’d just left. Here, was where all the information was. Here, Draco slept like an angel, whose peace could not be disturbed. He could’ve watched him forever.
He clicked over to silence. His lawyer was gone. He was still researching the feasibility of buying the O’Hare hotel chain. The desire had started as a threat the morning that Harry was photographed in his shorts. He no longer wanted to fire anyone. That river had raged itself out, and didn’t seem to matter at all next to his desire to keep Harry and Iece safe. Wizards like them, needed a sanctuary, especially while traveling. He wanted to install greater security measures, and he could only do that if he either owned the chain, or developed his own network in the service industry. He didn’t want to become a hotel owner, but he’d put on that hat if that was the only way he could be sure of guaranteeing his family’s well-being. Between work at the Ministry, Harry’s setbacks and keeping Iece happy, business plans were slow.
“That’s the thing about power. People who have a great amount, aren’t the best judges of how to use it. People fear him for a reason. He’s been on the run for years.”
This little fic burst from me in something of a sudden rage to get out. It rose up in response to a lot of anti-noncon/rape talk. I was speaking to the hypocrite in people who've convinced themselves that the only sex worth writing about, is sex that's sweet and tender, and everything goes well. That can be great, but don't act like you don't know what an orgasm really is. It's an acceleration of the body and mind that is so aggressive in thrust, that it results in seizures, temporal disruption, loss of motor skills, and disorientation. In short, orgasms are violent! Incredibly pleasurable, but physically violent.
Severus folded the contract and absorbed it back into his wand. “Times have changed. I don’t know what you’ve witnessed, but they need not prostrate themselves in a manner that makes them subordinate to Universal power. Their so-called gods and ancestors, keepers of old magic, are valid only in people and places that honor the old traditions. A modern wizard can achieve the same effects if he knows the most rudimentary physics.”
“No.” Lucius answered. “But we were treated to a lovely seizure and the development of skin that tears like tissue. Why stop at rashes? And your family is convinced that your magic is protecting Draco, when he is literally being flayed by it.”
Okay, maybe this was all in his mind. Just nerves. Stress. It takes a lot of energy to constantly maintain this level of professionalism. He had a lot to make up for. His mind was playing tricks, just because Harry was good looking. But that’s all. He could admit that without going crazy. Just go on greet him. Get it over with. You’re not a child, you don’t have to fear what excites you. Face it and let it go.
“I’m not your husband, no matter what any contract says. And I can get any piano I want, myself. I have far more money than you do.”
Foster's instructions to him, had been very clear. "Keep your head down. Say nothing. Observe. If a witch or wizard senses your interest, they will close themselves off to you. Act as if any magic you see is no cause for concern and you will be allowed to stand in their presence. Those who are in agreement with the discretionary involvement of non-magicals, will be wearing the IA insignia. Do not trust anyone without it."
He would’ve torn his eyes away, once he had her sorted, but she was looking back at him and not letting him go. There was no mistaking it.
They slipped on their shoes, dashing from the bedroom. The master console was in the den, and they nearly tripped over one another when they saw Harry standing in front of it.
Their tastes and habits had changed so much over the course of a year, that he took it for granted that Draco was always willing to be receptive. Now that Draco’s body was closer to its normal state, with his dick very much present, what if he had never met the real sexual Draco until now? What if there was a real appetite beneath his resignation, and now that he had the right tools, payback was inevitable. But that wasn’t what Draco was talking about.
Instead of responding with anything close to compassion, Harry blurted, “Your magic knows that we belong together. It would let me find you.”

Even though Draco was silent, for some reason he got an image of his down-curved lips sulking on the prospect of answering Harry.
“I’m not. Let me think. Just give me a minute.” He wanted to tell her to just say what she has to say, but something told him it was more complicated than that. When he really thought about it, he didn’t want to go inside her tiny picture. Such a huge reality leap would bound to have unnatural effects on his body. He couldn’t anticipate what his magic would do and he’d feel a lot better talking to someone who’s done this before. He wondered if Hermione had ever heard of such a thing. She’d be the one to ask.
Harry didn’t think they were ever going to leave. It helped when his parents showed up, waiting at the end of the hall and beckoned for the Malfoys to join them. With downcast eyes, Narcissa let her husband usher her down the hall.
Sirius exploded, “He fucking, excuse my French, absorbed everyone’s magic. That’s not wizardry, that’s sorcery. You saw that as well as I did, and we’re just gonna act like that’s normal because that’s what Lily wants. This is precisely what James is talking about. If I went around doing that, I’d be strong enough to break through barriers and probably hands-on healing, and God knows what else.”
He barely finished his sentence when she turned her stitching to face him. This time, she didn’t use her needle and thread. The threaded stitching simply rearranged itself, forming the words:
Harry nearly drowns then—nearly sinks under the lapping waves—but Draco is there to catch him, mist-coloured eyes and iron-clad arms. He holds Harry at night, stroking Harry’s hair back, murmuring that he is
Harry melts into the kiss, his body pliant and eager, as Draco wraps his arms around him, pressing him backwards into the cushions. Their lips move against each other with pleasurable friction, Draco biting down gently on Harry’s bottom lip. Harry gasps, mouth falling open, and Draco groans into the heat as their tongues meet. He pushes his hand beneath Harry’s T-shirt, the skin warm beneath his palm. Harry arches his back upwards, pressing his body closer.
"I think we should give my son and his majesty some time alone," Mother breaks in, her smile sharp as daggers when Eltanin opens his mouth to protest. "We have settled that they are soulmates, but there are clearly some … matters they must discuss before we come to the betrothal." She ignores Eltanin's glare.
’ve been feeling wretched for being attracted to a straight guy with a girlfriend!” Harry exclaimed.
Harry laughs, tossing his head back, the fire’s glow golden on his skin. ‘What, are you shy? Not our Draco, who has been sneaking off to dark corners with his boyfriends.’
Potter looked as horrified as she did. His arms instinctively tightened around Draco. ‘Hermione – I – we – this – your wand – put your wand away!’
It is looking down at its hands, brown skin smeared with mud, fingernails encrusted with grave dirt. It moves the hands up to its face, down its neck, over the protruding ribs and prominent hipbones. It stares down at its feet still stuck within the leftover soup of potion. It is very still, the moonlight on its skin colouring it granite.
‘I’ll kill him for you,’ Draco says, and they stare at him, lounging against the headboard, one leg drawn up on the bed. His hair braided over one shoulder, his expression languorous, he sounds as if he has offered to make a cup of tea for Harry.
and I honestly can’t understand it. One moment we’re hexing each other and you’re breaking my nose, and the next, you’re telling me you
Harry hums, eyes already closing. His breathing deepens, as he falls back to sleep. Draco closes his eyes, trying to steady his heartbeat. It shouldn’t matter, he tells himself, if Harry wants to date Ginny Weasley or anyone else, as long as he remains friends with Draco. That is all he needs, isn’t it? To be by Harry’s side.
‘I didn’t want to tell the Order what was only a suspicion,’ he said. ‘But I am afraid that after my years of research … I must conclude that Voldemort is still alive in some form somewhere.’
Luc sneered, shaking his head. ‘Do you honestly believe your own excuses for not doing anything, Potter? Like I said, pathetic little piece of shit.’ He turned to walk away.
? But why? Draco had liked Snape enough because he was a good Potions master and when he got him one-on-one, he was a decent teacher. Snape came over to dinner a few times and were friends with his parents, but he didn’t think Snape had affection enough for him to take the Unbreakable Vow to protect Draco. He stared at Snape, bewildered.
‘It doesn’t hurt much,’ Harry says brusquely. ‘Draco, what happened? What’s wrong? Did something hurt you?’
‘It’s a type of Muggle TV show. It’s a type of comedy, where people get into ridiculous situations and they try to get out of it and it becomes this huge cock-up and it’s funny,’ Harry explains. ‘Err … you do know what a TV is?’
He should be afraid, he thinks. Who is this man standing before him now? Neither of them are the boys left in the wake of the war. Maybe it’s the mead, swirling golden in his mind, but there is no hard edge of terror; the trembling in his chest feels more like …
Harry meets Zabini everyday at work for the next week – they are rushing out the order the Zabinis have placed for Madam Primpernelle’s newest foot cream, which Harry helped develop. They also have lunch together everyday, when they talk about everything from their days at Hogwarts, the war, and the new villa the Zabinis are building in Italy. It is refreshing talking to a Slytherin – Harry doesn’t have a single Slytherin friend, although they like to joke that Draco is a good stand-in for one.
Draco opens his mouth, and sucks in a breath. ‘I know,’ he manages to say. ‘I’ve known since first-year.’
“Besides,” Weasley chimed in around a mouthful of biscuit, “we learned from Luna how you had begged for her forgiveness.”
‘The French are more likely to accept him—they should be, since their Headmistress is half-giant,’ Father says. ‘No, I agree with you, Cissy, I’m only saying what’s true. I do wish Draco could attend Hogwarts like we did.’
Draco turned back to the newspaper. He read the first paragraph of the next article four times before he realised Potter was speaking.
‘You are mine,’ Draco echoes Harry’s words. ‘I know that. But I didn’t know if you are coming back. If you still wanted to be mine. Oh, but I could have written to you too, I know that. Communication takes the two of us, doesn’t it?’
The trees on the west of the Malfoy estate are ancient and gnarled, crowns heavy with dark green leaves and low-hanging boughs. Harry saw it from the air yesterday, when he and Draco went flying: the trees growing close and dark, and the desolate moors stretching out beyond it. It makes him uneasy, the flat green land stretching as far as he can see, the closest houses hazy on the horizon. There might as well be no one but he and Draco, hovering on their brooms.
‘We knew you were hiding your pain, because you do not wish to burden us,’ she says. ‘Lizzy, in her own clumsy, was trying her hardest to convince you that you could trust us to love you no matter what you might lay upon us. Thank you, Harry, for finally coming home again.’
Draco flinches like Harry is coming at him on a rampaging hippogriff. ‘I’ve never thought you are weak.’
‘I trust you will not disappoint me, Draco,’ his lord drawled, leaning back into his winged armchair. The chair was an antique Malfoy inheritance from the fifteenth century, but seeing the way Lord Voldemort had swept into the Manor and claimed it for the Death Eater headquarters, there was little doubt everything was
When his parents used to host, some adults gave Draco strange looks that felt like filth smeared across his skin, or uncomfortably tight hugs with clammy hands on his waist. When he told his mother about it, asking her if it would be polite to tell them to stop, she had turned ashen and he never saw those adults again.
Zabini unrolled the parchment and raised his eyebrows. ‘Not a love letter, I’m afraid,’ he said, eyes flicking to Pansy. ‘An invitation from Professor Slughorn to join him for lunch.’
‘Why won’t you say it? What are you afraid of?’ he demands, refusing to be distracted. ‘Yes, I’ve been to my father’s grave. Where do you think I was for the past week? I went with Mother, and I—I’m handling it, and I know I can, because I have you.’
Draco looks over at Harry to find him looking at him as if Draco is the endless universe and Harry is interstellar. His breath hitches in his chest. Harry’s hand tightens around his, his finger stroking one of Draco’s knuckles.
‘Draco, Draco, please, it’s me. Calm down. Talk to me. Tell me what’s wrong,’ he says pleadingly. ‘Draco,
Her demurs are thoroughly renounced by her friends, who expound on her numerous contributions to the field and the accolades she has received from highly respected scholars. As Lizzy puts it succinctly, Jane’s modesty needs not undermine the considerable achievements worthy of the title the Daily Prophet has bestowed upon her as “The Year’s Most Promising Young Herbologist”.
The room was dead silent as the Golden Trio made their way out. It was only when Potter had gone that the other students began moving again. Most of them avoided Draco’s gaze. Zabini didn’t look at him when he left.
Draco arrived late on purpose, thinking that Pansy and Greg will already be here so there won’t be a chance of him being alone with Potter. He sighs. He’ll have to continue waiting outside then. Just as he’s about to leave, Potter turns and spots him.
‘Listen to me,’ Snape said, leaning forward, his voice low. ‘I am trying to help you. I swore to your mother I would protect you. I made the Unbreakable Vow, Draco.’
The great house is silent around them, the house elves having retired for the night and the magical furniture dormant. Narcissa moved back to Malfoy Manor, even though Sirius and Remus wanted her to stay with them at Grimmauld Place; even though she was all alone after Draco disappeared. This is the first time Harry has seen her since Lucius Malfoy’s funeral three months ago.
Potter holds him tighter, leaning in. His face blazes with determination. ‘It doesn’t matter that you are Veela. You’re … you’re important to me, Draco. I want you.’
‘I don’t,’ Draco cut across his words. He turns, backing away until he hits the door, pressing his shaking hands against the solid wood. He blinks, unable to make anything out of the darkness other than a vague black outline of Potter. ‘I don’t need anything from you, Potter. I think you’re imagining things. I don’t look at you in any particular way. I do consider you a friend, yes, because you’re friends with my best friends and we get along, but I don’t – I don’t think of you … in that way.’
Potter looked stricken. He didn’t want to hear Draco’s words, but he was held fast, as if in the embrace of Devil’s Snare.
‘I wish to thank you,’ Malfoy’s upper lip lifts into a sneer, a countenance familiar at last. ‘My deepest gratitude to you for saving me.’
Harry hesitates for a moment, but armed with greater appreciation for his elder sister’s strength, he says, ‘I think Bingley is in London. I met Thomas and Finnigan the other day, and they told me they saw Malfoy at a Muggle theatre, with a group of Muggles. I suspect it might be Bingley and his family.’
It ran in Draco’s nightmares, chasing after him, catching him, bursting through his chest and eating his heart. His sleeping mind knew the truth: Potter would destroy him, would kill him. He could fetch the Death Eaters, bring them into Hogwarts, kill Dumbledore – Potter wouldn’t stop him. Potter would only hunt him down later and personally kill him.
‘Too much?’ Fred is staring at her, enraptured. ‘Hermione, I’ll break into Umbridge’s office to steal that quill for you to destroy. When I succeed, will you go on a date with me?’
“What life? My life as a wizard is over, remember? I’m a Veela now,” Draco said sarcastically, gesturing to his body.
He shrugs again, finally looking up, his eyes unreadable. ‘Which brings me here. I thought it was the bloody perfect excuse to look you up. Stupid of me. I should have known there was a reason you were avoiding me.’
has achieved nothing to earn, and disgust at the manner with which he had regarded everyone else he saw as inferior to himself. Such feelings were strengthened with the rise of that dark order, the “Knights for Freedom”, for which the Malfoy family publicly expressed support and against which Harry and his compatriots spilled blood to oppose.
‘Merlin, I believe I will have to fight for a spot on your card to dance with my own sister,’ Harry says, grinning fondly at his younger sister. ‘Young Creevey will have hurdles to overcome.’
He swallows his mouthful of dry bread and salty ham, and nods and smiles. He’s fine. Sirius calls him the most prepared eight-year-old in Britain, and he will be. He must be stronger, smarter, less of a cry-baby, so that – like Dumbledore tells him – nobody must ever find out that he is omega.
Lucas Norton didn’t seem to have a destination in mind. He wended his way up Diagon Alley, heading in the general direction of Gringotts gleaming white and gold at the end of the street. He entered a bookshop and came out a book-shaped bulge in his coat pocket, and stopped by a bakery for a scone. Harry hung back, knowing that the Charm, which tugged on his wrist like an invisible string, would warn him if Luc tried to run.
Draco discovers the Slytherin alpha by accident. He is taking the long way to the Quidditch pitch to catch the tail-end of Harry’s practice, when he smells a deluge of pheromones. There are a number of alphas besides Neville and Ginny in the other years, but he has never smelt anyone so potent. He is curious enough to cast
– it feels so good!’ Harry gasps, his back arching. ‘Stop, I’m going to cum – not yet. Draco, Draco, let me touch you too.’
Regulus pulls away and smiles sadly. ‘I only ask for my brother’s forgiveness. I did this for him, and no one else.’ And the sky splits away with thunder, noise given form as a blast of white light, and Harry is hurtling away backwards through the darkness, pulling relentlessly along by the red thread.
It took him over two hours creeping along the pitch-black, chilly corridors, eavesdropping on disgruntled and bored Aurors, to find Malfoy’s cell. The air had the stench of grave dirt and despair. His childhood rival sat in the corner of his cell a little larger than a bathroom stall, arms wrapped around his knees, as he stared straight ahead unseeingly. A sliver of cloudy night sky could be seen through the barred slit window set high above.
Harry stares at him. The blonde gentleman has angled his body away from Harry, his fists clenched on his lap. Harry remembers another clenched fist, smaller, younger, catching onto his coat. The words echo in his mind: ‘Do not leave me, Harry. He will kill me.’ Harry looks away and swallows the rest of his drink. The whiskey burns on its way down his throat.
The Healer took one look at Draco’s face, and said to Potter, “You should wait outside, Mr Potter. I need to speak to my patient in private.”
Down in the kitchens, the house elves loaded him up obligingly with food. His former house elf, Dobby, gave him a particularly large pitcher of pumpkin juice with a roguish grin and a ‘You need your energy, Former Young Master Draco.’
But they are running out of ideas on where to find the diadem. Hermione, Ron and Neville have come, with the rest of the Weasleys, a strange family named Lovegood and Cedric Diggory’s parents. Almost no one has anything helpful to add before they peel off to aid the castle’s defenders. It’s the Lovegood girl, who’s in Ginny’s year, who asks in a floaty voice, ‘Well, have you asked the house elves? They have been around for centuries. Nearly as old as the cosmic chameleons living in the Astronomy Tower.’
‘I do not know if you could bring yourself to forgive me. Yet … I have decided to confess that I am deeply in love with you,’ Harry blushes, closing his eyes for fear of bursting into flames; he is too warm in his own skin. ‘For I do love you, Draco. I do not think I deserve to, because I was not strong enough four years ago. I – I abandoned you.’
Dumbledore walks into the kitchen, but hesitates, peering at Minnie, who is watching him with narrowed eyes and pursed lips. Harry, who has received that examination on more occasions than he cares for, winces on Dumbledore’s behalf. Sirius and Moony exchange looks, and Sirius breaks the tensed silence by asking Dumbledore take a seat and grab a plate.
Theo walked to the kitchen, leaving Draco in the short, dingy hallway. Draco had known that Theo was not making much money as a shopkeeper at Flourish & Blotts, but he had not known how little it truly was.
‘You’re not?’ Potter looks up. ‘Why not? It’s cheaper to buy in the long run, isn’t it? Even with the bank loans. If Gringotts is giving you any trouble over loan applications because of – your past, let me know. They can’t discriminate against people like that.’
Harry caught the way Sprout looked at Luc, frowning in puzzlement. Before she could say anything, McGonagall cleared her throat and called the meeting to order. Harry half-listened, the rest of his attention focused on the mysterious Luc.
Three days ago, he had turned the corner and saw, framed by the large empty window, Potter and Ginny Weasley in the courtyard beyond. He knew, of course, that they were going out; there was nothing else people talked of for the past few weeks. Stupidly, like a Clabbert caught by Muggles, he froze. He stood there and looked because he had been avoiding looking at Potter for so long that missing the mere sight of the other boy was a physical ache.
Potter had ripped off his Cloak and was brandishing his retrieved wand from the other side. He was tripping, staggering over to them. The hand clamped tight around Draco’s waist tugged him down the stairs. Snape locked the door behind them, screaming at Draco to
Draco Malfoy scans the silent graveyard, bewildered, unable to think why his ear is burning, why his fingers come away from his neck sticky with blood.
‘I’ve always been told they are inferior,’ Draco said simply. ‘I don’t know what else to think of them. I’ve never spoken to a Muggle and before Hogwarts, all my friends were purebloods or half-bloods.’
It takes them considerably longer to calm down, for Jane is sweet and empathetic, and she feels for her brother too deeply. They speak of the war at length, the barriers finally gone between them. They speak of the ones they lost, and Harry is surprised to see Jane, who has not been able to hear of Mr. Cedric Diggory earlier this year without tearing, smiling fondly as she shares a memory of her deceased fiancé. Jane has been doing her healing too.
‘Mr Ollivander?’ Sirius calls, as they walk up to the counter in the middle, glancing around for the salesperson.
‘How do you know?’ Draco asked without heat, genuinely curious. ‘I have done … terrible things to get what I want. Isn’t this expected of a Slytherin?’
Mother leaps to her feet, wrapping her arms around him. ‘Oh, my love, my love,’ she murmurs, her embrace warm and fierce as he remembers from childhood. ‘You will survive this, you will, my good, strong boy. My Draco.’
It turned out Luna was telling the truth: she had a cousin six times removed from her mother’s side named Lucas Norton, a half-blood. That was all the information Harry could get from Ministry records. If he wanted to confirm the years Luc had spent at Hogwarts, he would have to check the school’s records, which he couldn’t do without explaining to McGonagall and sounding absolutely nuts.
‘Not true,’ Harry said a little quickly. ‘He didn’t.’ He shot a warning glare at Zabini. ‘Malfoy – he wouldn’t do a thing like that. I was with him out of my own free will. That bollocks about a love potion is only that – bollocks.’
Harry makes a face, laughing despite himself. ‘Fine, I’ll give you that. It could be cleaned up a little. Hermione
Sirius’ teeth are gritted, a muscle jumping on his jaw, his nostrils flaring. His right hand is in his pocket, no doubt reaching for his wand. Moony has his hand on Sirius’ arm, his expression an emphatic warning. Minnie looks as discomposed, and she exchanges a glance with Moony. Before they can move, however, someone recognises her and greets her enthusiastically, and while they are stalled, the stout witch from the back of the shop comes hurrying up to them.
Draco screamed, leaping across the echoing chamber to pull Harry away. He sent Quirrell flying with a single swipe of his arm; the man collapsed with a crunch against the far wall and did not move again. Harry, smelling his flesh cooking, tried to tell Draco he was okay, but his tongue was dead in his mouth. His friend frantically ripped his robes apart, pressing his bare palm against Harry’s skin, and so abruptly the pain disappeared, Harry gave a strangled gasp as if anguished.
within Harry. He looks up at Harry, his eyes still searching Harry’s face. Harry instinctively recoils, uncertain if he wants Draco to find the right pebble, but Draco presses down on his hands harder.
‘My life,’ Harry kissed him gently, trailed his lips up Draco’s cheekbones, stopped at his ear. He nipped playfully on Draco’s earlobe.
, behind him, and feels something small, hard and hot strike him on his back. He topples to the ground, unable to move a single muscle.
rather too forcefully, because Draco is always good. As Pansy and he walk away, he hears a lady squeal: ‘Ooh, they will make a lovely pair when they are older!’
had kissed him first, hadn’t he? Rage – hot and charging like a bull – swept through Draco. If Harry had not fucking kissed him, Draco would not have caved. Draco would have maintained his control, and resisted kissing this man he so dearly wanted.
; the words echo in his head. He clenches his fist, the heat from the Veela wand still tingling on his fingertips. Inhaling sharply, he picks it up, and this time, when the wand sears against his palm, he doesn’t drop it. The heat dissipates into gentle warmth that feels almost like a handshake. Harry releases a shaky breath. He could use this wand.
Draco held his daughter, who smelled of a fresh bath, powder, and pancake syrup from the cake-like pinches that she tried to feed him with her fingers. “Eat-eat,” she told him.
When James brought his hands together loudly, Harry jumped. He wasn’t the only one and he saw his father take delight in waking them all up. James lifted a parchment that had begun to glow orange. He waved his wand over it and the parchment’s color returned to normal. He unfolded it and read, “I am legally required to say this. Harry James Potter, you have reached the third tier to your formal betrothal. Gringotts underwriters record your votes at a ninety-five percent approval of all that you’ve heard. Are you still in favor of matrimony to Mr. Draco Lucius Malfoy?”
Draco made a pinched face. “She’s acting weird. Has been all day. She probably thought you weren’t going to get out. Now she’s over doing it.”
“Why would Foster care about your arrest?” A half smile lifted her pretty cheek. “You’re as nervous as a New Year’s goose. Spill. What sorta trouble are you in?”
Draco’s nod was barely perceptible. He tentatively reached for Harry’s arm, but said, “Wait. I can’t leave this mess. I don’t want your family to see this. Can you fix it?”
“If you scare them, they shouldn’t be in your life to begin with.” Draco sounded certain. “Life is too short to go tiptoeing around other people. You have to be yourself. I never want to keep another secret ever again. That’s what I’ve learned.”
“This document will govern his life. If he has to bow to records and archaic laws, he wants to express why. It is an honorable position, both royal and common. He’s choosing his love of people, of clan, over solitary fulfillment. He may exhibit confusion and illness in life, but in this contract, he knows what he wants. And he does not wish to engage in sexual matters merely because he has to, but because he wants to.”
“Look, I love women. I just… there’s someone I been wanting to ask out, and I want to be sure it’s what I want.”
He didn’t want to risk it, not trusting the strength required to survive the warp to his body. He felt like he’d have to lay down beside Iece’s bed and sleep for three days before having sufficient strength to tackle Hogwarts, McGonagall, and that cranky portrait. That didn’t even include whatever Draco had to say.
Harry entered behind her, and could’ve wept for the strange acceptance that washed over him, at seeing Draco asleep under the covers. His pale hair looked so foreign against midnight blue sheets. Especially the way it now fell across his forehead. He almost looked like a normal, average person, in light gray pajamas that revealed something more of his personal tastes. Unlike Harry’s wrinkled PJ’s, when he actually wore them, Draco’s were pressed and smooth, with the monogram, DM on the shirt pocket. A matching robe lay at the foot of the bed. On the other side of his lamp table, a small case of personal items waited for his use when he woke up. In sleep, his face was defenseless. And Harry saw that ‘almost normal’ was apt. There was something about him, like an unopened gift no one suspected, that had a secret allure.
As Foster paraded his peculiar, Victorian tastes, in front of Ash, Ash began to regard the shapes and surfaces he was seeing with keener and keener interest. Especially since he thought he knew what was beneath them and why the layers were necessary. It didn't figure into the first time he'd seen Foster unclothed, but those questions still lacked adequate answers. There was nothing to do but enjoy the show and make himself useful where he could. Indispensable, in fact. Most in the village knew by now, that the white-haired Foster was his uncle by marriage, and the younger, black-haired Foster, on the rare occasion they spied him, was something else to Ash. Something secret, discreet, and charmingly unmentionable in polite company. His gentleman. Ash proved that he could keep village secrets. The village proved that they didn't mind his.
Somewhere during their flight, Draco lost the ability to feel his son. By the time they landed, his arms were empty. Only the christening gown remained. He put his head on Harry’s chest and let him comfort him. Emerald gave them some privacy. She went to see if she could find the dragon and explored the little hut. They all rested for a while, and tried to make sense of everything they’d experienced.
Avi had temporarily paralyzed him to get him to stop. This was why Harry needed a closet whenever his memories tried to reconstruct themselves fully in his thoughts.
The defendants statement is supported by photos of the two of them at social functions, appearing on friendly terms.
Draco sounded like he was repeating himself for the hundreth time. He pinched the bridge of his nose. “Who wouldn’t have an upset stomach with all of this going on? Yes, I made up some bullshit excuse that I wasn’t feeling well enough to eat her damn food. Yes, my stomach is bothering me. Do you see why I want you in one place, right here, where I can see you staying out of trouble? I’ve fucking lost twenty pounds worrying about you and your daughter.”
He'd never bothered to look into the real estate left to him by his father or his God-father. He knew Gringott's held all the documents, but his first priority after the war had been mental stability. He was so used to doing without servants and mansions, he wasn't eager to unearth a past riddled with the murders of his family, no matter how much money lay strewn on its path. He could teach Iece to live without all of that. That was one blessing that came out of his hell with the Dursley's.
If this guy was a muggle with psychic abilities, he wouldn’t see Eileen’s movements, or would he? Could he still read the energy? Harry didn’t want to take the photo home if it had anything to do with the dark cloud that Jerard was speaking of.
Harry woke up cold on his bathroom floor. He couldn't move and he couldn't call for help. His brain still couldn't piece together why he was there. He remembered the pain and the man. It was the worst nightmare he could ever remember, and he wasn't at all certain that it was over. His sore muscles told him that it could all come back at any second and he wouldn't survive it. His body needed time to recover. He had no recollection of getting from the bed to the bath, only the insanity that had held him prisoner in his bed for what seemed like hours. He could only compare it to being locked against the shock of a defibrillator, the way muggles used them on TV. Only worse. A million times worse. Before he lost consciousness again, he thanked god that his daughter was safe with Draco.
Rankar’s optimism would not be daunted. “While unconsciousness has been induced, I suggest you use this evening to rest with her. We have chairs that convert to beds. We’ll make you as comfortable as we can. For the next twenty-four hours, it’s observation only. If she has no more episodes, we’ll consider releasing her with short-term, prescription strength suppressants. But that’s not a solution, especially for a child so young. That will simply let you take her home without flare ups from her magic. In theory. Sometimes we have to use trial and error before we find the medicine that works for her. There will be potion supplements as well.”
“Maybe it did. It all depends on how you look at it. Did you succumb to a curse or did you merely catch it in your web and mistake ownership for affliction? How much does a teenager know about all that she will become? All that he already is, and all that she can do, before it’s shown to her? You don’t know how many lives you’ve had, you only know your seventeen years have left you unprepared for the attack when it happened. Magic invents answers, Harry, it doesn’t ask the intellect for a handy little cheat sheet. Now let me inside that noggin of yours so that I can help you find Severus.”
He stood speechless. Not because he didn’t know what to say, but because he knew that Harry would never forgive him for being as phenomenally rude to her, as he wanted to be at that moment.
James didn't give a damn. It was never about hurting Snape. It was about getting his goddamn attention. It was about not being ignored by him. This was a powerful fucking wizard, and all he wanted, was to shatter Snape's quiet control and make him see that he could be his equal. But no, Snape had to look down his nose at everyone. Snape had to keep his distance, like he didn't want to blemish those beautiful, spell-black robes with the likes of them.
So Harry understood that he was either dead or dying too. In the water, he saw Snape's reflection draw closer as it bent down to him.
Even before he put his glasses back on, he knew that had come out wrong. The crease in her brow said ‘Damn right it did.’
That’s right. His baby. Back to her. That’s what all of this was about, and not mentioning her, not speaking her name, was what felt so horrible. Let’s talk about her. We have to find out what’s going on.
And what the fuck happened to his arm? And where the hell was Snape? He quickly shoved those questions back down. Just holding that hard rubbery thing that used to be his arm, spliced his stomach with something like chilled razors, and he wasn’t ready to look full on it.
His parents knew that he would, left on his own, present a lackluster image, which they could do nothing about. They’d discussed letting the Malfoys see what they were really getting. No point in hiding who Harry was behind glamour. Harry’s insistence on a “regular Joe” appearance had them poised to argue the point that his quality lay in his person, not his clothing. They knew the Malfoys, conservatively dressed to the height of their wealth, would see his lack of refinement as a strike against them. But Harry’s magic was far older, and far more potent than theirs. They would not be intimidated into thinking their family did not bring as much to the table as the Malfoys, if not more.
He came from wizards who wanted to put their worlds together in any way they chose, unsanctioned by those who feared magic and didn't possess it in equal measure.
Through the layers of her bio-energies, she was having a storm of imbalances, but her magic was also learning as it dodged it’s own firestorm. Harry’s magic had shown a similar pattern when layers were peeled back to expose the circuitry that connected him to his wheels of life. Because of their genetic symbiosis, she was actually bearing some of his trauma, his panic, and helping him to dissipate it. A child that young had no business processing that kind of thick, dense energy. But her conscious mind was so light and empty of suffering, that she was too naive to fear it the way an adult would fear it.
Lucius chuckled. “I’m merely here in an administrative capacity. I don’t want to see you punished anymore than anyone else. The ones back here, they’re calling the shots.” He pointed to the shadowed people sitting behind him. They were not there when the table first appeared, and they appeared to peek out at them as if in mid-conversation with one another.
“He doesn’t know all of that, but that’s what happened. Now he’s simply following what he knows. Corruption and danger. He will keep himself busy with that until you help him see that he doesn’t have to fight anymore.”
His father, Lucius, had the same color hair, and it didn’t make Harry feel good. It made him feel unsafe. That a completely different mind could mimic the quality of something he loved, and not be the thing he loved. Sure, he hadn’t gotten along with Draco in the beginning. It takes time to get used to constantly being confronted with something you haven’t yet learned is vital to you, and that’s why it gets under your skin. You aren't sure that it's really yours and that you can have it. That’s why you can’t stop staring at it. That’s why you stalk it.
“Harry, nobody cares about her hair. They’re interested because she’s our daughter. And as far as they know, your only vulnerability. No matter what color you dye her hair, that will be who the crowd is looking for. Don’t put her through that.”
That sounded off, but Harry didn’t want to make things worse. He turned back to Iece and bent to kiss her. It pleased him to see that the necklace talisman he’d given her was still there. Her coloring had returned to normal and she responded to his touch by turning her head into his hand. Good, she’d broken free of the medicated sleep. He was tempted to wake her on purpose, but decided not to rush it. If she stayed awake all night, then he’d play with her.
Lucius' point of view. Draco has a sleep over. That wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't thirty-eight and still obsessed with Harry, much to Lucius' regret.
“Your body knows what sexual indulgence feels like. It’s accustomed to it. You have some experience. Virgins tremble when they’re this close to someone who wants them. You haven’t been completely honest.”
Draco slowly walked out into the dim room and cautiously peered at the three seated at Hermione’s table. If there was something he needed to know, if he needed to take his daughter from this place where they weren’t welcomed and he’d been a fool to think that Hermione had the confidence to raise her, he needed to know that tonight.”
Harry shoved him away. “I’m not doing fine, I’m fucked up. I was drugged and hexed. The drug was just a band-aid. It’s still working, or I’d be ripping out your father’s throat right now.”
They sat in the sun. Draco still looked shaken, so Emerald turned to Harry. “Why aren’t we out of this yet?”
“That’s because you’ve been used to survival and the world of action and struggle. If you go into any other alternate reality from this one, those rules change. Hell, they change anyway, but you’ll really notice if you get there. Fighting, kicking in doors, manipulating with action and force, keep you chained to unending effort. Effort works in the lower worlds, but problems also arise in those same worlds. All your issues came from people struggling to gain the upper hand, whether harm was inflicted upon you, or whether you did it to others. And that’s the world you know. Love looks like flimsy, ineffective feelings to you, because it’s so far reaching, the world of action can’t comprehend it. It’s everywhere at once, while effort and taking action, can only be in any one place at a time.
After a tense moment, during which he felt like an arse for letting his new teammates stare at him without an introduction, Abria motioned, "Come with me."
Harry had overheard Admiral Bicksby telling one of the other wizards, "Just when they think they've mapped the site, someone calls in more bits much further away. It's starting to look like magic was involved rather than non-magical explosives."
Draco looked ill. He shook his head. “Those are horrible tests. It’s different for people who can bear children, than it is for you.” He looked at Harry, then to his father. “You said I’d never have to endure that violation ever again. You promised.”
“You’re fantasizing,” Harry told himself. He knew he was. He had a right to. All this perfection beside him, in his bed even, and he couldn’t even give it an innocent kiss.
“Hey, nothing. To really be free of you, is to walk out of here feeling no obligation to you whatsoever. And right now, that’s all I feel. I tried to apparate out. Your house wouldn’t let me. Your magic is very coercive.”
Foster leaned into is weight before letting his attention resurface. For one beautiful second, he looked as if he might take a seat. Then, "I'm leaving. If there's something you want for your troubles, you should specify it now."
He’d been fighting it, not really wanting to encourage Harry’s trust in their circumstances. But he was unable to resist the atmosphere of gratitude that Harry brought back into their home. It was as if the fight that Harry had with his father, really had changed something, shifted some old blockage, and now things seemed to be flowing again. On the one hand, it felt eerily soothing. On another, it made him nervous. If he stayed home today, he knew that Iece would be put down for her nap in the afternoon, and they’d make love while she slept. Now was not the time to feed Harry’s hopes of a lasting reunion.
“Any wizard likely to be killed or kidnapped by your friends, must surely know what he’s done to piss them off long before I got involved. They should already have protective measures in place. And speaking of which, this organization seems to harbor you only because you’ve promised Harry to them. I realize you’ve joined them only because they can afford your security, however, your concern for your fellow wizards are disgustingly hypocritical, even for you.”
Todrick's voice was rough. "Are you accusing Gringotts of accepting bribes to aid in deceiving the entire magical world that Severus Snape is dead? That is beyond arrogant, even for you. While you are no doubt very reverent when it comes to matters of your fallen teacher and hero, we at Gringotts adhere to professionalism. We do not give in to sentiment and we will not allow you to insult our ethics."
You know that these types of fantasies are therapy in its truest form. Healing emotions. As long as there is a “real world” to have to contend with, you will need fics like these, to soothe your soul. For you, taking time to comment, to recall something wonderful that the writer inspired you to feel, is equivalent to planting a tree. You plant the seed. You feed a writer’s inspiration. You do this in hopes that you will always be able to find a great story when you need it. Your comment says, more than anything, “I took the time to read it, I’m glad you took the time to write it.”
Hermione covered her mouth as she watched Harry on her television. The anchor woman was going on about a strange viral video, where two men appeared out of no where and engaged in a vicious battle, which both miraculously survived, for over twenty minutes, before mysteriously vanishing in front of eyewitnesses. More footage was surfacing, revealing unsettling clues and other phenomena, regarding the incident.
“Right now, I feel like our whole problem has been running away from this and fighting it. When life jumps a level, if we don’t jump with it, we fall off, we lose our balance. But if we can look at all the bullshit and keep going, no matter what, we keep our balance. I hate what they did to us, but I love feeling like myself again. This is just a taste. That kid your father brutalized, was hiding inside of me this whole time. Now he knows it’s safe for him to come back out. He knows he’s strong enough to face it. He knows he’s strong enough to take care of everyone he loves, or die trying. I’m finding my way back to myself. I just feel so much relief from real fucking problems, that a vagina is hardly worth getting stressed out about compared to being present right here and now.”
Draco felt stupid, like he was being asked to play make-believe. His hope took a hit, and he struggled to simply do as he was told.
What he didn't expect was the round of applause this announcement got. It brought his eyes up from the their shoes. Eight men, six women, including the coach, gave him relieved smiles along with solid, hand-slapping appreciation. He heard the words, "Awesome to meet you, Mr. Potter." His own relief stunned him.
The silhouette is what stopped him. It always did. Foster was standing in his favorite place. His coat was anvil dark, and just as heavy, against lace drapes that glowed with morning light around him. He kept his back to Ash, who stepped cautiously into the room.
“Children are our only escape from being everything and everyone, every second of a timeless existence. Children are the only way we can walk on those feats of engineering that you call, feet. We must have them. Before you were born, you were one of us. You said, ‘let me go first. That way, I can guarantee you a child. Someone else may not do that. You said you’d prepare one for us. You said you’d give birth to it yourself. You said it was ours. And we could all enjoy flowing our magic through it. You made us dream. We dreamt such a lovely little body. Perfect for having a great life. That doesn’t mean happy, but that does mean adventure. Our magic is the very definition of happy, so we sign up for roles that make us cry, for the entertainment value.
He shook his head. “No. Not really. We had a rotunda like this, but the place was really beautiful. Musicians went their to be inspired as well as to learn. This kinda feels like it, but there was no forest right outside our doors. I don’t know what I’m expected to do. He said he’d tell me.”
She picked up a silver jewelry box, knowing that only her childhood costume jewelry was in it. She didn’t need a spell for this, just a point of contact. Inside, the mood ring she’d bought for pennies when she was twelve, showed its black dome to her. The memory of how the wizard she was about to call, transformed it from a bend-to-fit toy, to a sterling band and the clearest quartz, drowned out her husband’s objections. She and her friend had been fourteen when he displayed his transfiguration abilities to her. James never trusted him, and spoke unkindly about how his family still held connections to the old ways. The illegal ways.
“Then you’re going to kill me. I know your work, Severus. Voldemort took to you for a reason. Don’t forget that I shared rank with you and saw what you did to earn his favor. I may have lost my mind, literally, but I haven’t forgotten how good you are with your hands. Slight of hand, I should say.”
He could’ve manifested the glass of water, already. He would’ve. But his magic remained distracted by the magic rolling off of Harry and his son.
“Mmm…” Iece liked it so much, she stretched her tongue to lick as much as she could from the smears on her face. Her cheese fell to the floor, forgotten.
He couldn’t be bothered to tear his attention from Draco, but he knew she had a point. It took less than a minute to disprove it. He thought of going to his bedroom across the hall.
“They’re just fake lenses now. No prescription. I’m not ready to look at you without them. It’s too startling.”
Earth lives look so tempting when you’re above them. Cake looks amazing when you have no body to taste it with, but can feel the joy that went into making it. Your longing to join a race that makes such beautiful, delicious things, is overwhelming.
What else did his dream want to give him? The want had no more formed in his mind than he reached for the protuberance sleeping in the boy's shorts. He gauged and measured the qualities of it with his hand. As he did, the first stirrings of real interest spread, infusing him with authentic arousal. As Harry stirred, knocking his hand away in his sleep, Lucius got creative.
“Jipsy is hoping that Sir will come to see her vault like he promised, now that Jipsy is finished. There are many treasures that you should see.”
Her open eyes saw nothing external, but internally, she squinted. “It’s a bit strange. Your mother gives me a clear view of his face, but he snatches it away. He’s performing magic. I think… I’ve never seen this before. He’s not like the rest of the people around you. As I’ve said, he’s not dead. No one really is, but he’s very much a part of our world. In fact, he walks in both worlds, and that isn’t usually done. He is influencing what I can tell you. He’s hiding information. This man is not telling me who he is and he’s blocking my view. He must be very powerful to be able to do that. At a certain level in spirit, there are no secrets.”
They could both remember a time when that conversation would’ve turned their stomachs. But experience had forced maturity upon them. When you have no other options, you deal with it, and it becomes your path. Most young men cringe at the thought of graphic childbirth, but change their minds when their own offspring are about to be born. Ironically, the same qualities that make something a miracle, are exactly the same qualities that people have trouble allowing in their normal observation. They’ve had over two years to let disgust move on to something else. Frankly, there was too much else to worry about than bodies that accommodated their every sexual whim.
“Don’t worry, Mr. Potter. Your former professor is in hiding because he wants to be. Not because he’s a criminal. His name was sufficiently cleared during the trials and his
“And let Harry and Draco suffer indefinitely?” She shook her head. “This isn’t about you and your fears. Our son-in-law needs help. You know as well as I do, that he’s our best hope.”
Even he didn’t sound convincing to himself. Malfoy’s body, so close to his, emitted something he hadn’t felt in two years. His blood heated in response. He’d been celibate that long, and it probably showed. Some people were predatory like that, only interested in the ones who wanted nothing to do with them.
It took another second before he made up his mind. Eileen put down the hoop and nestled her baby against her. She kept her eyes on Harry.
“Not if she knew what you were thinking.” Draco sat up. His hair stood in thick tufts, where he’d wallowed, unable to sleep for listening to Harry and Jipsy for the last hour.
After he saw her eyes, staring so deeply into that grey wrongness, that unnatural icy silver, events bled together like spreading pools of color. Draco pulled her out of Harry’s reach. Hermione’s and Ron’s panicked voices inflamed his loss of control. And all of his friends, using hands to restrain him, smeared those last few minutes into chaos and blame. They kept him from grabbing Iece and he hated them all for it. Here it was. The judgment. The unfit father stigma hiding behind their polite friendship all these years. He had every right to be freaked out by what he saw, but the way they were backing away from him, pulling him away from Draco, who ran with Iece for the stairs, admitted what they really thought. He was still crazy from the war. From his secrets, and ultimately no help to his daughter or to Draco. He felt helpless enough at witnessing such a horrific transformation in her. Keeping her out of his reach, only infuriated him more.
“Great blazes, Harry! We’ve been looking for you.” Vector Banks slapped Harry’s shoulder and made a stern face. “Lords, you look positively awful. Another day in the hospital wouldn’t have hurt you. We can’t have you running around looking like we’re neglecting you.”
He’s not strong enough. Harry’s brain objected to what it saw as he strained to pick himself up. Against all reason and logic, Draco’s angular shoulders punctured a place for itself, taking the rest of the glass with it. His entire body dashed, transformed by his speed and determination, to be free of that room. He  flowed like liquid, through an opening that should’ve cut him to pieces and stopped his flight.
Draco grimaced. The practice of committing their ancestry to memory, was an interest he no longer shared with her. Who cares who came before you, he wanted to scream at her. It doesn’t give you points. You still have to figure out your own way. You’re here, deal with it. Stop using the excuse of your dead relatives to justify your existence. All of us could’ve just as easily come through some nameless peasant in Albania. Can you love life, and who you are, anyway? That’s all you need.
This is a fantasy, he told himself. He tried to kill you with that thing. Now you’re in the hospital, probably on some morphine drip to control the pain, and you’re still dreaming of him. That didn’t stop him going giddy with anticipation as Draco’s body blocked the sun and bent close. In the cool of that shadow, Harry kept his eyes open as long as he could, to make sure he was really seeing Draco lean in to kiss him. Draco was taller, and that only made his smooth lips more exciting as they descended on him. Harry tried to memorize every pink crease, the fine down of surface hairs, and even pores when he couldn’t find a blemish to hang his memory onto. He knew the kiss would destroy him, and he had to let it.
"They are. All thirty-one show rapid tissue growth and traces of complex magic, though Harry's treatment is the most complete. It's as if the rest were treated in haste. The most life-threatening injuries were tended to, but secondary wounds were left alone. I don't want to underestimate the locals, but there's no registered wizard on record, within a hundred kilometers of the crash site, qualified to administer such treatment. On the other hand, the area is quite rural and cut off. Villagers are reputed to be self-reliant and very good at minding their own business. That usually means they still have ties to an old network of Pre-Christian Paganism. A skilled witch or wizard could make themselves useful among them."
Malfoy’s skin was so fair, it was easy to see his blood rise to the surface of his skin. Harry’s eyes followed it as it moved up his abdomen, rolling up each muscle group until it splotched his chest. His eyes closed and his cheeks went scarlet as he rode out the flow of his climax.
“I need to know if you’re going to be okay. I nearly killed your father. I tried to, and I walked away from breaking almost every Wizarding law I know. You’re too calm. Am I going to wake up with a knife in my chest or what?”
Harry felt his eyes. A gasp escaped him. He looked at his old glasses as if he didn’t know what to do with them.
Sick with the inability to deny what he saw, he shook his head at the new limbs. They lay, unapologetic and real and pulsing. It wasn't just the sight of seeing new, flesh and blood, limbs where there hadn't been any before. It was having the new skin outlined for him. It was as if the tissue contained liquid light running through its newly formed vascular structures, and appeared lighter in tone than the rest of him. It was like seeing magic learn to be blood and learn to be bone. Ash was seeing the magic as it learned to come to life and to blend smoothly with the boy's other functions. He'd seen Foster's magic before, but not like this. Not come to life and thriving in complete imitation of human biology. He removed the sheet completely. Translucent, frosty skin covered the rib damage and the entire abdominal area. Paper thin white toes, told him that the boy had also been missing a foot.
been a unit, but he was too slow, and Draco had to come for him first. He shakes his head a little, regretting the last glass of mead now. Godric, he’s doing a bang-up job of coming home, isn’t he?
‘I … I don’t want you to go,’ Potter says again, simply, clearly. He looks up and his eyes are hard, gleaming emeralds. ‘Don’t go. Stay here.’
His distraction was obvious enough that Potter asked him, point-blank, ‘You’re worrying about it, aren’t you? What Voldemort has you doing.’
Draco feels a prickle of hope, only to be doused in a second. Oh, but even if Harry is furious because he
Voldemort stood at the bottom of the stairs sweeping up to the second floor, his great dirty snake Nagini curled around his shoulders. Aunt Bellatrix stood to Voldemort’s left, her face twisted with madness, eyes fixed to the forms in front of her master. His parents knelt at Lord Voldemort’s feet.
But Harry loathes the suppressant potion more than Snape. It makes him feel weak, the energy draining from his limbs. It is bad enough that the strongest manifestation of his magic is his ability to fly, and he does not show the spontaneous spurts of magic his books say children his age should be experiencing. The day after he took the potion for the first time, he could not even get the broom off the ground, and Sirius had to hold him for hours before he calmed down.
He is the reason Draco moves like he is wounded, and looks like a jagged piece of metal waiting to score flesh. He didn’t feel a whit of pain when he died—it was Draco, the living half, who bore the mortal wound of his soul being torn by Harry’s death. Even if he contemplates the darkness of a world where Draco is dead, it doesn’t compare to what Draco felt when his soulmate died—the anguish he suffered for a bond he could not consciously choose.
‘My ma was a great cook, she taught me how to cook. I baked these muffins, have some, Potter, they’re good. I do rather well with pot roast too. That’s Zabini’s favourite. He thinks I should carry on with the restaurant once he gets the sanctions on Knockturn lifted. Millie – Millicent Bulstrode – has a shop here too; her parents sold herbs and they broke now because they can’t do business. They don’t sell anything
. It’s the physical expression of a body that no longer recognises the magic – or lack thereof – in Draco’s blood. He always feels like ants are swarming beneath his skin, and nothing – not potions, creams or Muggle pills – can stop it. The scratching leaves ugly scabby scars, but at least the sharp pain is better than the incessant prickling.
‘Well, I don’t wonder that they keep quiet about it, hearing the way we go on about them for being born in a gender they couldn’t choose,’ Hermione says indignantly. ‘That’s a filthy thing to say, Ron.’
Potter gasps, his body stiffening, and Draco inadvertently echoes him, his hand flying to his face, when he feels the heavy ghost of a sharp pain slice across his forehead.
Dinner passes cheerily enough. Bingley and his sisters are delighted with Jane’s conversation, effusive in their responses to her. Lizzy is seated across from Darcy, to her dismay, but next to Zabini and Parkinson, which seems to please her. She spends most of the dinner in riveting conversation with the pair. This leaves Harry with Malfoy, a development he does not mind so much after his apology at Sir William’s party those weeks ago. He is still baffled as to any real acceptance of it on Malfoy’s end, but their interactions that have come to pass are easy enough to assuage Harry’s concerns.
‘I’m afraid that’s not how it works, Harry,’ the Minister said sombrely. ‘He has continued to support Voldemort, even after he came of age. He was already a legal adult when he fought against us in the Battle of Hogwarts – as were you. We must hold him accountable for his harmful actions, no matter how sorry he might be now.’
Harry shakes his head, seeing the way Draco clenched his fists. ‘Well, it’s too bad you don’t have this then,’ he says wryly, gesturing to his lightning-shaped scar. ‘The Dark Lord will mark him? Thanks for the offer, mate, but I’ll be happy enough if you clean up the room once in a while.’ They are sharing a room now that there are more people in the house.
Dumbledore has an idea for a hiding place Voldemort would favour—something about his time in the orphanage. He brings Snape along to investigate. Minnie would have gone, but the Headmaster tells her she would have to run the school in his absence. She looks alarmed. ‘For Merlin’s sake, it is only one night!’ she exclaims.
The gentleman inclines his head in acknowledgement of Lizzy’s praise. There is the slightest hint of a smile on his face – an expression that gives Harry some pause. It seems that the gentleman has quite a reversal in opinion of Lizzy from their first encounter at the Meryton ball. Malfoy confirms this as much when their party have retired to the drawing room. Lizzy is playing the piano with Parkinson, laughing gaily at Zabini’s quips. Darcy, while engaged in conversation with Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst, is frequently glancing curiously in her direction.
Seamus shrugs. ‘There’s that. I reckon we’ll have to, if we want,’ he says flippantly, glancing at Dean. ‘It’s a bit hard on the omegas then, innit? If alphas don’t want them for mating, who will? I’ve heard that it’s a lot of trouble, dealing with their heat every month—sounds like some sort of illness.’
Potter’s nose broke, the blood splattering everywhere. Potter’s eyes rolled in pain. Something within Draco wrenched painfully. He ignored it, bending down to yank the Cloak out from under Potter. He threw it over Potter and the bloodied gallant hero disappeared.
Draco was frozen, trapped by Potter’s gaze, his skin screaming in pain where Potter’s wand burned him. He couldn’t think, his thoughts slipping out from under his grasp, slimy as troll snot.
Had Potter made it? Was Draco underestimating the Boy Wonder’s intelligence all along? Perhaps Granger had a hand in this. Still, the parchment seemed genuinely old, older than them even.
? If my soul is yours, like you say, does it matter the flesh it comes with? Does your soul not matter more?"
‘Don’t you see, Harry? If you want to talk about forcing, or laying traps, or manipulation, lay those crimes at my door. I would gladly take another three years on Azkaban if that means I can have
‘Don’t be naïve, Potter,’ Draco said in his most pompous drawl. ‘You don’t care about me. You’re only trying to rationalise this in your head. I know what you’re thinking, “This is Malfoy and he is a pureblood supremacist. He’s called my best friend a Mudblood, he’s called my other best friend a blood traitor. He’s tried to get me into trouble countless of times. He’s loathsome and I hate him.”’
They walked into the Great Hall, where the four long tables sat shiny and empty beneath the floating candles. Harry looked up, still awed by the sight of the enchanted ceiling. The last time he had seen it, the ceiling was bare stone and cracked in several places. Luna had said that it took Flitwick a month to figure out the ancient charm.
, Draco, your mother is all alone now. What, you do remember these people, don’t you, boys? Of course, you don’t—the two of you have been too fucking wrapped up in yourselves. So, you sacrificed yourself for us, Harry—but you decide now that you don’t care for us?’
Harry opens his mouth – to tell him to come in? To say sorry for being such a prat? – but Draco turns and walks away. Harry lets his head fall back onto his bed, biting back a groan and swallowing the words he doesn’t think he could say anyway. He was lying, and Draco knows, of course, but Harry doesn’t think he can get through a dinner alone with Draco tonight without the image of Draco’s naked arse popping into his head frequently. It will be very uncomfortable trying to hide his hard-on.
Draco could have wept—and laughed at the final state of the boy who once thought sex filthy, who believed he would never descend to such unholy depths with his beloved Harry.
Potter had remembered this little throwaway comment Fortescue had made about Draco. Draco’s heart leapt, and he had to remind himself that
‘It is well and good that you wizards are so eager to raise our children. This child will not be easy to raise,’ the female warns. ‘He is an alpha who bears the mark of a soul-bond; he has a soulmate. Alphas like this are terribly powerful, but also unstable. Bear this in mind, especially if he must be around omegas.’
Draco, on the other hand, took malicious pleasure in taking the piss at Potter’s expense whenever he could. All the better if he could get Potter to blush – which he had, many times over. Potter never retaliated, though his pet Weasleys were quick to draw their wands and call Draco – rather unimaginatively – a wanker and a tosspot. Granger defended Potter in her own way, by delivering stinging criticism of anything he said in class – and to his chagrin, she was right more often than not.
‘You tell anyone, Malfoy, and I’m going to pulverise you,’ Potter said quietly, his threat heavy in every word.
Draco spent the rest of the day in the Room, feverishly working on the Cabinet, ignoring his classes. He was close, he knew it, he was close to figuring out the linking spell. Once he knew it, it would be simple enough to fix the corruption and to cast the spell anew. The Cabinet would be fixed, his parents would be saved, and the Dark Lord would be happy because the Death Eaters would have a direct route into the impregnable heart of the wizarding world.
He falls onto all fours, gagging and coughing, as the smell thick as molasses wraps around him. Eyes watering, he clamps his hands over his nose, sucking in breath through his mouth, but that is
‘I know the prophecy tells us that you will be the one to kill Voldemort,’ he continues, his voice cold, ‘but are you that deluded to think that you must bear the responsibility for every evil Voldemort and his Death Eaters commit? Who do you think you are, Harry? Merlin himself? Being the subject of
‘This is the wand for me?’ Harry asks anxiously, staring at the wand on the counter, its tip smoking slightly.
‘What about you, Draco?’ Seamus eyes him with interest. ‘You’ve dated the most out of all of us. Were they all betas?’
He turns, frowning, and catches sight of Harry in the doorway. A rapid succession of emotions flit across his thin, pale face: surprise, distress, anger, and finally, embarrassment. He bows smartly in greeting. Harry returns the gesture, and closes the door before walking further into the room. Malfoy stands still, wariness in his expression now. He watches Harry as might a caged dragon.
Harry hesitates. How does he resume a conversation that started when they were kids? If Draco has heard from his mother the bargain Harry struck with the Ministry, he must know the truth of Harry’s visits – and he must hate Harry for lying. He has thought of confessing – been tormented by it – but he did not, so that is a moot point now.
Draco’s heart was twisting in his chest. He clutched the front of his robes, feeling as if he was being ripped apart.
He doesn’t want to see Draco, who has sneaked out of the dormitory to visit him at night. His other friends have realised early on he doesn’t like the fuss, after the few times this happened in their first year. The official diagnosis entirely fabricated by Sirius is magical trauma, caused by his stay with his abusive Muggle relations, which relapses once in a while.
‘That is not the impression I meant to give, for it is not true,’ the gentleman replies. ‘I have learned from experience that it does me no favours to stand in the way of a person single-minded in her quest. My opposition will only serve to send her away from me, thinking that she could seek no help on this end. I wish only to prevent that.’
Harry watches him surreptitiously. The other boy still looks sickly, his face colourless as milk, shadows under his eyes like faded ink. He winces when he moves too suddenly, his shoulders drawing up to his ears. It has only been a few days since he left St Mungo’s Hospital, where he has been recovering for a week from the unknown curse Voldemort cast at him.
They were out on the lawn, the night dark as pitch around them. Draco could hear the half-giant oaf roaring in fury. A jet of red light fired over their heads. Snape spun around, growled, ‘
‘Ah, so it’s your soulmate still keeping you alive. Yes, I suspect that you’ll be able to return, because you came down here with more than one soul. I think the afterlife would take the fragment of the Dark Lord’s as sufficient to maintain the world’s balance.’
get any robes from Twilfitt and Tatting’s after she had declared that he would? It was sheer pureblood pig-headedness. As if Potter, Weasley and Granger would notice!
The shirt slips off and his arms are bare. Harry catches his breath, his eyes locked on the spider web of half-healed scabs and old scars on Draco’s arms. Draco continues undressing, pushing his trousers down together, revealing the network of scars curling down Draco’s legs.
Draco was never going to see Harry again. The knowledge thrummed through him, hot and certain, and Draco thought his heart would shatter under Theo’s next punch. He had so stupid, trying to be noble like Harry, resisting the way the man had practically thrown himself at him. He should have taken the chance when he had it.
‘My poor cousin,’ she retorted, turning her head and inadvertently whipping him in the face with her thick braid.
Draco got to his feet, shoving his chair back with a screech, picking up his satchel as well. ‘Let’s go,’ he said without looking at Umbridge.
"Well, aren't you lucky I'm the one harvesting the vegetables for dinner tonight, your majesty," Eltanin smirks. "There are poisonous herbs amongst these weeds."
He shook his head, bewildered. He looked down at his short, skinny frame, all elbows and knees despite having at least two servings every meal. He has read the histories of the greatest wizarding heroes: Merlin, the four founders of Hogwarts, Hengist of Woodcroft, and Newt Scamander. Even Dumbledore himself, who defeated the Dark wizard Grindelwald. Harry wanted to laugh at the idea of
Draco looks back out of the window at Harry Potter; the other boy is now walking down the platform with his godfathers, looking around with a wide grin brilliant against his dark skin, seemingly unaware of the looks and whispers he is attracting. His black hair is an absolute mess of curls, and the laces of one of his trainers are coming undone. Draco cannot imagine a more unlikely candidate as the bearer of dark powers greater than the Dark Lord’s that his parents are inventing.
It took only a moment before Dumbledore’s piercing blue eyes swung in Draco’s direction. ‘Ah, Draco …’ Dumbledore sounded slightly disappointed, the patronising old git.
He whimpers when Harry kisses his neck, lips nipping at his skin, hot breath shuddering against him.
Sirius had explained with amused disdain: ‘He used to fancy your mum. Wasn’t very happy when she fell for your dad. It’s idiotic that he has decided he must hate you too. Don’t worry, Harry, it’s not your fault.’ Moony sighed and added with caution: ‘Snape and us – we weren’t on good terms when we were at Hogwarts. It’s a lot more complicated that Sirius makes it out to be, I promise. We did him wrong too.’
’ Snape shrieked and the force of his spell blasted Jackson well across the cell, slamming him into the wall.
way because he’s with Dean, but – but I don’t mean you’re not like – that people can’t like you that way – I just – I mean – I mean … I don’t know what I mean …’ Potter trails off, looking miserable, his face a brilliant red. He looks down, running a hand through his hair.
‘Snape would know best I suppose,’ Potter said thoughtfully. ‘Dumbledore really trusts him though and that is enough for our side.’
The shop is empty, just like the first time they came. Draco takes another step forward, tasting the fetid air and—awareness spears him in the chest like a rampaging wild unicorn. He chokes, inhaling another half-breath of that cloyingly sweet scent, and staggers backwards. His knees buckle, and he barely catches himself on the doorway.
‘Harry was starving, so we started dinner earlier,’ Sirius explains, raising his eyebrows at Harry, who is on his second helping. ‘You’re lucky he left some roast for you.’
behaving like a complete brat? He scowled at his reflection. He had to admit that the robes were nice, even if the expense was completely unnecessary.
Harry flushes, hotly denying having a crush. Sirius, amused by his reaction, teases him until Remus puts a stop to it by bringing out the pudding. Later, Draco wonders if there is anything to Sirius’s insinuations. He is lying on his side in Harry’s double bed next to him, their hands clasped loosely between them. Harry is curled up on his side, facing him, face relaxed in sleep. The heavy dinner and suppressant potion have pulled him quickly into sleep.
She pulled back, smirked at the look on Draco’s face, and pulled her gobsmacked boyfriend towards the fireplace. Potter glanced between Draco and Hermione, looking as stupefied as Draco.
‘Yeah?’ Harry raises his eyebrows. ‘Then you’d know I’m fucking in love with you.’ He steps closer, slipping his arms around Draco’s waist. Draco shudders again at the touch of Harry’s hands on his bare skin.
Regret twisted in Draco’s chest, exquisite in its pain, like a glass splinter had grown in his heart. He had so wanted the last thing he saw to be Harry Potter. He looked at his lover’s greatest enemy and knew that Harry Potter would eventually prevail. He could win this war.
He is still screaming, yes, but he is screaming in protest, in fury, in defiance. The man is lowering his pants, and Draco is so repulsed, he feels his disgust exploding out of him in an uncontrollable wave.
The first-years gather in front of the teachers’ table, huddled around a stool topped with a worn, rumpled wizard’s hat. Draco finds himself right next to Harry, close enough for their sleeves to brush, which is why he is the only one who notices when Harry grimaces, his hand flying to his temple. The dark-haired boy looks up sharply, his troubled eyes scanning the teachers’ table and stopping on a skinny man with straggly greasy hair. Draco can guess who that professor is—Snape, the ingrate who turned his back on Draco’s parents.
Down in the Great Hall and spilling out onto the lawn, the Hogwarts Christmas Ball was in full swing. Harry had seen McGonagall glide through the room, smiling with great satisfaction at the sight of her students, future, present and past, and their families mingling with ease and gaiety. It was good to see her smile like that.
beating in time with his heart—they found this creature somehow, and would hurt him, use him against Eltanin, these enemies to Slytherin. He needs to protect him.
Draco studies the closed double doors in front of him. The dark wood is carved with magical creatures: a dragon roaring fire above stony cliffs; Ashwinder and sea serpents slithering along the edge; Hippogriffs and Hippocampi cavorting in hills and lakes. He begins to look for Veelas, but the doors open before he could find one. His father stands in the doorway, looking down at him in surprise.
‘Your praise is inconceivable with regards to me,’ Jane replies with a chuckle. ‘I am hardly so talented a Herbologist that my lack of a presence will make any difference to our kind. I dare not even own the title!’
At the lake, Draco finds himself inexplicably in the same boat as Potter, Granger, Longbottom and Weasley – this, despite the fact that since Longbottom and Weasley come from wizarding families (and ancient pureblood lines at that), they must have heard something about the Malfoys. Draco pretends not to notice the way Pansy Parkinson is pointing at him from the other boat, whispering to the people around her.
“This reporter wonders if the Boy Who Lived Twice will live through this humiliation and betrayal. Doesn’t our strapping, handsome Saviour deserve a happy ending? Or is he tragically doomed to be betrayed by the women around him (refer to this reporter’s article for the 1994 Triwizard Tournament on our young hero’s failed relationship with an enchanting, talented young Muggle-born)?”
those feelings are, but they cannot be appropriate when he finds himself struck dumb by how lovely he thinks his best mate.
She wraps her arms around him. He leans into her embrace gratefully, but no longer feels the urge to cry.
Draco cannot find Harry anywhere. They have taken him away, and left a letter they say Harry wrote. Draco rips it, and sets it on fire. There is nothing Harry can say that he wants to hear.
, aren’t I; Salazar alone knows why I even am! We’re mates and I guess I have to see you through this sheer
‘You must go quickly. I’ll take care of the Horcrux here—make sure it’s … properly disposed of,’ Regulus hesitates, and then grabs Harry’s arm, his dark eyes pleading. ‘Will you tell my brother … that I’m waiting for him? I wouldn’t go on without him, wouldn’t leave him behind, not this time. I—I made sure the rest of the family had gone on first. They wouldn’t be here to trouble him when he comes.’
be blood. It would hardly be his fault; he hadn’t forced Potter at wand point to be a complete idiot.
“I did not beg,” he snapped; he still had no idea whether the strange dreamy girl had forgiven him or not.
Harry laughed, his laughter rumbling through Draco as well. “I guess not. Too much has happened between us.”
Brewing the Angel’s Trumpet Draught was as dangerous as drinking the potion itself. It involved harvesting the flowers of the Angel’s Trumpet plant, every part of which was highly dangerous. Inhaling the fumes of the flowers would lead to a slow, painful death. The potion-maker had to be careful in every single step, and the process took six months.
His sisters enjoy parties and balls exceedingly for their offerings of entertainment and new, thrilling company. Harry, who must chaperone them, finds himself weary of the empty chatter and false smiles swirling around him at such venues. He very much prefers the small dinners at Ron and Hermione’s cottage, the quiet and the familiarity a balm to his frazzled nerves. Lizzy quite despairs his predilection for solitude, accusing him of being a stuffy old codger.
The wizarding world – the part of it that Potter was trying so desperately to protect – would be destroyed by Dumbledore’s death.
Draco gave himself up to the kiss, knowing only heat and want and longing. He curled his hand on the back of Potter’s head, the dark hair soft between his fingers. Potter pulled away, dropped his mouth to Draco’s neck. Draco shuddered at the touch of Potter’s lips and tongue, wet and hot as fire.
‘I’m surprised it took so long,’ he said with a shrug. ‘I have been expecting it since my parents tried to disown me – and society had always taken their cue from the Malfoys,’ he interposed with an ironic smirk. ‘They couldn’t, of course, because the Manor always likes me better than it liked them.’
She set her wine glass down carefully and turned to look at Harry, tucking her legs neatly beneath her. She had the manner of someone bracing herself for an uphill battle.
A high-pitched screaming pierced the air. Moaning Myrtle had returned and she was sounding the alarm. ‘MURDER! MURDER IN THE BATHROOM! MURDER!’
There is a smell like an open grave, like a decaying house and moth-eaten tapestries. Potter stands in the cauldron, his arms bent at the elbow, held slightly away from his torso, as if he is not quite sure what to do with his body. He stares at Draco, looking young and vulnerable, seventeen years old again, while Draco wears the seven years and more in the lines on his face.
Of course he would. Draco had reminded him of his responsibility, and like the noble Saviour of the Wizarding World he was, he always fulfilled his responsibility, no matter the sacrifice.
Eltanin trips backwards, shrinking behind Blaise's protective arms, shaking his head vehemently; not so much a rejection, but an attempt to clear the haze. He is unable to hear beyond the roar in his head demanding to claim this omega for his own.
Lucius Malfoy had often warned his only son, “You cannot be too happy.” He had meant that Malfoys always had something better to strive for.
Harry glances at him. The other boy is tilting his head back, staring up at the star-strewn sky, his plate forgotten next to him. Harry’s heart clenches, and he grits his teeth, looking back down at his half-eaten sandwich. He puts it down, his appetite vanishing.
The rest of their weekend passes pleasantly at home: Draco works on the translation he has been behind of, thanks to the awful past few days he has been having, while Harry does the cooking. Harry has always liked cooking, saying that it’s something like Potion-making, really. Draco enjoys everything Harry cooks – even the odd Muggle-inspired concoctions the Manor house elves could not have come up with.
“What?” Potter looked up from his hands, eyes wide with confusion. “No, no, he has a date with Hermione tonight. I’m still on duty.”
There was nothing for it but to forge on. “You are the one who told the Healers I had Veela ancestry. You’re the reason I’m stuck like this!”
Longbourn’s management was admittedly in a dastardly state when Harry first took it on. Between his father’s innate carelessness and the war, the books were in such a state that Harry has to seek Hermione’s help over a Floo-call. Harry is at present confident enough of an estate manager that he does not go to bed fretting over illogical sums, and as a consequence, at leisure to be sent by his mother on errands to secure his sisters’ future marriages.
For once, in a very long time, he recognises only the vastness of his own emotions filling his chest, feels the rippling torn-metal edges of his grief, and he weeps.
Malfoy freezes. The very air seems to hold its breath – Harry certainly is – before the other man turns around sharply, his face an inscrutable mask.
‘I heard something outside – I thought it was you guys – and I saw him cry – I saw Potter there.’ Goyle flushed, mortified at his slip-up.
Harry stands on his tiptoes, peering behind the counter shelves at a dark narrow walkway. The shop seems abandoned.
‘You can’t force someone to relive trauma they don’t want to,’ Hermione told him rather crossly when he complained to her about it. ‘That’s being a selfish prick, Harry.’
“Harry, I’m not together with Pansy. We’re simply really good friends. We’ve never been together because – because I’m gay.”
Draco looked over his shoulder and saw the obdurate set of Zabini’s jaw, the forbidding look on his face.
Harry stood in the ankle-length grass, staring blankly at the dark windows of an empty Hogwarts. He exhaled shakily, his anger utterly spent. He pressed a hand against his forehead, squeezing his eyes shut.
that those filthy Mudbloods stole their magic,’ Jackson had a reedy voice made higher by fervent excitement. ‘
. Draco began moving his finger in gentle, circular motions, his other hand steadily stroking his cock.
Harry nods, grinning. Even if he were not intimately aware of Draco’s life, most of Wizarding Britain would know of the Malfoy heir’s very public campaign to force the purebloods—even those who managed to keep their hands clean—to reckon with their role in Voldemort’s rise to power. He seemed immune to outcries of hypocrisy bringing up his family history: he is after all, a war hero.
‘You’re not eating enough,’ Pansy whispered, pushing a still-warm bun into his hands when he arrived late to Defence Against the Dark Arts one morning.
"Ugly," he repeats, closing the distance, crowding Potter against the moss-covered stone wall fencing the garden in. There are bird twittering madly in the twisted woods beyond the wall. "Do you think I want pretty?" His voice is low, trembling. "Do you think I want
Harry grabs his hands by the wrists, yanking him up to his feet. Draco staggers; has Harry always been so strong? He sees his best friend’s face better when they are standing this close, Harry’s arms around his shoulders and their breaths mingling. Shadows pool along the hard lines of anger, still rendering Harry unknowable.
‘Draco, is this an actual Ellad necklace?’ Hermione asks in an odd voice, cradling the pearl jewellery in her hands.
Draco does not know what Harry wants for him anymore, what he thinks of him, because their bond has been shattered—a nothingness instilled by distance. Mother tells him Harry is still somewhere in the country. ‘He isn’t truly gone, and it is only temporary, my love. This is part of growing up. I know this isn’t pleasant, and you can hate it all you like, but you will learn from this, Draco, and the two of you will be better for it.’
His eyes black with hatred and loathing, Potter obeyed. He withdrew to Dumbledore’s side, his fists clenched and his entire body a tight twist of tension; a lion barely restrained by its master. Draco kept his eyes on Dumbledore.
He thought he had an inkling. He spoke for Malfoy and his mother at their trials to keep them out of Azkaban, and he saw the way Malfoy wouldn’t look him in the face, the way he flinched at sudden noises and flashes of light, the way the filthy Azkaban robes hung on his skeletal frame. He saw, and he assumed he understood.
Draco rushes to assure him. ‘I didn’t tell anyone, of course. I figured it out on my own. You are hiding it, so I thought you must want to keep it a secret, even though your godfather is out. I understand why—of course there’s nothing wrong with it—but the way society treats omegas …’ He trails off, searching Harry’s face anxiously. ‘You are angry that I know.’
‘Would you like to know?’ the other man asks a little brightly. ‘Well, I did expect to be greeted with a hex or a jinx to the face, or perhaps a “Go away, Malfoy. I would never help the likes of
They ran down the steps and to the Lawn. Somewhere, further down, something was on fire and Hagrid was bellowing in rage. Draco didn’t turn to look; Snape urged him on. Draco’s lungs were constricted, his legs burning liquid fire – but he had to run.
Potter’s face shuttered immediately. He pushed himself up into a sitting position. Draco sat up too, facing him. For a few long moments, he regarded Draco seriously.
Draco had to admit that the ritual for summoning Death, one of the Unseen Gods, seemed a little too straightforward.
He smiled, and watched the responding joy spread over Harry’s face. He leaned in, grabbing the bulge in Harry’s jeans, and relished the sound of Harry’s gasp and the fluttering of eyelids and the sight of Harry’s self-control cracking.
Netherfield Park is often touted as the handsomest estate in all of Hertfordshire, and Harry readily agrees, full of admiration for the manor with its many sparkling chandeliers, vivid masterpiece paintings, and rich, elegant furniture. They have come to dinner at Netherfield frequently to be sure, but it is quite something else to behold the manor when its inhabitants are determined to present it to its best advantages.
‘Well, we know he has done it once, with the diary that one of his followers—yes, Crabbe perhaps—slipped into Miss Weasley’s belongings all those years ago,’ Dumbledore explained, ‘but Horace’s memory shows that Voldemort was already thinking of more than two pieces even as a teenager.’
‘Yeah …’ Draco said. ‘You didn’t need to keep a lookout past twelve you know. It’s only going to be more suspicious if people saw Zabini lurking out here.’
Luc strode forwards, furious, as Zabini carefully closed the door behind him and placed a Locking Spell. Alarmed, Harry held his hands up because Luc seemed like he was prime to punch him in the face. The smaller man hauled him off his stool and slammed him against a cabinet of utensils. Harry winced; for such a small man, he was absurdly strong.
He wants Minnie to be happy, he really does. Does she know how the Dursleys kept him into the dark, spider-infested cupboard beneath the stairs?
—he wants to be a Geomancer. I thought he would be better than Liam, who gets shirty all the time when I want to study with you or the others. And there’s Robert—I can’t remember why I agreed to go out with him,’ Draco is frowning; probably because he has green eyes.
His best friend is silent for a while, his body trembling in Harry’s hold. He looks up, slowly, torturously. His silvery eyes are wet and shining with tears, and when he reaches to grab Harry’s arms, his hands burn against Harry’s skin.
Draco’s mind was somewhere buoyant and fizzy, and it took a while for her words to travel through the clouds. He looked at her. She had emerged from under her arms, her face flushed from wine and pinched with sadness.
After everything he had seen over the last two weeks, Harry couldn’t blame Luc for being so angry, so he continued to hold his hands up and explained as calmly as he could with a fist shoved against his throat. ‘I came from the debate too. I was … I was upset and I wasn’t watching where I was running. I ended up in Knockturn before I knew where I was, and … Goyle invited me in for tea.’
Harry stares down at the table, studying the crumbs that lay like grave dirt between them. His fists are clenched in his lap. He feels the words bubbling up within in, sour and acidic and poisonous. He must say them. He must speak the truth, and when the world’s judgement comes in the wake of his revelation, he must embrace it, for that is what he deserves.
The German strode in, smirking confidently. He closed the door behind him. Draco sat up, alarmed, hand reaching into his pocket for his wand.
He offers Draco his neck, looking at him from under his lashes. Draco grins, a flash of teeth, eyes glittering. He lifts his other hand, rests it—barely—on the side of Harry’s neck; Harry shudders, pressing his lips together, leaning into the touch.
Merlin alone knows how Draco has to fight to hold himself together on nights Harry comes home drunk and smelling of other men. But the pain – what feels like searing lacerations across his chest, dug in by claws dripping with poison – is worth it, so long as Draco has the privilege of sitting next to Harry and seeing him smile.
‘Brown?’ the blond squints across the common room, where Lavender is sitting with the younger girls. ‘Oh. That’s interesting.’
‘It only takes training, once you know how to find the loophole in the wards,’ he says with some asperity. ‘I can teach you, if you want. It’s not a big deal. Neville has learned to do it too.’
Harry rubs his wrist absently, a bruise where Draco held him harder than usual. He has forgotten how much effort it takes Draco to hold himself back when he must live amongst wizards.
It is Harry’s fault, because he is distracted by Malfoy, drunk and flushed, leaning against him, a warm hand wrapped around Harry’s wrist. They are standing outside the pub, the prince whinging that he is
‘Oh, that evil, evil woman! I’m going to break that quill of hers, see if I don’t! You are to stay away from her, do you hear me, Harry? You
‘Why?’ she asks, peering down at him past her list of names. ‘It doesn’t make much of a difference when you go, since the Sorting Hat only takes into account the individual.’
‘I doubt it would have made much of a difference,’ Father retorts dryly. ‘Don’t you remember how much he pined for Lily Potter? I have always suspected she is the reason Dumbledore has accepted Snape so closely into his fold, even though he was a Death Eater.’
Harry looks at Draco’s hands still and tensed by his sides. Draco talks with his hands, elegant fingers painting scenes in the air, as he exaggerates stories for dramatic effect.
There is a vague sense of warning: he mustn’t overextend himself, he doesn’t know how much magic he really has, but he ignores it, because Harry Potter will die without this healing, and if he dies—Draco cuts his thoughts off here, and focusses on healing until the venom tracks recede and disappear, and Harry is breathing normally again, his thin chest rising and falling beneath Draco’s hands.
that you’re here with us,’ Potter says, glancing at Granger and Weasley and Longbottom on the other side. ‘This will be fun.’
There would not be any questions about Azkaban visits then. Nor any sudden visits from this wanker he thought he must leave in the past with his mistakes. Somehow, the greater universe has decided that Harry has not done nearly enough to make amends, and he must be put through the wringer to really atone for his wrongs.
The other Horcruxes are items related to the Hogwarts founders. It was Snape who said cryptically: ‘He always tried coming back, didn’t he? His influence started here.’ And Dumbledore reluctantly agreed. ‘I will always live with the regret that I could not have turned him away from this path when he was my student,’ he said. ‘What a poor teacher I was!’
His godfathers exchange a look. Sirius sighs, reaching out to ruffle Harry’s mop. ‘Well, that part of you is just like your mother. The convoluted ways your brain must work to concoct the best potions.’
She laughs, swatting her husband on the arm. ‘Don’t tease him, Lucius. We are here. Don’t be a nuisance now, boys.’
To everyone’s credit, they did not look at Harry. He looked down, his fingers digging into his palms. He has not heard Voldemort’s voice since the night of Lucius’s death. The meetings could be difficult, but he is grateful for them. There is action and development, and he welcomes the steady march towards an ending, whatever it may be.
“Come on,” Harry rolled his eyes, leaning in again to grab Draco by his shoulders. “Haven’t I been so obvious? Hermione certainly said so.”
He shakes out his right sleeve, and a wand slips out into his palm. Without another word, he begins waving his wand at random at the surrounding shelves, causing narrow, flat boxes to come flying out. Harry exchanges nervous glances with his guardians. They smile at him reassuringly, Sirius giving him an enthusiastic thumbs-up.
His godfathers and Minnie are looking towards the back of the shop, where it’s a little quieter. A man and woman, both pale and blond, are standing there, watching as an older witch takes the measurements of a blond child on the pedestal. Harry cannot tell if it’s a boy or girl from this distance. He looks up at Sirius, and his eyes widen.
know where it is,’ Draco said loftily. ‘The only problem is that it’s broken and seeing how you have a
Pansy and Zabini were talking to Draco again. It was Pansy who gave in. She sat next to him in the common room one day and demanded he help her with her Charms homework. He didn’t protest. The next day, when Draco arrived later than usual for dinner (Potter had tackled him as he was coming down from the seventh floor), Zabini pushed him a plate of food he had saved. He had been lonely without Pansy and Zabini, even if he had the Cabinet and Potter to occupy his time.
Harry feels those scarred palms dragging across his bare chest, the roughness sparking heat across his skin, Draco’s long fingers digging into his flesh. He hears the gasp and the whimper, mouths panting in desire.
to?” Harry raised his eyebrows with mock incredulity. “Draco, I don’t think I can want anything more.”
Harry’s week ends on nearly as bad a note as it did last week, but at least he wouldn’t be walking in on Draco fucking someone in the living room. Draco said he would cook dinner tonight; they have hardly seen each other all week, what with work and their various dinner appointments.
But goblins are forgotten the moment the vault door opened and Harry saw the fortune his parents have left him. Minnie told him he needn’t take out too much, since she or his godfathers will be buying his school supplies for him. So he took enough for treats and presents he can get for his guardians now that he has some money—
He crashes to the ground, water splashing around him, his left wing snapping under him. He thinks he screams, but he isn’t sure, because he cannot hear—or breathe. There are hands around his neck, fingernails digging into his flesh, and his face is in the foul water, tasting of sewage and death. It should be easy for him to buck his attacker off, to swing his arm around and dislodge him, to swipe his claws and draw blood.
He sat up, slow and painful, his every joint aching. Rooting in his pocket, he pulled out the coin spelled with the Protean Charm. The message to Rosmerta, which she would in turn transmit to the Death Eaters, read:
Harry dodges another tackle, and comes around the other side of the room, his chest heaving with the effort. His shoulders are burning with pain.
‘Easily,’ Zabini growled, flicking a derisive eye at Draco’s Dark Mark. ‘I thought I knew you, Malfoy. I thought that even though your family is scum, you had
Draco sits shivering in the stands by the Great Lake with Neville, watching the wind ripple across the dark green, glassy surface. They have been waiting for the past fifteen minutes, half-listening to the announcer chatter about the merpeople village in the lake. The Gryffindors around them are taking bets on who will be the first to emerge; the odds are in Viktor Krum’s favour.
