The silence stretched between them.
The cool air of the library brushed against her exposed labia and a shudder ran through her body. “Don’t make me punish you, Granger.” She imagined the sultry drawl in her ear and her fingers slipped through her folds as the scene played out in her overactive mind.
“I agree. It will help me avoid him. He basically commanded that he was coming by for lunch to discuss the logistics of me returning ‘home’ to him.” She rolled her eyes and with a vigorous flick of her wrist sent the papers back into their folder on her desktop. “Let’s inform Harry that we’re returning to the Patils to follow up with the house elves.”
“Ron, you need to leave. Before she does something drastic.” Bill turned Ron back toward the door and firmly pushed him toward it.
“Oh Harry. I’ve been so careful. I’ve tried for so long to keep my feelings to myself. I didn’t want to come between you.” Hermione moaned as Draco’s teeth grazed her shoulder and his hands stroked over her denim-clad thighs. “I’m afraid I’ve been desperately in love with you, both of you, for so long now.”
Alice’s hands stopped trembling and she stood stiffly, “I understand that you think that, Auror Granger. However, you and your partner demonstrate a level of understanding and connection that others only dream to replicate. If the entire department could replicate even a fraction of your teamwork then we could do so much more…”
“Kreacher, I have to leave. You need to take good care of Harry and Draco and Crookshanks for me. Okay?” She pulled back, resting her hands on his bony shoulders. She watched understanding dawn on the house elf and he latched onto her wrist.
Draco pushed Harry’s chair in as they settled into their cozy table at one of the few acceptable restaurants in Draco’s arsenal. As he settled into his chair across the table Draco smirked.
Chapter 5 - Choosing Sides
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Hermione chewed her bottom lip as she surveyed the library. Her eyes landed on the writing desk by the draped window. Grimmauld was still under the effects of a fidelius charm so theoretically no one should be able to see in the windows unless they were somehow within the wards and hovering outside the second floor window. Heat crept up her body as she set her book aside and positioned herself to stand behind the ancient desk.
Hermione blushed at their comparisons, while not wrong they were telling of how well the Weasley boys knew her. With a few exceptions they really felt like an extended family. She reached beneath the table and squeezed Draco’s hand as she was overwhelmed with love for them.
“Right. I’ll keep that in mind next time I ask an immortal being to teach me something they could have used words to convey but chose to foist the memories upon me instead.” Harry straightened up and glared at the spectre before him. Trust Death to try and annoy him after being ignored all these years. If he had known that being Master of Death would saddle him with this immortal git he would have taken his chances with Riddle without the Elder Wand.
Draco took a long sip of his wine before responding. “Even though you don’t enjoy the publicity that being their hero brings, you enjoy going nice places with me, admit it.” His smile was wistful and a bit sad.
Harry cast another spell over it and nodded. “If you want to, put it in the break nook and let it get eaten. I know a couple of the lads will get a laugh at the attempt. Er, if that’s alright with you, Hermes?”
“That defense club Umbridge had us break up? What about that would stir such deep resentment to last this many years?” Draco quirked an eyebrow and took another drink as he let George settle on his words.
Draco stopped suddenly as the situation replayed in his mind. He and Harry had been suspicious of Hermione’s unwavering loyalty and love for the other third of the golden trio. Those two had always had famously explosive rows in school because of Weasley’s short fuse on his temper and Granger’s stubborn refusal to give up on her passion projects. They clashed on at least a weekly basis until just after the war. They even fought while on the run with Harry, causing Weasley to storm off and drawing Harry and Hermione closer than ever to support each other through the abandonment. No one really understood how they had gotten together as a couple in the months that followed the final battle. No one questioned it. It had seemed right to the public at large that Harry’s two best friends should be together. No one questioned it when they moved in together, or when Hermione stopped fighting so hard for what she wanted to change, not even when they stopped fighting all together. When had he started to notice her odd behavior? They have been partners for four years now, since the first day of auror training, how had he not seen his partner slowly withering away from the fiery woman he had come to respect? His brows knit together and he placed a hand absentmindedly on the small of her back as they walked together toward the exit into Diagon Alley. She chattered on grumpily beside him as his mind wandered through the memories of the past.
Pleasant conversation ensued as the meal began. George enthusiastically chatted about his newest product ideas and got into a small argument about the ethics of a potion version of truth or dare that would force the user to answer the question or submit to the first dare presented.
“Potter left love bites on me, they saw them, and I have not yet lived it down. It’s been two years.” Draco released Harry and straightened his cuffs. “Now, we should be getting over there before there are any strange whispers about a repeat performance.”
Hermione turned and beamed at Percy, “Sorry Perce, Ron had something he wanted to say. Thanks for taking the trouble to come fetch me for our meeting this morning.” Her eyes screamed ‘please play along’ at him and he nodded to her and tapped his date book with his fingertip. “It’s no trouble at all Auror Granger, you know how Kingsley feels about punctuality. We’ll take his personal lift, of course, to offset the delay my brother has caused to our schedule. This way please.” He led her to a small gilded lift off the side of the atrium and once they were on their way to the minister’s office, he turned to her and asked, “Are you alright?”
“You wanted to see me, Minister Shacklebolt?” Harry held up the remnants of the memo before dropping it in the bin next to the desk.
“Hermione!” Harry’s voice carried over the din of the regular patrons and the two of them spotted his tan arms waving wildly from a booth in the far corner. Harry had managed to secure a table with the best view of all of the entrances and exits to the pub. Draco smiled and guided Hermione through the web of tables and patrons without a second thought for her independent nature.
Hermione bolted out of her chair and around the table, scooping Arthur into a tight embrace. “Oh Arthur.” She buried her face in his shoulder and they both shook silently as they wept. The pair was wrapped in many pairs of arms and the dinner party as a whole grieved for the two. For they had both been harmed by someone they trusted and loved.
When had she become so lascivious?
“Look, Alice, I know Kensington put you up to this. I’m not upset with you, honestly.” Hermione rose and circled her desk, gesturing toward the door. “But Auror Malfoy and I have our hands full, and while we would love to help out new trainee classes, we don’t want to be put through all the spectacle of it. We went through our classes like everyone else, even Kensington before us, we really are nothing special.”
Harry chuckled at his lover’s words. “Draco, she is more than just headstrong, her heart and will are forces to be reckoned with. You know how much she is responsible for keeping me alive and together after Ron left us. Without her we wouldn’t be here, there would be no Granger-Malfoy Auror Dream Team out solving mysteries and saving the world one case at a time.” He smiled and finished off his tea, rising to clear the table.
“Even if she doesn’t date me, or you, or us, we are still going to love and support her as long as we live. We’ve put her happiness first successfully for five years, we can do it for five, ten, twenty, a hundred more. Don’t worry so much love.” Draco kissed him gently, coaxing his lips apart and rubbing his hands over Harry’s back in a soothing manner.
Severus huffed in annoyance and gestured vaguely to the steel deep sinks. “Scrub those and stay out of the line of fire. This is proving to be a volatile variant.”
Harry nodded and kept his attention on Draco even as his mind replayed what he had seen. “She was most definitely masturbating to you, love. It was so beautiful.”
“You can’t be seriously considering us three going. Can you?” Draco tightened his grip on Hermione, “I understand that the Weasley Family Brunch is a tradition, and that you are considered their honorary son, but it would-” A hand on his stopped him mid-sentence. He looked down at Hermione and she smiled.
“Love, we’re always in danger. Did you forget who we are?” Draco winked at her. “After all, I’m buggering the Man Who Refuses to Die, and you’re his best friend. We are all in danger. Constantly.”
“Do come in Harry. Mind the stacks.” Kingsley’s voice came from behind a pile of scrolls on the edge of his desk. Harry stepped gingerly into the office, sidestepping a stack of parchment teetering on the lone chair facing the minster’s desk. Peeking over the stack of scrolls Harry raised a hand in a greeting wave to Kingsley.
“Draco, darling, what brings you by? Arthur hasn’t made it home from work yet. Come in, come in.” Molly pulled him into a hug and pulled him through the sitting room and into the kitchen before he could get a response out of his mouth.
“Oh Hermione dear, it’s a pleasure to see you again. It really has been too long.” Molly commented as she served another portion of sausage onto her husband’s plate. “It’s a shame you don’t come to visit more often.” The conversations stilled as they focused on the subtle dig from Molly.
Hermione’s hand trembled as she brought her fork to her lips, trepidation filling her as she waited to see what His owl had brought to Harry. Of course they would still communicate. They had all been friends the same amount of time. She would never dream to deny Harry his choice in friends. A bit of egg fell from her fork and bounced off the edge of her plate to be gobbled up by a greedy little owl. A solid weight landed on her shoulder, warmth spreading through the cold that had seeped into her bones at the sight of His owl. The warmth spread as another weight settled on her other shoulder and began a rhythmic kneading of her tense muscles. She relaxed into the touch and leaned her head back against a solid object, it gave a little beneath her weight and she looked up into the Mercury eyes of her partner.
“Darling, I am so glad to see you so much yourself again. I know we haven’t had much close contact this last decade but I had heard of your predicament through my dragon and had my suspicions that the youngest Weasley boy was mistreating our traditions. Arthur,” She turned and frowned at the Weasley patriarch. “Just what has gotten into that boy’s head? Using love potions like that.” She scoffed and patted Hermione’s hand when the girl stiffened.
“Alright, alright, let them breathe. We have food waiting.” Arthur commanded the room with his gentle authority. He led them to the kitchen and had everyone seated. Hermione was buffeted on either side by her boys. They ate in friendly company, the only Weasleys missing were Ron and Charlie, and the latter was mostly because he had a dragon clutching that weekend and couldn’t get the time off.
“Well if you would stop being so damn stubborn and concede that you don’t have all the facts, I might be more inclined to listen to what you have to say, Granger.” Draco’s face was flushed in a way that Harry was surprised that he found attractive in the man. He packed that thought away for later examination and cleared his throat loudly.
“Auror Granger?” A young voice pulled her out of her spiralling thoughts and she glanced up to see one of the trainees from the newest class with her fist raised to knock on the doorframe.
The couple closed their bedroom door behind them. Harry cast a silencing spell and pulled his blazer off and threw it on the vanity chair. He was unbuttoning his shirt as Draco’s hands stilled his own.
“Is that sarcasm? From a Malfoy? Well, I never.” She nudged his thigh with her knee and laughed.
“Hasn’t done anything-” Hermione choked on her rage at Molly’s words. “Your son drugged me, coerced me into sex with him with the intention of starting a family with me against my will, and sabotaged my attempts at birth control. How is that not wrong?”
Harry pulled away and sank into one of the dining chairs. “You don’t understand.” He muttered, gazing deeply into his tea.
They left the office without incident and spent the greater part of the day with the house elves of the Patil family to leave with as much information as they had when they arrived. No one in the house knew where Holly had gone, or to what purpose. Just that she must have been taken because she would never leave her family and refuse their summons of her own free will.
“I’m not leaving. This is my house. That’s my fiance. We’re having a nice lovely family brunch. You’re being silly.” Ron’s tone turned cajoling, the same type he had used on Hermione whenever she brought up concerns or doubts about their relationship. It struck her, hard.
Hermione was rudely awakened by a heavy weight pressing against her bladder, sharp pains radiated from four points on her abdomen where her darling familiar crouched on her guts. He mewed loudly in her face until she cracked an eye open, satisfied that he had her attention he kneaded on her bladder, his sharp claws easily piercing her sleep shirt, one of Harry’s old quidditch jerseys she had nicked. “Alright, Crooks, I’m awake.” She groaned and tried to push him off her, to no avail. He kept kneading at her until she forced him off by sitting up and sending him tumbling onto the blankets that covered her legs. “I understand. I’m up. Go bother Draco. He’s a morning person.” She swung her legs out of bed, which satisfied Crookshanks’ mission to wake her and see her greet the day, so he trotted off to go and find that Malfoy boy his mistress loved and get his reward pets for a job well done. Begrudgingly Hermione prepared for the day ahead.
“Our office” Hermione interjected, still slightly annoyed at the story she had been fed.
The lights in the room flickered, the sparking became a crackle reminiscent of distant thunder and before Hermione could murder the two women, Arthur put up a shield, blocking the two women into a corner of the kitchen, blackening it to cut off the sight of them.
“Yes ma’am, begging your pardon for interrupting.” The dark haired girl took the seat opposite Hermione’s with grace. “I was sent over by my trainer to request that you and Auror Malfoy schedule time to come to the training hall for a demonstration.” Her spine was straight though her hands trembled slightly at the request.
Hermione cut off his rambling by pulling him into a desperate kiss, her hand slipping down to stroke him through his sleep pants. Her mind was growing fuzzy from the realization that they had desperately wanted her for so very long. “Take us to bed, Harry. Love me. Show me how much you have been holding back.”
Hermione and Draco close one of their cases, and the three of them get invited to Sunday brunch.
Neville smiled at Hermione before glancing at the cake with a low whistle. “He really dug deep for that one. I honestly thought he had forgotten that class. Though, I never could forget what an ass he was. He made my first real friend cry.” He reached over and held Hermione’s hand rubbing the back of it with his thumb.
“I’ve trusted and supported the both of you, can’t you even trust me to stay at my own apartment?” Hermione was vibrating with anger, her hair had begun to grow in volume from the building magical tension in the room.
Heromione woke in their bed. She was suffocatingly hot, bodies pressed into her on either side, limbs a tangle under the duvet. She came to awareness slowly, reluctant to leave the comfort and safety of the strong arms that pulled her close. Her bladder, however, had other ideas and made its presence known. Hermione pushed the covers down slowly and tried to delicately remove herself from between Harry and Draco’s sleeping forms. Harry groaned as she moved and he hooked a leg over Draco’s and pulled him closer as she extracted herself. She quietly made her way to the attached bathroom and began her morning routine.
“Alright Archimedes, I know she’s waiting. Get home.” He stroked a finger one last time down the owl’s feathers and went back to his task of setting the table for their romantic dinner date. Though Granger would never call it that. It most certainly was a date to him. He wanted to impress her with his thoughtfulness and charms skills. He had just set the wine glasses out as laughter filled the room. Harry and Hermione bursting into the room, arms linked, laughing like they were back in Hogwarts. Draco’s heart ached at the sight.
“We can definitely use that as a bargaining chip, but you are forbidden from approaching this while it’s framed as ‘protecting a damsel in distress’. You’ll just push her away again.” Harry led Draco to stand beside the window and watch the stars struggle to peek out through the murky mist that was settling over the evening. “I don’t want to push her away, especially when she’s vulnerable. She won’t talk about it. She feels like she’s said enough already.” Harry clenched the window sill, and Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s waist, resting his pointy chin on his lover’s shoulder.
“Potter. I apologize for the wait. I had an unexpected setback with an experiment and it took longer to combine than anticipated. I had feared that the modified ingredient list was not miscible, though it seems my initial conclusion was correct.” Severus Snape’s baritone, though quieter now than it had been in school, was no less strict or commanding. He swept into the chair on his side of the desk and pulled out a stack of parchment. “I have made progress with the confection and have narrowed it to four possible poisons, though I will need you to acquire a thorough diagnostic on Mr. Thomas from Saint Mungo’s, as a consultant I am not allowed access as it would violate patient confidentiality laws. Once we acquire the complete details of the affects the poison has had on his body I can determine which variant was used, brew you the antidote, for an additional fee as per our agreement, and determine the ingredients list, difficulty of procural, and vendors who would supply these. All standard fees apply, unless there proves to be difficulty in the antidote creation process.” He slid the stack of parchment across his desk for Harry to peruse and rested his interlocked hands on his desk.
“How proficient did Ginevra become at pastries and decoration?” Draco picked up a biscuit and turned it over in his hands, projecting an air of boredom and reluctance to ask these questions.
He repeated the process of bringing his hand down hard on her ass and gently stroking the inflamed flesh as he remarked over what a good girl she was being. She lost track of time as she was immersed in her fantasy and didn’t hear the floo. Her fingers were working her flesh with practiced ease, her gasps and moans growing in volume as she neared her climax. Her fantasy Malfoy had decided to reward her and slid his cock deep inside her, pumping furiously into her, her fingers matched the speed, if not the angle she had imagined he would use. Moments later, as the library door opened, Hermione reached her peak and shouted her climax.
“I can’t believe it. Hermione Granger, of all people, was a naughty little swot and actually lost her virginity to a Quidditch star in her fourth year.” Draco leaned forward, gesticulating with his spoon.
“The Society for the Promotion of Evlish Welfare, yes.” She muttered as she thought. “Though, that was before I knew that it was a symbiotic relationship. Though some people don’t take that bond as the treasured gift it is.”  Her face twisted in a thoughtful frown.
The auror department was abuzz with activity that afternoon as a risky raid on a cache of dark artifacts was finally winding down into categorizing the goods, healing the injured, and writing reports by the auror teams involved. The excited buzz drowned out the sharp clicking of expensive heeled leather boots approaching Hermione's office door.
Days passed the trio by in a whirlwind of petty crimes, misdemeanors, and increasingly desperate gifts from one Ronald Weasley. For the third time that week Hermione had walked into her office to find a container of sweets or a bouquet of flowers on her desk which she promptly dumped into the bin. Today, however, it seems he had decided to step up the gift giving and a large silver cloche-covered platter sat on her desk.
“Well, since the case is closed I suppose it’s not a matter of importance, but Holly was seen in the vicinity of Hogsmeade by one of the Hogwarts elves that was out on an errand for the headmistress.” He stood and walked the length of the room before stopping in front of their wall of open cases. “Said she looked fearful and wary. Like, and I quote, she was doin somethin she ought not to be doing and would end up ironing her hands for. Now why would our darling Holly be acting like that if she was tending to her sickly mother?” He turned and frowned at Hermione. “It doesn’t add up.”
Just as she was about to speak, the door from the garden burst inward, “Sorry I’m late mum, but George had me ordering all sorts of supplies and this was the earliest I could sneak away.” The familiar lilt sank like a stone into the pit of Hermione’s stomach. No. Arthur had promised he would be distracted. He hadn’t seen her yet, she was certain. Hermione began scanning the room for exits, he was blocking the easiest route so it would have to be further into the burrow she decided, through the living room. The floo could be used if she was fast enough, but he had never given up on his quidditch and would likely be as fast as her, perhaps the front door, if she used her wand to open it as she ran. A quick twist once she reached the front gate and she would be home. It wasn’t ideal but it would have to do. She released Draco’s hand and went for her wand.
Hermione whirled on the owner of the hand that had snatched her and glared up at the face of her ex-lover. “Ronald. This is highly inappropriate.” She hissed at him as she pulled at her wrist. His grip tightened and he smiled at her.
“I’m sorry Ronald, but I really can’t be late for this appointment with Minister Shacklebolt. Look, even Percy has had to come down and fetch me.” She tilted her head toward his older brother who had begun to walk over. “Can we discuss this some other time? I really do have to go.” She pulled her wrist free and his grip tightened on her shoulder.
“Oh, it’s nothing my dragon. The annual audit of the properties. One of the alchemy books is missing, but it’s probably just been misplaced or improperly logged. It’s the one that great uncle Alphard wrote while he was obsessed with necromantic theory. It was probably seized by the ministry and improperly removed from our inventory list. Alphard Malfoy’s interests always leaned toward the dark and obscure.” Narcissa waved it off and turned to Hermione.
“Hello Molly. I’m actually here to see you, as it were.” Draco settled into the bench like seating along the overly large table situated in the middle of the kitchen.
“It wasn’t a dream, Crookshanks was found in your apartment. Potter called us to the scene, do you recall?” Draco asked as he eyed her warily.
“You promised Harry that you would go. Before you knew that he would be there you were also quite excited to get to see Longbottom again.” Draco slid his hand down to her shoulder blades and gave her a little nudge as the doors to the lift opened. He quirked an eyebrow at her mutinous expression and depressed the brass knob for the ministry’s atrium.
Narcissa’s chuckle warmed a place in Hermione she hadn’t realized had gone cold. A piece of her heart that had longed for the acceptance of those born to this world. She smiled and continued, collecting herself, “Draco and I have just closed a missing house elf case, though it’s not as interesting as some would have you believe. A family’s elf had gone missing and it was unlike her to leave without some kind of notice,” Narcissa nodded along, listening intently. “So during the course of our investigation she turned up in our office, of all places, and gave the explanation that she had been urgently called away by an ailing family member.”
Hermione laughed in surprise at his earnest declaration. “Oh Perce, I have no intention of ever going back there. You know you all are family to me, but he will never be anything more than a stranger. Not after everything he took from me. I have my accommodations well in hand, the people I am staying with would probably tear his head off if he tried anything again, provided I didn’t get to him first.” She smiled up at him as the lift settled and the gates opened. “Thanks again for the escape route. Have a good day and give the Minister my greetings.” She patted him on the cheek and made her way past the secretaries on the Minister’s floor to the public lifts, pointedly ignoring the whispers that followed.
“Auror Potter, now, is it?” Harry frowned at the distance she was emotionally putting between them. “Capable is never in question, but you have to understand, love, that you can’t go back there.” The endearment slipped through in his attempt to reach her.
Harry flipped through the paperwork and leaned back in his chair. He took his time perusing all of the details his best pair put into their file. The silence stretched beyond comfort and well into awkward by the time he snapped the file closed. “If you feel strongly enough that there was foul play involved, open a new file, but know that it may not actually lead us anywhere. I agree that this is all just a bit too tidily wrapped up. Did it seem like the Patils accepted her story?” Hermione nodded in response while Draco scoffed. “Of course. You said they seemed so distraught when she was gone. This must have been a great relief to them to have her returned unharmed. I would believe her as well.”
With a wave of his wand Kingsley opened the window and frowned as the owl made to deliver the missive to Harry and not to himself. He watched Harry’s face as he scanned the scroll’s words. It went from surprised, to concerned, to awed. “Well?” He huffed in annoyance.
Hermione nodded, waved her wand to summon Holly’s case file from the floating wall of paperwork, and placed the finalized report on top, including a note about her and Draco’s suspicions and closed it with a snap. “Let’s go tell Harry.” She stood and made toward the door, Draco on her heels. This was sure to be an interesting debriefing.
“Well, it’s from Arthur. Apparently Ron gave them Pig since he can use George’s owl whenever he needs and they never did replace Errol. Arthur wants us round for brunch this Sunday.” Harry tapped the parchment against his hand absently, “Molly insists, of course, that we’ve been too long since our last one. He says that Ron will be otherwise indisposed and that if she’s free they would all love to see Hermione at a family gathering.” He frowned and tossed the parchment to an empty space as far from them as it could get. “Indisposed” He scoffed, “I hope they have a damn good way to keep him distracted if Hermes is going to step one foot in Ottery St. Catchpole.”
“Harry. Please, talk to me.” Draco tilted Harry’s chin up and he took a deep shuddering breath.
Harry deepened their kiss, his tongue exploring the contours of her mouth and groaned against her lips. “We love you, so much Hermione. Let us love you, let us protect you, and let us care for you, the way you have always deserved.” He knelt between their thighs and ran his hands over her throat and chest, fingers ghosting just past the edge of her nipples, teasing.
Molly placed a steaming cup of tea in front of him and started pulling out biscuits to accompany it. She settled down across from him with her own cuppa and smiled at him. “Well to what do I owe the pleasure, dear?”
The song drew to an end and Draco led them to a stop with Hermione bent back and slightly off balance. He righted their position and ran his knuckles along her cheek. “Thank you for the dance, love.” He leaned forward and brushed his lips across hers in a light chaste kiss. Hermione whimpered softly and pulled him into a deeper kiss, his hands pulling her tight against him. Her kisses became frenzied and without thinking she pushed his blazer off his shoulders and began unbuttoning his crisp white shirt. He pulled back enough to let the blazer fall to the floor and replaced his hands on her waist, one lowering to cup and squeeze her ass as the other tangled itself in her hair, pulling gently. Hermione moaned and let him pull her head back so he could kiss down the column of her throat.
“Yes, sir. Even if it is my former best friend, we will pursue this with extreme prejudice.” Harry’s expression darkened. He hadn’t thought Ron would lower himself to murder if he couldn’t have his way. Though he also hadn’t thought that Ron would have abandoned them in the Forest of Dean either.
Draco had observed long enough and commanded her attention by turning her to face him. “Granger, they broke past the wards you put up. Either they demolished them or they knew you well enough to know what spells you would use.” He tried appealing to her logic, “This person has intimate knowledge of how that big beautiful brain works and will exploit it time and again until they finally get you cornered.” He pulled her chair towards him, placing her crossed legs between his knees. He reached out and took both her hands in his as he spoke again. “Let Harry and I give you a safe haven to work out of until the all clear sounds. Not because you can’t live there, but because we care about you and we want to protect you in any way we can.” He gave her his most charming smile.
“Merlin, what fresh hell is this?” She muttered as she hung her cloak up on the hook near the door.
“Our office.” Draco rolled his eyes at Harry, “While we may be forced to close the case into her disappearance, something is odd with this entire scenario and I would like to petition to open a new file. One covering our concerns.”
“Hullo Verity. I came to ask George something about a case. I didn’t know he was in a meeting.” He stepped away from the door toward her to relieve her of the case of prank items she had obviously just carried in from storage. He watched as her face paled and pulled into a worried frown. She muttered something that sounded vaguely like ‘not again’ before marching over to the lab door and pounding on it.
“Potter, she can’t stay there. It isn’t safe for her.” Draco muttered into the side of Harry’s neck.
“What she has been through. What is still being done to her, if this poison was meant for her. These are things to be handled delicately, and I am not a delicate man, Mr. Potter.” A wisp of regret passed over his face before he stiffened. “I will remain in my position in the background until she has had time to grieve for the life stolen from her. Though a different set of circumstances stole my free will, I am empathetic to her plight. Give her a place to come to life again, Potter. Do things in her time, not yours.” A slender hand gestured to the office door and it swung open. “Good day, Potter. Good luck.”
“You know how she is, Draco. She won’t see it that way.” Harry rubbed Draco’s back in soothing circles. Draco gripped his shoulders and pushed him back to arms length, glaring.
Harry set two matching green mugs of tea on the dining table in his kitchen as the door clicked shut. He glanced up at Draco and frowned. “Is she still under?” He asked, turning to embrace his lover. Draco rested his forehead on Harry’s shoulder and a brief nod was the only confirmation he needed. Hermione would likely be out for a few hours, she had been pushing herself too hard lately since the breakup. Harry frowned. “She always takes on too much at once.”
Hermione drew in a deep breath and steeled herself for her first official meeting with Narcissa Malfoy since the end of the war nearly ten years ago. She had so fully thrown herself into her career and into her failed relationship with Ronald that their social obligations never overlapped, until today. Draco and Harry had insisted that she come with them to their weekly tea with Narcissa, and plied her with promises of intelligent conversation, pleasant company, and a surprise they had refused to tell her.
“Right, sorry. So, Kingsley, your note mentioned that there has been a development with Auror Thomas’s condition?” Harry shifted his weight in anticipation for the imminent bad news.
Family. Hermione glanced around, her heart aching with the love she felt, her gaze passing over Bill, Percy, George, and falling to Arthur sitting at Narcissa’s right hand. These people were her family and had chosen to keep her.
“Oh, Mister Malfoy. I didn’t hear the bell.” Verity’s cheerful voice startled him and he spun to face her, guilt settling nicely next to that dread in his stomach.
Grey clouds roiled above the heads of a half-dozen men and women. Hermione’s mood mirrored the tumultuous skies above. Her colleagues were at a loss as to how one of the beloved members of the Patil household had vanished without a magical or mundane trace. Hermione strode toward the tall intricately-carved front doors of the palatial manor house. She took a deep breath to steady and center herself, grasped the gilded door handle, and stepped inside to interview the family members.
Hermione frowned and mentally reviewed their multiple conversations through the day as the clock on the far side of the department rang out seven chimes in a pleasant tune, the seventh chime seeming to echo into the silence. She groaned loudly and slouched bonelessly in her chair, “Merlin, it’s that stupid party isn’t it? I thought you and Harry said I didn’t have to go if I didn’t want to. I don’t want to go. I don’t want to see him. Not like this.” She gestured at her plain ministry work robes. The Magical Law Enforcement uniform was more or less progressive depending on who you asked. Hermione’s trousers were looking a bit worse for wear and her button down Oxford shirt could definitely use a quick ironing spell. But the worst crime of all was probably that her hair had come loose, as it always did, from her attempts at taming it into a tight bun.
Mr. Patil nodded sternly and stood to leave. “Come, Holly, we have much to do.” Holly jumped to her feet and trailed after Mr. Patil at a trot as he strode toward the exit of the department.
“Granger, honestly, did you think running off in the early morning light would solve the problem at hand?” Draco tilted her face up toward him and he infused his words with a hint of mocking. Trying to get a rise out of her.
Harry took in the scene silently, categorizing every movement and touch. Did she know that she was being flirtatious? No. Her movements lacked the sensual intent behind them. Draco, however, was clearly affected by her proximity between his legs. Harry stood and walked up behind her, rubbing her shoulders and neck gently. “Hermes, would it really be so bad living here with us until this is all sorted?” He spoke softly as he trailed his fingers up her neck to massage her scalp. Something he hadn’t done with her since before she and Ron had begun their relationship.
A hand tilted his chin up and a small sad smile spread across Draco’s face, “Oh love, anyone with eyes knew that you loved her. Really, romantically, loved her. I loved you anyway. You and I fell in love despite the fact that we also fiercely loved her. Our love won’t change, just because we have enough love for her as well.”
A tiny energetic ball of feathers bashed repeatedly against the kitchen window of number twelve Grimmauld Place early Friday morning. The three residents looked up and Hermione and Draco locked eyes and grimaced at one another. His breakfast forgotten, Harry rose and opened the window before the tiny owl could hit the glass again. The owl flew with determination through the open window and knocked right into Harry’s chest, tumbling down into his waiting hands. “Hullo there, Pig.” He chuckled as he carried the tiny thing over to the table and set it down between the plates and the platter of bacon. Once he oriented himself, Pigwidgeon hopped toward Harry and held out his leg where a tiny slip of parchment was tied. Harry reached out, retrieving the note, and petted Pig between his eyes. “Thanks, Pig. You don’t need to wait for me.”
“Oh, well it’s not nearly as glorious and action packed as the papers make it out to be. Honestly. If you believed The Daily Prophet we would be out in squads rounding up every dark wizard that dared poke their head out of the shadows.” Hermione huffed and picked up the prepared cuppa in front of her. “Honestly, it’s mostly things like missing persons cases and the occasional attack.”
“You seemed pretty cozy with Hermione tonight.” Harry’s tone held a slight pout to it, Draco narrowed his eyes and took a close look at his love’s body language. There was a slight slump to his shoulders and Draco couldn’t get him to meet his eyes. Ah.
“Well, I had always thought you would have given that rough and tumble life up by now. It’s not suitable for a lady.” Molly took a drink of water to disguise her condescending smirk.
“You said that I could call to them. Pull them to me.” Harry stopped and turned to the impossibly tall being beside him.
“It can be done. The energy it takes to summon them may overly tax you, as you are. It will be easiest when you are near to them. Calling them short distances is easier than pulling them through longer spaces. Though our concept of short and long may indeed be different. Master Harry.” The specter lowered his hood and the face of death shimmered before him into a strange amalgamation of the people Harry loved. Sirius’s grin, Remus’s jaw, Jame’s hair. It tugged at Harry’s heart.
Harry received the inter-departmental memo as he pulled his office door shut. The neon pink paper crane pecked at his glasses until he stopped next to Hermione and Draco’s office door and snatched the enchanted memo from the air. He smoothed out the crumpled paper and skimmed the contents. Great. It was going to be a long night after all.
“Draco.” Hermione moaned. Her hands were working frantically at Draco’s belt when the floo behind her flared to life and Harry stepped into the room. Her hands stilled at the sight of him. He was standing just inside the sitting room, his mouth agape, his hands flexing. Draco pulled her hair and dragged another moan from her.
Draco scoffed and went to snatch the paperwork from Harry. “Of course you would finish before everyone else. Typical Potter.” He muttered as he looked over the forms as if questioning their authenticity.
After a quick shower and brushing of her teeth she emerged to find her boys tangled tightly together in their sleep and a smile crept over her face. Harry had come home late to find her and Draco curled tightly into each other’s embrace, sleeping on the sofa. Harry had woken them in his excitement to announce to them that Severus had done it. He had saved Dean’s life with his talents. They had saved his life. A life that had only been in danger because he had the misfortune of being her coworker. She knew Draco felt responsible, as he had put the cake out for everyone, but she had done her best to reassure him that the only one at fault was the one who had sent her the confection. Hermione moved closer to the bed and rested a hand on the footboard, watching their peaceful sleeping faces as her thoughts slipped to a darker place. Because she was here, they were in danger. Because she was a part of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement every one of her coworkers was in danger. The person who had sent her that cake wanted her life. She couldn’t let the people she loved get hurt by protecting her. She would have to leave so her boys wouldn’t be targeted.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“Where did you hear that name?” Her voice was tight, her hands stilled as she stiffened beneath him.
Harry’s glare faded into a sheepish smile as he holstered his wand, “Of course not Susan, I don’t need to use magic force him to do what I want him to do. We went through a war together, he knows exactly what I’m capable of. It was a simple langlock.” Harry flopped back down onto the bench and rested his head on Hermione’s shoulder. “He’s going to be the death of me, I swear.”
“Of course, Mione. I’ll pick you up for lunch from your offices and we can discuss your return home.” Ron’s voice had a tone of command and he released her as Percy sidled up with a cough and a “Pardon me, Auror Granger. Ronald.”
Longbottom’s wand was out and with a slight motion he cast a silencing charm Draco recognized as his godfather’s signature ‘muffliato’ silencing charm. A pang of anguish hit him like a sack of bricks. “Ron, you shouldn’t bring up things like that, we invited you because regardless of the choices you’ve made, you are still our friend.” Longbottom glanced at Draco pointedly, effectively diffusing his anger at Weasel, before continuing cautiously, “Everyone at this table has made mistakes that they aren’t proud of.”
“Green isn’t a good shade on you, Harry.” Draco rubbed his foot against Harry’s leg gently. “Hermione decided to sass me, so I threatened to turn her over my knee. It was nothing terribly intimate, love.”
At that moment a sweet meow that almost resembled the word ‘mum’ sounded from the doorway to the kitchen. Crookshanks sauntered into the room as if he owned it and jumped up on Draco’s lap, drawing an ‘oof’ of pain from the man in the process. He pulled at Hermione’s sleeve with his claw and purred loudly. The tension in the room dissipated as she reached down and picked up her beloved familiar.
The crowd around them milled more slowly than usual, as if hoping to catch the latest drama first hand. Hermione’s eyes scanned the atrium looking for a quick way out of the situation. They fell upon a concerned looking Percy Weasley, he seemed torn between letting things play out, as he knew she was no damsel in distress, and coming to her rescue because the entire family was intimately aware of how their “love story” had unfolded.
“George said it, while he was talking to himself. Odd name for a person, Gred. I wonder if it’s short for anything.” He rubbed his face against her hand to encourage her to continue petting him. Honestly, it was as if he was becoming more cat-like as time went on. Crookshanks was clearly a bad influence on him.
“Granger, it’s well past the end of work day, no one expects you to be looking fit for a gala or anything. We are all, mostly, still in our work things. If it makes you...” Draco sneered at the word, “feel better... then I can assist you in freshening up.” A crease formed between his brows as they knit together. His brain was clearly working on an argument that would get her up out of their office and into a pub with their friends. She let out another groan and stood, collecting her Auror’s cloak and settling it across her shoulders before pushing past Draco on her way to the lifts.
“Oh, Holly, come sit down, please?” Hermione gestured toward a chair in front of her desk. “I must ask you some questions, so we can clear this all up, yeah?” She smiled at the shaking elf and turned her attention to the stern gaze of Mr. Patil. “Mister Patil, please, have a seat at my partner’s desk, this may take some time to finalize the details of Holly’s return.” She sat and began taking notes as she interviewed Holly about her unexpected disappearance from the Patil household. Through her questioning Hermione noted how nervous and mobile Holly tended to be, the stuttering when she answered a question about her elf family, the general nervous energy that almost came across as a lie to her auror senses. But why would Holly lie about an ailing relative, no, that didn’t make sense at all.
Harry grinned and pulled the stack to him, glancing through the reports, diagnostics, and meticulous process of elimination attached behind the progress report. Of course, this would only be a copy as Severus always kept originals for his own records should the reports be somehow ‘lost’ and refused compensation as they often were when he first began. Harry was hit with a wave of nostalgia and smiled up at the dour man.
“Ronald, whom I can and cannot get along with is well beyond your grasp. You do not know me nearly as well as you believe.” Hermione glared at Weasley, her hands found a home on both Harry and Draco’s thighs to stay their hands. She clearly didn’t want to air their personal grievances in a public setting.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
Harry smiled at Severus’s back and made his way to the sinks where there were four cauldrons piled up in various states of grime. He began to scrub silently as Severus worked on the brew. It had taken years just to get him to allow Harry into his lab, let alone touching any of his personal equipment without his supervision.
Molly’s smile dropped and she wrapped her hands around her cup. “So this is an official visit, then, Auror Malfoy?”
“Oh, come on.” Hermione pulled both men from the office by their wrists and half-dragged them to the pub to celebrate. They spent most of the night drinking, ribbing, and flirting with each other.
Draco sighed heavily and took a drink of wine. “Looks like it’s just you and I on Date Night, love.” They ate in companionable silence as Hermione did her best not to stare at Draco’s mouth every time his tongue wet his lips or caught a drop of liquid. She failed spectacularly. As his tongue once more slipped out to wet his lips a shudder went down her spine and his lips curled into a smile. Her eyes met his and he raised an eyebrow before standing.
Hermione’s libido had been fluctuating wildly since coming back to herself from the potions and the heat in the room seemed to spike when Draco spun her and pulled her flush against him again. Her body seemed to move on its own, like he had taken control of her, and a shiver of pleasure ran through her.
“Holly has come home. Holly was caring for her mother.” The high pitched voice was timid when she spoke. Her hands shook and her gaze fell to the floor. “Holly has caused much trouble for Miss Auror Hermy Granger. Holly is very sorry.” She pulled away from Hermione and bowed so low the tips of her ears touched the ground.
“I love it when you go all haughty on me.” Harry nibbled on Draco’s neck briefly before being pushed away.
The lift sped backward out of reach as their eyes landed on a gangly red headed man. “Weasel.” Draco growled as he tried to tear open the lift gates. It was useless, of course, since the magical lifts were made to speed you to your destination without interruption. An interdepartmental memo smacked him in the forehead and Harry snatched it from the air and read it, pocketing it for later.
Master of Death was a title that Harry had hoped to never use again in this lifetime, but from what Hermione had confided to him it seemed as though one of the hallows had come into George Weasley’s possession. Harry’s position as Master of Death meant that he was the true owner of all of the Hallows and could call them to him at will. A gift, Death had called it. He could also hear the vague whispers of Death as he went through his daily life. He tuned them out with Occlumency on most days but he lowered his tight control as he stood in the ritual room in the bowels of the ministry.
“If there’s someone to avoid provoking, it’s our girl Granger.” Draco grinned and slashed his wand over the cake while muttering a detection charm. “Well, no sign of a love potion in this one. It should be fine to consume.”
They made their way toward the stairs and Harry cleared his throat. “Sev. Your elastic.” The potions master stilled and his cheeks tinted pink. He pulled the elastic from his hair, letting the straight strands obscure his face and turn his features more severe. Their walk to his office was casual, though the tension in them was anything but. They used the floo in Severus’s office to access the hospital and hopefully save a man’s life.
Harry launched himself at Draco’s lips and kissed him fiercely. “I had given up on her, for his sake. For the sake of a found family and her happiness I had let her go. You and I made it through their travesty of a relationship and built our own from the ashes of our past. She may never love us the way we do her, even if she wanks to us occasionally, you know.” He pressed his forehead to Draco’s and took a deep breath. The heavy conversation deflating his libido.
It was with minor trepidation that Harry passed through the threshold to Valere Apothecary, the owner was known to be unpleasant when pulled from work he deemed more important than the interruption. No one at the department would step foot in the apothecary without at least one shot of whiskey and a damn good reason. Harry knew that his inquiry was the most interesting thing to come across the exacting man’s desk in the last ten years. It wasn’t every day you were asked by the Ministry of Magic to suss out the origin of a poison, find its antidote, and help trace potential sources for ingredients.
“I’ve been to every magical bakery we could find. Nothing. At all.” Draco muttered into her denim-clad thighs before turning his face toward her. Hermione’s heart clenched and she set her book onto a side table without a care for marking her page. She reached down with both hands and smoothed his white-blond hair back.
Warmth crept into Harry’s heart and chased away the weariness of the day at the sight of his Draco and Hermione welcoming him home as if it had always been this way.
“No, Ron, we ALL have made choices in our lives. Draco did the best he could in his situation. We have all had it out and forgiven him.” Longbottom levelled a glare at Weasley. “You don’t get to pass judgement on others as though you’re blameless. Your mistake is at least as grievous as his. So tell me, if you think we shouldn’t forgive him why would you think should we forgive you?” Longbottom could be especially ruthless when he needed to drive a point home. Everyone at the table knew about Weasley’s abandoning Harry and Hermione when they needed him in the hunt to take Riddle down.
“Come on love, let’s get you into bed, yeah?” He turned to look at Hermione and tilted his head. She nodded absently and allowed Harry to lead her up to her bedroom. Her mind was racing as he closed the door behind them and turned her away from him as they reached the bed. His hands slowly unzipped her dress and slid it down letting it pool on the floor. He unclasped her strapless black bra and let it fall to her feet, slid his hands down to unhook the garters from her stockings, each small touch sent fire through Hermione’s body and left her throbbing.
“Ah, but where is the fun in that?” Death stilled and a far away look crossed his features. “I apologize Master Harry. Duty beckons.” Then quite suddenly, Harry found himself alone for the first time in a long time. Even the incessant whispering was silenced for the time being. It was honestly a little unsettling being completely alone in his head again. He had gotten so used to trying to ignore Death that he found the sudden silence uncomfortable.
Hermione stood and faced him, rage building in her eyes. Harry had a tight grip on her free hand. “I said, Ronald, That I’m not yours. I have never been yours except under duress. I will never in a million lifetimes be yours.”
“Let’s go see him, I just heard that he’s awake again.” Draco led her into a floo to take her to Saint Mungo’s, none the wiser to the glaring green eyed monster who had witnessed their intimate moment.
Hermione turned to look at Harry with incredulity written across her features. “You’re having me on.” She scoffed and looked back at Draco, “Can you believe this, Draco? He’s not...going to…” Her words trailed off at Draco’s grim expression.
“Better run, Malfoy. She’s a hellion when she’s angry.” Potter laid a hand on Draco’s shoulder and pushed him to face Hermione whose red face was poking out of their office door. Heat rose within him and colored his cheeks. Draco shoved the odd sentiment down and strode toward his office. Potter’s laughter echoed through his mind.
“Hullo Molly.” He gasped out as he tried to disengage from her ample bosom. She always seemed to pull his face down into her cleavage whenever she hugged him. It might have been a subtle plot to assassinate him, except she also did the same to Draco once he had been accepted into the family.
“It’s dangerous and unethical.” Hermione muttered, stiffening her spine and levelling George with a glare. “It’s the same as love potions. It strips the autonomy of the person taking the potion and would lead to abuse in the wrong hands. If you go forward with something like this you need to find a way that the compulsion can be broken by the victim. It’s wrong to force others to do things they don’t want.” Her hands were shaking in her lap but her voice never wavered.
“Don’t blame dad.” Bill frowned at Narcissa. “He doesn’t teach us that particular tradition. I know we’re renowned in pureblood society for turning our noses up at tradition but some traditions are barbaric.” He clenched his hands.
“You always did know how to get your way Harry James Potter.” Her voice came out a little breathy. “Fine. I’ll interrupt your domestic bliss with my presence.” She sat fully up and Crookshanks let out a sound of protest before jumping to the floor and lumbering off into the sitting room. Hermione turned her head and looked up at Harry. “Are you sure it wouldn’t be an imposition? I don’t want to interrupt whatever routines you two have.” She blushed a little as she thought of being the cause of intimate tensions between her best friend and her partner.
Narcissa’s teacup failed to hide her smile directed toward the pair. “Thank you, Alice. Please bring the others when they arrive. Hermione and I are going to have a short chat while we wait.” She tipped a slight nod toward the elf and gestured for Hermione to take the seat at her left.
“Perce is right, it’s like breathing, or reading. She can’t live without it.” George chimed in with a nod.
Severus stood and scoffed as he shook his hand, “She sees me nearly every day, she will not be put out that I declined her gathering of Weasleys. It was for Miss Granger’s sake either way. She does not need my big nose poking into her private life.”
Draco came back to himself with a small centering breath, locking his emotions behind the mask of his ‘auror face’ as Harry liked to call it. He too would need the strength not to grind Weasley into so much bloody pulp under his expensive heel tonight. “Ready?” He smirked down at her indignant expression, watching with pleasure as her mask of indifferent professionalism slid into place. Her terse nod was all the confirmation he needed, he opened the door to the pub and stood aside for her to enter first.
God almighty forgive her but she was going to use a family heirloom as a masturbatory aid.
“Harry! Don’t spoil your dinner date. Draco’s so looking forward to going out to eat with you.” Hermione kissed his cheek and pushed Harry toward the door. “Go and get dressed or there will be nothing left of Malfoy to take out.”
Properly chastised Harry took the stairs two at a time to the master suite, pulling loose his clothing along the way. He waved his wand to summon the “Draco Approved” outfit to hover beside him as he hastily stripped down and changed. In less than ten minutes he had changed clothes, freshened his breath and hair, and made it back to the kitchen in what he considered record time.
Harry’s hand covered hers, and surprisingly so did Narcissa’s.
Hermione, with the poise of an aristocrat, took in his training robes and surely didn’t miss his things sitting on one of the two facing desks. She was surely intelligent enough to make the connection that he was her partner. Her eyes dropped to his proffered hand and narrowed in suspicion. “Malfoy, this is certainly a surprise.” She looked him in the eye and her posture closed off, arms crossed, a signal of protecting herself. Draco tilted his head and smirked. So he still has power over her. She sucked air through her teeth in a quiet hiss and turned on her heel and stormed toward the office adjacent to the head trainer. The one saint Potter occupied as the ‘golden boy’ of their Auror trainees.
“It’s… complicated.” Harry set his wand on the bedside table and knelt in front of Hermione. “Love, we’re worried about you. We have some of the best protective wards here at Grimmauld. The Blacks were so paranoid about being attacked that they have dozens of layers to their wards.” He tried to appeal to her logical side and reached out to stroke down her arm in a way that was meant to be soothing and yet prompted her tears to fall faster.
“Don’t touch her.” Malfoy’s pointy face came into view and Ron saw red.
“Oh Crooks, I was so worried about you darling.” She cooed at the fat half-kneasel, resuming her seat and leaning back to let him lounge upon her chest and purr contentedly. She petted him mindlessly as she drew her anger back into herself and settled in.
“You know that I can’t. Master Harry.” Death said with a grin in his tone, features still obscured.
Draco met Harry halfway to the door and pulled him into a tight hug. “Thank you, now hurry your cute arse up. We still have time to make it without missing our reservation.”
Hermione Granger, of all people, burst into their shared office space. Draco had been awaiting the assignment of his training partner with some trepidation. Merlin, anyone but Potter, please. He had prayed, and how Merlin had a sense of humor. He stood abruptly and took in her perfectly groomed appearance from sensibly heeled shoes up to her tightly wrapped hair piled into a bun on top of her head. “Granger.” Draco swallowed what remained of his nerves and came around the edge of ‘his’ desk to extend his hand in peace.
Harry stepped through the side entrance to Valere Apothecary, pulling his cloak from his shoulders and folding it over his arm. Severus would be expecting him after that note, he was sure. It seemed the pressure he had put on Saint Mungo’s must have worked to give access to Severus for the details of Dean’s condition. With quiet steps he made his way to the basement lab and stopped with his hand on the handle. Harry took a steadying breath and braced himself before he opened the door and intruded into the potion master’s sanctum.
Hermione glanced up at the sharp rap on her door as it immediately swung wide to admit one Mr. Pavan Patil and Holly the house elf. Holly, the missing house elf. Hermione stood, her chair scraping across the stone floor. “Holly!” She rushed around to kneel in front of the little elf in a rather pretty dress. “Oh, Mr. Patil, wherever did you find her?” Hermione reached out and grasped Holly’s hand as if to prove that she was actually in her office.
Harry pried Hermione from Arthur and took her through the floo, leaving Draco to say their goodbyes.
“Oh, the usual. Conquer all humans, enslave them to their rightful feline overlords, build temples honoring our new masters.” Draco was taken by surprise as Crookshanks bashed his squashed face into his chin and rumbled a deep satisfied purr before sauntering off to parts unknown.
Draco threw himself dramatically into the chair opposite Hermione and sighed heavily.
Harry took the steps two at a time until he reached the second floor and nearly ran to his bedroom. His heart was pounding and he was fully hard, painfully hard. The next few months might turn out to be torture after all.
Draco raised his hand from its place atop Hermione’s and reached across her shoulder to stroke his boyfriend’s messy black hair in an intimate gesture of comfort. This wasn’t the first time Weasley had tried to break the two of them up and it surely wouldn’t be the last. A pang of guilt thrummed in Draco’s chest at the rift his presence in their life was causing, and yet he couldn’t feel more than mild regret at being the point of contention breaking up The Golden Trio. This was as the world was meant to be from the beginning. Draco had always been inexplicably drawn to those jade green eyes from that moment in Madam Malkin’s robe shop. It was a shame he had ballsed it up that first day, and again at the start of school, but the past couldn’t be changed. He heaved a sigh and relaxed into his partner’s side, her presence soothing his irritation. He had them now, it didn’t matter that it had taken years too long to win them over.
A smile spread across Harry’s face as he saw the slight blush creeping across his lover’s cheeks. “We wouldn’t love her if she wasn’t the kind of woman to fight for what she believes in. To face the dangers of the world head on and make them bend to her will.” His thumb stilled and Draco glanced up at him through his impossibly blonde lashes in confusion. “We will protect her, make no mistake about that. But Hermione will not sit back and let us treat her like a princess in need of rescue. She will be right there, by our sides, as the three of us vanquish the evils of the world.” Harry reached up and caressed Draco’s cheek, the memory of the slap Hermione had given his lover in their third year brought a smile to his face. “She has never let someone push her around, not even us. Whoever did this to her apartment will pay dearly and he should pray to Merlin that we manage to find him before she does.” Harry smirked, releasing Draco’s face and leaning back in his chair. The twilight spilled through the kitchen windows as they were lost in thought.
“One last question Molly. How do you feel about Hermione and Ronald separating?” Draco watched her expression sour. Her hand tightened around the handle of her tea cup.
“Draco, how are you getting along in the department?” Neville Longbottom smiled pleasantly at him trying to dispel the tension at the table. Draco took in the lean form of Longbottom critically, he had recently finished his training and transition into Hogwarts professor and scholar.
Harry laughed and shoved Draco’s hand away, turning Hermione to look up into his eyes. “I asked Kreacher to try and keep you here at home if you tried to do something noble and foolish like leaving to spare us. It seems like you couldn’t resist saying goodbye to him.” He leaned forward and rested his forehead on hers, their eyes closing at the proximity. “I know you, love, I knew at some point you would try and run to spare us.” He stroked his thumb against her cheek as he spoke, “I can’t lose you too, Hermione. I’ve lost so very much. I need you to trust us to protect you.” His voice was small and vulnerable at his declaration.
“Alice.” Hermione turned in Draco’s grip and smiled at the trainee. “Sorry you had to see that.” She nodded to the girl and turned back to Draco. “We were going to see Kensington. He wanted you and I to teach a class or two. Dean has been telling tall tales of our might.” Draco pulled her toward the ministry’s exit. The stares of the gawkers following them.
“We’ll have to trust her to handle herself until one of us can make it back to the atrium. He won’t hurt her in the middle of all this. He’s probably trying to shame her by causing a scene at her work.” Harry rubbed Draco’s shoulders to soothe him.
Suddenly there was a blossom of warmth in her chest. A pair of familiar grey eyes were suddenly in her vision, taking up most of what was left that wasn’t blackened around the edges. Warmth landed on her shoulders and she was vaguely aware of words breaking through the humming. Then suddenly her thoughts stilled and she could feel him there, in her mind. A cascade of warmth and light chasing back the negativity.
“If you mean those words, you may very well come between us this morning, Granger.” Draco growled and wrapped his arms around her waist, pulling her to her feet and leading them all toward the bed they had shared in a very different way just last night.
“Well, are you coming or not Malfoy?” Hermione shot back over her shoulder, her nose raising ever so slightly into the air as her heels clicked on the marble floors. His throaty chuckle followed her as she pressed the button to summon the lift. His hand fell on her shoulder and she flinched on instinct. “Do we have to, really?” Her voice came barely above a whisper as she relaxed into his touch.
“He seems to love you almost as much as he loves her, you know.” Harry leaned in and kissed Draco soundly. “I’m glad you two can get along. His opinion is very important.”
“If you two are quite finished. I have an announcement. Robards has given me the final signature and I am officially an Auror starting tomorrow. Can we please go get a drink?” Harry was on the verge of begging. Hermione had been spending more of her free time with Ron lately and he missed seeing his best friends. Though he was happy that their relationship seemed well, the amount of fighting between them seemed to be dwindling into something more comfortable as the relationship went on.
“Get! Out!” Hermione screamed and slashed her wand through the air, a jet of shining light barely missed Bill who was quick to dodge and slammed into Ron’s back, propelling him forcefully through the open door and slamming it behind him.
“Oh! I heard about that. You had some great row that went down in the training history books. When was it? Your second month, right? Heard you busted out the Judo moves and knocked him flat on his arse in front of the whole class.” Alice’s entire face lit up in excitement.
“Ginny, of course, needed to be taught all of the domestic spells and skills she would need to catch a man and keep him.” Molly smiled and sipped her tea. “I tried teaching Hermione at the same time but you know how independent she is. Never wanted to be a bother.”
“Protect me?” Hermione’s voice was dangerously low.
“On to happier topics. Mister Potter, just when do you plan on making an honest man out of my dragon?” Narcissa smirked as the boys squirmed under her scrutiny.
Hermione buried her face in Harry’s neck and wept. Their words filled her with warmth and a feeling of safety as she was nestled in their arms. She had spent so much time convincing herself that it would be easier for everyone involved if she just left without a word and distanced herself from everything until she could find the culprit. But these two men had become her home before she had even realized. They had let her into their homes and, it seemed, into their hearts and had never even hinted that they loved her as much as she loved them. She pulled back and lifted slightly to put her weight into Draco’s lap, she pulled Harry toward her and let out a small sob of happiness as she pulled him into a gentle kiss, trying to push all her love for him through that small connection between their bodies.
Draco sipped his coffee as he awaited his accomplice’s return from his target’s bedroom. He had grown rather fond of that orange ball of fur and took to testing the limits of the kneasel half of the cat’s intelligence. Cats themselves were already intelligent without the benefit of a magical feline added into the mix. It seemed Crooks understood far more human language than he let on.
“Yeah, a hundred years ago Draco.” Harry interjected as he loosened his tie.
Hermione rubbed his back as a way to distract herself from the conversation, she couldn’t bring herself to look any of the Weasleys’ in the eyes as they talked about post argument relations. It was, after all, how it had started with Ronald. After one of their worst rows at the tipping point in their relationship they were taking time to cool their heads and when she returned home he had plied her with an apology drink that contained a small dose of love potion. They had had amazing make up sex that night and the euphoric feeling had lasted well into the next day.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
A groan escaped her lips as she struggled to find a comfortable position to relieve the throbbing down below. There was nothing for it, apparently, she would just have to take herself in hand to solve the problem.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“Well, I haven’t really had the time to come by for brunches. Being one of the top aurors in Harry’s department keeps one busy.” Hermione took another bite of her eggs and smiled demurely at Molly.
Sorry for the long gaps between chapters. Things are hectic as usual but I hope you enjoy this update and with any luck the next chapter won't take months to be added. Special thanks to my husband for the terrible puns involved in this chapter. And as always thank you all for your kind comments, I'm glad you're enjoying the story.
Draco collapsed back onto the sofa and watched his partner pace, it was routine for her to lose focus on the world around her as she worked on a problem. He pulled his wand and gave it a casual flick to pull the coffee table out of the way of her shin as she passed too close. It seemed their night would be spent working out what he had overheard and the significance of it. It would be a long night to go with his even longer day.
“Well, Most of the boys showed no interest in baking, or cooking in general, with the exception of Charlie when he decided to join the Dragon reserve and would have to cook for himself most days, of course.” She gazed down into her tea, “Ronald wouldn’t lift a spoon unless it was to eat something, he needs a woman in his life to do those sorts of things for him. It’s why I thought he and Hermione were such a good match, you know. She’s practical and efficient and of course she would be able to run a tight household and keep him in line.”
Time slipped past them, flowing ever onward, as they kissed and undressed each other. Harry pushed Draco back onto the bed and wrapped Draco’s legs around his waist, pressing their cocks together and taking them both in hand.
“Now mum, you know Hermione likes her job almost as much as she likes Crookshanks. There’s no sense trying to change that.” Percy jumped to her defense and waved a sausage speared on his fork in emphasis.
Harry laughed and kissed his boyfriend’s cheek. “Sorry Hermes, I kept your secret too well it seems.” He pulled the container out of a stunned Draco’s hand and distributed the contents onto their plates as his boyfriend did his best imitation of a fish. They were just sitting down to eat when the floo chimed and a voice called “Head Auror Potter, are you in, sir?” Harry groaned, cast a stasis charm over his plate, and went to answer the call. Everyone in the office knew not to bother him on Date Night.
Hermione strolled into the auror department with an air of nonchalance she didn’t really feel, a side effect of working with Malfoy for nearly five years she supposed, one didn’t work with someone so in control of themselves without at least learning to project the illusion of feelings you don’t actually feel. She heard a crash from her office and scoffed. “Honestly. Boys.” She pushed the door open and her eyes fell on Draco throwing one of his many tantrums. “Are you quite finished?” She closed the door behind her and took a seat at her desk.
“Don’t. Speak.” The hunched form of the master potioneer spoke softly but his tone still came across as a command. Harry moved as quietly as possible to the chair and perched upon it. Waiting. The following minutes were silent save for the soft sounds of a potion stirring and the clink of metal on metal as the stirring rod was tapped clean on the edge of the cauldron. The decisive swish of a wand and finally the click of heels approaching. Harry looked up into deep obsidian eyes and smiled, with one eyebrow raised in question.
“Ah, Trainee Alice Addams, right?” Hermione stood and gestured for the young woman to sit.
“Oh fuck off, Draco. The both of you are in danger because I’m here with you.” She huffed up at him, a glare settling into place.
“Yes, Malfoy, what can I do for you?” Hermione asked, one eyebrow raised, as she sat back in her chair and turned her body to face him in interest. What could he possibly be interrupting her report-writing for?
“Harry, come get your stupid boyfriend out of my hair. Before you’re one auror short starting tonight.” Her annoyance was palpable and brought a smile to Harry’s lips. Clearly Draco had taken to bothering her to alleviate his boredom while he waited on Harry to come home. Draco was likely already dressed and primped to go to dinner, he had a thing about being on-time really meaning that you’re late. Harry had always thought that rich people were all about being ‘fashionably late’, but that was apparently a muggle custom only.
“Now, now, that’s not true. We were great together. We were going to settle down and start a family before you got all this nonsense put in your head.” Ron finally shook Malfoy off him and walked toward Hermione, reaching for her until yet another hand pulled him back. It was Bill this time. Ron glared up at his brother.
“What the fuck Kreacher?” Harry swore as he jumped up, wand pointed at the door, his eyes adjusting to the blurry shapes of Kreacher and what looked like a balled up Hermione. As the shock wore off he pulled on his glasses.
“I stopped by Wheezes on the way home. Saw George.” Draco sighed and shuffled down the sofa to lay his head on her lap and stare into the fire. Honestly, he was acting just like Crookshanks when she’d spent too long at the office. Hermione petted his head, waiting for him to continue, whatever had happened today seemed to bother Draco more than their usual work. “Got there around closing time, no sign of anyone so of course I went for the office. But George’s voice was coming from the lab. I had assumed he was meeting with Verity, but I only heard his voice. Hermione, it was so strange. It was like he was having a conversation, not just talking to himself.” Draco rolled onto his back and gazed up at her. “The cadence, the tone, and the pauses as if he was listening to someone else speak. It was so strange. Verity was out on the sales floor restocking. She made it seem like this has been happening frequently.” He stilled as she ran her fingers gently over his face.
George heaved a sigh and slumped in his chair. “Honestly. Ron’s at the top of my list, but something like poison just seems so out of character for him. Believe me, Malfoy, I honestly think that he would never do anything to hurt her.”
“George! You have company. Stop being a hermit in that lab of yours.” With a flick of her wand she locked the doors and flipped the sign to indicate their closure.
“I know, Harry, but she has to know that we care enough about her to protect her from harm.” Draco frowned down at his tea as he spoke. “We can make her see the sense in staying here, where it’s safe, while we investigate. Especially since neither she nor I will be on this case. You will have to be the one funneling us, her, information about it.” Their eyes met and Harry nodded slightly.
“Granger, you know those potions are perfectly legal. Though I’m surprised that he could get his hands on that much of it to keep you madly in love with him for five years. It’s not like they are cheap, you know.” Draco smiled and shook his head, ushering her out of the lift and matching his long stride to her pace, “I know for a fact he lacks the proper ability to brew anything even resembling a potion, so it must have bankrupted him.”
Draco nodded, “Mrs. Weasley, how skilled are your children in baking?” His lips thinned in distaste at having to ask the question.
“Mione! You came home. I knew you would come to your senses.” Ron reached out to grab Hermione’s shoulder when a hand wrapped around his wrist and pulled him back.
“Of course I do. You may be a peacock, but you’re mine. I don’t know where we would be without each other. Plus, you’re pretty skilled.” Harry winked. No subtlety at all, clearly his Gryffindor showing through after the years. Despite Draco’s many efforts to bring out his Slytherin side there were some things that his love would never be subtle about. Innuendo wasn’t Harry’s strong suit.
“We need to impress on Severus the importance that Auror Thomas lives.” Kingsley turned to face Harry with a grim expression.
“Harry James, you are the head auror, you can grant me clearance to go back home if you choose.” Hermione set her shoulders and pushed out her chin. “There is no reason I have to impose upon your kindness. I have a perfectly serviceable apartment.” Hermione pulled her hand from Draco’s grasp and stared down her best friend.
They exchanged their goodbyes and Draco walked from the bake shop toward the nearest apparition point. He turned on his heel and apparated away to a lopsided house in Ottery St Catchpole.  Draco knocked on the door of the burrow and released the transfiguration on his auror robes, the investigator’s suit melting away to reveal the vibrant green of his auror robes.
“What was that darling?” Ron craned his neck past Malfoy’s shoulder and gazed down at his treasure.
“I had suspected, you know. But we lived in a time where there was no such thing as an unwilling man. If he could rise to the occasion then that was a sign he was willing.” Narcissa clutched her skirt hard. “Arthur was in the same year as Lucius, I was a few years behind them in school. It was a shock that Arthur and Molly’s wedding happened so soon after they graduated and then shortly after William was here and everyone had moved on. It seemed so foreign to me, wanting to have a child so quickly out of school and when I counted backward I knew why they had moved their courtship up.” Her gaze fell on the three of them and she gave them a weak smile.
“Granger! I think I’ve got a lead on...Holly?” The door swung open as Draco strode confidently into the room only to stop in his tracks at the sight of their missing elf. “Well, hello there darling Holly. You have come home, then?” He sent a dazzling smile at the elf and took her hand, bowing low over it as if to kiss her knuckles. Her trembling increased at the polite greeting. His glance caught Granger’s and he noticed her suspicion in them.
Hermione stepped out of the floo, into a beautifully decorated sitting room overlooking the sea. Light spilled in through the open windows, a gentle breeze swirling through the room carrying the smell of a delicious dinner mingling with the scent of the sea.
“Harry! You ordered him to keep me prisoner here?” Hermione gazed up at her best friend, tears beginning to streak their way down her cheeks.
The pair snuggled tight under the blankets, Harry resting in the crook of Draco’s shoulder, and they drifted off to sleep secure in the knowledge that come what may that they would work toward Hermione’s happiness, along with their own, no matter the shape it took.
Harry couldn’t help the smile that tugged at his lips. “Oh, Draco, don’t get jealous. I’m sure you two aren’t far behind me. You’re always right there, aren’t you?” Harry leaned in close to whisper in Draco’s ear as he took the papers back. For some reason proximity to Harry always threw the blonde man off balance and since Harry had discovered this fact he tended to invade Draco’s personal space on principle.
The gears in Narcissa’s mind were obviously turning as she frowned down at her teacup. A commotion came from the house moments before the French doors burst wide and a gaggle of men made their way toward the table. Draco led the unruly group of Weasley men and his boyfriend toward the table with the calm and patience of a monk. The smirk curling his lip a dead giveaway for the humor in the shock on Hermione’s face.
Harry stilled and looked down into the tempestuous eyes of his lover. Nodding he took a few deep shuddering breaths and he released his grip on them. Settling back on his calves he stroked the outside of Draco’s thigh to help settle him.
“Hermione, please tell us how the latest case is going. The Prophet doesn’t give many details, unless of course they are gory and sensational.” Neville smiled encouragingly at the witch nestled in Draco’s side. Hermione launched into a detailed explanation of the non-confidential parts of their investigation and his eyes met Harry’s over top of her head. Harry’s indulgent smile caused Draco’s heart to quicken and a blush to creep up his throat and color his cheeks.
No one spoke for several moments.
“As well as can be expected, Longbottom. With the exception of Harry and Hermione I am still mostly persona non grata in the department, though the frost is finally thawing the more impossible cases they shove at us.” Draco smirked at the minor boast about his and Hermione’s abilities at solving nearly every case thrown their way. “The department has been giving us their worst, and we continue to come out on top.” He wrapped his arm around Hermione’s shoulders and threw a smile at her. “Hermione has incredible insights and drive. Looks like they knew what they were doing when they put us together.”
“Mistress is attempting to leave the safety of home. Kreacher cannot allow her to leave. Masters have ordered it.” He bowed deeply, his bony hand still wrapped around Hermione’s wrist as she struggled against his grip. Tears welling in her eyes.
Chapter 8 - Mourning Comes Early
“Oh relax George, it’s Sunday. Even if I sent the order in tonight it’s not like they’ll receive it until tomorrow anyway. There’s no sense in missing family brunch for it. I’ll just go back after and finish.” Ron pushed past him and went to take his normal seat when he saw her.
At her words Draco ground his growing erection into her bum and bit down on her bare shoulder in earnest, sucking gently to leave a small mouth-shaped bruise behind. He raised up on his knees, pushing Hermione up to hers, pinning her tight between the two of them. He released her shoulder and pulled Harry in for a kiss. “Potter. Make her ours. Make her understand.” His voice was growing desperate as his love swelled within him at her declaration.
That evening, as a way of distracting Hermione from her Weasel problem, Draco convinced her into dressing up with them and getting take-out and having a fancy dinner in their dining room. Harry and Hermione were on a mission to pick up their food as Draco charmed candles to float above the dining table. He was putting the finishing touches on the room when a tapping on the window reached him.
Draco sheathed his wand and nodded to Kreacher. “Seal the room, leave us to work this out, and please make sure Crookshanks gets his breakfast. Thank you for bringing this to our attention.” The dismissal in his words was clear and Kreacher popped out of the room. Draco sat on the floor next to Hermione and wrapped an arm around her shoulder.
Weasley couldn’t leave well enough alone. His scoff broke the jovial mood like a well-timed water-summoning charm spilling over all of them. “That’s a fat load of shite. That Death Eater scum could never get along with anyone that isn’t a pure-blood. His family would disown him if he managed it. Guaranteed that he is just screwing with all of you.” He straightened in his seat, wand suddenly in his hand, and the tension in the room ratcheted up several notches.
“How many times do I need to apologize for today before you let me eat off your plate, Granger? How was I meant to know that we would get pushed out of the servants’ quarters for implying that Holly abandoned the family? Runaway house elves used to be the norm.”
Draco set his tumbler down with a harsh snap of glass on wood. “He has already proven capable of hurting her for years on end without any of us the wiser. Though I have never personally seen him raise a hand to her to beat her, you can’t deny that what she has been through is proof that he is capable of hurting her.” He glared at George and straightened his spine.
Draco scoffed, “Of course it is, Potter. You can hardly hope to woo a witch if you can’t even befriend her familiar.”
Draco straightened in his seat, pen poised to write. “Recently an officer was threatened with a tainted confection. We are trying to find leads about who may have made such a thing. We think it was a person with a vendetta against the officer.” He narrowed his eyes. “The confection had the mark of an artisan, someone who has the skills to create something beautiful, but also deadly. I saw on the net that Muffett’s does custom cakes for events, it’s what brought me to your door today.” Draco sat back and crossed his legs. Watching the man’s brows draw close.
“Oh, she never quite reached my level of decorative magic, she could easily write out a short message like ‘happy birthday’ but it would look nearly illegible. She doesn’t have much patience for the delicate spells involved. Short fused, that one.” Molly relaxed and took another sip of tea, gazing out the back window.
“No. I’m not going to brunch with your family looking debauched. They already tease me mercilessly about the last time.” Draco crossed his arms and pouted.
Draco nearly dropped the container of curry rice on the table in surprise. “You, and Krum?” He choked out. “He was your first?”
“That is odd, not that George doesn’t usually talk to himself, but he usually is just muttering his thoughts while he works.” Hermione smiled down at Draco and carded her fingers through his hair.
“You mentioned the boys, but what of Ginevra?” Draco took a slow drink of his tea, noting that it tasted like the normal tea used daily in the Weasley household. She seemed to still see him as family, then.
“It would go so much faster if I could just help you look. We always figure it out in the end.” She pushed at his shoulder in a wordless gesture for him to get off her legs. She swung them over the edge of the sofa and pulled him up beside her. Draco sunk into her side and intertwined their fingers, seeming to seek out her touch whenever he was having a worse than usual day. Moments like this were becoming more commonplace as the three of them settled into life with her here. Hermione found herself relaxing around them more and feeling less like an intruder or a nuisance as time went on.
“My Lady, Miss Granger has arrived.” The elf pulled Hermione forward by the hand and presented her to Narcissa with a curtsey.
Thank you everyone for sticking with me as this chapter fought tooth and nail to not be written. I've skipped around multiple times in an effort to get past writer's block in this one. I apologize that it took so long to post this chapter. I've started a new job, yay! The only down side is getting used to having a new schedule and also making time to write. So thank you all for hanging in there and I hope this chapter is well received, even though it was difficult to get it written.
The dinner was a somber affair after Arthur’s confession and the Weasleys departed soon after.
Harry strode up to Hermione and kissed her cheek before stealing a bite of her food, chuckling at her cry of protest and slight smack of reprimand on his arm.
“Malfoy!” Hermione called from down the hall.
“I have noticed one soul in particular being called forth on a frequent basis. Frederick Gideon Weasley. Being pulled from his rest by one in deep mourning. He may well lose himself if he can’t stop using it, master.” Death kept pace with Harry as they walked the room.
“Mistress cannot leave. She is in danger.” Kreacher croaked up at her, his face twisted into a scowl.
“You two will take good care of my daughter. Let me deal with the three wayward Weasleys. We will be in touch, son.” With those parting words Draco was pushed into the hearth and sent on his way to comfort the witch he considered his.
“What was that Granger? Another Weasley gift?” Draco shook his cloak out and placed it next to hers and rounded to watch the latest irritant be disposed of.
“She’s right, dear. If you don’t have control over yourself it can leave lasting damage behind. I would recommend you put a very mild compulsion on it that if it is something the person is inclined to share, or do, then it makes it easier for them to say or do those things. If they are unwilling it must not force them. A bit like the way alcohol loosens the inhibitions.” Narcissa’s steely eyes froze George to the spot, the color rising on his cheeks as he realized what kind of things could come of the product as it was. He nodded quickly and dropped the subject. A silence falling over the table.
“Teach me.” Harry whispered and Death reached out to caress Harry’s cheek, a jolt of power rushing through his skin. The power spread through his body, leaving a prickling sensation behind where it touched. Harry’s mind was filled with visions of the previous masters being taught this same summoning. Pulling their magic and their connection to Death into their hands and speaking the name of the hallow they wished to summon. The vision stopped abruptly and Harry found himself on his hands and knees before Death, his chest heaving as he sucked in lungfuls of air. The sensation of drowning had been nearly overwhelming.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry stood and handed the file to Hermione, ushering them toward the door. “Let’s call it a day. Send that for processing, get your new file set up, and let’s get takeaway and watch a movie. I’m exhausted.” He kissed Draco on the cheek and opened the door, shooing them from his office.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“Thank you, Severus. This is thorough as always. I will get you the records you need, including his last complete physical so you can compare.” Harry waved his wand and bundled the reports pages together, shrinking them to fit safely in his breast pocket, and stood. He reached his hand out and waited for Severus to shake it. “Narcissa missed you sorely at this last brunch. Draco as well.”
“You do realize that he will be coming home at any moment to take you wherever it is your little black heart desires, not to mention you deserve absolutely none of my home made pasta. Prat.” She took a sip of her wine to hide her smile as she glanced toward the door.
With his mind set, Harry strode out of the ritual room and made directly for Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes.
“Harry, Neville, I’m so sorry. I told him you would be busy.” Hermione hugged Neville in greeting. “Nev, how have you been getting on with the students? Is it everything you wanted?”
Thank you all for waiting for this update. To be honest I've had it more or less ready to post for the last week or so but I've been waffling over where I wanted to end this one. So I consulted a friend and decided that where it's at now is a good spot to leave this chapter at. I'm grateful to all of you for sticking around with me through this, even though updates are slower than I want them to be. I find myself pulled in all sorts of directions and devoting less time to this story than I had hoped to when I stared it but that won't stop me from completing this story eventually. Thank you all again for the feedback each chapter and enjoy!
“She was. She is. I know that I was being a bit jealous earlier. I’m sorry. I know that we love each other but I can’t say that the love I have for her is platonic anymore. I’ve been putting my feelings for her away for so long that I had myself convinced that she was like a sister to me.” Harry glanced down at his lover’s pale stomach, refusing to meet his eyes.
It would be almost the last time she would be allowed out with ‘other men’ without Ron present to stake his claim.
“Oh I can imagine them now, Granger, mouths agape, eyes wide, pupils dilated, pants suddenly tightening as they gaze upon you in that saucy number.” Draco’s hand tightened on her waist as he skillfully maneuvered her around the candlelit space. “Does it amuse you, to know that you drew the gaze of all of them tonight?” He smirked down at her, noting her brown eyes dilating as he pulled her tight against him.
Thank you everyone who has commented and left kudos and bookmarked the story. Sometimes I let my Depression make me feel like I am not enough but knowing that there are people out there enjoying my writing and willing to put up with an irregular upload schedule to read this story helps me chase the Depression beast back. So thank you everyone for your continued support of this story and I truly hope that it's an enjoyable experience.
Hermione made her way to the first floor, stepping over the step mid-way down that always groaned whenever any weight was applied to it. She stepped into the kitchen with a heavy heart and walked toward Kreacher’s room. “Kreacher.” She whispered into the still morning and he popped into existence in front of her.
“It’s almost like he’s trying to provoke me at this point. Levi-o-Sorry. Honestly.” She rested her head on Neville’s shoulder and gave his hand a squeeze.
“Granger, I’m afraid he’s quite serious about the whole thing. You can’t go back to yours until the department calls the all clear on it.” Draco pulled her hand into his gently.
“He can’t be serious. I knew he was dim, his OWL scores told us that much, but I didn’t think he was dim enough to believe that you would actually move back to his place at the first sign of trouble.” He began pacing the small space, his planner held behind his back. “I know that our laws allow his sort of behavior, sometimes even encourage it, but usually the participants are willing. After doing that to you, I can’t believe this. You can’t go back there Hermione.” He stopped and faced her, rigid and exuding righteous fury.
“We just received word from Saint Mungo’s that Auror Thomas’ condition has worsened. If Severus can create an antidote for him then he may just survive this.” Kingsley stood and paced toward the enchanted windows that looked out into the desert. “Whoever sent that cake meant for it to kill Miss Granger. As it stands we will need to make an example of the perpetrator. Even if it ends up being a decorated war hero. Are we understood?” He solemnly clasped his hands behind his back.
Draco had noticed that there were days that George seemed more lost than he had in years. Like there were times where Fred’s memory was so much closer to the surface than usual. Grief, pain, suffering, loneliness, longing, all of those he had thought they had all worked through had suddenly come tumbling back into the ginger man’s life and not even his wife could really pull him from it.
“Miss Hermione Granger,” A squeaky voice drew her attention to the doorway. “Mistress Narcissa is waiting for you in the garden. This way.” The thin house elf turned, her dress whispering as the fabric swished around her. She didn’t wait to see if Hermione would follow, and strode through the house with the ease of someone who has lived in a place for years.
Harry reached over and pulled her into his arms, swaying gently in place. “Oh Hermes, you really just noticed that you do that to men and women? I’ve noticed people looking at you like that since third year.” He glanced up at Draco as he said this, who then decided that the food should be served immediately and busied himself with it, unsuccessfully hiding the color creeping up his throat.
There was a scuffle in the lab and a curse before the lab door was flung open and a disheveled and drawn looking George Weasley stepped out, straightening his waistcoat. “Terribly sorry Verity. Got caught up working on that new- oh, hullo Malfoy.” He reached out and shook Draco’s hand before looking him over. “You look like hell. Let’s grab a drink while we talk. We could probably both use it.” He led Draco through the bowels of the shop and into the owners’ office. George directed him to a plush armchair by the hearth while he arranged hard muggle liquor for them both.
“I will be fine. We should go. I miss the Weasleys.” Hermione smiled at Harry in what she hoped was a reassuring manner. “Besides, Molly does make very good brunch.” The matter was decided and they resumed their preparation for what would be an exciting Friday at work.
Draco Malfoy was at his wit’s end. Hundreds of cake shops in London alone and every one he visited was a bust. He stood outside the last one on his list of places that could have made the cake and took a steadying breath. He would not let his frustration rule him. Setbacks are only ever minor and usually lead them to the right path to go down. He entered Muffett’s Fine Confections with his expectations low and took notice of the pretty girl manning the till. He waited in line as the other patrons plades their orders and when he stepped up before the young blonde girl he nodded. “I need to speak with the proprietor.” He flashed a muggle styled investigator’s badge and watched her eyes widen as she nodded dumbly. He stepped out of line and leaned against the wall nearest the counter.
Percy placed a hand on Bill’s shoulder and smiled at Narcissa, “Father has taught us well that love potions are exclusively used after the problem is already resolved and used as a tool to, well, pardon my phrasing, but for lack of a better explanation, used to ‘fuck and make-up’” Harry choked on his tea hearing Percy the Perfect say the word ‘fuck’.
“Don’t tell me what to do with my fiance, ferret.” He tried to yank his wrist free of the vice-like grip. “She’s come back to me, and now you’re jealous.”
“What Weasley did is still fresh for her. I imagine it’s like waking after a long dream, or maybe it’s more apt to use the descriptions victims of the Imperius curse have given. I’ve heard they can see and hear everything but they are trapped in their minds and can’t control their actions or words. Though I would prefer if it were the former and not the latter.” Draco stroked his fingers over the soft fabric of Harry’s shirt as he spoke, “I don’t want her to have suffered the pain of being lucid through it all.” He clung desperately to Harry for support as a wave of despair washed over him at the reminder that he had not been observant enough to read the signs of her ordeal sooner. Draco took a steadying breath and pushed the thoughts away and laid a kiss on Harry’s neck.
“Harry, was that… Did you… Was that an unforgivable?” Susan whispered incredulously. A smile was barely contained behind her stern look at Harry.
“What do the Weasleys tease you about?” Hermione asked as she sat down at the table, looking prim and proper in her tailored suit. Though the slight frown on her face made her look a bit petulant. “Assuming you were talking about them.”
The words took a moment to really sink in, and the moment she understood them her eyes widened and she turned in her seat to face Draco.
Draco snapped the door shut and locked the room down with a flick of his wand. He took a seat on the edge of his desk and stared at Hermione with a scowl on his face. “That’s convenient.”
Harry closed the distance between them, disentangling her from Draco and smiling at his boyfriend.
“In your experience, how skilled would one need to be to make a shaped cake with a longer message?” Draco finished his biscuit and took another lazy sip of tea.
The elf threw the French doors wide and ushered Hermione into the gardens where a dining table had been placed amidst a courtyard surrounded by a riot of colorful flowers and shrubbery. Narcissa sat at the head of the table, set for nine with gilt edged china, sipping her tea.
“Harry” Draco arched into his touch, the delicious friction pushing them higher. “S-stop.”
“Grease the wheels? Is that what you call it?” Hermione’s hair began to spark and increase in volume. Every man there took an instinctive step back from her while Ginny stepped forward and scoffed.
“You will get up and leave. Right now.” Harry’s words came out quietly but with more force than Draco had expected. The Weasel stood jerkily and beat a hasty retreat. Draco smirked at the mild panic on the Weasel’s face at Harry’s command. Draco’s body was reacting to that commanding tone in his lover’s voice. He would have to make it known later how much he enjoyed that commanding presence.
“Harry. Draco. I’m sorry.” Hermione’s voice was soft as she stared down at the scrunched and pinched face of her cat. “I know that you trust me. You’ve both shown it time and again over the years. I’m being silly, of course.” She glanced up at Draco, whose knees brushed against her own. “I don’t take well to being coddled.”
“Oh and I heard about that time that you and Malfoy raided an entire secret lair full of Death Eaters that were trying to rebuild their following. You both walked out of that warehouse without even a scratch!” Alice nearly knocked over a vase of flowers as they passed by a desk too closely. A quick flick from Hermione’s wand stopped the teetering and rooted it firmly to the desk.
Draco cleared his throat and shook his head. “No, mother, I haven’t accessed the library in some time. Is something wrong?” He shot a glance over at Hermione as if to confirm that she was alright after the spat.
Once the antidotes had been labelled, in Severus’s tight spiked hand, he packed them into a segmented satchel that was padded. “I’ve already finished the other antidote. This one, however, was being a pain in my arse.” He grumbled as he slung the bag over his shoulder and straightened his robes which had been skewed in the brewing process.
“He asked you to go back to him.” He said as he straightened his suit coat. “Of course he did.”
“Harry. Merlin, love. I hate to stop you, but we really ought to talk about this.” He propped himself up until he sat up face to face with Harry.
“Mistress is safe here. Mistress will stay.” He tightened his grip on her wrist and snapped his free hand. The feeling of being squeezed through too small of a space overcame them and she found them transported to the master bedroom. With another snap of his fingers the doors slammed shut and sealed with elf magic. The sound startled the boys out of their sleep.
“Thank Merlin for your paranoia and over preparedness, Granger. I had it isolated down to three potential poisons, but the wrong antidote would have made it worse.” Draco heaved a sigh and rolled his sleeves down now that the crisis had passed.
She reached down and bunched up her black pencil skirt, sliding her knickers to the floor and kicking one foot free to spread her legs wide. She leaned forward over the desk, palm of her left hand flat against the blotter, breasts swinging freely above it, her nipples straining against the fabric of her bra.
Hermione sat back in her seat, crossed her legs in a very Draco Malfoy fashion and glared at Harry across the table, and put more physical distance between them. “Harry, I’m not some shrinking violet. I won’t be intimidated by this. You of all people should know me well enough to understand that.” Her voice held a note of pleading as she spoke.
“I heard that one from Auror Thomas! He said-” Alice’s voice faded out as a dull roar started in Hermione’s ears. Dean. He had been telling stories to the trainees to get them invested. Of course he had. Her finger slipped away from the control panel and panic started to build. Dear sweet Dean Thomas was trying to get the new trainees invested in the program, get them excited about a job that was thankless and emotionally taxing. She had nearly robbed the auror department of one of their best and brightest because of her continued stubbornness. How reckless could she be, coming into work like nothing was wrong when Dean lay on his deathbed in the hospital. How many others would get drawn into the madness with Ronald before it was enough? How many lives had to end for her to be satisfied and just quit the department and deal with him? Hermione’s eyes glazed over as she spiralled into negative thoughts and panic, each feeding the other until her breathing was coming in panicked gasps, her vision tunneling. The world dimmed and the only thing she could hear was the thoughts as they spiralled out of control and went down countless horrible tangents.
“He’s not denying it Nev, he stood by and did nothing while Hermione was tortured in front of him by his crazy auntie. He probably got off on it later that nigh-” Weasley’s sentence was cut off abruptly and Harry’s wand was pointed directly at the Weasel’s freckled face.
Draco had his wand levelled at Kreacher, a sneer on his face. “Explain.”
Draco wrote down everything and snapped his notebook closed. He stood and extended his hand to the manager. “Thank you, sir, for your time. If you could have Mary get in touch with me, I would appreciate it. Here is my number. I would like to speak with her in person the next time she is available.” Draco pulled a pressed linen business card from his pocket. To muggles it would display his cover identity as an officer but to magicals it would display his information as an auror and how best to contact him with further information.
“Potter could you get the-” Severus paused as he looked up to find the sealing wax and labels on the workbench next to the vials. “Nevermind.” He deftly bottled the antidote into the phials and set them aside where he noticed, out of the corner of his eye, Potter was stopping and sealing each with a care he hadn’t shown in his younger years.
Harry shook his head as he made his way to the storage cabinet where he knew he would find the extra phials. Everything in Sev’s lab was meticulously organized and so Harry easily found them on the third shelf down, fourth over from the left. He pulled four phials out and brought them to the right side of the cauldron and went back to retrieve the sealing wax and labels without being prompted. This wasn’t the first time he had played errand boy to Sev while he was finishing up a ministry order. Though many would have thought it beneath someone of Harry’s station he found it endearing that the intractable potions master trusted him enough to handle small tasks and ease a bit of the burden off the man.
“I’m not sure if it’s still binding, so I won’t give you any details, but suffice to say that Hermione can be very, very, scary. You may have noticed her handiwork on Marietta’s brow. Should have happened about the time she opened her fat mouth to Umbridge.” George gave an involuntary shudder and took another drink. “But that’s really the only ones, aside from the rabble you two lock away, that might hold a personal grudge. Haven’t seen either of them in years though so it might just be nothing.”
“Yes, it seems that Holly was allegedly called away suddenly and quite urgently by her ailing mother.” Hermione crossed her legs and clasped her hands in her lap. “You’ll see in the report that I’ve noted my suspicions on the matter and with some intelligence given by Draco after Holly’s interview it leads us to believe that she was taken.”
Draco Malfoy was having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day. He had been chasing down leads from bakeries all day and none that he had come across in wizarding London had made a cake in the shape of a feather. He had exhausted all magical leads and would have to turn his search to muggle bakeries, but that would have to wait until morning. With luck he would find muggle bakeries to be more accommodating without his reputation to precede him.
Draco stepped forward and took a seat directly in front of her, reaching through the small space that separated them he grasped her chin and tilted her face until she met his eyes. Satisfied with what he saw he spoke softly, “The team checked over him, he’s here with us. He’s off terrorizing some unsuspecting creature, I’m sure. He will eventually deign to grace us mere mortals with his presence now that you are awake.” He smiled impishly at the implication that Harry and he were below Crookshank’s notice.
Draco laughed and shook his head. “You know, I still can’t believe that you put up with me.”
The silence stretched comfortably between them until Draco raised his wand to levitate the pot of tea over to the table and poured himself another cup. “What use is it if we can’t keep her safe? We have to convince her to stay with us until it all blows over. She won’t accept it easily, she’s a headstrong Gryffindor after all, but you eventually saw sense and cohabitated with me.”
Weasley fumed silently, crossed his arms, and glared daggers and Hermione and Harry. As though this was all their fault for not taking his side in this argument. “At least I didn’t torture people for fun.” He spat.
“If you would just listen to understand, and not to rebut, then you would see that I am clearly right.” She hissed, slapping the top of her desk for emphasis.
“Draco! Please!” Her legs collapsed from beneath her, leaving her heaving and panting on the desk, eyes closed as her orgasm rocked her. She missed the soft click of the door shutting and the creaking of the stairs as her unintended audience left her to come down in ignorance.
“Mother, please never say ‘rise to the occasion’ again.” Draco groaned which dragged a laugh from Hermione and a snort from Harry.
Draco slowly meandered toward the office, Hermione’s shouting was abruptly cut off with what he assumed was a ‘Silencio’. The nearer Draco drew to the door of Potter’s office the more the offices around him buzzed in conversation. His eyes rolled as he scoffed at how little discipline his fellow trainees had. Gossiping the first morning of the first day. Draco tried the door on Potter’s office but predictably they had locked it, so he crossed his arms and waited. It wasn’t long before the door swung wide and a soft body was crashing into his and shoving him aside. Hermione squeezed past him and huffed off toward their office. Draco’s attention was drawn by a throaty chuckle to the amused green eyes of one Harry Potter, the boy-who-lived, the savior of wizarding kind, and fellow trainee auror. “You are going to have your hands full with her, Malfoy. Though, we’ll have to see if you make it through this training program. You’re not very popular around here.” Potter stood and crossed to the door and into Draco’s personal space while he was talking. Draco was thrown by this and threw a self satisfied smirk at Potter. “Anything you can do, Potter, I can do better.” His line, while a bit of bravado, shouldn’t have made Potter burst into such raucous laughter.
A tall blonde man approached Draco and gestured toward the door to the kitchens. “Please, come to the office, we will have more privacy there.” He walked with authority and did not wait for Draco’s acknowledgement before leading him back to the space smaller than a closet that he called an office. He closed the door after Draco entered and sat behind the desk. “What can we do to help you, officer?”
“Honestly Malfoy, can’t you even dress yourself?” Hermione clicked her tongue at her partner as she straightened his tie. Eyes bent to the task she missed the smirk that passed over his lips.
They both worked in companionable silence until Severus let out a small huff of annoyance. “This blasted thing.” He grumbled as he set his stirring rod on the table with a clang. “This is the fifth attempt and it has only now decided to behave. Bring me the phials. Tri-dose, crystal, bulbous.”
“Now where would you even hear a story like that one? Honestly. That’s pure exaggeration. We were half dead after that fight.” Hermione shook her head as they stepped into the lift.
“It’s from Sev. He’s down to two possible poisons depending on the symptoms. He’s already got both antidotes in progress because the poisons both can kill in seventy two hours.” Harry sagged in relief and let out an incredulous laugh. “He said we had bought Dean another day and a half with that, and I quote, ridiculous habit of shoving a bezoar in anything that’s poisoned.”
“Of course that’s what it’s called Mione. You can’t always be lovey dovey with your husband. There are rough patches and love potions can help you see sense past an argument. Kiss and make up, isn’t that what the muggles say?” Ginny crossed her arms and stood next to her mother, nose turned up as though Hermione was stupid. “It’s not like you and Ron didn’t have your fair share of arguments when you first got together.”
“That was meant for you. He’s going to burn for this, Herms.” Harry’s voice was low and filled with malice. Not usually one for public displays of affection, Harry allowed himself to be embraced by the two whom he loved and let his rage flow out of him.
Thank you everyone for the kudos and the comments on the first two chapters. I have been working a lot of overtime during the holiday season, so this update is a bit later going out than I wanted it to be. I appreciate your patience and support. Please enjoy chapter three. I’m going to try and update at least monthly, but my job seems to not know how to schedule people without running everyone on the team ragged. Thank you all for your continued support.
Hermione made her way down the stairs to her room and began packing her things, careful not to disturb Crookshanks who was napping on her pillow. His yellow eye cracked open in reproach as she dropped something and disturbed his nap. Hermione muttered an apology to Crookshanks and smiled at her familiar sadly. She would leave him here with Draco. They had grown so close in the short time that they had all been together. It was for the best that she find a place to stay alone. She could move from hotel to hotel, throwing the perpetrator off her scent. Hermione glanced around the room a final time and slung her beaded bag over her shoulder. She would leave most of her things here, only taking what she needed for evading whoever was out to kill her. Somehow, even though everything, she had a hard time believing that Ronald would have resorted to murder.
Draco Malfoy heaved a long-suffering sigh as he ran a hand through his platinum blonde hair. “Granger, do you remember what we talked about this morning?” He settled into a challenging stance and stared down his nose at her haughtily.
“No. It can’t be.” Hermione muttered and pushed Draco from her lap. She began pacing the length of the sitting room as the gears in her mind worked over the problem.
The pair stilled as a soft sound from the kitchen door reached them. They turned, almost in unison, to see a groggy Hermione standing in the doorway. She rubbed at her face and eyes as she made her way toward the table. “Harry. Why ‘m I at your place?” She muttered as she flopped down into one of the wooden dining chairs.
“No offense taken Percival. It is the correct way to use love potions, after all.” Narcissa watched Hermione as she spoke. “Love potions were meant to be more of an aphrodisiac that repaired marital rifts and soothed sore feelings so that one could beget an heir. Like your idea earlier, the intention was benevolent but left room for much abuse.”
Hermione dropped her hand to her side. “Maybe we should have compatibility tests for partnering. Malfoy and I were completely at odds at first, you know.” She smiled at the girl and glanced at Draco’s desk, messy as ever in his organized chaos of half finished thoughts.
Hermione looked up from her book as the floo flared green and an exhausted Draco stepped from the flames and all but collapsed across her lap with a sigh. “I take it the search was fruitless.” She reached down and patted him on the head.
“We wouldn’t offer if we thought you would be a bother.” Harry reassured her and ruffled her hair, drawing a laugh from her. “I am going to nip to the loo. You two figure out what we should have for supper.” He made a hasty retreat to deal with the growing problem in his trousers. It had been too long since he last touched her, especially in their emotionally charged states.
“Hermes, let’s go celebrate.” He walked in to find the two head to head in a debate about something he found difficult to follow.
“Mistress called Kreacher. Kreacher is happy to serve.” His voice cracked with age and he swept into a deep bow. Hermione knelt and pulled him into a tight embrace.
“You are worth the headache you peacock.” Harry smiled lovingly as the waitstaff came by and poured their wine and placed salad on their covers.
“Are you going to check the muggle bakeries as well? It could be someone who would stick out in magical London like a sore thumb.” Hermione rubbed her thumb across his hand and rested her cheek on top of his head. She felt him nod against her which made her smile. She had known he would take the next logical leap from the wizarding world to the mundane world.
Arthur smiled at Hermione across the table, “Surprise, darling.”
The fact that her best friend had been looking directly at them when the threat was delivered seemed to act as a catalyst.
A groan sounded outside their little bubble and Draco looked over at Harry who was scrubbing his hands over his face in frustration.
“I thought the Ministry had contractors that were able to look into these sorts of things.” George’s staring was starting to make Draco itch to move. To do something.
“The usual contractor for potions and poisons is breaking it down already. What I came to ask you was if you knew of anyone who would want to harm Hermione Granger. Possibly even kill her.” Draco stared pointedly at George and rubbed a thumb over the cut glass tumbler. “I am doing my best not to automatically assume the worst of a certain red-haired menace. So please, be honest.”
Narcissa set her cup down and reached out to take Hermione’s hand. “Elves have lives and families that are not always tied to one filial line. The Malfoy elves, to keep their magic strong, often have spouses among the staff of other magical families, though usually it’s easiest if the mated pairs are serving the same home. Oftentimes the children are sent to other families to ‘stand on their own’ so to speak.” She leaned back in her chair and placed her hands in her lap. “It is indeed plausible that there was a family emergency, but it would have to be someone on the brink of death to make a house elf disregard their bond to their magical family in such a way...” She trailed off, lost in thought.
He started sliding her stocking down her leg and she turned to face him, “Harry, hurry.” She threaded her fingers through his hair and pulled his face forward into her knickers. His hot breath drew a whimper of need from her. He pulled back and urged her to sit on the edge of the bed with a gentle nudge. He finished pulling off her stockings and stood, gazing down at her glorious naked body, her legs spread in invitation and he groaned. With a flick of his wand a red and gold jersey came sailing out of an unused trunk in the closet, Potter emblazoned on the back. He pulled his old quidditch jersey over her and kissed her softly.

Author’s note: Updates will probably be slow, since I am writing this in my limited free time and this is my first time writing something that isn’t only a straight up slice of life, romance, or smut story. I’m doing my best to put thought into the story I want to tell, how I want to direct the readers, and how many hints I want to drop. Thank you all for baring with me while I try and write a mystery along side my love story. Please feel free to give me feedback as we take this journey together. I’m in your care.
He heard a muffled voice coming from behind the door he knew led into Fred and George’s personal lab from the ground floor. He would likely find George and Verity within discussing his latest experiment. His hand stilled before he could complete his knock, the voice inside was alone, but speaking casually in a cadence that implied conversation with someone else.
“Draco. Please.” Harry’s words echoed Hermione’s own as he pulled at his lover’s tie, crushing their lips together.
“Hermione, please love, look at me.” Harry’s voice began to grow heavy with sorrow and when she refused to look up at him his eyes met Draco’s and he tried to plead with him silently to help pull her out of this.
“We are trying to protect her from whatever sociopath made it past her wards. She will understand that this is the safest place for her and Crookshanks to be.” Draco insisted, “She isn’t stupid.”
Sorry for the long delay in updates. My Depression and Anxiety are double-teaming me lately since I am an essential worker during this pandemic and I live in a third world country masquerading as a first world country. Thank you so much for sticking with me this far and I hope you enjoy this update.
“Yes, Holly was just explaining that her ailing mother had sent for her on short notice and left her no choice but to leave at once.” Hermione’s tone was all business as she glanced over her notes. “It seems our case is closed with her return, Malfoy.” She looked up at Mr. Patil and nodded. “If we have any further questions, or need to follow up, we will be in touch with you Mr. Patil. Thank you again for bringing her to us forthwith. All that’s left is for us to write up the report and close the case with the Head Auror.”
“Thank you, Percy, for taking the cue and coming over when you did.” She sighed and leaned against the wall of the lift. “He heard about the attack on my place. Said he wanted me to come home.” His gasp was loud in the quiet of the private space.
A small moan of appreciation escaped her lips and Harry’s cock twitched. He slowly worked his way away from massaging her. His eyes found Draco’s and there was a heat there as he followed Harry’s motions. Something about locking eyes with him, with her stretched between them, flipped a switch in Harry’s brain. His hands stilled on her shoulders.
Draco had bent her forward over the desk, exposing her to the eyes of anyone who could see out the window behind her. Her juices dripped down her legs in anticipation as he stroked a hand over her ass and down along her quim, teasing her. His hand disappeared from her flesh and moments later came down firmly across her ass, the shock and pain causing her to jolt forward and hit her hips on the desk. He clicked his tongue at her as he rubbed the tender flesh. “Now Granger, be a good girl and hold still for me.” His fingers dipped down and spread her juices up against her backdoor, pressing gently before disappearing again.
“Hermes, you know protocol. You know we can’t allow you to be living at a crime scene, let alone a clearly unsecured location while there is a psychopath on the loose attempting to harm you.” Harry’s face colored as he pulled himself up in his seat and squared his shoulders, readying for a fight.
“With all due respect Kings, it’s Sev. He is the youngest potions master in two centuries. He is quite literally a genius in the field. If anyone can identify the poison, and generate an antidote, it will be him.” Harry sighed and grinned up at Kingsley to try and break the tension. “Severus Snape will have an antidote for us before you can say-” Harry’s shining endorsement of his hated potions professor was interrupted by an owl pecking at one of the enchanted windows designated for mail coming from outside the ministry.
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
“We’ve gotten word that the Patil’s house elf has returned home unharmed.” Draco leaned his weight against the door and crossed his arms with a scowl.
“That IS what partners do, isn’t it Granger? Have each other’s backs when they need it?” Draco realized his mis-step a moment too late and attempted to steer back to a safer tactic. “Harry and I want to support you as best we can.” He grimaced as she pulled her hands away and stood, staring down at him.
“Amuse me? Mm, I suppose.” She smiled and cast her eyes down in a false show of modesty. “It has been a while since I last dressed like this, especially for myself.” her voice came out in a murmur as she laid her head on his shoulder. “It’s refreshing, and a bit exciting really, to see that I can have that effect on people.”
Draco leaned down and whispered intimately into her ear as his eyes caught and held Ronald Weasley’s. “Just remember to breathe, and if he instigates don’t rise to the bait, Granger.” Oh, Draco was going to enjoy taunting the Weasel with what he had done. He glanced at Hermione as she gave a slow blink in his direction, a smile spread across his lips. She was using one of their signals to indicate that she trusted Draco to do what was necessary. He was constantly amazed with how much trust he had been given by both of them. His partners. His smile softened and they closed the gap to the table together.
“Mione, I’m just worried about you. I heard that there was an attack and I went by yours to see if you were alright and it was all boarded off and you were gone.” He loosened his grip slightly and pulled her to face him fully, resting his free hand on her shoulder. “I was so worried about you, I came here first thing. I’m so glad that you’re alright. You should come back home until your place is available again.” His deep blue eyes were pleading and he was rubbing his thumb across her wrist.
Hermione laid her free hand on top of his and sighed. “If I stay they will also be in danger. I can’t endanger them any longer, don’t you understand?”
Hermione fixed her gaze on the plate in front of her, shaking gently. “Not yours.” She muttered.
Trainee Auror Harry Potter had risen quickly through the ranks, with his own skill and hard work he hoped, and was the first to be promoted to full Auror out of their class. Though, somehow Malfoy and Hermione always seemed to be right behind him on the scorecard. Hermione he had expected, but he had never anticipated Malfoy putting in the amount of work that he had. When the paperwork was finalized he approached the shared office of his best friend.
“I do. Because you’re here with me.” Harry scooped his hand up and gave it a squeeze.
“You’re late.” Severus didn’t bother looking up from the cauldron, his hair pulled back with an elastic to keep it out of his face.
“Does the name Gred mean anything to you?”  Draco’s eyes drifted closed and he missed her stricken look at his casual mention of the lost Weasley twin.
“It is true that we have an expert patissier, she is young by most standards to be called an expert. But she can work magic in the kitchen. She has won many accolades but I do not believe Mary would have the disposition to hold a grudge of any kind, let alone make an attempt on someone’s life.” The manager, whose name plate read Kristoffer, shook his head. “Mary is not in today, she teaches two days a week at a children’s shelter nearby. She volunteers her time to those less fortunate and on the outskirts of society. She suffered an accident when she was in secondary school that left her maimed. She pours all her effort into carving a place for herself in this world, and making a name for herself.” Kristoffer leaned forward, steepling his fingers, “She was turned away from many bakeries, because of this. She is our treasure. She would not hurt another living being.”
~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~
He nodded and crossed his arms. “We can’t keep an eye on her, officially, but I agree with your assessment. Something doesn’t feel right about her just popping back up, pardon the phrasing.”
Draco’s pout morphed into a beaming smile as Harry made himself known.
“Granger!” A familiar shout rang out through the floor of offices of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement. Rapid clicking of hard soled leather shoes bounced off the walls, filling the otherwise largely silent room and telegraphing the approach of Hermione Granger’s barely tolerable partner. Hermione’s quill continued rapidly scratching across the parchment form sitting atop her desk. His footsteps came to an abrupt stop next to the left side of her desk. She held up one finger to the man beside her as she finished writing down her thought. The silence dragged on longer than was technically considered polite, the furious scratching of her quill stilled and she took a deep breath. Hermione set her quill in its holder in her inkwell and exhaled, looking up to the ice blue eyes that always seemed to mirror the frosty demeanor of her partner.
“Master. You’ve decided to listen.” A tall robed figure materialized beside him, hood drawn up to obscure his features.
“I'm terribly sorry love, but you’re a bit drunk and I can’t take advantage of you like that.” He stroked her cheek with his thumb, “I won’t.” He pulled away and left her there, nearly naked, soaking wet, needy, and completely utterly unsatisfied.
“Arthur! You can’t do this to Ronniekins. You’re punishing him for no reason. Just for showing up to brunch with us.” Molly pouted up at Arthur. “You’re being silly darling. Let him in and we’ll all sit down to a nice meal.”
Harry opened his eyes and saw in his left palm lay the bright red flame of his own magic, and in his right lay a blue and white flame, the magic of Death. He pulled back from the magic and they slowly faded from his sight. He could do this. He would save George from the madness the Resurrection Stone would bring. Even though it would mean embracing this unwanted power over Death himself. If it would save George, he would do it a thousand times.
“Is Crooks alright?” Her voice quavered, “Draco, he isn’t-” The words got caught in her throat. Unable to voice her fears.
“Oh! Harry. I’m sorry, I didn’t hear you come in.” Hermione smiled brightly and attempted to fix the flyaway hairs that seemed to work themselves loose whenever she got too excited. “Yes, we should go out. We should celebrate.”
“He was lucky that Hermione is always over-prepared. Her quick thinking bought him enough time to find a cure.” Draco crossed his legs. “So, Molly, has Ronald been in contact with you lately? Requested anything unusual from you?”
“Oh, my love, you have no idea yet how skilled I can be. We would need at least one other person involved for that.” He smirked as he slowly ate the first course. He let Harry stew while they progressed into the main.
She hummed and pulled up a case file, flicking her wand and wordlessly spreading the sheafs of parchment through her side of the room on a semblance of a murder board. They had recovered more information about Holly the disappearing house elf, there were no signs of a struggle. It was as if Holly just walked away from her family. Which would be possible if the Patil family didn’t love and care for her as one of their own. “I suppose we should focus on the mission until Harry decides he can’t solve my case without us.”
Harry grabbed a handful of floo powder and tossed it into the hearth of his office, “12 Grimmauld Place” He called out and the green flames flared, propelling him through the floo network and in moments he was stepping out of the hearth in his own living room to the dulcet tones of Draco’s whining. Having a direct floo connection to your office was one of the many perks of heading the DMLE’s Auror Corps.
“Hermione is overreacting. She is making a big deal out of nothing. Occasional use of potions to make up is a normal thing in the magical world. She is only upset because she isn’t aware of magical culture and traditions.” Molly sneered at her tea. “Ronniekins would never hurt her, he loves her. She is blowing things out of proportion. He’s told me, you know, that he listened to Arthur’s advice and only used the potions as he was told. He is a good boy and she is making him out to be a… a… a monster. A brute.”
