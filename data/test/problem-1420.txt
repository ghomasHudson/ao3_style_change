The Ministry of Magic amerced much of the Malfoy funds. Despite this, Draco still had enough to get by without having to join the workforce. His mother had been wise enough to keep his trust in the Black family name.
“How dare you trivialise the war and the people we lost, THE SACRIFICES THEY MADE.” He stood up swiftly, knocking his chair back. “And how dare you try to manipulate me!” He turned his rage on Shacklebolt. “If you want the ministry to be appreciated by the public, MAKE DECISIONS THAT BENEFIT THEM!”
“Er, no. We’re just..” He glanced at Malfoy ordering. Former rivals. Enemies. Pawns on opposite sides of a war neither signed up for. What was Malfoy even doing here with Harry? “Friends, I guess.”
Draco led the way to the back and held the curtain open for Harry.
Malfoy’s grin became rueful.  “I have to say that’s one of the reasons I was so keen on being friends when we were eleven.  I thought if I could have you as my friend I wouldn’t need lots of friends, because I’d have the best person in the world as my friend.”
“Why you’re friends with that bellend.”
“You said that?  You?”
This was met with silence.  Draco looked up after a moment.
“What are you lot talking of so seriously?” Malfoy arrived at the table with the next round. He slid them each a drink. Harry’s was a pint of lager.
Harry debated heading home after.  He had a sore back and was in dire need of a drink.  He wasn’t quite ready for the quiet of Grimmauld Place after the afternoon spent playing quidditch at The Burrow.  Ron, Hermione, and Rosie were knackered when they left. Rosie from being a toddler stuffed with cake. Hermione from being the parent on duty and Ron from getting his arse handed to him in quidditch by his seven year old niece.  Harry felt some residual adrenaline running through his veins in need of an outlet. Harry checked his watch. Draco would be at his pub for another hour.
“And your coffee?”
Hermione wiped a tear from her eye and pulled him into a hug. “We love you Harry.”
“I’ve always been funny.  You’ve just always been too much of a prat to notice.  Those Potter Stinks badges were brilliant.”
“I am not interested in dating at the moment.   Pansy, have you failed to notice my very prominent homosexuality?  I seem to recall a terrible decision from fourth year where we decided to test that theory, met with disastrous results.”
Harry shrugged again.  It was true. If you have no expectations they can’t be disappointed.
Harry shrugged.
“Friday.”
He was going to have to wear muggle clothing.
Harry relaxed his shoulders.  “I think we are, Malfoy.”
Draco felt more comfortable at the Granger-Weasley residence each time he visited.  After his humiliating breakdown in front of Granger so long ago, Draco felt a small and delicate bud of friendship growing between them.  He’d never admit it out loud, but he’d always been something of a swot.  It was nice to have another like minded individual to discuss literature, philosophy, and magical theory with.  Honestly, his latest concoction at Mood had stemmed from Granger’s insistence that alihotsy leaves were more prone to producing mania in potions when they were harvested by those with a sunnier disposition.  Where as a melancholic worker harvesting alihotsy leaves brought the sweetest joy imaginable.  It had revolutionized his aptly named Giggle Water.
“A cookbook!” Hermione exclaimed. “A wizarding cookbook!”
Malfoy turned to stare at him.
“Do you need to see a healer?”
“I’ll take that as a no.” Malfoy wrapped Harry in his arms, and Harry let it happen. Malfoy appearated them to a door front. It wasn’t Grimmauld Place.
“Indeed.”
“Of course."  Harry averted his eyes.  "If  we’re both single next year you’ve got a date for New Year then too.”  Harry meant for it to come out casual.  But the words felt more significant when said aloud.  Somehow, without noticing, they’d moved their bodies closer together, dancing cheek to cheek.  Christ, Draco smelled good.  Harry had to physically stop himself from nuzzling into Draco’s neck, which didn’t seem like the kind of thing that friends did.  He’d certainly never had the urge to nuzzle Ron.  He heard Draco sigh contentedly and Harry's heart skipped a beat.
"I'll have a chamomile, please, Hermione." Lovegood chimed in.  "It's excellent for attracting Flerble Moths."
Malfoy didn’t respond.
“Just the two you met.” Draco replied.
“Alright, Malfoy?” he asked, his voice calm, as though he was pacifying a cornered feral animal.
“I know, mate.  I know.  It’s just..”
Saturday morning, Harry woke up slumped over in the armchair. It must have been early morning, but it was hard to tell for sure. He stretched and rubbed his aching neck. He’s got to stop doing that. Harry grabbed the empty glass beside him and set it on his drinks trolley.  After he shuffled over to the walk-in closet, he dug around the pile of clothes on the floor until he found his pyjama bottoms and a probably clean-ish t-shirt. He swapped out his Auror robes for the comfy, not too musty sleep clothes and then firmly collapsed on the bed. The real question was how long Harry could lie there until his headache outgrew his apathy. He should really go over his schedule before Monday. Instead, he wallowed deeper into his blankets and stared out at the rain.
“Not the food, you plonker.  Your behavior. Although..” he trailed off inspecting his food.
Malfoy sat back in his seat and turned back to the match.  “No you’re not. It’d be all over The Prophet. Saviour of the Wizarding World marries a famous Quidditch Player.  There’s no way to keep that quiet.”
Looking at him Draco felt as though he had finally been shown what life was and his chest ached.  For all the lost time they could have spent fooling about instead of out for blood.  Life wasn’t heavy expectations from parents.  It wasn’t impossible tasks assigned to him by madmen.  It wasn’t desperation.  It was this.  Harry Potter standing on a designer trunk and jumping down to land on his knees, head thrown back yelling at the top of his lungs “Destiny is killing me!  Open up your eager eyes!”
“That is incredible.”  Harry licked his lips. “I mean, it’s not technically illegal, what you’re doing.  But it’s definitely dubious.”
Arthur smiled down at Molly’s head, fondly.
“Yeah. Is this the last of them?”
“I never asked for that! I sodding hated it! And half the time I was only in the paper ‘cause you were giving interviews about me! Calling me off my rocker! Christ, you really were a twat.”
George sipped the flask and made a face.
“You’ve just never been shagged properly.” Harry practically shouted, pointing a finger.
“You can’t expect me to just-” Creevy, still manic, yelled out.
“I think he was up to something.”
Malfoy’s eyes narrowed, “I never said there was anything romantic going on.  You’re the one who keeps trying to chat me up, telling me I’m fit.” he hissed. “Just what I’m meant to do with that information, Potter?”
“You alright?” Malfoy asked casually. As though Harry had stubbed his toe or bumped his head.
“Pansy.”
Harry sank onto the seat of Pansy’s perfectly white leather sofa.  “We used to be just like this.”
“Auror Potter!”
“Merlin, Potter, were you always this incessant?” Malfoy finally looked over at Harry.
Dudley’s head swivelled between the two of them. “Have I stepped in it?” he asked, mild concern spreading over his dull face.
Draco’s back ached. He was distracted this morning and burnt the croissants. He’d had to redo them and it threw off his workflow. Rav was in the kitchen with him all day today, which meant Draco couldn’t use magic. It left him exhausted.
Harry nodded. He needed a hangover potion. He sighed and fell back on Sirius’s bed, closing his eyes.
“No, course not.”
“Magical signature required to open it.”
“No. We’re staying in London.  Haven’t really thought about kids.”  He frowned, “What’s wrong with getting married?  We’re in love, have been for ages.” Harry thought for a moment.  “We tried breaking up for a bit but you just get tired of it.”
Hermione perched on the edge of Harry’s unmade bed. Ron flicked his wand at Harry’s clothes. They flew into the hamper. He gathered up a pile of dishes and padded down the stairs.
“See you around Malfoy.”
“Oi.” Potter shot a warning glance at Draco.
Draco spent more time in the muggle world than he did in the wizarding one.  It wasn’t a situation he’d ever thought he’d be in. He had a muggle job, lived in a muggle part of London, and oddest of all wore muggle clothing.  It took a bit of getting used to. The trousers fit more snugly than flowing robes. He found the ease of throwing on a v-necked t-shirt ever so much easier than the layers required to dress for wizarding outings.  His father would be appalled, he thought happily.
Olivia gently shook his arm.
” he imitated Draco’s pronunciation of the word. “Never once has Draco Malfoy spent his nights brooding over The Golden Boy.”
“Which is why she gets on the plane at the end of the film.” the blonde concluded.
Harry took advantage of Draco’s open mouth to deepen the kiss.  It was Draco’s heart flying through the air.  It was a thousand stolen glances.  It was Draco’s hands slipping under Harry’s shirt and the groan Potter let out.  It was their tongues dancing instead of dueling.   It was Draco nipping Harry’s lip and him losing control.  Hands in hair.  Biting teeth and sliding tongues.  It was too much clothing and not enough skin.  It was every fantasy Draco had since he was fifteen.
Draco coughed. “Ah, yes. Well…” He stood up and snatched them out of Millie’s hand. “Must get to the shower, if you’ll excuse me.” He fled the room, ignoring their snickering.
“Oh fuck off,” Davies said in a sulk.
“Perhaps we could-”
Olivia’s face brightened in surprise. “Are you a pastry chef? That would be lovely!”
Harry looked up to see the cashier staring at him. “Hiya.” he replied, albeit a bit late.
“You thought-” Harry felt the rage welling up inside him again.  “Please let me know the next time you’re giving lessons in apathy.  Teach me how to be like you, The Great Draco Malfoy- Devoid of Human Emotion.”
“Whatever shall we do with our time.” Draco smirked and sank to his knees.
“Doesn’t he?”
George nodded. He took another drink and handed the flask back to Harry.
“Alright.  I’ve a port key”  He drew a bottle cap from his pocket and flipped it in the air. “We’ve got about five minutes.”
Ron echoed, “Total bollocks.”
“Of course not.” Draco lied.
Draco hit his head against the board.  “Merlin’s pants!” he said in exasperation.
“We’re not friends, Potter.  We’re not even acquaintances.”
Hermione and Ron glanced at each other. “Did you see the other list?” Hermione asked cautiously.
“Yes, Harry is rarely drawn to well dressed blonde men.” She said shrewdly.  Granger looked at Draco, really looked at him.  He fully understood in that moment why Wizengamot was terrified of her.  “Luc seems lovely.” she said.
“And why do you want to be friends with an Auror specifically?”
“Why on earth would you do that?" Draco asked.  "Why wouldn’t you just go to the cinema?”
“Mm.  He’s got some sort of a fashion line.”
“Sorry?”
Dudley gestured vaguely with his hand. “You know,” he leaned in and gave Harry a significant look as though this explained everything.
He stood up and Harry followed him to the bedroom.  “Jean called and as we were talking it felt fine.  I knew he didn’t matter to me any longer.  I was well rid of him.  No romantic attachment left.”
“Mmm”  Draco tugged his left sleeve down.
“I am.”
Draco caught his eye “Destiny is killing me” Harry grinned at him.  Draco felt like a helium balloon about to burst.
They were in front of a fireplace.  Draco was holding a bouquet of flowers.  “When did you get those?”
Once everything on the patron side of Mood was set, Draco unlocked the door and flipped the switch for the Open sign in the window.  Pansy adjusted her cleavage in one of the mirrors on the wall. Draco tutted and went behind the bar. She joined him soon after and they finished mixing up their mixers.
“It’s a square!” Weasley shouted, jumping to his feet.  He pointed a long freckled arm at Draco. “Square!  It’s Squared away! Squared away”
The rest was white noise.  Draco didn’t remember the end of the phone call.  Somehow there was a drink in his hand and a knock at the door.  Suddenly Potter was rubbing his shoulders and Draco was in the midst of the breakdown he promised he’d never let himself have. He’d not cried this much since sixth year so of course Harry Potter was there to witness it.  Harry Potter was always there when Draco was at his worst.
“You’re exaggerating.”
The bludger came back around, this time at Harry.  He zig-zagged through the air, losing it around a bit of thicket.
Draco sighed. “Alright.”
in with
“That makes no sense.”
Draco chopped his herbs. “If you’re setting me up with your mates, I don’t see why you’re using a dating app.  And the answer is no.”
“Yes, Harry, Yes!” He punctuated each yes by hitting the tabletop with his fists, each one louder than the last.  “MMmnnngh”
“And you, Draco Malfoy, shall acquiesce to a tracing charm being placed on your person for the duration of the journey until such time as the DMLE is able to carry out the sentence given at the time of your trial.  This, given in good faith that...”
Harry nodded. And the reality of the situation came flooding back to him. He’d just had yet another meltdown. This time in front of Draco Sodding Malfoy.
“FUCK YOU EMILY!  I CAN’T BELIEVE YOU’RE DOING THIS TO ME.”
“Ya gawt yourself a hot date or sumthin?”
“Why can’t we get them something from Diagon Alley?” Draco asked.  The shop around them was completely baffling to him.  Something called Argos.  It was a strange mixture of vaguely familiar and utterly confounding muggle items. White boxes with stationary images packed the shelves.  There was the occasional grey box or black box.  Those ones had brighter stationary images on the front.
“Is it normal for mug- er, muppets to behave this way?” he whispered back
Hermione’s cheeks coloured in the rapidly spreading silence. Ron’s eyes bugged out as he looked at his mother in horror.
“How was it?” she asked Harry, carefully.
“Azkaban. That’s where he belongs, with his father and the like.”
Harry nodded and Malfoy seemed to relax a little.  He held out his right arm. Harry tapped it with his wand and the Ministry Seal glowed more brightly.  It turned from a blue violet colour to a dark glowing plum. Instead of the light diminishing as it had when Harry put the tracer on it remained vivid, glowing beneath Malfoy’s pale skin.
“No, I’m meant to be on a date, at the moment. The council took longer than expected.”
“Exactly.  I mean, obviously he’s still an uppity swot.  But without the sting.”
“Yes, exactly! Everyone loves a party.”
“No more..” Dudley stopped there and glanced suspiciously around the room again.
“I’d rather not, thanks. Must be going. I’ve got a tuba to catch.”
“Of course you plug it in.” She said patiently. “I just didn’t think I needed to say that part. On second thought. Let’s just get you some Nescafe. Start you off slow. I don’t think you’re quite ready for all this yet.”
“I better be off, it’s late.”
There was a beat of silence at the table. All at once, the Weasleys started shouting at each other. Fluer was the notable exception to this behaviour.
“Better?” Malfoy asked.
There was another considerable pause.
Draco scoffed.
Granger glanced at Olivia, who was pretending the Nescafe in her hands was the most interesting piece of literature she’d ever happened upon.
“Do you need adult supervision, Draco?” she cooed.
Draco smirked at him.  “Do you? Most women have faked it at some point.  According to Pansy, anyway. If you’ve only slept with women, how would you know for certain?”
Draco glanced quickly from George’s face to Harry’s reaction.  They spoke at the same time.
“Anyone fancy a cuppa?” Granger asked, standing up.
Harry begrudgingly accepted the file, his heart sinking. It was thicker than last month’s. Which was thicker than the month before. Or maybe they were all the same and their perceived size seemed to increase in time with his trepidation. Or maybe Harry was losing it. “How many of these bloody events are there?”
“She really is incredible.”
Harry took another sip.  “God, that’s perfect.”
“We know,” they said together.
She smirked at Draco before turning back to Potter.  “And you’re sure you don’t need me for protection? I know a wicked hex or two.”
She nodded again.
“Laters.” Jean called after him.
“Oh.”
“Listen, I wanted to tell you-’ Jean stopped and tried again.  “I, well.  There’s no easy way of saying this, is there?”
“I truly am.”
“Don’t be stupid.  One of his arms is the size of both yours together.”
“They’ve just got matching robes for the Ministry Gala next month.”
Draco’s stomach flipped. He knew that voice. He swallowed carefully and looked up from the bottles.
“Going where?”
She smirked at him, deliberately made eye contact with Draco and pulled Potter into a passionate kiss until he couldn’t see her behind Potter. Draco looked away and ignored the turning in his stomach.  Then she released Potter and strutted away. Potter watched her tight fitting robes retreat until she was out of sight.
He nodded. There was no hiding now. She’s seen him. She’d addressed him by name. She was eyeing his trousers and t-shirt, his clearly muggle friend. Draco felt like an insect pinned to a wall under the severity of her gaze.
Then..
Draco looked up and found the window he had been admiring himself in belonged to a cafe. Filled with patrons. Who had just witnessed his odd behaviour.
“What was?”
Blaise’s eyes softened. He opened his mouth, but Draco cut him off.
“You were together for five years!  There is no way a five year relationship ends amicably.  Draco, my darling boy, surely even you know that.”
You want me to tell the public you’re doing the right thing. Pop in and show them we’re having a good time.”
Harry peeked out of one eye.
“Oooooohhh” came the sound of the rest of the group.
“We fell in love at Hogwarts.” Pomona said.
“Where do you think food comes from?”
“You’re awfully grim for a Gryffindor.  Has anyone ever told you that, Potter?”
“Because that’s what you do when a couple gets engaged.  You bring an engagement gift.  You would know this if you weren’t such an uncivilized cretin.”
“It’s fine. Really. Shacklebolt depends on me. The department needs me. It’s no bother.”
Too right, he had.  But Harry liked to think Draco wasn’t that person anymore.  “I dunno what to say, mate. That’s not who he is anymore. And the whole being mobbed bit, he gets it.  He didn’t have a choice in how he was raised any more than I did.  We were both a bit, I don't want to say brainwashed, but yeah.  Brainwashed.  Afraid of the future, afraid of letting people down.  We did what we had to.  He doesn't believe in any of that pure blood shite.  Not anymore.”
“Yeah, I reckon it’s normal for posh blokes to go catatonic in front of cafes.”
“Shirty Hat Shorts! Shirty Hat Shorts!”
“It was just Hermione said you might not be up for crowds.”
Malfoy nodded and looked back to match.
“Roberta.” Vera chimed in.
Olivia indicated him with her head, “he’s that posh bloke I told you about.”
“And the loneliness, he gets that too.  He grew up lonely and abused just like I did.”
“I will not!  They need to know!  You think this will last forever? It won’t! You think your harmless arguments about horrible American exercise equipment are endearing but it’s not going to last.  Eventually you will be fighting over every fork and knife in this flat.  I would say furniture, BUT YOU HAVEN’T GOT ANY BLEEDING FURNITURE OTHER THAN THIS MISERABLE SOFA.”
“Mm?”
“We just had a good night, is all.”
“Fuck, me!” the man’s red-rimmed eyes widened. “You’re Harry Potter!”
The grey eyes narrowed at Harry.
They let this obvious lie pass. “We’ll see ourselves out, mate.”
“Don’t I know it.”  Potter said. “Come on, then.”  he indicated the vibrantly magenta car two down from where they stood.  The Aurors posted at the entrance nodded to Potter, who nodded back.
“None of the words you’re using make any sense.”
“Are you seeing her again, then?”
Harry had a flashback to Rufus Scrimgeour saying nearly the same thing and felt his blood boil.
Something prodded Harry’s side. He groaned.
“So they needed to know who the potioneer was.”
“He was in muggle London, Ron. Dressed as a muggle!”
“Don’t tell me you haven’t got a mobile, either.” Olivia chimed in.
“What’ll you have today, then?”
“Small talk.”
“Please enlighten me.”
“I’m fine.” Harry said, a bit too loudly. Bill didn’t respond, but watched Harry thoughtfully.
“What. Do. You. Want.” Draco gritted out, keeping his eyes closed.
“He’s more your type than mine, he’s married now, you see.”
Granger blinked at him. The baby strapped to her chest began to ooze from its mouth. She absently wiped it.
“Draco?”  Ron dodged the bludger as he took off into the air after Harry.  “Seriously, mate. You call him Draco?”
“Got it?”
“Fancy some telly?”
Harry waved Malfoy off.  “You know what I mean.”
“I can’t believe you shaved off your beard.”
“There wasn’t.” Malfoy replied curtly.
He followed Harry’s sight line and found none other than Neville Longbottom arm in arm with Ginerva Weasley.  She was pregnant.
She stared at him and blinked. Her eyes looked about five times the size of a normal person behind her glasses. Harry was strongly reminded of seeing Professor Trelawney for the first time.
“It’s not a square, they’re shorts!” Lovegood called out.
“What are we doing?” the words slipped out before Harry could stop them.
“Are you not with Jean anymore?” Potter chewed his lip, “Shit, I didn’t mean to-”
“Cheers.”
“We have a grinder for that.” She opened one of the top cupboard doors and pulled out a black and silver contraption with a cord coming out of it. “You just take the lid off, pour the beans in, and press the button.”
returned. Draco shivered and looked back out his window. Mother wrote often, insisting Draco come join them. But it only took one meeting with his aunt to know Draco would never be able to go permanently. He was directly responsible for killing her daughter and orphaning her grandson. Draco spent the entire evening after the meeting retching. France might have brought his mother some comfort, but it never would for him.
Malfoy arched his eyebrow at Harry.  “Potter I never knew you so light in the loafers.”
“Nothing much.  Talk. Drink.”
“Yeah, but Margie is on her way. That’s the owner.” Olivia pulled out her mobile again and tapped on it some more. “Actually, she was in the country this weekend and is stuck on the M25. She may not get here for a bit longer.”
“Forget it, Potter.”  Pansy said, prim as could be.
Draco slid a drink across the bar to Harry who sipped it.  Delight spread over his face and Draco grinned. “It’s good, eh?”
Harry glanced out the window at the setting sun. “Oh, er.. Not bad, I suppose.” Harry grabbed another roll and coated it with butter. He tried not to focus on Ginny shouting at George in the next room over. He hoped she hadn’t brought Neville with her. It was awkward enough staying at your ex-girlfriend’s family gatherings after you’ve split. But having her bring her not-so-new boyfriend made Harry seem even more of an outsider. Not that his feelings should have any bearing on Ginny’s life. Not anymore. Christ, he was a selfish prat.
He blinked at her, startled. He didn’t know that, actually. And it threw him a bit to hear it announced casually, the same tone that Olivia would use to comment on the weather . His own mother had only said it twice that he could recall. Not that Draco didn’t know they loved him. He knew his mother loved him very much. It simply wasn’t communicated verbally, as very few things were. Draco’s family lived a life of implications and unspoken social constructs.
Harry flipped him two fingers and set to work following Hermione’s minuscule and detailed instructions on toadstool fairing rings. He tried not to think about how out of place he felt in The Burrow. He would have never thought Ginny would have wanted a fairy themed engagement party. Harry supposed that was one of the many reasons she was marrying Neville and not him.
Draco looked up to see the curtain swishing back into place after Potter’s departure.
“Oh?” Draco’s heart sank.
“Abused?  His parents bought his entire quidditch team new brooms!  He’s been spoiled his entire life! You were literally abused, Harry.  It’s not the same, mate.”
He eyed the pastry case, looking for something new. “How are the peach roses?”
“I will miss our time together, Weasley, brief though it was.”
“I’ve literally never seen you upset about Jean.  Not once! How is that possible?  Did you not care about him at all?”
“You’ve got sick on you.” Harry said to Ron, nodding at his shoulder.
“Thanks.” said Harry.
“Right. You, sir, will go to Tesco to do the shopping.” Olivia grabbed a ballpoint pen and started jotting things down on a scrap of paper. She checked the refrigerator and the cupboards and wrote a few more things down.
The crowd around them stood up cheering at the Cannon’s recent goal.  Harry and Ron remained seated, Ron gawping at Harry. Harry staring at the floor.
“They’re shorts not a square, Ron.” Harry said.
Dudley’s eyes darted to the other bar patrons. He dropped his voice to a whisper, “It’s.. genetic, your condition, yeah?”
“You don’t have to publish it, of course. I thought it might have more therapeutic value than anything else. Although if you pursued publication, you might get more space from the public at large.”
Potter chuckled, darkly this time.  “Not great, as it were.” He stuck his hands in his pockets and gave an odd sort of hunched over shrug.  “I'm getting divorced, actually.”
Harry hesitated. Well. It was a muggle cafe, after all. It was fine. He was fine. “Harry. Harry Potter.”
Harry sighed.  The Cannons scored again and the orange swathed crowd around them erupted in cheers.
“I have decided.” he said in an American cowboy accent. “That for thuh rest awf thuh day we will tawk like thee-us.”
Don’t bring up Potter. Don’t bring up Potter who was just his type. Potter who was shaggable and didn’t hex him.
"I don't think you fully understand wizarding relationships with muggle utilities, Harry.  I would hazard to say Arthur Weasley is the exception to the rule."
He was positively mad. Draco knew for certain the sign on the shelf read 19 sickles an ounce for the dragon liver and porcupine quills were only 20 knuts a bundle. Not a chance was that over two ounces of liver. Draco looked up from the parchment to meet the shopkeeper’s challenging stare. He opened his mouth, about to argue the absurdity of the charge, but stopped himself.
Draco tugged his left sleeve down and became fascinated by the building’s architecture.
Harry leaned his head on Draco’s.  “If you could get back together, would you?  Would you take him back right now?”
Draco took a sip of his beer. A long sip. His Adam's apple bobbed.  “Mmmm..” Draco hummed, slowly.
“What’s so hard to believe about that?”
The cafe door opened and a group of old ladies with knitting supplies trundled in. They set their bags of yarn on the large table in the opposite corner that Draco normally sat in and began unbuttoning their coats.
Jean smiled at him like Draco was a child asking too many questions of a tired parent.  “Drake, this ticket cost me a fortune, don’t be ungrateful. I’ll meet up with you after.”
He tried again the next evening, again venturing out in muggle clothing. He made it to the cafe where he had a minor breakdown last time. Now, instead of stalling in the window front like a nutter, he made it through the doors.
“Oh, er. Right.” Dudley said helpfully.
Did Malfoy feel as trapped as Sirius had? Surely not at the beginning. But after sixth year, Harry knew Malfoy was miserable. Everyone was miserable by that time. Forced to deal with shit beyond what was should be expected of teenagers.
“Did you.” Draco drawled.
“Well not everyone was born an idiot, Potter.”  Malfoy said, without any heat.
“Ginny!” came Mrs Weasley’s admonishment.
Harry waited until they’d left. He tossed the journal in the bin and set it on fire. Once the fire extinguished, he crawled back under his covers and let the mortification wash over him.
“I tried to warn you, Minister,” Laghari said. Her long black hair fell down her back in perfect waves. “He hasn’t the slightest idea of the consequences of his actions in the matter.”
Malfoy huffed a laugh.  Harry realized Malfoy was smirking at him and it did things to Harry’s insides that he wasn’t entirely comfortable with.  “Anyway, I’m going to marry her and I’d hardly share that with the press, would I.”
Potter was briefly flummoxed by this.  “Who eats pomegranates?”
“Ron went mental.  Didn’t know who to cheer for.  He was in a right state.”
Harry put out his cigarette and followed George’s lead by vanishing it. Unlike George, Harry flicked his finger at the cigarette to make it disappear instead of his wand.
Creevy cast Draco one final scathing glance and then turned to leave. He strode off without another look. Draco finally looked up and met Weasley’s steady gaze. In full Auror kit, even Draco had to admit he was quite a sight. No longer the tall and gangly ginger he remembered from Hogwarts. Weasley had filled out, now broad and intimidating.
“Stop calling me that.”
“Kreacher has Master’s breakfast.” “Oh. Right.” Harry ran his hand over his face and reached for his glasses. “Come in, then.”
Malfoy was right, though.  The match was on. Harry dragged his eyes away from the blue strands hiding beneath Malfoy’s beanie and forced himself to find the snitch.
She jerked her head to the side a few times but Draco didn’t see anything beside her.
“Shirtless.” chimed in Blaise.
Harry managed to keep a believable smile on his face for most of the night. And anyway, the Aurors got too pissed to notice if he slipped up. Once Ron stopped being able to form complete words, Harry figured it was time to go. He slipped his arm around Ron’s shoulder and hefted him up.
“Not shorts, then.  Pants.” Weasley said, accusingly.  “Merlin’s Pants isn’t a saying.”
“Mmphes.” Ron replied.
“The whole match?”
“What does this do?”  Draco interrupted.  He picked up a cardboard box about the size of
Draco rolled his eyes. “Are you incapable of answering a simple question?
Harry wasn’t sure where the words had come from, but when they popped out he was equally surprised to find Malfoy had accepted his invitation.  Here they were having coffee together. Like old friends. Not like bitter enemies who’d once tried to kill each other. It was... Odd.
“Things?” Harry asked.
“Stop repeatin' eend answer thuh question, pahrtner”
Potter scratched the back of his neck.  “Shit. I didn’t think-”
Harry plucked his t-shirt and sniffed. He flicked a finger across the collar to cast a quick scourfingy and rid himself of cigarette smoke.
“Er.. Sorry.” he said at the same time Draco said, “Cheers, Harry.”
Kingsley picked a piece of lint off his trousers.  “Right, then I married Natalie.”
Draco continued to ignore her and consequently got on the wrong tuba line. He knew he was meant to be on the Central line, but somehow ended up on the Piccadilly line. Then he didn’t know when to get off and found himself at the end of the line at a place called Cockfosters, which Draco refused to believe was its actual name. Someone was fucking with him. Some wizard or witch had recognised him on the tuba and transfigured the station name, just to throw him off. It was the only logical explanation. He waited until the platform cleared of Muggles (not that there were very many to begin with) and appearated back to Blaise’s flat.
“It’s a nice place.” Harry spun around in the air, it felt great to feel the wind against his face.  He felt alive and free in a way that was becoming, sadly, less frequent.
“Of course you did. Can I have a look?”
“Have you ever been to Malfoy Manor, Harry?” Olivia asked.
“I turned myself in as a war criminal?  And you tried to chat me up on the train?”
“Wow, er. I..” Granger looked at his muggle clothing again. Eyed his muggle friend. “I suppose we could do that.”
Harry frowned.  Mixologist?  “Like a bartender?”
“It’s the one with 8 out of 10 cats. Jimmy Carr?”
“Wait, Hermione went with you? To a quidditch match? With Ginny and Neville?”
“Is that meant to be a sarcastic remark?” Draco narrowed his eyes.
Harry made it out the door successfully this time. He wove between the crowd of Londoners, eyes darting across the building fronts. Looking for an alleyway he could use to appearate. A flash of blonde caught his eye and Harry glanced over to see a small gap between buildings. Perfect. Harry made his way over. He debated heading further in and appearating from behind the bins, but he was in a hurry and needed his wand for this. Harry transferred the bags to one hand and dug through his pockets. His wand wasn’t there. He swore quietly and shifted the bags again to search his other pocket. A wave of relief washed over him when his hand found the familiar Holly. He appearated on the spot with a loud CRACK and landed in The Burrow’s back garden.
“That’s not true. I-”
“We haven’t got any books.” said Roger helpfully.
Luc shrugged elegantly, “He is the most famous wizard on the cards, is he not?”
Harry pointed a finger at him as well as he could with his hands full of sandwich.  “But not well.”
Ron vaguely nodded and tried to stand up straight. His eyes found Hermione and lit up. “Mione!!” He shouted.
“My cousin was in Gringotts that day, you know.”
The club suddenly seemed too loud in Harry’s ears. Everything became unbearable. Darkness crept into the edges of Harry’s vision. The thudding bass seemed more like pounding cellar walls. The changing lights like flying hexes.
“Does Master Harry be wanting something else?”
“I was drunk.”
“Hermione said that?”
“MORE LIKE STALLIONS, AMIRIGHT?” George shouted. He flicked his wand and a herd of horse shaped mashed potatoes galloped across the table to Victorie’s plate.
Longbottom was no longer the small chubby boy Draco had bullied in school.  If he was honest, the man looked quite fit.  He wasn’t scared of Draco, that was certain.  His face was carefully constructed with polite curiosity.  His brown eyes flicked between Harry and Draco.  How close they were standing to each other. Draco coughed and took a half step away.
“Apparently it was bad enough Hermione thought I needed a hug.”
“Good morning, Olivia.” he replied, proud of remembering her name.
Hermione scoffed and stepped away, “I always think you need a hug, Harry.” She turned to Ron and handed him the journal. “I think you better read for yourself”
“Potter you’re depressing me.  You can’t really be thinking that.”
“Where’d you meet her?”
Draco evaluated the clipboard with the baking schedule on it. He knew how to make about half the things on the list. It was only half ten in the morning and the clipboard showed the shift ended at noon. All that was unfinished for today was the steak and Guinness pasties. Surely he could handle that. He found a plastic folder with the method and ingredients listed. It read just like a potion, only a bit easier. Something bright and joyous began to grow inside him. He could do this and do it well. Maybe he’d get on as a muggle after all.
“You know,” he gestured his pale, perfect hand between them. “Us. Being friends.”
“Did it really?”
“Hm..” That ‘hm’ did not bode well for Harry’s future peace of mind.
“Standing in an alleyway, Potter,” Malfoy drawled. “Have you lost your sight as well as your mind?”
Harry shook his head in disbelief.  Malfoy was more messed up than he thought.
There was a small waiting room looking over the ocean where they sat on a bench.  Harry watched Malfoy’s reflection in the window. He’d changed since Hogwarts, since his trial even.  The pale blonde hair looked healthier than Harry had seen it in years. His fine features made a cutting profile. Somehow Malfoy had grown up when Harry hadn’t been paying attention.  He found himself oddly captivated.
“No idea.”
Shock registered in Potter’s eyes.  He began looking round the shop more aggressively.
“Don’t talk about Madam Pomfrey that way.” He bit back, automatically. He sighed. Harry didn’t want to fight. Neither, it seemed, did Malfoy.
“Right. Thanks, Bridget.”
“Come inside, love” She waved her wand and vanished the sick. She and Harry each grabbed an arm and brought Ron into the cottage. Harry wandlessly dried out their robes and Hermione looked curiously over Ron’s shoulder at Harry.
Draco hesitated so Harry nodded again, with enthusiasm this time.
“OI GEORGE! WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING AT ME, DICKHEAD?” Ginny yelled out.
“Bisexuality?” Malfoy asked, supremely unhelpful. He slid back into the booth with three pints of lager.
Another voice tutted in response.
“My sole duties would be attending functions?” he couldn’t have read that right.
Draco was well aware of her bat bogey hex.  Blaise described it with such admiration Draco suspected the man had fallen a little in love with her sixth year.  Before everything turned to shit.
“Hand me that fanged geranium, will you?”
Harry wondered if he had another glass of wine if he’d still be able to apparate.
Draco closed his eyes and took a deep breath. Just because they were muggles didn’t mean he had the right to use magic against them. Yes, he could solve this problem immediately. But it wasn’t his place. They were people just like him. Draco thought back to all the times Aunt Bellatrix had imperioused him. A shiver went down his spine. He could resolve the situation without magic. Somehow.
“Have you dyed your hair??”
Hermione’s eyes narrowed. “Have fun, then?”
Harry shrugged.  “The whole time we were together I knew it would end.  Everything always ends. I knew she’d leave me. Everyone I love leaves me at some point.”
“He used to live by himself when he first got to London.” Olivia said, “Found himself a nice setup in Knightsbridge.” She leaned in and Harry mirrored her.
“I suppose you’re right.  We could never be friends.”
“Not bad, yeah.”  Harry scratched the back of his head.  “Fancy some dinner?”
Draco looked dumbfounded.  Harry caught his eye and shrugged.
A few moments later, he sat with this pastry and his coffee in the farthest corner of the cafe. Draco barely tasted them. His mind was racing.He had a sense of urgency rumbling beneath his skin. He had to make this work. How did muggles go about securing employment? What kind of paperwork was involved with letting a flat? In the wizarding world, it was a simple magical signature cast by a wand. Without a magical signature, how would they know who he was? Perhaps it was better that way, he thought. Did they cover this in muggle studies? Not that he’d have been allowed to take it at Hogwarts. So many questions and no viable resources.
Harry would never give up the passion he had with Ginny for some political alliance.  Her fire and wit, he couldn’t live without it. Just the thought of her sent his heart racing, the soft curve of her arse, the taste of her skin. The way she- Harry blinked.  That was it.
“Harry Potter, apologize to Pansy Parkinson?  What is the world coming to?” Draco said softly against his neck. Harry ignored the warmth that spread through his body at Draco’s touch.  He stepped back and cleared his throat.
Olivia cackled at him. “Tesco is only a few blocks away. Take this with you.” She passed him a folded up plastic shopping bag. “It should all fit in there, but if you need another one, they’re only about 50 p.”
“Ah. Kind of you.” She replied. “Can I get a name for the order?”
“That she is.”
“I’m not a simpleton, you know. You don’t have to speak to me that way.”
“No.  But..”
“Why are there so many kinds?” He asked her.
Bill looked confused. “I assumed you were on the same team.”
Harry rather thought he should be offended.  But instead the words floated over him like a fog.
“But I never lost Arthur.” Molly said, her voice thick.  “Over fifty years we’ve been married, bless him.”
“I need tiger rolls. Can you tell me what a tiger roll is?”
“No! Jean!  I don’t care about Luc.  Who cares about Luc?  Merlin, what's wrong with you?”
They were briefly separated by a group talking excitedly in Bulgarian.
Draco sneered, “Please spare me the lecture on alcohol content, Millie. I’ve been drinking port since I was fifteen.” He looked at them fully now. Both in their clothing from the night before, albeit a little worse for the wear. He gestured between them. “Did you just get in? Is this a thing now?”
“That’s just weird.” Ron said.
Harry looked over at Andrew.  “Hm?”
Draco shook himself and turned to the owner of the voice. A girl around his age in a jumper with a cat on it.
Draco rolled his eyes as he crossed to the hearth to peck Jean on the cheek as he came all the way through the fireplace.
“Yes! Back in a mo’!” she darted into her bedroom and dropped off the book bag she’d been carrying. A few minutes later Olivia came trotting out in comfy looking sweats. She shoved a pad of paper at him.
Ron scratched the back of his neck. “We, er.. We weren’t sure you’d be up for it, you know? Crowds and that.”
“What’s that look for, love? Did you finally win your battle against the espresso machine?” Olivia tousled his hair as she walked past him to set the kettle on again. She paused when she saw the cutting board. “Did you chop coffee beans?”
Her mouth pinched tight, and she made a small disapproving noise. “Come and join us in the kitchen, you cow.”
“Right, well, whatever.  We need more than that, Malfoy!”
“I’m not a prude, Potter.”
You'd rather be in a passionless, political marriage than live with the man you've had the best shag of your life with?”  Harry wouldn’t put it past Malfoy, he was a Slytherin after all. “Just because of his job? Because he runs a bar? What? That’s not posh enough for you?”
“You’re not joining me?” Draco asked, swirling the wine in the glass.
“What, indeed, Potter.”
“Is that a hat?” Granger asked.
“Wizarding flats are hard to come by in muggle London, you know.”  Malfoy smirked at Harry, “though maybe not for you Potter.”
“And the romantic interlude by the fireplace?”
“Yeah. He’s a wizard.” Harry sighed and rubbed his eyes again. “What did you want to talk to me about, anyway?” he asked.
“Who are you going to tell?”
Draco eventually came out of the back office and spoke briefly with the closing shift employees.  Harry thought he saw Pansy Parkinson dart behind the curtain but couldn’t be sure. Harry had the distinct suspicion that she was hiding from him.  She must know he and Draco were friends. Harry stopped by a few times a week, these days, to see him.
“Er.. Sorry, mate. We meant to ask you along, too. Ginny got the tickets at a discount. She plays in the same league.”
The hour of Blaise’s arrival came and went. Draco portion out the potion into 200 ml bottles and line them up on a shelf. He grabbed his wand and cast a tempus charm. Blaise should have been home thirty minutes ago. Draco wandered out to the kitchen. After having a glass of wine, he supposed he’d better start on the next potion.
They glanced at each other, like they knew he would say this. Draco scoffed. They didn’t know him as well as they thought they did. No one did. He was unknowable. He looked down his nose at them.
“What he said.  That Aurors can’t be friends with criminals?”
Harry made his way back to the booth with his drink. He felt numb, but did his best to answer Dudley’s questions about Hogwarts. Malfoy picked up on his mood shift and shot him concerned looks through the rest of the conversation.
There were a few double takes at Draco’s appearance.  Each time Harry caught him tugging his left sleeve down. No one said anything untoward but that might have been due to Harry’s scowling presence at Draco’s side.
“Let’s focus on the madman with a knife, shall we?” he whispered. “Is this normal?”
Olivia giggled, which hardly seemed appropriate given the situation. “Did you just call Franc a muppet?”
“We have to go.” Harry said and began marching toward the door.
“The flashbacks.” Malfoy continued. “It’s awful. One minute you’re here, the next you’re being crucioed at The Dark Lord’s feet.”
Fully caffeinated and dressed, Draco and Olivia stepped out into London to get Nescafe. After his first disastrous run in with Potter, he’d stopped going to Tesco and started going to Sainsbury’s. But he let Olivia lead the way.
Malfoy stopped and turned to face him.  “What about me being with Jean is confusing to you?”
Kingsley looked at her and nodded in confirmation.  “After we got divorced I married Elizabeth.”
“C’mon, mate. Let’s get you home to Hermione.”
“Mmhmm..”
“Merlin.”  Draco shook his head.  He nudged Pansy to move over and grabbed a cutting block. “How can it possibly know if you’re muggle on a mobile phone?”
“Do they?  Win, that is?” Draco drawled.  “How do you know?”
“Cheers, mate.”
“That’s quite enough, George!” Mrs Weasley responded. “We don’t need more flying food.”
Finally Malfoy joined in, “Jealousy turning saints into the sea”
“Something wrong with it?”
“Fine.”
“Come along, Potter, we’re going to be late.”
“Charity work, eh?”
“I’m an Auror and you’re turning yourself in for war crimes.” Potter went on, completely unnecessarily.  A simple “no” would suffice. No need to add insult to injury with further details. Draco hated Harry Potter, though not as much as he hated himself for still wanting the man’s friendship.  The stupid oaf spat another grape seed into the bin.
That brought Harry up short.  “Oh.”
"Course I would."  Harry’s chewing slowed as he watched
Harry shrugged. He let Hermione bring him in and take care of him. Only much later did he wonder how Malfoy had known where Ron and Hermione lived.
“Don’t think someone like me could date anyone British?”
“I was only eleven when I first saw Arthur,” she said.  “We were in the same year at Hogwarts but I didn’t see him during the Sorting.  I was sitting at the Gryffindor table the next morning beside my friend Emily.” Molly turned to Arthur beside her and looped her arm through his. “And this man” she leaned her head on Arthur’s shoulder, “walked into the Great Hall, headed for our table.  I turned to Emily and said ‘You see that boy? I’m going to marry him.’”
“No one can blame you for that, honestly.” Laghari produced a roll of parchment. The Ministry crest loomed at the top in deep purple ink. “Here’s what we’re proposing.”
“I will have you know I have been laid plenty.”
He dimmed the lights in the kitchen after Mrs Weasley left, finding them a little too bright. Harry always resented doing the dishes for the Dursleys. Being made to clean up while they enjoyed ice creams and puddings in the next room. He suffered none of that resentment cleaning up after The Weasleys. They had given him so much. They’d been through so much on his behalf. Mrs Weasley had lost her brothers and a son in the wars he, albeit indirectly, caused. If all Harry could give her was a night off from cleaning, he was glad to do it.
“Worse than a surprise divorce?”
“That’s just me, then.”  Harry smirked.
“I have been laid often and well Auror Potter!” Malfoy said loudly.  The noise in the dining card stopped entirely, all heads swiveled in their direction.
“Mm.  Then you got divorced.” Amusement sparked in her eyes.
“NO. For Christ’s sake.” Harry began shovelling the eggs in his mouth. “They’re fucking great!” he said through a mouthful of eggs.
Draco had been particularly thrilled when he discovered “beanies.”  They were Draco’s favourite accessory. Nine months out of the year Draco wore a beanie.  Only in the sweltering heat of London in the summer did he go without one. His favourite was black and a bit too large so that it slouched at the back of his neck. The most exciting part of wearing muggle clothes was wearing them in Diagon Alley.  With his hair covered by a beanie and his mark covered with muggle floral tattoos, Draco wasn’t immediately recognized as a Malfoy. A Death Eater. He wasn’t spat at or hexed. It was rather lovely.
Draco had anticipated the answer was the same now as it was at age eleven. It still hurt to hear out loud.  He turned to the window.
“Diggory was murdered on school grounds in our fourth year.” Malfoy said, as Harry floundered. “He died at the hands of a madman.” He paused and slid his leg under the table until their thighs were touching. “Potter here is mistakenly under the impression that he is at fault for Diggory’s death.” Malfoy’s leg gave a nudge against Harry’s. “Which is simply not the case.”
“I have to admit, she is formidable.  The Harpies would be nowhere without her.” Malfoy conceded. “That last match against the Cannons was brutal.”
They were both trying to contain their laughter now. A shadow fell over their faces and they looked up to find Franc looming over them, his eyes bugging out of his head.
Draco’s stomach dropped.  Potter glanced up from a book, an upside down book, and saw he’d been caught out.  His cheeks flushed.
Hermione came running down the stairwell with an armful of parchment rolls, quills, and ink, only to find the dining room mostly vacated. She looked at Harry, a question on her face.
“Gryffindor colours? Yes.”
Olivia stifled a laugh.
her to leave!  Jesus. That’s why he puts her on the plane.  He’s trying to keep her safe!”
“See you later,” Jean kissed Malfoy on the cheek. Harry looked away quickly.  After his departure Malfoy adjusted his beanie, once again tucking the blue hair away.  When the crowds began to disperse Harry stayed in his seat. He liked to let the stadium thin out before trying to traverse the crowd.  Malfoy seemed to have the same idea. Despite Krum’s victory and an overall fantastic match Malfoy didn’t smile. He kept sighing and picking at his nail varnish.  They waited until Krum’s family left before they began descending the stairs.
Draco scoffed. “To say that I was awful to her would be an unforgiveable understatement.”
Harry ran a thumb over Draco’s outside shoulder and nestled in closer.
“I’ll hold you to it.” Draco murmured.  Harry drew back to look at him.  He’d forgotten what they’d been talking about, lost in thoughts of nuzzling.  Draco’s eyes were dove grey with small flecks of blue around the rim.  Harry hadn’t noticed that particular detail before. How had he missed that?  The air was thick between them.  Harry opened his mouth to speak but found he had nothing to say.  Draco’s eyes flicked down to his mouth.  Harry’s stomach did somersaults.
“I don’t, actually.”
It filled Harry with guilt. They had so much to worry about with their baby and their jobs; he didn’t want to burden them further.
Malfoy looked as though he would vomit for half a moment before he blinked himself into composure.  “The one with the Ministry tracer?” he asked faintly.
”Er…”
Draco swallowed the horrible lump that had risen in his throat. He nodded, “Fantastic. Thank you. I’ll ow-write you. I’ll write you.”
“Well they both grew up in the wizarding world, so pretty much anything will be a hit.”
Blaise laughed, “Does it ever?”
Granger and Harry shared a significant glance and laughed together. There was something odd going on with Draco's chest.  He made a mental note to make an appointment with his Healer.
He couldn’t remember the last time he’d gotten Top Box seats at a quidditch match.  The Bulgaria v Ireland World Cup perhaps? Draco shuddered. He tugged the sleeve of his jacket down on his left arm and followed Jean to their row.  There was only one empty seat at the end of the row, the rest of the box was packed. Draco looked to Jean.
What would happen if he and Malfoy weren't enemies? What if Harry had shaken his hand that day on the train? What if he invited Malfoy to sit with him and Ron? Would he have? Was there any world where Ron and Malfoy could have been mates?
“Yeah, American.”  Harry said. “Thought it might be less complicated.  I’m pretty much only famous here.”
Malfoy smirked at him. “Wouldn’t you like to know.”
“You’re an idiot.”
"I still slept with her.”
Draco peeked his head into the kitchens. The man he assumed to be Franc was shouting at his mobile. The area was an absolute disaster. Tarts splattered on walls, dough slid down the front of the industrial sink.
“Thought you’d never ask.”
This time spatulas went flying, spraying icing over the small windows on the doors.
“That’s what I said.”
Malfoy shook his head.  “She doesn’t want to stay, Potter.”
“IT’S A NEW TEST PRODUCT.  SHOUTING SHORTBREAD.  HAVEN’T FIGURED OUT THE ANTIDOTE YET.”
The Weaselette hid her laughter behind her hands. Potter glared at Draco.
“Do deculare”  Harry hooked his thumbs through the belt loops on his jeans and stuck out his elbows. “That ya ought t' see a movie with me tonaahyt.”
.” It flew into his hands. Draco loved magic. The sounds of janglings keys and the scraping of the lock came drifting down the hall and Draco stuffed his wand back into this trouser pocket.
The crisp packet began to warm in Harry’s hand signalling the two minute warning.  He looked to Malfoy and they stood facing each other.
Malfoy hastily tucked it back under.  “It was a mistake.”
“I love you.” she said.
Draco felt himself being nudged, quite rudely. He cracked his eyes open and let in the glaring midday sun. It was awful. He shut his eyes again, but only for a moment before he was prodded again.
“We were married forty years ago for a while,” said Kingsley.
“Fine,” Blaise sighed and looked Draco solidly in the eye. “They wouldn’t approve our application.”
The wand tip at his throat surged with heat.
Draco silently willed Olivia to shut the fuck up. It didn’t work.
“Alright, love?”
“Didn’t you also go out with Chang? How did no one know about this?”
“Is he?” Granger asked shrewdly.  “He seems quite accomplished to me.”
“Yeah, well. Unfortunately, that clag MacMillan is on the council now. He knows I can’t brew worth shit; he was with us at Hogwarts.”
“She has, at that.”
“You don’t need to worry.” Harry said.
“Hm. Best hold off for now. How’s your mother?”
Draco nodded and turned to Granger.  “I’ll help you.”
“What are you nattering about?”
“Grapes?  What are you eleven?”
Harry (and thankfully) Draco flooed in from Grimmauld place around half nine. This was, of course, after Draco made Harry change out of his t-shirt and jeans.  After Draco handed him a tie with a matching pocket square.  After Harry reluctantly admitted he looked much better with Draco’s instruction and Draco lit up like a smug Christmas Tree.  They were immediately handed glasses of champagne and greeted with double kissed cheeks from Luna Lovegood.  She wore a mass of tulle and what looked to be live butterflies.  One of which fluttered off her dress and landed on Draco’s shoulder.
Harry shook his head, “No she follows the New York Pixies.  But I completely lost control of myself. Sobbing in public like a loon.  I spent the entire night talking to this poor woman about Ginny. Ginny’s quidditch habits.  Her laundry habits.” Potter began pacing the tiny room, running his hands through his hair frantically, “The way her freckles get darker in the summer.  The way I will never know anyone as well as I know her.  I mean we've known each other since we were children.”
“I tried not to, honestly. But they weren’t buying it.”
“That’s healthy, is it?” Draco said nastily.  “You’ll fuck anyone standing so long as they don’t know you!  And it doesn’t seem to help you get over Ginvera Weasley.  Why should I model my behaviour after yours?  You’re pathetic!”
“Happy New Year.” He breathed.
“Sorry!” He said, as he scrambled to help her scoop them back up without dropping the box of pastries. She looked up at him, a bit lost. “Looking for the other knitting ladies?”
“Obviously. We are in a muggle club, do try to keep up.” Malfoy turned and disappeared into the crowd.
“You don’t appreciate me enough, Draco.”
All the produce was covered in plastic. It was mental. He had to purchase potatoes that came in a plastic bag and then put that plastic bag in another plastic bag. Broccoli was covered in plastic that looked like it was moulded on. What kind of nonsense was that? Despite the absurdity of the packaging, Draco still found himself enjoying the shopping process a little. Particularly getting to use his ballpoint pen. He crossed potatoes off the list, gave the pen a satisfying click and tucked it back in the jacket pocket of this three-piece suit.
“Where do you work?”
The broccoli, shaped like pirates, now fought each other across the table and collapsed into a pile on Harry’s plate. Victorie giggled with delight. Bill and Fluer shared a smile at her giggle.
“Where’s Kreacher?” Ron asked, frowning. “Why’re you in Sirius’s room? And what’s that noise?”
A stray hair had come loose from Malfoy’s beanie.  Harry gaped.
“So, how are the Aurors treating you these days, Harry?” Bill asked, tucking a few loose strands of hair behind his year.
“But he! He.. Collin.. My brother
“We have to give it a go!”
“I will gladly take this fiver,” she said, imitating his posh accent. Then she winked at him, “I’ll bring it over in a mo’.”
“What?”
“Yeah, you were.” Harry grinned lopsidedly at Malfoy. “Well, I suppose I was a bit of a twat too.”
“No, I’m sure you could date anyone you please.  You’re a good looking bloke.”
Draco continued to stare at her, nonplussed.
“I bet I would,” Harry muttered.
“This is Rosie.”
He wasn’t sure that what the young lady served him could be considered tea. It was closer to tap water with a leafy aftertaste. Draco wasn’t about to antagonise one of the few establishments that still allowed him in by sending it back. He drank the leaf water without comment. Blaise was to meet him a half past four and it was only a quarter after. Draco could make it fifteen minutes with no one noticing him, he was sure of it. Especially here. Most people in Knockturn Alley didn’t want to draw attention to themselves.
Narcissa Malfoy sat primly on the edge of the sofa in the very centre.  Her full skirted black robes draped elegantly on either side of her. Her back was straight, her ankles crossed, and her hands folded gracefully in her lap.  The hair that had once been black turned a steely grey with a white streak pulled up from her widow's peak into an elaborate bun.
“Stop shouting, Potter.”
Harry swallowed. “Us?”
Herb turned to face Pomona, “She was just as beautiful as she was at sixteen.”  He patted her knee gently.
“Potter, this is Olivia, who I work with.”
“With great perseverance.”
Harry looked up at Draco and relaxed. “I was a right mess, mate.”
It was two more hours before Draco heard the Floo light up.
Molly sat down beside Arthur on the couch.  They smiled at each other in the way people who have spent their lives side by side do, communicating entire paragraphs in the blink of an eye, a half hidden smile.
“What..  is it?” Draco asked, leaning forward to inspect it a bit more.
“How many Chosen Ones do you honestly think there are?”
Chuck it right in the bin.
Harry attempted to open his eyes again, with moderately more success. He sat up and groped around for his glasses.
“Arsenal.”
“You can be your own person, Harry.” She added softly and reached out to put her hand over his. She squeezed gently, “you can be whoever you want. It doesn’t have to be an Auror.”
“Harry here was one of the celebrities I interviewed for the humanitarian piece I did last year.” Jean explained.
Shit. He knew that voice. It just had to be Weasley stepping in, didn’t it. A large boot planted itself near Creevy’s in Draco’s narrow field of vision.
“What on earth is toadstool duty?”
“Hermione.” Harry said emphatically.
Malfoy rounded on Harry, indignant.  “Firstly I don’t see how that’s any business of yours, Auror Potter.  Second, we hardly know each other. We’ve been dating a month. I don’t want to marry anyone I’ve known for a month. Which is, I repeat, none of your business.”
“He’s fit now, innit.” Pansy whispered.
“If you have any questions, just pop into the front. You are a lifesaver!” With that, she flounced back to the register to help the knitting ladies.
“I think he’s got some bad news.” Olivia whispered.
“Naturally,”  he said.  Draco himself was in a tight charcoal herringbone suit with black velvet lapels and piped pockets.  Draco was born to wear muggle suits, Harry thought.
“Am I being interrogated, Auror Potter?” Draco said.
“A FEW DAYS AGO!” she shouted at him.  “How could you keep this from me!”
“Yes, you very well did.  On the train. We had an entire discussion about it.”
“Malfoy, want to get us another round?” Harry asked and pulled his wallet out of his back pocket. He slid Malfoy twenty quid and nodded at the bar.
Draco’s hesitation seemed to melt off his shoulders.  He glanced at Harry quickly. “It is rather, isn’t it?”
He laid a hand firmly on her knee and squeezed gently.  “Ah yes, Priya. But I didn’t marry her. I married Elizabeth.”
Neville smiled nervously back at him and nodded, his hands stuck deep in his pockets. Luckily, they sat nearer Fleur and Bill than Ron and Hermione or himself and… himself.
walk these streets,” Creevy’s reedy thin voice wheezed out. “After everything you’ve done!”
“Say it, I know you’re dying to.”
Outside Harry began pacing.  Draco leaned elegantly against the door, watching him.  Harry could feel the judgement rolling off him in waves.
“Brainwashing is still abuse.  A different kind, mind you. But abuse all the same.”
“That depends on how much mould you like with your danish.” Draco scoffed.
“Really, this is too much, Potter. You can’t keep following me everywhere.” Malfoy drawled. At the mere sound of his voice, Harry felt as though a thousand doxies were let loose inside him. He looked up and found Malfoy leaning on the bar beside him, close enough that Harry could smell his cologne. It wafted over him and sent a shiver down his spine.
“I recite it every day before brewing.  I’m trying to do something good, you know?  Avoid causing harm. Think of it like a spa, only with beverages.”
Draco didn’t want to ruin this amicable conversation.  He cast around for something to ask, “How’s married life, then?”
“Oh, er, hi Ginny. Neville.” Harry pasted a smile on his face. “Alright?”
“Careful, mate. If you don’t find some way to occupy yourself, Hermione will draft you into helping her with research.”
“Good afternoon.” Draco said cautiously.
Hermione joined Ron on the sofa and he shifted to lay his feet on her lap. The coffee table in front of them was covered with parchment and stacks of books.
They held each other’s gaze steadily.  Harry’s heart sped up for no reason he could discern.
“She’d already found a flat.  We’re in the middle of a row about this and the movers arrived. Movers!  They started magicking half the shit in our flat into boxes. Ginny had gone round and marked what she’s taking with bloody stickers!”
“Sounds like it.”
“Yeah.”
“Harry!”
Olivia reached over and squeezed his knee. “Don’t worry, love. I’ve texted the owner. Do you think we should call 999?”
Bulgaria chasers had the quaffle.  They tossed it between each other, easily dodging the keeper and shot it through the post.
“Are they displeasing to Master?”
Malfoy elbowed Harry in the ribs. “What Potter here meant to say was congratulations.” Malfoy glared at Harry. “He just lacks the tact to do so.” he added under his breath.
“Two weeks after graduation we were married.”  Molly continued. “I lost my two brothers in the first war.” Her eyes began to fill with tears.  “We lost our son in the second war.”
Luc met Draco at his flat so they could Floo in together.  “You look lovely,” Luc said and kissed Draco’s cheek.
And they were snogging again.
“We were just discussing your Manor, love!” Announced Olivia.
Eventually, he ran out of booze and crisps, which meant he ran out of writing power. He heard Hermione and Ron calling for him from the sitting room. He shrugged on a dressing gown over his jogging bottoms.
“Oh, piss off,” she said without any heat. “So what happened?” She found the remote and tossed that at him, too.
Draco scowled at him.
Malfoy looked at Harry out of the corner of his eye.
“What do you mean you get tired of it?  Wait- you and the Weaselette split up?” Malfoy sat up in his seat.
Draco glanced at the knitting ladies who were now crowding around the pastry case. “Is there someone else you can reach? The other chef, perhaps?”
“Of course I know where food comes from. It’s just that I am never the one to get it. I get takeaway. Or go out.”
Draco nodded and pointed at Lovegood emphatically.
“Obviously.”
The date was a girl this time, blonde and posh. Her eyes were, disappointingly, vibrant blue. It went fine. They chatted and flirted a bit. Normally, he’d at least have gone back to hers, but Harry felt uncomfortable about it for some reason. An unknown reason that had nothing to do with a pair of all-consuming and distinctly grey eyes that haunted his dreams. It was a mystery why Harry didn’t go home with her, really, if he thought about it. Which Harry didn’t, obviously.
“Why not? She seems to do alright. She’s happy there. Don’t you want to be happy?”
“Oi, that’s my sister you’re talking about.” Ron halfheartedly protested and jostled Harry’s elbow.
How many people’s lives had Harry ruined by waiting as long as he did to meet his end?
“No more war, Dudley.” Harry said.
“What would calling 999 do?” Draco asked, not understanding what on earth that collection of words could possibly mean.
“Come lie down, have a nice cuppa,” she said. Harry traipsed behind her, over to the sofa, and tried not to feel terrible. Hermione’s eyes had dark circles beneath them. She was too tired to even remind Harry to remove his shoes. He did it anyway.
Pomona Sprout sat down on the sofa at the same time as Herb.  They smiled warmly at each other. Their faces were covered in age spots.  Pomona’s hair was fading from steely gray to white. Herb had no hair left at all.  They wore the comfortable clothing of the elderly. Soft robes with large clasps in solid colours.  Pomona’s purple robes had cat hairs along the collar, as did the bottom of Herb’s cloak.
“I dunno, he just…”  Hary trailed off and dove for the snitch.  It was flying up around Ron's ear. Ron looked quickly around and tried to snatch it out of the air.  Harry knocked him aside and they both tumbled off their brooms a foot or so to the ground, laughing.
Ron’s eyebrows shot up. “And that made you want to drink yourself stupid, did it?”
“We?”
“Oooh!” exclaimed Pansy, “What about Potter, then?”
“Draco hates football.”  Harry just couldn’t believe it.
Kreacher seemed somewhat appeased and backed out of the room.
Harry shrugged.  “What? We’re what?  Twenty? Loads of people don’t get laid until their twenties.”
Harry felt his cheeks get warm. He ran a hand through his hair, “That’s not what I was doing.”
“It started out with a kiss” Harry sang at him, a smile on his lips. “How did it end up like this? It was only a kiss.”
Draco wasn’t quite sure if he believed them, but he had more pressing matters to attend to. Such has his current state of undress. He glanced around for his shirt, but didn’t see it nearby.
“I know, I know..” She sighed, “He’s never going to leave her.”  She examined her reflection in the display window, standing in different positions.  She squeezed her cleavage together. “What about a permanent engorgement charm?”
“Oh? Could have fooled me.” Malfoy straightened his back and looked down his nose at Harry.
Draco peeked through the door again. The man was pacing and gesturing wildly with the knife in his hand. Draco glanced back at Olivia.
“Neville.”  Harry said, too brightly.  “I’m not a child you know.  I don’t have a problem with Neville.”
“We’ll have it at the end counter in just a mo’ Mr Potter. Any coffee to go with?” And that was it. No hush fell over the room. No one turned about in their chairs to gawk at him. Beautiful. He breathed a sigh of relief.
Harry quirked his eyebrow, “Relations?  Afraid of the word sex, are you?”
“What, bollocks?”
“You could say that.” Harry replied, slapping Ron on the back. “Alright?”
“Forget it. Let’s just get out of here.”
Merlin, it was only a one day transport.  It’s not as though their trip would take Potter from his girlfriend for months.  Draco tapped his foot loudly.
Draco accepted the bowl of lemons Pansy brought from the back.  She was out in classic Pansy style, bright red lipstick, black fringe, crisp white pressed shirt, skin tight.  The top buttons undone enough to where Draco could see to top of her red brazier pushing out, same shade as her lipstick.  He rolled his eyes. He sliced lemons while she walked about the bar taking the bar stools off the tables, setting them nicely down around the clean floors with a swish of her wand. Draco forced himself to slice with a knife instead of his wand.  He’d gotten good at it during his Year of Magical Abstinence. Now he kept up the habit. Not all his employees were voluptuous witches. It was a good habit to keep.
Harry had the decency to look abashed.  “I know. I’m lucky I didn’t get hexed, honestly.”
Harry arched an eyebrow at him.
“Brilliant, shove over.”
“Station’s the other way, love.” She called out.
Luckily, Harry was saved from further awkward conversation by the arrival of the bartender.
Harry blinked a few times.  “That’s bollocks. We can be mates.  We’re both seeing people, there’s nothing romantic involved.  We're not even trying to kill each other anymore.”
“And you’re certain they’ve all...   Enjoyed themselves?” he lowered his voice to a goading whisper, “because no one would ever fake it with you, the Great Harry Potter, would they?”
it was their own fault when their ears bled out. Draco certainly felt no compunction to warn them. Everyone with a cursory knowledge of wizarding history knew Caractacus Burke loathed music.
“Haaaaaaaaaaarrrrryyyy”  Draco drew his name out, more filthy than anything Harry had ever heard.  Draco balled his hands into fists and hit the table softly.
“Next day she’d thought about it and wanted to separate.  Just for a bit. While she’s away for the European circuit.  Then when she’s playing matches in the UK we can try going on dates again.” Harry struggled to keep from shouting.  “Wasn’t the whole point of marriage to stop dating? Why would I want to start over when we already love each other?  That’s bollocks!”
“The difference is how uncouth it is to spit food into a bin.  I think you’re right, we could never be friends. I do have standards, after all.”
Harry shrugged the shoulders of the body that belonged to him. He knew the body belonged to him.  But it didn’t feel right. Nothing about this day felt right. It was like he was watching Malfoy shake someone else’s shoulders who wasn’t Harry.
“I guess I put it out of my mind.  Didn’t seem real.  Though it does explain why Molly has been more prone to tears than usual.  She gets emotional about kids and that.”
The glasses were shoved into his hands.
“Why does he call you Drake?”
Ron stumbled over and slung an arm around Hermione.  “Happy New Year Malfoy!”  He glanced at Harry.  “Blimey!  You look posh!”
“Nks” he muttered. He blinked a few more times before putting them on. Eyes finally adjusted to the light, Harry could fully take in the imposing presence of his best mate, the renown Auror. Ron crossed his arms and chewed his bottom lip. Harry followed Ron’s gaze to the half empty bottle of whisky and tipped over the mug on the floor beside the bed.
The tightness in his chest was too much.
“Why didn't he love me, Harry?  Why doesn’t anyone love me?”
“At Tesco. You remember Tesco, yeah?”
“And what was the answer?”
“My marriage was arranged, as most pureblood unions are.” she said.  Her voice was soft but firm, almost like a disapproving librarian.  “The women of the Black family had their spouses chosen for them if they desired to remain in the family.  You did as you were told or you were out.  That was the way of things.”  Narcissa paused and licked her lips and she shifted slightly in her seat.  “That’s not to say I wasn’t nervous.  My sister Bella found out who I was going to marry before I did.  She taunted me that he was hideous with warts, boils, and worst of all that he was of muggle lineage.  I knew it couldn’t be true but I had to see for myself.
“Potter,” he breathed.
Ginny turned her head expectantly toward Draco.
“‘S fucked.” Ron slurred.
“Luc? Yeah, he’s fine.  We went to a football match with him last week.”
Harry smiled into his pillow cushion.
“You’re wrong.”  Malfoy couldn’t let it go.
“How had I forgotten she was pregnant?”
Harry sat beside him and George passed a cigarette.
“Fancy a pint?” Harry asked.
Harry shrugged.  “People like watching things at home.”
Harry shook his head and took another bite out of his burger.  “I can tell the difference. I’d know if they didn’t.”
“Why do you keep laughing?” he whispered urgently.
A small and confused smile took over Mrs Weasley’s face. Like the one she had when Mr Weasley brought home a new muggle gadget. “I’m not sure what you mean, dear.”
“Going full muggle, I see?” Jean commented, his eyes sweeping up Draco’s attire.
“I know.”
Honestly, Draco didn’t. Not that he’d say so to this man, who was clearly grieving. Draco couldn’t even meet his eyes. What was there to say? That it was true? That he regretted everything about his life? That he was sorry? As if that would make any difference. It didn’t sway public opinion at his trial and it wouldn’t make a difference now. Draco did nothing to defend himself.
He wondered vaguely if that had been Malfoy he spotted today. It was a flash of blonde hair, exactly the right colour.  But Malfoy wouldn’t be in Muggle London.
Blaise brought him the cutting board with the venomous flowers. Draco dropped three at a time into the cauldron at thirty-second intervals. During which, Blaise suspiciously said nothing. Draco set the cutting board down and turned to face his friend.
She waited for a follow up query.  Draco stepped on Harry’s toe.
“Uncle Harry!  Uncle Ron!’ Teddy yelled.  “You have our brooms!”
But a hush fell over the crowd of would be rabble-rousers.
“In the living room.”
“I won’t do it,” Harry said. “I’m done! I’m a live human being, not a bloody mascot.” How long had it taken for nothing to change? Harry wanted to scream or cry in frustration.
With that, he moved away from her.
“If it makes you feel any better, she was bored shitless the whole time.”
Potter looked at him and chewed his lip. “You’ve a fair point there. It makes no sense.”
“Just helping out, actually.” He added.
“We were sweethearts.” Herb added.  They spoke nearly in tandem, the familiarity of the story flowing easily between them.
“So how’re you, then?  No more blue hair?” Potter asked.  Draco felt Potter’s eyes roving over him.  Taking in the muggle slacks and form fitting high collared dress shirt with his sleeves buttoned to the wrist.  Draco resisted the urge to snap back that he wasn’t up to anything and Potter should bugger off. They were adults.  Potter wasn’t in uniform. Draco could be civil.
She nodded.
At some point he must have dozed off again because the next moment Kreacher’s voice woke him up at the door. “Master Harry?” he wheezed.
“Have you told them yet?” Harry asked.
“We’re worried about you, Harry.”
“A frog and shorts and a hat.  A frog, shorts and a hat.”
“Oh, that’s-  Oh..” Malfoy whispered, his voice husky and soft.   He licked his lips and bit down on the bottom lip.  "Unnngggh." he moaned.
Jean led the way up the stairs.  “Oh?”
“Hiya, Harry”
“Nothing. Looking forward to…” He waved the folder at her. What was her name again? Bridget?
“He stays away from the Daily Prophet.  He’s about as reclusive as Harry is.”
Malfoy stopped smiling, his face pensive.  “What’s happening here, Potter?” He indicated the pair of them with his long elegant finger.
Draco paled. “That’s not what I meant,” he blurted. “I was merely attempting to convey gratitude.”
“No argument here.” Harry added, a smile on his lips.  “You sound great, Malfoy.”
Millie arched her eyebrows at him. Draco was impressed by the difference addressing the unibrow made in her face. She looked, well, feminine.
"Of course, you're always welcome at Mood."
Harry frowned, “Don’t call her that.  It was a few years ago. We tried seeing other people but we got back together, didn’t we.  I got tired of trying to get to know other people. It’s hard to know who to trust with new people and it’s almost never worth it.  You go home with someone and have a good time. Then you’re lying there wondering how long have I got? How long do I lie here holding them before they try to get a photo of us in bed to sell to the press?  What is the right amount of time to hold someone before I can leave? Do I stay the night and risk exposure in my sleep? Is it worth risking a night’s stay to see if they’re the kind of person who wouldn’t sell my photo?”
Harry raised one of his eyebrows.
“I dunno if we’re playing another round after tea.  Maybe though.”
Shit, had he? Even so, if Malfoy felt anything toward Granger, it was guilt. And shame. And remorse. And very begrudging respect.
“Harry, thank god!” Hermione exclaimed when he walked through the back door. “Just bring those in here.” Harry set the pastry boxes down. With a flick of her wand, Hermione sent the pastries dancing through the air and lined up perfectly on some fancy long rectangular plates he didn’t recognise. “I was expecting you fifteen minutes ago.”
He nodded and got the drinks ready.
Malfoy threw Harry a disdainful glance, “I’ve read them, you neanderthal.  That’s beside the point. Would you kindly shut it so that I can enjoy quidditch in peace?”
An hour or so later, Harry found himself in Sirius’s old room. It was the room he avoided most. But tonight he couldn’t get the image of Sirius out of his head. Harry and his Firewhisky, the pretense of tea gone, explored the room he’d never touch while sober. The muggle posters of girls and motorcycles were the same as he remembered. How Sirius must have hated living at Grimmauld Place. Trapped by his family. Miserable. Alone. At least he had the Potters to escape to. At will. No bars on the windows here. Harry sighed and topped off his mug.
“Don’t you want to know what he’s up to?”
“What can I getcha, love?”
“An emotional outburst when we were teenagers is one thing.  You’re thirty-two now..”
“The separation.  She’s moved in with Neville.”
Draco cleared his throat and stuck out his hand.  “Longbottom, how are you?”
Harry’s hackles went up, “So it’s bigotry, is that it?  What happened to moving on?”
“Olivia,” he repeated. He gave her a lopsided grin and counted out the fifty quid. When a spot opened up at a small table, Harry sat and waited, his foot bouncing. It was going to be fine. Because he was doing fine. Ginny was fine. More than fine. She was getting married. He genuinely was happy for Ginny. Their breakup wasn’t exactly gut wrenching. It wasn’t even a breakup, really. After the war, they never got back together.They went out a few times, but it didn’t sit right. She seemed far away. Part of an existence Harry knew nothing about. A former life to which he couldn’t return. They mostly avoided looking at each other. When she made eye contact, there was no blaze of passion like before. Instead, Harry found pity in her eyes and he hated it.
He shuddered.
“Right.” Harry said.  “Course.  You went to a football match?”
Creevy took a deep, shuddering breath. The wand at Draco’s neck shook slightly as Creevy lowered it.
“I reckon you need another go with the mind healer, mate. I say this as your oldest friend.”
Draco dodged the question as he very much was not. “You won’t get into trouble with the owner?”
“It’s the phrasing that keeps it legal.  For the drinks we offer from the menu we had our solicitor draw up the phrasing.  As long as we say the phrase, ‘How would you like to feel’ and follow it up with “Would you like a potion for cheerfulness or whatever?”  It is verbal consent. It’s not different from ordering a calming herbal tea when you’re stressed. Or a coffee when you’re knackered. None of the potions are addictive and all of them, honestly, are less harmful than alcohol.”
“You don’t know everything about me, Draco, darling.”
Draco nodded and took a quick peek in each of his cauldrons.  He’d hung up a chart beside each one with a detailed schedule of when each step of the potion needed to be added next.   So far everything looked on track.
“Time!” shouted Granger.
“A knife?” Draco shook his head.  Muggleborns. He slid his wand out from his pocket.  He tapped the pomegranate and it split in half. He conjured a bowl and flicked his wand.  The pomegranate seeds flew in a perfect arch into the bowl. A knife indeed.
“Drink up.”
“Always with the dramatics, you are.”
What on earth was he on about?
Obviously.” Malfoy was incredulous.  “Do you think pureblood marriages happen because of physical intimacy?”
Hearing the words out loud was unexpected. He’d always suspected they were using him for his clout. But to hear it acknowledged brought his rage in full force.
“POTTER”
“Pardon?” Draco said, back at Jean’s side.
“Hadn’t noticed.  Check it out, it’s got a trap where if you touch it in the wrong order your fingers get coated in purple ink.”
“Right.” Harry sighed. “Sorry I asked.” He dropped his bag at the bottom of the stairwell. “Will Master Harry be needing dinner?”
“Harry?”
Harry laughed.  “I can’t remember, honestly.  It was nice though. I was expecting it to be well Posh but it wasn’t.  It was normal, friendly-like.”
Hermione let go of his hand and leaned back into the sofa, with a slight frown. She let the topic drop and Harry was grateful for it.
“Hand her over, love,” he said to Hermione. “I’ll take Rosie, you take Harry.” Hermione nodded and handed the screaming child over.
“Hiya.” Ginny said cautiously, walking in. She looked stunning in a green strapless gown of some material that couldn’t be muggle. It seemed to flutter behind her for just a moment too long to be natural, like she’d just stepped off a broomstick. Neville, too, looked dressed up. Harry couldn’t remember seeing him in a suit or dress robes since the last Hogwarts Memorial gala he’d attended a few years ago. Seeing them dressed up together put Harry a little on edge. The rest of the family filed back to their chairs behind them. Mr Weasley conjured two more for Ginny and Neville. Night had fallen and Mrs Weasley lit a few extra lanterns while she was up.
Draco shook his head, “Unbelievable.”
Harry paused.
“I didn’t mean- that’s beside-”  Malfoy took a breath and said more calmly, “What I mean to say is that this is what I’ve been groomed my whole life to do. Most traditional marriages in the wizarding world are built on strategic matches, not love matches.  Putting obligation above passion. Any rational person would do the same.” Malfoy went on. “People are very practical, even Muggles like Ingrid Bergman.”
Malfoy looked as though he had developed an acute headache, but Harry didn't see how that could have happened in the two minutes that had passed since he sat down.  Malfoy closed his eyes and pinched the bridge of his nose.
“Shhh…. Shh…” Harry rubbed his shoulders.
“Hi Harry,” Ginny said. She squeezed his shoulder as they passed to their seats.
Confusion passed over Draco’s face, “Pardon?”
Harry blinked rapidly and shook himself.  “Fancy getting some air?” he asked.
“Well, that went well.” Olivia said cheerily.
Harry found himself standing on the pavement, without a clue to how he’d gotten there or where he actually was.   He stood there a few moments watching the traffic go by before there was a gentle nudge at his elbow.
“So what, you’re living as a muggle now?”  Harry looked Malfoy up and down, taking in the jeans, the t-shirt beneath his leather jacket, and christ he was wearing a beanie.  “And you’re with Jean?”
“I’m not a child, Olivia. I know how shopping works.” he sneered.
Draco started giggling quietly at the thought of this muggle woman trying to comfort him. In a situation he could have fixed in a matter of moments. They heard another crash from the other side of the doors.
“What is Countdown?”
“‘M fine.” Harry mumbled.
“Oh yes, I remember that. He has excellent suits and a horrible laugh.”
Weasley looked as though he’d swallowed a lemon, “Shorts?  Surely not.  Malfoy, are those supposed to be shorts?”
The private moment Harry thought guilty for observing, never mind that it happened at the dinner table, was over quickly. It morphed into one much more familiar to Harry. Hermione’s eyes widened, and she leaned forward, one elbow on the table, her hand covering her mouth. When she began muttering to herself, Harry couldn’t keep from grinning.
“You’ve got to let me go if I’m going to make tea.”
Malfoy tugged the sleeve of his shirt down and looked away.
“Looking for this?” Millie held up a set of Hogwarts robes.
“Well, that’s not my fucking fault, is it?” Harry muttered.
Draco debated his next move. His father was in Azkaban. His mother was in France, getting newly acquainted with the long estranged Andromeda. Which left Draco at a bit of a loss. Family had always come first, right until it didn’t. Until
Malfoy was in Muggle clothes. And not even overly posh ones. Just an expensive looking tight t-shirt and black designer jeans. He was unrecognisable from who Harry knew at school and yet unmistakably Malfoy. No one else had his grey eyes. The high cheekbones and pointed chin. His beautifully pale collar bone that Harry wanted to-
“It is, though." Draco interrupted, "I’m awful.”
Weasley stared at him in stony silence for a moment. “I know.” Weasley crossed his arms. “That’s one of the many differences between us, Malfoy. I would never abuse my position.”
“It’s a karaoke machine.  You sing along with it.”
Draco threw his arms around Harry’s neck and sobbed.
“A pint of lager and a white wine.”  she said when she trotted back to him.
“We order dinner and the conversation’s a bit stinted, so I ask her about quidditch in America. And out of nowhere I’m having a full meltdown.”
Draco sighed and tapped the board again.
“I’ll take your word on it.  How are we selecting the appropriate box for Pansy and Roger?”
Harry slept in the next two days. It felt glorious, luxurious even. He couldn’t remember a time in his life he’d been able to sleep as long as he liked for days on end. No Dursleys to cook for. No breakfast in the Great Hall. No Auror training. No office hours at The Ministry. No spending the weekend dreading Monday’s arrival. Just sleep. Harry checked his watch and decided not to get up yet.
Harry shrugged, “Well it wouldn’t be the first time you’ve given a shitty interview about me I suppose.”  He gave Malfoy a look which was ignored.
The baby started making terrible noises. Granger heaved a sigh. “I’ve got to get home.” Draco caught her eye. “I’ll wait for your letter, Malfoy.”
“I most certainly did not!” Draco said.
The whole pub was watching them now, Harry realized in horror.  The server at the table behind them dropped her pen without noticing.  Draco threw his head back and gave one last satisfied, positively vulgar groan.  Slowly he opened his eyes to smirk at Harry.  Draco leaned in and whispered, “How certain are you?”
“Ron, seriously, it’s no big deal. So the fake snitch flew down his trousers?”
Harry hated parties.
They stood and raised their arms as the wave came round the stadium again.  When they sat down, Harry slumped in his seat. He stared at the concrete floor.  “It gets worse.”
“Really, Potter.” Draco said.  “You should get back out there.”
“No, you’re always breaking the rules in the most mental way possible.  You rode a bleeding dragon out of Gringotts for pity’s sake. And now you’re going to, what?  Get married and pop out a few children? Buy a nice cottage in the country?”
Harry must have had the same thought as he turned incredulously to Weasley, “Shirty Hat Shorts?”
“I kept the flat.” Malfoy said.  “I’ve got that much, at least.”
“Hiya.” Ginerva Weasley said.  She glanced between Draco and Harry.  Draco can feel the mild judgement at his presence radiating off her.  “How are you, Harry?”
Ron shook his head slowly and popped another bean into his mouth.  He chewed once before he cringed and spat it out. “Vomit.”
“No takers?” Harry edged out of the booth and got himself another pint. Malfoy and Dudley sharing a pint was a bit much. Let alone swapping stories about Harry saving them. He didn’t understand their admiration. Harry was just doing the right thing. What he was supposed to do. He wasn’t anything special for doing that. Surely his two childhood tormentors would see that. They were the two people who saw the worst things about him. This meeting was a terrible idea. Why did he agree to it at all, let alone drag Malfoy?
“It’s fine.” Hermione said quietly, “I suppose I was treating it the same as potions.”
He needed a muggle to speak with. There was nothing else to it. He glanced around the cafe. More time must have passed than he realized, because it was nearly vacant. Empty table after empty table. Then a couple arguing about kindling or firewood of some sort while showing each other smallish black rectangles in their hands. Draco glanced behind the counter and found the woman from the previous day wiping down the pastry case. The thought of speaking with her was too mortifying. She caught him staring and quirked a small half smile at him. Draco lost his nerve. He downed the last of his coffee and tossed his rubbish in the bin on his way out the door.
“Is that what you do, Malfoy?  Regulate yourself?  That’s why you’ve only been with, how many?  Is it none?  You’ve been with no one since Jean?  Because you’re in control of your emotions?”
consumed. Roger Davies got into an argument with George about the dangers of joke broomsticks. Davies recently transferred to the Wimborne Wasps after a few years with the Holyhead Harpies.  He and Harry had become friends when he played for the Harpies with Ginny.  He held very strong opinions on brooms.  Davies had done very well the last two years, becoming quite the popular public figure.  George didn’t give a shit.  Harry carefully avoided their argument.
They looked at each other, fighting off smiles before bursting out laughing.
Harry wasn’t sure Draco would come with him.  Ron and Hermione knew they were friends.  They accepted it.  There was one awkward dinner, months ago, where Ron and Hermione popped by unannounced to find the pair of them watching footy.  Draco had been mid insult when they stepped through the fire.  After a few moments of shock and a significant amount of awkwardness they decided to stay.  Wine made everything easier.  Harry didn’t remember much of that night.  There was a brief memory where he walked in the kitchen to find Draco shame faced, tears rolling down his cheeks across from Hermione similarly adorned.  He quietly backed out of the room and let them have at it.  Draco never spoke of it but afterwards, Hermione seemed to thaw toward him.
Harry laughed.
“Choking on your alibis” they sang together.
“Parney.  Stolls.”
Ron and Harry glanced at each other before turning back to Hermione with affectionate trepidation.
“ALRIGHT NEVILLE?” from George in the kitchen, followed by Neville’s laugh. Harry sighed. He wanted desperately to be at Grimmauld Place with a bottle of whisky. And then immediately felt guilty for wanting escape instead of face his replacement like an adult. He was the one who couldn’t maintain an adult relationship. He shouldn’t avoid Ginny and Neville. It wasn’t fair to any of them.
Harry laughed.  Malfoy was looking at him out of the corner of his eye, biting back a smile.
“Michael Corner?” Pansy asked.  “I personally would never. But you haven’t got a problem with messy hair.  You love it.”
Harry looked taken aback.  He opened his mouth to ask, but Draco didn't let him finish.
Harry shrugged, but the gesture was lost on account of the whole flying on a broomstick in the air chasing a snitch thing.
They replaced the prodding with shaking.
“You want me to endorse you knowing nothing about what you’re up to.”
“Yeah well, he was a Death Eater, innit.”
“I really must insist we depart.” Draco interrupted.
“Olivia?” he called out. No answer. He dug his wand out of his trouser pocket and cast a scourfingy. He was too tired for an actual shower. After he kicked off his shoes and spread out along the entirety of the sofa, Draco looked about for the remote to turn the tv on. The damn thing was on top of the tv. Too far to actually reach. The idea of sitting up to get it was unfathomable. Draco reached for his wand again, without moving his body.
“I saw Malfoy yesterday,” admitted Harry.
“Harry!” Jean shook his hand “I’m great, mate.  Smashin it.”
There was a voice from the queue behind him. “Come on, then!”
Draco sat in his seat.   At least he was in the Top Box.
The grey eyes tightened. His jaw ticked. Harry swallowed and quickly added, “As posh as ever.”
Hermione and Ron glanced at each other while the others were distracted. His arm draped across the back of her chair. He leaned in and planted a kiss on her temple. Harry watched the tension drain out of her shoulders. Hermione closed her eyes and leaned into Ron’s shoulder. He murmured something in her ear and she smiled softly up at him. Harry’s heart ached.
Dudley flinched at the word, and Harry had to stop himself from rolling his eyes.
“Er..”
“Olivia,” said Olivia with a cheeky wink.
“No tea, then?”  Harry huffed a soft laugh, “Alright, darling.”  He wiped the tears from Draco’s face and kissed him on the forehead.  It was the third time he’d kissed Draco.  Harry didn’t pull back right away.  Draco looked up, a heat sparked between them.  The air was thick.  Harry’s face was hovering above his, a breath away.  He kissed Draco’s cheek like a question, lingering and hesitant.  Draco’s heart pounded in his chest.  He was sure Harry could hear it.  Draco turned his head to bring their mouths closer together.  Harry leaned in and this time Draco closed his eyes.  Harry’s lips were softer than he expected, firm and warm on Draco’s own.  Draco reached a hand up and pulled him closer.  His fingers sneeked into Harry’s unmanageable hair.
“TWO!”
“Yeah, well that symptom is fucking my wife.” Harry said, dejectedly.
“What?”
CRACK
Ron narrowed his eyes. “You’re writing? Can we see it?”
Hermione pursed her lips and set down her mug. “Harry, I know this isn’t what you thought you’d be doing as an Auror. I don’t want you to think that you can’t talk to us about it. Just because Ron’s loving it doesn’t mean you have to, as well.”
Harry grinned at Malfoy again.  He wasn’t sure he knew all his letters at age five let alone spell the word family. “She’s doing better than I was at that age.”
“How was that not all over The Prophet?” she asked, still whispering.
“There you are, sir.” The young lady skittered to a halt outside Harry’s office. “I’m glad I caught you.” She huffed a couple of breaths before handing Harry a folder. “I’ve just got your schedule for next month”
“Shhh….  Of course not, darling.”  Harry cooed.
“You don’t want that one, trust me.”
“I just meant-”
“A wizard?”
“Who, Luc?”
“You’ll be alright.”  Harry turned and placed a kiss on Draco’s forehead.  “You want tea?  I can put the kettle on.”
“Are you alright?”
“Still,”  Potter glared at the people in the station again. Then he waved his wand and said something under his breath that Draco couldn’t quite make out.  After that no one around them seemed to hear anything they said. They got a few curious looks but no significant interest. Potter squared his shoulders and finished reading from the parchment.
“This is precisely why I don’t date married men, Pansy.”  Draco finished up the bar prep and went over to his custom drinks board.  It was his favourite thing about Mood.
on his glasses.
“You know what we mean.” Victorie admonished.
“Of course not.”
“Jean?”
He summoned the pomegranate back to his pocket with the flick of his wand.
“That’ll be five Galleons.” The shopkeeper glared at Draco and slid the parchment across the counter.
“Have you never done the shopping before?” Potter’s gaze was intense, as always. The green eyes twinkled at him. Draco found himself a bit warm, before the words sunk in.
“Hermione, this is an odd reaction to a handful of memories.”
“Ugh, don't remind me.  I will never get my first kiss back, Draco.  I’m just saying, you don’t want to wait too long, love.  Marcus Belby took a bludger to the head, died instantly only just last year.”
The handshake went on a half a second too long, before they dropped their hands.
Harry shrugged.
“It started out with a kiss. How did it end up like this.  Harry?  Potter, I’m singing, you idiot.  You got your wish what are you-”
Draco was afraid to ask what a Flerble Moth was and turned to Luc, “Do you, then?  Fancy a cuppa?”
Draco ignored her.
“Potions room.” Draco answered.
“There’s a lot more to family cooking than reading books.” Mrs Wealey said offhand.
Merlin Potter was exhausting. “I should have.”
Harry couldn’t help but roll his eyes.  “I don’t actually need a flat. I couldn't stay in it without Ginny anyway.  I’ve still got 12 Grimmauld Place. How’d you find a wizarding flat in muggle London, anyway?”
“We went to school together.” Malfoy supplied for him.
“Amazin, it was. Course he didn’t know it was you till it come out in the papers later. A bleedin Dragon! Out of Gringotts!”
“I understand your concern, sir. But it’s something I’ve got to do for myself. I’ve made my final decision.”
“That was mental.” Olivia wheezed.
“Oh.” he said aloud.
It was disgusting watching them haul away the Malfoy library in particular. They didn’t even have the forethought to pack the books into properly sectioned trunks. They waved their grubby wands and paid no heed to what went where. If the Ministry Officials were stupid enough to put
Olivia and Draco stared at each other and burst out laughing. Draco knew in that moment they were friends.
“You should get back out there, Harry.”
“I can’t believe they let his sort in.”
“Will do.”
And suddenly Draco very much wished he hadn’t answered at all.
“Mum will be beside herself.”
“IT WAS A METAPHOR.” Harry shouted as Draco was dragging him out the door.
He’d contacted his solicitor to ensure he wasn’t breaking any laws.  Draco had a potions lab built into the back of the bar after he bought it.  He also happened to live above the bar, and ended up buying the building along with the bar. It was one of the things he was most proud of.  Combining potions with cocktails. He tapped the chalkboard with his wand and a lovely image of a cherry cocktail appeared in red and white chalk.
“Did you just say you could have done without parents? Mr My-Father-Will-Hear-About-This?” It wasn’t the worst impression of Draco.
“You are unbelievable.”
Creevy’s eyes widened and half a second later the shock became rage. Creevy’s hand went for his wand. Draco dared not reach for his own. In an instant Draco was up against the wall, bricks digging into his back, wand tip singeing his throat.
Vera added curt but not unkind, “But first you lived with Priya.”
“You’re so posh..” she trailed off, unable to breathe. “You’re so posh you’ve never been to Tesco!”
“I was a bit, yeah.”
Harry felt himself being manoeuvred. The pain in his forehead receded to the memory it was. He kept his eyes closed until he felt the cool night air on his face. He felt a brick wall at his back and took a few steadying breaths before he opened his eyes.
Olivia laughed. “Brilliant, so Jimmy Carr hosts a version of Countdown and it’s brilliant.”
“What?”
“Then why are you sharing it with me?”
"We were together for five years and marriage only came up once.  And that was during the breakup."  Draco practically shouted through his sobs.  "All this time I was fine because at the end of the day I wanted a family and he didn’t.  He said he didn’t want a family.”  Draco drew a deep breath and wiped his eyes. “But that’s not it.  That’s not it at all.  He just didn’t want those things with me.”  Draco felt wretched.  Like every fear of rejection from his family, from society was wrapped up and delivered in the most gutting rejection of them all.  "He didn't want me.  No one wants me, not really."
“I can’t believe you’ve split up!"  she went back to the mirror to fine tune the fringe that had come out of place in her outburst.  " I mean, for pity's sake.  You had someone in your life! And you’ve let it go to waste.”
Harry realised his wand was still on the bench and picked it up, shoving it in his back pocket.
“Ummmgh.”
“It’s not?”  Harry felt he should probably be offended.
“Ugh. Breeders.” said Draco with disgust.
“If you say so.”  Jean’s mouth pressed into a thin line.
“Ah, well. That’s something, then.” He smiled at her and grabbed the bags of boxes of pastries off the counter. “Cheers!”
“Look Draco, you don’t have to stay in London. Blaise said your mum has invited you to France. Why not go see her? Get out of the country for a while.”
“Drake?”
Hermione handed him the scroll. When he unrolled it, Harry found it was actually two pieces of parchment. One was a list titled Ameliorative and Productive Outlets for Harry. He smiled at it fondly.
They went into the empty garden, breathing harder than they should have for the exertion it took to get outside.  They stood together, leaning on a stone wall looking over the garden, lit by the beautiful blue flames.
Jacinda looked up from her mobile with a puzzled expression on her face. “Question for you, who on earth uses newspapers?”
“I’ve baked.” He said evasively. “Not professionally. More amateur..”
“Right, the muggles probably had an eclectrick washer.”
Ron eyed it disparagingly, “This seems like a lot of wasted effort.” But he wiped as Harry washed. Harry wondered if this was what it would have been like as a child of The Burrow. Washing up with a brother instead of alone. It seemed nice.
Blaise leaned back in his seat to watch the young lady show off her ample behind. The amount of wiggle was more than strictly necessary for retrieving pastry. “It doesn’t look so bad from here.”
“I prepare food for mug- for people nearly every day,” Draco drawled. “As you well know.”
“Did I tell you I’ve been to Draco’s bar?” Harry mounted his broom and took off into the air.  The Cleansweep wobbled a bit and Harry had to be very firm in directing the handle. He should have brought his Firebolt.  Or at least get Molly and Arthur a set of new brooms for the grandkids to play on.
“Here you are, perfect!” Pansy slid
“Done without parents.” He kept moving but Potter kept following.
Ron tutted and shook his head but didn’t press the matter.
“Poorly.” Draco said resentfully. “So where do we get this Nescafe you speak of?”
Pansy squeezed his wrist (the right one) and delivered the drinks.  The night picked up fairly quickly, as Fridays usually did. By the time Lou came in Draco was ready for a break.  He went through the back of the bar to his potions room. He drew the curtain aside, the muggle repellent wards along the doors sent a cool chill down his spine as he crossed the threshold.  The room held only two cauldrons, and as such he only served two specialty “Mood” drinks a night. They were built into the wall, adjacent to each other leaving the wall to the right of the door as his workspace.
Harry let out a bark of a laugh.  “So they haven’t. I haven’t seen you since..”
“Because,” Harry said, “you have not known true joy until you have given a wizard the gift of electronics.  Their flat is in muggle London, it will be fine.  Besides, I once gave Ron’s dad an espresso machine.  He cried from pure happiness.  Mind you, he’s a bit off his rocker when it comes to muggle shite.”
“I called it his ma-”
” She said. “Like Sainsbury’s. Waitrose?”
For some reason, Potter wasn’t angry with him. Challenging, yes. But there was humour in those deep green eyes instead of the repulsion Draco conditioned himself to expect.
“Potter. What’s the matter with you?” he demanded.
“Harry, mate.” he said, closing the notebook. “This Malfoy obsession is not healthy.”
Draco’s mouth thinned to a line, as he tried to tamp down on his frustration.  He shook his head and pointed at the image again.
“I never said that.”
Once through the door, Harry ran right into a straggling knitter. Her yarns tumbled onto the pavement.
Five minutes later they reached the Port Key Arrival outside the quidditch pitch out of breath and grinning like fools.  Jean put his hands in his pockets and held out the crook of his elbow. Draco smirked at him and looped his own arm through. They made their way through the crowd to the Top Box.  If there were a few detours to dark corners to continue their previous activities, well Draco wasn’t going to complain.
Indeed he was.  Potter ran a hand up the back of his neck into his mussed hair.  The shadow of a beard Draco remembered from the last time they saw each other had grown to a full beard.  Not too long, and it seemed much better groomed than his mad hair which stuck up all over, much as it ever had.
“Happy New Year.” Draco said.  They were a few inches apart and the space between them was soft and delicate and gathering heat.  The sound of people singing came wafting out through the open windows:
“Not particularly,” Harry said.
“Is that what that is?” Blaise peered suspiciously into Draco’s cup. “I’ll pass. Is the coffee any better?”
“Call us if you need anything. Anything at all.”
“Let’s go to the kitchen.” Blaise turned, headed out. Draco stirred his cauldron anti-clockwise eight times. He cast a timing charm to let him know when ten minutes had passed before he followed Blaise to the kitchen and his now empty wine glass. Blaise refilled it but didn’t pour one for himself.
“George!” Mrs Weasley admonished.
“Come on, I’m trying to do something nice for you here. You’re not upset are you?”
Draco hated everything, but this morning in particular. He hated that the dream was interrupted.  That it was, in fact, only a dream and would forever be only a dream.  He hated his parents for the terrible things he was raised to believe that prevented the dream from becoming a reality. He hated the Death Eaters for the terrible things they made Draco do as a brainwashed teenager. He hated the wizarding world as a whole for being so hypocritical. For not forgiving him. He hated how many opportunities he’d wasted. If only he hadn’t been such an unbearable little shit as a child then perhaps the dream stood a chance at becoming reality.
He coughed politely. They ignored him, naturally.  Draco’s eyes darted around the platform. The Ministry’s platform was just crowded enough that most people ignored him.  Only a few scathing looks were pointed his direction, upon recognition. Fifteen minutes until departure.
“Nah. If anyone asks where she is, I can just pretend I didn’t hear them.” George said. He didn’t quite manage a smile. George packed the box of cigarettes a few times. He slid a second one out and twirled it about on his fingers a few times before sliding it back in the box. He inclined his head towards The Burrow, “Reckon we should head back in?”
