“She’s going to be fine, Malfoy,” Ron assures him. “Her parents acted quickly and the Healers were able to reverse the curse. They’re just keeping her for monitoring to make sure nothing else happens.”
,” Zacharias continued, “Prince Voldie’s worst fears will be confirmed and Wiltshire will be forced to go to war with Surrey.”
“Are you getting emotional over the size of your bed?” Harry seemed genuinely surprised at Draco’s reaction.
She let out a fond laugh. “Whatever makes you most comfortable.” Walking to her desk, she made herself comfortable and said, “Hobsey?”
Lacking any sort of grace, Harry shrugs out of his shirt and pulls off his trousers, kicking his shoes off towards the wall. He blushes when he hears Draco’s laugh.
“We’re the same age,” Draco insists, still nibbling at Harry’s jaw. He moves to the lobe of Harry’s left ear and gently bites, and, thankfully, it shuts Harry up.
“Oh, don’t start feeling sorry for yourself.” Emily grabbed her phone and turned the telly off. “You know it’s a good idea, Draco.”
The next week Harry is able to take Draco out to Pasta Was a Rolling Stone again. They both wear looser clothes and eat their way through several amazing dishes and a cannoli that’s so perfect, it brings tears to Harry’s eyes. They’re too full to do more than roll around in Draco’s bed and kiss. Harry spends the night and they wake up with just enough time to kiss a bit. Harry has to Floo back to his flat for a quick wank before work.
“Still.” Potter paused and Draco ran through a few spells to try to turn the lights off. “You called me Malfoy.”
Harry nods and puts on his work face to show Malfoy he’s paying attention. Ron swivels his chair so they’re both staring at Malfoy.
“Potter,” Draco groans the next morning. “You’re sleeping on the sofa with that beastly thing tonight.”
He and Harry have just finished at a crime scene and are about to Apparate back to their office at the DMLE. Harry's struck speechless by Ron's assessment.
“Is one of you Harry Potter?” Their server has rushed to the table and looks frantic. “There’s a call for you and they said it was quite urgent.”
“Yeah—” Harry looked at the sky that was rapidly losing all of its pinks and oranges and turning dark blue. “I’ll pop by later and we can talk.”
year, however, Harry and Draco are newly married, and Scorpius finally has siblings. A house full of Potters has done him a lot of good. He’s still a bit of an odd duck, but it’s apparent he’s easier in his own skin.
Draco walks away from the Floo to put his things away. When he turns back to Scorpius and the niffler, he lets out a sigh.
Suddenly the fear that he will overeat and his little tummy will make an appearance in his slim-fitting shirt is gone. Harry’s not sure if he’ll ever be able to eat again. Somehow, during all of the fieldwork and the dinner at Ron and Hermione’s, Harry has forgotten how incredibly
That seems to be all it takes for Draco because his neck and back are arching up, his hips stutter under Harry, and his face, neck, and chest turn bright red. A few seconds later, he collapses like a rag-doll.
“Is there a big difference?” asked the man in black, conversationally, while weaving around the giant.
Harry cut him off with a laugh. Draco smirked back at him and Harry took a second to really look at Draco. He was smiling back at Harry, his eyes reflecting the flicker of the fire, his hair slightly staticky from the dry air, and the fondest expression on his face.
“This pulls out to be a guest bed if you have someone over,” he said. “We did use quite a bit of magic on it to make everything comfortable, so please be careful with it.”
using Scorpius’ nickname meant he was fighting a losing battle. Astoria had always called Scorpius ‘Scorp’ and they both know when Draco uses it, it means he’s feeling soppy and willing to give Scorpius his way.
Zacharias continued with his rant. “Hermione,  you were wasting your life away, sad and pathetic, too drunk to buy brandy! And Ron! Do you want to go back to where you were? Unemployed?!? In
Draco smirked back at him and grabbed his wand. “We can do that,” he said and cast, making Harry’s clothes disappear.
“Oh, well if that’s the case.” Draco leaned back down to kiss him again, making sure to keep his kisses small and teasing. “I’m happy to just kiss you, but if there’s something you wanted to try…”
Draco kissed him again. He pulled back and wiggled around so he was straddling Harry. “Is this OK?” he whispered.
Harry shrugs. He knows he looks good, his job, when it’s not dull paperwork, is very physical and he knows his body shows the strength he’s gained while being an Auror. He’s still got a little bit of softness around his waist and pecs and his stomach pooches out a little when he overeats, but overall, he’s very pleased with his body.
“I’m you,” almost-but-not-quite Draco says. “And you can stop calling me ‘almost-but-not-quite Draco’ in your head.”
“Working the case like you’re supposed to solved it,” Ron says. “If you want, you can sit in on the interrogation.”
Draco’s happy to comply. Harry moves so he’s on the far side of the bed, and Draco lays down next to him.
Draco is sat at the table and Harry realises he’s still standing and gaping at Draco. He pulls his jacket off and drapes it over the back of his chair. He’s thrilled to see Draco’s face has gone pink and because his hair isn’t covering his ears, Harry is able to see exactly how red Draco’s ears have gone.
Weekend bookings meant that Draco was free during the week to be a dad. Scorpius was eight and the light of Draco’s (and Narcissa’s) eye. Draco had never meant to get married and have children, but when Astoria Greengrass had needed a way out of her family’s clutches, Draco had tried to be braver than his teenage-self and had promptly proposed. They'd never expected to find love, what with Draco being incredibly gay and Astoria having no interest in either relationships or sex, but she had offered him an heir. Through Muggle means, of course. They'd very dutifully gone to a Muggle fertility clinic and had done achingly gauche things in little rooms with peeling wood panelling and magazines of Muggle women with unbelievably impossible breasts. Narcissa had stopped her little ‘hints’ about having a grandchild and the Greengrasses had stopped pestering Astoria about being a ‘proper’ wife. All in all, it had been an extremely satisfactory arrangement. The love that Draco had developed for Astoria had been both unexpected and so very welcome. The blood curse, however, that had taken her life when Scorpius was five had been one of the lowest points of Draco’s life.
Draco sends him a genuine smile at that. “I guess there’s a lot I still have to learn about Harry Potter.”
Draco let himself have a little lie in the next morning. He hadn’t gotten drunk the previous night, but he had been anxious before talking with his mother and he had a bit of an emotional hangover. In bed, Draco let himself think about what Potter had named their store.
“Alright there, Harry?” Neville asked as he walked in with the Gryffindor First Years in tow. “Feel like drying off in the Common Room?”
“Ronald!” Draco shouts, making Harry’s ear hurt. “I’m taking Harry home.” He pulls Harry away from the corner he’s lurking in and makes him sit on the sofa in the sitting room. Then, with a
Ron jumps at the crack of Apparition and Draco walks through the door, wand casting as soon as he’s past the threshold. Harry takes a minute to watch him work.
Potter looked at Draco again with his too-bright green eyes. “I’ll send the paperwork to my solicitor tomorrow,” he said. “She can expedite the process so we should be able to open in a fortnight.”
“I only ask because when I was ten, my father was killed by a woman with six fingers on her left hand. He was a muggle and as such had no magic himself. But he was wonderful at carving wood and worked with a wizard, making wands. The six fingered woman commissioned a new wand, and after it was made, she found out the wandmaker worked with a muggle and slew both my father and the wandmaker. The wand responded to me so I challenged her to a duel.” Hermione looked down at the ground sadly. “She gave me this,” she pointed to a curse scar on her right cheek then turned to show a matching scar on her left cheek, “and this. I’ve studied dueling for the last fifteen years so that I could defeat her and avenge my father. When I find her, I will tell her: ‘Hello. My name is Hermione Granger. You killed my father. Prepare to die.'”
goblet so as to keep it far from you so I cannot drink the wine in front of me.” His voice got higher and louder as he continued his tirade. The man in black didn’t say a word, just kept the small smile on his face.
“Ew,” he whined. “Why is it you two get this,” he waved his hand at them, “and I’m stuck mooning over Harry fucking Potter like I’m a second year?”
Instead of taking that as the warning Draco meant, Scorpius lets out a little coo. “He just wants shiny things,” he says. “I like them too,” he tells the animal as he gives it to his gran.
“Why would Bellatrix leave something here?” he asks. “If her goal was to hurt Muggles, what would she accomplish by hiding a cursed object somewhere nobody would want to visit?”
“OK, that’s my cue to drag Harry home,” Draco interrupts. Gently grabbing Harry’s arm, he pulls him out of Hermione’s embrace. “Don’t sniff people,” Draco scolds gently.
“Are you?” Harry says, louder than he means. “Do you have plans tonight? Dinner plans?” He shakes his head. “Of course you do, it’s your birthday.”
Harry held his hands up in a placating manner. “That’s not how I meant it.” He paused, his brow furrowed. “They don’t care about
“I don’t care if the sodding Minister for Magic calls it ‘We-Be’s’,” said Draco with a grimace. “The name is ridiculous enough on its own. Please just call it Weather-Be’s.”
Harry has to bite back a smile. For all that Ron wants to know everything, in reality, he usually doesn’t want to know
Draco couldn’t stop his laugh at Hermione’s face. He finally started to think they might all have a successful afternoon together.
“No, stay,” Harry insists in a rush. “I just wanted you to know that I’m yours and you’re so hot that I melted and that’s why I’m such a moron when you’re here.”
Lily starts talking about wanting bolognese while Al makes faces at her. Jamie wants bacon sarnies because that’s
headlines and promptly levitates it to the bin. Scorpius snorts, but doesn’t retrieve it. Then they venture out to Diagon so Draco can do some shopping and Scorpius socalise.
Hermione walked away and thought for a moment. She came back to the cliff. “What if I gave you my word on the soul of my father, Dentist Granger, that you shall reach the top alive?”
The man in black looked up and down the giant’s body, taking in his oversized muscles and their incredible difference in height.
Emily sighed. “You’re actually right about that,” she said. “I thought there would be more creature-on-creature action, too.”
“Mate…” Ron trails off and Harry closes his eyes. The silence stretches out for half a minute before Ron says, “I’m sorry.”
“Yep,” Harry agreed. “I would also like to point out that now that you’re naked and in the open, I have refrained from staring at you like a creep.”
“Can we—” Harry starts but Draco cuts him off when he licks into Harry’s mouth. “Mmmmmrp—” Harry finishes.
Harry is more than OK with that. He rolls out of the bed, finally freed from his spider monkey husband, and walks towards the bathroom. They’re in a suite that has a glass encased shower with three showerheads and a little tiled seat. Draco probably knows what it’s called, but Harry hasn’t a clue. No matter the name of the fancy shower things, Harry thinks he and Draco can get up to a lot of fun activities in their room in the three days they’re going to be staying in France.
“I should hope so,” Ron said. Then his face turned thoughtful. “He’s widowed,” he said with a frown. “From all accounts, it seems like they actually loved each other. I’m sure he took her passing hard.” Ron looked at Hermione and Harry could see his heart start to break at the thought of losing Hermione. “Wouldn't wish that on anyone,” he whispered.
“Beautiful isn’t it?” she asked as she waved it over his body, now dripping blood on Harry. “It’s my own invention.” Harry grunted. “Yes, it
“Shall I use small words?” Draco asked, a bit gleeful in taunting Potter, something he hadn’t realised he had missed.
“No! Bad Harry!” Emily shouted. “You used to be so kind and sweet! I can’t believe Draco rubbed off on you!”
He kissed Draco again, just a quick peck, the same act that Draco had gotten jealous at Emily and Stella for. It wasn’t a huge, romantic moment. It was small and sweet and genuine.
And it wasn’t that Harry was doing anything particularly incriminating, but he hadn’t expected Draco to barge into the bathroom when Harry was doing
Draco leaned in to kiss him. “I’m still calling bullshit on that.” He kissed Harry again. “But you look really good on my new duvet so we’ll let it slide.”
The store was packed. People were having a hard time moving and Draco could barely think over the various conversations.
They went inside, which led to Draco stalking to his room and the subsequent gnawing of his elbow by sharp, small teeth.
He follows Draco to his room in silence and averts his eyes when Draco shrugs out of his dressing gown. Draco’s left standing in his pants, tight black cotton, with a defiant look on his face. There’s no possible way either of them are getting hard, but Harry drinks in Draco’s appearance like it’s his very own vial of liquid luck. His eyes stutter to a stop at the pale pink nipples, pebbling in the cool air and a flash of black swoops around his chest, too fast for Harry to recognise.
Then after Hogwarts Harry and Ron had gone into Auror training and Malfoy had been training to be a Curse Breaker and they'd had a couple of classes that overlapped over the next several years at the Ministry. He had been very well liked by his fellow students. He'd still worn tight white vests, but this time they'd been under soft hoodies instead of flannel. His hair had still been longer than his early school years and curled at the ends. Harry had been the only person he knew who'd been surprised that Malfoy had graduated first in his class.
“Oh, yes,” Harry answers. He puts as much heat into his voice as possible and says, “I want you to open me up and fuck my arse.”
Adopting a kitten must be what like having a newborn is like, Draco decides. The first night the damn thing woke them both up every two hours. It,
“Harry.” Draco pulled him into another kiss. There was nothing small or sweet about it. Draco licked into Harry’s mouth, teased his tongue so that it followed Draco’s and then sucked on it. “I think you’re misunderstanding me.”
“Hello, Malfoy, it’s Potter,” Draco said. Then, realising what he’d said, he yelped. “Potter! You and Emily’s scheming won’t meet a good end!”
Draco grabbed a danish and shoved it in his mouth. “You were drunk, you don’t remember,” he said, spraying crumbs over his linens and bringing shame to his ancestors.
“There’s a good kitty,” Draco whispers, as Bob opens his mouth in a little yawn. “My sweet, sweet boy. My darling cat, such a big yawn.”
Ron and Hermione were almost at the castle when they heard a blood curdling scream. Stopping so suddenly it made Ron trip, Hermione looked around the little circle of trees they were standing in. “Ron,” she whispered as the agonised wail continued for long seconds. Hermione reached for her wand as the cry got more piercing and Ron shuddered, covering his ears. Then as suddenly as it had started, the wail cut off.
He felt himself start to smile and had to turn back to cleaning up because if he encouraged Hermione, she would mother him as much as Ron and Ron was enough of a mother hen for Harry.
Grabbing Draco’s hand, Harry walked to the Forbidden Forest. “Your prince will never catch us now,” he said with obvious glee. “We’ll be safe in the Forbidden Forest.”
Emily looked back and forth at them with a bemused expression on her face. “You two know each other?”
There were various nods and several people said ‘yes,’ and Draco decided it would be better to ignore them all and take Harry his coffee.
“Well that’s just because you’ve got one of those faces,” Draco said. But he did take a look around the town centre and he did see several people who were glaring at Potter.
Harry’s perpetual awkwardness threatens to rear its ugly head so he takes a healthy gulp of wine and grabs a piece of fried food.
sign over his head. He's looking at one of his bookshelves and Harry can see a small tremor running along his shoulders.
Harry, Draco decided, was a much better helper than Scorpius. That was to say, there was nothing wrong with his son, but the attention to detail and just
“Molly Wealsey?” Draco stood up from his squashy chair in the corner, looked at Harry, and sat down again.
There’s a beat of silence as Draco tries to stare out of the corner of his eye to see what Harry’s doing. When he finds Harry’s staring at him with a dopey grin, he clears his throat.
“You knob,” Neville said, fondly. “I was saying you didn’t have to.” Harry watched Neville’s next thought cross his face. “But you know, he
Harry starts his exploration by kissing Draco’s forehead, then moving down to between his eyebrows, then the tip of his nose, then his mouth. He doesn’t spend long there, moving to nip at Draco’s earlobe, then down to suck a spot into Draco’s neck.
“You prat,” Harry says fondly. “You know all Astoria wanted was for you and Scorp to be happy. She practically had ‘someone please date Draco Malfoy and bugger him senseless’ engraved on her headstone.”
“So standard operating procedure will be to contain and bring the objects to you?” Ron asks, suddenly in full-Auror mode.
He cast, extinguishing the fire and shuttering the windows, then motioned to the stairway. Draco followed him up to the second floor.
“I think something nicer than a cuppa,” Harry said. “We open Malfoy’s Menagerie tomorrow. Can we get some champagne?”
After Emily had finished checking in the guest, Draco walked up to her flat and took the large hunk of brownie from her.
Malfoy turns around, frowning. “It’s definitely one of Bellatrix’s,” he says. “But she didn’t leave it here. I found a hint of someone else’s magic, hidden quite well, on the girl mouse.”
“I don’t think we have to worry about the first one,” Harry said, gently. “And as for the second one, isn’t that a good thing?”
Draco leaned away from Potter at that. He couldn’t recall a single time he hadn’t been ‘Malfoy’ and to suddenly be ‘Draco’ in the middle of the Blue Moon was disconcerting, to say the least.
“So would you like to explore more on your own?” Harry asked. “Hermione did relent and expanded your closet.”
“Well, then we will see you all on Saturday,” Hermione declared. “Now, go home. I have to work in the morning and Rose has school which means we’re all up early.”
Harry is gentle when he moves up to kiss Draco again, and Draco lets himself be consumed. There are bright spots of pain where Harry has sucked bruises into his neck and torso, but Harry’s warm and solid against Draco. After a few seconds, Harry moves down Draco again, this time focusing on his nipples.
Harry's breath is harsh to his ears and he feels little tendrils of sweat starting to form on his upper lip, behind his knees, at the base of his skull. Every third stroke, or so, Draco's cock grazes Harry's prostate and Harry can feel the sensation down to his toes.
With a flick of his wand, Draco sent all of the rubbish to the bin and all of the glass to be cleaned and reused. Harry pulled out his wand and little rows of merchandise flew out of the back room and landed on the proper shelf. Within two minutes, the store was back to normal.
Draco lets out a sigh and looks for Harry. His husband is waving furiously whilst talking to Hugo, no doubt reliving the Quidditch match from last night.
Draco’s brain stalled at the choice. He felt safer in the presence of his son, but he and Harry were starting this
“Got you to move.” Harry sounded too smug for Draco’s taste so he leaned down and kissed him, letting his tongue and hips move in tandem.
“That was enough to take a year off of your life,” continued Bellatrix. “Tell me,” she pauses and looks at Harry, cold and detached from Harry's suffering. “How do you feel? And remember, be honest.”
Draco spied one of the young Weasleys heading for the soaps and lotions. She grabbed a bottle, opened it, and put it to her lips.
Draco snorts a little in disbelief. “Fine, Potter.” He makes his way to the sofa and grabs his blanket, pulling it around his shoulders. He glares at Harry. “I don’t have a telly so you’ll have to entertain yourself.”
Harry’s using his most exasperating, insincere voice. He’s routinely used it with reporters and it’s never failed to annoy his audience. Draco doesn’t seem immune and he pulls his hand out of Harry’s and pinches him, hard, on the side.
“So you were at the three events during which my business failed?” Draco half shouted, putting his cup of tea down when his emotional outburst started to make the tea slosh over the edge.
“Both,” Draco said decisively, making Harry laugh again. “But that’s enough about me for our first date. What has the Boy-Who -Lived been up to since Hogwarts?”
The breathing has helped his anxiety and he takes the time to look for clothes that will compliment him instead of what’s nearby.
“That’s a rather dubious honour,” Harry said. “I think you and I have the ability to bring out the best, or the worst in each other.”
Harry laughed and Draco could feel the way it made his entire body move. “Emily said you would hate them,” he admitted.
Holding the door open for Harry, Draco followed him out into the cool evening. Harry held out his arm for Draco and they Apparated away.
“Drinking Draco’s wine and telling him he should get off his arse and get a job.” She smirked and grabbed the bottle of wine from Draco’s hand and topped up her glass.
Harry shrugs. “To be fair, this is the first time we’ve been naked together so it’s not like it’s a trend.”
With a wrench, Voldie pulled Draco back down the aisle. “Get him to the Honeymoon Suite,” he hissed to his father. “I’ll be there shortly.”
They stood in silence for a few moments. Just as Draco was about to storm back to the castle and collect Scorpius, Harry spoke again. “I got your letter.”
But he pulled his wand from its holster and before Draco could blink, he was sending a small stream of water towards the various Weasleys.
Draco leans over to wrap Harry’s arm around his shoulders. His heart breaks a little for the sadness he sees on Harry’s face.
Harry still had hold of Draco’s hand. Draco looked at it, the contrast of Draco’s pale hand in Harry’s golden one was striking. Harry’s cuticles were a mess, of course, but—
Draco’s eyes filled with tears. He looked so beautiful in that moment, ice blond hair glinting in the harsh sunlight, grey eyes sparkling with unshed tears, skin pink from exertion, He had no idea how he was going to get away from Zacharias, and if the man in black bested
She held up a hand, easily silencing Draco’s imminent apology. “Mr Malfoy, there’s nothing to apologise for. Magic can be fickle. Especially magic that’s as delicate as yours. We have contracted your business, how many times?”
Draco had talked to the powers-that-be in the Town Hall and said the name was a rather rude word for sex workers, but they insisted people would only see it as a reference to cricket, as was the founder’s intention. Draco thought they were wrong and had insisted they change the name. They had refused.
Owling Draco Malfoy was something Harry hadn’t ever anticipated doing. However, under the watchful eyes of his best friends, he was now doing that very thing.
Before his son is swept off by his best friend, Draco hugs Scorpius again. “I love you,” he says, too low for anyone but Scorpius to hear.
Hermione walked in with Rose. She took one look at Harry and rolled her eyes. “He’s bringing his son to play,” she said, aggravated
Harry watched as one of the soldiers led Draco to his Abraxan. When they were a safe distance away, Voldie leaned down to Bellatrix. “When we’re clear take him to the Chamber of Secrets.” She nodded as Voldie got on his Abraxan and rode away.
Harry can't understand anymore because as soon as he's touching himself, his brain is once again filled with static. He roughly pulls on his prick, barely noticing when Draco spells lube into Harry's palm. The slide is better and only a minute passes before Harry's coming.
Harry grabs Draco’s arm and starts pulling him towards their bedroom. “Meant what I said about sniffing you all over,” he says. “You always smell so good everywhere.”
Scorpius let out a little laugh. “Don’t worry, Dad,” he said. “I know better than to curse in front of Gran.”
“Ah, well,” Harry winked, “I am both.” They stared at each for a moment before Draco let out a disbelieving giggle and started walking, hoping he was going the right way.
Lily’s shouting has apparently summoned everyone else in the house, because Harry hears the thunder of running feet and Jamie, Al, and Scorpius appear in the doorway.
Harry leans over to nibble at Draco’s collarbone. “I don’t really have any experience with that,” he says to Draco’s skin that’s pink from Harry’s ministrations.
, Draco. But you’re not. I’m not letting you stay here to run yourself ragged all night. Everyone needs you to be in top shape, and that means you have to eat more than what we had at the restaurant and sleep tonight.”
“I’ll only get an awkward boner later,” he reasons to himself, then groans as he grips his cock tightly.
Harry shook his head, making his wild hair somehow even wilder. “Fine.” He scowled and Draco felt a flicker of amusement. They were at
Things are going well. Scorpius is between his first and second year at Hogwarts and while they’re out, they buy the majority of his school supplies he needs for September. Scorpius meets his friends for ice cream, as Draco looks around Flourish and Blotts. He finds and purchases the latest romance/spy novel Pansy had written. Draco does his obligatory grumbling about having to buy his best friend’s novel—at a shop no less!—while Pansy’s portrait laughs at him from the back cover. Draco buys the book anyway.
I must admit, I don’t know if I’m ready for a house full of Weasleys right now. We should see how the smaller gathering goes first.
He wasn’t able to put a fourth finger up before Harry started laughing. “I’ve always—” he said between laughter— “always been on the lookout for a place that welcomes my balls.”
Harry sends a few owls and a box of Draco’s favourite sweets and finally, after receiving no answer, he goes to Draco’s flat.
time we attended Hogwarts?” He casts one last time at the clown and looks incredibly satisfied and continues, “Their greatest hits album came out last year, OK?” Draco narrows his eyes. “How exactly did we get on the subject of mid-90s girl groups?”
“Quit,” he says, moving Harry so their heads are at the top of the bed. “Quit doing weird things with your face while we’re snogging.”
Letting out a groan, Harry moves to kiss Draco, morning breath be damned. Draco deepens the kiss and Harry feels himself start to get hard. He reaches down to grab Draco’s erection and makes sure to rub the damp spot at the tip of his boxers.
“Use the store bought stuff,” Draco says as Harry starts to take his clothes off. “It always feels nicer than the Conjured lube.”
“Do you have your bag?” he asked, slightly sceptical that anything in there would be of interest to Rose Weasley.
Blaise’s eyes got big and his mouth dropped. “I’m sex on a stick!” he insisted. “I’m a sex stick! I—”
“Draco wants to open a store that actually sells things people need. And he wants to find local vendors for as much as possible.” Emily’s eyes glinted as she smiled. “And he wants to call it ‘Draco’s Emporium of Fine Goods’.”
No matter what happens, Harry's happy to have best friends who support him in his romantic adventures. He reckons their closeness is partially because they’ve been best friends for seventeen years, and partially that Ron and Hermione married at nineteen, all of which makes them too invested in each others’ lives. But Harry is happy to have his friends’ support even if a one-night stand once described their relationship as
Walking into his closet, Harry pulls out some black skinny jeans and a dark green Henley for inspection. The trousers are tight but according to Luna make his bum look nice and the shirt is comfortable and soft. Between the two, he shouldn’t feel too uncomfortable. He quickly dresses and grabs his cleanest trainers and walks to the Floo. Casting a quick
Instead of the gasp Harry's expecting from Malfoy, he lets out the same, unattractive, snorting laugh which made Harry realise he's well and truly fucked when it comes to Malfoy. Harry curses the layout of their office at that moment. When Ron and he had taken the space over, they'd decided to put their desks on opposite walls, facing away from each other. It has greatly increased the amount of paperwork they complete, but now, when Harry needs to catch Ron's eye, he'll have to be very obvious about that fact. He settles for looking at Malfoy's knees.
“I was just thinking about how different my weddings were,” Draco admits, settling himself on the sofa.
After an awkward silence, the man in black jumped up. “I’m rested if you’re ready to duel.” He pulled his wand out of his thigh holster. Hermione nodded, pulled out her wand with her left hand, and cast a non-verbal hex which the man in black easily parried.
“So gorgeous like this,” Harry whispers. He leans down and starts to suck more marks into Draco’s skin. “Do you mind keeping one of these after we’re done?” he asks, looking a little embarrassed.
He and David had dated for about a year before breaking it off. Harry'd pulled a few guys at clubs and gone on a few casual dates in the ensuing years, but nothing really took until Malfoy reentered his life, consulting full time with the Auror department. He still sang Muggle pop songs and had soft looking hair that curled at the ends and still wore white shirts that clung to his shoulders, but he'd matured over the ten years since the war had ended. And at some point over the last decade, Harry had fallen arse over tit for the git.
With a sigh Emily leaned over and rested her head on Draco’s shoulder. “I know,” she whispered. “I know.”
Hermione’s reply was cut off as she was lifted up by Ron’s magic, but Harry could see she was thinking about it as she floated towards the ground.
After sending the letter, Draco’s predictions about his mother are proven correct. She is in their flat, talking excitedly with Scorpius about the niffler.
“We could do that,” Draco says gently thrusting against Harry’s ass. “We can do whatever you want, Harry.”
“Draco my love, there is a shortage of people both beautiful and clever. It would be a shame to lose you.”
The eye contact was too intense, Draco had to look down. “I think you’re also very attractive,” he told his peas.
Shaking his head, Ron says, “No, we got an anonymous tip. They said there were some cursed Muggle artefacts that the Aurors might find interesting.”
Draco smiles, a little wryly. “Drinks with Pansy and Blaise,” he answers. “And tomorrow, dinner with my mother.”
Tears prick at Draco’s eyes again as he looks down at the inert object in his hand. It wasn't real. He hadn't gone into the future and seen the happiness that is to come, something he doesn't deserve. He’s going to Azkaban, he’s going to get the Kiss, he’s—
“Harry?” he asks and Harry knows what Draco wants because suddenly they’re pressed against each other, from shoulders to ankles.
Harry spent the next week in meetings and Floo conferences. After Hogwarts, he had taken a few years and lazed around Grimmauld Place, eventually becoming so tired of the rundown atmosphere of the old house that he hired a construction crew to gut it and start from scratch. After
“I’m not going to dignify that with an answer,” Harry says, trying to capture Draco’s mouth again but only succeeding in licking his nose.
He looked around the store. Stella’s forty-seven relatives were milling about, but he also saw a few people from Hogwarts from his and Harry’s year. Hannah Abbott and Neville Longbottom were in the section with the biros and notebooks, talking animatedly. Dean Thomas and Seamus Finnigan were looking at the bath soaks and Terry Boot was picking out apples.
“They used a Levitation Charm to move it. I’m pretty sure the person leaving them is an adult which means that they could just carry the object with no problem.”
Harry smiles and lets himself look at Draco. He’s still a little pink from his emotional outburst, but there’s a definite smile on his face now. Harry smiles back.
“Malfoy,” Potter said, sliding into Draco’s booth, on the same bench. “You know I’m not actually going to tattle on you, right?” His face was oddly serious. “It was just…”
“Malfoy!” Ron exclaimed with glee as he entered the sitting room. “‘Mione and I were telling Harry—”
They finish up their afternoon by grabbing a quick lunch at a charming little cafe and taking a long walk through a nearby park. They’re home by early evening, the sun still bright in the sky and that, of course, is when Scorpius finds their stowaway.
Draco sneered, reminding Harry of their Hogwarts day. “You bought those in a five pack at M&S. I’ll buy you a new set if you’re really that enamoured of them.”
Everything was set up by Friday, the day before the opening, which meant Draco had plenty of time to be anxious.
“The Chamber or Secrets,” the rat-like man said. "I am its caretaker, Wormtail." He looked down at Harry and tightened the straps around his chest. “Don’t even try to escape.”
“These gingers are your in-laws,” Harry’s ex-wife and the mother of his children said, seemingly coming from nowhere.
“It’s been fun,” Harry agreed. “I think Rose is going to want Scorpius to visit as much as he’s able.”
Draco turned around and Potter was only a metre away, his hands still in his pockets, a wry grin on his face. He stuck his hand out rather awkwardly and Draco raised his to shake.
Hermione shook her head. “He saved his small country from a madman, sacrificing himself at the very end. He has a husband and a small child who need his support.”
“No one of consequence,” the man in black replied as he pulled Draco up by the arm and started dragging him away from Zacharias’ body.
Harry spends the rest of the work day in a haze, his brain staticky. He’s thankful that Ron is his partner because Ron is fluent in
“Draco,” Harry said. “This is True Love. Do you think this happens to just anyone? There is nothing that can best it. I
“I want to do this before we have to go face whatever is at the Ministry,” he whispers then leans down to capture Harry’s mouth with his own.
“If you’re worried about the cost, don’t. Molly wants to make the food and the wine will be a write off—”
Harry looked over at Draco for a brief moment, then looked back at the road. “You’ll look good no matter what your hair looks like.” Harry’s voice was soft and, between the wind and the tone of his voice, Draco wasn’t sure he’d heard him correctly.
Bellatrix cackled as Hermione started to slump to the floor, clutching her hip. Her vision was fading and she whispered, “I'm sorry Father. I have failed you.”
Draco is smooshed against him, snoring a little in sleep, and Harry can’t keep back a little snort at how wrong he’d been about prim and posh Draco Malfoy before they’d started dating. The snort must disturb Draco, because he rolls over and mutters, “Whattsit,” and paws at Harry’s chest.
Draco had hidden himself behind Harry and avoided the bulk of the spray, but Harry’s hair was dripping, his fringe in his eyes.
Harry Floos to his flat and seconds later Draco joins him. He lets Draco pick a DVD while he goes to call in their order in his kitchen. When he returns to the lounge he can hear Draco singing while looking at the shelves of movies.
“This was not what I had imagined when I suggested we stay here,” Harry admitted once he was able to speak.
“Someone like you would be good for the community,” she remarked. “Get some new blood, someone with fresh ideas to take over.”
,” he said menacingly. “You and Draco might have been that one lucky couple in an age who really and truly had
Draco let out a gasp. Harry squeezed his hand then pulled it to his mouth to lay a soft kiss on Draco’s knuckles. “It’s fine, love. I learned how to duel and fight from his men and I was always treated well. Even if, every night, Black said he might kill me the next morning. A year went by like this until the routine of it gave me no fear. By then I had become Black’s right hand man and he finally confided in me. He told me that he was not the
Stepping away from Harry, Bellatrix closed her eyes and took a deep breath. On the exhale she whispered
Harry looked to Ron who was beaming at his mum. “I’m not dating Malfoy just because you all like him,” he grumbled.
With a smile so big it shows off the tooth she’s missing, Lily runs out to her brother, shouting, “Who is the owl from?”
. Harry had promptly ripped up his Floo address and asked his Mind Healer about the issue. Flora had said that as long as Harry didn’t run every decision by his friends then they were probably fine. Hermione'd called it a load of tosh and Ron had laughed until he cried. Which was all to say that his friends were his family and wanted him to be happy and if they could help with the matter, well then they would.
“I was thinking we need to have some sort of food and we can write off a case or two of fruit wine and—”
Throwing caution to the wind, Harry leans forward and pulls Draco into a hug. Draco must want the physical contact as much as Harry, because he melts into Harry’s arms.
, and the start of Ginny’s time with the Potter children. She'd also graciously extended an invitation to Scorpius.
The man in black looked up in surprise. “I’m climbing up a straight cliff!” he spat out. “I would like to see you do any better!” He made his way up another metre before stopping. “If you’re in that much of a hurry, you could lower a rope or a branch or something.”
Harry lay there with a defiant look on his face, completely at odds with the blush that was staining his cheeks and ears.
Harry rushes through his morning routine, doing the least possible amount of work before Flooing to the Ministry. He rushes to his office and almost runs into Ron.
There’s no heat in the kiss. They’re both too tired and anxious. But it feels different from the few kisses they'd exchanged at the restaurant. Maybe it’s the fact that Draco’s sleep-mussed and soft, maybe it’s that Harry’s heart feels like it’s going to break if Draco goes home, alone, to be sad, but this kiss feels like coming home. Draco feels right in a way Harry’s never felt before. The kiss reminds Harry of lazy Sunday mornings with his friends, laughter in the slanting sunshine. It feels like everything Harry feels when he thinks of
Draco finally relents, pounced on their feet, meowed at them, crawled all over them both, and most insultingly, he put his arse directly into Draco’s face so that his little arsehole was on display.
Draco nodded. “Yeah, apparently she’s secretly rich. Only a few people know, so don’t gossip. She doesn’t want to be treated any differently. But the old owners wanted to retire so instead of letting it be sold to a stranger, she bought it herself.”
“Dad,” he says. “There’s a niffler in my bag.” His face is set in its most serious expression, his blond brows furrowed, his bright blue eyes—so much like Astoria’s—serious. “We need to feed it, get it some water, make sure its—”
The shelves were all built and stocked. Harry had hired a magical contractor to build some new shelving since they wanted to open as soon as their paperwork was finalised. The flooring had been polished until it shone, the old fixtures and shelving had been cleaned and repainted. Draco had picked out three cases of wine to serve in stemless glasses, charmed to be unbreakable, of course, and Harry swore Molly Weasley would make some sweet and savoury treats for the customers to nibble on.
“I can’t believe we work so well as flatmates,” Harry admitted. “If you had told me ten years ago that we would end up—” he motioned to them both, comfortable in each other’s company— “like this, I would have hexed you and called you a liar.”
Frozen in shock at his daring, Draco’s breath was stolen from him as the Dread Pirate Roberts shouted, “As you wish!” as he rolled down the hill.
“I really do want to help,” Hermione said. “It’s a brill idea, controlling the weather, even in a limited capacity.” She motioned Draco closer and he nodded and walked over to her. “I think Harry might be a little embarrassed that he's the reason it’s been raining at your events. So if he runs away from you all evening, don’t take it personally.”
“Well, I’m going to kill myself tonight, and you’ve always been kind. So I just wanted to say goodbye.”
It was too intense, Draco had to look away. “I’m glad of all of those things too,” he said. “You know, before you crashed back into my life, I told everyone no. Emily wanted me to open the store, Mother wanted me to go back into the Wizarding world and try and find an apprenticeship. Hell, Stella just wanted me to spend time with her.”
“You can do this, Potter,” he says to himself before following Hermione into the dining room. “You can look him in the eye.”
In his pyjamas and bed, an hour later, Draco started thinking about what Potter had told him before he had fucked off.
She started to grab things around the room, a fire bellows, her wand, some goggles, and a pair of gloves. “You’re lucky you found me,” she said as she walked back over to the table. “You don’t even know the difference between all the way dead and mostly dead,” she grumbled. She looked appraisingly at Ron and Hermione. Making up her mind, she nodded to Ron. “You,” she pointed at the man in black, “hold his mouth open.” While he was following her orders, she put her gloves and goggles on and used her wand to lift the bellows. She levitated it over and it settled gently into Harry’s mouth. With another flick of her wrist, it inflated and blew a gust of air into him.
“You don’t look happy, my dear,” Voldie murmured as he tucked a loose strand of hair back into the intricate braids in Draco’s hair.
“But you also have some sort of charm on your clothes and you may be counting on the fact that you have an antidote or bezoar hidden on your person and know you can reach it in time, which means I cannot drink the wine in front of you!” Zacharias shouted. “But we also know that bezoars aren’t effective with all poisons and if this is a new version of Weedosoros there may not be an antidote so I cannot drink the wine in front of me.”
“I asked if you would mind staying over tonight.” Draco looks up and glares, seemingly upset at his show of vulnerability. “If it’s not too much trouble.”
“You don’t need an audience, Mr Potter,” Mrs Malfoy says. She seems to have followed the kids into the lounge and is staring at Harry.
Turning to retreat back into his corner, Draco wrung his hands. He hadn't meant to be so open about his fears. He felt his face heat as he walked and looked for something to do that wouldn’t make him feel like he was exposing himself to his childhood nemesis.
He pulled Draco up to sitting and looked at him. They were still holding hands and Harry’s hand was warm and soft in Draco’s.
Scorpius' prediction turned out to be true. A month went by with no incident, though Draco had checked things four times before each event, and Draco started to relax. A little. The second month after the
Draco grabs the box and puts it on the coffee table, not bothering to grab plates or cutlery.  Harry follows him to the sofa and they both sit. Draco grabs a slice and moans at the first bite, clearly hungry. They’re both quiet as they eat and suddenly the box is empty.
Draco looks up at his boyfriend, who is clearly torn between seeing what one of his best friends wants and Draco’s trauma.
Harry didn’t answer, but he did pull Draco back into an incredibly filthy kiss, all teeth and tongue and wandering hands. While they kissed, they worked on getting Draco out of his pyjama bottoms and Harry out of his ratty flannel joggers. Then they were both left only in their pants.
"I'm almost ashamed to admit this is doing wonderful things for my ego," he says and he starts fucking Harry on his fingers in earnest.
“I must admit,” Ron said as he followed the man in black, “I don’t have as much experience fighting only one person. I usually take on whole groups.” He groaned as his next attempt at hitting the man in black failed.
Draco had been kidnapped by no less than four people, all in the space of twenty-for hours. He was rather sick of it.
“Hermione,” Ron bellowed, seemingly not caring that his son was eating wild plants. “Harry said he thinks Malfoy’s fit!”
wedding!” He rolled his eyes, shrugged, then grinned. “If I play my cards right, I may be able to dine out on this for
Seamus meets them at the Ministry with his partner, Alicia Spinnet. Seamus offers a half-hearted smile but there’s a frown on Alicia’s face.
Then, giving Harry a smug smile, something that Harry hadn’t dared to hope for, he declares, “And I want a curry.”
Groaning, Ron picked Hugo up again and lifted him up , making the boy laugh, high and musical. “Your Uncle Harry needs to let go of his obsession with the pointy git,” he said then lowered Hugo so he could kiss his belly. “Harry, Malfoy’s not ‘up to something’ anymore,” he said over Hugo’s giggles. “Auntie Luna swears he’s given up his juvenile delinquent act.”
Their food comes and Draco lets out a little laugh. “Weasley was right,” he says. “The meatballs are as big as your fist.”
Humming, Hermione lifted a shoulder. “I don’t know,” she admitted. “I’ve spent so long with this one goal, I honestly don’t know.”
“I WOULD NOT SAY SUCH THINGS IF I WERE YOU!” screamed Voldie and he threw Draco into his room and locked the door.
Ron gave him a weird look. Then he pulled out a silky, multicoloured cloak from under his jacket. “Like this?”
Well, Draco thinks, she was a bit sleazy in her offer, but she’s still allowing Scorpius to spend a couple of nights away, giving Draco and Harry some time alone.
Zacharias laughed, an ugly, snorting laugh. “Oh, your prince will come for you. But you’ll be too dead to know.”
Draco followed Harry to the sofa and when he sat down, Draco did too. It was surprisingly soft and a nice, soothing grey colour.
“I’m sure.” Draco ignored the scenery and shop fronts to look at Harry while they walked. “I’m glad they became friends. Scorpius only has Muggle friends. They’re wonderful but they won’t ever understand a big part of his life.”
“Are you Apparating back to London?” Draco asked, walking towards his flat, still not looking at Potter.
was. He would be the first to admit that he had a little pash on Draco, he’d had it for almost as long as they had lived together. But Draco had never seemed to return the sentiment.
A few months later, an unfamiliar owl arrived. It was carrying a letter and Draco hoped it was a message from Harry. The outside was blank, not giving him any clue to what was inside. Draco fed the owl a few treats and muttered, "You can rest in the barn with the other owls." It gave him a hoot and flew off. Draco, hoping to finally know how Harry was, tore the later open, only to let out a wail. His greatest fear had come true.
Harry can’t keep back his chuckle. He remembers how Ginny is when she’s ‘taking care of someone,’ and he mentally wishes Pansy good luck.
“Because our flat has been taken over by Ron, Hermione, Rose, and Hugo while their cottage is being renovated,” Harry reminded him.  “And Grimmauld isn’t safe for kids.”
Annoyed, Draco shuts him up again by shoving his tongue back into Harry's mouth. Pulling back for a brief moment, he asks, “Why do you have to be so annoying all the bloody time?”
Harry barked out a laugh. “It’s fine,” he said walking to where Draco was pacing in front of the shop counter. “Molly has a charm that will keep the plates of food full and if we run out of wine, well, we don’t really want drunk customers. As far as the discount goes, that was your idea so I don’t know what to tell you.”
“It was,” Mrs Weasley said. “There were a lot of people.” She walked up to Draco’s mum and they started talking, low and happy.
“I’m not arguing that with you.” Emily glared at Draco. “Should we talk about your lack of a sex life now?”
“When’s the last time you ate?” Harry demands, apparently not able to control his brain-to-mouth filter.
With an answering laugh, Hermione turns to look. “I’m glad you two stayed friends,” she says when she turns back to Harry.
“No!” Draco shouted. “Emily and I are both gay! We have no desire to do any of that.” Draco felt his lip curl in disgust. “Emily’s my best friend,” he said in a voice that was a lot quieter. “She saved me after we got to the Hamlet.”
Scorpius isn’t listening because his head is already firmly stuck in the Floo, talking to his Gran about the niffler.
Draco burst into laughter. Harry watched as he laughed and admitted to himself that had he seen Draco laugh like that when they’d first met, they might have had a different relationship at Hogwarts. Finally he stopped and made an exaggerated display of wiping his eyes.
Harry’s voice pulled Draco back to himself. “Sorry,” he said. “It’s just, you always dated women and now you’re naked in my bed.”
His mother and the niffler haven’t moved, but she has peeled an orange and is feeding the niffler slices and smiling.
Draco clears his throat and looks pointedly away from Harry. “Where is this leading, Harry?” he asks quietly. “Are we working on being
Harry pulled out his wand. “I'm armed as well,” he said as he got into dueling position. “I will happily fight you—”
He scrabbles for his wand and casts, grimacing at the stretch and dual tingle of a cleaning and protection charm.
“Then welcome to our house,” Hermione said. “Would you like something to drink? Tea? Water? Some wine?”
"You were expecting me, then?" Harry can hear the smile in Malfoy's voice. Which is nice because now Harry's studying the ankle boots Malfoy's wearing.
“Muggle’s probably fine,” Ron continues, ignoring Harry’s outburst. “There’s this tiny, hole-in-the-wall Italian place ‘Mione found, Pasta Was a Rolling Stone. It looks like it's right out of a rom-com, but it’s got the best red sauce I’ve ever had. And meatballs as big as your fist.”
“You tried it on and everybody ogled,” Ron reiterates. “I thought Charlie’s eyes were gonna pop out of his head.
“He’s such a—” Draco couldn’t think of a word strong enough to express his frustration so he just waved his arms. Emphatically. “What are you doing, scheming with him?” he half-shouted.
“I don’t understand why that keeps happening,” Hermione said with a little frown. “I’ve been keeping up with his business and I’ve only heard good things. Molly’s not the only one who met with Minerva. She says he’s changed a lot since our school days.”
“Ron and ‘Mione’s is a safe place,” he whispers to himself. “Malfoy isn’t a racist arsehole anymore.” He takes another deep breath. “You’re a catch, Witch Weekly’s Best Smile Winner for the last decade,” he tells himself with a wry grin.
believe he’s having a candlelit dinner with Draco Malfoy and neither of them are trying to maim the other.
Harry’s laughter fills the hall as he walks away to grab their dessert, and Draco reckons it’s been a pretty perfect anniversary.
Voldie looked down at his guards and nodded. They opened the heavy door where Draco was waiting and Draco walked out, his heart sore and what he hoped was a mild expression on his face. He had warned the prince that theirs would never be a love match, but Prince Voldie had assured Draco his parents’ union had started similarly and they had grown to love each other.
“Sure,” Draco agrees, distracted. “I’ll need to get these back to my lab to see if I can get anymore information about who would be leaving these things.”
It burns a little; they don’t often have time for penetrative sex, but Draco knows Harry will make it worth his while. Harry rubs Draco’s lower back with his free hand.
Voldie rolled his eyes. “Next I suppose you’ll remove my tongue. How original.” He twitched his wand and aimed it at Harry.
Potter had a soft look on his face that Draco usually associated with Granger or Weasley. “I’ll be on my best behaviour,” he said.
it went, spoon against stoneware over and over, until Draco was forced to look up and glare at Potter.
“Fuck!” he shouts, running to his entryway to look for his cleanest pair of trainers. Which... Harry decides he may need to get better shoes if there's the possibility of future dates.
Things at work settle down after that. Harry and Ron take down an illegal potions smuggling ring and Draco takes Harry out to dinner to celebrate. After walking Draco back up to his flat, Harry gently pushes Draco against his door and kisses him until they’re both breathless. Then Harry asks him out on another date.
Draco suddenly didn’t care about the most muscular Weasley, or the fact that his best friend was apparently dating Harry’s ex-wife, or that he was in a room full of gingers and his son. He wanted to kiss Harry too badly. He pulled Harry back into his corner until Draco was flush against the wall and wound his arms around Harry’s middle, nipping at his lower lip. Draco kissed Harry once, twice, three times, before licking at the seam of his mouth, trying to get in.
“Probably still you.” Harry smirked and looked down at the table. “Do you have any suggestions on what to order now that we’ve got our drinks?” A slight shudder overtook him. “But not the mozzarella sticks, those were terrible. The next day I felt worse than I do when I drink too much.”
With a soppy smile, Harry pulls him into another kiss. Draco angles him towards the bed and gently pushes Harry toward it, only stopping when Harry’s knees have hit their mattress. He sits, and Draco leans down to kiss him again.
Draco rolled his eyes and made himself comfortable on his bed. If he was going to talk about the last year, he wanted to be on something a bit more plush than the hard wooden chairs.
He hobbles in and takes in the sight of bodies strewn on every surface in various states of distress. Backing up, yet again fleeing his situation, he bumps into a side table and hears something fall. Something shiny catches his eye and he leans down to pick it up. Draco’s breath catches when he realises it’s a Time-Turner.
Opening the letter, Harry lets out a sigh of relief. “Draco Malfoy and his son found Peanut Butter,” he tells his children.
at the Venomous Tentacula behind Draco. The plant ceased its thrashing and stayed still, the loss of one of its vines subduing it for the time being.
“Crups are cool!” Scorpius says with a squeak. “Here,” he says to Lily, gently handing over Peanut Butter. The boys run off to Al’s room, chatting about what they would name a Crup if they owned one. Mrs Malfoy smiles at Lily and asks her about the origin of Peanut Butter’s name. Jamie is nowhere to be seen, having presumably escaped to his room.
Harry finishes first. Draco hadn’t counted on that, but he’s always gotten really worked up by teasing Draco, so he’s not completely surprised. But one second he’s tugging at Draco’s prick, and the next his hand and face have gone slack and he’s mindlessly thrusting into Draco making little ‘ah, ah’ sounds. Harry lets out a rush of air and thrusts into Draco once, twice, thrice, before he stops and leans down to kiss Draco again.
“OK, ‘Mione,” Harry said. He went over and gave her a hug then pulled Ron into one as well. “I’ll talk to you both later and I’ll be here Saturday before Draco gets here so we can talk strategy.”
Voldie scowled at Draco and Harry, still entwined on the bed. “It’s no matter,” he said dismissively. “It’s easily remedied. But first,” he drew his wand with an unnecessary flourish, “
Draco had to admit that was a good point. He waved his wand at himself and his clothes disappeared to his closet. At that moment he realised two things: one, his Mark was exposed and two, Harry could see his scars from sixth year. He cast again and he was fully dressed.
“Oh, I’m freelance,” Harry said casually. “I pick up the jobs I want, when I want. I only have clearance for the jobs I’m working on.”
He gestured towards the fireplace and watched as Scorpius grabbed a handful of Floo powder then listened closely as his son, very clearly and precisely, shouted the correct address. Scorpius had only been Flooing alone for a few months, so he was still anxious about having them end up at separate places. But so far, his fears had all been unfounded. Draco grabbed his own handful of powder and braced himself for the journey.
Turning to Ginny he says, “We’re all aware of my past-transgressions, girl-Weasley, and if you’re interested in my best friend and want my approval, I would suggest you keep a civil tongue.”
Harry didn’t answer, instead, he pulled Draco close and kissed him gently. He must have lost his mask on the way down the hill because Draco was able to look at his beautiful face. “Can you walk?” Harry asked, concerned.
“Hello, Mr Potter,” the woman from the restaurant said. “Welcome to the Mayfair Chippy. I’m Mary and if you’ll follow me, I’ll show you to your table.”
Harry looks up to glare at Ron, flipping him two fingers at the shiteating grin he’s got on his face.
Sparing one last look at the boat in the distance, Zacharias let out a snort. “Even if the person in the boat makes it to the cliff, there is no way he’ll be able to get to the top. Only my giant is strong enough to go up this way. He will have to circle around to find a safe harbour.” While he was talking, Ron had slung the harness around his waist and Hermione was struggling to get into hers. Zacharias pushed Draco towards Ronald and started to put a harness around him.
Draco’s prick is throbbing by the time Harry moves from his left to his right, and Draco can only roll his hips, searching for friction. He feels Harry's huff of laughter against his skin, but he ignores it in favour of moving his legs up around Harry until their hips are pressed together.
Voldie gave her a disdainful look. “I always plan for a trap,” he drawled. “It’s how I’m still alive.” He climbed back onto his horse and led everyone away from the cliff’s edge, towards the green fields, towards Surrey.
“Are you squeezing me on purpose?” Draco asked, snapping his hips a little harder, feeling Harry squeeze again.
Instead of answering, Harry smiles and replies, “I love you so much, Draco,” and Draco melts a little.
Harry nodded and Hermione threw the invisibility cloak over Ron, making him completely disappear and Hermione started a cold, blue flame in the space Ron had just occupied. Ron cast his voice to the flame. “The Dread Pirate Black is here for your
“All of the Weasleys are competent, ” she had said. Then she’d taken another deep drink from her glass of wine and looked Harry right in the eye. “Malfoy—”
Ron rolls his chair and passes Harry the notes from the crime scene, while Harry sips his tea and reads. Harry’s just about to the end of the document when Ron asks, “So, what happened after you left?”
Professor McGonagall had asked him to come to consult with the staff about the feasibility of starting an LGBTQ+ club. Coincidentally, the house elves had planned a big picnic on the grounds after his meeting. Something about a ‘back to school event’ since the fall term had started only a week prior. Everything had been sunny and clear when Harry had first arrived. From the staff room, Harry had watched some big fluffy clouds pass by and he’d been looking forward to spending the afternoon outside. But as soon he was a few metres past the entrance, the sky had turned dark and then he and most of the students and staff of Hogwarts were soaked.
Draco shrugged and went back to sending various bottles of lotion and bars of soap to the area he had designated as the shelf for self-care items. He smiled when things were all in a row, the glass bottles gleaming. Harry had insisted on sustainable packaging as much as they were able and Draco had carefully Transfigured all of the plastic into glass. Each bottle had an embossed seal with ‘Malfoy’s Menagerie’ and a stylised dragon circling the name. Apparently Ronald Weasley had designed it.
Stella looked back and forth between Emily and Draco. “What?” she asked after they’d sat in silence for nearly a minute.
She crawled into the bed and Draco followed. “I still think it’s a good idea,” she murmured, already half asleep.
“Wonderful,” Draco says with a sigh. “We’re going to Godric’s Hollow,” he tells Scorpius and his mother. “Apparition it is.”
“Didn’t realise you could smile so big while you kissed me,” Harry murmurs, and Draco lets out a little laugh.
Deciding he was too drunk to talk to anyone, Draco pulled out his wand and subtly cast a few protection spells on his mobile and kicked it into the shrubbery that was by the entrance.
“Just add it to all of my other crimes,” Draco said with a sigh. “Haul me off to Azkaban, oh Saviour. Lock me up with the criminals and let me rot.”
Draco smiled, a true smile at that. “I honestly feel like Luna’s one of the main reasons it’s been successful.”
Draco feels his cheeks heat. “You just—” he gestures to the table. “I didn’t expect to see flowers on your table.”
that might give them an idea of where the man in black might be hidden. She let out a sigh that sounded like a sob. “Father,” she whispered. “I have failed you. I have lived my life to avenge you and now that I’ve gotten so close, I cannot finish my task. Not alone. Somewhere, close, is the man who can help me exact vengeance on your murderer but I need your help.” She closed her eyes and dropped to her knees, unholstering her wand. “Please Father,” she murmured. “Please, help.”
"That can be arranged," Draco drawls and Harry wants to fuck him until he's as crazed as Harry is so he pushes Draco down and climbs on top.
“He’s naming the store after me,” Draco whined after he had finished chewing his food and putting the bag on the floor. Then he flipped two fingers at Emily for the hamster comment. “We’re going to go bankrupt before we even open.”
asking Gran.” Draco rolls his eyes and walks into the kitchen to pour himself a glass of wine. If his mother comes over, they will definitely end up keeping the niffler. And nothing in Draco’s life has prepared him for keeping a wild animal.
“I don’t know about pasta, Lils,” Harry says, making her frown. Al sticks out his tongue at her. “Oi!” Harry says. “Be civil.”
Zacharias cackled. “You think you’re so smart,” he spat, “but clearly you know nothing of me. All I have to do is determine what sort of man you are. Are you so confident in your own cleverness that you put the poison in front of yourself or do you really think I’m such a dullard that I would drink my own wine?”
She beamed at them. “It looks like a storm came through,” she said, taking in the store. “It must have been a successful opening.”
“One, we all want you and Ginny to be happy, so I’m glad you’re both so supportive of each other. And two, did you just sniff my hair?”
Harry’s been to Draco’s office before, of course he has. Draco works directly with the Auror Department and Harry has consulted with him on several occasions. But he’s still taken aback by how
Draco nods and pulls open a drawer, pulling out a sheet of parchment and a quill. “I’ll need to send my findings to Records to see if they have a match.”
With some gentle poking and prodding, Draco pulls Harry to himself. “You’re fine,” he says. His shoulders are shaking a little and Harry has a feeling it’s from trying not to laugh.
Rolling off Harry, Draco starts to pull his trousers off. “You’re far too drunk to fuck,” Draco says once he’s down to his pants. “Can you even get hard?”
While Ron and the man in black were brawling, Prince Voldie and the Countess Bellatrix, along with a couple of lackeys, were tracking the villains who had taken Draco. They had ridden Abraxans whose wings allowed them to fly to the top of the cliffs. Voldie jumped off his mount and looked at the footprints in the sand.
case," Ron had waggled his eyebrows, "of Harry's missing heart") and Malfoy works a few cases with other Auror teams. Harry's had several interesting dreams about thin blond men who sing off-pitch pop songs, which have turned into early morning wank sessions. The separation and wanking both mean when Harry
Draco heard Stella rummaging through Emily’s cupboards. “I only found two plates and a pasta bowl,” she shouted back.
Kreacher waved his spindly arms and Draco’s room was suddenly warm and cozy. Without a backwards glance, Kreacher Disapparated.
“I’m just saying you’ve got to name it something better than ‘Draco’s Emporium of Fine Goods’,” she said.
There are huge windows by the sink and oven. It’s early evening, but the sun is still bright enough that golden rays stream through and illuminate the space. It’s homey and welcoming in a way Draco’s never been able to capture for himself.
One of the tears Draco has been resolutely refusing to set free slides down his cheek. And just like that, Draco’s calm breaks. He buries his face in his hands and lets out all of the anger, the grief, the terror of the last year and sobs in a small bed in the hospital wing of Hogwarts as his forty-year-old self watches.
house is nothing like Draco expects. For one thing, it's clean and organised. Draco really hasn't ever spent time wondering about the state of Harry’s kitchen, but he’s pleasantly surprised to see rows of neat shelves with bins of dry ingredients, pastas, and oils. From what Draco can see, there’s a whole shelf dedicated to Muggle cook books. And the scrub top farm table is gleaming, a big vase of flowers in the centre.
“I don’t want to date Malfoy,” Ron said sarcastically. “But you’ll invite him to ours without even a ‘hey mate, can I invite my nemesis to play with your first-born?’”
“This is so much better than last year!” Scorpius says, almost vibrating out of his skin in his excitement.
“Nah,” Harry responds with a smirk. “There’s something about you that makes me want to be annoying.”
Draco can feel Harry’s laughter and he curses his husband in his head. But Harry follows through, and Draco’s suddenly glad he suggested three fingers.
“You’re such a brat,” Harry says and pulls Draco so their fronts are touching and kisses him under the fall of the water. He nips at Draco’s lower lip and swallows his groan as Draco reaches around to grab Harry’s arse and
Draco sighs. “I suppose. It’s just that the last twenty-four hours have been a whirlwind of activity and feelings and now it’s over.”
“She means you,” Ginny says, smirking. “But Draco has certainly been a terror during his life-time.”
Harry searches Draco’s face for a moment. “If it’s too much, you have to tell me. I want this to be fun for us both, love.”
“It’s outside but I thought we could just cast a Warming Charm and it would be fine,” Harry explained under his breath.
Still smiling, the king patted Draco’s arm again. “Lovely to hear,” he said. They were at the entrance to the Honeymoon Suite so the king opened the door for Draco. “Have a wonderful night,” he said. As he turned, Draco heard him say, “He kissed me!” in wonderment.
pop songs. Another thing that Malfoy had started doing was wearing Muggle clothes under his robes; loose jeans and
And suddenly the flinching made sense. There were two large wet spots on the back of Harry’s jumper and Ron and the twins had their wands out. As Draco was getting his wand out to dry Harry’s shirt, he was suddenly hit by several streams of water.
Draco cut him off with a kiss. “I love it, Harry,” he said. Then he kissed Harry again. And again. “It’s the most thoughtful thing anyone has ever done for me.”
“They have a soup and sandwich deal that’s actually not bad. You get a cup of soup and a half sandwich.”
As the door opened, Draco sat up in his bed and fluffed his pillow to use as a seatback. He could smell the tea Emily brought. It smelled suspiciously like what was served at the Blue Moon. But the greasy bag in her hand could only be cheese danishes and those were surprisingly good and always welcome.
Harry can completely see through the bored facade because he nibbles on Draco’s inner thigh and Draco lets out a little
“This and that,” he answered. “Cleaned up Grimmauld Place, helped Ron and Hermione out a bit. Mostly I volunteer now.”
“C’mon,” Ron said, extending his arms so Rose could curl up with him. She climbed in his lap and snuggled up with him. “You are the
“Harry is — he’s this unstoppable force of nature,” he says. “He’s kind and generous, and he has a bigger heart than anyone else you will ever meet. He leaves his socks all over our flat, and when he cooks, he makes a mess that’s disproportionate to the effort, but he smiles when you compliment his food and you’ll fall more in love with him every time.”
Malfoy looks at the small watch on his wrist and frowns. "I'm actually going to be late for a staff meeting if I don't go now. Please let me know about anything you run across that could be Bellatrix's."
“How exactly did we get to me and Malfoy riding off into the sunset?” Harry asked, biting back a laugh.
“It hardly seems fair,” said the man in black as he rushed up to Ron and started pummeling him, “you have such an advantage over me, what with your large size.”
he can go back far enough, he can force himself to make the right choices— to save his parents, to flee with them before the Dark Lord regains his power and influence. Faster and faster, Draco turns the device until the scenes are shifting so rapidly his head is starting to ache.
Harry hands him a tumbler of amber liquid and ice, and Draco takes a sip, savouring the slight burn.
Swimming as fast as he could, Draco tried to get as much distance between himself and the ship. However the water was cold and he was in his flying robes which were voluminous and threatened to pull him under. The sad band of criminals peered at him from the side of the boat. They were gesticulating wildly, but Draco could only hear snatches of their conversation.
The man in black shot off several hexes and crowded her into a corner. “I’ve never dueled anyone as good as you.” He waited until Hermione had nowhere to turn, but catching her expression frowned.“You’re backed in a corner,” he said. “Why are you smiling?”
Draco flicked his wand and a shrunken box flew at him. “I dismantled it,” he said. “We need to drum up interest in the store. We have to let our future customers have some idea that there’s something new coming.”
“Gorgeous,” he murmurs, stepping back into Draco’s space and pressing their now bare chests together.
of a full-grown man was far superior to those of an eight-year-old. Within minutes, Harry had helped Draco gather the rest of his thing and stow them in his work trunks. Harry caught Draco’s eye and smiled at him.
Luna put her hands on her hips, arms akimbo. “Well, fine, but if you lie about True Love, I may not be your wife much longer!”
“After years with a Mind Healer,” other Draco interjects. “But Harry’s not wrong. Go to Luna,” he says again. “She’s more forgiving than you can imagine.”
Draco nods and leans down to kiss Harry’s forehead. “An hour,” he acknowledges before turning and walking out of Harry’s bedroom.
“You can learn more while we eat,” Harry says, bustling forward and grabbing Draco. “You know the Floo address. I’ll call in some takeaway and we can eat and watch some telly if you want, or we can enjoy the quiet.”
They walked into the restaurant and Draco looked around. The black and white checkerboard floor was a little intense but the framed prints of multi-coloured fish on the accent wall were funny. Patrons were seated at a bar area and in a couple of booths with well worn looking wooden seating. There were no empty chairs to be seen. The sounds of forks hitting plates and laughter filled Draco’s ears and the sharp smell of vinegar assaulted his nose. Under that, he could smell the fish and chips and it smelled
Draco rolled over so he could see Harry’s face more clearly. "You're telling me that Harry Potter, Saviour of the Wizarding World, got pegged in a Muggle sex club?"
Emily moved so she was sitting next to Draco, leaning against his pillow. Draco, deciding not to risk spilling his tea everywhere, leaned over to set his cup on the bedside table. When he was done, Emily laid her head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Thank you,” Harry said, feeling rude at interrupting, but thankful Hermione was willing to drop the subject.
"Still went rather well," Ron responds. "I'll make mains and you can make dessert? Win him over with your tarts."
Draco fell into a chair at his table, feeling his heart break and losing himself in sobs. He swore to himself that he would never love again.
Hermione drew her wand so fast Ron goggled a bit. “You’re faster than I remember,” he whispered. Then, even more quietly, “Also you’re really pretty.”
After their soup and bacon sandwiches, Harry suggested stopping by the store. He said it was to ‘restock and clean’, but Draco hoped it was just an excuse to spend more time together. They walked the little bit of distance between the cafe and Malfoy’s Menagerie and were so close, Draco could feel the heat coming from Harry’s body.
Throwing back his head, Harry laughs, and Draco feels a small sense of pride at the volume of the laughter. When he’s recovered, he asks, “Is your home covered in green and silver and snakes?”
“We can both sniff each other!” Harry declares and pulls his jumper over his head, tossing it into the corner where he thinks the hamper is.
. He thought now-Draco was a good father and well fit and while it was a surprise to be confronted with these feelings, Harry hadn’t gone through years of therapy with a highly regarded Mind Healer to deny himself something that might have a positive outcome.
“You remember how we always hated Harry?” At Draco’s nod, other Draco continues. “Well, it turns out that the hatred was more-or-less the armour we built around our heart after he rejected us when we were First Years. But then there’s everything else, the war,
Obviously not expecting that, Draco turned red again. “Oh,” he said. “Yes, that…” He took a deep breath. “I would like that.” Shaking his head, he added, “I always wanted to be Harry Potter’s friend.”
The next time Harry sees Malfoy, he’s confident he’ll be able to speak like a normal person. He’s seen Flora in the interim. He had confessed to her that usually, he doesn’t have a hard time talking to hot guys, that he can mostly look them in the eyes even, but for some reason, Draco Malfoy proves to be the exception. She'd given him a few exercises to help calm his anxiety and Harry was cautiously optimistic.
After dropping Harry, Draco had moved to his side and they were cuddled together on the bed. “I’m so sorry,” Draco whispered into Harry’s neck.
When he’s full seated, they both pause and catch their breath. Draco’s gone a bit soft from the stretch and moving around, but blood starts to fill his cock as Harry leans down to kiss him, his stomach brushing Draco’s erection.
“Um, Luna, is it something you bought at the shop or is it your own blend?” Harry’s sure to ask because he has sampled her custom brews in the past and had gotten spectacularly high. The experience was fun, but not when he’s about to go on a date with Draco Malfoy.
So naturally, after their Eighth Year had started, Malfoy had been remarkably more withdrawn and Harry'd still felt that flicker of attraction and then pity for the other boy. After winter hols, Draco had started coming out of his shell more. He'd personally apologised to all the students in their year for being such an arsehole.
Draco got caught up in the story of the teens who found some conspiracy theory guy and they got stuck in some sort of pod on its way to China. And there was the really fit guy who believed that the middle of the Earth was some sort of paradise. And the giant robot that looked like Godzilla. Then the scientists, and possibly the teens—Draco had no idea—all got into ships to take the large monkey down to the centre of the Earth.
“Arachnids of Unusual Sizes?” Harry raised his eyebrows and smiled reassuringly. “I don’t think they exist.” He motioned for Draco to continue on their path, but then, as if it had appeared from thin air, an Acromantula attacked Harry, sending him to the ground.
Draco unlocked the door with his antique key and discreetly disarmed the wards. Harry followed him into the store. They shut the door and stood by it, shoulder to shoulder, looking at the mess from the day before. Harry shrugged off his blazer and hung it on the coat stand that was by the door.
noodles and meatballs. He starts idly playing with a piece of calamari, picking the breading off until he’s left with a ring of squid which turns out to be incredibly gross.
“He—” Harry gasped, then laughed some more. “Why did you let Charlie Weasley give you a drink?” he asked when he had finally calmed down.
“You’re saying you’ll put down the rock in your hand, we’ll both lay down our wands, and just fight hand to hand, as god intended,
Draco grabs his hand as they wait on their server to bring Harry’s card back. He gives them both a little smile and hands Harry the receipt and card.
Draco catches Harry’s eye and smirks. “So the whole talking to me and looking at my face is a new development, Potter.”
Draco knew she’d had an almost decades-long crush on Stella, going back to their school days, but had never done anything about it. Stella had an annoying habit of dating men who, at first glance, looked like crusty jugglers. In fact, one of them had actually been a juggler and he was, ironically, the cleanest of them all.
Kissing Harry while they were both undressed was a lot different than kissing while fully dressed. For one, they created a lot more heat.
He lets out a little snort of laughter, the furthest thing from refined and posh and all those other things Malfoy's supposed to be, and
Harry searches Draco’s face, notices the purple almost-bruises under his eyes; the grey cast to his pale skin; the oily build-up in his hair; the hesitant way he’s holding himself.
“Harry Potter,” Draco said. He waved to the other people— he didn’t really remember who they all were— and walked up to his mother.
looked at Hermione. She seemed to realise who Hermione was and an evil smile crossed her face. “Ah,” she drawled. “You must be that London brat who was such a bother all those years ago. How long have you spent searching for me?” She paused to
Harry lets out a sigh, and Draco watches appreciatively as he gets out of bed and pads towards the door.
They both turned when they heard someone clearing their throat. It was McGonnagall and Draco felt his cheeks flush.
Draco was raised on a farm in the small country of Wiltshire; his favourite pastimes were flying his broom and tormenting the hired farm boy. Though his name was Harry, Draco never called him that. On Harry's forehead there was a scar shaped like a lightning bolt, so Draco called him
Looking down at his crotch, Harry sees that he’s, unfortunately, still soft. He lets out a gasp when Draco gently cups him.
Draco can only laugh. “I think it’s just part of getting older,” he allows. His next words are cut off when Harry spreads his cheeks and there’s the quick chill of a cleaning spell.
“I would not say such things if I were you,” Voldie growled as he pulled Draco towards his own quarters.
Draco took a deep breath. “He’s smarter than I was at that age and twice as kind. But he’s terrible at bathtime. It takes twenty minutes to get him in and then once he’s in, it takes twenty minutes to get out!” Warming to his subject, Draco continued, “And he leaves his trainers everywhere! I’ve tripped on them no less than three times. He’s started shouting from his room, something I’m sure he learned from you and your lot, and he refuses to eat chicken unless it’s breaded.”
In fear for the first time, Bellatrix sent an assortment of curses at Hermione, but somehow Hermione’s Shield was strong enough to keep them all at bay. Bolstered by her Shield, Hermione repeated, “Hello. My name is Hermione Granger. You killed my father. Prepare to die.”
There was no answer for a few moments that seemed to stretch forever. Finally, Draco looked back up at Harry.
That sets Harry off again and this time, Draco can’t keep his own laughter in. Making Harry laugh isn’t something Draco has ever really thought about, but now that he’s seen it, he wants to keep it happening. Harry’s eyes twinkle and he laughs with his whole body. It makes Draco think about mornings spent drinking tea together in their dressing gowns, and sitting outside drinking wine, watching the stars, and all sorts of soppy domestic things.
Draco stalks over to the door and flings it open, then twirls and goes behind his desk, making Harry vividly remember Draco's dramatics at Hogwarts.
Harry reached up and grabbed Draco’s hair, gently, to hold him in place. He kissed Draco, nipped at his bottom lip, then licked the sting away. Draco opened his mouth and let Harry’s tongue into his mouth, shivered when it stroked Draco’s tongue. It was hot and wet and Draco wanted to live in this moment forever.
“I got it at the shop, Harry,” Luna says as she starts banging things around in the kitchen. She must use magic to heat the kettle because, almost instantly, it starts to whistle and Luna is back in Harry’s room with a steaming cup of tea. She holds it out, proudly, and Harry takes a sniff of it.
After meetings about war orphans, how to better relationships between werewolves and wix, and his pet project—setting up centres for at-risk youth—he was happy for Saturday to arrive.
His mother tuts at him. “We will be fine, Draco darling.” She lets go of Draco’s hand to pull his head down and kisses him between his brows. “If you’re safe and happy, there’s nothing I can’t endure.”
Ron nods and looks at Harry. "Sounds good," he says while giving Harry a lot of eye contact. "I'll owl you."
talked about their feelings or emotions, but Harry suddenly wanted to wipe the melancholy look off Draco’s face.
Hermione had nodded. “David?” she’d asked, because the night Harry was currently musing about was right around the time he'd met his first boyfriend.
“Oh you poor dear,” Emily said, her voice full of mock sympathy. “You’ve put up with his histrionics for almost two decades.” She stood up and went to Potter’s side. “I have some good whiskey behind the counter. I can pour you a few fingers.”
Malfoy nods, grimacing. “Yes, I’m sure she had more cursed items. I have no idea why this showed up so long after she died, but I’m going to let Robards know that everyone needs to be on the lookout for more.”
“You’re welcome,” Harry answered. Then, “Hey, maybe one day you can bring Scorpius out to Ron and Hermione’s and they can play with Rose and Hugo. Rose is at a Muggle primary school and she doesn’t know many magical children outside of her cousins.”
Ron let out a snort of laughter at that. “Best let them see if they can go on a date without injuring the other before we start talking marriage.”
“And now you are too.” Harry rolled him so that he was straddling Draco’s lap. “This feels good,” he said, doing a little shimmy. “I’ve never sat on someone like this.” He leaned down and kissed Draco’s shoulder. “You have freckles,” he said, delighted.
Harry looks over to see what Draco has ordered and is pleased to see he has also ordered the meatballs. Silence falls as they start eating and Harry has trouble keeping his eyes off of Draco.
Draco’s got his knees in a deathgrip, up as far as they go to give Harry as much room as possible to work. He feels a bit like a pig on a spit, but Harry’s eyes got dark when he first assumed the position, so he reckons something must be working for him.
Harry Apparated back to The Burrow laughing. “I thought you said Malfoy was good at his job,” he said to Ginny.
“Rose certainly takes after her mother,” Malfoy adds, now looking at a picture of Rose and Hermione. “She’s the most willful toddler I’ve ever met.”
“Quit making excuses!” Zacharias shouted. “Hurry up and climb you buffoon! Do I need to find myself a new giant?”
“Children!” Harry shouts, then stops as he hears two distinct cracks outside their cottage that could only be Draco.
Draco looks up. “What does that have to do with anything?” He assures himself that no one can hear the squeak in his voice.
and I haven’t dated in a while.” Harry moved his arm and twisted his head to look at Draco. “It’s not a secret to my friends or family. In fact they...well they know I’ve been interested in you since we reconnected.”
“Probably going to lease it out to a big chain store,” Emily said. “Boots or something.” She gave Draco a weird look. “Unless…”
“Yeah, yeah,” Harry says back. “No sass.” He looks at the eagle owl, its huge head scanning the room. “Who are you here for, love?” he asks it. The owl hops towards Harry and delicately extends the leg with a piece of parchment tied to it.
“Maybe tomorrow, after my knees stop hurting, we can try again,” Harry allows. “But in the bed.” He wraps himself in the fluffy towel and snickers at Draco’s, “You’re the
“No!” Harry half shouts. “Your ears will stay. And I’ll tell you why: so that every shriek of every child at seeing your hideousness will be yours to cherish— every babe that weeps at your approach, every woman who cries out, ‘Dear god, what is that thing?’ will echo in your perfect ears.” Harry glared at Voldie. “That is what ‘to the pain’ means. It means Draco and I get to go live our happily ever after while you are here, mutilated, ugly, unloved
Biting his lip, Harry thought about what his best friends were saying. “I still don’t want to be set-up.”
, Draco felt comfortable in only treble-checking them. Another month and Draco went down to double-checking his data and potions. By then, Draco was having to turn down events because he couldn't attend each event himself and he was seriously starting to consider looking for an apprentice.
Ron’s face goes an exciting hue of red and Malfoy’s ears go pink and his grin is blinding. Malfoy throws up a quick Shield Charm to deflect the jink Ron fires off at him. Harry’s starting to realise that the Malfoy who goes pink and happy is Harry’s favourite version of Draco. But then his face becomes more serious.
She did as ordered and Draco was left to fend for himself. He stumbled when he was finally free from the leather bindings and was promptly pulled away as Zacharias moved them from the edge of the cliff to a more grassy area. “Hermione, take care of him,” said Zacharias, still pulling Draco and motioning for Ron to join them. “As soon as you’re done cutting the rope and he’s fallen…” he trailed off as Hermione finished cutting the thick rope. “Let’s go!” he ordered.
Wandless and trapped, Hermione straightened her shoulders and lifted her chin. “Kill me quickly?” she asked, softly.
we can go back to my flat.” Draco paused, looked at the townspeople again, turned back to Potter. “Before you say anything, I share the flat with my mother and it’s very small and it’s only one room.”
“I promise,” Voldie answered. “Nothing shall happen to him. I give you my word as the first of my name, Prince Voldie Plonker Riddle.”
. Draco was bound and gagged and made to sit down by the rock. Zacharias muttered, wildly, to himself as they watched the man in black approach. As he got within speaking distance, Zacharias pulled out his wand and jammed it into Draco’s jaw.
Jamie’s snort is clearly heard by all of the guests on the front steps. Draco scowls, Mrs Malfoy’s eyes twinkle, and Scorpius laughs.
Ron lets himself flop down into his chair which is still by Harry’s desk. Then he shakes himself out of his funk and grins at Harry.
“Thanks for not letting me get rid of him,” he whispers, their lips still touching. “He’s one of my favourite people.”
The guards started shuffling and shouting, scared of the wraith that was somehow floating before them.
cut off from our world, Potter,” Draco spat out. Because yes, he didn’t know much about what was going on, but he did know his best friend was dating a Gryffindor.
Harry giggles into his skin and it tickles Draco a little. The sensation fades as Harry starts to bite and suck at the same spot, treading the line of pain-pleasure that makes Draco non-verbal.
Draco could hear Harry murmuring in his ear and he reached down to pull at his cock, stroking it hard and fast, letting Harry squeeze, unconsciously this time, around his spent prick. Draco shuddered from oversensitivity but kept grinding his hips against Harry until he felt his whole body tense and he shouted. Draco’s hand was covered in Harry’s hot, wet release and he pulled out, wincing a bit as Harry tried to keep him inside.
Harry’s hips are shifting as Draco plays with his arse, and he can’t keep back a moan when Draco moves his mouth from his earlobe to the place behind Harry’s ear that’s always been sensitive.
, he did a few odd jobs for the Ministry, helped Hermione with a couple of projects, annoyed Ron in the Auror department, hid in the stock room of Weasley's Wizarding Wheezes for a few months, and ultimately decided to dedicate his time to causes he believed in. It wasn’t a long-term solution for his life, but it was something that got him out of bed for the time being.
Draco heard a rush of air and he was covered in a Cooling Charm. He let out a yawn and settled back into his bed, straightening his sheets and pulling up his duvet.
“Oh, yes,” Molly said. “Minerva was over for tea last month and was talking about how much he’s changed and what a good father he’s become.” Molly looked at Harry with a smile. “You should invite him over for Sunday lunch sometime. His son is Rose’s age. I’m sure they would have a fun time.”
and Harry felt a little wild. “What if he’s still…” he looked over at Rose who had wandered off to the bookcase in the corner. “What if he’s still,” he repeated, “a wanker.”
“This is disgusting,” Ron whispers. “Also!” he half-shouts, “you do both realise we’re at the sodding Ministry, right? This isn’t a second date where everybody gangs up on the ginger.”
Harry gently moves himself off of Draco, grimacing at the feeling of come starting to drip out of his arse. "You're sleeping in the wet spot," he declares.
“Oh,” Harry said and pushed Draco back onto the bed. He crawled over Draco, leaning down to kiss him again. “Well, then definitely. Let’s try out the bed.”
nice. Draco had seen his fair share from his adventures on the continent. It was soft on his thigh, fat and uncut. It let out a little twitch as Draco kept staring at it.
After a few more minutes of climbing, Draco felt the angle at which he was being carried, changed. He opened his eyes and realized they had finally reached the top of the cliff and Ron was pulling them all up to solid ground.
Letting out a huff of indignation Hermione repeated, “Fine,” and went to explore her surroundings. She took in the sparse greenery and the sand, taking note of places to trap the mysterious man and where she might be trapped herself. After having looked around twice, she walked back to the edge of the cliff. “Honestly, have you made
Draco’s starting to get hard against Harry’s leg, and Harry’s more hard than not when they start to grind against each other. Everything is slick and hot and it feels like
“Harry, you’ve always been our friend and Malfoy, we used to hate you, but now it turns out you’re not so bad.” Malfoy lets out a little snort at that. “So I would like to make a little toast to our guests.”
“Can I come in?” Ron’s voice comes through. “I know I was joking, but also, like I kinda wasn’t? You’d both better be decent!”
“Oh, precious Potter doesn’t like tattoos?” Malfoy taunts, still pink at the tips of his ears and the apples of his cheeks.
“I spent the first two months living at the inn because all the flats were occupied, but then a tenant moved out and Mother and I moved in.” Draco looked at his hands as he recited his story. “For some reason, the most bitter person in the place imprinted on me and the rest of the town seems to tolerate us. They think my mother’s
Hermione let out a little hum of agreement. “How long do we need to wait before we can give it to him?”
“Don’t mind it.” Draco’s voice was softer and starting to get heavy from sleep. “Just like being where you are.”
“It’s still creepy, mate.” Harry can’t quite stop his full body shudder and turns his chair so he doesn’t have to look at the thing again.
Draco laughed at him. “Reconnected?” he asked. “Is that how we’re framing it?” Harry smiled back at him. “We’re not going with ‘Harry bullied me into doing what I wanted to do’?”
“Why haven’t you done anything with a bloke before?” Then Draco realised what he’d said. “I mean, that’s super personal so—”
“Are you OK?” Harry asks, searching Draco’s face for what, he’s not sure, but Draco is shuttered off and cold.
Harry pauses and twists his fingers a little and Draco lets out a gasp. He pushes a little deeper as he twists his wrist, and the smooth slide from the lube combined with the way Harry’s moving his fingers has Draco rubbing himself against the sheets.
So when Malfoy drops by Harry and Ron’s office a week after the dinner, Harry hopes to greet him like a functional human being.
Then it was Harry’s turn to be levitated to the ground. Draco had already grabbed a broom and Harry climbed on behind him. Hermione’s arms were wrapped tightly around Ron’s middle as they shared their broom. Taking off in tandem they flew off to their freedom, confident in their love, sure of their safety, glad to have found friendly faces in their conspirators. They flew until dawn and love filled Harry and Draco’s hearts as they landed. Harry swept Draco into a breathtaking kiss. Time itself seemed to stop as they kissed. Since the invention of the kiss, there have been five kisses that were rated the most passionate, the most pure. This one left them all behind.
“Well if Granger and Weasley approve,” Draco says, pushing past Harry to open the door, “then I suppose it can’t be too dreadful. No matter how badly it’s named.”
“I hate you both,” Draco said. “I’ve got to go to the café to pick up a tea for Mother.” He glared at Emily. “You are
Hermione was at the rear of the ship, looking off in the distance while Ron was trying to placate their apparent leader.
It couldn't have been too bad because Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth when Harry rubbed their tongues together. Draco rolled them so he was perched on top of Harry, balancing himself on his elbows. He leaned to the left and started kissing and nipping Harry’s neck. Harry let out a gasp at a particularly sharp bite and his hips rolled up into Draco’s.
“You don’t even know anything about what you would be a partner in,” he said with a sneer. “Potty Potter just throwing money—”
They make their way to Harry’s bedroom and Harry flicks on the light, thankful that his room is clean. Harry watches as Draco sheds his trousers and shirt, then rushes to follow suit. They settle themselves into Harry’s linens in their pants and undershirts and Harry whispers “
With a deep breath, Draco started telling a revised version of his life since school. He talked about meeting Astoria and their marriage of convenience; “Really, I hadn’t thought to ever get married. I just assumed the Malfoy line would die with me, but the Greengrasses made the Malfoys look progressive”, and the ordeal of conceiving Scorpius; “The tits on the women in the magazines, Potter! They were unnatural!”
They stood in silence for a few moments before Hugo came running into the kitchen. “Ahhhhh!” he yelled and successfully broke up the weirdness.
“It’s a little cool outside but we can bring out a space heater if you need it,” she said as they followed her to a small courtyard with wrought iron tables and chairs. Against the building, there was a table set for two with several candles burning bright.
The man in black Conjured two clay goblets. He reached into his pocket (there must have been an Undetectable Extension Charm on it) and pulled out a bottle of wine and a small phial filled with a clear liquid. He filled up the goblets half-way then handed the phial to Zacharias. “This is a variant of Weedosoros. It’s undetectable, but unlike the standard brew, this is fatal. No painful convulsions, just death. If you are willing—”
He motions to where the restaurant is supposed to be and he and Draco start walking together. Harry’s happy that the extra inch (or three as Draco is fond of pointing out) doesn’t mean that Harry has to quicken his pace to keep up with Draco. They seem to walk in sync and it’s another weird tidbit that Harry files away to think about later. Not in an obsessive way, just in a general, kind-of-wondering way,
"I thought I was bisexual and I know penetration isn't the end-all-be-all of gay sex but I wanted to know if I would enjoy the feeling."
Harry shuts him up with a kiss, close-mouthed and chaste. Their noses bump a bit, but Draco’s lips are soft under Harry’s and Harry sighs into it. Draco tilts his head and deepens the kiss, licking at Harry’s lips. Harry retaliates by nipping at Draco’s lower lip. Draco opens his mouth and coaxes Harry in.
“Colours of the world! Spice up your life! Every boy and every girl! Spice up your life! People of the world! Spice up your life! Aaaaaah,” he sings.
Harry’s face went fond again. Draco hid his smile behind his hands. They stared at each other for several long seconds.
They put in their order for mains and Harry ends up getting the spaghetti and meatballs. After inhaling a good portion of the calamari, Harry decides he can’t possibly eat more breaded and fried food
“Harry! That’s great! You’ll have to tell me everything tomorrow or whenever this has all settled down.”
“Now, I expect you to tell me if I do anything you don't like,” he said, still looking down at Harry. After an answering nod, Draco leaned forward to kiss him. “Anything,” he reiterated.
“Don’t finish that sentence!” Harry shouted. “Just forget everything.” Slumping deeper into the bed, Harry quietly said, “Please.”
Harry lifted Draco’s hand up and kissed his knuckles, one by one. Then he leaned in and gently kissed Draco on the mouth.
"I do not wish to leave you, but unless you marry well, I'm afraid you will lose your family farm. I cannot be the one to cause that to happen. I will come back able to take care of us both, Draco."
“So we’re going to lease the building?” Potter asked, excitement evident in his voice. He got up and flipped the light switch.
“It’s nothing,” Harry insisted, sitting down next to Emily. “Draco. It’s really…” he trailed off but didn’t object when Emily handed it to Draco.
learning spells and perfecting them so that I’m able to wield them with the delicacy you see.” He sent a small gust of air towards them, making Emily’s dark hair wind into Stella’s blond hair until they were perfectly plaited.
“He gave me a drink and I’m almost certain it wasn’t Firewhiskey. It’s gotten me rather bladdered.” Draco glared at the burly Weasley. “I think he’s trying to take me out so he can snatch you up.”
Draco sits down on the bed, and flops backwards so they’re both laying in the bed with their feet more-or-less on the floor.
Looking down his nose, Draco lets out a little snort. “It sounded like you were going to reward your creature for some reason.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Fine,” he conceded. “Scorpius is great. He and Rose seem to be getting on well together.”
“But,” Zacharias continued, “Weedosoros is not a common poison, and variants of it are even more unusual. Potions Masters in Knockturn Alley are known for experimentation, so surely this must be evidence that you are a criminal. If you’re a criminal you would have put the poison in the wine in front of yourself, assuming everyone is like you and wouldn’t trust the word of a stranger. Which means I should drink the wine in front of me. But!” he cried, making Draco flinch away. “You seem smart enough to realise I would recognize you as a criminal and couldn’t be trusted, so I would be remiss in choosing the wine in front of me. Also you must know I don’t trust you and would want to swap goblets, so I cannot choose the wine in front of you.”
He took a moment to take Harry in, sans clothes. Harry, Draco decided, looked good in light, cool colours. His skin had looked amazing in his white shirt, but now, against the cool mint of the duvet, he looked like a bronzed statue. His black hair was a mess, spread across the pillow, his smile bright on his face, his arms were strong and more muscular than Draco had imagined. He had the tiniest hint of a stomach, just a little softness in the middle that made Draco want to kiss all over it. He had a trail of black hair that led to…
“If we know to look for dark magic on objects that have a rather macabre effect, then I think we'll be able to easily identify the objects.”
Harry drops his face in his hand. “Cut me some slack, yeah?” he asks. “It’s hard being a single parent.”
offer of more Firewhiskey. Then Molly had offered Draco a glass of wine, and combined with the fact that his mother had French serving sizes at brunch and he’d been too nervous to eat more once they'd reached the Burrow, Draco was probably drunk.
Drained by the hustle and bustle at King’s Cross, Draco decides he wants something stronger than tea. “Firewhiskey?” he asks.
“Mother and I moved around the continent, living off Father’s money until the Ministry took it all and we had to move here because they didn’t want a Muggle building. Apparently, some distant relation bought the building as a wedding present. They weren’t fans of my parents. Obviously.”
“Spaghetti Westerns,” Harry answers immediately. He looks at Ron and fires off two-finger guns. “Pardner.”
Bellatrix tittered. “True.” She tossed her wand between her left and right hand, as if taunting Harry.
Its rumbly purr and little ears are not budging Draco’s heart. At all. Neither is the tail that swishes back and forth with its little striped pattern.
“I’m sure we’ll find him,” Harry reassures her. “He’s probably  at Fortescue’s trying to steal all of the ice cream scoops.”
Ignoring their conversation, Draco walked over to the sofa and made himself comfortable. Somehow, his Muggle, sarcastic-as-shit best friend and Harry had become friends. Draco let their conversation wash over him as he thought about the logistics of the opening.
Draco smiles. “It’s fine. You’ll be picking up the bill, and free food tastes better than—dear Merlin, Harry, this can’t be the place.”
While waiting for a return owl from Harry, Draco had started walking around the castle to help calm his mind. He had gotten progressively more anxious as the date of his wedding to Voldie grew nearer. He heard Prince Voldie shout at the Carrows and at hearing his name, he walked into Voldie’s chambers.
poor decision. He does decide that if Draco can kiss his cheek, then he can also politely kiss Draco and so, he leans over and places a featherlight kiss on Draco’s wine-tinted lips.
wandlessly cursed Bellatrix so that her left cheek started bleeding, an exact copy of Hermione’s own curse scar.
“It is!” Harry insists. “You’ve saved our arses so many times since we all graduated from Hogwarts. It’s not your fault your aunt was basically evil incarnate.”
"Yeah, Malfoy said sorry for being a twat before," Seamus had told Ron, Harry, Dean, and Neville, all of them crowded in Harry and Ron's tiny room. "He never really bothered me much, but he was a right dick to everyone else so I told him 'whatever' and he fucked off."
Draco's barely finished his sentence before Harry's impaling himself and groaning at the stretch. His earlier observation was correct: Draco is
Harry’s chest feels tight but he's happy. “That’s a leap from not knowing if I hated you,” he says. He settles himself on one end of the couch and takes Draco’s feet onto his lap.
“Still…” Harry said, waving his hands, not sure what to do with them as he talked to a sad Draco Malfoy.
“I can try,” Draco huffs out. He’s able to widen his legs, slightly, and Harry moves so his shoulders are wedged between Draco’s thighs. Leaning down, he licks a slow stripe up Draco’s prick.
Draco’s eyes search Harry’s face, and he must find what he’s looking for because he turns and lets Harry into his office. Harry gently closes the door and looks around.
His mother’s bed was neatly made and a mere metre and a half away from his tiny bed. Privacy was clearly a thing of the past. Draco’s mind drifted to the years after the war when he and his mother had fled to the continent and Draco had done some soul searching and some, well
“I was actually on a case in the area,” Potter replied. “I’m a cursebreaker for the Auror Department and there were a couple of nasty cursed items, so I spent the night. I was checking out of the local inn when I ran into Draco.”
“I don’t care,” he admits, feeling wanton as he rubs his naked body all over Harry’s fully clothed one.
He reaches in to turn the tap on hot and waits for it to start to heat. Draco comes up behind him and wraps his arms around Harry’s waist. They stand in silence until the glass starts to fog a little from the water, and Harry does a little temperature test. When he’s fiddled enough so that it’s still hot but not scalding, he turns and pulls Draco’s shirt off and his pants down. They’d taken off their trousers to nap, and Harry’s smiling at Draco’s sleepy compliance.
Draco let out another sigh and went to sit on the sofa with Scorpius. “It’s fine,” he said. “I’m probably blowing everything out of proportion.”
Harry moves so he’s half on top of Draco, his leg slung over Draco’s hips and his upper body against Draco’s. “I want to kiss you as I undress you,” he says in lieu of answering.
He smiled and held up two brooms. “I found these!” he said proudly. “I was wandering around and found Voldie’s broom shed and grabbed them! I thought if we found Draco,” he looked up and saw that Draco and Harry had joined Hermione at the window, “hello Draco! But if we ever found him, then Harry and Draco could share one and you and I could share one.”
“What do you think they’re going to do with the building?” Draco asked in a rush, eager to try and move past his faux pas. Telling someone he thought they were old was frowned upon in both Muggle and Wizarding societies.
“Of course it would be Potter,” Draco groans. He takes another drink of his wine, almost finishing it, and steels himself for the inevitable. “We’ve got to owl Potter.” Draco’s voice is resigned.
Peanut Butter runs into the room, summoned by all the shouts and laughter— he’s always liked to be in the room with as many people as possible— and jumps into Draco’s lap.
“I got some edibles,” she whispered. “I have someone checking in in a few hours and then I thought we could get silly and watch another monster film.”
“Are you OK?” Harry asked, his voice full of concern. “Your breathing went all funny and you got paler than usual.”
Draco’s voice was reedy and high, and after a few seconds, his mouth had dropped open. He let out a little, broken sound, and Harry could feel his come joining Harry’s.
“That’s not why I’m here.” Harry walks away from the door, past the desk, into the far corner where Draco is hiding. He ends up close enough to feel Draco’s warmth.
“I can’t!” he shouted back. “The life of the potions are made so they lock in the weather for the life of the event—”
he currently wants, and Harry just wants something that’s somewhat healthy to eat and not hard to make.
The next time Harry sees Draco is on Draco’s birthday. Draco looks furious at the crowd surrounding him in the tiny breakroom of the DMLE. They're trying to sing to him, and though there is cake, Harry still flees.
request from his husband, but Draco’s glad they had put all three up. It’d helped significantly that Harry and Ginny had parted amicably and were still on good terms. And Draco knew it meant a lot to Scorpius to see his mum on the wall with all of his new family.
“Go back to the beginning,” she slurred. “That’s what Zach always said.” She drank from a flask and fired off a few Stinging Hexes. “I’m at the beginning!” she shouted. “What am I supposed to do now?”
Harry just smiled at him. “Nonsense. We’ll be perfectly safe there. Just because the forest has killed everyone who has entered it, doesn't mean we'll meet the same fate.”
“Ah,” the shorter one says, catching sight of Draco standing motionless in the centre of the room. “I think I should leave this to you then.” He kisses the other man who has platinum blond hair, not unlike Draco’s own, and Draco notices a familiar scar on the shorter man’s forehead.
He’s interrupted by the Malfoys' eagle owl. Scanning the note, he grabs his biro and writes down their address, and the owl flies off. He’s assuming they will be Apparating because if rumours are true, Draco and his son live right outside wizarding London, which is a brisk forty-five minute ride by broom.
Oliver Wood was eating a mini-tart and talking with his hands to Emily and Stella. From the looks they were sending Draco, he knew they were talking about
“So, Draco,” says the man with blond hair in a kind voice. “I think we have some things to discuss.”
“Hello boys,” she said. “Welcome to the hotbed of activity in our little Hamlet.” She looked around the room and nodded at the other people there. “You all know my son Draco, and this is his little business partner, Ha—”
“Why didn’t you tell me about that sooner!” Harry exclaimed. “And what I wouldn’t give for my old invisibility cloak.”
"Potter," Malfoy says, quite possibly with a sneer, but Harry is too busy looking at the hem of his burgundy skinny jeans. "You've gotten weirder."
“I will,” Draco promises. “But if you’re not fucking me in like, half an hour, I’m going to be very put out.”
They were on the faded, lumpy sofa in the lobby of the inn, drinking. It was well past check-in time and Draco had gotten his hands on a couple of really good bottles of fruit wine from a local farmer. The peach wine was empty and they were working their way through a blackberry merlot.
Standing still for a few moments and catching her breath, Hermione looked down at Bellatrix. She was convinced that she had vanquished the other woman and looked up. She whispered, “Father, I miss you,” before healing her wounds and running off to try and find Ron and Harry.
“I can’t believe I was nervous about coming to Christmas with you lot,” Draco said, then shrieked as he was hit by water on all sides.
?” Ron nodded and threw the rock off to the side. It clattered loudly but neither the man in black nor Ron paid attention to it. They both nodded and sized each other up.
“Sorry!” he insists, pulling away. “Just—” he laughs again. “I guess it was getting annoyed at the proximity of someone else,” Draco says looking down at his chest.
Harry laughed and Draco couldn’t bite back a smile. “I think you’re in the clear on this one, Draco,” he said, gesturing to Draco’s trunks. “All of your stuff is packed away.”
And he’s probably straight. Did you see his trousers? No self-respecting queer would wear jeans like that
One thing Harry'd realised, during his great Bi-awakening, was that he’s attracted to competence. He and Hermione had gotten roaringly drunk while Ron had been working late one night, years ago, and they’d discussed all of his crushes.
Rolling her eyes, Emily saluted Draco with her coffee and went back to her seat behind the counter. “She would have figured it out,” she said. “That or she would have worried about you overexerting yourself.” Emily let out a little laugh. “Really, I did you a favour.”
“I believe you said you were going to fuck me into the mattress,” Draco answers in his most prim voice.
“I was in France,” Draco said. “And Italy, and Spain, and for a brief, glorious fortnight, Ibiza. Since then, I’ve been stuck here in the middle of nowhere and we
the aesthetic instead of against it. A big computer would have been incorrect. He had lost the fight about the plungers, but won the war on the register.
Voldie turned back to his two enforcers. “Nothing must happen to Draco,” he reiterated. The Carrows grunted their agreement. “Now go!” he demanded. “Clear out the forest!”
Harry had been relieved. He hadn’t been in a good mind frame for a long-term relationship. Plus he'd started to think that maybe he also fancied blokes so he was thankful he had some time to sow some wild oats. In the ensuing years, he had dated both men and women and wix who didn’t identify as either. Harry had turned from the Wizarding War's poster-child to the poster-child for the new queer movement in the magical community.He really didn’t care for being a poster-child for
"We hid it in the corner then threw my invisibility cloak over it," Harry says, a little sheepishly.
Draco lets out a low laugh. “Well there’s only about a fifty percent chance the culprit will have their magical signature in the registry. We don’t keep tabs on everyone. Mainly people convicted of violent crimes and Death Eaters. Granger led that campaign—”
Draco rolls his eyes then leans down to pull his trousers and pants off in one motion. Harry makes a sort-of dying caveman grunt when he sees Draco’s dick. It’s pink, like the tips of his ears and thick enough to be a mouthful.
Fred and George started a slow, exaggerated clap that quickly turned into cheering. Molly tried to scowl, but the effect was ruined by the pleased look on her face.
“I don't fear you,” Draco declared brazenly. “How can I, when I know Harry will come? We are bound by True Love, something you’ll never know. Love like ours cannot be destroyed by spells or potions; it cannot be tracked down and tortured; it cannot be broken by anything you can Conjure. And believe me when I tell you you
Ron turned to Harry. “Sorry, mate,” he muttered, looking for somewhere to stash Harry. “I need to go help Hermie.” He dragged Harry down the hall then turned the corner. There was a suit of armour in a little alcove so Ron gently draped Harry over it. “I’ll be right back,” he said, then took off towards Hermione.
Harry took in Neville, still smiling even whilst soaked from head to toe. Nodding, Harry said, “Yeah, that sounds great actually. I haven’t been back there for an age.”
Harry walks to their bed and kneels on the edge of the mattress, gently kissing Draco on the back of the head.
“When Al came home for Christmas hols talking about his new friend, Scorpius Malfoy.” He waves Draco into the kitchen.
They both stood in silence as they took in the sign. It was a pretty normal sign, burgundy with black posts and gold writing. Even the cricket balls and bats weren’t so horrible, considering the Hamlet had been named by a cricket enthusiast.
“Yes!” Hermione squeaked. “How will we find Draco? And once we do, how will I find Bellatrix? And once she’s dead, how will I find you both? And what will Ron be doing while we find Draco and Bellatrix? And once we’ve rescued Draco and I’ve slain Bellatrix how will we all escape?” She took a deep breath, but before she could continue, Ron cut her off.
With a snort, Harry pulled Draco into an embrace. “Keep telling yourself that, dear,” he whispered. “But you’re really as soft and gooey as a marshmallow. You should see your face when you talk about Scorpius.”
“So,” Draco started. Paused. “The Blue Moon doesn’t exactly have the budget for champagne.” He wrinkled his nose. “They have
“Neville!” Harry interrupted what was surely the start of a rant, clearly a sore subject. “How exactly do you think I know about the happily ever after?”
Almost-but-not-quite Draco throws back his head and laughs. Draco sits up in the bed and glares at him.
well, but when Harry’s nerves are already strained, she sometimes makes things worse. Except for the time she got him high with her loose leaf tea. It wasn’t his finest moment, but it had really mellowed him out.
“Yes,” agreed Hermione with a quick hex, “but you must realize it’s easily countered by McGonagall’s shield?”
Harry’s head flopped again, but he was able to roll it to look at Hermione. “There’s no way the three of us, with only
Prince Voldie was in his chambers, again at his desk, waiting on the Carrows, his Chief Enforcers, to come. He was finishing a missive, when Alecto cleared her throat. “Sir?” she asked.
They sat in relative silence, Draco eating his toast and Emily slurping her milkshake. After a few minutes, Stella came back to their table and settled into the empty seat across the booth.
of heights, but between the constant jostling and the sheer size of the cliff, he didn’t want to make himself sick.
“I have a ninety-seven percent success rate,” Draco said, unable to keep the cold tone out of his voice. “The Zabini wedding, the Harpies event, Hogwarts—”
Regrettably, it has no response. Leaning back against the cold tile of the shower wall, he debates turning the tap to cold or indulging himself. The debate takes all of two seconds before he’s whispering a lubrication charm and taking himself in hand.
Black smiled. “Oh?” he asked. “Do tell. Was he like your fiancé: rich beyond measure, hideous, and caring for no one but himself?”
“My belly will pooch out if I eat too much,” Harry says sullenly, already planning on wearing the tight shirt.
It had taken the better part of a day to get all of their things into the flat, and another to make any headway unpacking. Since they had settled in a Muggle-adjacent area, they couldn’t use magic for everything. So when Luna announced that they needed lunch, Draco jumped at the chance to leave the heavy lifting and mind-numbing organising to Ginny and Harry.
Harry looks down at his ratty jeans and t-shirt, things that are fine under his Auror robes, but definitely won't work for a first date.
Harry groaned as Draco started finger fucking him again. The lube squelched obscenely and when Draco added a gentle twist that crossed his fingers, Harry let out a full body moan.
“No, Harry. You’re not going to get pissed and flirt with Malfoy. You’re not nearly as suave as you think you are.”
Or what Harry thinks is supposed to be a wink but is really just an awkward fluttering of his eyelashes. Harry is charmed and feels himself flush.
don’t get anything delivered by Owl Post because, Emily notwithstanding, we do actually try and obey the law.”
Harry wiggled his hips, moved his legs, first his right then his left, up and down Draco’s legs. He hooked his left leg around Draco’s ankle and bucked his hips again. Draco stayed as still as he could, caught between the tight hold Harry had on his cock and the wiggling of the rest of his body. Harry wiggled and wriggled until Draco couldn't stand it.
Draco nods and holds out his arm so they can Side-Along, and there’s the familiar pull in his gut, and then they’re home.
Draco wrenches himself away and scurries until he’s across the room. “You can’t say things like that to me at work, Potter!” he exclaims.
When Harry reaches Draco’s office, Draco is frantically casting. He watches in silence for a few long minutes before deciding to sit down on the loveseat. It’s apparent Draco hasn’t noticed Harry come in, his eyes haven’t left the clown since Harry arrived. His brows are furrowed, his mouth in a straight line, and it’s all Harry can do to not get up and snog him senseless.
Some horrible sound emits from his chest and Draco doesn't have it in him to care. Harry’s lets his head fall until it rests gently on Draco’s hips.
The answer to Harry’s question runs into their room and pounces on Draco’s arm, then begins to gently gnaw on his elbow.
Malfoy stares at him, then lets out a little laugh. “I suppose you would know,” he allows. “I do enjoy talking magical theory with Hermione. And Weasley’s a decent cook.”
As Voldie turned to walk back to the castle, Bellatrix found the correct knot and pressed the point of the wand against it. The tree trunk opened and she walked down the stairs to her
Voldie smiled. “Then we shall simply owl for him to return. I will send my fastest owl to find him. Her tracking skills are almost equal to my own. She will find him. But when she does, Draco, darling, what happens if he declines? You did abandon him at the exit of the Forbidden Forest. And he
Ron laughs. “No, Harry got a little too invested in, what were those things we watched over the weekend?”
His mother waved her hand at him. “You know how I am with names,” she explained. “I just can’t remember anyone’s.”
“Thanks,” Draco mumbled, as he scanned the shelves for something that he might buy among the trinkets and oddly packaged food items. He
“See if you get any this holiday,” Harry says with absolutely no bite. He’s having trouble keeping back his laugh at the look of dismay on Draco’s face.
The animal in question is curled up in Scorpius’ arms, making a weird rumbly noise. It is louder and rougher than a house cat's purr, but that’s the closest thing Draco can compare it to. Scorpius is murmuring to it and scratching it around the ears.
“Good.” Draco said then kissed him. Dropping his wand, Draco started to fuck his tongue into Harry’s mouth, rolling his hips, letting their cocks rub agaist each other until the bit of slick Harry’s had became tacky and uncomfortable. He pulled back and knelt between Harry’s spread thighs.
“You kicked me in the head!” Harry hisses back, holding the ear that Draco had knocked his boney knee into only seconds before.
! I’ve been sleeping in a single for the past year! It’s been horrible.” Draco sniffled. “So yes, I am getting emotional over the size of my bed.”
Draco heard her announce something to the crowd then there was the sound of multiple Apparations. Luna was still standing by his side. She had closed her eyes and tilted her head up so the rain ran down her face in an unbroken wave.
“If you need anything,” she said over her shoulder, “ring the bell. Everything is half price until we move.” Then she disappeared behind the curtain.
Draco’s eyebrows are threatening to reach his hairline. “You’re attracted to me,” he says, a little smugly.
him. ‘Mione said it was fine if we just bet on you admitting to yourself that you had a pash on Draco.”
Prince Voldie and his entourage rode to the rocky terrain. He dismounted and looked at the demolished rocks. “Someone fought a giant and won,” he said as he walked to where an outline of Ron’s unconscious body was still visible in the grass. “Again, the victor leaves towards Surrey.” Voldie looked at Bellatrix and gave her a sharp nod.
He pushes Draco’s knees apart and settles between his legs. Draco’s head pops up again to look, first at Harry, then at his cock.
Straightening his shoulders, Draco said, “Unfortunately, I have neither the means nor the experience to start my own business.” He felt himself go back into stiff Pureblood mode, something he was trying to break himself of, but when he was upset, the cold aloof manner came back full force.
“And yet, here we are,” Draco answered with a yawn. “I do believe it’s about time for me to retire to bed. If you’ll show me where that is, I would be grateful.”
Harry paused, not sure what he wanted to admit. But he knew he wanted to talk to Draco more. He wanted to learn more about his childhood nemesis and see first-hand how he'd changed and turned into the quiet man in front of him.
“Ginny and I broke up after the war and I’ve been single ever since.” Potter was staring ahead, his brow furrowed. “
His smart arse comment is cut short as Harry hits Draco in the face with his pillow. Bob lets out a little yowl and jumps out of the bed.
“I like it when you’re too worked up to speak,” Harry admits as he pulls his finger out. “Two?” he asks casually.
He deliberately looks at Harry’s chest where, yes, as he had feared, the middle button, right between his pecs is threatening to pop open.
“Don’t be so hard on yourself, Draco,” she said with a smile. “I’m going to retrieve my wife. I’ll make sure she doesn’t do anything rash.”
He’s cut off when Harry reaches down and grabs his prick with the hand that’s still slightly wet from lube. Draco loses his breath for a second, but soon enough he’s pushing up into Harry’s hand and back onto Harry’s cock and he’s stuck in a perpetual motion machine of his own making.
“Ah, so he’s your business partner and maybe something more?” Draco’s mother said, breaking their eye contact.
Draco couldn’t keep back a smile. “Fine,” he said. “But this better be really bad or else I’m going to talk about my
Then, when Draco lost his wife a couple of years ago, he'd become more sombre and quiet, which intrigued Harry more than he cared to admit. The Draco of Harry’s memory had always been a little theatrical and overly dramatic. Now, he has a sense of gravitas and maturity that he wears well. His face is still pointy and pale, but his grey eyes project so much
Still, Draco couldn’t leave. He took in the store, the tall wide windows that let in so much sunlight, the gorgeous brown of the cherry wood flooring, the antique counter where the cash register sat. The building had beautiful architecture. It was a shame Draco wouldn’t be able to do anything with it. He hoped that it was leased out instead of torn down because it was really a beautiful piece of property.
Prince Voldie laughed as he saw the man in black and Draco fall down the hill. “He must have seen us,” he said as he gestured towards the top of the hill. “But he has had a lapse in judgement. At the bottom of that hill, lies the Forbidden Forest. They have no chance.” He motioned to his entourage. “Come! We must ride to save the prince!”
At his look, Hermione rushed to explain. “No, it’s just that we corresponded after the war and as far as I’m concerned, if you’ve changed as much as you seem to have changed…” She trailed off with a frown. “This is awkward and I don’t like it,” she grumbled. “I’m not supposed to be the uncomfortable one.”
“Wonderful,” Mary said. “Make yourselves comfortable and I’ll be back in a few minutes to take your drink order.”
Malfoy looks at them both before turning and leaving. Harry frowns but it doesn’t last long because after about half a minute, Malfoy walks back in.
Interrupting the old man were roars from outside. Voldie nodded to Bellatrix and she left the chapel at a run. Draco heard Alecto shout “Stand your ground!” and he smiled.
“Of course,” Draco mumbled as he grabbed his leather jacket and walked down the stairs to the street.
“Let’s not shout in the house!” Harry shouts, then sighs. “Fuck,” he whispers. “That was less than ideal.”
Feeling rage pulse through his veins, Draco shouted, “All you know is cruelty and mockery! I died that day!” Stalking closer to the pirate, he said, “And you can die, too, for all I care!” as he pushed Black down the hill.
“We both know we would eat every last bite of our curry and be too full to fuck,” Draco says back. “And I have plans.”
that’s mine now? How did you even find it? It’s forever away from London and all traces of civilisation! And why are you alone? Aren’t you and the Weaselette shacked up with like seven kids by now?”
Harry retaliates with a deep inhale and revels in Draco’s shiver. “I want to smell you all over,” he whispers.
Then they’re both finished eating and Draco Vanishes the trash and Harry takes the bowls back into his kitchen. When he comes back to the lounge, Draco has found a blanket from somewhere and has sprawled across the length of the sofa.
Draco opened his mouth, but before he could say anything, Harry covered it with his hand. Drunk Draco didn’t have time for being silenced so he licked Harry’s hand.
“I didn’t read your mind, love, you said you were handsome so I thought I should tell you so you don’t get a complex.”
Draco pulled back his hand, fast. He thought Harry looked disappointed, but before he could confirm the look, Harry turned to look at Emily. Draco ignored them both and cast a quick charm to freshen himself up.
“No, love,” Draco says, gently. “We’ll have to try this again another night. You’re in no state right now.”
“I don’t wanna talk about it,” Draco mumbles when the silence stretches on for too long. He jumps when he hears Ginny shriek.
Luna gave her a loony smile and started running around the table chanting, “Voldie, Voldie, Voldie, Voldie, Voldie, Voldie,” until Ginny covered her ears and shouted, “Fine! Maybe he
Smiling, Harry walks to Draco, gently nudging him in the shoulder. “You’re funny when you’re flustered.”
Draco reached out and smiled when Emily gave him his tea and the whole bag. He opened it and took a deep breath, taking in the flaky, buttery goodness as Emily made herself comfortable at the foot of Draco’s bed.
Bob looks at Draco with such love in his eyes that Draco falls even more in love with his beautiful, ginger cat.
"She's got good taste," he says as his ears turn pink. "Thursday's no good, but I'm free the rest of the week."
Ron looked over and rolled his eyes. “I heard you, Harry. But you are sort of obsessed with Malfoy.”
He lets his intentions show on his face and Draco nods and leans down, letting their lips meet in the middle. They’re both far too tired and raw to do more, but Harry leans into the kiss, enjoying the warm, wet slide of Draco’s lips on his.
All of the children have been in their flat since they came home for Christmas, and Harry’s Silencing Charms are rubbish, and Draco’s too self-conscious about the size of the flat, so they’ve gotten by with a few lack-lustre handjobs in the two weeks since they’ve had a full house. But it’s Boxing Day, their
Their boat pulled up to a small beach. Ron grabbed Draco’s arm and Apparated them to the base of the cliff. It was a wall of rock that must have been taller than the tallest spire of the castle at Hogwarts. From it hung a thick rope with a large harness.
Draco was cursing under his breath. He had thought Scorpius couldn’t hear him until he piped up with, “Does Grandmother know you use words like that?” and Draco spun around in horror.
“Ah-ha!” he shouted, watching as Harry flinched. Putting his wand away Draco narrowed his eyes. “You’re the reason it’s rained,” he declared.
“The fact that everybody knew I was in love—” Harry pauses and feels his eyes go wide. “Um, that is to say, we were talking about your tattoo and how brave it was for you to get it and whether or not it hurt and how I’m too in love with myself to ever get one. And Ron said that it mustn't hurt too much because—”
