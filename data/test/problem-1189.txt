“Yes, right away.” Harry left to find them. The baby’s things were still and silent. Harry couldn’t believe that at any moment, a tiny little human would sleep in that crib, cry to get fed, and have nappies changed on the special furniture. Draco’s pajamas smelled like him. Like vanilla and sweet spices, and Harry couldn’t help bringing them to his nose to inhale the loveliness.
“There’s nothing wrong with my stomach.” Draco stood up and went behind the counter, taking out the white flannel. Harry quickly realised his mistake.
Draco tightened himself around Harry's cock, and Harry groaned loudly in ecstasy. “Fuck....I'm coming....Draco, fuck...”
“Hey,” Harry said, putting the box on the counter. “I brought some pastries. I stopped by for some coffee after work and they looked delicious.” Draco was sitting still, staring at him.
“Well, that all depends. I think you should open the cage and let them fly. But nobody ever said to stop loving them while they are free. To shower them with food, and gifts, and songs, and shelter. You let the bird go, and they might think you don’t want to remain loyal any longer. You must show them you still love them outside of that cage.”
“Have I found it yet?” Harry asked. “I want to find your spot. I want to hear you scream, Draco.” He gently put his second finger in, alongside the other one. Draco moaned in both pleasure and the slight pressure of his muscles adjusting to the intrusion.
“Harry….I don’t, alright? I don’t like him, so what? Doesn’t mean you can’t. I haven’t spoken to him in years so maybe he’s not all that bad if you like him. What does it matter what I think?”
Harry was silent for a moment. He picked up his glass and took another sip, keeping his eyes on the wall across from them.
“Oh fuck! Merlin fuck!” Draco yelled loudly and felt his orgasm coming closer. “Harry, I'm....I'm so close....”
Draco couldn’t help but smile. Then he joined Harry in laughing at their confessions. “So, I’m not the only bent outcast in this country, that’s good to know.”
“This one has been my guest room of sorts,” he said, leading Draco inside. It had a single bed with an olive green duvet and matching pillows. The windows to the left of it shed light through thin, translucent curtains; creating a dim atmosphere. There were a few pieces of furniture made with the same type of the light wood as the bed. Oak, or pine, Draco figured.
“Exactly! He has no shame, right? Showing his face again around here. Should’ve stayed wherever the fuck they went.”
“You go to bed. I’ll look for her. I don’t remember her surname but I’ll know it when I see it. You go rest.”
“I’m sorry, Harry.” Draco whispered. “I’m sorry. I was scared. I didn’t know how you felt about me. I’m sorry.”
“Harry…..look at her.” Harry was gently feeling the baby’s forehead with his middle finger, looking mesmerized and relieved.
“FUCK!!” He came right into Draco’s body, pumping everything he had inside of him. He fell right on top of Draco’s chest from relief and bliss. They kissed one another, softly this time, and neither felt sleep take them both away.
“Has anyone ever….you know.” He couldn’t bring himself to say it. He saw the confusion on Peter’s face.
“I’m not going to tell him. The baby is mine, I’ll do the raising myself. I’ll have to start buying furniture and clothes and all that…” Draco turned around in his chair, facing Frida directly.
“Hello again, Potter.” This time, Draco didn’t look at him for very long. He kept his concentration on wrapping the bottles Harry had placed on the counter in front of him. There were two bottles of
“Have a seat,” he walked past Harry and set the tray on the coffee table between two sofas, Potter sitting across from him.
“Drakon! Ver are you? Vaso is here!” A tall, striking woman in her sixties appeared in the corridor. A younger man with curly brown hair was standing next to her.
“I know the wizarding world hates talking about these issues. And you're the first transgender magical person I've come across so far. Are you friends with any others?”
His breath smelled heavy with cigarettes and alcohol and Draco knew that this was going to be quick. He himself hadn't a lot to drink but definitely felt the effect of the wine inside his veins. He would've typically picked something stronger, like Firewhiskey, but tonight he felt posh and planned to keep his cool even under the weight of this burly, long-bearded man with thick hands and thick arms.
“No, I’m afraid not. But that’s alright. Searching is half the fun,” he said, giving Harry a wink. “Oh look, Skele-Gro! I think an old man like me could use some of that.” This made Harry laugh.
“Ow...fuck...” Draco moaned in a hoarse voice as his head fell back on the pillow, moving side to side in an attempt to lessen the discomfort and misery he felt being stuck on his back.
“My dear, listen to me. You are more than capable of being a wonderful father to your child, but what harm will it do to tell Harry about it? You don’t know how he’ll react. He might even be there for you when you need help, maybe he’ll want the child.”
“Alright….fine. That’s fine. You were both drunk. I know you’re attracted to blokes and I have to be more understanding of that...so,” he went back to picking food off the table.
“Uh, yeah.” Draco pulled down his pants halfway across his crotch, exposing almost all pubic hair and the scars around them. Harry gently smoothed the light pink lines with the dittany and oil, swallowing as he felt his pounding heart inside his chest. He looked up at Draco's flushed face. He was breathing hard and blinking incredibly slow. He spread his legs just a bit and pushed his pelvis off the bed.
Harry rubbed the dittany to the thick scars on Draco's stomach. His skin felt warm and smooth, doing nothing to calm Harry's growing arousal. He switched to the rose oil and finally looked at Draco's chest.
“Um...yeah, sure, Potter. Uh...that sounds good.” He reminded himself to breathe and look calm, despite the accelerated speed of his heart.
Draco gave him a frail smile. “You’re so kind, Potter. Always are.” He twisted his face and hugged his belly, releasing a long moan.
shimmered on the shop sign as if newly added, and included an aged giant metal ribbon with cut triangle edges flowing elegantly. It was obvious there wasn’t any intention of destroying the former history of the place, but rather working with it to create something new. Right below the dark silver letters were smaller ones that read: “
It was now nearing summer and Draco had a visible bump on his belly. He had made a decision not to hide his condition, and anyone who was curious and asked got the truthful answer. As truthful as Draco decided he was comfortable with. Some of his customers knew he was expecting a baby and were told that it was a decision Draco made on purpose. There was no other father and he’d be parenting on his own. They usually didn’t intrude any more after that.
“I'll get you something then. Meanwhile, if there's anything else you need, no matter how silly you think it is, there's a buzzer here next to your bed,” Harry said, pointing at a red button on the bedpost. “It will send an alert to my wand, and I won't be far away.”
Harry grabbed Draco's elbow and gently pulled him up as Draco grabbed him back; gripping his upper arm. Potter smelled divine. Like pine and vanilla and the fresh morning after a rainy night. Draco closed his eyes and breathed him in while trying to find his balance through the pain.
Frida was helping a couple of witches at the animal section and Draco was sitting behind the counter with the same book in his hands. He looked up as Harry walked in, shutting the door with his foot behind him.
“I...uh…...I have a bad sunburn,” he said, uncomfortably laughing and pointing to his face.” Draco laughed back.
“Mister,” Harry corrected him. “He's transgender, Modley. We need to use he, him, and his. Masculine pronouns.” Modely was silent for longer than Harry's liking.
Lovers of drinks, lovers of gossip, lovers of comfort - even if they only found it in the warm greasiness of their food - and all the lovers in love. Not holding back any public displays of affection. They were irritating him and he figured he was just envious. He couldn’t find it in his exhausted self tonight to care. With a feeling of heavy guilt and an even heavier heart, he snuck out quietly with his head down, and his feet took him toward the darkness of Nocturne Alley. He stopped before going in too deep at this hour of the night - both into the roads and inside himself.
“Yeah, um...that herbal pouch you made...it’s great. Smells good. And I thought….maybe you made teas similar to those things.”
Draco didn’t watch Harry leave. He released the breath he was holding after he heard the sound of the door bell. He put the flannel away, took out his notebook, and went inside the back room.
“Come up further,” Draco directed him, taking his penis inside his mouth as Harry continued to fuck him with his fingers.
“Oh, and your clothes are washed. I left them on your bed. I also set out some extra clothes and pajamas for you.”
“This is a body heat draught. It’s still a formula I’m working on so it’s not named and labeled yet. I just have to get it to work longer, it only lasts for about 30 minutes. You can take it.” He handed the bottle to Harry, who took it while softy brushing his fingertips against Draco’s knuckles. They felt cold and smooth, making Draco’s insides shiver.
Draco took a bite of the pasta and closed his eyes; his memories being evoked by the flavors he was tasting. The simple pleasure of enjoying good food and not merely eating anything he could find to survive.
“Yeah, I know,” Harry felt the reality of the number settling in. “I still think about him. I wanted to get over him, but I still think about him.”
“I don’t want to take up any more of your time if you have an early day tomorrow,” Draco spoke, yawning and slightly stretching his body, his head now definitely touching Harry’s fingertips. Harry waited until Draco realized this and expected him to move away, but he didn’t.
“Ahh….fuck!” His breathing was more shallow now, his chest rising up and down, his eyes still closed.
Frida was a short, middle aged woman with big hair that was styled in a curly updo. She wore a long apron trimmed with lace over her dress, and high-heeled, pointed-toe shoes. She had large, expressive eyes and cheeks that still flushed despite the color being gone. Harry’s heart sank a bit at the thought of her passing away before her time; still attached to this type of work and environment.
“Room 108! Clear out room 108!” He heard the ward manager, Healer Modley, yell across the corridor. Harry ran toward the room, took out his wand and cleared everything to its proper place. He'd only had a small handful of emergency situations since being asked to cover the night shifts at this ward.
Harry repeated the same with his other leg. He took out a bottle of dittany from his case and poured some of the brown liquid onto his hand. He took his wand with the other  and cast a warming charm. Draco smiled; remembering his comment about the coldness of his fingers. Potter rubbed the dittany individually on each scar, taking his time and making sure that every one of them got covered.
“Yes, of course, sorry, yes this way.” Harry quickly stepped out, ready to lead Draco farther down the corridor. Draco followed him, leaving the bright green hospital bag on the bed.
Draco stared at him with bright, silver eyes, not knowing what he needed either. A wave of pain ran through his body once more, shooting down to his lower back. He gave a sharp, loud moan.
“You have a wonderful time, dear! I’ll see you tomorrow then!” Frida had a huge smile on her face and Draco was finally able to smile as well.
Draco shut the door behind him and sped towards the wastebasket near his desk. He threw up everything he’d eaten earlier and his stomach felt like it still needed to release more. He quickly wiped his mouth with his sleeve, turning to Frida, who was staring at him in shock and horror.
Draco looked at Potter, incredulously. The alcohol had loosened his tongue, and he reckoned it had done the same to Potter. He didn’t care anymore at this point.
“I hope you’re doing alright, Draco,” was the only thing he could manage to say, though his heart was bursting with a lot more words than that. He missed Draco terribly, and yearned for the days where they had longer conversations.
“Draco….Draco….the baby’s head.” Harry said in disbelief. “Give me your hand.” He took Draco’s hand and put it between his legs. “Do you feel that?”
“Can you please give him something stronger for the pain? Maybe let him sleep for awhile without feeling anything?”
“Its fine, Modley, thank you. I'm glad he was well enough to leave so quickly. Hopefully he won't get into trouble again.” Harry hoped that his sadness didn't lurk beneath his fake, cool exterior. He left the room; needing a private space to think.
Harry decided not to hold anything back. Draco was completely vulnerable in front of him and the least he could do was to show his sensitivity as well.
Draco sensed his apprehension. “No. Its fine.” He laid back on his pillow and covered his eyes with his arm. He'll soon leave and Potter will be the past – just like the rest of the men he's been meeting. He was no fool to just fall in love with the very first person who showed kindness to him.
“You’re so tight, Draco. Your body feels so good.” He kissed Draco again, then stared into his eyes, waiting for a cue to continue.
Harry’s heart clenched from pained desire. He ached to be closer to Draco, to his baby. It seemed like Draco just wanted to be his friend, going off by what he just told him about finding another bloke. He had to accept this. He took the plates and cups back to the kitchen. When he came back, Draco’s bare feet were on the table again. He was leaning his head back and closing his eyes.
” was written on a swirling rainbow liquid. When Harry picked it up, the colors danced around one another at a faster speed then slowly relaxed as he put it back down. He grinned slightly at the ingenuity and pure fun of it all.
Harry walked apprehensively towards the Leaky, not being able to fully enjoy the hopeful beauty of this year’s spring. The once a month hangouts with Ron gave his life a small bit of structure and consistency that he appreciated.
“Mr. Malfoy, what do you think about these? What is the difference?” He looked over straight away when he heard Draco’s name, still trying to be casual and not too obvious. He saw Draco lean closer to the man’s items and say something he couldn’t hear too well. He noticed a thin book under Draco’s arm. Extremely curious to see what kind of book this was, Harry grabbed a potion off the display he was closest to and stepped in line. He was standing perpendicular to the rest of the line but he had a much clearer view from this angle. Some of the letters were blocked by Draco’s hand, but Harry was able to make out the title: “
Harry came back to the shop the following day. Frida was busy helping customers in the queue, and he didn’t see Draco anywhere. He walked around browsing, trying not to bring too much attention onto himself.
Draco was breathing deeply with his eyes closed. Harry instinctively started to massage his lower back.
Harry’s heart broke at Draco’s statement. He didn’t know what to do, so he poured them both another drink.
“Hi Potter,” he said casually, watching Harry put the bottle down. He picked it up and opened the register. “Your godson having some troubles? There’s also the edible version of these where they think they’re just eating candy.” Harry was baffled on what Draco was talking about. He took the bottle and read the label:
“Harry….go faster.” Now it was all pleasure and he wanted more of what he was getting. He felt Harry down to the base, and gave a loud moan.
“I’m here.” He took Draco's hands and kissed them firmly. “I’m right here.” He kissed Draco’s forehead, his chest, his belly, feeling the firmness of it. Draco shook his legs, moaning loudly. Vasilia went immediately in front of them. She lifted the thin blanket that was covering his legs onto the top of his stomach, exposing everything. Harry saw that the dark pink flesh of his birth canal had what looked like a dark round object making an appearance right behind it.
Draco opened his eyes the following morning with a massive headache. Everything seemed a blur and he wondered where he was when he realised he was lying on a sofa. As soon as he saw the empty drinking glasses and a platter of half-eaten sandwiches on the coffee table, it all came crashing down on him. He and Potter had shagged last night. He felt the soreness from behind and stretched a bit to help himself gain some strength. There was a thick fleece blanket covering him. Potter was nowhere to be seen. A part of him ached for the affections they had given one another but the rational, ‘real Draco’ part of him knew he had to leave right away. He sat up, the blanket falling off his shoulders, and stood up slowly. His clothes were somewhat decently folded, laying on the arm of the sofa. Well, that was nice of Potter. Of course he was going to be kind and a good host because that’s just who he was. Draco warned himself not to take it as a sign of anything else. He quickly dressed himself and used the Floo to get home.
Draco took a deep breath and sighed loudly, slamming the register with more force than required. Maybe there was nothing to be afraid of. Maybe Potter might never come back again. Maybe he really did need
Draco had been walking back from the loo when he let himself collapse to the floor very close to his front door. Vasilia had told him to empty his bladder during their Fire-call. He took deep breaths as instructed, and kept his eyes closed to keep his fear at bay.
“You don’t even know, Frida. I did something incredibly stupid. It was fucking amazing, but it was stupid.”
“Good. Now stop trying to express your gratitude so much. I know you appreciate it and I’m not looking for extra recognition, okay? Don’t feel obligated to thank me for every little thing. I want you to feel like this is your home too. I needed a housemate anyway,” Harry said, winking and smiling.
potion was now behind the glass cabinet. The days went by normally, and though he was still hurt and disappointed that Potter never showed up, he knew time would heal his wounds. It was better this way. It was better than seeing him and getting his hopes up.
“That’s right,” Harry said, a bit more seriously. “You were out of the country for five years. You haven’t seen all the shite from
Harry took out the shopping bag from under his desk after Modley left. He set it aside the potion case and mentally prepared himself to see Draco again. He heard Hermione's voice in his head.
“Enjoying the novel as much as I am?” Draco said, smirking. He sat on an armchair next to the sofa Harry was on, putting up his feet on the coffee table.
It was a Tuesday evening and an exceptionally cold day. The air was so frigid, it ate down to the insides of your bones. The icy moisture covered the streets in a sheen, glass-like blanket. Draco was able to just barely make out images through his foggy windows. Frida had lit the fireplace with more flames than usual in one end of the room. The candles burned bright over their heads.
“Oh...no. Sorry. I was just thinking,” Harry put his glass down, starting to feel a bit drunk. “Surprised you’re not at your manor anymore. Thought maybe that’s something your parents would leave to you eventually.”
He came back the following evening, and this time there were only a couple of people browsing the shop. He walked up to the counter, where Draco was organizing some herb pouches.
“Why, you think so?” She said, blushing, her cheeks turning a darker shade of blue. “And you will be selling this potion in the shop once it is ready? It’s quite a rare thing, you know. Our neighbor had to hire a special brewer and it took them some time to find the right books.”
It went on for hours, but Harry never looked at the time. He kept his entire focus on Draco’s comfort and well-being. The pain was slowly escalating, and Harry didn’t even have to ask because he felt Draco’s voice and body shift drastically. He became more and more agitated and a lot more vocal.
“It was technically an accident. A product of...you know. I took the male conception potion I had brewed, you know, to test, and I test them on myself as you know. I didn’t read the directions thoroughly before using it. Now I know them well and have written them on all the bottles, so it’s perfectly legal-”
“She’s lovely, very special.” Draco finally looked back at Harry, returning his smile and setting down his drink. Harry instantly felt the absence of Draco’s soft hair that was touching his fingers. He wasn’t sure what was happening to him, but he wanted that back - and more. He moved his hand from the back of the sofa and onto Draco’s shoulder, and squeezed, keeping it there. “Well, I think it’s lovely that she can stay at her old place and keep busy with your shop. You did all that you know, it’s all your creation.”
Draco didn’t go to work the following day. He woke up nauseated, and vomited what felt like his entire insides out. He took a potion and went back to bed, sleeping most of the day.
Draco hadn't seen Potter for years. Seven to be exact. When he had received an owl about getting his name cleared with the Ministry, he hadn't expected it from the Saviour of the Wizarding World.
“Thanks Potter.” Draco sighed. He had nothing else to say. Harry Potter wasn't going to betray him and it didn't seem like he was the first transgender person he had met. This was a relief but Draco still felt embarrassed. He kept his head bent but eyed Potter from the side, who was looking at him intently. His bright, green eyes pierced into Draco's heart. He hadn't experienced an ounce of compassion from a wizard before. Potter's strong jaw and full lips were what Draco turned to next. He wondered if Potter had a boyfriend. He wondered if this boyfriend knew what a man he had. He wondered if the potions in his system were making him delirious as he was thinking about how perfect Potter was. Perfect men didn't exist and this man was once his enemy. He turned his head back, closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and was glad that he was somehow able to escape a potential rapist and killer tonight.
“Yes,” Malfoy said, looking up at him as he put the quill back. “We’re required to sign for controlled potions. You’re an auror, right?”
“Pain is normal, Harry. It’s hard to witness and even harder to experience, but believe it or not, it’s something you tend to forget over time. What you don’t forget, however, is who was there for you, what they did, and what they said.”
“Hello Draco.” He walked to the counter and set the flowers next to the register. Draco stood up, took out a small vase, and put the jasmines in some water. Harry’s attention immediately went to Draco’s stomach.
Was he doing this out of sympathy? Helping his former enemy because he faced discrimination and got sexually assaulted? He supposed another would think this was some sort of justice, given Malfoy's bullying during school and involvement in the war. But Harry knew his strength was in his empathy for others. Draco was a kid like he was during Hogwarts and greatly influenced by his family. Maybe he felt like he had no other choice. He remembered him lowering his wand when attempting to kill Dumbledore and not outing him to his aunt after his capture by the Snatchers. Still, their differences in upbringing and attitude may be too great for any sort of friendship. Harry took a deep breath and sighed. He had to remain professional. He would help Malfoy for the rest of his recovery and not get any more involved than that.
His image of Potter had shattered. It cut him deeply and he knew he would replay this scene in his mind over and over again. Potter always had this affect on him. Potter always lingered...
“Harry.” Draco started to stand up, holding onto the edge of the kitchen doorway. “I can walk now.” Harry stood behind him, keeping a hand on the small of his back.
“No problem. You care. You’re a nice man, Potter. You’ve always been. Makes me think….the bloke you end up romantically committing to…. he’ll be so lucky. I told you I spent time with quite a few men when living in Paris. No one compares to you.”
“But why? Just out of nowhere like this?” “No, I've been thinking about it for a while now,” Harry lied. “I was going to do it earlier this week, actually, but then Malfoy needed my help, so I decided that he'd be my last patient here.” “Wow....I didn't know, Harry. Well, I'll miss you, mate. Hope you visit us sometime.” “I will,” Harry smiled genuinely. He didn't think he'd ever step inside the hospital again though.
“For….not visiting you as often. And I know you said I don’t owe you anything, but Draco, I can’t pretend what happened didn’t happen, and it doesn’t feel right not to talk to you.”
“You know I’ve been going to Malfoy’s shop. Well, I haven’t gone in weeks, but I visited often at one point.”
Harry felt the sorrow and helplessness in his voice. “Well I think your store is brilliant, Malfoy. You create all of it yourself, thinking of special brews and recipes for children and animals, even. I’ve become quite obsessed with it.”
Draco looked down at his body. He was wearing a loose, light blue cotton shirt and trousers. Panic started to form in his stomach and his chest. He had been stripped naked with no memory of it. He looked up at the man standing over him and recognized him straight away. It had been eleven years since he had seen Harry Potter but the lightening bolt scar, round glasses, and messy black hair were unmistakable. He grabbed and pulled two fistfuls of his own hair, covering his eyes with both arms in extreme humiliation. This had been his worst nightmare: to be exposed, defenseless, and vulnerable in a medical environment where complete strangers would touch, stare, probe, and judge his naked body. To be discovered and outed in all of wizarding society because they would tell others, even just one person, that ex-death eater, Draco Malfoy, was really a “woman.” And to his luck, the “hero” of that world, who was his school enemy, now happened to be a healer who would witness his mortifying condition.
Ron’s mouth dropped. “Holy shit…..” He covered his mouth to avoid saying anything anyone might hear. Harry nodded and looked down.
Draco shed tears hearing this, looking down at his baby, who was now being wrapped inside a cotton blanket by Peter.
“I didn’t know that was because of headaches, mate. I remember you said you were ill, but didn’t know what.”
“Oh! No, I use a washing machine. It’s a muggle device. You just throw in the clothes with the detergent and it does the work for you. It does a more thorough job than a cleaning charm, it’s great,” Harry said, reassuringly. Draco looked up, with a half smile. “Thank you. They’re so filthy, as you can imagine-”
“Here, I got it,” Harry said, giving him a plate. “Draco...I’m curious. You have a midwife that you like?”
Harry was packing the potion bottles and salves inside his case when Modley stepped in his office. “I'm going to take Miss Malfoy upstairs, Harry.”
“I got you, I’m right here,” Harry said, rocking Draco’s body against his. “You can do this, you’re going to do great.”
“Are you insane??” Frida sounded horrified. She circled around him, her body floating ferociously around. “You go and have a good time! Use those smart brains of yours in your work, but don’t you dare over-analyze this! You accept his invitation and try to have a good time! You deserve it, dear.”
The old man nodded. “Sometimes, you have to convince them they are worthy of being loved. You know, most of us don’t think we are. We can miss a great deal out on life with a belief like that.” The old wizard blew out a large ring of smoke, looking up at the sky.
Potter slightly raised his brows and looked to his right, pretending to notice something outside the window.
Harry stretched his hand, waiting to shake Draco's, but Draco didn't look up. That goddaman belt. And those hands. The nails. The knuckles. His legs, which were standing a bit apart, thin, yet muscular. And those toned arms, covered in dark red cloth, hugging his shape.
He was sitting up and looking down when Potter came back inside. He had light pink scars all over his thighs and lower stomach.
Harry quickly undressed, and Draco rubbed his hands all over his toned and tanned arms and chest. He was gorgeous and Draco wanted all of him. When his jeans came off, Draco grabbed his pants and pulled them down, freeing his desperate erection. Harry's penis was already leaking.
Harry checked the clock on the right side of the wall. It was a few minutes before eight. He also noticed Frida organizing potion bottles in a section called “
Draco gave her a weak smile. He sat down at his desk, looking over his inventory for the following month.
He felt sick to his stomach. Draco must've panicked about something. Harry was naïve to think that this was going to be the start of a new relationship. He hated that he would even entertain a conclusion like that. Besides that, there was something else. He had broken a very, very serious ethical code in his field: getting involved with a patient. Having sex with a patient.
Harry kept kissing his face, whispering words of encouragement. He looked up to Vasilia. He saw Peter leaving the room.
Draco looked down, frowning. Potter would have to touch his filthy clothes. Clothes that haven’t even seen a cleaning charm in months, much less soap and water.
This was not how he wanted tonight to go. His breast pocket was full of jasmines and he could smell them all the way home.
Harry realized this was the Frida who had previously owned this shop as a fabric store. And she was still around - as a ghost.
Harry kept his eyes on Draco's as he completely went inside him. They were both breathing hard and Draco swallowed, saying, “Move. Move slowly.”
“I don’t think so. My hair is an awful mess. Maybe I’ll shave it off and start over with it.” He didn’t miss the slight frown on Harry’s face.
“I can close the store tonight if you want to leave early, you know I wouldn’t mind. Promise me you’ll go and not think too much.”
He quickly turned himself ahead, to avoid being noticed. Malfoy started to walk towards the counter, and went into the back room. When he came out, his hands were empty and his sleeves were rolled up. He started to help Frida ring up customers. Before Harry had a chance to see what potion he had taken, Malfoy looked straight at him. Harry slowly walked forward.
Draco sat down at his desk, his book in front of him. “I’m pregnant, Frida. She confirmed it. I’m almost three months along.”
“Just tell me Ron, I don’t know.” Harry smiled and kept his eyes on his best friend, happy to have a conversation that got him this excited.
“I'm sorry. Its non of my business. Put on one of those and I'll see you in a bit,” Harry said, walking away to a small adjacent room.
“You feel incredible, Draco, you have no idea. You're so tight and warm and wet and I'm afraid I'm not going to last long.”
Draco pulled his knees slowly towards his chest once more, helping Harry to move. He felt more lube around his rim and Potter started to pull on his cock, which gave relief to the pain that was now dissipating.
“Alright so Malfoy has a potion shop. So he’s busy and out of trouble, right? Hopefully?” Harry was trying to find some positivity in this news. He hadn’t thought about Draco Malfoy in years and this put a funny feeling inside of him. Mostly curiosity and interest.
“Don’t cry, Harry. Please don’t cry.” Harry blinked his eyes, more tears falling down. He held Draco’s head with both his hands, touching his forehead to his. He gently kissed him on the lips. “You’re almost free, Draco. You’re almost free.” While still facing him, Draco grabbed Harry’s wrists and gave another push, his screaming deep with primal sounds. He groaned hard, his face wet, and finally felt some relief below his body.
“Ewww daddy, that’s so gross!!” Jasmine said, covering her mouth and nose with her hands to show disgust. As the old wizard showed Jasmine the bottle, Harry walked up to Draco, giving him a kiss on the lips. He took a small branch of jasmines out of his pocket and put it behind Draco’s ear, lovingly looking at him.
“Frida, please. He was absent for two whole months, now sporadically comes in with flowers he’s picked on his way over here. I’m not saying he’s unkind, but none of those actions make me special. He still needs potions, obviously, and the jasmines are just….they’re just…” Draco rested his head against his arm, closing his eyes in exhaustion.
Harry pulled off Draco's pants completely and put his mouth on his penis. It was two inches long and felt so perfect between Harry's lips. He licked underneath it and heard Draco moan loudly. He wanted to see him orgasm. He wanted to witness his vulnerability.
Potter massaged the liquid into Draco's legs. He was pressing harder this time, but with the same detailed attention to every tender line. Draco closed his eyes and enjoyed every single second of it. He had decided that Potter's hands were his new favourite thing. Potter took out something else from the drawer and continued working.
Harry cut off Draco’s bit of rambling. “Draco, I don’t care about legalities right now. So, this was an accident?”
“Yes?” He opened his eyes and saw Potter’s face just a few inches away from his. He felt heat radiating from the other man’s skin, which he so desperately wanted to touch.
Harry Potter hadn’t come back in a while. Draco thought about him every now and then (especially when he missed the smell of jasmines) but he kept his mind focused on his job and preparing for his baby. He had a crib set up in his bedroom and a small drawer of clothes and nappies.
“Oh, my dear. What are you going to do? It’s Harry Potter’s, isn’t it?” She asked with care and concern.
Draco felt defenseless at the absence of Potter's body. They were about the same height and weight but Potter's protective and gracious nature had made him feel so safe and secure.
"I’ve been getting these awful headaches. Makes me want to scratch out my own eyeballs, it’s so fucking intense.”
“I need to remove his clothes, Modley. The cuts have to get mended. Please get some dittany.” Modley directed the other healer for the potion, took out his wand, and pointed it at Draco's waist. “Quickly, Potter.” Modley's urgent and panicked voice instantly ended Harry's hesitation in stripping down his former enemy. Draco's belt was cut as they both worked down his trousers all the way to his ankles.
Harry walked to the main office on the first floor to give his official resignation. 'Personal reasons' was all they needed to hear. He also walked through the emergency ward one last time before exiting the building. He stood right in front of Room 108, his heart heavy with pain and with yearning. “Take care, Draco.” He whispered to himself and made his way toward the apparation point at the end of the hospital.
"The khed is almost out, Drakon!” He felt one of Vasilia’s hands massage some sort of oil around the rim of his canal, and the other hand put pressure on his bottom.
“Don’t be scared, baby.” Draco couldn't believe what Harry had just called him. He brought his arms over his head, grabbing Harry’s hair. He needed to feel that hair. That wild, free, and untamed hair and the brave man who owned it. He loved Harry so much. He gave another strong push, not stopping, even though it felt like fire was stretching him wide open. He screamed so loud, his vocal cords felt like they just cracked open out of his throat.
“I'm sorry,” Harry said, through the shocked looked on his face. “That was a bit patronizing. You're not a child, you're a grown man.”
That moment, Draco walked in, carrying Jasmine in his arms. She was eating a bag of the ‘candy’ version of
“I don't have one either. I haven't had the chance to develop any sort of attraction pattern. Most of the time, it never gets far enough. Either I get nervous and back out, or when they know about, you know, my 'identity,' they back out themselves.”
“Weeks. I ignored it at first, thinking it was no big deal. Then they got worse and worse to the point where I wasn’t showing up to work, remember that?”
Harry started to palm Draco’s erect cock, his thumb on the head. Draco knew he was completely undone.
“It was invented by my grandfather. I didn’t know him but this quadrupled the family’s wealth I was told,” Harry exhaled sharply, as if to laugh.
Modley walked in a few hours later. “Harry, I thought we were going to have lunch- what are you doing?” “I'm going to resign, Modley.” Harry was packing his books, potions, clothes, and a few personal items into a small trunk, shrinking each item to fit everything. He used a scouring charm to clean the room. Modley still stood there shocked, not saying anything for a long time.
“Get off me!!” Draco yelled, pulling himself higher onto the mattress as the man's face dropped from pleasure to shock.
“Draco! Hello dear!” Frida spoke with loud excitement as Draco entered the shop, an hour after getting to his flat.
When I heard them sit down on the armchairs not far from my own, I turned around again, breathing deeply to build up the courage to ask what I've been trying not to think about.
“Oh is that right? You might have,” he said casually. He sat next to Harry. “It’s better that we talk sitting side by side, don’t you think? Otherwise you might think I have better wisdom than you do.”
He turned around and walked toward his bed. His steps were a little faster this time and Harry watched him carefully. Draco felt strong, electric pain across his legs and abdomen, and grabbed the edge of the side-table with both hands; letting himself fall slowly on both knees. He felt Harry's body behind him again.
He took a deep breath and loudly sighed. “My father doesn’t want anything to do with me. My mother is torn, I think. I sometimes get letters from her, asking to visit, but I don’t want to. I’m just as angry with him as he is with me.”
“No harm in asking. I play godfather, uncle, and big brother these days.” Harry smiled, nodded his head in thanks, and turned to leave.
Harry left to look for something he was hoping Draco had. He looked at the neatly organized potions and balms and found a bottle of oil labeled, “
Harry nodded. “Yes, that makes complete sense.” He looked away, playing with his scarf. “I was in the area, and just thought...it’s a cold day, and…”
Harry looked at her for some answers, and she just shook her head. Harry didn’t know how Draco could last so long, it felt like days had gone by.
This put a big smile on Harry’s face. “Thanks, mate,” he said, taking Ron’s hand and patting him on the back.
“Uh, yeah. That’s...that’s a good idea. About the candy one. Yes. He’ll like that, yeah.” He put his hands in his pockets, avoiding Draco’s eyes. There weren’t many people now left in the store. Draco came out from the back room, with a new bottle to give to Harry. He bagged it, took his money, and Harry left, feeling mortified.
“Hello Genevieve, dear! Nice to see you again!” Frida’s excited greeting made Harry quickly look forward, his heartbeat getting faster. As Genevieve walked to the counter, Harry stood in his place, trying to keep steady on his feet. He was the last one left and felt exposed and vulnerable.
An elderly wizard with a long grey beard and a violet pointed hat stepped outside the door just as Harry was about to walk in. The old man gave him a small smile and a quick wink, walking past him with a black paper bag in his hands. Harry realized he had been holding his breath and sighed slowly. He was strangely reminded of Dumbledore. He straightened himself up, patted down his coat with both hands, and walked inside the shop.
Harry withdrew his hands from Draco's body. “I didn't want names. Sorry, Draco. That came out very wrong. I just know it gets lonely when you don't know anyone else like yourself. I've been through that more than once. I was trying to empathize-”
Draco held his breath in surprise. He stood up slowly, waddling his way towards the corridor. “I’m coming.” He unlocked the door with his wand and saw a disheveled looking Harry Potter carrying a large paper bag and the same type of white box from a week ago.
“I agree with that,” Harry said, feeling much more comfortable now. So far, he had no reason to think badly of Malfoy.
His thoughts were interrupted by the ardent voice of a woman behind the cashier’s table as he slightly flinched; the decibel of her voice causing his headache to throb a bit.
“Hi, Potter. Thank you for these. How can I help you?” He was happy that his tone sounded genuinely friendly without a single sound of the resentment he felt a few months ago.
“That’s alright, Draco,” Harry reassured him. “They’ve probably done this so many times and seen so many bodies. Nobody is judging you.”
Ron paused, slowly sipping his drink and waited a while to answer back to Harry after putting his mug down.
Draco was sitting up when Peter entered the room. His legs were bent and Vasilia was sitting behind him, squeezing his hands. He had just started to push.
I think I stopped listening at the point of them repeating the incident as if I hadn't heard it the first time.
Harry put his drink down on the table and sat up straight, a little closer to Draco than before. “No, you definitely aren’t.” He stretched out his arm on top of the sofa behind Draco’s head; the tips of his fingers millimeters away from Draco’s hair. Draco didn’t shift or move at all, and kept nursing the glass in his hand.
“Yes, but not in the potions department. Unless I’m making the arrest,” Harry said smiling. He wasn’t sure how Malfoy would take that, but he looked perfectly calm.
It was a Wednesday evening and a slow night for business. Around half past seven, Draco heard the front bell as Harry walked in. He was looking very flushed and carried a large handful of jasmines. Draco’s heart clenched at the sight of him. It had been so long.
Harry woke one Saturday morning from a dream that had felt so realistic. He had discovered an egg on the edge of a field that was shaking and trembling. As he got closer, he saw that a baby chick was struggling to break free. He leaned down, and did everything he could to help save it’s life. He gently and carefully chipped away pieces of the shell, trying not to hurt the baby. The voice of the chick got louder and louder and he saw its yellow fluff finally appear. When he woke up, opening his eyes, he didn’t remember if the chick had survived or not. He was hung-up on the dream all morning and the feeling of dread stayed inside him as he made breakfast. He remembered Draco as he put the kettle on for tea. He had replayed the evening of the foot massage inside his head over and over again since. He thought maybe he should pick up some croissants and surprise Draco again. He knew that he was likely at home.
“He has a big problem with me liking men. Was very clear with expectations about me marrying a witch and having an heir and all that and I’m a huge disappointment.” He looked at Harry, making eye contact. “I’ve always been a disappointment, Potter. I’ll never impress my father so better to just stay away.”
As Frida and Potter were finishing up, Draco went behind the register and took out his old flannel. He dabbed it with some cleaning oil and started to polish the wooden counter.
“I understand, lad. It’s alright. Your baby is going to be so wonderful and so lucky to have a parent like you. And of course, their Aunt Frida,” she said smiling.
“Draco...you’re so brave. You’re so strong. I could never do this, Draco. Look at you. You’ve created a little human.” He kissed his temple once more, moving to his shoulder, then the back of his neck. Draco’s breathing was getting more erratic. Harry ran his fingernails up and down on Draco’s sides, to help calm and soothe him.
“This is nice of you, Potter.” He opened the box and saw a variety of sweets and cakes - mostly chocolate croissants. He smiled widely to himself.
“Stop it, get off me you savage! You fucking monster!” The man let go of Draco's genitals and punched him hard, blackening his vision. Draco was terrified and wasn't able to move. He willed himself to apparate, to do anything to get out of this. He wanted to scream and cry but knew that nobody would hear him. In the darkness, he felt his body being cut and slashed and finally screamed with all his might at the very top of his lungs.
“Ah, so that’s what’s paining you. I’ve made the mistake of letting the one I love go. You know how they say to set the bird free when you love them?”
“Thank you,” Draco whispered, getting up on his feet. He leaned over his desk, trying to regain some composure. The book he had been using for the male conception potion was still open to the page he’d left it on. He hadn’t touched it in all this time. His eyes scanned the writing, over and over again.
The loud sirens of the emergency ward pulled Harry out of his thoughts and quickly out of his chair; knocking over a large coffee mug and a box of old case files. He almost slipped and fell running over the folders before grabbing the doorknob to steady himself.
Draco sat at his desk, intently keeping his focus on the pages of his notebook. He picked up a quill, a small grey bottle across from him, and continued to write. He heard a soft creaking sound of the door just a few feet away. Frida floated inside the small room, holding her apron over her arm.
“Draco,” he whispered softly. “Focus on my voice. Breathe with me. Let’s breathe together. The baby will be here soon.”
“Northern Ireland. If you don’t see me ever again, it means I’ve found what I’ve been looking for. If you do see me, please interrupt my thoughts. There shouldn’t be any secrets kept in this world. It doesn’t do anyone any good. Good night!”
“Thank you. For everything. I couldn’t have done this without you.” His eyes were starting to close. He still tried keeping them open and Harry saw the struggle.
“No, no,” Harry shook his head. “The healer confirmed it wasn’t that. She said it’s from stress and pressure. Not getting enough sleep, all that stuff.”
“Draco,” he whispered, softly rubbing his lower back. Draco's eyes were closed as he willed himself to get back up again. Pushing on his palms, he slowly stood up and Harry stepped away. He sat on the bed, took a deep breath, and looked up at Potter.
The end of March brought in longer days, birds flying in pairs, and the presence of fragrant flowers blooming in all their colors.
Harry looked around the shop as Frida and Jasmine went to the back room. He noticed a familiar wizard looking at a display.
Harry stepped inside Draco's room in the morning with two cups of tea and toast. He noticed the bed was empty and perfectly made with no sign of anyone being there recently. As he set down the tray on the side-table, his mind went to last night. Looking at this highly polished and sterile piece of hospital furniture that Draco slept in for the past few days, one would not think that it had provided a place of such passion, lust, and even....love between two people.
Harry immediately realized his mistake. He should not have questioned someone who hadn’t felt the comfort of warm water on his body in years.
“I need…..I need the baby out, please!” Draco was on the verge of tears. Harry was getting increasingly desperate to stop his pain.
Harry grabbed it between his fingers, stroking him, as his other hand went up to one of his nipples. “This is ok?”
“That’s the past, Malfoy. Everyone deserves a second chance. And you’ve really turned yourself around. I wish you could see yourself through my eyes. I’m being honest.”
Harry glanced down and up again, keeping Draco's stare. He wasn't frowning, but didn't smile either. He kept his gaze and didn't show any nervousness. His eyes burned Draco's, and the fiery emeralds behind those glasses sped up Draco's heartbeat and made his palms sweat.
“Draco, did you hear that?” Harry's innocent, excited voice put a bit of happiness inside Draco’s heart. He was exhausted, still in pain, but Harry kept him going. He held onto him for dear life as he took another deep breath and with all his might and strength, groaned loudly as he felt the stretching get even more extreme.
“I’m not going to go inside, Drakon. Just from the outside. Okay, my dear.” She stroked his legs in comfort as she gently pried open his knees. A small light at the end of her wand helped her see Draco’s opening. She sighed.
Harry was finally able to release the breath he was holding. He filled his left palm with the oil and rubbed his hands together to warm up the grease. Draco’s toes were cold, so he squeezed them between his hands, releasing his warmth into Draco’s skin.
Ron’s chewing slowed down. “Alright….I think you need to go see him again before you ruin any chance you have. Eight weeks is a long time, mate. He might already be over you by now.”
section while he was helping a family find suitable balms for skin rashes. Frida was working through the queue at the register. After the family picked out their potions, Draco headed towards the only customer left on the floor - Harry Potter. He casually stood next to him with his hands inside his pockets, interested at what Potter was looking at.
Harry returned to the store the following day carrying a handful of jasmine sprigs. He was a bit relieved to see that there weren’t too many people here at the moment, and saw Draco sitting behind the counter, reading a book. When he spotted Harry, he put down the book immediately, the cover facing down. He stood up and took out his white flannel. By now, Harry understood why Draco always did this when he saw him.
Harry felt a strong urge to extend this conversation. The curiosity he felt since walking into the shop was still burning brightly inside him.
“Uh, no, I don't think so. There's a rule against dating people you work with. And he's straight,” Harry laughed quietly.
Draco felt himself getting warmer. He wasn't sure if it was anger or the fact that Potter was finally retaliating.
"It's two doors down from Magical Menagerie. Mum would always go when we were kids. The poor witch who owned the place died suddenly of appendicitis a few years ago. The space had been empty until Malfoy moved in."
“I fucked Harry Potter. He fucked me, to be exact. Sorry to be so blunt and crude, Frida, I’m still recovering from the whole ordeal.” He downed an entire bottle of hangover potion in one gulp, squinting his eyes tightly from the strong, bitter taste.
“You’re enough. You’re better than most.” Draco started to rub the top part of his belly. Harry was watching him, captivated.
“It’s fine, Potter, I don’t mind.” Draco double checked the current bubble placement and sank into the tub a little deeper, his chin almost touching the surface of the water. Harry continued to apply more of the potion onto Draco’s hair, covering it entirely with the gooey liquid. Then Harry used the wooden comb, which easily passed through the strands. He rinsed off the excess grease using an empty jar on the other side of the tub to pour some of the bath water onto Draco’s head. He used his fingers to arrange the hair in place and Draco felt his scalp tingle at the sensation. It had to be because of the potion, he thought. He was thankful he was underwater because he didn’t want Harry to see the goosebumps running down his skin.
“I admire that confidence. Its hard to accept something about yourself that the world judges you for. It takes courage. Trans people are incredibly courageous. To live everyday of their lives in a body they feel is wrong for them.”
“What the bloody hell happened to you? Why were you at St. Mungo's?” Ron asked as Harry sat down across from him at the table inside the Leaky Cauldron. It was a Friday just after sunset and it had been especially sunny for a cold, frosty day in January. Harry took a deep breath and sighed loudly, running his fingers through his hair, which made it stand up more than usual. He had dark circles under his eyes from lack of sleep and exhaustion.
Harry pressed his warm, smooth lips on Draco’s wet ones. He slowly pushed his tongue inside, and Draco immediately took it with his own. He moaned in pleasure and disbelief. He was kissing Harry Potter and couldn’t get himself to stop. He grabbed the collars of Harry’s denim jacket, pushing them back.
“Harry, I have to tell you something. You might get very angry with me, and I accept that. Please understand that I was scared. I’m still scared. I’ve been in love with you for years. I didn’t need to get drunk for that.”
“I didn't come here to fight with you, Malfoy.” His tone was equally calm and courteous. Draco wasn't insensitive enough not to catch the slight twinge of sadness either. Potter sounded emotionally exhausted, almost like he'd given up every fight left in him.
“Before he attacked me, he grabbed me inappropriately and called me a freak,” he said quickly and quietly. He saw Potter visibly swallow at this. “Did he do anything else?” Harry asked cautiously.
Potter slowly took the parchment from him, gently adding his own name right next to Draco's. Draco was staring at Potter's hands. Rough and covered in scars that looked like they used to be blisters. Knuckles protruding largely with short, clean fingernails. His every movement was refined, even if he looked battered.
This took tremendous pressure off of Harry who was extremely curious to see everything. He walked towards a table with two young children and a man holding up a bright pink bottle, talking to a woman next to him. The sign above the display read, “
Harry positioned himself behind him, putting a hand on his shoulder. He looked at Malfoy's bare feet and felt the blood rush to his groin again. His nails were trimmed very short and his toes were long with knobby knuckles. They were elegant yet masculine and moved on the floor with careful determination. Harry let him go completely.
“Here, let me show you,” Harry said, gently taking it from Draco’s hand and popping off the cork. He put a generous amount onto his hand and smeared it on top of Draco’s head. The contact made Draco jump and his eyes grew slightly wider for an instant.
“Yes,” Harry didn’t waste a second. Draco knew he was just as pissed as he was when his trousers came off too. He started to fondle with Draco’s front button and zipper.
“No clue, mate. There’s another potion shop a bit closer than Jiggers. I just found out about it, I can’t believe I’ve never even noticed it before. Apparently, it's been open for months. Henderson told me about it last week and I didn’t even care enough to tell you but I should. Guess who fucking owns it, just guess!” Ron’s voice got louder with a strange excitement Harry hadn’t heard since he announced his engagement to Hermione.
“I over-reacted. I apologize,” Draco said, still looking down. He was too embarrassed to face Potter.
"I found her!” Frida squealed excitedly. “Annnnnd…..I even owled her for you! She was so thrilled to hear from me, though I broke her sweet little heart when I told her I now haunted this store, but she is very much looking forward to meeting you, lad! Her Floo address is in the letter she sent.” Frida handed Draco a rolled up parchment that smelled faintly of rose and frankincense.
Modley entered the room with a patient file in his hands. Harry's heart sank. Something wasn't right.
Draco rubbed his eyes with the bottom of his palms. He wanted to be swallowed up into the floor, disappearing from everyone and everything.
When Harry left, Draco blinked the heaviness from his eyes. Tears ran down to his chin and he picked up the jasmines, using them to wipe his face.
Harry nodded, placing his hands on the counter. “If you ever need anything, please let me know. I mean it.” He looked right at Draco. His green eyes were shining with compassion and a bit of sadness. Draco nodded.
“I want to get inside my bed," Draco frailly whimpered. As soon as they got him there, Vasilia started to check him again.
Potter was dressed in jeans and a white t-shirt that fit him much tighter around his body than those hospital scrubs.
Harry hesitated before saying the next words. “I really do….you make me feel a lot of things, Draco. I can’t stop coming in to see you. You’ve got me all….all….wound up. Inside.” Harry’s voice was soft and sultry, and Draco had to close his eyes to keep himself steady. Not only was he drunk on brandy and whiskey, but Potter’s words were also intoxicating him. That and his hand on his shoulder. Draco knew he should pull away, but he couldn’t. He felt himself getting warmer.
Draco held the rim of the bin with both hands as more liquid came out of him, the smell acidic and foul. Having to smell his own vomit was making the whole situation worse.
There was hardly anyone in the shop tonight. Draco took this opportunity to finalize some notes on the male conception potion. He worked right at the counter by the register, looking at the clock often. Time seemed to be going slow. They were still several hours away from closing. The sound of the store door bell took him away from his writing abruptly; the quietness of the shop made it sound louder than usual. When he looked up, he saw Harry Potter walking in, gently shutting the door behind him and loosening his thick scarf. Draco shut his notebook, put his quill aside, and grabbed his white flannel.
“I don't know anyone trans, no. I don't know anyone gay either. I meet strangers every week, and none of them stick around long enough for any meaningful relationship. Friendship or otherwise.
“AHHHHHHH….faaaaa,” he shouted loudly in pleasure, digging his fingernails deeper into the sofa’s fabric. He felt the splattering of his cum all over his stomach and chest.
“I didn't expect this.” Draco continued unwrapping the rest of the packaged tissue paper and unfolded three pairs of boxer-brief pants. A grey one with green stripes, a black one, and a white one with yellow golden snitches embroidered all over them.
“Let me see, Drakon.” She used a few spells on different areas of his body. Harry didn’t know why and for what. He wasn’t sure if he was allowed to be here, either. He leaned down to speak to Draco.
Draco started missing work more frequently, having trouble being on his feet for long periods of time. He constantly had to urinate as the baby was pressing on his bladder, and was only able to eat bit by bit. He grew restless inside his flat all day and took long walks out at the local park. He found new books to read and new journals to fill.
“Next customer,” Malfoy muttered casually; a vast difference from Frida’s loud enthusiasm. Harry slowly made his way towards him, using every inch of his strength to keep his cool. When Malfoy looked up from the money register, they immediately made eye contact. Malfoy stared at him with melancholic intensity, barely blinking. Despite his sharp features, his face had a softness to it that made him look almost innocent.
He stepped in his living room, holding a small bottle in his hand. “I had to take a hangover potion, do you wa-”
“Yes, fine. Sorry,” he said, slightly shaking his head. “Thank you.” He walked immediately toward the bathtub as soon as he took the towel; in order to avoid further questions from Harry.
Harry locked the door behind the small office. He leaned over the desk and touched his groin. He was internally sweating the entire time while rubbing the potion onto Draco's legs. He knew he'd gotten very hard and it took all the power in him to keep a calm, undisturbed face. Draco had well-toned, lightly muscular legs with soft blond hair that covered them moderately. And when he took his shirt off, he thought he would have to run out. His broad shoulders, round biceps, and forearms covered with the same blond hair kept Harry staring. His eyes had gone to his nipples once more, hard again and the same shade of pink as his lips. Draco looked very upset and Harry sensed his guilt. He felt ridiculously protective and like he would do anything to stop his grief.
Harry backed up just a bit and went in all the way again, watching Draco close his eyes from pleasure. “You feel amazing, Potter, keep moving.”
Harry was mesmerized by this encounter with Draco Malfoy. Leaving it behind made him feel strangely empty and somber.
“Looks clean, Malfoy,” he softly muttered. Draco looked up, only moving his eyes. He kept his body frozen and held tightly onto the rag.
“Has anyone...ever….have you ever witnessed...” He hoped he was being obvious now in what he was trying to say.
“Maybe I don't understand completely, but I empathize. I worked at London Friend, an LGBT center, before coming back to the wizarding world a couple of years ago. I met and talked with all sorts of people.”
“Hey Frida.” His voice was hoarse and pained. He walked straight inside the back room, Frida floating behind him.
When the last customer had left, Frida leaned over the counter, smiling, as Draco counted money from the register.
Harry nodded, “I can understand.” He still stood there, looking around as if he was searching for something.
“I'm gay too. I met this savage at a gay bar. I stupidly went to his home, and like almost every man I meet, he got angry and called me a freak at what he discovered. Didn't give me a chance to explain.”
Draco was staring at him. Harry realized he had to just say it, loud and clear. “I’m gay, Malfoy.” He washed down his food with a big shot of brandy, not meeting Draco’s eyes.
“I’m so happy for you. This baby is going to love you more than anyone else in this whole wide world. That’s so special and so beautiful.”
“So...” Harry began. “I just need your signature on this statement. At the end of it. You can read it through."
“Mmmhmmmmm…..ahhhhhhhhh!!” He stood up on his knees and Harry went in front of him, holding his hands tightly. “Harry…..I’m so tired. I can’t do this. I can’t do this.” Tears ran down Draco’s face. “Take the baby…..if I don’t make it, take the baby. Please. Tell everyone it’s yours.” Harry’s heart was silently breaking to hear these words.
Draco was still looking at the bottle, turning it around a few times and watching the dark brown, oily liquid gliding against the glass.
“I know we've sworn an oath but we have to make sure to keep his identity between us. Nobody else at the hospital could know. He's very anxious about it.”
Draco slowly stretched as he opened his eyes to the dimly lit room. He heard footsteps coming close toward him and saw the outline of Harry Potter turning on the lights just a bit brighter. He smiled, saying, “How are you feeling?”
“Hello Draco,” he said, giving him a shy smile. Draco started polishing the bottles more aggressively.
“Mr. Malfoy told me last time that this is the more diluted version of the red fever potion. It worked wonderfully for my niece and I think it will suit your son,” the woman explained to the man with the children; who looked like they were his son and daughter. Not paying attention to the conversation, the children excitedly pointed and squealed at all the bright bottles, some of them swirling with gold and silver.
“All cleared!” He yelled back toward Modley and the other healer wheeling in a patient who was unconscious and almost entirely covered in blood. Harry swallowed, took a deep breath, and let himself feel the courage that was needed to help save this person's life. When they got inside the room, Harry's mouth dropped at his discovery of the patient's identity.
Harry composed himself, wiping his face off with a flannel from the side table. He kissed Draco’s lips, then the baby’s head.
“Frida is always there. She never leaves the place, even when I tell her to take a break. She insists that ghosts don’t tire.”
“I miss you all the time.” Harry said, kissing him again. “Let’s go to dinner tonight. Can Frida watch Jaz?”
He threw the empty bottle on the floor and curled into a foetal position. He felt warm and hot and took deep, long breaths to calm his restless heart.
“I understand,” Draco quickly replied before any of them changed their minds. “We agreed. Less talk, more fucking. But this is important and it's something I tell all my partners.” It was half a lie as Draco hadn't had a sexual partner in a very long time. He'd never admit that to a man like this one.
“Let's look at them,” Harry said as Draco put both his legs up on the bed and languidly started pulling down on the loose hospital trousers he was wearing.
“Please,” Draco moaned into Harry’s mouth. Harry gently pulled down Draco’s briefs, stood up, and took off his own. Harry’s erection caught Draco’s attention at once. He gently took it in one of his hands, giving him a tender squeeze and pull. Harry re-situated himself back between Draco’s legs, his head falling onto Draco’s chest. He sighed out a deep moan.
“Thank you for this.” He walked up to Frida and started to pay for the pellets. Draco watched his movements. Potter’s hair was the same as it had always been: wild, free, and untamed. His hands had shortly trimmed nails and large knuckles; neat and rugged at the same time. His kindness pulled at Draco’s heartstrings, and he was painfully reminded of why he couldn’t stop thinking about this man, even in his exile. Now he was back in his life, and made aware of what he was missing. Lonely and friendless, Frida was all Draco had, and though he was grateful for her, he yearned for a deep connection with a man like Potter. He hated having to face the reality of what he was missing.
“Hangover potion? Well, well, well…..someone had an exciting night!” Frida was smiling and gesturing dramatically, nudging Draco for more information.
“Eat as much as you can. Slowly. The healer said it’ll take time until your system adjusts to eating normal-sized portions. Try everything, but I don’t expect you to finish it. I won’t get angry, I promise,” he said smiling.
He took out a cotton wad from the drawer and continued smearing the oil around Draco's eye. He put some on the other as well.
“Well, thank you for this,” Harry said, holding up the potion bottle. “How much can I give you for it?”
Draco froze. Potter hadn't touched his stomach yesterday. And he was hoping he wasn't going to hand him the potions and leave again. He let out the breath he was holding. He slowly pushed down his pants, stopping just above his pubic hairline. He also took off his shirt, feeling hot all of a sudden, and exposed his bare chest again in front of Potter. Potter examined his skin, purposely avoiding his chest, with the same serious look on his face.
“It looks great,” Harry said smiling. “You have nice hair, Malfoy, I’m jealous.” He smirked and got up to put everything away. “Dinner is ready, you should come down.”
“I’m going to have to, Frida. This potion needs to be heated again in two hours when I add in the stinging nettle root.”
Harry picked up his daughter and she sat around his shoulders. She held him around his neck and bounced joyfully, enjoying her ride to
“I brought dinner, and more pastries.” Draco took the box from Harry, and gestured to him to come inside.
When Draco got to his room, his clothes were laid out perfectly on the duvet. They smelled like lavender and felt soft and clean. His frayed blazer jacket, threadbare undershirt, battered trousers, and old socks with various sizes of holes in each one looked odd against the plush duvet. The elastic band on his cotton boxer-briefs was so damaged, it barely stayed up his body most of the time. In reality, every piece of his clothing was absolute trash and not worth trying to save or mend. But Harry had treated them with such enormous respect, as if it had a lot of value. Draco felt a lump forming in his throat at the man’s consideration. He eyed the other clothes next to them. They were Potter’s, he could tell. There were several pairs of socks, multiple pairs of underwear, a couple of shirts, trousers, and flannel pajamas. Draco couldn’t remember the last time he felt clean and bathed, much less the last time he changed into washed and nearly new clothing.
He strongly exhaled the breath he was holding and stood up. He looked into Potter's eyes but didn't take his hand.
Harry came up and starting kissing him, not moving his penis at all, giving Draco time to adjust. He played with his nipples, softly twisting them, and getting sounds of pleasure from Draco's throat.
“I can see you out, dear!” Frida was hovering right next to Harry with a smile on her face. Harry kept staring after Malfoy, silent. “He usually works in there for a couple of hours after we close,” Frida continued. Harry was still for a few moments before he turned his attention to her.
"Potter wait, you overpaid-" but Draco couldn't stop him. Harry softly smiled again as he quickly turned his head for just a second, and wistfully left the store. Draco stared in his wake until he was completely gone from sight.
Draco stared intently onto his own hands, resting on top of his knees. Pale and thin in comparison to Potter's. Without a single scar or blemish.
“Oh yes, of course! I knew he was familiar! Never did meet him in person, but the Daily Prophet always wrote about him.”
Harry turned to Malfoy. He was looking at his glass, swirling the liquid around as he continued to speak.
Harry walked out of the room. Draco took some potion out of the bottle and rubbed it all over his lower stomach, with none of the loving, careful attention that he had felt from Harry.
After some time, Draco wanted to get inside the bathtub. Peter got the water ready with a warming charm, and Harry helped him out of his clothes.
“You can’t,” Draco replied, smiling. “This is a translation of a Polish book I found in France. It’s not illegal though, I checked.”
Draco walked out carrying a few empty boxes and set them beneath his register. It was a busier evening and he didn’t want to leave Frida by herself. A small queue started to form as he rolled up his sleeves at the counter.
“Yeah, I know. I’m ashamed to say that some of that was my own doing. I gave him quite a hard time in school, when I was obsessed with impressing my father and trying to feel like a ‘chosen one’ like Potter was.”
“Thank you, Potter.” Draco’s voice was gentle and quiet. Harry wondered how long he had been like this.
Draco just looked at him, his eyes glassy, his hands still holding onto Harry’s hair. Harry tenderly kissed his lips, coming up slightly to look at him. He put his hand on Draco’s face, rubbing his cheek with his thumb.
“Malfoy….the look on your face,” Harry fell flat on his side across the sofa, his head resting on the arm. His entire body shook with laughter.
Thank goodness.” He took a bite of a sandwich, mouth full as he said the last words. “I’ve been dating men. I haven’t been with a girl for a long time.”
“Do not worry about that, I have good news for you!” She said, indicating him to follow her to the back room.
“Here, take some of this.” Harry handed him a pain potion. “Its not a strong dose, just enough to take the edge off. I don't want you too drowsy,” he laughed.
“No. Don’t stop. Just….slow down.” He looked at Harry and ran his fingers through his hair again. Harry looked down at him.
“Nah. There’s something else up. Tell me.” Ron said, casually, taking a few chips from a bowl and dipping them in vinegar.
How many times I had dreams of Draco accompanied with my nightmares. How many times I wanted to send him an owl. How many times I wanted to purposely make friends with his friends just so we can be at one of those stupid balls together; to be in the same damn room. He had beaten me to it. This bloody stupid idiot who didn't deserve him. Because even if Draco was a prat at school, he was never stupid. He was smart, had a soft heart, and didn't continue the hatred he was brought up with.
“Not my child, no. My godson, Teddy,” Harry replied kindly. Draco was sure he had crossed a line between a civil and personal question for someone he didn’t know very well - unlike some of the witches and wizards who frequented his store. They knew most by name, and others they knew more personally. He gave a quick glance towards Potter.
“Yes sir, I can help you,” he said loudly over the sounds of chatter and shuffling feet. When he looked up to help the customer, he spotted a man with glasses and wild hair, as free and untamed as he had remembered it. Draco composed himself right away, focusing on counting money and bagging the items with more care than usual.
“Indian Star Jasmine,” Draco said, inhaling the flowers. “I’ve never used this in anything but I think I might.” He gave Harry a small grin.
When Harry turned the page, he saw a colored illustration of what was just described. His eyes widened with both fear and fascination.
“No, it’s more than that. You instinctively know what goes where. Not just your table setting but your house. It’s very…..homey.”
“Was I supposed to stay? You know how many men have left and walked out on me? That’s how it works, doesn’t it?”
Summer was coming to an end, and nothing had changed in regards to their relationship. One day, well into the late hours of the night, after
“No Draco, he didn't. There was no evidence of rape. I'm so sorry you went through this. I'd like it if the aurors caught him. He needs to be in Azkaban..."
There was so much more I wanted to say. There was so much more I wanted to do. But that was all that came out.
“Can I wash those for you?” Harry asked, motioning his hand toward the bag Draco still held at his chest.
“Oh it’s definitely not,” Frida said, reassuringly. “When I was growing up, we had this neighbor, this lovely young man, who found a husband many years later. He brought in this woman, very striking and confident, to his house over and over again, and I was thinking, “is he having an affair??” I was so horrified, I confronted him one day, and he told me she was his midwife! He was going to have a baby! Oh, you should have seen the look on my face dear, both relieved and overjoyed at this news! And she was so lovely! So kind and exuberant. Her name was Vasilia. She was from Greece. We got along immediately when we were introduced! I was sorry to lose touch with her, she was a wonderful friend to have."
“Oh no. I’d stay more like enemies. I bullied him and his closest mates, just to get under his skin.”
I slept on a makeshift bed next to his without ever letting go of his hand. Healers came in and out all night. I heard them, but pretended not to. My gut was twisting painfully again. Something told me not to let go of him.
“It...it hurts!!” Harry tightly wrapped his arms around him, speaking into his ear. “Keep breathing, Draco.”
“No, just you.” Peter put another cold compress on Draco’s forehead. “He’ll be back soon. I reckon he doesn’t want you to see him cry.”
“Draco, look at me.” He started to rub his cheeks again. When Draco opened his eyes, he looked right into Harry’s bright green eyes and noticed his flushed, red cheeks. He grabbed Harry’s hair again. Potter was sweaty and his skin felt like fire. Draco pulled on the dark mane, enjoying the feel of his silky, thick curls.
“Oh my dear….you think I was some nice little lady during my living years, don’t you? No, no, no, the Frida that you know and love has had her fair share of adventures in vice. Not just virtue, my dear.”
“Frida, please! Keep your voice down,” Draco kindly whispered, as he rubbed his head. The potion hadn’t taken his throbbing headache away completely yet.
He kept his finger inside as we made his way up Draco's body. He used his other hand, rubbing Draco's cheek with his thumb and gently pressed his lips to his. Draco deepened the kiss, shoving his tongue inside Harry's mouth. Both moaned loudly and Draco spread his legs further to feel him better, deeper, harder.
“I’m glad you like it.” Harry started to rub behind his neck, looking around to think of something else to say.
“They look much better, Draco. We can put some more,” he said, taking out another bottle of dittany from the drawer. “I think they'll fade away completely, given the time.”
Harry saw him walk towards the loo. He picked up the book that Draco had been reading. It looked well over a century old, if not older. The binding had been repaired quite a few times.
He was happy to see that Draco was still sitting down in the same position. “Can I give you a foot massage?” He couldn't believe he was saying this, but he remembered the words of the old wizard.
Two weeks passed and Draco didn’t see Harry once. He kept himself busier than usual by focusing work on new formulas and revising some older ones. His new
“I just wanted to say hi,” he would say and smile. Draco always thanked him, but kept him at arm’s length.
“FUCK!” Harry yelled, knocking over a potion bottle off his desk, the dark red liquid staining the floor. He had to leave. He couldn't trust himself. He felt wrong lying to the people he worked for, the hospital, and his future patients. Who'd want him as their healer after this? And every inch of this place was going to remind him of Draco. What he looked like, his voice, his body, his face, his eyes. He was going to constantly remember the things they spoke, the feel of his skin, his soft blond hair, his scars, his tears, his moans, and his screams. He was going to obsess over what they did, how much he loved it, how much he wanted it, how much he wanted Draco, how much he cared for him, how much he was angry at him, and how much he was missing him.
“My lad.” Frida brought the towel up to his forehead. “I can’t do much else. If I could embrace you, I would. But my body is not warm nor firm. Stay home tomorrow, I’ll take care of the shop.”
“Uh...yes. That would be lovely.” Draco scooted a little closer to Harry, keeping his feet on the table.
I didn't go anywhere near outside for any air. I fell on the bench right beneath the window of Draco's room. If I hadn't left, I was going to wrongly direct my anger towards Parkinson and Zabini. I wanted to curse this idiot ex of his. I was angry at so many people but I was mostly angry at myself.
He walked downstairs wearing Harry’s clothes. Grey cotton trousers loosely hugging his hips and a blue knitted jumper sagging around his shoulders. But the pants and socks fit just right. He hadn’t felt this pampered in a very long time. Potter’s clothes felt brand new on his body.
“Potter….fuck me.” He didn’t rationalize his desires. He promised to himself he wouldn’t think. He was drunk and he didn’t care. Harry started to kiss him again, keeping his hands on his face. He wasn’t gentle this time, Draco felt his passion on every inch of his skin. Potter wanted him. Badly.
“Can you believe it?? They were exiled for five years, remember? They come back and Malfoy opens up a shop right here in Diagon Alley. He has some balls.”
“Does it have anything to do with….you know?” Ron carefully asked, pointing to his own forehead to indicate Harry’s lightning bolt scar.
“Can you…..get…..my pajamas?” Draco spoke through the pain. “There in….under the covers. Of my bed.”
Harry rubbed his index finger up and down Draco's inner labia, enjoying his warm, slick wetness as it spilled down his hand. He brought his hand up to his mouth and licked his fingers. Draco watched him, getting very turned on by it, and rubbed his dick, wanting more.
It was time to go home. To leave behind the chaos of his mind and remember the peacefulness of the lonely night. As he walked away, a sharp sound, like a cloud blowing a whistle, made him turn his head around. There was a silver dragon, flying softly like a shadow between the stars, brightening the darkness with its powerful light. It was the most beautiful patronus that Harry had ever seen. The detailed scales of its skin, bellowing wings, and large eyes mesmerized him and he couldn’t stop staring until it slowly dissolved into the atmosphere. He continued to feel its magic long after it had left.
Harry came out of his stupor. “Oh, sorry. I was just...curious.” He laid the book carefully back on the table.
Harry heard the sound of his Floo when he was still in the kitchen. He had prepared some simple hors d’oeuvres while anxiously hoping that Malfoy would actually show up. His stomach twisted in nervous excitement as he took out a couple of drinking glasses, firewhiskey, and a bottle of brandy.
Draco shook his head, uttering a “nothing,” which sounded just a bit louder than a whisper. He started polishing harder, going in between the raised buttons.
spell. Harry immediately put the box on the floor and fell to Draco’s side. “Draco, hey. What’s the matter?” He tried to keep his voice calm.
Draco was in absolute bliss as he felt Potter’s strong, firm hands rub every single one of his toes, the balls of his feet, and his heels. He would miss Potter once he left his side. He knew this. But he was going to enjoy every moment that he could get.
“No! Please! No more!” Draco was openly crying now, sobbing into his pillow. Harry kissed his forehead, taking his hands inside his.
“That’s not what I want. I don’t just want another father to randomly come in whenever he feels like it. I want a family. A whole one, not a broken one. Potter doesn’t like me like that. I want the chance to have someone who will, then we can raise the child together.”
Ron read quietly. The font was in gold calligraphy with some sort of code at the top, combining numbers and letters.
Draco smiled and laughed a bit under his breath. “I noticed.” He took another bite of his tiny sandwich.
Harry was standing next to a small dinner table near the kitchen. He smiled upon seeing Draco and started to serve him first. They both sat down at the same time across from one another. The food looked incredible and smelled delicious. There was a pasta dish with a red pepper sauce, stir-fried vegetables, cucumber salad, garlic bread, and a glass of water with condensation building on the outside. Draco felt overwhelmed.
“Draco, look, I know healers come off really condescending sometimes, and you haven't been treated right, so I understand ok?”
After their meal, Harry decided to visit Draco before he changed his mind. Having just heard the things he had from Ron, he built the confidence and courage to face his fears.
“I think your father is missing out on a great son, Malfoy. You’re talented, hard-working, and intelligent. His. Fucking. Loss.” He said the last words into the cup as he took a drink.
“The way it works is the Ministry, St. Mungo’s, and potioneers work together to make sure nothing of this sort gets abused. Well, in reality, it starts with the Ministry. They send in DMLE employees to check our inventory and also check how much of it healers are prescribing. If the numbers match up, everything is fine. If they don’t, they’ll further investigate,” Malfoy kept his eyes on Harry the whole time, giving a small smile every now and then.
“That doesn’t matter right now. It may mean something or it may not. Maybe he wants to be friends, get to know you better, or he’s interested in other ways, but that’s not something you’re going to find out at this moment, so it’s not worth worrying over it, dear.” She replied patiently this time, facing him and staring right into his eyes.
“I can’t….baby is taking up all the space right now. Squishing my stomach, lungs and bladder. I have to constantly pee.” He struggled to lean over to take a croissant.
Draco looked at me and I couldn't tell if he understood. His eyes were scanning my face and he squeezed my hand.
Harry made himself down Draco’s body, kissed his breastbone, stomach, took his cock in his hand again, kissed the base, his scrotum, and perineum. He gently stroked the backs of Dracos’ thighs, finally resting them on his buttocks, spreading them open gently. Draco’s mind felt like mush and his body completely surrendered to Harry. Draco pulled his legs towards him with his hands from the back of his knees, giving Harry a complete view of the most intimate parts of his body. He felt Potter’s wet tongue gently lick his hole and he tightened the grip he had on his own legs. He firmly shut his eyes and started to slowly pant from pleasure and excitement. Harry twirled his tongue faster, covering his entire outer rim and making his way to the very center. He slowly started to penetrate him, his tongue hard, hot, and very wet. Draco let out a loud moan, not able to hold it in any longer.
When Harry walked inside the kitchen, he saw Peter sanitizing some tools near the sink. He took a glass out of a cupboard and filled it with an
It hadn't been five minutes into their conversation at the bar when Draco had followed him outside to apparate to the stranger’s flat.
“I’ll be downstairs. I’m going to make dinner. I’ll see you soon.” Harry left, softly smiling and gently closing the door behind him. He took Draco's clothes off his bed and walked down. When he reached the laundry room, right near the kitchen, he dumped all the articles of clothing onto a small table. Out of habit, he checked every pocket before throwing them into the running water. Every pocket was empty except one. From one of the inner pockets of the blazer jacket, he pulled out a piece of white paper that had been folded up neatly into a small square. It had been faded and softened all along the edges from time and weather. He stuck it inside his own shirt pocket, fighting his curiosity and urge to open it. He did not want to invade Draco's privacy, and remembered to give it to him later.
This made Harry come not too long after. The sounds coming out of Draco’s mouth, the smaller moans which were like soft, delicate sobs after his initial scream, completely made Harry lose his mind.
Harry could feel Draco’s body shake against him. He gently kissed his temple and swept his hair back. It was wet from a mixture of water and sweat.
He put down the bottle tenderly in front of Harry and continued to speak in the same delicate manner.
The next few nights and days were the same. I never let go of Draco and kept talking to him, even though his expression was blank and sometimes confused.
Pansy sighed. “Yes. But not with the intention to hurt Draco. He admitted to notifying The Prophet about the ball and who was going to be there and with whom."
“I love you so much, Potter.” Draco firmly kissed him, believing he was worthy of this. Of Harry. Their daughter. Of Frida. His little shop. He had finally made peace with his life in England.
“Just got some things to replace the ones you had,” he said as Draco unwrapped the brown tissue paper off of a pair of navy blue velvet trousers.
Their orgasms came to a hilt at the same time, both men groaning and panting loudly, Harry's head falling onto Draco's chest. Harry kissed Draco again, carding his fingers through his hair. “You're so fucking gorgeous. That was incredible.”
Harry touched his nose to Draco's, kissing him and saying, “You stop me anytime, alright? Anytime you want.” Draco kissed him in acknowledgment.
His hair was more relaxed than Harry had remembered it, with a side part that swept a little over his eyes. Harry thought this made him look more approachable than the stiffness of his former style. He was wearing a dark teal button-up shirt with the sleeves rolled up to his elbows, and brown trousers that hugged the thin muscular shape of his legs.
Harry licked two of his fingers, still keeping his eyes on Draco. He slowly entered one finger inside of him, using his other hand to bend one of Draco’s knees towards his chest.
“Besides the cuts, nothing else, thankfully. You'll just need time to recover, practice working those muscles again, and gain strength. I'd give it about a week before you'll be able to leave.”
“That will be two galleons and a sickle, good sir! And a bag of Fizzing Whisbees for the children,” she exclaimed enthusiastically, handing the man a bag of the
Harry thought Draco looked so beautiful holding the flowers against his smooth, flushed skin. His pink lips looked darker in contrast to the pale petals that touched them.
Draco felt frustration rise in his chest. “I don't know! You tell me! You took off my clothes and saw everything! Did he fucking rape me?!” His voice was loud and desperate, the tears finally falling.
“I suppose,” Malfoy replied, taking his eyes away from Harry. “Very Slytherin of you to think that.” Harry chuckled at this. “I’m not going to risk illegal potion business, Potter, even if I did need the money. Living in fear and paranoia is no way to live.”
“Mr. Potter, he's losing blood, we need to work immediately,” Modley said as he locked the door after setting Draco's body on the table. Draco had deep, six-inch gashes all across his thighs and lower abdomen, and blood had soaked his entire lower region, darkening his trousers and shoes in deep crimson wetness.
“It’s alright, Malfoy. I’m not going to take up much of your time. I just wanted to give you these.” He placed the jasmines on top of Draco’s book, turning away towards the door.
This time, Harry's mouth sank even lower at what he saw: Draco had a triangle of light brown pubic hair between his legs that lead to what was clearly female genitalia. His slightly open knees and thighs were just wide enough to show the outer labia, which was pink and shaven. A larger-than-average clitoris was also visible between them. Blood had stained the entire area and more trickled down from his stomach when his shirt was finally lifted. Harry looked up to see Draco's pale and hairless chest. There was no sign of damage here expect for the two pink straight lines below his pectorals. The thick scars were clearly old; even if the color and tenderness made it seem otherwise. His nipples were a darker pink and perked out of his inch-wide areolas.
“I have no idea. Do you know if Slug and Jigger’s sells anything like this?” He took a pale blue paper out of his breast pocket and handed it to Ron.
“Please don’t tell anyone, Frida. I know you won’t, but I just have to say it. This has to be our secret.”
Draco liked to sleep in. Especially Saturdays of all days. Potter thought he can just demand things and everyone would listen and obey. He was praying to Merlin that it would be anyone else but Potter who showed up. He'd take Weasley over Potter. Anyday, anytime. He can take the Mickey out of Weasley easily. But Potter...Potter rubs him the wrong way. Yes, he hadn't seen him in years but his face hadn't exactly been out of sight. The Prophet usually liked to feature the Boy-Who-Lived on it's front page. His engagement (and breakup) from Weaselette, him outing himself as bisexual after being spotted with a muggle bloke, and of course, the melodramatic Harry the Hero article on the new wizarding orphanage he opened that mainly survives on his funding.
As he stepped outside the Leaky, his attention went to a large bush beneath a window. It was sprinkled with small white flowers shaped like stars. Harry picked a strand with three of them on it and deeply inhaled its strong, rich scent. He stuck it inside his breast pocket and crossed the street.
After this, Harry visited more frequently. Mostly during the late hours when customers seemed to die down a bit, so he could spend more time talking to Draco. He kept bringing jasmines, purchasing a potion or two, and sometimes just brought the flowers and didn’t buy anything at all.
“Draco...I want to see you. Let me see you,” he spoke to him tenderly, rubbing his thumb over his cheek again. “You’re so beautiful, look at me while I fuck you.”
Harry walked quickly towards the loo and looked around as he relieved his bladder. Draco’s flat was modest and clean. He didn’t have much decor but everything was tidy and organized. Harry particularly liked the clawfoot bathtub in the corner. The small window above the sink was splashing sunlight right onto it. When he left, his curiosity made him take a quick peek at the bedroom to his right. The door had been left open and Harry only took a couple of steps in to look around. Next to Draco’s bed was a wooden crib and a drawer with a nappy-changing station. A mobile with a variety of magical creatures hung from the edge of the crib. There was a phonograph in one corner and a large area rug in swirls of blue and green. Above Draco’s bed, the large branch of jasmines Harry had left at the shop was laid out on the headboard. This made him smile, but his heart twisted at the fact that Draco would be alone with his baby. He felt proud that the man had done all this by himself, welcoming his child with so much love and attention.
“Draco….I care about you so much.” Harry's voice got him back into focus. “You’re almost done, baby.” He saw the tears on Harry’s face. Peter had been telling the truth.
“Oh my sweet girl!!” Frida shouted excitedly. Jasmine and Frida did a sort of twirling dance, spinning and gesturing together. They mirrored one another’s movements, and Harry smiled warmly at his daughter’s affection for her aunt. Frida couldn’t hug or kiss Jasmine, so they came up with this special type of greeting.
Draco opened his eyes and grabbed Harry’s hair again. He took a deep breath, as Potter started to enter him. He went excruciatingly slow, stopping constantly, while rubbing Draco’s face. He kissed him, again and again, and pushed a little more in, and a little more. Then, suddenly, Draco felt a sharp pain, and Potter immediately froze.
Draco's bruise looked much lighter in color but still very swollen. Both his eyes looked tender and red. Harry's thoughts went to how heartbroken he had felt watching him cry yesterday. He wanted to give him a tissue but Malfoy kept using his sleeves to dry his tears. He figured that the tears along with the rubbing was the reason why he looked sad and exhausted. He opened his case and took out a few ointments. He twisted the cap on one of them and put his middle and ring fingers in the light yellow oil. Draco looked at him quietly, not saying a word and sitting very still. Harry gently dabbed his wet fingers on the bruise and Draco twisted his head back.
“I don't have one. Well, I mean, I guess I've noticed a pattern, but that has to do more with me than with the people I'm attracted to.”
Potter kissed him like a hungry, ravenous man. Draco returned the actions eagerly, holding tightly to the back of his neck. He combed his fingers through Harry’s hair; hair he had been obsessed with for years. Hair he had wanted to pull out of anger and envy, to stroke with lust and desire, to feel out of curiosity and wonder. Harry’s hair. The symbol of the wild, brave, and heroic man that he wanted. Primal and untamed. He gently pulled, right at the root near his scalp, enveloping both his palms with the smooth and thick mane. Potter’s warmth was addicting, and he felt a slight wetness near Harry’s temples, and knew how much he was enjoying Draco’s intense affection.
Draco was angry. He felt even warmer and held his breath. He stopped eying Potter and clenched the stack between his fingers, seeing the tips of them turning white. He forcefully ripped off the last page, threw the goddamn pile in front of Potter, and scribbled his name dramatically on the last line; taking his time as the quill danced between his fingers. He kept staring at it after he finished, admiring his penmanship, because he didn't know where else to look. He dropped his quill to the side, a bit of black ink staining the wooden table.
Draco slowly opened his eyes to a bright room that smelled like metal and bleach. His brain felt numb but his entire body was in pain. He was able to somewhat cope because of the dazed sensation inside his head. His blurry vision came almost to focus when he saw a dark-haired man enter from the door right across the bed he was lying in.
“I’ll try,” Draco softly laughed, giving Harry a final kiss before spreading his legs around Potter’s hips. After some satisfaction from snogging, Harry made his way down Draco’s body and took his cock inside his mouth, not hesitating to go all the way down to the base. Draco moaned loudly in pleasure and he grabbed Harry’s hair again, massaging his scalp to show his gratitude and enjoyment. Harry held the backs of Draco’s knees, pushing them towards his chest, until Draco’s hole was exposed right in front of his face. Draco shut his eyes and took a deep breath. It wasn’t too late to stop all this. He could still go home and forget this ever happened. But he couldn’t. Harry was enjoying this as much as he was, and he couldn’t think too hard or too much about it. Drunk or not, he wanted this. He may never again be able to get this close to Harry Potter. It felt way too good to stop any of it.
When Harry looked up at the direction of the voice, he saw an elderly man with a grey beard and a short, emerald hat. He was inhaling on a long pipe, blowing out smoke in rings into the black night. Harry remembered who he was.
“I’m just tired. Long day. How are you?” Harry took a sip of pumpkin juice, avoiding the beer and firewhiskey.
“I already did. She’s on her way. I thought you were her.” He opened his eyes, looking at Harry with discomfort. “What are you doing here, Potter?” His voice was weak and non-threatening.
“Mate, just have your drink. Work is over for today. What did the healer say about the pain then? What can you do?”
Draco took a deep breath, bringing his chest to his belly, pushing with all the force he could gather.
Draco nodded. Harry was gentle and let Draco control every movement. The sound of the Floo came from the living room.
It was Friday night when Draco saw Potter again inside his shop. He noticed him by the corner of his eye at the
Draco hated that he cared and that he was curious. All the gay wizards he met at bars were nobody he knew from school or grew up with. He wanted to know more about Potter, but as friendly as Potter was to him all these years later, it was still under a very professional exterior and he was sure his job had a lot to do with it.
“Male.” Draco responded quickly and firmly. He felt the need to cut through whatever face Potter was trying to put on.
He scanned the shop and noticed Frida showing some vials to a woman with a baby in the children’s section. Draco wasn’t around. He walked near the fireplace and took out the flowers he had picked, inhaling its perfume and staring into the flames.
Draco was bleeding from his ears. He was screaming and shaking uncontrollably until I grabbed his hands in mine and squeezed them with all my strength. This seemed to have grounded him until he was given a pain potion. The Healers scanned his head and entire body again and again and cast numerous spells. He slowly opened his eyes and looked directly into mine.
This wasn't what Draco was expecting at all. He hadn't even wanted Potter here in the first place. But this Potter wasn't the image in the newspapers. He needed to give Draco a reason to keep his beliefs in place. He wanted to see an egotistical, self-righteous Potter. He needed to keep convincing himself that it was better to hate Potter instead of pathetically sweating and swallowing in his presence.
Harry swallowed and looked down at the floor. There was just one more person in the queue ahead of him, and he was hoping to Merlin that she went to Malfoy so he could be helped by Frida and avoid any awkwardness.
“I don’t think I can do anything to even make up for being ‘fair,’ Potter. Not after everything I’ve done in the past. You ended the war. I only caused damage.” Draco was no longer looking at Harry and kept his eyes on the bronze box, roughly rubbing it with the flannel.
“Get your filthy hand off me!” Draco's voice was shrill and desperate. As he struggled, the man's other hand pushed down his chest, pinning him to the bed, while he continued fondling him with the other.
. He tried pulling himself up in a sitting position and groaned in pain and shock of how strong it hit through his lower body. “FUCK.”
Frida came back within seconds, handing the wand to Draco. He checked the words inside the book, muttering the spell a few times to practice, then, pulling up his shirt, placed his wand over his bare stomach below the naval. He did this over and over again, and each time, a red light glowed from the tip of his wand. He fell back on his chair, grabbing the front of his hair in frustration.
Draco hoped his feelings, and possible mannerisms around Potter, were only obvious to Frida because she was so keen on human behavior. She had the talent for figuring out what someone wanted and what they might be feeling. That’s what made her so pleasant to work with and befriend. Draco had kept his feelings for Potter wrapped in a heavy rug, locked inside a steel trunk, shrunk to the size of a pearl, shoved away inside a secret chamber in his heart, where no one could possibly discover it. This was a place he was never willing to open, or even entertain the thought of. For many long years, he had avoided any thoughts of Harry Potter and his past in England. Now it was becoming reality that the world of his childhood and school years might rise to the surface and this would be utterly terrifying.
“No. No, Draco. The baby needs you. You’re going to be such a good dad. This child is going to be so smart and so talented and so blessed because of you, Draco. Stay strong. I know it’s awful, I’m so sorry. I wish I could bear this for you.” Harry’s voice started to break so he stopped speaking.
Draco smiled. “You see that side, Potter, because you’ve only interacted with me as a customer. You knew how I was back in school, during the war-”
“Malfoy, I’ll be right there!” He shouted towards his living room. When he walked in with the platter of food, he saw Draco dusting himself off near the hearth.
“Fuck, Malfoy, you’re so fucking hot, I’m going to come so soon.” Harry was pushing more aggressively against him, pushing Draco’s knees far into this chest.
“Here, let me help,” Harry said, gently taking the top of his trousers and pulling them down his legs. Draco had changed into the white pants with the golden snitches. Harry grinned, exposing his bright teeth and soft wrinkles around his eyes. Potter was unfairly attractive and Draco had to look away.
It was harder, and took him longer, to walk away from the darker side of Diagon Alley the second time.
“Take your jumper off, Malfoy, it looks suffocating.” Draco chuckled and rolled up the ends of his sweater over his head, throwing it on the floor next to Harry’s discarded jacket. His erect nipples appeared behind his cotton undershirt, which came to Harry’s attention immediately.
“Who was that young man? I couldn’t help notice that you speak to him a little differently. Like you’ve known him for years.”
The night sky was bright with the full moon as spring slowly made her way into summer. Inside the hearts of those who yearn for a life unleashed in passion and creation, lies a secret which she knows and lovingly fulfills. She shines equally on everyone, but especially those who make wishes upon her light. The jasmines of Diagon Alley twinkled majestically beneath her sight.
Draco didn't want to see him. Didn't want to face the farce that was Harry Potter. Even if he knew that most of this was to sell papers by exaggerating the reality and hiding any imperfect details.
“Potter….I,” he tried to speak, but his words were getting lost somewhere inside his chest. His head felt numb and for the very first time in a very long time, he wasn’t thinking. He remembered Frida telling him not to think. And it felt so good to be able to just let go.
“Yes. Healers have sworn to keep all patient information a secret. Its like an unbreakable vow. Please know that no one else will know or has to know for that matter. I will be the one who will continue to see you until you leave.”
“I can believe that,” Draco replied, contemplatively. “This book wasn’t easy to find and even harder to purchase. He sold it to me because I had just received my license to practice independently and promised him in writing that I wouldn’t start to brew this particular potion until I had at least 25 years of experience in the craft. Only thing is, the contract said 'in France,' and I knew by then that I had to come back to England.” Draco winked and smiled at Frida, whose face was in shock from surprise.
“I vant him to rest like this for a little. He is going to need energy.” She looked at Harry. “You look tired too, Kheri.”
Harry took the strand of flowers out of his breast pocket and left it next to Draco’s rag. He quietly walked out with his head down, his insides clenching in misery.
“Great,” Potter grinned widely. He took out a card out of his breast pocket. “Here’s my Floo address. Come by when you close.” He set it on the counter, near Draco’s fingers, and left the shop. Draco stood frozen with the flannel in his hand.
“Let me check you, Drakon.” Vasilia was between Draco’s legs, one hand on his knee and another which looked like it was going somewhere inside him.
It was mid-afternoon on Sunday when it happened again. Draco came face to face with Harry Potter, as he took customers from the queue with Frida during a particularly busy time.
“You’ll never regret doing everything you could have when you look back at it. You will, however, regret doing less than you could have.” He turned to Harry. “What have you really got to lose?” The man started to clean out his pipe against the ground, then stood up, straightening his cloak. Harry stood as well. “Nice talking to you, young man. Good luck.”
“AHHHHH…...HARRY……….GET IT OUT!!” He felt Vasilia pull a slippery little body out of his own, and immediately put the squirming little infant onto his chest.
“Harry, listen. I’m okay with you pretending it didn’t happen, alright? I’m used to stuff like that-”
“At this moment, he’s okay. We have to go moment by moment with these things. Everything is normal as birth can be from what I’ve seen. I can’t sugarcoat things, but I will say that nothing has happened that raises concern. You’re really doing a lot for him. It would’ve been a lot more difficult without your support. I hope you know that.” He gave Harry’s shoulder a squeeze and left.
“Yes….yes. We just need to finish up a few things. We hope you’ll come back tomorrow. So sorry.” She quickly went back inside the room, concerned for Draco.
“I’ve been telling you to cut your work hours a bit, haven’t I?” Ron said while sipping from his mug once more, raising his eyebrows with concern.
After the arduous process of skillfully measuring, crushing, weighing, stirring, and heating that was necessary to perfect his new potion, Draco left the shop to walk upstairs to his flat, situated right on top of his shop. Frida stayed behind as usual, dusting the floating candles to be ready for a new day.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t mean it that way. I’m just concerned, I haven’t seen you and...it’s none of my business.” Harry looked devastated, and Draco’s heart broke at the sight of this.
