He smirked.
With that problem solved they had gone to Regulus with Harry’s wish, and he had out right told them it was too soon. Though he wanted to see his nephew happy, he didn’t think it was safe. Even with Severus’ potion. If Albus suddenly lost two of his closest assets to Harry, and felt had no control, he would speed up whatever nasty plot he had for the boy. Then they wouldn’t have the time they needed to put that man behind bars where he belonged. Tom had to agree, and with that it was settled. Regulus would be the one to take Harry in to the will reading. A letter had already gone to Albus to inform him of the will reading, both from the goblins and Severus. Severus’ was of course questioned, but by law, there was nothing to keep family, like Regulus, from pulling Harry out of school for private lessons or family matters like this. Albus had to, by law, ‘let’ Regulus take the boy.
LeFay was at the end of his leads, and Ammit hadn't come back from Hog's Head. It was starting to worry him, Ammit wasn't a snake that took his orders lightly. Being a familiar LeFay could feel him, but it felt off. Wrong some how, but he didn't have the time right now. And then there was this, he looked down at Draco again, swiping hair from the mans face.
Draco understood everything. This whole time, Harry had been trying to protect him, for him.
Draco woke with a start and quickly vomited over the side of the cot he lay on. Coughing, and sputtering he tried to breath but something squeezed his chest to tightly. He felt his claws slide on the thin fabric as he struggled to get up, panting hard. His head ached and pounded against the back of his eyes. He almost snapped the hand that touched him clean off before he heard Severus' voice.
Someone will love you
The group nodded, some seeming a little irritated they hadn't started there.
Knowing the wards would give out within the day she headed back down the stairs from the Astronomy Tower. She sighed as she walked down the stairs, going over the list of everyone still at the school. She remembered seeing all the eighth-year students in the great hall, already up to protecting their school again. She broke the news of the wards to the rest of the staff and students when she entered before they started setting a defensive line.
Harry wiped the blood off his hands with a rag graciously given to him by one of the med witches. “No August, he’s just been used like the rest of us. You’ll understand when you talk to him next,” Harry said, “Right now I need to talk to Lord Malfoy, do you know where Snape took him to treat him?”
First there had been attacks by the death eaters a few towns over, flooding Hogsmead with survivors, then Ginny confronted him about how he'd been acting lately. Harry, being cornered by Ginny at the time, was forced to tell her the truth about him being gay, and then this. Draco was dead and was more than likely Harry's fault. It was always his fault.
“Severus should be able to help you.”
“You make it sound like I was desperate,” Hermione joked. Theo grinned and then looked back down at Harry.
"I see you've gone onto being bold enough to explore someone else's private space," he said.
Harry woke to an incessant poking against his cheek. Groaning he swatted at it and then settled back into his sleeping position before hearing a growl as the poking started again. Harry let out a growl of his own and swatted at the offending appendage again. “I swear Potter, if I have to poke you again-,” the voice cut itself off as Harry’s eyes flashed open. Avada kedavra eyes peered at Draco, turning his stomach and making him flush red.
The two house elves popped in front of them, smiling with tall ears as they waited for commands.
Sirius Black was re positioned in the center of the room before they could start. Pain echoed through his body as the goblins started to mutter, their hands working delicate symbols into the air. Once it was done Severus tentatively opened his eyes, only this time everything seemed sharper; and the colors brighter. He didn’t feel any different but Harry and Remus gasped.
"That's it, come here. I'll keep you safe," Draco cooed. Harry looked hesitantly from Draco to the eyes above him, then looked back up at the boy and his outstretched arms. Slowly he reached out and took the boy's hand before being pulled into a tight hug. He didn't realize how cold he was till the warmth enveloped him.
That made LeFay laugh and he stepped away from Draco to lean on the door. He put a hand to his chin as he looked Draco up and down.
Sirius smiled and ruffled Harry’s hair, “Well...”
Severus scoffed, “It’s my job my Lord. Now, I must get ready. I don’t plan on letting you leave me behind at the manor.” With that he turned and started out of the grand hall, the large doors closing behind him with a low thud.
"Okay, okay. That's enough you two," Harry sighed as he caught the candle and put it back up. The tiger huffed at him before changing back into the wizard version of Theo. He picked up Hermione in his arms before placing her in the bathroom with her clothes. "That's pretty cool. Specially since you are so accustom to shifting that your clothes shift with you. I thought the Maltese Tiger was just a normal tiger though," Harry tilted his head as Theo walked back from the bathroom.
"Yea, I'm fine. Neville, a hand please?" Harry asked as he flushed slightly with embarrassment. Neville chuckled and helped Harry up, smiling at him before patting him on the back.
Draco is Draco. A very angry Draco.
Luna smiled sweetly and leaned her face into her hand as she rested her elbow on the table. “Everything has been amazing. I came into my creature inheritance earlier than my parents expected. They knew beforehand but wanted to surprise me,” her voice sounded just as distant as ever as she tilted her head to look at the ceiling. “It’s a pretty long held tradition that every few generations there is a girl born with a unicorn inheritance. I’m pretty lucky.”
Minerva looked over at Draco as Harry nodded and inspected the young Malfoy. Narcissa had told her that Draco had come into a very unusual inheritance as well, but that they’d known he would inherit it before hand. Even so, she could feel his presence as well. Her feline sense where on overload. The room felt like she was sitting with two giants on the verge of war.
“Yes mother?”
Harry woke in the same state he did before, panting heavily as he looked around. Seeing that he was, in deed, still in his room he slumped back into his bed. Lifting his arm so that they covered his eyes. “Ugh… At least they aren’t nightmares about Volde anymore,” he said quietly.
“Come on then, let’s get this over with,” he grumbled. Draco made his way into the room as Harry grabbed a simple shirt and pulled it on. He avoided looking Harry’s way, and then turned to face him. He suddenly felt like he had just entered the liar of something evil and cunning. Just waiting for him to make the wrong move before leaping and devouring him. Harry had truly changed, or maybe he had always been like this and Draco just hadn’t been observant enough to notice.
“Thanks,” Draco muttered as he dusted himself off. Harry nodded and then turned to Remus and Sirius as they stood in the doorway of the drawing room.
“What?!” LeFay questioned, stunned that Severus had cut him off.
"AWWWWW! You're soooo cute!" he cooed. Hermione didn't seem to like that very much and hissed at him, batting at his face with sheathed claws. Her calico fur puffed up in her angered state before she leapt out of his arms and hid behind Harry. "Oh, come on Hermione!"
Sirius paused to gage the reactions of the two Malfoys, nodding when they stayed completely emotionless. They both seemed to know he had more to say. “He also has come into a rather rare inheritance passed down through both the LeFay, and Slytherin lines with a few roots in the Peverell as well,” he paused, licking his lips. “Harry is a Kistune.”
“What!? I was horrible to him as a wizard! Bloody hell I tried to kill him even!” LeFay threw up his hands.
Draco nodded and placed his mother’s shrunken chest with his own before following Kreacher down the hall. “Are our rooms close by?” Draco asked Kreacher while moving Bubo moved to his shoulder. The Eagle Owl eyed the house-elf as Kreacher turned to answer.
Harry took the collar back and jogged over to Charlie. “Can this help? I know it has protection charms and loads of other ones on it,” Harry asked. Charlie’s mouth tilted as he lifted the collar from Harry’s hands. He placed the shard of magical glass over one of his eyes to inspect it and slowly a smirk formed on his face.
LeFay nodded, "Yes, it does confuse some of the residence, but they get use to it. In time I'm sure you will too."
Tatsuya asked.
Severus leaned back and sighed as he sat down on the floor, his eyes floating over to look at the bed Harry laid on. Or at least what was left of him at this point.
Draco fidgeted in his seat uncomfortably as he watched Voldemort move closer. His eyes fell to where Tom cradled his arm and then back up to his face. Voldemort was to focused on Harry to notice the gaze. "How is the arm?" Draco asked quietly.
Draco swallowed, backing up a step.
"Your summons seemed rather urgent," Snape half sneered. Albus merrily nodded his head and reached for a lemon drop from his desk. "However, if it something that can be discussed later..." Albus shook his head.
LeFay laughed as he rolled his shoulders and turned to face the blonde currently hiccuping most, if not all, of his bed. "Most of them, if not all of them," he smirked, using his arm to lean on the bed post. The robe slipped open, the knot Harry'd used not secure. "Do you have a problem with them?" he asked as his smirk vanished. Replaced by a look of curiosity, as well as hungry eyes focused directly on the ex-death eater.
Starts to fall in love with me
“Yea, yea.”
he stated. Harry’s nose scrunched. An apology? Dragon’s didn’t do apologies. Unless…
“What are you looking at?” Draco muttered.
"Now, student's, before we start our dinner I feel it is necessary to update you all in the importance of safety in these dark times," Dumbledore announced as he stood at the head of the teachers table, "I know you all must be worried about what the future holds, but I implore you all. Panicking at times like these will only create more chaos and confusion. I know, everyone has heard by now about what has happened to Draco Malfoy and his family. I want this to be a lesson, one we can all learn from, it is not one group that is targeted by the death eaters, it is all of us. In order to defeat the darkness, everyone will have to band together," Dumbledore stopped for a moment, looking over at the Slytherin table, as if waiting for something and then waved his hand.
The vampire grinned. “You won’t find any friends of witches and wizards like you in these woods,” he spat. “I know Ladon isn’t your real name either, so what is it?”
Voldemort looked over the bed, dropping his bleeding arm to his side as he gripped the side of the bed with his good hand. Severus stepped up to the side of the bed as well, a look of pain on his face. "My'Lord?"
“Harry, do you think you could remove the other spears?” Charlie questioned as he stepped up beside him and Bill. Harry shrugged, his eyes watching Draco the dragon as he finished drinking and laid down in a sunny patch of grass.
“Well, for one. You come in here quite often with another werewolf, and I’d rather not cross another of my kind. Plus, you’re Harry fuck’in Potter,” she laughed and smiled at him. When he didn’t relax, she released his arm and ran a hand through her hair. After a moment she crossed her arms over her chest and looked at him determinedly. “Fine, I’ll swear an unbreakable vow not to reveal that Harry Potter is a Kitsune,” she stated. Harry blinked, surprised.
Turning slightly to the left he saw it. A well beaten path cutting through the growth around him. Harry hoped down and jogged through the trees; the humming growing louder, and louder as he jogged down the path.
Harry had simply rolled his eyes and apparated to Hogsmead with his things.
"Draco, he's gone."
No matter what he had tried the damned thing wouldn’t come off. In the first few years he had tried potions, curses, charms, you name it, in anger. Now it reminded him, sadly, of what he couldn't have. That Harry, LeFay, was still alive somewhere but didn't care a damn about him. Deep down though, he was hopeful. Perhaps it stayed firmly clasped together because part of Harry still lived in LeFay, perhaps LeFay was just waiting for the right moment to come and claim him. Yet, it never happened in all those six years.
!” Sirius yelled, amplifying his voice with his wand. Both men stopped and straightened, turning their attention to Lord Black.
Slowly Draco stood, placing the letter to Hogwarts in his pocket. “Why are you telling me?” he asked.
Draco shushed him, readying to put a hand over the Lord's mouth again if he kept going.
Well that explained why Luna acted so strangely. “That must be really cool. Have you gone and talked to any of the unicorns in the Dark Forest?” Harry asked. Luna shook her head and sighed.
Heading over to a set of double doors to his left he stopped, looking up at the crest above it. A large LF was scrawl atop a blue-grey fox, with nine tails, sitting above the door. One paw resting atop a diamond sphere while its glowed green while staing down at Draco. Hesitantly he pushed open the door, surprised by the amount of light that hit him from inside.
“Lady Malfoy’s room is close, but Master Draco’s is on the second floor in the west wing.”
"No. Severus please sit," he motioned to another chair in the room. "You need answers."
If a look could kill, Harry would have died on the spot. Draco’s glare was paralyzing.
“However, if your familiar is to attack anyone unprovoked, and/or with the intent to kill, you and your familiar will be expelled. Is that clear?” Mistress McGonagall looked at Harry, narrowing her eyes. She could still recognize Harry, but his new appearance shocked her. Even more so was the fact he hadn’t yet been able to control his magic completely. She could feel it even now; the overwhelming presence in the room and it prickled at the back of her neck.
"Tell me Sissy," Severus all but demanded.
"Well, since unicorns are almost immortal beings, I'm not exactly full grown so...no laughing," she stated and pointed her finger at all of them. Her transformation was much like Theo's; in the fact that her clothes morphed with her. Everyone was smiling brightly when Luna stood, a small yearling version of a unicorn with a silvery mane and long spindly tail with silvery strands at the end. Her horn however was nothing but a small nub, compared to a full unicorn's. Only about the size of a person's middle finger. No one dared laugh at the very angry looking unicorn even as it tried to take a step and slid over the hardwood floor. Harry went over and petted her silky mane, grinning brightly.
LeFay really had changed, even the way he looked at Draco. He could pick out new scars along LeFay's arms were the sleeves didn't cover, some crisscrossing his face and catching the light. Harry's bolt was gone, replaced by a new scare that extended over his right eye, ending just under it. Another crossed over it on cheek, the one just last a small nick on his upper lip. It looked pretty fresh compared to the others.
“Where’s Draco?” he asked, confused. Draco would be so mad about the fact he did exactly what he’d told Harry not to do. Neville and Luna looked down at the bed silently and Hermione put a hand on his shoulder, rubbing it.
“Yes, but it also seems you were just about to leave,” LeFay said quietly.
Sirius was shaking with rage, “If only Albus hadn’t done what he did! If he hadn’t chained him like a dog Harry would have learned to control himself, to find his balance!” Everyone went silent as Sirius panted for breath.
How long had Potter been staring at him like that? All inquisitive like.
"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot introductions. The name's Hati, Hati Greyback," the man smiled.
"I can't believe I just drank that," he spat.
“Moving on then. As for the room and classes,” Minerva started, “After further discussion about the two of you and your current predicament I have allowed the request to share a room. However, do to an influx of students with creature inheritances the two of you will be taking almost all your classes together. You may have one class that is separate, so I suggest the two of you look over your schedules and reevaluate your classes. Originally Hogwarts was not accepting students with creature inheritances but because of Dumbledore’s death the rules have been reset to what the Founders wanted for Hogwarts. That includes all the classes that Albus banned as well, so I also suggest you two look at those classes as well before making a full decision.”
She nodded and smiled brightly.
“I’ll have the school double its defenses and put all of the teachers on alert for suspicious activity,” she stated curtly.
LeFay paused, hands gripping the sides of his robes, jaw tight. “I’m not sure what I feel anymore. But I know for sure, that there is no more remorse when I strike someone down. No more wishing I hadn’t had to, none of the disgust I use to have,” he explained quietly.
LeFay's hands clenched, his jaw tightening as he leaned down to run his hand over his old friends smooth, lifeless scales. He could feel the tears forming behind his eyes but they never feel as anger started to fill him. This, this was a declaration of war for sure. This was a message. It wasn't teens fighting a weak half living skeleton of a man anymore, this was real.
Draco's head snapped from side to side, his nose twitching like mad as he fought to pick up that scent of jasmine and lavender that seemed to follow Harry everywhere. His hackles raised as all he could pick up was his family's stench mixed with his and Nagini's blood.
Ammit was cuddled up in the blankets Harry’d added a heat charm too, purring as Harry ran his slender fingers down the large snake’s head and neck.
“To explain what a mess Albus Dumbledore has really made.”
Minerva sat down on the bed and patted Harry’s hand. “It’s not your fault that Parvati and Draco are missing, I want you to know that,” she said softly before looking over at Bill and Charlie. “Does any of that help you two, Snape?”
"Draco no! The phoenix tears could only close the wounds so much when in contact with Nagini's poison, you'll tear them open!' Severus panted as he got to his feet and ran after Draco.
“That’s not Harry,” Draco whispered quietly as looked over at the two men with glazed eyes.
The poem/song repeat from the few chapters before this that Tatsuya sings however is mine. Sooo, no stealzys!    =(^ . ^)=
Maybe a house elf dropped it off for someone? He didn't remember seeing it there last night.
“Come, it’s been a long day. Lets rest with some tea,” Draco suggested, taking the taller man’s hand and leading Harry into the next room. They sat down on the sofa, with Harry resting his head down into Draco’s lap. “Is this how it will always be?” Draco joked.
“I suppose that means we will be running into some other type of creatures as well. Splendid,” Severus mumbled before he lifted the side of his coat to pull out a short vile. He uncorked it and drank it before putting it back into his coat.
"I couldn't keep my mind off you, LeFay. Even when I started working for Sev," Draco paused, looking down into his cup, "I couldn't stop thinking about you. Being able to feel you through the collar, that was what kept me going. I know you deny it, but I know deep inside. We are meant to be together; I know we are mates."
"I'd forgotten it was in the middle of winter. To use to being inside your," Draco paused, "domain."
Then the words just came to him. “I told you because I wanted to show you that I’m not just the boy-who-lived, or some Golden Boy. I showed you because I wanted you to know that what I do isn’t because I want attention. It’s because I want to make sure no one ends up like me,” Harry turned around and faced Draco, determination lighting his eyes.
Severus' eyes about burst from his head. Potter couldn't be serious!
“Well, I was able to get to the vaults my father left. Even with what Dumbledore had told me; that since I was disowned I wouldn’t be able to," he paused as his face darkened, "I’m starting to think that Albus was hiding a lot from us. A lot that he shouldn't have even been involved with,” Remus' tone was harsh but Sirius had to nod in agreement. “I also had blocked memories like you did Sirius. So we’ll have to share the pensieve.” he said with a small sigh and shrugged his shoulders. It didn't really bother him but Sirius was an impatient man. He blushed when he thought about Sirius' lack of self control.
He stood in front of his godfather’s bedroom mirror and stared at his new form.
“Sirius and Remus really?" he laughed, "If they truly ‘loved’ me, then they would have stepped up to the plate of parenthood far before Albus got his hands on me. Besides they have a legitimate heir now,” LeFay scoffed, “The others never knew the real me. As so I have had no reason to contact any of them.”
That was Parvati’s voice, Harry said to himself. Looking around the corner he could make out Dean and Seamus, and one other he didn’t recognize surrounding Parvati. He scowled and tightened his grip on the wall. The unknown student pushed Parvati against the wall and spat at her.
After they paid for the cauldrons Sirius decided that they would go ahead and stop by Menagerie’s first rather than head to Malkin’s. With how long it had taken with the fitting, making the clothes would probably take just as long. Harry walked ahead while Sirius carried the items they had purchased in an expandable bag he hooked over one shoulder. He watched Harry peek into the window before heading inside, and the smile on his godson/adopted son’s face was priceless. Sirius always knew Harry had a soft spot for animals.
Draco pulled the leaf from the roof of his mouth, gagging slightly. "This is disgusting," he muttered under his breath.
Harry whirled around, trying to face where the voice was coming from. He looked over at Ammit who just stared back at him.
Harry stopped reading and looked over at Remus, confused. “Weren’t the wills supposed to be read a month after my parents’ death?” he asked. Remus returned the confused look and nodded.
Dozens of red eyes stared back at him, reflecting the light from his wand.
Lupin looked over Harry worriedly before glancing back at Sirius who only shrugged. “Perhaps we should ask Snivellus to make some more dreamless sleep potions,” Sirius suggested; which Harry gave a quick shake of his head to.
Harry was glad he'd changed before leaving the house. The Egyptian shendyt, or kilt, he wore gave a lot more room to move and felt much better against his fur than anything else. Draco, however, was very uneasy about how Harry's choice of outfit. It was probably more do to the fact he wasn’t used to the muggle-like clothing Harry seemed to adore, but he also didn’t comment on how Harry’s tank top made him stand out inappropriately. Instead choosing to huff at him when he walked past and went through the floo.
“August, stay with him.”
“I said
Who knew the darkness could be so inviting without someone to hold onto.
Neville reached into his pocket, his eyes never leaving the snarling beast in front of him however, his hands shaking as he pulled out a lemon and lime candied fruit bar. He held it out slowly to Draco who sniffed it, did this kid really think he was going to eat that? However, as Draco got a bigger whiff of it he felt his mouth starting to water, and not a second later he had the bar snatched up in his jaws and was jumping down from the bed with it. Feeling smug with his prize he brought it back over to Harry without thinking and laid down at his feet with the bar between his paws and started chewing on it.
“Sorry. McGonagall would have evacuated everyone through the floo by now. It should be just her and the staff protecting the main hall. After the last battle, she started putting in some rather nasty precautions,” Snape said, his voice low, “The Auroras should be here any moment. If we cut the Death Eaters off from behind then maybe they’ll surrender."
“Can you tell me your name then?” he asked. Ammit looked up at his master, wondering what kind of conversation they could be having to make Harry ask that. The kitsune laughed at him, loudly this time and it felt like Harry’s head was being shook.
Kristian was awestruck.
Both Remus and Harry rolled their eyes as they took turns going through the floo.
“Sorry, mister dragon. Sorry that I woke you up by pulling a spear from your back. I was only trying to help,” Harry apologized, keeping his eyes on the dragon. The dragon continued glaring at him for a moment before softening. Then it was moving toward Harry with open jaws and Harry squeezed his eyes shut as the group started yelling. Suddenly he was dangling in the air, and when a minute passed, and he didn’t feel any pain, he opened his eyes only to see himself dangling over the grass. Eyes wide he started wiggling. “Put me down yea over grown lizard!” Harry yelled. He stopped struggling when he suddenly felt a breeze at the back of his neck form the dragon snorting. After he'd stopped he was slowly set down on the ground.
"I'm not sure dragon. I'm not sure," Sev said as he wrapped his arms around Draco and pulled him into a hug. It took only moment for Draco's mask to slid away, tears streaming down the teens face as he started bawling into Severus' chest. "Shhh, it's okay... It will all be okay," Severus whispered.
"And no lying this time. We all know how that ended up," Draco snorted as he turned in his seat to far Harry.
Tatsuya groaned.
Draco sat frozen as he looked into Tom's eyes. He genuinely was thanking him, and it was...weird...but...
“Harry, what was the strongest scent to you?”
Ghost, or rather Draco, couldn’t help but grin a little at hearing that. This way he wouldn’t have to worry about transforming with the collar on!
It must have lead to Harry's bedroom because as soon as Draco entered he was surrounded completely by the scent of early morning spring, clover, and mint. His eyes wandered over to the bed, surprised by how neat it was. He'd assumed it would be a mess with how much LeFay had on his plate right now, but it looked like it had been barely used.
Draco stopped beside him as they stepped out onto a balcony overlooking the courtyard Draco had been in earlier. He hadn’t even noticed they’d gone upstairs.
“I bind this vow,” Harry answered as his voice faltered and added the Knotweed. The fire went out in a puff of blue smoke and sparks as he felt the magic cascade over him. He watched Narcissa shiver before smiling at him and leaving.
“Not until we remove the block. Would you like me to remove it along with the tampered memory?”
"Harrison." Voldemort corrected quietly.
"Thank you for saving my nephew."
“Then, what are you?” Harry pushed.
“Wishing you could interact with the physical world again I see. Which book is it this time?” he asked.
As he opened his eyes, leaves where frozen in midair, and as he looked further there was nothing but ashes left of the Death Eaters.
“And you didn’t see Draco at all correct,” Snape sounded a bit hopeful but when Harry shook his head for the second time he sighed. “Narcissa is going to kill me.”
Tatsuya said, rolled his eyes as he floated around the room.
“Narcissa Black Malfoy, and Draco Malfoy are going to swear their allegiance to you today. Narcissa would have to do it soon or later, but Draco needs to do it for your safety and his own. I’m also going to blood adopt Draco into the Black line. It will strengthen our family ties, making it impossible for Draco to hurt anyone within the Black bloodline against his will. That along with the unbreakable vows,” Sirius explained as he stopped what he was doing. Harry looked over at Narcissa and Draco, surprised.
“Draco,” LeFay muttered apologetically, “I wish I could tell you everything, I wish I’d had the time and now you’re gonna have to find out in the worst way. I really am a monster,” Harry murmured aloud to himself.
He let out a slow breath as he felt Draco move down his body, his eyes rolling. This, this is what it felt like to be truly hole. This is what he'd been missing.
“You can’t just take someone’s food without asking.”
Draco could feel the sincerity in LeFay's words, and it filled him with warmth.
Draco leaned over Harry and smirked, “Course I will. We are bonded now after all, I mean, even our magic has settled, no more creature features,” he said with a light laugh as he tugged at his hair where his horns used to sit. His face became serious for a moment as he helped Harry to his feet. “I have to ask a serious question first,” Draco’s eyes narrowed slightly, “Do you love him, Cadmael I mean?”
She paused at the door and looked back at Harry with a bit of pity. Then she spat at the ground angrily. “That man ruined Hogwarts as well as a great many other things. Try looking at the classes he stopped or the many books he removed and then locked up in his ‘private collection’. He was a menace, I’m glad he’s gone.” she finished venomously and then disappeared out the door. Remus and Sirius both sat shocked into silence. He had done that? Why?
Severus stepped forward, pouring it into a thin cup and then tipping it to Cadmael’s mouth whole took it without too much hassle. He gagged a bit, growling quietly.
Sirius nodded his sudden understanding before falling in line behind Harry and Remus as they all headed to the will reading. When they stepped into the room, and the doors closed behind them, they were surprised to see all the people that were summoned to the will reading. Severus Snape, Neville Longbottom, and his grandmother Augusta Longbottom, and, to his astonishment, Narcissa was there as well. Draco, however, was nowhere to be seen.
Bill nodded, his eyes switching from Minerva to Charlie who seemed distant. Harry chewed the inside of his cheek, wondering if he should inform them of the letter he and Draco had gotten before he disappeared. Remus seemed to notice his distress.
The dance of the leaves when the autumn winds blow
Harry snorted, “In your dreams maybe. I just need some rest. Between you and him, you’ve both sapped up most of my magic.”
Tatsuya suggested. Harry nodded at the shadowy figure in the mirror and then turned back to Ammit.
"Perfect, just letting my hair down," Draco stated before letting LeFay's hand go to head for his own clothes. LeFay eyed him warily but didn't say anything as he finished getting dressed.
Harry nodded vigorously when Ammit spoke about Kelpies. Oh yes, he had heard quite a lot about them.
So if you haven't read my other fanfiction, there is a notice there that both of these fanfictions are not dead. You can read my excuses there if you like, but basically (like all things) life happened. Ha, ha.
"It would seem they can tell you are on the verge. You do love torturing him don't you?" the darkness stated with a half-hearted chuckle. "Come, do not keep them hoping for the impossible," it soothed.
Hisashi sighed, “Go ahead and transform. I suggest spending more time in this form may help with your current mindset. I’m gathering that part of this is you still viewing yourself as a monster, and that these instincts of yours are evil in some way.” LeFay nodded and stood.
Harry had collapsed from exhaustion shortly after pulling himself from the depths of his dying mind, scaring everyone again, but this time Narcissa had assured everyone that it was in the clear. It was just taking time for his body and mind to recover. All the while Draco had never left his side, even when Severus half begged for him to at least come eat something. It ended up with Sev just bringing the food on a tray for the two of them. Though, Harry's food had to be spelled into his stomach while he slept.
“He used it on all of them?” McGonagall choked out as she looked over at the remains of the ex-Death Eaters.
Lord Harry LeFay cleared his throat, “We are gathered currently to duel out both punishment and to question one Cadmael Greyback, formerly known as Hati Greyback. Any objections?” The room remained quiet except for Cadmael ragged breathing. “Good, now, August, produce the evidence,” Harry commanded, waving his hand for August to step forward. “Severus, administer the Veritaserum.”
“Kreacher,” Remus called. The house-elf appeared with a pop and bowed.
Draco nodded.
“Okay, let’s see it what else you got under there?” she stated, her eyes turning into slits. Harry blushed as he tried to find the words to speak. “I can smell you,” she murmured before he even had the chance to come up with something believable. Harry was confused for a moment before the woman sighed and pointed at his behind. “I’m a werewolf, one of the few that can get a job nowadays,” she explained, “I knew who you where the moment you stepped into the door from how you smell,” she added.
LeFay locked eyes with Draco, his jaw tightening, "That I want you here, with me."
“What is it?” Harry asked in awe as the snake continued to uncover itself and flicked its tongue at Harry. The store man eyed Harry suspiciously and then crossed his arms over his chest.
LeFay gritted his teeth, feeling the wave of emotions coming from the arrowhead under his robes.
"You okay there?" Neville asked from across the room. Harry slowly held a thumbs up before pulling the curtains around his bed closed. He stretched slowly, careful of his chin now before grabbing his wand and casting his usual silencing charm around his bed. Ghost tilted his head as he watched Harry before the hyena shrugged and laid down at Harry's feet. Harry snuggled down into his blankets and set his wand to go off early so he could shower without any one else around to bother him in the morning.
“All in one blow. I didn’t know he was so-.”
Harry glanced at the hyena and then back at Dumbledore, his eyes pleading for a bit of help.
there was a pause; as if the kitsune was mulling something over.
He shook his head; no, he has to much resting on this. Determinedly he faced the forest. He had to find kitsune, and quickly. He obviously wasn’t in these fields of gold.
"No, nothing more. Goodnight Severus," Albus smiled at him. Severus bowed slightly and then turned, his cloak snapping behind him as he left. Albus' eyes darkened as he placed his hands together in front of himself, elbows on his desk. It seemed Severus had done a little too well with his choose of familiar for the Golden Boy. Hopefully this would not hurt his plans to much.
“Come in Lady Malfoy… Master Remus is waiting in the drawing room for you." Narcissa stepped inside and nodded in acknowledgment as Draco glanced around the Manor behind her. “This way,” Kreacher grumbled as he started towards the hall. Draco watched his mother follow, but took his own time to admire the decor of the house. He was surprised by the fact the place seemed, tasteful.
Remus was staring wide eyes at them before glancing back at Sirius.
"I think you're trying make me out to be more than I am," LeFay smirked, "You don't know what it was like."
“Wandless and wordless magic. Impressive,” Sirius stated from his spot at the kitchen island. Remus nodded as he stepped away from his adopted son, still looking him up and down. Sirius smirked and gave Harry a wink as Remus reached up to smooth out Harry’s collar. “Well, we really should get going Remus. It’s best to get the items we need as early as possible. Though, it is pretty late already. Lunch?” Sirius commented as he looked at the grandfather clock he could see in the front room. Remus nodded and headed back through the sitting room to their shared bedroom.
"Everyone!" August bellowed, glaring around the room as almost everyone shut up. It seemed to do the trick, only leaving Ashliegh and Douglas' conversation bare. They finished soon after noticing everyone was staring at them.
"Nope, just me and this guy," Harry stated as he patted Ghost's back. Ghost let out what sounding like a human grunt before he opened his lazy eyes to look over at Ron and Hermione. Harry watched the hyena snort and then close it's eyes again, completely ignoring his two friends.
Hogwart’s wards finally gave out, shattering with a loud boom. Harry and the others didn’t stop to figure out what caused it.
LeFay's gaze bored into Draco's, confusion written across his face. What was Draco trying to get at?
"Draco!" came a startled voice. Draco could hear table legs scrapping across the floor as he started to calm down, his head shaking as he looked up into the eyes of his father. "It's okay dragon. It was just a nightmare, are you okay?" Lucius asked as he stuck his hand out to his son.
Draco chuckled, eyes pacing the rest of the room. It was decorated in shades of silver and green, with dark ebony furniture to match, giving him a very Slytherin vibe.
“Ambassadors for the merpeople in Hogwart’s lake I think. For ambassadors they were talking an awful lot of smack about who they were representing and I just…,” Harry paused as he stabbed another apple piece with his finger nail and took a bite out of it, “If you don’t like who you are working for than you should quit. Not make their lives miserable by doing shit work for them. Same goes with if you were to fight along with someone or were someone like Voldemort,” Draco cringed at the name, “You would want loyal people that supported you, not someone that didn’t actually want to help you. Then you wouldn’t know when they would turn on you, or like those representatives, do a shit job,” Harry finished ranting.
“It’s a collar that appeared yesterday before I went to see McGonagall. There was a note in the box it came in that simply said ‘take care of him’,” Harry explained. He handed the collar to Severus. “It has a shrinking charm on it, along with a few other charms and a portkey, I have the other half of the portkey as well, but I can’t help but think it was meant for Draco,” he added.
LeFay is losing his temper with the way Tatsuya wants to run things, and possible having a traitor within their ranks is only making the problem worse. (Especially when that traitor might just be the flirting with your mate.)
“It’s been bothering me the whole time I’ve been here. When you said that you thought the collar would have broken off by now? Did that mean you didn’t care about the bond it represented?” he asked, huffing a little from the short sprint to catch LeFay before he stepped out the door.
Sirius pushed through the crowd and stopped when he saw Draco on his hands and knees; Snape kneeling beside him.
That only made it sound worse, Draco told himself.
Draco jumped as the vines and flowers started to wrap around him, roots grabbing around his legs till he was pushed out into the opening.
“As Narcissa already knows, Harry as claimed his titles and inheritance over the summer. He should have come into his inheritance when he turned seventeen but, like many other things we’ve learned, Albus Dumbledore seems to have meddled in things he shouldn’t have,” Sirius paused and rested his elbows on the table, knotting his hands together. “Because of this Harry has only just learned of his titles and what comes with it, so I ask that you two help him. As my sole heir at the moment, he needs to practice his manners and behavior around purebloods. We also have come to realize that a fair amount of people may be coming by the manner to pledge themselves to Potter on account of more than a few of titles. They are as follows; Lord Potter, Peverell, Gryffindor, Slytherin, and LeFay and of course Heir Black.”
"Wait, so how are you related to Potter?" Lucius asked.
“Well… You see, you know how I told you it wasn’t going so well,” she paused as she looked down at the floor, her eyes looking like they were starting to water. Theo looked down at her when she stopped speaking and placed a hand on top of her head.
LeFay stood there, glancing down at the dragon that now looked up at him in almost a concerned fashion. Harry lifted one of his paws and set it down gently on Draco’s snout, causing both of them to shiver. Closing his eyes again he dug deeper into the threads, leaning more on the one between him and Draco. He let his magic rest on it again, stroking it with his own magic, trying to think about what Hisashi had said. Sighing, he looked down the thread, deciding to follow it this time. It didn’t take remarkably long for Harry to find, what he guessed anyways, was Draco’s core. He smiled as the warm magic washed over him in waves, but he wasn’t sure if he’d really found what Hisashi wanted him to look for. Gently he placed his hand on the cord again, only this time he could feel it humm under his hand. He was surprised, and pressed further down the cord till he felt the connection point between Draco and himself.
Something shot through Harry, so many emotions at once. "Soul vow," he whispered, slowly turning. He stepped towards Draco, seeing the blonde's eyes light up.
“Turning you in will make me rich!” Seamus stated as he pointed his wand at Harry. There was a loud boom behind him, causing Seamus to look up. The horror on Seamus’ face was the last thing Harry saw as something giant and black flew over him, knocking Seamus to the floor. Harry sighed, closing his eyes even as he tried to fight off the darkness.
"It's late, you'd be better off staying here rather than finding your way back through the halls. I'm sure you'd get lost," LeFay said as he dropped Draco onto the bed.
“That was amazing Harry!” Bill stated and clapped a hand on Harry’s back. Harry smiled but didn’t take his eyes off the black dragon. Bill looked from Harry to the dragon; still drinking from the pool. He sighed and then squeezed Harry’s shoulder.
Harry could only barely nod before he drifted off.
I am the voice in the fields when the summer's gone
"Why?" Draco started to growl, "Why deny it when I brought it up then? Why put me, us, through that?!"
“Isn’t there a rule that you twats are supposed to have an escort?”
“African Violet, to protect those I swear allegiance too. Bay Leaf, to purify our bond. Agrimony, for overcoming any fears that may prohibit my ability to serve. Ash, for health. An Iris Flower, for wisdom, so that I may be of service to those I ally with. And Lavender, so that we may always find peace. With these I pledge my allegiance and loyalty to Lord Potter Peverell Gryffindor Slytherin LeFay; Heir to house Black,” Draco kept his eyes on the alter as he spoke and lit the flame. Harry handed Draco the athame and he cut his palm, dripping his blood onto the flames. “To this day, until my death, I solemnly swear.” The fire flared again, this time turning into a deep violet.
Everyone was glancing between themselves, wondering what exactly was happening. Wasn’t this enough?
Harry could feel the eyes scouring his body as Draco just sat there staring. He swallowed. He felt like an animal being appraised before being shipped off to who knows where. Then the door opened behind Draco and Narcissa appeared, followed closely by a very worried looking Remus and Sirius. “Lord LeFay, are you okay?” Narcissa asked as she stepped around her son and helped Harry to his feet. “Draco, you shouldn’t just be sitting there,” she chimed.
“Harry! This is Draco’s scarf! That means we can find him and he’s probably still out there!” Theo exclaimed. Harry seemed to brighten instantly and stood, wrapping the blanket around him.
LeFay sipped his own tea and then set the empty cup down.
he said,
"I was actually just leaving. The door opened earlier and I wanted to see what was inside it. I wasn't aware-."
Sirius crossed his arms over his chest and pouted. “Now, now, boys. Let’s get back to the reason we are all here. Please take your seats,” McGonagall said. The others all took seats around it. “Bill has informed me that Padma won't tell him what her sisters creature inheritance; do to being sworn to secrecy by her parents. However, she did say that Harry would probably be able to speak to Parvati if that was the form she was in,” Minerva stated.
“I don’t have a creature inheritance but I’m betting its connected,” he stated. “Everything else I’m not sure about. He also has physical wounds that look bad. I think the centaurs attacked him and Parvati when they crossed into their territory. I can’t get close enough to mend them or pull out what’s left,” Charlie explained.
Draco stood at the attic door, wondering why Harry had ever chosen to live up here. The boy-who-lived was definitely insane. He knocked and waited for a response, only to get a muffled few words. He heard Harry shuffling over to the door and crossed his arms over his chest as he waited. He froze when the door opened, completely stunned. He couldn’t help but stare, his eyes wandering from Harry’s face to his bare chest and the scars that lingered there. Draco’s mind instantly wanted to fill in the blanks. What or who had made them?
"Harry became a horcrux on the night of Lily's death," Narcissa answered so her love didn't have to. Lucius grunted in response, leaving space between him and his former wife so he didn't crowd her.
If it wasn’t from fighting Voldemort, then who? As if knowing Draco would ask for more Harry stood and pulled off his shirt before turning around. Draco inhaled sharply, choking on air when he saw Harry’s back. His back was completely covered in horrible wounds, many more than those on his front. The raised, burnt, scarred flesh made it almost impossible to imagine how the skin must have looked before.
“Oh… Wait, I didn’t even know you two knew each other,” Harry said as he looked between them. Theo chuckled and then shifted his armful of books.
LeFay's upset, cause fucking everything! Why? Because he has a stick up his ass.
“Well at first I was going to do it by hand when I remembered a bit of wandless magic Hermione taught me for stitching. I don’t remember the incantation or anything but when I thought about it hard enough it started working,” he proudly explained.
“Well, that is a predicament. Any plans?”
Harry felt guilty about what had happened, if he hadn't done what he did to Draco, if he hadn't suspected Draco being a death eater maybe this all wouldn't have happened.
The attackers turned tail and ran, some sliding around before being able to disappear out of sight.
The dragon huffed.
"Your obvious dislike for the boy," Dumbledore replied like that answered everything.
“Guests?”
"Let me, Severus please!"
"It's okay, shhhh, it's okay, I'm here," Draco said softly as he wrapped the blanket around him and stroked his back. "Some water and food please?" he said over his shoulder. Lucius and Severus turned, bumping into each other for a moment before heading out to fullfill the request.
Harry said, still chuckling quietly to himself. Ammit hissed at him, displeased with his master’s antics. ‘
His eyes glowing in sync with the monster's as he spoke, “My name is
“We should call you Prongs, in honor of your father,” Remus stated, smiling. Sirius nodded, and wrapped an arm around Remus’ shoulders.
“Yes, based on how badly his memory has been tampered with, I fear he might start to break into insanity. I need your permission and help, to add him to our bond, that should stabilize him. My magic, by itself, would overwhelm him, but with you being the buffer,” he stopped and looked down at Draco. The other’s couldn’t see but there was a pleading expression behind those stoic eyes.
“If that’s all we really should be going McGonagall,” Charlie stood and then put his chair back with its respective desk. Bill got up as well, looking back at the table for a moment before bowing to the headmistress.
“But this year, he had his inheritance, he didn’t seem that different!” Neville interrupted, hopeful.
“We’ll begin the search immediately, Draco.” Severus placed his hand on his godson’ shoulder, hopefully giving him some needed reassurance.
The room burst out laughing as Ghost only seemed to look more triumphant with his handy work. Harry however wasn't amused. He turned to Dean who was laughing the hardest, "What exactly happened?" Harry asked.
“What is it Harry? We need to get started on our preparations,” she asked as she looked at him over her spectacles.
Draco fired spell after spell behind him, even placing down a few tripping jinxs. Anything to quickly slow the mob behind him. He stopped for a moment, looking around for a way out of the woods. That’s when he heard it, the low humming of someone singing again.
LeFay felt a hand cover his mouth as he tried to object.
“Only the estates and such going to Harrison, but we’ve already discussed most of it,” he told the goblin.
“Hopefully that doesn’t happen,” Snape stated. “Either way that seems like the fastest way to get him over here instead of stuck behind my godson’s tail.”
“Severus, calming draught now!” Charlie snapped. Severus rushed over and handed it to him which Charlie instantly loaded the syringe with. Harry stood frozen to the spot, long Kitsune ears flattening to the back of his head. Charlie finally got the thick needle in between Draco’s scales and injected it. Sighing Charlie sat down as the dragon settled down, giant eyes closing.
LeFay sneered. His gaze flicked over to the mirror hanging on the wall when Draco pointed out that he wasn’t alone. Tatsuya stood in the mirror's reflection, his eyes turning to look at LeFay. Without thinking LeFay's magic formed like a whip and shattered the mirror. The pieces falling to the floor with a loud clatter.
“Now Harry, those are all good suggestions, but what do you want it to look like?” Regulus asked, “Did you have anything in mind?”
“Wish we could talk to him before this fight but rules are rules. Maybe I can get that shitface to reveal what he did to LeFay during the fight. What do you think? You ready to kick some ass Jariss?” Draco asked aloud. The fighting roar he got in response within his mind made him smile as he reached for the door and headed out to the main yard for the duel. Guards trailing after him.
"Will you not answer?" the voice questioned. Harry closed his eyes again, listening to the faint echo. He thought he heard people speaking right beside his ear but he couldn't make it out. Some one...someone was sobbing.
Harry and Severus both jumped to their feet, wands drawn as the battle rolled into another room. "Harry! Stay here!" Snape snapped as he ran around the door frame that lead into his small kitchen. In the middle of the floor was a bloodied and shaking Ghost, teeth barred as he corned what had tried to attack Severus. It was a snake, and Severus recognized it immediately. "Nagini!" he snarled before he blasted the snake. Green left the end of his wand, hitting the snake squarely in the face. She laid still for the longest time as both Draco and Snape caught their breaths.
“A vampire?... Nah. I’m an Incubus," he chuckled, "An energy feeder. Luna’s been helping me out a lot. Is it true about you though? There are rumors about you claiming your titles and inheritance, but I didn’t think it would change you this much. What happened?” Neville asked.
LeFay sat in the throne-like chair that was pulled out from him to watch from the balcony overlooking the main yard. Normally it would be where everyone trained but everyone else was busy clearing the space for the duel between Cadmael and Draco.
Ghost seemed to roll his eyes and made a scoffing noise, like he couldn't believe Harry thought he was on that level.
Tatsuya and LeFay shared a mental stare before they spoke, “It’s Draco Malfoy. He showed up this morning before the sun even had a chance to rise... He still had the collar,” they explained, looking guiltily at Hisashi.
"Technically seven?" Lucius asked, confused as he sat down beside Narcissa.
Harry was torn, his nails digging hard into his palms as he glared down at Cadmael. His attention was drawn by the quick movement of Draco’s wand, and he found himself leaping up from his chair as Draco fired a spell straight into the face of Cadmael while he was looking up at LeFay. There was a massive wave of magic as the two were thrown from each other. LeFay was already leaping over the banister as both men laid prone on the ground. Severus ran for Draco, propping Draco’s head up with his knee as he quickly looked over his godson.
“Did he ask you to get close to me?”
LeFay sat down on this thrown, nails clicking against the arm rest in irritation. Ammit should have been here by now.
“Thanks for having some faith in me,” he said while he hugged Draco before letting go and heading out the door to his last class of the day.
Draco blushed, turning to watch Harry leave and then clearing his throat. “Mother was definitely right about him maturing nicely…,” Draco muttered, then caught himself, “Stop it Draco, that’s gross. And he is straight you know that,” Draco chided himself as he got everything ready for his own class and headed out.
“Chill Theo. This one is still learning, I’m sure you’ll find a perfect mate for yourself, and one that’s not Harry Potter,” Draco stated. Harry didn’t catch it but Draco’s eyes flashed violet for a moment as he glared at Theo. Theo lowered his gaze and waved them off.
Harry finds a place he can relax while regretting not being able to talk to Draco more.
"Draco, that's not you talking and you know it. Get a hold of yourself and think logically," Severus knelt not to far from Draco now, pleading for his godson to look at him. He need to make sure Draco's mind was still in contact. The powers they where playing with right now where older. Much older than even the first recorded magical history. This was as old as the universe itself, not something to take lightly.
"Harry... If I had wanted that version of you I wouldn't be here."
Harry want's to see Draco's room and his flower garden.
Harry knew that was definitely true. He sat there for a moment, staring up at Tatsuya who tilted his head. “Why did you chose… What you chose to sing,” he asked and blinked up at him. The Kitsune seemed confused for a moment before it too sat down, still looking down at Harry.
The doors to the main hall banged open as Draco emerged, head held high as he made his way into the dueling area. Horns, wings and talons fully bared and adorned in the ritualistic garb appropriate to the contentment. On the other side stood Cadmael, a massive muscle and fur covered jaguar warrior werebeast in every way. Draco was taken by surprise, he’d honestly never known that such a non human existed but, now remembering the tails of jaguar godly warriors being worshiped in South America way back when made sense. Honestly if he’d just been a muggle he’d probably thought the man standing before him was some kind of warrior god too.
"Who was that?' Harry asked quizzically.
“Indeed,” LeFay stated, looking back at Draco, “You’re also a Black. Like me,” he added, stepping down to Draco's level.
“Master Malfoy?” Dinky said.
"Of course," he turned to leave and paused, "Tom may come in later. He is Harrison's great uncle after all."
Potter was the first to wake in the house, yet, he continued to lay on his back; simply staring at the attic ceiling. Sleeping last night had been hard, especially with the three tails slapping around in his bed. He finally sat up, yawned, and then climbed out bed to stretch. He stopped in front of the mirror to stare at himself.
“I’m guessing you wanted to talk,” he drawled, still tense and irritated about the whole event. He understood LeFay very little now. What was he trying to get at with all this back and forth. It frustrated him so, seeing his godson’s heart break and not able to do anything about it. He couldn’t even hex the man causing it.
Harry nodded and then turned away from the mirror.
August nodded with a sigh, “I believe Lord Prince took him to his quarters for treatment, something about making sure there wouldn’t be any blood infection or permanent damage to Lord Malfoy’s face,” he answered. LeFay nodded and turned to leave just as August spoke again, “I won’t pretend to understand your relationships but, what do you want me to tell the others in your council?”
“What? Charlie is right. It’s honestly his choice,” Sirius sighed, looking back at Harry with a small grin on his face.
Lucius stood in the drawing room beside the fire, his eye lingering on the flames. Narcissa sat on the sofa to the right of him with a cup of wine held in her hand, sipping it quietly.
LeFay’s eyes narrowed at the sudden question. Or maybe it wasn’t so sudden?
“Basically, you’re like a prince in both the wizarding community and creature community,” Sirius stated proudly, earning him very quick glare from Remus.
“Everyone else, leave and prepare, this is our chance to move. I doubt Albus would have reasoned that we Cadmael would bend this fast. Not with how much pride he takes in his spells,” Harry growled. There was a cacophony of pops and cracks as people apparate out of the room, leaving only Severus, Draco, and Harry.
He nodded and stood up, walking out of bushes and towards the Death Eaters.
And as always! Thanks for reading!
Hisashi’s brows lifted before his head tilted to the left. “The two of you are at odds?”
“You may be in awe now, but whatever spells he got hit with, or cursed with, is keeping him from returning to normal. If he stays like that for too long, like any other magically inherited creature, he’ll stay like that forever,” she snapped. The group went quiet, most of them staring off into the fire.
“What's with the faces?” Harry asked as he finished shifting back and straightening his clothes. Severus was just about to speak up when Bill cut in.
"Two days Harry."
Draco walked ahead of Harry as they stepped into the drawing room, his eyes falling onto the alter in the middle of the room. He glanced at his mother who smiled at him but remained standing off to the side with Remus.
“Lord LeFay thought that it would be nice if you were near the terrace and garden. The Black Manor doesn’t have a large flying space so he thought he’d try his best to get you at least some outside space,” Kreacher stated. Draco tilted his head. Lord LeFay? Who was that?
Draco woke early, his eyes cloudy. Severus and his mother wouldn’t be awake yet, which gave him the perfect opportunity to leave without them trying to stop him. He had to know. He always had to know. Even if it did lead to a dead end, he had to know.
“Well, not exactly. I’m sure a lot of creatures won’t recognize the sent like I did. You just had bad luck.”
There. Draco stopped fast in his tracks. It was faint, oh so faint. Nails dug into hardwood and stone as Draco flipped around the edge of a staircase, blood splattering as he loped up the staircase. He was panting as he got to the top, never mind the frantic calling of Severus and now his mother from below as the ran after him. The floor switched to carpet and he could feel himself weakening as he stumbled. He had to get to Harry though, he had too! He pushed the door open to his right with his nose. When it didn't budge he started ramming it with his body, his mouth become bloody as he tore at the door. Finally he made a hole and squeezed through just as someone tried to grab him. The door flew open and he stopped in his tracks, looking up at a very human looking Voldemort.
"You're feelings?" LeFay questioned. This was getting interesting, he knew Draco had seemed overly attached to the amethyst studded collar around his neck.
“This big boy kept escaping the cages they’d kept ‘em in, so as punishment they tried starving him. Trying to treat him like your average snake they were, that was till he popped ‘em,” he chuckled and grinned. “They brought him back after that, wouldn’t even tell me why till another couple came in and told me ‘bout it.”
Harry blinked at him, what did he just say?
“Harry is gone," Severus said quietly, keeping his voice low, "He using the killing curse on the ex-Death Eaters and then vanished with the Elderwand.”
“I guess,” he finally gave in and grabbed a piece of parchment and his quill. “I need to tell Severus what has happened.”
he stated,
he hissed. Harry took it as laughing.
“Harry! What are you doing walking the halls by yourself!” Hermione exasperated as Theo turned so she could see around him.
"My'Lord, you need to get that looked at, Severus," came Narcissa's voice. Voldemort shook his head as Narcissa went to drag Severus to his feet.
“Technically, he isn’t a child,” Charlie noted as he was looking through a note book and then slipped it into his pocket. “Harry’s creature inheritance is a Kitsune correct? And the power output he has is something to be jealous of. Since Kitsunes are basically royalty in the creature society we might be able to use that to our advantage. The dragon might be willing to negotiate, or at least won’t try to kill us on first sight.”
Going over the plans going further is gunna be a bit more of a jumbled mess than they realize. Plus it doesn't help that Harry is one stubborn kid.
In one swift movement Draco had cut him off as he placed a kiss to LeFay's lips. He felt a shiver down his spine as he made contact, and arms wrapped around him; holding him tightly to Harry's body.
"Yes. Inside the envelopes at each of your seats is actually a copy of the most recent information we have gathered," the group started to pull out the information, "As you can see, Albus Dumbledore is most clearly alive and with having used his brother as a scapegoat, we aren't sure for how long. Ammit has been sent out to ascertain the identity of current owner of Hog's Head, and just how long said person has been there. From there we will at least have the beginnings of a timeline. The only real option we have right now is to continue what we have been doing for the past five years," just as LeFay finished explaining the bickering started. He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose, wondering how he'd gotten to this point. They all use to get along so well.
Bill nodded and went to go get the door. He was instantly rushed by Remus and Sirius as they made their way over to the bed. Both turned into mother hens and started doting on Harry, looking him over and asking if he was okay. The other four adults started to head out, not wanting to get in the way of the family.
LeFay cut in, "I told you I could break it-"
Soon the trio ended up outside at the back of the LeFay castle.
“Oh, no, don’t be shy,” Hisashi purred, and Draco felt claws on the back off his neck, gently wrapping around his jaw till it tilted his head up, forcing him to stare into the golden eyes above him. “Stay a while, perhaps you’ll be able to convince our
He felt some emotion he couldn't place wash over him as Draco looked up at him.
"That's the last of everything we have to report on our end," Douglas stated before bowing his end. Holding this kneeling position took a toll on everyone after a while but, like everyone else, they didn't want to disturb their Lord while in one of his moods. Everyone in the room could feel it, even Draco who stood at the end of the hall by the double doors. LeFay hadn't permitted him to be closer due to him possibly becoming a distraction to his circle members. The question's they'd ask if LeFay had Draco at his feet would have been non stop.
Draco tried to look apologetic but just couldn't force it out. He had seen what Fenrir was capable of when the man was alive, and the name still made him sick to his stomach. Hati seemed to understand though.
Severus huffed and grinned, "Add it to the potion now."
Then save me, save...

“If Shibee is unneeded Shibee will leave and then come back in half an hour to escort Lord LeFay and Mister Malfoy down to the Great Hall,” Shibee stated as she pulled her hands behind her back. Harry turned around and nodded at Shibee, who disappeared with a pop.
There was a moment of silence while Hermione shrunk and her clothes fell around her. After a minute all that remained was a pile of clothes where Hermione once stood.
“May I inquire as to why Albus is present?” Augusta said shrewdly.
Snape's head snapped up, eyes narrowing. He was impressed Harry had done some reading. "No, not enough," Severus shook his head, gripping the table. Tears started to spill down the professors cheeks, what would Lucius do when he found out he'd killed his son. That he'd let Draco die in his care.
"So, what is this thing doing here? We saw you talking to Snape and Dumbledore at supper but, Dumbledore cast a silencing charm around you guys," Ron asked.
The wizard, Douglas had been thrown out of his family for practicing dark arts not to long ago, and he had quickly earned LeFay's trust. Enough to put him along side LeFay's generals at least.
Draco nodded the best he could before groaning and pulling his knees up to his chin. This had to be the worst idea ever.
I am the voice in the wind and the pouring rain
"Welcome Ashleigh, Lady of Shadows. Late as always I see," LeFay spoke, eyeing the vixen from his seat.
Je veux m'enfuir que tout recommence
Harry woke in the dark, the floor felt wet beneath him and as he stood he could feel the liquid between his toes. Looking around as his eyes adjusted he paused as his eyes met grey ones. Below him, looking back at him through the floor was Draco. His hands where in fists as he banged against the invisible barrier between them, bubbles of red coming from his mouth as he screamed. Harry jumped to the floor, feeling his legs and arms hit the barrier. The jolt knocked him unconscious and when he woke again Draco's eyes where dull, dead.
Draco nodded, but his focus wasn’t on the conversation. It was set on letting his eyes wander over LeFay’s body.
Draco continued the day shoveling through the leaning tower of paper, writing out stocks and order forms one after the other. He was glad that he had something to keep his mind off the search for LeFay, but as hours passed he'd still end up thinking about him. When he did finally get to the end of the stack, he felt very pleased with himself. He stood and straightened out his robes before heading out to relax in the sitting room.
“What’s a Kitsune?” Draco asked as he shifted in his seat. Talking about Harry was giving him a weird vibe.
Harry sat on his bed, tired from today’s classes. Even with the time he took to try and get closer to his ‘true form’ it didn’t seem like it was going anywhere. He even skipped supper along with lunch, taking both in his room. He sighed as Ammit stared at him from inside his cocoon of blankets. Harry cast a tempus charm to check the time, scoffing at it.
The next day approached and Tom had already gone over everything with Harry. They would arrive early to the will reading and be taken to a separate room as everyone else started to show. This way they would be able to observe the others that came to attend, but also keep Harry safe.
“If the owner dies than the ring usually appears to the declared heir or back to the family’s vault,” Harry stated. Remus and Sirius both stared at him like he had grown a second head. “You didn’t know?” he asked. How could they not know that? It was one of the few things Harry had learned after starting to read up on Pureblood History and Policies.
Or has he? Something's going on here and Harry LeFay Potter has a feeling everything with this betrayal may not be what it seems.
He pulled himself out his thoughts when Harry paused at the ‘pet store’, his eyes going wide. “This is our next stop?” Harry asked excitedly.
Harry was confused, turning his head to look over himself, his tails moved with him, curling towards him so he could see them. They were longer now, almost trailing on the ground and his fur was the same. His antlers felt a bit heavier as well, but not by much. “Most of the time, when one first transforms it is the first stage of ones animagus form. The more you go back and forth the more your animal, or in this case creature, self catches up with you. With magical creatures, this happens even more,” McGonagall explained. “So, he is probably grown a bit since his first transformation.”
Draco was about to turn around when he caught the tail end of their heated conversation.
“What are you yelling for?” Harry grumbled as he finished cleaning out one of his ears and then crossed his arms over his chest.
The way he leaned away from Draco at the moment. The way his green eyes shimmered in the fire light...the way his hands continued to shake.
“Winky I want you to deliver this letter to Snape. Make sure you aren’t followed,” Winky took the letter, bowed, and left, “Dinky, why don’t you take Lord Malfoy some tea and a few snacks before dinner and make them meaty. I’m sure with the stress he’s been under these last few years his diet has suffered."
“What am I?” he asked as he looked back at his adopted fathers.
“So, Kristian. What are you thinking?” he asked as he looked down at her from the stool he stood on. Kristian tilted her head as she finished her circle around him, holding up her fingers like a camera frame. It had been an hour since they had started and it almost seemed like they had gotten nowhere. He hoped Sirius was taking his time shopping.
,” he said and flicked his tongue out. Harry smiled.
“Mother you can’t really-.”
“How long did you know?” Severus questioned quietly.
she paused again with a slight smirk,
McGonagall looked between her two former students.
"Harrison, is a very strong man. You will be proud when he wakes My'Lord," Severus said softly.
It did have a mouth, he realized as it spoke, but it was a jagged line spawning part of its neck and head, glowing green from within. He had to looked away from it, not because of fear, but the utter defeat surrounding him. It seemed to feel the sadness and disappointment coming from Harry as it leaned its head forward and pressed its face again Harry’s. Harry smiled slightly, unsure and still terrified.

'We forgot about the full moon tonight!' LeFay smacked the next wolf out of the way with his antlers, trying his best not to do fatal damage. Suddenly he felt his control slip as Tatsuya yanked LeFay to the back of their mind.
Harry was gone by the time Draco cleaned himself up.
Song Inspiration: Villain of my Own Story by Unlike Pluto.
Harry deflated and plopped down onto arse.
year at Hogwarts, and he hoped that everything would be as great as today had been.
"A Stripped Hyena," Hermione translated, "An albino one by the looks of it."
Vient la douleur.
Harry nodded and then laid beside Draco's animagus body along the table. Taking a breath he closed his eyes and nodded. "I'm ready."
"That would have been Lord Malfoy, and I am astonished that not even the vampires in the room seemed to piece the hair and outfit together."
“As for the custody of one Harrison James Potter, until he came of age, listed here are seven people. Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy, Alice and Frank Longbottom, along with his godfathers; Sirius Black, Severus Snape, and Regulus Black,” Ulkalb looked down sternly at the group, and then fixed an angry glare on Albus. “As per Lily Potter’s wish he is in
“Well. It would seem your brother Regulus left you a note attached to the block," Baxeka stated as he moved the paper around, "Let me see. Ah."
Just as the door closed, the cup feel of the table. Breaking in half just as it hit the floor.
William shook his head and sighed, "I pray you don't jump to conclusions Douglas."
“What happened?!” he heard a frantic McGonagall yell. The rest of the wizards and witches defending Hogwarts spilling through the gates behind her.
Harry nodded slowly as Sirius released him. “I will,” he said as he patted his father’s shoulder and continued in the direction of Malkin’s. When he got there, he was surprised to see the shop almost completely empty. He glanced around for a moment before catching the attention of an employee. Her eyes fell instantly onto Harry’s legs. “Seems kind of slow today,” he stated and furrowed his brow. The woman sighed and nodded her head but her eyes never seemed to leave his legs.
August raised an eyebrow, agreeing with William silently. LeFay wasn't the one to call anything in last minute.
Tatsuya's mind was stunned, giving LeFay a chance to gain control again. He could feel blood flowing down their back and Harry braced himself for the next attack only to hear a loud roar above them. Looking up he saw something block out the moon just before it landed on top of them; he was sure they would be crushed.
Harry grumbled and put his head in his hands, sighing. He could try to dissolve his tails but he’d only been able to hold his concentration for ten minutes before they appeared again. He needed more practice or a wardrobe that accommodated his extra appendages. That gave him an idea.
“You know, when I saw you I almost didn’t recognize you,” Bill stated before heading forward again. Harry trotted after him.
“What?” Cadmael glanced at him, eyes narrowing, “What did you say you sack of shit?” he growled, kicking Draco in the ribs.
Albus had managed to escape death. Aberforth's disintegrated corpse, where Albus should have been, was solid proof of that. Knowing what he knew now he wondered how the man got away with it all. There had to be someone else backing him. Who though? And not only who but why set up Tom Riddle like he had and then have Harry destroy him. Had Riddle known something?
"No. No, you're not wrong."
When they got to the kitchen it was all but abandoned, only a note lay next to some sweet rolls on the counter. Draco walked past it to the coldbox, opening it to look for something he could drink.
Draco was panting now from the exertion it was taking to try to stand on all four of his furry legs. When he felt Severus' hand on his shoulder he had half a mind to take it off at the joint, but the look on Severus' face made him instantly relax and he sat back down on his hind quarters.
"Oh, alright, but that means everyone else has to do it too!" Hermione exclaimed as she slipped off the bed. There was a groan from the other three, but it was all in good fun. "For me it's rather easy, I don't know how it is for you guys since your's are your inheritances," she explained. The other three nodded as she spoke but didn't say anything.
Hisashi thought over it for a moment before smiling brightly, “Well. If it is True, then, it won't matter even if you were a fly and him a frog.”
Albus watched Severus closely as he spoke, his hand lifting to his beard, stroking it slowly. "I see you're point now, but honestly I didn't think you would be so intensive in choosing such an animal," he stated.
“Hmm, does it have something to do with your new mate?”
“Huh?”
"Professor, isn't the potion classroom the other direction?"
Snape's brow lifted as though Albus had just started speaking Gobbledegook. "So, you are accusing me of possibly putting him in danger with something he couldn't handle on purpose just to hurt him?" Severus questioned, though it was more of statement.
"Cheat," Harry mumbled.
Skoll stepped into the light of the sun, a grim smile on his face, "Hati, what are you doing? Don't tell me you are pestering new-." Skoll stopped when he caught sight of Draco, eyebrows lifting. "Lord Malfoy..."
“If Albus is still alive then I fear he might be making a push to continue with what he was planning while he was alive,” LeFay said, cutting into Draco’s thoughts.
Jariss responded.
Tatsuya yawned. Harry smiled and then looked over both of his dads, smiling best he could at them still. Sirius smiled back and then went to hug him as McGonagall went to talk to Charlie and Bill.
“Thank you Hisashi. We seem to be getting the hang of it now,” the two said as one. Switching their weight from one leg to the other the raven coated Kitsune sat.
“Velvet black midnight, little time till day…Crescent Moon Maiden, warm colors in lighter shades.” Harry’s eyes widened. He remembering the poem! It that was in Draco’s book!
“You’ve got to be joking, mother.”
“Lord Potter, Peverell, Gryffindor, Slytherin, LeFay.”
He lifted his head, confused for a moment.
Harry leaned over to his night stand and grabbed his own class list, setting it on the table so they could compare.
“Hogwarts?” Harry asked as he lifted his intent focus from his waffles, complete and utter confusion on his face.
He was confused, but didn’t say anything else as the man took the collar to the back to add the protections and portkey to it. He brought it back out and then handed it to Harry.
"Fine.  We should be leaving though, there is another circle meeting this morning and Ammit should be returning shortly," LeFays stated as he stood, dusting any crumbs off himself. "I wanted you to attend. Perhaps you'll be able to add some incite the other cannot." Draco nodded and stood, following LeFay out of the room.
“I knew you weren’t a muggle, the stench of magic is all over you.”
The comment froze Draco was as he sat up, his eyes glued to the bed he was sure Harry was in. Something in the back of the mind wondered why he wanted to be guarding Harry with his very life as well. Of course, Harry was his, no one else's. It was obvious.
“It is nothing you should concern yourself with,” Snape stated, glowering at the other two.
Ghost. This isn't a chapter, just some art!
Harry woke in a panic, clutching at his chest as pain continued to echo through him; making him felt faint as his stomach threatened to turn sour.  His eyes took time to adjust to the darkness but he managed to spot a crack of light coming from a half-opened door. Hushed voices drifted in from the opening, and he stood to investigate. As he took a step forward he wobbled and crashed into the nightstand, causing a cup of water to fall to the floor with a dull thud. The hushed voices stopped and Harry could feel a cold sweat begin to set on. He tried to take another step only to fall again, barely catching himself this time just before his face hit the floor.
“I thought poetry is meant to make you use your imagination?” he grumbled. Draco shrugged as he set the book aside.
he stated. Harry huffed and chewed on the inside of his cheek. He could feel the kitsune moving around, feel its muscles rolling under his own. The kitsune seemed surprised, and a bit tickled when it spoke again,
“No, we aren’t,” they both stated together. The emerald eyes shimmered as they smiled. “We just didn’t expect this, nor his request to get to know us better.” Harry and Tatsuya exchanged a knowing look in their mental room while in Kitsune form.
Draco stood silently in the doorway. His knees still wobbling upon hearing LeFay’s voice. His collar hummed against his neck and joy sprouted from his chest. Draco couldn’t believe he’d found him. Harry LeFay was standing right in front of him! Yet, he looked so different: older,
Harry couldn’t believe it, he had finally gone crazy, he was hearing voices.
Draco lifted himself up onto his elbows, watching LeFay dress as the robe slid over his back, barely catching on the raised flesh. "How many of those are new?" Draco asked, eyes squinted into slits.
Oh ma douce souffrance
Harry came skating around the corner, dropping the vials and jars a little to hard on the table. "Shouldn't we change him back?" Harry asked, his eyes scanning the bloody fur.
Had it been just a wizard duel anything close to deadly would be illegal but since they were both magical creatures the laws didn’t apply. He felt a deep understanding for the godfather, he could only imagine that his fear mirrored LeFay’s own. That Cadmael would win and take the chance to eliminate Draco for good. He didn’t look all that strong, but there was a reason beastmen like Cadmael were seen as great warriors. They had the advantage of being both man and beast at the same time, those like Harry and Draco didn’t. It was either one or the other, there was no inbetween. Even those that were closely linked to beastmen like werewolves lost their human logic to a point during their shift. Beastmen didn’t.
The man coughed, “That’s going to be pretty expensive kid. You gunna be able to pay for it?”
“You don’t think he could have smelled a singular scent that set him off instead?" Theo asked, "If what I’m thinking is correct that could have been why he went into attack mode. Over stimulation, I feel like, would ahve sent him into more of a flight response,” Theo explained as he went over to Harry’s and Draco’s desk, scrambling through papers.
Groaning he let his face land on the desk, his hands moving up to rub the back of his head. He couldn’t get the stupid nightmare from last night out of his head. Six years and the events that day still haunted him. The creature, the ashes, him and the faceless Harry.
Tatsuya said within LeFay's mind. He was amused and LeFay could see the shadowy form of his self smirk beside him.
Hermione seemed surprised by that answer, and Draco noticed. "You didn't tell me that last night," Hermione pointed out, her voice raising slightly. Draco would have frowned if her could. Why did it matter to Hermione who he tutored with? Harry seemed to be thinking the same thing as his eyebrows rose. "I only mean, is it because of you-know-who?" she whispered. Ginny by that time had gone back to the book she was reading and if Draco knew anything he'd say she'd started sulking.
The two disappeared as Draco tried to move through the heavy atmosphere. A loud resounding crack followed by a laughter sounding their departure.
Severus looked at Draco sadly before both apparated away.
Draco tried moving towards Harry but felt himself frozen to the spot; fear starting to take hold as the world came into focus. Beside Harry stood a monstrous creature, and Draco swore it smiled at him.
Sur ce chemin en ton absence
"Let me know when you want to go again," LeFay joked, a smirk on his face. Draco blushed and then returned the smirk as he rolled, pinning LeFay under him.
“Well… Since Alchemy got out early and Neville and Luna had to leave for their one-on-one tutors I was left by myself. Everyone was acting weird so I decided to go ahead to the room Draco and I share. I know it was against the rules, but I didn’t really feel comfortable where I was. I ran into Theo and Hermione on my way to the class and they asked if I wanted them to walk me there, and I declined. Which honestly, knowing what happened it would have been better if I did,” Harry sighed and then lifted a hand to rub his forehead.
“I don’t know why you’re so upset. It’s just sharing a bed,” he stated nonchalantly as he stroked Ammit’s head. While Harry set up Ammit's enclosure Draco went ahead and put up Bubo's perch as well. He'd hate having to deal with the grumpy bird if he didn't.
Neville and Luna where snickering behind them, grinning. "It's your turn now Theo, since you embarrassed poor Herm," Harry stated as he crossed his arms. Herm nodded from behind his leg and sat with her tail flicking. Theo groaned and then nodded, but smirked a little. Harry lifted his eyebrows slightly.
“He’s a dragon, and you are a kitsune. While he may be stronger physically, you should be stronger within. Dominate him,” Hisashi growled, irritated that his pupil wasn’t listening.
Remus continued. “The others where on specific abilities; including your creature inheritance, animagus abilities, and parseltongue abilities. Which by the way, you’re parseltongue ability did not come from Voldemort like Albus said. You are in fact related to Salazar Slytherin. Distantly… but it’s there.”
“Where is Lord Black and his heir?” she asked. “I heard from a few rumors that Mister Potter claimed quite a few titles over the last few days.”
Harry turned his head to Ammit who nodded as they walked to his first class.
Ammit stopped, chuckling at how mesmerized Harry looked as he was listening to the story.
Narcissa lifted her eyebrows in surprise. She hadn’t known this. She thought that Hogwarts had always been this way. “Why did Albus change the rules?” Narcissa asked, though she was sure Sirius and Remus wanted to ask the same question.
“Well, that was… Informative,” Remus stated as he lifted his head, placing his hand on Harry’s shoulder. Sirius chuckled and shook his head as he looked over at Lupin.
"He's fine, you saved him. Now you need to wake up. He's worried sick about you," Harry smiled gently. Draco looked confused, and then pulled away.
“Can’t you chill?” Harry asked in-between taking another bite of his food. All he got back was, what he thought was, a tail thump. Harry rolled his eyes and finished eating, stretching and glancing around his room.
"Yes Draco? I'm right here, keep looking at me. Get your head on straight and start controlling your emotions. You'll be no use to him if you keep yourself in this state," Severus stated softly, trying to sooth the wild look in Draco's animalistic eyes.
Yet, now that they stood in the hall outside the headmaster’s staircase while Sirius and Narcissa talked to Minerva McGonagall and he couldn’t help but stare.
Douglas snorted, "You really think he'd call a meeting over one person?"
“Severus went over some of it, but basically he pointed out the fact I haven’t actually embraced being what I am, what we are,” Harry stated, looking up at Hisashi.
"HELLO?!" Harry tried again, this time cupping his hands around mouth. He ignored the eyes above him watching him as he listened.
“We have a plan, but we are going to need your help, with him like this we’ll need someone to bear as a witness since we won’t be able to do the full ritual,” Draco stated as he pulled out the small bowl and knife they’d brought, along with a long vile filled with a potion Severus instantly recognized.
"How could we let this happen," Severus choked back the urge to break the chair he sat in. He wanted to slaughter the people that did this to a child. "Why didn't he ask for help?" Severus asked.
LeFay chose not to respond as the doors behind his subordinates where pushed open. He watched in fascination, recognized the man instantly even after six years apart. As he stepped into the hall LeFay’s generals stood to face the intruder. LeFay, seeing them readying to attack, stood; clucking his tongue softly. The two vampires and werewolf in the room visibly relaxed at the cue, while Douglas, a wizard, was a bit slower to respond.
"It wasn't planned. Lord Malfoy happened to find his way here. Through a picture he managed to get his hands on, no doubt. Which leads us to our true agenda," LeFay looked over his group of twelve trusted advisers, letting his eyes have time to rest on each of them. "We have a leak."
LeFay slipped past Severus and rushed to Cadmael’s side, glancing over the wrecked beastman as he laid in the dust covered in blood. Harry lifted his head slowly, checking him over, oddly feeling suddenly furious as he rushed to find a sign of life. A voice caught his attention and he looked up as Draco came over, Severus helping him to stand.
Draco stopped and faced Harry, looking over the young man that had changed so much since the first time they’d met. He didn’t know if it was inheritance talking or the vow he made but he felt the fierce need to keep Harry safe. “Why wouldn’t I? This is exactly the reason I’m staying with you, and the whole loyalty vow. To keep you safe. More so why aren’t you worked up about it? You know they are talking about you!” Draco huffed and poked Harry in the middle of his chest to get his point through.
LeFay seemed to have slipped into a thin long sleeve shirt and tight jeans and the clothes made Draco smile.
Draco glared at Harry’s back before looking over at the four-poster bed. It had curtains to keep the heat in, so that was nice, but he wanted to gag at the idea of sharing a bed with Potter. How was he supposed to sleep in the same bed as that mass of fur. And those damn tails! He groaned and then sat down on his chest.
Draco could even feel at a distance; and it was intoxicating.
"Answer me!" Draco snapped.
“I most definitely have not, forgotten,” he mumbled as he finished up the letter and sealed it. “Winky! Dinky!” he called.
He'd completely forgot about Harry's 'tutoring' session, and Draco's stomach turned at the thought of it. Snape planned on telling Harry everything; Draco's faked death and that he was Ghost. It only had been a day but Draco felt he'd made a connection with Potter in such a short time as Ghost. Thinking about how Harry would react made his stomach sour, and the idea of how many hours of progress he made with Harry made his mood worse.
“The castle has catacombs?” Luna asked as she sat up. Hermione scowled and Luna apologized before there was an announcement over the coms.
Harry looked around, his eyes resting on a knife. "What about the familiar bond?" Harry said just barely above a whisper.
“I guess I should know when I’m in the infirmary huh,” he laughed even more, earning him a soft cuff to the head by Hermione. Neville shook his head and Luna giggled before laying her hand on Neville’s.
Draco got up and decided to head to the kitchen to get a snack. He hadn’t come down this morning for breakfast and was famished. As he did he passed by the drawing room, stopping when he heard voices raised from inside. They must have forgotten to activate the privacy wards because he could hear them loud and clear.
"Hey mate!" Ron said as he entered the room. Harry looked up from the book he was reading to see Ron with Hermione right behind him. "No one else is up here right?" Ron asked, gesturing towards Hermione. Harry shook his head.
William was one of the two vampires currently sworn to LeFay. (Well, them and all of their bloodline as well.)
“Why are you staring at me?” Draco questioned as he lifted his eyes from his classes. He could tell Harry's eyes still had the same look as earlier; a hungry, eerie green.
“Slowly things are changing in the right direction, but honestly wizards are the least of our worries in the magical world,” LeFay stated.
“Already 22:30,” he grumbled aloud. Slumping forwards he then laid out on his stomach, crossing his arms to hold up his head as he peaked into the pile of blankets. ‘
“That there is a hybrid between your average Water Python, and a more mythical snake species called a Metal-Mane. Though they are known to be quite aggressive, this one is a big sweet heart, unless you’re like the last few people that bought it,” the man huffed. Harry turned his head to look at him, confused. “Well, you aren’t exactly just a wizard though huh,” he added as he eyed Harry’s legs.
“I just thought you would have felt the magic in the book. It’s enchanted. All the poems in the book are made like a muggle movie. While you are reading it, it creates a picture in front of your eyes,” Draco explained. Harry frowned at the book and then handed it back to Draco.
"Skoll has found nothing as of late, however he is still currently out on his mission still. We have had little to no contact from him or his team," Hati replied, keeping his head low. The crackle of magic next to his ear surprised him and everyone in attendance was suddenly on their feet; wands drawn.
“No, I suppose it hasn’t.”
August smiled sickly, his eyes stripping down Draco to his core. "You're mates right?" August asked. Draco nodded slowly, his eyes flashing a deep purple for a moment. "Looks like you'll be fulfilling your duty sooner than you expected."
“You know technically, there are two snakes in this room,” Harry stated from the bedroom. Draco scoffed and continued to put on his silk sleeping pants and t-shirt that went with it. Surprisingly it was a light powered blue rather than green. Draco finished with his nightly routine and then headed back into the bedroom, humming to himself as he put his stuff away in the baggy he carried. He froze when he looked up.
“Neat trick kid, but that's not gonna stop me. I’ve been waiting far too long for this to let some barely out of the shell dragonling to show me up. Should have heard him when we were fucking,” Cadmael purred as he turned on his heel, glancing around him, trying to spot Draco through the dust cloud.
Draco stood there speechless and eyes glistening, as he watched LeFay’s back disappear out the door.
“How dare you talk about him like he’d just some piece of meat?!” Draco shouted angrily.
Hermione nodded, "It's not like students to receive a familiar until there last year at Hogwarts, even then some aren't compatible with one. It really rare these days."
“Well… I’ll sleep on this side and you on that one. So, you can be closer to your… Snake,” he hesitated as he watched Ammit climb up the bottom bedpost. He shuddered and then headed to the bathroom to change; Ammit reminded him too much a Nagini.
“Weaslys. I think we have something else to worry about…,” Severus whispered, standing a ways in front of them. Both men looked up at Severus, face paler than normal, who motioned behind them. Bill turned his head, as did Charlie, both men stiffening when they saw what was there. The Kitsune version of Harry stood a few yards behind them, head low and teeth bared. Slowly it started stalking towards them in a low crouch. A low humming growl emanated from the Kitsune.
Break me
As they entered their room, after passing through a luggage check, Harry was awestruck by the color scheme. The room was done in mostly green and black, with hints of purple. He was so infatuated with the coloring that he didn’t even notice the bed until Draco pointed it out.
"Potter. You are over five minutes late, I demand to know what has taken you so long," Snape grumbled.
Twelve people had shown up within the past three days as well. Draco never saw them, but he could hear their voices when he passed by the drawing room. He couldn’t make out any of it out do to a privacy ward on the room, but he could tell the difference between each. They never left the drawing room, which lead Draco to believe that the floo there was open for them beforehand.
“If you left because you had to," he started, remember what Harry had said that night, "Why not letter anyone afterwards to tell them you were okay? Sirius and Remus. Everyone was, and is still worried about you,” Draco asked.
Cadmael grunted, “Hogwarts, he’s posing as a board director,” he managed to say before Severus caught him, undoing the chains and bringing him over to a chair.
Sorry about the wait, and because of how short it is. Also excuse the writing, I know its not on par with what I normally write. Hopefully it'll get better as I go forward. Thanks so much for everyone that's stuck through with this.
“Charlie! You’re not really considering this, are you?” Bill asked, astonished that his brother would put Harry in a position like this.
Draco paid no mind to Severus’ words, instead fixing his gaze on what his mother held in her hands.
Severus' eyes narrowed at that. What had the man expected him to bring in? Something more akin to his Gryffindor house? He scoffed at the thought of having a lion wandering the halls. However, he had always planned on making Draco take on the role of Harry's familiar. Draco hadn't liked the idea and honestly he didn't either but he knew that if those two could get along they'd be a force to behold. So in the end, it was just based on what Draco's animagus form ended up being and what Snape could come up with to support that animal. "Do tell why you had that thought," Severus asked, crossing his arms over his chest.
“Thank you Griphook,” Tom said with a small bow, “We all greatly appreciate the work you are doing, and you have earned our respect.”
Pourquoi s'acharner tu recommence
Draco sighed as he sat down at his desk, going over the notes he had written. He was trying to get ahead so that during first quarter he could reconnect more with his friends, along with sending letters back and forth with Pansy. Mostly just telling her about how his summer was going and how excited he was for eighth year. That was until he’d come to Black Manor of course. As if on cue, Bubo swooped in through the open window and landed on his desk with a letter. Draco smiled and patted his owl’s head before giving him a small treat. Bubo flew off with it to his perch and began preening himself before falling asleep.
"Fine, but only for tonight. I still want to get to know you better first," he yawned as he crawled into the bed. LeFay followed suite, banishing most of their clothes before crawling under the covers.
Harry looked at the sleeping dragon and shivered. “How long has he been out?”
“How did you find me?," Lefay asked in unison with Tatsuya; their voices' vibrating together, "I’m awfully curious."
“My class got out early. Then Neville and Luna had to leave. I didn’t want to stay there by myself. Besides I’m fine, well that was until I bumped into you two. Wait Hermione what are you doing out here? Where’s Ron?” Harry asked, looking between the two. Theo rubbed the back of his head and looked up at the ceiling while Hermione bit her lip.
“Come on in. I’ll get some tea going to warm you up,” she said soothingly. Draco stepped past her, taking in everything about the house all at once. It was very small, maybe only having three rooms. He headed into the front room were three men stood up when he entered. “This young man got caught out in the storm,” the woman said from behind him. Slowly the three men sat back down, eyeing Draco as he stood there while the woman went into the kitchen.
“Harry, are you alright?” Draco asked in a hushed voice.
Harry goes to be tutored by Snape only to find something else waiting there for him, and a big decision to make. Does he help Draco or does he refuse?
“You’re going to add him to your mate bond, so soon? It will weaken you both, are you sure you two can do this?” Severus asked in a hushed voice.
“Harry!” Bill yelled.
“Yes! Tails! You have three of them!” Sirius cranked out between laughs.
"You really can't remember my son, tis a pity," the voice paused with its soft caresses, "Have you made your choice?"
“I hope you remember me from earlier Lord Black," Baxeka Dragoon stated before looking over at the other goblins, "Here we will be doing the inheritance tests, along with any Pureblood houses that appear and need to be filled. First, we will do you, and then Professor Lupin. Potter will go last since he is the youngest." Baxeka paused for a moment as he shuffle through some papers. “Since these inheritance tests will affect your vaults and any other archived information you have here at Gringotts each of you will be tested by your own private vault keepers.” He went on to introduce the two other goblins; Zalex Cogdigger, who oversaw the Potter accounts since Griphook had been killed, and Ypxie Kneesprocket, a female goblin to Harry’s surprise, that oversaw Lupin’s vaults.
"Professor Snape and I have been discussing ways to keep you protected when neither of us are around, with Voldemort back, you need all the help you can get," he paused and motioned to the animal sitting in front of him, "With help from some contacts, Professor Snape has managed to find the perfect bodyguard."
“No. We aren’t. But don’t expect me to be all buddy, buddy with you either. Lord Potter.”
Dark hair. Fair skin. Pointed, sharp, and yet graceful features. Draco could see why six years ago everyone wanted LeFay, but he knew something they all didn't. That man had baggage. Lots of it, and it was a mess.
“Sirius was able to fix the internal damage from staying with my Uncle; broken bones, torn muscles, punctured organs. Everything that my magic was holding together,” Harry trailed off, “but he wasn’t able to get rid of the scars. I used to wear glamours all the time but with my magic all wacked out, it’s hard to keep them up. So, I gave up the third day you were here. I didn’t think you’d ever stumble on me without a shirt on.”
It was a tight squeeze like Charlie stated, and it didn’t help that Draco the dragon didn’t seem to have full use of his motor functions. Twice he almost squished Harry against the wall. Finally, after getting him settled Harry stepped out of the cave and towards the group.
“Nothing… I was just curious, about what I saw at the ceremony. I mean, you had horns. Like a goat or something. One of those Hebridean goats, or are they sheep?” Harry scratched behind one of his ears and crossed his legs.
Harry felt a sudden pang of guilt but hope from the emotions woven into the memories.
Draco had ceased calling him Harry after a long rant from Severus about proper etiquette. Pointing out that Harry might as well have been dead as well since One Harry Potter never truly existed. At least that’s what Severus kept repeating.
Slowly, Harry made his way down Draco's back. When he reached it he squatted down, grabbing it with both hands and pulled. It came out with a sickening pop as a loud roar followed soon after. Harry dropped to his stomach and grabbed hold of one of the spines as the dragon shifted, standing and almost flattening Harry against the ceiling. Harry could hear Charlie yelling something as he squeezed his eyes shut.
LeFay panicked, remembering the first time he’d meet Hisashi, he wanted to tell Draco quickly but he was surprised when Draco was immediately kneeling with his face pressed to the dirt.
Draco looked over at his godfather, wondering what the man was reliving.
“Honestly, I need a whole new wardrobe, I had quite the growth spirt,” he half laughed. Harry glanced around, frowning as another person came into the shop. The dresser seemed to notice his uneasiness and pointed at a back room. “Thanks,” he said quietly as he headed into the back. She closed the door behind them and threw up a privacy ward.
Harry looked guilty for a moment before Hermione spotted the book he had been reading. "What's this?" she asked and then reached over to his bed to grab the book. Harry felt another lecture coming on.
He got an affirmative ‘uhuh’ as his answer.
Push me
"That is a Hyaena hyaena," Luna said from the Ravenclaw table. Apparently, having heard Seamus' question.
Harry looked at the wall behind the man, scanning the more decorative collars. “Oh! That one!” Harry said, pointing at a collar on the wall, that looked rather expensive.
“I’m never going to get use to this, am I?” he mumbled. As if answering his question one of his tails slapped his bare leg and then curled in on itself. It was almost amusing to watch as Harry scowled at the tails and tried to pin one of them so it stopped knocking his things off his nightstand. He sighed in defeat and grabbed a pair of black skinny jeans, only to find they wouldn’t fit or stay up because his tails where in the way.
Harry opened his eyes and sat up as Draco's movements and Charlie's yelling stopped. Looking down he could see Charlie and the group standing in the grass with pale faces. He was confused unil Charlie cleared his throat and pointed behind Harry. He gulped and turned his head slowly, coming face to face with a very angry looking dragon. Harry felt his stomach flip. “Hel-l-llo Draco,” Harry chuckled nervously.
“Ammit, keep watch,” LeFay told the snake before sucking in a deep breath and entering the maze.
“That’s possible,” Charlie stated as he stood up. “Right now would actually be a good time to start trying to unravel those spells. Help me would you,” Charlie added. Bill nodded and each of them took positions and started inspecting that web of colorful spells. Bill started a with a few counter curses and reversals.
"After I left him?! He left me!" Draco fumed.
After this, they would go shopping, both to make a statement and hopefully to let Harry relax after the will reading. Tom already knew it would be a mess and the boy would need something to ground him after. Draco actually came up with the idea of shopping. He’d seen the boys filthy rags of clothes and knew Harry had very few items to call his own. Or any items that even allowed him to keep his items private. His trunk had no locks to speak off, and was mostly magicless. To his embarrassment, he also suggested they go to the pet shop, as he had a suspicion that Harry would love finding something to give his familiar. With all that planned out, they left soon after breakfast with Draco taking the spot as Harry’s familiar, Ghost.
“Sounds like it may have been over stimulation,” Neville mumbled as he tried thinking it over. Theo bit his lip a little and then stood up suddenly. Neville jumped a little before settling back and scowling at Theo.
Harry stretched and glanced around as he woke, only to find that Remus, Sirius, and Parvati where already gone. Much to his surprise. The fire was all coals by now and Bill sat discussing something with Severus on the other side. Harry cleared his throat.
“You don’t have to panic, he’s not dead. Just close to it, its paralysis spell I’d been working on that not only works on the body but the soul as well. Something that would hopefully work on magic resistant creatures like him and me,” Draco wheezed out between raspy coughs. With a lazy wave of his wand he reversed the spell as Cadmael sucked in a huge breath, coughing violently. “It has pretty bad side effects but he’ll live,” Draco told LeFay before turning his attention to the barely conscious beastman.
“Well, I’m glad to hear that you’re still here,” Harry stated sarcastically. The kitsune chuckled and shifted as Harry called for a house elf. “As for who Volde is, he’s a man I had to kill to protect my friends,” he said softly as started to change. He felt kitsune stretch and yawn in his mind. It was a weird feeling, like feeling yourself doing something, but you weren’t actually doing it.
“What are these for?” he asked.
"Damn," Severus slammed the table with his hand, almost knocking the vials of the table. "There's to many, even if I can get them closed enough to administer the anti-toxin I don't know how much is actually in his system," he bit his thumb hard. Time was running out.
“Your mother understands what needs to be done!” Remus growled. Draco snarled as his eyes flashed purple. Narcissa stood up and put a hand on her son’s shoulder, her grip tightening when both men looked like they were about to leap at each other’s throats.
“Thank you all for coming earlier than expected of students. As many of you know, there has been an influx of students inheriting creature statuses. Those of you here are either of that status, or you are that students support. Some of you may be having trouble controlling your ‘creature features’,” McGonagall paused and looked over at Harry, “anyone that is having this problem will be expected to attend a study hall after classes in the transfiguration classroom. Now as for all of you, there will be another set of rules for those with creature inheritances and their supports on top of class rules. This is for your safety as well as the safety of the other students and staff. They will be posted here in the hall for everyone to look back over if need be.” Her voice echoed for a moment in the hall before she cleared her throat to continue.
"So you're the one that has the Master's eye. I was wondering about you."
“Move!” Harry snarled, frustrated that the dragon had stopped him. Draco clearly wasn’t pleased by the outburst as he snorted again and lifted his head higher to stare down at Harry incredulously. Harry glared up at him and then turned, walking around the tail this time. However the tail moved, blocking his path again. Harry threw his hands up then, turning on his heel. He was about to scold the dragon some more before he heard Charlie yell his name.
As they left the reading room all three of them were escorted into a larger room by another goblin and then left there. For the time being it was quiet as the three looked around, admiring the stone work and runes carved into the floor and walls. As Harry was eyeing a part of it suspiciously it opened and three goblins stepped in with arms full of papers. As they started setting up Harry recognized the golbin from early coming up to them.
“They broke up the day before they came here. She honestly wanted to tell you but, it’s been pretty hard for her,” Theo explained for her, smiling slightly as she nodded and wiped at her eyes.
Draco felt it too. It felt odd, and he suspected he only could because of the collar. “Sev, do you have any Calming Draught?” he asked and motioned at Harry. Severus nodded and dug into his satchel, uncapping it and handing it to Draco who handed it to Harry. He took it gratefully and knocked the whole thing back before handing the empty bottle back to Draco. Harry felt the effects almost instantly and relaxed his arms. “We’ll talk about this more when we get back. Speaking of which, we should probably head back,” Draco commented. Glancing at his makeshift bed he noticed he was wearing unfamiliar clothing and furrowed his brow.
All Draco saw was red as he leaped at the man between him and his property. He latched onto Voldemort's arm, dragging the man and knocking him down onto the ground. He heard yelling as Narcissus and Severus made it too the door, and then there was the screaming from the murder beneath him. Voldemort raised another arm to protect his face as Draco went for his throat his mind numb as the screaming continued. Suddenly Draco's eyes went wide as he felt his back legs give out. It took him a moment to realize he'd been hit with a stunner, and he turned. There stood Severus, pale as death with his wand drawn. Draco could feel the betray down to his bones, and his vision started to face as Lucius made his way into view behind his mother and Severus. He heard his father yell something and try to push through his mother and Severus.
anima reddetur votum = Soul vow
Draco was at a loss for words as August lead him away, the collar around his neck scolding his skin. He could feel the pure rage and sorrow coming from LeFay in waves, it made him nauseous enough to be sick until the reached a further distance. "Is he going to be okay?" he asked August, looking over at the vampire. August didn't answer as he continued to lead Draco further away from the main hall. The swiftly entered a side room and Draco was pushed into a chair roughly. His eyes went wide as he was suddenly being held down with fangs barred in his face.
Tatsuya spoke as they finished up their meeting with the new ambassadress for the Hogwart's creatures. Apparently the school board was wanting to close down the school after what happened six years ago. Six years and they where still talking about it. Pathetic. The creatures where concerned about there homes on the grounds of the school and wanted to make sure they had places to move if needed. LeFay had been all to eager to agree letting them stay at one of the estates.
“Well, as Harry’s guardian I’m sure that won’t be a problem any longer,” Regulus said, the tiniest smirk forming at the corner of his lip. “Ulkalb,” Regulus said, addressing the goblin.
LeFay was a bit caught off guard, not expecting to hop right into it that fast.
Draco didn’t make any suggestion that he acknowledge what his godfather had said, instead choosing to stare into the fire.
"Did you know?" August snapped, his eyes floating between Draco's. "Did you give them any information on our plans?"
“His grave? Why?!” Draco was shocked. Dumbledore’s grave?
Albus bit his tongue to keep from replying. That lossy goblin, he’d paid many people off in the Wizengamot to give him the power to keep these wills closed. Now that death eater had to somehow survive and ruin it. He had no proof, but the fact he’d been pronounced dead for so many years after Albus’ plot to have him killed; it had more than solidified his suspicions. Now the man was suddenly back? No. It had to be some kind of trick.
Harry turned slowly as he heard something behind him.
Both let out a long sigh as the tension left. Harry was turning his attention back to their surroundings when something barreled into their side, knocking them over into the snow. LeFay snapped to attention as he kicked off their attacker, fangs bared. Their was a yelp as their attacker landed into a tree, giving Tatsuya and Harry time to get to their feet. Yet, when they did they were ambushed by two others. LeFay leapt forward on spindly legs, claws coming down on the back of a werewolf in front of them.
Ghost laid at Harry's feet with his head on his paws, seemingly very relaxed and unbothered by the magic. He only lifted his head when Harry's shoe touched him. Harry motioned for the hyena to come up next to him on the sofa, only to have the hyena huff and put his head down. It only had been a day but still, Harry was a bit confused at the rejection. If only he could communicate with Ghost the way he'd read in books about familiars. Thinking about that made him lift his eyes to meet Severus' intrigued one.
Draco shrugged, looking down at his arms and the faint bite marks littering them now. "I'm doing fine. I'm not to worried. Sev's potions are only the best in the whole of the wizarding world." He tried to laugh at least a little but it didn't come. He lifted his hands to rub his eyes only to feel a strong hand grip his. He looked up, startled by Tom's sudden movement. Tom squeezed his hand and smiled weakly at Draco.
Sirius was surprised that Draco caught on so quickly. “Since you both have Black blood from your mother’s side I have to. However,” he paused to switch his attention to Narcissa, “I will have to ask you to swear loyalty to him, both of you. He is my heir so Narcissa would have to sooner or later, but because being a Kitsune is rarer than most Draco will as well. That way it lessens that chance that Harry is exposed before he can protect himself.” Narcissa nodded in understanding but Draco stood up sharply, causing the chair to fall over.
Ammit paused to crawl up onto Harry’s shoulders,
Harry asked. There was a faint laughing that cause Harry to whirl around again, he was panting a little as he looked around frantically.
Hisashi smiled, “Those that then abuse that trust, and don’t listen to their followers are the true monsters. Now, I’ll leave you two alone,” he snickered before disappearing in a flurry of flower seeds, blowing across the maze before settling and leaving the two men by themselves.
Severus put down the rags on the table, nodding at the other healers as they headed out of the room. "Thank you so much for your help today," he said softly. They nodded as they passed, some handing him a few gifts for Harry when he woke.
the Naga asked, frowning. Harry took a step back, looking over the Naga for a moment.
Draco narrowed his eyes, "That isn't what I meant, and you know it." Was this man ever going to give him a straight answer?
“Thanks Herm.”
“I second,” Snape sneered. “No use in telling him everything if he can’t pull it off.” McGonagall sighed and rolled her eyes, something Harry had not seen before.
“Potter, you are a parseltongue. Are you sure you couldn’t make out anything from the hissing?” Snape asked. Harry shook his head and frowned.
“That’s just gross,” Draco gagged a little as he turned away from his mother. “I’m going back to my room.” Narcissa watched him walk away, and smiled a little. Any mother could see when their child was hiding something, and the slight pink tint to Draco’s cheeks was unmistakable.
“Who is it?” Hermione asked from the other side.
His smoky silhouette surprised Ammit, causing him to hiss and grumble before laying his head back down on LeFay's shoulders.
“You could try shifting!” Severus suggested, only to have Bill looked over at him like he was insane.
Harry just stood there, his eyes looking out onto the courtyard. His face was stone, but his head and hear ached. He'd known Draco was there but he'd said it anyways. This was good, Draco could move on...
“If he doesn’t wake up by the time this potion is done brewing then I’ll start really worrying. For now, letting him rest. It might be for best,” Severus stated. Harry could tell the Professor was near the ends of his rope. His mask was down and Harry could read the emotions on his face as plain as day. Bill sat beside Charlie and peaked at his notes before his attention turned to Severus’ brewing.
Though the house was done in dark shades it didn’t feel suffocating. Draco deduced that it was probably due to the shades of green that covered the walls and floor. He headed down the hall after his mother and when they entered the drawing room he was taken aback at the sharp contrast to the front room. The drawing room was done in light and dark shades of blue, apart from the wooden furniture which was made of a very light wood. He guessed birch but couldn’t be sure.
“Nothing you’d be interested in. People keep sending it back so I’ve just kept ‘em in the back here,” the man said as he scowled at Harry. “Why not come over here?” he said and tried to draw Harry’s attention. Harry was to focused on the wood shavings as they moved and the head of a green serpent looked up at him. The man grumbled and watched as Harry eyed the snake. Its scales where copper colored and patterned in what looked like a mane behind its head and along its back.
Snape pushed his head into his hands, groaning. Please don’t say yes Minerva, please don’t say yes.
“How did you figure out it was me?” Harry asked as he stepped under another branch.
Harry blinked, nodding slowly as he stared at the ground. The words Draco spoke seemed to spark something in Harry as he shrugged off whatever had been bothering him.
"Sorry about that Neville," Harry stated as he let out a relieved sigh. Neville nodded and slowly relaxed, his eyes never left the creamy animal at Harry's feet though. Harry felt a bit guilty, but he had to admit it was a little funny watching the hyena with a sloped back try to get up a staircase while chasing Neville. "Is there anything I can do too-." Neville shook his head violently.
"Let's go then. Walking is going to be hard." Jariss smiled and nodded as both melded together and Draco could feel his skin toughen into scales. Draco blinked, thinking about himself and Jariss as one while everything came into focus. His vision became sharper in the darkness and the trees stood shorter than he thought they would. As they stretched out their wings he could feel snow rolling off them before reaching full extension. Draco leaned their weight back before heaving their dark body into the air, surprisingly a quiet take off for their size. They circled once, twice, before getting their bearings and heading towards the pull they'd always felt.
"Yea?"
“Do you really think that matters to either of them?”
"We are losing him Severus!"
Squaring his shoulders, he made his way to the transfiguration room.
“What might Master Remus need Kreacher for?”
“To his true self?” Draco croaked.
Harry looked away, cradling his hand after wrapping it. "Thank me when he lives."
"I'm not giving up on him! Harry! Wake up damn it!" the voice was hysteric now, and Harry suddenly found himself running, splashing through puddles as he did. Draco, Draco...he remembered that name. A feeling started to well up in his chest. Guilt, grief of his own, loss. Regret.
“His plan?”
"Why didn't you tell us sooner?" August asked, confused on why his best friend had not told him of Lord Malfoy's impending arrival.
"Torturing him?" Harry sat completely up then, getting to his feet shakily as he spun around. "HELLO?" he yelled into the darkness around him. For some reason his heart was pounding in his chest.
Kristian broke him out of his thoughts as she came bursting in with a load of clothes in her hands. “Try these on!” she hooted with a big grin on her face.
“Too obvious,” Remus stated, “Though it doesn’t really matter since everyone pretty much knows what Harry is.”
“I can’t believe this!” Harry shouted angrily into the emptiness of his room. He had planned out this year so perfectly, and now all of this!
Sans lui je suis un peu paro
(***)
“Sirius!” Harry yelled and ran over to him, placing his hand on the dark fur. He turned, watching Remus and Bill fighting the Nagas off, trading spells while working together to help each other dodge the tail of the Nagas. Remus tried to dodge the next one but was caught by one of the Nagas' four arms and thrown to the side. Bill rolled under the tail but tripped when he came back up. The tail was posed to slam down on top of Bill till Harry ran to the side of it.
LeFay stood slowly, unsure of just how much control Draco had.
At the manor Draco pops by for a surprise visit to Harry's room, only to get a lot more than he bargained for. And in the darkness 'something wicked this way comes', and some can already sense the changes around some of the students.
Harry decided to great him, drawing Draco’s attention. “What are you reading?” he asked as he sat down on the couch opposite from Draco.
Narcissa set her cup down after she finished her tea. The small talk with Remus had been pleasing, and after laying out the ground rules Narcissa was overall very pleased with the situation.
“A baby dragon!” Bill hooted. Harry groaned, leaning his head back onto his shoulders and blowing out a puff of air.
LeFay ground his fangs together, eyes narrowing as he tightened his grip around the string, pulling at his own magic till he could hear it crackling around him. He watched quietly before speaking again, his maw dripping with magic that splashed against the ground as his form shifted with his will. Sliding to form the ghastly image LeFay had always seen in the mirror, the one that licked at the corners of his nightmares at night. The one he knew Tatsuya had both warned him about using, and yet encouraged as well.
Draco sagged to the ground as the world came loose. Tears spilling down the sides of his face as his hands met the ground. He stayed there: unwilling to move, unwilling to believe any of this was real. He watched as the ground below him was flooded with tears.
Lucius stood up sharply, slamming his hands down onto the fireplace. He was fuming! "What about Sirius, Lupin, anyone?"
“He isn’t normally like that,” Harry interrupted, “Albus has him under some form of compulsion or suggestion charm. His memories are also a mess, Albus had done just as much, if not more twisting than he did to get me to fit his mold. It’s changed him.”
“I will not sleep with a nude man in the same bed,” Draco stated and crossed his arms over his chest, staring down Harry. Harry just shrugged and crawled into bed with a yawn.
Severus replied. He watched his godson step backwards and tumble over, going still once he hit the floor. He felt his knees go out and he landed on the floor with his hands holding him up as Lucius rushed past him. "Its just a stunner, he'll be fine Lucius." Severus stared at the floor for a long moment before he felt a hand on his shoulder.
She frowned at him before shrugging her shoulders in defeat.
“You can do that?”
Draco was panting as he stood in front of LeFay, even though he was on the other side of the desk LeFay could feel the little dragon's anger right down to his bones. Draco's eyes had turned the color of the dragon's he held beneath his skin, making LeFay's skin crawl. Draco must be very emotional to let his control slip, LeFay noted. Standing up slowly LeFay gestured at the door. "Leave," LeFay commanded in a low voice.
Draco breathed a sigh of relief, he wasn't stuck in that mass of fur anymore. That was good, but. "How long have I been out?" he asked as Lucius walked him over to a chair.
Draco trotted in through the painting after Harry spoke the password, his head held high. He was rather liking his life so far, though he did feel slightly guilty about how his friends looked after getting the news of his death, especially Pansy. Still, it was only slight guilt and it was fun growling and snapping at anyone that passed them in the halls. The look on their faces as they ran off or even just flattened themselves against the walls was priceless. Harry on the other hand was not amused.
The whole group remained quiet.
"Harry?" Draco took a step towards Harry, his arm outstretched.
“Then with that I will call this reading to a close. Please use the exits at the back of the room,” he paused to look down at Regulus and Harry, “I will see the two of you in the next room. Oh, and Severus as well. We have other things to speak on.”
Skoll, one of Fenrir Greyback's sons; having joined after his father's dead, spoke, "Speaking of which. You said you had new information last time you sent out orders."
He hadn’t really been thinking when he told Draco about the favor he wanted him to do, but in his defense Tatsuya hadn’t stopped him either.
“Hermione was right, that wasn’t Harry,” Theo cut in. McGonagall started to pale as she pieced together everything.
Breakfast ended up being great, and Draco surprised himself when he found out how much he enjoyed raw meat. The bloodier the better it seemed. Harry however looked a little green watching the hyena eat. Oh well, food was food, and Draco was to hungry to care what he looked like while he was eating, or the growling and odd chattering-laughing noises he made while he was doing so.
Draco shifted his weight and listened to his scales rattle. The cold hair was making him feel a little brittle, and the way LeFay was looking at him made him feel self conscious about his appearance. Was his scales misaligned? Did he have something stuck in his horns? Draco finally passed it off as his thoughts trying to fill the silence. After all, he could still feel the hurt in his chest from what LeFay had been telling Snape earlier. There was no way LeFay wanted him, he'd heard it himself.
“You’re right.”
Both Tatsuya purred in satisfaction as Draco shuddered when they spoke, but it hadn't been quite what LeFay was hoping for.
"Can I see him?" Draco asked as he drew his hand through his hair.
Harry sat on his throne, looking bored as he sipped at his goblet. His nails tapped away on his chair as he waited for the last of his council arrived. “August should have arrived by now,” he growled quietly.
“After more investigation it has also come to my, and the council’s attention that the death of the Greyback family has been covered up, as well as had the evidence tampered with. The true killer was not Fenrir Greyback that slaughtered his wife and child, but one Albus Dumbledore during an Order raid, where the then came upon Cadmael Greyback,” August explained.
LeFay’s stone eyes said otherwise as they looked down at Cadmael, his face tight. “Severus,” Harry said softly. Severus waved his wand, spelling the floor and the man clean again, and then tipping a calming draught down Cadmael’s throat, which he greedily accepted.
"Everything comes together and falls apart, for that is life."
“Shibee has nothing to do with bed Mister Malfoy. Hogwarts chose your room for Headmistress,” the house elf stated, cringing slightly.
Severus growled as Sirius and Remus both looked at their shoes.
“There will always be someone out there hungry for power," Draco said, "Take Grindelwald for instant, he even came before Voldemort, and I’m sure there was many before even him.” Draco couldn’t help the shudder that enveloped him when he said the Dark Lord’s name.
Harry slowly relaxed as Remus continued speaking, coming to a slow understanding. Sirius nodded along and when Remus finished Harry didn’t feel so frightened. He was worried about what he would do about school, not to mention he didn't even know what day it was. Shit, he didn’t even know how long he'd been out. He looked back at himself in the mirror and then slowly started to get to his feet. With help from his two father's he wasn't as hard as he thought it was going to be. He'd hopefully get his land legs back in time.
Everyone in the room stayed quite as Sirius finished with a frown. He turned the letter over in his hands before taking a seat. His hands went to his face as Remus and Harry looked down at the table. The house-elves having already cleared away the dishes while they'd been preoccupied.
He sighed and then got up from his bed, pulling on one of the new dress robes. Remus had come up late last night to tell him that he had another meeting today, so he’d best dress nicely. Personally, Harry hated it. It felt like he didn’t get to do anything that he wanted to do, and the lessons he had been given with Narcissa and Sirius where boring etiquette lessons. He wasn’t allowed to do any flying either because of his current predicament. He did however write to Hermione about the books, which she promptly told him every single title he should read and should have read already. When he had asked about her and Ron she told him that it was starting to get a bit tense. It made him feel a bit better that he wasn’t the only one going through a lot of changes lately. Though, that didn’t mean he was happy about her predicament, he still felt bad about it.
Severus nodded and smiled, “Yes you will.” He looked up at Regulus then and nodded, “You ready?”
“Hurry, close the window!” Neville yelled as he scrambled to his feet.
"What are you two doing up so early?" Harry asked.
The woman clapped her hands together, drawing him out of his thoughts as tape measures flew at him. “Enough of that, let’s see. What did you want today?” she asked him as he stepped onto a slightly raised platform so she could measure him better.
“Yes. That’s all,” she muttered.
Severus shifted from foot to foot, this was not a discussion he ever wanted to have. Definitely not with someone who could smite him for one miss step. “That is concerning,” he paused, “However, the wolf does not feel remorse for those that attack her pups. Nor does the big cat feel remorse for those he chases from his territory. I think, if I may say this, that you have yet to accept who and what you really are,” Severus turned with a sigh, waving LeFay to sit as he flicked his wrist and the door closed. LeFay took the seat, eyes glued to Severus as the older man sat across from him. “You aren’t just a wizard, and even without your wizard half, you wouldn’t be human. In all intensive purposes, Lord LeFay, you are an animal with animal instincts. As ‘humans’ we have this notion of right and wrong, that we created as a society. The animal kingdom, bloody hell, all of the rest of the natural kingdom has no notion of this. You, Draco, Cadmael, the wolf pack, all of you have this primal connection that lets you be so much closer to your true selves. Denying those parts of you, calling yourself a monster because you don’t feel everything quite the same as everyone else, or because you have vastly different needs isn’t healthy. Not for what and who you are. If you had stayed, perhaps you would understand more, and Sirius could walk you threw it but,” Severus paused again, licking his lips, dare he say it? “With how much you tell Draco off about not being the person you used to be, you compare yourself far too often to that same person. Yes, he was you at a time, but everyone changes throughout their lifetime. You just happened to go from a human normal life to one filled with so much mystery that it was probably overwhelming. Not to mention all the trauma, and I know for a fact you have yet to sit down with a mind healer,” he stopped, grimacing when he saw LeFay tense more, his hand twitching like it wanted to throw a hex at the old potions master, Severus swallowed, “And if any of this hadn’t been true, you would have put me in my place already. After all, I am sworn to you as your subordinate and I have spoken to you in a very disrespectful manner. I know you’ve done some research into your current state as someone with a creature inheritance, but, as of this conversation, it has been brought to my attention that it hasn’t been nearly enough.”
“Harry, you never told us you had a rack that size,” Sirius chuckled mischievously. Harry rolled his eyes and pushed his face against Sirius’ chest, earning him a few scratches behind his ears. Remus laughed and patted Harry’s fur covered shoulder before Harry stepped back to change.
“I bind this vow,” Harry spoke softly, his eyes locking onto Draco’s. They shone hungrily with the same hue as the deep violet fire between them. Harry quickly dropped in the Knotweed, watching the fire go out in a puff of purple smoke and sparks. Draco’s eyes faded back to their original color as he left.
LeFay tore his eyes away from Draco and glared into the fire, unwilling to even look at him as emotions started to bubble up deep in his subconscious.
Though a bit longer, Draco’s hair was only to the tops of his shoulders.
“I think you’re right, but legally you’re also an adult in the wizarding world, so I think he’s trying to be respectful of your,” Sirius paused and clicked his tongue, “Fashion.” Harry choked on air before laughing loudly. Sirius smiled and joined in as he headed over to the floo. He hooked an arm around Harry and ruffled his hair before stepping into the floo. “Make sure you cast a glamour on yourself before you go through. I’m going to go on ahead,” Sirius said before dropping the floo powder and disappearing in a blast of green flames.
Seeing the reaction from the dragon Charlie chanced a glance at Harry only to receive another warning hiss. Charlie kept his eyes on the dragon then, bowing slightly. “Harry, try getting him to go in the cave. It’ll probably be a tight fit for him, but at least there we might be able to set up something to check out his health,” Charlie suggested but kept his eyes on Draco. Harry nodded and then slowly waded out of the water. There was a low whining nose before it followed.
Theo looked at Neville, tilting his head a bit before turning his attention back to Harry. “I remember lots of different scents hitting me all at once, and the sounds from outside,” he stopped and pinched the bridge of his nose.
It was around 9am when they finally arrived at Gringotts, all of them gathered in the room next to the one they would be using for the will reading. One of the goblins waved a hand and the wall separating the room became transparent, at least to this side. “I hope this will suffice? No one on the other side will be able to see in, but this way your security for Harry will not be impeded.”
“Cadmael Greyback, what is your relationship to Albus Dumbledore,” Harry asked, his eyes never leaving the form of the shaky, sweaty man in front of him. He had to do it, not matter how much it pained him too.
Draco was so focused on the substantial changes that he almost missed the long black fox ears hiding in Harry’s hair until they moved.
Remus looked at Sirius with pity before turning his attention to Teddy.
“It’s none of your business what I am, now if you’d please move. My sister needs this potion,” Parvati stated and tried to get past Dean. Dean grabbed her wrist and tried to push her back, only to have her slap him in the face with her free hand. “Let go of me, what is wrong with you three!”
Hermione and Ron watched with confusion as Harry passed them without a word.
Ammit slithered out from his hiding place and up the sides of his masters chair.
Baxeka smirked, “For each Lord the ring will usually change its design, but the materials it is made of remains constant. This particular ring was formed out of enchanted black silver.” Sirius smiled as the ring did just that and created a new design. It shifted and curled to make a vine of metal that curled down past his finger and around his wrist; the ruby stayed where it was as two small bones covered in ivy appeared on either side of the stone. The small details intrigued him but his attention turned to Remus as his partner finished his own inheritance test.
Harry woke the next day to the sound of a house elf popping into the infirmary. Yawning he sat up as the house elf set a plater next to his bed with breakfast on it before popping away. He ate slowly, unable to think anything else but the worst happening to Parvati and Draco. He gave up eating three minutes in and then sat back in bed, closing his eyes and breathing slowly. He might as well do some exercises to try and return his body to normal. His tails he had mastered hiding but turning his legs and ears back to normal proved extremely difficult.
“You’re going to be very surprised when you see him. Which is something else I need to talk to you about, but we’ll wait till Sirius comes back,” Remus stated and smirked. Narcissa would have a heart attack when she found out about Harry.
Harry's eyes where on the two, and it took a moment for him to process everything. "Wait what, Ghost is Draco?! You mean-."
LeFay’s nails dug into the arms of the seat, his whole body tense. He’d tried so hard to move on after Draco, fought hard to create a new life but he’d never been able to get those purple-grey eyes out of his mind, and now he was about to lose them again. Standing below him was Cadmael, a man he’d once loved, and honestly still did in a way. It made him hate himself even more to think about what he was suddenly putting Draco through, what he was putting them both through. The golden jaguar werebeast god of a man currently stalking back and forth beneath him and the sleek powerful dragon man that was to face him.
He says...
Draco recoiled, stepping back and flattening himself against the railing. Hati seemed to notice and winced.
Weird.
Draco looked up from his book, acknowledging the elf.
Theo could barely kept the scrambling fox pinned in his tiger form while Hermione ran to the window and pulled it closed, locking it this time. She turned back to where Neville was talking softly to the midnight kitsune, Theo keeping the struggling Harry pinned as he slowly calmed down. His eyes began to regain focus and when the distant look in them faded Theo let him up while Neville continued to talk to him.
“Narcissa, we’ll give you two a few days. Hopefully he will come to terms with it, but we need to do it soon. There is only a week before their school year begins,” Sirius stated. Narcissa nodded before bowing slightly and turned to leave. Remus turned back to Sirius to try and push the subject, only to be interrupted by a sudden commotion in the hallway.
"I'm fine, just a bit sick I guess," he lied. Course, Harry was use to it by now. He lied to Ginny about being in love with her before finally coming around and being honest.
Sirius smiled, “Yes, rings. Apparently, you’re next in line for a lot. Go ahead, take a look," he said as he waved his hand toward the box. "If the rings accept you then the goblins will be notified magically.  We won’t have to worry about sending them any notifications ourselves. I also have something to give you afterwards so don’t go anywhere when you’re finished." Sirius chuckled as he got up from his seat and disappeared down the hall.
Skoll smiled slightly before Hati cleared his throat.
“It’s another rumor sighting,” Narcissa stated, emotionless. Draco took the letter from her and read over it himself.
Harry on the other hand was about to blow. He could take care of himself! Yet, seeing the look on Remus’ face, he knew there would be no arguing. He may be an adult but in the Black Manor, what’s said is what goes. Harry nodded his head in acknowledgment and then continued to eat his waffles.
“We better head down now,” Draco said.
"He'll find some one else. Some one that can actually make him happy. Now let's focus on Albus and what he's planning," LeFay stated. Tatsuya grumbled as they started back into the paper work. LeFay conjured his patronus then, and as it formed a he stared at it. The cute version of a hebridean black dragon stared at him for a long moment, it tongue sticking out slightly. "Go tell the others that I want a meeting in five minutes, everyone needs to be here," he told his patronus. The tiny dragon opened its wings and flew through his office doors.
"Why?! I asked you NOT to bring him into this. Why couldn't you just respect my wishes," Snape snapped.
"I hope you aren't trying to find a weak spot. Cross any one of them down there and you'll have the rest upon you withing seconds."
Harry asked, starting to get a bit excited from what he was hearing. This stuff was pretty interesting. Unknown to him, something deep inside was starting to stir and was also listening to Ammit speak as well.
Charlie shook his head, “Not well. Whatever spell hit him: whether it was a combination of a curse and another spell, stunners, or something that hit him while he was shifting; is proving to be challenging.”
LeFay lifted his head with a sigh, ‘
Leaning his head back onto the headboard behind him he continued to mull over everything that had occurred. Draco could obviously take care of himself now, the full adult growth of his true dragon form was all he needed to be convinced of that, but was he ready for a real relationship like this. With his, LeFay swallowed at the thought, mate. Not that it was a bad thing, it intrigued him and put him on edge sometimes but his main worry was still Draco. Would he really be able to handle seeing him in a different light.
The Eagle Owl flew to his master’s arm and settled there for a moment as Draco stroked in between the large creature’s ear tufts. As Draco turned to leave his room the owl moved to his shoulder. He headed down stairs where his mom was waiting impatiently. Seeing the look on her son’s face made her soften. “It will be alright. After this all passes we’ll come back. I promise,” she tried to say comfortingly. Grabbing hold of his hand they apparated.
LeFay watched Draco, his gaze never leaving him as the wizard looked around the room, stopping just a few feet from the steps up to his throne. He felt his stomach turn.
The next morning Harry was awoken to a very loud bang from downstairs. He sat bolt upwards only to fall back down on the bed as his vision blackened. He panicked for a moment until he realized it was coming back slowly. This time he sat up more carefully. That’s when he heard the yelling downstairs and another loud bang. He grabbed his wand and headed towards the attic door, opening it cautiously as he heard another loud bang. This time he could pinpoint the noise and yelling coming from the sitting room and slowly he crept his way towards the room. When he got to the end of the hall and peeked in he relaxed completely. Remus was chasing an animagus Sirius around the room, knocking over pictures and vases as his Grim form bounced around. Harry laughed, catching the attention of the two and making them stop in their tracks. This was the first time they had heard Harry laugh in a long while.
came the soft voice of the kitsune. After hearing it laugh at him for the last twenty minutes he was a little uneasy at the sudden change in attitude.
Charlie lifted an eyebrow. “That’s odd,” he whispered to Bill.
Douglas grumbled but didn't say anymore.
Sorry for the short chapters before this. I was trying to make a worthy lead up to this chapter. I've been working on it for weeks now trying to get it right. I apologize now if any one finds it hard to follow.
“What is it then?”
Draco squinted at the potion as it finished cooling and then tipped it back against his lips. The taste was beyond foul, and he had half a mind to spit it, but this was his only way out. Closing his eyes he finished swallowing it and then stuck his tongue out, shaking his head from side to side.
Sitting there, in a throne, across the large hall Draco had just entered was a green-eyed man, black hair trailing down his sides. As the doors closed behind him four men, that had been kneeling, stood and turned to face Draco. Red eyes, brown, and golden yes locked onto him. Not even a second passed before they started to move as one toward him, but a light tongue click was heard as the man in the throne stood. The four froze.
“Hey! I told her to leave her alone!” he roared. He flicked his wand, sending Dean flying away from Parvati.
Tatsuya stated. Harry blinked at him, it must be a first for Tatsuya then. To have someone with three tails already this young, he thought. Seeming to read his thoughts Tatsuya nodded.
Severus snarled as he got to his feet and then looked disappointingly at his godson. "It was the only way to keep you from hurting yourself, and Harry. Do you even know why you want to get to him so badly?" Severus snapped.
Sirius looked over Neville and shook his head. “That was just an adjustment period; the real Harry testing the waters,” Sirius stated.
Severus requires an explanation from Tom, an answer to how Tom changed. What did he mean when he said Harry was something more than what they thought he was. And what is Dumbledore planning?
Harry pulled the collar out of his pocket and tilted it in his hands, still curious as to who had giving it to him. “What do you have there?” Severus asked. Harry looked up at Snape as he came over.
“It doesn’t matter, sniff it.” Harry scowled but did as he was told, his eyes flashing before he looked up at Theo. “It smells the same,” he stated. Theo smiled big before he put his hand down to ruffle Harry’s hair.
“Showing you what it truly means to be your so-called monster, now you follow suit, both of you will be returning to your true forms for the day,” Hisashi snickered.
“Come on!” Charlie hollered before he started running. Bill shrugged his shoulders and followed while Sirius helped Harry to his feet before. It didn’t take long for them to come upon signs of the dragon; large trees broken in half, shrubs tossed to the sides of the trail. “Be on your guard,” Charlie said quietly as he paused for a moment.
Harry stared blankly as they moved forward, and with his next step he tripped and fell. Draco turned, his head cocked to the side as he picked Harry up off the ground.
"Simple really, why else would they bring in an animal like this to Hogwarts and give it to you," Hermione stated curtly. "Though, I wonder why a hyena? Why not something else?" she stated and crossed her arms. Her mouth twitched as she frowned in concentration.
“Well… Honestly?” she licked her lips as she stood in front of him and tapped her foot. “The more feminine dress robes will look great on you, even with your legs. The real problem is for normal clothes and student robes… but maybe…” She started murmuring to herself as she closed her eyes, and fidgeted with the tape measure. She started to scribble some stuff down onto the pad she was carrying in her back pocket and tapped the pen to her lips. “Yes, yes! That might work!” Kristian spoke excitedly as she headed towards the door. “I’ll be right back.”
