Anyway, yesterday you slept away the morning (per usual) but then quite a bit of the afternoon. Unsurprisingly for many reasons, you sleep late a lot, you've had a very trying week, and you were up with Ren most of the night on Thursday. I was in the kitchens all day baking enough biscuits to feed an army ... or our family. I obviously baked your requested Lemon Ginger but then I baked at least one small batch of everyone's favorites; Zaire's raspberry tartlets, Nora Madeline's madeleines, Ollie's white chocolate macadamia, etcetera.
My Co-Conspirator,
The floats were spaced so that there was about two blocks between each one. This was to avoid problems should one thestral happen to go faster than the one before it, but they are well trained enough that THAT did not happen. The other reason for the spacing was to allow everyone time to fully enjoy one float before the next grabbed their attention.
"Just shag her already!" Blaise commanded.
"But Dad says ..."
Merlin! He was insatiable! For a man who had begun our relationship with only a little stamina because he hadn't had sex in years, he's sure managed to catch up with us! To be fair, I'm not certain any of us managed so much as a quickie yesterday, and so, he was probably chomping at the bit to get some. I of course was happy to oblige.
I laughed. "Wouldn't YOU know that more than me?"
Oh my Dragon,
No, I am feeling too overwhelmed to sleep. Don't worry, not the bad kind of overwhelmed. My heart is just so full I can barely breathe around it. Do you know what my view is right now? My beautiful sons, Dylan with the thumb of his left hand in his mouth while the fingers of his right hand are tangled in his beautiful curls, and Gabriel who in sleep flushes up about as red as his hair sucking on his bottom lip, the both of them in their matching sleepers from Grandma Molly snug as little bugs in their sidecar cots. The insanely gorgeous Morgana taking up hers and my fair share of the bed, sprawled out like she owns the place, and her pudgy little baby hands holding onto my sleep trousers. Making sure I can't move away from her even while she's sound asleep.
Although the scars of yesterday remain, you can go on living as much as your heart believes, you can't be born again although you can change, let's stay together always,
Morgana was standing next to Eris simply because Eris was holding Nicolas. Eris kissed Nicolas on the cheek and said: "And this adorable angel is Nicolas. He's only 9 months old and has -” but she was cut short when she made the mistake of handing him over to Lubanzi and provoking an unholy wrath in Morgana that blew up a few lights and knickknacks around the room.
But seriously, we have NINE kids (ten if you count Miles, which I occasionally do), and only Jasmine sleeps in bed with us every night. Would you call me a monster if I abducted Sirius and Draco from their beds at night and forced them to sleep with us on occasion???
Then, when we were on the island, all the grandparents were there to help out. I was excited about how awake she was and since it wasn’t any extra work, I again didn’t really think anything of it except that she must have just outgrown her newborn sleepiness.
You threw your arms around me and gave me a quick kiss before babbling: "I'll see what I can do! See you after class! Love you!"
;L POjopiJO' JJ'
"I love you too," Eliza sang in return.
But... I suppose that I can drag my attention away from my newest love for five minutes to talk about something alarming. Here we are on our honeymoon and...
Monday December 13th
Venus! What do you mean she is only sweet to me? She's such a hunny. Every child that came up to pet her was allowed and she purred and everything! Don't you dare disparage my pwitty witty kitty. Um, I mean, don't talk badly about this cat I don't feel many things for. Ok fine! She's the sweetiest, cutiest, cuddly-wuddliest little thing. And I love her. And yes, her name is Venus. It means we can't use it for any future children, but I suppose that isn't too bad.
Now I've had the time of my life and I owe it all to you,
Eris huffed a laugh. "So I thought it might do him some good to be forced to learn some. Better yet, ***I*** will be able to milk him for all he's worth for this charity so that it has an excellent chance of surviving when I move onto the next one."
Your (beautiful) eighteen year old self I married couldn't hold a candle to you now. He was the beginnings of a heady wine that continues to become more magnificent with age.
As I said, the whole thing is a mess, but not because the raid itself was complicated, but because it involves a Ministry official and some rather egregious and embarrassing breaches of ethics and professionalism.
The only reason the police have any DNA on file is that some of the victims had family who DID know they were in Japan, but not really where in Japan, but after enough time had passed with no word from the missing traveler, they gave samples of DNA to try to rule out things such as accidental death.
to walk me down the aisle, so it'll just be my father. I like the idea of a Y Aisle in which we meet in the middle and our fathers (yes, I will consider Arthur Weasley your father) give us to each other in a simple and silent gesture, and then we walk together to the officiant.
Except it wasn't.
Yours,
Also, I think it's crazy that he was able to tell Morgana was obviously Japanese. It took us weeks to realize that! And you're obsessed with Japan! It just made me feel bad that I didn't recognize my child's cultural background and he notices it in a moment. But then again, she's settled into her features now, we met her when she was a newborn. And for all that I would give my soul for any of our children, I loved them the moment I saw them, and they were all the most beautiful beings to ever exist, newborns look like gremlins. They are all tiny wrinkly old men covered in goo. And not the nice kind of spa goo that you know smells like lavender and cucumbers but inside of people goo.
I did thoroughly enjoy the massage and subsequent slippery, delightful shag that followed! And to heck with you! My coffee is delicious! But whatever you had Muffy add to help heal my nonexistent problem was a really delightful addition. Is it something I could take safely in the future? Because it really added something extra to the flavors of my dark roast. If not, is this something you, or maybe Sebastian since he's surpassed your talents, could create a similar flavored drink additive without whatever healing properties were in it?
P.P.P.P.P.Pee.Pee.Sssss. qawssdeddrftgyhuhjijik!
Oh my Viona... My little girl. Our first child. The one that has been my mogul in training since the very beginning… my so very grown up young woman with a family of her own...
Rather than explain, I pulled out my magimobile and called the police. My Japanese probably wasn't the best in my disorientation, but I managed to get across: "I need to report YEARS worth of dead bodies buried in the warehouse I recently bought."
I LOVE dancing with you, and over the years, I've taught you a lot, but even so, you just can't do some things, such as the splits. I can't either - especially with my arse growing ever bigger! - but I can get close enough to impress most people. Additionally, I was able to swing her around my body and do a few tricks that should have been impossible since she was drunk and we'd never danced together before, but am I a wizard or am I a wizard? Yes, I totally cheated by using magic to make sure that I didn't drop her if either of us was just a hair off the timing.
I made it clear that I/we were going to be participating in a televised charity fundraiser for the next two days, but that if they wanted to come to our home on Monday, I could give them all the details of my visions that they hadn't asked for yet. So, I have a tentative date with the police on Monday.
Everything just feels so calm and normal. Busy because it’s us and our lives are always busy. But I had breakfast with my non-sleeping family, and now I’m going to head off to work.
Anyway, dinner at the new place on Diagon - Café Exquis, ah... Exquis indeed! They want to make use of their magic and connections (I suspect the house elf underground) in order to make sure their patrons can have literally anything they want. With that in mind, I ordered the only thing that sounded good at the moment: Haggis with tripe tacos and one of the most tender sheep's tongues I've ever eaten! And tongue is *always* tender and juicy. Plus Golden Sterlet Caviar on sourdough rye crackers, mmm...
Thus, the two of you handed Serenity and Nicolas off to my parents and put the toddlers to bed while I tucked in the middles - who all wanted one last slumber party with each other now that they were feeling better. Finally, we were able to meetup in our playroom.
This'll probably come off a bit... bad... but if I really was paying him for the sort of things I do to you, then he would be getting severely underpaid in my opinion! I accidentally blurted that out and made him blush about 20 shades of red, hahaha! But while he is 16 - and thus the age of consent - I'm dead certain he's still a virgin. I mean, just take a look at how he squirms and goes red whenever shagging is mentioned - virgin!
So we have two options for how to leave on Thursday as I see it; we can take the carpet of course, otherwise I do have a muggle driver's license. I got it before I went on the camping trip from Hell, just in case. We could always rent a vehicle, and I could drive us all. It should only take us around an hour and a half. Let me know what you want to do and I can make a reservation.
Sebastian tried to decline at first, saying that he was horrible around people, but then I reminded him that he was doing an admirable job as a father to Balian and Vanessa. Sebastian STILL tried to politely decline, but Severus spoke up from his portrait, saying just one sentence: "You WILL do it, son."
Huh... Apparently one of the files that Robards keeps in his active cases is actually NOT active nor a case. It seems that he was married once upon a time ago, and had a son, but his wife divorced him and took their son to America when he was just a baby because of major personality differences. Robards has basically stalked them from a distance, keeping current on where they live and work, and also where the son's kids go to school and even their grades.
You have been such a wonderful caregiver. Taking care of me and keeping me company when I need it. Reading my behavior and being aware of when I need a few minutes to myself. You are definitely much better than I am at that, I have a propensity to smother. Bringing the kids to visit and play with River and I when they needed Daddy or when River and I needed company. And I know I say this every time something crappy happens to us, but the silver lining to this illness is how much time I've gotten to have with you and the rest of our family.
And it’s not my submissive behavior letting you have your way with wedding plans, you just have fantastic ideas. I liked our first choices but they looked good on us individually, when you suggested the new color scheme I realized how much better it looked as a set of complementary designs. And with how we have talked about dragons nonstop, it’s perfect to have a dragon cake. As long as you didn’t pick a gross flavor I won’t like, I’m all in. I told you I love weddings and I love thinking of ideas, but I also like all different kinds. I promise if you had suggested burnt orange and maroon as colors I would have thrown a hissy fit of epic proportions.
BUT - setting all of that aside, hahahahahahahaha! Unless you used an entirely fake name/picture and went to the date using glamours, just the fact that you somewhat LOOK like Harry Potter would have had ALL the people on the friendship app hoping for more! I predict that in nine months from now, we're going to have another little Haz on our hands ^_^
She saw that I was awake, set her tea and embroidery aside, sat on my bed, and took my hand in hers. "My darling, I'm so relieved that you are getting better and the Healer assures us that you will *eventually* be fine. The news that you nearly died from sheer stupidity had me in agony." She paused to get her face right in mine. "Understand this, if you *ever* do something so foolish and insane again, should you be so lucky as to survive it a second time, I will remind you why even your father is afraid of me. I think using a precise cutting spell to tear thin strips of your soft skin from your body while you watch and try not to scream. And then feed them to a hellhound, hmm? Do you think that would make you think twice? Knowing that a demonic dog would forever after have a taste of your flesh and be just waiting for you to let your guard down? Do you think that would stop you from being stupid in the future?"
My love for you is as deep and constant as the Circle of Life,
Alright, now that I am calmer, I think I'm ready to go out there and hold my granddaughters again. Just need to glamour my face to hide the blotchy spots. Ah... better.
Minor drama in Greece.
And yes, my mother is definitely the woman behind the man. The day that the Dark Lord was no longer our problem, she told him that if he ever did anything to endanger our family again, she'd torture him in ways I still have nightmares about, and he's been a meek little lamb ever since. Well, actually, more like a cranky little crocodile, but you get the picture.
I'm excited for this tour, but I am going to miss you like crazy. I'm sure a part of you will miss me but I wouldn't be surprised if you're going to enjoy my absence at least a little since you'll get a reprieve from my hovering. Don't think I couldn't read between the lines of your conversation with overbearing Ethan and hear that a bit of that frustration was directed towards me. I promise you, I am well aware that your body is your own and that at the end of the day, you have to make daily decisions about your health and well being that have nothing to do with me.
I love you,
Anyway, I am going to come to bed, tomorrow is going to be a LONG day I need to feed the babies and hopefully get a full night's sleep myself.
Sheer bliss!
"Bon jour, chere, ca va?" Wait! Why did ***I*** know French?!?!
Upon taking off the shirt, I found that I DID have another one on. This one said: Hands off my pregnant husband.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDgA2sxQIn8
All in all, I was MORE than ready to call it quits, find the two of you, and grab a bite to eat - oh... 2 hours later? Only there was probably another 20 or so students sitting in the stands just watching us, and as I told all the sparring participants to bugger off before my hunger takes control of my mouth, one of the girls in the stands made her way over to me.
"What's the matter?" Oliver asked, clearly concerned.
"Er... You are???" He asked in surprise.
I chuckled. "Sadly, even if he did, I'm in no condition to enjoy it tonight."
"WHAT ARE YOU *DOING*?!" I demanded in shock. Side note, why do people who want to seduce me always think it's a brilliant idea to do so when I'm just about due to wake up?
Yes you're an arsehole, but you're OUR arsehole. Come to bed and make it up to us you prat
As it turns out, by the time that I'd gotten there, Viona had things well in hand. She treated Ivan like a prospective and slightly stupid new business client, and in her no nonsense tone of voice, proceeded to outline all of the reasons why discriminating against someone - even if only by using unintentional but hurtful phrasing - made terrible sense from a business point of view.
I gave him a weak smile. He was right, of course, but it was easier said than done. That said, since he seemed to be in an affectionate mood, I kissed him as long as I could before I had to get back to Hogwarts for my next class.
Tomorrow, you and I are going to go see River as he wakes up. Rowe sent us an owl while we were at dinner and he is definitely healed up enough to be woken in the morning. I'll be there with you every second I promise. We can do this. We can handle anything together hand in hand.
This morning was going along rather well in my opinion. My mother and I held hands and felt immense relief as Andromeda greeted us as family. My mother only nearly broke down for a moment when her sister hugged her, and I was just glad there was no judgment being passed on me. Teddy was adorable! You said he would be, but I didn't quite believe it until I had him in my arms and watched his hair turn nearly white to match mine. I melted and immediately wanted about a hundred of him with your face and my hair - or however they look. If we had a hundred, would they all look like a different combination of us, or would they all start to look exactly the same after a while?
"I suppose it is..." Ethan admitted with a sigh.
"Alright love, I'll have Muffy bring you home. Pet the Thestrals for me, yeah?"
Eventually he agreed that he would give them his blessing but he was adamant that they wait until AT LEAST her seventeenth birthday, preferably longer. What followed was a literal negotiation where he set a list of things he's willing to offer based on when they plan the wedding for. If they elope and marry before seventeen he will give them nothing but also won't disown or stop loving them. If they get married after the birthday but within the following month, he will pay for their honeymoon. If they wait six months past that, he will pay for their honeymoon and a small home, if they wait until after Pearl's eighteenth birthday he will pay for the honeymoon and a full estate.
"That's also exactly correct," the doctor murmured
This made Harry chuckle and whisper in Draco's ear. “Pay the bill already, before I Apparate us away while everyone is still staring at us.”
Love you. I even pressed light and sleepy kisses to your head. Sleep well,
I went on and on about how lucky we were to find Shtara before someone else met her and swept her away. And I stand by that. But, thinking about how she came into our lives reminded me that for all that I call her my baby girl, she was well past babyhood when she came home to us.
Draco gives names. Harry does his best not to freak out over the idea of skulls in the closet.
"Be my guest," I permitted obligingly. "I could always print up another copy if I cared to, which I assure you I do not."
All in all, I'd say we had a decent night. Too bad we were too tired to shag before falling asleep. That said, I'm writing this as I feed Viona for her 2 am feeding, and so maybe I'll have the energy to molest you after all...
I laughed. "Fine, smart-arse. But what if you could do ANYTHING. What if money was not a problem. What would you do then?"
You sighed and shook your head. "So... what happened?" You asked as you sat back on the bed.
At this point, you were sobbing, I was very close to tears, Hermione was leaking, Ron was shaking his head at her in amusement, Padfoot was chuckling and rolling his eyes at you, and Other Harry looked a bit aghast.
Blaise held Orion so we could pass your cup with wine, and my cup with milk around the circle and follow with Eris so each person could welcome her into our lives and our family by name. It was beautiful, I thought I could keep the tears at bay, but when we got to Viona and Elena welcoming their little sister, I ended up letting some slip through. The cups made their way back to Luna and Pansy, they drank, and recited together, "Welcome Eris Lyra Malfoy, to our family and to our hearts. Your parents love you and we thank them for bringing you into our lives. We ask the Gods to watch over you Eris Lyra, and over your fathers, and over your brother and sisters, we wish your family love and light."
So, here's my new thought process; why aren't we utilizing squib children to the most perfect position in our society, muggle interactions? What better position for a bright pureblooded squib than working at Traditions or Hogwarts and being the muggleborn parental liaison? Instead of training a fully magical witch or wizard in how to blend into the muggle world, why aren't we having squibs who were born and raised with all of the wizarding traditional knowledge responsible for telling the families of muggleborns about their magical child? We could create an entire secondary culture that can run a wizarding post office so these muggles who are aware of the wizarding world don't have to figure out owls, or own businesses that could exist outside of Diagon Alley so a Muggleborn could purchase their schoolbooks without having to convert their money to galleons or so their parents don't have to try to navigate Diagon Alley without magic. Or even work in depth in businesses that wizards are creating in an effort to bring muggle technology into the wizarding world ...
The boys have joint therapy and process their feelings.
The reason I was getting the prickle was that he was giving you this smoky look that made me smirk. I wanted to watch him give you a hand job or something right there on the floor, but I could see that he was actually leaning in to kiss you. You managed to spot this as well and turned your head so that he couldn't get your lips. Even so, I rushed over and put a hand over his mouth just in time to stop him.
Ooh! Looks like we're about to land.
Anyway, so, back to your meeting. There we were in the Onsen, I'd read your email and summoned an excellent bottle of wine, because in my opinion, this was an excellent reason to celebrate. I actually brought two bottles of wine because I knew our kids would each want about half a glass, and what's a celebration if only two of us are celebrating?
Not that I thought you would forget today was Lissa and Cael's eighth birthdays, but you may have forgotten that the last time we all got together our little Lily thoroughly guilt tripped Ori, River, and Mahafsoun into promising they'd visit for the big day. So when we brought up the dinner with all the kids, we realized we wouldn't have to worry about magi-skyping Ori and Riv since they were going to be here to celebrate anyway.
Even stranger, in the dream, I'm a child about her age. She takes my hand and pulls me along as she runs. And then I realize that we're both being chased by a child that looks a lot like you - as I imagine you would look at around age five. Actually, very similar to how Hazel looked right before she confessed to being a girl and started dressing appropriately. Similar to Zwei. Hmm...
"Who the bloody hell is Marcus Braun???" I asked in bafflement.
Draco
In good spirits, Akihito led us to the same park we'd gone to before, so that the kids could play as we talked. I told him that after discussing it with the two of you, the verdict was that we'd all rather have a nice place that helped support Unity House Japan than not have one. Thus, despite the fact that I hadn't planned to do any such thing when we arrived, I was giving him my official support.
"I see a scrawny and energetic little boy. He's... in a room playing with some toys on the floor. His favorite seems to be a small stuffed dog only slightly darker than his brunet hair. Behind him is a bed. Someone's laying in it, but I can't see who yet. It's as if I'm sitting on the floor with him and at his height.
(See the end of the chapter for
I know you're sleeping, and I will probably see you and have cried my eyes out to you by the time you actually read this. But I needed to empty my head a bit, purge it out onto the computer screen, before I came home.
It never takes particularly long, but if I'm still in bed enjoying the high and you think I've been in here an unusually long time, definitely come check on me and motivate me to get my arse moving.
"Did you give him a potion to make him love you? Or maybe a potion to make him turn gay and want to be with you?"
When you got home last night from your day with DI Giles, you seemed too stressed to me. I know you said that Haz being like Carlito would be the straw that broke you, but I think the straws that haven't broken you have been putting too much strain on my love. Luckily, I had thought ahead and called Aya and asked her to come by and give you a massage. Weren't you so excited to see her? I think you were more excited to see Aya than you were to see me. I'd be jealous, but I get it.
"So, you're saying I can sic Grandmama on her when she's not pregnant or no longer your wife? Good to know."
Donald Dursley
Viper waited until we were in an empty hallway to take another dose of his Polyjuice. Then he grinned at Tiger. "Maybe you SHOULD have gone into business. You've spent most of your career trying to convict and punish criminals, that I'm not quite sure you know how to negotiate people that are technically your employees into working for you with loyalty."
Blech!
But erm… I'm not certain Orion will stay in school next year. After all, he doesn't NEED any of his NEWTS in order to own/run his businesses, and so, at this point, school seems to be a bit of a drain on his time. I did finally manage to get him to admit that he's been using my time turner to get enough sleep each night, but even that can't be healthy for too long. Right?
She was also wearing a hoodie, but hers was pink or lavender. I'm not sure how it happened, but her arm/hand was curled around her son. Leaves drew my attention to the fact that they were definitely in a forest, and there was the sound of running water in the background. Like a stream or a river.
Anyway, when she looked up and saw me walking down the main aisle toward the Head Table, she let out a small sob and raced to throw her arms around me and bury her head in my favorite waistcoat. A little flustered but willing to roll with it, I rubbed her back and let her just focus on her breathing.
I woke up at my usual very early wake time. Which, I owe to you apparently! It sounds like it was a choice between a quick prep and bugger or cumming into my sleeping mouth. You know how much I love when you come into my mouth when I'm sleeping. Fuck, just knowing that while I'm out, you take pleasure in my body? So so so hot. I mean, you're sleeping right now and I'm thinking about waking you up to ask you to take me because I am turned on just picturing you wanking over my face last night. I didn't even wake up, I didn't even come, it was all about my Master having my mouth. I'm so hard! What's that impotence spell again? Actually, you know what? I am going to go to sleep uncomfortably thinking about being hard for you.
Noooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Elena and Kisa were extremely busy ignoring everyone else as they tried their best to fight each other to the death. I love that whenever Elena spends more than a day or two with Kisa, she ends up improving her Krav Maga skills a good tenfold. I'm also grateful that the younger kids don't speak Russian yet - to my knowledge - as Kisa and Elena both were shouting insults at each other that nearly made me blush in their crude creativity.
Phillip Moss Weasley
I sighed heavily. "There is that as well."
Since then we've had a grandson, two womb transfers, holidays, a massive fight, found out Sirius fathered Pippa AND Leah's babies; suffice to say it's been a busy eight weeks. Which is why I didn't think anything of not really hearing what came from Operation: Snog Natalie's Face Off.
NO! You may NOT cast a sleeping spell on me if you think I'm doing too much!
Unlike you listening to me. Well you seem to listen, but I think you just hear half of what I actually say and then fill in the blanks. I never said that I think you SHOULD give Shtara or Lily or any of the children a baby cheetah. If anything, I spent years trying to get rid of the Cheetah we already have. Remember when we "got" her and you said you were only keeping her until she was rehabilitated. And now you're breeding her and calling her babies your grandchildren.
"Rookwood?!?" he shouted, thankfully quiet enough that he didn't get Reven's attention.
"So, rather than ask me to ask your dad to apologize for something he needed to do, why don't we simply spar until you feel better?" I suggested.
Like I said, highly unlikely. Also as unlikely, but theoretically *possible* I suppose, is the other thing that came to me last night. What if Orion (or hell! Eris. Or ANY of our future biological children), actually did have a baby - many years from now - and the baby was snatched using a time turner to be brought back to now to use against you/us.
I swear the reason she doesn’t have the same magic we do is because her voice is magic in itself. When creating her, the good must have felt it just wouldn’t be fair for her to have both! She doesn’t need a wand, she’s magic without it.

If you want to cook and bake, then feel free to do it as much as you want. I'll try everything at least once. But I'm warning you, if you make me gain weight, I'll use my new weight to squash you as I sit on you and remind you why I should always be slim and svelte. I often jog around the Manor to keep my body in shape and my mind clear, but if I start eating more, I might need you to teach me some of the routine you got into for the Aurors.
Leah returned looking much happier and more at peace right about the time that I was officially ready to go about my day. You and I were going to bring the littler kids and Viona and Eris - who naturally slept in after everyone else was gone - out to do the same sort of exploring that Saoirse and Rhys were guiding the others through, only less focused on education and more focused on just seeing what captured our interest.
So, to that end, I decided that YOU needed to have a bit of a stress free spa day. I planned the whole thing, so - not very surprisingly - it consisted of all my favorite things. I even had Pippa wake me up about 9AM - since I've been going to bed earlier due to a thing or three making me tire easily.
Thank Merlin and Salazar that the quick spells work. Thanks to an instant erection spell, we've been able to have fun, so long as we add a cock ring spell to keep it up, and then when I'm dying of frustration because nothing is progressing like it should be, an instant orgasm spell finishes things off nicely.
"Ladies," I greeted with a charming grin.
Ok, my thoughts are all over the place, so let me know if I say something that doesn't make sense, or let me know if you need clarification. However, step one, we have Kisa talk with Luna. We can trick her into it somehow or we can just recommend it by saying Luna is living a poly lifestyle and might be able to offer some insights. At the very least she will let Kisa rant and rave without feeling as though she needs to curb what she says because she might offend you by talk of murdering your childhood friend.
It started as normally as ever, you woke up long before me and went to the kitchen to cook or bake something. Probably both. You ordered all the elves to take off and go clean something if they weren't following an order, and so, you were all by yourself in the kitchen. I suppose you felt fine.
Saturday May 1, 2010
Oh hold on, she just arrived.
P.S. I *will* hex you if I see so much as a hair on your head!
You quirked a brow curiously as I held my hand out and helped you to your feet. Then I gave you a quick but demanding kiss before pulling back and smirking again. Making a big show of it, I pulled out my gold pocket watch and checked the time.
"We'll see," he murmured, giving me a terse wave goodbye.
I can't wait to hear about our plans for a kinky weekend to satiate your desires. Or maybe not hear about it at all and be surprised! Whatever you want Sir.
Draco
He slowly took a peek at the tray, then looked over at me. Seeing that it was me, he burst into sobs and threw his arms around me to practically strangle me as he cried all over my shoulder. I held him with one arm and let him get it all out, using my other to eat because I knew (from my own past) that he'd feel embarrassed and take so much longer if I acknowledged the break down. But by pretending that nothing out of the ordinary was happening, he was able to calm down relatively quickly.
And what a new Kid she is. She is going to be a handful. It seems as though she is quite independent, would not let anyone help her do anything this morning. It makes me think of what you told me about why it took so long for her mother to bring her to St. Mungo's, working too many hours. Who watches this child when the parents are working? I know I am guilty of doing a bit too much for our children and the Kids, I'm more likely to tie the shoe for them than to tell them to try tying it themselves. I am the one they come to when they want something done FOR them. I know I know I know, I am a sucker! But Lina is five, and ended up finding a stool to climb up and help me at the stovetop while I was making breakfast. Why does a five year old know how to make bacon? I know why I knew how to make bacon at 5 … and even younger.
My Everything,
P.S. That fucking degenerate has my collar. I want it back. He doesn't deserve to lick the ground you walk upon and he has my collar that has your name on it. I need it.
"Oh, nothing to concern you, Longbottom. Charlie and I are simply talking about our mutual love for dragons and tattoos," I informed him. "I think he would look divine if he had a smaller Opaleye right about here." I caressed a line down the right side of Charlie's back. "What do you think?"
I tilted my head and gave her a gentle look. "Gretchen, that is a lie designed to control you. You are very pretty and more than likely in demand. Telling you that you are not pretty enough or attracting enough clients encourages you to go back out and work harder so you'll make more money for HIM."
Aleksei Zabini
I took a step back so that I didn't seem to be intruding on anything. "Once you've sorted through your most recent memories and put them in their proper places, you'll feel a LOT better."
Rohzan and Kaveh told Jaz all about their summer so far, and bits and pieces of their lives in general. Jaz asked her grandparents to tell her about her parents, and also, wondered if she had grandparents from her father. As to that, she does, just that the Avins haven't seen or heard from them since the funeral, and so, would have no idea how to contact them.
Harry
I chuckled. "I'll see what I can do."
The insomnia thing I've had going this week has only been partially about missing you. I have to admit I am so worried about what Dean is planning to say in response to our conversation Sunday. I haven't heard a word from him or Seamus. And I tried to very subtly message our mutual friends to see if he'd contacted them. No one has really talked with either of them. Or our friends are really really good liars.
My beautiful husband,
I personally find it adorable that we seem to unconsciously take turns snuggling with Oliver in our sleep. Or perhaps he unconsciously takes turns snuggling with us, because it seems like every time I wake up for feeding duty, the two of you are snuggling, but then you continually tell me that I'm snuggling with him when you wake up. Maybe he is just the sort to toss and turn and we're opportunistic enough to take advantage of it when he gets near us.
That was all the confirmation you needed before Apparating him to a secluded beach and casting privacy spells to ensure that it STAYED secluded. You shouted at and kicked him for a bit, making it clear that he was a piece of shit for doing that to ANYONE - let alone OUR DAUGHTER - until the rage built up so much that you simply... Cast an exploding hex on him...
Anyway, I have to talk to you about your potion. I figured in email would be the best way so you have time to think of your argument instead of feeling blindsided if I were to confront you in person. So, I have to start with, you are the most brilliant man alive. I can't believe you are able to invent or altar these amazing potions. You are an incredible talent. But you and I both know that a steep purchase price doesn't stop everyone from misusing items. Can you imagine if Voldemort had gotten his hands on something that would extend his life that much? And he had the full Malfoy funds at his disposal, would a steep price have stopped him? You and I both know the damage that can be caused when someone thinks they should play around with life, time, or death.
River sort of winced and shrugged, and then grumbled: "Yes and no, it was actually a bunch of different videos."
*Device sends the email.*
Yours,
You might note that my second thought was that you were masturbating or torturing your bollocks and that I felt bad for interrupting. So, in my mind, *that* was more likely than labor techniques. Not sure why grooming just didn't occur to me as a possibility. I'd have offered to help.
But I did. A few years ago I told myself I had everything I'd ever want or need. I convinced myself our family was complete. I told myself I'd had more than my fair share of adventures. And because of that I closed myself off to the ability to let more love in.
But as I said, I'm about to take Miles to Hogwarts for a bit. See you when we get back!
"Aw man! Any other day and I'd love to stay and kick butt for you! But daddy has new horses to pet and kiss. Did you know that some of them are INVISIBLE?! I got to ride one of the baby invisible ones!"
Once they were cleaned up and calm and wrapped up all snuggly, they were allowed some visitors. And after Molly and Arthur, you and I got to hold them next. They were so tiny. I felt like I would break them. I held Xander when he was at Unity, and I held Violet (Sunshine) before she was adopted, but Roderick and Bianca seemed so much more fragile and breakable. Maybe because they were twins? They're generally a bit smaller than singletons supposedly.
The thought of everything that I did and was done to me makes me sick to my stomach even now, but it's only been a couple of days since it happened, so it's completely normal for me to feel sick. And horrified. And traumatized.
"Also, I managed to solve the minor mystery of why no one seems to know anything about Lana's mother. It seems that she was the sister of someone involved in a local gang, and when she was pregnant with Lana, she got into quite a bit of trouble and got herself thrown into prison. Whilst in prison, SHE contacted the leader of the gang - who was apparently a friend of hers - and asked him to help the father of her baby care for her by paying the rent on his flat for a year or two until he could work his way into a position that would allow him to care for their daughter AND afford all his bills.
Biological Parents Harry Potter and Voldemort
Monday January 22nd
Onto something that I find rather amusing. I received an Insta-owl from Blaise just a few minutes ago since he knows that I'm almost always up at midnight these days. He was begging me not to murder him for absconding with my aunt and doing unspeakable things to her for days on end. Well, even though he called them unspeakable, he described a few of them. Then he seemed to realize that bragging about this particular bed partner probably wasn't the best idea because he started begging for forgiveness again.
When dinner was finally over, we got our walk to Regulation. We all enjoyed exploring and looking through the puppy supplies, Charlie picked out a few items, but you didn't let me see what you ended up buying, said it would be a surprise for when we got back to our rooms. Except here I am in our rooms and you still haven't let me see anything!
"Ah..." he murmured in disappointment, perhaps realizing that him coming onto me was a big part of the reason that I just wasn't interested. The more important part being that he wasn't either of you. He didn't need to know that the most important reason of all was that I was actually working and not seriously interested in anyone here at all.
Out on the field, the girl that the girl Siri likes was partnered with managed an impressive maneuver that threw the girl Siri likes into him, knocking him on his arse with her groaning in pain on top of him, and he looked like he'd be perfectly content to lay there all day just looking up at her face. Poor lad...
Draco
But now that we're back home, I've got a message from Tabitha. Yes, you read that right ***I've*** got a message from Tabitha. She wants to see me right away, so I'm going to go check it out and I'll Insta-owl you when I know what's going on.
If my love were a star and you looked up at the sky at night, you'd see only light,
He just about threw himself across the bed, crying, kissing both of our faces. I had to ask: "Is that a yes?"
Draco
We then made excellent use of the enormous bed right next to Oliver until he was definitely awake and watching us. He seemed rather amused that you were obviously drunk and BEGGING for it in every way possible. All in all, it was a rather fun night that I will bet a hefty sum on that you are at least partially regretting right now, since you have to teach a class, hahahaha!
Sunday at 8:36 AM
Elena was quite emotional that we weren’t there, but I explained what happened and now she’s quite worried about you. She took her new video camera she opened from us at her party and has gone around recording a video of well wishes for you from the entire house plus the whole staff. I’m going to drop it off when I head over to Kingsley. If you get this before you’ve noticed it, I’ll leave it on your desk.
But I suppose you're MY monster.
Elena had a bit of a regular cold coming on, but a Pepper-up potion cleared that up in no time. Which just leaves River... He caught the same combination of viruses as you did, and so, is currently spelled asleep in the same bed as you. I love how Rowe understands why it's important for us to keep River with you. In any case, she says that the same treatment given to him should work even faster since he was just coming down with the infection and there isn't as much for him to fight off yet.
Oliver love, I hope you are feeling better now. I am not sure how long I'll be in the office today, but I'll try to come home as soon as possible to hold you some more if you need, but honestly, I think Harry might actually be better at the comforting thing. All I do is basically sit there in silence and hope you eventually feel better.
For those that want to know, there are four chapters left before the next part :-)
Fuck.
And who knows, after you taking back your power last night and a good session with Yesenia today maybe this will all be a moot point and you'll feel ready and raring to go to Japan tomorrow morning.
Okay, that's probably unfair. You were shocked by Draco slipping into your mind in the first place, and then when he slipped back out, you were distracted by his actions towards the baby. I have to ask though, did you think he wouldn't be happy about the baby? He's the one who got the potion to combine our DNA. He's the one who had it ready on our honeymoon because he knew you'd been ready for forever. I know you (and I) have a lot of issues with self worth, but Draco loves you. He loves our baby. And even without his memories, he's still the same man you fell in love with.
Age 18
Harry is worried about the missing files, and Eris receives an unexpected invitation.
The three littles took a nap together on the lawns? Please tell me someone got pictures! I am missing everything! And then you had all three of them crammed on your lap for a big snuggle? Aww, I bet it was the sweetest thing! I can't wait to see you with your arms full of our children! What do you think the bubbles will look like? I will love them no matter what, but seeing as we have a big-brown-eyed baby, wouldn't it be sweet if we ended up with one green-eyed and one grey-eyed? Like a whole set!
Saturday October 6, 2018
I think he's actually *unconsciously* seeking out the comfort of a bed partner - as he is used to sleeping with his husband. It probably feels strange to sleep alone. I can certainly understand that as - the few times I've had to stay in the Hospital or whatever the case may be - sleeping alone has utterly sucked bollocks. I have reason to believe you feel the same way.
Cause I'm in too deep and I'm trying to keep up above in my head instead of going under,
"Look... I didn't..." she sighed again. "Back before I had my surgery, one of the last days before school let out, I had a girl show interest in me. She seemed to imply that she could handle ALL aspects of me, and I thought: 'fuck it, why not?' which led to my first and ONLY time before my surgery."
I'll spend the next hour staring at the kids to make sure they're alright. You do the same with the littles that are piled on top of you in bed.
By this point, I was REALLY needing a good stiff drink! Unfortunately, that's just not possible at the moment. I spent at least five minutes just standing there rubbing my temples, trying to ward off a headache and control the impulse to drink a bottle of wine. Honestly, since a trip to subspace is safe enough for the babies, I was contemplating waking you up and making you spank ME for a change.
Daisy Dursley
P.P.S. I love that even though pets aren't technically allowed on this trip, we've managed to smuggle ours anyway, buwahahahaha! Having a purse for them certainly comes in handy! Even Romulus and Remus fit in there and they've all been content to stay in there and play so long as they have plenty of food. Thus, we've been able to take them out in secret when we were alone and had time to play with them. I LOVE sneaky us!
I laid the boys in the bassinet while I did my nightly routine, and then picked them up when I was done, intending on us climbing into bed and snuggling the both of you. Except when I tried sitting down, you snatched up the baby again, started mumbling "no, you can't" and rolled her over so you were in between the two of us. What? I can't what? Be next to my own daughter?
-	Age 8
I would have rather done it myself and spared you. Which is why, when he leapt to the side and threw himself to the ground to avoid the spell, aiming at you with clear intent to return it, I cast it at him, only this time, he had no room to avoid it as he had inadvertently landed next to our raised fire pit and had two animals closing in on him. To my astonishment, he rolled just enough to avoid it after all, but you were already casting it again, and this time, he couldn't escape.
Draco
Friday August 21, 2009
Greetings from sunny, beautiful California!
Then our Dylan had his turn. “I am Dean Robert Thomas, chosen to be Guardian for this child.” “I am Seamus Patrick Finnegan, chosen to be Guardian for this child.” You speaking: “May the Gods keep this child pure and perfect, leaving all negatives far beyond his world. May you always have good fortune, may you always have good health, may you always be joyful with love in your heart. You are known to the Gods and to us as Dylan Sheen Potter. This is your name and it is powerful. Bear your name with honor and may the Gods bless you on this and every day. I honor you Dylan Sheen.”
"Well, word is that you love to sing to Harry - that you do it all the time. Is that true?"
I just stared at you. Your skin all flushed. Still panting and purring. And oh bloody hell, your little tummy distended with the amount of liquid inside of you? I practically came untouched just from the sight of you. I didn't realize I was doing it until you gasped again, but I reached out and was massaging your abdomen. I could hear the solution moving inside of you. You were grunting and making the fucking sexiest noises. I pulled my hand back once I realized what I was doing, except your own hand flew out and grabbed it back. Putting my hand right on your stomach and then pushing down. Oh. You liked it.
I snorted in amusement. "Ha! Go take a look at the collar on your dad's neck and ask him how long he's had that, and then wonder again how you forgot that I gave it to him before you were even born."
Godparents Viper and Yesenia
So, I think we should all cuddle up in bed, kiss out our apologies, and take a nice long mid-day birthday nap. We just need to be awake and dressed by 4:00 this afternoon.
"Exactly!"
He nodded slowly with a slight frown, as if he understood but still felt that was unethical.
I stopped to look you in the eyes. "If I insist that the babies have their own room from the beginning and that their elves tend to them..."
Ugh, minus the whole surfing and dirt biking with my teeny, fragile, precious baby tied to you! I know, you would never harm the children. I am sure you had a million and one safety charms on her. But you took my baby surfing and dirt biking! Do you know what that does to my anxiety?!?
Our Lissa, on the other hand, is Black. Not in coloring, her hair is definitely coming in all blonde and she might be the palest of all our children, but the family line. She looks so much like her Grandma Narcissa. And she has this serene look about her most of the time. But I am a bit worried because I know the sheer stubbornness that can hide under that family's aristocratic features. And this one will have her Uncle Sirius in her life from day one! Terrifying!
I'd better run and get to the last minute details I came here to do! I can't wait for the party, I'll get to see some of our Unity Royalty, Andi is bringing Teddy, and Bianca and Roderick are coming. Eeeeek I can't wait! Hurry up and be 1:00 already!
"Blimey!" Viona swore, knowing (presumably from the book) that the test was positive. "Wow... we're going to have TWO nieces or nephews!"
"Thanks!" Jules exclaimed as he jumped out of bed and ran off, presumably to go do as he'd said.
Your rather inelegant snort didn't help matters any.
Slytherin
Anyway, I think you know exactly how you're lucky. I wasn't aware of how much you did on that raid before I gave in to your dance request. If I had known that you basically took lead on the damn thing I might have strapped YOU to my spanking bench to teach your naughty bum a lesson.
Obviously I love seeing it. And the first time he saw Cassie and Parker holding their little sister was wonderful. You could tell he could barely contain his joy seeing his first babies holding his newest baby. I'm trying so hard to focus on how unbelievably happy he is. His smile is so contagious. And he has the same look I do when he sees you doting on our babies. Like he can't decide if he should cry or laugh or jump you.
Note: Generally, we do like to keep our individual arcs a bit of a secret from each other so we can genuinely react to the information presented and not 'script' it, and because of this, with the iffiness Draco's projecting, Chrissie is ready to come kick my ass on Harry's behalf, LMAO XD
I put a spell on you 'cuz you're mine,
Also, when it came to plotting that murder, here's something I've never told anyone before - and I can show you my diary from the time if you want proof, but... Well, so, my task was to see to Dumbledore's untimely death by any means necessary. My very first plan was this: I was going to enchant something with a sleeping curse and then *happen* to run across Dumbledore when he was on his way to his office or something, and ask him if he could help me figure out what the curse on the object was, and then when he took it from me to inspect it - thereby activating the curse and falling into a sleep - I would have cast an Avada Kedavra on him. The Unforgiveable Killing Curse is actually painless, I don't know if you knew that, but it is. The only reason people fear it so much is that there's no way to shield yourself from it, and the sort of person who would use it is by definition, heartless and thus someone to fear. In any case, I could have done it - I'm almost certain - simply because there would have been no struggle and no pain. I'd have shoved my emotions in a locked box like I did in Seventh Year, cast the curse, and then been considered a Hero to my cause.
Eventually I was unstrapped, cuddled up into bed with chocolates and water. And when I finally came up for air I was deliciously wedged between you both. Beautifully sore, loose-limbed, and sated, but unfortunately wide awake.
In actual unfortunate things, the same could not be said for the unicorns. They obviously wanted nothing to do with Ori since he's a boy. And Eris was a no go. But oh my goodness is Viona in love with these animals. She pretty much climbed into the stall with them and cuddled them all night. No, seriously, all night. I found her there this morning when I went back to check on them.
Your dreams were not nightmares. They were accidental magic from a very scared little boy. He had been projecting and calling for help for a few days, but apparently you were the only one receiving the messages, and only when asleep because your mental defenses are less when you're asleep.
I just didn't want to leave y'all with that mini cliff hanger :-)
Sunday July 4th
At least, I think that's what she called it. It basically means that the body has an optimal performance range and likes to keep it the same at all times, so the blood always carries a little bit of everything in it to have on hand at all times, but quickly gets rid of anything in excess of the optimal range so that the excess doesn't slow the body down.
You said you'd be home Wednesday, but even with a precise flight plan filed by Mr. Lott, you weren't quite sure when you be *home.* It never really is more precise than: We're landing at noon, so provided were on schedule and can manage to wrangle everyone/thing efficiently, we should be home within an hour of landing.
"The only thing I am prouder of than what I'm about to show you is my family. This is a very very close second. Welcome to Unity House, Harry Potter."
I've been overseeing a bit of the last minute touches on this end. Luckily we have our first gala under our belts, so it's not all brand new. Also, I have Tabitha this year, so I have almost nothing to do. I know we've got the whole thing catered, but the Kids and I thought baking some homemade treats would be a good idea, I'm just taking a quick break while we have a batch in the oven.
I am going to murder everyone in the world until I find the guilty asshole and make him pay!!!
Happy Birthday My Love,
"The Aqua Shard," Kisa stated firmly, gesturing to indicate the fact that she had gotten dressed up rather nicely for him. "NOW!"
So thirty-two children here for now, and twenty-five by the end of this week or next. I think I can safely say that my mornings will not be boring! But with Tabitha on top of my office jobs, I am going to be relegated to fun Uncle who sometimes has to sign papers because his name's on the legal stuff.
And do unto others as you'd have done to you.
Eliza Lestrange Malfoy
I love him being here.
After reading my recent email, an email where I go on and on about how pleased I am that you didn't get the Minister position because you wouldn't have enough time with your family, where I discussed how hard of a time Kisa, Blaise, and Ron are having with Hermione being gone so often, and in the two most recent emails you and I BOTH discussed how upset Viper is with Tiger, your take-away is to recreate the exact scenario which has been causing Tiger to be so absent with his family?
Ok, now that I think about it, I probably don't have to worry about favoritism because when I think of each of them individually, I am pretty sure they're all my favorites!
Did you make any headway on the laptops this week? Did you manage to figure out where the connection was missing on the three laptops they altered?
Honestly Draco, we completely understand you being busy and don't expect anything more than you've already managed to give us so far this event. The occasional stolen moments where you come find us in the Malfoy family box for cuddles and kisses. Your last email, written in quiet moments during the first task. If anything we're pleased and surprised you had time for any of it. We both truly appreciate you making us a priority.
Salazar's twisted scrotum, Harry! I love you so much that I think my heart literally burst through my chest at some point and became fireworks in the night sky. I will not be surprised if the Founders prod me awake with their pointy-toed boots and tell me that I have in fact died and joined the afterlife.
I'm so glad you had a wonderful childhood. I think it's funny that you mention that it doesn't take a fortune to give children what they can, because we all know that you were spoiled with things, but the things you mention about your parents are what they taught you or did with you. You didn't mention giving you everything you wanted until after you mentioned their true teachings. I've really been loving kneeling in the garden with Narcissa, caring for our flowers, and someday your mum and I, and any or all of our children will do the same. And while I am sure they will love the brooms and toys we buy them, I would hope that they will remember kneeling in the dirt with their Dad and Grandma. Annnnd now I'm crying. It's been an emotional day!
I unconsciously let out a very soft groan and rubbed my temples. Didn't I already go through this once? Rescuing a girl, that is.
"I will," I promised.
Note: IF we get you tested and it actually *is* your sperm being reluctant, I reserve the right to take Blaise up on his offer after all, but that probably won't be until the distant future as I am definitely going to try everything I can to carry *your* child. I *am* a potions master after all, and I'm dead certain I can come up with the perfect potion to meet our needs, whatever they might be.
Grinning, you kissed me. "I'm certain. Now get on your knees and put your hands behind your head."
That said, maybe a full detox may not be necessary as the last time we were there, none of us used a lot of magic and Serenity apparently woke up a bit. I guess we'll have to talk it over. I suppose the worst case scenario in this instance is that we have to permanently move to our island to keep her away from all magic until she's older.
Oh! It's midnight! This time I mean it, Happy Christmas Draco; my husband, my best friend, my partner, my life.
You just fell asleep so I popped home to grab you some pajamas that aren’t “these plebeian St Mungo’s rags”, kiss Viona good night, and since I’m here I took a moment to breathe and send off this message to you.
Oh! While we're trapped on the plane for hours and hours with Kingsley I have a bit of an idea. See you mentioned during your description of coming up with the Memory Camera that you got part of the idea from the pensieve projector. Which they use in the Auror department right? Well, what if you were able to "sell" these to the ministry for use in the DMLE. Imagine if instead of having to pause the projection or keep going in and out of a memory, they could print a photo and be able to analyze it without having to have the projector on hand. I just think that your invention could be super helpful for them and profitable for you.
"Alright, that's fair. Please forgive me, I'm new to this parenting thing and I haven't had a lot of time to make all the mistakes and learn what I'm doing that I would have had if you were born to us and we'd had ten years of practice," I explained.
You focused on me, enjoying the fact that I hummed and purred as she worked her way inside me. I have no idea how long we enjoyed this position for, but it felt like a glorious eternity. The shaft Luna had chosen was charmed much the same as the replica of Blaise to let her feel what you would if you were inside me. She once told me that while the feeling was lovely, it wasn't quite as intense as her normal clit stimulation, and so, she's got quite the stamina when using a strap on. As evidenced by the fact that you pumped my mouth full and had to take a break to simply watch for a while.
I suppose I shouldn't really stress how foggy you've been because I got all caught up in your confusion myself. But, my love, my joy, my best friend in the world ... your due date wasn't last week ... it's today. I thought it seemed awfully "soon" for you to have been due after the boys were born, but I just assumed I was all mixed up from sleep deprivation, being up all night and all day with the boys.
Ooh, you know what, I think I am going to have to go to the greenhouses and see what we have as far as garden fresh vegetables in there. If we don't have them, I will have to stop and see Neville some time this week. I think we definitely need to plant carrots because they're so delicious, but I think we should plant spinach as well. Anything lettuce can do, spinach can do better. Oh Oh Oh! And sugar snap peas.
So, as promised, I slipped into his mind, led his mental self by the hand into a replica of his dorm in Hogwarts, which I then cleared out of all the unnecessary things - such as the beds and belongings of his dormmates. When the room was nice and empty, I created bookshelves and a large chest. Then I turned to him.
So, while we *could* have done the easy thing and hired a vehicle or 5 to take us all on driving tours, what's the point of being a wizard if you can't occasionally do things that muggles can't? To that end, we bought three large 'Hawaiian style' carpets and charmed them so that they could fly and would be invisible to anything under them. This allowed us to take the self guided tours, BUT get a whole lot closer to the sights if we wanted. We still maintained a safe distance from the lava flows and the like, but at least we got plenty of amazing pictures.
I want my name on your lips,
Kisa merely shrugged with a rather devilish grin. "Who knows?"
After waking and enjoying being the first to wake - for once - I watched you both sleep for about 20 minutes or so. Perhaps part of the reason I woke up before you was that I didn't have any of the babies weighing me down and keeping me asleep. You made for a heart bursting sight!
P.S. I can't believe Oliver is seriously SERIOUSLY thinking about playing around with other Oliver when his self-imposed three month limit has been met! Sooooo many naked Oliver bits.
Thank you so much for last night. I know it took a LOT for you to let my mother watch our kids for a bit, but you understood how much I needed you to help me. Oliver thought we were both certifiable, but he stood back and watched us get on with it.
Adopted October 15, 2009
I look at you and our daughter in our bed, I know a new life is hiding within you, I can feel the new life hiding within myself, and I have a day full of memories of our large extended family taking time to welcome our daughter into their lives.
Harry
"When she gets back to her home - I can only assume - she sets the box in her kitchen and prepares it so that she can put something in it. Then she turns and - !" I gasped again and covered my stomach with one hand as I covered my mouth with the other. "Picks up the battered body of a boy looking... oh... 5 or 6? And dumps him in the box. Then she struggled a bit as she carried the box to a cart of some sort, taking some time to hastily put just enough tape on the top that it won't blow open in a breeze. After that, she pulls the cart along until she reaches an empty field, and then... shoves the box off the cart before rushing away. In her rush, she doesn't notice that a man's hat has fallen out of her pocket. It's rather distinctive - a fashionable gray and black slouch hat..."
ARGH!!!
And I would never need to ban Hannah. Because she has NEVER thrust something in your arms without asking first. Even when she was trying to talk you into doing more cold cases when you went through that ridiculous phase of trying to never make me the slightest bit upset, she tried talking you into it, she tried pleading with you, she thought you were being stupid, but she went along with your wishes.
Remember warning: Angst and Drama
"You really won't," you purred, stroking my arm and waiting for me to look at you so that you could kiss me again. I moaned softly and stroked your collar.
I sighed. "I wasn't just a Death Eater - there were lots of those - I was part of the inner circle. I was Marked... I can't exactly deny that. That means that I had no choice but to do as the Dark Lord ordered me. Otherwise I would have been killed. My father probably would have been killed, and my mother would've been tortured for a very long time. I tortured people... and their screams haunt me... But as you can see, now that I *do* have a choice, I try to be better than I was."
I should probably start by saying today's ceremonies were beautiful, subdued, hopeful, and moving. I think those in charge of this particular day's events really toed the line between it being respectful of the victims while maintaining enough strength positivity to keep us hopeful for a better future. No matter how hard I try, I will never be able to understand what the victims of the trials went through. I am privileged enough, my parenting was widely known, that I never had to fear being forced into a farce of a trial where I had to prove I came into my magic "legitimately."
That particular part - about my dreams - was aimed at Harry, but the parts about starting and never being apart were for Oliver. "From this moment as long as I live, I will love you, I promise you this, There is nothing I wouldn't give, From this moment on, oh!"
Tuesday August 1st
"Well then, get it ready for me. We don't have all night you know."
Okay, I suppose that makes sense, you can't be too careful. I ignored the fact that she called it a date because there's not really a word for a blind date in the hopes of getting a friendship out of the deal. That was my first mistake.
After we were ready, not dressed, but clean and full from breakfast, I brought us to the ballroom where I gave her a magical sparkler that she could run/toddle around drawing pretty pictures in the air. As she did, I practiced a new bellydancing routine before adding some fire to the mix. She pretended to shriek in fear and run away whenever I breathed out a long plume of fire, but then giggled and ran back over to me to make noises as if begging me to do it again.
"I LOVE watching old games featuring him as the main Keeper!"
She tried to sit up and failed. This made her sigh rather morosely. "No... I'm pretty sure that I don't have enough energy for that. I feel so stupid and weak at the moment."

-Friday 8 December, we have a Unity Meet 'N Greet. Not sure if we're going to do a Movie Night or a Games Night. They've both done well in the past, but being so cold outside not sure if we should do movies because it's indoors or just layer an extensive warming charm outdoors.
If only.
Draco unconsciously brushed the back of his fingers along his jaw in thought. “HOW MANY kids?”
I really wanted to watch you thoroughly destroy them emotionally, that is definitely my favorite part! But they touched you Draco! They put their filthy, disgusting, hateful, pathetic, bigoted, worthless hands on you. Ugh, worthless cretins not knowing high quality humans when they see it. Fucking homophobes. They ruined ice cream time!
River shrugged, not meeting my eyes as he nodded.
"That was a good first try, Harry, but I'm certain you can do better," Luna encouraged gently. She was right; that hit had made me go: ooph! And I was looking for: Sweet buggering Salazar! What the hell?! Are you bloody trying to kill me?!?!
In the last roughly year and a half, you have gone from a single man playing the field, to a husband, a father of five, owner of multiple businesses, happily helping with the running of a school and an orphanage, the main fundraiser of said school and orphanage. You also have four new siblings that you are nurturing a relationship with, and two - basically three - godchildren who adore you. You have friends that love you, and parents that think you're amazing.
I loved everything about this weekend, but one moment sticks out as the absolute best. Can you guess it?
"Just because I let Emily go buy drinks with your money, it DOESN'T mean that we OWE you anything."
But this incident has hurt you so much that you will never again call Grandmama (Does she REALLY insist on being called that???) to have her kill someone. It doesn't matter what they've done, you've refused to play Judge, Jury, and Executioner - in essence acting like God over someone else's life.
The problem was that she was right to begin with, several of the higher ranking mobsters were growing dissatisfied with a leader who seemed to do nothing but pass her duties off to others. After the meeting was over, we spent several hours going over everything I'd learned, and also listening to all the surveillance recordings to see if I'd missed anything in all the grumbling.
Fuck Draco, you smell so good. I miss you.
"Huh? Oh! Seph can't sleep. She's too upset about Honey, so she's crying in her bed and Caelum came to get me because he says he knows better than to come in here when you two make goo goo eyes at each other when you tuck them in."
Saturday December 5th
Siri nodded in agreement. "So basically, he pushed everyone away. But I noticed that he always seemed to be alone, and I sort of barged in and MADE him be my friend."
I KID!!!
I'm going to sign off now and try to chat with Vanessa. Even if she doesn't respond, I can at least let her know that I'm trying. But before I go, just know that no matter what happens, I will be home tomorrow night. On the one hand, if I make progress and get her to open up to me tomorrow, we'll both need a break by nighttime, and on the other hand, if I DON'T, it'll more than likely be beneficial to have time apart at that point anyway.
My Own Beloved Husband,
. I must say that it was very well done, and I'm not just being biased because our brilliant son was the one singing and leading the dance.
And that was the first, lol. I was using skills that I've cultivated during OTHER situations by managing a post office. I was talking with customers, explaining the situation and helping them with their immediate needs, all while coordinating a massive operation on the scale of any raid I've ever been on. Probably bigger, if I'm honest.
"Fine, but don't blame me if mum decides you need to be grounded for not socializing with the rest of the family and eating a proper meal," I muttered.
And because we were both so frantic, we did a lot of wrestling around on the bed, both of us wanted to be the one inside the other as soon as possible, and normally you surrender to me even when you're in the rare mood to top, so... I surrendered to you. I had vowed to do whatever you wanted me to until I had made up for breaking your trust, and you wanted to prove to the world that I was yours.
Either way, Simon is most definitely magical and will be coming to Unity in about two weeks. He's six, and very shy, but very active. He was in talking with us for a bit, but he eventually joined you in the yard for the naval battle. He was the dark blonde boy with giant eyes. I doubt he said a word, but I saw him running circles around the sandbox. I can't wait to show him the climbing wall at the Park!
"That's rare!" Viper snickered.
I know it doesn't help the discomfort, but if it helps you emotionally, I need you to know that I find you insanely attractive right now. Your already normally perfect skin and hair have that healthy glow to them. Your belly, while you think it looks terrible, is smooth and gorgeous, you know I've always had a bit of a pregnancy kink where you're involved. Knowing you're carrying our children, sacrificing your comfort, holding them within your body, seeing you absentmindedly stroking your stomach with a fond expression of love, well it does some noticeable things to my cock.
Whatever God I have to thank for you being very possessive and horny lately, remind me to sacrifice a 100 kilogram box of chocolates to. I LOVE the fact that you wanted to mark and own me. We spent a good three hours in bed this afternoon just being together and doing all those things you suggested.
Oh dear! Oliver could you do me a favor and hold Harry's hand and support him so that he can be in a supportive frame of mind himself? Harry my love, Orion is going to need you to hold him and comfort him and give him that sort of loving warmth that only you can provide. It seems that Farrah has just committed suicide. She left a note saying that she couldn't live with the fact that her child is so different and that she feels such shame and horror for giving birth to 'it' that she had no choice but to kill herself.
So, rather than withdraw, I simply slowed way down and enjoyed rocking slowly in and out of you, even as I kissed you so many times that my head started spinning from lack of oxygen. Probably an hour passed like that before your needy little cries got desperate. Happy and almost ready to be done myself, I took the denial spell off of you and let you have your orgasm, which triggered one for me as well.
I am hugely blessed in that I do have two of you that try your best to understand and accept this about me. Even going so far as to turn into a woman for me for the night. Oliver, if you didn't figure it out at any point DURING our play, THIS is why I didn't want to just rush through it and have another go - or two - before turning you back. I wanted to take my time to ensure that I met all my wants and needs and ended up so satisfied that I wouldn't get the urge again until, well, hopefully when you feel like doing it again.
Sunday October 4th
I may be a bit biased, but I am pretty sure you are (tied with your older brothers and sisters) the most beautiful baby I've ever seen. When you're wrapped up and sleepy in your lilac blankie that Grandma Molly knitted for you, with your little hat Grandma Iris made for you, the only thing peeking out your gorgeous little face, you are a miniature version of your Daddy Oliver. That straight mouth that gives soft bemused smiles is the exact same. Those eyebrows that I'm sure will be a language all their own. Even the shape of your eyelashes up against your rosy little cheeks, exactly the vision I see when I wake before Daddy.

Friday at 8:31 AM
Lucky for him, five minutes later, I called Amala off and insisted that everyone walk sedately for five minutes before leading them through more stretches. Then I called for Muffy to bring out refreshments so that each person got exactly one of your freshly baked biscuits and a cup of tea - along with a big glass of water. As I ate my biscuit, I purred in enjoyment.
Our River shook his head. "No. I mean if I intended it to go that far, it COULD be, but I'm not ready for that yet."
Draco,
"And I'm a complicated case that I'll tell you all about later - AFTER you've wrapped your head around everything so far," Hazel added.
This morning, right after the two ritual crews showed up for practice, 'Mione stopped by to drop off a carrier built for bigger kids. She went out to a muggle store, it's a bit like I'm wearing him as a rucksack. She also cuddled up with him a bit before she left. Not so shocking, she was teary-eyed at his problems, but I think she hid it well from him. I hadn't heard him reference his looks compared to ours since that first day when he told us Jaz looked more like him than us, but sitting with 'Mione he was rubbing her arm and said, "Auntie looks like me too." He called her Auntie! It was so cute!
Crazy little thing called love,
Well, I suppose I am off to do as commanded and wake you up!
He straightened his spine and began yelling. "Now wait just a damn minute! You've spent a lifetime telling me to do what I love and be who I am! This is something I'm good at, something I love, and who I am!"
And now we're in the ballroom dancing. Well technically, you just stopped to take a loo break and I remembered to finish up and send this email, but you know what I mean.
I gently patted his cheek. "You just told me. Thank you, you've been quite helpful. I really don't think you have to worry about getting out of Azkaban for as long as you live. I do hope you like the cold and the despair, it's exactly what you deserve."
Other older adopted kids that are never in the story anyway, lol.
With a kiss to her cheek, I dragged you off to the nearest floo.
What better name to befit the newest little Malfoy Royalty than the Queen of Magic herself?
Also, Narcissa and Caelum, possibly Lily will grace us with her presence, are going to join us in the greenhouses. I get to spend my day with people I adore, introducing someone to one of my favorite hobbies.
Kingsley was here roughly an hour ago, he had just wanted to tell us that he'd already – late last night - finished interviewing any witnesses that were willing to come forward. Again, very little to go on, but a few people remembered a woman they didn't recognize. I suppose there can be some benefits to living in a smaller society; everyone may know everyone else's business but they also notice someone who doesn't belong. Their stories seem to be similar; a shorter woman, with dark brown/black hair, and very skinny to the point where one of the witnesses used the word emaciated.
Lainie was feeling quite guilty about being at Unity and missing class at Traditions. I had to explain that her being half asleep and still wound up from a holiday and coming in in the middle of the day would be much too distracting to the rest of the students. She can go back tomorrow well rested and at normal time.
The door flung open. "DAD!"
Ahhh! The bliss! Sweet Salazar we have a fantastic sex life!
Thursday August 27th
I think the part that frustrates me most is I now feel (and have for a while) that neither of you can possibly trust me like you say you do if you assume that the moment I'm out of sight - for example, kissing a stranger in a secluded hallway - that I'm going to take that from kissing to full on shagging against the wall. I'm actually not interested in that.
My Dragon,
My adorations,
I do not want us to have another baby because ten is a much better number than nine and we want it to be a nice even amount of children.
"Probably not, Haz is supposed to come home later today, so we'll probably get shaken awake in just a couple of hours."
If we're not talking names, maybe we can start to have a different discussion. We have our three month wedding anniversary coming up in a little less than two weeks. Yeah, three months. And if you don't want to have this conversation until we hit the three month mark that's fine. Hopefully you're not upset that I've brought it up now. I erm, well ever since your other universe doppelganger game to visit I can't get the image of two sexy Olivers out of my head.
"Calm down love," I murmured.
Besides, I figured out the reason he doesn't get along with other elephants, and it was because he was raised from a baby by a good human – an older gentleman - who treated him well. But the man eventually died of old age and Bandar was sent to the Elephant Reserve. At that point, he was just too old and set in his ways to become part of a herd, so he acted out against all of them until...
I have no idea how you managed to snag Viona on Friday while I was stuck holding Xander, but I don't really mind. It was a refreshing change to see Viona in your arms. The best part was when she was in your lap and insisted on holding Xander - the look on *your* face was priceless! And then when Midnight arrived and the fireworks began, Xander was wide eyed because even though he supposedly can't see far enough to see the fireworks clearly out the window, the explosions of light and color were still captivating. Elena had her head on my shoulder so that she could get a look at Xander's adorable little expressions, and then she fell asleep. I didn't realize it at first, but when I did, I couldn't help but kiss her head and ruffle her hair.
You know it's true
He frowned in confusion. "Why would they be harassed?"
Erm … I mean my very hard job of caring for children.
"I'm fine!" I snapped. "Or do I have to kick ALL your arses before you believe me?"
"I would have believed you if you hadn't looked shady as fuck as you said that!" Tiger accused.
And darling, I will be loving you 'til we're 70, and baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23, and I'm thinking about how people fall in love in mysterious ways, maybe just the touch of a hand, oh me, I fall in love with you every single day, and I just wanna tell you I am,
version, it's now number one. Although it could still be the silly bop dance song and I would think it the most romantic song now that it was the first dance with the loves of my life.
"Oh, yeah, they went through a divorce a while back. I can't stand my step-dad so I came here to live with my dad, but there's no doubt that both of my parents love me. And uh, I really hoped to find my heiress. Or, Eris I guess." Damnit! He's even cuter when he blushes. I couldn't help thinking about how cute this baby was going to be. And now, after he's here? Yeah, I was totally right, absolutely beautiful our little Luka is.
Draco
Harry
Oh, speaking of potions. It's Friday afternoon, and I just got back from the ministry. Once I am done with this email I will do my rounds and then head home for our afternoon exercise, but I thought I'd get all of my thoughts out first.
I examined my hands very thoroughly as I thought this over. You know how much I HATE having to admit to these sorts of things in person. I'd much rather retreat and think it over, and then write it out so that I can hide the parts I want to hide, but... Well... I'm utterly weak when it comes to denying those I love anything they want.
I can't wait to see what you have in store for us today! I guess it doesn't really matter, we could spend all day in the hotsprings or in bed or back to the geysers or just walking around hand in hand and it would still be a wonderful day by my standards.
You just always know exactly what to say to get me to pull my head out of my arse and see to the heart of the matter don’t you?
Yep, you were most definitely needed. You just have this natural instinct with some of these Kids. They listen to you. They know that while you might be a snob, you're never going to talk down to them. I get the impression that you don't think you're great with most kids because you're not baking biscuits and singing traditional lullabies. But I think most of the children really respond to your honesty. You don't try to tell any of them that they shouldn't be angry, or upset, or annoyed, you just give them a better outlet for those emotions. Want to beat up your abuser? Beat the crap out of this practice dummy instead.
And I'd like her to have a tutor. I know she wants to keep up her classes at Lainie's school, but I think it would be ideal for her to have a tutor who is specifically watching to make sure nothing falls through the cracks.
You would be in danger less as the Head Auror does more managing from the sidelines than being in the thick of things
Have yourself a merry little Christmas,
"I just have asthma!" She protested. "And I'm breathing fine now!"
P.S. So, erm… You know how a Wizard popped into Unity to ask for a bit of help and we agreed that I'd go with him since I know a few first aid spells? Well... it seems he's one of the rare few who give a damn about animals. He'd come across a Cheetah starving to death due to an injured leg, and so, I now have a patient to nurse back to health. But don't worry, I've tucked her into the garage. I'm also sleeping on a cot next to her, so if you wake up in the morning and can't find me, that's why...
"Elena..." I murmured, letting her know that she was going a bit too far.
Harry is excited and a bit overwhelmed.
I shrugged again. "Let me talk to Harry and see if he wants to join us, either way, we can probably go this weekend."
Edward Remus Lupin
I should really head to bed now. I'm sure the almost triplets will be awake for a feeding sooner than I'd like. And I was planning to stop in at Unity for a few hours if that doesn't mess up any plans you may have already made. I'm not planning on doing anything other than playing with the kids, so if you need me to take a baby or three or you need me to come home, just send me an insta-owl.
"Er...no?" He replied hesitantly, probably wondering if me telling him about me counted as a lesson.
Harry
Oh! Sounds like the little prince is out of his bath, off to go help him open his presents!
I hate blowing things out of proportion, I'd rather just happily blow things.
"Is Harry scheduled for later?" I wondered, because the sheer fact that you are pregnant means that you should be getting massaged at least once a week.
I pressed a finger to her lips and shook my head. "Tonight, I'm just a man with permission to stray as I like."
"Oh? So are you back from maternity leave then?" I asked curiously.
Oh, yesterday. So after we got home we had just enough time to clean up and then have dinner with the family before we had to head to Unity for movie night. I know I told you that I was taking three days for just us, but movie night doesn't count! I really debated whether to do the original animated 101 Dalmatians or the recent live action version. Obviously you know already that I chose the animated version. I don't know, when I looked at the trailers for the newer one I couldn't get past the creepy vibe I got from DeVil's thugs Horace and Jasper. I know they're supposed to be bad guys, but there's just something extra untrustworthy about that Horace character.
Tabitha gave me quite the look with that comment. "Yeah, like I need that information from you!"
Ok, if I keep thinking about ideas for songs we might be here forever. Maybe I should go into the Drag Show business and just get all of my ideas out week by week! Ha.
You want to know what they came up with? Not much at all. The blood in the office was all Robards. The magical signatures were all his (from casting various spells over the course of years). The FINGERPRINTS were mostly his with a smattering of other Aurors who have been in and out of his office over the years (he never allowed for a deep enough magi-cleaning that would have tidied those things up). As such, my fingerprints were in there and even YOUR fingerprints were in there, Harry.
At all.
And now you're enthralling all the kids by reading them an energetic story and doing all those lovely silly little voices you do. I'm going to sign off now and help my parents finish setting up the magic laptops I gave them. I think the only reason they hadn't bought any already was that they weren't quite sure what a laptop could do other than email - which they felt could be accomplished by the Insta-owls. So now, I get to show them the joys of solitaire and online shopping, hahaha!
Ok, so I won't tell your mum about the puppy, but you know that there's no way we're going to be able to keep it from Della or Sebastian. And even if we could, Viona is talking more and more every day and she WILL tell her! I think they have a strong women's conspiracy and some day they will overtake the world. So maybe you should preemptively strike and tell your mum first, but think of a really good way to tell her? Maybe with jewelry?
Monday March 15th
Annnnnd I don't think I am ever getting laid again after that offer. If your shivering and your facial expressions are anything to go by, I am pretty sure your bollocks pulled right back up inside of you.
Draco
Always Yours,
Mine.
I'm going to send this and go to sleep, but hopefully you don't see this until you've had a full night's sleep and are well rested. If it's morning, and I'm not there, I'm off for a run and there's a Ben and Jerry's under stasis in your top nightstand drawer!
Draco
Sebastian bit his lip in indecision. "Erm... I do rather like the little ones..."
Elated, I was then astonished to find that there were a few people surrounding us now that hadn't been there when the argument started.
So that's that. I'm signed, sealed, delivered. I am an official member of Hogwart's staff. I'm a teacher Draco! A real professor. I have to get tweed jackets with suede elbows. Maybe a few cardigans for casual Fridays. I suppose I can get teaching robes as well; I probably should for some of the more formal requirements, but that's the brill thing about being the Muggle studies professor, it's almost preferred that I wear cozy Muggle clothes. I should probably avoid ripped denims that show off my lack of pants though!
When all the kids had been sent off to their grandparents or friends' houses or older siblings' houses the six of us, Ollie, Draco, and myself, and Ron, Blaise, and 'Mione met up in the playroom. We were all in a wide variety of clothes; Ollie you were fully dressed, Draco nude as usual unless I've otherwise asked him to be dressed extra posh, I was just wearing a pair of black satin knickers. While Blaise was actually dressed up fairly posh, because as he said "it's a holiday and Harry loves it when the man taking him is fully clothed while he's starkers. Don't you Harry?"
Since you and Oliver were being vigilant - along with the parental chaperones - I decided to help out by keeping track of those that tried to sneak off from the main group.
Desperately Thankful,
And as usual, strolling hand in hand with you while we explored parts of the world we'd never seen, I don't think I have any words left for what it means to me. It's like everything aligns and I fell "right" with the world.
P.S. Wouldn't it be funny if any of our children ended up redheads since they could get that from my mother?
She nodded. "I will daddy, I promise."
Charlie leapt to his feet (note, his son was still at Molly's, so we weren't disturbing a nap or anything), and dragged me to his bedroom.
Harry and Oliver are being as supportive as possible and Draco is still processing.
Please remember that I love you!
You're right I would have been bored out of my mind listening to you and Charlie talk in depth about potions. I love that you're so brilliant, and I'm in no way trying to tell you to stop talking with me about them, but you could be speaking another language as far as my understanding goes. It's probably a bit different telling the specifics to someone who actually understands what you're talking about.
I had better finish up, I'm meeting Goyle in Godric's Hollow in a few minutes, then I need to pack since I leave tomorrow. I will be bringing my laptop so we can keep talking. But I will be looking forward to coming home and taking our next steps.  Enjoy the rest of the wedding festivities!
I love you more today than yesterday, but not as much as tomorrow,
I ferociously started ripping my clothes off when I got a strict, "Oi, Mutt, slower than that, I've missed you and I'd quite like a show."
Thanks to Hannah and Auror cooperation on muggle cases from time to time, everyone is equipped with those protective vests, but the reason you might be relieved is that I was still in the command tent for this bit. The raid team managed to overtake him and catch him with stunning spells, and so, despite his best efforts to get away or die trying, Charles Barden has been arrested and will face trial/punishment for what he's done.
It's been hours, HOURS, and you haven't sent us any sort of updates! I mean, of course I'm glad you're alright, but I figured at this point you would either have sent us a message saying you're done with office stuff and are awaiting our arrival at the Manor or an explanation why you are going to be late.
So many things I want to respond to in your email. I will get to them all. I want to talk about you purchasing Oleg for Unity House. I want to talk about how Miles is doing with his gender identity. I absolutely and most importantly want to talk to you about how proud I am for continuing to talk with Yesenia. But I have to start by letting you know, I also shudder to imagine you with no bollocks or tongue. I love every bit of you my darling, but those are two of my very favorite parts.
It's movie night and Draco might just have a new favorite.
After that bit where you were practically spelling it out for me, I really thought you were telling me that YOU were wearing them, and working with a team, so I assumed that you were getting those updates from a member of the team. I'd actually even convinced myself that Hermione was in on it, and that's why - despite pretending to be distraught - she'd given up and called off her Unspeakables so easily.
I'm sorry you're stuck with a crazy man.
She blushed and looked away. "Not so much. I just... I didn't take a potion or use any sort of protection. I was dating an older Slytherin for a bit, and at one point, he told me he wanted to break up - that he was interested in someone else. A bit desperate, I promised to do anything, but he was actually pretty adamant about breaking up. So I sort of kissed him and used a hand to work him up. There wasn't really time to think about protection."
Thank you for this life of ours,
Oi! When I said that I wouldn't mind a little marathon shopping session, I had no idea that I was basically condemning myself to shopping for a week straight! But if I'm honest, I had so much fun that despite being exhausted, I don't even care that I've been dragged all over creation by our brood.
We had coffee at The Attendant, which is a converted toilet that is now a café. We burned out our retinas at God's Own Junkyard, a neon sign gallery/museum/thing. And then we went kayaking on the Thames.
What was I saying?
I'll bet that neither of you can comprehend the profound sense of peace I had at that moment. Aside from the slightly surreal sight of both of my husbands being fucked by themselves, I felt like the world was perfect. I had everything I wanted and needed, and watching you both enjoy yourselves was a bliss that's hard to describe.
Draco, after last night, I feel much better about us. Knowing you're committed to me. To us. I am not ready to share you or Harry. But I think it would be fun to see you let other people work you up with dancing or touches - or even kisses - if I know at the end of the night you will be using all that pent up tension to satisfy me. And our Harry of course. Love-Oliver
She was shaking me emphatically at this point and I had to break her grip on me and control the urge to vomit.
I'm joking!
I'm obviously not saying that catching dangerous potion dealers or finding missing children is unimportant. It's definitely important. But so is teaching Trey about his heritage, it's just a matter of which one will bring YOU more joy?
And to top it all off, I'm rambling!!!
You look *gorgeous* when your face is all flushed from the cold. It makes me wish I could drag you out into the cold more often and have my wicked way with you. But that's not likely to happen as being naked in the cold isn't *nearly* as fun as it might sound.
Oh Harry! You wonderful perfect man you!
Back to my day in the kitchen, Ollie himself came in and snuck biscuits and dough throughout the day, but spent most of the day in the stables or so I hear. I had different children popping in to visit me in the kitchens throughout the day, sneaking their own spoonfuls of dough or practically burning their little fingers on biscuits fresh out of the oven. Keeping me company. Regaling me with stories of what everyone is doing. But even with all my visitors and unhelpful little helpers I had some quiet time to myself as well.
Wow, I went off on quite the tangent didn't I?
Is this what it's like for you? Oi!
Maybe we need to ask Healer Rowe for some stronger boosters. You've still been so sleepy. Your magic levels seem fine, but you've still had so little energy. I'm used to you jumping from place to place and having a million projects happening, and this listlessness is worrying me.
Friday November 24, 2017
Draco
Love,
Anyway, before my lawyers left, I managed to get them to tell me WHY in Merlin's explosive sphincter they won't let me see you or my parents. One would think that seeing my loved ones would be a basic right in this situation, and well... The answer is that YOU can't be trusted not to try to Apparate away with me.
"Better you than me, mate," Akihito murmured as he took a sip of tea.
"At this time of year, people traditionally were down to the last bits of food they'd set aside for the winter. This meant grain mostly, but also root vegetables such as parsnips and potatoes, and possibly the very last of the extremely wrinkly apples. It wasn't a time when large feasts were made, but a minor sacrifice would be made by making special loaves of bread to eat."
Hermione has spent the last decade living in another country. Arguably she also has the benefit of having a good relationship with other Magical communities. And she has not only run Traditions Britain and then moved on to its Russian counterpart, but running a school full of hormonal insane children could be pretty good experience for running a country full of squabbling adult children. So, I guess what I am saying is, if you don't want to run I will wholeheartedly support Hermione. But I really do think you are the more logical choice.
"Good idea," you agreed. "But we sent both our elves off to wrangle the dogs."
“-Good evening everyone, thank you so much for coming and celebrating these two young people's first step towards creating a life together. If you didn't know already, I am Harry, one of Viona's Dads. She came into our lives when she was six months old, and despite adoption not having been in our plans at that moment, we knew she was meant for our family. She settled herself into our hearts and her stubborn little self refused to budge. Not that we particularly wanted her to. She was our first child, and such a great example of how wonderful children are, that we have pretty much never stopped!
So anyway, we started our game with 10,000 Galleons each because we wanted to keep the possible amount lost relatively low. But as usual, I kept winning. What can I say? It's a family gift. Pansy hates losing, especially since she's pregnant and couldn't have more than a single glass of wine. It was a nice, pricey bottle that the rest of us got to polish off for her. An 1876 Chateau D'or that tasted smooth and sweet and was well worth the 413,000 Rubles Pansy paid for it. Don't be alarmed, that's only about 5000 British Pounds.
I have no bloody idea how you keep managing to do this to me!!! I checked THREE TIMES to make sure I had the right clothes before I left, and yet SOMEHOW when I arrived and went to change into my bespoke sparring outfit, I find YET AGAIN that you've switched out my shirt with a T-SHIRT!!!
That said, I immediately began work on plans to create a safe place for those kids - similar to the park I created in London.
After a tiny bit more time passes, the body looks less frozen and more pink. I can see breaths creating a faint mist, that get bigger and more 'steamy' until the body sits up and leans against the wall. Eventually, the man wakes up and - somewhat ironically - tends to his OTHER leg. This actions calls to my attention the fact that it's been broken somehow. He's done a rather good job of splinting it, and looks like he'd be more or less fine if someone happened along to help him at that moment.
Smirking, I turned to Oliver. "What say you? Have a preference?"
My own philosophy is evolving. I was forced to see that some of the things I was raised to value aren't... I'm going to go with as good as I was led to believe and leave it at that. For example, I can admit that some muggleborns are smarter than me, but now I feel like I have to go wash my mouth out again, so obviously, it's still a work in progress.
In case you are confused or not quite understanding the reason Draco seemingly 'lied' about not noticing Mahafsoun has hair, the reason he did that was because Harry once upon a time ago threw an absolute fit about Draco playing with Mahafsoun's hair, and in response, Draco promised to never mention her hair again, he was even going to go so far as to try not to notice it. Thus even when she asked him for help with styles for her wedding, he never actually said the word hair in conjunction with Mahafsoun. He kept referring to style or braids, but not hair.
"Stop making goo goo eyes at each other!" A pair of six year olds told us off, making us both laugh.
The truly fun side effect of the whole situation is that apparently me speaking Parseltongue gets you super hot. I had no idea the snake language did it for you! We've been together for basically eleven years now, and this might be the first time you've heard me speak it since we were children. So anyway, once Viper was completely out of our room, you lost no time in stripping me down and having your way with me. Did you enjoy me continuing to speak Parsel? I know you don't actually speak it so I must translate for you, I was begging you to take me, claim me, prove I'm yours, own me completely. And then you got me so hot that I'm not completely sure what I was saying by the end; mostly just "please" and "more" and "harder" would be my best guess.
Grandpa Harry
A woman takes a husband
"He's sitting on his sofa, eating curry and watching telly, when there's a knock on the door. He smiles as he stands up, and it looks as if he was expecting a friend. Instead, he opens the door to reveal a group of men - all looking rather hard and grim.
It doesn't really matter what I think about it. Why is this MY business anyway? Because I thought up a quick idea for it? You put in all the legwork. Well, it's most likely that Pippa did. Why isn't this business in Pippa's name? Although, to be fair, Pippa does a lot of work for a lot of our businesses. I think it's about time for another Pippa raise wouldn't you say?
Thankfully I had Viper on hand to help me convince him that even if he worked, say 6AM to 6PM, it would STILL be better than what he's currently doing. And actually, without MY input at all, Viper sort of threatened dire consequences if Tiger didn't drastically cut back. The sort of consequences that all begin with the letter D, so...
"Sure thing, chief!" Girly agreed in a tone that suggested that she was looking forward to it. I knew that with Apparation, I wouldn't have time to so much as summon a bathrobe, so I didn't even bother to move and risk letting the criminal escape.
Yeah Harry, you're right; that's not getting old anytime soon.
No no, what I want is to have all the training so that you will be reassured that I know every possible thing that I might need to know, and then do what I have been doing in the past. Use the unique skills I have to help out or consult with the Aurors as they need. So, for example, if they ever need me to go undercover again, I could without feeling like I need to keep it a secret from you to keep you from worrying about me. I mean I'd probably be tempted to keep you from worrying, but I recognize your need to be ABLE to worry about me if I'm doing something like that.
Harry
But as I was saying, as I was drifting awake, I realized that you were feeding Morgana, because the soft grunts she makes as she eats sound somehow different than either of the boys, and that means the baby I could feel nursing from the harness had to be one of the boys. Sure enough, I woke up to find Gabriel drinking rather greedily from the replica breast. Smiling, I poked his cherubic little cheeks and tickled his tiny toes.
Draco
I want to apologize to start with. I'm so glad we did this with the mind healers because I don't think any of us went into the session looking at things from each others' perspectives. Oliver and I had our feelings hurt when the most recent flirting/snogging/going "too far" situation happened while we were in France. You were initially mad and then supremely apologetic. We talked and we all love each other, but the weeks between the incident and this session included a lot of Draco apologizing over and over again while Oliver and I kept forgiving and forgiving.
Calmly and with hope,
"Erm..." I droned as he ran off and disappeared with a loud crack. "What just happened???" But there was no one to answer my question.
"Maybe?"
My sleepy love,
I'm officially 29 weeks today; one more week down, seven more to go! I can do this!
At any rate, McGonagall said she was going to visit you on Monday, so, knowing you and guessing what she'll do, chances are good that she'll show up right after she finishes her breakfast in the Great Hall and you're just about finished reading this email, hahaha. Unless you read it this weekend (but I plan to take you shopping without the Kids, so you might not have time). Probably a good thing I won't be awake to pop into your office and suck you off, buwahahahahaha!
But the best part is the feisty five and the toddler trio are standing at the edge of the dancers watching their Daddies. The look on their faces ... like they know how much we love each other and they're so happy about it. I know we often embarrass our kids with how in love we are. Or more specifically how much smooching we do! But I always hope we're giving them a good example about what a loving relationship should look like. And if the sparkles in their eyes are anything to go by, I think they know it.
She shook free from his grasp and slapped him across the face, which interestingly enough, had no effect because the wards on the place to prevent violence.
He shrugged. "Just fine."
We all slept fine, except Ren (and Nicky who likes to be up when his sister is up) who woke up a few times. Nothing crazy, just more often than usual for our sleepy songbird.
Tiger sighed in relief that he was right and didn't have to worry about an unknown person coming after him later. He held out his hands commandingly. "Nobody move! My bodyguards have set up a lot of muggle style security cameras around this room throughout the week so that we could catch the person trying to murder me in the act. My chief bodyguard even set himself up as bait, and we have proof that we can play right now that Gawain Robards is actually the assassin; that he just tried to murder my chief bodyguard thinking that he was me - as he was led to believe."
Draco describes the Candlemas ritual.
"In any case, about two years passed, in which time they nearly succeeded in breaking me," the Viper continued stonily. "If not for the ability to shift forms and sort of exist in a somewhat purer animal body with a simpler mind, I don't think I would have survived with my mind intact. Voldemort regularly had me help Bellatrix torture others. He expected me to kill on command. We shared the Elder Wand, but even when I was 'armed,' I couldn't kill him, and believe me, I tried. The wand wouldn't kill him any more than it would kill me. So we were at a bit of a stalemate."
And bonus, on the weekends, River is going to be rather busy for the next 8 or so months as Aya has decided that she is going to have him learning new techniques for an hour or so each day, and practicing the fuck out of them on the weekends. Thus, he'll be out of the house during the majority of the time she's in it. And when they are both in the house at the same time, we'll plan family activities so that they have to both be in our view at all times.
Alright, so maybe I really mean bickering with you, and maybe it's a lot more fun that I care to admit. I actually sort of miss the days when I could just walk up to you and insult everything I could think of *just* to see your vibrant green eyes flash and your nostrils flare.

Wednesday December 26th
Draco's not the only one with Dragon Flu.
I'm so sorry you had to deal with that dream. I think it was probably worse for you because you've had so many visions that came true and it probably has to horrify you at the idea that we could have done something so terrible. You, my heart, know better than to think we would have done anything like that to anyone.
Well, not really start typing because you wouldn't know I was rambling until I hit send.
So in case you were wondering why I burst into tears and immediately apparated away, that is why. I had a shite morning, I can't stand myself, and I can't stand anyone else. So I came to Molly's where she fussed over me while I cried.
My second thought was that the baby could have been glamoured to look like you, but that immediately defeated itself because that wouldn't fool a paternity test, and so, would not be a viable tactic if the goal was to successfully extort money from you.
"What's going on?!?!" You demanded a bit harsher than you intended, I'm sure. I intuitively knew that you weren't upset about me having an unknown female in our room, but rather, incredulous and probably more than a little irate that she was CLEARLY too young for me.
Love you,
As the crime scene was being investigated, a couple teams of detectives were actually investigating me and the old owner of the warehouse. They were fairly certain that neither of us were the killer - especially since I'm not really old enough to have been killing people in Japan for 42 years. Also, the old owner died before the last victim was murdered, but they still had to suspect him. After all, he owned the warehouse and would have been in the perfect position to use it and never let anyone else know.
Go.See.Rowe.
Harry
"Fine..."
You wrote it down and then thanked him profusely, getting caught up in a rather long (and probably boring) conversation with him while I kissed you, took the paper, and handed it to Bletchley.
And... That sort of led to my second big and rather unpleasant discovery of the day.
Now that my head isn't throbbing; oh my Draco, my dragon, my love, you could not have made me happier than with that email. Your practice is paying off because you admitted your love brilliantly! But you said you would take advantage of my squeaky cleanliness when I wasn't drunk and you were already gone to pick out Teddy's attire when I clawed my way out of bed. I would be upset that I had to wake alone but when I sleep off my drinking until one in the afternoon I have no one to blame but myself. And your father!
Love You,
I can’t even think straight (haha, never straight, it’s NOT the time for jokes right now!) I’m so mad. I’m serious! (No I’m Sirius, haha, shut UP!)
"Yeah, I'm prolly gonna take her home and rock her to sleep. You stay and have fun. Tell Luna to take over for me and force you to please every man in the club, or whatever strikes your fancy."
Unless you said that on purpose, then you crack me up.
"Oh, and I could really go for some golden starlet caviar on rye crackers. With some tuna sashimi on the side," I added.
"Fuck!" He blurted out, dropping the box.
My beautiful husbands,
Well, I'm certain Zaire made a feast of some sort to enjoy while we relax. But the point is that we're all going to be together and doing nothing but spending time with each other. Probably around a bonfire.
P.S. How was your talk with Hermione? I was too tired to ask yesterday.
I feel like I haven’t seen you in days! Between your sleep schedule and all of your last minute prep with Ernie, all your time has been scheduled! Well, aside from midnight creepings when you just stare at me ... I mean read.
My love,
Leon Caughey-Black
Contritely, remorsefully, and apologetically yours,
She gave him a significant look. "Are you saying your word?"
"Impossible, since I have the best husband in the world," I insisted haughtily.
It shouldn't be too bad, it's just one mobile baby right? No. Guess who started crawling after his sister on Wednesday morning? Oh that's right, Orion. At least when he's crawling after her they're going in one direction, the real fun comes when they spread out.
"Draco love, we're having a full circle dinner to welcome our new family members." "Oh okay, let me just crawl out of our closet and cast a few glamour spells..." "Hi everyone, welcome to our home, here's our new granddaughters Meadow and Cascade, and our newest adopted daughter Rita." "Wait... WHAT???" "Oh, didn't I tell you?"
We're headed home! Oh my love, we are going home. Don't get me wrong, I've had a fantastic time in California. We got Hazel something she's been dreaming of for pretty much her entire life. We got to see River all settled in, ready to start married life in his new home. And, oh yeah, there was that whole getting a new child coming into our family!
"BLOODY FUCKING HELL, DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY!" You roared.
But if we find a child of ours at Unity. Or if one of us gets the all clear from Healer Rowe. And you're sure you're doing this because you want more children and not because you want to win. Then I'm in.
Oliver laughed at the glazed over and lusty look on your face. Then he turned back to me, put a hand on the back of my neck, and pulled me close enough to kiss. "Deal!"
It is NOT deadly, and so there is no need to worry. I'll be fine once the potions kick in - which will take about a day. Maybe two. The only reason that I'm being held hostage at St. Mungo's is that it CAN be deadly to babies under a year old, and so, it's best if I'm not near them until I've passed the contagious stage. Rowe is fairly certain that they must not have caught it already since - being so small - they would have exhibited symptoms before even me had they caught it at the same time or shortly after I did.
P.S. My right hand isn't seeing much action, sadly. I have too many extra spectators in my bed at the moment for that. Although, the bath is still a great place to be XD
Almost the end.
I really did very little touching or actual work. What happened was, as I was shifting you, I noticed you were hard in your sleep. I had Muffy take the princess to rock her in our sitting room for a bit. Then I slipped down your pants, and I was trying to be very gentle because you were so sleepy. So I very very slowly took you in my mouth and down my throat, and by the time you were all the way in, you had started to move on your own. You must have hit the part of the dream at that point where you were fucking me, because you started to fuck my mouth. So I laid there and let dream Draco take awake Harry's mouth for his own pleasure.
I really should have thought of checking with Robards or Bletchley or Kings or any number of your Auroring buddies. Once I realized I didn't have many more places to look for you, I thought to check my email. Well, lucky me, you had sent me an email.
Official list of all of your fellow travelers ...
Love,
Sighing, I explained as little as necessary. While I agree that I might eventually need to tell him the whole story, I also think he doesn't need to and SHOULDN'T know the entire thing all at once - as it is rather a lot to take in. Let him have it in bites, you know?
Draco
Sorry, back to the events. So the babies and I are just sitting around waiting for you, and I haven't seen Lainie yet, and out you come, all dressed and ready, looking fit as can be. I, of course, want to compliment my husband. You had these super fitted black pants on, and then a looser flowy shirt with wide sleeves. You looked good enough to eat. So I thought I should compliment your outfit that you were so excited about.
I’m just so unbearably proud of him.
I'm obviously taking the day off from Traditions because I have an extremely competent assistant who can see to things for one day. So, I was hoping that you'd come over and spend a bit of time with me, seeing as how word is that you're taking a few days off yourself. We can have a mini friend date at a tea shop and just chat. It'll be wonderful, don't you think?
Harry
Age 9
Happy Friday! For anyone keeping track, three days until my due date! Any day now!
Monday April 8th
Sunday November 18th - about 2-3 hours after the previous email
"Bring her to Unity House and have a Mind Healer evaluate her," I finished. "The Department of Families and Children actually can write temporary orders for her to be detained until they have a chance to look into her parents and home life. Lastly, I'm dead certain this couple made her sign a magically binding contract, so they may actually have some legal right to her that will need to be looked into."
I just giggled my way in to my office this morning. Last night was yummy. I’ve not done that before. It was so good and so hot, waking up to the helpless feeling from being bound and then the first thing I see is you taking your pleasure by riding me! Merlin you are so bloody fit!
Draco
Oh Draco, my Draco. You came home to us. It's well past the time I would normally fall asleep but I can't let myself close my eyes. What if I close them and when I wake up I find your homecoming was a dream and you're still out there? I don't know how I'd react to not seeing you when I wake up now that I know you're home. So I will just stay awake. Don't worry, I have plenty of pepper-ups to get me through tomorrow.
And you both know, wherever we are, whatever we are in the middle of, come Hell or high water, I AM going to come home to see Hazel and Pearl's baby born. I'm so unbearably excited to meet this teeny tiny human who already owns a part of my heart. It seems like every time we have a child, grandchild, niece, nephew, honorary circle baby, etcetera, born I get this anxious feeling. I need to know them, I need to hold them. I feel as though I've yet to meet a piece of myself. We have had so many beloved children come into our lives, each one a miracle and loved more than words can say. I don't have favorites or anyone I love more. I love each of them more than anything else on this planet.
Orion is doing well in all of his classes and in Quidditch despite how much he's overextending himself running his own business in the evenings. You didn't give him the illegal time-turner, did you?
Thank you for pretending that Eris' first time crawling was this morning. I know you were lying, she certainly didn't look like it was the first time, but it was nice to pretend I didn't miss it over the last few weeks. Oh well, I missed Viona's first time crawling as well, apparently our children like to wait until they're really good at it before they show off to Daddy Harry. And show off she did; crawling and baby babbling her way into my lap. She had so many things to tell me. Obviously none of the things she had to say were in any language I understood, but I thoroughly enjoyed listening to her.
Hazel and Eris joined me, claiming that they were having a hard time sleeping without Viona - and surprise surprise, Orion followed soon after. I know that the four of them still tend to sleep snuggled in a pile like puppies, but I thought Viona'd made a point to stay in her own bed for the last week or so in order for them all to get used to her being on her own.
She actually hugged me and returned the phrase before running off. By that point, I felt nearly ready to get up off the floor. Oi! Remind me to stretch my back out more often!
Tonight was so hot! I know I say that all the time, but it's always true. You are so hot and when you let me tie you to your spanking table so that I can torture you with toys and orgasm denials spells, I feel like I could just burst from how hot it is!
Sebastian is not a werewolf and Draco is very relieved by this. Besides, the potions haven't had time to fully brew.
One of the things on Friday's agenda is talking about the Drag Show Fundraiser. Wait, you might not have any idea about that. I think we talked about it when you were chatting with the Viper. You know how Unity California is having some financial troubles? There just isn't enough funding coming in to cover the house. The muggle recession in the U.S. has gotten so bad it's filtered its way into the Wizarding World too, there's just not as much extra money for charity. So Blaise, Ron, and I were trying to come up with some creative fundraising ideas, a gala is a bit too traditional in times like they're having. Instead of getting a few wealthy donations, why not throw a big entertaining party that we can pack in the people and get a little money from each person.
Everything I am and more,
You're still meditating. You've never meditated this long.
Monday July 24th
Give Viona love and kisses for me, and pat your bump for me and tell little Eris that her other daddy loves her! I should be home soon.
In the meantime, I'm about to go have a nice long sparring session with Antonio and Phillip. Good for Oleg (the new Krav Maga teacher), it seems that Elena has complained that there aren't any girls to spar with since Kisa went home, so a whole bunch of other kids are showing an interest in learning too. So, it will be a proper class, and that's probably what I'm most chuffed about. So many of these Kids (especially the current crop) come from bad situations, and I sort of feel that perhaps *requiring* all the Unity Kids to learn self defense - well, surely it would be beneficial to all of them to learn the skill.
And they have a picture ..... No, not a picture of new baby Blaire. Not a picture of Ron. Not a picture of Hermione ... well I suppose she's IN the picture.
Robards shook his head even as he chuckled in amusement. "You know, I've actually always believed in you. I see in you a man who genuinely wants to make the world a safer place - for all your MANY children. I don't even need to be a Legilimens to see it, just a good judge of character. That said, I'm EXTREMELY glad that you AREN'T a criminal! I have conversations like these with you, and I'm always left wondering how you can be so... dare I say CRIMINALLY smart, and yet, you put that brilliance towards CATCHING criminals."
I have my husbands, my children, we realistically will never have to worry about money so we wouldn't have to concern ourselves with finding a muggle job that we wouldn't understand. I can do anything for my wonderful family from the strength of the arms wrapped around me.
So what I am really saying is that I need you to come hold my hand so that we can calm each other and prepare ourselves to remain united and supportive no matter what. Love you!
I don't even know if he complied. I had already thrown up a shield on myself. As much as I wanted to tear her apart - and I do - she must have been utilizing a ton of magic in simply keeping the wards up. So I channeled all of my magic into shielding myself while she threw spells at me. I really wanted to be a hero, but more importantly, I wanted to come home safe to you. I had blown up her wards, so I knew the Aurors were on their way, I just had to keep her focused on me so they would have time to apprehend her. Which they did. Between the noise her spells were making and her own shouting, she didn't even hear them come up behind her.
I have now not only accepted Orion's choice of business, but come to accept it as a rather nice place to be when one HAS to party in mostly responsible ways.
The play began about five minutes late, but it was such a powerful opening that I don't think anyone minded the extra wait - aside from you, who had been biting your nails the entire time.
I know we give them an allowance and would be perfectly happy to financially support them for the rest of their lives, but I also recognize the value of giving them enough money to either invest and increase (like I did) or make mistakes with. Obviously, I'm hoping for the first one, haha. I also know that we each have a fortune to split amongst them, but we also sort of keep our fortunes separate - probably so that they can't BOTH disappear should the economy happen to plummet and all my businesses run dry at the same time.
With tears streaming down his cheeks, he trudged very reluctantly over to me, not even protesting my unflattering nickname for him.
I've got a couple of ideas for things we can do during this magical detox. Although my first idea ... and the only one I've shared so far to take a vacation across the pond, to either Florida or California, Disney World or DisneyLand ... was shot down.
That might even be something we can do for all of our honoraries. It keeps them from having to make the actual, legal decision to split from their first families (where applicable obviously) but Magic herself will bind them to us.
I raised a brow. "You want to see if HE'S worthy, but not me?"
"And why do you look like Viper beat you up again?" He wondered, eyeing me curiously.
He stroked my back again. "If that happens, just remember that I'm a lawyer and can help permanently solve the problem for you - BEFORE your husband invites our aunt Kisa over to do it."
"Oh love, it's not the end of the world. I know it SEEMS like the worst thing ever that no one is interested in having a relationship with you, but that just means that you will know when you find the right person that it was meant to be. I imagine it'll be when you least expect it, you'll realize that someone is interested in you, and it'll shock you but you'll be happy."
My only concern with staying a full month here and then going to Unity Japan? We have to do Hogwarts shopping for Viona. Our princess is headed off to Hogwarts in just over a month. I know she doesn't need much more than a few books and her robes, but the annual trek to Diagon to prepare for Hogwarts is a tradition. Oh gods Draco, our baby girl is headed to Hogwarts. I know she'll come back all the time, even nightly if she really wants to, but it's going to be so hard without her here every day.
She nodded and took the biscuit, nibbling on it ravenously. She most certainly didn't look malnourished, so I was fairly sure this was just never ending pregnancy hunger. Then I held out my hand again.
"Daddy, look! I learned how to cast the Dragon Slave!!!"
Sure, technically you didn't do anything we've not explicitly stated was alright. Kissing and groping in a party atmosphere and going home to shag with us. Those were the limitations yeah? Then tell me why you didn't come home with us? Why you didn't shoot us an insta-owl. Why you didn't catch my eye and poke at my occlumency shields so I knew you were safe and doing something to help out a young person in trouble?
"I love when you get possessive," I murmured, smiling at you and pretty much forgetting that everyone else existed.
I was actually running about five minutes late at this point, and so, was not surprised that my students had already stopped running and moved to the classroom. I didn't even say anything as I led Tiger into the room, as I was going to wait until I was at the front of the class. However, my students all heard the door open and turned to look at me. When they saw the Tiger, several of them burst out wailing.
She mentioned the artifact by name and included its location. It was enough to pull a warrant for the Goblins to check for its existence within the Mulciber vault. Guess what was there?
I love you. You and I have been unbelievably close for years. You officiated my wedding and I stood in as best man at yours. You are practically a brother to me, and having grown up with no one, I don't take these kinds of relationships lightly. Which is why it's a bit hard to say this, but I must.
Hopeful,
Gotta go!
After you and River got back from Unity, he came flying into the play room where I was trying to find a good mix of toys to bring for Jaz and Zaire. I guess he thought you were going to come find me and immediately fill me in on all the details. So he started in on his version before I had any idea what was happening.
But I really really really love your cock. And not just what it does to me when you're buggering me. But that's amazing. It's just the perfect size. Deep enough to really feel it. Thick enough for a nice stretching burn. I can always feel it the next day, but it's not so intense that I feel the need to shoot healing spells up my bum.
Thursday April 19th
My business concluded for the day, I returned home in plenty of time for dinner.
Whatever you need to tell yourself to feel comfortable at the Slytherin Reunions my darling.
"You! I'm going to partner you with the Princess from now on. I know that you're both new students and I want the new students to pair with the returning ones, but I feel that you'll be the best partner for her," I explained.
"Yes Dragon," you murmured, trying to look shyer than you really were.
I did worry a bit that her attitude was because of our age, but Yesenia assured me this is normal at her age no matter the age of the parents, and whether or not the child is adopted or biological. Kids are going to continuously push the limits to see how far they can go and to see they're cared for.
Mason Goyle
And then there're those vocalizations again. I really love them so much. Anyway, I think you can see why I think Kisa would love this song you had me learn, haha. Note, Kisa wasn't singing the song TO me - as a lover might - but to me because she wanted to share a song she loved and thought I would like.
Wow, your intense dancing instruction is no joke. I like to think I'm in pretty good shape. I run daily. I work with weights and resistance a few times a week. I try to stick with the auror training regimen that got me in good shape. But dancing worked so many muscles I didn't even know I had! I'm a bit sore this morning but I'm mostly just really excited to add a new workout.
Once she was calmer, we came back just in time for me to witness River wail dramatically and storm out of the room. I handed Amala off to Padfoot and followed him (after giving you a kiss). In his room, I decided to focus on calming him before anything else, so I pulled him into a hug and just held him tight for a long time. When he seemed ready to talk, I sat on his bed with him.
P.P.S. I'm so sorry, Oliver my love. I honestly DIDN'T mean to forget that your parents tagged along as well. I just… didn't really spend much time with them on the flight here, and so, I suppose they got lost in the crowd, hahaha. Ask Pippa how many times I've forgotten about her when she's literally been AT MY BACK, and then maybe you won't feel so vexed that I forgot to include your parents in my email head count. Love you!
Wednesday September 22nd
I used to be in a really dark place, and I blame my continued existence on my therapy. I don't currently feel as though I "need" therapy, but I still go. Just not as often as I did during the dark days. I consider it continued brain maintenance. It's almost as important as my maintenance spankings! I'm kidding, I'm kidding!
Rowe says that Draco is fine, more or less. He originally had a bit of cracked skull and swelling where he hit his head, but she took care of that. The problem now isn't anything physical, it's...
"What???" He asked in a guilty tone with a nervous gulp.
After watching Miles and Blaise's performances, Lucius demanded we pick out the perfect song for him. So in case you are keeping track, one evening of dance has now nabbed us three additional performers. I am probably way too excited to see Lucius perform in drag.
"Oh luv, it's fine, get it all out."
Harry nodded and obeyed without a single word. I lay my head on the edge of the tub and watched him actually conjure a small rope that promptly tied itself around his hands behind his back.
, I think I might have been happiest of all when she let me take control of what was played next so that I could sing TO her as she simply snuggled into me and swayed. Naturally I sang Sweet Child of Mine.
I knew we'd be allowed to bring our Godchildren to the Cultural Center eventually, I just wasn't sure about the plans or the available space for the soft opening. If each booth were literally expecting say thirty people and we showed up with four extra, that could really mess up their plans.
Sigh... Maybe I'm just not meant to do this. It's more painful than expected and I'm not certain the benefits will be worth the hassle. But at least I feel rather sleepy myself now, so, I'm going to snuggle up to Lily and see if we can both go to sleep.
You can see why I'm currently hiding under a blanket in a closet in the dark with my laptop as my only light and the only thing I have to assure me that there's a good reason that I don't just Apparate into an active volcano - there are quite a lot on the eastern peninsula of Russia of Kamchatka, I hope you know.
I opted for a rather fiery look with orange and red highlights at the tips, to match the flame decals on all of my nails. Shtara went for a similar look, but in dark blue and purple. Honestly, had we not had Wojtek with us - who got a bit fussy after being fed, let out to do his business, and thoroughly massaged (the therapist was utterly in love with him by the time we left) - I probably would have opted for a soak in the mud followed by a quick shower, a few minutes in the sauna, and then a body wrap. But as I said, Wojtek got a bit fussy, and I think what he really wanted was for me to put him back in his carrier so that he could take a nap.
*pants into a bag*
I honestly have NO IDEA how night time arrived so quickly! But eventually it was time for the Unity Kids to go to bed, and so, after catching up with the caregivers for a bit, we went home. At which point, Amala expressed how upset she was to be the only one left at home by demanding my attention for at least an hour. But eventually you had enough of sharing me and dragged me to bed.
Rest assured, it was time we got a new bed anyway, so I'll go shopping tonight (if you're still not speaking to me, otherwise we can go together) and buy a new one before bedtime.
1- She is going to take the sex-drive reducer at a fairly high dosage. That should build up in her system and her drive should be nothing within two weeks. If that is the case and within two weeks her desires are at basically zero, we will know she just has a hyperactive drive. Then we will have another meeting to figure out how much of the potion she should continue to take. At fourteen, she shouldn't be spending hours each night trying to take care of herself, she should be sleeping. So we will probably lessen the potions so that she still has some desire as is normal for her age, but still have her take some dose so that she can have an active life outside of those needs.
-It did, I love you both. -Oliver
The fucker.
She smirked at me, damn Malfoys and their damn smirks. "Of course I take them off but it's fine! Have I gotten injured or died yet?"
Again the confused, or maybe we had moved onto the "Harry you're an idiot" look on his face, "No woods, no outside, I live there, play with my kids, comiendo your food."
Aww, that's actually so precious! You've got the device strapped on and ready to go, and now that we've explained what it is and demonstrated it, he's curled up in your arms, letting you snuggle him as he nurses from the artificial breast. I strangely can't wait until it's my turn!
Sighing and looking a lot like a puppy someone kicked for no reason, our River slunk out of the room.
My Dragon,
All of my love forever,
"Er..." Oliver droned uncertainly.
I will absolutely mention the potential of having a wizarding ancestor to Hermione! Now that I am done researching for Unity House and Traditions, maybe I will finally take the time to look through the Potter and Black records. There is a Black that married into the Potter family (although not my direct line), so it wouldn't surprise me if I find some Blacks popping up if I dig further back.
Glupyy Plemyannik, I'm getting weird messages from my mother. Go home.
Well, see, you and I are only approximately 10 years older than them, and so, most people assumed that we were just a large group of friends out having a lark. Thus, anyone who liked the look of us came over to flirt with us and see just how friendly we were. As it turns out, friendly enough to - as I said - horrify our girls! Ahahahahahahaha!
Oi mutt,
Well, it seems that Elena had been watching our practice with a specific goal in mind. You were half right; she DOES want to be part of our team. More specifically, she wants to be the new leader. During one of our breaks, she asked if she could invite a few people from HER team over to practice a dance of their own. See, those who didn't graduate with Elena are continuing on in her footsteps - so the students definitely have a performance planned. BUT Elena wants to put a bit more of the ritual in their hands.
Other River sighed in relief. "I was beginning to think that something might be wrong with me for not being ready for any of that."
Question: "Growing up with Harry Potter as a father, do any of you believe there might really be such a thing as magic?"
My ONLY Dragon,
You cast a circle for us, I pulled the incense I had in my pocket in the hopes he would say yes and gave it to River, and the three of us sat knees together, tucked in close.
If you don't mind of course!
Right about 10:15, the room fell silent and I looked up to see why. JUST in time to see Viona and Alric enter and look around the room and BLUSH SO HARD!!! Buwahahahahahahahaha!
I smirked at him. "I have a feeling that you're not going to be making any more Mind Healing sessions."
I may as well start describing what happened from my own point of view so it's clear and concise and ready to tell as soon as someone comes in here. And honestly Draco, how did you survive when you come into the Auror department, not a decent cup of coffee or cuppa tea to be had anywhere.
