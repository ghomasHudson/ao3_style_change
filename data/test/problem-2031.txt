Harry snorted. “‘Had to’ is subjective. Five years of friendship and you just threw it away. If I mattered that little to you as your best friend, why should I think I would matter more as your soulmate? You made your choice then, Malfoy, this is mine. We live separate lives, live in separate countries. We have different opinions about everything, and frankly, I don't really want to be around you.” Harry told him truthfully. A hard truth that Malfoy still hadn't understood all these years later: words were never going to be enough. “Even after you knew the truth, you still let your little gang bully and harass me. What kind of a soulmate are you? What kind of
Harry's smile, the one that usually reached his eyes when he saw Draco, died a slow death. Draco's words, Draco’s small speech of hatred, were inked on his body. He trembled, not knowing what exactly was happening, but knowing it was somehow a turning point for both of them. He didn't know if Draco had already received his words, they hadn't had the chance to speak in the last three days, so if he said anything now he could alert Dra...Malfoy to the fact that he was actually Harry's soul mate. His heart was torn, his mind in turmoil, and his body in shock.
“I don't need you. Sometimes I wonder if I even like you, but I want you. I want you making me angry at you, want you messing with my perfectly fine systems and re-arranging all my clothing to your liking even though your way makes my head hurt. I just want you. I choose you.”
Harry's words were a family joke. Beyond the humor of the words themselves, it always made the restless part of Harry's soul calm when he read the words. They were a promise, a threat to always follow, a path to happiness he hadn't been able to see before. They still made him roll his eyes and growl in aggravation, but they were a promise just as his words on Draco were a promise. Forever.
They would only learn of the outcome of the investigation some three months later when they were finished with their current case. Hermione and Viktor had owled him, as Lucius and Narcissa had owled Malfoy. It turned out that what Sirius had done was illegal. He had essentially made a magical vow to take care of Harry and had ignored that vow. He not only lost his job as Head Auror, but was also thrown into Azkaban for three years, not that it made much difference to Harry. He hadn't heard from Sirius since the summer he had spent four days with the man.
Three sets of eyes grew large and alarmed. He was a Gryffindor. Gryffindor’s were brash and bold, headstrong and had a temper that fizzled out eventually, but overall a forgiving lot. This wasn't a Gryffindor move. They had expected that an apology and explanation would be enough. Maybe a few gifts to show their remorse, but denying the use of his given name? It made them nervous. What had they allowed to happen?
“Potter's quidditch captain said he left a little past five-thirty but he couldn't be sure of the exact time because someone had thrown a bludger his way that he couldn't avoid. And before you ask, I interviewed several of his teammates and they all say the same thing. He left around five-thirty.” Darrow stated before Shacklebolt could ask.
Harry eyed him blankly before pulling up his shirt on the left side and moving until all three of them could read the words. Narcissa choked and rested a shaking hand on her throat. Lucius froze but otherwise did nothing. Malfoy paled. They all knew soul words were on your skin, all knew you spent years with those words until they changed to the words that mattered most to you. What they hadn't considered was that Harry had to read those words over and over and over again. Words of hurt, words of pain, words of torment.
. I asked you a long time ago whether or not you would ever open that door for Draco and you said never. Is that still how you feel?”
“I leave in two days.” Harry replied shortly. He watched Malfoy's face fall and couldn't care less. “Why did you even bother to come?” Curiosity killed the cat, after all.
“It is simply not done! You are my son's soulmate! Soulmates belong together!” Lucius sneered at him, as if he was a recalcitrant child who refused to do something just for the sake of it.
That summer was one of Harry's hardest. When Harry had first found out about his godfather and looked him up, he had sent the man an owl, hoping for a reply or at the very least an explanation as to why Harry wasn’t living with him. Why he had been dumped with the Dursley’s. The reply he had gotten was less than satisfactory. It seemed more like an automated response to fan mail than an actual reply. Harry didn’t even bother with the man he had hoped would help him after that.
It was on the train when he was cornered by Blaise and Theo, Daphne a shadow behind them, begging him for forgiveness and understanding. Telling him they had no idea he would go that far, that it wasn't the point.
(HJP) That's when we found the body. Draco nearly tripped over it and screamed bloody murder. He wanted to walk away. Said it wasn't our business and someone else would no doubt find the body. Never seen him so pale, and that's saying something. Although, he may have been a little green at the time, now that I think about it.
They were stunned to hear from him, laughed at his being perpetually cold, and sober when they heard he was falling in love with his soulmate.
(HJP) I managed to convince Draco to try out this new restaurant just down the street called 'The Garden'. Supposed to have fantastic Indian. Suppose I'll never know now.
In the end, he spent three years abroad, became a Wardmaster and Spellbinder, one of the best in the business. The first time in three years he would go back to England was for Hermione's wedding. They would have a traditional Bulgarian wedding the next week, but this week was a traditional English wedding. Harry had brought his boyfriend, Sam, as his date.
(HJP) He's always waiting for me outside, the prat loves to give me a pointed look and a five minute lecture on how 'being on time means coming to anything early so you're never late'.
It took a year of being in Malfoy's vicinity and unending chatter and poking and prodding before he broke. It had been a particularly hard day; they were in the Amazon looking for a lost relic on assignment for the goblins. Harry had broken through ward after ward, caught spells that could have killed, and was tired enough at the end of it all to miss one and had gotten hit by a cutting hex. Thankfully it was a low powered hex (nothing lasts long when time is involved) and he was patched up quickly. Unfortunately, his temper had risen to a peak and when Malfoy had begun talking again about their Hogwarts days and how sorry he was, Harry broke. He screamed at him, yelled at him, punched him in the face and then pulled him close to yell at him some more. He yelled about the Dursley's, about the beatings, about the lack of food, about the cupboard under the stairs, the padlocks on his cousin's second bedroom. He screamed about Sirius Black and his unending hatred for the one man who should have taken him in and loved him but cast him aside instead. He yelled about finally having a friendship with Draco that he could rely on, trust. He yelled about his heartbreak at reading those words, how they broke him just a little more, how hearing Draco of all people say them broke something he could never dream of fixing. Of how meaningless all those letters of apology were in the face of his whole life of abuse, loneliness, and heartache. Knowing that your soulmate despises you. Of having that pushed in your face, over and over and over again. Of almost being killed because he was supposed to love you!
“We're waiting on confirmation of the time of death first, Sir. Personally, after both interviews, I don't think either one of them did it. They don't have a motive, they have an alibi, and they stand firm in their belief that he was already dead. They seemed really confused that Pettigrew was even brought up, let alone Black. Malfoy thought the victim was a woman, for Merlin's sake.” Darrow replied as he rolled his eyes.
Harry looked around at his audience, Blaise, Daphne, Theo, Tracy, Hermione, Justin, Padma, almost all of his friends, watching him, watching Draco speak words that would cut even the strongest of men to their bones: that you were unwanted by your soulmate. And he was. Because, without anyone else knowing it, he knew the truth. So he simply looked at Draco, his eyes no longer smiling, his face no longer welcome, and nodded. Then he turned and walked away, Draco and his gang laughing at his retreat.
At first Harry and Hermione had chosen to take the year off and travel, but it soon became clear that what Hermione really wanted to do was travel to her Bulgarian soulmate. Harry had laughed at her blushing face, gave her a long hug, and sent her off. He took his time traveling, meeting a variety of witches and wizards, learning new and different kinds of magic, discovered lust and love. He grew, he learned, he hurt, and he laughed while having adventures he never dreamed of in a cupboard under the stairs. He never once thought of Malfoy.
“And you don't have to.” She told him gently. “If you don't want this, you tell him straight and then sort yourself out. You're not responsible for his happiness, just your own. If you can't be happy in a relationship with your soulmate, then get out. Just because they're perfect for you doesn't mean that you ever have to choose him over you.”
Tears were slowly falling down Malfoy's face, his eyes angled away. The two other Malfoy's seemed lost for words so Harry took the opportunity to get away from them. He met up with the Grangers and never looked back.
For the next two weeks, they hardly spoke, only simple questions related to work that usually had 'yes' or 'no' answers. Two weeks of trying to give a place to what he was feeling. If it was worth the effort to even try. He finally knew he needed help and asked Draco to disappear for a few hours. Draco watched him with suspicious eyes before taking a large breath and nodding, grabbing his things and walking out. Harry wasted no time and promptly grabbed some floo powder to speak to the only two people in the world who could help him sort himself out: Hermione and Viktor.
(HJP) Trying to prevent Draco from shagging me in public. The man wants what he wants, what can I say?
Harry and Draco had a rough start, that first meeting on the train would ruin everything for them until their first shared detention. They had somehow gotten lost in the Forbidden Forest and since Fang was no help (and a coward, he ran off at the first call of a night owl), they had to work together to find their way back to the castle. They had started out snipping at each other, growing more and more agitated until, somehow, they came out the forest laughing at jokes and pranks to play on their respective friends. It had started out slowly, both still too cautious about their new friendship to try anything overt, but it helped them grow closer. By the end of second year, Draco was Harry's best friend. By fifth year, Harry had spent a good majority of two summers with Draco and his family. He couldn't imagine ever not having Draco in his life. He was slowly accepted by the Slytherins, had made friends on his own merit with Blaise, Daphne, Tracey, and Theo. Had even managed to somewhat heal the rift in the houses that Voldemort had created during his reign of terror. And in one glorious moment it all fell down around him.
Harry wasn't sure when their relationship changed, but it happened so gradually and so slowly, he doubted he could ever really pinpoint it. Six months into their Alaska adventure Harry woke up and stared at the blond laying next to him. He had fallen in love. He had fallen in love with the broken and badly put together Draco Malfoy and he hated himself for it. This was the man who had tried to kill him, almost succeeded both times, and now he was falling in love with him? Perhaps it was fate that at the very moment he started to spiral, Draco opened his eyes. He saw Harry watching him and became solemn.
“I want a family. A large family, three, maybe four kids. Marriage. A home. Stability, love, trust, acceptance.” He told them.
(HJP) Yes. So it would make sense to celebrate our third one. The man had reservations. Obviously it was important. Who did you say you were again?
When Harry checked in with Hermione and Viktor (and little Sofia, wasn't that a surprise) and heard that the media storm had calmed, but wasn't over, he asked them what he should do: face it, or hide. They both told him to hide, just a little while longer. People were fickle and once it all died down, he could return to his normal life. So Harry took another job, this time actually taking Malfoy with him, for a hunt in Alaska. Neither of them were fond of the cold, as it turned out, and more often than not huddled together in one bed despite the roaring fire and the constant heating charms. Both of them swore to never choose anything this cold again.
(HJP) I think it was our three-month anniversary but I'm terrible with this sort of thing. Had a present with me just in case though. You won't believe how stroppy Draco can get if I forget. You'd think I murdered his mother. Sorry, bad joke. Plus, I really like his mother, so don't tell her I said that.
“Congratulations, Dragon, you win.” Watched with a perverse kind of pleasure when those grey eyes lost some of their colour, when a pale face turned white, then green, then white again. He coughed up blood and smiled as he died.
Malfoy's smile was less brittle when he said “Can't tell you all my secrets, Harry. There's got to be some sort of mystery left between us in our old age.”
Luna, Ron, Neville, Dean, Seamus, and most of his other friends came by in groups. All of them explaining how Malfoy had gotten off with a slap on the wrist, how the house rivalry was now at its highest. How Slytherin's had fallen from somewhat antagonistic to outright enemy. Harry never said a word.
It wasn't much of a sentiment, but it was enough of one to build on. They started slow, holding hands and going out on dates, working together on whatever job they happened to be on. Started to give each other pecks on the cheeks, which turned to a peck on the lips, which turned into soft kisses and long kisses. They stopped by Hermione and Viktor's place together, spent a few weeks meeting Sofia and getting yelled at by Hermione for sending an entire box of enchanted snowballs that formed a cute, cold, cuddly bear that broke apart again when you tried to hug it. Viktor loved it because it kept his hyper little two year old girl entertained (and exhausted), but it worried Hermione with how attached she was getting to the damnable things. Draco finally, and surprisingly, managed to calm her down by telling her that all toys broke eventually, and that this was just a lesson Sofia had to take with her in life. Hermione hummed at that and slowly nodded. Viktor and Harry had stared at him in wonder.
Sometimes he wondered why not, when he was filled with bruises, broken glasses, broken bones. He could say the worst of the worst, knowing that those would be the words on Malfoy's body. Have him stare at them for hours on end, knowing you were never good enough for the one person that was meant for you. Some days it was harder to not give in to the urge, but in the end he didn't want to give him the satisfaction of knowing. Knowledge was power, after all.
(HJP) Four-thirty. I managed to get home for a quick change and I got to the restaurant at five. Didn't you ask me this already?
Harry had to listen to Malfoy telling him how it had killed him to turn around and see that blinding smile, the smile he always wore just for him, drift into non-existence. As time went on, he just wanted a reaction. He admitted that the stair incident was an accident; he hadn't realized how close to the edge Harry had gotten. The second time was a desire to have Harry out of his life for good. Too many memories, too much guilt, too much pain, all wrapped up in one boy. When Harry had said his words to him...Malfoy twisted everything up just to make sure he could still be near Harry. Told them how their animosity had grown, how they had fought, how they found out they were soulmates, how the spell got out of control.
Harry and the Grangers left as soon as Harry was medically cleared, traveling around Europe for the rest of the summer. The last few weeks they spent in Bulgaria, Hermione meeting her soulmate, Viktor Krum. Despite being an international Quidditch player, he was still quite smart, Hermione told him one night at dinner. Harry laughed at her and her eyes lightened and her heart sang. It was the first time in almost two years he had laughed a proper laugh, a real laugh.
Harry was crying silently, but shook his head. “No, no I don't. I don't know if I can trust him again, Hermione. I don't know if I can put my trust in him after everything that happened between us, I don't know if I want to go down that road.”
(HJP) Not that I can think of. The woman who threw wine all over Draco, maybe. I think she wanted something from him. Far too interested in him, in my opinion.
“I know exactly what it means to have a Malfoy for a soulmate”. Harry told them softly, pushing the shirt up further to show them the scars on his body from the spell that Madam Pomfrey was still unable to heal fully.
“Pretty words.” He said, grabbing a butterbeer from a passing tray. “Those five years of friendship?” Malfoy nodded, a frown on his face. “Those were pretty words too. I know the truth now; I know who you really are. All pretty words and nice smiles but the minute I become an inconvenience, I'm suddenly on your hit list. That face, the Malfoy face, that was you. So no,” Harry said shaking his head, “I don't want to give the man who tried to murder me another chance to do it again. The only reason you regret your actions in any way is because I’m your soulmate. If I still happened to be your ex-best friend you wouldn’t have even come today. Leave. Don't come back. Find something pretty to play with and be glad for it. If the gods are on my side, I'll never have to see you again.” Harry told him, harsh words to make Malfoy understand exactly what he had done. And for Harry, it was the truth. Even if Malfoy hadn't turned out to be his soulmate, his transformation from Draco to Malfoy was something Harry could and would never forgive. He had lost a piece of himself inside Draco that he had never gotten back and even now, years later, it still burned. He turned and walked away, leaving Malfoy broken and alone.
Draco woke up slowly, first becoming aware of the clean linen smell of the pillow his face was smushed into, then the sound of the shower running, finally the scratchy feeling in his eyes and the pounding of his head. It had been a good night; his worries had been for nothing and seeing Harry again for the first time in months had been a balm for his tired soul.
The sun was just beginning to rise in New York city, the warm light filtering through the windows of the high-ceilinged Perry Street apartment. The property boasted exposed brickwork, risqué artwork, and the eclectic furniture you would expect from a thirty something designer living in the big apple.
The diners that had been drinking at Ginny’s party last night sat quietly shovelling food into their mouths, wincing away from the boisterous children at the table. Ron’s wife Lavender, who was often described as “bubbly”, did not let her overindulgence the night before hinder her from enthusiastically regaling the group with tales of shocking celebrity gossip she was reporting in Witch Weekly. Many of the guests were cringing at her shrill tone as well as the content of her conversation, so Harry wasn’t surprised when one of them cracked. He was surprised however, that it was James who snapped first.
Ginny took the hint and loosened her hold on him, surveying him at arms length. “Gorgeous as ever I see,” she winked and released him. “Can I entice you with a blushing bride?” Ginny laughed at the alarmed look on his face before continuing, “It’s a cocktail silly, we’re testing them for the welcome drinks” she wiggled her eyebrows up and down.
“Oh Draco, I doubt we will make it awkward. I showed Pots your Vogue shoot last week and he practically came in his pants.” Pansy cackled.
“Yes, it will, and I won’t hesitate to hex the bollocks off anyone who causes trouble.” Pansy casually re-applied her lippy, an expert at keeping a steady hand as the cab swerved through the London traffic. “I thought you’d want to stay with Harry this time? I have to get my Draco news off him nowadays, you fucker.”
A whole host of red heads helped to set up the table outside, bringing out dishes of roast chicken, potato salad, accompanying side dishes and various accoutrement until it was practically bowing under the weight of food. If anything, Molly’s tendency towards over-feeding had only increased as the family grew. Draco graciously kissed Molly on either cheek, shook Arthur’s hand and gifted them with the basket of American confectionary they had become partial to over the years. He took his seat next to Harry and called out greetings to his dinner companions.
James let out a bitter sigh, closing his eyes as he started to talk quietly. “It’s the stupid articles dad. All the photos of you. All the stupid girls at school are obsessed with you. I finally asked Carella Albero out and all she wanted to talk about was you. They all fancy you. I’m so fucking sick of it dad. I know it’s not your fault but Aunty Lav doesn’t help, putting pictures of you in girly mags. I can’t forgive her for last year either…I don’t think I ever will.” Harry didn’t interrupt the boy, waiting quietly to see if he would elaborate on that last statement. James had got into an awful lot of trouble in the last year but had never given any indication that his aunt had influenced him in that. He had a feeling that his own reluctant celebrity wasn’t really the issue here.
The group seemed to struggle with swearing more than pointing, making the most of the absence of their children. The sickles had begun to stack up in front of Harry, and more than a few glasses of Pimms or wine had been sunk for right handed drinking. The wait staff brought the food out, with the usual kerfuffle of remembering who had ordered what, giving Pansy the perfect opportunity to exclaim, “Mine’s the spaghetti bollocknaise!” She earned her sickle back, but the laughter it caused in several of the more inebriated guests resulted in penalty shots being given out.
Harry waited until the waitress retreated until he held his hands up, bowed his head and exclaimed, “And that, ladies and gentlemen, is how it’s done.” The table laughed and applauded him as he took the sickle off the table, flicked it into the air and caught it before putting it in his pocket.
“Fine, I’ll fuck off home. I’m not apologising to that dumb cow. Sorry nan.” James stalked off moodily.
“Who has the takings from last time?” enquired Neville, prompting Hermione to delve into her handbag for an envelope of muggle notes.
Harry took the glass off him, putting them both on the sideboard before pulling Draco into a hug, breathing in his delicious scent. Draco held on for a few sweet moments before pulling back to look Harry in the eye. “You are truly the bravest man I have ever known, and not only for the things you’re famous for.”
Hearing the door go, Harry sighed back against his pillow, able to properly relax knowing his son was in for the night. It was only eight o’ clock and still light, so Harry half heartedly attempted to read some of the book Hermione had given him for his birthday. It was a light-hearted muggle tale about a hundred year old man who climbed out the window of his nursing home to go on an adventure, and Harry found himself chuckling along, briefly lost in the story. When his phone buzzed, he looked up to realise it was getting darker, so he drew the curtains and put the bedside lamp on. Harry checked his phone and saw something that never failed to make his stomach lurch: a text from Draco.
Seventh year was...interesting. The houses were still divided, Slytherin's name still in the mud, but Malfoy had stopped bullying him. That wasn't to say Parkinson, Goyle, and Crabbe had stopped, just that Malfoy didn't join them. In fact, the times that Harry did see Malfoy, the boy looked terrible. There were dark circles under his eyes, his clothing slightly off, and his hair was a tousled mess. Throughout the year Malfoy would try his best to get near Harry, try to talk to him, try to explain, but Harry was never in his presence for longer than thirty seconds before a non-Slytherin found them and took Harry away. It also helped that he had the marauders map and he could avoid him most of the time. Malfoy had drawn a line in the sand and the school had formed battle lines across from him.
Darrow snorted. “Hard to be bothered about the bloke dying when you've never met him before. We double-checked though, Sir. Everyone agrees he had no emotional connection to either man. As far as we can tell, he never met and he never sought Black out after his escape. There's no reason for him to want revenge for his death.”
“Who would ever want you for their soulmate?” Draco sneered at Harry, and Harry's heart stopped. “I think I would have to kill myself if I ever found out I was the soulmate of a freak.”
“I'd be inclined to believe that if Potter wasn't the only person with any direct relationship to the victim.” Shacklebolt stated, giving Herring a cold stare and ignoring his comment.
“I needed to see you.” While his clothing looked the part of the Malfoy name, his voice was scratchy from disuse, the dark circles he remembered from their final year at Hogwarts had turned purple, his eyes had lost their shine, and his hair was unwashed and greasy looking. His only saving grace was that he had tied it up, but Harry could see the signs. Malfoy looked him over, drinking in the sight in front of him. Harry let him, the faster this ordeal would be over with.
(HJP) Are you asking me if I routinely have Draco discover dead bodies by tripping over them? Because let me tell you, once was more than enough. I won't be enjoying the nightmares, thanks.
Malfoy grit his teeth, then sighed. “Probably not, no. It doesn't put me in a better light, but it does explain why I had to.”
Their lives would never have the easiness that Hermione had with Viktor, too much had happened for that. Harry never forgot that he didn't owe Draco anything, but he also never forgot that he loved the blond git. Draco never forgot the pain and anguish he had caused Harry, and never forgot that he gave Harry his biggest joy: A family. Severus, being his godfather, had given him a potion he was experimenting with. Within three days of taking it, Draco was pregnant. Harry had fainted upon hearing that, making their children and loved ones laugh years later in the re-telling. They had five children in total: Three boys and two girls.
(HJP) No, we went to get some drinks at the bar across the street. We were both still hungry and I convinced him to calm down before we chose somewhere else to eat. Frankly I'm surprised he even listened to me since he's normally intent on ignoring everything I ever say to him. It's bloody frustrating.
By the time sixth year started, Harry had grown back the shields he had lost when he had made friends with Malfoy. The weeks passed slowly and Malfoy became his number one tormentor, Crabbe, Goyle, and Parkinson not far behind him.
Shacklebolt sighed heavily. “Alright, keep looking but don't rule them out. Pull them back in for an interview in a few days and see if their stories change or if they remember something new. They may not have killed Pettigrew but they could still be involved. I don't like the fact that it was Potter that found him either. Maybe someone wanted him to find the body. Let's try every angle and make sure to double-check everything. This is high profile and I want to make sure we come out of this mess without looking completely incompetent, even if that includes arresting The-Boy-Who-Lived. Pettigrew may have been a traitor and murderer, but we still need to find his killer whether we like it or not. And someone call the Minister down here so we can get Black posthumously exonerated. Fucking nightmare.”
While he waited for Draco to come back, he used the time to straighten out his thoughts and when he finally heard Draco open their tent, he had sorted out his chaotic mind. He let Draco get settled across from him in their chairs by the fire, let the heat of the fire warm him before turning to look at him.
He vaguely heard the bathroom door being blasted open, someone screaming for a professor to help. He stared into grey eyes and finally uttered his words.
(HJP) No, can't say I know who did either. The street was pretty empty so I have to assume it was one of the people who worked at the pub.
He frowned at that. “I...I don't know. Yes, I suppose. If I let him in, if I choose to trust him again.”
Hermione came as often as she could, hardly ever saying anything and simply curling up with him in his bed, holding each other close. It was the first time he cried, the first time he confessed he wished he hadn't woken up, the first time he broke down. Eventually they had to give him a calming draught, but Hermione never left him that night.
Harry turned and walked away, leaving three Slytherins feeling like they had lost something important, vital, but having no idea what it was.
“Useless, both of them. Malfoy showed up at six, had one drink before Potter showed up at six-ten. Potter accidentally bumped into a woman who tipped her glass over Malfoy's foot. A drop or two fell on his shoe and Malfoy had a polite conversation with her and told her it was no problem before they both sat down for dinner. A couple two tables over were having an argument and a fight broke out. The woman of the arguing couple accidentally hexed the waiter who dropped some soup on Malfoy's lap. They both hexed and cursed the couple in question before they were thanked for their quick reactions and if they came another night they would get a free meal as a thank you. They went to the bar across the street for a pint and a snack before leaving again.” Herring listed off, looking over his notes to make sure he got everything right.
When they came back, they were met with a pile of letters, most from Malfoy and two from his parents. Frowning, he threw out all of Malfoy's but opened the ones his parents sent him. Almost immediately he snorted at the one Mr. Malfoy had written and didn't bother finishing the letter before handing it over to Hermione. Mrs. Malfoy's letter was about the same as her husbands, just in softer tones and more subtle manipulations. ‘Draco made a mistake, he had no idea you were his soulmate, put the past behind you and do the right thing, for both your sakes.’
“It took me three months to find you.” He chuckled, leaning against the doorway and watching Harry narrow his eyes at him, still trying to get the stuff off of him. “I can't imagine what you would look like if I left you alone any longer.” His smile was brittle and his eyes were hurt, but there was an understanding there that hadn't been there before. It made Harry roll his eyes instead of telling him to go back to where ever he came from and leave him the hell alone. Draco swished him wand and the muck disappeared.
“Like I said, you've made your point very clear. Malfoy drew his line in the sand. Now it's my turn. Try your best to never speak to me again, and under no circumstances seek me out.”
“We had a witness come forward early this morning stating she heard a scuffle in the alley at around five that evening. She thought she heard a man grunting but a cat came ambling out and she thought nothing more of it until the papers this morning.” Darrow stated as he grabbed the transcript of the interview in question and handed it to his superior.
Herring grunted and waited before he was out of sight. “This whole case is a bloody joke.” He stated darkly. “Who would want to kill a man who was already believed to be dead? And who's going to admit to the fact that they knew he was alive knowing they'd become our number one suspect? We’re going to get fired over this, I just know it.”
“Sir, by all accounts Potter didn't even know of Pettigrew until Black escaped from Azkaban during his third year. We interviewed several old school mates and they all verified that he seemed particularly unbothered by the escape. It turned out he didn't even know they existed. He also wasn't devastated by the news that Black had been murdered in his fifth year. He also didn't show any understanding as to why he was being brought up.”
Somewhere in the eight months they had been gone, the fervor had died down and the attention shifted off them. Harry had learned that Draco had gotten a lot of abuse thrown his way for his part in Harry's mistreatment. The Malfoy name had fallen from its high perch, but not too far since they all believed soulmates were destined. That didn't mean they weren't being punished. Narcissa was out of favor, no luncheons, no benefits, a real social outcast in the circles that mattered. Lucius had several deals fall apart and his company took a massive hit on the market before he began to pull back from public view. They had sent letters to Draco to pass on to Harry, once again telling him of their regrets and sorrow. He still felt like it was a ploy so he burned them as Malfoy watched. Neither mentioned the letters again.
It took Harry and Ginny another couple months to settle into their new routine as a long distance couple (Ginny always stayed over on weekends but had to remain with the team for the rest of the week, due to the intense training regimen).
Narcissa beamed at her only son, tears in her eyes. "Oh, my dragon, after everything you have been through... I want you to be able to go where you want, and do what you choose. Without the taint of the Malfoy name, I will regain honor and respect as a Black once more, and you..." She looked him in the eye before asking him, "what do you want?"
The ritual itself was quite simple enough to plan for, and the delay was more a matter of conflicting schedules than actual need for preparation. For Draco, those few days before the act had burned him inside with a sort of mixture between shame, guilt, and elation. It was pretty straightforward, at least for such an ancient and theoretically complicated bit of magic.
"Yes, I would," she said, laughing at his reaction. "And relax, Harry, that won't be in a few more years, so we'll have time to iron out the details then."
Draco couldn't help but shake his head in disbelief. "I can't imagine what you said that could have convinced her to change such a well-established routine," he said, eyeing his mother with some trepidation. "I'm guessing I don't have much of a choice, either?"
"Coffee. Now." Draco stood imperiously and began walking away. He paused to look over his shoulder to see the brunet looking at him incredulously. "What are you waiting for? Quickly now, chop chop!"
At that moment, he glanced his reflection in the window and realized that he had an almost comically manic grin on his face. If the writers at the Daily Prophet could have seen it, he was sure there would be an immediate wave of new headlines speculating his sanity. The Boy-Who-Went-Mental, perhaps? Or Gryffindor Goes Gaga? Maybe they could get Malfoy to give them a few of his creative titles. At this, Harry laughed heartily at himself. He was in such a good mood that even thinking of Malfoy couldn't dampen it.
Ron pursed his lips, probably trying to think of the right thing to say. He was in a difficult position, Harry realized, stuck between his best mate and his sister.
Ginny rolled her eyes in amusement at Harry's inarticulate state. "He means, we've been using the contraceptive charm very religiously over the past year, particularly after having Jamie," she added guiltily.
He made a move towards his suite, but his mother had a firm grasp on his arm, and commandeered him against his will into the sitting room. He almost sputtered when he saw who was there. Immediately, his Malfoy Mask slid into place, and he at once transformed into the well-bred heir who needed to impress everyone who mattered.
Draco remembered that day at the Minister's Office, when he had been given his probationary release. Potter hadn't been yet under the
Draco laughed, which made Harry smile again for some reason. "Mother is used to conducting her social life within the Manor," the blond explained. "It wasn't too much of a change for her. The Fidelius has only helped to boost her confidence that any actual danger apart from life-threatening cards will be kept out."
"I just want you to be happy, Draco," Narcissa said sincerely. "Truly happy. For that to happen, you need your wife, your son, and your friends. I've made the mistake of telling you to only focus on family, but it is evidently clear that being away from your new friends is detrimental. You are a wonderful husband, and an exceptional father. But I do not think that is enough."
"Is everything alright?" he asked, concern etched on his face. She couldn't seem to look him in the eye, focusing instead on the window so her back was turned to Harry.
Harry had to admit that breakfast wasn't nearly as awkward as he had expected it to be. Granted, it was only him and Malfoy dining together, so he felt no need to put up an impression as he would have had to with the other two Malfoys.
"Oh, darling, I thought something had happened to you!" He pulled her away, hands still clutching her arms, so that they were facing each other. "Tell me, is everything alright? Are you feeling alright?"
He missed the rooftop of his flat, but he didn't think he had the courage to go back there just yet.
"I don't want my family to know. As head of the Malfoys, I do hold the privilege of authorizing such things discreetly." He turned pleadingly to Ron. "Please? Will you do it?"
Molly inadvertently let out a small sob, which didn't help Harry at all. He turned to Arthur, hoping that the man could be relied on under pressure.
"See here, Malfoy," he said with a menacing undertone, "we've already established fact from fiction, right? All of this," he gestured arbitrarily around him, "was a perfectly executed heist. Everything went according to plan! Well…except for the brat, that wasn't according to the plan, was it, darling?"
"There you are, dear!" Narcissa exclaimed with relief as Draco stepped out of the fireplace. He walked over to where she was sitting and bent down to give her a perfunctory kiss on the cheek. She gave him such a lovely smile that he couldn't help but return it.
: Well, I know she's all famous and stuff now, travelling around the world and giving out autographs and meeting fans, making a mark on those Quidditch records. But at the end of the day, it's just her and boring old me,
It took most of the day, but Draco had finally resolved his inner conflict by deciding to pretend as if he hadn't just made the biggest discovery of all time. It wasn't as if he had sufficient evidence to fuel his suspicions, but his acute level of perception (developed by his father, of course) had never failed him. He had thought it over again and again in his head, using both inductive and deductive reasoning, and he was quite confident that Potter was definitely hiding something big, and that the most possible probability was that he had at least one child, and was keeping it completely secret.
"Sorry, it's just... I don't know, it feels odd having so much down time after the Pince case. We were all on tenterhooks for months, and now, it's back to parchment work. I'm even lucky because I at least get to do it from home with you and James near me. I imagine Ron's having a slow week at the office."
When Draco had agreed half-heartedly, said goodbye and cut the call, Harry turned immediately to Ron. "So, are we really making any progress on Howe?"
He didn't bother doing anything other than to collapse on their bed. He stared up at the canopy of the four-poster and let his thoughts wander.
He took a quick look around his office and spotted the day's edition of the Daily Prophet on one corner of his cluttered desk. With a shaking hand, he turned it over and was shocked to see Ginny on the front cover. She looked stressed and harassed, and the animated photo looped again and again, on her walking by and hurrying away from the camera.
"Nah," Ron said. "Just another useless process where you and Malfoy just sign off to verify, yet again, that you both were voluntary witnesses. It's stupid, but some dingy office probably needs these for no real reason but to make our lives more complicated."
If anyone had told his Hogwarts self that he would ever willingly subject himself to extended periods of exposure to the Golden Trio, Draco would have sent them a hex or three. Maybe up the arse, for good measure.
Pansy hadn't been kidding about the mood swings and cravings. Just the last week, Astoria had Draco running all over the place to get her what she wanted, and he happily obliged. He had grown up watching his father treat his mother like a queen, and now he knew what it felt like. He wanted to shower her with his affection, wanted to make sure she got everything that she every needed. He supposed part of it was his own excitement at becoming a father, and he made sure to show her everyday how much it meant to him. Their alliance had still gone strong, even after three years, and he felt that their relationship was definitely a step up from the usual Pureblood marriages. Now that they were going to have an heir of their own, well, he felt like he had everything he had ever wanted, and so focused on making sure that his wife had hers, too. It was a small price to pay.
Draco nodded. "It becomes extremely dangerous for childbirth, because the mother's magic is supporting two individuals. The slightest fluctuation would have caused irreparable damage at the very least. Potter was wise to point it out, even though he probably didn't realize the severity, either."
It wasn't something thrown lightly, and Draco felt breathless that this was being offered to him so freely and willingly by his former nemesis.
Astoria gave a small sniffle, but remained taciturn, still shaking while hugging herself. Draco moved to sit next to her, and took one of her hands for comfort.
"Yes," Draco replied. "It's a system not widely used in the last century, and I only managed to work it out because our library happened to have original manuscripts written in the same style. It wasn't common though, not even in northern Europe, which means the guys you want have some sort of direct link to that part of the world, possibly someone with a direct inheritance of family history there."
Potter - Harry, that is - was now looking at him with an unreadable expression on his face. Draco felt as if he were under scrutiny, and he resisted the strong urge to preen himself. Instead, he went on to drink his tea, feeling slightly more relaxed as he felt the potion unravel the building pressure behind in his head. It took a couple more minutes, but when he felt the last vestiges of pain disappear, he gave out a sigh of relief and allowed his body to lean back into his armchair.
With a pang, Harry realized that this would be the closest he would have to having a brother. "That's right, Ted," he said, his voice a little tight. "You're gonna be the best big brother! We'll have so much fun tomorrow. Sleep tight!" He kissed him on the forehead, then left the room, casting the usual monitoring and protecting wards on the door.
He was taken back from his swirling thoughts by a stinging slap to his cheek. The force of it made his head snap to one side, but his shock was more from surprise than pain.
"Not a bad idea, that. Hmm, look at Hodges' map. Interesting. Was expecting a completely different layout…"
After using a few household cleansing and refreshing charms around the house, and ordering a decent lunch from Kreacher (who was perhaps the only one possibly more excited than Teddy at the prospect of preparing large meals again), he found himself in front of the fire waiting patiently.
Something caught in his throat, and he was afraid that if he opened his mouth to speak, he would break down right in front of her. Nothing more embarrassing than a Malfoy revealing his innermost self-doubts about parenthood to a Muggleborn.
The girl at the till recognized him, despite his being absent for the last half year. She immediately flicked her wand, casting what Draco already knew to be a special Summoning Charm. Within seconds, a small mountain of books had assembled themselves on the nearest table for Draco's perusal. The service never failed to impress him, and he gave her a quick nod before burying his nose in the topmost tome.
"No, you're absolutely right," Harry agreed. It was then that he noticed their empty cups. He checked the clock on top of the fridge.
most certainly gives me enough incentive to never do this again," Draco retorted with a signature smirk.
She walked into the room, still with a slight flush tinting her freckled cheeks. She dropped her Quidditch bag onto one of the chairs and sidled up to where Harry was seated, hugging him gently from behind. "Hi."
"Well, I wouldn't want to disappoint my family by being a terrible host." Draco motioned towards where Astoria lay and indicated the baby in her arms. "Everyone, I am proud to present my first born son, Scorpius."
"I understand your career plans, the importance you put in ambition," he said. After all, Astoria and I had gone against tradition by pursuing our own interests and not merely living from our inheritance. Even after giving birth, my wife plans on going about her so-called diplomatic missions here and abroad, because it's who she is," Draco shrugged. "In any case, I'm glad you've ironed it out with Weasley. It must have been difficult, having such opposing ideals. But at least he understands your goals, and now you understand that wizards, Pureblood or no, place great value in children, even if the conception was, shall we say, accidental. No matter the circumstance, every magical child is celebrated."
He turned around at the sound of his wife's voice. "It's hardly a crime," he countered, though somewhat sheepishly. "And besides, I'm completely under his thrall now."
Baking a cake with a non-domestic Potions Master and a hyperactive eight year old Metamorphmagus was not how Harry had imagined at all. For one thing, the birthday cake itself, an ambitious and fancy-looking Black Forest confection, actually looked
The elf had said the call was business related, so he adopted a casual yet polite manner once he settled in front of the flames.
Molly, whom Harry suspected was trying to compensate for the failed relationship between him and Ginny, was helping her only daughter to deal with her unplanned motherhood for the few days a week that they had James and Albus. Ginny could have stayed the whole time at Grimmauld Place, but she insisted on staying with Molly and Arthur when she had the kids, in an attempt to 'give Harry some space'. They then shared the weekends, back at Number Twelve again, unless either of them were called to work on short notice, or the occasional big Weasley Sunday lunch was arranged.
"So why is it just the two of you this weekend?" Draco asked while sipping his tea. He and Harry had finally gotten Teddy to bed after an interesting session of story time - Draco would
Hermione had understood his plight, since she herself wanted a career in legislation that she could attribute to her own intellect and perseverance, not her popularity from involvement in the war. In fact, she had flat out refused and entered the Department of Magical Law Enforcement on her own.
Harry studied Malfoy's apparition. His Auror's skills were honed to perfection, and his brain had automatically begun cataloguing whether or not Malfoy had any malicious intent or ulterior motive. Unfortunately, the Gryffindor in him also reacted to the perceived helplessness and desperation. With a sigh, he laid his book down and tilted his head in inquiry.
"It's affecting a whole lot of people though," Ginevra volunteered. "I mean, I bet it's causing loads of hard feelings in all departments that have come in contact with the Aurors. It's like the Ministry itself sees you all as possible criminals in need of surveillance. That doesn't say much for the officials if they don't even have trust in their own law enforcement body."
"What was in the memories?" he asked Potter. He fixed him with his trademark stare. "Why didn't you want to tell me?"
"I hate to say it, but what Malfoy said makes a hell of a lot of sense, considering everything that's happened. Based on the rumors so far, I mean."
Her eyes fluttered a bit, as if she were responding to his voice. After a few more moments, Astoria sat bolt upright, only to be held by Draco firmly in his arms.
"And that's a bad thing?" Draco demanded. Wasn't it only recently that his mother had been nagging him about Astoria? And now that he had realized his shortcomings, she was saying the opposite?
"Yeah, yeah, I made you guys some. I have a lot of free time at home, anyway," he said, shrugging his shoulders. "How're you feeling lately, Hermione?"
The woody area behind the Burrow was a perfect place to play a Seeker's Game. After an hour of flying high and low, and showing off to each other with dives and feints, Harry and Ginny had finally landed in a grassy clearing and laid out their shrunken picnic. Ginny clutched the Snitch possessively, proud of having won it from Harry. As if reading her mind, Harry pouted.
Gerard grinned - lopsided, almost sneering. "Do not fret," he said calmly to her, wand twitching in his hand. "I
As he said his goodbyes and reassurances to the sobbing brunette and eventually closed his Floo, Draco's mind was filled with a mix of emotions. There was a bit of trepidation, some anxiety and a handful of relief, and even a sense of responsibility at being depended upon. And a hint of happiness as well. A sense of urgency. It appeared that he couldn't wait until he could finally show Potter that he could be a good friend, too.
Harry suddenly felt as if his insides had been cleanly cut out from him - just empty and hollow. And that was not what he expected feeling upon hearing that he was to have another child. This was not the way a happy couple was meant to react to the news that they were expecting. Perhaps that was a pretty clear sign that something was definitely wrong here.
Astoria merely nodded absentmindedly, and Draco knew that her attention had already transferred to elsewhere.
The brunet seemed to blush, but the green flames made it hard to be sure. "Er, you can say this is more of a personal call," he replied. "I just... thought..."
When she had gone, the tension in the room became even more palpable, and Harry felt trapped. He knew Malfoy couldn't sense James, but he had no idea to explain Andromeda's emergency visit, or why he had to ask him to leave now so he could tend to his son in private.
"Are you sure?" she asked, still unable to process so many major changes in her life in such a short time. "
"Wow, Harry," Ginny said, shaking her head. "Pop out our kid, that's a lovely euphemism. So romantic of you."
Draco could practically feel the waves of anxiety radiating from his mother. He shook his head in response, trying not to disturb the boy still clutched to his chest. "As many enemies as we used to have after the war, most if not all have been locked away in Azkaban, and the rest have followed suit with the wizarding public and accepted us with the respect we have rightfully earned when we rehabilitated the Malfoy name." He turned to his wife in question.
The boy pouted, but obediently did as Harry said, after saying goodbye to his grandmother. When he disappeared into one of the doors in the hall, Andromeda bade goodbye to Harry, obviously in a rush to leave. She even gave a hesitant tod towards Draco, who respectfully bade her goodbye as well.
"Yes!" Draco said, excitement shining in his eyes. "I've only started, Potter, and I've already figured out two possible leads for you to work on! It's based on- why are you holding your arms out like that?" he asked suddenly. He couldn't help it, it was a distracting sight. He was surprised that Potter seemed to become even tenser at his words.
Ron's question hung in the air while Harry bit into a sandwich and chewed. Unable to swallow fast enough, Harry resorted to nodding his head while busy with his BLT. When he finally gulped down his mouthful, he cleared his throat before standing up to join Ron on the larger conference table in the corner of their office.
Ginny choked on her pumpkin juice. She blinked out tears of laughter while she thought it over in her head. "Harry Potter, BAMF. I like that."
Of course, present-day Draco was living almost the extreme opposite of the life he had once thought he would live. Here he was, in the bloody Burrow of all places, having a nice chat with Hermione - she had insisted some time ago that he use her given name, with the silent threat of 'or else'. She was undergoing some stress having to stay home after having her second child, and had invited Draco over since Astoria was visiting a few of her socialite friends. Draco couldn't even imagine what his childhood self would do if he had been told that he would be sharing a nice cup of tea with a Mudblood and actually be looking forward to doing it again. Ah, how laughable Fate was sometimes. And in such a short period of time, at that.
"And it has!" Draco insisted. "You were right all along, Mother! I was neglecting my duties as her husband, which should never have fallen behind my being a father to Scorp."
"As if you need to remind me again, thanks," she replied coldly. "Yes, Harry, I am quite aware, and it doesn't make me feel too good about myself. But I also have a life, and this is just another responsibility that I have. You've got your job, and I've got mine!"
Or at least Draco had said so earlier when their conversation turned once again to their biggest problem.
Draco looked down at the book in his hand. They hadn't even exchanged names. How rude of him not to have asked in the first place! As he shrank his new purchases and slipped them into his pocket, he met the eyes of the girl at the till, who for some reason saw an unspoken question in his gaze.
Weasley shook his head in apparent annoyance. "Yeah, apparently to keep a record of ability to do our job. Load of rubbish. It even includes any others pulled in for the recent year's special cases. It's given everyone in the Auror Corps a headache. Who wants to have to go in and get their mind investigated? I mean, sure it's a short cut version of Harry's full mind mapping process for real criminal investigations, but seriously. Do they expect us all to be happy that we're being spied on?"
This included his usual visits with his friends, old and new, as well as dropping by to see his Aunt Andromeda and his cousin Teddy.
When Weasley and Potter had finally traced the brothers to a highly warded manor, it all fell like clockwork, and Draco had to admit that he was impressed upon hearing that Potter had singlehandedly dueled both brothers, and rendered them both unconscious. After they were apprehended, Draco himself was called under strict confidence into the Ministry to bear witness to the final interrogation.
The shock on Harry's face took five seconds to synchronize with the shock on his brain. When it did, he shook his head. He hadn't expected her to make this grand gesture so suddenly, after all the arguments they had had over the years. "You'll stay more often?" he asked tentatively.
"I have decided as well," she continued, much more quietly this time. Draco remained silent, knowing she would explain anyway. "I hope this does not come as a surprise to you, or even a shock. I hope that you will be able to understand my own choices."
Earlier last year, Andromeda had sat with her long-estranged sister and nephew, and encouraged them to foster their familial connection to Teddy. At that time, Astoria had still been expecting Scorpius, and Draco had informed his aunt that he had no experience in handling children of Teddy's age. Having heard Harry's stories had given him a rough idea of what it meant to have one's hands full of noisy, messy Metamorphmagus.
"Well, we know that it's really difficult to work on so much conjecture" Potter added, "and it's asking a lot from you. None of our resident potion experts were able to crack it. You're at the top of the list of Potions Masters in the entire continent now, and if you can't solve it, I don't think anyone else can."
"Lady Greengrass," he bowed low, taking the matron's delicate hand and kissing the air above it. "Daphne," he added, this time bowing towards the woman's daughter. She gave him an impassive look, merely nodding an acknowledgment. Lady Greengrass gave her daughter the evil eye.
Hermione had just gone to the bar to get them a few drinks, so Harry took that moment to interrogate Ron about his proposal, which he had been planning. The redhead, of course, turned red.
"We'll get 'em, Ron," he assured his best friend. "In the meantime, let's hope that Malfoy clears up the rest of the list and finds out what they're for." He didn't say all of his thoughts out loud. How else would Ron have reacted if Harry admitted that he was looking forward to hearing from Malfoy? The man always had new information for the case, and Harry couldn't help but share his enthusiasm at getting to the bottom of the murder case. For the first time, Harry realized that he and Malfoy might have much more in common than just Quidditch and the war. What unnerved him more was his urge to find out.
Malfoy nodded in understanding. He knew that Weasley took his job seriously, especially now that Hermione had been ordered by the Healers to stay at home. Draco wondered if her earlier flash of anxiety had anything to do with that.
: Er... I'm hoping this qualifies within your privacy allocation, but our readers wish to ask more about your relationship to Ms. Weasley.
"No worries, your dad would probably kill me, too, so at least we'd still be proper mates in the afterlife, probably have a nice conversation while waiting for the train to come."
"Breathe, Malfoy," Macmillan sniggered. "It's the best precautions we've come up with, and suffice to say, it's really the only thing stronger than Malfoy wards. And Harry's told us how the suspect might get through even those."
He had been taking care of a follow-up case in his study that time, so he was sufficiently distracted from Ginny and James. Despite the Eilert case being closed, there were several more related cases that needed to be looked into. While this wasn't the responsibility of the MMI, Auror Stone of the DMLE had personally asked Harry's department to help them create mind maps for the victims of the Eilert operation. Since the now-illegal trade and distribution of Persephone's Poison was reported to the public, previously unsolved cases were now cropping up. The most common report involved some witch or wizard who made official reports to the Aurors that a friend or relative might have been a victim of the Eilert potion. Since more than two thirds of these complaints were proven to be people who merely couldn't get over someone getting married to a person they didn't approve, the Aurors needed updated profiles from Harry's team so that they could instantly distinguish whether the accused persons fit the mind map of a victim under Persephone's Poison.
Harry nodded. He hadn't felt this restless in a long time, and he wanted to spring into action. However, he also knew that going Gryffindor was not the best tactic in his line of work - he had to be more Slytherin in order to outwit the wizards he was hunting. "Send that new information over to Macmillan's team," he instructed Ron. "I want them to narrow down the traders who still personally procure the stuff they sell. They'll probably be the specialty apothecaries, the more expensive ones." Malfoy had told him last week that he suspected this was a high-class potion, and that the makers would want only the best organic, hand-picked ingredients.
Draco was taken aback. "What do you mean, this early?" he asked. Twenty-six for wizards was a typical age to have two or even three children.
He stepped out of the lift and into the hall that led to the Minister's Office. While walking towards the double doors at the end of the hall, flanked by two uniformed guards, Draco thought about how the Solum Sanctuarii must have changed Potter's life. He wouldn't have all the attention, first of all.
He looked into Potter's eyes as if to find some sort of confirmation, and found it in the way that Potter wouldn't meet his gaze.
"We?! Who-" Before Draco could finish his outraged question, in stumbled the rest of the Golden Trio, looking slightly embarrassed.
Harry and Ginny had taken Healer Rosewood's precautions seriously, but both of them were still quite shocked when Ginny had to be rushed immediately to St. Mungo's just shy of seven months into her pregnancy, face scrunched in pain and hand grasping painfully at Harry's arm. The sudden burst of adrenaline did absolutely nothing for Harry's nerves when she was levitated into one of the warded rooms, so he sat outside, trying and failing to pretend that he was in control of himself. Because he pretty much wasn't.
New chapter! :) Real life got in the way a bit, but I couldn't not write haha. Thanks for the comments, I appreciate it when someone takes the time to read and THEN leave a comment :)
"You are radiating pure joy, dear," his mother finally stated airily. "Trust me to know that I have not witnessed such an expression on your handsome face in quite a while, and it gave me quite a shock."
Malfoy never judged him. He kept his tongue sharp and his wits even sharper, but Harry could now appreciate that it all was part and parcel of his entire personality. And it was entertaining anyway. If he had spent this time with Ron or Hermione, they would have smothered him to an early death with all the coddling and over-involvement. His words would always be taken literally, or taken too seriously. Ron understood dark humor sometimes, but Hermione had always insisted that her husband was 'enabling' Harry's self-deprecating moods, and therefore not helping. In contrast, Harry could rely on Malfoy's bittersweet perspective on their life as war survivors from opposite ends of the battle. He could depend on him to call him out of his dark moods without sounding like a nagging, coddling mother hen.
"That's exactly right," Draco answered with a note of praise. "Such a smart boy I've got! Now let's get you all dressed up for today's trip!"
"So what's up, anyway?" Harry said, now testing the waters. He was worried about his friends, but he wasn't sure how to bring it up without prodding too much. When Ron looked at him, Harry rolled his eyes, unable to control himself. "Oh give it up, Ron. I've known you for so long that I'm pretty sure I know when something's wrong. You're fighting again, are you?"
Potter laughed some more. "Let's just say you'll be asking us out for those pints yourself, soon enough. Anyway, goodbye!" Before he could say anything in response, the Floo connection disappeared, leaving Draco with a confused look on his face while he absorbed the fact that Potter had invited him out for drinks.
"No, they won't let me," Ginny acknowledged resignedly, "but I can't have myself missing the rest. Just because I can't fly doesn't mean I can't learn the moves and study the formations with the others. Six months is a long time to miss training, Harry."
Something inside Harry was stirring, and it made him feel uncomfortable. So what if Draco was going to have a kid? Why did he have to single him out with his letter? He knew that Draco was still outside of the wards around James, so he couldn't know that Harry was actually a father to a one year old. He wondered, therefore, why Draco would think he could understand the need to prioritize family.
"Oh, Harry!" she said, voice sounding frantic. "I'm so glad you're home, I was afraid you'd still be out, but-"
Harry was worried that Hermione might have been offended, but she clearly thought that Malfoy's sense of humor was worth laughing over. She gently rested her arms across her very pregnant belly. Ron placed a palm on her stomach as well, and Harry caught what seemed to be longing on Malfoy's face as he watched the couple.
She was beautiful in an offhanded way, as if she woke up not knowing how she looked and just went about her day not caring about it. She looked familiar, but he couldn't place her features. She had a graceful and lithe form, which was why she had been able to smoothly pick up Draco's books and deposit them in a fluid motion.
"I find it quite easy to talk with you. Whatever the topic, actually. I'm sure we could spend hours and hours just exchanging banter and not tiring of it.
Draco sought out his mother and found her once again watering her own plants. "Good morning," he greeted her.
"Any news?" he asked hopefully. Given that he didn't really have spousal privileges (he thought of this with a lot of bitterness), he had to depend on either Arthur or Molly for Ginny's medical updates.
"You'll offend a lot of people talking like that, Ron," added Ginny. "You should watch it." This time there was a glint in her eye when she looked pointedly at her brother.
"She should have realized that before accepting your proposal, way before you guys had James," Ron said grumpily.
"I thought it was taking too long," he whinged, "and anyway, we'd already gotten more than the amount we initially agreed upon."
Draco was beginning to understand what she meant, though the entire concept of DNA and - what did she call it? - Genetics. "So what you're saying is, you hope to find a pattern in the Black family bloodline?"
Astounded as he was that his wife was able to secure the required international Portkey permits in only two days, Draco still felt odd about coming back home to British soil. After much thinking, he realized that it had been one of the few times he had spent that many days in the presence of both his son and his wife, the three of them together. Something about it had made him feel more light-hearted, and he wondered if there was any truth to the rubbish about falling for someone again and again.
Draco turned to her and saw a sparkle in her eyes that meant that she was bravely keeping back tears. "No need to turn on the Aguamenti, mother!" he sighed exasperatedly, even as he informally wrapped his arm around her shoulder. Physical affection was not commonly practiced in the Malfoy line, which made both Draco and Narcissa feel smug that they were able to rebel in their own little way.
To the Auror's satisfaction, the blonde had nothing more coherent to say, and Malloy's unconscious imitation of a gaping fish pretty much told Harry that he had won this round. Now, all that was left to do was figure out was how to actually apprehend the mystery suspect.
"It doesn't really mean much though, not if she hasn't shown the slightest interest in moving forward with me. It's not exactly reassuring that both Ginny and I are actually fine being apart.
She smiled seductively and pulled him to his feet along with her. They made sure to levitate James behind them as they moved to the bedroom, sharing more kisses on the way. When the bassinet was finally secured, the two of them fell hard onto the bed, where they proceeded to shed each other's remaining clothing.
"By chance, Ginny was called to a last minute full team assembly, Molly and Arthur went back to France because Louis has dragonpox, I think. Hermione was sent on some confidential meeting in Prague - don't ask me, no idea - and Ron took the weekend off to be her Auror escort. Andy, as you might already know, is trying to fix up the rest of the legal problems in America."
"Of course you got one, too," Ginevra said, "I forgot you've had to consult with that food poisoning potion a few months back."
This case frustrated him, mostly because he knew he couldn't be out there, actually doing something, until he was able to glean enough information from the stacks of parchment littering his table. The severity of the situation was like a bell tolling in his head, reminding him that time was running out and that the consequences would be dire. His eyes flicked towards a photograph on one of the piles. He quickly averted his gaze, but the image had already been burned into his mind anyway. How could he forget that frail body, slumped on a carpeted floor, light hair strewn awkwardly on the floor around the girl's face? She was only one of many victims, and it was up to Harry to track down the murderer.
"Er, alright," he managed to blurt out as Draco helped himself to the Floo powder. "Mind your head, wouldn't want to damage your overinflated ego."
"Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder," Potter replied. "We all had it bad, but I think Hermione was able to treat mine better because she didn't make it seem like a debilitating disease for me. Didn't make it seem like I was mental after everything. Kind of eased me through it, her and Ron."
The admission, concise as it was, meant so much more to Harry, who knew that Draco would not have uttered such a statement of weakness if it weren't just the two of them.
"And how do you think it will provide a better solution if even the magical means are failing?" Astoria asked concernedly. "What difference does it make?"
"I apologize, miss," Draco said immediately, not realizing that he had put her on the defensive. "Not many people have interest in such books, and I was just a tad surprised. You do not look like someone who would even look at a Potions manual, let alone be interested in purchasing it."
"I still need to know how he could be getting through the wards," Narcissa said flatly. "Excuse me."
There, so blatant and obvious, displayed obscenely in front of them, was a mind map that was so clearly influenced by a certain substance called Persephone's Poison.
The Golden Trio, or so they have been fondly called by the Wizarding world, have been up and about, forging their own paths after their less-than-normal school days. It has been almost four years since the Battle of Hogwarts, and it pleases this reporter to share news of a much brighter and happier nature about our favorite heroes. After being given clearance for a very short interview (which Mr. Potter has been so generous to provide), and armed with the new and improved Quick-Qualifiable-Quotes Quill, the Daily Prophet now brings you a much-awaited glimpse into their highly private lives.
Harry closed his eyes, mentally unravelling the knots he had built around his James. The magic around both of them was intricate, and answered only to his magical signature. Slowly, he tore apart the layers of the
The change in his expression was not lost on Narcissa. The look of absolute joy on her only son’s face had shocked her, because she had never seen him so happy before. And now, she felt her heart break a little, seeing the happiness fade into nonexistence as he walked away.
"You're talking about the woman who insisted on a wedding on the eve of Voldemort's take-over of the Minsitry. I think her priorities might be a little muddled."
Several weeks after they felt comfortable with the changes, Harry made a specific change to the wards, making their relationship 'available' to the public once again, to an extent.
Since they were in a private suite in St. Mungo's, visitors had to be approved by the family beforehand. A small group of Greengrass cousins had visited briefly, as did several of Astoria's socialite friends. Draco found this visit highly entertaining due to the fact that the ladies had had no idea what else to do with a real baby apart from coo at it from a distance.
The house itself seemed awfully familiar, though he couldn't for the life of him think when he could have gotten a glimpse of Potter's home before.
"You look like shit. My house elves dress better than that, and they have no clothes. Go freshen up before you join me for breakfast. Robes are in the left hand side of the closet."
"I know, Har," Ginny said before turning a bit red in the cheeks. "But… well, what about when we both eventually have to bring other people over? Won't that be just… weird?"
"I will allow it. But I will have you officially grounded for medical reasons after your fourth month, and request for a maternity leave after the sixth month, as I've mentioned earlier."
Harry leaned back and thought back. So far, they had been able to take turns in watching the kids so they both had enough time to take care of their own responsibilities while also being there for their children. However, this sometimes involved sudden exchanges between Grimmauld Place and the Burrow, where Molly and Arthur now lived again after moving back from France (Ron and Hermione having been given the use of Shell Cottage for their own family.)
"I see," the blonde answered, seemingly deep in thought. Harry was surprised that there were no follow-up inquiries, and he wondered what he could be thinking about so thoroughly, when Ron interrupted Malfoy with his own questions.
"Er," Potter said, realizing that they had been silent. "Anyways, that's about it. We'll see you when you feel ready to get back on stage."
"I'll be back right after the six weeks, Harry," Ginny finally said, as they felt the first few rays of the sun slowly break into their room. "We can owl each other, I'll find some way of communicating as often as possible from there. I'll fight the coaches if I have to, I promise, Harry, I just - I don't want you thinking that this doesn't mean anything to me. You- you and James are everything to me, Harry. Believe me when I say that."
Draco felt a little indignant when he realized that he had only gotten an owl. Didn't he get the intimate privilege of a personal Patronus message, too?
"Old habits die hard," Malfoy winked at her. "I was just telling Potter this morning that it will be a long while before I make the switch to 'Harry', so perhaps we can add 'Hermione' to that list. Anyway, calling you 'Weasley' just blurs you with all the other Weasleys I already have to keep tabs on in my head. That's way too many, without you having to add to the lot."
"Yes, I do," Potter said, then shrugged. "But I don't like the idea of having a sort of slave or servant, so I have Kreacher take care only of what I can't manage on my own. It works out pretty fine."
"We're taking this very personally," Harry interjected somewhat fiercely. "Draco is our friend, and we would do anything to keep him out of harm. His family included."
There was a chime from the sitting room, and all people present looked towards the family clock, on which the hand bearing Percy's name swiveled from 'Traveling' to 'Home'. In a heartbeat, he stepped out of the Floo and brushed off the soot from his robes.
Draco picked up on the hint. "You don't think he's in charge of anything." he concluded matter-of-factly.
Malfoy mockingly rolled his eyes. "If that classified as pretty to both of you, then Merlin help us, you two are obviously lacking in taste".
"We're Gryffindors, mate!" Harry exclaimed with pride. "Nothing half-arsed, all brute force," he added with a wink. "You won't get rid of us that easily."
"Morning, all!" Percy greeted, settling in a seat beside Ron and grabbing some toast. "Sorry I'm late, had a bit of a mess this morning at work, you see." At this, he winked at Harry, who had no idea what he meant.
Hermione let out a very long sigh. "Harry... after everything you've told us in the last few months... well, it's a bit hard to ignore all the issues that have apparently crept up on you and piled up over the years. It just seems... I don't know, such a waste," she hazarded, but Harry seemed to be open enough to at least her own opinions on the matter. How very mature they had all become. "But if you think it's better this way, well, only you and she can be a judge of that."
: No, it wasn't. And neither was the information about Sirius Black. (clenches fists) In his case, there were witnesses, and there was Pettigrew's finger for evidence. No one even thought to look further, no one focused on hearing out Sirius' story. He was just dismissed and carted off to Azkaban. If the Aurors then had questioned Sirius more thoroughly, they would have understood the real intent, the betrayal of Pettigrew, and the innocence of my godfather.
s wards is the direct result of its running on one's magical core. For as long as the focus desires the existence of wards, the magical intent behind it will automatically power the wards no matter how many or how far, or even how long in terms of time."
Draco nodded at him gratefully before disappearing up the stairwell. Harry let out a soft laugh of amusement at seeing his friend being pushed around by a little kid. With a wordless spell, he urged on the floating bassinet carefully to settle the sleeping baby with his sons. He renewed the Monitoring charms in the room and checked in with Kreacher, before turning back towards Teddy's room.
“You want him to move in.” There was no expression in Ron’s voice, which Harry knew was a very bad sign. “You’re going to ask
“Do you think at any point in the last day I’ve been able to think clearly enough to come up with a PR strategy?” Harry retorted.  Even Draco flushed at this, and Harry felt vindicated that he wasn’t the only one dying of embarrassment right now.
“Relax, Granger,” he said, “Sapphy was terribly excited to come.  She’s learned all kinds of new recipes from the French elves, and I think she gets bored cooking for just Mother all the time.”
However, victim-impact statements today painted a very different picture of his actions. Among those who spoke on Malfoy’s behalf were esteemed wand-maker Garrick Ollivander, and Luna Lovegood, daughter of
may have been totally right about your arse.  It doesn’t make it any less ridiculous that you - war hero, respected Ministry employee - spent most of tonight getting smashed, in hotpants.”
Draco didn’t need to explain that: the overwhelming feeling of the room was that it was home.  The walls were a pale, warm gold - Tepid Cava, Harry thought the paint sample had said - which was reminiscent of Gryffindor tower in the way a dream is reminiscent of a place; with the same atmosphere but not quite the same vibrance.  There was a dark red, ridiculously comfortable-looking armchair in the corner, because Draco couldn’t help taking the piss out of the Gryffindor aesthetic just a little bit, but it fitted in with the dark wood of the rest of the furniture, which made the room look like it belonged to a real grown-up.
The stately architecture and high ceilings lend themselves well to this lustrous palette, and the simpler – but no less exquisite – furnishings serve to accentuate the grandeur of the house while also creating a more approachable atmosphere: it certainly stands apart from most other historic pureblood residences. However, while I myself was pleasantly surprised to witness what the Malfoy family has accomplished, it remains to be seen whether the wider magical communities will be accepting of what some are calling ‘the rejection of a noble heritage’.
“I couldn’t actually get your favourite: it’s still on display, and it belongs to some anonymous collector who’s even richer than you.  But then I spoke to her agent, and threw my name around a bit to get into the studio. It turns out she’s a fan - of yours as well as mine, actually, and of the contents of my Gringotts vault - so she let me take my pick and I just bought the one that felt the most you; I really hope it’s okay.”
Lovegood, showing great courage and poise for one so young, claimed, “Draco hated watching us being tortured, and was sometimes physically sick when he was forced to stay in the room...  When [You-Know-Who] told him to hurt us, he clearly didn’t want to, but only did what he was told because he was threatened, too.”
“It’s not like I was prepared for this, okay?  Next time I’ll do laundry before I let you accost me,” Harry said defensively.
He gave the room an appraising look, muttering what Harry recognised as measuring charms, and then started to rearrange the furniture.  Getting settled in already, Harry thought.  Too late to back out now.
are calling me a ‘design prodigy’ so I must have done something right,” Malfoy said lightly.  He seemed to be working really hard to be polite to Ron - Harry had to concede that his friend wasn’t making it easy.
Harry laughed, shooting Hermione a grateful look.  “Cheers, Ron, I appreciate your support.  Don’t worry; he’ll probably say no, anyway.”
“So before we go to the right place, Harry tries to Vanish all the paint off his robes - but he’s in such a state that he accidentally Evanescos the entire lot!  Had to slink back into the office practically starkers and nab what was left in the spare clothing bin - not that there was much choice there, obviously!”
Harry was pleasantly tipsy, and only half-listening to Draco’s seemingly endless list of dinner suggestions - which on a Friday inevitably ended up being takeaway anyway - when Draco stopped suddenly.
The awful painting of Sirius’s mum was finally gone too, replaced with a mirror that was very critical of Harry’s hair but overall much more pleasant, and also made the entrance hall feel bigger.
Although Draco wasn’t doing much flying or anything near Harry’s punishing training regime, he was still really bloody fit.  The manual parts of his job were paying off especially, Harry observed, because Draco had very nice arms.  He didn’t think he’d ever paid attention to anyone’s arms before… but then again, he hadn’t ever paid that much attention to another man’s body before.  When he thought about it, though, his girlfriends had always been slim and athletic, too; perhaps he had a type.  If he did, Draco was the perfect example; all pale and lean and gorgeous.
She nodded in response, clearly thrown.  “I’m glad you changed the house,” she replied at last. “It shows you have a conscience, that you couldn’t live with what happened here.”
“It’s not fair.  And it’s not exactly what I meant.  I’m making such a mess of this.”  Harry ran a hand through his hair in frustration.  “If you’d read any of the letters it would help; they were a lot more articulate.”
“I am, as a matter of fact,” Harry replied, unfolding the invitation to look again.  “He invited us as a sign of good faith; it’d be rude not to.”
“Shut up,” Harry replied, turning to kiss him.  “You’re going to be even more insufferable now, aren’t you?”
Harry put up with a whole hour and a half of being catcalled and ogled every time he got out of his seat before he called it a night.  He told Draco to stay on if he wanted, but he insisted on heading back too - “Just so you don’t get mistaken for a rent boy on the way home.”
Excuse my curiosity, but I thought you had decided against actually living at the Black house: why the sudden desire to open its Floo channels?
Draco’s residual laughter died down, and they all looked at the picture in silence for a moment.  “Hold on, I’m starting to see what you mean about it reminding you of Harry,” Draco said eventually.  “It’s a successful piece, but you can’t tell how much of that is deliberate and how much is a happy accident.  To the untrained eye, it’s also a complete mess.  That sums him up, really.”
He doubted Malfoy would be at work, let alone accepting clients at - he cast a quick Tempus and winced - six twenty-six a.m., but Harry still had to endure a couple more months of being a Junior Auror with its horrible hours, and he knew that by the time he got off work he’d be in no mood to talk about tables.  He picked up a couple of pastries on his way to make the whole thing less painful for both of them, and knocked loudly on the door of Malfoy’s studio.
On the fourth floor are the two final rooms; one of which is clearly Draco’s bedroom, judging by the snakes present throughout the decor and the warm grey walls - though this has widely become a trend in design circles, it was of course pioneered by Draco in his unforgettable transformation of the Zabini family’s summerhouse.  I am somewhat surprised to see the room so sparse, empty but for the luxurious bed with matching nightstands, and a wardrobe worthy of any member of the
“I really don’t want to go into that now.  You said you were here to talk if I’m ready, and I’m not ready for anything except a good night’s sleep.”  Harry turned from the room and started towards the kitchen.
Clearly Harry wasn’t meant to hear that, let alone be able to interpret it, so he chose to ignore both the remark and the weird fluttering feeling in his chest.
Draco looked just as lost as Harry felt, and Harry couldn’t read his expression, couldn't look away.  “I’m not going to be another person who tells you how to live your life.  But, if I know one thing, it’s that you made the right choice. Ginny Weasley could never make you happy.”  Draco closed his eyes for a second and took a deep breath. “But I can.”
“I don’t care how funny it is watching Weasley get smashed,” Draco said petulantly, “you can’t expect me to spend the whole day out drinking with our friends and not be able to touch you.”
Harry turned his attention to Ron, who was gawking at them in horror.  “You and Malfoy.  You,” he pointed at Harry, “and Malfoy,” he pointed at Draco, “together.”
After the evening he’d had, Harry was hoping to come in quietly and just go to bed without rehashing every detail of the disastrous dinner – but this was relying on Draco Malfoy not being a nosy bastard, and was, Harry realised, a plan doomed from the start.
“When Master is ready, lunch is served,” Sapphy said with a sweeping curtsey, before Disapparating back to the kitchen.
“No, don’t ‘but’ me.  We’ve been going round in circles.  I love you and think we would be great together, but for some reason you refuse to give it another try.  Instead, we’re ‘trying to be friends’ or ‘seeing how it goes’, or whatever you want to call it, as if we don’t know each other inside and out.”
They were at the fifth pub, pleasantly buzzed (and totally exhausted) when Harry realised just how bad an idea this was.  It wasn’t only the fact that Sneezewort was a terrible microbrewery-cum-garden that made its own beers, inspired by commonly-used potions (Harry would rather be drinking drain cleaner than Skele-gro Stout): he was also having a very hard time keeping his hands off Draco.
“I suppose we do bicker sometimes,” Draco admits, “but there’s nothing malicious in it at this point.  I imagine us more like an old married couple.”
Draco seemed to consider his response carefully, opening his mouth a few times before finally saying, “Of course I’m happy.  I’m one of very few people in the world who knows exactly what Harry Potter likes in the bedroom.  I’m going to make a fortune from
“‘I wish he was mine, he’s really divine; the hero who conquered the Dark Lord’,” Draco finished, nearly dissolving into hysterics.  “That was such a good day.”
Draco groaned.  “Do we have to?  I have some much better ideas for how to spend the day, and they all involve staying in this bed.”
Even after so many years, Harry couldn’t help squirming a bit inside under Hermione’s scrutiny.  “Other than a Time-Turner, I’ve no idea.  I’m sending the owl down a few times a week, but she always comes back in a terrible mood with the letters still sealed.   I really need him back urgently now. The upstairs shower doesn’t work properly unless he’s in the house.  He spent so much time renovating the bathrooms that the whole plumbing system likes him best.”
“No one’s got that kind of power,” Zabini replied sadly, turning to his other side and starting a discussion with Goyle and Bulstrode about baby names.
The rumours began in April.  Harry saw the first article in the papers when he got home from a grueling all-night training session on ‘seeing while remaining unseen’.  He’d been hoping to have some breakfast - or did it count as dinner? - and go straight to bed, when the Daily Prophet landed right on top of his toast.
The first gala that required the Malfoy couple's attendance was surprisingly enjoyable. Astoria had agreed to the idea of bringing along Scorpius in her arms upon arrival, in order to introduce him to the who's who of international wizarding diplomacy. Of course, they had a house elf bring their son home after the initial introductions because dragging him along for the entire night would have been an unnecessary inconvenience for them.
Ginny heard the softness in his voice, and she got up and went to him, nuzzling the top of his head and running her fingers down his tense chest.
, if you ask me," Harry mused before he could stop himself from speaking. He immediately turned into a deep shade of red. He didn't want to sound all sappy in front of Malfoy.
"Dracooooooooooo!" A multicolored blur crashed into Malfoy's legs and Harry had to hold Teddy back a little so that Malfoy wouldn't lose balance.
It wasn't even something he could properly process at the moment, but his thoughts and actions confirmed the facts: he undoubtedly cared about Draco Malfoy. A fucking lot, if his tightly clenched fists and escalating frustration were anything to go by. Harry hadn't exactly left himself much room for denial.
"And what's that supposed to mean!" Draco could not deny the betrayal he now felt upon learning that his own mother expected him to stray.
Naturally, at first, Harry had had trouble juggling the baby-watch between himself, Ginny, Molly and Andromeda. However, Kingsley himself saw the need to change Harry's hours to accommodate James' care. Therefore, he had placed Harry on a paternal leave, letting him work from home so that he could be with James around the clock. Harry liked this arrangement, since it gave him time with his son, as well as let him continue his responsibilities as the Head of MMI. What he hated about it was the feeling of loneliness brought about by spending the entire day in an empty flat.
Draco had thought about that angle as well. He knew enough of Potter to guess that he was a family man, but he couldn't imagine how odd of a life that would be, to hide away your family in a box and stuff it in a corner where no one could find it.
"What now?" he asked with an already defeated sigh when he saw the expression on Ella's face. Hell, even Ron knew things would have to go bad where Harry was concerned before they could ever get to the brighter side.
Harry Potter. Harry Bloody Freaking Potter had sat himself in the stands, his face unreadable and his posture quite relaxed. Calmly, he stated his name and introduction for the record. It was such an odd picture, and it contrasted greatly with the grim tension that now enveloped the chamber. Draco found himself clutching at his stone chair, his knuckles turning white. For the first time, he was trembling. His mother, on the other hand, had an even cooler expression on her face, as if she had been carved out of stone, and then turned to ice. Surely with Potter testifying against them, neither would see the light of day for the rest of their lives. He had all the information necessary to incriminate them both, after all. Draco flinched at the thought of his future being in the hands of his archenemy. He and his mother were at his mercy, and Draco hated it.
"Yes, that was one of the possibilities we considered," said Weasley. "But our team went overtime with the MMI mind-exploration."
Ron laughed. "It's been working out fine, really. It's not so big a difference when you think about it, I mean in the end, it's two people who agree to be bonded for the rest of their lives, right? Stipulations or no, you both decide to be together anyway."
Draco laughed this time, prior tension melting away. "Even if I end up in one of their houses, I'll be even safer there than in the Ministry," he assured her. "Perks of being friends with the Boy Who Lived, you know. Maximum security."
Harry shook his head. "Hermione already tried to file for an exception to the Statute of Secrecy, something about revealing magical information to on a need-to-know basis if there's a familial relationship, so Andy can finally tell Ted's siblings what happened. But a committee told Mione that they still have to debate the merits of sharing such information since Ted had already passed away. They see no reason for his muggle relatives to be informed at all since there's technically no more familial link between Andy and the Tonks except for Teddy. And the muggles aren't interested in gaining custody of him. It's a whole mess, but at least the decision will be out soon."
While deep in thought, his Floo changed color, indicating an incoming call. He waved his hand to open the connection, only to find himself facing none other than-
Narcissa was beside herself with worry. "Has anything happened, dear?" she asked softly, "did you overtax yourself, or did you-"
Draco nodded. "I believe she is the younger Greengrass. We never met at Hogwarts, but she was a couple of years below."
Narcissa looked at him with a calculating look. "Yes, but not everyone would drop everything to help a Malfoy, much less my son."
He had been gobsmacked by the front page news that day, though he hadn't had the nerve to mention it to the Auror in case it was a much more sensitive issue. Draco couldn't deny, however, that he was very worried what it might mean to his new friend. For once, he understood what the Trio had meant about being supportive in times of emotional upheavals. He wanted to be supportive, but he didn't know how.
The young witch beside him, Ella-something, Draco recalled, nodded her head. "That's right, Mr. Malfoy, Auror Potter can provide you with the necessary protection since it would be best for you to carry on your usual activities. It would throw off the suspect and make him wonder why his initial threat did not cause you to panic."
"Well?" Ginny asked, looking concerned at all the conjured colored swirls floating in the air that were apparently signs of her health, and of the baby's condition.
"It is not a laughing matter. Be safe. And come home early enough so you can tell me that I was right."
Narcissa cleared her throat, which made Draco realize that he had been silently seething while his mother watched amusedly. He shook his head imperceptibly and started on the platter that had been waiting in front of him. Breakfast that morning was a wordless affair.
"Sorry," Potter offered with a weak smile. "I was sort of in a hurry when I sent you that owl. But evidently, your messenger was more effective than my Patronus messages to Ron and Hermione. Go figure."
"Dating a high profile celebrity is such a chore sometimes," she lamented dramatically. "All that practice answering the age old question of 'what's it like being a nobody dating somebody famous?'"
: (flustered) Y-yes Mr. Potter. (rifles through notes) Ms. Granger, our readers also have a lot of questions for you. I'm not sure if you are aware, but a large number of your fans are young women who admire you for being a role model.
Harry brushed off Ron's sudden mood drop, trying to lighten it again. "I was surprised, but he owled me back the same day with a pretty straightforward agreement to help us in the case. Can't tell you enough how relieved I am," he added for good measure. "If he can't help us figure out that stupid potion, I might get desperate enough to bring Snape back to life."
As for Draco's friends, they had been unable to make it. Pansy and Oliver were still in Africa for the next three days, while Blaise was brokering a major business merger in America and wouldn't be back for a month. Draco didn't take it against them, and he sat back in a stuffy armchair next to Astoria's bed with full intention of melting into it. The elder Greengrasses, as well as Narcissa, had gone an hour and a half ago, which left Draco and his wife the rest of the evening to themselves.
"I bet you aren't even listening anymore, are you?" a sarcastic voice whined, bringing Harry's attention back to the prat in front of him. "Dear Merlin, Potter, I thought caffeine was supposed to make your senses sharper."
After a rather slow morning of parchment work, Harry finally gave it a rest and stretched his arms up as if he were a cat. Wondering if lunch that day would be courtesy of him or Kreacher, he wandered over to the kitchen. On the way, however, he spotted Ginny huddled in front of the fire.
"If it makes you feel any better, Ron and I and every single Auror are supposed to do this. Ironic, isn't it?"
"That makes two of us," Potter answered nonchalantly. "It seemed like a good idea at the time. And I've made your tea as you like it." He indicated the cup in front of him with an exaggerated flourish of his hand like an overzealous waiter at a fancy restaurant.
"She has been acting different after Scorpius' birth," Narcissa pondered. "Perhaps she was not ready for this stage in your life?"
Harry shook his head and took her face gently in his hands. "This is a big deal, Ginny. I want it to be clear to you that I am not blaming you for anything. I don't think our problems are truly our fault. It's... a complicated mess... but I don't blame you. It's very important for me to tell you that."
"Just Harry." Potter leaned back and closed his own eyes. "If I'm not mistaken, we'd agreed to at least call each other by our first names now."
Astoria laughed, her voice tinkling like a bell at the theatrics of the Chosen One. "My dear Mister Potter, how gallant of you to grace our family with your presence," she answered with a bit of a smirk.
But Harry had known instantly, deep within him, that he was happy with the news. He was shocked, of course! He had been stunned for a few seconds,and then became more ecstatic as he realized that
Potter huffed. "Of course you have. The entire magical community has." He scrunched up his nose in distaste. "As if there weren't anything else they could talk about my life, eh? A relationship scandal is sure to bring up every wrong thing I've ever done in this world since I was born."
"Indeed, Mr. Malfoy," the deep voice said assuringly. "Understand that your mother will continue under her probation to full term. Your case is quite different, you see. You have proven to be quite the 'good boy' over the last ten months, it seemed a shame if your efforts had gone unnoticed. Two more months of probation seem to be redundant given the service you have already rendered while under your sentence."
The balding redhead shook his head and gave his own version of a weak smile. "Yes, but nothing too detailed yet," he said in a placating tone. "It might please you to know, though, that Healer Rosewood informed the other members of her team that you are to be treated as Ginny's next of kin alongside us, despite your not officially being married to her."
To be honest, though, Draco's main concern was how much time he would be able to steal away with his son while they were on the trip.
"We'll talk about it later," Harry whispered to Ginny discreetly when he felt her grumbling. "We have a lot to talk about but not here and not now."
Harry just scoffed. "It doesn't work that way. And no, it won't happen in a while, I'm sure of that. Probably in years. Come on," he said suddenly, shaking his head and trying to change the topic. "No need for us to worry about this
Potter laughed heartily at this. "No, I don't suppose it does," he choked out. "It seems I can adjust better than you. Though I think the only reason I can easily switch between your first and last names is because they're both equally weird to me. So it makes no difference, really."
As expected, they were ushered into the room full of Ministry officials, a few civilians and a couple of reporters. This was a private trial, though neither Draco nor Narcissa had any idea why they were even allowed that luxury. They didn't refuse or question, of course. At least not everyone would share the memory of seeing the once-regal Malfoys, magically bound by their wrists, awaiting judgment from people who would most definitely love to see them both thrown into Azkaban with Dementors.
"How are Narcissa and Astoria?" Harry ventured. He wasn't too close to either, since he only saw them at the few social events he actually attended. They were nice, and they'd had some good conversations, but the connection would not have held the
"I didn't want kids so early, Draco," she said in a soft voice, as if afraid of actually saying it out loud. "Now we've got two, and I'm still getting used to being the stay-at-home mother when part of me still yearns for the career I had so carefully planned out..."
"See here," Harry said, pointing at a particular parchment filled with various tables and lists. "He told me that these particular apothecaries are the most sought after for higher quality botanical ingredients."
, he thought bitterly to himself. Hermione's presence in the Manor, coupled with an extended exposure to Narcissa and Astoria, might have been too much for him to ask. One couldn't simply sweep everything under the rug - especially not under the rug that Hermione had possibly been tortured on.
"Errr...that'd be my fault," said Potter, shifting uneasily on his feet under the blonde's glare. "We... I... just did a bit of convincing for the mediwitch to let me in, said you were a good friend and that you wouldn't mind the surprise visit."
"No, of course not," he replied with a laugh of his own. "Just unexpected, that's all. Still a decent hour well before midnight, so you weren't on my list of people to expect."
any sort of mundane parchment work, usually having others on hand to do so for him. "Is this standard procedure?" he inquired while flipping through the pages and making mental notes on where he needed to sign.
"Ron!" the brunet cried out excitedly. "D'you remember a few weeks back, when Malfoy gave you permission to place that new tracking charm on him and Scorpius?"
Harry could swear that the silence around him suddenly became deafening, if that were even possible. How was it that he had been able to feel braver in front of an audience filled with faceless strangers? Yet now that he was in an official meeting with Ministry representatives, he almost felt like a little child who was asking for more than he could have. In fact, the entire affair looked exactly like his hearing back when he was 15.
"We elves has tested the letter, but magic is not allowing us to open the seal." the elf explained nervously. "We is not sending it up to Master's room without Master's permission."
"I told you, we've tried, time and again, but it just didn't work anymore," the brunet said evenly, though with a slight hitch in his voice that the other two failed to notice, or just pretended not to. "We both looked closely at where we are now, what we used to want together, and where we want to be eventually. Looks like the way our relationship developed over the last couple years has helped us to grow and find our way, but we have ended up on different paths, I guess. That's the best way I can kind of explain it."
She nodded sleepily and gave him a tentative smile. She shook her ring finger exaggeratedly. "Yes, yes, I'll activate it in case of an emergency. Happy now?"
With shaking hands, Draco ripped the envelope open and slowly read the words. With great difficulty, he handed the papers back to Hermione, before admitting, "I cannot make sense of this information."
Draco didn't think he'd have to stay beyond dinner this time, but when Harry suggested he remain for another night under the wards of Grimmauld Place, how could he say no?
"I didn't realize..." she murmured, more to herself. Then she looked up at him. "Harry told me that I was putting up my own obstacles, making out to myself that things were more difficult than they were, just so I could push myself further... I never really thought it was possibly as dangerous as you just told me now..."
"Fucker." Harry went through the pages. "I swear, if he weren't our boss... d'you think we can Floo them both and just have them sign? Send him back his bloody owl as soon as it's all done."
"DNA, unlike magical signatures or auras, cannot be easily tampered with. Scorpius' DNA is a mix of Draco's and Astoria's. Draco's is a mix of yours, Narcissa, and Lucius'. There is a certain analogy in familial relationships which is why I also want to examine Teddy Lupin's DNA, which is related to Andromeda's in much the same degree as Scorpius is to you."
Ron and Hermione had not, as Harry expected, started screaming at him. However, both of his best friends were rendered speechless for quite a while, and he merely spent their confused silence, patiently waiting.
Ambition was important to him. The way he went at it now was very different from his father's teachings, but his way had yielded more favorable results. The family name had almost completely been cleared socially. Draco and Astoria's engagement was publicly praised and anticipated. Narcissa was accepted as Lady Black, and had once again become the respected hostess who threw the best galas. He himself was on the way to an honorable career. He had so many more plans, so much more in his repertoire, and he didn't intend to slow down in the near future. He knew what he wanted, and he was going to take it.
"Well, what I want to say is that... I love the privacy, but I would also love for the whole world to know how much I.. er, well, for them to know about us."
"It's all about necessity. You support yourself and your friends by forming connections, perhaps even close relationships. But mostly, being Slytherin is all about the stakes, Potter. How to stack them, and how to use them wisely to your advantage." There was a sharp gleam in Malfoy's eye, which made Harry wonder exactly how different the Slytherin formative years were if they all needed to watch their own backs at every second in the Snake Pit.
Harry could see the blonde waver, but then steel his resolve in a second. "I'd like to authorize the monitoring charms you told me about." "What?" Harry was shocked. "Are you sure? I thought you despised the idea of being trailed and tracked by Aurors?"
"You had your reasons, Harry. Not everyone will understand. Hell, even I was a bit surprised when you told me your plan to appear in court, but again, no one can say anything about it because you chose to do it."
"Will that be all then?" he asked, unsure. When Hermione nodded morosely, Draco sighed. "Alright. Glad to have been of use. Have a good day."
Instead, he'd simply said "I'd love to stay." Perhaps a little too quickly. But he did mean every word.
This time, he felt the full weight of the young boy on his stomach, and he let out an undignified 'oomph'.
Draco looked at the image of Potter in his mind's eye. He'd always had a very good memory, and it'd come useful many times before. That was when he actually noticed the unique positioning of the arms. It was similar to what Pansy had taught him, when she insisted that he hold her-
Harry was surprised. Shocked, even. He had expected some sort of feminist outburst or argument from her, and this development was completely unexpected for him.
Harry cracked one eye open in the bright sunlight and groaned. He sort of had an idea where he was, but a part of him was now burning in equal parts of embarrassment and guilt.
The Malfoy library was littered with bits and pieces of parchment, it looked as if a gigantic Christmas cracker had exploded inside. For the last month, the house elves, fearing Draco's last outburst, had agreed not to clean up after him lest they disturb the organized chaos on the tables and all over the floor. Granted, Draco had always been a neat-freak, and cleaned up after himself. But on occasion, especially during highly-demanding projects such as this, his brainstorming was only improved by allowing his train of thought to travel from the notes he laid around himself. This way, he allowed his mind to build connections or link information that otherwise would have escaped his scrutiny. At the moment, he was the epicenter of a three-foot thick circle of paper scraps, all with some valuable information scribbled. Narcissa and the elves knew not to disturb Draco during these times, so it was to his immense irritation that someone suddenly attempted to break down the library doors with a series of frustrated knocks.
"Nah, Helen told her she's too magically unstable to go through any means of magical transportation regularly. And she can fly, but she can't be expected to fly cross country every day. So, she'll stay in Montreal for the remaining weeks then come back and stay full time training in the Harpies stadium." When Ron raised an eyebrow, Harry just shrugged. "What?" he asked, "It'll be like when we were still just dating and she would come over once or twice a month just to hang out with me."
"Hello, James Sirius." And he let his tears flow freely, leaning into Ginny, as they both basked in each other's presence, and that of their first born son.
"No, in literal terms," Harry answered. "She hates being grounded from flight, and the same thing goes for the rest of her life. And I can see that. The reason she has been happy Chasing for the Harpies is because she really feels happiest when she is in the air and pushing a team towards victory. There's a fire in her that won't ever become satisfied if it had to be kept down. And being with me kind of does that now."
No, Harry hadn't been told. But he had always assumed that living under the same roof as Voldemort would have unhinged a normal man, more so a teenager. He shook his head, so that Malfoy wouldn't feel as if he had been interrupted.
"Okay, what stipulations do you keep mentioning?" Harry asked them both. "Muggle-raised wizard, here."
"It is a big deal," Draco insisted, though weakly, given that he had no real argument other than his insecurities. "I am very well versed in the concept of
When Draco threw a doubtful look at him, he shrugged. "Sure, I used to gag at the idea when he'd mention it. I was really young, what do you expect? But after…" he gulped. "After I dueled with Voldemort… I dunno, I realized that I had to admit to myself… I was scared - I was afraid. I had to fucking die, if you'll recall. That walk into the Forbidden Forest was one of my most fucked up moments in life, and that's saying something."
Ron nodded sagely and used his wand to magically throw some Floo powder into the fire. "Ernie Macmillan!" he called out.
Harry shook his head. "She needs about a day or two to get approval for an international Floo call. I expect she'll get in touch by tomorrow morning."
Sometimes, they had James, Al and Scorpius as well, though the latter two were usually kept in the enlarged crib while Teddy spent time with Draco and Harry kept an eye on a crawling James.
"Nonsense, dear!" Mrs. Weasley admonished. "Don't take it the wrong way, I simply meant to say how horrid some people had been to you over the years!" She continued to grumble about reporters sticking their nose in his business as she fussed over the breakfast being served. Harry shook his head and let her go on her tirade. It was true that the Weasleys were the most harangued for "keeping the Chosen One from the rest of the world". In a way, Harry thought, this day was also for them to celebrate.
"Go on then," said Ron, leaning back and rubbing over his middle. "Tell us all about how Harry caused mayhem in the Ministry yet again."
They had decided to spend this first day of freedom by going out in the open and enjoying each other's company for the first time without any reporters or stalkers. They were now perfectly safe, with Harry's magical binding extending to whomever he wished for as long as they were close to him. So the Weasleys, and therefore Ginny, along with Hermione, Neville and Luna, would benefit to an extent.
The headline, however, shocked the confusion out of him, replacing it with an empty hollow feeling the pit of his stomach.
Harry drew in a breath and held it. And held it. And held it. Maybe if he passed out, he would wake up and learn this had all been a dream.
"You know this is somewhat flattering," he started, trying for a bored tone. "I never thought I'd ever be so important to anyone so as to be the center of their entire life, but…here we are."
"Sorry, Ernie," Harry shouted from where he was. "Business matters. Auror Stone needs you to sign this. There are three copies. Mind doing it now, and as quick as you can?"
"Merlin, so- so when Ginny joked once that Purebloods were shopping around for partners and basing it all on their assets-"
Was this his stalker, then? Draco immediately reviewed everything he, Potter and Weasley had gathered over the last few weeks. If this really was William Howe, he was definitely not what Draco had expected. At all.
"Yes, I already knew that," Malfoy gave him a patented smirk. "Goodnight then, Potter." The call faded.
"I cannot explain, but ever since those first few times when I was suspicious of your behavior... your bonds with Potter, and Granger and Weasley are what add to your vitality, your sense of contentment. You may not see it, but from an outsider's perspective, it is quite obvious that your exposure to them always has you in good spirits at the end of the day. And that is something that I wish you to have as much as possible."
They both ended up laughing at their pointless conversation. Finally Harry couldn't take it anymore.
He still had Malfoy's letter clutched in his hand. He had no idea why the blond's happiness had caused him to think of such painful thoughts, but he nevertheless reminded himself not to focus on the negative. Ginny was coming home in two weeks, and he couldn't wait until they could be with each other again. He felt like a piece of him had gone with her, and he ached for its return.
"Ron and I just had a few drinks after work, and we ran into him. This was last year. Turned out the pub was his, so he stayed with us for a bit until the person he had to meet arrived. That was pretty much it."
"Don't you run out though?" Harry asked. "I mean, I remember Astronomy with Professor Sinistra, and there are only a handful of star names that actually sound decent."
After he had filed for his formal request (which was the first of its kind in over two hundred years), he'd been asked to present his case to the assembled officials. Having just finished, Harry now nervously waited for his words to sink in, realizing he had no idea what kind of reactions to expect. Finally, when it seemed that every person had forgotten how to breathe, Kingsley Shacklebolt stood up and approached the brunet.
"Please," Harry insisted somewhat desperately, "do everything that you can... just... just keep them safe." He turned back to Ginny, shifting his hold on her so that he could embrace her. "Stay safe, Gin. I'll have to be away from you but you know I'll do anything to get to your side if need be."
"What is it, Potter?" Malfoy asked, with concern in his voice. "Is it really something that you can't tell me?" Harry knew that this was his Malfoy pride. He wasn't being nosy, or unnecessarily intrusive. He was obviously aware of something, and goodness knows how long ago he began to have such suspicions. But he hadn't tried to give a rise out of Harry, had he? He didn't try to force it out of him, or blackmail him, or sneak around. He was just, honest-to-goodness, pissed off that he was being kept out of something.
Draco and Astoria had demanded for a private ward, and were instantly granted the request. This guaranteed that their family was safe from the prying eyes of passersby. Of course, Astoria was sure that the birth would be published and highly talked about in the next few weeks, which was why Draco was insistent that they spend the first few days only with their immediate friends and family.
Draco wordlessly took the china from the brunet while trying to remember as much as he could from the previous night. As he closed his eyes, he could feel the stirrings of a mounting migraine, no doubt the result of his inebriation. When he gave an involuntary flinch at the pain in his temple, he heard Potter chuckle behind him though he couldn't see him.
he reflected, as he took a bite of his piece of cake and smiled in complete contentment, surrounded by his new circle of family and friends.
"Perhaps... I can't get over my surprise that you would actually invite me to cross into your Floo..."
"Chosen One's Fiancée Hiding Secret Pregnancy?" was printed in bold typeface. The letters seemed to shout at Harry, and he stood that way for several minutes, not even bothering to read the rest of the article. He was too numb at the moment.
Harry smiled and returned the same level of excitement. "That's right, they should come through within the hour, so you'd best get dressed up!"
"I don't. In any case, those of the Noble House of Black do not make fools of themselves in public," Narcissa amended with a smirk. She hugged her son tightly. "How is she?"
"Because the first day of the new year should be spent with the ones you love," Ginny said, making a good impression of Professor McGonagall.
Harry was settled on the floor, reading through several policy manuals that trainees were supposed to learn by heart. He sorely missed having Hermione's neat handwriting annotating his notes, and Ron's shameless scrawls, doodles and swearing on his books (Harry's, of course, Ron never did write in his own books).
and that is obviously beyond our magical capacity and standing. Draco is lucky that Potter had even included him under his magical bindings. Scorpius could be well protected by this, but we must find why it won't latch onto his magical core."
"I understand," Malfoy said sincerely. "Our family's history has been full of broken ties, and I had once thought it was impossible to bring the old Black family together."
"I will discuss this with Astoria," he promised his mother. "It is something that we can easily deal with. She is intelligent and understands much more than she lets on, including her wisdom when it comes to our marriage and how we play it out. After all, it was one of the reasons I wanted to marry her in the first place."
It was too early for daybreak, but Harry felt Ginny stirring beside him. He turned over to face her, draping his right arm over her slim form. She kissed him, soft sweet pecks that made him want to cuddle all day and never leave the bed.
Of course, it didn't escape his attention that she hadn't even tried to persuade him. She never did anymore, perhaps understanding his strong preference now to stay home rather than play the social butterfly game like they used to. He didn't think it was a matter of necessity anymore, and he honestly believed that his wife could effectively continue her role as international diplomat without him at her side all the time. He still managed his private consultancies and Potions Mastery, so it was back to the time when they both supported each other's ambitions. The only difference was that he had more flexible hours and she had to be at every event she organized.
"You alright?" Harry asked Ron when they reached the more private space. The redhead shook his head.
"Nah," he shook his head. "I love me a game of schoolyard Quidditch, fighting for the Cup, but it's not something I'd want to do for a career. I really want to-"
At that, Hermione beamed and motioned him to follow into the nursery, where Hugo, now a very healthy (and noisy) boy, was only just waking from his nap. "There's nothing much to help with, though I'm thankful for the company." In a bassinet, Draco could see the sleeping bundle that was Rose. He went up to her and tucked in a stray lock behind her tiny ear, rearranging the miniscule blanket around her.
The brunet blushed and took a nervous sip. "Er… I was just wondering, since you mentioned your dad… how is it that you don't think he's behind all the threats?"
Harry understood her silent "but", so he decided to bring it up to confirm his fears. "This was necessary because…?"
"Yes, yes," Draco replied with an exaggerated long-suffering sigh. "She knows my life is in peril, and understands what's at stake."
Draco started at his mother's retreating figure in disbelief. He was no longer a child, and yet he still felt the need to impress her, to show that he was worth the title of Lord Malfoy.
Hermione gave Ron an intense glare, and eventually he said,  “I suppose that it’s your house and you can invite Malfoy to stay for a bit if you want to.”
“I’m fine up here as long as you are,” Malfoy told him, “though if your girlfriend’s going to be round all the time, I’ll need your consent to reinforce the inbuilt silencing charms on the walls.”
He heard Draco exhale and pause for a second before walking towards the fireplace and muttering the charms to lift the wards and unlock the Floo.  “Ginevra, nice to see you!  Harry’s just popped to his room; he’ll be down in a second.”
Focus, he thought.  He tried to take an interest in the heated argument Draco was having with Hermione about house-elf living quarters.
“It’s a bit unusual for couples to talk about marriage when they’ve only been together for a month,” Draco tells me.  “At some point, maybe.”
Harry swallowed, feeling exposed, but managed to hold his gaze.  Clearly seeing whatever he was looking for, Draco hugged him tight, and with a familiar crack they Apparated into Harry’s bedroom.
“You could try and get Parkinson to publish something else,” Ron suggested.  “I can see it now: ‘Harry Potter admits he’s a total prick, blames the trauma of war.’  I bet her readers would lap that up.”
who tried to take a photograph through one of the front windows, was allegedly transfigured into a goat for her efforts. Ms Emmensworth declined to comment for this piece: rumour has it that she is still unable to complete a sentence without bleating.
Malfoy sighed dramatically and pinched the bridge of his nose.  “Potter.  Do you have any idea how many unbelievably wealthy and influential people have requested my services so far this evening?”
Harry’s brain started working again and he leaned down to fumble for his wand in the pile of clothes, relieved to find his glasses down there too, perfectly intact.  He cast a quick cleaning charm before flopping back onto the bed.  Draco curled against him, head on Harry’s shoulder, their legs tangled.
“You and that painting,” says Potter.  I for one am shocked at the dismissive tone he uses to refer to an artistic masterpiece, but Draco seems surprisingly tolerant, and is looking at Potter with uncharacteristic fondness.
Malfoy glared at him and tried to smooth his hair down, with little success, taking a large gulp of the coffee.  “I think what you mean is, ‘Good morning, Draco, I’m terribly sorry to bother you at this ungodly hour’.”
had a new story every week about Harry’s supposed conquests? He could only dream of having the energy to get through that many girls.
Malfoy smiled, though it didn’t quite reach his eyes.  “Oh, please.  I know you must feel terribly put upon by being dragged out at all sorts of events, but I’ve seen how many petits fours you’ve put away, and I also witnessed you, Weasley, and Zabini actually standing together and laughing.  Part of me does regret for your sake that this soiree is happening today, but you must admit that you’ve had fun.”
Harry thought about it, because he hadn’t before.  Then again, maybe that was because there wasn’t anything to think about.  “You’re
No sooner had they stepped into the - admittedly impressive - entrance hall than they were accosted by Draco Malfoy himself.
Best Dressed List: it has been masterfully Expanded and houses a number of exquisite designer dress robes (see p.23 for this week’s
Parkinson could have been citing almost anyone, he knew that.  Dozens of poor waiters and bar staff who’d overheard him and Ginny having awkward conversations; loads of their colleagues, and friends, and friends of friends, who saw how they were together, secondhand snippets overheard in the pub.  He couldn’t remember why he had been so sure it was Draco in the first place.
“The owner’s staring at us as if we’re a bunch of nutters, so I ask him about the emergency owl and he says he never sent one.  And then Ron and Terry come back round shouting that Harry’s walked up all cocky and everything - but got the wrong shop!
“We worked closely with the Malfoy family throughout the recent redevelopment of the Manor, and are pleased that the changes to the residence will enable us to provide living quarters, teaching spaces, gardens, and many other state-of-the-art facilities.
requested two full size dining tables this week, and it took me till eleven last night to get your samples ready.  And it’s a good thing I did too, since you’re here so bloody early.”
“Fat lot of good it does knowing that now, though,” Ron chimed in.  Harry was grateful that Ron was at least trying to conceal his glee that Harry and Draco had fallen out, but he’d still been spectacularly unhelpful when it came to suggestions about how to fix things.
His father, Lucius Malfoy, has been sentenced to eight years’ imprisonment in Azkaban for his role in the atrocities of the war; and his mother, Narcissa, received the lesser sentence of six months’ house arrest at Malfoy Manor, largely due to testimony in her favour from war hero Harry Potter.
Harry wasn’t entirely listening, but he gave himself a pass because Ginny had been saying the same thing in different ways since they’d sat down.  “I’m listening, Gin, but -”
,” she added, though the glance she shot at Harry indicated that she definitely did.  “Draco’s a simple person, really.  He craves attention, and he loves to be loved.  I’m sure you can come up with something.”
Ron sighed, picked up his drink, put it down again.  “You can’t just leave things well enough alone, can you? I thought you said you were grateful he’d been sentenced and you didn’t have to worry about what he was up to ever again.  But here you are writing to him, apparently often enough to go beyond pleasantries and into ‘snarky’ remarks.”
They were both breathing heavily with the intensity now, hips rocking together, and Harry needed more, needed to feel all of Draco’s skin against his own, some coherent part of him aware that coming in his pants like a teenager wasn’t exactly what he wanted for their first time together.
“All right then, Harry.  I’m considering accepting your apology… but first, I’m dying to know what’s in that package.”
“Yeah.”  Harry knew it was written all over his face. Everything he’d buried; everything he felt about Draco was right there in the open, and somehow, he wasn’t scared at all.  “Yeah, I do, actually.”
Her source witnessed a crew of house-elves Apparating in and out of the property, dumping crockery and other small items outside the gates. The next week, apparently, the source saw a bonfire that appeared to contain antique living and dining sets. The week after that, a crew of half-giants allegedly demolished the entire entrance hall and half of the east wing.
Then Draco reached down, too, and it was cramped and awkward and wonderful as they jerked each other; eyes fixed on one another, wrapped so tightly together that Harry couldn’t tell where he ended and Draco began, and suddenly it was all too much. He tried to tell Draco that he was coming but he couldn’t form words before his orgasm overtook him, but it was okay because Draco was crying out and shuddering against him, too, and he could feel them both shaking until the pleasure started to subside and reality crept back in around the edges of his awareness.
When his friends had had the chance to ooh and aah over the rather spectacular new dining table and chairs, Harry started to bring up the food from the kitchen.
was not given access to the third and fourth floors of the house, privately I knew Draco wouldn’t mind me having a quick look.  The master bedroom on the third floor is skillfully done: while the inviting queen-sized four-poster bed, clearly one of Draco’s iconic hand-crafted pieces, is the main feature of the room, my eye is immediately drawn to the way light from the large south-facing window creates a beautiful interplay with an intriguing piece of artwork on the wall, which appears to be an authentic Georgianna Moonstone.  It sits perfectly in the space, not dominating but drawing one’s eye: it’s almost disappointing to see it juxtaposed against the pale gold paint, though this contrast is by no means as incongruous as the burgundy armchair in the corner.  While the classic Phoenix Tear lamp floating above does help to create a very cosy reading area, I can’t help feeling that Draco may have let deference to his Gryffindor client override his normally unerring sense of colour in this instance.
Ron snickered. “I’m surprised it’s an unmarked door,” he said. “If someone told me to go to the Malfoy Wing, I’d immediately head for the toilets.”
“I can see that,” Ron said miserably, eying the arm Draco had draped around Harry’s shoulders with distrust.
“I know many pureblood families would shy away from destroying so much of historical value, and some auctioneers with whom I’ve been dealing have said as much – but unless you were present during the atrocities of the war, it is impossible to understand how much the Manor’s previously proud history has been irrevocably tainted,” Malfoy announced.  “I really wanted to tear the whole thing down, but its status as a Grade 4 listed building of magical heritage – as well as centuries-old warding spells – preclude that.  We know many members of the press and public are curious to see how much the Manor has changed, and so we will be inviting a select few to a Halloween Ball to commemorate the end of the Wizarding Wars and mark a new beginning, not only for the Manor but also for the Malfoy family.”
“Ron’s right,” Harry said, forlornly.  “Besides, what then?  I can’t just show up after what I said to him.”
Harry’s immediate instinct was to try and hide from the scrutiny, but there was nowhere to go, and it was reassuring and terrifying all at once to see Draco looking at him as if he were a three course meal, his eyes darting between Harry’s face and Harry’s dick, indecisive.
Harry remembered the first pub crawl: he’d been at the bar in The Thunderbird, trying to appear sober enough to order another round, when he’d looked at everyone and got a bit teary thinking how proud Dumbledore would have been of the inter-house unity. He’d said as much to Ron, who proposed a round of shots in Dumbledore’s honour, and it all got rather blurry from there.
Hermione frowned, clearly ready to say something about passing house-elves around like objects, but Draco headed her off.
Sirius’s pictures,” Harry said defensively.  “We’ve talked about that.  Photos of family and friends are much better than pointless artwork.”
Harry cleared his throat. “Can we talk about something else for a bit? I’m enjoying the break from seeing his name in the papers, so let's just have a Malfoy-free lunch, yeah?”
Thankfully Hermione intervened at that point.  “Well, moral questions aside; Padma, Parvarti, Lisa and I had lunch the other day and looked through some of the
“She does those paintings with the gemstones,” Hermione said, as if it would ring a bell. “They’re quite beautiful, really; her use of light sources is fascinating. There are a few in the magical gallery at the Tate Modern.”
Harry felt like an idiot.  Of course Malfoy wasn’t going to help him get rid of Doxys and pick out a decent sofa when he could be swanning round fancy ballrooms splashing other people’s cash on priceless antiques.
“Well, yeah, but ‘Mione helped me put something together to say, ‘thanks for writing, appreciate the sentiment, bye’.  She crossed out all my ferret references, too,” he added, mournfully. “But I didn’t get a penpal out of it.”
“I’m not insane, Ron.  And I haven’t asked him yet; I wanted to know what you thought first.  Not that I couldn’t have guessed.”
They actually smiled at each other for a second, and Harry felt calm for the first time in what seemed like ages.
“Shit, I want -” he began, and leaned down to kiss Harry’s lips, his neck, his chest, his belly - Harry absently felt relieved that he still kept up with his training exercises; how embarrassed would he be right now if he’d skipped all those crunches? - sucking and licking and biting so slowly and intently that Harry thought he was going to lose his mind before finally, with no warning, he took Harry’s dick into his mouth.
One must also ask, with the end of his year-long house arrest imminent, will Draco Malfoy and his mother be enjoying the fruits of their labour?  Or is Mr. Malfoy’s reference to the residence simply as ‘The Manor’ a sign of more change to come?
Harry took one step into the bedroom and tried to take it all in.  It was breathtaking, literally, and he found he had to force himself to exhale as he noticed detail after detail.  It would take a good few hours in here poking around and getting to know the place again before he’d really be able to appreciate everything, he knew that, but some touches jumped out at him. An artistic print of a snowy owl - maybe art wasn’t so bad, after all - framed pictures of his parents and friends, a carved stag standing proudly on a shelf, occasionally shaking its head to show off tiny yet ornate wooden antlers.
“I wasn’t… I mean, I just made the connection myself.  I know you’re not, I dunno, using your powers for evil these days.”  Harry winced inwardly.  He couldn’t trust himself to make conversation with anyone this early, let alone Malfoy.
“There’s a magical gallery at the Tate Modern?” Harry asked, feeling hopelessly uncultured.  In his defense, he hadn’t been there since a particularly terrible primary school trip, when one of Dudley’s friends had knocked over a very expensive vase in the gift shop and blamed it on Harry.  Uncle Vernon had gone through the roof when he saw the bill.
devoted readers, is the relationship between Draco and Potter.  In all the years I’ve known Draco, I’ve witnessed many conflicts between the two of them, and many of our mutual friends have confessed to me that they’re concerned about the unusual friendship.  “When the two of them are together, they bicker constantly,” one source told me.  “It’s exhausting really; feels like we’re still at school.”
“He’s been quite nice in the letters.  I mean, still... I dunno, snarky?” Harry shrugged. “But when it’s directed at other people he’s actually pretty funny.”
Today, representatives from St Mungo’s Hospital issued an official statement confirming that they have taken ownership of Malfoy Manor, to be used as a rehabilitation and hospice site for long-term patients.

have been dying to see inside Harry Potter’s London residence, formerly the home of the esteemed Black family.  At the end of last year, it underwent a complete renovation at the talented hands of Draco Malfoy, who even moved into the premises in order to fully oversee the project.
Harry could feel himself blushing, and Draco sighed with exasperation, but then smirked at Harry as if in challenge.   Harry felt himself grinning back, wondering if he was really going to start snogging Draco Malfoy in the middle of the world’s worst beer-garden.  When their lips met, it was to a chorus of shrieks and catcalls from their friends, and Harry didn’t care one bit.
“That is a bit of a shame,” Draco confesses, “because the fourth floor was looking wonderful.  There is far better light for the Moonstone downstairs, though.  Since Pansy’s already been nosing around, I suppose we can allow some photographs now.”  (See next page for our unique peek into Harry Potter’s bedroom - you’re welcome, readers!)
Harry paused his perusal of the room for a moment to look at Draco.  He was talking more than usual, clearly nervous.  Harry almost laughed - there was no way he wouldn’t love the place, but it was sort of funny to see Draco so anxious, and he thought he’d leave it another minute or so before he allayed Draco’s worries.  He was also far from annoyed about the Dreamless Sleep: his nightmares had been news since he was a teenager and he was hardly going to make a fuss about something that could actually help.
Malfoy laughed, and it actually sounded genuine.  “I’ve been saying for years you’d have been an excellent Slytherin.  Go on, then, what’s this favour?”
“That’s rubbish and you know it.  You just don’t want to commit to me.  You’re scared of marriage and kids and being a grown-up, but you don’t see that it’s another adventure for us to go on together.”
“Well, yeah, but we’re talking about the world’s biggest drama queen – this is part of some plan to get himself back in the news. He’s probably Parkinson’s mystery source, too.”
To be honest, Harry did think it was beautiful.  The colours were rich and vibrant, but it had enough open areas to balance the intensity.  The artist’s signature moonstone-infused pigments seemed at first glance as if they’d been splattered on at random, but when you looked from different angles the areas where they glowed softly were clearly careful and deliberate, to create real depth.
“Oh, forgive me, am I inconveniencing you?  Has this been more or less torturous than the time you thought I’d sold you out to the papers?”
Before the two of them could descend into a petty argument, Hermione said, “It’s fine, really, Harry, it’ll be nice to have you back for a bit.  I’ve got a big presentation due for the Centaur Collaboration Committee on Friday so won’t be around much I’m afraid, but at least Ron will have some company.  You might have to battle with Crookshanks though; he’s adopted your old room and you know how he is.”
Harry cracked up at his spot-on rendition of Ron, who had refused to come and look at it for the ‘millionth time’, and even told Hermione, “If you love me you’ll keep me company down here: I’m starting to think you and Malfoy are going to run off together and move into some poncy art gallery.”
Harry was so angry he decided to come in through the front door rather than the Floo, just so he could slam the door behind him as hard as possible.  If it cracked Draco Malfoy’s immaculate paint job then that would be an added bonus.  He stomped up to the drawing room and threw the copy of
“I used cherrywood as the main material,” Draco continued.  “It represents good fortune and new beginnings, which seemed appropriate.  The oil finish on the bed-frame contains a trace amount of concentrated Dreamless Sleep Potion - I first tried it in my own room at the Manor, when the war had just ended.  It’s just enough that it makes you feel rested when you settle down for the night.  It should be especially effective in a bed that big, particularly a four poster; like a cocoon, I suppose.  I hope that wasn’t taking liberties: I noticed your potions in the bathroom and thought this would be an elegant way to meet your needs.”
P.S. If you want to escape the brocade, I’m going to the Leaky after work with Ron and the rest of our team as well as Hermione, Luna and their lot - you should come down.  Lisa might be there too; I know you two love getting drunk and judging people’s outfits.
There had been silence for a while after that.  Harry knew, because some deep - and incredibly annoying - instinct made him scan the papers for any mention of Malfoy now that he was back on the radar.
“By all means,” said Draco, muttering some incantations over the box.  “So you don’t break them,” he explained in response to Harry’s quizzical look.  “I should have a couple of chairs for you to test out by Thursday or so - but if you show up at this time again, I can’t promise not to embed stinging curses into the seats.”
“What about you?” Harry asked.  “Are you seeing anyone?”  He couldn’t picture Malfoy bringing any snooty pureblood girls back here, not until the place was completely finished, but he didn’t relish the idea of trying to eat his breakfast while Pansy Parkinson sat across the table passing judgement.
Ginny didn’t reply, just grabbed her bag and stood up.  She paused, as if she wanted to say something, but in the end just squeezed his hand, hard, and was gone.
“Some might argue that replacing the antique tables in your house is a pretty unforgivable sin,” Malfoy said eventually.
“I know that with my job too it’s a bit trickier, but I’ve been feeling loads better about the future - Harry, are you listening?”
“Come to think of it, I actually owe you a life debt.  I personally didn’t think interior design would cut it by way of repayment, but when you put it like that…”
“This is what I get for trying to be nice,” Draco complained.  “Maybe I should go back to being a total prat to you.”  His voice changed to the sneer Harry remembered from school.  “Of course I love myself, Potter; what’s not to love?  I have a marvellous job, excellent bone structure, two living parents, and a bigger penis than you.”
Harry nodded, and went to sit down.  He’d never seen Malfoy really working before. Well, he’d been involved in the design plans for Grimmauld Place of course: consultations, unnecessarily complicated ‘mood boards’, fabric samples, all of that; but it was different from seeing the man actually breaking a sweat.  Manual work was far removed from his image of the aristocratic Draco Malfoy, and therefore rather unsettling, but oddly mesmerising.  Every movement was careful and deliberate, but clearly well-practised, and Harry was really bloody impressed to see the bits of wood transforming into actual furniture - beautiful furniture, at that.
, Potter.  I can Floo straight into the house - as uncomfortable as it is over that distance - because I’m keyed into the wards, but there’s no fireplace here, and by the time I was finished last night the public Floos were shut and I didn’t have the energy to deal with the International Portkey Bureau.”
Well, that was… interesting.  Harry hoped his face didn’t show how thrown he was, though when he took a second it did make a lot of sense, actually.  “Well, if  you do decide to, y’know, bring anyone back here, that would be okay,” he said lamely. “I mean, it’s your home too, now, I guess, and it’s none of my business, obviously, if that’s what you want to do.”
Harry couldn’t curb his instincts when faced with the cold, aloof version of Malfoy he used to despise so much, and snapped, “Why do you think I’m here, you idiot?”
Harry thought he knew all there was to know about Draco, so it was exhilarating to learn that kissing the side of his neck made him inhale sharply, and that biting his ear elicited this choked-off gasping noise, which may have been Harry’s new favourite sound in the world.  Even though – or perhaps, precisely because - they had spent years trading slurs and insults, there was something especially thrilling about Draco’s familiar cut-glass accent muttering swear words under the onslaught of pleasure.
“It seems to me that Pansy must really want that promotion.  It’s nasty stuff, but I don’t know what you expect at this point.  She’s probably still mad that you won’t let her into the house.”
“You should probably open it inside,” Harry added quickly.  “It’s under environmental stabilising charms but that might be safest.  That’s why I couldn’t shrink it.”
“I could have gone to Sunday lunch at the Zabinis’ today,” Draco announced with a long suffering sigh. “They appreciate me.”  But he poured them all another glass of wine, anyway.
Harry nodded mutely, idly wondering how much wider Draco’s eyes could get before they popped out of his head, like in the cartoons Dudley used to watch on a Sunday morning.
“Well, that’s okay, I suppose,” Hermoine conceded, still looking slightly troubled.  Harry did notice her taking a second helping of the lamb, though.
“I know Hogwarts was your first real home, so I tried to keep elements of that in here, but I’m physically incapable of throwing around gaudy Gryffindor colours, I’m afraid.”
Hours could have passed for all Harry knew as they stayed locked together, sometimes taking a moment to stare at each other in affirmation, but mostly just kissing each other as if it were as essential as breathing, trying to get as close as possible. Harry felt that maybe, if they did this long enough, it would somehow make up for all the time they’d lost by pretending this heat, this tension between them wasn’t there.
Draco started laughing and Harry looked at him, confused.  “‘Getting your head round it’ was one of my many exciting bedroom plans,” he clarified with a smirk.
“Of course there is, Harry,” Hermione replied.  “It’s through that unmarked door in the Turbine Hall, you know.”
Malfoy gritted his teeth and turned to Hermione instead.  “Granger, I know it must be especially difficult for you to be here,” he told her seriously. “I very much appreciate your coming.”
Harry winced. “At least that’d help me stay awake.”  When he got to the door, he turned round.  “My chairs aren’t that urgent, you know.  Try and get some rest.”  He didn’t need to look back to know that Malfoy was totally ignoring him.
“Was it his conscience, or was he just bored and splashing around his dad’s cash?” Ron wondered aloud.
“Exactly,” Harry said, “and he’s already round a couple of nights a week - mostly he takes Regulus’s old room, which I don’t use anyway.  Says it’s the only bedroom that ‘retains some level of taste’.”
He recognised the look Ron and Hermione exchanged from his Sixth Year at Hogwarts, and he didn’t like it.
team, have been not-so-secretly hoping that the couple are once again heading towards their happily ever after.
“Draco’s right,” Harry agreed.  “In fact, I’m tempted to send an owl to Pansy Parkinson right now and invite her to do that Grimmauld Place special edition, solely in honour of this painting.  Maybe
They both laughed, and Harry felt it was slightly easier to breathe. He knew his smile matched Draco’s as they stood together in silence, surveying the heart of what had, in Harry’s mind, finally become his home.
“Come on, Ron, you must admit that it was at least partly your fault.  Anyway, I spelled them all together again, didn’t I?  You’d never guess they’d been torn.”
“You’re the one who keeps going on about how magical houses have their own personalities, and Grimmauld Place definitely misses you.  The plumbing’s been awful, and there’s dust on the doorframes that just won’t budge.”  He started to count the list on his fingers.  “The sofa cushions keep deflating themselves so I can never get comfortable, the fires are constantly dying out for no reason, the kettle’s started whistling Celestina Warbeck songs when it’s not even on the boil; even the Dreamless Sleep stuff on the bed frame isn’t working any more.”
“Correction: the kind of thing I’d have done six bloody years ago! I thought we were past all this childish nonsense; I didn’t realise I still had to work every day to prove myself worthy of the great Harry Potter’s trust.  I’m your friend, for Merlin’s sake!  Not to mention that you’re providing the roof over my head.  What possible motive could I have to make up some hateful story and try to sell you out? I don’t even know Ginevra; we barely make small talk when she comes to visit you.”
Harry laughed, relieved and surprised.  “Almost as bad as the Auror department making me come in for seven in the morning.”  He checked the time again, and stood up to gather his things as the Tempus charm reminded him that he had to be at work in eight minutes.  “Can I take these with me?” he asked, picking up the box of tables.
Harry could practically see the effort Draco put into holding back from saying more, and gave him a broad smile.  “See, you’re not always right.  Do you want to order something to eat while I get changed?”
Today, the youngest Malfoy also received a sentence of house arrest, in his case for twelve months.  Many expected Draco to be sent to Azkaban, following reports that he was instrumental in aiding You-Know-Who in his efforts to invade Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in 1997, as well as participating in the torture of prisoners at his family home.
Harry caught Draco’s eye and grinned, but for some reason Draco’s smile didn’t quite reach his eyes, and he looked away first.  “What can I say? This house adores me.  I’ve certainly changed things for the better round here."
“Actually, he’s invited quite a few people from school,” Hermione interjected.  “I must admit, I’m not dying to go back to that place – but I’m also incredibly curious to see how it’s changed.  Not to mention how much Malfoy’s changed.  We all received his apology letters; I think it’ll be good to show that we support him if he’s trying to start afresh.”
“Draco.  You’re being... weirdly nice, and I appreciate that after the night I’ve had, but right now I need you to shut up and come to bed with me.”
Harry knew he was still blushing, and was thankful that Draco had decided to punctuate his instruction with kisses against Harry’s collarbone rather than looking him in the eye.  Somewhere between the thought of doing
Draco had got rid of the gas lamps, denouncing them as ‘more trouble than they’re worth’.  He’d refused to deal with the Muggle power companies, and somehow found a legal way to dismantle and banish all the gas pipes throughout the house, replacing the lights with magical sconces that came on with a warm glow when you walked in and got brighter or dimmer with a wave of your wand.
“You should be relieved, mate,” Ron remarked, “the rate things are going, I expected him to stab his mum with a goblin-silver butter knife and have her body hauled out by werewolf day-labourers.”
“We should get down there,” Draco continued, louder.  “I don’t think Weasley will forgive me if the food gets cold while we’re up here ‘making googly eyes at that sodding painting again’.”
Since its completion, neither Draco nor Potter have been willing to allow the press to see inside the house: Amelia Emmensworth, a former reporter for
The press release stated: “St Mungo’s Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries is delighted to announce that the Malfoy family has donated their estate in Wiltshire for us to use as a residential facility.
Malfoy laughed, with a slight air of bitterness.  “It’s pretty difficult to establish any kind of meaningful relationship when you’re under house arrest.  I’ve had a few… encounters since my release, but no one I’ve wanted to bring home.  Mother’s understanding in theory, but I don’t think she’s quite ready for me to start turning up with strange men.”
Hermione looked torn between defending her friend or the house-elves, and Harry thought it would be best to move things on before she could make up her mind.  “No problem, really. It’s actually good to see you.”  He was surprised to find that he meant it.
Malfoy shuddered.  “You know full well that I retracted that statement the moment I laid eyes on the place.  No one should be sleeping in the master until I’ve had an army of house-elves in to do a deep clean, and I’m still stuck on the first-floor bathroom right now.”
“But it’s not the same.  All the photos are ruined now; the players won’t fly properly where the paper was ripped.”
“Astute, Potter.  I see why the DMLE hired you.”  Malfoy sounded exhausted, and looked it, too.  His hair was falling out of its usually immaculate ponytail, and his shirt was still rumpled and open at the collar.  He had his wand in one hand and some kind of tool in the other - what it was for, Harry could only guess, but probably something to do with the half-made chair hovering above the workbench.  “Will you let me finish before you insist on continuing this morning’s interrogation?”
Draco laughed, slightly unpleasantly.  “Oh, no, I wouldn’t put you in that position.  Unlike Ginevra, I won’t take it personally if you have a… scheduling conflict.”  He pointed his wand at the half-full wine bottle, floating it along in front of him, and headed out of the kitchen, stopping in front of Harry.  He put his hand on Harry’s shoulder for a moment.  “I’ll be here when you get back, if you decide you’re finally ready to have an honest talk with someone about all this.  I’ll even try not to say I told you so.”
So far she seems to have been unsuccessful, but as we know from her status as the youngest Chaser ever to make the Holyhead Harpies’ first team, not to mention her contribution to the Battle of Hogwarts, Ginny Weasley is tenacious.  Keep reading
Harry stared at her.  “Gin, I’ve spent most of my life living what was mapped out for me, and it didn’t make me happy, a lot of the time.  You and I were best together together when we were friends, and I reckon if we carry on like this, we won’t even be able to salvage that much.”
Pansy’s trying to get a promotion at work and says the ‘only way’ is if you let her do an exclusive look at Grimmauld Place.  Apparently everyone wants to see inside your house - she tried selling it to me on the grounds that it’ll drive up my business, but I’m swimming in clients and it’s your home.  What do you think?
Harry, feeling slightly off-balance for some reason that probably wasn’t to do with the Nargles, stayed back for a moment to carefully close the door to Draco’s room.  It was weird, really, how easily he’d switched to thinking of it as Draco’s.  He’d been so worried about moving into what had been Sirius’s room, even more so about letting Draco live just across the hall in Regulus’s, but he could barely recall that anxiety now.  Sometimes he would open a door in the house and see a flash in his mind’s eye of what it used to be like, but all that did was make him more amazed at how seamlessly the dark, musty inheritance he’d never wanted had become his favourite place in the world.
Draco sighed dramatically.  “Have I become so predictable in my old age?  Fine, Chinese it is.  Let me Apparate us; you’ve had more to drink than I have.  You know, because of the shame and embarrassment.”
Draco was smiling, with a slight air of smugness: Harry wasn’t sure whether it was because he’d got the disastrous design briefing dead-on or because the room had turned out brilliantly.
When they eventually broke apart,  there was a kind of awe on Draco’s face and Harry knew his expression was the same.
Ron seemed horrified at the fact that Harry and Malfoy were having a relatively friendly exchange: he was looking from one to the other as if they were a couple of giant spiders playing tennis.
“So what?  We’re friends, and it was funny.  Besides, if you want to talk about being famous; the main reason
and the sensation of Draco’s lips and teeth and tongue across his chest, Harry was starting to get turned on again. He gently tugged on Draco’s hair, drawing him up for a proper kiss. Draco made a small, incredibly hot moaning noise in the back of his throat, so Harry pulled his hair again, lightly, and was delighted to elicit the same response.
Luna stopped and looked between Harry and Draco. “It’s good that you two are together again.  When it was only Harry here, the energy wasn’t right, and it’s not just because of all the Nargles you’ve got in the plants downstairs.”
As I move on, I am even more surprised at the second room on this floor. Perhaps it is intended to be an office of some kind, but even so it’s unexpectedly Spartan.  Like the bedroom downstairs, its walls are gold, and its furnishings are all handcrafted in luxurious hardwoods, bringing an air of maturity to Potter’s own design sensibilities.  These are limited, however, to a chest of drawers, a bookshelf, and a desk, above which are numerous pictures of Potter’s friends and family.  My intention to peruse Potter’s reading material is sadly cut short by the menacing movements of a wooden stag figurine, which appears to be patrolling the shelves.
“I’m sorry.  I can stay, if you want?  She’s made reservations, but I can tell her I had plans already.”
I am admittedly impressed that this piece was selected by Potter. It seems he does have some good taste after all, and it clearly goes beyond art: I’m sure our readers will agree that he has excellent taste in men, too!
“Do you really think that because Pansy was all over me when we were fourteen my loyalty is going to be with her?  After all the time I’ve spent complaining about how much she’s tried to exploit our friendship?”
Their kisses were sloppier now, hot and intense and messy, sometimes more like breathing the same air than actually snogging as they rocked against one another, the friction of their dicks pressing together at the centre of Harry’s awareness.
Harry was exhausted by the time they finished levitating all of Malfoy’s stuff up to the fourth floor - he’d said he’d left most of his things at his mum’s, but it seemed to Harry as if they’d been traipsing up and down the stairs for hours.  He’d counted four boxes labelled ‘Haircare’ too, which seemed totally unnecessary.
P.S. Since interior design, though still a fledgling business, has become a rather lucrative endeavour already, I suggest you rethink your remarks about my not working every day.
“Weasley,” Draco interjected, thankfully sounding amused rather than insulted, “I’m sitting right here.”
“Well, there’s the first fashion victim of the night.  What on earth happened to you?”  Draco stood at the end of the table, one eyebrow raised at Harry’s oversized DMLE t-shirt and undersized athletic shorts.
Pansy Parkinson, attempting to reinvent herself by writing freelance gossip columns while living out her own house arrest, reported that items from Malfoy Manor had started to show up in auction houses across the country, and even in some of the more reputable establishments in Knockturn Alley.  The Greengrass family purchased a handcrafted self-playing piano at great expense, Pansy claimed, in hopes of securing a marriage between their youngest daughter and Draco Malfoy.  It shocked much of pureblood society to hear that they’d been turned down flat, but at least the Malfoys threw in a triptych of priceless tapestries woven from Demiguise hair to soften the blow.
To his surprise, Draco stopped in mid-sentence and turned to look at Harry, raising an eyebrow in question.
“‘I want it to be like Gryffindor Tower,’” he said in an unerring impression of Harry. “Warm, cosy, you know?  With, uh, pictures of my friends, and my parents.  I haven’t really thought much about it beyond that, sorry’.”
, Rita Skeeter goes into great detail about you and Granger engaging in trysts on the drawing room settee while Weasley slept in a nearby armchair. Naturally, I assume every word is true.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Honestly, Ron, it was all being blown up out of proportion. If you were locked up in a house where you’d witnessed people being tortured, wouldn’t you want to clear it out a bit? I think it’s a perfectly reasonable reaction to trauma.”
“You killed the most evil wizard of our time; you can manage an apology to Draco Malfoy,” he told himself sternly, and, after only another couple of minutes’ hesitation, he walked up to the door and knocked firmly.
