"It's true," Draco piped up. "He was certainly harsh on the other Gryffindors, but it was nothing compared to how he treated Harry."
When time for Potions rolled around, Harry and Ron were extra careful to be on time, too scared to find out what would happen if they weren’t. They arrived, and Harry saw Draco sitting as far away as possible from Crabbe and Goyle, alone. He heard Ron sigh as Harry made his way over to the blonde, but he ignored him.
"Why o' course it is! The more the merrier! Why don't you boys sit down and get cozy while I get the snacks!"
“What do we have today?” Harry asked Ron as they ate their porridge.
“You reckon Draco will be there?” Harry asked.
Harry wound up with Seamus Finnigan, which wasn’t horrible, they got along well enough and he doubted Seamus would catch anything on fire. Ron on the other hand was trapped with queen stuck-up-know-it-all herself: Hermione Granger. Neither of them looked happy about the arrangement.
"Was it about the troll?" Ron asked.
“Cheer up,” said Ron. “He takes points from Fred and George all the time.”
Like the other professors, he went down the registrar. Like the other professors, he paused at Harry's name.
“Come on.” He wrapped his arm Draco’s shoulder and guided him along. “Hagrid is one of the nicest people you’ll ever meet, you’ll see.” So the three of them walked together to the hut on the edge of a forest. And even though Draco was anxious the entire way there, Harry felt good about steering him in the right direction.
“I think Transfiguration is interesting, Charms as well. But I’m most excited for this class. I’ve been playing with toy cauldron sets ever since I was little, so I hope I’ll be good.”
“Correct. But let me warn you, Potter, cheating will not be tolerated in this classroom. Mr Malfoy will not be able to save you every time you do not know the answer. One point from Gryffindor. Moving on.” Harry’s entire body slumped into his chair. He was relieved to be released from the intense scrutiny, but upset for already losing a point.
“I saw you hide with the Hufflepuffs and I got suspicious, so I ran off when no one was looking to see what you were up to. Looks like I was right to do so. I have no idea what you’re doing, but whatever it is, it’s downright stupid with a troll wandering the castle.”
“Hold on, do you smell that? It’s absolutely foul,” Draco said, pinching his nose. Harry sniffed the air, catching a whiff of what smelled like Uncle Vernon’s socks and Fang’s farts. And then they heard it, a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet. Ron pointed to the end of the passage to the left. Something huge was moving towards them.
To be honest, despite the Jack-o-lantern between the three of them, and Ron's breakfast of sweets, it still felt like a completely normal day. Maybe it was because living in Hogwarts was like living an eternal Halloween, so actual Halloween wasn't special anymore.
“Why does Snape hate me so much? I’ve never even met him before,” Harry complained as class let out.
“So, she must’ve noticed she’s got no friends.” Ron said, although Harry could see remorse in his eyes.
"Oh, um, thank you Hagrid," Harry said, looking at the rock-cakes with dread, knowing he would have to eat one.
"Well whether he's taken a special dislike to Harry or not, he ain't the best role model at Hogwarts, that I believe. I know he's head of Slytherin and close ter yer family, but I hope ye keep that in mind Mr Malfoy." Hagrid then cleared his throat and turned to Ron. "How's yer brother Charlie? I liked him a lot—great with animals."
“Hello, Draco,” Harry greeted in a friendly tone.
"But he really seemed to
"Ain't no problem. Now tell me boys, how are yer classes?"
“Hey ugly! Over here!” Harry cried, but that turned out to be a mistake. The troll, overwhelmed and overstimulated, roared with fury and charged at Ron, who was nearest and had no way to escape. Ron was mere seconds away from his doom, and Harry scrambled for any plan to save him, he even considered jumping onto the troll's back.
“No! I’m not going anywhere near that thing!” Draco said nasally, still pinching his nostrils.
“Goat!” Harry blurted. Snape’s sneer deepened and his glower darkened.
"Yeah, but I don’t see what that has to do with anything."
They dashed inside to find Hermione Granger shrinking against the wall opposite to them, clutching her robes so tight her knuckles were white. The troll was advancing on her, knocking the sinks off the wall as it went.
“I’m sorry. Mind if I sit here?” He asked without thinking. Ron slapped him on the shoulder with a book.
"It was," Harry said. "Hagrid and I also visited Gringotts that day! It might've been happening while we were there!"
After hearing this, Ron looked to Harry with immense guilt written on his face. Then he looked across the room to the Slytherin table, where Draco sat between Pansy Parkison and another Slytherin girl, absolutely miserable.
“Hermione!” They both said in unison.
As they neared the bathroom, the sound of quick footsteps echoed down the corridor behind them. The two boys ducked behind a griffin statue, Harry thought it might be a prefect or a professor who had caught them leaving with the wrong group and had come to punish them. He peaked to see whoever it was, and his stomach dropped when he saw Snape, the worst professor to have found them. But he didn’t find them. He crossed to another hall and disappeared.
Ron took this window of opportunity to grab his own wand, but he didn’t quite know what he was going to do with it. He heard himself cry the first spell that came to mind.
"We shoulda gotten more than ten points," Ron grumbled.
They crossed the room, and before they even said a word to Draco, Harry could feel the Slytherin Prefects glaring them down.
"Five you mean, once she's subtracted Hermione's," Harry reminded him.
“You’re saying it wrong!” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It’s
“I think she heard you,” he whispered to Ron.
"That might've been too far, Ron," Harry said, giving him a stern look.
“Be careful,” Ron told Draco before they began walking away.
“Until it breaks the door down. Let’s get out of here!” Draco insisted, grabbing their sleeves and pulling them down the hall. But as they reached the corner, they heard something that made their hearts stop. A high, petrified, scream, and it was coming from the room they’d just chained up.
“Hold on,” Harry said, stopping halfway to their table. “Hermione doesn’t know about the troll. Who’s going to tell her?” He looked at Ron with raised eyebrows, knowing they were both thinking the same thing.
"Ah yes," he said. "Harry Potter. Our new...celebrity." Heat burned in Harry's cheeks, he kept his head down and said nothing. After staring Harry down with cold, dark eyes, Snape went on a long spiel about potions, bottling fame, and calling them dunderheads. To say the least, it took Harry no time to decide Snape was his least favorite teacher he’d met that week. It got even worse, when at the end of his introduction speech, he continued to single out Harry in front of the entire class.
“Well your father isn’t here, is he?” Ron replied.
“Shut your mouth Pansy, no one asked you,” snapped Draco before addressing Ron. “I forgive you. I’ve been thinking about what you said, and in a way, it was-”
Draco shrugged sheepishly. “I suppose not.”
“Hmpf. Clearly fame isn’t everything.” Harry expected him to move on, but he didn’t. “Let’s try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you to find me a bezoar?” Hermione’s hand stretched further into the air, but Harry was still at a loss.
The feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads.
“You’re on a roll today Ron,” Harry said. Ron pretended he hadn’t heard him. After that, they didn’t see Hermione in class for the rest of the day, which was highly unusual for the girl.
Once he finished preening himself, Draco turned around and extended a hand to Hermione. “Thanks,” she said as he pulled her up. “I’m glad I’m not the only one here who read ahead in our Charms book.”
They inched together, so close that Harry could smell whatever fancy shampoo Draco used, and did the best they could to shrink into the shadows. It emerged into a patch of moonlight, it was a horrible sight: twelve feet tall, its skin a dull granite gray, its great bulky body like a boulder, with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut. It had short legs thick as tree trunks, with flat horny feet. It held a large wooden club, which dragged along the floor with a grating scraping sound.
"A break in at Gringotts on July thirty first?" Draco said aloud after reading the paper alongside Harry. "Wasn't that the day we were both in Diagon Alley?"
A sudden slamming and loud footsteps made the three of them look up. They hadn’t realized what a racket they had been making, but of course someone downstairs must have heard the crashes and the troll’s roars. A moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting into the room, closely followed by Snape with Quirrell bringing up the rear. Quirrell took one look at the troll, let out a faint whimper and sat down on a toilet. Snape began to examine the troll.
“Where am I going to sit?!” Ron exclaimed.
There was no doubt, Hagrid certainly did not meet his eyes this time. He grunted and offered them another rock-cake, which they both politely declined. In the article, it said that the vault searched had been emptied that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen. It was unlikely, but Harry's mind wandered with possibilities. Had that been what the thieves were looking for?
“We’ll do it then. You wait here,” Harry said, being the first to creep ahead. Ron began to follow.
"Forget the points," Draco said. "When my parents hear about this, they'll kill me!"
“It’s the girls bathroom,” Harry gasped.
"I don't think so. The three of us have got on so far, so I figured I'd invite them along. Is that alright?"
“Y-you stay with Ron to distract the troll, I’ll get her out of here,” Draco said. He used Ron’s brief distraction to scurry past the troll. Whatever he said to her, Harry didn’t catch on account of focusing back on the great big monster. But he could tell it wasn’t working, as Hermione stayed plastered against the wall.
"No! You guys have been better friends to me in two months than Crabbe and Goyle were for eleven years. My father isn't right about everything," Draco said, glancing at Ron. "Especially not the things that matter."
"This is Ron and Draco."
Two days later at breakfast, the three of them were eating some sausage and toast when Draco plopped down beside Hermione and buried his face in his arms.
They hurried out of the chamber and didn't speak at all until they were two turns away.
“No worries. Thanks for trying, though.”
Draco glowered at Ron, and without a word, picked up his breakfast and stormed back to the Slytherin table. Harry heard the slam of his plate against the table from across the Great Hall.
“We’ll be gone in a minute, but this is
“I mean, yeah, he’s a Slytherin isn’t he? But I’m telling you Harry, I’m not sure if it’s a good idea to go making friends with a Malfoy.”
Madam Pomfrey hovering over him every two seconds, fading in and out of sleep, the most exciting feast of the entire year, and the return of their marks, falling asleep in a near empty dormitory felt surreal. Like he knew in the morning he would be losing a part of him.
“You do it then if you’re so clever!” Ron snarled.
"Yer welcome Mr Malfoy. I hope to see ya back here, Ron and Harry as well." Hagrid shut the door, and they began to make their way to the castle, stomachs rumbling.
Draco hesitated with his answer. “I don’t know, my father says I shouldn’t hang around nonhumans.”
“They were looking for me,” Hermione said from the far back of the room.
Harry and Draco exchanged suspicious eye contact, Draco didn't have to talk for Harry to know they were both wondering if he'd changed the subject on purpose. As Ron told Hagrid all about Charlie's work with dragons, Harry noticed a scrap of paper under the tea cozy. Curious, he picked it up and found that it was a cutting from the
"Mine too, especially my mum," Ron agreed with a nod. "It was good of Hermione to get us out of trouble like that. Mind you, we did save her."
“Hermione, I -“ Draco starts to explain but Hermione cuts him off.
“Harry dear! Oh I’m so glad you came,” Molly exclaims, stepping around Draco to pull Harry into a hug. Draco can’t help but watch as Harry’s tense shoulders relax and the furrow between his brows disappears as his surrogate mother hugs him tightly.
, Harry.”
, this is happiness Draco thinks, turning in Harry’s embrace and bringing their mouths together.
Still, Harry can't help but bounce around, checking and rechecking things as he waits for Draco, the ten minutes seeming to stretch on for hours. But then the door creaks open and a blonde head appears. Harry’s heart is in serious danger of breaking free from his chest and his hands shake as he watches Draco take in everything with wide eyes.
As always, Harry takes the lead when Draco can’t. “Draco, what—what are you doing here?”
The week passes quickly and without incident. Draco doesn’t see Harry again and he feels more comfortable than he thought possible at Ron and Hermione’s house.
Draco stares at his father, completely blindsided by this reaction. Really though, he should have expected his father to think that he was using Potter, playing a game in which he had the advantage.
“How did this happen?” Narcissa had demanded.
Still, the point is this was a terrible idea.
Things have been tense, the Prophet article still hanging heavy over both their heads. Draco has been staying holed up in the Manor, fidgety and his tone clipped when Harry stops by.
Draco’s eyes shift around nervously as he makes his way through the International Portkey terminal in London the next morning. He’s just waiting for someone to recognize him and start throwing hexes at his back. But when he walks out into Muggle London without so much as a glare directed at him, he allows himself to calm down just a little bit. Maybe five years away has done some good for his image here.
Does Harry really expect Draco to get on one of these Muggle contraptions? The screaming people with their hands raised above their heads look to be enjoying themselves but that doesn’t seem right.
For now, he’ll do his best to live in the moment and—
Draco feels a cleaning charm wash over him and the sheets a moment later. He’s content to just lay there and never move again but Harry maneuvers theirs bodies, pulling Draco against his chest tightly, their legs tangled together.
I have had a blast writing this and I can’t believe it’s over!! Many, many thanks to everyone who subscribed, commented, or left kudos <3 I appreciate it more than you know!
“You’re a spoiled brat,” Harry says, equal parts fond and exasperated, “You’ll get it later, don’t worry.”
“Alright,” Draco agrees with a nod, “that would be wonderful actually.”
“Lies!” Potter says with a laugh, “How is this any worse than when you made me name a Hogwarts professor I’d have sex with?”
“Sorry,” Draco whispers, pulling his hand away, “I didn’t mean to wake you.”
“Hmm?” Draco hums, tearing his eyes away from the sky and turning to face Harry.
Harry pulls at his hair in frustration. “I want to know what the hell is going on!”
Harry can hear Draco’s smug grin as he replies, “Thought so.”
Hermione laughs, “It’s true Harry. Honestly, I could have told you that you were bisexual in fourth year. You can be really slow on the uptake sometimes.”
“Rethinking your ‘dates are stupid’ opinion are you?” Harry quips with a grin, seeming unable to help himself and leaning close for a kiss, in sight of everyone milling along the street.
He startles when Hermione suddenly appears in front of him.
Going to the movies seems very date-like to Draco but with the kids there it might be alright. And Scorpius has never been to a Muggle movie theater before, Draco’s sure he’ll love it.
Harry stays for breakfast, but after the table is cleared he says he needs to get home. Ron and Hermione send him off with hugs and kind words, and Harry doesn’t know what he did to deserve such amazing friends.
Harry takes a sip and savors the way the drink warms his belly. The vanilla is good, and Harry has to admit that part of what makes it so good, is the memory of the way it smells on Malfoy’s breath.
Draco steps back a little and wipes his sticky hand on his shirt, too dazed to even consider casting a cleaning charm.
“So I didn’t stop over just to mooch dinner from you,” Ron sits his spoon in his empty bowl and gives Harry an expectant look.
Draco makes a strangled noise and comes, and Harry feels it, feels Draco’s cock pulse, feels the hot splash inside him. He tries to commit every single sensation to memory. The heat, the slickness, the punched out noises Draco makes and the perfect curve of his back as he arches up off the bed.
“Draco, gonna come, fuck,” Harry warns.
Harry continues to smile, even as he watches Albus drag a finger through the extra syrup on his plate, lift it to his mouth and grin around the sugary sweetness. His smile vanishes a moment later though, when Al promptly shoves his slobbery finger into his left nostril.
“We’re making chili,” Harry answers, because what else can he say? The truth is too complicated and is definitely not something Harry can talk about with Malfoy standing right there.
While he has his friends and plenty of people who love and care about him, things are different now. They all seldom get together anymore. Pub nights and pick-up Quidditch games are rare these days.
“Fine,” Draco says, pressing a kiss to Harry’s lips, both of them lingering just a bit too long for polite company.
Morning coffee with Malfoy has become a common occurrence, the two of them meeting at Starbucks by some unspoken agreement nearly everyday. Harry was surprised at first, by how easily Malfoy made a space for himself in Harry’s daily life but he can’t deny that he likes it.
“Draco and Harry are making chili, Ron. Keep up,” Hermione replies flippantly, “We didn’t mean to interrupt. We just wanted to drop these off.”
This time when Harry moves down Draco’s body, he doesn’t hesitate, taking Draco’s cock into his mouth without preamble. Draco quickly becomes incapable of forming a coherent thought, the only words in his head,
Draco turns to Harry, a million things he wants to say on the tip of his tongue, but he’s unable to find the words. Instead, he swallows nervously and hands the gift over to Harry.
But Draco’s not thinking about all that right now, instead, he lets his eyes hungrily take in the details of the picture he’s holding in his hands, and he wonders at how, a year ago, he never would have imagined that he’d be friends—best friends, possibly—with Harry Potter.
Harry can’t help himself, he pulls Draco to him, crashing their lips together again. When they both finally pull back panting, Draco lets out another laugh.
Really hoping this fast update will help everyone forgive me for the way the last chapter ended <3
“Jesus fucking Christ. Look at you, you’re so good,” Harry praises, as Draco fucks down and buries his fingers deep.
“No I mean—“ Harry blows out a breath. He knows it’s unlikely that Malfoy has an ulterior motive but old habits die hard and fuck it, he has to know, “Why did you say yes when I suggested getting the kids together? Why are you being nice to me? Just—why?”
enjoy :)
Seconds later, Hermione and a grumbling Ron disappear into the flames.
They’re both hard, already, and Draco marvels at how the smallest action can set them off, dragging them into a fog of lust and making the rest of the world fall away. Draco has never wanted someone like this before in his life, has never experienced desire like this, felt out of control and crazy with it the way he does when Harry touches him. It’s amazing and overwhelming and
“Alright,” Draco agrees, as if he would ever say no, “What’s the bet?”
People watching was something his father had encouraged from a young age. Blend in, be silent, watch, observe. Blackmail material is easy to come by when you’re skilled at the exercise.
“I want to do an article. About you and Harry.”
But something tells Harry that it isn’t just attraction that draws him to Malfoy. It’s more than that. Harry
He quickly pushes his pants down, mumbling a lubrication charm, and takes his cock in hand.
Draco picks his knife back up and continues cutting the roots into half inch sections. By the time he has them cut and stored in a container for later use in his Blood Replenishing potions, Astoria still hasn’t said anything. Draco seals the container with an absentminded flick of his wand before he turns back to her.
Potter pockets his wand and presses against him harder. He grabs for Draco’s hands, pinning them above his head, the delicate bones of Draco’s wrists protesting against the vice-like grip.
“Harry! What are you still doing in bed? Have you taken your potion, eaten anything?” Hermione asks, her Healer instincts kicking in.
“You awake?” Kade asks quietly.
As soon as the words leave his mouth Harry wonders just where the fuck they came from. Of all the stupid things to say, that’s what his brain managed to come up with.
“So, tell me how you’re really doing,” Andromeda asks, walking back into the kitchen. Draco admires the way she flicks her wand with easy precision, setting the dishes to wash in the sink.
“This is amazing,” he blurts out, “God, I love chocolate,” Draco says, letting his eyes drift closed as he takes another delectable bite.
When he steps out into the grand drawing room at the Manor, he’s greeted by a house elf he has come to know, and grow quite fond of, during his many visits over the last few weeks.
Those hands leave his hips a moment later and make quick work of his own button and zipper. Harry doesn’t hesitate before reaching inside and drawing out Draco’s cock, but his movements are cautious at first, weighing it in his hands and squeezing gently. Draco moans as Harry rubs a thumb over the tip, spreading the wetness around, making his entire length slick when more follows.
It’s torture. Every day that passes is slowly chipping away at his hope that Draco will show up on his doorstep again and things will go back to normal.
Ron doesn’t look convinced, but he drops it and starts telling Harry about a new product him and George are working on for the joke shop. Harry listens,
It was almost dark by the time he made it back to his flat, and he realised he hadn’t eaten all day. He searched the cupboards, firmly ignoring the mess from earlier and the cause of it. None of the food he had looked particularly appetizing, but he managed to choke down a sandwich and a glass of cold water.
Frustration at himself, at Draco, at life in general begins to build up in his chest.
Harry eyes are wet and his throat is clogged with emotion, but he manages to nod and choke out, “God, I fucking love you.”
And Harry’s never letting him go again.
Harry freezes.
Draco nods, smile still on his face, “I’m staying.”
Then he can only whimper at the sharp, sweet burn as Potter pushes inside. It’s one fluid movement and it knocks the breath right from Draco’s lungs, leaving him gasping for air.
But then, he remembers.
His lips are bitten red and parted slightly, letting soft sounds of pleasure escape as Harry works him open. Stretching and rubbing until Draco is loose and ready for him. “More,” Draco whines, and Harry obliges, fucking into him with three fingers, holding him steady with a hand on his hip. Draco’s eyelashes flutter, legs spreading apart further, and Harry can’t take his eyes off him.
The denim of Potter’s jeans is rough against Draco’s sensitive skin, the zipper digging into the back of his thighs. That sharp sting of pain making everything that much better.
Harry sets the plates down so he has a hand free to run through his hair. “A couple days ago.” Draco raises an eyebrow. “I’ve maybe been sneaking into the Harpies stadium to fly and--”
When Harry wakes up the next morning he feels like he’s been run over by the Knight Bus. His head is throbbing in time with his heartbeat and his whole body aches. He gingerly rolls to his side to reach his wand and casts a quick a Tempus. It’s almost noon. Harry knows he’ll feel better once he takes a pain potion and has something to eat but he can’t make himself get up. Instead, he lays there, in his bed that has way too much extra space, and gives into thoughts of blond hair and grey eyes.
“Neville’s looking for you, Harry. Something about a game of darts?” Ginevra says, and Draco watches as a silent conversation passes between the two, a bit shocked to learn that he can read Harry’s face effortlessly.
Potter spins them away from the wall and into an unused classroom before Draco can even register what’s happening. The movement so smooth and fast he’d think Potter Apparated them if he didn’t know better.
“You know Potter, I think that’s a great idea. Owl me anytime,” says Malfoy.
It takes longer than he would like to push his way through the crowd and down the hallway leading to the bathrooms. By the time Harry swings the door open and steps inside, Draco is already at the sink washing his hands.
Draco keens high in his throat, fingers immediately moving to free his dick and get a hand around himself. And then his mouth is back on Harry, hot and wet, driving Harry closer with every flick of his tongue.
Draco’s speechless in the wake of her words. Hermione stands from the table, throwing down a few Muggle notes, obviously intending to leave without giving Draco a chance to reply.
When Potter’s hands sneak up underneath his shirt, fingers finding a nipple and twisting it meanly, Draco realises his own hands have been released and are hanging limply at his sides. He takes advantage of the momentary freedom and grabs at Potter’s hair, his fingers pulling roughly at the unruly curls.
So Harry goes and gets their usual orders, accepting one of the free, heart-shaped sugar cookies just to see Malfoy glare at him again.
Draco feels nerves flutter in his stomach as he clears his throat and calls for Kreacher.
“Then I suck you off.”
Harry is sitting in his kitchen, enjoying the constant patter of rain drops against the windows, the sound soft and steady, pulling him into a rare state of calm. His lips twitch up into a smile as he watches the two small boys sitting at the scuffed table across from him, their faces covered in a messy mix of chocolate milk and syrup.
Kade grabs his wrist to stop him and Draco hopes that he might be rethinking taking Draco up on his offer.
“Whatever you want, really,” Harry answers. He scoots closer to Malfoy on the sofa and tilts the menu towards him, “C’mon, take a look and see what you’d like.”
Chapter 3 will be posted by next Friday. Thanks for reading.
She nods, accepting his answer and not pressing further, “Good. I’m glad you’re not being your usual oblivious self.”
After a full minute of stunned silence, Draco finally asks, “Why on Earth would you want me to do that?”
Draco doesn’t wait for a reply, just licks his lips and lowers his mouth once more.
“I’m sure. I want to show you off. Want everyone to know you’re mine,” Harry says and Draco practically melts. The possessive tone doing funny things to his heart.
Harry feels a weight he didn’t know was there lift off his chest. He hasn’t ever said that so plainly to anyone before, always worried his words will be taken the wrong way. But here, under the autumn sun, Harry admits the truth that has been eating away at him for years.
Harry rolls off Draco and stands, his legs unsteady as he makes his way to the bathroom. There’s a pleasant ache in his arse, and his body feels sore and well-used in an unfamiliar way. But it’s good.
When he’s settled back in bed, Harry closes his eyes, willing his brain to just give him a break and let him finally sleep. But instead he’s assaulted with a flood of images and whispered words. As clear as if he were looking into a pensieve, Harry sees every kiss, every touch, play out behind his closed eyelids. He sees Draco under him, on top of him, hears the broken way he would say Harry’s name, the way his face went slack with pleasure every time he came apart for Harry.
Harry nods jerkily, “Thanks.”
“Tell me again how we got roped into doing this?” Draco asks, a sour look on his face.
Draco wants to move his hand, wants to grab his cock and stroke it until he comes. But his hands won’t cooperate, staying clenched around the edge of the desk, like they're the only thing tethering him to this plane of existence.
“Move, please. Need you to move.”
But in that moment, when Fiendfyre raged around them, as sweat gathered on Harry’s forehead and his thighs gripped the broom as tightly as he could, the only thought he had was
“Fuck, it’s like you were made for this,” Potter says, the words broken on a moan.
“Fucking hell,” Harry’s says, out of breath as he collapses bonelessly against Draco’s sweaty back.
The answer to that question is
God, it’s so good, Draco’s mouth stretched wide around his cock, his lips shiny wet and red. Draco bobs his head, twirling his tongue as he comes back up and Harry sees stars. His hips jerk up, Draco gags a little but doesn’t slow down or move to stop Harry from fucking into the heat of his mouth. So Harry grabs a handful of silky blonde hair and thrusts again, harder this time. Drool leaks out of Draco’s mouth, running down the side of Harry’s cock and dripping onto his balls, and he’s so close.
Harry’s eyes stray to Draco, where he stands in the middle of the room, his back ramrod straight as he stares unseeing out the French doors, chewing his bottom lip nervously.
Potter swears and rears back, his eyes gone dilated and wide. Draco can only watch, mesmerized, as the blood swells to the surface and drips down Potter’s chin. Draco slowly lifts two fingers, pressing them against the broken flesh, and he can’t stop the whimper that escapes him as Potter slowly sucks his fingers inside.
“I”m gonna—fuck, Harry. I’m—“
“How about I give you your actual present and then we can lay down on those blankets and make out like teenagers,” Harry offers, still not letting Draco out of his arms.
A breathy
“Hello, Potter,” Draco greets when he reaches the drawing room, pulling Potter into their normal one arm hug. The boys are standing with their heads close together, already in deep discussion about what kind of snowman they want to build.
“You’re a good person. Have you made mistakes? Yes. But you deserve to be happy, Draco. At some point, you have to stop punishing yourself for the past.”
Another inch, and it’s starting to feel good now. Every inch deeper makes sparks shoot through his body, every sound of pleasure from Draco’s lips send waves of satisfaction down his spine. Harry slowly lifts back up, and then in one smooth motion, slides back down—all the way down, until their bodies are flush against one another.
He’s so confident, looking absolutely invested in what he’s saying. His green eyes so earnest. And having all of Potter’s attention focused on him like that makes Draco feel lighter than he has in years. He soaks in the feeling, cherishes it, until he realizes Potter is waiting for an explanation. What’s there to say other than the truth?
Afterwards, they lay sated and content, trading soft kisses that lead nowhere. They could stay here, in this moment, forever and Draco would never grow bored.
What Draco doesn’t know, is that Potter leaves for home with Draco’s scarf stuffed in his pocket. He doesn’t know that later that night, Potter sits in his bed, holding the scarf with care, his eyes closed as he inhales Draco’s scent.
Draco stumbles backwards reaching for his wand. But before he can even aim, Ron and Neville appear out of nowhere and grab Harry by the arms.
“Things going any better with Smith?”
*~~~*
“That’s what happens when you attempt to drink the whole bottle yourself,” Harry teases.
Draco doesn’t waste any time. Harry is already hard, the head of his cock wet and peeking out of his foreskin. Draco licks over the slit, collecting the pre-come on his tongue and moaning at the taste and smell of Harry’s arousal. One of Harry’s hands goes to his hair, pulling lightly, while the other tips his chin up, forcing Draco to meet his eyes.
Draco watches Harry’s pupils dilate at his words and knows that either way, he wins.
Draco has never been very patient though.
Malfoy makes a soft noise in return, one that Harry feels more than hears, as Malfoy’s vocal chords vibrate beneath his hand.
,” Harry says breathlessly, the name falling from his lips like an answered prayer.
A laugh bubbles up Harry’s throat, he only just manages to turn it into a cough.
But Draco can’t think about that right now because his father is looking at him with disgust on his face, lips twisted and ears turning red.
“Honestly, not much after that. I just left him there,” Harry meets Remus’ eyes and decides he doesn’t care how desperate his next words sound, “What should I do? Please, just tell me what to do.”
Harry follows Draco through the long hallways of his childhood home, their hands clasped together tightly. Before long, Draco turns into one of the rooms that make up the West wing of the house. Harry glances around, recognizing Narcissa’s preferred sitting room. It’s large, decorated in warm tones and there’s a fire burning low.
And Harry kisses him, because Draco’s right. The past doesn’t matter, not now, when Harry’s busy looking towards the future.
Not gonna lie, I'm super nervous about bottom!harry. I agonized over having them switch, but ultimately decided to say fuck it and hope for the best.
When the owl is just a dot on the horizon, Draco’s heart clenches and he knows, with startling clarity, what he wants to do. What he has to do. Because if he's learned anything, it's that real love doesn’t walk away, feelings don’t either. People do. And Draco is done walking away.
“But then I realized that going back to New York, back to you, wasn’t what I really wanted,” Draco swallows the lump that forms in his throat as he watches hurt and betrayal flash in Kade’s eyes, “I’m sorry,” Draco takes the engagement ring from the pocket of his trousers and slides it across the table. The clink caused by the ring as it bumps against the glass is tinged with finality, “I can’t marry you. You deserve someone who is completely and unconditionally in love with you. I can’t be that person.”
He’d never been more grateful to Ginny for giving him the access code to the Harpies stadium. The pitch was empty, as he knew it would be, and he breathed deeply before kicking off and shooting into the cloudless sky. Harry flew for hours, until his hands ached from gripping his broom and his eyes started to sting from the wind whipping around him.
“You’ll still be here though, right?” Draco asks suddenly, an icy fear settling in his stomach.
“You don’t have to. Harry, you—“ Draco starts to say, not wanting Harry to do anything he’s not ready for. But his protests get cut off.
“I’m sorry,” he apologizes quietly, knowing that those two words aren’t nearly enough to make up for all he’s done.
“I’m supposed to meet him for tea today,” Hermione says uncertain and Harry hates that she’s stuck in the middle of this. Her and Draco had been close, striking up an unlikely friendship in eighth year that flourished when Harry and Draco began dating. She was almost as devastated as Harry was when Draco disappeared.
Draco makes a beautiful visual. Harry can’t decide where to even look. Draco’s writhing beneath him, thighs shaking, his cock hard and leaking against tense abdominal muscles. His chest, flushed pink and heaving, already has a sheen of sweat coating it. There’s a purple bruise in the dip of his delicate collarbones, and several others decorating his neck.
Anxiety spiking, Draco rambles, “You told me how happy you were to have the Black tapestry restored, so I just thought you might like one for the Potters’ as well. Hermione helped me trace the bloodlines back and I found a magical artist to commission. I know it’s not a fun present or anything, but I—I thought it was something you might like to have. I’m sorry if I overstepped or—“ Draco snaps his mouth shut as Harry turns towards him, because Draco has never seen Harry look at him quite the way he is now. His eyes are wet but the smile tilting his lips is blindingly bright.
“What the fuck are you doing here, Potter? How did you even get in?”
“Harry,” Draco says softly, shaking his head as he tries to pull his hand free, “I’m sorry.”
And that’s when he finally allows himself to imagine the future he wants.
“Fuck, Potter.”

“Oh don’t forget, we’re meeting Aaron for drinks tonight,” Kade reminds him, the words mumbled against the skin of his forehead.
“I know but I thought it would be a bad idea to bring coffee through the Floo,” Malfoy replies, offering the Starbucks cup, decorated with little snowmen and reindeer, to Harry.
She sighs. “It was from Draco,” Ah there it is. Hermione pauses, waiting for a reaction Harry assumes. When he doesn’t give one, she continues, “I’m guessing that doesn’t surprise you since he mentioned stopping by. I’m also guessing that you don’t care to tell me how that went?”
Because he can’t say that.
Harry’s other hand holds tight to Malfoy’s hip, pulling him back onto Harry’s cock with every thrust. He mouths at Malfoy’s shoulder, biting—marking him.
goes unsaid, but the words hang in the air between them.
“Fipsy is welcoming you, Harry Potter sir. If you follow me, Master and his guests is being in the sitting room,” the elf says.
“Holy – fuck, Draco,
They’re both frozen in the wake of Draco’s words, neither daring to even breath as the weight of what has just been said settles over the kitchen. No matter how badly Draco wants to drop his gaze, he fights it, keeping his eyes locked on Harry’s. He watches the emotions play over Harry’s features and he sees the moment Harry settles on one.
“You’ve done this before. You have an unfair advantage.”
Draco can tell that Harry’s getting close. His movements grow even more desperate and filthy nonsense starts escaping his mouth. Draco focuses all his attention on Harry then, completely forgetting about his own aching dick for a minute. He quickly pops the button on Harry’s jeans, lowers the zipper, and slowly works his hand inside the parted denim.
Andromeda smiles at him again but there’s a sadness in her voice when she speaks. “Yes, really. It’s your eyes, they’re exactly the same shade as Cissy’s.”
Draco has to admit that Kade, shirtless with his pajama bottoms hanging low on his hips, is a welcome sight. His dark hair is a mess on top of his head and his brown eyes crinkle at the corners as he smiles warmly at Draco.
“How are you so wise?”
“I want this,” Harry says, open and earnest, “I wanna do everything with you.”
He doesn’t know what he thought.
“Being nice!” Draco yells, “Sending me things. Acting like this is some kind of relationship.”
“Let me go. I’m fine. Just let me go so I can leave,” Harry’s eyes are cold, all of the warmth that’s usually there when he looks at Draco gone, “Please, let me go. If I have to look at this piece of shit for another second I’ll be sick.”
Harry doesn’t think he could form actual words if he tried, so he just nods, hoping Draco can see it. He must, because after another few seconds he starts to move.
Draco’s legs are tingling and he stumbles, but Potter’s hands steady him, holding tightly to his waist.
“Thank you for the chocolates.”
“What did you expect? This thing we have,” Draco says, motioning in between them before sighing heavily, “It was never meant to last.”
“Draco, before I met you I thought I was happy with my life the way it was. I was convinced I was fine on my own. But then you came along and gave me everything I didn’t know I was missing. How I ever survived without you I’ll never know,” Kade laughs softly, his eyes glowing with affection, “So, Draco Black, will you make me the happiest man in the world and marry me?”
Draco shrugs. “No one in England wants to hire an ex-death eater.” He looks up at Harry and smiles. “Maybe I’ll have better luck somewhere else.”
Draco’s eyes fight to close at the feeling of Harry moving inside him but he forces them to stay open, not wanting to miss a single moment of this.
, and bury his hands in Draco’s hair.
Draco feels sore and well-used as he straightens up and stretches. Potter is already across the room, quickly pulling his clothes back on. Draco moves to do the same, firmly ignoring Potter’s presence.
“Consider that my thanks for taking me on an amazing date,” Draco drawls.
Harry isn’t sure how exactly to voice his question. Being tactful is not a talent he possesses. Malfoy is staring at him, an amused expression on his face, clearly just waiting for Harry to stick his foot in his mouth.
Instead, Draco says, “Scorpius has plenty of positive influences in his life already,” and he could stop there but something pushes him to antagonize his father, even though he knows the end result will be him storming home in a fit of rage, “He’s been spending a lot of time with the Potters’.”
“Fuck you,” Draco spits out, opening the door and storming out into the hallway.
Yeah, it’s true that Harry doesn’t hate Malfoy anymore, he hasn’t for a long time now and he’s way too old for juvenile rivalries. Harry had even spoken on the Malfoy’s behalf at the trials after the war. Well, two of the Malfoy’s. Lucius is rotting away in Azkaban and that’s just fine in Harry’s opinion.
“I’m sorry to bother you,” the boy says, twisting his hands together in front of him, “but I saw you here and I wanted to thank you Mr. Potter. And—and you Mr. Malfoy.”
Malfoy licks his lips and slowly leans forward.
It’s clear that neither of them can wait, so Draco drags Harry behind one of the food booths and Disapparates them with a crack.
But with Draco, well, he’s always the exception isn’t he? It’s almost primal, the way Harry feels about him, some hindbrain instinct urging him to stake a claim. He wants all of Draco’s attention, wants to be the center of his universe. And maybe that’s wrong. Unhealthy. But Harry’s in too deep now to care. Draco Malfoy is
“You like that, Malfoy?” Harry whispers roughly, squeezing his hand, not tight enough to cut off Malfoy’s air, but with enough pressure so that he feels it, enough to let him know who’s in charge here.
Kissing Harry Potter is like standing in a pit of fire—all consuming, and Draco’s happily burning with it.
of things that belong to him. Growing up he never had anything of his own, even his clothes were someone else’s. So as he got older, and started to accumulate things that were his and his alone, he guarded them carefully. Treasured them.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I have to go,” Draco says, staggering back another step, “I shouldn’t have shown up here like this. It was terribly rude. I—“
. . .
Draco’s hands are in his hair now, carding through it and tugging, maneuvering Harry’s head to just where he wants it, allowing him to deepen the kiss. Draco’s tongue moves in his mouth, almost filthy in the way it rolls against his own, and all Harry can do is try to give as good as he gets.
“I don’t know!” Harry yells, pulling at his hair so hard his scalp tingles painfully, “I was relieved, happy even, to find him standing on my doorstep. Of course, that was before he opened his mouth,” A humorless laugh bubbles up his throat and escapes his lips, “And I would take him back if he asked, if that was what he wanted. I would do anything for him, anything. I still love him. I still love him so much it’s fucking killing me,” Harry’s voice echoes down the empty corridor. He pushes his glasses up and pinches the bridge of his nose, trying to blink the wetness from his eyes.
Harry doesn’t care either way, he just wants Malfoy to make him come. And then he wants to return the favor. He wants Malfoy beneath him, wants to taste him, worship him. Wants to learn his body as intimately as he can.
Harry nods, throat suddenly tight, and gently lowers his body back down. Draco mouths at his neck, his shoulders, everywhere he can reach. “I’m not going anywhere.”
Draco rolls his eyes, “Fine, Potter. Just get on with it. I have potions to get back to,” he says snidely, but Harry won’t let himself be intimidated.
in a way it hadn’t before. Almost tangible. And the most amazing thing about it all is, Draco loves him too.
And of course, he keeps his word. Not allowing Harry to leave the sanctuary of the bedroom for a long, long time.
“I am not,” Harry insists, stepping forward to take his turn and getting the little orange ball into the hole on the first try. Draco kind of hates him.
The start of the new year, the familiar feeling of a new beginning and everything it represents, is one of Draco’s favorite things.
Harry makes him breakfast again, French toast and bacon this time. It’s delicious, and as a thank you, Draco helps clean up afterwards.
“Shirt off,” Malfoy says, his voice raspy and commanding. Goosebumps break out on Harry’s arms. He’ll do anything Malfoy wants.
“Didn’t sleep well?” Kade asks cautiously, knowing from experience to tread lightly when Draco’s in this sort of mood, “Have some coffee, you’ll feel better.”
“Hey mate,” Ron says, dusting the soot from his robes. Harry really needs to have that Floo cleaned.
Harry’s heart swells in his chest.
“Hey little man,” Harry says and Scorpius looks up with a smile.
And suddenly, he can’t breath, and it’s like he’s the one being choked. His vision goes black, stomaching tightening and body tense as he comes in hot spurts over Draco’s tongue.
“Do what? What are you talking about, Draco, what’s wrong?” Narcissa is standing now, the seating chart abandoned to the mess on the table.
Some of the excitement drains from Harry’s face. “Oh. Right, yeah I -“
, Potter. You don’t want—“
Draco gets a good rhythm going and lets his mind go blank, his focus only on Harry and the noises of pleasure Draco is able to draw out of him, learning what he likes and perfecting his movements.
Draco swallows, avoiding her eyes but he still feels them, searching his face.
“Fuck you. Yes, I left but that doesn’t mean I’m not allowed to be upset about this. I had a right to fucking know!” Draco yells at a stunned Harry, “I left. And I don’t know why I thought coming back would be a good idea.”
There’s nothing for it though, he has to get this done. He starts with a batch of Dreamless Sleep that is to be delivered to St. Mungo’s by the end of the week. The process is long and tedious, and Draco finds his mind wandering.
“Um yeah,” Potter laughs a little nervously, “You do drink coffee right? I mean, it’s fine if you don’t. We could get something else or—something,” Potter stammers out, looking more embarrassed the longer he talks. Draco absolutely does not find it endearing.
James and Albus are having what looks like an intense game of tug of war over a discarded piece of tinsel and don’t seem to hear anything Harry is saying. Harry sighs, he’ll be lucky if the whole room isn’t destroyed by the time he fills his coffee mug and returns.
“Okay, okay I’ll be there,” Harry says, holding his hands up.
Orion hoots softly before flying over to the table and offering his leg. Harry unties the letter and opens it with shaking hands.
“It is,” Malfoy assures, pulling out his wand and after two tries, pops the cork, “I suppose you’re forgiven. Stori look, Potter brought us wine,” Malfoy says turning to address his wife who is across the room.
A second later Draco steps out, dusting himself off as he glances around at the mess left behind from Harry’s outburst, but he doesn’t comment. “Well, what is it, Potter?”
“Fine,” Draco says relenting, “If I could pick anyone I wanted, I would have gone to the Yule Ball with Krum,” Draco finally answers. He wants to say
. . .
The boys are upstairs, already asleep and Ginny just called to tell him she got a huge break on her story about the Keeper for Puddlemere United and will be extending her trip for a few more days.
“Good morning,” Draco manages to say before Harry is kissing him hard. Draco internally cringes thinking of how his mouth must taste but Harry doesn’t seem to mind. His tongue slides against Draco’s, licking hotly into his mouth over and over again.
Never one to back down from a competition with Potter, Draco nods and they both climb up to the top of the biggest hill.
Draco laughs, but sobers quickly. “I don’t know what I’m doing,” he confesses in a shaky voice.
Finally, they reach the Apparation point and Potter drops his hand before he speaks again.
He stops fighting and revels in the memories, and somehow, eventually, he drifts to sleep.
“Yes,” Astoria says, pinning him with a look, “and now it’s not so hypothetical. It doesn’t change anything. I just want you to be happy, Draco.”
Harry nods and murmurs his thanks. They both watch Hermione turn and cross the room. She pauses with her hand on the doorknob, “I’m really happy for you, both of you. I’m only a call away if you need me,” she gives them a satisfied smile and in a twirl of green Healer robes, she disappears through the door.
“Hate you too, Potter. Goodnight.”
Harry presses closer still, sliding a thigh against Malfoy’s erection. And then—
“Great,” Harry says with a smile, “One PMS pizza coming up.”
Malfoy’s calculating gaze sweeps over Harry’s face, looking for something. Whatever it is he must find it there because slowly his posture relaxes and his face smoothes.
Harry starts to move, rocking deep into Draco’s body, again and again.
Draco can’t wait to see what the future holds for them.
It could be done faster with magic but Harry doesn’t want to pass up the opportunity to get his hands all over Malfoy’s body. To let his fingers trail over the lean muscles and grab at the perfect curve of his arse. He wants to feel all of that pale, smooth skin and pinch at the hardened nubs of Malfoy’s nipples.
“You can take it off as soon as we make sure it fits properly,” Harry says with a tired sigh.
At the moment, another smile is lighting up Draco’s face, and Harry grips his beer so tight he’s afraid the glass might crack to pieces in his hand. That smile, all perfect white teeth and eyes crinkling, has his heart speeding up, and Harry wants to fucking hex Nott right in his stupid face.
“Great,” Potter says with a nod. He finishes the last drink of his second frappuccino and stands from the table, the bubble they seem to be existing in bursting with the movement, “I’ll owl you a time and place?”
, but he hadn’t been able to focus. His thoughts had repeatedly drifted back to his dream and thoughts of home.
Draco laughs softly. “Okay.”
“Better tools? Explain Potter,” Draco demands but Potter just laughs around the straw in his mouth and shakes his head.
Harry takes a deep breath and finally steps into the sitting room, taking in the silver decorations as his eyes scan the room for Draco.
“What are we going to do with you Harry,” Remus says exasperated, “And then?”
“I don’t think we need to resort to that yet mate, but I’ll let you know if I change my mind.”
It isn’t uncommon for Harry to have nightmares, more so now that he sleeps alone in his big bed, but tonight there are no nightmares, only vivid dreams. The kind of dreams where you’re aware you’re dreaming but go along with it anyway.
But when Harry steps inside and sees the girls at the counter wearing headbands with sparkly hearts on them, he almost wishes that he’d owled Malfoy and cancelled.
Comments and kudos are awesome and honestly make my day!
So, no, Harry is not making a big fuss about the date. It isn't like he has anyone to spend it with and even if he did, he certainly wouldn’t be wasting his Galleons on any of the things he sees displayed.
But wait, what? Is Draco really sitting in a busy Starbucks with Harry Potter, arguing over who stalked who better? Maybe he inhaled some kind of toxin in the greenhouse this morning and is actually still at home, face down on the floor.
“Kneel.”
Harry drags a hand through his hair, and Draco’s eyes track the movement. He can’t wait to get home and feel the silky stands sliding through his own fingers. Can’t wait to pull Harry close and press their lips together with no worry of who might be watching.
Draco drops his eyes and steps back, awkward tension now pulsing between them.
He’s just about to knock again when the door swings open.
“Please,” Draco says, voice low, “Don’t wanna wait.”
Honestly, if someone had told him he’d ring in the new year pleasantly drunk with Potter at his side, he’d have laughed in their face and had them carted off to St. Mungo’s to have their head examined.
Harry jumped up from the sofa when he saw Draco step through the fireplace, his eyes wide with shock and something else Draco thinks might be hope. But he’s made no move further, still just standing there, arms dangling at his sides, staring at Draco.
“The point, Potter, is that I don’t want to be married to you anymore,” Draco says through gritted teeth, “The point is moving on with my life.”
“Did you just Apparate us to the top of the fucking Empire State Building?” Draco demands.
“And if I win?”
. Always gonna be mine.”
Harry turns to face Draco, intending to grab him and Apparate away, but the look on Draco’s face is so unguarded, such a rare sight, that it leaves Harry frozen. Draco is all soft blonde hair and bright blue-grey eyes, and Harry can only stare dumbly as his pulse pounds loudly in his ears. Draco gives him a small smile then, and even though they’re standing under the inky night sky, in that moment it’s like Harry is staring directly into the sun.
“Shh, you’re alright. Just have to get my wand so I can clean us up.”
When Draco comes, Harry’s entire body shudders at the feeling of Draco tightening around him, and he follows him over the edge, his orgasm crashing through him, almost violent in its intensity.
“Is everything alright?” Draco questions, concerned by the look of stress on Astoria’s usually carefree face.
“I still can’t believe your ex-wife is dating one of my best friends,” Draco says, and Harry can’t help but be amused at the genuine shock in his voice. He wishes he had gotten a picture of Draco’s face when he saw Ginny and Blaise walk in together.
Harry rubs his thumb over the bump of Malfoy’s Adam’s apple, feeling it bob in response. Harry squeezes harder and thrusts his fingers again, and he has to bite his own lip to ground himself. Because Malfoy is gasping and whimpering, and every sound is lighting Harry up from the inside out.
Draco pushes off, the wind stinging his face as he glides down the snowy hill. He wills his sled to go faster, wanting to win more than he’s wanted anything in a long time.
And now he finally has his answer.
Harry and Malfoy sitting with their bodies flush against one another, some raunchy comedy George suggested playing on the telly. Shoulders, arms and thighs all touching. Every time Malfoy takes a breath in, Harry can feel his rib cage expand.
I wrote this chapter in fits and starts, and at times it had me seriously close to pulling my hair out. I really hope it came together okay and you guys like it! I'm going to try and post the final chapter later today <3
Harry chooses not to acknowledge the surge of jealously he feels at the thought. But he can’t ignore the image his traitor mind conjures up—him and Malfoy out on a date, walking hand in hand, Harry pressing his lips against Malfoy’s at the end of the night.
it fucking was.” Harry breathes the words against his ear, his eyes tracking the full body shudder they cause. “We’re leaving.
“Oh, er yeah—I mean. We don’t really have a set schedule. Ginny’s off chasing a story right now, so I’ve had them full time for the last few weeks,” Harry says, tripping over his words, still not sure how to answer when people start asking questions related to his recent divorce.
Draco returns his mothers embrace tightly. Then without another word, Narcissa leads Draco back into the house leaving Harry and Kade standing a mere few feet apart from each other.
“You already know what I’m going to tell you to do, Draco,” Astoria says, raising a perfectly manicured eyebrow at him, “Tell him—“
But the new school term has started and Harry is otherwise occupied, so Draco has resolved himself to a day locked away in his potions lab. He usually wouldn’t be bothered by this, but as he looks down at the menacing list of potions that need brewed, he finds himself wishing he was anywhere else.
He quickly got dressed, grabbed his broom and left.
Which is absolute bollocks, Harry mentally reminds himself, tearing his eyes away and focusing instead on the changing leaves. He shouldn’t be reacting to Malfoy like this.
his brain supplies and Harry frowns at himself. Whatever. He’s going to be late if he dithers any longer, so he quickly grabs the bottle of wine off his dresser and makes his way to the Floo, calling out the address and stepping into the flames.
“Git,” Draco says, unable to stop the grin that’s overtaking his face.
“Fine.”
“You want this?” Harry asks. But he doesn’t let Malfoy answer, instead he captures his lips in a kiss, because Harry just can’t help himself. He crowds close again, rolling his hips and lifting a hand to tug at the short hairs at the base of Malfoy’s neck.
Harry’s pulse quickens as he thinks of the way Draco had looked standing on his doorstep yesterday, his mask slipping and for a mere second, Harry was able to see the emotion he was trying to hide. His hair’s longer now, longer than Harry ever remembers seeing it. The fine blond strands had been pulled up into a knot on top of Draco’s head, a few pieces escaping and falling down around his face. And his eyes. Blue-grey and breathtaking. The color of the sea before a storm.
Harry’s thick cock is already hard, wet at the tip, and a pretty dusky pink. Draco’s mouth waters just thinking about feeling the weight of it on his tongue.
“Yeah, according to some of the older kids in Slytherin, Snape’s always nasty to everyone.” As Draco said this, Harry remembered what he’d been meaning to ask.
With the basics mastered, lessons were finally becoming interesting. Class started, and Flitwick got on his pile of books to make the announcement Harry had been anticipating since he’d made Neville’s toad zoom all over the room. “I think we’re finally ready to learn how to make things fly! I’ll put you all into pairs, then we can get started.”
“Were you following us?” Harry asked.
"Here," Hermione said, passing him a plate. "Get some sausage before Ron eats it all." Ron sighed and drank his juice.
"We told you it would be fine. Whatever your father told you was utter rubbish I say," Ron said. Draco didn't answer. He stared at his feet, brow furrowed, and Harry could tell he was conflicted.
Harry was shaking and out of breath. Ron was standing there with his wand still raised, staring at what he had done. Draco brushed a bit of dust off his robes and hair.
“Is it-is it dead?” Hermione stammered in a whisper.
Neville and Seamus got the worst of the scoldings. You see, they had missed Draco’s advice about not burning holes in their cauldron, so the entire class had to get up on the stools to avoid ruining their shoes in the spilt potion. It was a complete mess.
“Hermione Granger is in the girls bathroom, has been all day, so she doesn’t know about the troll. We came to warn her and bring her back to our common room. You should get back to your house before they notice you’re missing,” Ron explained.
Harry scowled. "Do you believe him?"
"Goodnight Draco," Harry and Ron said, and they climbed their way up to the Fat Lady.
“I don’t think so,” Harry said as he watched it’s back rise and fall. “I think it’s just been knocked out.”
“He seemed nice enough on the train, not so much in Diagon Alley, but he did stand up to Crabbe and Goyle. Who knows, maybe he’s not like that at all. I say we give him a chance.”
“So,” Harry said as he got comfortable next to Draco. “How have you liked the classes so far? Any favorites?”
“I just wanted to say sorry for earlier. I was out of line,” Ron said, staring at his feet and kicking at the floor. At that point, pretty much every other student in the Great Hall was sitting at their respective table.
The common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating the food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone, waiting for them to arrive. There was a very embarrassed pause; then, none of them looking at each other, all said "thanks" and hurried off to get plates. Harry would tell her of Draco's gratitude later in the night. But from that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other. Knocking out a twelve foot mountain troll was one of them.
"That...wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. Hagrid was really nice; but he's a God awful baker," Draco admitted to them.
he said in a mocking tone. “It’s no wonder no one can stand her! She’s a nightmare honestly!”
“Confuse it or something!” Harry said desperately to Ron, as Draco was frozen. Thinking on his feet, Ron grabbed a broken tap off the ground and chucked it at the troll as hard as he could. It missed, but created a noise loud enough to stop it in its tracks. It blinked stupidly, looking around to find the source of the metallic clang.
It’s beady eyes landed on Harry. It hesitated, then made for Harry instead, lifting it’s club as it went.
Flitwick waved his wand and a feather appeared in front of each pair. He went on to perform the wand motions and the pronunciation of
“Goat,” Draco whispered under his breath. “Say goat.” Scared of looking stupid by not answering yet again, Harry made the choice to trust him.
