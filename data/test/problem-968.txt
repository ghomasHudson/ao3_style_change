“Quiet,” Snape intoned. “Listen up.” Snape stepped off to the side, and a handsome boy with dark hair and silver pendant stepped forward from the rest of the strange group. His Amber eyes were serious.
A short walk down the corridor from the common room was Professor Snape’s classroom. It was already filled with students from all houses. Mostly Ravenclaws, but also a few Hufflepuffs, as well as Carter, Ronald Weasley, and Neville from Gryffindor. Every student was dark.
Harry set Amon’s cage gently on one of the luggage racks. Carter did the same, and they both sat down. Harry sat next to the compartment’s other inhabitant, a girl with black hair and pale skin, while Carter sat next to the boy. They were both dark, he realized. Tiger Eyes.
"Now wait here until your name is called," McGonagall said loudy for all of them to hear. "Once your name is called you will take a seat on that stool in front of the professor's table. The sorting hat will then decide which house you belong to."
There was a strange looking being standing just outside of the doors, guarding the entrance. Harry assumed the being must be one of the goblins his parents mentioned in their letter. He didn't spend too much time observing the goblin, he didn’t want to offend it.
They were all Tiger Eyes, Harry noted. He was quite literally the only first year to have elevated to Amber. It made him uncomfortable. What if it made him a bigger target with the light first years?
Neville was really coming out of his shell, and Ron, despite his strange tendency to avoid Slytherins, was also growing close to Carter and Neville. He never joined their study sessions in the library, but Harry hoped he would grow out of that stage soon.
Advanced wards: Prevents the trunk and its contents from being damaged by violent intent, misuse and time. If someone attempts to break into the trunk, the owner will be notified by a note written on the lid. Anyone attempting to break in will be cursed with silver hands for three days. The owner will be able to lock the trunk in place with a password. No one but the owner will be able to move the trunk once locked in place. (13 galleons)
Carter and Harry left Diagon Alley shortly after Neville, and walked through the streets of London until they came across a clothing store. They each bought new t-shirts and jeans, knowing they needed clothing that they could wear in the regular world. They also bought trousers, pea coats, and soft flannel shirts. Carter bought a black bomber jacket, while Harry picked a dark green military jacket.
"But you think you could also end up in Gryffindor," Harry finished for him. He knew his cousin. Carter was brave and chivalrous to his core. Harry knew Carter was a boy with the brain of a Slytherin and a heart of a Gryffindor. A dangerous combination if you asked him.
The creature practically jumped up and down with excitement. “Hello good Master. It is so good to see a Master again.”
Harry wanted to ask how Snape knew his parents, but didn't feel it was the proper time. Instead, he said goodbye and left the potions classroom to go to Herbology.
"Hey," the blond boy said, slightly out of breath. "I found a lot of books on the war your parents mentioned in their letter. It was called the Crimson War. I grabbed every book I could on the subject."
The room quieted down again, and he continued, “Many years ago, shortly after the founding of Hogwarts two students walked these halls. Twins, Cadmus and Rosalind Coldwell. Cadmus was a dark wizard, and Rosalind was a light witch. The twins were very competitive, but cared for each other nonetheless. They each started societies in their 7th years at Hogwarts to encourage friendly competition between dark and light students. Cadmus formed the Order of the Masked Dragons for dark magical students, and Rosalind formed the Society of the Ivory Rose for light magical students. Over time however, the groups evolved as the light became more suspicious of the dark. Now it is a serious competition. It is traditional for The Order of the Masked Dragons to have a king, and the Society of the Ivory Rose to have a queen, to represent the twins and the balanced relationship between dark and light. Though, both the order and the society have had kings and queens before.”
Harry narrowed his eyes, "Yes we are, and actually I have quite a lot of money. Didn't Petunia tell you? My parents were extremely wealthy."
"The sorting will take place in a few minutes in front of the rest of the school. Wait just a moment," McGonagall followed the ghosts into another room, leaving them alone.
Before Harry even knew what was happening, the snitch was released and the match began. The players flew so fast that Harry could barely keep track of it all.
Harry walked with Blaise and the other first year boys down the left set of stairs. They quickly realized the doors closest to the base of the stairs were the first year dorms, and set about looking for their names.
He grabbed the last one for Carter’s birthday. He knew Carter loved studying languages, so he wanted to give him materials to study a new language. By the time he was done, he had a massive pile of books stacked in the corner. He continued browsing for a while anyways. He was endlessly fascinated by everything he saw. He wanted to read every book he came across. There was so much information on so many topics. He didn't even know where to begin.
Harry didn't know whether to feel relief or to panic. He fully expected Petunia to throw them out into the snow.
Harry was startled from his thoughts when a shorter boy with a round face stumbled around the corner. The boy had his nose deep in a book about magical plants and didn't even see Harry right away.
“Here you go,” he said. He set them on the counter, and Carter’s jaw dropped when he saw his name engraved in the handle.
Carter nodded and turned to leave, but Harry stopped him. "Hey, we also need to find more books on Dark and Light magic. We still don't know what you are, but I think eye color has something to do with it."
Carter and Harry both filled out Gringotts transfer slips to transfer Madam Malkin 45 galleons each. Then she measured them with a floating tape measure and asked what colored clothing they wanted.
"5,000 pounds per year," Harry replied, and Vernon's jaw dropped. "But that's only if you leave us alone and tell people we live with you if they ask. If you try anything, if you tell the government we aren't staying with you, the deal is off and we ruin your lives."
"Yes Master," Poppy nodded happily, as if she couldn't think of anything better in the world to do. "Right away master!"
The bartender led them through the bar to a brick wall in the back. He pulled a dark colored stick out of the inside of his jacket and tapped several random bricks on the wall. Harry memorized the order in case they decided to come back in the near future.
“Okay, my grandmother is here already. She didn’t want us to be here alone.” Neville shrugged. “She will be with her friends though so don’t worry about her.”
“Not forever,” Harry smirked. “The books say we have to practice a lot to help our magical cores expand. Soon enough you will be an Amber too.”
Harry Potter was born on July 31st 1980 to James and Lily Potter, both of which were light. Lily was the first witch in her family, but James came from a long line of light witches and wizards. Both James and Lily were almost certain their son would follow in their footsteps.
“We can use the flo network,” Neville explained. “There is a flo in the leaky cauldron. We can meet there before the match.”
“I am Blaise Zabini,” the boy introduced himself. He gestured to the girl across from him, “And this is Pansy Parkinson.”
He looked to Carter with a smile on his face, and noticed Carter smiling sadly. Harry realized Carter thought Harry wasn't going to need him now that he had money. Harry quickly made a decision. He turned to Leznek once again. "I would like to open an account for Carter and transfer him 40,000 galleons from my trust fund."
Not really knowing how to react, Harry nodded carefully in his direction. The older boy nodded back and returned to his meal.
"We would rather take our chances out there then spend another minute here!" Carter shouted. "We know what we are. Take the money and leave us alone, otherwise we will make your life hell."
Harry realized this boy was obviously familiar with the magical world. The boy could turn out to be a well of information if he played his cards right.
In class, Snape treated everyone with the same amount of disinterest. It was difficult to tell whether or not he liked you or hated you. It was true that he treated the Slytherins slightly better than the other houses, but Harry thought that was mostly due to him being the Slytherin head of house.
He knew it was probably excessive to ask for so many compartments, but he would probably be using this trunk for the rest of his life, and he wanted it to be big enough for everything he might need.
Snape returned to the front of the room and led the first years through the vow of secrecy. It was a simple vow, that basically made them completely unable to discuss the order and the society with anyone who was not a first year at Hogwarts or older.
He frowned when he realized it was mostly clothing. Baby clothing. He realized it must have been his clothing at some point.
Without waiting to hear the rest of his retort, Harry and Carter continued their walk towards the owlery.
"Strange," Harry replied honestly. "They are very secretive. They don't really talk to the first years, and I rarely see them around. They always seem to go missing."
Neville blanched. “Our parents were close friends. They were all part of Dumbledore’s inner circle.”
With no way to hide the truth about Harry, they made a decision. Two weeks later James and Lily said goodbye to their only son, and they left him with Lily's muggle sister.
Blaise shrugged and reached into his backpack to grab a book. Harry did the same, pulling out a book on potions.
“I think it's your wand,” Harry reassured him. “Rowan did say it would take a while for your wand to bond to you. You just need to keep practicing.”
Harry also learned about emblems. Magical tattoos that appear on witches and wizard’s forearms once they turn 12 years old. The magical tattoos indicated which forms of magic were most compatible with a witch or wizard.
They turned a corner and walked down a long flight of stairs until they reached the dungeons. Once they were far enough away from other students, Blaise cast a privacy spell and pulled a copy of the Daily Prophet out of his backpack.
Harry took a deep breath of fresh air as they stepped outside. The bank had been rather stuffy, plus the goblins were rude and he was glad to escape them.
They knew Harry would be in extreme danger if the light side knew what he was. They would see him as a high security risk, especially given James and Lily's positions in Lord Dumbledore's inner circle.
"Honestly I have been thinking the same thing. I have been trying to come up with a plan," Harry admitted.
Their boat gently touched the shore, and their small group followed the rest of the students up the steps towards Hogwarts.
He leaned over the side of his bunk, gravity making his blond hair stand up straight. "Goodnight Harry."
Amon was suspicious of Harry. He watched Harry's every move, and never let him get too close. "I'm not your enemy," Harry promised him. "Soon enough you will trust me."
Harry glared at him and cast a privacy spell, "Don't get caught doing something stupid. We can't become powerful wizards if they expel us."
Harry ignored Carter when he tried to protest, and soon enough they were signing forms to open Carter's account and transfer the money from Harry's trust.
"I know," Carter ruffled his messy blond hair. "But they don't even teach the Dark Arts, so how are we going to learn? We can't learn everything from books."
Harry closed the book. "Well that's rather obvious isn't it? They want to keep an eye on us. I also read that dark witches and wizards hold quite a bit of the wizarding world’s wealth. If Dumbledore kicked us all out of Hogwarts, we would find other ways to educate ourselves. My guess is the Ministry wants that money to stay in the UK. If we all went to school elsewhere, they would lose a significant amount of wealth."
Carter found his trunk shortly after, a plain charcoal gray trunk with black clasps. It was cheaper than Harry's at 25 galleons, but still beautiful.
Carter continued on through the fake wall, with Harry and Neville following closely behind him. The darkness went on for several steps, but then they suddenly found themselves in a bustling shopping district. There were mothers holding their children's hands, men leaning against a stone wall chatting casually, friends enjoying coffee and tea in the gardens of a tea shop. It looked perfectly safe and happy.
"20 points from you Mr. Malfoy for lying, and 10 points each from Mr. Potter and Mr. Dursley. Mr. Malfoy and Mr. Dursley, you both may go. Mr. Potter, stay for a moment."
The bricks quickly rearranged themselves, revealing a bustling alley full of strangely dressed people and many different shops. Harry and Carter thanked the bartender and walked casually towards the alley. They didn't want to appear to be too excited. After all, they were supposed to have been to Diagon before.
Basic locking feature: Allows you to place a password on the entire trunk. This password would open all compartments. Magic is not needed to open the trunk with the basic locking feature. Only the password is needed. (5 galleons)
"May we have some of the galleons converted into pounds?" Carter asked curiously. Harry had forgotten about that. They would need pounds to shop at regular stores near 4 Privet Drive.
Harry read that most witches and wizards usually only have one or two emblems, but that upper power levels usually had more.
Carter clenched a fist on the table. "I'm not going to be bullied again. We experienced enough of that with the Dursleys."
He gripped the seat tightly as they nearly crashed into several cars. Harry was all for a bit of fun, but this was excessive.
He stopped and knocked on the door of a mostly empty compartment. A dark skinned boy in fine purple robes opened the door. He raised an eyebrow, “Yes?”
She turned and gestured to the boy with the golden pendant behind her, “Our current king was elected last year. His name is Adrian Pucey and he is in his 6th year. Meaning the next king or queen won’t be elected until he graduates."
They wandered through the train looking for an empty compartment. After checking a dozen or so compartments, Harry realized most of them were already full. Sighing, he resigned himself to the fact that they would have to share with people they didn’t know.
"Dumbledore is the reason why," Harry explained casually. "He's too physically powerful. If the dark puts up too much of a fight, he might simply start threatening to kill family members of wealthy individuals. Who would stop him? He's a Moonstone. The only person who could take him on is in prison."
Draco also waited, though with a smirk on his face. Harry rolled his eyes again, knowing how insufferable he would be if they were given detention.
Leznek nodded, "The pouch will automatically do that for you. Just hold the pouch tightly and think of the amount of money you need, whether it be pounds of galleons, and that amount will appear in your hand. If it is an excessive amount of money, you can instead have that money transfered to the store owner's account through a Gringotts transfer. This requires you to fill out a simple piece of parchment at the time of purchase. The transfer will be instantaneous. However, this transfer only works for magical shops."
Harry swallowed and nodded. He didn’t know why this wand chose him, but it did. If anyone found out it would put a huge target on his back. Who knew what Dumbledore would do if he found out.
Carter found his a few minutes later, a pale wood, but Harry was having trouble. Every wand he touched felt cold and dead. He could tell they weren’t meant for him. After about 10 minutes he felt like giving up. Maybe he wouldn’t find one today.
The red haired boy looked extremely nervous as the hat was placed on his head. It wasted no time in calling out, "Gryffindor!"
Harry secretly high fived Carter before returning to their table to wait for the other students to leave.
Harry nodded. He would have to read more books on the war. He needed to know what the goals of the war were, and he needed to know more about Dumbledore. He would attend Hogwarts, which was under Dumbledore’s control. If his parents thought it was necessary to warn Harry about Dumbledore, he needed to learn everything he could about the man he was dealing with.
Harry nodded, “Do you think it’s that side door?” He pointed to the door that was to the left of the cafe entrance.
Harry and Carter quickly made their way to the bookshop. The shopkeeper looked up from his book as they entered. He narrowed his sapphire blue eyes when he saw them and glared.
The boy stared right at Harry, "You're an Amber?" he said in a disbelieving tone. "How exactly did you manage that?"
Blaise patted him on the shoulder and nodded, “Of course. Hopefully someday you can make them proud.”
They quickly entered the shop, they didn’t know how long it would take to get a wand so they didn’t want to waste time.
"Well then we don't have to kill them, but we have to get out of here. We're not meant to be their slaves Harry."
After exploring a little they found three bedrooms, each with a queen size four poster bed. Carter and Harry picked the two smaller bedrooms that were right across from each other. Harry’s was slightly bigger, and had a view of Diagon. His main reason for choosing it though was the fireplace. He hated being cold. Carter’s bedroom was almost identical to Harrys’ except Harry’s was painted charcoal grey, and Carter’s was a dark maroon.
"Boys, you will stay here and complete your list of chores," Petunia lectured them for the tenth time that morning. "They better be finished when we return."
“Neville, you are a dark wizard,” Harry smiled. “You can hide it in your trunk. Then maybe we can practice together?”
Harry had learned long ago that you needed to break the rules in order to succeed. If they had always listened to Petunia and Vernon growing up, they might have starved to death.
There were emblems for ancient runes, charms, transfiguration, wards, dueling, potions, astronomy, herbology, magical creatures, arithmancy, divination, languages, flying, and healing.
Harry nodded and looked towards the hall again. This time he noticed two strangely dressed students. One was an older boy, sitting at the end of the Slytherin table in a high backed chair, furthest away from the professors. He was wearing black robes with golden adornments. He had on a golden pendant of a dragon. Surrounding him were six other students, each of them wearing all black robes and silver dragon pendants. The boy looked bored.
Harry turned back to Carter, "Neville is going to help us buy trunks to store our books and then we are going to Florean Fortescue's for ice cream."
Harry took in the sight of the Hogwarts express and the hundreds of students loading their luggage onto the train with their parents.
“Cool,” Carter and Harry grinned. They climbed the stairs and emerged in a curved, red carpeted room. The room was full of rows of cushioned seats, about half of which were full.
Eventually after a half an hour of searching he found a dark mahogany trunk with black clasps. He chose it after noticing the battle scene carved into the sides. There were witches and wizards raging across a battlefield covered in smoke and ash. It reminded him of his parents, so he informed Lola of his choice, and she took the trunk into the back room to be fitted with wards and compartments. The trunk was 35 galleons not including the alterations, but he decided he could splurge a little.
The stadium seats slowly filled with people as the boys drank their butter beer and talked excitedly.
Neville reached into the jar on the mantle above the fireplace and grabbed a pinch of green flo powder. He threw it in the fireplace and said loudly, “Ballycastle Stadium!” He stepped inside the green flames and disappeared.
McGonagall returned and gestured for them to follow, "This way children, it is time for the sorting ceremony."
"I know," Harry replied. "But let's go. We have a lot of shopping to do before the Dursleys get home."
"Bloody tosser," Harry hissed as he stood and brushed off his robes. "He's a spoiled little brat. Thanks for the help."
He slowly sat up in bed, and gasped at what he saw. He realized he hadn't been dreaming, the bedside table had been destroyed. But so had the bedroom door, and their lamp in the corner.
"Bloody hell Harry, what was that!" Carter exclaimed once they were back on the crowded streets. "40,000 galleons? Why?"
Inches away from the grass the Balleycastle seeker closed his fist around the snitch and pulled up to avoid crashing into the ground. The Falcon's seeker barely managed to avoid crashing as the stadium erupted.
Sometimes they went for walks around the castle to get to know it better. Harry and the others had all gotten lost at least once since the start of the year. Thankfully, Harry was getting the hang of it now.
“I got it,” Carter ran back into the room holding a book. “It’s a house elf. A lot of the ancient families have house elves. I guess they are like servants, they cook and clean for you. This elf must be bonded to the Potter family, so you are its master.”
Hours later he woke with the sunrise. He was covered in sweat. Carter was there next to him, looking more worried than ever.
“My name is Alexander Sykes of Slytherin house,” the handsome boy introduced himself. “I’m in my 5th year, and I am a member of the Order of the Masked Dragons.”
Carter looked at the clock on the wall, “Harry we only have a few hours left. We should probably finish our shopping.”
Harry thought to himself, but he knew deep down Carter still cared for them at least a little. Killing them wasn't an option.
"Don't get me wrong, I love Gryffindor. Not all light Gryffindors are bad. Fred and George, Ron's older brothers are pretty cool. They gave us a bunch of dung bombs last week. Hermione Granger is alright too, she's a first year like us. She's a bit annoying, but she doesn't treat us any differently than she treats the other Gryffindors."
Snape’s eyes left him and he continued speaking, “The third rule is simple. Work hard and do well in all of your classes. If anyone is struggling in a subject, I expect them to work with an older student. I do not accept failure in Slytherin house.”
"Why not just take that money elsewhere anyways and cripple the economy?" Carter asked. "Then we could demand equality and they wouldn't be able to refuse."
Harry handed him the gold coin and said in a confident voice, "We'd like to go to Diagon Alley." He didn't want Stan Shunpike to question why two young boys were riding the bus alone.
Carter sealed the letter and passed it to Lenna. "Here girl, take this to Neville Longbottom please."
Harry nodded. He took out his wand and cast a silencing spell on their room. It was one of the very first spells he learned with his wand.
Dumbledore's eyes were unnerving, he decided, it wasn't normal. There was no distinction between his iris and the rest of his eye. All of it was white.
"Then we will have to make sure they don't find out. Let's pay the Dursleys enough money to keep them quiet. They won't say no to money. I know my parents."
Harry nodded, "I definitely noticed a power increase, and it's easier to cast spells, that's for sure."
“My parents too,” Harry smiled, remembering what his parents wrote in their letter. They picked a random direction and began walking, trying to find Rowan’s Wand Shop.
Harry quickly noticed the people were exclusively dark witches and wizards. He saw Tiger Eyes, Ambers, Carnelians, and even a couple of Jaspers.
He opened the trunk and had to suppress a cough as dust flew around him. He ignored it and used the flashlight to see inside of the trunk.
Eventually the prefects led them to an empty stretch of wall in the dungeons. The prefect pointed towards the ceiling and said, “See that snake there, carved into the ceiling? That’s the indicator for the common room. The password is
The boats lurched and began following Hagrid out into the lake. Harry smiled a little and looked down into the black water. He loved magic.
Harry considered that for a minute. He wasn’t sure whether or not he would be able to leave the house. But in the end he nodded. He would figure out a way to leave the Dursleys. He thought he deserved to celebrate his birthday for once.
Dumbledore sat in a high backed chair in the middle of the professors table. His eyes were completely white, and they were so bright that Harry could see them clearly from across the room. He was the only known Moonstone in the world.
Neville sat in the front row, and Carter and Harry sat beside him, both of them wide eyed and excited. In front of them was a glass window overlooking a massive quidditch pitch like the ones they had seen photos of in their books. They were located high up in the middle of the pitch, and to either side of them Harry saw three rings on tall posts. He knew the rings were used by the chasers to score points.
With his rant over, Draco flopped down on the bed on the left side of the room. Harry cleared his throat delicately, and Draco pushed himself up on his elbows.
Harry didn't look up from his book, "I don't feel like being sent to another prison just to escape this one."
That night, the Dark Lord Voldemort was captured and locked away in the deepest depths of Crowmark, an underwater prison hidden in the Atlantic Ocean.
The elderly bus driver pulled several ancient looking levers before the bus took off. Harry and Carter were thrown back into their seats, and they gave each other nervous looks. They were going so fast Harry could hardly see the buildings passing by.
The naturally lit shop was neatly organized and cozy. There was a blazing fireplace in one corner, and a couple of sofas in the other corner. Behind the counter was an elderly man graying hair and blood red eyes. A Jasper. He smiled gently at them, “Hello lads. What can I do for you today?”
She gave them another knowing look and shrunk down their old clothes and ratty shoes into bundles. "When you return home just hold the bundle in your hand and say the word 'unravel' in order to return it to its normal size."
"Thank you Madam," he replied. She fussed over Carter for a minute before handing them their bundles. She asked them if they wanted her to throw their old clothing away, but they refused. They couldn't wear their new clothing while they were still living with the Dursleys. They would surely notice and punish them for stealing.
Neville grinned and spent the next few hours practicing the spell. By the time Poppy called all of them for lunch Neville was much more confident. He was able to execute the spell almost perfectly.
Neville found his first, a golden brown piece of wood. He handed it to Rowan who nodded, “Chestnut, yes yes.”
Carter and Harry both nodded and picked up their keys and pouches. Leznek cleared his throat, "Make sure to look after your key. You can store it in the pouch for safe keeping."
Harry was nervous for his cousin. He was the only dark wizard in a house full of light witches and wizards. What if they hurt him?
The shopkeeper glared, but didn't say another word. He wasn't about to miss out on such a big sale. Between Carter and Harry, he would probably make more money in one day than he normally would in a week.
Shrinking feature: Allows the owner to shrink the trunk down to the size of a match box and carry it with them. (7 galleons).
Carter nodded, "I don't want to be in separate houses. Also, Gryffindor is mostly made of light witches and wizards. I don't know if I would fit."
"I'm going to be in Slytherin just like the generations of Malfoys before me," a blond boy to Harry's right whispered to another boy with light brown hair. "I'm going to be the best in my year, just like my father."
"Well hello there lads," the bartender greeted them, his purple eyes crinkling at the edges. "What can I do for you?"
Carter began looking through the bag of coins, while Harry sat cross-legged on his bed. He opened the envelope carefully, wanting to keep it intact. His hands shook a little as he unfolded the letter.
As they were walking past the various rows, Harry noticed a group of men and women, all who looked to be in their thirties. They were all staring at the three boys with contempt in their glittering amethyst eyes. Harry narrowed his own amber eyes and glared back. He wasn’t about to be intimidated by light magic users.
As they were stepping off the train, Harry briefly wondered where Neville was. He vowed to find him once they made it to the school.
Harry turned in the flashlight as Carter pulled the ladder up behind them. The last thing they needed was Petunia or Vernon finding them.
They only stopped when they reached the owlery. They took a break at the base of the stairs to catch their breath.
"Hello Blaise, Pansy, " the blond boy from earlier approached their small group. He looked at Harry, Carter, and Neville in confusion. "Who are you?"
Harry wasn't the type to brag about anything. He never had anything to brag about, but he wasn't about to let this bigoted man insult him.
Once they were gone, Harry turned to Snape to find the man already looking at him with blank, maroon eyes.
“It’s fine,” Harry waved her off. He could understand why Blaise was interested. It was rare for dark witches and wizards to be born into light families. Dark muggleborns were even more rare. Researchers had no idea why this was the case, but they admitted that statistics showed children normally followed in their parents footsteps, and muggleborns were almost
As soon as they left the shop, Harry turned to Neville and Carter. “Please don’t tell anyone about my wand,” he asked them quietly.
Then, before calling the Knight bus they stuffed all of their purchases in their trunks and shrunk them down to the size of a matchbox with their wands.
"Petunia seemed to know what was going on, but she was furious. So was Vernon. They let me take care of you, but I don't know what they will do now that it's over."
Harry turned sat on the stool with his back to Dumbledore. McGonagall placed the hat gently on his head, and he was startled when he heard it's voice in his mind.
"Deal," Vernon said quickly. Petunia glanced between them all, as if she couldn't decide if all this was a dream.
"I'm Harry Potter," Harry said blandly. "And this is my cousin Carter Dursley and my friend Neville Longbottom."
Harry poured over pictures of the different emblems, wondering which ones he would get when he turned 12. He spent the next hour memorizing the emblems so that he would be able to recognize them on sight.
They were talking about how much they hated History of Magic when they walked past Draco Malfoy in the courtyard with Gregory Goyle and Vincent Crabb.
Carter opened the fridge and grabbed two carrots and some grapes, while Harry stole a can of peas and a few almonds from the cupboard.
Harry nodded and stepped back from the door. He rubbed his head absent-mindedly while Carter opened the door as quietly as he possibly could.
A few other students were sorted before Carter's name was called. Harry looked to his cousin and watched his face pale. Carter stood tall and walked to the front. McGonagall placed the hat on his head and it barely touched his head before deciding.
"The Rose Court is the same though," Carter added. "They don't talk to the first years, especially not Ron, Neville and I. Some nights they disappear and no one can find them."
He watched Adrian as he asked the question. Adrian met his eye, and smirked. His eyes danced with amusement.
They each threw on a black robe over their jumpers and hurried back to the front of the store with their old tattered clothing folded under their arms. Madam Malkin had already wrapped up their clothing in large bundles. She tapped each bundle with her wand and they shrunk down to the size of a match box.
Harry walked quickly through the streets until they reached Knockturn Alley. After their first visit to Knockturn, Harry decided he would try to do most of his shopping there. He felt more comfortable breathing in the dark rebellious atmosphere.
The Knight bus appeared out of thin air like last time. Carter gave a small smile, "Yeah that sounds good."
The man, who Harry assumed must be Rowan, waved for them to follow him. They followed him into a grand back room with tables full of wood sticks and random objects he couldn’t identify.
He clenched his jaw and looked deep into Harry’s eyes, “I sold this same wand to the Dark Lord Voldemort. Your wands are twins. The wood from your wands came from the same tree, and the Rougarou heartstrings came from the same Rougarou.”
They also went to the nearest Tesco and bought nonperishable food and bottles of water to store in their trunks.
“Well,” Neville leaned forward in his seat, and Carter and Harry followed suit. “This isn’t public knowledge, but my gran told me Lord Dumbledore trapped Lord Voldemort’s entire inner circle. The rumor is that Voldemort cared deeply for his inner circle and he tried to rescue them. But of course that’s what Lord Dumbledore was hoping for. I don’t know anything else though. I doubt anyone really knows the truth, other than the people who were there.”
Harry walked as confidently as he could up to the bar. Well, as confidently as he could for a ten year old anyway.
Neville moved to stand in front of the dummy and lifted his wand. He practiced the wand movements a few more times before casting the spell, "
Snape then turned to the prefects, “Take them to my classroom, Adrian is waiting with the rest of the court.”
Neville nodded, “Yeah I was really surprised when I first saw you. It's uncommon for that to happen. How old are you guys?”
A nervous looking girl walked quickly forward to take a seat. McGonagall placed a ragged looking brown pointed hat on her head. The hat was silent for only a moment before it shouted, "Hufflepuff!"
The shopkeeper shrunk down their books into pocket sized packages, much like Madam Malkin did with their clothing.
All babies are born with grey eyes, a neutral color. After one year their eyes change. They turn dark green for light magic, and brown with flecks of gold for dark magic.
Harry and Carter both ate the carrots, grapes, and almonds before drinking from one of the water bottles.
Carter laughed and looked to Harry, “Honestly Neville we know almost nothing about this world. We just learned about it yesterday.”
He flopped down on his bed and pulled his thin blanket over him. That was another thing he needed to buy soon. He hated the cold.
Soon enough the goblin handed them bronze keys, a piece of parchment containing information on how to access the Diagon Alley flat, and black pouches. "Here are the keys to your vaults, information and extended money pouches which allow you to access your money from anywhere. The pouches have several security features. Only you can access the pouch, anyone else who tries will be cursed. It will also return to you if you accidentally lose it. The pouch has a yearly fee of 30 galleons."
A translucent wall of crystal formed in front of him, and Harry could immediately tell this shield was stronger than the last one. Harry also shifted into a dueling stance, “
As if on cue, Harry heard Petunia's footsteps climbing the stairs. She appeared in their doorway a moment later.
Harry removed one of the strange gold coins from the pouch and tossed it up into the air three times. At first he didn't expect anything to happen, but then a double decker bus appeared out of thin air.
"No clue," Harry shrugged. Pansy tried to follow them one time but almost got caught, so she had to leave.
"Good, at least Carter and Neville will have another dark wizard in Gryffindor," Harry said as he clapped.
Daphne Greengrass was the next witch he knew to be sorted, she ended up in Slytherin. Her greeting was much warmer than Carter's.
Neville's expression was determined when it was his turn to sit on the stool. The hat was silent for a long while, much longer than any of the other students.
His cousin, Carter Dursley was standing behind him, anxiously shifting his weight from foot to foot.
The rude goblin turned back to the stack of papers on his desk and ignored Harry once again. Harry kept his expression polite despite the fact that he was irritated. He decided he didn't like the goblins.
Now Blaise was staring at them as if they were puzzles he needed to solve. “A dark Potter who has already elevated to Amber, and a dark muggleborn. Very interesting,” he mumbled to himself as if they weren’t even there.
"You should go wherever you think is the best option for you," Harry told him. "I promise you and I will always be brothers, no matter which house you decide to join. And don't worry about the light witches and wizards. They won't stand a chance against you."
"Harry," he reached out his hand and Neville shook it. "Say Neville, my cousin and I just recently learned about magic, and we honestly don't know much about… well, really anything I guess. Would you mind explaining some things for us maybe?"
Vernon glanced at Petunia, and Harry laughed, "Oh so she didn't tell you. My parents were very influential. They had a lot of friends, so I wouldn't try anything with us."
“I’m buying it for you,” Harry promised, and he went to find one of the store attendants. He found a bored looking man who looked to be in his early 20’s.
"Brilliant," Carter laughed. "If you two didn't share a room, I'd suggest a dung bomb or two for him."
He looked across the hall to the Gryffindor table, and noticed Carter was laughing along with Neville and Ronald Weasley. Ronald looked much more comfortable than he did before the sorting. It made Harry feel a bit better, knowing they would look out for each other in Gryffindor tower.
Not wanting to appear nervous, Harry immediately picked up the dagger and pricked his finger. The dagger was so sharp he didn't feel any pain, and he allowed three drops of blood to fall onto the parchment.
Harry also read that Voldemort was well known for his large number of rare emblems. He was known to have spell crafting, wandless magic, necromancy, ritual magic, dueling, parseltongue, ancient runes, and strategy emblems.
Further into the room on the left side was a small sitting area, with two sofas and a chair, situated in front of a small fireplace.
Poppy had converted the flat’s empty master bedroom into a dueling chamber for them to practice. The newly expanded room was complete with padded walls, a dueling platform, and wards to prevent wayward spells from destroying the flat. They had to bring in an expert to expand the room and add wards, but it was well worth it in Harry’s mind. They needed to practice. Hogwarts was only two months away, and they didn’t have time to spare.
Angelina Johnson was the new queen of the Society of the Ivory Rose, appointed at the start of the year. She was a Gryffindor 4th year, and she was feared by every dark witch and wizard at Hogwarts. Except for Adrian Pucey of course. According to Pansy, Adrian and Angelina despised one another.
He picked up Harry’s wand then, "Yew with a Rogarou heartstring core, 11 ½ inches." Rowan looked slightly nervous. "Impressive. And here we must have a leader on our hands. A very rare wand this one is. This is only the second Yew and Rougarou wand I have ever sold. This core was a gift from the American wand maker Violetta Beauvais. Yes, what a skilled woman she was. Rougarou heartstring cores are very well suited for powerful dark magic. You are destined for great things Mr. Potter."
He scanned the small dusty attic, which he quickly realized was mostly full of boxes. However, in the far corner he noticed something different. A large wooden trunk.
“Don’t you ever get tired?” Carter laughed, “Well, probably not I guess. I’m just a Tiger Eye. You're an Amber, so you are six times more powerful than me.”
"Actually I find his scent much more pleasant than I find yours Malfoy," Harry replied lightly. "Your breath does smell awful in the morning."
Whispering broke out, and McGonagall raised her hand to silence them, "The four houses are Ravenclaw, Hufflepuff, Gryffindor, and Slytherin. Each house has its own values and notable history. While you are here, your successes will gain you house points, and any misbehavior will cause you to lose house points. At the end of the year, the house with the most points will win the house cup. I hope each and every one of you succeed wherever you are sorted."
The room had rough stone walls with plants and vines growing everywhere. There were large glass windows displaying the moonlit Black Lake, filled with kelp and fish of all sizes. Older students were reading textbooks on huge black leather sofas, and socializing with friends at oversized, round study tables. The room was warm despite being so far underground. It probably had something to do with the many crackling fireplaces spread throughout the room.
"I would like to speak to someone about my trust fund," Harry said, repeating what his parents had written in their letter.
The three of them ordered their ice cream and sat down at a small table hidden away in the corner of the shop.
Harry ate silently, listening to Draco drone on and on about his father and how he'd been training his whole life to become the best in the year.
"You should know only cowards attack when someone's back is turned," Snape intoned. "However, you should have found a professor instead of returning the favor Mr. Dursley."
After leaving the quidditch supply store they returned to Diagon Alley. Harry pulled out the parchment given to him by the goblins, which explained how to access his parents flat.
Before he could protest Carter was banging on their bedroom door and shouting, "Petunia! Vernon! Harry's very sick!"
"Did you see the paper this morning?" Blaise asked as they left their charms lesson several days later.
Obsidian knives left his wand at a high velocity and struck the dummy directly in the center of its chest.
The both ordered their food along with two cokes. They rarely ever drank anything besides water, and they wanted to have something different.
They pulled the bacon and sausage out of their pockets as Amon and Lenna flew down from the owlery to meet them.
Harry nodded and went to find Carter again. Carter was looking at a black and red jersey hanging next to the broom. There was a large bat situated above two crossed brooms with its wings spread wide across the chest of the jersey. “The Ballycastle Bats?” Harry asked.
Blaise appeared behind him with the other Slytherin first years. “Looks like it's only dark first years in here,” he said.
"To be honest, I didn't know you sir," Harry said apologetically. "I didn't know if we could trust you."
Harry swallowed thickly and picked up the parchment. He broke the plain black seal, and opened the letter.
Harry’s jaw dropped. He didn’t even attempt to hide his shock. Neville and Carter both had similar expressions on their face.
They usually stole healthier foods like vegetables, because Carter's beloved twin brother Dudley hated anything healthy. It was unlikely Dudley and Petunia would ever notice a few carrots missing.
In the end he decided to get all the compartments except the magical garden compartment. He didn't think he would need that. He also decided to get the advanced locking feature, the shrinking feature, and the advanced wards. Now that he finally had his own things, he didn't want anyone to be able to destroy them.
"Approximately five pounds," Leznek replied evenly. "You currently have 135,000 galleons in your account, which roughly equates to 675,000 pounds. Your parents stated in their will that 15,000 galleons should be deposited into your trust every year on your birthday until you turn 17. On your 17th birthday you will inherit the Potter family vault and the Potter artifact vault, as well as Potter Manor."
“The benefits of being in the order are immeasurable,” Alexander added. “Access to protected knowledge, as well as endless connections in the wizarding world once you graduate.”
"We are leaving. We know we are wizards, and we refuse to be your servants any longer. If you agree to leave us alone, we will pay you."
They both slipped their keys into their black pouches and thanked the goblin before leaving the bank.
Harry swallowed with some difficulty. It was too much. He had never heard of anyone having so much money before, and it was a lot to process. He had over half a million pounds in his trust fund, and an apartment in Diagon Alley.
Carter grinned, and the two of them opened the door. They climbed the wooden stairs and found themselves in a spacious flat, decorated in reds and golds. The floors were hard wood, and most of the furniture was dark mahogany. There was an open concept kitchen and living room with large windows overlooking Diagon. Carter immediately flopped down on the sofa and groaned, “This thing is literally softer than a cloud.”
The three of them made their way back to Diagon Alley, and Neville saw his grandmother waiting outside of the Leaky Cauldron. She looked angry.
The boy stared at him curiously for a moment before nodding and stepping back. “Of course, come in please.”
The seekers hovered above the pitch, watching for the tiny golden snitch which had disappeared right at the start of the match. The chasers were flying quickly across the pitch, scoring points for both teams while the beaters and keepers did their best to prevent them from doing so.
"Here you go, " Harry whispered gently as he held out a treat. His newly adopted black Great Horned Owl, Amon, named after the Egyptian God, reached out carefully and snapped up the treat.
He approached the nearest bank teller. The teller ignored him at first. Feeling a little annoyed, Harry cleared his throat politely.
Harry wasn't nervous per se. He had never spoken to Snape directly, so he was more concerned about a bad first impression.
Neville nodded in understanding. "You guys are lucky. My grandmother never leaves me alone, and she always criticizes everything I do."
Carter narrowed his eyes and nodded. He shifted his feet into a dueling stance and pointed his wand, “
Carter pulled down the ladder as carefully as he could, but his hand slipped last second and the ladder began to fall.
"Slytherin," Harry said without hesitating. He knew it was where he belonged. Cunning, ambition, leadership, resourcefulness… It all fit.
The two of them snuck out of their room and made their way to the kitchen without a sound. After years of practice, they knew which floorboards creaked and which ones didn't.
Harry definitely wouldn't want to be Carter's enemy. He was both cunning and brave. Idiots like the Dursleys didn't stand a chance against him.
Rowan passed a box to each of them. They opened their boxes, and Rowan picked up Carter’s pale wand, “Aspen and thunderbird tail feather, 12 inches. A dueler's wand. You must be strong minded my boy. You will make a fine warrior someday. Keep in mind, it may take some time and practice before this wand bonds to you completely, but once bonded it will be more loyal than any friend." Carter beamed at the elderly man.
Harry thought over what compartments he would need. He didn't know enough about the magical world to make a proper decision, but he did need a place to store his things, especially his books.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed, but before he could say more dinner was over, and they were being led down to the Slytherin dorms by the prefects. The students from the boy’s group disappeared in a different direction, but no one appeared to care. Harry decided to focus on the route they took into the dungeons. He needed to be able to find his way back to the Great Hall in the morning.
“Would you mind if my cousin and I joined you?” Harry asked politely. “The other compartments are full.”
Until the war ended, it was the safest place for Harry. They told no one where Harry was, not even their most trusted friends.
He dug deeper and found an unopened letter. He handed that to Carter to read later. He then found a small leather bag full of English pounds and coins he couldn't recognize. He handed it off before continuing.
That's how long it takes for a newborn witch or wizard's magical core to settle after birth. After one year, their eyes change color depending on if they have dark or light magic.
He wished more than anything his parents had survived whatever war they were fighting. One lone tear escaped and slid down his cheek. He quickly swiped it away. He didn't like crying.
"It's this way," Neville explained as they walked down the street towards Gringotts. "There are loads of different trunks to choose from. Mine has a library compartment and a small garden compartment to grow magical plants. It's wicked."
Harry sprinted upstairs and grabbed the letter and coin pouch from under the floorboard before meeting Carter by the front door.
Carter asked for the same compartments and features as Harry, except Carter wanted large weapons and quidditch compartments.
Harry put down his book, sensing Carter was being serious. He looked up to see his cousin looking at him with a furious expression on his face.
"Thank you Poppy," Harry and Carter chimed together. They knew better than to refuse her. One time she burst into tears, and another time she simply grabbed them by the ears and pulled them over to the table. Apparently they were far too skinny.
"I'm glad I'm in Slytherin," Harry grimaced. "I couldn't imagine living with the light queen as a dark wizard."
Harry could only imagine the benefits of being part of the order. Becoming a powerful wizard was probably easier when you were surrounded by other powerful witches and wizards all the time. Once he graduated in seven years, he could easily connect with other former members of the order and ask for favors. He was more than a little eager to join. It was exactly the opportunity he needed.
“That’s all for tonight,” Alexander clapped his hands together once they all made the vow. “You will know when the competition begins. There are 143 dark witches and wizards in your year, more than any other year before you. In fact, you outnumber the light first years by 10 students. The competition is fierce. I suggest you all start preparing.”
He swallowed thickly and looked to Carter who appeared to have noticed the same thing. "Are you sure about Gryffindor?" he asked.
Harry felt extremely nervous as he walked to the front. He looked up as he approached the stool and found Dumbledore staring at him. Due to his strange eyes, it was hard to tell where the man was looking, but Harry just
"That's great Neville," Carter grinned. "We were wondering if you wanted to start practicing with us? We don't have much time before Hogwarts, and we want to get ahead."
Carter pulled 5,000 pounds out of his pocket and threw it on the floor. "Goodbye. I hope you all live shitty lives."
Harry nodded in agreement. That was the trick after all. Flexibility. Anyone could survive if they were adaptable. Carter and Harry prided themselves on being adaptable. Their new trunks, their books, their new clothes… all of it played a part. But most importantly, their trunks made it easy to be mobile. They could hide all of their belongings in a safe place without worrying. They could fill an extra trunk with food and Petunia would never know.
Harry ignored the man and continued into the shop. Carter and Harry decided to split up shortly after and wander the shelves.
The first month of school went by quickly. He usually ate breakfast at the Gryffindor table, and spent his day attending classes with the Slytherins. In the evenings he usually met Blaise, Pansy, Theo, Carter, and Neville in the library to work on homework.
Harry and Carter only just joined the magical world over the summer, and now that world they had fallen in love with was turning against them. It was devastating.
“Where is the platform?” Carter looked around the station. “There is no such thing as a platform 9 ¾.”
interested. He wanted to stand out. Perhaps his ambition was getting the best of him. Maybe it would put a target on his back, but maybe it would help him in the end.
“That’s fine Neville,” Carter said. “So where do we go now?” They looked to be in a long, curved corridor filled with people.
The students all turned to look at them, and Harry noticed how segregated between the houses they were. The entire Slytherin table was dark. All of the students were either Tiger Eyes, Amber's, or Carnelians. The Ravenclaw table was largely dark as well, but he did see a couple light witches and wizards mixed in. Hufflepuff and Gryffindor were almost entirely light. All of the students he saw sitting at those tables were either Emeralds, Sapphires, or Amethysts.
They once again called the Knight bus and told Stan they wanted to go to Diagon. Harry and Carter quickly made their way through the Leaky Cauldron. Harry tapped the bricks with his wand, revealing a busy Diagon Alley.
The angry shopkeeper began adding up Harry's books. "Do you even have enough money for this boy," he grumbled.
"Wow," Carter breathed, and all Harry could do was nod in agreement. The castle, with its tall towers and large windows stood at the edge of the water.
The castle's lights glittered as they reflected on the lake. It was as if a thousand stars had stationed themselves in the water to guide them to their new home.
"Mr. Malfoy has explained to me that you cursed him earlier in the courtyard today Mr. Potter and Mr. Dursley. Would you like to explain your behavior?" Snape said with his back turned to them as he organized the day's potions.
Harry nodded as he absorbed this information. His parents died alongside Neville’s. “I’m sorry you lost your parents too Neville.”
Carter and Harry paid for their trunks via Gringotts transfer. In total, both Carter and Harry paid 160 galleons for their new trunks. It was expensive. Harry felt extremely guilty about spending so much money in one day, but everything he purchased would be useful. He knew they were very behind in terms of magical knowledge. Everything they bought today would help them change that.
The prefects guided them back into the Slytherin common room and pointed towards two sets of stairs,
He was really about to go to Hogwarts, he realized. He was leaving behind the muggle world for good, and that thought filled him with joy.
Lola shrunk their trunks for them before leaning over to whisper in Harry's ear, "You're going to need a wand to add your magical signature and passwords to the trunk. Otherwise the security features can't be activated. If you don't own one already, I would recommend going to 'Rowan's Wands' in Knockturn Alley. He makes wands specifically for dark wizards. They are much better suited for our kind than 'Ollivander' s Wands' here in Diagon Alley. He also sells wands to anyone over the age of five, so that's an added bonus. We tend to start learning at a younger age. We don't like it when light witches and wizards beat us in a duel."
Harry knew Carter was talking about the Order of the Masked Dragon. They hadn't heard from the court yet about the start of the challenges, but they all knew they were likely to start soon.
Harry shook his head, "No sir. The Dursleys weren't that bad,” He lied. “I was able to read a lot over the summer. I think I understand mostly everything."
Harry collapsed onto his bed as he heard the lock click shut for the night. Carter leaned over him, looking very worried. "Harry?"
He was glad to learn his parents weren't drunks, and that they actually wanted to protect him. He was angry that they left him with people who hated his very existence. And on top of it all, he was extremely surprised to learn he was a wizard, and that there were other people like him.
Carter pulled out a piece of parchment and a quill. They had been practicing how to write with quills recently to avoid having bad handwriting when they started studying at Hogwarts.
To be honest, Harry hated most of it, but he had learned not to be picky over the years. He knew they could only buy food that wouldn't go bad in their trunks.
Snape watched him curiously as he flattened the pages and held it out. Snape took the parchment from him and began to read silently.
“Probably not,” Harry replied as he looked over the book list. “But who knows what spells and wards they have for detecting things like that. We should probably leave them here.”
"Good evening and welcome to Hogwarts," Dumbledore's voice carried across the hall. He smiled gently, "Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you."
At a young age Harry realized he was very good at reading and memorizing information. It didn't take very long for him to outgrow Dudley's books, but he read them anyway. He knew it was good practice.
“No clue,” Harry shook his head, “But it probably has something to do with them,” He pointed towards the group standing at the front of the room. The group from the far end of the Slytherin table was there, wearing their black and gold robes and odd pendants. The bored boy with the golden pendant was leaning casually against a desk at the back of the room. It was clear he was the leader. His eyes were sharper now, as if he was hunting. He was observing everything, every conversation and interaction. Harry wondered if he was the Adrian Snape was talking about earlier.
“No,” Harry shook his head. “Plus I don’t think that is a good idea. Our aunt wouldn’t like it if owls started showing up to our house.”
"Enough talking," Snape was now standing at the front of the room with his hands crossed behind his back. Malfoy walked back to his seat with a smirk on his face.
The dizziness was still there and it was making him feel a bit nauseous, but now he felt a heavy weight in his bones. He was exhausted.
Harry sighed in defeat and took a deep gulp from the bottle. He relaxed back onto his bed, feeling worse by the minute.
Sure enough, the bat's seeker was speeding across the pitch towards the falcons goal posts with the falcons seeker hot on his tail.
"A light family, very loyal to Dumbledore," Neville replied. "They were friends with the Potters and the Longbottoms back in the day if I remember correctly."
It was Harry's first time ever really having friends. Before Hogwarts, he only ever had Carter to talk to.
“It’s okay,” Harry waved him off. “Would you just… help us understand some things? About dark witches and wizards? Do people not like us?”
“It says we are supposed to find ‘The Daily Grind Cafe’,” Harry told Carter. “The flat is on the second floor.”
Draco looked at the trunk, sneered again, and stomped across the room to the other bed without a word.
Stan didn't seem to care however. He gestured for them to sit before shouting, "Take it away Ernie!"
