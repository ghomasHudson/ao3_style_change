Harry gave a watery smile. "I want to," he said gently. "I love Maddie too. And I stand the thought of them being split up." Harry looked at the grandmother hopefully. "We wouldn't keep them from you. You would be able to see them whenever you like."
“This is a great party,” Ron muttered over the rim of his wine glass, grimacing as if the admission caused him pain.  He certainly hadn’t expected to attend a decent Christmas party at Draco Malfoy’s house.  It was beautifully decorated and full of the sounds of Christmas music and laughter.  He’d rather hoped that the atmosphere would be boring and snobbish so he’d have something to complain about.  At the moment, he could only complain that the large impressive house belonged to Malfoy.
Harry sighed in relief as everyone began leaving. Only Ron remained, carrying the gifts upstairs and setting them neatly in the nursery. When he was done, he came back downstairs to see Draco standing with his hands pressed against the wall. Harry was standing behind him, rubbing his lower back with an anxious expression.
Draco turned and gathered Harry in his arms. His own eyes were damp as he listened to Harry weep. Ron and Hermione sat down nearby, watching their friend with pained eyes.
"I know," Harry relied. He eyed the blond thoughtfully. "I'm aware of your various... charitable activities."
Harry didn't look well. He seemed tired and there were dark circles under his eyes. He still had the muscular build of an auror, but he was starting to look a bit thin. His hair was even more disheveled than usual and he'd not bothered to shave in a few days. "You look like shite," Draco said bluntly.
"What did they do to me?" Harry asked with wide anxious eyes. He could feel that something was different. There was an odd pressure on his upper back. He turned his head to peer over his shoulder and let out a startled yelp.
Ron scowled, infuriated that Grant dared to speak to them. But, Grant was staring at the bundle in Ginny's arms.
"Not yet," Harry said, turning in Draco's hold to face Hermione. "I spoke with Robards and Kingsley. They've been trying to locate the grandparents and Maddie's aunt."
"Don't be stupid, Draco."
~~HPDM~~
“Shut up,” he responded, though he did chuckle.
It was unsettling, this need to be comforted by Harry Potter. Draco supposed it was due to the fact that, as far as as they knew, Harry was the only one in the world who could know what this was like. Harry was familiarity that Draco craved. He was safety and comfort.
Harry swallowed tightly, his eyes growing damp. He was so moved that he couldn't bring himself to speak just yet.
Draco's wings fluttered slightly at the praise. "Thank you. I like the color of yours. They suit you," he added lightly. He smothered a yawn with his hand.
"Oh Merlin," Harry moaned, hiding his red face against Draco's shoulder.
"I'll bring you some of mum's recipes," Ron said, eager to make up for his idiocy. "All bird-free."
"That's pretty much how it always is," Harry commented with a roll of his eyes.
"Though I'll allow that I was off with the gender," Trelawney admitted with a frown.
"Harry you don't need to do this because of the baby," Draco murmured.
Draco sighed. "I apologise for barging in like this," he muttered sheepishly. "I just couldn't stay there a moment longer, and I didn't feel comfortable going anywhere else. It's not as if these are inconspicuous," he added, gesturing toward his wings.
Ron watched anxiously as Hermione coaxed Draco into pushing the egg out. Ron was actually in the perfect position to watch it happen. The rounded edge of a pale bluish shell emerged from the straining flesh of the cloaca. Draco let out a sob, triggering a sob from Harry. Hermione's eyes were damp, but she kept up her encouragement and carefully rubbing the salve around Draco's tortured flesh.
Draco's laugh died abruptly in his throat and his gaze darted to Harry's face. They hadn't talked about that. Draco's pregnancy had been an accident, regardless of how they now felt about it. To deliberately have more children...
Draco scowled and pushed Harry away.  “I hadn’t expected such cruelty from you,” Draco hissed, aware that his eyes suddenly felt uncomfortably hot.  He would not give in to the ridiculous urge to cry.  “I was trying to preserve our friendship, but clearly that isn’t a concern of yours.”
Hermione bolted into the room with Ron at her heels. "Alright Draco, let's get through this together," she said with a calmness that Harry didn't believe for a second. But, the act seemed to fool Draco as he drew in a steadying breath. "Get up on your knees. We're going to use gravity to help you out."
Then, gifts were being placed at their feet. A peek at the labels would show that they were from families and individuals that they'd helped. There was nothing extravagant, but they were grateful and humbled. Kingsley then awarded each of them with an Order of Merlin, Second Class, for their contributions to society.
"Anyway," Ron said, giving Pansy a sour look, "I think they make a decent couple. Blaise isn't a bad bloke. Ginny seems happy."
"You think I'm too fat to socialize?" Draco suggested, folding his arms over his chest irritably.
For another hour, Hermione and Pansy observed Draco’s solicitous behavior toward Harry.  Harry was perfectly polite, but gave no indication of awareness.  The party was nearly over and Draco was becoming even more nervous.
"It's alright," Harry assured him. "You're welcome here. Why don't you stay? At least for a few days while your father gets over his tantrum. I really don't mind," he added with a genuine smile.
"Is that nice?" Harry chuckled.
"And, er- Congratulations Malfoy," Green said awkwardly.
Draco hummed as Harry kissed down his throat. "Is this weird?" Draco asked suddenly.
Harry was standing near the dessert laden table with his wand in his hand.  After a moment, Pansy realized that Harry was using a spell to move the mistletoe toward Draco.  “Oh Salazar,” Pansy whispered.  “That evil little bastard.”
Completely thrown off, Harry just nodded dumbly.
"That's very mature and supportive of you Ron," Draco noted with a nod.
"I think fatherhood would look quite decent on you as well," Draco noted with a little smirk. "When are you planning to contribute to the wizarding population?"
Maddie's face lit up with joy when Draco and Harry entered her hospital room. "You came!" she cried excitedly.
HPDM~HPDM
"It's alright," Auror Green said. "We'll track him down. He'll be easy to find."
"Calm down Weasley," Draco said. Of course, he said it with Harry's mouth.
"Er..." Harry had no idea what to think of that response.
"Yes," Draco nodded eagerly. "Whatever you're willing to give me." He sighed happily when Harry helped him to lay back, draping his wings over the edge of the nest.
"But you love chicken," Ron protested.
HPDM~HPDM
"We're not tearing into each other you insensitive troll," Draco growled, glaring at Ron. "We got a little distracted, but we're not mindless animals. And this is new," he added, dropping a kiss onto Harry's head. "No rush."
Harry stopped his stirring as Ron and Draco came in. He leaned down and pressed little kisses to the egg before kissing Draco's lips.
"It does," Draco agreed. "But, I've been wanting your hands and mouth on me since Ron interrupted us in the kitchen earlier. Surely you won't deny me." He shot Harry an expectant look as he climbed into their nest, completely naked.
Draco came hard, arching his back and pressing himself closer to Harry. Harry followed after just a few more thrusts, having the presence of mind to roll them into their sides to avoid squashing Draco.
"So Grant kills a bunch of people to get back at them? Nutter," Draco scoffed.
Ron leaned against the door frame, catching the end of the tender moment. "Alright Harry," Ron chided with a grin. "Let Draco eat his egg rolls. Then you can molest him, or whatever."
All three Malfoys remained at Harry's house while Pansy and Blaise went to see their own families. Weasley's popped over in small groups to spend a bit of time with Harry. Draco, Hermione and Ron had done a good job of coordinating and demanding exemplary behavior. There had been a lot of suspicious glaring between the Malfoys and Weasleys, but conversation had been shockingly polite.
"We used feathers, fabrics and other things to make it soft," Harry explained. "You won't feel the twigs at all."
"You didn't need to do all this," Harry said, watching Neville and Blaise carefully stack the gifts on the coffee table.
The sweet little voice made Hermione and Ron freeze and exchange a look of shock. They knew only one man named Draco.
"Where's the fun in that?" Draco scoffed playfully. "It's as if you don't know me at all."
"Alright, let's get out of here," Harry said, carefully tugging the cup from Draco's fingers. "I can't watch you like this."
Draco came hard, gasping for breath as he rode out his orgasm. His wings trembled around him. Harry followed him into bliss, his own wings flaring out wide.
Draco glanced away from the biscuit to stare up at Ron uncertainly. "I Daco," he said.
For a moment, they just looked at each other. Then Harry scooted closer, draping one arm to rest his hand on Draco's lower back. Draco nuzzled into Harry's neck, sighing softly. They didn't speak. They didn't move. The movie was completely ignored as they drifted to sleep, snuggled together.
“I’m going because he —” she gestured with the hand still clutching the wand, at me “has something he needs to say and no Draco, you can’t change that.”
“Are you sure?”
Scorpius, Malfoy’s eagle-owl was tapping on one of the tall windows into the common room. It was a warm Sunday morning and most people were out on the grounds. It was just myself and Harry in the common room, him finishing off a long history of magic essay and me helping him occasionally. It showed how much Ron and I had fallen out that I would as good as do Harry’s homework just to make him upset.
“Merlin.” I groaned and leaned against the wall with my face once more buried in my long-fingered hands.
“We have to save them!” I yelled to Hermione and Ron, wheeling around to return to the Slytherins.
Harry pulled Hermione close and whispered in her ear. A crease was between his elegant brows and he spoke quickly. I only caught a couple of words
I rotated the scroll until I fond words scribed on it. They were in Granger’s hand, exactly as before.
“How would you feel about meeting him.”
Living a mortal life after death is gives you a uniquely adapted view of the world. Its like when someone in your family dies and you return from the funeral with the strong urge to get your life together and do something good because you’ve come face to face with your mortality another time, but with the added knowledge of exactly how it’s going to be when you finally go. You come back knowing exactly how everyone felt when they realised they didn’t have one more minute to spend with you and that they never said what they had truly wanted. You come back knowing how much it hurt you to see their pain.
I had to do something but I was at loss as to what. There was only two options I could come up with and neither were even close to palatable. One: suck it up. Two: write to Hermione Granger.
I hugged him instead. “I’m sorry, I’m sorry, sorry, sorry…”
Saturday rolled around slower than usual. The homework load had increased and she had less time for the Amortentia. That wasn’t all bad as the potion did not need as much maintenance now but she would have preferred to be able to keep a more constant eye on it. That morning, she entered the room of requirement to administer the final ingredient to the potion: two drops of burlap sap. After which the potion would be ready in a few minutes. Once finished she bottled up the entire thing and sprayed some on her neck and hands. She was a weapon to destroy Ron now.
“Isn’t that Malfoy’s?” Harry asked, gesturing up at the owl, batting it’s wings to stay aloft and attacking the window with it’s cruel beak.
“That is so very cliché.” I said finally and she laughed.
I stopped and stared at her. “It’s bad enough that you know.”
“I — you — Harry. I’m wearing Amortentia. Malfoy, Amortentia.”
He hated me.
“Draco!”
“I’m sorry.” I put my hand on his shoulder. He didn’t react, not even to shrug me off. I couldn’t think of anything comforting to say. I hoped my silence meant something to him. I wasn’t sure if it did me.
Then I saw them—Malfoy and Zabini clinging to the top of what would soon be a raging bonfire heap of junk. Crabbe was gone.
Malfoy was looking at me now, confusion on his smudged face. “Destroy what?”
“I think it can be.”
He didn’t hate me.
“What’s right isn’t always what I want to do.”
“I know. I’m sorry.”
. I tried to make it cold and uncaring. I didn’t want her sending me letters. That was down right weird but then it was also a good way to get closer to Har — let’s just say I did not try very hard.
The next day, my eagle-owl landed on the table before me, spraying cornflakes over the people nearby. She held a scroll. This was not unusual, I always got letters from my mother but when I detached it and turned it over, it was not my mother’s large, loopy and elegant hand, bred from a long line of wealth, that had scribed:
I found myself needing to say something. To fill the space between us. The space between me and the death that awaited. “I failed. I was supposed to destroy it. After Nagini, it was the last one. They’re all going to die because I—because I failed.”
I didn’t give Hermione time to answer, I didn’t think she should have to. “I’m sorry, Potter. Don’t bother yourself, sorry for the inconvenience.” I hated myself but was relieved to have thrown off the situation.
He’d found me under the beech by the lake. It was pretty here but it held many memories of other fights or times of high tension within our group. It was, in a way, the outcast’s haven as much as it was the group retreat.
"Thank you so much for your help," Harry said sincerely.
Harry pulled back, soothing Draco with a little chirp before maneuvering around Draco's legs to get behind him. Draco relaxed, content to watch while Harry grabbed pillows and used them to support Draco's back and hips. Once he was sure Draco was comfortable, Harry grabbed their bottle of lubricant.
Luna heard a sound downstairs and went to investigate, returning shortly with Narcissa. "Oh my," Narcissa gasped, looking around at the beautifully decorated nursery.
"Really?" Harry asked.
"Bloody hell," Ron whispered, stopping next to Harry right as Robert Grant stepped around the bush, his eyes locked on the house.
“Stop hitting me you silly bint,” Hermione objected, slapping Pansy’s hand away.  The two young women watched eagerly as Harry walked up to Draco.  Draco looked nervous for a moment, but then his shoulders sagged a bit as he replied to whatever Harry said.  Harry walked away, leaving a disappointed Draco behind.
Draco carefully placed Harry in his best of people pillows and covered him with a blanket. On impulse, he brushed a soft kiss on Harry's forehead before slipping out of the room.
“You weren’t exactly subtle,” Tracy Davis informed her in a bored tone.
"Happy Christmas Minister," Harry replied. "You as well, sir," he added to Robards.
"I know!" Pansy gushed gleefully. "I could just die. "I popped over to his house a few days ago and caught them shagging each other silly." Ron shuddered.
Draco hadn't given much thought to having children. He was expected to produce an heir, but it wasn't a pressing issue. His career had taken priority. He was still young after all.
Harry reached out and wiped away Draco's tears. Draco kissed him and cuddled into Harry's chest with a sigh of contentment. They had a baby girl on the way and two sweet little boys. And as long as they were together, they could face anything.
After the war, Draco Malfoy had worked hard to make up for past mistakes.  He donated to worthy causes and made an attempt to be friendlier with his former rivals.  To everyone’s surprise, he had started with Harry Potter.  Harry had been wary at first, but he accepted Draco’s apology and after a few months they’d become friends.  They spent a great deal of time together.
Draco waited for a few moments and then shifted a bit, propping himself up on his right arm. He reached with his left hand and stroked down soft gray feathers.
Pansy feigned a look of astonishment.  “A hag, Draco?  See if I ever help you attain a sex life again.” She squealed and ducked when Draco threw a festive green dildo at her.
Pansy smiled indulgently.  “I’m glad you’re enjoying yourself Harry,” she said with a nod.
"What's the matter?" Draco asked, sitting down on one of the cushions so that his back rested against Harry's stomach.
"Of course," Hermione replied dismissively. "But, I prefer to be cautious."
"Shut up," Draco grumbled.
Several moments later, Pansy and Hermione were standing together again.  Ron had walked over to join Neville, Seamus and Dean to talk about Quidditch teams.
"He looks amazing," Ginny commented. "Leave it to Draco to still look disgustingly gorgeous at the end of pregnancy."
"I'm alright darling," Draco said with a watery laugh. "I just have the sweetest little boys on the world." More tears threatened as James hugged Draco's neck.
"Don't be silly," Hermione chided gently. "What do you have to be sorry for?"
Harry hesitantly dropped his hand to rest on Draco's stomach. "I'm here with you," Harry assured him. "I'm not going anywhere. I just want you to be happy. But..." He paused to take in a shaky breath. "I'd be lying if I said I didn't want this."
"Bastard," Blaise muttered, though he winked teasingly. Draco smirked.
"Yes," Ron chuckled. He'd never admit it out loud, but little Draco was absolutely adorable.
Hermione came in half an hour later, dusting herself off and shooting Draco a bright smile. "How are you feeling?" she asked him kindly.
Ron shook his head. He wouldn't bother trying to understand Pansy. Regardless of her accusations of Harry's stupidity, she was oddly fond of Harry. Ron could only assume that she was concerned for his well-being in her own way.
Once dressed, Harry took their egg in his arms and moved toward the door. Draco followed him down the stairs apprehensively.
Of all the people to be at his door, Harry would never have expected Draco Malfoy. The situation was only made more odd by the look of faint alarm that crossed Draco's features as his gaze swept over Harry. "Malfoy?" Harry said stupidly, his voice a bit rough.
Draco set down his teacup and stood up to stretch his wings. Perhaps a short flight and a kip in the sun would be nice. It would certainly improve his mood before his parents came over for dinner.
Ron stood up, balancing Harry on his hip, to move around Harry's desk and grab a biscuit from the tin that Harry kept in his office. Harry accepted the biscuit, the beginning of a smile tugging his lips upward.
"How would you two like to have a baby sister?" Draco asked, looking between his precious sons.
"That can't be easy," Harry commented. "Keeping such important information from your partner."
"Good morning Potter," Draco said politely. He waited for a moment while Harry stared at him. "May I come in? It's rather frigid out here, being December and all."
Kreacher nodded, but remained where he was. He was always keeping watch over Harry.
Draco set the little nest on an empty chair in the dining room and took a seat himself. Harry placed the egg down and covered it up with a blanket before moving to his own seat.
Harry nearly laughed but he stopped himself. "It'll be fine, darling," he said, squeezing his love's hand tenderly.
Harry's fame was occasionally to blame for the departure from the usual work day. On one memorable afternoon, some witch had managed to corner Harry in the lifts. She'd flirted aggressively and then pressed something soft into Harry's hand before stepping off on her floor. She gave him a heated look as the door shuddered closed. Harry had yelped when he realized he was holding a pair of knickers.
Draco responded by pulling Harry into a passionate kiss. He held Harry as closely as he could, enjoying the warmth. After a moment, Harry squeaked and pulled away. He was blushing profusely.
"At night, the sky get darker and little glowing stars appear," Harry explained, running one finger across the pale blue of the painted sky. "I thought I'd keep the theme gender neutral. Seemed like a good idea."
Hermione swallowed hard, motioning for Ron to follow her down the short hallway. She opened one of the doors and led the way inside, her eyes instantly seeking her patients.
Ron had sent his partner back to the minister to alert Head Auror Robards and Minister Kingsley. Most of the culprits had escaped. One of them had been caught by Ron, but he'd died within minutes. Ron knew that Robards was likely to be an arse about the whole thing. The dark wizards had gotten away. But Ron wasn't willing to risk losing two aurors, especially when one of them was his best mate.
"Obviously."
"I think Harry's right," Ron said abruptly. He moved closer to hesitantly pat Draco's shoulder. "You'll be no good to anyone like this. Better for you to be relaxed and safe at home." Ron turned to Harry. "I'll come round later and we'll strengthen the wards. Nobody will get into that house."
"The movie ended and they went home," Draco responded, smoothing down Harry's hair and making Harry hum in approval.
Draco complied and walked over to the bed, peering into Harry's haphazard creation. "How was it?" Draco asked.
Harry and Draco had been part of a team of aurors investigating a case regarding some missing wizards and witches. The victims had been turned into infants by a crazed witch with an unhealthy fondness for children. She'd splashed the potion on Harry and Draco before they could get her restrained. The de-aging process had taken an hour, but they'd at least made it back to the DMLE quickly before passing out. Ron had spotted them and pulled them into their office to avoid nosy onlookers. He had then watched over them as they had shrunk and the years were stripped away.
"Let's go in," Harry said, turning to go inside. "We'll have dinner and get you settled for the night."
Ron cackled and ran out as Draco sent a mild stinging hex at him.
Narcissa and Harry were keeping calm and chatting amiably. They got along remarkably well and Draco was grateful for that. They seemed content to ignore Lucius and the aggressive way he was eating his potatoes.
"Flying?" Draco asked eagerly.
Ron nodded his acceptance and offered a short wave before the elf grabbed hold of Harry and Draco, whisking them away.
"Well you heard the man," Draco said once Harry had closed their bedroom door. "Put up a silencing charm and get to work." He began pulling his clothes off unhurriedly while Harry blinked in surprise.
Draco smiled slightly, willing his racing heart to calm. "Would you like to look at it?" he offered shakily.
"He does mind, now leave it."
"An interview with yourself and Mr. Malfoy?" she asked.
Draco waved him on, watching eagerly as Harry apparated to the roof of the house. Draco held is wand up for Harry to see, indicating that he was ready to assist if it didn't go well. He watched with bated breath as Harry leapt into the air.
"If that's what he wants," Harry said slowly. "He seems content to stay here, and I'm glad to have him around. I think he just wants to feel that he hasn't lost his parents because of this."
"I appreciate it," Draco said lightly, reaching out to stroke the eggshell with delicate, loving fingers. He glanced away and spotted the blue tin on the counter. "What's this then?" he asked.
Draco's lips were pulled into a little pout as he eyed Ron with wide, watery gray eyes. His chubby little fingers were clutching at his office chair. His round cheeks were pink and Ron was horrified by the strange urge to pinch them lightly.
Draco relaxed a little, smiling slightly. He would have never guessed that he'd one day be rather fond of Ron Weasley. But the last several months had permanently altered his opinion of the red-head. Ron was protective of Harry and Draco even though he hadn't like Draco. He'd quietly supported their budding relationship because he'd wanted Harry to be happy. When they'd discovered the pregnancy, Ron had calmly set about making sure that Draco would be safe and comfortable. He might have originally been motivated by his love for Harry, but it had quickly turned into a genuine care for Draco. And though their child was still ensconced in an egg, Ron gleefully accepted his roll as godfather. Outside of Harry and Draco, only Ron had so far been privileged enough to hold the egg.
"Right here," Harry said, stepping out of the bathroom. He was dressed in a pair of black trousers and a white button down shirt. He was cradling their egg in his arms. It was a sight that Draco was sure that he would never tire of. Harry was going to be an amazing father.
Once the gifts had been exchanged, Kreacher served tea while they chatted quietly. "You're a very impressive young man, Mr. Potter," Narcissa said, smiling slightly at Harry.
"No!" Draco objected hastily.
Harry set Draco down and began removing the blond's clothing. "I'm going to shag you until you beg me to stop," he declared, lowering his head to suck a mark onto Draco's fair skin.
"Granger," Draco nodded. "Hello Weasley. Little Weasley," he added with a glance at Rose.
"It was Grant, but he's gone now," Ron answered. "I really don't think it's an Imperius," he added reluctantly.
Harry carefully placed the egg in the smaller nest and covered it. He straightened up and held one hand out to Draco with a loving smile. "Would you dance with me?" he asked shyly.
"Scorpius, will you dance with me?" Neville asked, holding his arms out for the little blond. He leaned close to Scorpius, as if to tell a secret, but he spoke loud enough for the others to hear. "I think your Papa really wants to kiss your Daddy right now."
Draco was breathing hard and shaking. His wings trembled. Without another word, we swept past his mother and went into the house, slamming the door as he went.
"What about the others?" Ron asked. "There are six more names on this list." He wrenched the hoods off of the wizards, checking each face and comparing it to the list he pulled out of his pocket. Then he froze. "Where's Grant?"
Finally, everyone left for their own homes. The house had been returned to his normal state aside from the pile of gifts that waited on the coffee table. But those could wait.
"Well don't," Harry said. "There's nothing wrong with needing this."
Harry nodded and then looked around his living room. "I need to make some changes," he said thoughtfully. "My furniture isn't made to accommodate wings. It's really difficult to sleep too. I just don't feel comfortable anywhere." Draco nodded his agreement.
Ron smiled slightly. Harry was surely in a lot of pain, but his first concern was the well-being of his partner. "He's sleeping in the other bed," Ron said soothingly. "Try not to move too much. Hermione will be back in a moment with a pain potion."
Outside, Draco gazed up at the cloudy skies. His feathers lifted and shivered with the breeze. Autumn had arrived and it seemed to be the perfect time to fly.
"How gracious of you, your majesty," Harry chuckled, grabbing his wand from under his pillow. A few charms left their mouths clean and their breath minty fresh. Satisfied, Harry set his wand aside and rolled Draco onto his back before stretching himself out over the blond's body. His weight pressed Draco into the matress as they kissed languidly.
"Alright," Green said calmly. "We'll get them to the ministry and interrogate them."
Harry heard a sharp gasp and instantly remembered that he wasn't the only victim of the prank. He lifted his eyes to his partner's desk warily.
He pulled me through some shortcuts I hadn’t seen before until we were two floors and many corridors past the site of our encounter with Mrs Norris.
Well either way, none of that was on my mind then.
He had every right to be angry, hurt, but he continued calmly. I didn’t miss the way his voice trembled at the end. “Maybe not for your side but my mother is still out there.”
I looked up from my hands. Scorpius had flown down through one of the vents and shafts that let in the only sunlight into the dungeon common room. All of the common room windows looked into the dark depths of the lake where we would see the giant squid and other mysterious creatures drifting lazily by. I personally preferred the dorms where the windows out into the air, just inches from the water.
She stopped herself and instead asked. “Why? What would I do with that information?”
Walking down the corridor Hermione met Cormac McLaggen. She been on a date with him once but only to annoy Ron. He knew full well that it was over.
To late, the moment was over but she beamed at me all the same.
I looked up at her from my place on the chill stone floor. “You are the most knowledgeable of us all. Don’t look at me like that. It’s true.”
“What?”
He sighed and draped and arm around my shoulder. “Fine, don’t tell me but that won’t stop me trying to make it better.” He pulled me close. “You matter to me Hermione.”
She marched off, head high. This would be fun.
“There are some things you can’t fix. You have to wait for someone else to do it for you or for it to do it itself.”
Harry sighed. His potions essay, due in the next class, was still unfinished. “No?”
“Okay.”
“Draco! Wait!” She seized my elbow and dragged me around to face her. I pulled my arm out of her grip.
He opened his mouth as if to say something but shut it again. Instead he gave a curt nod.
“Why?”
I stepped back again, keeping my hands up. “Yes. Yes, I probably am.” I couldn’t believe myself.
He hated me.
“The bloody horcrux! Fucking tiara!” My breaths were taken by sobs now and new tears burn trails down my cheeks.
I stepped back and held up my hands. “I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.”
He looked taken aback. “What?”
“You’re a coward!” He screamed and his arms wrapped around Hermione. He pulled her close to him but never let his wand fall. It aimed at my heart.
“No it’s not like that!”
“What?”
“Oh, you’re probably right. Don’t bother yourself I’ll get it.” He said. I’d begun to get up but I could not refuse; he’d suspect me of something. I just hoped that Malfoy hadn’t written anything but
“Oh good. I was worried you’d left.”
I scoffed and turned over the parchment before Crabbe or Goyle could see. I took a quill from my bag and quickly scratched out a reply just below her
I had noticed something different about Granger lately. Students would crowd around her in the corridors and at the library. What was going on with her? He’d even seen some Slytherins in the throng around her.
“Don’t do what’s easy, Draco, you should do what’s right. Be brave even when it is hard or frightening. That is the way to Harry, I think.”
I cringed at saying it again but his eyes were on me. I had to. “I
“Sorry!” She gasped, “so sorry!” Her shoulders and bushy hair shook with silent hysterical giggles.
“You matter to Ron too. He’s just too stubborn to admit it.”
His smile lit up the world.
Over the next two weeks it got horribly annoying. Students everywhere would try to drop hints at their love for her or ask her on dates but Ron was not among them. He never got close enough anymore to smell the potion on her. She was so angry at him. She had tried walking as close to him as possible without being suspected. She would pass near his seat in the Great Hall or take longer routes to the girls dormitory so she could walk near the chair he was sitting in but still nothing. It made her want to punch something.
She pecked my hand until I released her from the thick scroll, then flew away without hesitation. I wondered what had got her feathers in a knot. I hoped I wouldn’t have to reply this evening; Scorpius was not in the mood for cooperation.
Ron and Zabini were already meters ahead, pelting towards the door after Hermione as I passed Malfoy again, this time catching his hand and dragging him up behind me.
I don’t know why I sent it. I should have destroyed it myself. What if it was intercepted? Did I actually trust Hermione that much? It could destroy the Malfoy’s yet further. We could all end up in the grave tomorrow. At least I didn’t say my job. At least I didn’t ask for help, to be let free of this.
“I know, Draco.”
“You could” She said very slowly, “but Harry Potter is my best friend.”
I blushed and ducked my head to hide it. She gave me a half smile then continued.
I waited for it to take flight before getting up and swaggering out. I hoped I’d never get a response.
“‘It will help’! No! He hates me!” I glowered at her. “Why do you want me to meet him? If it works, you’re eliminating your influence in this bargain. If it doesn’t, I am obliged by the terms of our agreement to spill your secret.”
My vision began to swim and I realised just how long it had been since I took a breath. The broom was spiralling and all I saw before my eyes fell closed was the looming face of a dragon in the flames.
“You wanted talk?”
“Because I think we’re better than that now. We’re friends, aren’t we? We shouldn’t have to have an agreement to hold this relationship together.”
I got a reply less than a half hour after the letter was sent. There was something thrilling about this illegal interaction and friendship that was developing.
I was frozen still. “I —”
“I’m sorry too.”
“Will you do it?”
“What did you mean?”
Despite the heat, I was shaking and quite unable to stop. My breaths were coming in uneven gasps. I had never really considered whether or not I was scared to die, the strong-standing fact that I had to survive having well and truly dismissed it as an option. Though I suppose everyone is a little scared to die when it comes time. Malfoy certainly was.
“I didn’t mean that.”
I couldn’t process, he was too close.
“Malfoy?”
“I like you.” I blurted. All the words stringing together.
“Hello, Hermione.” He sidled up beside her. “Isn’t it a pretty day. Fancy a walk around the lake.” The Amortentia must be acting on him. If it worked on McLaggen, she had Ron in the bag.
“Are you mental?” Ron shrieked. I probably was.
“No I can’t!”
There was a book of potions on a table by the cauldron and on the first page was Amortentia. The love potion that smelled different to everyone, that smelled of the thing they loved most. The potion to get back at Ron.
I pushed closer and I caught a familiar but wild and powerful scent. “You’ve gathered yourself a crowd. I didn’t know wearing Potter-purfume made you so popular.”
“Well about Harry.”
“Draco.” Blaise’s voice of thick timbre and deep resonance broke through the downward spiral of death and loss and pain, to me. “Draco, your owl.”
I was at the hunchback witch a few minutes before Hermione got there.
“Well it doesn’t fucking matter now does it?”
you.”
Soon enough it was clear that we were lost. I knew Malfoy could feel it too, the way his hands were tightening and twisting in the back of my shirt a clear sign. The smoke was thickening and the air shimmered with the heat.
I raised the wand I’d won from him and cast my own protection charm.
Her response did not come until two days later. I was so terrified that it had in fact been taken, that it had never gotten to her at all or maybe it had but she was using it against me. When it came, relief flooded me.
would get suspicious.”
“Protego!” The flames rebounded off the barrier as it formed around us. Malfoy was shaking with the power of the fire as he struggled to maintain the shield.
“I can’t lose anyone else…” I don’t know why I said it. I didn’t have the right to explaining myself. Those five words, fading off weakly, did a piss poor job of it anyway.
I attached the scroll back onto Scorpius’ leg and murmured so only she could hear. “To Granger.”
“It will help you and then we can work out some way of hiding it.”
“I can’t tell you.” I stammered. He moved closed and engaged the full force of his green eyes on me. It was the kind of look that was hard to refuse and he knew it.
“It’s for you.” He said, inspecting the handwriting and parchment. “Someone with a posh hand.” He handed it to me and watched carefully as I unrolled it.
“Amortentia is against school rules. I could get you expelled.”
“Get off me, mudblood!”
.” I could feel the tips of my ears growing warm. I began to pace. “Oh. No. Oh shit
The guilt thumped into my gut.
“Easy for you to say.”
“That raging inferno trying to kill us? Fiendfyre. It’s one of the few known ways to destroy a Horcrux.”
“Sorry, Seamus and Dean were having a debate and they kept asking me to make sure the other’s arguments were factually correct. I have no idea why they needed me, it was mostly common knowledge.”
“Hermione!” Harry picked up the tails of his essay once more. What was wrong with her?
In that moment, with the fire leaping below us and a battle raging beyond the walls, I would never have expected to find peace but in Draco’s arms, nothing in the world could get me. I was safe.
By the time I’d regained speed and balance on the broom, Ron was out of my sight and Hermione was long gone. I sped in what I hoped was the direction the others had gone.
“Sorry!” She said again but she seemed to have quelled most of her laughter. “It’s just — I wouldn’t have guessed it.”
“I’m a coward and — and an underserving prat.”
We wouldn’t—couldn’t—get out now.
“Oh yes it is. How does it go with you two? Oh, I bet you both complain to each other in your shared free periods! ‘Oh Ron, I wish Hermione would just leave me alone!’, ‘Yeah. She’s completely mental.’ I get it! Have fun with your essay!” She stalked across the common room and pushed through the portrait hole.
“You did say you thought I was right.”
I fell backwards against Malfoy, exhausted. I was still trembling even through the heat and smoke was an insistent burning in my chest. I knew I should be trying to find a way out—There was a battle out there!—but I couldn’t think. It was all fuzz and panic between my ears. The heat certainly didn’t help. That was why it took my so long to realise what I had done. I was leaning on my nemesis.
“Just speak, woman, or I’m going right back to my breakfast!”
My death gave me the what I needed to run after him.
but a cramped but neat scrawl. I unrolled it and pinned it open with the sugar bowl.
“For you probably.” I sprawled against the base of the statue and shifted around until I was comfortable.
She stewed over Lavender in increasing annoyance just as the potion stewed in the cauldron. All the ingredients she needed were here and it wasn’t too complicated. Just time consuming. It would give her time away from the boys anyway. Harry was getting to her nearly as much as Ron now.
Hermione disentangled herself from Harry and threw her arms around me. I was frozen still. Should I hug her back or —
I turned and walked away. He hated me. There was no point trying.
“Draco?” Harry croaked, adjusting his round glasses.
“How do I know? Horcruxes are dark magic. I’m a pureblood. I thought it would be obvious.”
I wrote to Hermione Granger.
“What Malfoy?”
“First, stop using the Amortentia.”
“Yes, Potter. I have no idea Crabbe could create something so powerful but he has. It’s clear he has.” He held the tiara out over the drop below us. “Shall I?”
I stared at the letter for a long time after reading it. She was overstepping a line I so clearly laid out in bright, obnoxious paint and I wasn’t sure how to react. Who did she think she was? I pulled out parchment from my bag and began to write back.
Harry sighed happily. No relationship was a guarantee, but he had a good feeling about this one. They'd been building up a lasting friendship and Draco was worth the risk.
~~HPDM~~
Harry sat in stunned silence. He wasn't sure what to think of this revelation.
In the next moment, Neville and Blaise tumbled through the floo and the other aurors rushed through the door. In a flash, they joined the fray and the dark wizards were quickly subdued.
"You're good at that," Harry noted.
They returned home and set about decorating for Christmas. While Harry was spelling sparkling baubles onto the tree, Draco was hovering nervously in the doorway. He looked down at the sprig of mistletoe in his hands. He drew in a deep breath and reached up to attach the mistletoe to the doorframe, directly over his head.
"No, Pansy told them," Draco said, rolling his eyes. "But, no matter. It's far less anonymous than it was, since I visit the hospital personally."
"What do you need so much chocolate for?" Ron asked curiously.
The Malfoy-Potters remained at the reception until the sky began to grow dark. James and Scorpius had cuddled up in their fathers' arms, unwilling to dance or socialize any longer. Their fuzzy wings drooped in their fatigue and the boys were cooing sleepily as they nuzzled against their parents.
Hermione bit her lip. "The change nearly killed both of you," she admitted, wincing at the blond's horrified expression. "It will take some time to determine if we can remove the bird DNA. We don't want to kill you."
The most difficult part so far was figuring out how to get through his house without breaking everything. He could repair things with a spell, but he'd prefer not to look like a clumsy oaf.
Hermione sighed. "I can't accurately predict the gestation period," she said. "Once the egg has reached it's full size, it will... come out," she said with a nervous flap of her hands. "After that, we wait for the fetus to finish developing."
After long moments, Harry lifted his head. "It shouldn't be like this," he muttered brokenly. "The war has been over for more than three years. I should be able to keep it together."
"You have no idea," Harry muttered. He set his plate down and glanced around suspiciously, as if he thought Kreacher would be spying on him. "So you came over just to apologize and have tea?"
Harry struggled out of his shirt and hastily began adjusting his nest of pillows to make room for Draco while Draco eagerly removed his own clothing. This was easier said than done since Draco had decided that it was a good time to press warm wet kisses to the bare skin on Harry's back. Harry moaned but managed to keep working.
"The egg is very fragile," Harry explained, giving Molly an apologetic look. "Our instinct is to guard it. At first, Ron was really the only person who could hold it. We're less bothered by it now but... Draco doesn't know you well."
"That's great," Harry said softly. "But, I can't come. I-"
"Not so far," Harry replied with a grin.
Harry complied quickly, his arms trembling. He gasped as Draco slowly entered him, pausing frequently to let Harry adjust.
"Nothing we can do," Ron replied with a tired sigh.
Smirking, Draco ran his hands slowly over his chest. Then he paused, a curious look on his face. He brushed his fingers over the nipples again.
~~HPDM~~
Draco couldn't think of a good response to that statement. He could see Pansy's lips trembling as she attempted to resist laughing. Hermione was squinting at Luna a bit suspiciously.
Draco gaped at her. "It's none of your business, you little tart," he hissed. Harry snorted.
"Don't hurt yourself there Lucy," Harry smirked.
Harry sighed quietly, relieved when people moved out of the way so they could go on their way. Nobody had seemed hostile, but their demanding sort of curiosity had been unsettling. Harry had been prepared to force his way through if he had to, but the Daily Prophet would have published some ridiculous article able he and Draco being aggressive and dangerous after their transformation.
Draco shoulders slumped just slightly in disappointment.  Luckily, Pansy was quick to step in.  “He doesn’t know what he’s missing darling,” Pansy said, seizing Draco’s hand and pulling him toward the other dancers.
“Harry spotted the mistletoe and he’s heading toward Draco,” Pansy gasped, swatting at Hermione’s arm frantically.
"That's completely different," one woman objected, looking scandalized.
Draco had already agreed to marry him. This was just a matter of timing and planning. Did he really need the huge dramatic event that Malfoys usually had? No. He only needed Harry.
"No," Ron said firmly, cutting Harry off. "I'm going to make a team to handle this. You two are going to stay home and take care of my godchild. If one of you lost the other, you'd never fully recover. I'll be fine."
"It's alright," Harry chuckled. "Draco is beautiful."
"What happened?" Ron asked weakly.
"It's alright," Draco said, grateful for the consideration. "Weasley can stay. I don't mind." Ron offered him an encouraging smile and Harry relaxed slightly.
Harry cringed at the angry voice, whimpering softly. Draco glared at the newcomer.
The months that followed were as hectic as one might imagine with three young children. Grimmauld Place was deemed unsuitable for raising children and Harry didn't feel comfortable with Malfoy Manor, so Draco bought a house that was still too large but it made Harry happy.
"What's all this?" Narcissa asked, bewildered.
Ten minutes later, Draco and Harry said goodbye to Trelawney and headed back toward McGonagall's office. "You look traumatized," Draco noted, grinning at Harry.
"Draco, that egg was still inside you three days ago," Harry reminded him, reaching out to stroke soft white feathers. "Plus, there's this madness with those dark wizards... To me, it makes sense that you're feeling anxious about our egg. It seems natural for you to want to hold it so much. It's our baby in there."
They fell silent as Draco stirred and opened his eyes. His movement woke Harry as well.
“Yes,” Pansy replied, with a dismissive wave of her hand.  “Aren’t you lucky?  He didn’t even bother with my favorite dessert, and I helped him set up the party.”
"I beg your pardon, your highness," Harry retorted sarcastically. To his surprise, Draco laughed.
The pounding of footsteps was heard and then Hermione and Pansy appeared throwing hexes over Draco's shoulders. They were careful to avoid his wings as they stubbornly continued to block the stairs.
"A bit," Draco admitted, running his fingers over the railing of the crib. "This is amazing."
Their other friends had been suitably shocked by the news. But they'd quickly offered their congratulations. Ginny and Pansy were excited about the prospect of buying baby clothes.
"Is Harry asleep?" Ron asked incredulously once the telly was shut off.
"But you're going to," Draco pushed, raising his eyebrows expectantly.
"It's perfect," Harry said softly. He met Draco's gaze. "I love you."
"You made a nest?"
"Wonderful," Draco said cheerfully. Harry found himself thinking that cheerful Draco wasn't so bad to listen to. "I'll see you tomorrow." Just before closing the front door, Draco offered Harry another slight smile. "It was really nice to see you Potter."
Hermione pressed on his stomach carefully, her hands drifting over the skin slowly. "I think you're ready," she said. "It feels really firm today. I'd guess as early as tonight. Maybe tomorrow."
"I love you so much," Harry murmured. "There's nobody that I'd rather spend my life with." He guided Draco's head lower to press a reverent kiss to his forehead. "Draco, will you marry me?"
Harry's face lit up. "Really?" he asked excitedly. When Draco nodded, Harry hopped out of the nest and ran to the closet. He emerged a moment later carrying two sets of dress robes and handed one to Draco. "Put that on," he instructed, setting about putting on his own robes.
Satisfied that Draco would be comfortable, Harry went to his own room. He frowned at his bed. He'd taken to sleeping with an abundance of pillows to be comfortable. But he still didn't feel quite right.
"That's stupid," Draco pointed out.
"He's not going to," Ron said suddenly.
Harry read over Rita's notes carefully. "Four of these names are ministry workers," he noted. "Aside from Grant of course."
"No," Draco argued. "I think you've been traumatized by the war and you're depressed. There's no shame in seeing a mind healer. The mind is part of the body, and it's capable of illness. But you can heal."
Kingsley seemed to sense Harry's discomfort. "We'll do whatever we can to make this easier," he said.
"That's what you want?" Draco asked.
Draco was approaching Harry and carrying two wine glasses.  “Would you like some elf-made wine?” Draco asked.
Draco pressed at the egg carefully, watching it give and crack a bit more. Harry reached over and slid his fingers along one crack until he found a spot loose enough to slip one finger inside. He tugged a bit, pulling some of the shell loose. Now that there was a little hole, Draco began opening the shell in earnest. He gave a little cry and reached into the egg.
"I- I don't-" Draco cut himself off, willing himself not to panic.
Harry groaned, urging Draco toward their new nest. The rest of their clothing was tossed aside and the climbed in, pressing their bodies together.
Harry and Draco seemed to be oblivious to their friends until they'd had their fill of cake. The bill was paid and Draco declared that they needed to all go out together more often. And then he was pulling Harry close and apparating them back to the house.
"All right lads," he said briskly. "Time to take out the trash as the muggles say. We're gonna have fun with this one," he added sneering at Grant. "We don't appreciate someone that'll turn against one of our own. You'll regret your treachery."
Pansy released Draco and gave a joyful cry. Harry's eyes were open and focused tenderly on his husband.
Ron grasped Harry's shoulders and pulled him upright harshly. It startled Harry out of his manic laughter. "Get it together," Ron commanded sternly.
"Actually, I'm prepared to offer an incentive," Harry replied.
Ron nodded, looking back to the parchment. Rita had listed names and locations for meeting places. Toward the bottom of the parchment, Rita had noted that the wizards had wanted to collect Harry and Draco for study, dead or alive.
The woman started at Harry, her eyes widening in recognition. "Harry Potter and his boyfriend want to adopt my grandchildren," she said faintly.
Ron's felt a wave of nausea when he saw a few healers cleaning up blood from the walls. Bright red was splattered up the white walls and on the floor. Harry's face was unusually pale as he rested on his side.
"And that woman is... ferocious in bed," Ron blurted out, his face as red as his hair.
"How?" Ron asked warily.
Kingsley slipped away to hold back the reporters that were, no doubt, harassing his poor secretary for information. If Pansy had been aware of an incident, then there was sure to be a herd of rabid reporters waiting to snap up all the details they could find.
That evening, Harry and Draco went to St. Mungos to visit with Maddie. They were accompanied by Lucius and Narcissa.
Before Draco could argue, Harry kissed him again.  Their tongues met in a gentle brush and Harry moaned while pressing Draco’s back into the wall.  Draco was delighted by this development, but he was still the host of the party.
"It is an honor and privilege to know their family," Kingsley went on. "So, today we honor them in return. On behalf of Wizarding Britain, thank you both."
"That's grooming, not mating," Pansy said helpfully, selecting a seat for herself. She pulled Ron down to sure next to her and propped her feet up in his lap. Ron shot her a look of amusement but didn't protest. He was far too curious about bizarre bird behavior.
Harry swallowed hard, nodding. He reached out and gave Draco's hand a reassuring squeeze. "What do we need to know?" he asked Hermione.
Harry grimaced but leaned closer to whisper in Draco's ear.  Draco gasped sharply, blushing even more.  Harry was relieved that Draco didn't demand further explanation.  He didn't care to discuss his topic in front of their friends.  Pansy seemed to be enjoying far too much already.
Maddie fully recovered from being poisoned and, though she still missed her mother, was a very happy child. She had adorably requested to call Draco Father, as that's what he called his own father. At first he thought it would seem too formal, but Maddie said it with such love that he decided not to worry over it. With Harry, she alternated between Harry and Daddy. Harry gladly answered to both.
Draco nodded almost frantically as Harry leaned in to press their lips together. It was gentle and sweet and Draco felt like his brain might melt. His limbs trembled with relief as he reached up to cradle Harry's face and deepen the kiss.
"Don't be such a prude," Pansy retorted. "It's a simple enough question."
Ron had done a decent job of tolerating Draco at work. And he got by with mostly ignoring Pansy when she popped by the DMLE. But having them invade his space outside of work seemed to be asking too much of him.
on the outside.
“Hermione!” He dropped his quill and stared at her. “We’re still on about this?”
“Perhaps but what’s your answer?” She prodded me in the arm as she asked her question.
He began to move. My heart jumped into my throat. I tried to pull reasonable apologies out of the cotton wool filling my skull but I couldn’t comprehend a single thought through the drumming in my chest.
“What?” He asked.
Why was he apologising? He wasn’t even close to being in the wrong here. But being the coward I always accused him of, I couldn’t even begin to put that into words for him.
“I can’t destroy it without the basilisk fang Ron has."
“Draco.” She said but she said it like she’d meant to say something different and with a very final full stop.
It exploded in black oozing smoke with the high scream of the soul dying. The flames rippled and convulsed around it, spewing three heads. All of them Voldemort. They charged at us, the scream growing louder.
"It was a prank," Harry retorted looking down at the paleness of his hands in shock. He was quickly distracted by the sight of Draco's bare chest.
Harry relented with one last kiss. He rolled over and got out of bed before pulling Draco to his feet. They took turns in the shower and warmly for the day. When they got downstairs, they realized that Kreacher had prepared a full English breakfast.
Draco was similarly distracted. He looked down at the body he was occupying, his eyebrows raised. Harry was fit. He wasn't overly bulky but he had a pleasing layer of firm muscle. There was the barest dusting of hair on his chest. "Not bad Potter," Draco commented, running his hands across a taut abdomen.
And so the plot to become hybrids was born. They wanted to harness the abilities of a veela with the powers of a wizard. The experiments with potions had been mostly unsuccessful until they'd begun using a very dark ritual to bind the essence of two beings together. But the veela blood didn't mix properly with wizard blood outside of normal conception. They were left to try something else.
"Spread out," Ron said quietly. "We can't let them escape." He was hunched behind a large clump of bushes with a team of six trustworthy aurors and Kingsley. In the nearby clearing, another ritual was taking place. "It's not all of them, but we can capture these nutters and bring their numbers down.
"I was thinking we could all pay her a visit tomorrow," Ron suggested. "Small groups come in for presents and whatever sweets we can sneak in."
Hermione entered a moment later, carrying two vials. "You're awake," she sighed, looking relieved. She reached out and tipped Harry's head back to help him drink the potion. She stroked his hair gently while the potion took effect. When his face relaxed, she withdrew her hand.
Harry marched across the lawn, a warm breeze ruffling his feathers. He felt the comforting hum of magic from the wards as he approached the boundary. He stopped, looking around and listening until he heard rustling from a bush the sat just outside the wards.
Draco bit his lip. "We do," he corrected quietly. "This baby is as much yours as mine."
Draco stared at him in wonder. All those months ago, he'd decided to give Harry the romance he deserved. But, Harry had done the same in return.
"We'll wait outside," Pansy said, leaving the couple with their egg, Ron and Hermione. "We'll inform the Weasley's and your parents," she told Draco before shutting the door.
"Harry..." Draco began.
"You're being ridiculous."
Harry dropped his wand arm in relief. "Sorry," he murmured sheepishly. "I felt something come through the wards. Didn't realize it was you."
“Pansy you… you hag!” Draco snapped, flustered.
“Oh Merlin,” Harry gasped.
But now, his plans had been changed. It may not have been his choice, but he didn't regret it. He couldn't. Suddenly, Draco couldn't imagine having a child with anyone else. He was looking forward to holding his baby. He was still annoyed that his gender had been tampered with, but he could live with it.
"I have to be here when the egg comes," Pansy insisted.
"Are there changes aside from the wings?" Harry asked warily.
Draco blushed. "Frankly, I'm not certain of how anyone can resist you," he said. He bit his lower lip. "I'd love to continue keeping you company. Whatever you need."
Draco motioned for Harry to come around the bed. Once Harry was close enough, Draco reached out and trailed his fingers down soft gray feathers. He smiled smugly when Harry's eyes slid closed and he cooed softly.
The ceremony was brief but sweet. Harry pulled out the little box again and carefully slid one of the rings onto Draco's finger. Draco did the same for Harry, marveling at the glittering diamond wings. When Kingsley prompted them, Harry pressed his lips to Draco's tenderly, both of them weeping tears of joy.
Draco collapsed onto Harry's couch the moment the elf let go of him. Harry sat down next to him, yawning tiredly. Harry switched on the television, flipping through the channels until he found something interesting to watch. Setting aside the remote, he summoned a lovely quilt from another room and draped it over himself and Draco.
The man's wife had died shortly after the birth of twin boys. He'd begun slowly poisoning his step-daughter with a very rare potion, disguising the effects as a mysterious illness that baffled healers.
It was lucky that they'd grown to enjoy working together. The numerous bizarre situations they found themselves would have driven Draco to request a different partner otherwise.
"It's probably because of his rubbish relatives," Ron grumbled. "He was affection starved. Even this young," he added sadly. "He's pretty affectionate when he's dating, though he hasn't done much of that lately."
Kingsley waited until Harry nodded at him to continue. "Malfoy Senior is threatening legal action against the DMLE," he said somberly. "He's making accusations of negligence and incompetence, claiming that his noble bloodline has been compromised."
"He's not worried about me," Draco snapped, pulling away. "He doesn't want the Malfoy name sullied with a half-breed. I could be stuck like this for the rest of my life and he's throwing a tantrum about the bloodline. This transformation nearly killed me!"
Draco grinned and spun them around to push Harry into the wall.  He pressed their bodies together, smiling at Harry’s flustered expression.  Draco brushed one hand down Harry’s side before sliding it between them and pressing his palm to Harry’s crotch.  He was pleased to feel Harry growing firm beneath him.  “Why don’t we enjoy the rest of the party, and then you can put this to good use,” Draco said, giving Harry’s erection a teasing squeeze.
"Daydreaming?" Harry asked stepping into the room.
Ron nodded in understanding as Harry returned to cooking. Ron smiled when he saw Draco leaning against the counter, holding the egg, carefully swaddled in a blanket, close to his chest. "Does that egg ever spend any time in its nest?" Ron questioned.
Draco was struggling to come to terms with everything. It was a lot to take in. Before being rushed to the hospital, he recalled feeling the compulsion to clean everything and fix his nest. The nests that he and Harry made no longer seemed suitable. He was tired and dizzy, but he couldn't relax because of the damn nest. He now knew that it was his instincts prompting him to nest for his unborn child. But the knowledge didn't make it any less tempting to resume his frenzy from before.
"Brilliant actually," Harry responded, stetching languidly. "I just had this strange sort of... urge to make this. So I did and it's amazing how much better I felt."
"Sorrow," Trelawney said sadly, staring into the bottom of Harry's teacup solemnly. She glanced at his upturned hand with pursed lips. "But, love is in your future. How lovely. Shall I consult the beyond with my crystal? I'm sure she's beautiful."
Draco wriggled out of Harry’s grasp, breathless with laughter.  “You great buffoon,” Draco chuckled fondly.  He shook his head.  “It’s a good thing that I like you so much.”
"We'll still have to wait for the hatching," Draco pointed out.
"Nothing," Draco assured him. "It's just-" He bit his lip, his wings fluttering. "I'd like to top this time. Would that be alright?"
Draco had been out with a few different wizards recently, but he hadn't been interested in pursuing any of them further. As far as Pansy knew, Harry was single and had been for some time. She imagined that he had concerns about people wanting to be with him for his fame and accomplishments.
"You're afraid," Harry replied, gathering Draco into his arms. "I am too. Those instincts are there for a reason. The fear is completely justified and I certainly don't blame you for it. I'll keep you safe, just as I know that you'll do the same for me."
"What's wrong with him?" Draco asked.
"That goes well with this," Narcissa said, handing Draco a squishy package in silver paper. He opened it to find a pale green blanket that was pleasantly soft and warm. "It mimics your body heat," Narcissa explained. "When you're not holding your egg, this blanket will keep it appropriately warm."
"You're gorgeous," Harry insisted. "I love this," he added, lovingly caressing the swell of his lover's abdomen.
Before Draco could question further, Ron and Hermione came through the floo. Their smiles fell when the saw Harry's face. "What's wrong Harry?" Hermione asked.
Harry blushed at the endearment and happily allowed Draco to lead him across the room to the Christmas tree.  Pansy took the lead and handed out the gifts that had been gathered under the tree, leaving Harry and Draco to watch the proceedings.  Draco shifted to stand just behind Harry and wrapped his arms around Harry’s torso.  Harry brought his hands up to brush his fingers over Draco’s knuckles.
After a few minutes, one of the healers walked in with Robards, Kingsley and an older woman. This was obviously the grandmother.
It wasn't the eating itself that had Harry so enthralled though. In just under two month's time, Draco's abdomen had enlarged impressively. He looked to be at least eight months pregnant.
"Is this the best time to be fondling yourself?" Draco snapped.
Hermione tactfully looked away, admiring the lovely nursery. They'd really done a beautiful job with it.
Draco nodded his acceptance, earning a loving kiss from Harry. He smiled into the kiss when he felt Harry's hands creep up his shirt to caress his abdomen.
“I didn’t tell anyone,” Pansy objected indignantly.
"I'm so happy for you," Ginny said, smiling widely. "You seem like an amazing couple. Who would have thought?" she giggled.
"Get out of my office," Draco demanded.
Hermione stood to one side, unsure if it would be wise to interrupt the bizarre feather preening. Apparently they would have instincts to contend with. Hopefully this wouldn't decline into weird bird fights over "territory". Some male birds could be quite territorial, and Hermione had no idea what Harry and Draco would be like.
When James was a year old, they welcomed a second son to the family. Little Scorpius had Harry's green eyes but Draco's fair compexion and blond hair.
Draco merely smirked at her and held the small plate out to Harry.  “The house elves forgot to set this out,” Draco explained.  “There’s more at the table but this is for you.”
“Thanks mate,” Harry murmured gratefully.  His smile widened when Draco relaxed his grip and held his hand out to Ron.  Harry watched the two shake hands, overwhelmed with joy.  It was turning out to be the best Christmas that Harry had ever experienced.
"I only wanted you to be aware of this," Kingsley said. "I'd prefer for you to hear about it from me. You do, of course, have my greatest sympathy for your circumstances. Robards regrets not sending a larger team in."
Draco felt a little strange. He was horribly tired and annoyed for no real reason. He felt too hot and a little dizzy. He didn't mention it to Harry because he didn't want to worry his boyfriend. Harry would insist on a thorough exam with Hermione. Surely fatigue and irritability were nothing to be concerned over. And Hermione's examinations were awkward at best. At worst, rather humiliating.
Hermione laughed. "They're not all like that," she responded. "I like the fantasy of it. Dreaming of finding someone that loves you and wants to do a bunch of silly things to show their love. Snogging in the rain, dancing in the street... Who wouldn't want to be adored by someone?"
"Thank you," Harry said sincerely while Draco ran his fingers over the fabric thoughtfully.
Harry choked on his tea. He set his cup aside, coughing and sputtering.
"No," Harry replied.
"There were too many," Draco went on. "Harry got hit by some awful curse right before you got here. It happened so fast we..." He trailed off, his body shaking with sobs.
Harry sighed and rolled his eyes. "Forgive me," he said flatly. "I don't usually serve tea to people that hate me. Did you just come here to make bizarre and unreasonable demands?"
Behind her, Blaise choked on his champagne.
Harry sighed, returning to his desk to begin his paperwork. His memory of his brief time as a toddler was quite hazy. It was rather muddled with his memory of the Dursleys and the sudden return of his other memories. The dizziness still hadn't subsided and he wondered briefly if he was going to be sick.
"Think we should see Hermione?" Harry asked reluctantly. It seemed responsible to at least ask, though Harry was going to do everything in his power to avoid the hospital.
"In the world," Neville corrected with a grin.
It did make sense. Draco had gone to Kingsley when he had decided to help those that were less fortunate. Raised as he was, Draco hasn't the first look where to start, but the ministry would have records of each wizarding family. He wanted his efforts to be more personal than charity donations. Kingsley had been surprised, but had giving Draco some names to start with.
Narcissa nodded slowly. "And when can I expect to meet my grandchild?" she asked.
"Just tell me. Harry doesn't mind. Do you Harry?"
"That's not possible," Draco denied, his eyes wide. Harry and Ron were staring at the healers in confusion.
They ended up waiting for an hour before a healer stepped in a motioned for them to follow. Harry followed the healer into the exam room, relief rushing through him when he saw that Draco was awake and already looking more healthy. He hurried to the bed, eagerly kissing Draco's hands.
"I just had it," Draco protested, blushing. "I can't help it."
Harry allowed his wings to relax and droop, and he chirped happily when he felt Draco's chest press against his back. For a moment they remained still, upright on their knees and panting softly. And then Draco rolled his hips. Harry sighed, dropping his head back onto Draco's shoulder.
Harry agreed, his cheeks growing pink at Ron's suggestion. Draco laughed at him all the way up the stairs.
"Bloody hell," Ron blurted out. "It's not like you're ruddy virgins."
