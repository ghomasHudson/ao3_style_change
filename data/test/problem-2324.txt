He starts on the seedlings, hollowing out a space in the soil with the trowel, then gently settling each little plant in place. They’re only a few inches tall now, but if he remembers anything about vegetables from Hagrid’s garden, it’s that they can grow considerably in a few weeks. Harry wonders if there’ll be pumpkins in this garden and if they’ll be
He said it so fiercely, the way someone would fling something sharp from their hand. Now the words are lodged in Draco’s heart and he’s not sure he’ll be able to recover. They’ll be a shard of coldness that he carries around for the rest of his life.
Greg waves a hand at her in a gruff acknowledgement. Luna convinced him to spend time on his woodworking skills this winter when there isn’t much outdoor work to be done, in the hopes that he can make garden benches and sheds to sell. She knows how much satisfaction he got from building small things for the camp and for his mother.
Draco, Harry notices, flinches at Greg’s words. When the lift doors open, he strides briskly towards the Floo, leaving Harry and Greg to trail after him.
Draco arrives at work breathless and five minutes early. It’s a small miracle, considering the tumult that Knockturn’s in this morning. Everyone in the street seemed torn between gathering for whispered speculation and hurrying off to stay out of sight. Draco definitely fell into the latter category.
Dwelling on those dark years will only pull them away from being happy in the present, Draco’s certain.
“When you go out to the shops, don’t bother buying loo roll,” Harry tells Andromeda casually. “There’s an ample supply in the guest room, it turns out.”
Draco doesn’t want to rain on Harry’s excitement, but he’s not ready to share it just yet. He takes a moment to consider the idea under the pretext of pulling Harry to sit beside him and getting comfortable.
Pansy crosses her arms. “He is very handsome. And rich. And quite taken with me, which shows his exceptional taste. I don’t think I’ve ever had such a promising suitor. I might like to get to know him better.”
I also tried my hand at repairing the broken drystone walls. It was more difficult than it appeared. Potter strolled by one afternoon with Zoë and watched me struggle with finding the proper arrangement of the stones.
—Harry without getting himself in trouble with Andromeda. If it weren’t for Teddy, Harry would be ready to spend the rest of lockdown walking back to London.
“He wouldn’t! He loves Mary’s shortbread. You’re probably right about the nap, though,” Harry concedes.
“Harry, he could barely look at me. Not that I’ve been yearning for Macmillan’s good opinion all these years, of course, but I hoped he might be willing to speak to me, at the very least.”
, just bright enough to see the clock on the table. “It’s only four. We should try to get some more sleep first. Tomorrow’s going to be… eventful.”
“Well she was a famous collector, apparently. Ernie said she inherited a lot of gold from her parents, who made a fortune in designer robes, or something. She spent her life travelling and bringing home things from all over the world and—”
Draco stands and makes the tea, keeping his back turned to give Harry some privacy while he pulls himself together. When it’s ready, he hands Harry a mug and takes a seat on the end of the loveseat closest to him. The tea is just the way Harry likes it—a splash of milk and no sugar.
Before Draco can contradict her, Harry points out Pansy and Greg emerging from the woods, the latter pushing the wheelbarrow piled high with dead branches. As they get closer, their voices drift up the hill. They seem to be having a fabulous row, and Harry’s heart sinks at the prospect of a ruined evening.
Potter levers himself off the floor by gripping Granger’s knee, which makes her squawk and push his hand away. He weaves unsteadily through the armchairs and half-prone bodies toward Draco’s window seat, beer bottle still dangling from his fingertips.
) from Andromeda’s bookcase, a suspenseful romance between a Herbologist and her reluctant guide through the dangerous jungles of Colombia, Harry decides to see if Malfoy’s done studying for the night. He turns out the lamps in the sitting room and creeps upstairs.
“Oh, fine,” Malfoy says, letting Harry cup his chin and cast the charm. He pulls away when Harry tries to lean in to kiss him again. “Oh, no you don’t. You better send a message back to Granger before she really starts panicking.”
Malfoy huffs an incredulous laugh. “The back of my shirt rode up and… my pants are adhered to the chair as well.”
A short time later, when they’re sprawled on the bed and letting the cool air soothe their overheated skin, Harry turns over to face Draco. His fingers brush the damp strands of hair off Draco’s forehead, then lightly trace the curve of his neck, his shoulder, the back of his arm. Draco shivers at the touch.
“Look, I need to ask you not to tell anyone about this. About the Horcruxes. Hermione and Ron and I agreed that we didn’t want it to get out, in case someone decided to try to do the same thing. It’s safest if as few people know as possible.”
Pansy is tucked under a sheet, propped up on pillows with her bandaged hand tangled in Luna’s hair. Luna’s perched on the edge of the bed curled forward to kiss Pansy soundly on the lips. She pulls away when Draco makes a garbled noise.
“I’m sorry we didn’t find the fairy colony,” Luna says sadly. “I don’t think the evening was warm enough for them to gather.”
“It should be,” Malfoy replies, picking up the bottle to look at the label. “It’s older than both of us put together. By the way, this is the moment when you would propose a toast in my honour, if you weren’t an utter cretin.”
“You have no idea what you’re talking about, Malfoy,” he shouted without looking back. “No fucking idea.”
“So, Potter,” Parkinson says once the table is cleared and the dishes are washing themselves in the sink, “how are you at anagrams?”
“Do you think we could go to Portree early this evening, before the shops close? I’d like to find a souvenir for Scorpius, to take home with me on Friday.”
The lane is lined with chest-high hedgerows alive with new, bright leaves and birdsong. It winds between pastures and meadows, descending gently toward a small forest. There’s no sign of the river until Harry turns down a smaller lane that leads into the trees to the water’s edge. From there, it follows the course of the river, sometimes hugging its edge and other times drifting a few dozen yards away.
But it wasn’t. It was electric. It was fucking life-changing. Those few seconds when Potter’s hot fingers were cupping Draco’s chin and their lips fit together
“But it could be longer!” Harry protests. “Hermione said that developing a new magical treatment could take much longer than that, and the Ministry only ordered a two-week lockdown so that people wouldn’t resist the idea. Please, Andromeda? You know I can help keep Teddy occupied for you. A three-year-old cooped up for that long is going to be a handful.”
“I’m not sick, just haven’t been sleeping well. But thank you,” Draco replies, clutching the newspaper against his chest. It’s true that he’s spent the past five nights awake more than asleep, but the yeasty smells around him are also making his stomach lurch unpleasantly. “Can you send Naia up in a few minutes?”
Draco returns the hug but pulls back quickly, glancing around the room. He accepts the flowers with a bemused look. “Thank you, they’re lovely. And here I thought we were going to be discreet.”
“And that came to you, too. You had two of them.” Horror crept over me as I realised where he was going with this story. My palms were slick with sweat, and I wiped them on my trousers before I asked, “And the third? The stone that could summon the souls of the dead?”
“Oh, Luna, I should have come and helped, too,” Harry says. “I mean, it’s really my fault that it was destroyed in the first place.”
“A cloak that would hide the youngest brother from Death,” he said significantly, holding it out to me.
Draco trots down the stairs, wand in hand, then around the corner into the second floor corridor. He finds Mrs Allandale sitting on the floor near her door, the string bag beside her spilling out its contents onto the dusty floorboards.
She manages to stop just before she barrels into Draco’s chest and holds up a large envelope in front of his face. It’s addressed to her, in emerald green ink on heavy parchment, and he recognises it immediately.
He didn’t ask me any questions about myself until my third week as his guest, when I decided to make myself useful around the house. It was the least I could do to repay his hospitality, debt or no debt to my mother. The sight of me doing menial work seemed to rouse his curiosity at last.
I kept my mouth shut and looked around instead. The light was almost gone, but there was an unmistakable sense of emptiness around me. Treeless hills loomed over the house, and the only sounds to be heard were a stream flowing nearby and the last evening calls of some hidden birds. The house itself was not large, just a tall, sturdy rectangle of stone with a small lean-to on one side. There was no sign of habitation on the outside and no lights in the windows.
“Christ, Ginny. I don’t know which is more horrifying: having my ex-girlfriend arrange a one-off for me, or sex with a complete stranger. Thanks, but no thanks.”
Malfoy probably doesn’t have that comfort anymore. Harry’s curious to know if he’s feeling adrift, too, or if he’s relieved to get away from his past.
The tent is stuffy from Luna’s Warming Charms and Harry’s legs are getting cramped from sitting criss-cross on his cushion. He looks longingly through the gap in the front panels of the tent. The story that Pansy’s reading is interesting, but it’s getting difficult to focus on wizard-bandits with hearts of gold and their goblin nemeses when all Harry wants to do is get a breath of fresh air in his lungs.
A flash of colour catches Draco’s eyes, as bright as fireworks in the night sky to someone accustomed to seeing only shades of grey. It takes a few moments for his sluggish memory to find its way to the word
Harry lets Teddy chase him around the room and try to pinch his legs for the next half hour, just to show Malfoy that Teddy is made of sterner stuff than he is.
attic. At least he thought of it that way. Ginny never loved any part of the house, and she didn’t live here long enough even to grow fond of it.
“So you decided to lend your many talents to Magical Games and Sports? Is that really the best the Ministry could offer you, our
I dozed off and awakened several times after that. Potter was always there, silent even when I stirred. I managed to get my eyes to open enough to see him briefly, a silhouette in the dim room, so close that I could catch the familiar smell of him and hear him sigh.
in the past couple of years. That he’s become as uninteresting as the dusty, drooping houseplant that’s languishing in his flat. Goyle interrupts Harry’s thoughts by rising from the blanket with surprising nimbleness.
. He craves nothing in the world more than the relief he’d feel from having Potter’s arms around him again.
He looks towards the door that leads to Diagon with a slight frown, as if he thinks there might be an angry mob outside waiting for him to show his face. Waiting to judge him again for the things he did.
“So, what needs to be done?” Harry asks. “Do you want me to start turning another bed or spread the manure on that one?”
Draco slips out the door, through the ward, and down the lift to the Floo in the reception area. He hopes that someone will unward the fireplace at the bakery and let him through; he’s about to fall asleep on his feet and it’s a long walk back to Knockturn. He silently curses the Ministry for the exorbitant fees that have prevented him from getting another Apparition licence.
“It’s not a matter of getting in my way, Draco. It’s a matter of keeping you safe in a house full of cursed objects,” Harry says urgently. “I’d never forgive myself if you got hurt, even in a way that’s easily healed.”
Andromeda’s voice calls through the open kitchen window while they’re still staring at each other, wide-eyed and frozen.
“No, I didn’t,” Draco says defensively, pointing toward the corner, where a pair of ceramic bowls sit on the floor.
Draco smirks at him and makes a show of looking around the room, from the grimy ceiling beams to the chipped flagstone floor. “Thank you. I assume there isn’t time for a tour before the Portkey activates. I’d love to see what you’ve done with the rest of the place.”
After drifting aimlessly around his flat until a couple of minutes before six, Harry slips on his trainers, locks his door behind him with his wand, and descends two flights of stairs with a cold lump of apprehension in his gut. The aroma of roast beef gets stronger the closer he gets to apartment 2C. Harry’s stomach growls loudly.
Harry pulls Draco tighter against his side and smiles at the memory of that night. He hasn’t told Draco yet about the epiphany he had on the summer solstice.
The wildflowers in the chapter titles are all native to Devon. Their meanings were culled from various websites, and I attempted to use the most common meaning, when possible.
to be happy, too, Draco. I don’t expect you to stay shut away here, like I am.” He took a deep breath and moved in front of me so he could clasp my other hand. “The offer to help you start over somewhere still stands, if you ever change your mind. Just say the word, and I’ll do it.”
“No, I ducked into a little alley before they got close to me. I didn’t know what was going on. I was afraid they’d—”
There are footsteps, and then Draco’s biceps are gripped by two strong hands. He opens his eyes to see Harry looking at him with concern.
After the (rather meagre) leftovers are packed back into the hamper, they brush the crumbs off the table, push back their chairs to stretch their legs out, and get to work on making plans for the summer. Parkinson puts herself in charge of writing the list, which she declares is only fair since she had the foresight to bring parchment and a self-inking quill. When she’s ready to begin, she raps on the table to get everyone’s attention.
“Ooh,” Draco says. “Gringotts? Oh, bloody hell, that thing you were looking for in the Room of Hidden Things.
“Ready?” Draco asks, his arm extended above his head with the Snitch held tightly in his fist. He opens his hand, then counts down the seconds until the chase can begin, all the while holding Harry’s gaze.
“Four, all little boys,” Draco answers. “And the oldest won’t go off to Beauxbatons for another two years. They’re quite a handful, judging by Mother’s letters.”
Harry stewed in his misery until the woolen rug started to make his bare forearms itch and his back began to complain. There had to be a way to fix this. He went to the kitchen to make a mug of tea and a plan.
His plan, apparently, is to spend the rest of 1998 brooding on this frigid window seat where the dimmed lights of the Eighth-Year common room barely reach him. And being the miserable bugger he knows he is, he’s not going to do anything to make himself warmer, drunker, or… more noticed. Instead, he’s going to think of all the places he could be if the terms of his probation didn’t confine him to Hogwarts until he takes his NEWTs. He could be properly drunk on decent alcohol—not the swill that Finnigan smuggled into the castle—with Pansy in Paris. He could be with his mother, listening to the waves crash through the open windows of a Greek villa.
“Well it took a while to figure out what she was talking about,” Harry explained, shifting the snake in his arms again. “That’s why we were talking for so long.”
Harry opens the box carefully, pulling the ends of the ribbons with obvious anticipation. With a flutter in his stomach, Draco watches him lift the lid and pull out the shell and the letter tied to it with more of the same ribbon.
“Definitely not. But I do like her. I’m sorry I didn’t think of sending you to Luna to figure out the problem. You aren’t going to give her back, are you?”
Draco doesn’t know how to answer. How does he put into words how much he’s wanted Harry, but felt safer keeping his distance? That he’s resented their connection at times as much as he grieved its impossibility?
“It’s fine. You had some fair points. I’m certainly interested in hearing your thoughts sometime, when cooler heads can prevail,” she says, rolling her eyes at her husband.
“Keep going,” Malfoy repeats. He shifts in Harry’s arms, but doesn’t pull away. “I haven’t thanked you… for how kind you’ve been since we’ve come back here. You have every reason to shun me, like everyone else, but you haven’t. It’s one of the few things that has helped me
It was wrapped in a moth-eaten woollen blanket and hidden away in a locked wardrobe, which, at first glance, held nothing more interesting than a few sets of formal robes. After using his wand to move the bundle onto the floor and unwrap it, Harry was stunned to find an exquisite wooden box with a Chinese dragon carved into its lid. He wondered why such a piece would be hidden away.
Of course Draco couldn’t resist a challenge like that. A challenge from Potter, no less, his erstwhile rival and perpetual thorn lodged under Draco’s skin. Insults were exchanged, handfuls of jumper were pulled and arms shoved away until—finally—their mouths collided again.
“I just don’t want to be behind everyone else.” Naia looks up at him, her forehead creased with worry. “Are you sure I’m going to be ready? I’ve barely started on writing essays and it’s halfway through June already! And I need to keep up with maths if I want to take Arithmancy, don’t I?”
The seventh time that Draco sees Harry Potter, he’s sitting in a Muggle coffee shop at half-past five in the evening with a paper cup of weak tea, enduring Hermione Granger-Weasley’s skeptical gaze. Potter seems to be here merely as a chaperone, since he’s leaving the talking to Granger.
did it,” Draco corrects her, then his throat closes up and he can’t speak anymore through his tears. He wants to tell her how proud he is, how brilliant she is, but he settles for wrapping his arms around her tightly and giving her a single spin before setting her down.
“I suppose we should keep trying for a little while longer, since Luna went to the trouble of making the lists for us. It’s only been—” Draco casts a
“I’ve been trying for months, you know, but you kept giving me the cold shoulder. And then you owled me and I thought that my chance had finally come. I wanted to help your snake, too, I swear. Anyways, I apologize again for deceiving you. I truly didn’t mean to embarrass you in any way.”
I didn’t return to the house until the middle of the afternoon, cold and exhausted from tramping around. Potter seemed to have gone back to bed, so I took the opportunity to do the same on the top of his armchair, as a crow again.
All he remembers is the irritation he felt at seeing Malfoy working so slowly, followed by frustration that the stubborn git wouldn’t let Harry help him. Then the startled expression on his pale face when Harry trapped him against the wall, quickly replaced by the vivid—much
Pansy looks ready to shoot down the idea, but changes her mind when Luna claps her hands and Greg looks more enthusiastic than he has all day. Draco merely shrugs and admits it
“Okay,” Harry says and retreats not only from the bedroom, but from the house as well. Standing in the cold mist on the doorstep, he takes off his glasses and runs his hand over his face.
“When are you going back to your house?” Teddy asks Harry as they’re resting on the grass after a few spirited rounds of the game they call “Wolf Pack.” There’s a lot of running and howling and chasing of imaginary rabbits.
Suddenly worried that he was taking too long and Draco would think that he was snooping, Harry flushed the toilet and returned to the reptile room.
Harry’s left speechless for a moment, but manages to find his voice again when Malfoy begins walking towards the door to the dormitories.
Halfway up the slope, Harry realises where he is. The meadow is unfamiliar, but the low, stone house at the top of the hill isn’t. He laughs at himself for imagining he’d found his way to Middle Earth when, in fact, he’d just found Luna.
“I do. I’m trying to understand how you can show up here and just decide to forget the past—” Draco snaps his fingers. “—like it never happened.”
could commit murder without a second thought. Just a wave of his wand, really, and another life snuffed out like it meant nothing.”
“Draco, I know very well how to unward something without setting off a curse. None of the spells protecting the box are linked to the object inside. I already made sure of that. And if I get it open and find something unstable inside, I’ll get us both out of the house right away. I promise.”
“Okay,” Harry says, and steps into the bathroom before he has to endure seeing Draco getting into bed. He’s afraid he might lose his nerve and end up sleeping on the sitting room floor after all, if he does.
“I am not touching that thing,” Pansy says vehemently. “You know I adore you, Luna, but do not ask me to come any closer to a snake.”
Harry grabs his bags and his jacket and wraps his fingers around the smooth corner of the ashtray. It’s already starting to hum with magic.
With Malfoy’s encouragement, Harry follows him back to the kitchen for second helpings (but smaller ones this time). When they sit down again, Malfoy hesitates before he picks up his fork and knife.
“I forgot to take the other one inside, so your dad said to use this one,” Harry explains, stepping inside. “It’s very charming.”
“I was tempted to go to the shop, but I thought that might be overreacting. And it would be hard to explain to your boss why I was whisking you away.”
“I’m glad you have an open mind on the subject,” Andromeda says with a bemused expression. She shoos Teddy towards the sitting room. “Let’s go tidy up a bit, then you can pick out some books for Draco to read to you.”
“I thought you’d be interested, or at least curious to hear about the curriculum,” Granger says, frowning in disapproval.
Around Draco, conversations hum as people chat and laugh, balancing plates of food and half-empty glasses in their hands. No one is staring at him and Harry. The shouted greetings when they arrived were friendly, and a surprising number of people besides their hosts have been wandering over to talk. It’s both strangely normal and nerve-wrackingly new. Draco smiles when each new group approaches them—and then furtively finds Harry’s hand for a reassuring squeeze once they’re alone again.
I heard him follow me inside and close the door. With a pointed look, I took the receipt and the money left from what he’d given me and slammed them down on the table.
After extinguishing his light, Draco eases across the mattress towards Harry. He gratefully rolls onto his side and lets Draco spoon up behind him again. His heart stutters, just a little, when Draco wraps an arm around his chest and plants a kiss on Harry’s shoulder.
Harry doesn’t reply right away. How does he explain to Draco that only something desperately important could make him leave New York now? That he’d give anything to be two places at once, so that his heart wouldn’t be torn like this. He struggles to breath through the sob that’s rising from his chest.
kinds of feelings are so far in Harry’s past that it’s startling to have them again. Not since Ginny has his body reacted to someone with an unmistakable surge of…
. Apparently Harry’s doing the same, judging by the soft giggle he’s breathing into Draco’s shoulder.
“It’s tricky, you know, me working in the department,” Potter grimaces. “There was a fair amount of resentment when I was allowed to start the training without my NEWTs. I had to promise Robards—the Head Auror—that I wanted to be treated like everyone else. And I’ve never asked for any special privileges or favours. But it would make me very unpopular in the department if I voiced my suspicions about some of my fellow Aurors without evidence to back it up.”
at it, resisting the contrary impulse to march over to the window and push his fist through one of the panes. Draco takes a deep breath to steady himself, but the indignities of the past few days are rising to the surface of his mind like Inferi through icy waters.
“What do you think you’d be? A stag, like your Patronus? You could graze in the meadow for your lunches.”
“Ah, how could I forget!” Mary turns and pats a ladder behind her. “Two more beds up in the sleeping loft. Plenty of room up there.”
“Good thing I didn’t buy lots of souvenirs while I was here,” Harry says, just to break the silence. “I would have needed another suitcase. It was a tight squeeze with my new jumpers and the presents for Teddy.”
Harry looked in the mirror the day he found out he’d missed Lavender’s engagement party, studying his unremarkable features and the unremarkable haircut he’d had since he was eighteen. Was he really so boring and unimportant that nobody thought about him much anymore? He didn’t mind in the least that the wizarding world wasn’t fawning over him, but it cut deeply that the people dearest to him no longer seemed to want or need his company.
, Potter. She’d rather—” I had to wait for the choking horror of it to release its grip on my throat. “She’d have rather died. And she did.”
Jesus, what had he done? Hermione was still staring him down as if she had been taking lessons from a Basilisk. Harry shuffled sideways and eased himself into the battered armchair whose sickly green colour Ron had dubbed “Potions cock-up.”
“What do you mean? I thought you… I thought we both liked living here together,” he said. His voice shook slightly, like an autumn leaf clinging to a tree. I’d heard the same uncertainty lurking in it when he had offered me his gold to leave England.
After turning Harry’s chin a little to give him a quick kiss, Draco settles back down on his pillow, facing Harry.
Before he’s fully conscious the next morning, Draco decides that the most wonderful way to wake up is with Harry curled against his back, breathing softly against his shoulder. Unfortunately, his wand is buzzing beneath his pillow as he has this revelation, reminding him that his job—and possibly the wrath of all magical Great Britain—awaits him.
“Oh, don’t thank me. If circumstances were less dire, I’d just as soon share a room with a Blast-ended Skrewt as
He hasn’t told her about Potter. He never will, even if he’s tempted to throw her words back at her on days like today, when he can almost feel the bitterness burning in his throat like wormwood. Draco rises from his chair to get his tea and thinks about that conversation, now ten years in the past, when he was old enough to feel the pangs of adolescent yearning, but still too young to sense the storm gathering around them.
Draco laughs. “I mean figuratively, you numpty. Every time I thought I was going to come out on top, every time I thought I was about to take my rightful place in the order of things, you came along and hit me,
The path ends where the meadow begins and the sound of the trickling stream is replaced by the hum of insects. Harry and Parkinson climb to the highest spot, where they can survey the entire expanse of the meadow. Luna was right that this would be a perfect spot to fly kites.
“Maybe that’s not for you to decide,” Harry says quietly. His gaze is so intense that it’s a bit unnerving.
Pansy takes out her wand and points it at her mug with a pout of concentration. With a murmured incantation, the mug becomes fuchsia with large, yellow polka dots. Pansy pours her tea with a flourish that earns her a giggle from Luna.
It’s hard for Harry to see that. He impulsively decides to tell Draco what he swore to himself he wouldn’t reveal.
“I see that now. In my defence, you did try to make me think that after it happened. You said you wanted to forget it.”
Harry made me wait two days before he explained what had happened when I’d been attacked by the peregrine falcon. First, he cast Glamours on both of us and Apparated us right in front of the Reception Desk at St Mungo’s—which shouldn’t have been possible, but spared us from having to walk there from an Apparition Point in Muggle London. The Healer gave me a clean bill of health, though he did look suspicious of Harry’s vague story of an animal attack and his decision to try to heal me himself.
“Because you want to help them,” Draco says, not bothering to phrase it as a question. He knows Harry well enough to understand where he’s going with this.
Two days later, Draco’s eagle owl landed on the kitchen windowsill at Grimmauld Place. Its appearance made Harry’s heart leap, but the letter itself carried grim news.
, as she does every visit. Harry follows her into the foyer, but instead of going down the hall to Draco’s study, the house-elf leads him upstairs. He’s never been upstairs before.
“Harry,” Draco begins. He lets his gaze fall while he searches for the right words. “You know I can’t reciprocate.”
“Sure, of course,” Harry replies. “I wouldn’t mind looking around a bit, before it gets dark. Maybe find something besides a posh seafood restaurant this time.”
“An unlikely pairing?” Draco finishes grimly. “Believe me, I know. It’s bound to cause an uproar when it gets out, so I’d appreciate your discretion until then.”
Harry laughs, thinking of the times when Ron has done that exact thing with Hermione. He glances at Draco as they approach the stream that flows down from the meadow. Has Draco dated anyone since the war? Is he dating anyone now? Harry doesn’t think so. From the way Draco teases Pansy about her parties and social obligations, he gets the impression that Draco doesn’t spend his free time with anyone but them.
“I’m not insinuating anything,” Draco says quickly, holding up his hands. “I was thinking about some of the other shops. It’s hard enough for them to make ends meet without having to line the pockets of some crooked Aurors.”
“Yeah, I think I would.” Harry nods, then turns to McGonagall. “I’m sorry to rush off. You know I’d stay, normally…”
to hear that or even think about her or my uncle ever again, so I just find other ways to eat. Okay, I think that’s all I want to say about it.”
“Comfortable,” I murmured, sprawling on the soft sheets and pushing my face into the pillow. “Almost forgot how nice they are, beds.”
“Not many people out in the Alley today?” Draco asks. “Usually people are happy to stop and talk when they’re out at the shops.”
so much as let you in when you show up on a whim,” Draco says with a laugh. “Or return to find you making yourself at home on my bed, it seems.”
Harry eats his lunch with a contentment that goes beyond the food and the others’ enjoyment of it. He’ll have another birthday celebration tomorrow at the Burrow and drinks with all his Hogwarts friends on Tuesday, his actual birthday. And although he looks forward to those gatherings, he can’t imagine enjoying them more than he does this one, surrounded by new friends and the heady scents of honeysuckle and freshly-mown grass.
As soon as I came through the door, he scrambled up from the floor, where he’d been stroking Zoë’s silky ears.
He’s beginning to wonder what he ever did to deserve such people. They surely deserved better than him, better than the sharp words and sullen silences that he resorted to whenever they tried to help him make plans for his future.
Draco goes to look, picking up the frame with reverent hands. The witch in the picture is laughing, making her curls shake and cheeks dimple. It was taken of her in middle age, but Draco gets a sense of youthfulness and humour. He sets it down carefully, heart aching.
Even so, Draco doesn’t expect more than a secondhand acquaintance with Teddy, and Andromeda’s next words surprise him.
“Heartless,” he declared, but I heard the creak of the floorboards as he slid out of bed onto the floor.
“We don’t have much demand for it. There aren’t many Elephantine Aphid infestations at this time of year, are there?”
“I don’t know. Maybe take a nap. Or walk over to the village if it’s not raining too hard,” Harry replies, even though he’s thinking,
“The long and the short of it was that I was told that it wasn’t the proper time or place to air my concerns, not to mention that I was flirting with insubordination. So I said I couldn’t obey the orders they were planning to give in good conscience, and I handed the Head Auror my badge and quit.”
Malfoy’s arms wrap around him and his warm, tea-sweet mouth opens to Harry’s. They pull each other close, chest-to-chest, feet dovetailing together. Any doubts about whether he wants this are scattered by the rush of desire Harry feels burning through him. Any sense of foreignness is lost in the electric way their lips and tongues move together.
Harry stood in front of the door of Draco’s flat taking deep breaths and watching the numbers of his
“I wouldn’t snoop!” Harry cries. “And I promised not to do that again, if it startles you. Though if you have any more of those chocolate fairy cakes in your cupboard, I might be tempted.”
“There are otter dens in some of these banks,” Luna calls over her shoulder. “But they usually don’t come out during the day.”
“I wasn’t playing a joke on you, I swear. I just kind of panicked when you asked me to speak Parseltongue because I really did want to help,” Harry explained. “I didn’t think it would do any harm to try, and when you asked me what she said, I blurted out the stuff about the turtles and her wanting a telly. I would never have done it if I’d known she was hurt.”
“I know. I feel that way when I dream of Mother. But I’d never want to forget her. My memories are all I have left of her. Everything else is gone. But your friends are still out there, you know. You may hardly see them, but they must still care about you.”
Draco shivers, despite feeling hot beneath his wool coat. He feels out of control, and it’s not dissimilar to the way he felt after his father’s first arrest and Voldemort’s occupation of the Manor. He feels the same urge to hide, the same sense of imminent catastrophe. Draco stands and begins to walk, more slowly now, toward Knockturn Alley.
“Yeah, I don’t have any plans.” Harry relaxes even further. Thank goodness their intense—and revealing—conversation this evening hasn’t changed Malfoy’s mind about spending time with him. Harry’s not sure how he was able to bear those desolate weeks before Malfoy found him sitting on the floor of the corridor.
“I should have guessed you’d be a Gryffindor about this,” Draco murmurs. “I wish I could say I’m as ready to face it as you are. You know they’re not going to be any easier on me now than they were last summer, don’t you?”
Taking hold of Harry’s chin to tilt his head back, Draco pushes him into the cushions with a fierce kiss. If Harry had asked him to stay for six more months right now, he probably would have agreed to it. It’s hard to think clearly about anything at the moment, when all he wants to do is get them both out of their clothes.
, and Draco begins to lose his sense of imminent catastrophe. However, when he returns from work on Friday evening, Harry’s nowhere to be seen. His second meeting with the Minister was scheduled for today, Draco knows, but that was hours ago.
He thinks Draco’s already falling back asleep, but then he opens his hand and presses it against Harry’s chest. He slides it, so slowly, down to Harry’s stomach, just below the bottom of his ribcage.
He’ll be able to send Mother a little more money and start saving up again for a Portkey to visit her. He doesn’t think it will be enough to pay half of Harry’s rent, but it might allow Draco to get a better place in Knockturn Alley—maybe a room where he doesn’t have to share a bathroom. And then there’s the matter of Christmas gifts…
As it turned out, people in the restaurant did look at Draco, but thankfully he didn’t notice and Harry was spared having to explain that it was because he’s so damn
Harry bends down to zip his rucksack closed so that Draco can’t see his cheeks colouring. “No, I think it will be fine as it is.”
Draco shudders. It’s been so long since he had a dream like that, one that made him relive those awful weeks when he was awaiting his trial. No one bearing the Dark Lord’s Mark was allowed to post bail. His mother wasn’t permitted to visit him, and without any means of supporting herself, she was forced to seek refuge with family in France. She had once believed it was a sign of love and trust to move her Black inheritance into her husband’s vaults. Little did she know that it would leave her without a Sickle to her name one day.
“I suppose I do.” He pulls Harry closer by the hips and leans in to let his lips brush Harry’s. “When you’re not scowling at me.”
. It roars like a wildfire through him, starting where warm fingers slide against Harry’s scalp, then burning across lips and tongue, and down through his belly to his groin.
When Parkinson goes inside to make a pot of tea, Harry sits beside Luna and musters the courage to make the offer he’s been contemplating since lunch. She notices his hesitation and pats him on the knee.
Draco snorts. “Harry, you are the very definition of a do-gooder. But I understand what you mean. I think if you take some time to understand what’s needed, you could do a lot of good. Just living there would be an important statement. Well, as long as people don’t think you’ve gone rogue and taken up Dark Magic, I suppose.”
“You seem all right to me now. Aside from your insistence on eating those horrid noodles from paper cups and your strange taste in companions.” I leant forwards in my chair to frown at him with mock seriousness. “Is it the colour black? The Thestrals? The ravens? Even your goddamn dog is black, Potter.”
He ducked his face into the crook of my neck, smiling, when we stopped. With a gentle hand in his curls, I held him there, looking up at the sky. Zoë found her way back from her explorations and lay down, panting, beside us.
“Reporting for carpentry duty,” Harry says cheerfully when he reaches the half-built platform. Goyle nods silently, but Malfoy scowls. Harry ignores him; he’s not going to let Malfoy be the fly in the ointment of what promises to be an enjoyable afternoon. He accepts the hammer from Malfoy with a cheeky grin, then turns to Goyle for instructions.
“Yes! But I didn’t find that,”  Potter says defensively. “I was looking for uses in medical potions. I didn’t consider… household ones.”
“I’m not,” Harry assures him. He gestures towards the stairs. “I’m just going to go back to my, um, apartment now.”
Potter stared at me and didn’t answer, so I went upstairs and got ready for bed. I put on a clean pair of pyjamas (the line between Potter’s clothing and my own was rather blurred at this point, he’d shared so much of it) and slipped into the fresh sheets that he’d put on the bed that morning.
“No, we didn’t. We should have. It wasn’t a cheap thrill to me, Draco. I want you to know that. Not that it wasn’t thrilling,” Potter adds, smirking at his feet. “I never thought of it as dangerous or wrong, not once. If you really want to stop, I won’t push you to change your mind. I know the stakes are higher for you in some ways—”
“The morning after the Battle of Hogwarts,” Draco says, forcing himself to look at Harry. “You took off your shirt so Madam Pomfrey could tend to you and I saw the mark on your shoulder.”
Harry was trying not to laugh again. Between the ridiculous pun and the stress of the situation, he was afraid that he would descend into hysterical giggling.
“Er, no. I haven’t read either. Do you come into… this part of the city often? I just didn’t know that you do that. Not that I think you shouldn’t,” Potter hastens to add when Draco narrows his eyes at him.
George glances through a doorway at his brother, who’s been droning on about some Ministry regulation for at least twenty minutes. Draco doesn’t recognise the witch he’s speaking to, but she looks like she’d happily take one of those sweets that causes vomiting in order to get away.
“Okay. I’ll send an owl, I guess?” Harry says, stepping backwards toward the door. Draco can tell that he, too, feels the pull of their bond by the twist of his mouth as he moves away and the way his eyes stay locked on Draco.
While we were staring at each other, at a momentary impasse, I looked him over. He certainly dressed the part, with sturdy boots and a thick coat. He didn’t seem to be too fussed about his grooming, either—hair shaggy around his face and jaw darkened by several days without a shaving charm.
Draco waits for him to say more, but after a full minute he breaks the silence to ask, “What was done to it? What was it cursed to do?”
“As soon as you’re done with your calls,” Draco whispers, not very quietly, “we’re locking that damned Floo.”
“I haven’t had a spare afternoon all spring to get the garden tidied up, and I’m afraid the weeds will take over soon. Would you boys mind helping out with it today, since the weather’s fine?”
Greg shakes his head. “Neither. I don’t think I’m a romance kind of bloke. I just like having friends, you know?”
Seeing smoke rising from the chimney, Harry decides that dropping by to say hello is the only polite thing to do. And he certainly wouldn’t say no to a glass of water, if he’s offered one.
“No, I’ve always known. That is, I knew as soon as I was old enough to understand that other preferences besides heterosexual ones were possible. But I had already accepted my obligation to marry and have an heir to carry on our name by then. That didn’t change, and I can’t say I regret fulfilling those obligations.”
“No, of course not,” Draco replies tersely. He glances around to see if they’ve drawn the attention of anyone nearby. The middle of Knockturn is not the place to have a conversation with Harry.
I didn’t know what to do with myself while he made his dinner, so I edged over to the armchair to be out of his way. He glanced at me now and then while he cooked, but ignored me completely once he sat down to eat his tin of Muggle soup right out of the saucepan. It was obvious, however, that he was agitated by my presence.
It feels to Draco like he’s being rebuked for allowing himself to dream of… well, things that he knows are in the distant future, but are nonetheless real possibilities now, like silhouettes on the horizon. These past few days, he’s imagined what it would be like to touch Harry, to press their bodies together and inhale the scent of him. He’s permitted himself to feel a longing that would have been unbearable before, when he had no hope that Harry would accept him as his soulmate.
“If we put it here,” Parkinson says, “it will be more sheltered from the wind and we won’t need as many protective charms. Not that I doubt your charmwork, dear.” She loops her arm through Luna’s with a fond smile.
Harry nods over his shoulder. Both Draco and McGonagall have their wands in hand, wearing resolute expressions.
Harry’s right. They’re at an impasse. Draco won’t turn his back on Knockturn and Harry’s just going to have to accept that. Harry can’t do more for the Alley than he’s already doing, and Draco’s going to have to live with it and not be disappointed.
One of the Aurors gestures for Draco to sit. He lowers himself slowly onto the chair and tries to slow his breathing. Appearing upset won’t help him here if Aurors are anything like the guards at Azkaban. Somehow, knowing that Potter is nearby steadies Draco, a ballast to counteract the waves of fear.
“Exactly. If it’s not the right time, it could go very badly. They might be complete strangers or their lives may be incompatible at that point. It’s better to be patient and wait until they’re drawn together naturally.”
Harry squeezes his fingers in reply. There’s something wrong with his throat that’s making it impossible to speak.
“Almost there. Just the trousers now,” Malfoy says in an unsteady voice, reaching down to open his flies.
“It’s not doing any harm, Hermione. The snake isn’t sick, honestly, and she’s bound to get hungry enough to eat eventually.”
“If you’re so cold, go back over by the fireplace,” Draco says. “I’m really not in the mood for company right now.”
“I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have just left,” Harry says, meeting Draco’s eyes. He pushes down his disappointment about the stag. “Let’s go find Luna and Pansy.”
As if Luna conjured it with her words, Harry can feel a glow in his chest as they clink their glasses together. He wishes he could express as elegantly as Luna how grateful he is to be admitted into their circle and be a part of this little wonderland they’ve created.
Harry smiles. He did secretly hope for an invitation earlier today, when he remembered it was Saturday. He knows Malfoy well enough to feel confident that he wouldn’t ask Harry grudgingly. There aren’t any social obligations either of them need to observe. No compelling reason for Malfoy to be neighbourly or for Harry to reciprocate in any way. They have almost half a lifetime of history behind them, and yet there’s nothing to push them together anymore.
“Ever, I guess,” he said, his green eyes both questioning and fixated as a cat’s on a bird. He set first one hand, then the other on my waist.
Until he started coming to Luna’s, adulthood seemed to be a straight, monotonous road stretching before him. It made Harry feel a bit restless and dissatisfied, made him think of doing something reckless—what, exactly, he didn’t know. But then he would tell himself not to be ungrateful for the blessings in his life. For friends and family and peace.
,” Draco whispers. He pivots towards Harry and grips his shoulders. “I’m not letting you go back to the house alone. I’ll do exactly what you tell me to do, but I want to be there in case something happens.”
Harry lies very still in his sleeping bag while he tries to interpret those last words. Does Draco mean he doesn’t
Back in their little sitting room, Draco lights the fire again and puts a few reference materials into his own satchel. Harry finds a few books about the Western Isles tucked inside the sideboard. He flips through them, looking at the photographs, while they wait for Ernie. There are hills and glassy lochs and sand dunes covered with wildflowers to be seen here, apparently. It looks much more appealing in the photos than the tiny part that Harry’s seen so far.
Potter brought meat to the Thestrals now that their usual prey was holed up in burrows and tree hollows. He didn’t tell me where he got the meat, but I suspected it was from a magical establishment because I caught him removing a Glamour on his way back to the house once. I didn’t ask what kind of animal the meat came from, either. One look at it told me that it wasn’t fit for human consumption.
Every bite of the meal was more and more tasteless in Harry’s mouth, and he’d slipped out to the garden before pudding was served, feeling sick. And unworthy.
“Excellent. And perfect timing, too. Let’s go eat before that cat gets any ideas about my roast," Ron said, scowling at Crookshanks, who was draped across the back of the sofa with his tail twitching. "I can tell you’re thinking about it, aren’t you?”
“I hope she finds them soon, so she…” He trails off, leaning away from Draco slightly to give him a keen look. “You know who it is, don’t you?”
Harry’s skin is so warm beneath his hand, and his breath rushes soft and ragged against Draco’s mouth. He feels his own pulse rapidly quicken.
Like the main room, it was quite spartan: a tiny space tucked under the sloping roof of the lean-to with a stone floor, but it was clean. I splashed some water on my face and found a towel to dry it off. There was no mirror above the sink.
is not a good thing to be when you’re sharing a room—and a tiny one, at that—with a prat like Malfoy. Even with Silencing Charms, Harry doesn’t dare get himself off in bed at night, and he’s rarely in the room alone since Malfoy uses it to study. And a leisurely wank in the shower is impossible with four people (including a toddler) sharing one bathroom.
“I’m not certain,” Malfoy replies. “I’m here to finish my schooling, which will be completed this summer, then I’ll decide what to do next.”
He released a gust of breath and propped himself up on his elbow. “Only if you want to. Wait, don’t answer yet. You need to hear my story first, when you’re stronger.”
He’s looking out the window, adrift among the memories of the walk home with Harry last night. Their hands brushing as they squeezed through the clusters of people waiting outside restaurants. The shy smiles exchanged in lieu of conversation. The long embrace that ended their evening together and the promises breathed into each others’ ears to see each other again soon. Very soon.
Draco understands the urgency of the case now—and why Potter would agree to speak with him rather than waiting for Wharton to return. Dappled Apricot stones, like many other fruit seeds both magical and non-magical, are a natural source of cyanide. A potions ring, Draco speculates, or maybe a serial murderer… whose
“No! That I kissed someone who’s married. And who I thought was straight,” Harry says, his voice rising a bit.
He shyly reaches out and squeezes Harry’s leg just above the knee. The small gesture makes Harry desperately want to drag him behind one of the old doors and snog the hell out of him.
“Well, you two are a package deal now, right? And Harry’s been walking on bloody air for the past few months, so I reckon you must be making him happy. Oh, Merlin, please don’t look at each other like that in front of me. You’ll put me off my dinner.”
“Don’t you think it’s odd that so many of the pieces with curses on them were Muggle?” Harry asks. “From what you’ve told me, it’s almost three-to-one, Muggle to magical.”
“I know you’re stronger than that.” Harry pulls one hand out of Draco’s to cover a yawn. “Merlin, it’s not ten o’clock yet. Should I make some tea?”
was gone. But it still feels like a bad dream I wish I could wake from,” Malfoy says. “I can’t bear it sometimes.”
Harry watches Luna, Parkinson, and Malfoy as they head towards the house, their voices carrying back to him on the wind. Malfoy’s sounds sharp and bitter, but he falls silent when Luna pats him on the shoulder and replies in her soothing tone.
Draco closes his eyes, giving Harry the opportunity to take in, at a startlingly close range, the smooth planes of Draco’s cheeks, the way his eyebrows arch slightly, the tension in his mouth that’s pushing his lips together.
The MACUSA worker examines Harry’s wand and passport to confirm his Portkey reservation. After he records the information, he directs Harry to the platform where the other passengers are waiting. Thankfully, there are only two of them, a middle-aged American couple. Harry takes his place beside the pedestal where the Portkey will be set to activate. He tries not to think of Draco walking back to his flat, alone in the rain.
“Marry a gay man with a chequered past?” Draco asks with a bitter twist to his lips. “Not for money, don’t worry. She has enough of her own, between what her parents give her and her photography business. She simply wanted a family—a child of her own, to be specific—without the complications of a traditional marriage.”
She takes his arm and leads him to the blanket, and Harry’s heart swells like a sail billowing in the wind, full of gladness and gratitude.
Was that only two weeks ago? Harry grossly underestimated the depth of his feelings. He would never have invited Draco to come along if he’d realised… if he knew he’d be stretched out on a bed, tormenting himself with images of bare shoulders and warm smiles and those pale, piercing eyes. Harry rests his hand on his stomach, just above the waistband of his pants.
“I… My family was on the wrong side of the war,” Draco says. He hates himself a little for glossing over the story, for not stating his own role explicitly, but he
Draco tenses. “Now I’d like to see you and spend time together beyond our Friday meetings. Discreetly, of course, just until things are settled with Astoria. If you’re amenable, that is.”
If Draco could go back in time to when he was seventeen and convinced that his life was worthless, he would tell his younger self this:
Potter slept downstairs that night. In the morning, he helped me use the bathroom and insisted that I stay in bed for the day. I didn’t argue. Even though my fever and other symptoms were gone, I felt as weak and wobbly as a newborn Mooncalf. And besides, getting to stretch out in a proper bed felt like a luxury.
Despite walking quickly and breaking into a trot when the cottage is in sight, Harry’s soaked through by the time he gets inside. Sitting by the fireplace is tempting, but the bed and its heavy duvet sound even better. He hangs his wet clothes over the curtain rod around the bathtub, then returns to the bedroom to pull on a fresh pair of pants.
. Trainee Aurors, standing in a tight cluster near the door. The other inmates are now as still and silent as Draco and the sounds of their murmured conversations and scuffling footsteps have been replaced by the Warden’s booming voice.
Greg pulls a face at her and grumbles something under his breath about looking like a tit. Apparently, there’s a limit to the things he’s willing to do for Luna. Harry, buoyed by the joyful mood of the evening and a couple of drinks, feels open to almost anything. He reaches up and holds his crown while he drinks the last bit from his glass and wonders if the girls have used Sticking Charms on theirs.
Harry follows him, silent and mortified and cursing himself with every step. What the hell was he thinking? He knows the answer to that. All the times he allowed himself to indulge in those inappropriate thoughts about Draco in the past few days undoubtedly brought Harry to this point. He should have quashed them as soon as they arose, even if it never occurred to him that he might do something as rash as kiss Draco.
He’s grateful that the darkened room will keep Draco from noticing that Harry can’t look him in the eye.
I watched him shuffle the cards nimbly, then deal them out again. “Wouldn’t you rather live close to a village? You could walk to the shops instead of Apparating all the way across Yorkshire, and there’d be people to—”
Malfoy and Goyle are working on the wooden platform for the tent, while Luna and Parkinson are sitting on a blanket with piles of folded fabric and coiled rope around them. They greet Harry with smiles and Luna graciously accepts the tin of biscuits. It finds an immediate use as a paperweight for the pieces of parchment with the sketches of the camp.
A wellspring of happiness opens in Draco’s chest, warm and irrepressible. He closes his eyes and lets it fill him, lets it wash away the pain and hopelessness of the past seven years. He feels reborn.
“Because you pulled me from the Fiendfyre, Harry. Because you always saw me for exactly what I was, from that day we met in Madam Malkin’s—a spoilt, nasty, bigoted brat—and yet you saved me anyways. Because you’re the most stupidly brave person I’ve ever known, and I’ve never once seen you back down from doing what you know is right. Even if that means risking your own life.”
will make me happy, but end up doing the exact opposite. In fact, I usually end up fucking up my chances of future happiness as well.”
Draco barks a laugh at Harry’s gobsmacked expression. “Don’t look at me that way, Harry. I didn’t bake it myself, so you needn’t look so appalled.”
They both decline the offer of dessert. Harry thinks they both just want to get out of here, away from the din and the other people sitting so close around them. It seems to take forever for the bill to arrive, and then there’s another long wait for the credit card slip that Harry needs to sign. Malfoy’s lips press together in disapproval every time he sees their server attending other tables, making Harry feel even worse about the evening.
“Oi, Ron’s a very good teacher!” Harry says loyally. “I don’t have a head for strategy, that’s all. How about Exploding Snap?”
“Have you ever heard that the brothers were rumoured to be from the Peverell family?” He waited until I nodded. “The last Peverell married a Potter, and this cloak has been passed down through the Potter line ever since.”
Astoria. She has a genuine warmth and sharp sense of humour, and it isn’t hard for him to understand why Draco’s face always lights up when she comes into the room. Even if she doesn’t make an appearance, Draco always mentions her during Harry’s Friday visits, his pride and affection for her obvious.
“I said I hope that Ginny can drop by sometimes, when she’s not doing her off-season training. I’d like her to get to know Pansy. Greg and Draco said it’s all right with them. Would you mind if she joins us, if we’re at your house?”
He insists on helping with the washing up and putting the leftovers away. Malfoy is very particular about the state of his kitchen, Harry discovers, and the work probably could have been done in half the time if Malfoy weren’t dictating every step and watching to make sure it’s carried out to his satisfaction. Harry wonders if Malfoy’s this fastidious about everything or just his newly-discovered cooking hobby.
When Harry goes up to bed the following evening, he finds Malfoy pacing around the room, looking distressed. His books and notes are still scattered around his bed, and Harry’s first thought is that Malfoy was upset by something he read. Or maybe he’s having some kind of internal crisis about his career choice.
“Yeah, well if it’s about Quidditch, that’s something I can probably help with.” He rests his hand on Draco’s wrist, leaving it this time. “Draco’s the real teacher here.”
Potter’s eyes widened, then he pivoted in the snow and strode away in the direction of the Thestrals’ grove.
Too soon, a MACUSA employee pokes his head through the Departures doorway. “London Portkey passengers, check-in begins in five minutes. Please have your wands and passports ready!”
“Okay, okay. I just wanted you to know that I’d want to help, if you needed it. I owe your mother a Life-Debt, you know.”
He looks hopefully at Draco, who nods. Harry’s not pressuring him, he knows. The house is big enough that it will take some time to renovate, even with magic.
“Sure,” Draco says. Then he steps closer to take hold of the bottle and twist it in Harry’s grasp so he can read the label. “On second thought, I’ll pass.”
“Surely not all of them,” Draco says. He thinks of Harry, with his friendly smile and his attempts to greet people during his Knocturn patrols. There’s no doubt in his mind that Harry would be appalled by his colleagues’ greed and abusive behaviour. “Surely the younger ones aren’t doing those kinds of things.”
“No, that’s okay. It was just an idea I thought of looking at the map. We can definitely do it some other time,” Harry assures him. “We can find something to do inside, if you’d rather.”
Harry flounders for a moment once he’s inside, unsure where he should go, until Malfoy orders him, with mild exasperation, to leave his trainers by the door. He then leads Harry through the sitting room.
When Harry extends his hand, Draco clasps it between both of his own. They’re acknowledged soulmates now, for fuck’s sake, and Draco will be damned if he’ll shake Harry’s hand like a mere acquaintance or—heaven forbid—a business colleague. Harry allows the touch for a few seconds before pulling away.
Harry pins Malfoy against their closed bedroom door when Andromeda sends him upstairs to summon Malfoy for lunch. Harry has the revelation, just before he presses their mouths together, that seeing Malfoy’s familiar, pointy features up close induces very different feelings than seeing them afar. Thankfully, Andromeda’s preoccupied with Teddy and doesn’t ask why it takes ten minutes for them to arrive in the kitchen.
“Look,” he said as I started putting the food away, “I know you can’t be happy stuck here in the middle of nowhere, with nothing to do and only me. I thought you’d want to go, if you had the chance to.”
I resisted the urge to grab him by the T-shirt and give him a playful shake. To be honest, it seemed like I wanted to touch him all the time now, ever since I had decided that I shouldn’t. Even the thought of brushing my fingers over the curve of his shoulder or the smooth skin of his inner wrist was a small torment.
Parkinson and Malfoy look up at Luna blankly for a moment, then Parkinson shrugs. “We’d likely be here if you came on a different weekend, anyway. No point in putting it off.”
Harry tries unsuccessfully to recapture Draco’s lips before giving in. Reluctantly, he pulls his hands out of Draco’s pants and lets himself be pulled to his feet.
He and Draco made their way to the reptile room without speaking. Harry lifted the snake onto the hook and Draco lowered her into her tank. She immediately slithered into one of her hide boxes. Harry’s throat tightened as he whispered goodbye.
to leave?” Draco asks quietly after a moment. “Can’t you extend your lease, or even find a different flat if you need to? I suppose you could always stay with me until you—”
“I’m going to show you my bedroom now.” Malfoy’s voice falls to a deep murmur in Harry’s ear. “And my bed.”
“Mmm, not really,” Draco shrugs. “Dating a boy would have been unthinkable at school, given the expectations of my parents, and I’ve been focused on my apprenticeship since then. That’s not to say I haven’t found someone now and then who was, shall we say, capable of being discreet. But not dating.”
“Not all animals,” he chuckled. “Just the ones with, er, certain associations. You need to sleep some more, I think.”
“Not really,” she replies. “Crups and Kneazles are nice, of course, but there are so many more kinds of animals that aren’t kept as pets. I’m content with the work I do now and my own studies. I’ve learnt a great deal from Mr Scamander through our correspondence.”
“It’s probably going to talk to me, but I’ll take care of it with the sword immediately. And I’ll key both of you into the wards so you can end them with a simple
“If you let her up once, she’s never going to stop,” I called towards the ceiling. “I’ve seen what she gets into when she’s outside and you do
Luna extends her hands towards the flames with a happy sigh. The white petals of her long necklace of daisies shine brightly against her dark jumper in the firelight. They’re some of the last flowers left in the meadow now, but she told Harry she was determined to find something to wear for the last weekend of the summer.
He launches them, steady but swift, into the air again. They fly over the trees until the pale stripe of the road comes into view below, and they descend to skim over it. Harry tucks his head between Malfoy’s shoulder blades, trying to stay out of the wind as much as he can. The taste of the lake water is making him feel sick, and he wants nothing more than to lie down.
The warmth of the fire begins to make Draco drowsy, and he lies down with the crocheted blanket draped over his legs. He’ll just have a little kip while he waits. They’ll have dinner, and Draco will tell Harry about his eventful day.
On Thursday, he read in the Daily Prophet that the rates for Portkeys were to be increased yet again. The writer insinuated that the Ministry bureaucrats had become accustomed to the increased budgets afforded by post-war vault seizures and reparations, and now were loath to trim their bloated salaries. Draco silently agreed and thought with despair of the small purse hidden in his room. He’s been slipping in a few Knuts whenever he can, slowly building his savings. A Portkey to France seems even further from his reach after reading the Prophet story.
“He wrote to me after he heard about our house. He learnt a great deal about building while he was working on the Hogwarts repairs the summer after the battle, and he offered to help us. He was quite insistent on doing something for us. We finished it so much faster with his help, since I was only home from school on the weekends that year,” Luna says.
Harry won’t tell him exactly what’s going to happen, what destroying a Horcrux is like, until he has the sword in his hand. It will be too late for Draco to object to what Harry’s about to do—what
Draco sinks cross-legged into the grass and pushes his fringe off his flushed face. Harry’s heart gives a painful little flip to see him so open and happy. It’s sometimes hard to believe he’s the same person Harry knew at Hogwarts, full of petty cruelty and arrogance. Or even the distrustful and reserved one who wouldn’t even speak to Harry in April.
“I know, I know. But I might have done something a bit rash, and it would be safer for you to be at my place for a while. I’ll explain when we get there, okay?”
Draco turns away quickly to address Pansy. “Not every summer,” he murmurs. They share a look of understanding that doesn’t need explaining to anyone in the tent.
“No, it was more a matter of not wanting to deal with sycophants who were offering me jobs I wasn’t qualified for and arseholes who wanted to hire me so that they could exploit my popularity. I was inundated with offers during our eighth year, to the point where I started Vanishing most of my post without opening it. I wanted to work with someone I trusted and was comfortable with. I wasn’t even that particular about what the job was, as long as I didn’t have to deal with being famous constantly.”
I slid my hands over his bare forearms, allowing myself this one, forbidden caress, then pulled them away by his wrists.
I looked at him incredulously for a moment. “Potter, I can’t just walk into Hogsmeade and stroll into a shop. People remember my face, and they don’t want my custom, believe me.”
“To light,” she says solemnly. “May it illuminate new paths for us to follow and spark new hopes and aspirations. May it shine into our hearts today, the longest day of the year, so that we may carry it through the darker days ahead.”
“Wait.” He catches Harry’s wrist and turns his face away. “I need some time. Just a few days, please. I… have a lot to think about. And I have other people to think about besides myself.”
Harry finishes his last tour of the house just after five o’clock. There’s no trace of curse magic in any of the dusty, silent rooms, just the lingering sadness of a house long-unoccupied. Harry hopes Ernie and his family will bring the place back to life. It may be an eyesore on the outside, but it’s bright and well-designed on the inside.
“Are you breeding any of the others right now?” Harry asked, bending down to peer into a tank that had some rocks and branches, but no visible residents.
Harry keeps his expression neutral when Draco catches his eye, even though he has the terrible urge to make a face at him. This new phase of their acquaintance is still fragile, and both of them are trying to be careful not to disturb the harmony of the group by starting a row.
There’s no way to find out now, so Harry focuses on keeping his footing on the rough slope of the hill. It’s much faster going down than up, but Pansy was right about the toll on his knees. They return the way they came, back to the steep path between the mossy outcrops and along the river to the wooden gate.
It takes a couple of minutes for Harry to put his finger on it. He lingers in the hallway, near the door marked “2C” in tarnished brass, parsing the aroma into its components of pastry and meats. There are faint sounds coming from within the apartment—the clatter of cutlery, the dull impact of a plate set on a wooden table. No voices, though.
“Goodness, I haven’t seen her since I was at Hogwarts. She wasn’t much more than a baby herself, then. How many does she have?”
Other than sticking his tongue out at Malfoy on his way to the sink and aggressively Summoning the other dirty dishes from the table, Harry really does manage to ignore him until he leaves with his cup of tea.
Harry meets him halfway and they wrap their arms around one another. “I’m not worried,” he whispers in Draco’s ear. “I think you’re pretty amazing, too. For the record.”
“I thought it was just a matter of knowing the appropriate counter curses,” Draco says, gesturing at the small pile of gear. “Will I be able to watch you work?”
Harry smiled, grimly. “How’s it feel to know that you were the master of the most powerful wand ever created?”
“Yes, I know, but you could have a proper kitchen at my place. And you wouldn’t have to share a bathroom. And I think I’d like to have you there with me. Every day,” Harry finishes.
Harry shields his eyes with his hand to watch Draco and Scorpius near the water’s edge. They seem to be following each retreating wave out onto the wet sand, then trying to outrun the next one as it rolls in. The wind carries Scorpius’ joyous shrieks when the cold water washes over his feet.
“Bossy, bossy. Hermione’s going to demand that you join forces with her if she hears you talk like that.”
“Draco, I thought we’d finished having this conversation months ago,” she says with exasperation. “You know I’ll insist that you take something. Now tell me, would you like lemon cakes or chocolate biscuits? Or both?”
Harry was walking down the stairs when he heard what was unmistakably Draco’s voice in the Floo. Only by grabbing the handrail did he avoid tumbling all the way down to his foyer, which would have been clearly visible from the fireplace in the parlour.
If Draco were in danger, he wouldn’t have asked Harry to wait a full day before coming to his aid. Still, Harry indulged in a brief fantasy that involved him rescuing Draco from a ruthless band of desperate… somethings. And being rewarded with Draco’s admiration and gratitude. Very
Harry begins to set out the food, unshrinking plates and platters and filling the latter with the sandwich fillings and breads that are still warm from the bakery. He glances up and catches Malfoy watching with wide eyes.
be refreshing, but the calculating look he throws at Harry betrays him. Harry fully expects to get a jet to the face if they go forward with the plan.
Harry’s warmed by his interest. He’d love to show Draco how he does his job, but there are safety issues to consider. “It probably wouldn’t be a good idea for some of the more dangerous curses, but I can show you how I remove the smaller ones. If Erwina made any nose-biting teacups, I’ll let you watch.”
A mysterious virus spreading in wizarding communities throughout the world finally reached England two weeks ago. Despite the Ministry’s assurances that they had the situation under control (a statement which Harry always takes with a grain of salt, given their past failures to effectively manage anything from knock-off designer brooms to Dark Lords), the number of cases has exploded in the past few days. Drastic measures were needed, the Minister for Magic announced on the wireless two evenings ago, until the Healers could find a treatment for the disease.
He reaches into the top drawer and pulls out a square bottle and two glasses, and sets them on top of the chest of drawers.
He and Malfoy don’t speak again until they’re in front of Malfoy’s door. Harry can still detect the faint smell of burnt food, even now.
Some of the shops have begun to decorate their windows for Christmas, and it feels like a small show of triumph as much as a celebration of the upcoming holiday. Draco wonders if he can prevail upon Wharton to do the same. He’s a cheerless fellow at the best of times, but Draco is confident enough in his position now to make the suggestion. If he agrees, Draco will have to brush up on his charmwork; it’s been a long time since his mother taught him to conjure shiny Christmas baubles for the tree.
Harry gets up to take the whistling kettle off the stove. Draco is silent behind him while he fills the snail teapot and fits the lid back into the top. When he turns back, Draco is still watching Harry warily.
Salazar, Draco’s not sure he’s up for telling Harry this, not when he’s already wrung out from what just happened. But maybe it’s best to get this over with now. And he’s a little angry that Harry doesn’t understand the danger he was just in.
“The turtles are too loud,” he said flatly with a skeptical glance at the accused reptiles. “Are you certain that’s what she said?”
as they were wrapped around each other in a dim corridor just before curfew; the times he looked up in class or during meals to find Potter’s eyes on him, making Draco shiver with anticipation; their cold lips slowly warmed by open-mouthed kisses in an alley in Hogsmeade while Potter’s Disillusionment Charm cloaked them in the hum of his magic.
“There’s nothing for you to be sorry about,” Luna smiles. “If they ask me, I’ll tell them that we’re just friends.”
With a long, ear-splitting screech of metal on metal, Harry plunges the tip of the Sword of Gryffindor through the blade of the dagger. The impact jolts through his arms, making his bones vibrate and his knees buckle. He feels himself sinking to the floor with the sword still in his hands.
“What you said before about choosing the wrong things because you think they’ll make you happy. I just realised… were you talking about us?”
He took a few deep breaths and sat up. After he’d cleaned off his face and drunk some water, I made him lie down next to me and explain what happened.
Harry would like to emerge from this lockdown with all his fingers present and accounted for, thank you very much.
Harry scrambles up to follow him, brushing biscuit crumbs off his jeans and thanking Luna for the sandwiches. He swallows the burning belch that’s threatening to escape his stomach.
They follow the brook downward as quickly as they can, expecting to see two familiar shapes in the fog at any moment. But instead of finding their friends or the stone walls enclosing the sheep pastures, they hear the sound of rushing water nearby.
“Chocolate biscuits,” Draco answers. He knows Harry’s fond of them, and he can bring them for pudding tonight. “Thank you.”
Draco comes to a halt and rounds on Harry with a suppressed smile. “Are you making fun of me? Do you think I’m that much of a snob?”
The sound of footsteps behind him, just as he’s passing the garden, makes him look over his shoulder. It’s Draco, clomping across the clearing with brisk strides to catch up with Harry.
I was propped up on pillows against the headboard, while he sat cross-legged near the foot of the bed. Playing cards were scattered on top of the duvet between us. Seeing me ill had finally worn down his resistance to teaching me a game.
“Oh, darling, you know I sound like a dying Fwooper. You, on the other hand, have a lovely voice. And all those years of lessons shouldn’t go to waste, should they?” Pansy coaxes.
Seeing him through human eyes eliminated the force of his command, I noticed. I raised my chin in defiance. There was no reason for me to trust him. This plan I had concocted was my last hope, and I wasn’t about to let him interfere with it.
He runs through the mental list of people he knows. If the Aurors are going to hold him, maybe they’ll allow him to contact someone. He doubts that Wharton gives a shit about him, but there are others… Naia’s parents, perhaps.
When he takes a break to stretch his back and massage his right forearm, Harry sees that Malfoy is working on the far side of the clearing where Luna indicated a table would be. He has a pile of bare branches that he’s laying out, one by one, in a circular pattern. A piece of parchment, which must be his diagram, is levitating near his head for reference.
“I’ll prepare my best potions supply shop stories to distract you. Be ready for gripping tales of inventory logs and spilled Stinksap.”
Weasley settles onto the sofa while Draco returns to the kitchen to get his mug. Surely they can be civil until Harry returns. Weasley seems keen to do so. Nevertheless, Draco takes his time stirring sugar and milk into his tea, racking his mind for neutral topics of conversation that won’t lead to another row.
charm change to eight o’clock. He smoothed down his button-down shirt, patting his lower back to make sure it was still tucked neatly into his jeans, and rapped on the door. Draco opened the door so abruptly that Harry was startled into taking a step back. He was wearing the midnight blue waistcoat with the silver buttons shaped like tiny cauldrons, Harry noticed.
Fortunately, Luna’s not fazed by his lack of enthusiasm. “You’re going to enjoy it, Draco, you’ll see. It’s so peaceful falling asleep with the sounds of nature all around you. Then in the morning, you get to experience the dewy grass on your bare feet and the sun coming up from behind the hills across the valley.”
My general happiness began to be of greater concern to him, too, and he went out of his way to do small things for me that he hadn’t before. He surprised me with a second armchair that he’d found in some village antique shop, and merely rolled his eyes when I asked him to charm the upholstery a different colour. When he seemed about to retreat to the loft or head outside alone, I saw him stop himself and offer to play cards or ask me to show him my most recent sketches instead.
I covered his arms with mine to show him I wasn’t angry. Looking across the water, I thought of all that lay beyond the sea—the Netherlands, then the grand cities on the Continent, and beyond that, the exotic, sun-baked countries that I’d only read about. Those were the places where I might still be able to work towards my dream of redemption, of accomplishment and respectability.
“For the love of Merlin, can we please stop talking about Draco bloody Malfoy now and enjoy this fine meal? I’m going to ask Robards to send me on a month-long stakeout if I have to listen to any more,” Ron grumbled around a mouthful of salad.
Other than a few silent spells when the conversation lags, they chat easily about their days and some of the more mundane details of their lives. Harry has a flat by himself, he tells Draco, but he still owns Grimmauld Place and thinks about fixing it up someday when he wants more space. Draco relates his first intrepid adventure in a Muggle grocery store, having been advised to try it by a neighbour in his boarding house. It makes Harry laugh to hear that Draco was so overwhelmed that he pushed his trolley around for an hour before leaving with only some apples and a tin of soup that he didn’t know how to open.
Draco laughs. “I’m not surprised. She teases me about re-reading it so many times, but I think she loves that book more than anyone I know. She probably took it as a personal affront that you fell asleep.”
After tidying up their outdoor dining room, they cross the clearing to the tent. It’s almost as bright inside as it is out, thanks to the thin fabric. Harry takes advantage of their smaller number to stretch out on the cushions. His full belly and the sun-warmed air are making him content and drowsy; it’s going to be a struggle to stay awake.
“Yeah, well they weren’t exactly cheerful people, the Blacks. I’m pretty sure Sirius’ mum was half-mad and there was so much cursed shit in this house you’d think they were all trying to get themselves killed. Sirius ran away when he was sixteen and never wanted to come back.”
“They can’t turn a blind eye to stuff like that, though. Those licences are needed for materials that are volatile or dangerous.”
Harry grimaces. “My bosses already know my feelings about their way of policing Knockturn, so they weren’t really fooled. They said that Junior Aurors weren’t being asked for input at this time. So, I asked why this plan required violating the rights of innocent people who happened to live in Knockturn.”
It’s true that he’s been helping her as much as he can, but he still has plenty of free time to fill. And fill it he does… with Andromeda’s home library. At the rate he’s going, Harry’s easily going to exceed his goal of reading five books in order to shut Malfoy’s gob.
Erwina’s island is a few miles north. The last time Harry ran into Ernie, he got an earful about the difficulty of finding someone who would take on the job of renovating the remote house.
“No one’s going back in there until I get rid of it,” Harry says firmly. “I need to send an owl to Professor McGonagall. Do you think Mary has one?”
, he wants to know what it’s like to feel the heat of Draco’s body through his shirt. He wants to hear the low murmur of Draco’s voice close to his ear as Draco’s cornsilk hair slips between his fingers.
Draco hums in consideration and leaves to change. Harry’s still smiling at the image of him wrangling an unwilling cat when he calls to Harry from the bedroom.
Christ, maybe he shouldn’t have told him. Maybe it would have been better to take care of it by himself, but the aftermath of his own shock has left Harry less guarded than he should be. He moves over to sit beside Draco on the sofa.
They set off from an Apparition Point hidden behind the remains of a stone cottage at the edge of a Muggle village. The first part of the walk is easy, down an unpaved lane that threads between low farm buildings with muddy tractors parked beside them and barking dogs in the doorways. Once they get past the enclosed pastures, the moors rise steeply in front of them, already beginning to fade from green to brown as the summer winds to a close.
“Erwina’s, d'you reckon?” Harry whispers as the cat creeps forward a step to snatch up the meat. How does Draco even know it’s female?
When Harry takes his wrist and rubs his thumb over the scars there, Draco tries to pull away. He hopes Harry won’t ask to hear their story; that nightmarish moment is
“How sweet,” Pansy drawls from the shadiest corner of the tent. Unlike the boys, who are all a bit sweaty and dishevelled from traipsing around, she doesn’t have a hair out of place. “Will it be chocolates next, Greg?”
Their conversation in the tent bothered Harry so much that he finally talked to Luna about it a few days ago through the green flames of the Floo. She assured him, quite earnestly, that Draco did want to be friends with him and that he shouldn’t give up trying. Some people, she said in her typically enigmatic way, deny that they’re hungry when they don’t think they’ll get the meal they want, and then lash out when they’re hungrier than ever.
Ernie arrives at nine o’clock, as promised, with a brisk knock on the door and a cheerful smile that fades when he sees Draco. Harry invites him inside, but he tells them he’s due in Hogsmeade for an important meeting in an hour. And he wouldn’t want to keep the village Merchants’ Association waiting, would he? Harry looks over Ernie’s shoulder and catches Draco rolling his eyes.
“Merlin,” I breathed, lifting my fingers to touch the slippery material around us. The world beyond the cloak looked slightly hazy. Before I had time to wonder at this priceless artefact, Potter pulled me tightly against his side with an arm around my waist.
Harry’s muscles tell him that getting up is too much trouble right now. He closes his eyes and listens to the buzz of the insects in the grass and the rustle of the trees nearby. It’s amazing how different he feels from the Harry who lies on his sofa in his dreary flat, or breathes in the stale air of his Ministry cubicle. No wonder Luna said his aura looked off. Or drab. Or whatever.
Draco smiles softly through his tears, wishing he could live in this moment forever. Just him and Harry and the miracle of their coming together, an entire world in this little room.
“Yes, I believe so. With the Head Auror and the Minister aware of the situation, I don’t think anyone would dare try something. And they all know me well enough to take me at my word when I say I’ll curse anyone who comes near you.”
I could tell how on edge Harry was the entire time we were at the hospital. It was only after we got home and I kissed him that I tasted the sickly sweet remnants of a Calming Draught on his lips. He shook his head somberly when I teased him about it.
about Harry quitting his job or about Draco. Harry gets up to peek out the sitting room window before sitting down to eat. Once assured that there’s no swarm of owls around the building, they both relax and enjoy their breakfasts. However, Draco detects some nervousness in the way that Harry’s looking at him.
There wasn’t much to see but stretches of dull-coloured moorland and the faint shapes of other hills in the haze. Whatever his reasons, Potter had chosen a damn bleak and lonely place to hole up. I couldn’t see another house, much less a village, from where I stood.
He only hesitates for a moment before picking it up and carrying it to the table. It’s not as if Malfoy would try to poison him
Harry feels the anger boiling up inside him again, ready for release after simmering for so long. For almost ten years he’s been ignoring it, trying not to think about the foul, evil things that he touched—that his best friends came into contact with, too, trying to help him.
“A couple of trains, then maybe a bus,” Harry answers, knowing this is probably going to doom the plan. Draco isn’t fond of public transport. He’d rather pay exorbitant amounts of money to take cabs everywhere, even when traffic is crawling through the streets and it would likely be faster to walk.
“I’ll wager Potter has a lot of pull in the Ministry,” Wharton says, mouth curling into a sly smile. “He might not want the Aurors prowling around the shop where his soulmate works, giving him trouble. And Potter’s chummy with the Minister, isn’t he?”
There’s another note on the floor just inside Harry’s front door when he arrives home on Saturday afternoon. He sets down the shopping bags that he just carried up three flights of stairs and reads the note eagerly.
Those are awfully grim things to have in common… hardly something upon which to base a friendship, which is what Harry is beginning to suspect he’d like to have with Malfoy.
It’s almost too much to bear. Harry pushes away the memory and hurries up the rest of the stairs to his flat.
Draco is fascinated and asks more questions about the history of the island as they have their tea. Their hostess seems pleased to share her knowledge and goes on enthusiastically until she notices that it’s completely dark outside.
He does plan to take her advice about persisting with Draco, though. He may not be the most patient bloke, but he knows he has a stubborn streak a mile wide. He won’t let Draco push him away, even if it means settling for friendship instead of something more.
Almost as abruptly as he fell in, Harry’s jerked out of the water again. Malfoy’s flying towards him, wand pointed at Harry and eyes frantic. A Levitation Charm. It holds Harry just above the roiling surface until Malfoy can guide his broom closer. Harry’s heart thuds in his ears and his dripping limbs feel as limp as a puppet’s.
It’s hard to share her conviction, when everything else seems to be trying to pull him and Harry apart.
A thought occurred to Harry as he looked at the vine of a houseplant that had grown long enough to start twisting across the floor.
Now Harry worries that his most recent—and most shocking, to their ears—decision will undo the progress he’s made in getting his friends and family to trust his judgement.
“I was practically goaded into it. By the Head Auror, not by you,” Harry clarifies. “I don’t want you to think I felt pressured at all. This was my choice, and I’m sure it was the right one.”
“Yes, it does. Much better. The Ministry wasn’t too fussed about finding the best match when I was on parole.” Draco draws back to look at the wand again, almost unable to believe that he’s really holding it. “I was afraid you’d snapped it.”
Draco is standing next to the wardrobe, wearing only a pair of black boxers. He’s facing away from Harry, providing a breathtaking view of the pale expanse of his shoulders and back. Then, if that weren’t enough, Draco reaches over his shoulder and pulls his ponytail over it. Harry stares helplessly at the curve of his bicep, the bones of his wrist.
“It was a dagger,” Harry says, sitting back and looking into the flames. “A very old, ornate one. I didn’t get a very good look at it before I closed the box, though. And then I warded the fuck out of it again, almost as well as Erwina did,” he adds with a bitter laugh.
Harry leads them into the gardens along the river. Draco can smell the water—which is as foul as all urban rivers, if the memories from his childhood travels can be trusted—but the view is blocked by a busy street. It’s tranquil and dim here, and he wonders if Harry wanted to get away from the crowds for a little while. They walk down the wide path in silence for a few minutes.
may have stalwart allies to stand up for him, but Draco certainly doesn’t, not outside Knockturn anyway. He hasn’t felt this vulnerable since he first left Azkaban and fully expected someone to seek him out and curse him.
Ernie shakes his head, unable to produce one of his customary little speeches in reply. Draco flicks his hood up with a flash of a smile for Harry, then sets off. Harry watches him crane his neck up at the edifice of the house for a moment before focusing on the task at hand.
Draco gets a bitter dose of reality on a drizzly Friday evening as he walks home from work, later than usual, after finishing up his weekly inventory tasks. The potions supply shop was bustling, and he was called away from his work in the back room more than usual to assist customers.
I stared at him, confused at first, then furious that he thought I’d return his kindness with betrayal.
The following Saturday, the group gathers in the little garden in front of the Lovegood cottage to embark on their first outing away from the camp. Draco has returned, looking a bit pinched around the mouth when no one is speaking with him, but otherwise none the worse for wear. It’s another fine day, and the unanimous decision was made to have a hike and a picnic on a nearby hill that Luna knows well.
Ron gives Harry an apologetic look as he trails after Hermione. Harry’s not angry about it. He and Ron both know better than to cross her when she sets her mind on something.
The subject of a dog didn’t come up again, and when Potter told me two weeks later that he was going to visit the Thestral herds in the Forbidden Forest, it didn’t occur to me that he might return with a wriggling, half-grown mutt in his arms.
“It’s about time for breakfast. Shall we?” he asks, rising from the loveseat. “I think, since we both slept well, that we needn’t bother Mary about rearranging the furniture for a second bed, don’t you agree?”
“I thought we agreed there wouldn’t be a password for the tent,” Draco says. “It’s not like someone’s going to try to sneak in and steal the cushions, for fuck’s sake.”
It’s only when he’s taken a few dozen steps away from the safety of his bedsit that Draco hears shouted commands and notices the startled expressions of the people around him. In the distance, red-uniformed figures block the flow of foot traffic in both directions.
Draco belatedly notices the open paper bag on the counter, ready for the weekly supply that Susannah gives him. “Oh, you don’t need to—”
Seeing him look distressed, I transformed and hopped off the doorstep to stand in front of him. I didn’t often do this so close to him, but every time I did, it helped me grow more accustomed to being near him in this form. I picked up a small stone and tossed it at his feet.
As soon as the words are out of his mouth, he’s afraid that he went too far. He’s never dared tease Malfoy before, like he would a friend. Fortunately, Malfoy just gives a rueful smile when Harry looks back over his shoulder.
Harry considers sitting down, but feels too restless. He carries his mug to the low window and leans down to look outside. The sky is brightening a little at the horizon, a thin streak of pale gold. The house must face east, towards the inner islands. He moves to the front door next, opening it enough to feel the cool, wet air on his face. It’s still too dark to see much and the lenses of his glasses quickly get covered with a fine mist.
“Only because Ron isn’t here,” Harry mumbles. He leans down to reach for the wooden box at his feet and begins to put the chess pieces away. The knight takes a few swings at Harry’s hand with his sword to show his displeasure with their multiple defeats.
Harry holds up his hands with a grin and makes claws with his fingers, causing Malfoy to sneer in disgust. While he’s distracted, Harry tries to reach around his back for the pruning shears. He only manages to get hold of one of Malfoy’s wrists before he’s knocked off balance and catches himself with a hand against the wall next to Malfoy’s face.
“Certainly,” Draco replies, giving her a squeeze and planting a kiss on her curly hair. His throat starts to tighten with emotion. “I’m very proud of you, my dear, and I’m going to miss our tutoring sessions.”
The rain has lessened somewhat and the sky looks brighter, though it might just appear so after the dim kitchen. Harry’s thinking about the stream where it pours into the river and what the swirling water must look like after it’s been fed by a downpour, when Draco interrupts with another question.
“You’ve never talked about Azkaban,” Harry says softly. “I should have asked before now. Sometimes I forget that you were there.”
“I quit my job. Draco, if you don’t start putting things in those bags right now, I’m going to do it myself. I’m serious, we should go. I don’t think anyone’s going to come bursting in at any moment,” Harry says, in response to Draco’s startled expression, “but I don’t want to hang around much longer.”
. Harry scrambled to his feet. Would Teddy shy away from Harry as he would from a stranger, the next time they saw each other? He stumbled up the stairs and dry heaved over the toilet.
“I’ll smuggle you out some meat after dinner,” Harry whispered to the cat as he walked toward the mouth-watering smells in the kitchen. He had managed to placate Hermione and was more than happy to share his good fortune.
“Teddy had a birthday party to go to this afternoon, so I left earlier than usual,” Harry explains while Draco sets down his bag and his satchel of school books. “I didn’t think you’d mind if I waited here.”
Harry doesn’t think he deserves to be pitied by anyone. No one made him come here. He could be eating Molly’s shepherd’s pie almost every week if he’d stayed in England. It’s a regular weeknight dinner at the Burrow, where at least one of the kids is present on any given evening. She never batted an eyelash when Harry turned up for a meal.
When Draco leans forward to peek down at the street, the Aurors are gone. He gathers his bags and stomps up the stairs, almost daring his fellow tenants to open their doors to scold him. It’s been a year since he last saw Potter and, after the week that Draco’s just had, it’s truly the last thing that he needs right now.
at everything to end the Shrinking Charms. After taking the time to fold everything neatly before placing it in the drawer, he decides to turn in. It’s been a hectic day of running to shops for last-minute supplies, tidying his flat, and squeezing in Floo calls to friends and family to exchange a few words of encouragement before lockdown began.
he tells himself. Soon they’ll come crashing together again, one way or another. But now they both need to rest.
“I wouldn’t have been able to defeat Voldemort without the Hallows. So many things went my way out of sheer luck, like you disarming Dumbledore and me taking your wand. I can’t say I wish it had happened differently, because then he might have won.”
“That happens, especially at the beginning. Trust in your bond to keep you together. Believe me, the reunion will be all the sweeter for the separation.”
Harry guesses that Malfoy’s referring to the seizure of Malfoy Manor by the Ministry and Lucius’ trial. He heard the news that Narcissa left for the Continent last summer, but nothing about her son, and Hermione told him that Malfoy wasn’t among the students who returned to Hogwarts. At the time, Harry assumed that he was living off his family’s abundant gold and biding his time until he could go out in public again.
Draco still can’t make his voice work, but his legs, thankfully, aren’t paralyzed by the shock of seeing the photo. He leaves his satchel and runs down the stairs, through the stifling kitchen where Susannah’s husband is occupied with removing a row of brown loaves from the oven, and into the dim storeroom. He throws some Floo Powder into the fire while calling out the address for the hospital.
“But, what?” Harry turns around to face Draco. “You think I’m going to just go along with whatever I’m ordered to do? Or do you think I’m going to snap and hex someone?”
His arms wrap around Harry’s waist, and Harry feels Malfoy’s breaths begin to slow where they’re pressed together.
Potter seemed surprised by my observation. “Yes, a little. They do have names, but they’re not something I could translate.”
“Thank you,” he manages to say. He’s at a loss for words beyond that, so he gives Potter a wobbly smile that he hopes conveys his gratitude. Salazar, he’s going to be able to buy Naia a small library of her own.
He’s never stayed here overnight before. He’s not even sure when he last saw the room, since Andromeda usually keeps the door closed to protect it from marauding toddlers. Not that there’s much of interest for Teddy to find in here, but Harry has no doubt that he’d leave it in shambles, given the chance.
Harry pulls the duvet up over his chin and lets himself steep in the disappointment of waking up alone. The water switches off, then the soft clatter and murmured incantations of Draco getting ready seep through the door. When he steps back into the bedroom, he comes directly to sit on the edge of the bed.
“There you are,” Harry says when Draco steps out of the fireplace. With two long strides, he catches Draco around the waist, relieves him of the loaf of bread, and gives him a kiss in exchange.
“I’m grateful to you,” Draco hears his mother say softly. “I was so worried that he’d never recover from it all, never find himself again. But I can see how well he’s doing now.”
The smell of food greets them when they kick off their boots by the door. Parkinson is slicing bread while Luna fills bowls with soup from an enormous pot on the old-fashioned range. Malfoy is tucked into an armchair in the corner, back at work on his sketch. It’s going to be a tight squeeze for five people around the table, Harry thinks. He crosses to the sink to wash his hands after Goyle’s done and tries not to think about having to eat while sandwiched between Slytherins.
“That’s enough, both of you,” Andromeda says. “There’s an obvious solution here, if you would care to hear it.”
Harry gives up on the mole expert’s ability to keep him distracted and picks out another book. Two witches, this time, working together to crack a case involving illegal (and potent) love potions. The cover shows them stalking through a grimy alley, Auror badges catching the light of the street lamps.
And when Ginny didn’t have practice, sometimes his hand would find the curve of her waist. Or he would lightly trace the muscles of her thigh upwards to her hip. If she stirred, only then would Harry open his eyes, hoping to catch that first, slow smile of the morning, her red-gold eyelashes fluttering open. More often than not, she would reach across to pull him closer.
The air was wonderfully cool and misty after the rain. I transformed and took to the sky eagerly. Despite the fog hanging over the moor, I flew with confidence. This was my home territory, and every tree and stone was mapped out in my crow’s mind now.
Harry assured him, then busied himself with putting on his shoes and jacket. They were meeting Mary so she could take them to the Apparition Point in Portree, the closest town where they’d be able to find a few restaurants to choose from for their dinners.
“Have you sold any lately? And if so, can you tell me the quantity and when it was purchased?” Potter demands, his voice automatically shifting into the authoritative tone of his profession.
“For the same reason Lillian has been able to roam the house safely, I assume. No magical signature. Some curses won’t activate without contact with a magical signature.” Harry pauses, considering. “The objects Erwina bought wouldn’t have made it out onto the shelves if they cursed some poor shopkeeper first. The Ministry sends someone out when that happens.”
Davis and Greengrass are holding court on a sofa tonight, sipping their drinks and enjoying the attention of a pair of Ravenclaws. The girls survived the war with their reputations and Slytherin instincts intact, if their refusal to interact with Draco is any indication. At least the other Eighth Years acknowledge him, if only to pay lip service to McGonagall’s (very belated) crusade for Interhouse Unity.
“Harry,” Andromeda says, rising from the sofa to give him a gentle hug, “you know we’d love to have you here. And I have no doubt you’d be helpful—you always are. But I’m afraid I already have someone staying in the guest room.”
A golden Yorkshire pudding, roast potatoes flecked with salt and rosemary, a ladle of gravy over everything. Brussels sprouts and glazed carrots tucked into the remaining space on the plate. Harry swallows a lump in his throat at the sight of it all. He doesn’t remember being so moved by the sight of food since the Welcome Feasts in his early Hogwarts years.
“Yes, you know he’s brews for a living,” Ron said, interrupting Hermione before she could go off on a tangent. “You know he has a flat in Practic Alley because you followed him home last year and he turned around and caught you at it. Trying to hide behind a bin, no less! Future Head of Magical Law Enforcement right here,” he said to Hermione, poking Harry in the shoulder.
Aside from a tiny, brown lizard in search of a basking spot that startles Pansy, their lunch is delightful. Harry feels like he’s drinking the fresh air the way that parched soil soaks up the rain.
“All right, there is something,” Malfoy begins. “Something I need to tell you. But before I do, I want you to know that I’m not trying to embarrass you or force you to talk about it, if you don’t want to.”
“I’ve already been away for over three months. Three and a half. Teddy’s changed so much in that time. Starting to walk and saying words. I’ve missed all that. I’d feel terrible if I missed any more. I promised… I
Pansy looks a bit queasy. She’s taken off her hat and put on some oversized sunglasses instead, looking like she’s ready to star in an advert for French champagne or something. The image is probably going to be ruined by the Cornish pasties, Harry thinks.
Harry swings his legs off the bed, his face lit up with a smile. He’s been reading one of Draco’s books while he waited and decided to make himself comfortable, it appears. At least he kept his trainers off the blankets, Draco notes with relief.
Draco considers it, but decides he’s not ready to join a large (and intoxicated) crowd of Harry’s friends just yet. He shakes his head and attempts a playful tone.
Harry gestures to an armchair and takes a seat on the sofa, tossing the pillows and blanket out of the way. He can’t believe it didn’t occur to him to tidy up sometime in the past three days. Maybe doing so would have been too akin to hope.
“I hope so. I hate to think of the place sitting empty after all the work you did to make it safe. And if anywhere deserves a second life, it’s that house. I hope MacMillian isn’t going to give up on it.”
“That’s it, really. I promise not to drag you to the seaside or anywhere else, if you’d rather not. I know that would make you unhappy.”
“So, did you find out what’s bothering her?” Draco murmured. It took Harry a moment to realise that he had asked a question, so mesmerized was he by Draco’s proximity and the drowsy warmth of the room. “Are some of the other animals disturbing her with their rowdy ways? Maybe plotting crimes against snake-kind?”
“No, and I don’t think you’re a lunatic, if you’re still worried about that. Thank you for telling me.” I sighed heavily into his T-shirt. “What happened to you isn’t fair. It isn’t a burden you should have to bear on top of everything else you went through.”
Harry wakes in the dark, disorientated and stiff from sleeping curled in the same position for so many hours. When he remembers where he is, he carefully rolls onto his back and turns his head to look at the other side of the bed. It’s empty. Harry takes the opportunity to stretch like a starfish beneath the duvet.
The loo roll is still stacked in the corner and their bags lie on their respective beds. Otherwise, the room is back to its usual, unoccupied state. The doors are reattached to the wardrobe, perfectly aligned.
“Er, well. I actually dozed off for a little while last time,” Harry says sheepishly. “Pansy was kind of cross about it. She woke me up with a Stinging Hex to the feet.”
“Oh, I haven’t been there in a long time,” Luna says enthusiastically. “My parents took me when I was younger. It was quite breathtaking.”
“What are you thinking about?” Draco asks, squeezing Harry’s hand. “Your mind’s halfway across the sea, and you’re smiling about something.”
Draco rubs his cheek against Harry’s shoulder to reassure him. “No, it wasn’t that. I didn’t want to think about anything from the past. It was too painful, especially thinking about you. I just remember wishing that you’d leave without noticing me.”
Harry doesn’t think Ernie will keep them waiting, but he doesn’t object to getting back inside by a fire. The air is raw and damp, and he can feel it seeping through his jacket. And despite the fact that he can see the rooftops of Loch nam Madadh in the distance, he finds the emptiness of this place unsettling.
They don’t need to wade across the river, it turns out. There’s a place a short way downstream where there are boulders spaced just closely enough to step across to the other side. From there, it’s easy to follow the rushing water down to where the pastures begin, then back through the village to the Apparition Point.
“I assume so. She must have been living on birds and mice these past two years—yes, there are mice; I can hear them in the walls. I can’t imagine someone else’s cat could have wandered all the way out here, and she doesn’t seem feral, just shy. Aren’t you, sweetheart?”
“Both of you are just as capable as he is. And I already feel bad about involving two people; I’d rather not expose a third one to something like this,” Harry says.
“Yeah, prob’ly not,” Harry agrees. He drapes his arm across Malfoy’s waist and closes his eyes again. “You just wanna cuddle?”
Today’s going to be different, though. Today Harry’s going to ask Draco something that’s certainly beyond the usual scope of their arrangement. He squares his shoulders, mutters a few words of encouragement to himself that only the potted topiaries on either side of him can hear, and rings the bell.
“It’s all right, Harry. I think I made the game too difficult. I wrote down things as I perceive them, when I should have remembered that others may see them differently.”
“No, at a small academy here in the city. They offer educational certificates to people who either didn’t finish their coursework at a traditional secondary institution, like me, or who were educated abroad and need an American certificate for the careers they would like to pursue here.”
“Maybe not when they’re green and right out of training, but the rotten apples spoil the bushel. It’s only a matter of time until they reckon they deserve the same perks as the older ones. And since we’re only Knockturn vermin, they don’t lose any sleep over it. Better to spend a bit to stay on their good side, I say.”
One afternoon when I was in the city, meandering around to get my fill of sights and sounds that weren’t moorland, Thestrals, or Potter, I watched several people walking dogs while they enjoyed the warmer temperatures—tiny dogs with tartan coats, large dogs panting with happiness, and every size in between. Normally, I didn’t pay much attention to the people around me, but I noticed that the bland expressions they usually wore on the city pavements softened into something more cheerful and open when they had their dogs with them.
With a terrible roar of anguish and a mind-crushing surge of power, I was dragged into the suffocating blackness. The sensations of my body came back in an excruciating rush—pain, cold, wetness, the press of the uneven ground against my back and the weight of my sodden clothes.
“It would be political suicide for anyone at the Ministry who proposes that.” Draco holds up his hands when Granger starts to object. “It would be seen as rewarding people who are undeserving—yes, even if they’re only small children—or taking funding away from other programmes. Or there would be demands for government-run primary schools for
The dining table and chairs across the clearing were contributed by Goyle. He salvaged them from one of the homes where he gardens (whose owners were redecorating), then painted them white. The table sits under a dome of willow boughs that Malfoy finished weaving last weekend just as the sun sank behind the trees. In the intervening days since their last gathering, some kind of vines were planted around the base. They’ve already climbed more than a foot up the arbour, aided by growth-accelerating charms or potions, Harry assumes.
This gap’s an even tighter fit, but he manages to wriggle through into a tiny alley, where warm yeasty air flows from a door that’s propped open with a brick. With a groan of relief, Draco steps into the bakery kitchen. Jerome looks up from the worktop where he’s shaping loaves to stare at the sudden intruder.
“I might, as long as you’re not going to go back to being a little shit again,” Harry says, irritated. Then he sighs. He really does like Malfoy other times, too. Usually when he’s worked up and being ridiculous about something, like hoarding loo roll or having imaginary fevers. Or engrossed in his studies in the middle of a mess of books and parchment. But Malfoy would probably toss him out of his flat if Harry told him that. “Do you, er, you know…”
Draco opens his mouth to object, but before he can figure out what to say, Harry releases his hands and strides out the door.
It’s funny, Harry thinks, that this is what it took to make them get along after almost ten years of fighting. Not that they fight anymore, not since the end of the war. Harry only ever sees Malfoy here at Andromeda’s house, where they’ve continued to scowl and sneer at each other. Neither of them have felt inclined to move beyond this detente by doing something absurd, like trying to have a conversation. Malfoy did apologize to Harry, very stiffly but sincerely, when he first started visiting his aunt and cousin, but he’s never shown any interest in getting to know Harry. They certainly have a lot of history behind them that would make a friendlier relationship difficult.
He creeps over to the door as quietly as he can and looks through the peephole. The hallway looks empty. He draws his wand to unlock the door, then opens it slowly.
, and he feels slightly reassured. He keeps his eyes locked on Potter until the Aurors lead him around a corner and into a room with a small table and two chairs.
Draco nods, overcome as much from the thought of what’s about to happen as he is from the brush of Harry’s fingers inside his pants.
As he’s being led past the mostly empty desks of the bullpen, Draco sees an Auror stand abruptly from the corner of his eye. It’s Potter, watching the scene with concern.
“All right,” Draco says. He pulls Harry forward to give him a long kiss. “I’ve missed you like mad. The bond was pulling.”
“I’m sorry I’m not living up to your expectations,” Harry says, low as the rumble of distant thunder. “I didn’t realise you thought I could single handedly fix everything. I guess I hoped that you of all people wouldn’t see me as a sort of
“Speaking of glamorous cases, I have a big one I’m thinking of taking. An entire house with dozens of cursed objects, up in Scotland.”
place in the magical world where I could find people who wouldn’t immediately hate me. Not that everyone was friendly, of course. My father had no friends there, and people in Knockturn have long memories. But even a little bit of kindness now and then was enough. It got me through until I met Susannah and some other people who could see beyond my past.”
“No,” Harry says defensively, caught off guard by Malfoy’s sudden scathing tone. He waits until they’ve taken ten or so more steps to continue. “I guess I felt like I needed some distance in order to process everything that happened. It was hard to do that in England when there was so much pressure to move on after a few months.”
“Yes, okay! I swear I won’t look!” Harry almost shouts. The room suddenly feels about twenty degrees warmer. He can feel himself starting to sweat inside his shirt.
“I try to take care of it as I cook so that there’s very little left to do besides enjoy the meal. This will only take a few minutes to clean up.”
“Draco,” she calls, “I was just telling Luna about that banker from Geneva I met on holiday. Do you remember I told you about him?”
“You’re fine.” He took a quick step closer to catch me by the bicep when I almost lost my balance again. “I was just having fun. I wouldn’t let you get hurt.”
“What are you thinking about over there? Go on and say it, dear. You won’t hurt my feelings,” she coaxes.
Harry laughs. “Absolutely not! I don’t think that would suit any of us, even if they didn’t have a baby on the way. I mean Grimmauld Place. It needs a bit of work, but I can start on that right away now that I’m unemployed. And we’d only need to do up a few rooms to move in. What do you think?”
Pansy shakes her head, looking startled by Luna’s display of affection. Not even her sunglasses can disguise it before she manages to pull herself together behind a long sip of lemonade.
Merlin, it’s only their first night here and things have gone tits-up already. He sprawls in one of the sitting room armchairs and stares into the fire, trying to think about anything else. Teddy’s upcoming Junior Quidditch League game. The steps for safely removing a Skin-blistering Curse. All the dishes that Molly made for the last Sunday roast at the Burrow. He manages to calm himself a bit by the time Draco calls out that he’s done unpacking.
“He doesn’t think there’ll be any trouble for you two, does he?” Weasley asks, then relaxes when Harry shakes his head. “They’re not saying anything to my face, but I’m getting a lot of suspicious looks in the bullpen these days. Some of them can’t seem to make up their minds about whose side I’m going to come down on.”
With a nod, Harry made his way down the stairs and back into the late summer twilight. He hoped that Draco would at least say hello to him now. They had a safe subject to discuss, a topic that could
Draco glances around the room with dismay. Unlike his mother’s situation, this isn’t a genteel sort of poverty that Mrs Allandale lives in. It seems utterly unfair that it isn’t softened by the companionship of a soulmate.
She lights the lamps and the fireplace with a few swishes of her wand as Harry and Draco file in behind her. They’re in a small but cosy sitting room with a short sofa and two armchairs clustered around the fire. After they take off their coats, Mary leads them through the rest of the cottage.
He steps up to Malfoy and kisses him, now that he knows Malfoy’s not cross about him telling Andromeda. If he was, Harry would only be too happy to remind him about bringing up Harry’s joggers at lunch last week.
Potter immediately fetches one for him, then watches silently while Draco eats spoonfuls of whipped cream. He looks away quickly when he realises that he’s staring at Draco, and occupies himself for several minutes with tearing up the empty sugar packets into smaller pieces instead.
Draco shakes his head. “We’ve not been able to arrange that, unfortunately. But we write to each other regularly.”
They hear Luna’s distinctive laugh as they approach the room, followed by the low murmur of Pansy’s voice. Draco breathes an audible sigh of relief and rushes through the door without knocking.
“Oh, dear me, I stumbled off the top step,” Mrs Allendale says when she sees Draco approaching. “Would you be so kind…”
“I’m bi,” Harry says matter-of-factly, as if it’s his fiftieth time saying it instead of the first. “But I’ve never dated a bloke before. Have you?”
“Of course they looked in Knockturn,” Potter counters. “Where else can you find a bunch of wizards willing to do something so awful? No honourable witch or wizard would volunteer to hunt Muggleborns like animals. They murdered your uncle, if you recall.”
“No, I think I can manage. Greg wants to get some planting done, but I can call him over if I need him,” Malfoy replies, nodding at his friend.
“Let’s start by calling out everything we can think of, then we’ll go back through the list later to decide what’s feasible and which things we want to do the most. You start, Luna.”
“He’s your soulmate.” She grins with the same gleam of mischief that her brother wears. “And besides, when you guys get married, he’ll be an honorary Weasley too.”
“Of course. I think that’s a good idea. I can help you fill in the forms and give you money for the tuition and supplies. I like your drawings.”
“Yeah,” Harry says. He rests his forehead on Draco’s shoulder, smiling in wonder. “That’s all it takes.”
“I know you’re content to stay here almost all the time, but I think I need a change of scenery besides going to the shops once a week. I need to talk to other people.” I took his hand and squeezed his fingers. “It’s not that I get tired of you. I think I’d just
He begins to tilt his head to kiss Draco, but pulls away when a group of people approaches on the pavement.
“I know what’s in the wardrobe,” Harry says the next day, when he’s pushing trains across the carpet with Teddy and Malfoy’s flipping through a magazine in an armchair nearby.
Harry grips his broom handle, his legs tensed and ready to launch himself upward. And if his heart is beating a little faster, surely it’s in anticipation of flying against a worthy opponent, and not because of the intensity of Draco’s expression as he counts. Or the way the light shines on his fair hair.
It’s the thought that Potter may have intervened on his behalf that’s keeping Draco from sleeping. He turns onto his back and looks at the unplastered ceiling above his bed. That Potter might care enough to help him, enough to undermine his own colleagues, is somehow unbearable.
Draco sets down his water glass. Without realising it, he drank almost all of it in the ten minutes since the hostess seated them.
Draco braces his hand against the doorframe. Bloody hell, this isn’t how he expected his day to go, and this certainly wasn’t the way he expected his bond with Harry to be exposed. He can’t bring himself to deny it, though. The mere thought of doing that grates against something in Draco’s heart.
Draco stretches and props himself up on one elbow to look down at Harry. His hair is mussed around his face and his pale eyes are bright.
She looks well, Harry thinks as he steps into the dim kitchen. She wears her hair shorter now, just below her shoulders in dark blond waves, but she still favours flowing, patterned skirts and dangling earrings. The cold, flagstone floor doesn’t deter her from going barefoot.
He had left Draco’s flat on Sunday buoyant with optimism. He had stopped at the bakery for breakfast on his way home and had imagined bringing Draco a pain au chocolat or currant scone to have with his morning cup of Earl Grey. Harry might never get the chance to do something like that now, some little act that would make Draco smile. All because he had been so eager to help Draco himself, never once considering that someone else, like Luna, would be a better choice.
“I’m happy to help,” Draco says softly, then reaches across the table to give Harry’s forearm a squeeze. “Though if I’m honest, I’d like to get it over with. Would you mind going after we’re done here?”
“You’ll be the first to read it, I promise,” Pansy smiles warmly. “And you can tell me if it’s rubbish or not.”
“Of course. Didn’t you notice that we’ve been seeing each other more and more frequently these past few months? Past few years, really. It wasn’t a coincidence that we ran into each other at the bookstore, and it wasn’t a random whim that made you come to my flat that first time when you could have just owled me about the school. Not to mention the counter curse you needed, the only one that would work, required the presence of your soulmate. That wasn’t happenstance.”
Harry can almost taste the turkey’s crisp skin, the tender meat dripping with rich gravy, the roast potatoes. Closing his eyes, he remembers his first Christmas at Hogwarts.
The arrival of the server with menus saves them from having to make more small talk. Draco makes sure to smile at her when he feels Weasley’s eyes on him. Not that Draco wouldn’t do that if it were just him and Harry, of course.
Draco’s eyes dart around the room. They’ve landed in an alcove roped off from the waiting area, in clear view of the people there, who are watching them curiously. He pushes the ashtray back into Harry’s hand and steps away from him while reaching beneath his cloak.
As it turns out, Harry sleeps through both Malfoy’s return to the room and his departure in the morning. The only signs that he was there at all are the absence of his piles of belongings and a note left on the top of the chest of drawers beside Harry’s bed.
Merlin’s sodding beard, he had told himself on the walk over that he was going to come clean to Draco. And here was instead, digging himself a deeper hole and making up ridiculous stories about a snake.
Malfoy tilts his head in Harry’s direction and gives him a heated look. At least, Harry’s squiffy brain interprets that way. He climbs off the bed, sets his empty glass down on the chest of drawers—which, unhelpfully, keeps trying to dodge his hand—and staggers over to Malfoy’s bed. Luckily, Malfoy still has the presence of mind to put his own glass down before Harry falls on top of him.
“Pressure from whom?” Malfoy asks. “From the public? Did they want you to lead a victory celebration through Diagon Alley, or something ridiculous like that?”
“Are you sure that’s safe?” Pansy asks. She looks ready to bolt if the snake makes the slightest movement, eyes wide beneath her large sun hat.
“No, no!” Harry assures her. “It isn’t that. I explained that I’ve been coming over here almost every weekend this summer. Which I hadn’t told them before, because I was trying to respect Greg and Pansy and Draco’s privacy. I didn’t mention them last night, either. But now…”
“That your snake would just eat on her own eventually, and then I was going to tell you that I hadn’t actually spoken to her. Honestly, I was going to tell you,” Harry insisted when Draco raised his eyebrows. “I just didn’t want to miss my chance to talk to you.”
Draco levers himself up and returns to the edge of the bed. Neither of them breaks the silence for a time. Draco looks past Harry’s shoulder, through the open dormer window where the overcast sky is darkening. He can feel Harry’s eyes on him, weighing Draco up much like he did when they were eleven. Draco was ridiculously overconfident then, a little princeling who had never before experienced the sting of rejection.
“No, not really, Harry. I’m just a tutor, and still an inexperienced one, at that.” Turning to Andromeda, Draco asks, “Does Teddy enjoy school? Does he have a favourite subject?”
“Not for a while,” Parkinson says, sitting up from her pile of cushions to give him a stern look. “This is a
Draco’s already tearing pieces of meat from his sandwich when Harry arrives in the kitchen. A wet and bedraggled Lillian is curling around his calves, waiting for her treat.
As much as they’d like to stay tucked away, safe from disapproval (and worse), Draco knows they can’t hide here forever. He finishes putting his room in order and tries to steer his thoughts away from worst case scenarios. Instead, he lets the anticipation of seeing Harry at his door tonight quell his anxiety.
home. I truly wouldn’t want them to do something they’re uncomfortable with,” Draco tells him, reaching over to rest his hand on Harry’s shoulder.
Draco reminds himself to be patient on all these fronts. He waited seven years for Harry, and without any hope at all. As soon as he’s given the opportunity, he’s going to try to start making things right with the important people in Harry’s life. Until then, he’ll have to wait until they signal that they’re ready to hear what he has to say.
“That’s all right,” Luna says placidly. “We were just talking about what to do today. Pansy’s started writing her book.”
“Um, how?” Harry asked. He hated to ask, but he had the same uncomfortable feeling of being two steps behind as he did when Hermione was trying to explain something to him.
“Like I said, we had a meeting this afternoon, everyone who wasn’t on patrol or out on a call.” Harry sighs, looking over at Draco with apprehension. “They’re planning a new phase of the Knockturn initiative. Mandatory overtime and extra shifts. Authorization to search pedestrians without a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. Everyone and every place is going to be under very close scrutiny for the foreseeable future.”
“Come on, let’s get inside,” Draco says, turning to look at the cottage in front of them. It’s quite modern-looking, with large picture windows and a deck. It seems they landed in the middle of the front garden. Harry leads the way, stepping around the soggy remains of a flower bed, to the front steps.
Despite that, Draco still feels like a Plimpy out of water in Harry’s flat. It’s in Muggle London not far from the Leaky Cauldron, but the building’s magical through and through, with a Floo connection and wards. There are two bedrooms and a little balcony off the lounge, and the kitchen is sleek and modern. Draco can only imagine how much Harry pays in rent. He’s furnished it simply, but comfortably, with framed photos and some homely touches that are obviously gifts from friends and family: a crocheted blanket, a painting of Hogwarts that would be quite lovely if not for the lurid colour choices, and a few scraggly houseplants on the windowsills.
“No, no,” she says cheerfully. “I didn’t fall hard, just lost my balance. Ah, thank you, that’s very kind of you, Draco.”
“I’m sorry I didn’t owl ahead,” Potter says at last. “I wanted to give you an update about the school and I thought I’d tell you in person. I hope you don’t mind…”
Luna and Pansy lean back so he can see what’s inside the basket that’s on the table. It’s a snake with dull, green-brown scales, curled up and motionless.
“I haven’t forgotten your promise. I’ll tell you if I ever need to go. But right now, I can’t imagine ever wanting to.”
“I’ve been taking whatever jobs I could get for the past few years, Potter. Cleaning toilets was far from the most disgusting job I had, believe me. And despite what you think of me, I did try to find a job with Muggles, but I didn’t have the right documents.”
“You must be their best customer,” Draco observes. “Or are they giving you a famous-person discount?”
“I’m trying to! You know I’m making sure I treat everyone fairly here. And I’m being friendly when I’m on patrol.”
“It’s okay. It’s okay,” Harry says. He leads Draco to the sofa and makes him sit, much like Jerome did. “Are you all right? Are you hurt?”
The fourth time that Draco sees Harry Potter, he’s stepping into Wharton’s Potions Supplies just as Draco is emerging from the back room at the sound of the bell.
Potter pushes his hands into the pockets of his parka. He looks around the bookstore but doesn’t move, as if
“I told Ernie I wouldn’t take the job unless he hired you, too,” Harry says. “If he wasn’t going to take my word for your expertise and your character, I told him I couldn’t work with him.”
Harry plants a kiss on his hair. “It’s okay, really. I’m ready to think about other possibilities now. I was barely eighteen when I started the training programme. I’ve had time to learn that I have other strengths besides
Harry doesn’t think he would. He worked so hard on his coursework, studied non-stop for his exams at the end of June. And it paid off. Top marks on every test, he wrote to Harry proudly. They celebrated with a long weekend at a rented beach house on Long Island, during which they spent very little time at the beach.
“Harry, we already talked about this.” Draco lets his hands drop from Harry’s waist. “I want to stay here.”
“He’s a Metamorphmagus?” Draco murmurs. “How extraordinary. I’m sorry, do you mind my looking at them?”
Harry’s mouth lands hard on Draco’s, almost desperate to taste and explore. Throwing an arm around Harry’s neck, Draco lets him control the kiss. Gods above, there’s something heady about letting it drag him under like a warm wave.
“Reading first, while we digest our lunches, then wading,” Pansy declares. “You’ll like the part coming up, Greg. Not a single romantic moment to be found. Well, I assume at least some of the bandits are shagging each other off stage, but we don’t get to hear about it, sadly. I’d place my gold on that ginger fellow and the burly one he’s so chummy with.”
“Grudgingly impressed,” Ron admitted. “You couldn’t pay me to tutor first-year students, the cheeky little blighters.”
The room is warm from the afternoon sun, even with the window open to let in some air. Draco catches the faint scent of sweat beneath Harry’s cologne. He wonders how long Harry’s been waiting here reading—
Harry decides, after listening to these stories, that Draco is still struggling to reconcile the golden years of his early childhood with the dark times that came after. The loving and doting parents who cherished him above everything, with the people who dragged Draco into a living nightmare and failed to protect him.
Draco blinks his eyes open to find himself almost nose to nose with Harry. He wraps his hand around Harry’s bicep. “I love you, too.”
Harry does as he suggests, then reaches for the other shoe at the end of the leg that’s dangling over the back of the chair. It’s a long stretch, but he just manages to grasp the ends of the shoelaces with the tips of his fingers. Harry pushes the shoe halfway off, then Malfoy bounces his leg until the shoe flies off, narrowly missing the lamp next to the sofa.
His destination comes into view at last, and all his worries are forgotten beneath the anticipation that’s surging in his chest. Harry looks at his watch again and finds that he made it with only a couple of minutes to spare.
“Terrorising the residents and businesses?” Draco asks coldly. “Believe me, no one feels safer there.”
“Help yourself,” he tells Harry. “The gravy came out a bit thinner than I would have liked, but the flavour is good. I’m quite pleased with the Yorkshire puddings. I’ve never attempted those before. They’re really quite simple, it turns out.”
“Shut up,” he growls at the portrait. “Just shut the hell up and never speak to me again. The only reason I knew what to do is because
He closes his eyes and waits for the tug of Side-Along Apparition. There’s a rustle of fabric as Harry draws his wand, then a strong arm wraps around Draco’s waist.
“Aphids. They eat magical roses and a solution of powdered Dappled Apricot stone and goat’s milk is an effective repellent. It’s also the only use that I know of for this particular ingredient. Didn’t you do some research about it, if you’re investigating someone who used it?”
“Yes,” Draco says, glancing around to make sure everything is in order. He tilts his head towards the stack of books with a playful smile. “Want to borrow the Dickens?”
“All right then, gentlemen, raise your glasses,” Hermione said briskly, lifting her wine and pausing while Ron and Harry did the same.
“We’ve talked about this, Harry. You know I can’t afford half of your rent. I wouldn’t feel right unless I could pay my share.”
And when Harry popped into Neville’s flower shop to wish him happy birthday, Neville responded to his greeting with a baffled look. Harry watched in horror as he turned to Hannah and mouthed the words,
Draco trails off, imagining Mother opening the letter, finding the photos, and seeing an image of him for the first time in over seven years. He knows he’d be overwhelmed if the roles were reversed and he received something of the sort from her.
Draco rushes up the stairs to the small room where he tutors his students and sets his satchel on the table. His hands shake as he unfolds the newspaper. He’s been checking every morning for news of Harry, to no avail. There was a brief article about the raid on Tuesday that reported minor injuries, but made no mention of Harry specifically. Draco wants to believe that it means that Harry is fine, yet he can’t shake the dread that’s been gripping him so tightly that it’s hard to breathe sometimes.
“Would you mind making another pot of tea while you’re up? I think I could use a little pick-me-up,” Luna says, tipping sideways to rest her head against Greg’s bicep.
“Yes, of course. They’re very intelligent. And hungry. Sod off, you’ll get yours,” he said to the persistent mare. “I know you’re eating for two, but that’s no reason to jump the queue. There’s enough for everyone.”
As soon as they’re in the sitting room of the cottage, Harry sinks into an armchair. Draco moves toward the sideboard with the kettle, then changes his mind and squats down in front of Harry’s knees. It reminds Harry of the way he speaks to Scorpius sometimes, when Draco needs to reassure or console him.
“Oh, don’t mind him,” Luna laughs. “He’ll come around. And don’t be surprised if Greg is quiet at first. He’s just not the chatty type, but you’ll find he’s very kind once you get to know him.”
Draco’s breath catches when their eyes meet; he wonders if it will always be like this, even on their hundredth or thousandth meeting. Harry’s shy smile when he sees Draco is a luminous arc of current to Draco’s chest, and he feels lit up from the inside.
“It’s fine,” Harry assures him, as he sits back down on the sofa to pull on his wellies. “Okay, I’m ready to come through.”
He stops abruptly just inside the door, causing Greg to almost run into him. Greg, too, stands frozen in place. Harry steps up behind them and leans to the side so that he can see into the room.
