-"You were a naughty boy. You deserve a dementor's kiss." - Harry froze. Dementor's kiss? He can't be serious.
-"Of shagging you? Never, Pottah!"
- ''Kneel down! Now!'' - Blonde commanded.
- "I heard that your friends may have noticed the peculiarities in your behavior and health." - Draco felt disheartened by this statement
The visually impaired boy groaned as he felt the tall blonde man speed up his movements. He ran his tongue over the crack at the tip of the prick, his fingertips caressing Draco's testicles, bringing out a lot of loud and dirty words from the heir of Malfoy.
- "Malfoy, get on with making the potion! You always do it!" - Golden Boy affirmed, and Slytherin just nodded and said a soft "hmmmm." Potter set the cauldron and began to boil water. Draco couldn't concentrate. His hands refused to obey him and his eyes turned involuntarily towards the "naked" boy next to him. For a moment his mind went back to work and commanded:
- "Potter is all naked," - Heir Malfoy repeated, his eyes hazy. Zabini looked up from under his plate and frowned.
-Loosen up, Potty. It's only half of it. I'll give you more." - Griffindor squeezed his eyes shut and lifted his hips higher, hoping it would make him feel more. Blond's movements were very slow, which caused consternation to Harry. Nest-haired wanted to scream to make him move faster, but didn't know he was going to get the complete opposite.
- "Let's do it together, Pottyyy. " - Then Potter whimpered bitterly and cum gushed out of his cock, mucking their bellies. Draco simultaneously made three brutal thrust until coming off inside of Potter:
- '' Because that's what you do, right? You offer yourself to me, and I am willing to take the offer. '' Harry groaned for a long time as he felt a hand on his left cheek. He felt his world spin before his eyes. Gryffindor's self-control went to fuck. He clenched his hands on the edge of the tub and thrust his buttocks as far away as possible towards the cool hands. The nest-haired man was gasping for air in his lungs. He wanted it like nothing more.
- "Damn good" - Slytherin loudly snarled - "and so fucking mine"
- ''Aaaahhh, ahh....'' - Harry's eyes darkened with the sensation. He wanted more. He started fucking on his fingers. His moans grew louder.
Harry held his air. The mask of emotionlessness collapsed and Severus' face showed consternation and disgust. Fortunately for him, the bell rang. Ignoring the students, he ran out of the classroom, his robes waving majestically and hitting them against the faces of Hermione Granger and several Griffindors, leaving and contemplating a change of profession.
- ,, Dracoooo, Dracoo, ohhjoh, aaaahh...Pound that hole! Harder.....'' -
The fifteen-year-old did not care about his father's words, but decided to take him to a greenhouse where a "naked" brunet was supposed to have herbology. During a tour of the former school, Lucius's robes got crumpled and his hair was no longer straight.
- "More" - Potter's whines became the driving force for the blond.
The desk creaked slightly, and a long sigh elicits a squeak from the table as Draco shoves in half. Potter whined wryly and arched his back so that he bashed himself against the desktop. Malfoy locked eyes with him and Griffindor's bulging dick brushing against their stomachs. The Chosen one biting his lower lip groaned with pain.
- "Dray, can't you see he's wearing those ghastly Griffindor robes?" - Pansy asked dismayed.
- "You don't have to thank. A spell to see your greatest desires." - Nott finished
-" It's about Pottah!" - Lucius no longer cared about being dragged by a descendant. He thought he was about to pass out. Now what was Draco up to with this bastard?
Well, Harry's always had his cape with himself. He used it for spying on naked guys in bathroom. He's already admired bare bodies of Cedric Diggory, Blaise Zabini. Theodor Nott, Weasley Twinks and even Neville Longbottom. Naughty Harry. Using father's heritage for fulfilling his sexual fantasies? Unfortunately Scarhead was too shy to reveal his presence and ask for help with losing his virginity. Also he didn't enjoy the size of their ''friends''.  It wasn't decent enough for his standards.
Slytherin didn't give up so easily. Had everyone gone blind? If so, he will restore their eyesight.
- "You look more sinful than usual" - Slytherin pushed further, and green-eyed felt his hole stretched slightly and opened for a tall young nobleman. - "Ohh God! You are so tight and perfect."
- "Daphne! Doesn't a respected golden boy seem naked to you?" - The blonde looked at Harry. She scanned him and looked at Malfoy as if he were crazy and giggled. At the same time she pretended to cover her breasts with her hands and said:
Come closer to Draco, his mouth went dry. He saw Potter with his back to him. He bit his lip as Harry tugged his hair back. A picture of those cheeks squeezing them appeared in his mind. Lucius noticed his descendant's dreamy gaze and spoke:
That same evening, Professor Snape went to his class with Collin Creevey to make up his detention for taking pictures of a teacher in an accident at work. Young Malfoy's hallucinations and complaints were unbearable. As he passed, he noticed that the door was ajar. He frowned and walked over to open them. He strained his hearing and a groan reached his ears. He supposed there was a fight in this room and someone was hurt.
His hands were clenched around Malfoy's calves and his mouth stretched as far as he was standing. He heard the murmurs of satisfaction above his head and felt the pride melting over him and warming his heart
- "I will stop when you are called Malfoy. Now ride your daddy!" - Malfoy rested comfortably on his elbows, carefully scanning Griffindor's beautiful body and anticipating further movements. Potter directed his penis towards its entrance, after a while lowering himself down. He groaned, feeling nine inches inside him, and began jumping upward.
- "Everything is fine. My limbs are fine and my work is going great. I started getting along with Potter." - The classroom's jaw dropped. The only verbal response that could be heard was:
And then Professor Snape pulled Draco and me in a hug. It was the weirdest thing that had happened all night. Professor Snape was hugging us and Ron and Neville were staring at us blankly. I must say I was glad when Professor Snape let go of us. It’s just weird, him hugging us.
We didn’t sleep in on Christmas morning. Both too excited to give each other our Christmas presents. I had Daphne order some beautiful hair ties and elastic hair bands. We picked out some stuff from one of her beauty catalogues, so I would be able to make even prettier braids into Draco’s hair. Draco really loves them, by the way, and I love how they brighten up his hair. Draco got me some very soft sweaters and a magical set of pens that change colour while writing. I’m wearing one of my new sweaters now, I love how Draco can’t stop hugging me when I wear them.
“Because Molly’s lemonade is the best there is,” Draco tells her.
Of course, Malfoy is wearing Slytherin colours. He’s a strange speck of green next to all the red around him. He sits next to Hermione, who looks at Malfoy from time to time. Probably wondering how they ended up with a Slytherin among their midst. Harry just thinks it’s nice. Seeing all his friends together in one place. Supporting him in his favourite pastime.
Your Harry James Potter
Harry James Potter.
Draco stares at his arm. He follows the lines of his mark with his finger. The skin right next to it is red and swollen. Harry will leave today. Draco shouldn’t have flushed the potions down the drain. Now he will have nothing to take once Harry is gone.
Draco moves his finger over the mark, follows the lines of the skull, the cause of all his misery.
Malfoy his hand shakes and he puts his teacup down. “You don’t want them,” he stammers.
‘I know you don’t want anyone to know, but my uncle, Professor Lupin, has told his husband about you,’ Harry writes. ‘He’s deaf too and he sent me a list with books that might be helpful for you. Most of them aren’t in this library, but I can ask him to send the books if you want.’
“Just as Ron and Hermione?” Neville jokes. “Sure, Harry. I might have a scar above my eye, I’m still not blind.”
Riddle his smile just broadened. He said I wouldn’t need my wand. And that he’d waited a long time for this, for the chance to see me and to speak to me. I told him we could speak later, that we now first had to get Draco to the hospital wing. But Riddle didn’t care. He said we were going to talk now. Something was wrong and I looked again at Draco, wondering out loud how he had gotten like this.
I was relieved when he woke up, but not when I saw that professor Lockhart was leaning over him and tried to heal his arm. I don’t know what happened, but I think he only made it worse. Pansy screamed at the professor for some minutes before she and Goyle escorted Draco to the hospital wing. It looked like his arm was all elastic when they moved him.
We’ve been flying around in the fields behind Mr & Mrs Tonks house. It’s nice to practice together for the coming Quidditch season at Hogwarts. I’m really looking forward to being a part of the Quidditch team together with Draco. And so is Draco, he won’t shut up about it in the letters he writes me. We write almost every day. When his owl comes to deliver his letter I can’t help but smile. Tonks says it’s super cute, Mrs Tonks says it’s heart-warming and Mr Tonks just tells me to make sure that Draco will always know how much I love him. He’s a bit of a sap, Mr Tonks. He buys flowers for Mrs Tonks every other day.
“I’m fine,” Harry says and turns his back to his brother. He can’t look at him and see the pity on his face. It will make it all real.
“She’s been keeping me up at night,” Draco says. Harry looks at him and sees the dark circles below his eyes.
“Well, maybe I’ve changed,” Harry says. He looks back at the fire. Maybe he should just tell Hermione where he’s been sneaking off to the last couple of weeks after class. They all wonder and even think he’s secretly seeing someone. Ron already asked who the lucky girl is. But what if they think he’s got the hots for Malfoy? Because it isn’t like that. He just wants to help Malfoy, make his life a little easier to handle with his disability. That doesn’t mean he’s into him, does it? Even if Harry thinks Malfoy is quite pretty. Beautiful even, with his blond hair and long fingers. They don’t need to know that Harry dreams about him on most nights.
“Traitor,” Ron says.
“What do you know about kissing?” Ron asks, his chess game forgotten.
“Gross,” Teddy comments from the doorway making Harry and Draco laugh into their kiss just before they separate. Harry slides his free hand over Draco’s stomach and leaves it there while he rests his head on Draco’s shoulder again. Draco looks at Teddy who looks at them with small eyes. Draco wonders what the little kid thinks of them from time to time.
“Yeah, sure. No problem, man. We get it.” Ron gets up and hugs Harry and then Draco. “Don’t worry about it, cry all you need, and we’ll drink a beer soon to celebrate,” Ron tells Draco before he lets go of him. Draco can only nod his head in agreement. He’s afraid that if he tries to talk, he will break down completely. Draco somehow finds the strength to hug Hermione and congratulate her before he turns and takes Harry’s hand. Harry swirls them away from Ron and Hermione’s cottage.
Draco’s hands are soft. Harry knows this now. Because he holds them regularly. Other students stare. Neville jokes about it, says it’s nice that for once he isn’t the centre of attention. Harry doesn’t mind that much. The truth is, he doesn’t care what others think. Not now that Draco is his official boyfriend.
Sunday 25 June 1995
Harry is allowed to spend a week at Ron’s place. They fly around the large garden most of the time, joined by Ginny, Fred and George. The last two teach Ron that he’ll never be good enough to join the team, but Ron for once doesn’t let his twin brothers destroy his mood and doesn’t give up.
Nathan lets go of the table and takes a wobbly step towards Lily. Harry shakes his head. Ever since that little man discovered how to walk a couple of days ago, he wants to do nothing else. Harry doesn’t know how many bruises he’s already spelt away, as Nathan’s endeavours have more chance of failing than succeeding, ending with Nathan on the floor with tears in his eyes. But it doesn’t stop him from trying again. And crawling is no longer an acceptable means to get from one point to the other. Sometimes Harry wished that Narcissa would still talk to them, he’s dying to know if Draco was the same when he was little. Harry can see it, a younger Draco struggling to stay upright, but determined to make it to his destination without falling.
And on the last day before the Easter holiday, Ron and Neville came up to me during Charms to apologise for thinking I was the heir of Slytherin. They know I would never attack Hermione. Ron held out his hand and I shook it. Draco gave both of them an evil look, but I told him during lunch that he had been just as bad, ignoring me all the time. That even though he never thought I was the one causing the attacks he still made me feel like there was something wrong with me. And that if I could forgive him for that, I could also forgive Ron and Neville for thinking what they did. Draco said he would try to be nice to them again, but only if they would treat me with respect.
They stand up and shake healer Burke’s hand. Harry places his arm around Draco’s waist as they leave the hospital. “It’s all going to work out, I promise,” he says. Draco wishes he could still believe that.
I love watching Draco play. He’s really good and looks so beautiful on a broom. And now even more since he stopped putting so much grease in his hair and it falls more natural around his face. Mom, dad, I’m sorry, I’m hopelessly in love with him.
But before I could another try, Draco was going to try to cast a Patronus. He would stand behind me so that the Boggart would turn into a Dementor. I felt cold and the white fog was surrounding me again when I heard Draco’s voice, so steady and certain. And then a beautiful Tiger leapt out of his wand and chased away the Dementor. Professor Lupin was speechless and I just looked at Draco and felt my heart almost burst out of my chest. Draco had done it on his first try! I kissed him then and Professor Lupin had to scrape his throat to get us to focus again. He was very impressed and told us a female Tiger was a beautiful Patronus to have. That it represents patient and protectiveness.
Love,
Hermione sits on the sofa next to Harry. Her nose is buried in a new book. She has finished all her homework, just like Harry. If only Ron and Neville weren’t stuck on doing theirs. Then they could go fly around for a bit. Maybe that will help Harry relax. Harry can’t focus on anything. His mind is on Pettigrew. And Malfoy keeps popping up. Harry dreams about him most nights. That reminds him, he still needs to go and talk to Remus. Harry needs to ask him if there is a classroom somewhere that he and Malfoy can use. And he should go to the library and look for the books Sirius had recommended. Maybe that will get his head off Pettigrew for a little bit. Only Harry doesn’t want to forget about Pettigrew. He needs to stop that rat. There is no other choice. Not as long as Neville and Iris might be in danger.
She smiled, softly. “I’m glad to hear it, Potter.” She hesitated, and then seemed to come to a decision. “My apprentice may’ve hinted that you helped him complete the Animagus transformation. Very difficult for someone who hasn’t done it himself to teach another. But I am certain that no student of mine would become an unregistered Animagus.”
Harry says.
“Oh, but Draco,” Pansy said, turning to him, “they’ve been doing so much better since all that silliness during our school years. I know you and Scorpius have been traipsing all over Greece for years, but it really has been better. This is an unsettling change.”
“It hasn’t!” Harry said, spinning around. “I fucking hate him. He doesn’t want me. He wants the fucking prize money. Where did you get two million galleons to throw away on me and one of these men anyway? Who the hell would sponsor a dating programme?”
“Feng shui consultation?” Harry suggested, grinning. “Sephora’s really into that right now.”
“Because I want to be with you,” Harry said. “You wanna play Cluedo? The kids are coming over.”
“Something happy,” Hermione decided firmly. “Something that will make us happy and other people happy, too.”
“It’ll work,” Eloise said firmly.
“I hate you,” Draco grits out.
about that sound
“But there was something different in our earth—something they didn’t have in their own. The earth’s own magic. There is a great deal of it here in Atlantis—even those without the use of magic can see and feel it. The exposure to it caused some of us to be born or duplicated with magic ourselves, and that was…that was unexpected and dangerous. Something they could not abide.
Proulx says, gesturing angrily, and, in Harry’s estimation, Frenchly.
They sprang apart, horrified, and swung to face the single portrait in the room, positioned above the desk Harry used for brewing. Dumbledore was beaming at them, and where on earth had he come from? How many times had he watched them working together in this room, how many—
“Yes?” he said.
“I’m gay,” Draco says, as if this trumps all. He still can’t stop looking at Hermione’s face, though.
Luna shrugged, striding over to the window and snapping the curtains open. Harry groaned at the sudden influx of light. “I really couldn’t say, Harry. I’m neither a Muggle nor a San Franciscan.”
to repair the damage of their mistake, and still Teddy struggled.
But, he was in his daily life hell, and they set sail tomorrow morning, not one person giving a single fuck of all the lesson plans Draco still had left to write.
He checks his watch again, frowning at the way time seems to be disappearing. What he wouldn’t give for a Time Turner. He has another twelve hours before he can even think about a nap, and they really need to finalise this set design before he leaves to meet with his makeup and hair artists.
that from the beginning.
“Of course you shall,” Snape muttered.
Draco tugged at his shirt hem, and Harry obediently lifted his arms. Everything was silent then; nothing but the rustle of cloth as it hit the floor. This was that event horizon thing, Harry thought. He tried to gauge Draco’s thoughts, but he’d long ago set his wall sconces to never rise above a certain luminescence, and it was too dark now to see clearly.
, Harry writes on the paper.
Harry narrowed his eyes. “A fellow could, if he weren’t married with an infant.”
Fortunately, given the long wait between turning in their notices and Padma and Theo’s Struggles and wedding actually taking place, they’d managed to hone a few skills with some themed party planning in the wizarding world, and a few small weddings in the Muggle one.
Harry was practically chirping the next morning, and all of the week following. His potion in class was ‘
“I really wish I could talk to the Queen,” Potter said, once they reached the end of the article. “Or Hermione.
“Mrs Black, keep it down,” Harry hissed. Her screeches were known to cut through a Silencing charm.
Then, without another word, Draco turned and strode from the hall. Harry gave Hugo Black one last glare and followed him out. No one spoke again until they were outside in the hot sun once more. They took up a dejected sort of wander away from the museum, no destination in mind. Mrs Black had returned to her writing desk, but she stared off to the side of her portrait, her face tensed sadly.
Ron popped in with Hermione and the kids, and Harry went to meet them.
Articles from the last week were focused entirely on the ship sighting over St James Park. People from all over the world were talking about their own sightings, which had never before been taken seriously; cattle and livestock mutilations; missing people; missing time.
“How the fuck should I know?” Harry murmured in return, taking care not to move his lips enough for the more industrious students to pick out his words.
“Um, a family, maybe. Like, kids, you know?”
“This is fucking terrible,” he said under his breath. "We'll never get a break."
Harry heard in his mind, and nearly jumped at the sound. He could practically
worse than having to live a life without redamancy. But who is he to judge? He walked willingly.
“You a squib now, Potter?” he asked quietly. “Are my dreams finally coming true?” He blocked the rest of Hufflepuff with his back, giving them the illusion of being alone in a room full of people.
“Mm?” Harry says, otherwise occupied.
“Not exactly,” said Hermione. “Fortunately it’s cumulative, so it’s 100 percent minus 4.5 and then 95.5 minus 95.5 times 2.25, and so on.”
“Merlin, save me from Hufflepuffs,” Draco muttered. Harry sniggered.
,” Malfoy said. He pushed Harry back, tugging him over to the bed and stripping him with quick efficiency. Harry kissed his way down Malfoy’s neck while his fingers worked at Malfoy’s shirt buttons, and soon they were both naked and hard. Malfoy pushed him back onto the bed, and Harry grinned at him, delighted with this turn of events. He erected a silencing charm and tossed his wand to the floor.
Draco nods, turns, and Apparates. Harry busies himself pouring them both another cup of tea-whiskey while he waits. When Draco returns, Harry’s on his third, but his hands still aren’t steady. Why is he having this reaction to Draco? He’s never reacted this way to him in his entire life and it’s patently ridiculous that now, when he actually cares whether or not he looks like an idiot in front of Draco, this is when he does.
Next Sunday is Draco’s birthday and a century to the day since Harry first kissed him. He thinks about the Mirror of Erised sometimes and regrets not listening to Dumbledore. He has dwelled on dreams and forgotten how to live. Harry stares into the fire and he aches.
big distance between Earth and even the possibility of other lifeforms, and there’s no guarantee that there are even any habitable planets orbiting that star.
That did sound nice, actually.
The common room was strangely empty when he got back. Only a few younger years spread around the cushions and fireplaces, books and parchment laid out in front of them. Even Luna was gone. Disappointed, he headed down the low-arched hallway that led to the boys’ dorms. The eighth years’ room was at the far end of the cul-de-sac of rooms.
Neville glanced at his wall almanac. “Oh, bollocks, it is, isn’t it?”
Harry passed him the gravy. “We made the choice because we had to make the choice,” he said. “There’s nothing else stable we can tether it to except people.”
“The food-whats?” Draco asked, scandalised.
“Mr Dursley is a Professor at Hogwarts and you will treat him with respect, Mr Leotard,” Potter sneered.
But that was where the dream skewed from reality. In the dream, his parents were standing behind the Dark Lord—which had not happened—and they were frantically gesturing for him to come to them, to escape with them. Between him and his parents, the Dark Lord soliloquised.
The next morning, a fifth year prefect stopped them on their way out the door and reminded them to uphold Hufflepuff values. Harry had sighed, nodded, and felt compelled to straighten his black and gold tie when, upon glancing at the very conspicuously placed mirror beside the exit, he saw that it was an utter mess.
“Don’t pretend like you aren’t gagging for my company,” said Harry as he spelled a patch of grass dry and laid out a blanket. They lay back and stared up at the stars as they waited for the ceremony to begin. Rosie would probably be doing the same thing somewhere in Cambridgeshire.
Draco’s eyes sunk closed, and when he opened them again, Harry was sure he’d take a step closer, that he’d reach out—
And when he reached the Dark Lord, the Dark Lord beckoned him in and…hugged him.
“Where is it?” asked Harry.
“Yes,” said Harry, exasperated. “Seahorses are raised by their fathers, but Seabiscuit’s abandoned him and his siblings. The others were eaten by an Anglerfish, but he was lucky enough to get tangled in a kelp forest and I rescued him before he could be overtaken by a reef of particularly fertile oysters.”
“I may vomit,” Draco said.
“I was thinking,” Harry said, “we could try to figure a way around the Portkey block. Sostrate still has an army and enough magical people to protect the island, even if she doesn’t have all the current Muggle tech. All we need to do is get the spell done to fight the aliens, and then I can try pulling the Boy-Who-Lived card to get us leniency.”
it’s a lie against my magic and my sexuality.”
“Tell us what happened, from the beginning,” Malfoy ordered, and that, at least, seemed to snap her out of it enough to speak.
hydromeli, served by the
“Isn’t there instant messages, too?” said Millicent. “I’ve seen Dudley use instant messages to talk to mates from school.”
“Family magic,” Draco inserted.
. Then, to get things back on safer ground, he said, “How’re things with Lavender? Is she going to be your partner full time?”
Draco forced himself to remain calm. The man’s placard had read ‘Leopold’. Further, he’d introduced himself as Leopold Leopold III, at length, not even an hour ago. Perhaps Potter should go back to his old spectacles and have a hearing test to boot. Or perhaps he was being a dick on purpose, which Draco wholeheartedly approved of.
“You do
Harry’s body warmed with his dinner, and it felt to him as if the food was wholly responsible for returning blood to his face and fingers, after it had all drained away in Atlantis. He hadn’t realised how tense he was until it began to melt slowly off.
“Harry,
Slytherins saved their own. Hufflepuffs saved the world.
“I’m not
“Good morning.”
Harry nodded. “Yeah, I’m about half through it – there’s some really strange interactions between mundane chemicals and certain types of magic.”
It was sad, and it was inevitable.
“What else could I’ve done?” Harry says, voice dull. Nigella’s not getting any brighter, is she? It was just a trick of the light. “No work romances. We would’ve both been sacked. We never would’ve finished our research. And Draco’s been working on manias to try to help
Severus was unimpressed. “Once one has lived through a decade of Dumbledore and the Dark Lord’s service, very little terrifies.”
Harry didn’t much care about all that. He cared about the way Draco looked at him when Padma started speaking to Nott’s grandparents.
“We’re aiming for late December or early January,” Nott said. “We’re both Capricorns. It seemed fitting.”
“Oh good, you’re awake.”
Harry smirked. “Brings back memories, I’m sure.” Then: “Do you think it would bring back memories for Bulstrode? She’d probably try to exorcise you if she ever found you in her room.”
. He read the
“She okay?” Harry felt compelled to ask.
And that’s why it takes him a few confused seconds, after he feels the cut lancing from his temple to his throat, to stop fighting and fall down. He’s jerked behind the table again, Demelza looking down at him with huge, black eyes.
or you will not take him at all,” said Andromeda.
“Hello, Nott,” he said, reaching out to shake.
Minerva stared at them for several more minutes. “And you’ve elected to take this ‘ICW task force business’ through alternative channels of communication why?”
They shared another speaking look. Ron was the first to look away. Harry bent down to gather more false morels.
The Queen answered dozens of questions with grace. Everything from ‘What happened to others on your island with magic?’ to ‘Do your people realise what has happened to them?’ to ‘How did the spell that hid your island work?’ All of these, she responded to evenly, with detail and an obvious personal knowledge of her subjects.
are most unstable without—without the people we love. We need to—” He pauses, swallowing. “We need to show it we dislike them enough to be a stronger danger.”
The Queen gave them a thorough once-over, and then gestured with one long-fingered hand for them to enter the room.
“What’s nesting? Like a bird? I’m not a bird.”
She nodded, sipped her lassi, and swallowed. “Yes. Ms Jones was able to get us Portkeys to all the main Mer liaison sites, so we managed to visit them all today in good time. It’s quite interesting, really. The more established Mer tribes have designated spots to meet them and these little bells you can ring to indicate you’d like a meeting—under Anti-NoMaj wards, of course—”
-esque landscape painted on canvas.
The Gryffindors never listened to the professional matches like this before, not even Ron. He’d never had someone who could call his fantasy team shit one minute and then smile proudly at him in Potions the next. He’d never noticed what he was missing out on until now, and the confusing feelings inside him made it both wonderful and terrifying.
Malfoy’s smirk came slowly, but when it did, it made Harry’s chest clench in the most uncomfortable way. “I am known for my biting wit,” he said loftily, returning to his closing.
Harry huffed. She would weasel it out of him eventually if he didn’t just tell her. “We had a… thing. A few years back. It didn’t end well.”
She returned to the table and retook her seat, folding her hands in front of her. “But, Atlantis cannot comply. Our quest requires that all people of the world know of us.”
He’d never really thought much at all of the Statute of Secrecy. Some silly little bureaucracy that made scared pure-bloods feel better at night, and nothing more. This wasn’t the 1600s. They weren’t all going to be burned at the stake.
“I need you with me,” he admitted.

; Harry’s pulled Proulx’s file (benefits of being the secretary of a really disorganised office and having very little regard for other people’s privacy (since they have very little regard for his own)) and Proulx specialises in potions. He has no training whatsoever in safely handling or disposing of explosion magic.
good.”
Near six, after several fortifying rounds of tea, and after Malfoy had rushed out to check on Scorpius and returned, the other professors cleared out of Gin and Luna’s rooms.
“What? Hide your head in a cauldron?” Draco asked.
When Draco reached him, all bets were off, and Blaise looped an arm underneath him and helped him the final way to the shore.
“Of course I believed you, idiot. I saw the internet stories just like you did.”
, my office.”
“Oh—!” said Harry. He smiled. “Morning.”
Harry reached across, took his hand in his own. They shook once, but Harry didn’t let go for far too long.
Given the fact that they were already in public together, Harry reckoned the odds weren’t as bad as all that. In fact—
Hermione hmm’d knowingly. “See how they huddle,” she murmured softly. Draco and Pansy looked sharply at her, but Harry wanted to hug her. He had people to huddle with through this disaster; Hermione was tough, but he would bet even she wanted to huddle, too, right now. The worst part of it was that he couldn’t even offer it to her. She wouldn’t take it out here in front of Draco.
He reached out, laid his hand over Malfoy’s arm before he even realised what he was doing. Malfoy’s eyes snapped open, mercurial and fierce and so very close. “What—”
“Dissolution,” said Snape, quietly.
“Thank you. You shouldn’t have left your trunk open.”
missing.
Undaunted, Hermione continued, “So, Harry tells me you’re playing hard to get.”
sorry. He was sorry Draco had known what it was like to feel free for a while, and some bigoted Auror ruined it for him.
He fucking loved Draco, and he
Harry wasn’t impressed. And told the boy so in no uncertain words—words like ‘When your mums find out.’ Albus went white as a sheet, begging and sniffling.
“Cool, yeah I think I read about you in the paper a few years back. I dunno. I was like twenty then. Wasn’t really interested in world news at the time, you know?”
As if he’d ever want to watch this disaster. And yet. Harry flicked his wand at the magicbox and it turned on. BWBC Four came on, declaring a marathon showing of all the Stag Shag episodes, and Harry strongly suspected Ron of having set it to this channel while he was at work yesterday. At work without his partner, who was still enjoying paternity leave, five months postnatal. The Ministry had an excellent benefits programme, if nothing else.
Snape paused, interested despite himself. Hesitantly, he returned to the front of the painting, peering down into the cauldron below. “At a slow, red fire, Calcination will occur,” he observed. “You are within degrees of it.”
them. Right then, Harry knew that he’d been meant to come here, to see this and experience this.
“The fuck is the shibboleth?” asked Harry.
we’re going to lose our magic.”
. He pulled on his hair in frustration. They really needed to know what else was in that Poison, but it could take
She gestured to all the flowers growing in windowsills, and the unnatural winter garden out front of her house. “I think it was wearing off for awhile now, but something snapped the last of it off. And—I just want you to know I’m grateful for whatever your people did to give me back this connection to my sister. And for taking Dudley in, letting him be part of your world even though he’s…he’s not magic. And—and I’m sorry, for how I treated you. It’s no excuse, but…I’m sorry. You are welcome here anytime.”
“Hello, Harry,” she said. “Are you going to the Burrow for Christmas this year? The Weasleys invited my dad and me. We’re very excited to try Christmas goose; it’s such an unusual culinary choice for a holiday, don’t you think? We always have spaghetti. It’s much more festive.”
“Of course I’m…” He trails off when he sees Harry’s expression and then his eyes narrow. “Nana’s visiting Mother in Italy this week. Why would you think I wasn’t alone?”
He took a moment to wonder who the fuck had their son before he remembered he would be sleeping with Albus Potter and the Demiguise-dog. Ginny was not in the room, though Luna was. At least someone was with the boys.
There was no doubt about it now; he couldn’t pretend he’d imagined it. This was a
Harry didn’t need to be a Slytherin to understand the unsaid words there:
Malfoy grinned. “Right in one. The best lesson for a Potions Master is knowing what he’s brewed or what he’s looking at. Never drink from a lead cup, never let a servant wearing a tungsten ring serve your food.”
Malfoy smirked. “I do all right.”
Despite her calm exterior, Hermione was the only one here besides Harry and Dudley who’d been raised Muggle. She knew exactly what Dudley’s picture meant, and she’d whispered to Harry, when he poured her tea, if he could add a drop of something stronger to it. Dudley had just glared at Harry until he doctored his cup, too.
“Right there,” Draco demands, and then, “Yes, god, yes fuck me just like that you annoying son of a bitch.”
to know everything about everyone. He’d just learned very well from Lucius.
Harry will absolutely not be salting anything tonight.
The next morning, Harry wakes up to the sound of Malfoy berating the housekeeping elf for not bringing hot enough towels and the vague realization that Malfoy is a cuddler. He pulls himself up on one elbow, blinking blearily at the scene before him. The housekeeping elf has one hand on her hip and both eyes narrowed.
“Hopefully they’d get over the whole ‘killed Voldemort’ thing after a few days,” Harry said, and Draco had to remind himself that he couldn’t appear overly fond of Harry. Why was he so damnably charming when he was being dense?
Draco woke slowly, sleep clinging to his mind. He was cozy and comfortable, though it felt as though the night must have killed the fire in the grate, and the room beyond was colder than he would have liked. Through his eyelids, he could see sunlight, and he turned his face away from it, into the pillows, determined to remain in his lovely daze. The bedclothes were all scented with the sweet smoke of incense, and he was curled against a warm body. His cock was hard, as it so often was upon first waking, and with a lazy tilt of his hips, he pressed it forward, granting himself a little bit of friction and pressure. A low heat of arousal simmered under his skin, but Draco wasn’t really ready to wake up yet. A small voice in the back of his head told him that he didn’t really want to regain his wits, and he believed it. Better not to wake to harsh reality. He was drifting through a dream; basking in sensual pleasure.
Harry, eyes still closed, cut him off. “It’s fine with me if you want to stay. I don’t like sleeping in an empty room anyway.”
“I like winding you up,” Draco said, smoothing back his silver hair, freshly clean under his fingers for the first time in a week.
“Not bad, Malfoy,” Harry said as Draco lowered his wand, and tucked it back into the loop on his hip, “That’s loads of progress from just this morning. I bet you could do it even in a pinch, now. And you can work on finding a stronger memory, so it’ll do a better job... Wonder what your Patronus will be.”
The grey was retreating from his vision as Draco got to his feet. There was no sound through the shared wall. Was that a good sign, or a bad one? Trembling and breathing hard, Draco seated himself on the edge of the bed, facing the open door. The mote of golden light that Harry had created still hung there. Draco waited. What would he do if Potter didn’t return? If he was lucky enough to make it to the main fireplace alive without his wand, and get to the Ministry Atrium to get help, there would surely be a Ministry investigation. What would the punishment be? Lifetime imprisonment? A Dementor’s kiss? Even as Draco entertained dreary possibilities, Harry reappeared in the doorway, wand lowered, and his summoned light faded. Glad as he was that Potter was still alive, Draco took one look at Harry’s face, and with a sinking feeling, knew what he would say before he opened his mouth.
“No, that’s quite alright, Mimsy, thank you,” Draco said, scrubbing a hand over his brow and eyes, recomposing himself. The elf didn’t look pleased with that response, but she bobbed a quick curtsey nonetheless, and exited back out into the hall. When Draco looked back at Harry, he was buttoning up his shirt. “It’s been difficult. But time goes on,” Draco said at last.

, even if I was stupid enough to try one. I need to pull it out, and I need to take this glove off to grab hold of it. So, untwist your fucking knickers and get the fuck out of the way, because I’m going to do it.”
Harry rolled away. He’d probably just now realised what they’d done, and then he’d run, and they’d never talk of it again, despite how Harry’s life would never be the same again.
“I understand art teachers are meant to be free spirits,” she said, shrugging. “At least, that’s what Luna always tells me, so I’ve decided to embrace it.”
Seeing his son—their son—the only surviving one, sitting right there, just feet from him, with no awareness whatsoever that there was anything in the world to fear, made Harry’s heart skip a beat. Ginny ran her hand over Al’s dark, curly hair and he grinned up at her with the same handsome, toothy smile Ron had had when they were kids.
– something they’d got a lot of in recent months.
“Thank you for seeing us, Your Majesty,” Penelope began, once they’d all sat. “We apologise for coming without an invitation. Our messenger owls had trouble with navigation.”
“‘Fraid not. We’ve been going back and forth on first and second place all season.”
“Quaint, isn’t it?” said Malfoy.
“Did too, I bet,” Ron said.
with him—though not particularly well. Harry grins, rolls out of the way as another severing spell flies at his hand (he really doesn’t want to have to get it reattached again—Draco is right, the nerves are never as good the second (or fourth) time around). He hears Demelza calling for backup into her Patronus, but it’s soon drowned out by the heavy roar of battle around them.
The Queen gave her a confused smile. “We are not. Atlantis is solid land.”
Malfoy’s smile, if possible, grew even wider. He slung an arm over Harry’s shoulder and settled in to watch the sixth year girls perform a very salacious group dance. Delta Ashwood had moves that made Harry, briefly, second-guess his Seeker-sexual lifestyle. “My dear Potter,” he said, sighing happily. “It is what I live for.”
“Is it bad?” Potter immediately asked. “Have you had problems with Muggles since the presser?”
“No,” Malfoy said sourly. “Potter picked an almost identical team to the one you would’ve taken. With all the player competition, you would have diluted teams, and I’d easily be in the lead.”
were getting fucked and moaning like Miss Muggle? A memory of Malfoy healing his broken nose flashes in his mind and a rush of heat lights him up from the inside.
Ginny gave him one of her oversized Harpies tees to wear once he was done and he slipped it on gratefully, having not even realised how cold he was until he wasn’t anymore. Ms Danger trotted out fully visible then, her eyes back to brown and her fur red and white and wavy. Fleur, who’d never seen her visible, and Hannah and Pansy who’d never seen her at all, cooed appropriately over her beautiful features and her brave rescue.
“You’re wanking,” says Harry, and he does have the presence of mind to glare up at Malfoy now, but it’s ruined when their eyes meet because Malfoy’s gaze is pure fuck-me. Pupils blown so wide the grey is missing entirely, mouth parted, lips slick with spit.
“Potter,” said Draco, and Harry immediately looked up, pocketing his mobile again.
But this is amazing.
, but if he looked in the mirror now, there would be two people looking back: just them, like a regular mirror. Both his greatest fear and his heart's desire were the same as they were then—but changed.
“You probably wanted to be in Ravenclaw all along,” Ron muttered, and Hermione’s lips pinched in annoyance.
Draco glanced away, very briefly. When he looked back, his expression was neutral again. “As long as Millicent shows, it’ll be fine.”
- "Pull it out, Pottah" - he said in a voice hoarse with excitement - "I'm afraid you have to be given orders because you are doing nothing".
- ''Are you taking it in your mouth or should I look for another volunteer?''
Immobilized Snape did not register it and obeyed the godson's will. When they got there, Draco saw Potter leaning against the pillar. His brain registered an image of Griffindor's shapely hips. This view should be banned. Malfoy looked away from the captivating sight, as he felt his prick begin its activity. Ohhh how he would like to put his paws on them and open those legs properly. Then Draco spoke:
- "Harderr, deeper..." - Muttered with half-lidded eyes. - "I want everything more.."  -He groaned in his throat as a wave of pleasure passed through his body in another thrust. He was determined and without being over-controlled.
Potter was so exhausted that he did not register his "enemy" brutally devouring his mouth and biting his lips to blood. He started returning the kiss to suddenly feel that he was turned upstairs.
. - Potter thought and his eyes covered with lust. He took a piece of magic rag out of his pocket and ran towards the door before it began to close. As he got into, the door slammed.
- ''Heard nothing'' - The green-eyed boy no longer controlled his whimper.
He was close now, so close that he felt unimaginable pain. He grabbed his cock to make it easier to come but then he felt a firm grip on his hands and heard the growl against his ear.
And that was it. Potter became Malfoy's boyfriend. Some of the inhabitants of the Slytherin house did not dare to comment on Draco's "hallucinations", for curses and charms reached anyone who dared.
Draco could smell the faint scent of treacle tart and chocolate frog. The smell gave him strength and his excitement overwhelmed him again. He pulled the Golden Boy's hair towards his mouth.
- "Now I'll take care of you, Potty " - Grey-eyed stroke Scarhead's hair tenderly.
A growl against his ear brought him to the ground:
- "Uncle, please tell me that you saw Saint Potter in the Great Hall today?" he replied.  Snape hadn't expected such a question.
-" Cut these strips into roots, about 2 cm wide" - Green-eyed snorted
-" Why? "- asked Scarhead uncertainly, afraid of the answer that never came. In one moment, Harry was pressed against the wall, their lips colliding in a greedy kiss. The eyeglass groaned against Draco's lips, feeling a flock of butterflies in his stomach and the tingling sensation wandering through his body. The blonde grabbed his robe and instead of gently taking it off, he jerked it so that it almost ripped it in half.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment and kept the monstrosity in front of his eyes. Long with many veins flowing along the shaft, it was as white as flour. With its sight, he pleaded to be taken deep in his mouth. Harry remembered when he touched the Slytherin's skin, he felt an immense cold. For a moment it crossed his mind whether his cock was also cold. Just like ice cream. Brunet had a sudden urge for ice cream with whipped cream. Malfoy's prick was about nine inches. Harry was haunted by thoughts of what would happen if this huge tool disappeared in his ass. Unknowingly, Griffindor licked his lips and put his hands under his pants and touched his bulge.
Potter was shocked. He didn't know what to do. He felt really great and, to his surprise, kissed him back. Pure-blood pushed his tongue into Harry's mouth and examined its structure. He was slowly sliding off his robe. Harry opened his eyes and realized that he was staring at the huge bulge in the blond's pants. Blood pulsed through his veins and felt a strange heat throughout his body.
- "Pottaahh!" - Draco tugged harder at his hair, fingers gripping the shoulders, and after a while warm liquid spilled inside the Green-eyed. The blonde fell over him, their breaths mingling. Nest-haired felt a nose run down his neck, and a smile formed on his face.
- ''Swallow it Potter!'' - Potter obeyed. Malfoy looked into the brunets' eyes and saw pure excitement there. Harry felt everything going crazy inside him. He was ruled by many emotions. He wanted to feel the Slytherin deep within him.
- " 2 centimeters ? What a difference!" - he muttered under his breath as he cut them quite unevenly
-"You're repeating yourself, Malfoy!" - The aristocrat's attention now caught the neck. He wanted to suck on it and make a few hickeys, but he held back and said in his mind:  "And that is your future last name, Pottah". Malfoy seized the opportunity to put his hand on Griffindor's and began to mix in the right direction. He came closer to him and grabbed his left cheek. His nine-inch bulge in his pants was taking its toll on him. He moved closer to the arsehole and began rubbing against its entrance.
- "But I need it" - He stuttered, but his hand was gone from his prick. He's not stupid enough to derive Malfoy now. If anyone saw him now, they would think he had rabies or he was turning into a werewolf.
-" So you ...." - he was cut off by greasy-haired
Yes, Harry Potter into blokes. Who would have thought?
Draco decided that the theory of the infectious disease transmitted by Scarhead was correct and decided to bring in someone who had no contact with the green-eyed. Malfoy walked into the abandoned alcove, where there was a disused fireplace connected to Floo's network.
- "Shut it! If you don't shag him before Christmas, don't even dare to go home" - The man went to Severus' office and asked to use the fireplace.
- "Pull it out, Pottah" -  a heavy voice reached the ears of the nest-haired man, which does not accept any objections. Tense muscles and a heart pounding like a drum.
-"I heard what you growl! I just don't know what to pull out"
- "My FATHER WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS!" - The Potions Master stopped and looked at him. He rested his face on his hand and shook it in disbelief.
- "Good Morning Draco, what brings you to me?" the Potions Master said in his monotonous voice
- "Have you noticed any changes in the Chosen One today?" - Theodore only saw Harry talking to Hermione and Ron. In response, he looked at Malfoy as if he were insane and went back to reading his Potions book.
Soon after, Scarhead came screaming and soiled the entire floor.
Draco tasted good. Kissing such soft and confident lips made him dizzy. He could feel immense heat and butterflies in his stomach.
-'' It is not polite to hang around in the corridors at night, Potter., as befits a Griffindor.'' - Harry recognized the voice immediately. For so many years, this mockery had been taunting him, expressing scorn of his existence.
- "Malfoy, stop ..." Harry muttered as he felt the Slytherin's cold lips make wet kisses against his neck. He did not have the strength to push off the attacker. His legs gave out on him, and he could swear it was the best feeling he had experienced since he was born. Eager Draco flung weakened Potter onto the nearest desk and climbed on the top of him. For the next seconds, Harry's shirt was torn apart by skilful hands, so that a certain nobleman was able to make out a slightly muscled stomach from Quidditch practices. Keeping in touch with reality became mock as chalk-white teeth were digging into his collarbone leaving red marks and emotion beyond words. His hands tightened around the edge of the desktop, and skin burned with live fire, along with dried throat.
“You are the most beautiful boy I’ve ever seen,” he says. Harry smiles at him and takes another grape. He takes another sip of the wine. It tastes a little funny and Harry knows he’s getting tipsy, but he doesn’t care. The stars are out and Draco looks at him like he’s an angel or something. They kiss and slowly their clothes get removed from their bodies. Draco’s pale limbs intertwine with Harry’s darker skin and Harry forgets all about the stars and the wine. Draco’s fingers open him up slowly and then the moment is there. For the first time in his life, Harry becomes one with another person and he can’t believe how perfect it all feels.
The next day we had our Care of Magical Creatures exam. Hagrid didn’t seem like himself but we all had to focus on our exam so we didn’t really have a chance to speak to him. Potions was that afternoon. And even though Draco helped me study I just couldn’t get my Confusing Concoction to thicken. It was kind of frustrating to see Professor Snape’s disappointed look when he came to check my potion. Draco asked me afterwards what whet wrong, but I didn’t know. I thought I did everything as we had practised in class.
Neville and Hermione laugh. It’s no secret that if it’s up to Ron, breakfast will never be finished. It will just extend to lunch, and then into dinner until he falls asleep to wake up at the breakfast table.
Fuck, Harry hadn’t thought about that. "I'm sorry. I didn't mean to ruin Christmas, " Harry says.
“We have food. I need to go now. See you tomorrow.” Harry finishes the call, and the kitchen goes silent. Draco lifts his head to look at the fireplace. Harry sits in front of it; his cheeks are wet from the tears. His hands pull at his hair, making it a bigger mess than usual.
“Maybe you can watch some with grandma Andromeda,” Harry says. “You’ll be going home with her after Christmas dinner.”
“Don’t cry, sweetheart,” she says.
“Yeah,” Harry confirms as he stops in front of Draco. “I thought it was appropriate, as I’m about to kiss you.”
I have to go now and get ready for another Quidditch practice.
“Not guilty,” he says again.
Draco places a kiss on Hermione’s forehead and then one on Rose’s. “I’ll see you both soon,” he says. Then he takes Harry’s hand, and together they walk out of the room.
Everyone was very excited to learn more about this Chamber, but professor Binns said it was all nonsense. That the school had been searched and that no such chamber excited. I didn’t really listen to all the questions the other students threw at professor Binns. I was more worried about Draco’s pale face. He had been looking out the window since the chamber had been brought up. The whole subject made him feel uncomfortable and that worries me. What if he knows something about all this? What if he’s the one who wrote that message on the wall and petrified Mrs Norris? Would Draco really be capable of doing that?
The next thing I remember is holding the Sorting Hat, while the Basilisk was coming after me. I pulled the hat on my head and just thought ‘help me’. There was no voice but the hat contracted and something very hard and heavy thudded onto my head. It almost knocked me out. It was a gleaming silver sword and I took it out and used it when the Basilisk lunged for me. The hilt drove into the roof of the Basilisks mouth, making it keeled over sideways, twitching to the floor. I slid down the wall, my arm hurt so badly and when I looked I could see one of the poisonous fangs of the Basilisk sticking out of it. I crawled toward Draco. I was going to die, I knew it. A white-hot pain was spreading slowly from the wound and my vision started to become foggy. It was a lot like when I had slit my wrist and the world had started spinning while the blood pulsed out of my arm.
Hermione and Neville fall in line with Harry before he exits the Great Hall and turns towards the stairs that will lead him to the History of Magic classroom.
“Nothing,” Harry says. “Just need some help.”
“He must be,” Neville says. “It’s why the Aurors can’t find him.”
“The stairs?” Harry asks the room. A young girl points to the left and Harry moves quickly. He only stops when he’s in front of the second door on the left. Is he really doing this? Malfoy is still a git, one that has done horrible things to Harry’s friends. Ron won’t understand, for him, Malfoy will always be that boy that called his girl a Mudblood. But Harry has seen his pain during sixth year, his strength during the war to do what right with a risk to his own life, the dedication to being a better person since the start of this school year. And Harry wants him, more than anything. It’s stupid and crazy, but it’s the trued. So Harry opens the door and steps inside, ready to accept the love offered to him.
The Dark Lord takes a bite of his steak. He chews slowly. The entire table is silent. Only Bellatrix dares to eat, unaffected by the threatening mood in the room. Draco looks down at the plate in front of him. His steak untouched, the potatoes cooling by the second. Draco doesn’t think he can eat. He knows who the wolf is. The best DADA professor Hogwarts had seen in his time. Not that Draco will ever admit this out loud. Not anymore, anyway. He’s told Harry once. Harry had smiled at Draco then, a huge grin on his face. At that moment it didn’t matter anymore that Draco was forced to hate the man. It matters again now. Just as he’s now forced to wear a mark he never wanted. To again be the man his family wants him to be.
Harry turns out of his mother’s arms and hugs Sirius. Sirius pets his head and Harry is glad he’s got so many people looking out for him and Draco. It won’t do any good. Draco’s parents won’t let Draco visit them this summer. Harry is sure of that. But it’s sweet that his uncle wants to try.
The Dark Lord pushes against Draco’s shield. His eyes glitter in anticipation. Draco concentrates on the fake memory he made up for this. He forces it to the foreground and then opens his mind a little. The Dark Lord enters and watches with glee as Draco shows him the chase for the snitch in the storming rain, his intent to ram into Potter and then watch Harry fall to the ground. It’s short but effective. The Dark Lord pulls out and seems to be pleased.
Dear mom and dad,
Neville lets his head drop back down and sighs. “Fuck,” he says. “Harry, tell me what happened.”
I have to go now, Draco is here and he is going to quiz me on Potions, to make sure I don’t mess up our practical exam on Monday.
Malfoy watches them and shakes his head with a grin on his face. Somehow Harry knows that Malfoy thinks he and Neville are two idiots. He laughs and then relaxes in his seat.
Harry rolls up his parchment and picks up all his belongings. He gets up and walks back to his dorm. He dumps his books on his chest and lays down in his bed. It doesn’t take long before Neville comes in and lays down beside him.
“It hurts, it hurts so fucking much,” Draco stutters.
Mr Diggory continued to question Mr Crouch’s house-elf and I was surprised when Draco spoke up to say that it hadn’t been a house-elf voice that had conjured the mark, but the voice of a man. There was some more discussion going on and in the end, everyone agreed that the house-elf couldn’t have conjured the mark and we were all free to go and I’d gotten my wand back. Sirius apparated us back to Grimmauld Place and made us go back to bed. In bed, Draco explained to me that the Dark Mark was used whenever someone was killed by Death Eaters. His father had told him about it when he was younger. I told Draco I was worried, that not long ago I had woken up with my scar hurting and now his mark had shown in the sky. Draco nodded and kissed me and told me to try to get some sleep.
Off course we also had to get all the books for our standard subjects like Intermediate Transfiguration and The Standard Book of Spells Grade Three. When we got at the Tonks home after our shopping Draco spent the first hour going through the books, looking up things he finds interesting. He’s a nerd from time to time, he just doesn’t like it when I point that out.
Later, Blaise let us read over his notes about how Moody had gone on and on about constant vigilance and the Unforgivable Curses. I hadn’t heard anything after the little demonstration of the Avada Kedavra curse. Nobody had really liked the lesson. It wasn’t entertaining at all like the Ravenclaws had said it would be. It had been torture, for me, for Draco and for Neville. Hermione and Ron shielded him when we left the lesson, he still looked pale and upset. We were on our way towards them to ask if he was alright when Moody passed us and heard him speak to Neville in a lower and gentler growl than we’ve heard of him before and told Neville to come up to his office for a cup of tea. And then he turned towards me and asked me if I was alright. I spit at him that I was and turned to leave. Like I would want to have tea with him while he does nothing but talk about Draco like he’s the Dark Lord himself. I really hate that man and wished he never had become our DADA teacher. He’s ruining my favourite subject.
Harry James Potter.
He won’t talk to me. I don’t know why, but he won’t talk to me. As if things aren’t already bad enough without him being a complete bastard. It would have been nice if he would be on my side right now, but I’m sure that’s not happening any time soon.
Well, I think that’s all for now, I’ll write to you again soon. Draco just finished his shower and I have to go braid his hair so we can go get some breakfast.
“I’m going to see if Molly made her famous lemonade,” Draco says.
James takes one of Harry’s hands. “You can tell me anything, you know that, right,” he says.
Harry looks at the steps of the main entrance of Hogwarts. The Christmas holiday had sped by in no time. And the long train ride back to Hogsmeade had never gone this fast. Harry drags towards the stairs in front of him. He doesn’t want to go back inside and have to say goodbye to Draco. His fingers are cold and he has a sour taste in his mouth.
I went to find Draco to tell him about Myrtle, but I couldn’t find him anywhere. He wasn’t in the dormitory or the common room. I asked around, but no-one had seen him in a while. Terence said not to worry, that Draco was probably just in the bathroom or something. But it just didn’t feel right. I went to bed and waited for a while for Draco to join me, but he never came. So I got up again to look for him. The common room was empty by now, just like all the bathrooms. Draco wasn’t in the dungeon. I was really worried so I decided to go to Professor Snape and tell him Draco was missing.
In the meantime, Pettigrew talks to Neville. He says that betraying Neville’s parents was an easy choice. That they were of no concern to him.
Draco shakes his head. “He doesn’t like me. Can’t hear, can’t talk, can’t get good grades, can’t even fall for a nice pure-blood girl.”
“They became Animagi before they graduated Hogwarts?” Ron asks.
Harry sits down on the top of the stairs. He was a fool, thinking that some company would cheer Draco up. He should have taken him home when it was clear Draco wasn’t feeling well. Why did he stay and let Draco suffer? Just because he wanted to spend new years with his friends. Isn’t Draco supposed to come first? It’s just a stupid clock ticking down to midnight, just like it does every night. They could have just ignored it. So why did Harry insisted that they go to the stupid party? It clearly wasn’t helping Draco get any better.
Ron has the decency to turn red. “Oh, nothing, Hermione and I just got a little carried away.”
“I hate you,” Hermione says, but the smile on her face gives away her true feelings.
The hour was over before we knew it and I was a bit disappointed I hadn’t spotted Draco again. But that all changed when we reached Flourish and Blotts. First Hermione went mental when she discovered that Gilderoy Lockhart was going to be there for a signing. Just like Mrs Weasley. We met up with her, the rest of the Weasley family and Hermione’s parents inside the shop. They were already in line to get his autograph.
“Sure,” James jokes. Harry must be red in the face, he can feel his cheeks heat up.
They both don’t say anything else. Harry is glad Hermione doesn’t push the subject. It’s clear that she suspects. And Harry can’t blame her. Neville also thinks it’s not just because Malfoy is deaf that Harry can’t leave him alone. And maybe it’s crazy to keep it a secret. Only Harry doesn’t want anyone to know yet. People will look at him differently. What if they won’t like him anymore? Or what if Wood kicks him off the Quidditch team? Harry can’t risk that. And it’s not as if there are a lot of gay students walking around Hogwarts, are they? It’s not common. And still frowned upon by many.
Draco and I had a fight. About a week ago, a notice went up to announce the first Hogsmeade weekend for this coming Halloween. Draco wants to stay in the castle with me, and I told him not to be stupid and go with our friends and enjoy the day away. He thinks it won’t be any fun without me. And to be honest, I would like him to stay behind with me. I hate Halloween. I’m sure you understand why. But I don’t want to take away this experience from Draco. He deserves to have fun with Blaise, Greg, Daphne and Hermione. We didn’t agree on anything, just yelled at each other and then both sat on different sides of the common room until it was time for bed. For a little while, I was afraid Draco won’t come to sleep in my bed, but after a couple of minutes, he came anyway. He said he was sorry and that he loves me. I told him I was sorry too.
Dear mom and dad,
“Yeah, you got a point. A little bug then? You want me to get you anything from the pharmacy?” Harry starts to pet Draco’s hair and he closes his eyes for a second.
“I know you’re upset still about Draco,” Neville says when they walk beside the water. “And that it’s hard for you to study without him, but Hermione’s right.”
It’s cold here now, with all the snow we’ve been having. The lake is frozen solid. The dormitory, classrooms, library and the great hall all have roaring fires, warming the rooms, but the corridors have become icy. Only professor Snape refuses to light a fire in his classroom, he says it will interfere with the potion making. So it’s freezing cold during potions lessons. Our breath rises in mist before us during that class.
Sunday 24 October 1993
Or maybe staying awake is better.
“I want to find Pettigrew,” Neville says. Harry had already forgotten about him again. That’s another thing that Draco does. He makes Harry forget about everything else in the world. He takes up most of Harry’s thoughts. And almost all his dreams. Good dreams. In which Harry kisses Draco and Draco doesn’t mind. They would hold hands and sit next to each other all the time. Draco’s smile is in them too. Harry loves that smile.
The next day Nott followed me around the castle and I was afraid to go to Myrtle’s bathroom to talk to her. She was the only one left in the castle I could talk to. Isn’t that pathetic, Hermione is away for the holidays and I’m left with only a ghost of a dead moaning girl to hang out with. Nott tried to hex me all day and I used the Expelliarmus charm on him a couple of time with success, stopping him from tripping me with his leg-bind jinxes.
Professor Snape has been in a foul mood, we think it’s because of Neville his Bogart taking Snape’s shape and then getting dressed in Neville’s grandmother's clothes. The story has been circling the castle all month. And whenever anyone in his vicinity says Professor Lupin’s name Snape his eyes flash menacingly at them. I feel sorry for the Gryffindors in his class. Professor Snape is ducking them points all the time. I’m glad I have Draco helping me with my potions and all, otherwise, I’m sure he would be yelling at me all the time too. Neville is really having a hard time.
“Stop pacing,” Draco snaps at Harry. Harry stops in his tracks and looks at Draco like he’s an idiot. And maybe he is. He’s known for years now that Harry can’t sit still when he’s nervous. Draco just wishes Harry would sit down and hold Draco’s hand in his. Maybe then this day will become more cheerful, as it’s supposed to be.
I found Draco lying on the floor, between the feet of a high statue of a wizard with a face that was ancient and monkeyish. It had a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard’s sweeping stone robes. I sprinted towards Draco, begging him not to be dead. I flung my wand aside, grabbed Draco’s shoulders and turned him over. His face was white as marble and he felt cold to the tough. His eyes were closed and I was afraid I was too late. I hugged Draco against my chest and begged Draco to wake up.
“Oh, are they here for bad news. That is great. Just what that criminal deserves,” the Auror says.
“Have a good year,” James shouts after him. “We’ll miss you, even though you can’t wait to get away from us.”
“Why are you drinking lemonade, Draco?” Pansy asks.
Sorry, it’s been a while since I wrote to you. Malfoy keeps staring at me while I’m in our dormitory, making it hard to take out my notebook and write to you. I don’t want them to know about this. I’m afraid they will read it or steal it and burn it, or something. But I have to tell you about the troll that was in the school around Halloween, so I’m hoping they will stay away for a little longer.
“Hermione is wrong. Flying is awesome,” Draco signs.
Love you,
Harry looks at the piece of fabric that has fallen from the envelope. It’s just a piece of fabric. Harry looks into the envelope again. There is nothing else in there. No explanation or even a note of who it’s from.
Monday 8 November 1993
Dear mom and dad,
That morning we had Herbology and Care of Magical Creatures. During Herbology I could see that Draco was still upset that his mother hadn’t written to him, so in between our classes, I pulled Draco behind one of the greenhouses and kissed him senseless. It helped put a smile back on his face and I had been wanting to do that ever since we got back at school. I’ve missed Draco during summer break, more than I can admit. Sometimes it feels like I’m incomplete when he’s not around. Is it supposed to feel this intense when you are in love? I don’t think Blaise and Luna are this obsessed with being together all the time as Draco and I. And Hermione wasn’t like this when she was with Ron. Sometimes I’m scared that Draco and I are to close, but then he smiles at me and everything feels right and I can’t help but smile back.
That Saturday was a Hogsmeade day, and Draco and I joined our friends on the walk there. It was really funny when we passed the Durmstrang ship. Victor Krum appeared on the deck, dressed in nothing but swimming trunks. We all stopped and watched as he dived into the lake. Greg mentioned that Krum most be mad for jumping into freezing water. And Draco responded with ‘but also good looking mad’.  We all laughed at Greg who just shook his head complaining he should find straight friends, that everyone was betraying him. After which Hermione and Daphne pointed out that they were straight. Greg corrected them and told them he needed straight male friends. That the gays and bi’s are taking the overhand. Blaise said he shouldn’t be worried, that he would still drool over girls with him. And Luna agreed she would too.
“Harry, don’t go reading it now, I need breakfast,” Teddy says. He’s playing with his new Duplo, building a castle and rescuing the dragon from the evil princess by the sounds of it.
Harry can’t blame Neville for saying that. Harry has been worried about Iris’ safety all year. Who wouldn’t be with a criminal on the loose that is after their family? “But Iris is in real danger,” Harry says. “I wouldn’t mind her dating one of my friends. Not that any of them fancy her. But if they did, I’d be fine with that. I just don’t want her to get killed by the rat,” Harry says.
“Yes, I’m afraid so,” Burke answers. “That is one of the reasons I feel that it’s better to keep trying to conceive naturally. We don’t want to put you in danger of falling back into that habit if it’s not necessary.”
Harry shakes his head. “You can’t hold us both,” he shouts back.
There are no lights on in the house. Harry closes his eyes for a second before he opens the back door. He steps into the kitchen and turns on the lights. His dirty coffee cup from that morning still stands in the sink, accompanied by his plate. There are no other dishes or any sign that someone else lives in this house.
We tried to tell her that she was taking on too much with all the classes she’s taking, but she wouldn’t listen to us. She just said she made a mistake and that she had to go to see professor Flitwick to say sorry. And with she just left. Draco shook his head and took Hermione’s Arithmancy book that she had forgotten and we went to grab some lunch.
- "Stop calling me Potter!"
Unfortunately, Malfoy anticipated this and pulled him towards him.
After the march, he found himself in an unknown corridor. He looked at his watch and realized that it was past the curfew.
It was a cool October morning at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Outside the window a gusty wind was raging and raindrops ran down the windows. A green-eyed Griffindor was heading towards the Great Hall for breakfast. Little did he know what was going to happen that day. When he stood at the threshold of the opened door, he ran to the table of his house to his friends.
The nest-haired brunet ran his thumb over the tip. He could feel the veins throbbing and he shifted his position in his lap and raised his other hand. The thought of having a heavy penis on his lips deprived him of his ability to think straight. He felt ashamed,because After all, he knew nothing about these things. Just what he read from Dumbledore's newspapers, which were always hidden under the Pensieve. There was nothing there to say that the partner was of such an unhealthy size. After all, it's probably not possible for him to fit in his mouth. What came over him to get in here?
- "Yield to me." - grunts escaped from the mouth of the grey-haired boy. The Chosen One, not having the strength to speak, only nodded and devoted himself to blissful tenderness. The taller considered it as consent and kept at pleasuring his crotch.  And it was not long, the last items of the golden boy's wardrobe hit the ground, along with the boxers. Draco unbuckled his belt and took down his trousers just to hurl them away. Potters' half-open eyes glanced directly at Malfoy's white underwear with a perceptible outline. His sight came to Slytherin's attention and turned him more on. Grey-eyed leaned down to kiss the boy of his dreams. The Griffindor kissed back and began brushing their tongues together. This french kiss was far-fetched, not like the one with Cho. Suddenly blissful sense was replaced with a hoarse voice:
- "You don't even know how much I love you, Potter ". - Harry only squinted his eyes and felt heavy body collapsed on himself.
Pale-skinned, he dreamed of approaching Scarhead, touching him, caressing, licking and biting his skin, causing the boy to shudder with excitement, which he would of course use, sticking his penis between the chosen one's cheeks and causing loud moans from Potter's mouth.
When he finished his preparations, he looked to the side and saw the nakedness of the chosen one. He couldn't take his eyes off the perfect figure and the olive skin he would like to be pressed against the floor. His eyes drifted down to the lips Malfoy wanted to kiss. He turned and only now did he find Severus staring at him intensely with distaste and concern in his eyes. When the tall blond man looked at the teacher, Snape turned and began writing ingredients on the blackboard.
- "You're welcome" - Blond froze.
At that time, Harry Potter was attending detention with loathsome Professor Umbridge. His hand had been writing lines with a ''special quill'', along with constant shooting pain, spreading across his blood flow. The chosen one undergoing torture dropped the instrument down and tugged his burning limb. Suddenly out of nowhere, his ear felt some air moving against his ear lobe. Trickles of sweat pricked the back of her neck, and Harry made out the hated voice with fake concern:
- "For this I urge the professor to look at what Longbottom is doing, which will most likely lead to the castle exploding, which no one would have survived." - The Potions Master did not want to argue, as he stated that his arrogance was caused by hallucinations and he was unable to determine with what dignity he was dealing with.
The green-eyed world has just stopped. He understood what had happened and felt a burning sensation in the back of his body, but despite the pain he wanted more.
- "You're mine, Potter" - a loud snarl escaped Malfoy's lips - "Repeat it" - Another swing and a slight cut to the skin on the cheek. Potter groaned in pain, but still moaned:
With a quick movement, Malfoy grabbed the Golden Boy's wrist and pulled him into a nearby alcove. The blond cast a few spells to silence and close the room.
And below it, a half-page photo of naked Potter lying on his back on a desk with a blond who was driving him insane.
- "We don't have time to talk. It's more than life's at stake" - Lucius wondered if maybe Draco should rest. The Slytherin Prince pronounced the destination and he and his father found themselves in an abandoned alcove.
- '' Calm down, I have something better for you. You'll be begging me for more,no matter how strong the pain is. Innocent Potty .. " - Suddenly he felt something huge and hard slide into his inner, which resists. He felt a hard erection brutally breaking through all the barriers and it comes to the end. Harry cried out in pain and wasn't ready for something like that.
Except the next day, the Daily Prophet issued a spectacular article. Daphne choked on the porridge after reading it. She immediately put it under the Slytherin Prince's nose.
- "What do you want, Malfoy?! Let go of me, it's after the curfew. I'm in a hurry. "- Potter's ability to think returned. He was afraid of what the blonde would do. They were alone in a dark room where it was easy to murder someone.
- "Don't exaggerate. It's only two thirds." - Grey-eyed carried on, exhausted of maintaining self-control. Draco started thrusting indolently, allowing to get used to the feeling full and making Harry poking on Draco's cock.
- "Can't you see Saint Potter is naked" - Long-haired man sighed
- "You don't even know how big!." - he laughed and blushed as he understood the meaning in his speech.  He decided to take the opportunity and stood behind the hot body of The boy who lived. He could feel the fire dancing where it touched the nest-haired Griffindor.
- "Yes. It's brilliant. Suck it out!" - Smirk appeared on ''dementor's" face.
- "Harder." - pleased Harry
"HOGWARTS THE SCHOOL OF WITCHCRAFT AND WIZARDRY OR THE ACADEMY OF NUDITY?" by Rita Skeeter
McGonagall, who passed by, had to wipe her glasses because she hadn't expected Lucius Malfoy to be so treated.
- "Do I seem naked to you, Draco?" - there was a loud laugh across the table of his house. The ferret started tearing its hair out and couldn't take her eyes off the tanned skin of the nest-haired boy.
The uncontrollable grunting from the Slytherin's mouth was heightened by Harry's already growing arousal. He realized he needed to try harder. He gripped his ass harder and finally the entire nine inches was down his esophagus. The pain piercing his mouth and larynx did not bother him. Only after a few moments was he able to move his head calmly. He suppressed all his retching reflexes and wouldn't even stop. He made faster and faster movements.
At the same time, a tall blond Slytherin boy was marching down the hall to the Great Hall. Everything would be fine if his attention had not been drawn to a certain point. A few yards away on the other side of the corridor stood a handsome naked boy with no scrap of clothing.
Immediately after that, the blonde began to undress. Harry's body twitched as did his dick when he saw the lean but muscular body of the pure-blood wizard. White skin in the light of the moon falling from the windows reflected on the milky complexion and evoked the feeling of meeting an angel.
Gryffindor fell to his knees and carefully took the blond's dick.  Moments later, the boy who lived's body was shaking with pleasure as a thick and hard penis disappeared into his mouth.
Severus tightened the shaft of his wand to use it at the ready. The tall Slytherin's expression showed arousal. Potter was intimidated, but he didn't want to screw up the potion and let his hand be directed. Cold pureblood fingers brushed the chosen one's neck. Then Harry felt "reptile's" lips nibble at his ear and bites his lobe.
Harry James Potter, the Golden Boy, the Chosen one, who is famous of his scar. Through the years Potter has been haunted by lots of girls wanting him to make out. For their misfortune Harry wasn't interested in them. He was in possession of invisibility cloak. What a gift, right? It's many applications. After all, what a straight guy would not use it to spy on chicks in the bathroom being hidden under some cassock. Well Harry didn't.
- "What do you mean, Draco?"
- "Bloody Hell" - performed by Ronald Weasley
- "Enough of this!" - his tone was unpleasant and could cut the ice.
Outside the door to the glass rooms, grey-eyed saw a mop of black hair. There he is!
- "No, he isn't! - The Slytherin Prince raised his voice and looked to his left.
- ''Pottah! Pottttah! Potttaaaah! Ahhh..'' - Scarhead froze. His body tingled.
Malfoy's hand stopped squeezing the cheeks and tightened around the boy's head. He pushed the chosen one down. Harry tried to slow his heart down, but knew this would be impossible with pure-blood.
- ''Take it Harryy,, oohh......'' - snarls from the blonde's ears reached Harry's ears with difficulty.
Since he knew that a very handsome Slytherin thought of him during such activities, he must like him.
- "Yes, I have seen that insufferable git that hurts my eyes with his presence"
Is anyone watching him? If so, he would bitterly regret it.
- "Draco, I understand that you are a teenager and at the time there is a hormone storm and you are obsessed with Mr. Potter. But I don't want to be heard about your sexual fantasies."
Four-eyes instantly felt a cold hand hit his buttock. At one point he saw stars in the sky. He hadn't expected such a move, but he liked it very much. He stuck out closer to Malfoy.
- "Nothing's okay. Potter is walking naked around the castle and only I can see it."
Tears welled up under his eyelids as Malfoy made his sharp movements deeper and deeper into him. His knees and jaw ached, but he didn't care. Harry groaned as he felt Draco's hands tighten in his hair and hold his head so he couldn't move it. He couldn't wait to see Malfoy's expression on his orgasm.
- "You have a boyfriend, Slytherin Prince" - he couldn't be angry with them. He just got what he wanted
- "Stop giving me orders!" - At this point, Snape felt harm to the golden boy. He did not know that anyone could harass an innocent young man like this.
Malfoy saw Chosen One tilt his mop of hair back. He took his fist on his hair and clenched his fist and pulled it towards him. He brought his head close to Potter's ear and bit his lobe.
-"Yes" - The pink stood went around the table and looked deeply into his eyes.
Harry felt uncomfortable and stepped on his foot. Malfoy squeaked and fell over. For the first time, Snape felt like giving Griffindor points.
The name coming out of the brunet's mouth was like honey on the ears. It had long been his dream that HIS Potter would not be able to walk after intercourse for another week. He wanted to drive him crazy. Then with all his strength he knocked the Griffindor on the right cheek.
The aristocrat grasped Scarhead's tongue with his teeth, which groaned in surprise, then sucked it hard with his lips.
- "I won't do it" - Harry's mind crossed with thought it's just a mishearing until he made out a husky voice:
Why is Potter walking around the castle without clothes and nobody sees it?!
- ''What do you want, Potter?'' - Without waiting for a reply, he quickly turned him over. He caressed Griffindor's buttocks, which slowly turned crimson. Malfoy knelt and a cold finger made circles around his entrance. Sweat ran down Scarhead's temples. Without warning, Malfoy stuck it in and was searching for the magic point by every millimeter. Once he found it, he pressed on it with all his might, making the Griffindor muffled, inarticulate sound. Harry had a lot of thoughts at the same time.
-'' Fuck off, Malfoy! Let me pass." - Griffindor exclaimed. His scream could attract Filch. That's why the blonde covered her mouth with his hand and pressed his victim more to the concrete.
The moans grew louder as the aristocrat struck a tender point with all his might, causing a wave of pleasure. Harry was already wrong with saying name of his enemy. Or maybe a lover? Potter excited the thought that he was doing it with his sworn enemy and humiliated himself in front of him.
Harry was almost breathless as he saw Malfoy's hand begin to unbuckle the belt, and with a swift, sweeping motion, the pants reached the ankles. Potter felt his saliva drip from his face, his cock slowly vibrated and the hole was about to itch.
- "Slytherin loses a hundred points for sick hallucinations and for assaulting and abducting a teacher to showcase his illusions." - Severus declared in a silky and dangerous tone and walked away from the godson waving his black robes. The surprised people were pretending not to see it, and Draco was shocked. Is Potter transmitting any blindness virus and everyone got infected except him? Finally, he shouted out into the entire corridor for Snape to hear in the distance:
- "That's right, damn it" - Another snarl and a hard slap on the back of the throat - "You're so good at it, Potty." - Visually impaired boy, desperately, sucked hard, not letting himself stop. He wanted more ... He began to lick the dong, making his glasses slide off his nose all the time
- "No touching, Harry." - Harry how beautiful that sounds. So animalistic and passionate.
- "Mr Malfoy, I insist..." teacher was cut off by horny teenage
- "Take me now! Please. Fuck me.!" - Heir of Malfoy stroked it gently on the cheeks so that after a while its hardness split Scarhead.
- ''What the fuck is wrong with you, Pottah! Get out, you filthy little pervert. ''-
Malfoy hurried his movements, and Scarhead knew she was going to taste him soon. As a long growl escaped the pure-blood's mouth, Potter looked up hazy. He wanted to see the blonde's face when he came. There was a salty taste in his mouth that took hold of his palate. After a while, the blows stopped and the prick slipped from his mouth. His breathing was heavy and fast. Malfoy wiped his erection against Griffindor's cheek, leaving a few white patches on the pink blushed cheeks.
-"Father..."
- ''Yeahh,a aahh, Give me your big dick to me...ahhhah'' - Potter's screams bounced off the bathroom walls.
