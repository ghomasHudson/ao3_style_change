"Draco, what's going on?", Severus then wanted to know.
"Thank you and ... don't wait for me," he said.
"Dray, if ... if it weren't for the bond, maybe you could go on living."
"Being married. Did you ever think about that?", Draco laughed briefly.
"You do know what you're talking about, don't you?"
"No one will be extradited here, we ...", he got no further. A scream broke the silence.
"Good night then. I'll take care of them," Madame Pomfrey said and Severus left the hospital wing. Outside the door, he ran a quick hand through his hair. What should he do now? Ultimately, there was only one way to keep them both safe from harm, but did they want that? Potter had no one left, his parents were dead, so was his godfather and his relatives had abused him for years. But Draco had a family and they should know what had happened. Severus took a deep breath and hurried out of the castle.
"Nothing ... it's just strange."
"I'm fine," it was true, the pain was not pleasant, but Harry was used to much worse. Suddenly he felt Draco take his hand. At first he wanted to protest and pull it away, but immediately the pain subsided, becoming only slight and barely noticeable. Draco smiled wanly when he saw Harry's completely stunned face.
"Are you sure?" he wanted to know anxiously and propped himself up with his elbows beside Harry. The latter came up and sealed her lips again.
"Yes ... as you take it, but not here," Severus said seriously, threw a few coins on the table and emptied his glass.
"Was it Umbridge?"
"They are bowtruckle. They only live in wandwoods and are very shy. This family has lived here for a long time and they trust Hagrid, otherwise we wouldn't see them. They sort of guard the tree," Harry explained quietly.
"There are only two options. One is that Poppy pumps you full of pain potions and we keep looking for a way to separate you or ..."
"You told them to make it work and they did," the Slytherin said with a smile and turned away.
"We'll go then and if ... if you need anything, say so, okay?" asked Hermione.
"Who are these Ravenclaws?", Ron wanted to know in a whisper as they followed Dumbledore and the others.
"What happened?"
"Horace, what was that potion?", Madame Pomfrey now wanted to know urgently.
"Draco, how is this supposed to go on? We can't move two metres away from each other if I don't want to die, that's no life and there's no prospect of a 'cure' either," Harry now looked directly at Draco and his lips quivered.
"Is he there?", Draco wanted to know quickly.
"Daddy look," Sirius came running out of the kitchen, followed by a smiling Remus. Harry leaned over to his eldest.
"No, Cho that was just ... I liked her, but not the way you're supposed to like a girl when you're straight. I didn't know what I really wanted and I thought maybe the kiss would clear things up."
"It saddens me, but I agree with you. So when should I marry them?"
"None of your business and just so you know, itâ€™s clean," Draco said.
"Let's go to sleep, okay?" said Draco.
"No, so nothing at all," he said.
"Good morning," he said, looking inquiringly at Draco and Harry, who stood hand in hand in front of him.
"What does it smell like here?" he wanted to know.
"Better, isn't it?" asked Harry, who could see perfectly well that Draco's pain must have subsided too.
"Certainly Mr. Malfoy," Severus said, waving his wand under the table. There was now a silence spell over them, but there were hardly any guests left in the inn anyway.
"Severus ... h-he let you fall asleep and calmed you down and then brought you here," Draco said, visibly embarrassed. Harry nodded again and now moved a little away from Draco.
"B-But ..."
"Yes, I do and he me!"
"Do I look worried?", Snape wanted to know belligerently.
"Yes, yes ... I mean we both have little or rather no experience."
"Um...how are you? Is something wrong with your hair?" Draco wanted to know and entered.
"Come on Potter or are you going to grow into it!" he shouted.
"Yeah, little Weasley's going to be pretty confused when Uncle Sev, gives her the brush-off," Draco said, laughing. Harry looked at him, confused.
Severus Snape had quickly reached the headmaster's office and hoped that the man was there. He didn't know why he had such a bad feeling, but he knew he should talk to Dumbledore if he wanted to find out what was behind all this.
"Dray, a gentleman never tells," Blaise said, raising his wand and casting the counterspell on Harry.
"Do you hear the rustling? It's almost like the rustling of the wind in the leaves of the Forbidden Forest, but it's louder, much louder. It splashes, thunders and the water slaps against the rocks. The wind carries the calls of seagulls far into the land. It smells of salt and seaweed. Your feet sink into the fine sand and the water runs over them. The waves pull at your feet, but you stop. The sun makes the sea glitter as if diamonds were floating on it. Children run up and down laughing, trying to catch the waves. We walk arm in arm behind them. The sun is slowly setting and all is well," he concluded. Harry in his arms had fallen asleep. Draco smiled sadly, kissed his husband's temple and pulled a blanket over them both.
"But not a completely lousy subject, is it?" he then wanted to know with amusement.
"Good morning, how are you feeling?" she asked.
"Now we couldn't work through our list at all," Draco said quietly.
"I-It wasn't the first time," he said hesitantly.
"Yes, mine too. Then sit here on the bed," Harry said and slid a little to one side. Draco hesitated briefly, but then did as he was told.
"I bet it was Nott!"
"Someday I would want to, but right now I only want one thing - Draco. Without him, this makes no sense. It's not my in-between, it's ours," he said and Sirius smiled.
"B-But why ... so I don't understand why one of them suffer pain when they are only a few metres apart."
"Muffliato," he said. The Gryffindor nodded with a smile, reached for his book and began to read again.
"I guess after all these years of putting ourselves in danger over and over again, it had to happen. Can't say I would have wished for it," he said. Harry nodded with a smile, stepped towards Ron and gave him a quick hug.
"Headmaster, what's going on? Why are you so concerned about this? Once the bond is complete, Harry and Draco can move away from each other again and the lord will never know."
"Please let me finish. The blood protection, protected Harry from the curse and bounced it back to the lord himself. But it didn't kill him, it chipped off part of his soul and that soul part attached itself to the only living thing in the room - Harry," Albus said, sinking exhausted into his chair. Severus stared at him. His mind barely grasped what the man had just said. The teacher felt like ice water was flooding his guts.
"Okay, Severus we were never friends, but I'm asking you to talk because you're really scaring me, I've never seen you like this," Remus pleaded. The other looked up but avoided the werewolf's gaze.
"Yes, they are confident that we will be separated soon," he said and felt bad. He didn't want to lie to his best friends and he would love to tell him everything, but what actually? That he and Draco might be tied together forever? No, he couldn't, because he didn't understand what that could mean yet.
"Yes, it is, but it was the right thing to do. This wedding was one of her last wishes," said the potions master.
"No, that's not what I mean. I-I just couldn't shock you, but you ... you didn't seem to have a problem with it," Harry said, visibly embarrassed. Draco stopped and held Harry by the wrist.
Severus walked through the empty and silent corridors of the school. It was curfew and no students were outside the common rooms. He turned two corners and then climbed the stairs to the hospital wing. When he entered, Harry and Draco were already sitting side by side on the edge of the bed.
"I don't know, but I don't like it."
"It's my fault that now Draco has to die too ..."
"Good, I'll have some food and your things brought to you," Snape said, looking again at Madame Pomfrey, who nodded at him.
"What about him?", Draco wanted to know in a panic.
"Because of him, isn't it? He could use Draco to kill me," came quietly from Harry.
"I see, but Sev ... we are Draco's parents, shouldn't we ...", Narcissa said in a brittle voice.
"We were talking about moving in together, so I was talking about moving in with him, and about taking Harry in for good, and about having children..., " Remus laughed bitterly, put down his glass and looked at Severus.
"Slept with someone? No ... not really," Draco said, looking embarrassed.
"Hey, so if you say so okay, but Harry ... falling in love is really not a bad thing?" he said, patting Harry on the shoulder and walking over to Hagrid.
"I'll have to report this to the Headmaster, I'm sure you know that," Harry glanced at Draco, who still didn't dare look at him.
"All right, I'll do it. Tomorrow around 8pm in the Room of Requirement. Where are they now?"
"On the floor, of course," Draco said with a grin, pulling a mattress out from under his bed.
"Mhm ... I'm sorry, what did you say?"
"Are we talking about love?" Narcissa now wanted to know.
"It ... I don't know, I have to sort something out. They're in good hands here. I'll come in the morning!"
"But why are you staying with Snape now?", Hermione changed the subject.
"The Order is here! There were first fights with Death Eaters in Hogsmeade, we were able to beat them back, but we must act now and secure the castle," the werewolf said. Dumbledore nodded.
"Our children?"
"Not important," Harry said, sitting down on the mattress and pulling out his homework.
"M-Make that again," he gasped. Draco grinned and did as he was told. Again Harry moaned indignantly, he had the feeling that his whole body was electrified. Without him noticing, Draco added a third finger and Harry could no longer think straight. Draco kissed him deeply, devouring every sound.
"All right, I'll check on you tonight," he said then and was already at the door when he heard Harry's voice.
"So I'll do the firethorn and you take care of the flubberworms. Can you manage that?" sneered Draco now. Harry rolled his eyes but nodded. Draco stared at him in irritation. Since the beginning of the year there had been no biting comment, no point from Potter and that bothered Draco more than he wanted to admit.
"I don't know, but I think in the end it's up to the boys to decide, we can only try to stand by them," he said, feeling his wife's nod on his shoulder.
"It is, but I need to check something."
"Yeah, you look like hell too."
"All well?" he asked Harry, who nodded. The Slytherin walked on and was now standing at the door, much more than two metres away.
"In a way, yes."
"All right, I won't say anything, but I will make sure it is discovered. I have a duty of care and I can't just ignore it," the teacher said. Draco sighed but nodded.
"I understand you dad and look at it this way, if that hadn't happened back then, I might not have the family I have now, so I'm grateful to the flubberworms," he said.
"How are you?" he wanted to know gently, addressing Harry.
"So what do we do now?" asked Draco after a while of silence.
"Now don't look like that, so tonight ... tonight you both come here and then we'll talk about everything, but now you have to go. Breakfast starts soon and you still have to get your things from the hospital wing," Severus said then and the knot in his stomach tightened again.
"Harry James Potter will you be my husband?" he asked smiling and now Harry smiled too and nodded.
"Please Uncle Sev, I promised!" the Slytherin pleaded.
"I will put them both up at my place. I have a spare room. They only go to classes and eat in the flat. The less contact they have especially with the Slytherins, the less will be known about their true condition."
"It's alright, you don't have to explain anything," Remus said and Snape nodded.
"Well, I must be off," Severus said quickly and was out of the room before Remus could say anything back. Remus looked thoughtfully after the Potions Master before he stood up and emptied his cup of coffee.
"Honey, we can't stay, it would be too dangerous," Narcissa said gently.
"You confuse courage with the will to survive. I am not courageous. I had to be in order to survive, but I don't think it's necessarily in my nature."
"Will he come here?"
"What is it?", Draco wanted to know and stroked his cheek gently. Harry leaned against the caressing hand and sighed.
"I believe you, but you never know. Please lie down and Mr Malfoy you can sit at the foot of the bed," said Poppy. Draco nodded and made room while Harry lay down on his back with a sigh.
"Yes, we didn't know anything about it either until recently...", Draco said and began haltingly. Ron, Hermione and Blaise became paler and paler and at some point Hermione sobbed. Immediately Ron put an arm around her shoulder. Blaise, too, was visibly fighting tears.
"W-what makes you think that?", Harry wanted to know.
"Dying, if then at least one of us can go on with his normal life, then I would do it."
"Don't you have to go?", Blaise Zabini looked questioningly at his best friend, who was putting away his homework.
"Not nice, like it's going to tear me apart and with you?"
"Feels good!" he said with a smile.
"Uncle Sev, can't you bring the students away?", Draco wanted to know, but Severus shook his head.
"I'll be careful," he then said softly and pushed a bit into Harry. He tensed, which was different from the fingers. Draco remembered Blaise's words and gently stroked Harry's chest and then his erection.
"I-I don't know exactly, it seems I have some of her memories too. It came over me suddenly when the plate fell to the floor earlier," Harry explained calmly, sat down at the table and started his homework.
"You are happy, for this moment, and that is what counts," Narcissa said quivering.
"Are you ready?" wanted to know Severus, who was also wearing an elegant suit.
"Nothing will happen to you. The prefects take their fellow students to the dungeons. Follow, Mr. Filch! He will show you the way to the secret passages. The teachers are protecting the hall. No one leaves the building!" the man said, giving Draco and Harry a look that they both immediately understood. While the prefects began to collect their charges, many of the adults stayed behind to help the teachers.
"You'll know, don't worry," Sirius said, giving him a kiss on the forehead.
"I love you too," he whispered and closed his eyes.
"Good morning, I see you're an early riser too," Severus Snape said and sat down at the kitchen table. Remus Lupin looked up from his coffee and nodded.
"It's good to have you back among us Harry," the man said.
"We'll leave you to it then," Severus said and looked at Remus, who nodded. The werewolf walked past Harry and patted him encouragingly on the shoulder before leaving the flat behind Severus.
"Yes, sir, Madame Pomfrey thinks my injuries are healed."
"He's calling us," he said with a pained face.
"As if you'd care," Harry said barely audibly.
"Yes, they are, but it's just a precaution," he said and sat down.
"I-It's about our funeral..." said Draco quickly, squeezing Harry's hand tighter.
"Leave it, there's something about detention together," Draco said, grinning briefly before turning back to the parchment.
"N-no, I can't ask that and no ..." he stammered.
"Your princess is with Draco and he's still looking for a parking space, but he's coming back there," at that moment a young man with blond short hair stepped through the garden gate. In his arms he carried a little girl with black hair and sea-blue eyes.
"Not so sensitive Lupin, all right, yes I am worried, but how to explain it I don't know, because it affects you as much as me," Severus said sighing.
"And help Ron and Hermione and Severus too. We'll be fine, I'm sure," Remus swallowed hard, nodded and gave Harry a kiss on the forehead.
"What are you doing here? You should be in your houses!" he growled.
"So really I'm Harry Potter, rule-breaker personified, of course I know the Room of Requirement," Harry said, playfully indignant, grabbing Draco's hand and dragging him behind him.
"Okay listen Malfoy. I'm sitting with the Slytherins, sleeping here and I'm practically chained to you if I don't want to die. At least spare me the looks of the Slytherins, that's all I ask," Harry said with deep resignation in his voice. Blaise looked at Draco, who sighed, sat down on his bed and began his homework as well.
"The last few weeks and months have not exactly been easy," he said, fighting down the tears that were welling up.
"It's okay Narcissa, we're fine, really. How are you?" Harry wanted to know.
"I'm afraid so," Severus nodded and turned away.
"Can we explode something?" the four-year-old asked, grinning. Severus rolled his eyes, handed Lily to Remus and took Sirius by the hand.
"Oh, that. No I won't say anything, but I'm very happy for you. It was almost obvious that this potion didn't just create a bond, but only activated it, wasn't it?" asked Blaise and the other two stared at him in surprise.
"What's so funny?", Harry wanted to know.
"Better not, as white as Severus is, he'll turn to dust in the sun," Lucius said, laughing.
"Didn't she kiss you? I saw you when we got off the train," slowly it dawned on Harry again and he grinned.
"We're a couple?"
"Anyway, let's get this over with quickly," Snape said, unpacking the books. His hand itched and he scratched at it as he bristled.
"Whatever," Draco said and began to study the recipe.
Severus and the boys walked back to Hogwarts in silence. Harry sensed his fiancÃ© fighting his deep despair and the ever-present fear that this meeting might be the last with his parents. Gently, he stroked the back of his hand with his thumb as they followed the teacher, always staring down the path. Severus was also lost in thought. He hadn't spoken to Remus about it, but he was wondering if he should tell them that he and the werewolf were now a couple, or if they should keep it to themselves, because for now it should just be about Harry and Draco. So in thought, he had soon reached his flat.
"Mr. Potter, how are you feeling?", McGonagall wanted to know.
"No Dray ... um Draco, it's okay. I've come to terms with it over the last six years."
"Oh, by the way, do you know what Sev did?", Remus quickly tried to change the subject.
"Is dead and this time for real and forever."
"Yes, he must have committed six murders for that too. Unfortunately."
"You too and thank you," Harry said, Draco also thanked him and quickly they both left the office.
"Come, let's sit down in the sand. I am here because you need me to keep your true soul anchored. I'll show you the two paths you can take, so to speak."
"I'm afraid so. But you'll find a way to see each other," Severus said, looking at Remus, who was barely perceptibly shaking his head.
"Thank you Molly," Harry then said and hugged first the woman and then Arthur Weasley tightly.
"C-Can we stay here tonight?", Draco wanted to know at some point, trembling.
"Um... may I?", Severus looked up startled and raised his eyebrows in surprise. He hadn't expected the man who stood in front of him and shyly asked for a seat.
"Well, come along then. We have the best rooms in the house," Draco said, letting Harry go first.
"Ah good evening. Please come in," he said and let the Malfoys enter. They nodded stiffly and followed the teacher. Severus raised his wand, locked the room and immediately cast a silencing spell over it.
"Will it work?", Poppy wanted to know thoughtfully. But Dumbledore smiled.
"So now go to bed. Breakfast will be here tomorrow. Good night," Severus said and turned away. Harry and Draco stepped into the room. It was small, but it was enough. The bed was even slightly bigger than the one in Draco and Blaise's room. Their trunks were already in a corner.
"No ... it's a soul bond, you know what that's like, you can't just undo it," Severus said, visibly irritated.
"I guess we're in the habit of you saving my life," he said sheepishly.
"Oh yeah, sure," Draco said, turning towards the door.
"W-when will it happen?", Hermione wanted to know.
"All right, I'll go then. See you around ... take your time," he said and disappeared.
"Not at all shy Mr Potter," he said and Harry raised his eyebrows apologetically.
"Nightmares?" asked Draco then. Harry said nothing, just sighed.
"Mr Malfoy? Draco, look at me," he said energetically. Draco raised his eyes.
"Hello puppy, how are you?" he wanted to know and now also looked at Draco, who had hesitantly come closer.
"It's okay, I told you I didn't mind the detention. Pansy deserved it."
"P-please Harry, come down from there," he pleaded, his heart beating so hard against his ribs that he thought it would have to burst at any moment.
"No ... Remus and I, want to tell them tonight. Conveniently, they got detention from me."
"Go on," he said and also put on the shirt he was still holding in his hands. Draco now knelt on the bed and took Harry's face in his hands, the skin contact immediately making the stabbing pain disappear again.
"I know you blame me Severus, but it won't change anything," Albus said, visibly guilty.
"Yes, we are afraid of that. Therefore, from now on, you will both live with me. I still have a spare room and you will also have every meal there."
"Do you want me to be there?" asked Remus hesitantly. Severus looked up. He had been hoping for just that. The brat liked Lupin and the latter felt responsible for him. Snape couldn't exactly say Potter trusted him, so Lupin was the best choice.
"That was Mum, she wanted to kill us both and ... and that's when Mum killed her first. Don't look like that, she wasn't my aunt or Mum's sister for a long time, she was just mad. Anyway, they burnt both bodies and there was a lot going on here after that. Press, the ministry and stuff. The school closed for a fortnight and everyone left, well almost everyone. The teachers are still here and so are Hermione, Ron, Blaise and Remus. Oh, and so are my parents. None of them wanted to leave you here alone," Harry nodded, touched, and kissed Draco gently. Suddenly they heard a clearing of the throat behind them. Madame Pomfrey was standing by the bed in her dressing gown and smiling.
"But Remus?", Harrys looked to the werewolf.
"Ginny and me? Rubbish, no! She's like my little sister," Draco's heart leapt.
"Hey, what's that supposed to mean?"
"So you go to the toilet first and I'll take a shower. That should be fine, neither is too far away, okay?" suggested Draco. Harry just nodded. Last night's conversation was still hanging over him. He saw Draco a little differently now. It almost seemed as if the other actually cared about him. While Draco showered, he went to the toilet and then, without thinking about it, took off his top.
"And now?", Lucius wanted to know.
"So? Dress robe or what should I wear?"
"Sure and ... I'd like to tell Blaise. It wouldn't be fair to just confront him with my death at some point."
"Well, I'll be off then. Good night Headmaster," said Severus.
"You may say Severus?"
"Do your duty, protect the school! Occupy all the entrances!" the teacher said and the statues followed her call. The other teachers now raised their wands and pointed to the sky. They cast the most powerful protective spells they could think of, even though they knew they couldn't do much against Voldemort.
"Yes, a-and the lord himself must do it," Snape said, his voice breaking.
"Don't be scared, okay?", Draco took his shirt and pulled it over as he looked worriedly at Harry, who still hadn't moved.
"But Draco, still ... it would be a lifelong commitment and I-I don't have anyone else, no family or anything, but you do and for my sake I don't want you to lose yours too," Draco shook his head and placed his hand gently on Harry's cheek.
When Severus reached the Headmaster's office, he was not the first one there. Professor McGonagall was standing in the room and turned around in surprise when Severus hurried in.
"What do I have to do now?" asked Harry.
"We'll work it out. We can meet here, secretly, and in the summer I'll stay here and Christmas. We'll manage," he said.
"Yeah, me too. Then let's have something to eat and then see what Professor Snape really wants from us."
"I have to agree with him!" said Remus, still smiling, leaning against a table. Snape rolled his eyes.
"We thought ... Well, you were in a coma or something," Ron said sheepishly. Blaise looked at his best friend and clearly sensed his tension.
"No, I have to eat with Professor Snape," he said curtly, turned and ran into the dungeons. Some of the Slytherins he met made snide comments. In his mind, Severus marked them for detention. As he turned the last corner, he suddenly tripped over a leg. He saw another laughing Crabbe running away and cursed.
"So, talk already, you've seen my body?!" he said without looking up. He felt someone pull up a chair next to him and knew that it was certainly not Snape.
"In times of joy as well as sadness."
"P-please don't do that. There are so many people who care about you. Don't throw this away," he said calmly.
"No, and I'm not going to tell them just yet. Draco has enough to suffer from being chained to Potter," Severus said dismissively.
"Good lesson, today. No homework, see you in two days," Hagrid closed the lesson. Harry picked up his bag and walked up to the castle. He was dreading the next lesson. They had Defence and besides Draco he had to meet Snape there and he had no idea how to act.
"Mhm ... do you think anyone else overheard that yesterday?"
"Good, then I'll see you in the morning and Sev, stop thinking so much for once in your life," Lucius said still, patting his best friend on the shoulder and climbing back up to the first floor. Severus sighed and pulled his cloak back on.
"Yes, I thought something like that and of course, Narcissa and Lucius want to come to the wedding too."
"Snape? No way, Harry probably has to scrub cauldrons with a toothbrush," Ron said and took another sausage.
"Honey, you wouldn't believe how long I've had a secret crush on you?"
"Dray, without me, you could just go on living and in the end it's not your decision," Harry said and turned around. Draco reacted immediately and climbed onto the parapet as well, resolutely grasping Harry's hand.
"She tortured him..." said Severus, stroking the scar he hadn't noticed before.
"Of course, professor!" he said and stood up. Immediately Draco was also on his feet.
"Said the man in the brown dressing gown," sneered the latter.
Severus Snape had not gone back to his flat, if there was something with the boys, he would hear about it here. He sat in the Three Broomsticks sipping a glass of wine. He was sure it would happen tonight and even though he would never have believed it, he was happy for Draco and also for Harry. A soul bond was so rare that he himself knew of no one who had ever encountered one and yet his joy was increasingly giving way to deep despair. He had spent hours in the last few days poring over books, tossing and turning all night in the forbidden section, and yet had found nothing. Nothing to untie the ribbon and thus at least save Draco, and nothing to remove the Horcrux from Harry.
"W-where?" he stammered.
"When you shocked me?"
"Look at it as an opportunity. Maybe you can sort out your conflicts," he whispered to the teacher. The teacher rolled his eyes but said nothing.
"Why not?", Draco wanted to know.
"Uh ... on the floor," he says quickly, trying convulsively not to blush.
"Me," Draco said simply, raising his wand and pointing at Harry. At first nothing happened, but then he closed his eyes and Harry was thrown backwards. Everything in Draco contracted as he saw Harry fly through the air. Following an inner reflex, he wanted to rush to him immediately, but he reconsidered. Moments later Harry was on his feet again.
"That!" said Draco, kissing the somewhat overwhelmed Harry.
"And you didn't say anything, you just raised him to die at the right moment?"
"That was Umbridge, I'll bet!" said Remus angrily.
"Firstly, please tell Severus and secondly, I know that. I see it and yet even if you didn't want to hurt Draco, you would have jumped if the bond hadn't been there, if Draco hadn't been there, wouldn't you?", Harry looked at Draco squeezing the latter's hand tighter, then looked back at Severus and nodded.
"Killed the Horcrux in you, but not you, not really. This is ... let's call it an in-between world."
"Ah yes, Harry and Draco are coming, please sit down," Dumbledore said and pointed to the two chairs in front of his desk. Hesitantly, the two sat down and moved the chairs a little closer together.
"W-we'll come, of course. Where and when?", Blaise wanted to know.
"What is it?" he wanted to know.
"I know," Severus said and left the office without looking back.
"Well I'd still like to join you," he said, making a small packet appear in his hand, which he placed with the others.
"Oh come on, there must be something to be said for having the body of a sixteen year old again," Remus said.
"This is a great biscuit," he said.
"Maybe I don't want to forget, though," Severus said, continuing to walk towards the werewolf. He heard Lucius' words echoing in his head,
"You do not move from the spot and you do not leave this flat. You will get food from the house elves. I'll be back here right after class! More comfortable clothes are in the wardrobe in the bedroom, but don't you dare snoop around," he said sternly and reached for the bag that belonged to Harry.
"Yeah, that sounds good."
"NO! THAT IS NOT AWFUL, THAT IS HORRIBLE!" he shouted.
Harry rubbed his eyes tiredly. The night in Snape's bed was much more restful than the last night on the couch. Still, he couldn't claim to have slept really well. In his dreams, his and Snape's memories intermingled. No, the teacher had had a similarly terrible childhood as himself, with one difference. Snape had a mother who loved him idolatrously and even if she sank into her depression at some point, by then he had at least one person who loved him. Sighing, Harry went into the bathroom and got dressed. Snape had obviously already left, or he would surely have heard him. As he walked into the living room, Harry's gaze fell on his open trunk and the realisation hit him so hard that he momentarily lost his breath. Snape knew, he was sure of it. Of course, he had to know, if Harry saw his memories, Snape saw Harry's. He buried his face in his hands and was looking for a way out when there was a knock at the front door. Harry looked up. What was he supposed to do? Snape must have forgotten to lock the classroom.
"I see, and which one?"
"Yes, I can see that. So there really is ... Love involved?", it was a question from the teacher, but no answer was needed.
"I think we did it," Draco said and walked back over to the bed, sitting down on it and looking worriedly at Harry. His friend looked sad.
"Yes, Ron ... I was dead, but I still look better than you," Harry opened his eyes and grinned. Hermione, Ron and Blaise were standing in front of his bed. Draco was also just waking up and rubbing his eyes.
"You look really well," Narcissa said, wiping a tear from the corner of her eye.
"Shh ... relax," he murmured. Harry took a deep breath and the pain disappeared, he only felt Draco, his hands everywhere, his smell - only Draco. The latter sensed that Harry was relaxing and penetrated him completely. The feeling was hard to describe, he had never felt more aroused and so loved at the same time. He paused and gave Harry time to get used to the feeling, and it took all his control not to thrust immediately.
"At the risk of sounding cruel again, I'd rather I-I killed them, but Albus thinks the Lord himself must do it, so kill Harry," Severus said, his stomach tightening painfully at those words.
"Well, that could have been a trigger, of course," Poppy said, smiling slightly.
"Guard?" asked Draco quietly as Hagrid and a few students fed the Bowtruckles.
"Shut up Pansy!" came from Blaise.
"Well, as long as they don't move more than two metres away, it's all good, but .... well Mr. Potter might die if Mr. Malfoy moves away for a longer period of time or if the distance gets bigger, I guess. Mr. Malfoy doesn't show such strong reactions, but I can't estimate how a longer separation would affect him."
"He knew it, he knew it all along. He only raised the boy to die. I knew Dumbledore would stop at nothing, but that ... by Salazar he ... they're just children," Lucius said exhaustedly.
"Come Draco, we'll go to my place," he said and never had Draco seen his uncle look so pale.
"Yes, in a way. I was at the place you described to me on the day of our wedding. I could choose ..."
"I thought only Blaise was allowed to do that?"
"Dray ... I-I can't ... I can't take it anymore," he moaned and immediately he came between their sweaty bodies, only seconds later Draco followed him screaming loudly and immediately it was as if hot water was flowing through both of their bodies. They were bathed in a bright white light, which immediately disappeared. Breathing heavily, they lay on top of each other, unable to speak or move. At some point Draco managed to clean them up with a spell, after lying down next to Harry and pulling him into his arms. Only moments later, they had both fallen into a deep sleep.
"Remus seems to have gone too," he said when they found the living room empty.
"Are you all right?" he wanted to know.
"Were you serious earlier?" the werewolf asked.
"Yes, it's me," the boy said, nodding.
"Come to bed, your chattering teeth are unbearable," Draco murmured. Harry thought about it for a moment, but he was really cold and he would never find sleep like that. He got up, grabbed the blanket and pillow and lay down next to Draco. He just managed to suppress a sigh. The warmth emanating from the Slytherin was indescribable.
"Yeah, it's great and now ... what do we do now?", Harry looked around uncertainly. Draco rubbed the back of his neck in embarrassment.
"What are you going to wear tonight?" Narzissa now tried to lighten the depressed mood.
"What do you mean, not really? And yet the girls run after you," Harry said in surprise. Now Draco rubbed the back of his neck.
"Did you have this too?" he wanted to know quietly.
"What do we do now?", Harry wanted to know.
"Talk to me, please," he said. Remus took a deep breath and put his hand on Severus'.
"Tell what?" the latter asked, grinning knowingly.
"My dear, please take these potions," Madame Pomfrey handed him two vials, which he immediately emptied.
"Honey, of course we don't want to miss your wedding, but ..."
"Enough!" now thundered Snape and also stepped in front of the boys and their protectors.
"Well, other ... well, problems?"
"Thanks, what time is it," he said, sipping the coffee.
"Did you hear that Lily? Well, I think Grandpa Sev really needs detention again!" he said and the little girl grinned at him.
"A-All of it ... it's tearing me apart," Harry moaned. The woman let her wand wander over Harry and turned pale.
"That I can stay here and that you were so honest."
"Almost ten o'clock," Draco then said.
"Yes?"
"We'll think of something to keep it a secret for now, and there's one more thing you could help me with..." said Harry.
"Ah, mon amis!" he said, beaming, and came towards father and son. Harry swallowed hard. The young Malfoy was handsome. He wore simple linen shorts and a white shirt.
"Very well, we'll take you and Mr Malfoy to the hospital wing. You have some minor burns. Luckily the explosion only hit you both full on," Slughorn said, helping Harry to stand up. The latter stood shakily. He had a headache and his face was burning slightly. Draco was now getting to his feet too. He seemed to have taken less of a beating, but he also looked pretty battered.
"Your heroism is appreciated, Potter, but it doesn't have to come to that. I understand that this situation is not easy, but ... but there might be a way that you two could at least move away from each other," Severus said, inwardly cursing himself for mentioning it, it would only complicate things.
"Back with me and that's where they should stay for now."
"Professor I ... I didn't mean to, I could never hurt Draco."
"Mum, it's important. We want to be buried together and ... and I know it's not ... not befitting our status, but we want to be buried next to Harry's parents, in Godric's Hollow," Draco said quivering. Narcissa could say nothing, tears streaming down her face. Lucius took a deep breath and then nodded.
"I will always love you...", Harry said close to tears.
"Honestly yes, have you heard from Harry or Draco?", Hermione wanted to know. Blaise shook his head in resignation.
"Really cute," Draco said, grinning.
"I will take you to the Room of Requirement. There you will be undisturbed and should ... should anything happen, the room will alert someone," Severus said.
"I want to see the sun at last, I can't stand the weather here," Draco grumbled. In fact, the sun had not been seen for days and it rained again and again.
"How was it?" he wanted to know with interest.
"There is no other solution, is there?" asked Lucius, sitting down with his wife.
"What did it say?" wanted to know Severus.
"All right. You know we need to talk about yesterday and I'm not the only one who wants to. I'm just here to take you to Dumbledore."
"Let go of me, what are you doing?" the latter wanted to know.
"Yeah, yeah loosen up Remy," Severus toned and ran after his grandson.
"Good, so what should we do?", Lucius looked questioningly at his best friend.
"Professor Snape said that through the bond I can transfer some of my magic to you, it takes away the pain and makes you heal faster," he explained.
"Harry, normally even the darkest wizards make at most a single Horcrux of themselves. Tom Riddle must have been obsessed with the number seven. He developed the idea of dividing his soul into seven parts. Six parts were supposed to live outside his body. That's definitely Dumbledore's assumption."
"What do you think is going on?", Ron wanted to know, but Blaise shrugged his shoulders.
"This between us, do you really want that or is it just an anchor right now?" asked Remus visibly uncomfortable. Severus tilted his head, understanding what Remus meant, and took a deep breath for a moment.
"Yes, they are ... well, a couple, if you can call it that. After Mr. Potter's suicide attempt, they confessed their feelings to each other," Severus explained.
"Will? They abuse him to this day," Draco said nothing, just nodded. Severus rubbed his eyes.
"Erm ... visiting you and ... eh ... Order stuff. Severus was kind enough to let me stay the night," he explained and Harry looked at the Potions Master in surprise.
"Well after the end of the Death Eaters and after our son killed the Lord, it became known that we were working as spies for the Ministry. The Daily Prophet has had no other topic for days," Lucius explained.
"Get started, the recipe is on the blackboard!" he said sternly now, sitting down behind his desk and correcting papers. Harry looked at the blackboard, in itself he should be able to manage the potion. Hermione had said that it was quite complicated. Not in terms of ingredients, but the different ways it had to be warmed, cooled and stirred. He started and made good progress. The potion looked like it needed to look. The last instruction for the flubber worms, on the blackboard he had difficulty deciphering. Since his last run-in, if it could be called that, with his uncle, he had felt that his vision was worse than before. He didn't want to ask Snape, though, so he grabbed the flubberworms and just threw them whole into the cauldron. He stirred, but the consistency wasn't really right anymore. It began to smoke and Snape looked up.
"Do you know the Room of Requirement?" asked Draco.
"What can I do for you?" he wanted to know and sat down in the armchair opposite the other.
"Sure you may, it would be a great honour," she said.
"What is it then?" wanted to know Severus.
"Please don't ever do that again," the man mumbled into the boy's hair.
"It's medicine, it's not supposed to taste," the healer said with a smile and let her wand wander over the young man.
"O-Okay."
"Not without Harry's death," Dumbledore interjected.
"We assume ... no, we know that there is one more," Snape said, swallowing hard.
"Yes, I go to Madame Pomfrey's and come here every night after dinner. I haven't forgotten," Harry said. He hesitated briefly, but then went to the teacher again and gave him a quick hug.
"We are here today to marry two young people who were probably always meant for each other. Two people who found each other and give each other support in times when all hope seems lost. But is it? In every parting there is a piece of hope, hope for a way forward and that is why we stand here today. Harry and Draco have chosen to say their own vows," Dumbledore concluded, looking at the young men invitingly. They turned to each other and took each other's hands in theirs.
"We were thinking of the dress robes," Harry said hesitantly.
"What, why don't you tell us?", Draco wanted to know angrily, not bothering to use the formal â€šprofessorâ€˜. Severus stood up and ran his hand through his hair.
"You can?", Hermione wanted to know.
"Merry Christmas to you too, Sev," Draco said with a smile and kissed his father-in-law on the cheek. The one-year-old Lily stretched out her arms and her grandfather did not miss the opportunity to lift the little girl into his arms.
"Y-Yes, sure," Harry said in a weak voice. The headmaster nodded and looked round.
"Well Malfoy, don't you and your lover even go hand in hand?" one of the young men sneered and his friends laughed loudly.
"Then I'll do it," Harry said quietly.
"Surely not, but it is what it is," Draco said with a smile.
"W-what, they are still abusing you today, but why..."
"You don't have to do that ... I ..."
"Yes, thank you," Draco said, kissing Harry one more time in confirmation.
"Let's go to sleep, okay?" asked Harry and Draco nodded. He turned out the light and then took Harry's hand again.
"All right, I would like you to move away from each other," she then said.
TW: Suicide and abuse as a topic!
"Mione, come on," Ron whispered, holding out his hand to the young woman. They crept towards the grand staircase, ever careful not to run into another trust student, or Filch. After stealing out of the common room, they had changed their clothes. Blaise wanted to wait for them so that they could claim detention if necessary. When they arrived at the stairs, however, there was no sign of the Slytherin.
"And that's supposed to work?" asked Draco sceptically.
They followed Slughorn to the hospital wing, where Madame Pomfrey was already meeting them.
"N-no ... no that can't be. No, I won't let that happen," he stammered, tears coming to his eyes. Severus said nothing, guessing that after Sirius' death, Harry was the only thing, or the only person, that still somehow connected Remus to James and Lily. When it came down to it, the boy was the only piece of family he had left. Severus knew that the man had pleaded with Dumbledore to let him take Harry in, after last summer. The two had got on well from the start and now Severus also knew that Harry had needed more than just a fatherly friend, but much more a father.
"Potter ... Harry, I messed up the potion, I alone and that's why we're sitting here, isn't it?", Harry sighed.
"There was a little accident...", Severus began to summarise the events of the last two days.
"Oh, he was special ... very special and ... let's not do this. You should go. I'll deal with the school and ... and the rest when the time comes," Dumbledore said and put a hand on the shoulder of the two boys.
"Were those the Muggles?" he saw immediately from the look on Harry's face that he was right. The Gryffindor lowered himself to the floor and drew his knees up. Draco sat down in front of him.
"Why don't you sit down," Harry said, straightening up a little. The Slytherin looked around searchingly.
"I think there's only one option if we don't want them to get more damaged," Severus said, and you could sense he was uncomfortable.
"Mr Potter?", Harry startled. The rest of the night he had been able to sleep without nightmares, now he looked into the gentle eyes of Madame Pomfrey.
"Don't tell Dad, please!"
"Yeah, see you then," the latter said and smiled at Hermione, who gave him a quick kiss on the hair.
"Did he just say 'he'?", Draco wanted to know in confusion, looking after the Headmaster as Harry smiled.
"Yeah, he's ... he's great," he said.
The Order seemed to have done a good job, because there were no more students in the corridors. As McGonagall and Severus hurried down the stairs, groups of students led by Order members kept coming out of the corridors. They all seemed scared and confused, but there was no panic. Severus and Minerva ran outside the great gate and from a distance they could see the dark mark rising in the distance. The other teachers were already standing outside the castle. Minerva looked at Severus and nodded determinedly.
"Why didn't you come to me?"
"What are we drinking to?" the werewolf wanted to know, visibly upset.
"Thank you Minerva."
"Potter!" he whispered, so as not to wake Blaise, who was snoring softly.
"Do you know what I really did in ancient runes? I read everything I found about the soul bond. That potion it would never have worked if you and I had been completely indifferent to each other. We had feelings for each other before and you were aware of them, that's why you were in such terrible pain. I knew I liked you, but I didn't know how much or how deeply, but with every hour we spent together it became clearer, and then ... Harry, I can't let you jump because... by Merlin, can't you think it?", Harry's tears were falling without ceasing now, they were still standing on the wall in the dark and below them was the abyss. Draco tried to pull Harry down but he shook his head. Only seconds later a spell hit them both from behind and they were thrown back onto the safe platform. Draco didn't notice much, only that his uncle and McGonagall were suddenly there, that Severus knelt beside Harry and touched him on the forehead and then someone pulled him to his feet.
"Why didn't he say anything?" asked Remus. Severus shrugged his shoulders.
"I nearly always have nightmares," he said softly and closed his eyes. Draco swallowed hard and automatically stroked the back of Harry's hand soothingly before he too fell asleep again.
"That was just for us!" said Harry, who had turned deep red, quickly.
"But ...", the girl sobbed. Harry shook his head and hugged her tightly.
"By Salazar Blaise, that was really clever," Draco said, laughing.
At the end of the lesson, Harry pushed through his back. The day was long and not yet over. They still had to go to "Ancient Runes". He already had great respect for Draco's workload. They climbed into the South Tower and Harry yawned heartily when they arrived at the classroom.
"We should do as he says and after dinner I'll show you how to apparate," Remus said.
Remus lay next to Severus in his bed and stared into the darkness. He suspected that the man next to him was also unable to sleep. Blindly, he reached for the other's hand and felt the light pressure it exerted on his.
"Yes, everything's okay," Harry said.
"Leave it! I promise I won't say anything, but don't try to find an excuse," the watering master said and left the office without turning around again.
"Ah, Mr Potter and Mr Malfoy. Why don't you sit there on the bed," the medicine witch said with a smile. The young men did as they were told.
"Where is Grandpa Remus?" he wanted to know and was already halfway down the hall.
"I don't think so really. Severus and McGonagall were probably right there and when Sev took you away, there were only a few in the corridors," Draco said and Harry nodded. Draco took Harry's hand in his and smiled.
"Ron, they can't keep sneaking off, it would be noticed eventually," Hermione said.
"I need to assess how bad it is, so please," Madame Pomfrey said.
"Yes, very funny Luc. What are you wearing? Were the plain shirts sold out?", amused, Severus eyed his best friend, whose shirt was adorned with green palm fronds.
"Yes, Albus suspected it too."
"All right, then let's set them up, but what are we going to do with the evening that has begun?", Draco wanted to know, not without ulterior motives.
"We share the balcony," Draco said and had already stepped out onto it. Harry followed him.
"Really?"
"Uncle Sev, what's ... so we get to let our friends in on it?"
"I'm glad to hear that, so something good came of it, didn't it? Well, go and have some supper, and Harry I beg you to remember our agreement," said Dumbledore, looking at the young man seriously over his half-moon glasses.
"You know what's stupid? I wasn't scared when I started, but when I blacked out, I ... I thought of Ron and Hermione and suddenly found myself selfish," Draco stood up and pulled his chair in front of Harry.
"Okay, close your eyes," Draco said, closing his too and began to tell quietly:
"Just saying..." he said, chewing.
"Narcissa, be so kind as to see if he is really dead. I almost feel sorry for your son, but well we all make sacrifices, don't we?" sneered the lord, but his voice was strangely weak. Narcissa broke away from her husband, tears streaming down her face, and she walked slowly towards the bodies lying on the ground. First she came to Harry and knelt before him. He was cold and his lips pale. Carefully she bent down and stretched out her fingers. Was there something? A pulse? A breathing? Yes, it was there, faint but there. Narcissa's heart was racing, what should she do?
"Yes, they were very exhausted," Narcissa said and rose to get ready for bed as well. Lucius, too, conjured up a pair of pyjamas and lay down on Harry's side, while Narcissa lay next to Draco.
"Congratulations," said his best friend and at the same moment Ron came to the table.
"We thought it was about time!" he said, looking up at the house from which Narcissa and Lucius had just emerged.
"Well, they are very empathic creatures, they sense fear, sadness and despair and they want to help. Comfort and stuff...", he explained, clearing his throat sheepishly. Everyone looked at Harry, who would have liked to disappear.
"Are you a Malfoy now?" asked Ron.
"If it wasn't for me, would you have stayed?", Draco wanted to know, stroking Harry's cheek.
"A blow to the head, could exacerbate a visual impairment..."
"Merry Christmas, Harry. Where are your husband and my princess?" he wanted to know and looked around searchingly. Harry grinned. Snape had really softened over the years and since he was a grandfather even more. Only in front of his students he still didn't show any shame.
Harry thought and wiped his hands on his trousers before joining the others.
"No, who could, but do we have a choice?"
"Do you mind?"
"Yes?"
"Darling, I'm back," Lucius said, entering the drawing room and handing his coat to one of the house elves. Narcissa looked up and put the book she had been reading on the page.
"Well ... we wanted ...", he stammered.
"Now then," Voldemort said at some point, raised his wand and Harry closed his eyes. He saw once more his parents smiling at him, his friends laughing with him, his first ride on the Hogwarts Express, his first ride on a broom, Sirius, the first kiss with Draco, the first time, the wedding, all that seemed to have been in another life, then he heard, "AVADA KEDAVA!", saw the green light through his eyelids and then nothing.
"Gee Ron and then what? Draco dies when Harry dies, so why should he?" asked Hermione indignantly.
"I ... ever since we met, or rather, ever since we fell in love, that ... that's when I thought about it. Our bond would never let us be happy with anyone else and ... so ..." said Harry, fighting back tears. Draco stood up and put a hand on his friend's cheek.
"Erm ... Hagrid offered me his couch, so I'll have to share it with Fang, but that's okay," Remus said and smiled.
"Sorry Remus, my mind was elsewhere," the teacher said, pointing to the sofa in the living room.
"What in Salazar's name is this Draco? I thought you were separated again? Why are you holding hands with him?". Pansy put her hands on her hips and looked at Harry in disgust.
"Oh ... Um, yes," Draco said and got up from the bed. Harry grabbed his sleeping shirt and trousers and entered the bathroom. It wasn't particularly big, maybe it could do if Draco stayed just outside the door. They tried, but Harry couldn't even get as far as the toilet without nearly collapsing in pain.
"Hey, at the end of the day, sex is something spontaneous and intuitive. You'll know what to do when the time comes."
"No ... but I don't want it to be over so soon," came breathlessly from Harry. Draco nodded and came back up, lowering his lips to the other's and stroking gently down his sides to his bottom.
"Leave it Goyle!" hissed Draco.
"No, I ... I would like to take him to me, but I don't think my 'little' problem will allow it," Remus said bitterly.
"Well, what can that be?" said Remus, tossing a screeching Sirius into the air.
"I know you feel bad, and I understand, but what do you think Sirius would want for you?" the teacher asked, his voice trembling, something that usually never happened. Remus looked the man in the eye, even though it was difficult to do so in the pale light. Almost in slow motion, he reached out and placed his hand behind Severus' neck, only to pull him towards him and connect their lips. Briefly they disengaged, but it was Severus who immediately took the initiative again and went in for another kiss. It took a while, but eventually they had to separate again to catch their breath. Remus smiled and shook his head.
"Oh yes ... um, come on Harry," Draco said and stood up and Harry also rose and reached for his cloak.
"For as long as I can remember," Harry said wanly.
Severus turned wearily on his side and had to smile. The man next to him was still asleep and the Potions Master felt he had rarely seen anything more beautiful than Remus with tangled hair and asleep. He still wondered how it had all suddenly happened so quickly.
"Thank you Severus, but yes it should work there. What do you say, Harry?" Dumbledore wanted to know. The young man shrugged his shoulders.
"We have to go to detention," Draco sneered back, grabbing Harry by the upper arm and pulling him along.
"Mhm ... they look quite funny," Draco said.
"What do we do now?", Harry wanted to know.
"So what do you say?" wanted to know Horace Slughorn, looking nervously at Severus Snape, who was just putting his wand on his side.
"I thought I'd come and say goodbye," he said. Harry looked at him doubtfully.
"Are you saying the two of them are somehow connected now?", Blaise wanted to know in shock.
"I don't think anyone will say anything and if they do, we're on our way to a meeting with Dumbledore and now come on, it's time," Severus said, looking to Remus who nodded in agreement. They let the boys go first, as far as they could tell, and then followed. The corridors were empty, so close to curfew, only a few of the trust students were still out and about and apart from a curt greeting, most, ignored Severus and Remus. They climbed to the seventh floor and outside the wall that hid the Room of Requirement, Dumbledore was already waiting with two Ravenclaw students - a boy and a girl. Severus had never seen them before, not consciously in any case. They appeared to be first years. Under the cloak of invisibility, Harry and Draco also looked at each other questioningly.
"DRACO!" she screamed desperately and dropped down on top of her son. As she did so, she unobtrusively reached for Draco's wand, which lay beside him, and slipped it to him.
"Ah, I see the Snape-Potter family is present," Lucius said, laughing.
"Alright, I'll send Mr. Zabini right over, after all it's Saturday and Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger around afternoon if that's okay," asking looked at the boys who nodded in agreement.
"What do you mean?" he wanted to know, turning to Ron. He had just explained the situation to his friends, just as Draco had explained it to Blaise only hours before.
"Oh, she'll have to go through that. I really wonder how often they want to hear that story?" Draco then wanted to know and put an arm around his husband.
"Shh ... It's all right. I'm sorry," Draco said, kissing Harry's chest. He curled his fingers and the Gryffindor groaned.
"I love you," she whispered, then she joined her husband and they both left the Room of Requirement. It was at that moment that Draco sank to his knees crying and Harrys could do nothing but hold him in his arms.
"Go!" said Arthur Weasley shakily, and Draco pulled Harry with him, out into the open.
"I won't and now come on," Lupin said and led the way.
"But he was at the cemetery then and ..."
"You know I don't like to joke!"
"Well you are ... So you're officially a Death Eater and Remus is in the Order."
"Now, let's go!" said Severus, nipping any questions in the bud.
"Not me! Maybe I'll get you something else. See you," he said with a wink, then disappeared from the room.
"Congratulations, so some sort of residual sanity is still there, thankfully," Severus sneered.
"W-we have one more request," he said barely audibly.
"I love you too," he breathed.
"Yeah, but so did he," Harry said defiantly, looking at Draco, who rolled his eyes.
"Are you mad?", Harry wanted to know and the Slytherin looked at him irritated.
"Potter!"
"Er ... Yes, I'd like that, if you don't mind."
"Yes, I'm gay, just like you too, or are you interested in girls too? I mean Cho...", Harry quickly shook his head.
"Yeah, sure, why not?" asked Harry provocatively. Severus did not respond.
"Come on," he hissed, pushing the other through the crowded corridors to the Defence classroom. As Snape opened the door to let the students in, he looked inquiringly at Draco and Harry. Draco still had his hand on the other's upper arm.
"If I may. I would apparate home this morning and get a few things."
"W-When I look at you," the werewolf concluded and Severus' entire body tingled, but before he could say anything Remus hastily stood up.
"What ... what if we go away, far away?" Draco now asked hopefully, looking at Remus and Severus.
"You mean you hit him so hard that his eyesight is worse now?", Remus wanted to know in shock.
"Please Harry, listen. You mustn't tell anyone, swear," Draco said urgently.
"Yes, I do, but I'd like to hear it from you," Harry said and slid closer. Draco shook his head and closed the gap between them. Feeling Draco's lips on his was the best feeling Harry had ever felt.
"I assume your legs look similar," Madame Pomfrey said gently. Harry was still staring at the floor, but nodded stiffly.
"Shhh ... quietly," said Hagrid. Very slowly both animals came closer and the mare touched each one briefly with her muzzle. She stopped in front of Harry for a long time and Hagrid smiled.
"Yes, probably, and how does it look, are you staying?" he then asked.
"All right, it's still the same that you're coming tonight?" he wanted to know from his parents.
"Yes, I'm Draco's godfather and I agree with him, it's not going to happen Mr. Potter. We don't know what would happen to Draco."
"Does that surprise you? I can certainly make coffee."
"Why don't you eat in the hall?" asked Hermione, handing Ron another pot.
"Yeah, maybe he'll just let you write a few lines or something," Ginny said.
"I rather sank. It was all the gillyweed, if I hadn't pulled myself out of the water at the end by Dumbledore and Bagman, I would have drowned miserably. No one ever showed it to me," he tried to explain. Draco looked at him for a long moment, seeming to weigh up what to say. The fact that Harry had had a terrible childhood was hard for him to bear. He didn't want to believe it at first, didn't want to believe that the boy who had always seemed confident and strong to him had actually been a severely abused child.
"Shall we? I took the liberty of designing the room," he said and opened the door.
"Said the man who is off the chalk cliffs in Dover, virtually invisible," Severus countered.
"It's my fault, I don't know how it happened."
"Yes, but only when we're alone," Harry said playfully theatrically.
"Good for you, I have to go to 'Ancient Runes' with you when I should have finished my lessons," Harry countered, looking at Draco's timetable.
"D-Draco is right, what is that possibility?", Harry wanted to know quietly. Severus took a deep breath and looked at them both seriously.
"Although it will no longer matter, I give a thousand points each to Gryffindor and Slytherin for indescribable sacrifice," she said in a trembling voice. Harry had never seen the so tough tutor so fragile.
"Er, see you later," said a red-faced Hermione, pulling Ron outside with her.
"Interesting, I thought they hated each other," Severus said in surprise.
"I think so, what happened?"
"I'm afraid so."
"Blaise," Draco said impassively.
"Does it hurt?"
"Harry James Potter."
"For you," he said and Draco reached for the rings. He put one on Harry and he did the same to him.
"Yes, I know. I got you and Mr. Weasley off your feet, I couldn't have brought you all here inconspicuously any other way, and now follow me, but a warning, if you ever tell anyone about this, you're going to wish detention was the least of your problems, understand?" said Severus sternly, opening the secret door after all three students had nodded.
"Thank you ... I know he'll be fine," he said, turning and leaving the lonely graveyard in Godric's Hollow.
"I want at least you to be able to go on living without you-know-who getting their hands on you."
"I'm okay! Voldemort's gone and I'm still alive. He can stop worrying."
"Are you in pain, Mr. Zabini?" she wanted to know and quickly the Slytherin shook his head.
"The pain was too much," Madame Pomfrey said, putting a hand under Harry's neck and pouring him a potion. It took a few moments, but then Harry regained consciousness.
-------------------------------------------------------------
"In sickness and in health."
"You're right ..." she said softly.
"We have no choice Minerva."
"No one can see us here," he said explanatorily, Remus nodded and squeezed the other's hand tighter.
"Um ... where can I sleep?" he asked, looking around.
"It means that at the moment we don't know how to separate you and until we do, you two have to stay together. A soul bond is something very rare and we don't yet understand how it happened. But the most important thing right now is one thing, that none of the students realise how serious it really is," Severus said urgently.
"You do it," said the Gryffindor and his friend nodded. Together they walked up and down the wall three times and a door appeared. It was made of dark wood and Draco opened it smiling. Harry looked around the room in amazement. It was quite large, but somehow cosy. In the middle was a large four-poster bed made of dark wood. The walls were painted a soft grey and a fluffy carpet, also grey, lay in front of the bed. Two old-fashioned armchairs in Slytherin green stood in front of the burning fireplace. Posters of Quidditch teams hung on the walls and there was another door next to the bed.
"Um ... yes," Harry said, looking sheepishly at Draco.
"Well, instructions suits him," he said and handed Harry two vials. He took them and swallowed the medicine before they sat down and began to eat.
"Are you all right?" the werewolf wanted to know. The Potions Master nodded and with a motion of his head signified for Remus to follow him. They walked in silence until they had left the village behind them.
Outside the hospital wing, Severus took a deep breath. That was close, far too close. Now a much bigger problem had crossed his mind. Something they all hadn't considered and which could be more than dangerous for Harry and Draco too. He needed to talk to Narcissa and Lucius before he went to the Headmaster. With his cloak billowing, he turned and hurried out of the castle and towards Hogsmeade.
"How was it?" she wanted to know anxiously. Lucius sank into the armchair and poured himself a firewhiskey.
"Thank you," Remus said as the teacher handed him one.
"B-But Harry, why does this sound like goodbye?", Molly wanted to know quiveringly.
"Don't you dare use mine!" he said, then disappeared behind a door at the end of the corridor. Harry groaned. He took off his frock coat and then faltered. He really wasn't eager to see Snape's naked body. Especially as he didn't have pyjamas anyway. He was glad not to have to go to the toilet, that would come soon enough. Without further ado, he lay down on the couch in the clothes he was still wearing. It was far too small for his current height. It took him a while to find a position in which he could sleep. One thing struck him. He was not in pain. Otherwise his body usually ached, especially after the holidays, this got better and better throughout the year, but he was rarely without pain, but now he felt really good. He turned on his side and hoped fervently that he would not have any nightmares that night.
"I don't care, you're not attacking a classmate! The lesson is over for both of you. Sit down at the table and write two inches on unsaid spells!" he said and Harry and Draco did as they were told.
"What do you mean?", Harry wanted to know.
"Actually, no. Yesterday, that was ... I was overwhelmed and just wanted to get away and forget everything."
"H-he's really alive?", Draco wanted to know and Narcissa nodded with a smile.
"Are you all right?" he wanted to know, turning his head to Harry, who lay pale and also out of breath beside him.
"Don't worry darling, we'll find another solution. Do they know that?" asked Lucius.
"And us!" the twins shouted and now joined Ron and Hermione. One by one, more and more students stood protectively in front of Harry and Draco. The Slytherins were backing away more and more.
"Well ... I've sucked someone's dick before and he sucked mine," he said almost in a whisper.
"Uncle?", Harry wanted to know, still frighteningly calm.
"You are beautiful," he then said, gently caressing the other's chest.
"Good night, Severus," said Dumbledore and immediately the Potions Master had disappeared. The headmaster let himself sink back into his chair and looked at his phoenix, which eyed him with interest.
"Should have guessed the old man couldn't keep that to himself," Severus growled, throwing his bag onto one of the tables and sitting down. Remus took a chair and sat down opposite him.
"What's next?" Neville wanted to know in a whisper, but Harry raised his shoulders helplessly. They sat quietly in the grass for a little over ten minutes when there was a rustling sound and suddenly two unicorns stepped out onto the lawn. It was a mare with her foal. A murmur went through the class.
"Then let him sleep with you!"
"That's nice Ron, but Dumbledore has offered me and Draco to stay here at Hogwarts next summer too and there's plenty of time before then."
"You should eat a little more, boys," Narcissa Malfoy, watched Harry and Draco anxiously. They had had breakfast brought to their room. The room waiter had not looked bad when he brought breakfast for four for the two Malfoys, but after a princely tip, he had asked no questions.
"Well, I guess that's what I'm here for. But you would have done the same, I know that!" Draco said, thinking back to the Battle of Hogwarts, which was only a few weeks ago.
"YOU!" his aunt screamed, pointing her wand at the two boys. But before she could say anything, she was hit by a green light and fell to the ground like a felled tree, her eyes fixed on the sky. Draco looked up and saw his mother standing in front of him with her wand outstretched. Slowly she lowered it and now the last Death Eaters disappeared in panic. Narcissa and Lucius came to their senses and immediately knelt beside Draco, who was still lying over the unconscious Harry and sobbing.
"Where are they?", Albus then wanted to know.
"Good morning," Remus Lupin startled, rubbing his eyes. Severus was standing by the couch and holding a cup of coffee in front of him.
"I love you too!" he said and was immediately pulled into another kiss and for the first time since Voldemort's death, he felt truly free.
"Poppy? Mr Potter, I beg your pardon!" the healer said sternly. The next moment she put something on his face and immediately his vision cleared, though not entirely. Severus looked beside him and froze. In the bed beside him was himself. How could that be? He looked down at himself and ran a hand through his hair. Surely that wasn't his body.
"What's going on?", Minerva wanted to know. As briefly as he could, Severus summarised the events of the last few days. The Gryffindor tutor had to sit down and was visibly fighting tears.
"What are you doing?", Draco was there immediately and was about to pull him back down by the leg, but then he reconsidered, because he definitely didn't want to make a mistake right now.
"Th-that's not true..." he said eventually and Harry looked up.
"Madame Pomfrey I'm really fine!", Harry tried one last attempt to avert the examination.
"Strange, isn't it?" Harry wanted to know, now crawling onto the bed and leaning against the back wall. Draco also lay down and looked up at the ceiling.
"Harry, I didn't say anything ... I said..."
"D-Dray ... please ... stop," he groaned at some point and Draco looked up irritated.
"Don't do that Ron. It's really all right. It's not easy for him either," Harry said immediately.
"Are you all right?" he wanted to know.
"All right, where do you want it to take place?"
"But that means there's no way to redeem it, right?", Harry wanted to know.
"Th-that was a damn close one," Draco gasped.
"So, the boys are staying the night?" asked Remus at one point.
"I-I ... I have to die," he asked at some point, trembling. Remus, who in the meantime had also knelt down in front of the couch, nodded weakly.
"We don't know that."
"So what do we do now?" asked Draco then.
"I'll be all right," he said exhaustedly. Madame Pomfrey raised her wand in irritation and then looked around in amazement.
"Sev?" asked Harry with a grin.
"Yeah sure, so ... so you're going to do that? So the binding thing?"
"Did something happen?", Hermione wanted to know.
"U-until we die?" he wanted to know and Harry nodded.
"Go on, then. I'm turning around," Draco said unnervingly and closed the bathroom door. Harry nodded. He had no other choice. He quickly went to the bathroom and then undressed while Draco stood with his back to him, reading a book. The Slytherin's gaze went briefly to the mirror and he stared. He could see Harry's naked back before he put his shirt on, and it was covered in bruises, or had he just imagined it?
"I don't know, but I think you, so we need to see Dumbledore. He's not going to ignore a ... a suicide attempt like that, I don't think he's going to ignore it."
"Yes ... well ... so it looked really bad and Professor Snape told me to take your hand and immediately after that you stabilised."
"Why? That's right. Where is he anyway, has he already fucked off and where is Draco?"
"Yeah, me too," Draco said, kissing Harry gently.
"I know why," Harry said quietly. He couldn't see it clearly, but he sensed that Draco was looking at him.
"I'm sorry, I-I didn't mean to yell at you. I know that's what your father used to do. I'm sorry," Harry said abruptly, but didn't dare look up. Severus stared at him.
"It was nice there and peaceful, but ... no I don't think so. I have friends and it wouldn't have been fair to any of them if I had stayed. Sometimes it might really be easier to give up instead of fighting, but not today."
"Can we?" asked the potions master and the Malfoys nodded. It was not until they were in Lucius' study that they spoke again.
"I'll see you in a few hours," he said then and Lucius nodded knowingly.
"Mhm ... yes, that's true, but there's still the Room of Requirement," Ron interjected.
"Those scars, that's your past and not important anymore, okay?" asked Draco then. Hesitantly, Harry nodded and then stripped off his sweatpants. Draco looked deep into his eyes and then shed the last of his clothes, as did Harry. Then they stepped into the shower together. The warm water poured down on them and Harry had no idea what to do. He just stood there and stared at Draco.
"Come on Malfoy, you too," Neville dragged Draco to his feet and grabbed his upper arm, always making sure they stayed close to the half-giant. In the castle, the students were hurrying to their last lesson and again and again, horrified screams could be heard when they saw Harry in Hagrid's arms. He looked more dead than alive by now. Draco was hardly able to think of anything. All he could feel was Neville's grip on his arm and the burning feeling still behind his chest. As Hagrid entered the infirmary, Madame Pomfrey and Severus Snape, who had brought a student here, turned around.
"So now tell me, what's that between you and the werewolf?"
"W-what?" stuttered Pansy, stunned, and took a step backwards.
"You'll see," he said and led Remus along the lake to the large birch trees that stood not far from the Forbidden Forest. Between them was a dead trunk that almost looked like a bench. Severus sat down and tapped the wood beside him. Remus took a seat and immediately Severus reached for Remus' hand.
"O-Okay, they're really okay?"
"Yes, very ..."
"Yeah I'm fine," Harry said and let Draco take him to the bathroom.
"He's lying, he has that almost every night!"
"That thing you said on the tower, t-that we ... that you had feelings for me, was that true?" he then wanted to know, barely audibly. Draco smiled, leaned forward and bridged the last few inches. The first kiss between them, felt like electricity suddenly coursing through their veins. It was as if they had always been made for each other. It took a while before they broke away. Both had red cheeks and just looked at each other.
"What is Narcissa?" cried the lord.
"What do you always do at Uncle Sev's now, anyway, in the evenings?", Harry walked up to Draco and sat down on the brick parapet as well.
"Do I have to?"
"After all, Sirius' fathers were both Seekers. I'm surprised you didn't think of that," Remus tried to defend himself.
"Are you alright?" he wanted to know and Hermione nodded.
"Harry and Draco live ... lived here for a few days," he said explanatorily, putting the cloaks aside.
"By Merlin's flowered pants, that's ...", Ron began.
"I-I, so please stop talking. I-I am not Snape!" he said in a firm voice and Draco's level of confusion increased.
"Yeah, I'm fine, but I'm starting to get a backache from walking bent over," Draco said.
"Yes, it's curfew, no one will see us, but you should put some clothes on anyway, I'll wait outside the door," the teacher said curtly and walked out of the room.
"Don't worry, without the Lord they are like chickens without heads. They will flee faster than we can look," Severus said.
"What now?", Harry wanted to know and his voice broke.
"Ouch, it's alright. I don't begrudge you that," he said as Draco reached for his bag.
"Yes, probably, so how long .... so well ...?" asked Severus.
"Thank you," Harry said and hugged the young woman.
"So?", Draco looked at him questioningly.
"All right. Potter there and Malfoy on the other side," she said and Ron led Harry to the bed. Shortly afterwards he was in a terrible state. His chest was burning, every bone ached. He gasped and felt like he was tearing up inside.
"What's that?" he said loudly. Remus stepped up to him and pulled Severus/Harry's hand towards him. His body suddenly tingled and he quickly withdrew his hand.
"Deny it and play it down. It's not fatal and they are as good as separated, but if everything goes wrong then ..."
"So what?"
"Yes, I see ... um ... can I ask you something else for a moment?" Remus wanted to know and Severus, who was dressed by now, sat down on the bed again.
"So how are you?", Severus now wanted to know. Draco looked at Harry, who nodded barely perceptibly.
"I'm sorry," was all he said as he stood before them.
"I have no secrets from you," Draco said quickly, but his friend waved it off.
"Yes, I think that makes sense," Severus said.
"It's Merry Christmas Grandpa," he said, kissing the boy on the forehead and setting him down.
"We're coming," Remus said, pulling Harry to his feet.
"It's not Remus, he likes you, face it," Draco said, smiling sadly.
"Is everything really all right?" he wanted to know. Harry looked at him and nodded.
"Now listen carefully Potter. Firstly, we don't know if it will really do any good if you sacrifice yourself, because I might be dead too. Yesterday the burning lasted longer and was more painful than the day before. Secondly, we're not going to screw up our lives. Otherwise we'll just do this bonding thing and then..."
"Am I crazy or is there something going on between them?" blurted out Blaise when they were alone. Draco and Harry grinned at each other.
"I have no idea what he means..."
"That was unexpected, but congratulations," McGonagall said, smiling wanly.
"Damn complicated this potion," he muttered more to himself than to Harry. Harry looked at his book and couldn't help but agree with Malfoy. There wasn't a line where the half-blood prince hadn't left a note, but how was he going to explain that to Malfoy? Harry decided to keep it to himself. He wouldn't risk the book because of a potion, because Malfoy would definitely betray him.
"It just never gets boring and it's the most beautiful one I know," Harry said with a smile and kissed the other gently. Together they stepped onto the terrace of the house and looked at the children, who were now sitting in the sand and building a castle. The sea was roaring and the waves were crashing against the rocks. The call of the seagulls, mingled with the laughter of Sirius and Lily. The sun bathed everything in a warm, surreal light.
"C-Cissa?"
"And the lord would condone this," Lucius concluded.
"It tastes good," he said.
"How do you know?" he wanted to know. Remus laughed.
"Thank you, then, for doing so much for us," Harry said then hesitantly. Severus took a step towards him and forced himself to smile. He reached out and put a hand on Harry's shoulder.
"Don't worry about it. I am happy for you, so and now we have to go," the teacher said, stood up and went to the door.
"No, it wasn't. The bond of ours has always been there, I know it, and I would have died too if you were, whether I knew it or not," he said, stroking Harry's cheek gently.
"Good morning, Professor I just ... I just wanted to know how Draco and Harry were doing."
"A-And now?" he then wanted to know.
"Er...
"It's all right, I'm used to it. So do you have pyjama parties here often, or why the mattress?" asked Harry.
"Why didn't you ever say anything? We would have helped you," Hermione said tremulously.
"Um...will it go away?" the latter wanted to know and scratched his head.
"I've never been more sure," he said and Draco nodded, blindly reaching beside him for the jar of oil again. Carefully he wet his erection with it and had to pull himself together hard not to come immediately.
"POTTER, MALFOY! DETENTION!" he shouted and the two young men lowered their wands.
"Because what?"
"Oh yeah sure, everything's okay Neville," Harry said and fed the last piece of the meat.
"Well Potter, all packed!" he said as he stood in front of the two.
"Is that so? Okay, well we were never the best of friends, but I ... I've kind of grown to like you," Draco said and grinned, albeit sheepishly. Harry didn't really know what to say. He had liked Draco for a while, more than he should have, but telling him was something else.
"Hey ...", he said, visibly embarrassed, and immediately found himself pressed against the sobbing Narcissa's chest.
Severus Snape was just entering the Entrance Hall when he spotted Hermione, Ron and Blaise from a distance in front of the Great Hall. It couldn't have gone any better. He looked around quickly, then drew his wand and muttered two quick spells that knocked first Ron and then Blaise off their feet.
"No, he's at breakfast!"
"I know, but tell me, do you care a little about him after all these years?", Snape turned and glared angrily at the man.
"Don't worry, we know that and we won't tell anyone," Ron said.
"Well I too have done a lot of research and what Draco told you is the truth. We still don't know what exactly the potion did. Perhaps your soul bond was always there and the potion merely 'activated' it," Severus explained.
"I'm not going to the Gryffindors!" said Draco immediately.
"Go on, take your shower, I'm not looking either," he mumbled with the toothbrush in his mouth. Harry wasn't sure if he should do that, but he couldn't very well run around for days now without washing. He glanced quickly once more at Draco, who was meanwhile tying his tie and looking towards the door. Sighing, he got rid of his clothes and jumped into the shower, enjoying the warm water on his battered skin. He hurried and dressed quickly before Malfoy changed his mind. When they came out of the bathroom together, Blaise was already sitting on the bed, dressed.
"Yeah, maybe, look here comes Blaise," Hermione said, pointing her head down the corridor. Blaise came sauntering towards them alone.
"I'll be right back," he said and left the room.
"You need not be afraid, nothing will happen to you. You will be taken to the dungeons and from there to secret passages. Those of you who are of age are free to stay here and fight."
"He always is."
"And this war will end and then I can go home, I firmly believe that," Draco said and kissed Harry again.
"Why? Then you'd be rid of me," Harry said, and it seemed less defiant than deeply sincere.
"W-when ...?" the latter asked, sobbing.
"Oh ... a-a Umbridge," Draco said, slightly embarrassed.
"No, not ... not if we stay together," Harry said as casually as possible.
"And you were already worried that they wouldn't be pleased," he said. Harry smiled and kissed Draco on the cheek.
"Protecting him with our lives. Harry was all we had left of James and Lily, of people who were our family to us. We were family because neither I, Sirius, Lily or James had parents anymore. When Harry was born, we swore to protect him and ... and I just don't know how to deal with the fact that I have to break my promise ...", Remus said and broke off. Now he couldn't stop tears from running down his cheeks again. Severus immediately pulled him into his arms.
"Oh yeah right...", Harry stuttered and let go of the other's hand. Draco led the way while Harry didn't move. Halfway there, Draco turned around.
"Impressed?" asked Harry in a whisper.
"There is a small bay behind the rocks where the water is very calm. I think I'm quite a good teacher," Draco said and laughed.
"Already but the Lord knows that I am a spy in the Order, so no one will suspect anything."
"Nothing just ... about this afternoon in class..."
Harry and Draco continued walking towards the Forbidden Forest. Near Hagrid's hut, Dumbledore stood and came towards them.
"They don't know yet, do they?", Narcissa wanted to know.
"Is that really okay, Dad?" asked Harry uncertainly.
"Poppy, the pains are getting worse. If they don't have skin contact, then they are always felt," Severus explained briefly. The medi-witch nodded, stepped over to Harry and Draco and let her wand wander over them.
"I AM NOT A HERO!" shouted Harry suddenly, clenching his fists.
"MUM! DAD!" cried Draco immediately, throwing himself into his parents' arms. It seemed as if everything he had been pushing away for the last few days suddenly came crashing down on the Slytherin. He cried and his mother hugged him tightly while his father kept stroking his head.
"Thank you Salazar, I'll be right there. These are your friends," he said, addressing Draco and Harry. The two young men nodded gloomily.
"Why didn't you ever say anything?"
"No, so it wasn't planned. I just c-couldn't shock him," Harry said quietly and now followed his friends towards the Great Hall for dinner.
"Don't worry, I'm sure he won't rip your head off," Draco tried to reassure him.
"It's all right Madame Pomfrey," Draco said, moving a little away from Harry so that the medi-witch could exaMione him.
"The night the Lord tried to kill you, when your mother threw her own life between him and you like a shield, that night the death curse rebounded on the Lord and a fragment of his soul was blasted from the whole and clung to the only living soul left in that collapsing building. A part of him lives in you, Harry, and this gives you the power to speak with snakes, and to make a connection with the Lord's mind that he himself never comprehended. And as long as this fragment of his soul, which is not missed by him, is linked to you and is virtually protected by you, the Lord cannot die," he concluded and Harry just stared at him. Very slowly, Draco shook his head, tears coming to his eyes, while his friend stood as if in shock.
"Nothing!" said Harry, backing away, but Draco followed him.
"You saw it, Fawkes, didn't you?" Albus looked thoughtfully at his faithful phoenix. He tilted his head and trilled softly.
"Breakfast," Severus said curtly.
"Were?" Harry now wanted to know.
"Well Mr. Malfoy, that honours you very much, but you also know that it won't go that easily," Dumbledore interjected.
"They're bloody sharp. When they want to, they attack and can inflict some pretty nasty wounds," Harry explained further.
"What is it?"
"A-are you engaged?" she wanted to know.
"Well..." said Draco dejectedly, but he couldn't suppress a smile for long.
"We slowly should all go to sleep," Severus said at one point, looking at the yawning students.
"What about the Death Eaters?", Harry wanted to know.
"Ew...that's worse than Polyjuice Potion!"
"Which Ravenclaws?" asked Harry with a smile, and immediately Ron, Hermione and Blaise turned around, but instead of the two students, Narcissa and Lucius Malfoy were now standing next to Snape and Remus.
"By Merlin!" gasped Draco.
"What do you mean?"
"Nothing out of the ordinary, but he's getting weaker. The Horcruxes are nearly all destroyed and he's seething with rage."
"I don't know, but I would definitely have liked it!"
"You should be getting ready. Classes will start any moment and if I'm informed correctly, you have to go to herbology," he said and reached for some books.
"Draco...er...Draco teach me," the latter said quickly.
"The first time I held you, your parents had just died and all I ever wanted to do was protect you. Yes, you were special and I was fascinated and too often I forgot that you were just a child looking for a place in life. You, uh... you have to believe that I was looking for a solution when I found out and maybe I should have said it earlier, but then..."
"Hey, are you waiting for me?" he wanted to know, stopping in front of the two Gryffindors.
"Yesterday I was almost dead and Draco had nothing, so the odds are pretty good after all."
"See you boys and take care of yourselves," said the Malfoy, hoping that Voldemort would not call for him that night of all nights.
"Th-thank you, Professor," he said, smiling wanly.
"Okay, I can see that, but with who? Wait, you don't mean Lupin?" Draco looked at his friend in surprise.
"How is Harry?", Lucius wanted to know.
"Stop Draco! Of course we'll look after them. They're my grandchildren, what a question," Severus indignantly hugged Lily to him.
"I'm sorry," Harry said then, not daring to look up. Lucius stepped up to him and put a finger under his chin so that he looked at him.
"I liked it better when he didn't care about me," he said.
"We're glad too and Blaise is right, we'll always be here for you as long as we can," Hermione said, hugging them both as well, while Ron nodded.
"Yes, so the illusion seems to work," the girl said with a grin.
"KILLED YOU?" now Draco screamed and knelt on the bed. Tears of anger and despair in his eyes. Harry stared at him, completely stunned.
"Why didn't you ever do it?" asked Harry, wiping away his tears. Snape looked at him questioningly.
"Any news of Snape or Slughorn?" asked Ron, putting in the last plant. Harry shook his head.
"You can say that again," Harry said, dropping into a chair beside Draco.
"W-what...what is this. Who are you?" he asked in panic.
"I'll get the boys before panic sets in here. I don't think it will take the Lord long to get here. Go and round up the Order, we need to do everything we can to protect the school, Harry and Draco for as long as possible," Severus said, reaching for his cloak and wand. Remus nodded and took his jacket.
"It's nice to meet you," Narcissa said in a brittle voice.
"Yes, Hermione and Ron should know too. Do you think Severus would allow it."
"How long have you known us now?" asked Ron with a smile.
"Sir, I-I have a request," Harry said hesitantly. Snape narrowed his eyes, but said nothing in reply.
"All right, be that as it may. We don't know yet whether it would work at all. I'm worried for an entirely different reason. If the Lord finds out, then ...", Severus began and Lucius understood immediately.
"Hey, come to Grandpa Severus, Lily!", Severus took Lily in his arms again and strutted towards the dining room.
"He teaches me occlumency again and teaches me how to empty my mind in the evening so that I don't have nightmares anymore," he explained.
"Mhm ... all right. What about Ron, Hermione and Blaise?", Remus wanted to know.
"Yes," Harry said, letting go of Draco's hand and turning onto his side. The Slytherin suppressed a disappointed sigh as the warmth of the hand left him and closed his eyes.
"Yes, we darling, but don't show yourselves until we are inside."
"He ... he looked really good and younger and he asked me for something. I ... I'm supposed to tell you that he's happy for you both and that you should be happy, that's what he wants ...", Remus eyes filled with tears.
"W-what ... no ... Harry," the Gryffindor felt his friend's hand on his back and he turned to look into the other's moist eyes.
"It's OK, Dad, we all don't want that. Thanks! I love you guys, see you in three days," Harry said and kissed his fathers cheek.
"Yes, but in this case, yes ... please."
"What's going on here?", Hagrid came running up and stared at Harry.
"I love you too ... more than you can imagine," Harry said and Draco smiled gently.
"I don't know. That's for them to decide. What about you? Will you stay for now?"
"I don't know. Not so great, but not really bad either. I'm sorry," Draco then said contritely and Harry looked at him in irritation.
"Tell me, is there something going on between Remus and Severus?" asked Draco abruptly.
"Yes, thank you," Draco said and the woman nodded before letting them continue. At the edge of the courtyard, Hagrid stood and sniffled audibly.
"Yes, he always thinks he's doing the right thing, he's doing it for a greater good and even though I believe he regrets it, I don't think he's trying to see the situation through the boys' eyes," Severus said and now sat down too.
"I guess, but you were rarely in on these pranks, or am I mistaken?"
"No, it's not ..."
"What, embarrassed? Honey, no one will ever read this, it's just for us," Draco said, bending down and kissing Harry gently.
"Yes, I'm afraid that just makes it all the worse," Dumbledore said with a sigh, sinking back into his chair.
"But ... but that's great, then you can kill him now, can't you?" Severus now looked at Remus, who was visibly struggling to keep his composure.
"All right, so if you really want it, I'll talk to Albus," said the Potions Master.
"Hey, take it easy, okay?" he said, stroking his friend's chest. Slowly, Harry began to relax and enjoyed his closeness to Draco more and more. Carefully he touched him now too and the Slytherin pressed close to him. Gently, he stroked Harry's back and felt him slowly let himself fall.
"I don't know if I can manage it all," Draco sighed, casting a sideways glance at Harry.
"Mum? Dad?" Draco murmured and the two turned around.
Harry went into the bathroom. He was alone here at this time of night and that was just fine with him. He took off his shirt and groaned slightly. His shoulder still hurt like hell and he was glad that Quidditch selection wouldn't be for another two weeks. His upper body was covered with slow-healing wounds and scars. He quickly showered and pulled on his shirt and sleeping pants. He slipped under his covers and closed the curtains of the four-poster bed. Slowly he lay down and felt the stabbing pain in his back. He turned onto his left side, the only position in which he could lie reasonably pain-free. Then cast another silence spell and sank into a sleep dominated by nightmares.
"W-who knows about this?", Narcissa wanted to know quiveringly.
"Um...yes and we have a question for you."
They celebrated until the early morning. Dumbledore didn't miss out either and took turns dancing with Narcissa and Hermione. They laughed a lot and when Severus and Remus revealed their relationship to each other, the cheers were real and big.
"Don't worry Harry, I will take over Severus' lessons and we will tell the students that Professor Snape is ill and needs to recuperate. So I would ask you to spend this week in Professor Snape's rooms," Dumbledore said seriously.
"By Merlin, it's been a long time since we sat here," Lucius said with a smile and his wife nodded.
"From the marauders? Yes, it was."
"Why your fault?"
"More of a distraction," Draco interjected, putting an arm around Harry's waist.
"They saved you," Draco said and Harry nodded.
"Yes, I understand that," Harry said bitterly.
"What do you mean?" asked Harry, feeling Draco let go of him now that they were outside on their way to the greenhouses. He was almost missing contact with the other.
"Really? That would be ... that would be great," Harry said and Draco nodded as well.
"Yes, but we haven't asked yet," he said.
"It won't be so bad," Hermione tried to cheer him up.
"Them!" said Lucius.
"None of your business Malfoy!"
"You loved him very much, didn't you?" the compassion in the teacher's voice made Remus look up.
"Yes, Harry, I suppose that's one way to put it. We must remain vigilant and prevent such fanaticism from ever arising again, for I have had to learn before ... where such things lead, but for now, peace is restored. I see you have already received some presents," Albus said, looking at the dessert, which was overflowing with cards, flowers and sweets.
"What are his parents doing here?", Hermione wanted to know when they reached the hall.
"Is it gone now?"
"Yes, more or less. However, the lord only gets information from me that is not really decisive for the war."
"We can do homework in the common room," Draco said.
"So I'm ... we're dead, but where's Draco?"
"Sev, I ..."
"The great Harry Potter, the boy who lived, does the honours. Very brave of you and not alone I see. Lucius, your son has turned him over to us," Voldemort sneered and looked at Lucius Malfoy, who stood pale and unmoving beside the equally frozen Narcissa.
"Um ... quite okay, I think," Harry said and sat up. The pain had almost disappeared, he only felt weak. Draco was sitting in bed next to him, looking at him with the same concern as the healer.
"Is it not Potter. You share this bed after all," Snape said, calling up a potion.
"We'd need your cloak of invisibility," Severus said, looking at Harry, who nodded wanly, bent down for his bag and pulled out the magical piece of cloth. Surprised, Severus looked at him.
"BACK!" screamed Madame Pomfrey, but Draco could hardly move. Severus immediately grabbed him by the arm and literally threw him onto the bed next to Harry.
"Yes, I did and I told you that as soon as I turned seventeen I was leaving there," Harry said angrily.
At breakfast, Harry sat at the Slytherin table again. He was not in the mood to argue with Draco and so he just waved at Ron and Hermione again. After all, they would see each other in class.
"Bullshit, by Salazar ... Yes, we've never been good friends, more like enemies, but I ... I don't want you dead. What I did today was stupid and reckless. I was only thinking of myself and I'm sorry, Harry ... I really am," Draco turned his head to the other. Harry turned to him and squeezed the hand that held his tighter for a moment.
"How ... how about we take a shower first? The bathroom should be behind the door," he said.
"They're already asleep?", Lucius wanted to know in a whisper.
"That Snape's beating you up like that," Draco said.
"No, nothing. Snape says they're under surveillance, bullshit if you ask me."
"Um ... yes, Sirius left me the Black house, but ... I can't live there ... it ...", Harry faltered, trying to fight down the tears that were now falling non-stop. Draco bit his lips, it was tearing him apart to see Harry like this.
"Wait, your aunt is dead, but ..."
"I didn't mean to interrupt, but the alarm spell kicked in and ..."
"I'm ... I'm sorry," he said haltingly.
"Go on Potter!" he said annoyed.
"I'll try," he said. Remus broke away from him and wiped a tear from the corner of his eye.
"Hey, we'll do it," he said, kissing the Gryffindor gently. The latter now nodded and let Draco pull him to his feet. Despite their holding hands, they both felt the slight pain. To move even half a metre away from each other was almost impossible. Outside the door, Severus waited for them and nodded.
"I'll go to sleep then," Harry said after a while and gathered his things.
"I don't know. There were more important things and ... I don't know. You know, we were going to take you in after the war and start a family. When he died, it was just too hard for me to say something, because you had lost him too," Harry nodded.
"Honestly, you want it anyway," Blaise said with a grin.
"We'll manage. I'll talk to Severus, he'll somehow be able to get us into the castle unseen," Lucius said and put a reassuring hand on his wife's arm.
"All right, the question is whether they want to," Lucius interjected.
They walked on and soon they heard voices that seemed to come from a nearby clearing. Harry looked at Draco, who swallowed hard, gripped his husband's hand tighter and then nodded. They stepped out of the shadows of the trees into the spacious clearing and Harry felt for a moment as if his forehead would explode. He gasped but managed to stay on his feet. A dozen Death Eaters stood there staring at them and in the middle - Voldemort. The dark lord looked stricken, but grinned derisively when he spotted the young Gryffindor.
"How are you?" Narcissa wanted to know and now sat down with her husband in one of the armchairs that stood in the room. Draco shrugged his shoulders helplessly.
"Good morning, Professor Snape," said Madame Pomfrey.
"Yes, it is and you know we would flee with you in a heartbeat if it ..."
"What's the right name, Sirius?" he asked sternly, and the four-year-old seemed to really think.
"Nothing, nothing ... just that you're right," said his best friend, looking slightly embarrassed, which was not lost on Harry.
"No, truly not and I can say that I am very happy about it," said the teacher.
"No, but let's go," he said and took Harry's hand. They entered the forest and it was almost as if every sound was swallowed up here. No more birds could be heard, no more rustling of leaves, only silence. Although it was still broad daylight, almost no sunlight reached the ground.
"Cissa, I know and it tears me up too. I would give my life for Draco and also for Harry, but it wouldn't do any good. I don't know where we go from here, but ... but we must at least give them the last few days... weeks whatever as nice and pleasant as possible. It sounds cruel now, and it is, but it's all we can do," Severus concluded, lowering his eyes. He felt Narcissa's trembling hand on his cheek and looked up again.
"Not yet!" the teacher said cynically and helped him up. Harry felt his body and breathed a sigh of relief.
"Granger, Weasley and Zabini, no duels in the corridors, that meant detention. In an hour outside the potions classroom and you'd better be on time," Snape said, glaring angrily at the three.
"Listen carefully Potter, it may be that you think you're a hero or whatever, but this..." he pointed to the scar again. "...This is not something you can keep to yourself. This is torture and it's forbidden! Umbridge must be held accountable for this!"
"Dray," Blaise said uncomprehendingly.
"We just don't feel like being stared at all the time," Harry quickly dismissed the subject.
"So if I remember correctly, you already have some experience," Blaise said with a smile.
"Yes, just like his taste. Hello you two," Narcissa said and hugged Severus and Harry.
"It'll be alright. Snape will find something, his ego won't stand it otherwise," said the Weasley with a grin.
"Potter, now don't make such a fuss!", Snape snapped, and Harry winced. Suddenly he felt terribly alone, even Draco didn't dare look at him. Furious now, he took off his jumper, stripped off his shirt and tried just not to be here. Madame Pomfrey looked at Severus, who now stepped a little closer. The old wounds and scars looked much worse in the bright light than they had last night. They stretched from his back across his chest to his stomach. The upper arms were also affected. Some of the wounds had barely healed. Add to that the fact that the young man was really skinny, although you could see obvious muscle from the Quidditch training, Harry Potter was a prime example of an abused and neglected child. Draco looked doggedly in another direction, but he could feel Harry's trembling despite himself. Everything in him screamed for them to stop, for them to leave Harry alone, but he couldn't move to protect him.
Draco woke up to a noise that he couldn't quite place. He rubbed his eyes and looked at the floor. Harry was shaking all over, he could see that even in a few lights. The Gryffindor's teeth were chattering. Draco took a deep breath. He couldn't go on like this, after all, he didn't want to be to blame if Harry froze to death.
"What do you mean? But the curse..."
"Yes, that's it. Let's go then," said the werewolf.
"You did well," Draco said with a smile as they stood outside the office again.
"Harry, come on wake up!" he pleaded as Severus was already standing in the room.
"Oh, oh, that won't do him any good. Unprepared Apparating is..." said Severus.
"We're here!" the shout made everyone whirl around. In the doorway to the Great Hall, Draco and Harry stood hand in hand. They came closer and now stood in the middle of the huge hall, surrounded by teachers and students.
"Mmm...that's good," Draco said. Harry looked at him from the side, his stomach tingling.
"Hey, don't be embarrassed. Was there something?"
"Shoes off!" the young man who had been running behind the child now shouted after him.
"They are two lives, Headmaster. If you're already condemning them to death, then don't forget that," Severus said and stood up.
"I've ordered wine before, you like the semi-dry, don't you?"
"We'll have to deal with that later. There's a bigger problem," Severus began, recounting the day's events. Narcissa sat down on the couch, pale, and looked at her husband, who looked similarly upset.
"We'll be by your side as long as we can, and I'm really happy for you, so about the engagement," he said.
"Don't worry about him. He's okay, or we would have heard something by now," Ron said quietly.
"Dumbledore wants the Order members around, he thinks ..." the man said quietly.
"We ... we are engaged," Draco said at some point and smiled when he saw the surprised faces of his parents.
"I don't know, I know how I feel and so do you, but you're right, it's a big step," Draco said and lay back on his side, hugging Harry to him.
When the teachers came back to the Great Hall, all the tables had disappeared. The students stood around in small groups or sat on the stone floor. Molly Weasley came rushing towards Severus Snape, followed by Hermione, Ron, Bill, Ginny and the twins.
"Harry I'm sorry, I really am. You have to believe me, please. I wanted to ... I don't know. I was just scared for you and ... when I showed Severus, I felt it was right, but now..."
"Harry!" cried Draco, gasping, and immediately reached for the other's hand. The Gryffindor was unconscious and his eyelids fluttered.
"What's that?", Harry wheeled around. Dracos was standing in front of him with a towel around his hips. Immediately the Gryffindor pulled his shirt back on.
"Harry, look at me," Severus said when they were alone, but the Gryffindor shook his head.
"Well, everything settled?" he asked, putting his book on the page.
"You think you always have to do everything alone because you've always been alone, but you haven't been for a long time. Sirius didn't die because of you, he died for you and for the wizarding world. Do you think he would want you to just throw your life away now? Besides, it's not just your choice. Judging by the pain I was in earlier, I'm sure I'd die too if you died, so we might as well do it together!" said Draco firmly, yet with knees as soft as they'd ever been. He meant every word, but he only wanted one thing, for Harry to get off the wall.
"Did he?"
"Me? But ... But this is the place Draco described to me. The sea, the seagulls and ... our children ...", Harry faltered and looked past Sirius into the distance. Children's laughter sounded against his ear. He couldn't quite make them out, but in the distance, two children were running across the sand, laughing.
When they came out of the bathroom half an hour later, there was breakfast on the table in the kitchen. It was late morning by now and Snape was in class, but there was a note on the table: "You stay in this rooms. Do your homework and eat, that's all. Harry, take the potions! I'll come around 5pm and we'll talk then! - Severus," Draco read out and rolled his eyes.
"Mione, don't do that. Are you feeling sorry for Peeves now? He's already caused us a lot of trouble!", Ron interjected.
"You're really all right Harry and Draco couldn't have found anyone better anyway, me at the most," he said and now hugged the Gryffindor too.
"Yes, because this boy could become my son's soul mate and I want, no I demand, that you at least try to treat him as if you care," Lucius said insistently. Severus remained silent and turned. He walked down the stairs and then turned to Lucius once more.
"What was that all about?" asked Ron, getting to his feet with a groan.
"Um ... sit down, please," he said, pointing to the couch. Hesitantly, the three followed while Harry sat down in one of the armchairs and Draco sat on the back of it and took Harry's hand in his. Immediately Hermione's gaze lingered on the hands.
"No Mum, I'm staying here! Harry is like my brother, I ...", the fifteen-year-old pleaded.
"I know, but just because of that ... you would want to stay with me and ..."
"What else can you remember?" he wanted to know.
"Mhm ... the Malfoys are a very, very old magic family. Pure blood was always important to them. My father, however, always saw it differently. He was, or is, of the opinion that if we relied only on pure blood, there would soon be hardly any wizards and witches left. He could not express this in his family. That he joined the Dark Lord was sort of taken for granted. And then he met my mum, at Hogwarts. The Blacks were also a very old family, and their connection was more or less preordained, but they really loved and love each other. Mum has the views of the Blacks, just like .... like Sirius and Andromeda always despised, but unlike Sirius and her sister, she complied to do something in secret. Especially because ..."
"Hey, don't feel bad about it. I ... it was my fault and now it doesn't matter anyway. It sounds awful, but let's enjoy the time we have left and not think about the past, all right?", Harry swallowed hard, but then nodded.
"Yes, thank you. You too," said Draco.
"Fine I'll sort it out with Severus," Lucius said and stood up.
"Sorry for what?"
"What's wrong?" he wanted to know.
"Yes, we do," Draco said in a firm voice.
"Why are you used to sleeping on the floor?", Blaise wanted to know.
"Yeah, really really nice," Blaise said, patting Draco on the shoulder.
"I don't know, but maybe Sev ... er, Snape wants to bring the up to date," Harry said. They sat down at the Gryffindor table and Ron leaned towards his best friend.
"Thank you Madame Pomfrey and I'm really sorry."
"Does that mean that if one dies, the other dies too?"
"You could get married after all, by the way," Severus then said.
"We should at least celebrate a little," Severus said, raising his wand and already music was playing and a small buffet appeared.
"Of course, you're family now!" said Draco automatically.
"They love each other, don't they? Why wouldn't they want to?" asked Narcissa.
"I'll be back soon. I'm bringing Harry and Draco back here, so ... not that I mind, but maybe you'll put some clothes on," he said with a grin.
"But that's not because of my technique, it's because the wolf doesn't like it," Remus defended himself.
"Good, then go. I will also cast protective spells. We will not let this place of peace be taken from us," the Headmaster said. Severus looked at Minerva, who nodded and followed the teacher outside.
"But don't worry about it. It's all right," it was true, he had actually slept quite well next to Draco and without nightmares for the first time in a long time.
"All right, so when?"
"Yes, and I might be dead too."
"I am, and will be to the end, your loving husband," the two concluded their vows together.
"You were unconscious for four days. I thought I had lost you," Draco said in a trembling voice. Harry reached out and stroked his husband's cheek.
"Don't worry Weasley, you'll learn what illusion spells are," he said, then broke away from the others and walked to his parents with Harry holding his hand.
"I will catch you if you fall."
"What? It's true, you need to sleep again."
"You don't really want to do that Albus? You don't really want to send them to their deaths?"
"Thank you, were you serious? So, that you would stay here?"
"Ginny, please go, okay. I couldn't bear it if anything happened to you," Harry said now, smiling sadly.
"He's dreaming," Draco said quickly as his uncle stepped up to the bed and now also made an effort to wake the young man.
"No, I just wanted to tell you that I'm glad you're here," Severus said, lifting his head to pull Remus back into a deep kiss.
"I'm fine," said the latter.
"Everything is back to normal, just a little overstimulated nerves and just the slight burns," she said. Draco looked at Blaise with a shrug and wanted to go back to his bed, but no sooner had he moved away from Harry than the pain started again. Harry cried out and it was Blaise who immediately understood what was happening. He grabbed the completely frozen Draco by the shoulder and pushed him back to Harry's bed. Again, the pain subsided instantly and Harry lay in bed, breathing heavily.
"I'll show you!" he finally said. Harry looked at him in surprise.
"Yes, all right. See you tonight," said Snape and was gone in a moment.
"Everything ... everything that has happened in the last few years, how I have treated you."
"You haven't done it yet?"
"Okay, that was to be expected, what do we do now?" asked Harry.
"Are they here too?", Harry wanted to know tremulously. Sirius shook his head sadly.
"Don't leave them alone, please," she said and the man nodded weakly before the Malfoys disappeared. Sighing, Severus lowered himself onto one of the two chairs. He had to collect himself, even if it seemed hopeless.
"Yes, you too Weasley," he said. Ron nodded and put a hand around Hermione's waist.
"They are fine, but they are in the hospital wing. You can come to them, but only you and preferably now," Severus said urgently.
"Not better, but not much worse. However, without skin contact the pain is so strong that we can hardly ignore it anymore," the Slytherin said and Severus nodded with a sigh.
So they walked through the school. Most of the students were already in their houses so close to curfew. So they were very quickly on the estates and on their way to Hogsmeade.
"I'll wait for you downstairs," Severus said in a whisper to Harry. He nodded and the teacher had already disappeared. Narcissa looked up and spotted the young Gryffindor now, still standing indecisively by the door, the cloak of invisibility at his feet. The woman pressed Draco into her husband's arms, then walked towards Harry. Smiling sadly, she reached out to him. Harry was surprised for a moment, then he followed the invitation and was immediately pulled into an embrace as well.
"M-Must it be," Harry wanted to know, not putting much stock in the pain that followed.
"Yes and it's hard for me to say this as you are both still very young, but I see little possibility as far as separation is concerned. Draco I've been to see your parents, they know and they give you ... ...give you their blessing," Severus explained calmly.
"What is it?" the young woman wanted to know.
"Yes, but ..."
"Yes, thank you and if you want you can go and see Mum. She would be pleased to be able to spoil the two of them again," Draco said and pulled Harry close to him.
"Yes, he is in his mansion. No one is here," Narcissa now said, visibly worried.
"D-do I get to go back to my dorm?", Harry wanted to know hesitantly.
"Why not? It's better if we don't ruin both our lives," he said quietly.
"What?"
"Yes Dad, if it was a solution, but it's not," Draco said.
"Not here, but in another equally beautiful place."
"Itâ€™s right, isn't it? Didn't you have to hold hands too?" said Pansy with a grin. Almost simultaneously, Draco and Harry pointed their wands at the Slytherin, who immediately flew through the air and was just caught by Snape.
"Have a nice evening then," said the director.
"I realised something right there..." he said and without warning Harry felt Draco's soft lips on his. They tasted slightly salty and were the best thing he had ever tasted. All too quickly, Draco broke the kiss again.
"Y-yes," Draco said haltingly and the potions master nodded. He reached for the cloak and threw it over the boys.
"Sit down and be quiet," Hagrid said and hesitantly the students lowered themselves into the soft grass.
"Do you want something to eat?" he then asked Draco. Draco sat next to Harry on the bed and held his hand. Barely perceptibly, he shook his head.
"What do you mean?" the potions master now wanted to know and his stomach contracted painfully.
"Try to relax," he whispered and gently pushed in with one finger. Harry gasped, the feeling was strange at first but not really unpleasant, only when Draco added a second finger did it start to hurt a little.
"Y-you knew about this?"
"Not so far," Lucius said and Narcissa sighed with relief.
"Shut up Zabini!" said Draco, patting his best friend on the upper arm.
"Strange, isn't it?" asked Harry.
"Yes I know, but it can't. I'm sorry," Severus said.
"I don't know, but we should tell Severus. Come!"
"I put him to sleep. Calmed his mind," Snape explained.
"That's very good, isn't it? But I have the feeling that you asked us here for another reason," Lucius said, clearly sensing how tense Severus was. The latter now nodded wanly.
"I'm definitely trying and I don't think it hurts, or did you feel .... well, that Cedric was in pain?", Harry swallowed hard and then shook his head.
Remus Lupin had his hands buried in his coat pockets. Summer was slowly saying goodbye and already autumn could be felt approaching. The streets he walked through were empty despite the morning. The place lay quiet and seemed peaceful, even if the times were anything but peaceful. The old iron gate squeaked as he stepped through and now stood in the small cemetery. He looked around, but again he was apparently the only one. Remus walked along the narrow path with graves lined up on either side. Almost at the end he found the grave with the light-coloured headstone. Sighing, he made a lily appear and laid it down.
"Did I do something wrong?" the Gryffindor wanted to know, but Draco shook his head.
"What is it?" his friend wanted to know.
"Um ... Dad mentioned the word once, but I have no idea what it is," Draco said.
"That's behind us, okay? I don't want to think about it any more, just here and now," Harry said and Severus nodded.
"Incredible," the three students wheeled around and in front of them stood Harry and Draco, looking at the room with equal fascination.
"Blaise? Blaise Zabini is gay?"
"I know how bad you are by now and we can't wait any longer," the teacher said seriously.
"No Harry, let's wait and see, we're not going to rush things now," Severus said energetically and picked up the cloak of invisibility. Draco pulled Harry to his feet.
Harry blinked and felt Draco's arm around his waist. He smiled until he remembered why they were lying here together. Immediately his stomach tightened and his heart beat painfully against his chest. Suddenly he felt Draco's lips on his neck.
"Yes, and even then it's not certain that Draco won't die too."
"I know ... I know how hard this is, I'm no different with Draco, but if we despair now, so do the boys and is that what you want?" he then asked gently and Remus shook his head as there was a knock at the door.
"I understand you Minerva and I too ... I don't want to do this either, but in the end it's Harry and Draco's decision and they ... they want to sacrifice themselves, as awful as that sounds," Severus said wanly as there was another knock on the door and Remus came into the room. With him were Kingsley and Arthur Weasley.
"Yes, you should. First you say goodbye to your certain death and then you live again. We had already divided up your things," Blaise said with a smile.
"Ah yes, there you are," Dumbledore said cheerfully, seeming to wink at the two invisible boys as well.
"No, I don't think so. What are you dreaming about?" Draco wanted to know with a grin.
It took a while before they reached Severus' quarters. Once there, the two boys sank down on the couch.
"And where is my favourite granddaughter?" he then said, taking Lily from Severus' arms. The latter shook his head with a smile.
"What is it?"
"He's the only family Harry has left. The only connection to his parents."
"W-what about him?"
"No, certainly not. What about their friends. Ron and Hermione are very close to Harry and Blaise Zabini is probably close to Draco," Severus sighed and shook his head.
"I love you," he said and the Malfoys nodded.
"But Uncle Sev, this is ... it was supposed to be spontaneous," Draco stuttered.
"He can come to me too," he then said so quickly that he had hardly thought about it.
"I'm certainly not moving into Gryffindor Tower!" said Severus energetically.
"How are you, Harry?", Dumbledore wanted to know.
"Shh ... try to breathe more calmly, I'm here," he murmured and kissed the other's neck. The latter took a deep breath and then turned in Draco's arm.
"Would he?" wanted to know Harry, who by now was clutching Draco's hand tightly.
"Yes, you are right. If Voldemort finds out about this, he will do everything he can to separate the two and kill Harry that way. So what do you suggest?"
"What are we going to do?" she asked, the smile giving way to deep lines of worry. Severus looked back at the door and then at the medi-witch.
"Are you in pain?", Draco wanted to know.
"Hey," he said, smiling wanly. Draco shook his head, tears falling on Harry's chest. He leaned forward and kissed the Gryffindor. A kiss salty of tears and yet the best they could both imagine.
"How is it supposed to go on? Just send them to their deaths, that ... I can't do that," he said and sank into one of the armchairs. Remus nodded.
"So, when ... when are you going to do ... it," Ron asked, skipping Hermione's shake of the head. Harry grinned.
"Good afternoon, Mr Lupin," he said. Remus smiled and tried to hide his despair.
"O-Okay, I won't say anything."
"The potions! You always sucked at potions, but since this year you've become a genius."
"I'm not turning him in! He's my soul mate," Draco shouted, trying to give his voice a firm tone, but not really succeeding.
"Yes, turn over," he said, and Harry stared at the door, unmoving, while the other got ready for bed.
"Yes by all means and don't be too stingy, Zabini," said the latter.
"Draco my boy, Potter will be your undoing," Voldemort said, pointing his wand at the Slytherin. Harry reacted immediately and pulled his husband behind him and said, "I love you!" before turning back to Voldemort.
"I'm glad he doesn't have to do this alone. Even if it means that..." he broke off, but Draco nodded in understanding.
"I've already thought about that, but it wouldn't change anything. Voldemort would plunge England into chaos and violence. It's not just about Harry anymore, it's about all our futures. The Lord knows nothing of this Horcrux, he has nothing to lose since the snake died. If he knew, he would hunt Harry to the end of the world and then lock him up. No, it has to end, no matter what ..." he had almost whispered the last sentence. Remus shook his head and tears ran down his cheeks. Severus hesitated briefly, but then put an arm around the werewolf's shoulder.
"Tired already?" asked Draco, amused.
"Then Draco might have just died without anyone ever knowing why," Harry said.
"For what?"
"Yes, there is. Me or you or us, I don't know, we'll grab the boys and go away, far away, to America for all I care, let you-know-who find us there," Remus said, clenching his fists. Severus almost had to smile. The werewolf would actually run away with him and the two boys? But then he came to his senses, stood up, sat down next to Remus and put a hand on his shoulder. A simple gesture that took the other completely by surprise and silenced him.
As he stepped out of the pub, the cold autumn wind blew around him. He had almost expected Remus to be gone, but he was leaning in the shadow of a house. Severus went to him.
"Now, better," Harry said, pulling Draco close to him.
"Yes, the Order and the Ministry have destroyed six of the Horcruxes," Remus now said.
"Hey, is everything okay? We can stop. Don't worry, I didn't want to sleep with you here and now," Draco said and pulled his hand back, but Harry stopped him.
"I have to go to breakfast. Dumbledore had her things brought here and told the students that you, me, had to stay here as a sort of punishment for the explosion, to help me sort all the potion ingredients," Snape said, rolling his eyes and handing Harry a letter.
"Of course it's in your head, but that doesn't mean it isn't true," the man called back, turned with the children and was gone in a moment. Harry looked out to sea and suddenly knew how to get back to Draco. He went closer and immediately the water washed over his feet. Very slowly he went further and further into the water and dived down.
"No, that's not what I mean. I wasn't very nice."
"You can play with me, Grandpa Remy," Sirius said and held out his arms to the man. The man smiled and lifted his grandson up in his arms.
"No..." came from Remus smugly, as he pulled Severus' shirt over his head and kissed his chest. The latter pushed him away a little.
"Permission? Don't you think Draco decides for himself when he wants to have sex?" asked Lucius, amused.
"He's stabilising. The potions are working," she said exhaustedly.
"How did it feel?", Draco wanted to know.
"What was she like?", Harry wanted to know with a smile.
"So now drink!" said Severus. Harry poured the potion into himself and gagged.
"He wanted ... I mean we ..."
"If we don't touch, then ... then we always have this burning in our chest and body now," he explained. Severus stood up and looked at the two boys seriously.
"I don't know. Sometime between Sirius' death, the adoption and now. We spent so much time together last summer and then...then he threw himself in front of me in the fight against Voldemort. Whenever I think of him, everything pulls together, I miss him..."
"It will," he said, winking at the healer.
"Really, but ..."
"I can't say, but we need to find out more about the soul bond if we are to .... if we are to separate them, but until then, the two are dependent on each other if we don't want Potter to die," Snape concluded, looking thoughtfully into the flames of the fireplace.
"It will fade, but never disappear. Her author is dead and therefore it will become paler, but it will remain, I think," Madame Pomfrey said.
"Because I had to learn that life can be over faster than any of us can imagine."
"Uncle Sev, you can't. I promised not to say anything."
"Um ... I'm done. Do you want to now?" asked Harry, snapping Draco out of his thoughts.
"Thank you, but why are you doing this?" asked Harry. Draco didn't seem to know what he meant for a moment. He lay down next to him again, careful not to break off contact.
"All right, to the hospital wing first," said the Gryffindor. When they arrived there, Severus Snape seemed to have already been waiting for them. Harry looked at Draco, who just shrugged his shoulders, but was already feeling very uncomfortable.
"By the power vested in me, I now pronounce you one! You may kiss each other," Dumbledore said and even the usually strong headmaster had a single tear running down his cheek, surprising even himself. Draco closed his eyes and lowered his lips to Harry's. Here and now, only the two of them mattered. Only muffled did they perceive the clapping of the others and the clearly audible sobbing of Narcissa and also Hermione. They looked up and Dumbledore raised his wand. Suddenly a coloured stone appeared on each of their rings. On Harry's ring shone one in a storm grey, the same colour as Draco's eyes and on his was now a gemstone in emerald green, as green as Harry's eyes. The two smiled and kissed one more time. At some point they broke away from each other and were surrounded by their friends first.
"Mhm ... yeah can be, but I don't either. This is a crappy situation for both of us, so why complicate it," Harry said, stopping as they stood just outside the hut. Draco looked at him for a while, then nodded and looked around. There were only a few students attending the N.E.W.T. class. A handful of Gryffindors, two Hufflepuffs and three Ravenclaws. No Slytherins, except himself, were present.
"Yes, Draco would die too," Remus said barely audibly.
"Draco ... they were too far apart," Neville took over the explanation.
"Maybe I can help there," the two young men wheeled around, startled. Severus and Remus stood in the doorway and looked at the two smiling.
"Yes, above all, my parents have been rehabilitated," Draco said with a smile. Confused, Harry looked at the Malfoys.
"In you go," said the teacher. Draco pushed Harry into the room and sat down at a table at the very back. By necessity, Harry had to sit next to him, far away from Hermione and Ron. Many of the eyes in the room were now on them. The others were watching them as if waiting for one of them to explode.
"Er...w-what's this?", Remus wanted to know, irritated. Severus rolled his eyes and took off his shirt. His counterpart turned pale when he saw the battered skin.
"I cooked again, I hope that was okay?" he said and put the dishes down. The other two looked at him piercingly. It was hard not to show any emotion when your own face was staring at you, with a mixture of anger and honest concern. Sighing, Harry sat down on a chair and stared at his fingernails, which he noticed were extremely neat.
"How ... so how did they become spies?"
"Um ... yes me you too, but that's different from a lifelong commitment to each other, we could never be happy ... alone," Harry added, barely audible. Draco took a deep breath and nodded.
"Well, about that thing in Potions. I'll tell you ... but later, okay?"
"Why should I?"
"Stop!" the Potions Master now said louder than he had intended. Draco and Harry looked at him, startled.
"That's ... um, terrible ... isn't it?" Ron wanted to know. He and Hermione were sitting on two chairs next to Harry and Draco's bed. Now it was Draco, who was reading a book and couldn't hear anything, but had his hand tightly closed around Harry's.
"How does it feel?" he wanted to know at one point, turning his head to Harry.
"Harry, don't let it get you down!" said Dumbledore encouragingly. Harry nodded quickly before rushing after Snape.
"Don't worry Sev. The bay is shallow and the water is calm. That's where I taught Draco to swim," Lucius interjected.
"It doesn't have to, I don't know it any other way."
"I know, but right now we need to take care of the students first," Severus said, his voice quivering.
"But I know," he then said and walked out of the room. Draco looked at Harry, who lay pale beside him. The Slytherin quickly conjured up his pyjamas, turned out the light, lay under the covers and reached for Harry's hand again.
"Harry James Malfoy, I am proud that you are part of our family, even if only for a short time. We will carry your story to the world and you are not to blame for any of this. You are a victim, just like Draco, please understand that," he said, pulling the young man into his arms one more time. They stood like that for a while until Lucius broke away and took his wife's hand.
"Not for this ... Pot ... Harry," he said and walked out of the room.
"Th-that's for sure Sev," Lucius said, clearing his throat before opening the door.
"All right, but it doesn't solve the fundamental problem that the two are connected. How sure are you about the soul bond?" asked Dumbledore thoughtfully.
"That means that ... so it's possible that when one dies, so does the other. Their souls have merged. I don't know yet how and why Potter has worse symptoms, but everything else points to a soul link," Severus said.
"Do that and keep us updated," Narcissa said, giving the teacher a quick hug.
"Y-Yes please," Draco said quickly and Severus climbed through the hidden entrance that connected his flat to the potions classroom. Since Slughorn taught here, he usually took the normal entrance, but this way he could get Blaise, Hermione and Ron into his flat with as little fuss as possible. He collected himself for a moment, then opened the classroom door and looked into the visibly worried faces of the two Gryffindors and Blaise.
"Yes, Dumbledore assumes that. He wants Harry ...", Draco said. The room remained silent for a while, then Blaise stood up, walked towards Harry and Draco and gave them both a quick hug.
"It seems so. I can't explain it exactly, but the potion seems to have the effect that if Mr Malfoy and Mr Potter move more than two metres away from each other, they both suffer pain. Why they are so severe in one and only slight in the other, I cannot say. The fact is that Mr Potter could die from it if I interpret the readings he had earlier correctly," Madame Pomfrey concluded. Draco looked at Harry, stunned.
"I wasn't asleep yet anyway, so Severus, what can I do for you?"
"Ron, he's not what you think. Please believe me! He would have been with me ...", Harry faltered. He had left out the part about the suicide attempt until now. Now he took a deep breath and began to tell the story. Hermione and Ron were paler than ever.
"What do you mean?"
When Severus Snape came back into the dining room, he immediately spotted Remus at one of the back tables. He crossed the room and sat down with the werewolf.
"I can imagine," he said, sinking back into the pillows.
"I don't know. I ... I was afraid that I might not be able to go back to Hogwarts if I told you and then ... I didn't know any different. It was normal, I felt it was normal at some point. What's going to happen now?" Harry looked up and tears glistened in his eyes.
"Are you coming?" the disembodied voice wanted to know from Harry.
"I don't want to leave you alone. You've already lost so much and..."
"Yeah, me neither," Harry said, pushing his plate to the side.
"How did we get here?"
"We're kind of trying to enjoy the time we have left," Harry said quietly, looking down at the floor.
"Okay, a bit like a sore muscle," he said, squeezing Draco's hand.
"Yes, but ... but from now on we mustn't be close, we mustn't talk to each other ... it's the same as always now."
"So let's go and feed our Blast-Ended Skrewt and be done with it," Hagrid now said quickly. Groaning, the students stood up and followed the half-giant back to the hut.
"No, I'm fine," Harry said, reaching for his quill again. Snape was teaching Defence that year and still made no secret of his dislike for Harry. Only one thing had changed, Harry no longer got involved in any confrontation with the teacher. Since he was an excellent student in Defence, Snape had little room for attack.
"I don't like this at all, Severus. They were barely two metres apart and their entire organism was threatening to collapse. There is hardly any difference between them anymore, especially as their nerves are also already completely overstimulated when they have no skin contact. So they cannot possibly take part in the lessons. Also because Mr. Malfoy himself will no longer be able to react, as his pain is also very strong by now."
"It's all right, Mr Malfoy we heard everything," Minerva said. Severus bent down to Harry and lifted him up in his arms.
"We thank you and ... and we are getting married tonight, Dumbledore is marrying us and you shall be there," Draco said.
"Very good," the Gryffindor murmured and saw that Blaise was now giving them evil glances. Draco raised his arms again and Harry followed suit.
"Safe, for now," the man said evasively.
"O-One moment, how is the bond sealed?" asked Narcissa, looking to her husband, who swallowed hard and ran his hand through his blond hair.
"Not the one you're thinking of, you lecher. We really need to fix up your uncle."
"Hey Malfoy, so ... so I think you're really okay," he then said to Draco and held out his hand. The young man reached for it and smiled.
"We're getting married tomorrow night. Dumbledore is going to marry us and you have to be there somehow, please!" pleaded Draco, close to tears. The Malfoys looked at each other.
"So what's going on?", Lucius wanted to know after he had closed the door.
"My Lord, are you all right?", Bellatrix Lestrange helped Voldemort to stand up. The dark lord had collapsed shortly after his curse.
"Good, it's safe now. Why don't you sit down?" he said, pointing to two of the classroom chairs while he himself remained standing.
"You hate me anyway! It makes no difference to you whether I'm alive or not. It doesn't matter to you, so you don't have to pretend now out of a sense of duty..." said Harry in a quivering voice, lowering his gaze again. Remus said nothing, he knew that Harry had hit a spot in Severus, one that he probably didn't know about until now. He stared at Harry as if paralysed.
"Who would have thought?" said Lucius, following his best friend's gaze.
"Try to get some sleep and we'll see tomorrow," Severus added and the two young men nodded before closing the door behind them.
"What do you think is happening to us?", Harry wanted to know quietly and turned slightly. Draco leaned on his other arm and looked at him.
"NO!!!", Narcissa's scream lingered through the empty classroom and would surely have been heard all the way to the Great Hall if the spell had not prevented it. The woman screamed, crying, and Lucius held her, crying with her. Severus stood helplessly by and he too was fighting tears.
"Mine, we can do magic, remember?"
"Yes, what is it? I have to get something quickly," said Severus, grabbing the bag and hurrying out of the Great Hall.
"Yes, that counts," Draco said with a smile. Suddenly, something glowing could be seen moving between the trees. The boys stopped and then they saw it - a unicorn. The animal was barely five metres away and eyed the two intruders suspiciously. Neither of them dared to move when the animal suddenly came closer. Harry cautiously reached out his hand and the unicorn immediately nestled its head against it. Gently Harrys stroked it and immediately he felt a little lighter, less sad.
"Will," was all Draco said and pushed the shirt back down.
"I'm staying too!" said Ginny energetically.
"I'll take you. Harry, Draco, you can stay here overnight. I'll come back for you at noon," Severus said and left the room with Remus and the others. Dumbledore patted Harry and Draco somewhat awkwardly on the shoulder before leaving as well.
"Sure and if you let me, it will be forever, however short it is," Remus said sadly. Severus nodded again and together they entered the Hogwarts grounds.
"Yes, already ..."
"Mhm...", listlessly Harry reached for a piece of toast. Blaise had no way of knowing that he could go very long without eating something. He felt Draco's scrutinising gaze on him now too and picked up his fork to eat some scrambled eggs. He didn't need any more questions.
"That's all I wanted to hear," he said. Severus nodded and stood up.
"No, everything's okay," Harry said.
"Will do and now get out, we'll get this sorted," Remus said, lifting Sirius up in his arms.
"That means you're just playing a part, too?" he wanted to know. Draco, still staring at the hands holding each other, looked up.
"Mhm ... you have my respect and Hermione too," Harry said and looked around. The class was quite empty and besides Draco and Hermione, there were only three Ravenclaws and two Slytherins sitting in the small room. Professor Babbling nodded briefly at Harry with a smile and then began the lesson. The Gryffindor hardly noticed anything, he didn't understand much anyway. While the students struggled through a translation, he began the homework. After all, there weren't many that day. After two hours, the lesson ended and so did the school day.
"Can you fix it," he asked him.
"I know our relationship has been ... difficult and I'm really sorry. I never really saw how much you got from your mother after all. She would be so proud, I know that," Severus said, visibly dejected. Harry nodded with a smile and stepped hesitantly towards the man. He didn't think twice and embraced the boy.
"So what was that about 'not really'?" the latter now wanted to know. Draco sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose.
"I'd be interested to know what Harry actually did to you. Oh I know, he looks like James, how could I have missed that. How tactless of him," said Remus, who was now clearly angry.
"What happened when the curse hit me?" the latter wanted to know.
"I taught them the basics of apparating."
"That is, of course, extremely worrying. Will you and Horace get on?" Albus wanted to know, visibly worried.
"Th-thank you," Molly said and Harry nodded wanly.
"Mhmm ... I don't know," Harry said with a grin, stealing a kiss.
"Yes, maybe, but I was the older one and should have acted differently."
"Yeah, me neither, but there were reasons for that ...", Draco said now and looked depressed. In short sentences he summarised what had happened, to the point that they could hardly separate without feeling pain. Blaise stared at him in silence for a while, then took a deep breath.
"I would, but it's more than two metres!"
"Yes, good morning," Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck.
"I think it's different in Harry's case or am I seeing it wrong now? I mean yes he's sixteen, but he's been abused for life, tried to kill himself and has entered into his soul bond, oh yes and there's the matter of HIS SOON DEAD!" cried Remus at the end, so full of despair that it shook Severus to the core. The werewolf sobbed out and buried his face in his hands. Severus froze for a moment, then stood up, stepped behind the other and put his hands on his shoulders.
"Okay, then, sleep well," Hermione said, looking worriedly at Ron, who also looked sympathetically at Harry. He just nodded and disappeared into the sixth year boys' dormitory.
"I'm sorry Mr Potter, I didn't mean to. How are you feeling?" Madame Pomfrey wanted to know.
"If ... if I had been able to do the spell, then ..."
"What happened here?"
"Good, so where do you stay?" asked Severus, taking his arm from the other's shoulder.
"And what's that like?", Remus wanted to know with a grin. Severus rolled his eyes.
"Yes, this is my room, so at home," he said.
"Hey, Pa too," ten-year-old Sirius nudged his five-year-old sister Lily against the shoulder.
"Yes, Dumbledore is allowed to perform weddings, it would be legal," the teacher explained.
"Thanks Mum," Draco said and Harry nodded. Severus meanwhile had the cloak of invisibility in his hand and threw it over the two of them.
"It won't rip my guts out if I move away from you, so ..." he said with a sneer. There was instant deep hurt in Harry's gaze and it hit Draco harder than he had thought.
"All right, Potter's cloak of invisibility must be good for something. I'll bring them to you, but please go now," the teacher said. Lucius nodded and pulled his wife to her feet.
"That means ..."
"Okay Hermione, I promise I'll apologise to Peeves, but let's go now," Blaise said and they hurried upstairs.
"Itâ€™s okay," Draco said and held a piece of meat into the crate. One of the Skrewt snatched at him and at the last moment Harry pulled the other's hand away.
"I'm trying."
"He never told you anything? Not to you or Black?"
"Yes Mum and thank you," Draco said. His mother nodded, gave both boys a kiss on the forehead and then followed her husband outside. Harry sank back into the pillows and rested his head on Draco's chest. The latter stroked his hair steadily.
"What happened?" Narcissa wanted to know immediately, seeing how worried Severus looked. In short sentences, the teacher summarised the last few days, up to Harry's suicide attempt and the fact that Harry and Draco were now a couple. The Malfoys exchanged worried glances.
"Dray, everything's okay. I trust you, I really do ... just do it," Draco nodded and lowered his lips to Harry's again briefly before kissing the latter's neck and then further down his chest. Harry gasped and stroked Draco's back in turn.
"Mum, I know, but I'm really not hungry anymore."
"What's wrong?" Remus wanted to know and looked worriedly at his friend. He was holding his left arm.
"Shut up Lupin!", Harry shook his head with a smile, maybe the rest of the week wouldn't be quite so awful after all.
"Are you okay?", Severus wanted to know anxiously.
"You or me?" he asked.
"Yes, sir!" said Harry tonelessly. Snape regarded him with raised eyebrows. The boy was different from all the other years. He didn't talk back, complied and hardly stood out. He didn't really care, but Severus Snape's thoughts now revolved around Potter more often than he would have liked.
"No, no, everything's fine," Severus said and made two glasses of wine appear.
"What should we wear?" whispered Ron to Hermione. They sat together in the common room and had been trying not to let on all day. Ginny in particular had become extremely suspicious, not knowing her brother to be as silent as he was today. He and Hermione had an extremely guilty conscience, but they had promised not to say anything and so they had somehow spent the whole day together, avoiding the others.
"Well, I guess that's how it is. Actually, the hat wanted to send me to Slytherin."
"Nothing ... it's just. I'm sorry."
"Draco Lucius Malfoy."
"Yes and? Harry I ... I love you and I don't want anything to happen to you," Harry stared at Draco in disbelief, then sat up a little and lowered his lips to the Slytherin's.
"Mhm ... do you know what a bucket list is?" Harry wanted to know and his friend tilted his head.
"NO HARRY, BY MERLIN I WAS JUST TRYING TO PROTECT YOU. I couldn't ... I couldn't bear to lose you and as soon as I saw the scars, the injuries, there was this fear, the fear that one day you wouldn't be there anymore. I know you might hate me now, and I was wrong to betray your trust, but I just couldn't help it," Draco finished quietly now, slumping slightly and staring at the sheet. Suddenly he felt Harry's hand on his arm and looked up.
"Ew ..." came from the children.
"It won't hurt," Madame Pomfrey said and let her wand wander over Harry. It took much longer than usual and the Gryffindor did not suspect anything good. The medicine witch seemed worried.
"I think they're fine. Don't worry about it. Good night and you'll find everything you need in the cupboard in the bedroom," the potions master said, then he was gone. Remus sighed deeply, emptied his water glass, took off his worn jacket and went into the bathroom.
"This is so unfair," Hermione sobbed.
"Good, then I'll sort everything out with Madame Pomfrey and the others," Lucius said.
"You do realise he can't hear you?" asked Harry, amused.
"The fur?", Harry wanted to know and threw a piece of meat to one of the ugly animals.
"About four to five ..." said Harry and Draco nodded.
"Yes, exactly. It's really important, otherwise you'll both end up in pain. If you're the one on the bottom, then ... then you just have to trust and try to relax. It helps if you touch yourself or even if your partner does it."
"So please begin. You have one hour," Slughorn said. Harry sidled up to the other's table and looked at him challengingly.
"Sirius? Is it all happening in my head?" cried Harry.
"You and me together here over a glass of wine."
"The burning? Yes," Harry said in a whisper, but before they could think about it further, they were standing outside Dumbledore's office.
"We meet again," the Gryffindor said, addressing the two men, and left the hall with Draco without turning around again.
"Dray?"
"Oh, yes..." she said and stared at the Weasley's hand that held hers.
"Good, then help me in the kitchen and wipe that smug grin off your face!"
"I'm sorry," the Gryffindor said quietly.
"Of course. You go ahead, both of you. You can freshen up right there and then you can have breakfast," Madame Pomfrey said and disappeared. Harry nodded and swung his legs off the bed. Draco did the same and reached for some fresh clothes.
"I think it does. I want everyone to see that you belong to me."
"Well, then, you should both make friends with this situation," Dumbledore said, smiling mildly.
"Are you okay?", Draco wanted to know.
"What does that mean? That I have a choice?"
"Yes, the only one I've had so far," Draco nodded and looked at his friend for a while, then leaned over and kissed him. Gently, he pressed the other into the pillows and lay down between his legs.
"Uncle Sev, everything a-all right?", Draco wanted to know, looking at the man worriedly as Harry straightened up a bit, already reaching for his shirt.
"Oh, so that's what it's about ..."
"Yes I can and I'm really sorry."
"We should go, shouldn't we?" asked Harry at one point.
"Now then, I want to sleep," Draco said, turning out the light and turning onto his side. Blaise looked sympathetically at Harry once more before he too turned off his bedside lamp and plunged the room into almost complete darkness, with only the pale light from the magical windows still dimly visible. Harry turned on his side and pulled the blanket over his shoulders. It was cold on the floor, colder than he would have thought. He couldn't find any sleep, at some point the burning in his chest increased again and he knew that Draco had slipped further away from the edge in his sleep. True, the intense pain only came when the other was further than two metres away, but even at one metre he could already feel the burning. Harry now crawled as close as he could to the Slytherin's bed and it helped. The burning was subsiding. He tightened his legs and tried to fall asleep.
Teachers and Order members stood in a line and hardly anyone dared to look at the two boys. Only Professor McGonagall approached them and placed a hand on each of their cheeks.
"Severus, I know this sounds awful, but ...", Severus jumped up.
"Really? Why didn't he?"
Severus disapparated as soon as he reached the village. As he stood in front of Malfoy Manor, the sun was just setting. He straightened his shoulders and hoped fervently that Narcissa and Lucius were alone. He knocked on the heavy oak door and a house elf opened it.
"Yes, Siri, we'll do that, but first let's have some food!" he said.
"All right, then, follow me," the teacher said and turned away. Draco nodded to Harry and they followed the man. They didn't speak a word, in fact they had hardly spoken all day. Everyone seemed to be preoccupied with their thoughts. Harry hardly noticed how at some point they stood in the dungeons and stepped through a door behind Snape. He didn't know himself what he had in mind, but the flat was really cosy, of course the Slytherin green predominated here, but otherwise Harry would have expected something colder. They stood in the living room, which had a seating area in front of the fireplace and an open kitchen with a table and chairs. Snape walked through the flat and opened a door.
"Have you ever been to the sea?"
"Don't blame yourself, okay?", Remus came closer and stroked Harry's cheek.
"I thought you liked Lucius and Narcissa? Besides, Draco is there too!"
"I love you," he whispered and Harry could say nothing but nodded.
"See you in three days, children," Harry called out and in the next moment he and Draco had disappeared.
"Listen Draco, we love you both and we couldn't ask for a better son-in-law than Harry, but we have to go. When I first held you, I was afraid, afraid of failing as a father, afraid of becoming the kind of father mine was, afraid of losing you ... losing you someday. But you know what? I am proud, proud of what you have become. You've managed to make your own way, and you've made the right choices. Letting you go tears me apart, but I know what and who you are doing it for, who you are both doing it for. You are doing it so others can be safe and live and as a father I couldn't be prouder," Lucius had tears running down his face. He placed a hand on Draco's cheek and smiled.
"I didn't know about that, my lord. Draco come here," Lucius said, the tremor in his voice hard to deny.
"Tomorrow already?", Draco wanted to know in surprise.
"Turn around!" he said and Harry, who was far too tired to give a big account, turned towards the door. At some point he heard the shower and then Malfoy brushing his teeth.
"Ah, I see Messrs Malfoy and Potter are separated again. Very well then, let us continue with potent potions today. Open your book to page 145 and ...", Horace Slughorn turned to the blackboard and Harry pulled out his book. Yes, they were apart, but strangely it almost hurt more than it had the days before, albeit differently.
"Potter, Malfoy I will see you both here tonight at 7pm, I hope we understand each other," Snape said at the end of the lesson as the students were packing up their things.
"Okay, honey have a good evening!" exclaimed Blaise. Draco rolled his eyes, threw him a kissing hand and disappeared from the room. He hurried through the corridors and climbed up to the third floor. He turned a corner and ran straight into Harry. He quickly looked around and then smiled.
"If you two keep this up, everyone will realise something is wrong," Blaise murmured and Draco nodded.
"Severus, we ... they can't wait any longer. Their bodies can't take much more of this. By now they are in slight pain despite the physical contact and without ... They can't go on like this. The pain potions aren't helping anymore," she said quietly. Severus ran his hand through his hair and nodded.
Quietly, Severus Snape closed the door of the room. The boys had not noticed him, he had come in shortly after Draco had asked if Harry was afraid. Now he stood in front of the door again and leaned against the warm wood, sighing. Like Merlin, two sixteen year olds should be told they had to die, and involuntarily Severus now saw Lucius and Narcissa before him and knew that this conversation was going to be the hardest he had ever had. He pushed himself away from the door and set off to send an owl.
"Good morning, Professor," Harry said as Albus approached the bed.
"C-can you break a soul bond like that?"
"Very well. Master and Lady Malfoy are in the drawing room," the house elf said and let Severus enter. He led the Potions Master through the house to the drawing room, where Narcissa and Lucius were sitting in front of the fireplace, reading. They looked up in surprise.
"Leave it Dray, yes it did ... so it worked," Harry said, letting go of his friend's hand and spotting Remus.
"Alright, so anyway. I'll take care of Draco and now I have to go," Severus said, throwing on his cloak.
"Always," Harry said wanly and Draco wanted to take him in his arms immediately, but he could do nothing but sit there and try to give Harry strength through his closeness.
"We thought we'd take a trip. Dumbledore has given you both an extra two weeks off from classes and how about a few weeks at the seaside?" asked Lucius.
"Yes, they can get aggressive if you get too close to the tree to get wood for wands. See the long fingers?", Draco nodded fondly.
"Yes, the blood protection. I know that, but ..."
"Poppy! It's Severus. I'm stuck in...apparently I'm stuck in Potter's body," he said, staring at the Gryffindor jumper he was wearing. The Healer looked at him doubtfully.
"So now I have another surprise, come on," said the half-giant and led the class a little further into the forest. Suddenly they were standing in a clearing, but nothing was visible.
"Well I don't know what's so interesting about Messrs Malfoy and Potter, but it would be nice if you would turn your attention to me now," Snape thundered and everyone immediately turned to the teacher. For Harry, the lesson was a gauntlet. Snape pestered him and although he could answer every question, he gave him no points. Draco, meanwhile, felt unbridled anger in his belly. Not at the situation, not at Potter, but at his godfather. Why did Snape treat Harry like that, and just when he was already down?
"That ... we don't know. There are rumours that he's on his way here because he has nothing left to lose, but we don't know anything for sure," Severus said. Harry swallowed and stood up.
"I really don't know. I've never had that before, but it seems to be increasing. Could it be that they're not just holding hands for the pain?"
"Your p-parents, what are they like?" the Gryffindor wanted to know after a while.
"But why do you promise that then? That's mean!"
"You don't look well," he said, looking at Severus/Harry.
"Potter look at me, what hurts?"
"Well, nobody's saying you shouldn't learn something too," he murmured and kissed his way down Harry's chest. Already he could hardly lie still and arched his back towards Draco. Draco smiled and licked the length of his friend once before he lowered his lips completely over Harry's erection. Harry could no longer think straight and clawed at the sheets.
"Umbridge," Draco gasped. Harry withdrew his hand and stroked it briefly.
Soon the hall had emptied except for the few who remained behind. The Order made plans as to how they could most safely set up protection, not realising that it might not be necessary. Draco and Harry stood at the edge of the hall, along with Ron, Hermione, Blaise, Snape and Remus.
"As I said, I suspected it for a while, but the certainty only came last year."
"Please look after him and don't leave him alone again," he said and Severus understood.
"Stop!" he heard himself say and Draco looked at him, completely confused.
"Dray ... hey, concentrate," Blaise hissed and took the knife from his best friend's hand, with which he had almost cut his hand.
"Go in and come back to the dungeons afterwards. Good ... good luck," Severus said, then disappeared. Harry and Draco looked at each other, then climbed the stairs and knocked.
"Nevertheless, you are a Gryffindor."
"Can you see anything else?" he wanted to know.
"What your father wants to say, we are very happy. We're going to have a fun few days, aren't we Siri?"
"Draco, because that would change both of your lives forever."
"Since Draco proposed and I am happy for you," he said.
"So that was it, that was the story of how your father and I got together," 32-year-old Harry James Malfoy, took off his glasses and rubbed his eyes. Before he looked back into the two pairs of shiny ones of his children.
"Yes, yes I can do that," he said wanly.
"Dray, you know what that would mean ..."
"There is probably only one solution," he said, smiling painedly.
"Mummy?" said Draco, now throwing himself into the woman's arms.
"So one more time flying on a broom, petting a unicorn, drinking tea at Hagrid's, learning to Apparate, wandering around the castle at night, stealing ice cream in the kitchen, okay now you again," Harry said and handed Draco the parchment. They had always taken turns writing things on their list, though certainly not all of it was realistic, but it helped them somehow. Draco took the quill and wrote, grinning. Harry looked at the parchment and blushed.
"These Muggles must be punished," Narcissa pressed out with difficulty.
"Thank you Minerva. Come Draco," Severus said and led the way, always making sure Draco stayed close to him. The latter was glad that they met only a few students in the corridors. None dared to say anything as soon as they saw Snape's face. Many moved aside and so they were quickly in the dungeons and in the teacher's rooms. The latter put Harry to bed, conjured him into pyjamas and called up a potion which he poured into him.
"Good morning," he said and the boys blushed slightly but sat back down together on the bed.
"It's all right my boy, we all make mistakes," the medi-witch said, patting Draco's shoulder encouragingly before turning her attention to other work. Draco sighed and looked at Harry, whose chest was rising and falling evenly.
"Y-Yes, does that mean you had that burning sensation all the time too, even though we were so close?"
"Get in there!" he said and pushed the two young men into his flat unseen. Remus Lupin, who had been sitting at the kitchen table, jumped up.
"Potter, what have you done in your incompetence again?" thundered Snape immediately. Harry had no strength to argue with the man, but he didn't have to, Draco jumped in.
"It's about Potter and Draco ...", the latter said and summarised everything briefly. Dumbledore remained silent the entire time, then sighed and sat down behind his desk.
"It's so pointless," he said, turning on his side, even though he could barely see Severus in the pale light.
"Tea?" was all he asked, though.
"Okay boys, all safe. Take the cloak off," he then said and Draco pulled the fabric off their heads.
"Will Narcissa and Lucius be able to do this?" asked Remus quietly.
"Nobody knows, do they?", Harry shook his head.
"Dad, I'm of age, I can do it myself..." he didn't get any further. Lucius had already disappeared with him.
"Just give him some more time," he said and turned back to his homework.
"O-Okay ... what do we do now?", Harry wanted to know and Draco clearly felt his friend trembling. Gently he put his arms around him so that he would become calmer.
It was not yet curfew and so Harry and Draco could not hold hands, too many stares followed them. They tried to walk as close to each other as possible, but the pain was still present. When they reached the hospital wing, three Hufflepuffs were sitting on the beds, seemingly cooling burns. Madame Pomfrey looked at Severus and then at the boys and pointed with her head in the direction of a separate room. Snape nodded and pushed Harry and Draco through a door.
"Draco, are you all right?" Severus wanted to know anxiously. The Slytherin nodded absently and stared at Harry, who was apparently unconscious, only a metre away from him.
"Yes, Sev is right, let's celebrate something," Remus said and now walked over to Harry and Draco, followed by the others.
"Yeah, it's fine."
"Just stay close to us and not another peep. You just follow me when we get to the 'three broomsticks', understand?" whispered Severus. He heard a collective clearing of his throat in confirmation. Once more Severus looked to Remus, who nodded promptly, then they walked in a direct path to the lit inn. Remus opened the door and held it open for Severus, who walked through with the hidden boys.
"You see, he's not a bad person," Draco said, pulling Harry along with him.
"I don't know, because ... I don't know, it feels like cheating when...", Remus sighed and rubbed the bridge of his nose.
"I ... we promise," she said and looked at Lucius, who also nodded with red eyes. Then she knelt down as well and pulled the boys into her arms, cried with them and swore not to break her promise.
"Remus!"
"Potter! Get off your arse, or rather my arse, and come on!" said Snape, no longer dignifying the headmaster with a glance. Harry slumped his shoulders but followed him.
"Very nice, you are recovering amazingly fast. You could leave as early as tonight," she said. At the same moment, Severus Snape entered the hospital wing.
"Careful, it's easy to lose a finger," he said, releasing his hand.
"Stay seated!" said Draco to Harry and stood up. He walked a few steps and after less than half a metre he felt as if someone was going to slowly drive a knife into his stomach. He walked towards his uncle who was standing about two metres away, when he reached him he thought it was going to rip him apart. Then he heard Harry's scream. His friend was writhing on the bed.
"Because I asked him to. I knew nothing about the wizarding world. I only knew that all the black wizards so far were in Slytherin and the man who killed my parents. I'm sure you understand that I didn't really want to go to that house."
"You already do," he said. The Slytherin lowered his lips to the Gryffindor's again and ran his hand down his T-shirt. Gently he stroked Harry's chest. He enjoyed the touch, but as his thoughts wandered to the bond, he stiffened imperceptibly.
"Excuse me?", Ron thought for a moment he had misheard.
"Wait a minute. Remus? Remus Lupin? Why him of all people?", Lucius wanted to know. Embarrassed, Severus scratched his head.
"Kiss me," Hermione said now almost in a whisper.
"Don't look at me when you do that, it's my husband's fault," Severus said, raising his arms defensively.
"You didn't? But I saw you swimming at the Triwizard Tournament," Harry laughed out loud and shook his head.
"No Sev ... um Severus, forget it okay! I was just being emotional."
"Let me do it," said the werewolf, who was also wearing a noble suit today.
"It's true, I didn't talk to anyone about it either, but I wasn't alone. I had a mother who loved me and helped me get over a lot. I never slept in a cupboard, I always had food to eat and clothes that fitted me. Yes, I didn't have an entirely beautiful childhood, but I had one."
"Severus, I wish there was another way, but ..."
"Anyway, we have to go to Defence if we don't want detention," Blaise insisted and stood up. Now many students were striving towards class and it was getting crowded in the corridors. Harry was gripped by naked fear and he tried not to lose Draco. It was Blaise who noticed that Harry was panicking. He drew Draco's attention, who rolled his eyes in annoyance. He stopped and grabbed Harry by the upper arm.
"Eileen will be pleased, at thirteen she's getting tired of babysitting them," he then said.
"Yes ... sure," Harry said and threw soil on one of the seedlings.
"What did he mean?", Harry wanted to know, confused.
"One solution would be to seal the bond, wouldn't it?"
"That's all right. See you soon," he said and patted Harry on the shoulder.
"We have no choice and frankly ..."
"U-Uncle Sev, please ... please be there for Mum and Dad, they need you..."
"What?"
They walked silently through the quiet corridors of the school. When they entered the hall, all eyes turned to them and silence fell. Harry realised that word had already spread around the school about what had happened. Hunching his shoulders, he followed Draco to the Slytherin table. He sat down next to Blaise, who had apparently saved them a seat. Draco gave everyone present a withering look and it seemed to work. Everyone returned to eating, but not without watching the two young men every now and then. Draco filled his plate while Harry, next to him, merely poured himself some water.
