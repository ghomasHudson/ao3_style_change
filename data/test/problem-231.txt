“Apparently Gringotts have found a vault belonging to my father, so I have an appointment to go see what the fuck it is.” Draco grumbled, pulling out a pan from the bottom cupboard. Harry immediately felt a wave of relief wash over him. His frown deepened, he knew Draco despised anything to do with his father, but he idly wondered why the appointment was scheduled for later on. “I’ll come with you.” Harry announced, nodding his head.
“I suppose Whitney Houston is growing on me…” He said, as he leant in to kiss the dark haired wizard he’d been longing to kiss for so long.
Turning back towards the crowd, Harry smiled as best he could and opened his mouth to speak. “The Auror department would like to offer its condolences to the family of Tracey Davis, who died in the line of duty protecting Ron. The Ministry of Magic would like to offer the family any support during these hard times.” he nodded towards the family of Tracey, who were crying. A large picture of Tracey Davis donning full Auror attire, smiling sat to the side of the marble podium. “Thank you for coming everyone, please let's take a minute of silence for our fallen comrade.” He bowed his head.
“I’ll make you one when you get back.” Draco smiled sweetly. Harry rolled his eyes and grabbed his wallet off the coffee table. “Prick,” he mumbled. “Do you want garlic dip?”
Exiting the bedroom, Draco locked the door behind him and walked down to the lobby, where he met a rather dishevelled looking Louisa. The look on her face was pure elation, it made his heart skip a little. When he first met this woman, she was suffering pretty badly, he’d seen her turn into this confident beauty in front of him.
"Alright, I'll help you Potter, but on one condition." Biting his lip, Harry looked up at Draco. "What's that?" A smirk appeared on Draco's face. "You have to drink tea with me at possibly the shittest Cafe in Diagon Alley every single day." Harry scowled, "That's it? I thought you were going to ask for ten thousand galleons or something equally ridiculous."
And Draco, you cannot imagine the effect that your letter has had on me. If you could only see me, you’d laugh, you truly would. You’ve unmanned me, love. I’m in absolute
Harry nodded in agreement, he wandered over to the heater on the back wall of the living room and turned the dial. “Should come on soon,” he smiled, returning to the sofa. Once sat down, Draco shifted closer to him and pulled the blanket over the other man, covering almost the entirety of his body.
They sat in relative silence, the only sound that could be heard was Harry’s heavy breathing and the sound of birds outside their windows. Knocked out of his musings, Draco’s eyes wandered to the door and the faint sound of knocking from the other side.
interested, put it this way Potter, if I’m not pregnant I will be very soon. I’m not going to let you out of our sheets for at least a week.
“Finally, Auror Lockwood earlier today set his desk on fire, scorching the Celtic Serpent in to it before hexing a few others and fleeing the scene.”
“You hated Drag Me to Hell more though.” Harry smirked, they began to walk together towards the forest boundary keeping an eye out for any movements, though all they’d noticed were a few birds and a deer poking its head out of the trees. “That one was pretty bad, that crazy gypsy lady? I wouldn’t have said no to her, Merlin.” Draco sighed, shaking his head at the memory. “I don’t know why you insist on watching those movies, I much preferred Titanic.” Draco stated, narrowing his eyes at the raven haired man.
The scathing tone of Harry’s voice made Draco wince a little and he raised an eyebrow, clearing his throat. “What is a Don Lothario?” he asked. This wasn’t exactly the most important part of that outburst he wanted to know about, but he decided to ease his way into that particular conversation.
dating, it was more the fact every man he met was either only interested in sex, or money, or even worse, his ‘reputation’. His last boyfriend, Samuel, was a nice enough guy if you could get past the alcohol addiction, or that he’d cheat on you with seven different men.
Nodding in agreement, Draco quickly arranged a place to meet Potter after the match and they went off towards the arena together, leaving Potter stood beside his Bentley looking utterly confused.
Ron, of course, was pleased as punch. He joked that he felt terribly sorry for any child of ours. ‘Poor kid,’ were his words, ‘destined to inherit
In Harry’s breast pocket was an owl from Narcissa, he’d received it about two minutes ago but not yet read it, he needed to be bang on the right time for apparition, he didn’t intend to lose another team member today.
“But this particular incident has had me take drastic measures. You are to keep this a secret, do not let your team members know.” Kingsley put sternly, giving Harry the look he only knew too well. “Aurors Thomas and Finnigan know we are investigating the Celtic Serpents, however they are not to know Zabini is an Unspeakable, furthermore I would like yourself and Auror Malfoy to liaise with the Department of Mysteries.”
Caught off guard, Draco looked up and shook his head. “I hadn’t planned on it,” a frown creased his brow, he began to aimlessly chop his pancakes up on his plate. “Why do you ask?”
His eyes wandered as he feasted on his pizza, stopping at the framed picture on the mantel. It was a moving picture of Harry splashing water in Draco’s face during their vacation to Miami. Hermione and Ron had accompanied them, along with Pansy and Blaise. Unsure at first, Harry had become quick friends with Blaise over their mutual like for Quidditch. Blaise worked in Gringotts as a financial advisor. He married Pansy about three months ago. Draco’s eyes moved over to another photo of him and Harry donning full tuxedos during that wedding, the photo always brought a smile to his face. Harry had been absolutely plastered when the photo was taken.
read in the Daily Prophet were all about Potter’s playboy ways. Always pictured with other witches and wizards, always a new scandal about their favourite boy hero. Draco kept a relatively low profile and definitely didn’t want to get into all
Everything would be easier if it weren’t for the stupid sunglasses. When Potter wore them, he could pretend he didn’t see the disdain in Harry’s eyes. He could pretend Potter didn’t hate him.
“And I suppose you play some embodiment of elegance and class,” Harry suggests, successfully not hitting Malfoy, although not quite keeping his voice controlled.
“Oh, Harry.” Her voice drips with sympathy, and Harry genuinely cannot tell if it’s mocking or not. “Anyways, get me Pansy’s address, thank you so much! I love you! Bye!”
The trouble was, Harry thought as he stared at the morning sunlight creeping across his bed, Malfoy hadn’t done anything wrong. Oh sure, as a frightened teenager he had done plenty. And yesterday he’d laughed at Harry for five full minutes while he tried to find his glasses, and then frantically Disapparated as soon as Harry could see again. And he was still a classist excuse of a human being. Probably still hated Muggles and was only in the band for- for god knows why. The exact sort of person Harry would always save a bit of his contempt for. But somehow, Harry couldn’t bring himself to dislike him. Or even to hate him.
“It’s your bloody turn to clean,” snarls Draco, at the same time as Pansy drags her index finger through the dust on the countertop and presents it to Blaise, as if it’s a high honour to witness the state of their kitchen. Fortunately, just at that moment Blaise’s Tempus charm goes off.
Draco startles and stares at Pansy. As always, she’s the picture of elegance - short hair swept away from her face, outfit carefully coordinated. She wore dark teal robes lined with stripes of cherry red, which really had no right to work as well as it did. However, her poised facade melted away the instant she smiled. Then, she just looked predatory, thought Draco amusedly, examining her grin.
Harry’s mouth downturns for a second, but amazingly, he takes his glasses off and folds them into his pocket. Draco exhales with relief.
Harry clenches his fists and makes as though he’s about to storm off, but he turns back to Draco. His gaze settles.
Draco matches Pansy’s stare, second for second. Blaise watches them as they seemed to transmit information back and forth through the air between their foreheads. He waved a slow hand between them. Suddenly, both of them turn on him, as if they’d finally admitted stalemate and abruptly reached the same conclusion.
His alarm went off. Harry dragged himself out of bed, ran a comb through his hair, and slouched his way through the dusty sunlit hallways of 12 Grimmauld Place. He still hadn’t figured out how to bypass the wards, so he had to use the porch whenever he wanted to Apparate. He turned on his heel, felt the familiar crunch, and came out on the steps outside the music room. Second rehearsal.
He’s jealous of Ginny. It always seems to be so easy for her. Or maybe she’s just more unashamedly Gryffindor than he’ll ever be. But God, did she know how to get things from people. He briefly wonders if she would’ve done just as well in Slytherin.
Harry smiles at Hermione and Ron, then goes back to staring at the new glass-topped coffee table they had just bought. It looks so clean. Their entire house looks pristine, as if the future is going to be bright and wonderful, like it or not. Harry wishes he could move on just like that, get a job, start saving up pieces of metal, some steps in the middle, and finally die happy surrounded by offspring. Maybe get cremated, too, and have his wife cry as she spreads the ashes in strategically sentimental locations.
it starts off with either A) one of them being jealous of the other for either social status/skill depending on who's being jealous OR 😎 staring at them across the band
“Oh, do you object to my use of Muggle expressions? I know it’s hard for people like you to come out of the shadows, but the rest of us are progressive.”
Draco, now as much as ever, gets under his skin. When Harry had tried to suggest they act like adults and leave the past where it is, he’d become so unsettled by Malfoy’s gaze that he blanked out and blurted out whatever came to his mind. He could barely even remember what he’d said, but with his luck he’d probably managed to re-open the whole Death Eater issue. And Harry’s not as foolish as he was. He can afford to be honest with himself over the real reason why he chased Malfoy down every hallway in Hogwarts, and why today, he avoids Draco, and Draco’s unsettling habit of holding eye contact, like the plague. And if he’s
“No, you tosser, I mean about how you let Death Eaters into Hogwarts and almost killed us all, and how your family tortured Hermione in your sitting room and once again, almost killed us all!”
apologize for? You’re the one who can’t count eighth notes! There were only eighth notes! Your section only
It was all Hermione’s fault, when it came down to it, her fault for convincing him “a bit of fresh air would do him good” and “learning something new is just what he needed to get out of this funk.” Hermione’s fault that he had to spend hours with sodding Malfoy of all people.
“Oops, it’s that job interview I was talking about, see you later! I love you both!” Blaise says quickly, and makes his exit with a sweep of his dress robes.
They haven’t made much progress, what with Harry’s shenanigans and a couple other players who also seem to be complete novices. Draco drifts away to a corner of the room as the other witches and wizards begin to pack up and chat. He kneels on the carpet to dissemble his flute. He’s just shut the clasps of the case, making satisfyingly loud clicks, when Potter looms up in front of him, still wearing the stupid glasses.
Hermione smacks him with the phone, Ron makes some remark about domestic abuse, and they dissolve into bickering once again, without Harry.
“Hm. Here I was thinking you were over all that House loyalty stuff. You’re awfully defensive. You after any Slytherins yourself? That why?”
“They outed you to the entire Wizarding public, though. I still feel like there should have been consequences for that.”
honest with himself, there are other benefits to wearing sunglasses around Draco. Like now, as he stares at Draco unabashedly from behind them. Okay, admitting he’s making eyes at
When practice ends, he sighs with relief. Rather than hiding him, the sunglasses attract Draco’s attention, like blood to some kind of fashion-attuned shark. But Harry keeps wearing them anyways. Better to be bullied mercilessly for lack of style (and everything else Malfoy takes personal offence to) than to have Malfoy know why he wants to hide his eyes.
Draco stares at the dirty countertop of the flat kitchen. Dirty. It was Blaise’s turn to clean, but the bastard always managed to find excuses. At least the rest of them were trying. On the other hand, Blaise did pay most of the rent.
Harry tries to avoid looking at the coffee table but it’s no use. And he’s happy for them, he really is, why wouldn’t he be happy for them, they’re his best friends? Harry looks up just as Ron abandons the argument and steals a kiss instead, chastely pecking Hermione’s cheek, and she glances back at him with such a look of fondness that Harry thinks he’ll explode. Clean and perfect. Harry resists the urge to kick at the coffee table.
“Fine! We can have sushi! Again! As long as there’s sashimi. And Ron, you’d better not eat all the ginger like last time.”
“You play the trumpet? Rather an undignified instrument, I’ve always thought. It suits you perfectly.”
“Why do you immediately assume I’m trying to get something from you?” she says, pressing a hand against her cheek and looking innocent. Harry knows better.
“I think you should stick around to practice for a bit. You’re just as bad as you were yesterday. I could give you a few pointers.”
Of course, Malfoy wouldn’t want to be near someone who was inclined that way, savior of the wizarding world or not. What did Harry expect, really. He couldn’t even blame him when it was probably just the way Malfoy had been raised.
“Harry!” she manages to get out, “Draco Malfoy! Homophobic!” and she starts laughing again. “There’s a Prophet article every other week about which influential wizard Draco’s been gallivanting around with! Harry! He’s
“And tried to convince Snape that Love Potions had erroneously been removed from the curriculum, presumably so that you-”
Harry clenched his teeth, trying to stop himself from removing Malfoy’s smirk with a brief although preferably forceful application of the aforementioned instrument.
Hermione and Ron are still affectionately arguing, this time over whether or not the band needed to schedule more practices to be able to perform for the concert on April 2nd. Harry sighs, and walks back into their bright, airy kitchen. He’s happy as he can be, for them. It’s just a little hard sometimes.
“Yes, well, listening to you playing has probably left half the band incapacitated if not dead.” Draco snaps back. He hates himself. He doesn’t even remember why anymore - was it the cowardice that left him with a skull-and-snake scarred into his arm for the rest of his life, or was it the cowardice that makes him insult Potter even as he offers a truce, or the knowledge that really, he’s never changed-
When they finally arrived home, Harry had begun to strip his robes off in the living room, he tossed them carelessly onto the floor beside the coffee table, pulled his t-shirt over his head and started unbuckling his belt when he heard the protest from Draco, who’d entered a little slower behind him.
“Is this some sort of inside joke I don’t know about?” Draco asked, scowling at the two of them. “No mate, no joke.” Weasley said, but the smirk never faltered.
Draco let out a huff and ran a hand through his hair. “What?” he said, poking Potter’s shoulder with his index finger. “What’s so funny?”
“Didn’t you say you come here everyday?” Harry said, shaking his head in disbelief. Draco scowled in response. “The guy is right there, Potter,” he sighed, gesturing with his head towards the man who accurately resembled Harry’s original description. “Oh, cool,” replied Potter, who smiled.
They waited a further five minutes before a Goblin came out of a side door, beckoning the two of them to enter the room. Once inside, Draco took a seat in a plush armchair turning his attention to the Goblin who sat behind the desk.
Draco nodded and gestured towards his bedroom, he began to walk to the door faltering as he went to turn the handle, they hadn’t done this for a long time and Draco wasn’t sure he felt the same way about Harry as he did in Auror training, sure they’d always been close but it had accelerated over the years. “The tea wouldn’t have helped,” he said, almost a whisper before opening the door and walking inside. Not quite sure why he said that, maybe to stop how awkward he felt. “You need your pyjamas?” he asked, turning to Harry.
“So it’s like football-tennis?” she mused, once she figured the rules of Quidditch, Draco could tell she was enjoying it a whole load more, but he couldn’t help but notice her eyes following Weasley’s brutish form throughout the entire match.
It was something he thought about quite a lot, though he had also come to the conclusion that nobody would ever love him too so it really was quite a pickle he’d gotten himself into.
Harry nodded, gathered his bearings and looked towards his partner again, a silent agreement between the two of them. They walked through the large arched front door into the passageway. The smell hit him as soon as he entered, he gasped. “Fuck.” he cursed, moving slowly through the passageway. The floor was covered in blood, smears as though a body had been dragged along the carpet. As the two of them walked into a small living room, Harry’s jaw dropped. He felt the bubbling in his stomach intensify as his eyes locked to the horror in front of him.
It’s been over an hour since I received your owl, yet my hand is still shaking so badly that I can hardly hold this quill. My legs feel like they’ve been hit with a Jelly Legs Curse and I still haven’t managed to speak aloud yet. Maybe a few monosyllabic grunts, but definitely nothing that passes as an actual word! I actually think that Ron is on the verge of trying to
“Weapon.” Unspeakable Wilson cut her off, her face remained impassive, Harry always found this deeply unsettling. Wilson creeped him out most days. “They’re trying to recreate an Elder Wand.” Harry gasped, shaking his head. “Surely they can’t do that?”
Draco could hear Harry’s heart speed up, the other man looked down at Draco, a blush staining his tanned cheeks. “Ah, er, yeah,” Harry said lamely, narrowing his eyes. “I was worried.” Harry cleared his throat, wrapping an arm around Draco’s waist.
” he spat, rolling his eyes. Hermione snorted, mimicking his movements, her hair bouncing as she shook her head. “It’s ridiculous isn’t it, you spend more time with Draco than any other person alive, and vice versa, but you’re not allowed to know if he’s alright.”
Potter seemed genuinely interested in his recovery, which surprised Draco somewhat, he’d never thought himself and Potter would have a civil conversation but it went smoothly.
Draco lifted his wand towards Lockwood, his hands clenching the wood as though he’d drop it any minute. He could feel his headache increasing, his vision blurry. ‘Do not pass out’ he willed himself. “Petrificus Totalus!” he bellowed, hitting Lockwood in the back before he succumbed to the darkness.
of him criticising you. I know I’m being a nagging husband but perhaps you ought to ask Daphne and Theo to deal with the more hazardous ingredients for the foreseeable future? At least until I arrive home? I know I left for France before you could realistically have gotten pregnant this cycle but there’s always the smallest chance. Just look after yourself, Draco, please? It’s all I ask.
Once Draco and Louisa had found their seats in the arena, and procured copious amounts of chocolate and popcorn, Louisa was looking around the arena wildly, she’d never seen anything as big as this. Of course Bethany was a witch, but she’d never really taken an interest in Quidditch, so Louisa had no reason to attend a Quidditch match. “Some of those guys are really hot,” she commented, pointing up at the illuminated banners of the men playing on either side. The largest billboard hologram had to be Potter, of course it did. Shirtless too, Draco was sure his brain was going to short circuit any minute now. Who’s bloody idea was this anyway? Shirtless! On a Quidditch banner! Scandal.
“Thanks Ron,” Harry said, then he glanced over to Draco who looked a rumpled mess. He could see a line of blood which had dried onto Draco’s forehead, a purpling bruise forming at the top of his head. “Merlin, Malfoy you're bleeding,” he said. He stood up and allowed Ron to unbind his hands, immediately walking forwards towards the blonde.
“Hi Malfoy,” Potter said, sitting down next to him. Draco’s heart began to beat a little faster as he was brought out of his trance, turning his head towards the tanned man, he let out a small smile and nodded his head. Potter, who looked shocked at this response, offered a smile in return. “What are you reading?” he asked, gesturing towards the book.
Harry scanned the room and gestured for Lavender, who rose from her chair and jogged towards him. “Sir?” She asked, questioningly.
“Alright, so if that’s not Lockwood’s handwriting then who’s is it?” Harry asked, walking over to the cork board. He noted that there was a piece of parchment he’d not seen before pinned to the left hand side of the cork board, beside the picture of the crop circle. Harry frowned. “This wasn’t here before.” he mumbled, his eyes scanning the new information.
“It would appear Louisa reciprocates.” Draco said, watching his best friend with interest. Louisa was a lot like himself if he was honest, she kept people at arm’s length too - she never fell in love. Too dangerous, she said. When Louisa was sixteen she’d met a man called Vincent who she’d fallen in love with hard, she’d been with him until she was eighteen, it was only two years but enough time for her to swear off love.
“Yes Sir.” he nodded. They talked for a few more minutes and agreed they’d officially close the case so Endelton, Henderson and Brown would be none the wiser - he was to assign odd tasks for them to do as and when they came in, but from now on he’d work undercover from the department to make sure whoever it was that was the mole now knew nothing of their investigation.
Harry raised an eyebrow, looking around he rubbed the back of his neck, before turning his head towards Draco. “Draco?” he guessed. Draco frowned “What?”
“Heya Glen, thanks mate.” he reached over to the small telephone table stood beside the door and fished through it for the bank notes he left in there, purposely for the Chinese. Taking the bag, he held out the money to Glen, tipping him an extra £10. Glen winked at him and waved a hand towards Draco, who was watching with interest.
I miss you, I think Orion does too. The damned Crup has been whining since you left, I’m too soft I think - I keep feeding him whenever he looks a bit depressed. I might have to put him on a diet actually, yesterday he tried to get up off the floor and I could swear I heard a Harry style grunt. An actual grunt, from a Crup, can you believe it?
“It’s a nice one, I’ll admit.” he nodded in agreement. His thoughts, however were drifting back to Harry’s irregular behaviour. He looked like a smacked crup when he announced he had a date, it was a joke, of course, could Harry like him too?
Potter let out a snort, pulling Draco out of his comfortable musings. “What?” he asked the man, frowning. It seemed his eyes were no longer focusing properly, most unfortunate. Potter had a wide smile on his face, he looked very handsome like this.
“Hey, what’s up?” he asked, clearing his throat after. “Wondered if everything was alright.” Draco sighed, running a hand through his hair. He turned to the corkboard, cringing as he heard Harry tut. He knew Harry was frustrated with their case, but nevertheless Harry stood up and walked over to the corkboard. “Well, I suppose I’ll take these down.” he mumbled, removing the yarn twisted around many pins.
Blaise eyed the trinket box warily, sending a confused look to his friend. Once they’d explained once again where they’d found it, Unspeakable Wilson cleared her throat.
“Narcissa is in France, also I don’t think she would’ve done this.” Harry admitted, shaking his head. “She sends Draco letters a lot, we go and visit.” he ran a hand through his hair. Narcissa Malfoy was a complicated woman and although she loved Draco dearly he felt every time he saw her that she could see straight through him, to his soul. Narcissa had stated one day whilst they wandered through the vineyard together she knew Harry loved Draco. He’d looked at her quickly, a blush staining his cheeks. From then on, she cast him knowing looks, or he caught a small smile whenever she watched the two of them.
It stands to reason, I think, that you got pregnant so quickly. Whenever we’ve cast magic together or brewed potions the results have always been spectacular haven’t they? We’ll have to be a little bit careful in the future though, love: I read in one of Hermione’s books that once a wizard has gotten pregnant, their second baby can happen awfully quickly. Something to do with the fertility potions remaining in your magical core. The language was all a bit wordy for me, but you get the picture. I mean,
“Right well, where was I?” she asked again, sitting down beside Harry again. Harry cleared his throat “The pumpkins.” Olive smiled again, she seemed like such a happy lady, it warmed Harry’s heart - somehow she reminded him of Molly a little. “That bloody Jim, he lives not far from here he’s been after my pumpkins for months!” she exclaimed, eyes wide. “I bet it was him!”
“Care to explain this?” Draco said, gesturing towards the two of them. That annoying sheepish look sat on Weasley’s face once again, as though he didn’t have two brain cells to rub together and the cogs were grinding around in his brain trying to come up with a passable sentence.
“Well, we have one more connection I suppose.” Harry sighed, standing up and wandering over to his wooden cork board, he’d brought it in when they moved in to the office, he found it helped. “I still don’t get how they’re connected though.” he stared at the crop circle, it took up the majority of the field and was an absolute pain in the arse to fix. The farmer hadn’t seen anything out of the ordinary and it had occurred overnight, they’d checked all the outbuildings of the farm for clues and ran extensive traces, but it was as if nobody had ever been there. The same for the older lady who had been murdered in her home in Diagon Alley. It caused widespread panic and the Prophet had reported for weeks that the next Dark Lord was imminent, the population of the Wizarding World were never going to get over that threat, which stressed Harry to no ends.
The first time it happened, Draco had been sitting alone at the Slytherin table in the Great Hall. It was a frosty morning, he’d woken up frozen and not been able to warm up since, his nightmares had been increasing tenfold and the tossing and turning he seemed to do in his sleep left for a lack of blankets. Two pieces of buttered toast left uneaten on his plate before him, his stomach queasy.
- Pansy told me she was playing bloody footsie with her under the table. It seems this whole date thing will happen way sooner than anticipated. However, I really don’t think you should become a journalist Harry, could you imagine yourself hounding other people for stories? You’d probably apologise for coming within thirty feet of someone. I think you're probably best suited to your current position, even if I hate it.
There’s something about that giant’s reassuring presence that reverts me straight back to being a teenager. Poor Nev will no doubt have been given a full rundown of each and every dragon that we saved by now: I have, of course, sent Hagrid a full report. It was definitely the Horntail that gave out team the most trouble. Before you panic, there’s only a tiny patch of hair that’s been scorched off my already untidy head.
He wasn’t that interested in whatever vegetable Mrs. Dunn had stolen today, nor was he interested in the prospect of a break in, but he was definitely interested in the crop circle. He quickly read the report of the crop circle, quite small in a small village just outside York - however, it was quite close to the last one which peaked his interest even more.
“Don’t you like chocolate?” Potter asked, he’d never once left his side, which Draco had decided to over analyse the entire time.
Biting the inside of his mouth, Draco nodded. “It’s okay, I wasn’t waiting long,” he lied, he didn’t want Potter to know he’d gotten up early, showered, pampered himself before getting there early, he wasn’t entirely sure
“That’s not how you buy pizza, Potter.” he scowled, wandering over to the kitchen. Their apartment was a breezy open plan, although it was above a dominos Draco had worked tirelessly to extend the apartment, they’d bought it several months after renting it and it now resembled nothing of the rundown dingy place it once was. The walls were a soft cream colour, the entire flat floored with laminate. Floor to ceiling windows adorned the area, the kitchen dark wood and marble tops - Draco was proud of the kitchen, he’d learnt to cook pretty relentlessly. There were so many times Harry would come home and see Draco leaning over a cookbook, scowling and swearing about that bloody Jamie Oliver.
Potter looked amused, he lay the pizza boxes down on the floor in front of the television and sat with his back up against the end of the bed. Draco looked down at the display, a pang of sadness shooting through him. He always wanted someone who would sit and watch endless amounts of muggle movies with him, eat junk food, pet his cat, buy zoflora, you know normal stuff? He’d always resigned himself to the fact he’d marry a muggle. Not that it was a bad thing, but he wondered if the person he married would be resentful they couldn’t cast magic.
Harry waited for about fifteen minutes before he got impatient and wandered down the corridor. Hermione followed him, turning her head as they passed each door. A nauseous feeling settled in the pit of her stomach, she’d been here before. This was the ward where people who were in critical condition were placed. A year ago, one of the Unspeakables she worked with - a good friend of Rose Wilson had been brought here after a raid went wrong. Of course the Unspeakables don’t usually get there until everything is over, or generally not at all. They’d entered a back room assumed to have been checked where their colleague had been hit by a nasty curse.
“You’ll be fine.” Harry whispered, his comforting words eased the nausea a little, but he couldn’t help but feel on edge. The Goblin took the key, and after a few moments the vault opened. Draco swallowed.
“Tomorrow?” Draco asked, as during the time they’d spent talking the man had disappeared, presumably down the alleyway in question. “Tomorrow.” repeated Harry.
I can’t tell you where I am- that would compromise you and I’m not willing to take any chances on your safety- but I’m still based in northern France. Millie, Ron and I are holed up in a filthy safe-house with only each other for company. Suffice to say, once I’m back home I’m intending to spend several hours letting you cleanse and groom me with the myriad of posh potions that you so adore. Then I’m intending to spend several more hours enjoying your company within our soft, white linen bedsheets… How much of that will be spend sleeping I will leave to your very vivid imagination!
There was a distinct difference between Draco and Harry when they got up in the morning, for one Harry would shout and swear at his alarm, whereas Draco would just turn the alarm off as he got out of bed. Harry would likely fall out of bed and after yelling obscenities for about twenty minutes, you’d hear sound of his en-suite shower. Draco was naturally always ready before Harry, even if Harry put very little effort into his outward appearance.
Here we are with Chapter 2. Next chapter will be uploaded around the same time tomorrow. Hope you like it! Thank you for the kudos guys! <3
“Do you know why Seamus and Dean ran off earlier?” he asked Draco, slightly confused as to what the other man was doing. Draco shook his head and frowned, slipping down from atop the cabinet. “No, let me check the reports.” he said, knitting his eyebrows together.
Draco smirked at her, turning the wheel as they drove round the roundabout, signalling off at his junction. “Buckle your tits Louisa, you’re about to see some hot sweaty men with wood between their legs.” He winked.
Infinite possibilities, maybe somewhere out there, there was a Draco Malfoy who married Harry Potter. Draco scoffed and shook his head. Standing up, he let out a sigh and pulled back the duvet of his bed, slipping inside.
Kingsley let out a sigh, shuffling the parchment around on his desk. “Scan the artifact, Zabini I trust you can inspect the vault without assistance?” Blaise nodded curtly. “Right, well dismissed, we will reconvene tomorrow.”
Standing up, Draco brushed off his Auror robes and walked over to Harry’s desk, standing in front of it. He waved his hand in front of Harry’s face and smirked. Harry looked up at Draco with a blank expression on his face, suddenly his features changed and he offered Draco a warm smile.
“You know he’s single, yes?” Hermione pushed, batting her eyelashes at Draco, who scowled in response. “Once again, I’ll pass, thank you.” Draco said, picking his cup of hot chocolate up. Hermione let out an exasperated sigh and leant back in her chair, staring at Draco thoughtfully.
Harry, on the other hand was having a few more problems than Draco, he heard the soft rise and fall of Draco’s breathing. He rubbed his thumb in a circular motion around the back of Draco’s hand, he felt restless. If he went to sleep, he’d miss an entire night of this.
They arrived outside a quaint cottage on the outskirts of Hogsmeade, quite close to where Hermione and Ron currently lived. You could tell immediately that Mrs. Dunn was quite the fan of growing vegetables, in fact he would go as much to say she was fanatical. Her entire garden was alive. The cottage itself quite small, it reminded him somewhat of Hagrid’s hut, just a little bigger.
Scouring the reports he had laid out on his desk, Draco picked up one that was set aside and frowned, scanning the words. It seemed that someone had placed it there in a hurry but didn’t want it to be mixed up in the active reports. Draco murmured a quick spell to check there was nothing amiss, before turning his attention back to Harry. He had a slightly worried look on his face, that Harry instantly recognised.
Harry stood at the doorway, his eyes scanning Draco’s bedroom. It didn’t really look much different to when they’d originally decorated it, there were odd things that was different. Draco had insisted on the four poster bed stood proud in the middle of his back wall, an amethyst canopy draped elegantly over the dark stain wood, Harry smiled. He had assumed Draco would choose green but when they chose the colours he was impressed. Draco’s walls were cream coloured and his carpet the same shade of purple as his canopy. He’d chosen not to have curtains round the bed, however. A plush white rug sat to the right of his bed and the entire right wall was dedicated to Draco’s in built wardrobes, a giant floor length mirror attached at the middle.
“Harry?” he called out, his eyes still adjusting to the darkness of the room. He couldn’t make out any defining features of the room, just that the ground he was sat on seemed to be broken shards of concrete, the floor powdering beneath his fingertips. “Yeah, I’m here,” came the distant reply of Harry.
“Where’s that tea you promised me anyway?” Harry asked through a mouthful of food. “You better not have lied about that you know, it was a deal breaker.” he grinned. Draco rolled his eyes and stood up, walking towards the kitchen. He washed his hands under the tap and set to preparing Harry a cup of tea. After he’d finished, he walked back to the sofa and handed the cup to the raven haired man, who wiped his hands on the sides of his jeans.
Draco wandered over to the sofa and sat down beside Harry, throwing his snacks onto the coffee table. Chewing his lower lip in thought, he turned his head towards Harry and took in a deep breath, exhaling slowly. “I don’t think it was the paper that cursed me,” he said, knitting his brows together. “The box, the one in my father's vault, I felt something on it, I used wards but if it was blood magic it would’ve gotten through.” he said.
“Just,” Draco looked down at the hand placed on his lap, he covered her hand with his own and smiled softly. “Nevermind, it’s just difficult after all this time.” he gave her hand a gentle squeeze before moving both of his hands to the steering wheel, he turned the key in the ignition and reversed out the space.
Draco narrowed his eyes, as the door opened Mrs. Dunn stood with a cat in her arms. A big ginger cat that reminded Harry somewhat of Crookshanks. “Hello boys!” she exclaimed. She looked at them with a suspicious look, eyebrow quirked.
“So I’m not dead then,” Draco said, narrowing his eyes. When he’d woken up he had two Healers standing over him with the weirdest expressions on their faces. To start with, Draco was sure he would get a lecture about his past Death Eater activities, or how reckless or idiotic he’d been, but instead they’d immediately looked relieved, checked him over and told him they’d contact Harry Potter. Of course they would, Draco could imagine how the dark haired man would’ve been when he found Draco unconscious.
“If you were awake you’d say something clever like,” he began to use his best Draco impression “You idiot, you can’t use that as a threat, if I don’t wake up then how the bloody hell can I watch television?” Harry laughed a little, but his expression soon changed to a scowl. “Draco wake up, Merlin what the fuck am I going to do without you?” he huffed, slouching back into his chair. He leant his head back staring up at the clinically white ceiling. “I can’t believe I’m sitting in St Mungos and I’m not the one injured,” he sighed. “It’s always me that gets fucked over, why does it have to be you?”
“Morning everyone.” he said evenly, nodding his head towards Seamus who was resting on the edge of his own desk. Dean close beside him. Beside Lavender sat Henderson. Draco cleared his throat and nodded towards Dean and Seamus. “Morning Sir.” Endelton said, sitting to the right of him.
Louisa blushed, ducking her head down. “Yeah you could say that.” she smiled. “Ron and Harry have gone off to do a match, they left pretty early though.” she shrugged. Draco nodded, that explained quite a lot, though he did wonder why Potter hadn’t told him about that.
Admittedly, I have to agree. I didn’t realise it would happen this fast either. I spoke with the regular Healer, Trish. You know the one I’m talking about, curly brown hair - reminds me of an unkempt Hermione in second year? Well Trish told me apparently when you’re
Unspeakable Wilson snorted, but nodded. Hermione rolled her eyes and stood up, smiling at Harry. “Thank you, if we find anything shareable we will let you know.” Wilson stood up and exited quickly, robes billowing behind her.
Here's chapter 3. Hope you're enjoying the story so far, thank you for the kudos and comments, they mean the world to me. <3
You’ll be happy to know that all the breeding dragons were rescued safely, lovely. They’ve all been transported to Charlie’s sanctuary to love what we all hope will be much more joyful lives. I do, however, take your point about Hagrid! I know I ought to be more discreet when I talk to him but I find when I’m there, sharing those God-awful rock cakes, that I simply cannot help myself.
“Mm, Mrs. Dunn has lost three of her prized pumpkins, apparently it’s quite the scandal in the Wizarding vegetable competition community.” the sarcasm and amusement in Draco’s voice made Harry laugh. “Wizarding vegetable competition community.” Harry repeated, shaking his head. “Who in the bloody fuck made that ridiculously long name, and also, who the fuck decides that growing vegetables is a really great hobby?”
“Hi Lav, how are you doing?” asked Henderson, who was walking up the corridor as Lavender left. Turning her head in Jeanette’s direction, Lavender smiled. “Hello,” she walked towards Jean and wrapped her arms around her, pulling her into a tight hug. “I’m okay.” she whispered, burying her head in the other woman’s hair. “Harry is devastated.” sighing, Lavender pulled back a little, her eyes meeting Jean’s.
Draco rolled his eyes, a naughty smile on his face. “No, it’s not dick, though I wouldn’t mind spying one of those if I’m honest,” he said, trying to gauge Potter’s reaction. The dark haired wizard raised a challenging eyebrow, shifting a little closer to Draco.
Since returning for Eighth Year, Draco mostly spent his time alone, mulling over the failures of his life. With his friends not returning with him and only a handful of Slytherin’s left, he sat at the end of the table closest to the doors.
After two hours of trying to puzzle out sheet music, exhausted and discouraged, he came to the realization that music would never be his forte. He had also realized that being unable to hate Draco wasn’t the trouble at all. Instead of returning home, he took the Knight Bus to Diagon Alley and bought a pair of sunglasses.
“For one thing, I’m like…” Harry does some mental calculations, “seventy percent sure he’s homophobic.”
and said, “Oh, I simply required a change of pace,” flapping his hand around like it was every day that former Death Eaters went around joining marching bands for Muggle charity. Then, Malfoy had glanced at the instrument case Harry was still mindlessly holding in his shocked confusion.
Their break-up had been mutually agreed upon. Ginny hated the 'blandness of a long-term relationship,' and Harry refused to tie her down like that, even though she’d said she would be perfectly happy being his beard. Besides, in the spirit of Gryffindorness, Harry would rather not hide his sexuality away like that.
Draco whacks Harry across the face with his flute for the fifth time as they change positions. (“Oh dear, not again. So clumsy of me.”) He also finds time to whisper into Harry’s ear in the chaos of the transition, insulting Harry every chance he gets. (“The entire ensemble plays A sharp in bar 23, not A natural,
Harry shakes himself out of it. An admittedly bitter internal rant. But it’s just because of the coffee table. That’s all. That bloody coffee table. The thing inspires true vitriol in him, it just looks so disgustingly smug, what with its stubby little wooden legs and its
Lavender walked through the side door, her eyes resting on Harry. “What’s wrong with him? Is he hit?” She asked frantically. Dean shook his head, patting Harry’s shoulder.
Clearing his throat, Harry gestured towards Dean, who Harry assumed had absolutely nothing left in his stomach at this point. “What’s happened?” he asked Seamus, his voice faltering slightly. Draco placed a hand on his shoulder, it was his way of providing comfort.
“Ready?” He asked, giving Draco the goofiest grin, he could feel his heart melt a little for this strange man.
I’ll await your second letter, I’ve just reread this and I don’t actually think it’s worth sending in the first place. I’m apparently ‘ridiculously hormonal’ according to our fabulous Pansy Parkinson, the cow. The snarky bitch even had the pure audacity to call me ‘rounded’ as well. Apparently her date with Ginny went well, she seems in high spirits, glowing even. I told her they should’ve gotten together ages ago but she gave me that look, you know which one I’m talking about.
Harry didn’t even bother with their usual argument on who would phone, he just picked the phone up and ordered the pizza. He knew he needed to talk to Draco about everything, but somehow he couldn’t bring himself to do it, it wasn’t like Draco to be this quiet, instead Harry sat down on the sofa and waited.
Louisa immediately followed suit, brushing down her skin tight jeans from invisible dust. Pushing her own sunglasses up her nose, she moved quickly around the car and stood beside Draco, folding her arms.
Louisa nodded in agreement, once they were both back at the car, Draco pressed the button on his car key to unlock the Mercedes, slipping into the drivers side. Once Louisa had gotten in and fastened her seatbelt, Draco let out a sigh.
“I thought we could have pizza and watch a movie? I brought a few with me,” Harry smiled, waving the boxes in his other hand, Draco raised an eyebrow, he had absolutely no idea why Potter was here really, they weren’t friends.
“What the fuck are we going to do?” mumbled Seamus. Dean shook his head in response, unable to reply. “It seems you’ve found yourselves stuck here, Auror Finnigan.” Lockwood spat, his mouth twisted into a sick smile.
“We’re getting absolutely nowhere with this,” whined Harry. They were once again sat outside Thistle, drinking what Draco described as lacklustre tea - Harry on the other hand actually really liked the tea, and the gaudy aesthetic was growing on him. The witch that owned the Cafe seemed to take a lot of interest in Draco, which amused Harry to no end.
"Waiting for me?" came a voice beside him, which startled Draco so much he'd dropped his notebook. "Fuck sake, Potter," Bending down, he retrieved the notebook and scowled at the man. "Are you trying to give me a fucking heart attack?"
I think Pansy has finally mustered enough courage up to ask Ginny on a date too, I went out with her last night for drinks (don’t worry, I had orange juice) I think she may have been drinking enough wine for two to compensate on my lack of drunkenness, well finally I got her to admit she does like Ginny, so she’s going to ask her to the Ministry gala in two months. I suppose two months is better than the eight we’ve spent trying to get the two of them together, right?
The conversation went a little stale, only rescued by the delivery of their food. It didn’t seem like he was going to get Louisa away from Weasley anytime soon, so he better get used to the feeling of unease. Picking up his knife and fork, he began to cut his sausages.
“Said about twenty minutes.” he mumbled, walking towards the kitchen. He picked up his cup of tea Draco had made him and sipped on it, his eyes rolling in delight. “Merlin you make a sexy cuppa.” Draco snorted. “Well at least something about me is sexy.” Draco muttered, walking towards the sofa. “Hey I didn’t say that was the only thing!” Harry laughed.
Weasley walked up to Louisa and gave her a quick peck on the cheek, causing the woman’s blush to darken. “Hello” she smiled up at him, receiving a blinding smile in response.
They sat in silence for around thirty minutes before only the sound of their ragged breaths sent Harry into sort of a half panic; he felt unbelievably claustrophobic these days. “I hope someone comes to save us,” Harry said. He began rolling his shoulders to get the knots out of his back as his hands were bound behind his back, causing his shoulders to stiffen up.
“Err…” he mumbled, slightly embarrassed. Draco rolled his eyes and slid into the bed, still clothed. “I was making a joke, Potter.” the blond mumbled, laying on his back. Draco felt the bed shift and continued to stare up at the ceiling. Harry lay down and let out a sigh of relief, and quite a loud yawn.
“Well you make a family and you move them into houses, then you control that Sim which is like a person and they do like, everyday stuff, you know? Like dishes and laundry, and you get them to marry and have kids and level up their careers and stuff,” Harry said, beginning to pick at the skin beside his thumbnail.
Second: I know that three days without word was too long. You’ll have been anxious, though you must know that I always take every precaution. I care too much about our lives together not to come back home to you in one piece. Much of those three days were spent undercover with Mils, using polyjuice to convince the gang of our secret identities. Don’t worry though! Ron has a remote viewing spell on us the entire time and if we were compromised, we could be out of the there in seconds. I have a tricky little Portkey disguised as a ring. I keep it in my pocket, near to my heart.
Sending off a quick text as he waited at a red light, he let out a groan. Draco needed to talk to Hermione Granger. It wasn’t something he tended to do that often, she was a little more than he could deal with at the best of times, but nevertheless he knew he had to put his mind at rest.
smile Draco had ever seen aimed at him from Potter, it wasn’t that he had a bad smile, it was that it was very unexpected.
Potter began to ask him questions about the PTSD support group, why he went, if he’d done any other therapy, to which Draco explained all about his psychiatrist appointments. Because Draco had been stripped of magic, he struggled terribly. Part of his choice to integrate with muggle was his decision to see a muggle therapist.
“Lockwood filled this report out.” Draco noticed, although the signature at the bottom was Lockwood’s he could tell some of this report was written by Endelton. “If he was working for Celtic Serpent then, he could have left some of the information we need now, out of it.”
“I wondered if maybe I could assist with the cabin?” she asked quietly, looking down at her feet. Harry thought for a moment, but shook his head. “Actually, I have another task for you - I need you and Henderson to go to the murder victims house, we found something at the crop circle area, I want to double check all the areas just in case we missed something there too.” Lavender’s eyes widened and she nodded. “Yes sir, does that mean we’ll be going back to the warehouse too?” she asked hesitantly. Harry thought for a moment then nodded slowly. “Yes, I still have the warehouse secured, but that’ll be tomorrow now.”
“Did you have a nice time with Harry?” Louisa asked, looking at him with that searching look he knew too well. His emotions must’ve been written all over his face, but nevertheless he shrugged his shoulders. “Yeah, fine.” he said, waving his hand.
Draco turned his head towards Louisa, immediately scrunching his face up. What he didn’t want to witness today, or ever for that matter was his best friend snogging the living daylights out of Ronald Weasley. Actually, he never wanted to think of
“So?” asked Draco, who’d begun chewing his lip a little harder, though he stopped once he could taste the metallic flavour of blood, something that seemed to become more and more familiar with Draco. However, he wasn’t sure when he had developed this anxious tic.
“Right well, we could start by trying to find out his name - have you still got that invisibility cloak?” asked Draco, frowning. Draco thought back to the times where he’d caught Potter following him, and perhaps the amount of times he’d just let him. “Why didn’t you join up with the Aurors?” Draco asked abruptly, he wasn’t even sure why he asked, it was almost like word vomit. Draco had actively tried to avoid that topic, but it seemed his curiosity got the better of him.
Brought out of his thoughts by the return of Draco, he looked up at the other man with a smile. Draco’s perfect hair was now mussed, which Harry had come to learn was a habit the blonde had of running his hand through it when he was stressed. It was weird to see a dishevelled Draco, he’d seen it thousands of times before but it never got old. “Problems?” he asked, raising an eyebrow at the scowl on Draco’s face.
Draco smiled, picking the remote up from the arm of the sofa he pressed the button to turn it on and let out a sigh. “Well, there better be something good on then.”
“Before he left, however. He burnt a mark in to his desk.” Kingsley held up a photograph of the celtic serpent, his eyes studying Harry with intent. Harry’s eyes widened, he stood up and leant over to take the picture. Studying the mark, it was definitely the same mark they’d encountered recently, not a piece out of place. Harry would know, he’d spent the better part of hours and hours studying that blasted mark.
The motion gave Draco all sorts of unwanted mental images, well he was sure they were unwanted. “The other person who works on the desk with me?” Draco suggested, smirking at Potter. Harry just laughed. “Touche.”
“Fucking hell you’re a dirty bastard!” he shouted, wiping his hand on his robes. “Dirty, dirty bastard. Who the fuck licks someone?”
Harry Potter was not exactly short of dates, but he never found anyone that lured him in unawares. Only knowing this new strange wonderful Malfoy for two days, he wondered what the future had in store for him. It was truly a strange week.
Dean was now sitting on the edge of the curb, his head in his hands. The contents of his stomach cleaned up from the pavement, Seamus had a careful hand on his partner's shoulder, rubbing small soothing circles on his back. “I can’t believe what I just saw.” Harry admitted.
Once they arrived outside the vault, Harry took Draco’s hand intertwining their fingers. Draco looked at him, his eyebrows knitted together. They did not do this usually, he had the anxiety of what lay behind the large door in front of him, and what the hell was going on between himself and Harry all at once.
Oh Harry, whenever you mention that blasted cupboard my heart aches for you. I promise you no matter what we will always be a family, whether we have to adopt or find someone to help us, we will have our own little family together.
wouldn’t mind. You know what I’m like, Draco. I’d love a whole Quidditch team of children running underfoot but I expect that you’d have a few things to say on
Draco reached into his pocket and produced the key to the vault, which he’d received back off the Goblin before himself and Harry had exited Gringotts. He handed it over to Hermione without a second thought. Hermione smiled. “Thank you, Draco.” she said.
“Oh?” Potter replied, a slight smile forming on his lips. “Why would you want to see me, Malfoy?” he asked, his eyes flicked towards Louisa once again, Draco frowned. He wasn’t surprised Potter would find Louisa attractive, the woman could pull any man she wanted to by just clicking her bloody fingers. It was a trait Draco wished he had for himself. The last Draco had actually heard from Potter was he was dating Ginny Weasley, who was also part of a Quidditch team. Holyhead Harpies, as he remembered it.
As soon as Harry found himself able to stand, he was apparating to St. Mungo’s. The sickly feeling returned as his eyes adjusted to the bright white light of the hospital. Making his way down the corridors with impressive speed, he flew around the corner narrowly missing a Healer, he quickly apologised before slamming through the doors to the ward Draco was currently residing on. Unsure if it was the anxious panic attack he’d had earlier, coupled with the fact he’d hardly eaten anything and a hint of worry for Draco, but he tried to put that all out of his mind.
. It wasn’t that Draco had his head buried deep within the sand for the last two years, it was more he lived in blissful ignorance. Draco was aware he didn’t really need a job, but he’d sought out employment at Blue Waves for something to do more than anything else. It wasn’t as if he didn’t know anything about Potter, he heard this and that from Hermione, but well..
“Hello everyone and thank you for coming,” Harry nodded, gesturing towards his fellow colleagues, friends and family. “Unfortunately, it’s not under great circumstances. Today, we discharge Ronald Weasley with honours - Injured in the line of duty, Ronald performed fantastic work for the Auror department and Ministry of Magic throughout his time with us.” He bowed his head, pushing back the tears that threatened to surface. The curse damage to Ron’s right leg ran deep, it had taken two weeks for him to wake up, which caused deep stress and anxiety within the Weasley family, dredging up old wounds from the War, as well as scaring Hermione and Molly half to death.
Once Harry had reached Draco, he immediately fell to his knees and placed a gentle hand on Draco’s shoulder. “Are you alright?” he whispered, his eyes immediately settling on the gash and the seeping blood painting his blond hair. “Merlin Draco..” he reached out, but immediately withdrew his hand when he noticed Draco’s preemptive wince.  Endelton and Henderson had reached them and stood beside Dean and Seamus, wands raised.
“Harry,” he started, making his way towards the table with two loaded plates of Spaghetti Bolognese, he placed one plate on each of the black placemats, then walked back to the kitchen to retrieve the platter of garlic bread. He levitated the two full glasses of cola he’d filled and they gently dropped onto the table. Placing the platter down in the middle of the table, Draco sat down on the seat opposite Harry and bit his lip.
I love you too, so very much. I can’t begin to put into words how much I miss you. We’ve never been apart this long before, I feel I’ve gone a bit neurotic in the time. I went to see the Healers today, I’ve had three panic attacks and I’ve thrown up quite a lot. They’ve done some tests on me so I’ll find out later today I suppose. I'm sorry for including that, I know you're going to be worried about me now. But do not worry, I promise I'll be fine as long as you are.
Kingsley pursed his lips, he looked thoughtful. His purple robes billowed around him, it reminded Harry often of Dumbledore, the way Kingsley held himself. “What about Narcissa Malfoy, it was her husbands vault after all.” he frowned, rubbing his chin. Harry turned his head towards the Minister, he wasn’t sure Narcissa would be capable of casting a curse on a piece of parchment, it was complicated. When they’d entered the Department of Mysteries not ten minutes earlier, Harry had immediately sought out Hermione and briefed her on the situation. Hermione had taken the parchment to Wilson, who was an expert at curse detection. She’d ascertained the parchment did hold a curse, but whatever it had been it would’ve transferred to the recipient as soon as they read it. Wilson concluded there was nothing left on the parchment itself.
to end up with a muggle.” he said. Draco wasn’t sure whether he ought to be offended or not, after all the man in front of him put up with his constant jibes at his own best friend for years. Although Draco had made quite decent friends with Granger, he still had the awkward conversation regarding his past indiscretions.
After they’d finished their food and were thoroughly stuffed, Harry shifted on the sofa to relieve the tension in his stomach and ended up with his head on Draco’s shoulder. No word of protest from the other man, he held it there and closed his eyes gently, marveling in being so close to him. Draco always smelled amazing, even after he’d been on the field for hours and sweated up a storm. Ron had once made a comment on how Draco smelt after he’d been working all day - to which Luna had said she read in the Muggle magazine Cosmopolitan that if you enjoyed the smell of someone’s sweat it meant you were physically compatible. Harry had blushed scarlet and Draco had avoided his gaze for several hours after.
Landing square in the middle of his and Harry’s giant shared office, Draco walked towards his desk and sat down on the chair, rolling forwards. He began to check the memos, frowning at a couple and scribbling a reply to most of them. One stuck out, however. It was on a pink muggle sticky note, which was immediately suspicious to Draco since through the Ministry memos you were only allowed to send official Ministry stamped parchment.
knew that they would be perfect for each other, but it always felt like a case of convincing them of the fact. Actually, I do seem to remember a certain blond wizard that took a lot of persuasion to meet for that first dinner date in Muggle London. Just how many romance novels did I need to send to your Apothecary? I lost count.
It was odd, the majority of people seemed to just avoid him like he had the black death. “Do you want to go to Honeydukes, Draco?” Hermione asked, offering him a small smile.
“We’re going to die in here,” Draco sighed. It amused him a little when he thought about it; he’d survived his father, Bellatrix, he’d survived Voldemort and the War, he’d survived being a Death Eater, he’d survived the Room of Requirement and the burning fiendfyre - yet Draco Malfoy was destined to die in a supply cupboard in Knockturn Alley next to Harry fucking Potter of all people.
, I agree about that letter about his favourite dinner. Shepherd’s Pie wasn’t it?!) but nobody in the DMLE is finer at tracking and information gathering spells. As for Bulstrode, there’s no one better to have beside you in a duel. She is more than brilliant at defensive magic and she always has my back.
“I apologise, Mr. Potter.” the man stammered, passing the chart in his hands towards Hermione, who took it willingly. She began to scan the chart, eyes widening. Harry rubbed the back of his neck, waiting for her response. “Mr. Malfoy is stable, but he’s not out of the woods yet.”
"There's a guy that meets there every day at about 2, he's selling illegal potions and I thought I'd investigate." Harry put simply, his eyes fixed on Draco. Sniffing, Draco turned to Harry and laughed. "You're not an Auror Potter, why are you investigating illegal potion sales?" Harry shrugged in response. Pushing himself off the wall, he straightened up and bit down on his lower lip. "It's not as if I have anything else to do." he mumbled, narrowing his eyes.
“What do you mean we can’t interview them?!” exclaimed Lavender, she stood in the doorway of Kingsley’s office, frazzled and tired but she refused to budge - to go home. Lavender had never seen such a destroyed Harry Potter in her life. Not at Hogwarts, not during training, never. This was important and she would see it through to the end.
“Yes, I suppose that’ll be fine,” she grumbled, nodding her head. Kingsley could tell she wasn’t thoroughly pleased with the idea, but nonetheless accepting. “I’d like to go back to the hospital and see how Harry is doing.” she announced. After nodding his head, Kingsley gestured for her to go. Lavender offered a small smile, bowed her head and exited the doorway, closing the door behind her.
“Stupefy!” Seamus bellowed, hitting the person in front full pelt in the chest, he propelled backwards hitting the grass with impressive force. Seamus turned his attention to the man to the left, who seemed to be coming towards him. He quickly cast another Protego around him and shuffled towards Dean. “I’m going to need your help.” he shouted, eyes wild.
When they left Gringotts, trinket box safely shielded and removed from the vault, they apparated to the Ministry and immediately made their way to Kingsley’s office. It was about 6pm now, so Harry knew most of the Auror’s would’ve gone home. Once stood outside the office, Harry gently knocked on the door. Hearing the boom of Kingsley’s voice, they entered together and shut the door behind them.
“There you are, I called the Aurors as soon as you didn’t come home;  they let me come with since Hermione is with the -” He looked over to Draco and immediately shut his mouth.
“I understand this is your father’s vault.” Unspeakable Wilson said, she looked at Draco for a few moments, as though lost in thought.
“I’m going home, we’ll try again tomorrow,” Draco said quietly, standing up from the table and nodding towards Potter, who sat frowning, and apparated away.
After briefing their team on their findings, Draco, Harry and Seamus apparated into the middle of the field. They’d cleaned the area and obliviated the farm owners, but they’d definitely missed something. The outbuildings were clear, which frustrated Harry to no ends, but they’d definitely missed something. “What could it be?” asked Seamus, who had immediately started casting to detect spell traces. “No idea.” Harry sighed.
It simply said, ‘Malfoy and Endelton are to die tonight, traitors.’ the twists and turns reminded him of Tom Riddle’s diary, Harry couldn’t help the sickening feeling in the pit of his stomach. He wondered if Endelton had received a similar piece. The thought that Draco’s own mother would’ve done something like this was absurd. He thought back to that night in the forest, his skin prickling. Although it was complicated, he was sure Narcissa was a competent witch. The thought of it being her made him feel uneasy however.
Draco rolled his eyes as she turned her back and sent a wicked smirk Harry’s way. “Touch the chocolate digestives and I’ll break your fingers, Potter.” he sauntered in the house ahead of him, leaving Harry at the doorstep. “Oh no you don’t Malfoy!” he shouted as he ran in after him.
How dare you insinuate I would do such a thing, Orion is definitely sleeping on his dusty disused pet bed and nowhere near your side of the bed. I have not, nor have I ever used a scourgify on our bed, this is lies and blasphemy.
Harry walked in, shut the door behind him and tossed the parchment down on Kingsley’s desk. The man frowned, picked it up and began to read.
Well, I’m going to go finish my batch of Pepper Up now before it all blows up in my face. Please, for the love of Merlin stay safe, I find myself worrying most days I’ll get an owl you’ve been killed or something.
Ron had joined him several minutes later, placing a kiss on his wife's cheek. “I was talking to George and I’m going to help him in the shop.” he announced, turning his head towards Harry who’s eyes widened. “That’s great Ron, you always said you wanted to help somehow.” he was rewarded with a grin and a slap on the back. “Yeah mate, I’m chuffed.”
“He’s awake?” Was the first thing Harry said to Lana. Nodding her head, she gestured towards Draco’s room and smiled. Harry let out a breath of relief as he entered Draco’s room, he was sat up staring out the window, lost in thought, still as pale as he was but alive,
They began to walk forwards slowly, making sure they made as little noise as possible. When they stopped, their eyes settled on a small wooden hunting cabin in the middle of the forest. Hearing a yelp from the right of him, Harry quickly turned, his eyes darting around wildly. “Expelliarmus!” a voice Harry immediately recognised as Draco’s shouted, Harry began bounding towards the noise, Seamus following behind him.
Harry bit his lower lip and unfolded it, scanning the words on the paper. His eyes widened, he shot up out of his chair and ran towards the office door, pulling it open with such force it almost propelled shut again. “WHERE’S ENDELTON?” he bellowed, moving through the department quickly.
“I don’t know, a year maybe?” came Draco’s nonchalant reply. “I come here everyday, I haven’t a clue why,” he added, looking over to Potter, who was eyeing him with interest now. It was rather odd, he’d sit on the chair outside this ridiculously vile cafe staring at other people, but nobody ever really paid any attention to him. It was slightly unsettling having another person's eyes glued to him.
Draco stood glued to the spot, watching the exchange with interest. Lavender was a damn good Auror but they didn’t converse much, he had the feeling that the girl wasn’t much of a chatter. Which amused him considering how vocal she was at Hogwarts. “Right, what’ve we got today then?” Draco asked, turning his head towards Dean who smiled.
Running a hand through his hair, Draco looked down at his sad excuse for a plate of pancakes and sighed. The past few nights he really had not been able to sleep, tossing and turning for hours. It was driving him a little bit insane if he was honest.
Sorry. I’ve just read that last bit back to myself. I sound a bit sentimental, don’t I? I’m not going to
I have to admit though, I did laugh at your description of Pansy’s drunken confession. It’s hardly news, is it love? Pans goes the most appealing shade of pink every time that Ginny even mentions Quidditch in passing conversation. No doubt, by the time your owl returns with this letter there will be more gossip on that front, so do please keep me informed. I want to hear every detail. I can see the
“Another day in the life as a fucking Auror.” Draco whined, his head dropping down on to Harry’s shoulder. Harry pressed a kiss to his forehead, stunning Draco. They stood like that for about five minutes, Draco’s thoughts going wild.
For weeks, reporters had stood outside the Ministry trying to get an interview with Harry - stating he had to find and neutralise the next Dark Lord as he’d done previously. He hated the hero worship and often wondered if he’d gotten his job so quickly and easily because of the fact, but he knew deep down he did incredible work. His team were the best there had been for years and their case completion rates were near impeccably fast.
Harry had sat back down on the linoleum floor, his boots squeaking as he slid down. He kept shifting his boot against the floor, wincing at each squeak. “How is he?” a voice came from beside him. Harry turned his head and frowned. “Hermione? What are you doing here?” he asked, wondering how long she’d been sitting there before she spoke. Harry hadn’t noticed her entrance, though since Hermione had joined the Unspeakables she was even sneakier than before. The thought amused him, Ron often complained about it.
“Are you alright?” Harry asked in a hushed tone, eyes narrowed. Draco stopped, looked at Harry for a moment and then grimaced. “I think so.” he replied, trying as hard as he could to steady his voice. In truth, Draco was just teetering on the edge of a mental breakdown. He’d received an anonymous owl this morning, it had woken him up. He’d gotten out of bed quick enough that it didn’t wake up Harry, who slept peacefully next to him.
Potter kicked the door shut with his foot and lay the pizza boxes down on a small table, below a large mirror. “Err, probably?” he said, shrugging his shoulders. Draco let out a huff and pulled himself up off the bed, walking to the table to snatch more pizza.
Louisa emitted a confidence Draco envied, at five foot nine and long honey golden curls flowing elegantly down her back, she was never short of a date. It amused Draco that she was wildly uninterested in an actual relationship. Though Louisa did struggle personally, he’d met her at a support group for PTSD connecting immediately.
I’ll admit, I’ve never received a parchment with such life changing news as that which came tied to the leg of your owl, Draco.
I slept in, I usually sleep like actual shit.” Potter said, shaking his head. Flashing Draco a small smile, he shoved his hands into his worse for wear looking coat.
“Mr. Lockwood, you are a part of the Celtic Serpent group, correct?” she asked, her voice was even and controlled. Lavender sat at the back, silently praising Hermione for not just hurling herself over the table and smashing his face in. Merlin knows she’d like to do that.
For Merlin’s sake he couldn’t even sleep without Draco these days. The door to his office banged open, pulling Harry out of his musings. Harry welcomed distraction.
Swallowing, Draco looked around the room and began picking at the skin beside his thumbnail, he pursed his lips, before turning his head towards Potter. “Lamp?”
Stood in front of a giant black and white marble podium in the middle of the Ministry of Magic, Harry Potter sighed. Two months ago, he was promoted to Head Auror and three weeks ago Ron was injured in the line of duty. They’d been auror partners since they finished training, the other Aurors had proclaimed them to be the ‘dynamic duo’ solving cases, arresting dark wizards and they were ranked best Aurors for the last five years. When Harry had been promoted to Head Auror, Ron was assigned a new partner and to his credit he was a relatively decent Auror but definitely not up to Harry’s standards. Ron and Harry had settled into a comfortable routine, they were fantastically suited to each other in every way, unfortunately whilst they were hunting down a rebel Death Eater who had intended to make his own horcruxes, Ron had gone ahead and his partner had not followed. Managing to capture the wizard, Ron also suffered deep curse damage to his right leg and he was being discharged today.
Draco had surprised Harry with his choice of food. The story went back a year ago when Draco and Louisa had found themselves in a small family owned cafe in London. It looked a bit battered from the outside, but it had been hailing for a good twenty minutes and they’d run in for shelter more than anything else. The only thing on the menu that really sparked any interest was the Full English Breakfast, it said sausages and Draco had drunk copious amounts of Gin and Lemonade beforehand.
“I’m not sure, I remember they failed.” he sighed, running a hand through his hair. Draco just nodded. “I’ll ask Endelton, he was assigned Lockwood when he finished training.”
“I see..” Potter said, nodding his head, as though trying to convince himself of something. Draco snorted and shook his head at the dark haired wizard, he picked his glass up and took a sip. “What?” he finally asked, looking up at Potter expectantly.
Taking his hand away, Harry frowned. He’d gotten so lost in thought he blushed, realising he’d left his hand there way longer than necessary. “So what’s on the cards tonight then?” he asked casually, clearing his throat. Draco raised an eyebrow, pondered for a moment then shrugged his shoulders. “Pizza?”
“Alright,” he finally said, nodding his head. Gesturing towards his front door, Draco stood in front of his door for a few moments, as if mentally preparing himself then exhaled. Opening the door with his keys, he walked through and held the door for Potter, who frowned.
The next day, Draco apparated to just outside the Leaky Cauldron and looked down at his watch. It was 1:30. Knowing Potter, he’d probably be late.
