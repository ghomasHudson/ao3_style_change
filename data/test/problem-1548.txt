‘No.’ Draco shook his head, when Harry voiced his doubts. ‘I doubt it. They got him for sure. Dawn said we’re protected, and They came when we needed them. He said he’d been circling around for days. The forest isn’t that big. I don’t think he even noticed the cottage, although it was in plain sight.’
Crickets buzzed, and the forest rustled softly, perfectly innocuous. The heavy branches danced in the stiff sea breeze. Rabbits flitted through the undergrowth, fleeing their approach. ‘We could settle here for the night,’ Harry suggested. ‘Do you think it’s safe?’
‘What is this?’ Malfoy stands in the cupboard with a frown on his face. He mutters something like, ‘The forest makes sense but this…’ but takes a look at Harry, who’s shaking, and stops. Two strides, and he holds Harry. ‘What’s wrong?’
Harry didn’t finish, because Draco had started laughing so hard that tears formed in his eyes. ‘A… jet of water… oh my spirits… that’s so crass.’
‘Yeah,’ Potter stepped closer, his eyes blazing behind his glasses. ‘See, there’s someone who’s been making my palms sweat, my stomach flip, my lungs gasp for air. Someone whose thought keeps me up at night.’
Malfoy glared. ‘I’m more than happy to stab you myself, don’t get me wrong, but the counterjinx won’t work that way. You have to be
It sounded dire to Harry, but Draco’s face was set in a grim smile. ‘You said the Dark Lord’s trying to keep it a secret, that he wants me dead, but she suspects. She’s smart, my mother. She wouldn’t tell me to stay away unless she knew it’d be more dangerous for me to return.’
Draco’s blinded by the prejudice he’s grown up steeped in; filled with self-hatred that distorts everything he sees like a cracked mirror. Harry sits up, too, still holding Draco’s forearm, a connection he doesn’t want to break. ‘I decide who belongs with me. I decide who to spend my time with. I make the choices, and I choose you.’
‘The truth is,’ Harry started, ‘we’re in a bad situation with a very bad man. We’re trying to get away from him. To find friends. In Falmouth.’
“What is wrong with you?!” He scolded himself. Why the hell had his body reacted like that? He shook his head and took deep breaths to try and slow his heart rate
Harry nodded, his mind elsewhere. This year would be… strange, to say the least. The summer hadn’t been easy for him, and the solemn halls of the Burrow hadn’t helped his mood. His heart ached thinking about it, about all of the Weasleys and him gathered in a field, Fred’s golden coffin lowering into the chilly earth. Mrs. Weasley had spent most of the summer crying, not that anyone could blame her.
“Settle down, everyone. Now that everyone has been Sorted, “ she paused while a smattering of applause echoed through the hall, “I am sure that you’re all wondering why we have moved the tables. The other teachers and I have decided to make some changes. Everyone is still recovering from last year, and we believe that this is the best way to unite Hogwarts.”
“Anytime in the next two weeks, Mr. Potter. I am confident that we will have a marvelous Quidditch team this year, thanks to your efforts.” She smiled warmly. “You may go, Mr. Potter.”
“I guess so,” Harry curled his lip, “Any idea why the hell we’re in here together? And why is it just us?”
Malfoy pressed a book into his hands. “Here. You’d like this book, Potter. Better than learning how to properly… clean floors and whatnot. Now, sod off. I was reading.”
Harry silently pointed his wand at his index finger. He didn't wince when the spell broke through his skin, a small drop of red blood beading at the tip of his finger. Flipping his hand over, he touched his finger to the parchment. It absorbed the blood, the red swirling into letters. Harry Potter, Gryffindor. His skin prickled and the back of his hand stung, and he closed his eyes, breathing deeply.
He waved goodbye to Ron and Hermione and walked to the Transfiguration classroom, knocking on the doorframe before entering.
Thanks for reading! I hope you enjoyed this chapter. If you left a kudos/comment, it would really mean a lot :)
Harry’s sneaker crunched the tiny pebbles on the pavement as he stepped off of the Hogwarts Express, Ron’s arm around his shoulders.
Harry offered a sad smile and pulled his robes tighter over his shoulders, responding softly, his voice almost a whisper, “I’d love that, ‘Mione, thank you.”
“Watch out, Harry!” Hermione exclaimed, grabbing Harry’s shoulders. He snapped his head up and jumped when he saw that he was about to run into a statue.
The dorm was smaller than Dean and Seamus’ had been, since it would only be the two of them. Two four-poster beds were across the room from each other, heavy gray curtains drawn around both. Sturdy wooden trunks were at the ends of both beds, each with a large, thick blanket draped over it. Harry noticed a door in the far left corner and pushed the door open, revealing a spacious bathroom with a glass shower, a soaker tub, and a double vanity.
“It’s going to be a good year, mate. No more… undying evil wizards to chase after. I hope,” Ron laughs, slinging his bag over his head.
Shortly after all of the students had finished, McGonagall flicked her wand over everyone, the shreds of parchment fluttering through the air and landing softly in a silver bowl placed on the end of the table.
Harry recalled Malfoy’s face inches away from his, his warm breath on Harry’s ear, and decided not to tell Hermione about that.
Harry jumped when Ron nudged him, “Oi, mate, do you think McGonagall is gonna explain about the table?”
Harry rushed out of the room and whipped his head from side to side, searching for another bathroom, but there was none.
Harry backed away and retreated to a table, pressing his hand to his chest and feeling his frantic heartbeat.
His legs were long and lean, the large rips exposing the pale, creamy skin on his thighs as he slid back into his seat, reopening his book and pushing his glasses up his nose. Harry averted his gaze, staring at the table.
“I wanted to ask if you were still interested in being Quidditch Captain this year, Mr. Potter. I had assumed so, but I wanted to ask if you would be up for it, nonetheless.”
Harry nodded, forcing a grin. Hagrid beamed and walked away towards the cluster of first-years gathered under a tree, whistling as he walked.
When Harry arrives at his dorm, he's hoping that Malfoy isn't there, but not only is he disappointed, there's another bad aspect of sharing a dorm with Malfoy that he hadn't anticipated.
A light touch brushed his shoulder and his breath caught, Hermione’s worried face peeking in from the side, and she spoke tentatively, as if afraid of angering him. “Harry, are you alright?. Do you want to go wander the halls for a little while before the feast? The train was a bit early, so we have time.”
McGonagall finally got everyone to settle down and proceeded to explain how the new roommates would be chosen. Harry kept zoning out, but he caught the basic idea. They would use the Goblet of Fire, which would analyze them and figure out which other students would help them the most.
“Come on, Harry, you can do this. Think of ‘Mione and Ron,” He whispered to himself, blinking back the tears that welled in the corners of his eyes. He took a deep, shaky breath and turned around, taking his time before he had to face the school.
Series of names were called out, reactions of disappointment or excitement rippling through the room following each announcement. Harry stared at McGonagall, trying to focus, so he’d be paying attention when his name was called. He avoided zoning out for a couple of minutes, but eventually gave up and returned his attention to the loose thread on his sleeve.
“That makes no sense, dumbass,” Harry snapped, trying not to think about how much better Malfoy’s hair looked, and how his sweater was riding up to show a sliver of his stomach,  “She didn’t choose the room assignments. The Goblet did.”
Malfoy rested his hand next to Harry’s head and leaned in, glancing at the book. Harry exhaled shakily. Malfoy’s face was precariously close to his, and Harry stared at his long blond eyelashes.
“Oh, yeah, he’s across the hall, mate,” Dean grinned, and Harry’s eyes snapped to a dark bruise on Seamus’ neck.
hey everyone! hope you enjoy this fic :) if you have any questions, requests, comments, etc, you can email me at ambrosia.and.roses@gmail.com
“What’s so interesting about that book, anyway?” She asked, pointing at the book Malfoy had given him.
Harry would, of course, be in a dorm with those people, but they would also be in most of his classes. Classes would also consist of students from all houses. McGonagall waved her wand, and a slip of paper appeared in front of each person.
“Looking for a book, Malfoy,” Harry responded, injecting irritation into his tone and snatching a random book off of the shelf.
The Goblet shivered, blue fire licking the edge of the glass. Five scraps of parchment flew out into the air, singed at the edges. McGonagall held out her hand and let the paper float into her open palm. She read out the names, and a few third years grinned excitedly at each other, one barely containing a squeal of excitement.
“Er…” He tried to think of an answer but was saved when a Ravenclaw first year ran up to them, clearly nervous. “Er, hello, Mr.- um, Harry, er… Professor McGonagall wants to see you. She’s in her classroom.”
“Yeah, I fucking knew that, thanks,” Malfoy sneered, sitting up and bracing his clenched fists on the bed.
“I’m going to the library,” He said abruptly, standing up and snatching his bag from the floor. Ron and Hermione didn’t even break apart as he left.
Harry wandered down the hallway at the top of the stairs. Muffled conversations came from the heavy wooden doors that lined the hall, along with laughs and screams of laughter.
No one had ever recommended a book to him before. Strange that the first person to do so would be Malfoy. Harry flipped the book over and traced the title with one finger.
so yes, i know this isn't drarry, but i wanted harry to come to terms with his sexuality a bit before the main pairing :))
The heels of his shoes clicked against the stone floor on his way to the library, echoing through the hallway.
Malfoy glanced up when he heard Harry, and his calm expression morphed into one of annoyance. “What are you doing here, Potter?”
Luna had come to stay with them while her father was in Turkey, searching for Turkish Wilgers or something like that. Harry had gone into Ginny’s room to ask if she had any spare parchment, as everyone else was out, and had made the mistake of not knocking. Ginny’s head had snapped up from between Luna’s legs, and Harry had shouted and covered his eyes with one hand, awkwardly apologizing and quickly rushing out of the room.
There was a pause, and Harry jumped when he heard Malfoy’s voice next to his ear. “Interesting reading choice, Potter.”
“Oy, Harry, Ron, Hermione, it was great ta see ya all. I’d love ta talk, but I got to direct tha firs’ years. Come see me tomorrow for tea, and I’ll see ya all at the feast, yeh?”
An elbow poked his ribs, and he glared at Ron, rubbing his side, “What the hell, mate? What was that for?”
“I am getting there, Mr. Rosenthal. We have decided to integrate the houses more, which is why we will be changing dorm assignments for the foreseeable future.”
Harry wheeled around and pretended to browse for a book, dragging his fingers over the spines of the books.
Ron’s face was twisted in confusion, and he was staring across the table. Harry followed his gaze to Malfoy, except…
Harry hadn’t even thought about it yet, but he knew, without a doubt, that his answer was yes. He couldn’t imagine Hogwarts without Quidditch. Often, during the summer, he had cast a Disillusionment Spell and gone flying. It had helped clear his thoughts and calm him down, and he sure as hell needed that this year.
Harry nodded and walked away, planning the tryouts in his head. He *had* to pick the perfect team members.
“Uh, I guess so,” Harry mumbled, fidgeting with the sleeve of his robe and pulling at a loose thread.
Harry and Hermione walked silently through the halls, ignoring the stares of the portraits. Harry was blinking back tears the whole time, the dim hallways reminding him of all they had lost. “Harry, we should get going. The feast will start soon,” Hermione suggested, but Harry mumbled that he’d meet her there, and kept walking.
“I’m so happy for you, boys,” she whispered vehemently before letting go and walking to where Arthur was standing.
After securing a safe distance between them, Harry couldn’t help but giggle at his boyfriend’s antics. “Merlin, Draco, did you really need to spell his teeth brown?”
“Harry,” Draco shook his head, his hands found their way to rest on Harry’s thighs, “one of the reasons I was down on one knee to acquire your hand in marriage was that Witch Weekly wouldn’t stop choosing you as the most eligible bachelor, and I was getting so sick of it.”
The question startled Draco so much that he jerked upward, making his shoulder hit Harry’s chin hard. Harry groaned, hand lifted to rub his chin from the mild pain.
“I’m sorry about that.” Harry let out a long sigh and flopped back on his bed. “Hermione is always intense when it comes to studying. And I really messed up big time.”
They stayed in their bed until the sun was high, the temperature rose as the day rolled, forcing them to untangle themselves from each other as the heat became unbearable. They missed their usual breakfast with Gita and Meme but they couldn’t bring themselves to care. After washing up, they were out to walk around the village, no destination in mind.
After a long shower, Draco’s head cleared. Blood returned to his brain, though memories of the night before flashed in his mind sporadically, causing his prick to remain half-hard at all times. However, the unwelcome guest of rationality had visited him, impressing on him the urge to figure out where the hell he was.
Harry doesn’t know anything about art, but as he pauses in front of one of Dean’s portraits, he finds himself in the unfortunate position of being required to talk about it.
‘And fifty thousand Galleons in Muggle money.’ It’s enough money to escape the NHS waiting lists and find the transplant Nariyoshi needs.
Draco scrutinised the tree barks and the blueberry bushes; he gathered resin in his finger and tasted it; he crouched to pat the soil. ‘Looks fine to—’ he paused, cocking his ear.
‘We both cut into our palms and hold hands. That’s all. We figured it out as kids, when Vincent’s mother —
Draco’s famished. Between a flurry of orders and Nariyoshi’s condition, he’s had no time to go out (he avoids the word
to stay on the ship.’ He locked eyes with Harry and smiled in a provocative way that had Harry’s blood roaring. ‘You can’t imagine how grateful. In fact,' he smiled and slid on the floor between Harry's legs, leaving him breathless, 'why don't I show you?'
When he let go, Draco took Harry's wounded hand. ‘This is what I do, right?’ he asked, picking up the cotton and soaking it with the antiseptic.
‘Well, it’s the trend these days, isn’t it?’ Potter smiled. ‘I couldn’t be the only Leo who’s not painted his nails. Even Neville’s gone for green, same shade as his favourite plant. Besides, I think it suits me.’
A murmur beside him made him turn slowly to his left. He encountered an obstacle: a warm body pressed against his side, dark hair in his eyes and a leg tangled with his.
The city glittered below them as they sat next to each other. ‘Did you have a lover back home?’ Harry asked. He hadn’t bothered to consider that Draco might‘ve had to break up a relationship to marry him.
thinking of you. Knowing that I could have you again.’ He bucked his hips hard, his voice a low gasp, as he added, ‘…and again, and again…’
Harry had never been more reluctant to leave a place. The urgency of his mission and his team’s fate prickled in him, demanded he leave and head to the town to communicate with London, but he felt as if he’d left a part of him trapped in these stone walls.
‘Can we use one of those Muggle contraptions?’ Malfoy pointed at a passing car. ‘They seem to be going fast.’
Draco paused, his hand tightening on his wand. The implication reverbated between them, stinging like a wasp: when they reached Tinworth, they’d separate. It could well be the last time they’d ever see each other. Harry scuffed his shoe on the ground, feeling suddenly guilty.
He wishes he could take the words back as soon as he’s said them. Malfoy swallows hard. He’s gone rigid, fists clenched by his side. Any trace of desire is wiped from his face. ‘You always were a fucking bastard, Harry Potter.’
‘I only kissed two people,’ Draco said. ‘Pansy and Theo. If I’d known I’d die so soon, I’d have kissed a hundred.’
‘’Smatter of fact there was a letter,’ Rookwood said, sounding closer to them. ‘Only, the parchment was blank. A joke maybe. It’s in my pocket. Want to see it, Malfoy? Come out and get it.’
In an indirect way perhaps, but still. The day had dawned for Draco not dissimilar to many of his Eighth Year days: he was leaving the Arithmancy classroom when three sixth-year Ravenclaws cast a hex behind his back, causing boils to erupt on his face. The sudden, sharp pain made him trip on the stairs, and he fell, books and quills scattering around him. The girls laughed themselves silly, while another Ravenclaw from his year reached a hand to help him stand up.
Draco lifted his eyes and narrowed them immediately. Weasley approached them and raised his hand. Draco tensed, fearing an attack, but Weasley was going for a high-five. Numb, Draco high-fived him so lamely that Weasley guffawed.
Draco lets the use of his first name slide. He pulls Potter to the edge of the table and enters him in one long slide, sucking in a deep breath to calm the onslaught of the magical energy that pours in his veins like a tempest. Potter’s a feast for the senses, and Draco almost whimpers at how delicious it feels, at how tightly Potter’s arse hugs his prick, at the touch of his hands on Draco’s skin, and the softness of his lips on Draco’s mouth. He thrusts inside once more. Potter groans.
of all people, but there Smith was, a sub leashed to a tall, blonde Dom, and in the kind of outfit that had no place in a school. Or anywhere outside a special kind of club, really. However, no one batted an eyelid and Professor Sprout even stopped to speak to him; Smith nodded his answers.
Harry hoovered absent-mindedly, going over the same spot, and wondered how it must feel when your friends don’t notice you missing meals. He tried to imagine having no one by his side — even now, Dumbledore’s Army stood by him in their own way — and he couldn’t picture a more devastating loneliness.
Harry pushed him on the bed and pulled his breeches off. He sank his head in Draco’s golden pubes, trying to memorise his scent. ‘Yes, him. The crew wants us to take the money.’
— and thrust something in his palm. The laughter and fair hair faded in the night, and the forest filled with the sounds of branches rustling and nightingales singing — and Draco panting next to him as if he’d run.
The very first couple in the tree, going back several hundred years, was the Earl of Westmorland and his wife. Their son married a lady called Aveline, and their children are the first to have the name Black embroidered beside them.
Potter sits up now, knocking down a pot of brushes that spills on the floor. ‘I’m not sure I can talk.’ He smiles rather goofily at Draco.
The Inferi-Draco starts to rise, and Harry knows he’ll have to kill it before it kills him. He must kill Inferi-Draco, but it won’t stop him, so he must do it
Now they trudged the wet earth towards Tinworth and for the millionth time Harry suppressed a stab of pain at the loss of his Cloak. It must have been left in the tent; Hermione was the last one who wore it on an excursion to a nearby Sainsbury’s. Losing his father’s heirloom pained Harry so much that he’d shoved the thought out of his mind, but he couldn’t help wonder how much easier their task would be if he’d carried it with him instead of the little pouch around his neck with the useless, sentimental things.
Harry will miss the almost-white hair. He’s grown used to seeing it from the distance as he limps to the pond. He doesn’t say anything, though. The war has gouged them all, and if they want to indulge in a little fancy, who’s to blame them?
It’s a guess, but he finds confirmation in the febrile light in Mrs Li’s eyes, which betrays a hunger that rivals his. ‘True. It absorbs wealth as well. Power. It stores it. Its capacity is… limitless.’ Her greed is stark on her elegant face.
, Harry. This is what it means to grow up in magic — and what it means to be a Muggleborn. You think you can wave a wand and cast a spell and that makes you a wizard, but I’ve been
‘Do you call each other by your surname?’ Dawn asked, slicing peppers by the sink. ‘I assumed you were friends.’
‘All the Wandless families that stayed here have gone now.’ Harry waited for him with a handle on the door of a room at the end of the corridor. He seemed anxious in a way he wasn’t normally. Draco followed him inside.
hole.’ Draco doesn’t know what he’s saying, only that he’s reaching a state of bliss he rarely experiences. ‘I’m going to eat you whole and spit you out hollow.’
‘Think of your parents. Think of how you want them to be happy.’ Potter stepped aside and let Draco stand alone.
‘What is this, wasting-Pansy’s-time-with-inane-questions? Of course you call her Hermione, that’s her bloody name.’ She noticed his expression and clutched his hand. ‘Perhaps you should have some rest. Whatever the spell was, it’s affected you.’
They drank in silence for a while. Harry glanced at Draco, hoping for more glimpses of his unrestrained side, but he’d withdrawn into himself again.
‘I don’t suppose you expect me to comply with this!’ Harry had told his father a week before, when the alliance with the island kingdom had been arranged — as well as Harry’s expedited nuptials to seal it.
from the cottage? Were they in Cornwall, perhaps within walking distance to Tinworth, or did they end up in Wales or, Merlin forbid,
‘Your wand’s ruined.’ Harry pocketed it, unwilling to part with it, no matter how broken, and brandished the dagger. The wind howled as it whipped the dark waves below them into fury and cut through Harry’s jumper, goosebumps erupting on his skin.
Harry must have taken the request as foreplay. He paused between words to trail small kisses on Draco’s neck and jaw. ‘We’ve been seeing each other for over three months now. I mean, we flirted during the war, but we only got together here. First week. I just couldn’t keep my hands off you anymore. The coup had been overthrown, Voldemort was gone, we’d received our medals
Draco had died. This was the only logical explanation: he’d died and gone to heaven, and if he didn’t know that he didn’t deserve heaven, then maybe he’d believe it.
Draco doesn’t invite Potter in. At the sight of him, as always, Draco’s control threatens to slip from his grasp. ‘What do you want?’
It was night and it was different in the night — their edges disappeared and they became ghosts, echoes of who they were, but also true distillations of themselves: distillations of despair and loneliness and ardent, burning desire. They clung to each other with fierce passion, Draco pressing down on Harry, kissing and grinding and touching. Skin to skin, sweat mingling, they kissed and rubbed and touched. They spoke little, just exclamations and small laughter and soft, fragile moans.
Harry wants to be angry — he even suspects Malfoy is deliberately sabotaging this date, although he’s no idea why he’d do that — but instead something else bubbles inside him. He glances at the purple-fuchsia-orange-yellow-turquoise drink, and lets out a peal of laughter.
‘You still up?’ Draco asked, sliding into bed, bringing with him the scent of the forest. He hesitated for a moment, glancing at the space between them, but Harry shuffled towards him. An invitation. Eyes smiling, Draco snuggled close behind Harry, wrapping his arms around him, pressing his chest on Harry’s back. Warmth bloomed between them, a simple comfort that was enough to dispel the darkness in Harry’s heart.
‘All you'd need to do to hurt me is clench your fist,’ Draco rasped, his face more open than Harry had ever seen it.
‘Indeed it is. The gold coins have not been found and some speculate that theft was the reason behind the fire. The locals are concerned, especially in regards with another baffling crime: the unusual circumstances surrounding the deaths of John Oakes and Jeremy Stevens at the rental cottage by Dozmary Pool on Sunday evening.’
As the fatigue of the evening washed over Harry, he dropped his head against the wall and closed his eyes. He wondered if he should keep them open, if he should be alert with Malfoy around — c
‘He always drives up for lunch on a Sunday,’ she explained. ‘Come rain or shine, Ben’s always here at noon, bless him. You know,’ she said slowly, ‘you’re welcome to stay here until next week when he returns.’
Harry takes a step closer. ‘I can’t imagine what came over me, but I promise you I’m not usually like this. I’ve been told I have stamina, and stuff.’
, only you.’ He clasped Draco’s palm tight in his and Draco thrust faster, unable to hold himself back. By the time he came, they were both incoherent.
. Tugging the foreskin up and down, his cock pulsing with forgotten delight, Harry dutifully pictured Ginny as he always did at first: her pert arse, the softness of her breasts, her hair falling on his face as she’d straddled him and kissed him. But as his hand tightened around his cock and arousal spread through his veins, his mind favoured other images: Wood in the showers, water sluicing down his back; Dean in his underwear in their dorm, soft from sleep; Cedric dripping out of that fucking lake.
Sweat cools on his skin. Harry opens his eyes and takes in the dark room. He’s alone in sticky pyjamas, and Grimmauld Place is as quiet and empty as it’s been these past couple of years since the divorce. He exhales. He’s as relieved as he is disappointed to realise that he hadn’t got blind drunk, pulled Malfoy in a pub and brought him home. It was simply a wet dream. A very realistic,
She doesn't finish her sentence. Yells sound from the casino, followed by the bang of offensive and defensive spells. A crash resounds from right outside the door.
They trudged through muddy fields and along a tree-lined path that lead to the country road. The temperature rose slightly as they walked, drying their still damp clothing. Harry knew what he must look like if Malfoy’s appearance was anything to go by. He felt damp
The door opens and Draco lifts his head, all thoughts of his aunt fleeing his mind. Harry walks in with a tray of sandwiches, shirtless, his jeans unbuttoned and hanging so low on his hips that Draco can see his pubes. Harry’s glistening with sweat, exuding a post-orgasmic glow, loose-limbed and soft. He looks debauched, well-fucked, absolutely pornographic, like a whore that could demand a kingdom’s ransom. Desire drives all thoughts from Draco’s mind, and he sits up.
would fix them perfectly — no cracks or faults, the original unblemished again. But Draco likes kintsugi, because he knows life isn’t like
Harry and Draco trudged up the stairs to their room, silent and brooding. The rain had stopped, allowing the moon to emerge behind the clouds and flood the attic with silvery ghost light. They changed into tracksuit bottoms and T-shirts and climbed under the duvet.
Harry is very up for it. His dick is also up for it, and he’s considering suggesting a morning tumble, but he needs to get to work. ‘We didn’t fight last night.’
It couldn’t be. Harry’s brain refused to accept it, denying the truth of his eyes even as the news showed smiling pictures of the two ladies he and Draco had bought clothes from in Camelford.
‘I don’t know.’ Draco peered at the letter and brightened, an almost childlike hope on his face. ‘That’s the Black seal on the letter, though. Not the Malfoy.’
Harry blinked and sat up. He was wearing the gown he’d seen earlier. His mind sluggishly brought forth the memory of a stormy night, the heat of a roaring fire, and then the gilded memory of a mind-blowing fuck.
They shoved Harry and Draco to the middle of the clearing. The violinist ceased playing, the children gaped, and the rest of the community emerged from the caravans, surrounding them. Some of the foxes had been Animagi, men and women stalked out of the elms in the staggering movements of the recently transformed. Draco trembled next to Harry as they waited for their fate to be decided. The Roma had taken Draco’s wand and Bellatrix’s silver dagger when they apprehended them. They had nothing to fight with.
This one wasn’t the Potter he knew, but a Harry who didn’t pity or hate him, and Draco’s heart swelled. He finally gave in and ran a hand through Harry’s hair, stroking his fringe back from his forehead. Harry’s eyes fluttered close at Draco’s touch. This was— shit, this was very similar to the image he’d seen in the Mirror of Erised.
But why would they delay? Something in all of this didn’t add up and Voldemort hated things not making sense. Why not Apparate to Tinworth? Why wander in a moor, out in the open?
A shiver runs down Draco’s spine as he gazes at the image of a beautiful lady with dark hair, who is, most likely, the reason for his
He’d forgotten in those blissful, bleary-eyed moments where he was and who he was with. He’d forgotten about this person and their uneasy, tentative truce. Malfoy looked serene; no trace of a sneer marking his fair face. Harry felt a thrill, examining him undetected, as if he was doing something illicit. But as the milky sunlight spread in the room like a whisper, he looked his fill: at the pointy angles of Malfoy’s jaw, the sharp cheekbones, the straight nose, the luminous hair fanning on the pillow; a face like a dagger softened by the curve of full lips and soft pale lashes.
Harry attempts to focus on the conversation. ‘Turns out my skill for running headfirst into danger — although useful for battling Dark Lords and Hogwarts monsters — is actually an impediment in Auroring. Not to mention that the paps harassing me every time I was in public got in the way of my arrests.’
Ron clutched his hands behind his back and didn’t meet Harry’s eyes. ‘Just once or twice. He’s still under guard and everything. It’s just—’
Draco looked dead on his feet. Harry gathered their tools, stuffed them in the rucksack and shut the barn doors. Soothing darkness fell inside, pierced by slanted shafts of light. ‘Let’s go to the loft,’ he said over his shoulder.
safe then?’ Harry couldn’t hide the desperation in his voice. He couldn’t bear it if these kind women died because of him.
Draco’s eyes sparkled as he finished his reminiscence, his mood brighter. Harry brushed his leg gently, his chest constricted. If only life were a game. If only he could be assured of winning. He refused to let his fears taint this moment, though; not when Draco wore such a wistful smile. ‘It’s so weird that people wanted to be… me.’
, he’s never really experienced true pleasure. Trust Potter to differ in this, as in everything else, from the garden variety wizard. Of course, Harry Potter’s always been different; Draco’s willing to accept that.
‘I don’t think this is going to work,’ Malfoy whispered, as they pressed very close together with no room for him to take off his robes without bumping into Harry.
— his acidic tongue, his sharp mind, his deplorable ethics — was obscured by the flesh and blood body that lay so close to Harry that he could feel the curve of Draco’s spine.
Draco glanced at Harry, who gave him a look to remind him to ‘shut up’. He found he very much enjoyed having all these opportunities to tell Draco to shut up on account of “not being discovered”.
The loft had been converted into two rooms. The one they entered was a small bedroom, with exposed beams, a wooden chest of drawers, and a window behind the bed, which Dawn was pointing at now.
‘He wants us both. He’ll kill you to punish your father, and he’ll kill me because he’s been trying to do that my whole life, which means if the Death Eaters find us, we’re both dead,’ Harry continued, relentless. ‘This is how much you matter to him. This is how much he cares for his followers.
Draco couldn't restrain himself any longer. In a gesture similar to his first night with Harry, he raised a hand and touched his face. He stroked his cheek and brushed a lock of hair behind his ear. Potter’s eyes fluttered and he leaned closer, his breath mixing with Draco’s.
Draco thought he noticed a hint of disappointment on Potter’s features before they turned cold. ‘Ron’s right. You’re still a git.’
. The bird’s tiny heart fluttered under his touch and Draco was glad to feel warmth spreading over the little bird.
Draco smiles. It finally starts to sink in: he’s safe, Nariyoshi’s safe, and Harry knows. He knows everything and still wants Draco. ‘A housemate who begs for my cock every night.’
Esther sought his hand and clasped it in hers. ‘Trust me when I say this: you’re a good person, Draco. Stay.’
Sunrise found them hurrying through a sleeping village, cresting to the top of a steep street. A vista of the Cornish countryside unfolded before them, soft greens and blues, the young barley fields slashed by dark green hedges. Harry darted a glance at Draco, who seemed as tense as Harry felt. They’d been jumpy on the way here, flinching at sudden movements. A cat had jumped on a bin earlier, and Draco had almost hexed the poor creature.
Nariyoshi has long white hair, tied back at his nape, a beard, and a tattoo of a yellow submarine on his forearm. He moves with difficulty. His puffy face and his wheezing suggest he’s quite ill. ‘Feeling better now?’ he asks Harry as he prepares green tea in a beautiful, glazed pot.
‘It don’t hurt to try,’ Rookwood grumbled. He held a shirt in his hand and offered it to the dogs, which sniffed it and returned to the lake shore, trying to pick up the scent. They moved along the shore, unable to track them down.
They padded past the huddled houses, slow and careful. The ocean breeze picked up, whistling through the chimneys, and they followed it out of the village to open country. Shell Cottage was somewhere there.
Harry moaned at the touch, breaking their messy kiss to suck Salazar’s neck. ‘I’ve wanted you since I sat down.’ He buried his nose in the crook of the man’s neck and inhaled, while Salazar’s hand did delightful things to Harry’s cock. ‘Your scent… I’ve never met a commoner who smells like this.’
‘I was going to tell you.’ Harry munches on a sandwich, getting crumbs on the bed. ‘But you sidetracked me with that mouth of yours.’
‘Really?’ The relief Harry felt at this news was accompanied by a pang of loss. He was startled to realise he’d miss Draco.
Potter’s surprisingly forthcoming. For an Unspeakable, he talks too much. ‘I’ve been working with this weird statue,’ Potter says, his hand stroking Draco’s hair. ‘It’s ancient. Eastern probably. We don’t know what it does, and that’s what worries us. We can’t even touch it. Tried all sorts of diagnostics, but it seems to absorb everything you cast at it and reveal nothing.’
Harry follows her down the corridor. Nurse Burbage has left the door ajar and Harry pauses, making a show of needing his cane more than he does. Doctor Lupin’s voice drifts to where Harry is pretending not to eavesdrop.
Draco didn’t stop, but Potter caught up with him. They trudged in the muddy path that wound around the misty hills.
‘Can you tone it down with the insults?’ Harry pulled his hand from Draco’s grasp. They’d reached the edge of the cottage by now. ‘It was an honest mistake, I didn’t think…’
Turning to his side, Harry stared at Draco’s empty pillow. He’d been a while coming to bed — had he discovered late night TV? Harry ignored the desire to go seek him out. Draco would come to bed when he wanted to, Harry wasn’t his guardian. He’d just thought… Well, never mind that.
Draco’s body heat seeped into Harry’s bones, warming him up. Though he also desperately needed sleep, Harry remained awake for some time, stroking Draco’s hair as he slumbered, quietly breathing in the musky air of the barn. It was a beautiful place, actually. Floating dust motes glittered in the rich yellow light slanting through the cracks. Harry stroked Draco’s hair and searched in his heart for any lingering doubts; any worries that Draco would chicken out at the crucial moment, that he’d betray Harry in order to escape immediate death.
Then, it was the turn of their Muggle ‘weapon’: a set of walkie-talkies. Walking around the perimeter of the barn, with insects buzzing and the breeze stirring the scent of wildflowers in the air, they fixed the frequency and tested how far the signal would reach.
Harry nips the inside of Draco’s thighs and licks at the soft skin where they meet his scrotum. He takes a mock-apologetic expression. ‘Ah. I fear I’m going to disappoint you.’
Potter sends him an incalcitrant look but obeys. He sucks Draco off like a champ, his tongue swirling around the head, his left hand rolling Draco’s balls with gentle fingers.
Harry couldn’t get another word out of Draco. When they reached the palace and before Draco disappeared in his chambers like he had every other night, Harry grabbed his wrist. ‘Have a glass of wine with me tonight. Just the one. On the balcony. It’s a lovely evening.’
Malfoy comes over with a pint and a colourful cocktail, complete with rainbow umbrellas and a glazed cherry. Before Harry has a chance to take the piss about Malfoy’s choice of drink, the bastard slides the concoction to him with a devilish smirk.
‘And the Mirror moved from a little-visited room to a busy corridor,’ Draco followed his train of thought. ‘It wanted to be seen; to be used by many.' He paused. 'But now the Mirror is going to the Department of Mysteries.’ Draco looked at Dumbledore. ‘It will never be happy.’
‘You’re not in that house,’ Malfoy says, and indeed when Harry looks up he’s in his bedroom. He exhales with relief, his hands covering his face. It’s a dream, just a dream, nothing more.
‘Hush now. Let me take care of you.’ Malfoy’s robes rustle as he grinds his pelvis against Harry’s throbbing cock. He moans softly as his movements become faster, his own erection digging in Harry’s groin. Keeping both of Harry’s wrists pinned with one hand, Malfoy shoves Harry’s robes out of the way and unzips his trousers. His probing hand wraps around Harry’s prick. ‘Merlin, this feels good.’
Malfoy looked very different with his white tee and worn jeans, Harry thought, as they walked along the road, sticking their thumb out at the approaching cars. In fact, he reminded Harry of an old Muggle film star who’d died young and whose films Aunt Petunia watched often, especially when Uncle Vernon went down the local. Malfoy still had the veneer of the landed gentry coating his words, his posture, his sneer; but without his expensive clothing, he looked as if he was missing a piece of his armour.
Harry scuffed the toe of his shoe in the dirt. A plan had formed in his mind, the need to leave, to go and do something. The urgency ran through him, pushing him forward. ‘I’m going to leave. Tonight even.’
Draco glanced at Harry showering a couple of stalls away, his body covered in suds, and dismissed these thoughts as unwelcome remnants of his past life. He had nothing to fear in a world created to satisfy his desires; desires he meant to indulge in as soon as he found himself alone with Harry. With a smile, he closed his eyes and let his mind drift when the sound of his name brought him back to the locker room.
Harry picked the card up with shaking hands. Dumbledore winked at him and straightened his hat. Harry was seized by the irrational desire to shout at the image of the man who waved at him, oblivious to the feelings of grief and love and resentment warring inside Harry at the thought of his old Professor. He gave vent to his frustration, not towards the portrait on the collector’s card, but to the flesh and blood man sitting some feet away.
He turned off the vacuum and decided to ask him about what had been on his mind since yesterday: Hogwarts. ‘Why did you say school was horrendous? Is Snape so bad?’ Harry tried to suppress the hatred that bubbled at the memory of Dumbledore’s murderer. ‘And no cryptic statements. Fucking tell me.’
‘Come, sleepyhead.’ Draco dragged Harry away from his breakfast. ‘You promised to take me to the coast.’ Draco’s face radiated joy in a way that made
Wispy clouds glided through the night sky as they crept to the village, hidden in the shadows. The presence of a dangerous Death Eater must have kept people inside because not a soul crossed their path. Harry and Draco huddled close to the crooked buildings, avoiding the well-lit streets for the darker lanes. Harry’s heart pounded in his chest as they rounded the corners, making their way deeper into the village. He tensed when a curtain twitched in a window, cold sweat running down his spine.
Harry choked and Draco laughed. It was the first unrestrained image of him that Harry had witnessed. It suited Draco; it made him look softer and more carefree, and at that moment Harry wondered for the first time what it’d be like to kiss him.
‘It was a nightmare,’ Bob whispers again. ‘I was on my way to the loo when I heard you tossing and muttering.’
Draco has the smaller bedroom of the two, with a view of the tiny square they call a garden. He turns the light on, cringes at the mess, and shoves Potter on the bed. ‘Undress and I’ll get you some food. There’s some T-shirts in that drawer,’ he points to the dresser. Before Draco leaves, he casts a discreet spell over Harry. His vitals are quite low. He adds an extra blanket on the bed.
A presenter’s voice drifts in the kitchen from the living room TV; she announces that the voting has started. Nariyoshi’s muttering under his breath about who’s going to get booted. The kitchen timer beeps when the noodles are ready. The familiar sounds of home fortify Draco. He’s led a quiet life these past three years since Azkaban, learning the trade and the Muggle world alongside Nariyoshi, a man who was once a boss and a flatmate and has become a friend and a parental figure. Draco’s not willing to let the life he’s built here go to waste. He’ll fight for it, if he must. Gathering his wild thoughts, a hasty plan takes shape in his mind: look after Potter tonight because he drained him something awful, ask him out, make him fall for Draco somehow, then... have him hand over the figurine? Draco can’t plan that far ahead.
no less, but friends of the two ladies also mention an unusual encounter with two young men, who offered Cooper real gold for Oxfam clothing two days ago.’
Breathing heavily, Malfoy looked up, his face a portrait of fury. ‘That’s mine, you prick,’ he spat, his eyes on the wand.
‘I—happened to be around.’ Potter pointed at the strange earring he still wore. ‘Hermione created these, based on a Muggle invention. We can communicate from a distance. She said McGonagall was looking for you…’ He trailed off, looking awkward. ‘I thought I’d check. You come here a lot.’
An exploring hand slid under Draco’s pyjamas, light fingers running against his fevered skin. Draco’s breath came out with difficulty. ‘And then? You kissed me?’
When she left, Harry cast a last glance at the cottage. The light on the ground floor winked out. The trees rustled over his head and the darkness was snug as a blanket around them. At the end of this path, the magical world beckoned.
They hadn’t agreed to anything other than reaching Tinworth together when they’d made their plans in Camelford. Back then, it went without saying that they’d go their separate ways when they arrived at the magical village, but now things had changed. Harry feared that Draco had hoped they’d stick together for longer, and judging by Draco’s reaction now, he was right.
Harry has had the dream before. He’s in the forest. It’s dark and eerily quiet. He sees no one but feels watched. He’s searching for something but can’t remember what. He thinks he glimpses a familiar face, he runs towards it, but he’s mistaken. It’s only a shadow, a trick of the frosty moonlight that makes everything look lifeless. Harry trudges on, his footsteps making no sound. He wants to speak, to call out, but he’s suddenly afraid to break the silence. Something terrible will happen if he does, he’s sure of it. He shudders with cold dread. Branches snag at his clothing; he’s getting in deeper and it’s getting colder. He stumbles over something. He looks down. Two legs protrude from a bush — a dead body. No, no, no... He takes a step to see the person’s face, to see who it is, his heart frantic with terror…
‘Ah almost forty years now. I was a hippie, went to all the festivals. Met an English woman in one of them and moved across the world to be with her. We got married, were happy for maybe twenty years, unhappy for another ten. Divorced eventually. No children. Now I have Draco.’
Draco’s eyes filled with wonder and delight. ‘Help yourself,’ he said in a teasing tone, gesturing with careless elegance to his body.
‘The other Germans. The ones that were a little different: the handicapped and the mentally ill; the homosexuals; the ones who failed to conform; the weak. Regimes like those have no mercy. They have no compassion. A young man who joins them might think he’ll gain power by stepping on others, but it’s only a matter of time before they step on
His stomach rumbled and Draco headed to the Great Hall, leaving his investigation for later. On the way, he was even more convinced something extraordinary had happened. The whispers behind his back and the looks he attracted were nothing new, but they were different: instead of glares, Draco received smiles; instead of scowls, students—even Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs—showed admiration.
Boot waited, his body tight in apprehension. He probably wondered if Draco knew and if he’d tell. Draco lowered his voice and said, ‘I saw you. You were happy. You were
It breaks the ice, at least. The evening progresses smoothly as they catch up with their news. Granger works with Creatures; house-elves in particular. According to Potter, she’s always had a boner for them. Weasley is an Auror, very unlikely in Draco’s opinion, but he’s a potter now, so he’s not one to talk. Longbottom’s an apprentice at a magical plant nursery. Their conversation revolves around work, and they all seem interested when Draco explains about kintsugi.
Wanting to make an effort for the alliance’s sake, Harry forked a piece of duck confit and offered it to Draco. What he received for his effort was a frightfully condescending look and the response: ‘I’m a pescetarian.’
‘Probably sent with him to bribe the right people. We’ll need some of that to help Draco with taking his new post.’
Harry paused, abruptly, unable to go on. He dropped his eyes, staring at the table between them, littered with sandwich wrappers. Bile rolled in his stomach. He had trouble reconciling that memory — Snape’s horrific experience — with the idea of his hero father. He’d replayed it in his head so many times: his father confident and loved, well-cared for, surrounded by friends. He had everything, and yet he’d felt the need to torment Snape. As much as Harry loathed Snape, he couldn’t forget that humiliation. Hanging in the air with his underwear on display while his father threatened to remove them; it was monstrous.
Esther curled his hand around the note. ‘We won’t starve for a twenty. It’ll ease our hearts to know you have a little cash with you.’
His mind is restless. Nariyoshi’s been taken to St Mungo’s a few days ago. A magical virus this time — a hex really — burns through him. His fever won’t go down and the Healers are baffled, but not Draco. The pearl of wisdom of the red dragon on his bedside table flashed its message when he returned from the hospital.
Granger is still talking. ‘We have no way of knowing whether this Creature that people say visits the rentboys and the streetlight prostitutes is—’
It had, but Draco wasn’t about to say it. It’d kept him up endless nights. He told Potter what he told himself: ‘My Harry,’ —shit, he didn’t meant to say that— ‘
Harry kept as still as possible, holding his breath. In every other fight in his life, he’d had a wand. He tried to think of what he could use as a weapon, but he knew nothing could stand against magic.
Draco had pulled away and held him as Harry, breathing hard, fell on the thick carpet. ‘Let me look after you,’ Draco said again. ‘Leave everything to me. Just let me,’ and Harry said yes, because he would give anything to this man right now.
With a last glare at the cowering woman, Draco climbs the stairs to the bedroom and falls on the bed. He rubs his face. Stupid, stupid,
He snorts. Potter trusting Draco — what a joke. Sue isn’t laughing, though; she’s looking at him intently. She’s been trying very hard to convince him, and Draco’s suddenly sure that he’s not the first person they approached. They must have had people try to sneak into the Ministry and steal the figurine, or even thrown other, more likely candidates for Potter’s affections into his path. They must be desperate. The realisation makes him breathe a little easier. It’s like a card game; the moment you read your opponent and can sense you’ve got the better hand.
Defeating him was the only thing that mattered, even if the thought of what it would cost made Harry ache.
Harry's face rippled with emotion. ‘Thank you. They were all lovely. Ron particularly appreciated the Quidditch tickets. The blue towels were … unusual.’
Malfoy lets go of Harry’s wrists. He’s still close, his body firm against Harry’s, but his words carry an edge. The amorous mood dissipates like smoke. ‘Is that what you tell yourself? That you were playing the noble hero?’
The door swings open and Harry catches the end of a particular insult directed his way, before Ron properly looks at their unexpected visitor.
“I... I can’t tell you,” his voice is apologetic but stern, as Harry looks straight at his best friends. Through this gaze he tries to convey that he knows they would accept their choice of partner no matter what, but this particular identity reveal is not his prerogative, and not his secret to share.
Their pink lips are slightly ajar as they exhale, breath catching warm on their own outstretched arm, tucked underneath the pillow. The eyelashes – stark black against porcelain nude – flutter with every inhale, but Harry knows that they are far away from awakening. It is safe to say that, out of the two of them, he is the early bird.
Standing on the top step of Ron and Hermione’s porch, Harry yet again contemplates his planned speech and wonders whether doing it this way was a good idea after all.
Their reactions are somewhat opposite to what Harry was expecting. Hermione’s eyes go wide, and with a soft “oh my!” she shifts her position to incline closer to Harry. Ron is just as dumbfounded, but his surprise is far more composed than his wife’s.
Ron smiles shakily and pulls on Harry’s outstretched arm to engulf him in a warm hug. Harry splutters in surprise, but after a second returns the gesture, clasping his arms across his protruding shoulder blades.
The words are quiet on his tongue, but in the silence of the living room he knows Ron and Hermione have definitely heard him. The half-sentence is unfinished, but tells them the needed implications behind it, all the same.
Harry suppresses a shudder, instantly remembering how a similar caress felt on his own body, but those hands would travel up, instead pausing on his shoulders where they’d begin to softly rub the tan skin hidden under Harry’s sleep shirt.
It’s not like he was running straight to the Daily Prophet, mind you, he wasn’t about to give them a field day that they are probably waiting for.
A quiet moment follows, filled only with shallow breaths of all three, and the blood drumming against Harry’s temples. He can almost sense the silent conversation between his two best friends sitting less than a couple of feet from him, and feels like a prisoner on trial, waiting for the verdict.
The moment, however, is ended by a prominent sob coming from the left-out Hermione, which prompts both men to untangle themselves from each other, and Ron to pull his wife into his lap, reaching out to wipe the evident glistening of tears from her right cheek. She half-heartedly swats at his palm but cuddles closer.
At last, taking a deep breath in, Harry stepped through the security wards and lightly knocked on the door, knowing that the inhabitants have already been alerted to his presence anyway.
“Who is she?” Ah, now that’s the question of a true teenage girl that Hermione never got to be, but still hid deep within her soul. Harry, however, looks at Ron, before replying.
.” He doesn’t know how else to explain it without complicating or misinterpreting things. This is not his story to tell and he doesn’t want to be a broken telephone.
Again, he feels the anxiety that was clutching his chest just minutes before, and a swarm of worries takes over his mind. In an attempt to steady and distract himself, Harry walks over to the fireplace, feeling eyes of both Ron and Hermione on his back, burning through the leather jacket he was wearing. Unable to watch their reaction, Harry interested himself with the ornaments etched alongside the countertop above the grate.
, who’d accept Harry no matter what. And they do say it’s better to first let the family in on the secret.
His friend is silent, but his posture only offers genuine interest in Harry’s reply. The Boy Who Lived exhales shakily.
Harry smiles openly, trying not to feel guilty for waking his friends up at 8am on a Saturday morning.
Most importantly, he remembers how Draco now looks so healthy and carefree – something that Harry thought was impossible after he met them again for the first time since the post-war trials. His chest pangs when he recalls the pale, almost greyish definition of Draco’s skin, the skeleton-like proportions of their malnourished body; but most painful of all was to see the lifeless eyes, darting around quicker than the gaze of a prey that was caught unawares.
Hermione, although understands that there is something much deeper afoot here, cannot help but also look curiously at her best friend, confused by this revelation.
“Erm… It’s not… That is…” He rambles off and ends up not saying anything coherent. Where is the vaunted Gryffindor courage, or at the very least the Slytherin confidence everyone always boasts about?
Don’t take him wrong – he bloody adores his best friend. With all his quirks, weird jokes and loud opinions, Ronald Bilius Weasley was truly the most wonderful man to call a best friend. However, it was the last characteristic of his that Harry felt like he was currently challenging.
He must have been silent for a while, because a soft cough made in Hermione’s voice pulls him out of his thoughts.
Harry can hear Hermione punching him again and starting off into her traditional tirade about emotional ranges of spoons and redhead wizards, but the Savior doesn’t really listen.
He knows that, whenever he comes back late from his shift at the Aurors’ division, he’ll find them curled up in the armchair, with a book lying on the floor beside it where Draco dropped it when they fell asleep. Them living together is still brand new, so every time this happens Harry takes his time admiring the view before him, not quite believing he is actually lucky to be able to call this – them! – his home.
“Sorry, you know, for the shouting,” says the red-headed wizard, dumping the fire iron next to the fireplace, where it lands into its holder with a click. “We’ve been getting these obnoxiously cheery volunteers going door to door, wanting money for local charities or whatnot.“
Harry let out a laugh, watching as Ron, looking just as lanky in his red chequered pajamas as he did back in their school days, ranted about the unexpected enemies of his weekend mornings. His friend looks banally domestic like this, and Harry’s heart swells endlessly at the prospect. Knowing that, merely six years after the War, his friends found the peace and joy they oh so deserved, made him not feel so guilty about the hardships they endured while helping him throughout the hardest of times.
“Yeah,” mumbles Harry in an attempt to break the silence that was starting to become a tad awkward. He focuses his gaze on his clutched arms, suddenly very interested in his own fingernails.
Ron Weasley’s neatly trimmed hair are mused in the most ridiculous ways and directions (Harry’s mind dutifully offers a Muggle expression “cows lick”) and his eyes are ogling out onto the presumed intruder of peace with a mix of sleepiness and perpetuated irritation.
Harry smiles to himself, remembering how he reached out to lightly trace the elegant curve of his lover’s spine, from the edge of the sheets all the way up to their soft cheek that have rounded healthily over the past months. Draco then mumbled something in their sleep and burrowed their face further into the pillow, still visibly revelling in the loving touches of their partner.
But this was different, in so many ways. This was built out of misunderstandings and careful dialogues, and so many emotional evenings spent together crying over mistakes they made as clueless children. All that to get these past nine months of pure happiness.
Ron and Hermione are at his sides in an instant, enveloping him in a soft, loving hug. Harry thinks, this is the only other time he ever feels at home in just an embrace. Hermione’s light laugh sounds somewhere behind his left ear, and he thinks he hears her murmur a soft “
When Ron doesn’t react, Hermione almost moves to put an authoritative hand on his shoulder, but the redhead finally opens his mouth.
“Hi,” he offers peacefully, pointedly looking at the fire iron in Ron’s hand. “I am so sorry for calling on you so early, but... Well, I have to talk to you. And ‘Mione.”
The other man sits very still, like he’s been hit with a stray Stupefy enchantment. It’s difficult to decipher his body language, with arms propped with elbows on his knees, palms hanging loosely down. He is looking somewhere through Harry, as if he suddenly became a ghost.
“It’s Harry!” Shouts Ron into the ceiling, presumably in the direction of his and his wife’s bedroom. “He wants to talk to us!”
And sure enough, soon he hears a familiar male grumbling from somewhere above and can’t help but chuckle as he imagines Ron stumbling down the staircase while mumbling something about hippogriffs and their backsides.
“Wait so… is it like, a werewolf? Or a vampire then? Cause I have no idea what kind of specific being– Ow!
“Honestly, Ronald, this is explicitly rude! Harry comes over here, about to entrust us with a very delicate secret of his, and you act like a buffoon. I would have thought your mother raised you better than this.”
Hermione does end up having to cuff her husband on the back of his head in a reprimand, before Ron finally catches up with the situation. She then raises her eyes to meet Harry’s gaze in apology, her cheeks tainted with pink embarrassment.
They are still sitting in the same position on the sofa, but Hermione’s gaze is now full of understanding care, supported by a soft reassuring smile, while Ron just gazes straight at him with so much seriousness, Harry thinks he’s never seen his friend look so determined.
, Harry thinks with an inner chuckle, it’s been thirteen years, but he is sure that it could be twenty, thirty - even half a century! - and his best friend will still look like a dishevelled owl in the mornings.
“Is that going to be a problem?” Harry’s question is blunt, and almost eerie in its vibrations. He tries to voice it as a general inquiry, but his expectant (and totally not terrified) gaze is directed straight at Ron.
Frankly, Harry is not ready for that too. He has had enough added attention on his persona in his life, and the last thing he wants is to unload that attention onto them as well. He knows it’ll have to happen eventually, of course, but before they say they are truly ready to come out, Harry will hold his tongue.
Harry remembers that, and suddenly - so much more. All the late evenings shared with a bottle of wine and quiet talks. The way Draco’s laugh is a tinkle of soft sounds that Harry desperately wants to turn into a soft blanket that he could curl up in and never let go.
“You should,” said Gita. “Whatever question you have right now, I don’t have the answer. Even the little things I know are not mine to tell.”
Harry hummed quietly in response. Even if he couldn’t completely understand, at least in the sense Malfoy was implying, he could still sympathize with the man. It had been long enough after the war but many people were still hostile toward him and others with the Dark Mark. It made sense if Malfoy saw the opportunity of overseas missions as his temporary escape.
It seemed like Malfoy was not the only one who was completely unimpressed with his attempt. Without looking up from her buttered toast, Parkinson snorted. “Come off it, Potter, leave Draco alone. He’s taken, you know.”
After one more look around the place, Draco sat on the edge of the gazebo and opened the journal he carried with him, flipping to the next page after Harry’s first message.
Inevitably, he missed his cue to say his wedding vow. Draco had to nudge him lightly with a low snicker, eyes still glinted with amusement.
Harry pondered it for another long moment. By now, he was sure about the attraction he felt toward Draco was not entirely platonic. Still, he enjoyed Draco’s company as a friend a lot and he wasn’t sure if making a move would be worth changing what he already had now. He tried to voice it to his best mate, “the thing is, Ron… I like being friends with Draco. I don't want to change and ruin it by… by wanting more?” The end of his sentence sounded more like a question than anything else.
Closing his eyes, Draco put his palm flat on his journal. He remembered doing the same gesture on Harry’s chest and feeling his magical core beat with his own. Draco controlled his breaths, picturing the bonfire, the old witch and her incantations, and the men chanting ‘
“By living in the moment. Right now.” Because now was the only thing they had. If not now, when? “We travelled so far, let’s stay here for now. In the present.”
Confused, Draco turned to Harry again, silently asking if this was supposed to make sense. The man just shrugged. “I guess magic works differently in different places,” he said.
“I was reading my journal because these past days have been so surreal. I don’t remember being nearly this happy in—well, so long. Years, maybe. And I want to remember the hardships I went through before so I don’t take this, our time together, for granted,” Draco said as he pulled Harry closer. “For me, pain is something to overcome, and it becomes an achievement that I can be proud of whenever I succeed. On the other hand, joy is just a moment to relish in the present. It’s not a currency to save so I could use it on rainy days.”
“Fine, you can touch,” he said in defeat, but not without a hint of amusement and a short breath of laugh. He bowed down low to let his long hair fall around his face, the straight strands spilled from behind his shoulders. “It’s just hair, though, nothing special.”
“But…” Malfoy frowned, uncertain. “But it looks so… excruciating. I don’t know if a heat is supposed to be that painful.”
Meme, who asked Draco and Harry to also call her that, was strong and magically powerful enough to single-handedly work on her family’s fields everyday, leaving Gita to do the rest of house chores and help their elderly neighbors. Today, though, she was leaving with Harry in the morning since the man insisted on helping. Draco wondered when the two would be back.
Amidst his outrage, Harry felt a gentle pressure on his wrists. Draco’s fingers, nimble and delicate, were caressing them, the motion light and relaxing. “It’s okay,” he murmured quietly. “We can’t do anything about it but that’s okay. I wouldn’t say it’s fair but when anything ever was? Lucius was dead, whether he deserved it or not. Mother is safe in her house arrest. And I… I can defend myself, I know I can. It’s okay, really.” Draco offered him a weak smile. “It is what it is, Harry. I didn’t mean to make you worried. Just… I had been feeling very safe and happy here with you, Hermione, and Ron, so the realisation of what would happen after this took me a little off guard. It will be okay, I’m sure.”
Gringotts was as he remembered from the last time he came to see his family’s vault get emptied. The brick walls were as cold and impenetrable, the goblins were as creepy with the unbearable air of businesslike unfriendliness.
Still slumping, Harry reached his right hand to caress a piece of parchment curling on his left wrist. Another good luck on a slap bracelet Draco gave him earlier.
“Just go get your blond prince, Harry. Bring back the old pratty-but-not-so-pratty-anymore Draco, please. I miss calling him ferret-face.”
So here was Draco Malfoy, walking uncertainly with his suitcase on the unfamiliar ground of Ngurah Rai Airport, located in a city he didn’t even know exist until a few days ago when the plane ticket arrived at his door. Right now, he looked around the buzzing crowd of excited tourists from all over the world, trying to find the sender of the said ticket among them.
“My fault.” Gita shook his head. “I brought a lot of storybooks about western fairytales to teach English to the kids around here, ones with blond princes riding white horses. I believe she got that from there,” she said, grinning. “There might be many blond foreigners in the other parts of Bali, but I’m afraid your kind is quite rare to find in Ajawera, Draco.”
Harry didn’t say anything for some moments, digesting the words. It made perfect sense, every single point Malfoy made. And he said it in the manner that implied Harry was foolish to even stress over it. Or maybe not exactly for stressing over it but for silently burying it and letting it get in the way of his attempt to build back his life. He should have told his friends. Shouldn’t have tried hiding it from Ron and Hermione. Should have considered confiding in Malfoy. Should have trusted Malfoy more as his friend.
“Well, not everyone gets the opportunity to use their ability to save the world. I need to find a creative way to utilize my skills. It’s not like he didn’t deserve it either.”
Carefully choosing his words, Harry said as he not-so-discreetly pointed to the man, “What is Malfoy doing here?”
Maya’s father suddenly exclaimed and turned to Gita to say something. The witch’s eyes widened and she nodded.
Malfoy looked so offended and cross that Harry had to stop walking again to guffaw at him. At times like this, he could almost understand why Teddy loved this man so much. He was really interesting and weird, and it was an odd delight being around him.
If the anger was simmering in him before, now fury was blazing through his veins at how this stranger was blatantly implying that Draco was a bad influence on Harry.
It had stopped bothering him, that wound from the past, but now Potter had to get back and open it again, smearing salt all over it, letting Draco writhe in the never healing pain.
The mention of his son was enough to bright Draco up. After kissing Astoria’s cheek, he left to make his way to Scorpius’s room, a little smile forming on his face. For the last six years of his post-war life, this morning routine had always been his favorite.
The kiss was intense and almost hungry. Draco could feel the urgency radiating from Harry, and it was not entirely about lust. The world around them slowly became an insignificant background, a white noise, as they passionately savoured the taste of each other.
Harry’s breath tickled Draco’s face. “I’d like that, too,” he said before closing the last inch separating their lips.
A blush crept onto those pale cheeks. Malfoy scoffed. “I have not the slightest idea of what you’re talking about, Potter.” He turned around and continued to walk, his soft grey robe billowing from the chilly wind. It unsettlingly reminded him of the late Severus Snape.
What would a rejection do to him? He had no dignity to preserve anymore. He had nothing. Might as well indulge the part of him that yearned for something he would never have. Crush that part to nothingness while all he could feel was the blank void in his chest.
Harry stared at his hair for a moment. His shoulder length, white blonde hair which fell so naturally around his pointy face. He once asked Draco why he grew his hair so long and
“Call me by your name,” Harry repeated, his tone an odd mix between a command and a plea. “Call me by your name and I’ll call you by mine.”
The game stretched into a few more rounds. When the sun began to inch to the west and the children started to be Apparated back to their houses, Gita ended their quite rowdy game with the final score of 3 -1 to Draco’s team.
Draco loved it the way it was. For him, it felt like the time stopped when they were not together, a mere blurry period when nothing mattered, and it unfroze by the time they reunited in the private of Harry’s tiny apartment.
From this slick black suitcase, Engel produced a roll of parchment. “It was stated here that Mr. Potter wished for all his wealth to be donated to Ministry-run charities, while the remainder of his personal possession would be temporarily kept in the Gringotts until all donations of his monetary assets were made. You, Draco Lucius Malfoy, will have sole access to Potters’ vault for the time being.”
“No-no, you’re not, really,” Harry said hurriedly. “It’s-I just I didn’t expect you to notice anything. No one did before”
Malfoy frowned at him, every bit of his expression silently telling Harry how much of a nuisance he was. “The Warming Charm we were all taught during our Auror training, of course.”
That made sense. Potter’s only reason to ask him to take a Muggle plane was just that registering for international Portkey would raise questions from people at home. Draco knew that Potter himself took a flight to get here a couple of weeks earlier, and he was still wondering what kind of excuse he came up with that his family let him go.
Now, over ten years into his marriage with Harry Potter, Draco still cherished his time in the morning. Harry was not an early bird by any means. Quite the opposite, really. When he was still working as an auror, Draco was convinced that Harry made it his personal mission to break the record of going to work late in all Magical Law Enforcement history. After his resignation, Draco knew Harry slept in seven days a week.
“Harry, my dear!” Molly exclaimed, her plump cheeks flush with excitement as she examined him thoroughly. “Look at you, such a handsome young man! Oh, Draco is so lucky to have you.” Her tone drifted to dreamy at the end.
The green eyes closed shut. Harry took a deep breath as his face contorted like he was in pain. “You know we can’t be together, Draco.”
As the crystals continued to merrily swirl around him, Malfoy laughed, delighted. He waved his wand again here and there, making the crystals dance in an odd but constant rhythm. With his wand not ceasing its movement, he outstretched his free hand to beckon to Harry to come closer, his own body swaying softly as if he was dancing along with the diamond dust.
Harry hummed and scooted closer, his hand didn’t cease the gentle movement. “Still,” he whispered. “But I think it was for the best.”
Draco chuckled quietly, either because of how naive he had been before or how pathetic he was right now to desperately cling to this one fantasy until the very last moment. He gave Harry his last smile, as sincere as he could muster.
His words were so earnest that it was Draco’s turn to be stunned. Right at that time, everything became quiet. Nothing in the mostly deserted hallway made a sound, only their even breathing. Draco tried to comprehend Potter’s question, his eyes still locked with those gleaming emerald ones. Every minute that passed made Draco feel even more dazed.
Beside him, Harry shifted forward to look at Gita properly. “I never asked this before, but how can the parents know where the kids want to go or when they want to go home?”
Instead of answering, Scorpius stretched his tiny body and made sleepy noises—his usual mumbling of gibberish. Draco found the sight too adorable to resist peppering more kisses on his son’s face.
Still relishing the gentle pulsing of their fused magic, Draco closed his eyes, welcoming the picture of Harry with a carefree smile that his mind conjured. This—with Scorpius in his arms, their magic blanketing them—was the only time he didn’t regret the time he shared with Harry.
Harry did not appreciate it at all, and would never think about it again, much less take it into any sort of consideration. He wondered how Draco could say all those things with barely a hint of sarcasm in his tone. Maybe some people were just born a natural at lying, but Draco had lots of practice in the past.
If he had to be honest, Harry rather liked how that idea sounded. He smiled to himself. “It can be arranged then.”
Two weeks and countless unsatisfying wanks later, Harry decided to put an end to his confusing feelings and confront Malfoy. As he knocked on the door of Malfoy’s quarters, he belatedly reconsidered whether this was a good idea or not. The answer came in the form of a full-body shiver when Malfoy’s scent was carried through the door and teased Harry’s senses.
The words stunned Harry. Did Malfoy still think Harry was trying to get him to lose his job? “I don’t need to have sex with you to know you’re an alpha, Malfoy,” Harry snapped, anger rising in him. “I told you before, I know. This has nothing to do with that.”
Malfoy tried to pull away again, but Harry wouldn’t ease up his grip. He sighed. “Let me go, Potter. You’re not thinking straight.”
“It would hardly be exciting, Potter,” Malfoy had said to him with raised eyebrows. “There was one terrorist attack using Dark Magic in Rome a few months ago and since then people keep sending in false reports. They are all convinced there is some secret cult of Dark Magic users, which I highly doubt is more than a mere conspiracy theory,” he explained, sounding very bored. “Our job will just be walking around the reported area and confirming that it is indeed a false alarm. This is a job no one wants, Potter, you’d miss your fun little patrol with your fawning fans as soon as we arrive there.”
“Do you care to provide any explanation on why you submitted an essay barely two inches long when Slughorn clearly required a full foot as the minimum length?” she demanded hotly. “Slughorn was really mad, Harry. Slughorn! The man who worships the ground you walk on, he was mad because he thinks you’re disrespecting him!”
“I never expected you to be the kind of person who discusses their future kids after the first time they have sex with someone. We haven’t even gone for a proper date yet,” Malfoy teased, snickering quietly.
Slowly, he returned his wife’s embrace. “I’ll always be fine for the two of you,” he replied quietly. “Just stay here for a little longer, will you?”
Harry didn’t know how Malfoy did it, but it had almost been a week since his heat and Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy long enough to even call his name. Every time he saw a glimpse of platinum blond hair, the man would suddenly disappear the next second. It was getting frustrating.
Draco stared at Potter’s smile blankly for five solid seconds before slumping back against the windowsill. That’s it, he had had enough of this. “Seriously, Potter, what do you want from me? I stopped bothering you from the beginning of this year, is it too hard to reciprocate the gesture?”
A lump rose to Draco’s throat the same time he felt his chest constricted. This was the place when they decided to borrow their time, it made sense if Harry thought his invitation to return was to give it back. But Draco was greedy. He wanted to keep their time together for longer. Forever. Wouldn’t Harry want it, too?
“Wait, you don’t know knock knock jokes? Is it a Muggle thing?” Potter continued, furrowing his brows a little. The frown was gone in a second, his smile back in place. “It’s okay, though. I can teach you. If I say
He held his left arm out to Malfoy instead and slapped the toy to his wrist. The long plastic curled around it in a way that resembled a bracelet.
Draco would have let out a breath of relief that Engel’s arrival to his house proved the first rumour was the true one, that Potter was away all this time to do some ridiculously noble deeds in Merlin knows where, but the initial news struck him again.
“Hey, Malfoy,” he greeted, trying to sound pleasant. Then, as though an afterthought, he added, “good morning.”
They stayed there in silence for a while, arms around each other and a soft smile on their faces, wistful for whatever
Harry’s breath hitched as the pale hand touched his but Malfoy didn’t seem to be fazed. He held up the long parchment and slapped it lightly on his wrist. The thin sheet curled gently like a peculiar kind of bracelet.
“You must be Draco,” she said with her thickly accented voice. “I’m Gita. It’s so nice to meet you.” She offered him her hand.
At the thought of that, Draco wanted to laugh. The lengths they took to conceal their relationship. He even flew across the globe the Muggle way. Lucius would die from a heart attack if he knew—assuming he still had the energy to care.
Draco knew the deal he had with Weasley and Granger. He would go into Potter’s vault, claim all his personal belongings, and send them straight to the remaining two of the Golden Trio. But deep down, he knew he wouldn’t just do it like that.
This time Harry didn’t know what to say, realizing he never thought about that. So what if Malfoy admitted he was an alpha? Harry was honest when he said he wouldn’t try to get Malfoy to lose his job, or even personally want him gone. It’s not like he could do that either. He knew McGonagall and was sure the Headmistress wouldn’t just hire anyone if she wasn’t certain they could do their job properly. And Malfoy had been a perfect Potions professor so far.
Slowly, he turned to face his furious boyfriend as Hermione and Ron ushered a confused Healer out of his room, following her and quietly closing the door behind their backs. Great, now they were leaving Harry to deal with this alone. Draco wouldn’t hold back if no one was around.
Draco’s love language was turning Harry’s night from horrible to spectacular by just being there and
If there was anything Harry learned in his years living in the Wizarding World, it’s that their Ministry of Magic was corrupted in a sense that public opinions often mattered more for them than integrity. Still, it was hard to believe that they would go as far as obscuring a murder done by their own, the victim being a convicted Death Eater or not.
Malfoy’s body, still half-pressed to Harry’s side, went stiff. Harry didn’t know if it was a good or bad sign, but it was a reaction nonetheless. Maybe pleading could work.
instead. And he was sure Harry, his partner in crime, would take his hand and join him in this heist.
The grey eyes stared at him so intensely that Harry had to consciously refrain himself from fidgeting. “Of course I do.”
“I’m pretty sure it’s more than just your hair, Draco,” Gita said conversationally. “And she did brag to her friends after that night, so there would probably be more of those little fans in my class later.”
Pretty much short of other options, Draco tried to execute his plan. He skirted the edge of the court and quickly distanced himself from the square, just far enough that the opponents would take his bait. It worked. A boy threw the ball to him, which he swiftly dodged. With all his might, Draco sped to the square.
Harry walked faster and caught up to him, his breath coming out in white puffs, feeling suddenly energized. “Liar. I know you watched that movie with Teddy. He told me.”
Harry shoved his shoulder, pouting harder for being laughed at. “You wouldn’t understand, Draco. You’re basically the grand prize winner of the gene pool lottery. You haven’t gained any weight since we got married. Meanwhile, if I miss one workout, all my muscles turn to fat.”
However, it couldn’t reach Draco. He would have laughed at the irony, if only he had any energy left for such playful expression. The War had drained him empty. He had lost everything one could possibly be stripped off of. His belief, his trust for his parents, his pride, his future. It wouldn’t be long until they took the rest away. His family’s wealth, the ground he was standing on, his family’s name.
The heat burned and burned, consuming every nerve in Draco’s body. He clutched at Harry, wanting to feel the heat he emitted from himself, wanting to burn together.
But it seemed special enough for Maya. She ran her fingers through Draco’s locks, caressing it softly, before she let out another high-pitched squeal. She turned to Gita and started to ramble excitedly, making the woman laugh again.
When she reached them, Draco belatedly realized that the girl was actually a woman, maybe a few years older than him, but her figure was so petite that she could easily pass as a little girl from afar. Standing in front of her, Draco mentally estimated about a feet height difference between them. Her skin was a beautiful shade of dark brown, almost golden under the sunlight, and she stared at him with her equally dark brown eyes.
“And disappoint these elated children?” Gita raised her eyebrows in a calculative expression. “I have a better idea. What do you say about running around a bit this afternoon?”
“Beautiful,” he whispered, his voice fervent. Slowly, he looked up to meet Draco’s dilated grey eyes, his expression turned into a soft, wistful smile. “Mine.”
Harry hadn’t even found a strong enough adjective to describe the beautiful scenery in front of him in itself, and he was absolutely not ready for what greeted him as he turned around. Malfoy was a few meters from him, standing tall among the ice crystals. His platinum blond hair was shining gently under the bright sunlight, looking almost otherworldly with the all-white background of the neverending snow. Framed by the light hair was his face, as pale as ever, but the scowl he sported the entire afternoon was gone. In its place was a delighted smile, open and genuine, and Harry was rendered completely speechless. He didn’t think he’d ever seen Malfoy like this. He looked like he came straight out of a fairy-tale.
Draco turned to him, finding the skin of Harry’s cheekbone almost shimmering under the golden light. It was mesmerizing. “Is this what?” he asked, a little breathless.
As if reading his thoughts, Engel stepped next to him and said, “Most of the wealth has been allocated as to the wish of the deceased. The goblins are notoriously fast when it comes to moving people’s funds like this.”
Before Draco could answer again, Harry thrust deeper, his hips faltering in their slow rhythm. Draco gasped as another wave of pleasure ran through his body like a shiver. Harry leaned down, his mouth finding the sensitive skin just below his ear, tickling Draco with his labored breaths.
He could almost hear a smile in Harry’s voice when he replied, “I don’t know. It might be, later in the future.”
Suddenly, Draco withdrew one of his hands and—before Harry could process the loss—slowly put it on the base of Harry’s neck. He inhaled a rushed breath as he felt the warm hand make contact with his skin, his eyes unable to look away.
The way Hermione said his name was enough to tell him that something was wrong. “What happened?” He could feel anxiety creeping out in his system.
Since Harry had gone through so much just to make sure their memories wouldn’t hurt him the way it would otherwise, Draco would respect him the way he would want. By reminiscing what they had. What they once were.
When he was fully inside, Draco sighed from the familiarity of weight inside of him. He felt Harry pausing to let him adjust, and Draco clenched on him in return, making him groan. Understanding the silent message, Harry began to thrust.
but the fact that Malfoy was right there with him, but they were both still fully clothed. Why wasn’t Malfoy fucking him yet? Harry was an omega in heat and Malfoy was an alpha. And Harry was pretty much presenting himself to Malfoy. Wouldn’t Malfoy want him as much as Harry wanted him right now? Harry couldn’t concentrate long enough to answer that, but he didn’t care. All he knew was that he needed to change that
“What?!” Harry immediately paled, knowing what was coming for him. “You told him? Why would you do that?!”
It was an impossible task. How could Harry relax when his whole body was aflame, wired from the tip of his toes to the last strand of his hair? But Malfoy hadn’t stopped growing as he continued to fuck into Harry. If Harry didn’t unwind the tension in his body, soon Malfoy would be too big to penetrate him. Exhaling slowly through his nose, Harry tried to loosen up.
That in itself was very confusing. People presented as their inner wolf at the age of twenty, so the scent couldn’t come from a student. But no alpha was allowed to work at schools or anywhere with a lot of children. It was unexpected to smell that scent first thing after entering the Great Hall of Hogwarts.
He could tell Malfoy noticed him before he reached the end of the table where he was eating with Parkinson and a handful of other Eighth year Slytherins. The grey eyes caught his and they widened for a second before Malfoy turned to Parkinson next to him, speaking to her rapidly, one of his hands reaching for his bag.
Draco smiled to himself. Just one more reason to get married, then. “I’ll get married and you’ll leave the country. We don’t have that much time left, do we?”
Harry stares hard at the blond's face and his gaze inevitably focuses on his thin, shiny lips. No, it's not shiny, it's
It was hard to admit, but Harry’s plan actually worked. All the effort Harry took to provide the time and distance for Draco to move on was proven to not be in vain when Draco found himself making peace with the shocking information in just a few days since discovering it.
But, if Malfoy’s name escaped his mouth when he came, Harry wouldn’t admit it until the end of time.
Draco tried to regain his breath as he basked in the post-orgasmic bliss, relishing the slow drag of Harry’s cock as he pulled out of him. Harry, also panting heavily, flicked his hand carelessly and Draco felt a tingling sensation of a Cleaning Charm wash over him. Yet another show of Harry’s powerful magic.
The day had barely started but Draco already felt tiredness down to his bones. He couldn’t get any sleep last night, tossing and turning on his bed. Weasley’s accusing look wouldn’t leave his mind. That look was sobering, to say the least. It brought up memories, and made what was supposed to be a forgotten dream resurface as hidden reality.
He thought about their small but cosy wedding venue, picturing it getting filled with people. It didn’t even matter that he knew every single one of them, the problem was that they all would have their focus on him. A suppressed shudder went through his spine.
Under the darkening sky, Harry’s eyes shone brighter as he stared straight into Draco’s. “I don’t think I ever saw you that happy and carefree before,” he whispered. “You’re absolutely stunning.”
“Of course it’s freezing. This is the Arctic, Potter, it’s supposed to be cold. Did you do any kind of research before Portkeying yourself to the northernmost part of Earth?” Malfoy said flatly, long legs not slowing their steps. “Did you even know where you’d be assigned when you volunteered yourself for this overseas mission?”
“Alice,” Potter said, grinning wider. He seemed to think of something and added, “now you’re supposed to say
He needed to know why Potter wrote his name in his will. And this was the only way to get the answer.
Malfoy’s smile just widened when he noticed he’d gotten Harry’s attention. With deliberate slowness, he produced his wand from his sleeve and started waving it around in the most graceful movement Harry could dare to imagine. He felt his breath hitch as the ice crystals swirled around Malfoy, obeying whatever command the man gave them.
“Good evening, sir. I didn’t want to interrupt but it seems like you have been having a pleasant conversation with my partner, I couldn’t help but to join in,” Draco said smoothly, the smile still in place, thinly veiling his hatred for Mr. Grinspoon.
Suddenly, the air around them shifted. Malfoy’s eyes hardened and Harry could feel his scent had changed, smelling like danger, as if Malfoy tried to warn him away. “What do you mean by that?” he asked quietly.
“What does it mean?” Harry said, offended. “And it was a calculated risk, okay? As I said, I landed on a tree.”
“Harry,” Draco panted breathlessly when Harry moved to kiss his jaw, slowly going down and down, tracing the line of his pale neck.
He stood up to look at the mess he made in his kitchen. The explosion was massive, almost too massive to be coming from an average-sized baking pan. The batter was splattered everywhere. It reached the farthest corner of his kitchen, some even stuck on the ceiling.
Draco sighed and relaxed in the embrace, relishing the sudden yet subtle shift of the mood between them. He leaned his head on Harry’s broad shoulder, warmth and contentment began slowly to spread in his heart, almost wary and hesitant.
“I survive like I always did,” Draco said solemnly. “But it’s not a rainy day now, and I rather wish to make this happiness last as long as possible.”
But still. It felt almost real here, and Draco would take anything he could get, any last moment he could have. If they had to part ways soon, he at least wanted to have this for now.
But before they completely transformed to whoever they wanted to be for now, Draco had another thing to ask. One other thing he wanted to know before the future would stop to matter for them, at least for the time being.
Moaning louder, Harry pushed his hips to meet Malfoy’s teasing fingers. When the first digit penetrated his entrance without any resistance, Harry desperately clenched his ass. He was hungry for more and Malfoy just wasn’t fast enough.
He stared back at Potter with defiance. “Considering the fact that you’re the only one contributing to the joke sharing concept of this friendship, what do you
Granger and Weasley frowned, sharing a silent conversation between them, and gave him a sceptical look. The two of them practically barged their way into the Manor first thing in the morning after they received the news of their dear friend’s death, thinking it had been Draco’s plot all along. Draco had run out of ideas to convince them that he was as clueless as they were with everything going on.
That sounded like something the Savior would do, like a way Harry Potter would leave the world. Grand and noble. It was especially gallant after he had disappeared from the British wizarding community years ago. No one had seen him since, but the rumour spread that Potter was somewhere in the most remote area on the globe, doing volunteer work to conserve the endangered species of magical creatures. Other rumour stated he ran away to a beautiful island with his mistresses to live in a seclusion, avoiding the fame and spotlight he got at home. Draco had never believed the latter.
“Not really. I actually got my qualification to work in the government office, but I came back after school for Meme.”
Raising his eyebrows high, Harry stared at him. “Did you just,” he deadpanned, “quote Elsa from that Frozen movie?”
The frown on Harry’s face got deeper. He looked wary as he digested Draco’s words. “And what is that?”
Malfoy eyebrows raised and looked up to meet his eyes. Harry didn’t know what expression his face was sporting at the moment, but whatever it was softened Malfoy’s demeanour a little. “What I’m trying to say is, it’s completely okay to be confused. There’s no rush to decide what you want to do. Even if you decide on something and it doesn’t work out, you can always leave it and do other things. We’re young, Potter, it’s our prime time to make mistakes.”
Harry gulped as his mind provided him with that delicious scent, flooding his brain with memories of when he walked past Malfoy and that scent blanketed him. It almost felt like a trap and an Imperius was put on Harry as an invisible force pushed him toward Malfoy. At that moment, Harry couldn’t think of anything but how much he wanted Malfoy to take him, right there and then.
It was almost funny how Harry kept his distance while Draco put his belongings in the trunk. Harry stood by the tiny window of their cottage, watching Draco pack his things with his uncertain gaze. He seemed like he was about to offer help but wasn’t sure how to approach Draco. It could have been amusing, Draco would have laughed if he didn’t feel so tired.
Harry’s eyes fluttered open. He blinked, once, twice, adjusting to the light in the room, until he focused on Draco’s face. He let out a quiet groan and rolled to bury his face on a pillow. “Don’t remind me of that,” he rasped in a sleep-heavy voice.
“No, this isn’t right. The War was over, no one should still live in fear of being unfairly killed.” Harry scooted even closer, his hands gripping Draco’s painfully tight in his anger. The vulnerability Draco showed him triggered an overwhelming feeling of indignation in him. “People didn’t sacrifice themselves to defeat Voldemort just for more people to die like that. There must be a way to make the Ministry properly convict the murder.”
Harry only snorted in response and moved to take the suitcase from Draco’s hand. “Come on, let’s get going.”
“You fucking rash halfwit,” Draco hissed as he marched to his bed. “Are you that eager to fucking die?”
help you? Potter, you literally saved my life. From literal death. And you’ve been nice to me this year when you really didn’t have to. I owe you too much, some tutoring wouldn’t put a dent in it.”
“Harry,” his lover said. That was the only word Harry uttered before he straddled Draco’s torso and devoured his waiting lips in hungry kisses.
It’s not that Draco didn’t like exploring the world, discovering what it had to offer, he just relished in the consistency of home. How it had always been the grounding constant amid the chaos of his life. Until, of course, his home couldn’t contain all the disruption happening outside of it. Chaos infiltrated his home, the manor his ancestors built with pride and the school he thought would always be a safe sanctuary for him.
Flustered at being caught ogling, Harry quickly averted his gaze upward. He then remembered the gift he prepared before, still tucked in his pocket. “I have something for you.”
). When the video started, he became even more unbearably annoying, pausing every ten seconds to ask questions Harry couldn't answer.
As if Draco would need a reminder for that. Their time was ticking. Soon, he would have to return everything he borrowed, inflated by the interest.
To say that Draco was puzzled to find this man in front of his door first thing in the morning was completely justified. The puzzlement multiplied by a hundred when the wizard introduced himself as Harry Potter’s solicitor.
Harry, in fact, did not know. Draco never said those three words before, but he looked at him as if the fact had always been there and Harry should have known sooner. It was probable, with the way Draco gazed into his eyes and smiled at the very thought of him.
“Okay, Potter, calm down.” Malfoy raised his hands in a non-threatening gesture. “You’re in heat and you need help. I’ll take you to Madam Pomfrey,” he decided, his posture straightened and eyes steeled like he was ready to tackle a mission.
“It doesn’t make sense.” Draco shook his head. “Apparating alone is dangerous enough. It requires so much focus that a little slip can cause a life-threatening Splinching. You’re not supposed to Apparate with a toddler, and you’re telling me people here just… fling their children with Apparition-like magic?”
Draco sat up on the bed, taking Scorpius and placing him on his lap. For a few moments in the peaceful morning, Draco indulged himself with more lazy cuddles with the youngest Malfoy. When he just woke up, Scorpius always felt perfectly warm and the citrus-scented soap Astoria bathed him with made him smell amazing. This was what Draco believed heaven would be like.
The thing was, Potter didn’t come to insult him or try to guilt trip him for what he did in the past like most students who stopped him in the empty corridors of Hogwarts. No. Potter approached him every time to tell him
The corner of Harry’s eyes crinkled from his smile. “Of course I haven’t,” he said quietly, “I don’t think I could put it into words.”
He would like to say that he forgot not to fall in love with Harry, but it would be a lie. He had loved him long before, beyond the primal passion and the thrill of first love. He had always known what he wanted. The only problem was this time, Draco forgot he couldn’t have what he wanted.
Draco turned to Molly while keeping his hand on Harry's arm. “Thank you so much, Molly, but maybe I should take over from here?” he said politely with a small smile. “I think I can catch him if he falls again.”
The idea of people not being aware of the change was almost mind-blowing to Draco, because for him, it was as if his whole world was flipped. It felt obvious from how Harry casually took his hand every time they went out for a lazy stroll. It had to be noticeable from the way Draco touched Harry in the most natural way possible, no longer questioning what was allowed between them. It couldn’t be missed from the contented gaze they threw each other.
Harry refuses to take the blame, though, because they got along surprisingly well after recovering from the fact that both were only victims of an evil war none of them ever asked. Draco is still a snarky, sarcastic wanker, but an extremely interesting one at that. He's genuinely funny, intelligent, and always curious about things he doesn't know.
Slowly, Draco walked down the cobblestone path leading to the Manor, every step he took felt like a big task as he dragged his heavy feet to move. It started to rain lightly when he opened the gate to his house, but Draco didn’t cast an Umbrella Charm or try to walk faster to avoid the drops of water falling from the sky. He couldn’t tell how much he took his time to reach the Manor until he grand porch in front of it and found he was soaking wet. Draco didn’t bother with a Drying Charm.
Draco tilts his head in confusion. And the light catches both his cheekbone and lips, making them shine as if challenging Harry. "Huh?"
He stared straight to his eyes, the grey eyes meeting green. Suddenly, Harry felt much calmer, as though the world disappeared, leaving just the two of them in the moment. Those grey eyes, as they always did, anchored him to the warm feeling of serenity, of safety, of
? Oh my God, Ron, could Draco file a divorce right after we’re officially married? And this suit is too tight, what if I hyperventilate and faint—”
It was a wide clearing on the top of a low hill with a cliff at the west side of it, facing the sunset. In the middle of it, men were stacking a huge pile of firewoods while the women separated themselves to one side on the clearing to organize the pots they brought here. All around them, the kids were merrily running around in their beautiful traditional clothes.
The pleasure built up, mounting and mounting, but it never reached the peak. Harry moaned in frustration, his body aflame. “I can’t… Malfoy, I need you to fuck me.”
“Okay?” Draco mumbled uncertainly as he moved to gather his belongings on the table, preparing to escape from this bizarre situation.
Right now, as he embraced the darkness that began to fall on them as the sun had completely retreated for the day, Draco couldn’t remember one single reason for what this had to be a mere farewell between him and Harry. He wanted this forever. He wanted Harry, now and always.
He leaned forward to press another lingering kiss on his lips. This time a little less innocent and a lot more passionate.
Draco looked up to find Astoria walking gracefully towards them, her brown eyes gazed calculatively on the two guests sitting in front of him. She stopped to stand next to Draco’s armchair, her slender hand landed on his shoulder in a grounding gesture.
But there was more to it. Despite this letter sounding like the final message, there were more pages filled with Harry’s writing left in his journal. Before Draco could flip to the next page, a voice called him.
“Your immobile legs said otherwise.” Hermione threw him the same unimpressed look as the one his Healer gave. “That’s very reckless, Harry, even for you.”
“It was pure luck and you know it,” Harry retorted without any heat as he joined Draco on the ground.
He felt Malfoy laugh breathlessly against his lips, but Harry didn’t care. He wanted Malfoy and he wanted him now. Without breaking his kiss, Harry maneuvered Malfoy to where he assumed Malfoy’s bedroom was. He was satisfied to find a huge bed from the corner of his vision after hastily opening the door. Not wanting to waste any more time, Harry was all but throwing Malfoy onto the bed.
The girl grinned wider before her expression dimmed. She hesitated before saying quietly, “back then… when you go, Harry get really sad.”
Walking when your whole body felt like it was on fire wasn’t an easy task, but Harry tried to rush as fast as he could. Turned out, he still wasn’t fast enough. He was just two hallways away from his quarters when footsteps were heard from behind him.
The garden of Malfoy Manor which Draco was staring at was extensive and lush, expanding to every direction with various kinds of plants, both magical and non magical. The vivid green grass covered every inch of the Manor. It was thick but well trimmed, decorated with splashes of vibrant colours from the flowers scattered in small patches. Draco remembered running around that ground as a small child, his mother watching him with a book on her lap and a cup of tea in her hand. He remembered laughter when his mother cast a spell to make the daisies dance along with a joyful tune. He remembered the softness when she hugged and caressed him once he fell down and scraped his knee. He remembered when his father led him there with his very first broomstick, patiently teaching him how to float and leave the earth.
When a familiar, lubed finger gently prodded into his entrance, Draco spread his legs wider in invitation, unashamed to let Harry know how eager and ready he was. Harry, being the good husband that he was, gladly obliged. Starting with one, two, and then three fingers inside him, stretching and exploring.
Or maybe this was the advantage he could only get from Draco. Being open and vulnerable. Maybe this was what Harry needed from him, secret intimacy from someone no one would expect the Savior would drag into his bed. The whole thing felt bizarre even to Draco amid the numbness he felt in his days, but maybe the deviance was what Harry got off to. And if it was the case, Draco would give him any time he needed it.
At that, Draco laughed, shaking his head in amusement. “Whatever you want to tell yourself, Birthday Boy.”
Malfoy looked straight at him, waiting for Harry to respond. When the silence stretched too long and words still failed Harry, Malfoy opened his mouth again. “It’s not that I didn’t try. I just didn’t want to be nosy. Even right now, I’m wondering if I’ve crossed the line.” A small frown appeared on his face.
Draco pondered on the question for a while. It’s been quite long since he asked that question to himself. The last time was right after the war, when everything was chaotic rubbles and ashes. After he was freed from his charges, he sat alone in his room, blanketed in the remaining gloomy shadow of the Dark Lord, and thought:
He smiles again, only this time much more nervously. Ron is still visibly stunned, trying to figure out what the heck is going on, however after a couple of seconds his inner system seems to have rebooted, and he replies:
“Alright mate, you can be as secretive as you wish about your mysterious lover, - for now, mind you! – not that I care,” Ron rolls his eyes, but there is no malice in his retort, which Harry, of course, knows. “But rewinding back to my earlier confusion, tell us at least one thing: are they human?”
Surprisingly, it didn’t scare him, the prospects of this. Deep down there was this assurance that he will not identify in his mind for some years, yet still he somehow knew that doing this was the best turn his life could take.
“Oh?” Softly prompts Hermione, moving around the couch to sit on the ottoman besides Ron, who follows with “speak out mate, you know we’re right there with you, no matter what.”
The woman of the house proceeds to tiptoe past, until she stands behind the couch, at the spot where Ron is sitting, and lightly leans forward against the back of the furniture, resting her palms on her husband’s shoulders. Ron, in his turn, automatically catches her hands in his larger ones, holding onto them like a lifeline.
“Thanks, Ron,” Harry offers, and reaches out to clasp the other man on the shoulder, squeezing it lightly. Still, he feels himself relax a copious amount.
Hearing descending footsteps behind him, Harry turned his head and soon flashes a warm smile to his other best friend, who has taken her time to throw on a fuzzy blue robe and a pair of woollen socks, knitted, undoubtedly, by her mother-in-law.
“I just said that we do! Yeesh, woman,” Ron whips around to glare at Hermione, but she just sticks her tongue out at him, before turning to Harry.
Draco often sleeps on their stomach - something that Harry will never understand, and what in the beginning used to become a source of some of their insignificant bickerings. Their head is conveniently turned to the right, facing Harry, so the dark-haired man can take his time admiring the sculpted features of Draco’s face.
Malfoy sleeps topless, which gives Harry a wonderful show every morning and night (especially the latter). On this morning, however, the sunlight caught the dip of Draco’s spine, dancing on the pale skin glistened with sweat – a leftover reminder of the passionate night that preceded that moment.
Hermione smiles reassuringly, and the gleam in her warm eyes calms Harry down a whole lot. But then again, she was never the one he was truly worried about.
“Hi Harry,” Hermione’s voice is unusually quiet and is still laced with repose, but he still notes her brown eyes darting across his body, making sure he is alright and safe - a habit she has picked up long ago, ever since she saw him battle the troll in the faithful girls’ bathroom.
“So,” finally manages Hermione, turning to look at Harry, who is still closely pressed to Ron’s other side. “To alter my previous question – who is
Harry seriously thinks he is about to break down crying. He tries to cover up the imminent waterfall of tears with a laugh, but that just prompts more emotions to pour out, completely wrecking his posture.
“What? Oh, yeah,” replies he absentmindedly. “Everything is alright, ‘Mione, nothing to worry about at all!”
His relationship, or whatever it was, with Ginny was already as public as it could get, so he didn’t need to come to his friends and announce that “yeah, I’m kind of in a relationship now, I think?”
Finally managing to repress the not-unwanted, but distracting memory, the man catches the flicker of relaxation in both of his friends eyes. Like when they touched each other –  they finally felt at peace.
Plus, it was probably for the best then. He would never have been able to have that conversation with Ron, of all people, not when it would regard his younger sister.
.” A statement, rather than a question or an expression of disbelief. Harry lifts his head to look at Hermione, who is as calm as if she had just stated a simple observation about the weather. He stays silent but slowly shakes his head, confirming his friend’s suspicion.
Instead, he recalls this morning, just a couple of hours ago, when he woke up with the first light and shifted to stare at the body beside him.
