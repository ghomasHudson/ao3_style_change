“What? Never seen a man shirtless before?” I snapped wanting to get back on track to keeping her out of the books, but confused why she didn’t seem scared of me.
I heard a fierce scream from behind me, then the fateful words.
I knew I would end up dead, but I didn't care.
I didn't have time to try to fix him, Voldemort plucked me off him grabbing me harshly, my small size never more evident than then.
“Lucius! I wasn’t expecting you.” He said with a hint of annoyance that seemed highly restrained. He spun around and walked over to Lucius as if I didn’t exist, still too tired to stand up on his floor. Malfoy Sr. didn’t seem to notice me and smiled at Snape pouring himself a whisky.
“That’s what I thought. You can have him. Filthy.” He said muttering the last word under his breath. I had been so controlled holding back all my emotions lately I felt like a thin window that had been holding it back cracked.
"Of course. Here I was thinking we made progress this morning only for you to go back to ignoring me. Clearly you just don't want me." I said hating myself for caring, but unable to not care.
"Granger, you go in like that and you will leave with nothing on. No one is to touch you. I repeat, you CANNOT go in there like that." He warned me, his temper showing, his grip on my arm bruising me. I gasped in pain and he released me finally.
I sat at the late night staff meeting barely paying attention. They were arguing about which colors to display for Christmas holidays and I just couldn’t be bothered. My mind was on her.
The fuck.
There was a long pause. I waited for my death. He had killed people for breathing too loudly. Surely he wouldn’t hold back if explicitly asked to kill someone. I chanced a glance up to see him staring at me angry…yet his wand hadn’t moved.
"I got you." The soft words came from in front of me, though there was nothing there.
Apparently my teaching methods are ineffective. Just a little threat of death and torture was all you needed.
"Let's go."
"How valiant of him. Except you can't win a war alone Granger. He was a fool." The Dark Lord hissed, raising his own wand ready to hit me with a curse at a moment's notice.
"The Dark Lord can feel her magic trying to meld with mine. I had been wondering…I feel way more protective of her than I have anyone else. It makes sense. You HAD to know, right?" I asked my anger dying down a bit realizing he didn't seem to have picked up on it at all. He shook his head, but I could see the gears in his head turning wildly at the possibility. He stood up suddenly and went to one of his bookcases taking out an ancient tomb I had never seen him read before.
“I’m not here to judge. You know the age difference between Tonks and I…Clearly love doesn’t have boundaries.” He said thoughtfully. I spun on him quickly.
The pain coursed through my body with a stronger intensity that I had ever felt. I had truly pissed him off.
After what felt like forever I found her sitting at the base of an apple tree, slumped over and blue from the cold.
"Miss. Granger. We meet again." The Dark Lord said, his nose turned up at me disgusted, what was left of it anyways. I tried to right myself wearing just a skirt and white shirt and having fallen over quite brilliantly when Snape threw me.
Dumbledore was there.
Harry was staring at me, pale, but alive.
“She as in…as in Granger?” He asked shocked.
“You know, she’s quite brilliant. I don’t know why you hate her so much. She’s come to me crying over some of the horrid things you say to her.” Minerva said disapprovingly, tisking at me.
I slowly crawled to Harry, pulling him aside not wanting him trampled on during the battle that was about to erupt.
“Fine. Most of the time.” He agreed. I nodded accepting the second apology hoping he left it at that this time.
"Nope. Orders are orders. Let's go." The tall dark man said, offering Severus a hand.
"Well, Voldemort has access to Dumbledore through Severus. Yet no one is available to spy on you. Here I am serving his goals and not even asking for recognition. How Death Eater esq of me." He said with a smirk giving himself a bow at his own brilliance.
“No. What’s funny is you thinking you have any right to care what book I’m reading. If I want to practice the dark arts, then so be it.” I said refusing to back down.
“In what? Sex ed?” He said with amusement. The comment stung a bit. I had crossed the line more than I should have. I felt slightly guilty, yet a larger part of me felt no guilt at all. Fuck them. They wanted me to spy, and I have done my job perfectly. I was the reason they were still alive with a fighting chance. They should be appreciative.
“Yes, well, clearly I did well to study up on those spells. I didn’t anticipate using them on you obviously, but they are useful nonetheless.” I said propping his head on the pillow stressing over how pale he was. I poured more of my potion in his mouth and surprisingly he seemed to perk up with it and his shaking died down.
And I hated her for it.
His words echoed in my mind making me uncomfortably warm for some insane reason. While my logic said I should have him, my body clearly had other ideas. He had wanted me to enjoy it and had even refused to go further until I told him I was ready. It was bewildering how he had taken every ounce on control from me, but yet had still made sure I knew I could stop him at any point.
“I agree, I will take that task.” Malfoy Sr. urged unhappy he was being pushed out.
“How did she get into Voldemort’s hands?” The headmaster asked again taking a seat on one of my chairs, his grand purple robes sparkling oddly in the firelight.
“Seems you won’t be single much longer.” She said with a smile ringing me up.
I skipped his classes without any regret.
“Of course my Lord. I didn’t want to disappoint you again.” I said, my head tilted downward.
“You want to learn how to make spells? Lucky for you, I am your person. We will start small and work up. My only condition is you don’t practice anything you don’t know the effects of on anyone until we have had time to test it ourselves. If we don’t know the counter curse this can turn deadly fast.” He explained going back to teacher mode, his playful air from earlier evaporating.
"Hermione!" Mr. Wesley hissed, but I ignored it walking forward knowing chances were I would be walking to my death.
“I just didn’t get to appreciate your good looks last time.” She said with just a hint of playfulness. I wanted to be angry and beat it into her not to touch the books. Terrify her and leave her traumatized if that’s what it took.
"I knew you were lying. Don't worry. The amusement of your choice of lies to try to convince me not to die was quite funny and actually helped, though not in the way you guessed. You're forgetting I can read minds." He said teasingly, enjoying my reaction to the fullest. I sighed, relieved and thankful I had dodged that bullet.
I got dressed slowly my thoughts swirling and rushing back and forth trying to make sense of everything. I was late for Charms, but luckily no one seemed to care and I slipped into my desk quietly taking notes.
A few doors down I found the kitchens where Severus was cooking in just his sweatpants, looking more attractive than I would have liked to admit. When he saw me he immediately smiled carefree and relaxed.
"Yes, very curious indeed. I decided to do a little digging. First into Grangers history. Did you know that she has empaths in both her mom and dads bloodlines?" He asked me. I shook my head having thought she was just a random genetic fluke.
"It's called acting." He sneered annoyed at my insolence.
Snape didn’t say anything when we got in, just waved his hand to unlock the supplies cabinet door for us. He seemed broodier than usual. The class was silent, their focus on not failing the first exam of the year, so when Snape finally spoke everyone jumped up.
I expected Hogsmeade to cheer me up and pull me out of the bad mood I had been in lately. I found myself just wandering aimlessly while the happy couples and groups of friends enjoyed themselves laughing and smiling together.
I have never done more than kiss. I can’t do this.
“Okay, maybe I will stay for one meal.” I said, my stomach grumbling from having missed dinner.
"Why are you out here alone?" A familiar voice said, interrupting the silence of looking over the frozen lake. I felt my heart skip a beat and I chanced a glance over my shoulder. He was waiting with his death eater robes already on.
I expected silence again, but after a moment I got her reply feeling a rush of relief with it.
"Then don't leave me." I said putting the goblet down and kissing him. I wasn't nearly as good as he was, but he kissed me back quickly taking control, his hand going onto my hair tipping my face perfectly.
"Your pregnant?" I asked shocked. Minnie nodded enthusiastically, rubbing her rounded belly quite happily.
"I had no idea she had any magic in her lines." I said honestly. It never mattered to me. I could tell it meant everything to him though.
"I assumed you were a gold digger. Evidently not. Just thirsty." She said with a salacious smile eating her food amused.
“Fine.” I mumbled putting the fork down and drinking from my cup.
He looked up when there was just one other student in the room coming out of his grading trance and sighed annoyed they were taking so long. His eyes met mine and I bit my lip again feeling anxious.
The Dark Lord slashed his wand without warning attacking Dumbledore, the curse easily waved off. Chaos ensued with both sides erupting in battle. It was pointless. I was going to die anyways so I crumpled next to Harry letting the coldness from blood less overtake me.
"I do. The question is, do you?" She questioned cheekily intentionally riling me up. I expected her to refuse to drink it knowing the side effects would be her hair changing to a pure white color so I could give her detention. I needed an excuse to keep her behind yet again for her lessons and to yell at her in this case for studying the Dark Arts.
“Dobby, I’m fine! I promise.” I said reluctant to bug them, but the moment I entered the kitchen with the amazing smelling food that they cooked my hunger came out full force.
His voice rang through my foggy brain and I realized he could do reverse legilimency on me to put his thoughts in my mind. Which was odd since my mind was a scrambled mess.
“Well, I had this dream. A very vivid dream. It was mainly blackness, but he was there. It was like…like I was in his mind or something. He seemed happy and that in itself was just weird. We were dancing and…” I trailed off since he had jumped up, grabbing his wand and rushing around me. I had to run to keep up.
“Where are you Severus?” She asked me leaning her head against my shoulder letting me lead her in a slow dance to the classical music that played in the background.
“What is that?” Harry asked curiously as we walked back slowly.
The moment I got into the headmasters office I felt my panic starting to come back. He was awake, but in long flowing pajama like robes as opposed to his normal robes. I had to wonder if the old man ever slept.
“And if I don’t?” I challenged him daringly. He gave a soft chuckle, but backed up.
“Levimus.” Snape said firmly. When doing spellwork I had only ever relied on technicality to do my spells. Do xyz while doing this motion and your spell worked every time. I never really felt the magic or recognized its existence.
“Go? No. Stay. I can’t live without you Miss. Granger.” I said panicking feeling her try to leave. I clung to her tightly, but she wiggled away knowing my greatest fear was hurting her so I would never keep her in my grasp for long.
She finds herself
She’d found herself lying under a bush in the garden in a valiant attempt at avoiding her lousy excuse of a bunch of relatives when Vernon had stormed outside, ruining her peace to scold her for being a useless lump. It was perfectly fine when Hermione did the same –although she'd never admit it– but her aunt doing it was the last straw.
As much as that bothers her that he could be like her, it comforts her inexplicably to know that maybe, someone her age went through the same struggles, not like Aunt Lorraine, who had settled into adulthood and begun from there.
Outraged, Harry gasps, yanking her hand back from Ernie. "You leave my braids alone! That's an indirect insult to Parvati, you know. Insulting a girl on the dance floor. Real mature, Macmillian."
Cedric Diggory is giving dancing lessons down in Hufflepuff. And he does owe her a favour, doesn’t he? Perhaps this is the time to take advantage of that.
Not thinking straight, she walks towards the dancing pairs, finding herself whisked into their waltz. She starts with a Durmstrang boy she doesn't know before she ends up dancing with Ernie Macmillian.
“What kind of ballroom dancer is the one who can’t lead and follow? I’ll figure something out with the rest of the girls, Gem. Don’t you worry your pretty little head about it,” Parkinson says finally, then the remainder of their conversation slips out of earshot.
"Aren't you scared?"
Then Professor McGonagall informs her that the champions start the opening dance. Oh boy! Fred has no idea how to dance either, so she figures that both of them can just wobble awkwardly on the dance floor for a bit. It's only fun embarrassing yourself when someone else is embarrassing themselves with you.
"People have died before, you know," Pansy chimes in unhelpfully. "It happens."
"If you can make yourself look more like a woman, can you find a way to not have my voice break? The other boys in my year already have theirs starting to deepen and I don't want that. It terrifies me," Harry went on, embarrassed. "I really don't want it."
And yes, he is good-looking. Sure. Everyone with eyes knows that. But along with his piercing grey eyes, he has strikingly long pale eyelashes; a jawline that even women would kill for, lips that are never chapped, always pink without lip balm. His hair is silky like a girl's, the smooth texture evident even in its short length.
She finds out that by writing whatever she wants to say to Gemini in a book, it alleviates whatever horrible sickness that she has. If you could consider missing someone a sickness. But there is homesickness, so Harry presumes this must be the person equivalent.
Well, Harry knew what was coming, but she didn’t expect this conversation. She’s feeling an awful lot like a mum. If only Malfoy had someone like Aunt Lorraine to help figure himself out, she thinks. “Like with pronouns. Ask your friends to refer to you by feminine pronouns. That makes me feel better after being misgendered all day.”
When Hermione descends from the stairs, it's like in slow motion. Krum, startled by her beauty, comes up to take her hand and kisses it. (He'd better be the perfect date or Harry will hand his ass to him the next challenge!)
She hurriedly ties up her hair into a ponytail, planting herself closer to Milicent. "Sorry Millie, could you repeat that?"
Tucked under Malfoy's arm, she notices immediately that its spine has cracked. It wasn't like that before. She gives it a once over to make sure nothing else has been damaged. "You must have read it thoroughly."
It's freezing out here. She pulls the cardigan closer to herself, gesturing to Malfoy. "We should go back to the castle. You can show me how you look in the clothes you have."
All her belongings have been packed into the trunk already. Her bed is neatly made, which is an anomaly in itself. Hopefully, the girls' dorm will be neater than the boys', she thinks. She quickly swallows the pills with a gulp of water, getting up. She ought to see where her new bed will look like.
They break apart from the hug, still close as ever. Harry kisses her softly, a taste of salty tears stinging each other. "You said I could get another kiss when I made it out of that maze," she says warmly.
"Admittedly so," Gemini replies with a small grin. It does feel odd to see her not sneering at Harry. The expression is so genuine that Harry finds herself struck by dumbfoundedness once again, it's ridiculous.
"Is that so?" she replies, voice a little wet. "Well, I'm transgender too, I suppose. I think. Didn't know it was a thing until like five seconds ago." Lorraine chuckles at that.
She wouldn't quite know what to do if a magical structure would reject her, but with each step she takes, she feels like she's taken a spoonful of sweet, syrupy approval right in her mouth. She saunters to catch up after Hermione and smiles all the way up the staircase.
After the dance, Harry finds herself sitting at the side with Ron. Fred has set off to conduct some prank. He tells her he's planning to spike the punch with a concoction that will turn your skin green. She doesn't mind too much, because she doesn't truly enjoy dancing anyway. Too many eyes.
She'd thought crushing badly on someone would mean that she would know exactly why. But this thing she has for Gemini… she can't explain it. It just
"And I thought I was the one who needed to be brought back to earth," Harry says critically. "
As she doesn’t pay attention to her surroundings, she collides into someone. When she looks up, her eyes meet Malfoy’s, his striking grey eyes a feature of his that she’s come to associate with cruel, childish taunts. She’s too flustered to say anything. The bag he was holding slips out of his hands and its contents spill out onto the floor.
It will stay there, and it burns so brightly she fears it'll scald her. It may develop into something more, even.
In the morning, she had gone to Professor McGonagall’s office, telling her about her request to be transferred to the girls' dorms. The older woman had also said that the professors would be referring to her as Miss Potter from now on. Harry definitely would welcome the change, but now everyone would know. Even more, eyes would be brought upon her. Funnily enough, this time, it would be of her own volition.
Malfoy sits down next to Harry and it takes all of the self-discipline in her spirit to try and not stare in her direction. They're squeezed close together in this small corner. It's as if her brain is transfigured into a pool of goo. Up this close, she can smell Malfoy's body wash and it smells a lot like cotton candy. It's becoming increasingly difficult for Harry not to drown in it. Leaning over to run a finger down a page of names, Malfoy grows ever closer, impossibly so. She's been casting cosmetic charms whenever she spends time with Harry, so her eyes are thinly lined over with black. It makes her eyes look huge like they're going to pop but not in a bad way. She looks pretty. Well, she's always been pretty. It's only until now that Harry's chosen to acknowledge it.
If she could she would just stay here forever until the world forgot who she was. If only she could do that, she thinks.
She's dutifully kept the book unopened until now, so she cracks it open to take a look. If it's possible she could find herself a nice name. She's pretty certain she hasn't known a single person except for Aunt Lorraine whose name is the way it is because they chose it.
First she squints indignantly at Cho Chang from Ravenclaw. Then Hannah Abbott from Hufflepuff. The list goes on. Hermione has to elbow her in the ribs to keep her from  staring for too long.
,” she says in hushed tones, pointing her wand from one cut to another.
"I could kiss you right now," she says, smiling innocently. Harry feels her insides melt in one fell swoop.
For this task, she chooses to wear a thin long-sleeved swimsuit with board shorts. When she emerges from the water, carrying Fleur's sister and Ron in tow, she's soaked to the bone and her clothes cling onto her skin. Fleur kisses her on the cheek as a thank you, Harry blustering afterwards, then she gets a towel to dry herself.
Aunt Lorraine's face peeks out from the doorway. "Harry, are you awake? I'll bring you down to get a good hearty birthday breakfast. The diner downstairs serves the most delicious pancakes."
The murmuring of their schoolmates gets louder as they wait for more students to enter. Unaware, she tightens her grip on Fred's arm, feeling sweat build up in her palms. "I'll be here with you, Harry. Don't you worry too much," he says comfortingly.
Malfoy's owl is already sitting by the window. Harry hangs up a wind chime from her bed, then walks over to read the note.
Before Aquarius leaves, she smooths his ruffled feathers, leaning forward to give it’s head a kiss. "Take this to Malfoy for me," she whispers, and the owl coos.
They would ask Gem that? It strikes her then that she isn't the only one suffering from schoolmates being idiots about being transgender– Gemini is, too. Had she been so blithely wrapped up in her own upset that she hadn't noticed? A pang of guilt swipes at her conscience.
July 31st dawns. Under the wisp of a cold morning, she curls up in bed, going through her presents idly.
"Fine. Want to play Exploding Snap? Seamus brought it from the common room," Ron says. They crawl onto the floor to play several rounds. It's so exciting that she nearly forgets to try out the cosmetic spells she learnt before she goes to bed.
Her makeup is simple except for a bold red lip colour. Parvati manages to tame her hair into something much less frizzy, using a series of charms that will only last a few hours. Again she's plaited it in low braids, this time with green ribbon. It's a look she's been sporting every challenge since the Triwizard tournament. It would be illogical for it to stop at the ball.
Second year is as eventful as it can be when you’re a walking target for what seemed like the entire wizarding world, trying to escape death at every step. She gets called the heir of Slytherin,  pulls a sword from a hat, murders a basilisk, finds out Lucius Malfoy’s probably in cahoots with Voldemort, and kicks a different skirt under her bed every time Dean Thomas does homework on her bed.
He stands there, one of his arms tucked neatly into his chest. It makes him look smaller. She glances at him, recalling the set of clothing she had seen and tries to imagine him wearing it. He wouldn't look half bad, actually. Does he have nice legs? Okay, so what if he has nice legs, no pair of legs can beat Angelina Johnson’s– and girls' legs are so much more worth looking at in her opinion.
There's an odd habit she develops across the year. Something particularly notable.
Her eyes flutter open. "Gemini?"
He sweeps the clothes into his hands, scrambling to his feet and running in the other direction, complexion turning a ghastly pale. He already looks like a ghost. How is it possible that his alabaster skin can glow lighter?
"Gosh, this is complicated," Malfoy says after a long beat. "Picking a name can be really difficult."
His admirers say otherwise. In Brown's words he is 'devastatingly handsome,' Patil says he is 'the paragon of masculine dashing' and Hermione reluctantly calls him 'easy on the eyes.'
Absently she grabs at a plait, still in perfect shape even after dealing with both the dark lord and three days of unconsciousness. She ought to thank Parvati for that. The end of a ribbon looks like it's been fried.
Harry is going to take a wild guess and say that he's trying to gather the words in his head first. People tend to do that, but she isn't certain she has ever seen
"Gemini Narcissa Malfoy rolls off the tongue rather nicely, don't you think?"
"People calling you an attention whore," she mutters, running a hand through her hair and feeling it resist to succumb. "They'll say whatever they want to say about you. Plenty of nasty things behind your back, or such."
If Harry had a face like Draco's she bet she'd have far less difficulty looking like a girl than Harry did with her own, and Harry envies him for it.
"I'm not dead, Gem. It's okay, you didn't know. There was nothing you could have done." Harry runs a soothing hand up and down Gemini's back.
The two break off into a fit of giggles. Gemini sounds so unrestrained, Harry's heart hurts.
Malfoy arches a perfectly plucked eyebrow, nose buried in her potions textbook. Ever since she's chosen the name Gemini Malfoy she's gone down to a spa for regular treatments every week. The estrogen pills have been making Harry have horrible breakouts across places on her body where she didn't even know acne could fester, but Malfoy's skin has cleared up considerably. It looks incredibly soft and it's starting to drive Harry up the wall a little.
Absently, she thinks,
"Are you sure Goyle can't take you?" Parkinson asks impatiently. She speaks more crudely, Harry notes. It's nothing like the incredibly fake snide voice she normally uses.
There’s an envelope in Gemini’s familiar handwriting. While trying to open it she accidentally cuts herself on a sharp edge. There’s a pair of clip-on rose gold earrings inside which magically stick themselves to any part of her ear. She sticks it on her cartilage before she starts reading.
In her hands lies a beautiful dress. The sleeves are sewn so that they scrunch up at the shoulder. Its print is dotted with white flowers in bloom, material a cool green colour. The other gift had contained a dress too, but it was an off-yellow shade that wasn't particularly flattering. Something like her Aunt Petunia’s. Even while lying in her hand, she can tell the careful needlework on this dress isn't something to scoff at. It's intricately wonderful and for a few moments, Harry is mesmerised by its beauty.
Snot was dribbling down her nose when she saw her. At first, she begins –"Sir…" when her mind finally remembers the stories about children being kidnapped in the streets. She only managed to sneak back a few steps before the older woman reassured her.
"I'm by the teacher's desk," he replies. Unexpectedly, he lacks any hostility in his words.
" They've been standing in darkness for a while, so the bright light makes the two of them flinch.
at a lot of people. Not any random people. She likes to stare at the pretty ones. And although she's well aware that she finds pretty girls rather attractive, this is for different reasons.
"Yes. Okay wow the pressure of naming yourself is lighter now. We could literally call ourselves anything, you realise?" Harry says in a severe tone.
"Gemini?" Harry asks, rubbing at an eye. "I must be dreaming. It's too early for this."
"Can I see you?" Self-consciously Harry folds her arms over her chest, ruffled. Gemini looks her up and down with a nod. "It suits you."
She takes another deep breath to settle herself. The musty smell of books is oddly comforting, yet it can't replace the sweet fragrance of cotton candy.
(Safety, she thinks. Be like the feeling of safety.)
With Gemini she feels like she's dancing on air, tuning herself to her every side-step while subtly leading the next. There's a similar glaze in her eyes that Harry recognises.
Sitting up, Harry quickly throws her blanket over her bruised knees, smiling. “I’ll be over in a bit, Auntie. I need to do something.”
. How?
Thankful for the distraction, Harry smoothes the crumples of her skirt with her fingers. It's unusually soft, so she finds herself toying with it unconsciously. "Harriet Lily Potter. Don't laugh."
"I gave some thought to it."  She smoothes a yellow page to the start of the L section. "I thought about naming myself Lily, after my mother, but I don't know if I should. It doesn't feel right. Then I thought about calling myself after a flower, cause it's a family tradition on my mom's side, but I don't know many flowers."
Instead, she can’t say a word, only managing to croak out, “Are these yours?”
Instead of assuming what she's going to say next and preparing a rebuttal, Gemini's gaze meets hers, waiting for her to elaborate.
She tunes out her dormmates' chatter for a good while until she hears the words 'third challenge' which snaps her out of her reverie.
And yet her face was smaller: a greater deal more delicate, features rounded and softened and feminine. Harry drew back to examine her face. All in the same, but
Harry nods. It's cold out here so she presses her feet together, not to let a gust of wind buffet in between. "You read the book?"
There is silence for roughly ten seconds– she starts counting after the third second– Merlin, this classroom is awfully dark, isn't it? She wishes she could see the expression on his face. All she can do is claw at her hair and she wishes she had grown it out, even if it wouldn't be smooth and silky and straight like Malfoy's just so she'd have something more substantial to tug on.
"We can't be seen together outside," she says, grabbing Harry by the wrist and taking her upstairs.
Harry draws her knees to her chest, looping her arms over them. "None of the names have jumped out at me too."
The bird is the closest to her bed. How did Malfoy owl her so fast? She admires the beautiful owl, stroking its head, delighted when it reciprocates with a purring coo.
Harry imagines Gemini rolling her eyes. "Boys? They'll all just ask me weird questions. Like about my dick, or some other weird thing they can ask for shits and giggles. The rest of the boys which are, well, okay I suppose, already all have dates."
Blinking warmly at the use of the pronoun, Harry finds a smile spreading across her face. She attributes the easy feeling to her good mood. "Of course you may. We're trans sisters!" Then she laughs weirdly, 'cause God that sounds weird when she says it aloud, but it's nice to say it to someone like herself. Oh, it feels good.
Her worry gets the best of her anyway. She mutters a half-hearted excuse to Pansy, dismisses herself, half-running down the stairs. There’s a tent set up nearby. Gemini casts a disillusionment charm and ducks inside. The other participants in the tents look somewhat battered, Madam Pomfrey skirting from one to another. Clearly, Harry isn’t a priority right now, because she’s sitting at the side on a chair.
Harry’s eyebrows furrow, turning around. “Gem?” she asks, hesitant. She peers out from underneath her thick, dark eyelashes framing her big green eyes prettily– like those of a doll’s. They’ve grown much longer, different from what Gemini last remembers. “Is that you?”
Among the crowd, she tries her best to crane her neck out to see Harry with the participants. They’ve been waiting for a good thirty minutes already. Everyone had murmured endlessly when they had seen the dragons. What the hell were the organisers thinking? As much as Gemini hoped that Harry wouldn’t get mauled, the possibility is becoming increasingly more potent as time passes.
This again? Harry groans inwardly. "Are you seriously going to start with this now? This is not the time. If you're wondering, Cedric literally taught me how to dance. We're cool. Besides, I didn't put my name in the Goblet of Fire for crying out loud!"
"Please, Harry. You may be dressing up as a girl now but everyone still knows that--"
She stops in her tracks. Her best friend catches up with her in the next few seconds. She lets Hermione get an eyeful of the frustration etched so deeply into her face, then shoots her a poisonous glare again. She knows she's being childish but she continues with her tirade.
"Everyone in the school knows about us by now. I mean, us, like separately. Ron used to complain about me hanging out with you but now he's seemed to accept that we're similar and we'll just have to get along," Harry mumbles, going off a tangent once she sits down and properly talks to Malfoy.
Spare a little empathy here. She just wanted to go away. It was late at night, and it wasn’t really a surprise when she ended up getting lost.
Although Harry has nothing on but her trunk, she stays for three days. She returns to her uncle's home carrying even more things than she had brought, and along with ladles a realisation that spawns the rebirth of her true identity.
The past few weeks had been a blur. Ever since she had discovered her gender identity, Malfoy became more and more eager to begin a transition. It appeared that she had been struggling with dysphoria all her life, and now that she had finally found an answer to it, she wanted to resolve it right away. They ended up meeting even more frequently as time went by.
"I don't think I like any of these names. Narissa is a perfectly fine name though, and I like it solely because it reminds me of Mother," she sniffs, disdainful.
There's a series of small flat gems flanking Gemini's eyes in pinks and purples, highlighting the flecks in her grey eyes. Probably stuck on by lash glue. Unable to look away, both of their gazes continue to meet, only muscle memory carrying their dance.
She has the half a mind to tell him everything that just happened. But she remembers how she is now, keeping her gender a secret from the rest of the school. She wouldn't feel very nice if anyone outed her. "It's a secret. Sorry, I can't tell you," she says as casually as possible.
"Right. Get to your Weasel. I will be expecting your book," Malfoy says, sounding a lot more like her usual self. "See to it, Potter."
"Harry!" Hermione's harried voice travels around the corner, growing closer. Harry keeps up  her fast pace, even going as far as increasing it a little. A few students move out of her way, evidently intimidated. "I don't agree with what Ron said, but you can't go barreling off every time someone does something wrong!"
At first, Gemini starts with protests, but her tone evens out at the end. "For the last time, Pans, I'm not going to the ball with him. Or any boy, for that matter. It's alright."
"And I'm not laughing. It's a perfectly good name, Potter." To her disbelief, Malfoy is, out of the blue, dead serious, grey gaze strong in its intensity. Harry has to hide the flush down her neck with a hand.
"Well he must have broken into the wrong dorm because he found Ron instead," Harry huffs indignantly. "Have you seen him? He's been twisting the tale in like, ten different directions!"
Ron is sitting on the couch when they come in. Harry has her hair tied with her favourite pink scrunchie. It's been getting long enough to tie these days and hovers over her collarbones.
Hm. It's not a very inspirational revelation, and it sort of disappoints her that unconsciously, she feels this way. Her self-esteem isn't that fucked up, surely? But she can live with it.
"Harry."
The rest of the girls are dressed up wonderfully, of course; all their dates are lucky to have them, she thinks. She requires extra assistance to pull up the zipper on her dress and she finds herself feeling very thankful she's in the girls' dorm.
"Long time no talk," she says in what she hopes is in a friendly manner. "How have you been, Ernie?"
Harry stares bitterly at her atrociously bad cuticles and doesn't utter a word. She bites at them whenever she feels anxious, and it so happens that she is perpetually nervous.
"Right," Malfoy mutters. "You can take pills to prevent your voice from breaking. A muggle invention, I presume? Didn't know they had these kinds of things. Or anything much at all."
"That's right." She leans against the door frame, glancing nervously at Harry, as if she was waiting for her to go on, waiting for something crude or judgmental to slip out.
Finally, when the time for the Yule Ball rolls around, they're all ready, starting to pour out of the common room. Fred's already standing by the fireplace. He smiles at the sight of Harry and offers his arm in an exaggerated gentlemanly way. "Milady," he quips, austere. Both of them giggle.
"Is there something wrong?" asks Hermione, voice bouncing off the walls.
In what appears to be the worst form of emotional constipation, Gemini clutches her skirt tightly. "Don't end up dead or fatally injured, okay?"
Harry didn't know that Gemini was like this, behind a cold, hardy exterior. She has a sense of humour. Her jokes are never biting and make you laugh. She likes to do her friends' makeup. She's never felt this weird happy feeling with someone else before and it sort of fucks with her head.
“Eh? Okay,” she says, sitting on a desk to make herself feel more comfortable. “Malfoy is a horrible, nasty git. I wish she wasn’t such an annoying bastard. Honestly, she drives me mad.”
"No, you're not dreaming, Harry! I swear to Merlin, I don't remember you being this stupid," the taller girl mumbles, pinching the bridge of her nose, exasperated. She's already in her uniform, but her tie isn't on.
Unlike Malfoy, they would never get to know how she truly was, under all those speculations, that she never truly enjoyed it. Despised it, even. They would take that assumption, run away with it, and Harry could do absolutely nothing but let them run their mouth.
The girls' tower is only a small walk away, facing adjacent. She lets Hermione go first. The first step of the staircase, is, well… staring at her, waiting for her to start moving. Suddenly Harry feels her throat run dry. Sure. She's a girl, but biologically, she's a boy. What if Hogwarts doesn't recognise that? A looming fear swallows her train of thought.
Gemini, flustered, brushes a strand of blond hair off her forehead. She stoops down to tuck her trunk under the bed. "I didn't ever apologise for the things I did. I shouldn't have taken you for granted. I'm sorry."
Harry's gaze drifts to the floor, then to Gemini. Technically it should be impossible for her to see Gemini, but she does it anyway. “I’m glad you’re here. I…” She licks her pink lips, distracted, as if there’s a whole bunch of things she wants to say, but yet no other words come out.
It’s only after Quidditch practise that she realises she's left her favourite pink scrunchie behind in the changing room. It’s no big deal, and honestly, it’s a bit of a pain to run back there to get it. She could pick it up during the next match, but if the rest of her teammates see it –they’re all boys, mind you– she doesn’t have the heart to bluster out a half-hearted lie.
Harry is prepared for this, so she pulls the letter from her pocket, passing it to Malfoy. The girl reads through the letter quickly. "I'm afraid my mother won't have an answer for that. She told me that since Malfoys always have sons as firstborns, she didn't think of any other names, really. There's not a lot of constellations in the sky, you know. So she just picked a name she liked from the beginning and stuck to it."
Lorraine was hesitant. Harry could tell. She lived in the middle of the town square, flat cosy and tucked into a corner. It wasn’t a bad place. Between inquiries regarding her presence in the city, she answers an important question that sets off the catalyst for change.
"What the hell," he sputters. He didn't anticipate this. "I'm not a crossdresser, you daft Gryffindor! Also, what is a transgender, anyway?"
"Hell yeah, I am!" Harry exclaims, pumping a fist in the air.
She recalls meeting Voldemort, yet her memories of that night are faded, feeling more like a horrible nightmare. She draws the curtains around her bed quickly. In the bed next to hers, Cedric is sitting up, eating some porridge.
"Potter, I'm pretty sure the whole school is talking about how Sirius Black has broken into your dorm trying to finish what he's started and the first thing you start talking about is
Her voice doesn't end up breaking at all. She accidentally charms a bicycle to fly her  all the way to Hogwarts one day in advance, shivering violently throughout the entire trip. It's the only way not to be caught by muggles.
Harry snorts. "Yes, I'll be sure to do that, but there's no guarantee. You know I have a bounty on my head."
"So, you're transgender. Your body doesn't match how you actually are so you took hormones that are in pills so you could develop feminine characteristics," Harry says slowly.
"It's from Malfoy Manor’s library. The books in it are all specially charmed so I can summon them at my convenience," Malfoy says. "Charmed, Potter? You're too easily impressed." Although her words are far from sweet, they hold no bite.
"For your information," she drawls, posture straight but with her shoulders waning. "I stayed up all night trying to figure out heads or tails of my situation. And then it occurred to me that, hey, Potter goes through these things as well, should I consult her?"
"Huh? Harry," Hermione hisses, grabbing at her shoulder. "Don't grab them so openly! Some boys are looking in this direction!"
Some boys are looking in her direction. She doesn't have the grace to blush, so she just crosses her arms, feeling very satisfied. The afternoon the day prior comes back to her and she decides the word she learnt would be perfect to use now. "I'm gratified!" she cries.
Harry bests the Hungarian Horntail with a broom. A
Although Gemini wants to know what Harry wants to say, she doesn't pressure her to say it aloud. "If it helps, I miss you loads. Don't smile! I'll say it once, I won't say it again."
"I don't mind taking you as my date, Gem. Show the boys what they're missing. We can spice up your makeup a bit. All the other girls would be wearing blue or green eyeshadow, anyways. Then you'll come in, like a snake invading a pack of mice! Alright, that sounded better when I didn't say it aloud."
"A secret?" Ron wrinkles his nose, the freckles scattered on his face crinkling together. "You and that ferret aren't friends now, are you?"
"It's been a long time coming," Hermione says earnestly when Lavender asks her how she feels.
"Are you a crossdresser?" she asks bluntly. "Or are you a transgender girl?"
"You're going to have to try harder than that, Potter," she grumbles. "Oh." Her gaze flickers over Harry's outfit, then to her lips, probably noticing the cosmetics. "You look different."
Then, the next victim to her ceaseless staring is… Malfoy. In this period when all she does is eyeball the Slytherin she realises something:
Madam Pince's gaze follows her as she hurriedly slips into the corner. She places a hand on a bookshelf, another on her knees as she pants from the sprint she used to get here.
Snow falls outside in heaps, sleets of fine white trickling from the sky. Professor McGonagall had transfigured their common room carpet to a tiny Christmas tree. Their presents had been owl delivered at night.
"How was I supposed to tell you? If you had any semblance of common sense you'd know, idiot," she mumbles. She hears Gemini sharply take a breath, then the tell-tale patter of her heeled shoes clacking out of the room follows.
"--Malfoys don't have friends. Yeah I know, you told me this once. Even still, do I not count?" Gemini blinks at her. What? Harry knows she’s soaking up their conversations like a sponge, and what about it?
Like a stunned goldfish, all Harry could do was to gape dumbly at him, the boy in front of her uncharacteristically silent. A whole bunch of retorts begin formulating in her head. ‘Are you a sissy, Malfoy?’ or a damning ‘Crossdresser much?’  Maybe even a ‘Did you steal this from a girl, you pervert?’
"Three days or so," he tells her. He glances over pointedly at Gemini, clearly curious. "She's been coming in and out since you got here. Sometimes she just lies there and cries until she falls asleep."
It's fun. Since they're much closer to the heart of the city they drop by a humongous shopping mall. There's a department store that stretches three entire floors. As a congratulatory gift for starting estrogen, Aunt Lorraine helps Harry pick out five training bras, all in pretty lacy shades. Her personal favourite is the red one-- Aunt Lorraine says that such a colour would complement her brown skin.
“Like how?”
Somehow, even after the sheer ridiculousness of the first and second challenge, she still finds herself shaking her head. Yet she can't stifle the cumbersome worries she brings with her to every affair, knowing just a fraction of the danger Harry will have to endure. "Do they want to kill the champions that badly?"
Immediately she swoops down to help pick up the items that had taken a tumble. Although he was being a pain in the ass, as usual, she was still in the wrong and ought to right it first before spitting out any insults. It was a piece of advice Professor McGonagall had given her the last time she had a run-in with Malfoy.
She explains her situation to Professor McGonagall (that’s why she came early). Her Head of House gladly accommodates her, but she promises to not out Harry when she isn't ready. It is a recent discovery, after all, some more time would be necessary for her to become mentally prepared. Thinking about coming out to the entire school population makes her eye twitch oddly. She doesn't think she can stomach any schoolmates approaching her and asking all kinds of nosy questions. Or any questions, for that matter.
"Cedric! I thought you died," she says, feeling tears drip down her cheeks. "I'm glad you're here."
So her parents are alright with her being transgender and supporting Tom Riddle? Huh. Go figure. Blood purity must be like LGBT+ rights in the wizarding world. (That is very unlikely but it makes better sense when she says it in her head.)
"How did you do that?" asks Harry, peering at it. It's full of words he's never seen in his life. Probably some kind of history book for names. The names aren't even sorted by alphabet. Some look like they'd sound rather queer when read aloud.
"Not friends, no way," she replies quickly. "It's just that I happen to know something about them that I can't tell you. I promise if this changes I'll tell you at once. It's kind of burning at me inside as well."
She tries, to the best of her ability, to imagine him in the same shoes as her. And it's difficult because prior to this all she's done is hate his guts. Maybe he too tried on his mother's heels and strutted through the house with the loveliest, most exhilarating feeling; maybe he tried to grow out his hair while ignoring his relatives' adamant protests like Harry has.
Harry turns away to the fire. "I've always cared. Why do you think I was so angry every time you made fun of me? If I didn't give a fuck I wouldn't retaliate."
The doors to the ballroom open with a creak. Students, having parted for them like the red sea, applaud as they enter pair by pair. Faux snow drizzles from the ceiling, painting the image of the Yule Ball of an unforgettable wintry white.
Gingerly, Gemini reaches out to take it, looping it around her neck, fingering the charm in the middle. "This really works?" Then she is quiet, astonished by the light sound that comes out of her mouth. Her gaze flickers to Harry's eyes; her lips, her scar both all at once and one at a time.
In the middle of Hagrid's lesson, she receives a message – thrust into her hand by another student whose name she does not know. It's a note carried between the folds of a silken handkerchief, embroidered with the initials D.M. She nearly lets out a snort when she sees it. Trust Malfoy to have his own embroidered handkerchief.
Harry's eyes nearly pop out of their sockets. "What?" She can't fathom giving anything to that newspaper willingly, knowing how they twist and turn things. "Why would you do that?"
"What? Weren't you Uncle Bentley? Bentley Evans?" echoed Harry, puzzled.
She manages to clean her tears away just in time to go down for breakfast without looking like a wreck. She doesn’t feel too terrible yet. The terrible feeling will come later, probably, and in full force. But she needs to celebrate her first good birthday, so she puts on her favourite dress and goes out the door. It slams shut with a bang from the unnecessary strength.
"I said I wanted to kiss you once, right?" Damn. Gemini can feel herself blush too. She does that too easily. If she had foundation on, it would have been hidden for sure. "If you live you'll get another kiss." Then she stomps away, leaving Harry floored.
She must have changed her body wash because now she smells like meringue. Harry becomes acutely aware of the sweat trickling down her nape and wipes it away with the back of her hand.
"We’ll be dancing the waltz, right? I heard. I’ve learnt how to lead when I was younger, but leading is one of those random matters that make me feel rather dysphoric. Unfortunate, really..”
There are so many things out there to get her. Even in the infirmary, she knows she's not entirely safe.
As promised, her and Fred don't sway as well as the others during the opening dance, but they go through it with wide grins on their face. At first, Harry is nervous, stumbling over a heel. Fred squeezes her arm slightly to reassure her, and they try their best to pretend to know what they're doing. It's fun.
Like when Gemini discovered she was a girl. Just like that.
"What did your aunt say, Potter?" she asks with poorly veiled enthusiasm. "Regarding names, I mean."
Her new roommates take to her kindly. Thankfully, they decide to leave their bombardment of questions for the day after. To say that her best friend is delighted that Harry is joining them is an understatement. That's partially why Harry is so happy to join them.
"Always a firstborn son, eh? Looks like you'll be the exception," quips Harry. Malfoy looks very pleased by this statement, looking an awful lot like a cat that has got the cream.  Joking with Malfoy is something she's never imagined before because of the sheer absurdity of it all. Even after weeks of meeting up it still feels like a fever dream.
Since Malfoy had insisted that they shouldn't be spotted in public together, they had taken residence in the library whenever they met. Something to do with a death eater father, Harry guessed. If she met up with Malfoy in private she could escape any of Ron's or Hermione's prying questions, so she didn't complain.
Two girls, a blonde and a black-haired one stroll through. It's Gemini and Pansy Parkinson– Gemini had said they were good friends, after all. Even though they were a good distance away, Harry could hear their chatter through the reverberations bouncing from wall to wall.
"That's it? You come all the way here for that," Harry muses. She sees Gemini's ears start to grow pink. "Thanks, I guess."
After seven years, something looked very different. Bentley looked… well, in the most eloquent terms, more of a woman, although she remained tall.  Harry didn’t know people could do that! Bentley was definitely non-magical. No glamours at all!
Her aunt softens immediately, moving in to hug her. She tucks the girl's head into her shoulder and Harry takes in a shuddery breath. She hasn't had a hug like this in years.
Among the students, she tries to spot a head of silver blond hair, seeing none. It feels like it's been hours before she sees Gemini.
"Let me do your makeup. You look so pretty, I can't help not to," she says, cheeks promptly tinted by a pretty pink that is stark on her pale skin. Harry feels her face warm as well.
"I didn't even give you your present." Harry reaches into her coat to take out a necklace with a pink charm hanging off its reins. It digs into her palm when she holds it tight. "I hope you'll like it... it's a portable voice modification charm, to make it more feminine. I know your voice already started breaking. I hope it helps."
"Harry," the alto voice intoned, name practised and familiar on her tongue. "I go by Miss, now."
Today is a good day. Since it's Hogsmeade Saturday, the school grounds are nearly barren. So Harry sleeps in, waiting for everyone to leave, knowing they won't be back for a few hours.
This time, however, she won't receive a reply.
"Don't follow me, 'Mione. If Ron cared so much he'd be the one following after me," she mumbles, quickly walking away so Hermione can't get a word in.
"Hello? Earth to Potter," says a disgruntled Malfoy, expression resembling a kettle that is due to overboil. He takes in a sharp intake of breath.
"Your face looks more feminine, now. Thank Merlin for hormones." She feels her ego purr at that.
"Hermione is Krum's date, so we need to wait outside by the door for everyone else to go in first. It's for the champions' entrance," she tells him as they saunter down the hall.
A tilting laugh echoes down the hall. She recognises it instantly. There's a mad scramble to get herself out of sight, pressing herself behind a corner.
The owl comes back a few minutes later, holding a scented candle in its beak. A housewarming gift.
"What? What does that git want?"
"No, I didn't, Harry. I'm listening to your rambles regardless, so they aren't pointless," she drawls. Her name sounds so lovely on Malfoy's lips, that tinge of familiarity making her swell up like a hot air balloon. She wants to hear Malfoy say it again.
"Then we can find clothes that fit on you." Harry sweeps an eye over the skirt, glancing away quickly when she realises she's been looking for far too long than is normal. "If it makes you feel any better, that skirt makes your legs look fantastic, Malfoy."
"Since when was the girl who lived bothered? You'll live," she says.
Practised from the numerous times she had explained it patiently to her friends, she says, "Being transgender means that your physical body and your gender don't align. Some people take steps to change their appearance to suit what they truly are. Like me." She sucks in a breath in a moment of vulnerability. "I still have like, a dick, but I'm still a girl. You got that?"
"What?" she blurts out. "Where?"
. At least she manages to get in a playing field that is comfortable to her. As she zips up and down, her plaits go flying in the air. The ribbons in her braids are a bright Gryffindor red, prominent against the white sky. She disappears for a while, returning with a golden egg cradled in her arms and numerous cuts dotting her arms and face. There’s a sort of half-reluctant cheer, especially from the Hufflepuffs. Gemini grits her teeth but doesn’t open her mouth.
"That owl was for you? It's a real beauty, Harry. Why do you have someone owling you so late?"
"Harry Potter I have not seen you in years but I promise you I will help you with this," Lorraine says quickly. "I'll bring you to my doctor and we can get some hormone blockers for you, okay? It helps stop puberty– oh, don't cry, sweetheart! Us girls need to help each other."
"Oh," she hears herself say in a tiny voice. Is Gemini an angel who has descended to earth, or something? Merlin's saggy tits, what the hell?
The elegant script was written in a hurry. For a moment Harry thought about whether she should stand him up. She had nothing to gain from this meeting, after all. She almost ends up rejecting, but she is reminded of her burning questions from yesterday, so she heads down to the classroom after having a heaping portion of pasta and her usual dosage of hormone blockers.
"I look really pretty," says Harry, admiring her reflection. She doesn't even know she could look this nice. For once her hair texture works in her favour, the ends curling up neatly under her ears.
Earlier on in the week, Malfoy had told her what her impression of Harry was. She thought that she was an attention seeker who loved fame. And Malfoy wanted to be praised too, so she disliked Harry. How many other people out there also felt the same way?
He continues looking at her incredulously like she’s grown a second head. “Well, Potter? On with it! Use the darned things.”
Gemini lets her peer into the mirror. The cosmetics are expertly applied, softening all the harsher edges of her face. A deeper red colour starts from the middle of her lips, fading out, making her lips look like they're bitten. She tilts Harry's chin to face her, taking an approving glance.
"I don't fit this at all," Malfoy says, readjusting the skirt for the nth time. The hair growing charm only reaches her shoulders until it becomes so dangerously thin Harry fears her hair will snap. For the first time, she realises how silky smooth hair can have its disadvantages.
"Ron will get worried. I've been out here too long," she says. Malfoy steps out first into the quiet hallway. Harry shuts the door behind them. "I have a book that my Aunt Lorriane gave for these kinds of things. I'll owl you later."
"Not helping, Pans." She slumps against the wall like a rag doll, confronted by the possibility that Harry could get a horrible injury and die while still distancing herself from Gemini. They still had so much to learn about each other. Great! Fantastic! Life is terrible as always.
Gemini, affronted, clutches her chest oddly, feeling a strange warm banking feeling there stutter so jerkily she fears everyone in her vicinity might feel it as well.
That is, until Gemini. Again.
On the foot of the bed, Harry perches, keeping her eyes shut the entire time. She can feel every touch of Gemini's fingers going dusting her face. The blond girl's warm breath brushes across her face and Harry tries her best not to fidget.
She lifts an eyebrow. "Spit it out already."
The dungeons are even colder than the rest of the castle. Her dress is thin, so she barely suppresses a shiver. Besides themselves, the Slytherin dorms are barren. Gemini places her trunk onto the bed as Harry looks around, taken in by the place. It's oddly intimate when they're in here alone.
“There’s a word for that?” His confused voice cuts through, so startling that she has to stare. It’s as if he’s completely forgotten who he is talking to. “I didn’t know. How do I make these uncomfortable feelings go away?”
Harry frowns. "Won't you be in trouble for meeting me here? You're not supposed to be here?"
Caught off-guard, Gemini frowns even more deeply, forming unpleasant lines on her face. "I just wanted to wish you good luck with your next challenge. That's all."
"Likely story, Harriet." The arm on her back tightens uncomfortably so. "Even if you got selected unwillingly, you should have backed off and helped Cedric in taking the lead. He's one of the few people who win Hufflepuff respect among you lot. You should have let him succeed. But you steal his thunder in newspaper articles, ace every challenge, stupid ribbon braids and all. Looks like pigs' tails, honestly. Makes me want to pull them out."
Then she remembers. "Gem, you're not supposed to be here. What if your parents find out?"
Harry ends up securing a date in Fred, probably a new second most favourite person in the world. He's a ball of fun when he wants to be and it's simply very likeable. Since she has a date and a dress, she thinks she's set for the ball.
“Well, Malfoy, instead of trying to ignore these feelings for the rest of your life, people usually do things so that they align with how they feel like, to feel more comfortable in their skin,” she says evenly, trying her best not to slip into sarcasm. For the first time in forever, she’s trying to be mature with him, an impossibility in itself, because he makes all of her logic go barrelling out of the window whenever they start bickering.
She writes to Dumbledore about breaking the statute of secrecy to tell her aunt about magic. Since she's technically a sort of guardian, he agrees. Aunt Lorraine suggests using magic to clean up the whole place but when Harry says she can't she just takes it upon herself to clean the whole flat.
More tears pour out and mix with her running snot. After five minutes of rubbing feebly at her sore eyes, she sighs, rolling herself back out into an inelegant sprawl across her bed again. Gemini could do whatever she wanted. Whatever. They hated each other in the past. Maybe they could do it again, she thinks. Even if it meant ignoring an entire companionship they had formed in the process.
For a while, Harry wonders why they hadn't placed her with Aunt Lorraine since birth instead of the Dursleys. She counts the years back with her fingers. Then she realises that Lorraine would have been nineteen years old and homeless. Far too young or in the right circumstances to raise a child. Harry ends up feeling saddened.
Draco Malfoy is pretty.
"Have you seen Malfoy? I'd reckon she doesn't make too bad of a girl," he says to her absent-mindedly, scratching at his tie.
Gemini is sleeping next to her bed, leaning over from a chair pushed right up to it, her face a quiet bliss. Her lips are slightly parted, breathing shallow; her pale skin doesn't have a trace of makeup like she normally wears. Even though Harry has just woken up, she can still admire Gemini like this. She runs her fingers through the taller girl's hair. Gemini sighs in her sleep and wiggles closer.
Hm. Right now she's just glad she's alive. It seems like Gemini had been sleeping for a long time, so Harry gently rubs her shoulder to stir her. "Gem. Gemini. Wake up."
Malfoy would be meeting her by the Herbology greenhouse. In an impetuous display of giddy happiness, she skips all the way there. She spots a glimpse of silvery blond hair by the trees. The other girl hadn't noticed her yet. Maybe Harry could surprise her?
Suddenly everything slips into place. The uncomfortable wash of wrongness that comes with being called a boy makes sense now. It's been like this for years. She tries her best not to let her emotions overwhelm her expression.
By herself, she sits in her common room. Later that day she ends up buying her own ad in The Prophet. Although hers is on the second page and Gemini is on the cover, hers garners just as much buzz.
Meanwhile, Harry has a hardier cut off the jaw no amount of contour can hide, bushy eyebrows that don't flatter her unruly hair. Eyeliner won't save her, even.
Harry's dancing with the loveliest girl in the whole world like it's second nature to them. Learning how to lead just so she could dance with Gemini. Everything feels slick over with a mesmerising, dreamlike haze; she wants to submerge herself in it. The world falls away with scary ease and she revels in what is left behind.
“Uncle?”
Like she said, an eventful year. Third year acquiesced just as quickly.
Dark spots dance across her vision. She groans, burying herself further into the soft surface beneath her. Everything hurts so badly. It's like all of her senses had been cranked up to the highest sensitivity. The sterile smell that lingers in the air makes her head throb. Ugh.
"In all honesty, I don't mind the name Harry. It doesn't make me feel dysphoric or anything, so I figured Harriet would be fine. People can go on calling me Harry but when they see my proper name they'll know I'm a girl. Also, James was my middle name, my dad's name, so it'll only make sense that it'll be Lily for my mom's instead had I been born a daughter? Wait. I'm rambling, aren't I?" Harry trails off, deflating, then flushes again. She shoots a glance at Malfoy. "Did you tell your friends you were trans before you moved?"
Amid the swirl of dancing bodies, Gemini blooms like a rose among thorns. Plenty of girls are wearing gowns in brighter colours, but she is clothed in pure white. The halter top neckline shows off the necklace with a voice modification charm that Harry had given her. As everyone else spins, she follows, blond hair fluttering like a shawl behind her.
And her unwilling participation in the Triwizard Tournament would worsen it. There would be what? Two other schools joining? How many more people would conduct their own critical cross-examinations about the girl who lived?
"You're awake! Oh no please don't cry… do you want me to get Madam Pomfrey for you? You must be starving," he replies kindly. Harry feels the onset of even more tears come. Cedric is so nice, what the hell. She's going to start bawling.
She had given a piece of information about herself to her worst enemy. And now Malfoy is peering imploringly at Harry with the widest look in her eyes as if she'd discovered the meaning of life.
"Have you chosen a name for yourself yet?" asks Malfoy, much more softly than before. "You can take a while to mull over these things. It's a big deal."
"Merry Christmas, Harry!" she exclaims, laughter tinkling like bells.
Harry shakes her head, not prepared to tell the whole truth. "I don't know how the magical world feels about people like us. I'm taking pills to prevent my voice from breaking, but it's not like I'm sprouting boobs or anything. I'll deal with it one day. Just not today. Ron and Hermione know, of course. And Professor McGonagall. That's all."
Harry digs through her messy pile of things for the book, shrinks it for good measure so it won't be too difficult to carry, flips the parchment over to the blank side and scribbles out a reply. By the time she finishes, Ron is sitting on the foot of her bed, watching her curiously.
Harry hides a laugh behind her hand. How had she known?
Even after she had given the memo to Snape and went back to the common room, she ended up thinking again. She imagines herself on an empty ballroom floor, Gemini’s arm around her waist, the two of them drifting back and forth, faces unreadable due to a cloud of haziness.
The day before the last of the Triwizard tournament, Gemini decides it isn't worth it to listen to any more listless chatter about the stupid competition. She only ever paid attention to any of the speculations because of Harry.
Among the items, there is a girl’s blouse and a red skirt fashioned out of a vibrant-coloured velvet. Even while sprawled out on the dirty floor, the beauty of the garments is unmistakable. How on earth had these clothes ended up in his bag? What would he need these for?
Oh. She smells like oranges. How much different body wash can a girl have?
A cold gust of air hits her face when she enters the dungeons. This part of the castle is indeed far colder than the rest, so she shrinks as much into herself as she can, hiding under her red scarf.
Her voice breaks off at the end. Harry cringes at the sound, curling her arms around her middle.
She steals Ron and Hermione from the Great Hall once they arrive. For the last few hours, all she could do was make up a plan on how to tell them, coming up with possible answers to any of their questions. They understand as much as a bunch of twelve-year-olds can. Harry doesn’t understand it much herself, but she’s still the same person, she’s still Harry.
Harry walks towards the doors to leave, Malfoy behind her. It's so weird. She's probably never had a civilised conversation with the Slytherin up until this point. But even if Malfoy is just like her, she is still a person who called Hermione those horrible names. Plus she has a Death Eater father who wants Harry's head on a plate. Yet she can't feel any semblance of hate or dislike in knowing that Malfoy found the truth behind her dysphoria tonight. It's disassociating, almost.
Confused, she brings a hand up to her eyes and pulls it back to see it wet. “Oh. I’m crying,” she mumbles to herself, crumpling the letter up in her hand. Damn. She’s going to do this now? Today? Wasn’t a Malfoy supposed to be rude and stuck-up? Why was Gemini thinking so lowly of herself?
And that's when she realises she's been looking at all these people. They have a femininity she doesn't possess, but wants to have so badly. What she wants to fit in. Whatever she thinks she would need to have in order to be called a proper woman. It strikes her in the middle of class, when she's staring at the back of Malfoy's head, admiring his lithe shoulders.
“Hermione, don’t move,” Parvati instructs, eyeliner in one hand, hovering over her best friend’s face.
"Socks? What kind of name is that?" Malfoy snorts but seems interested regardless.
“Watch where you’re going, Potter!” Malfoy bites out, irritated as he dusts the non-existent lint off his pants.
Harry is stunned. The Slytherin guides her away, gliding her into another crowd and away from Macmillian before she can catch a second to breathe.
A trickle of students is coming in through the front entrance of Hogwarts, returning from the holiday. Harry is dressed in the green dress, a black wool coat thrown over it all, hair plaited delicately to make a half-up half-down hairstyle courtesy of Professor McGonagall. She feels a few unabashed eyes falling upon her, but they quickly turn away.
This is the place she finds her feeling of safety tangled with. This is where Gemini would meet her, out of the view of everyone else.
Immediately a pair of lithe arms are thrown over her, pulling her into a tight, crushing hug. Harry returns the hug with just as much intensity, burying her face into Gemini's shoulder and taking a deep hiss of breath. Gemini seems to deflate underneath her, but her hold is still unyielding.
The cover is dusty, hardcover beginning to rot into a dull brown colour. It takes a bit of a strength to open it as all the pages are stuck together. It furls open to reveal an assortment of names in severe fonts.
Gemini's hand retracts, slowly retreating out of her space as if she's been burnt. "How was I supposed to know?" It's as if she has more nasty things to say, but she holds her tongue.
"What? Really?" replies Harry in a relieved sort of voice. "Merlin, I miss you too."
"He told me that he's non-binary and he chose the name for himself, actually."
"It's the most effective means of communication," she says like it's nothing. "Anyone in the wizarding world who can read will read it, trust me. Everyone always wants to know what's going on in the pureblood families. I'd want to bring the news myself rather than some other nasty schoolmate." She stares at Harry like she's looking for approval. When did start she doing that?
It's only when she returns to her dorm she dares to rest a fist upon her chest to check her heartbeat. It's still going at an erratic pace as if it's trying to associate this feeling with Gemini forever.
She lays out her dress robes. It's a lovely shimmering thing in a muted coral hue, sleeveless, clinching at the waist with a wide skirt. The translucent overlays of the skirt make the skirt appear even wider. She's certain it'll be out of place among the rest of the dress robes with its iconic 50s look.
Immediately her training from Cedric kicks in. She can hear his recitation from the guidebook repeating smoothly in her head. Harry lifts her arms, positioning them to Gemini as an offer to lead, her grey eyes twinkling with surprise.
Curling a hand into a tight, white-knuckled fist, he mutters under his breath, "You tell anyone about what I had in my bag and I'll hex you."
"My friend? I suppose you are," she says, some emotion thick in its bloom that Harry doesn't recognise. "You're different."
She ends up not going to the owlery at all. These days she sneaks down to the Prefects' Bathroom because communal showers are a nightmare. It's nice to be by herself. Upon pulling herself into the dorm, there's a sleek, gorgeous owl sitting by the ledge of the window holding a piece of parchment in its beak.
I tried to ask him, but he ignored me playing with the pocket watch he had taken back from me when our wands were getting weighed. He had been so happy and light hearted today, but holding the horcrux it was like a cloud of darkness came over his already dark eyes. It wasn't just the dark magic that changed him, he seemed to revel in it, absorbing it, high from the power.
“Get the headmaster.” I whispered setting down Granger tenderly on the couch in my rooms next to the fireplace. Potter flooed the headmaster as soon as he got back in the building surprisingly put together for the situation. The moment we were at Hogwarts again all of his anger was gone and I only then realized the drama in front of the Dark Lord was a show.
The impending war brought more anxiety to me than an unintended baby ever could.
"I'm sorry." I told her hating to see her cry. I didn't want her to be hurt. No one should hit their wife like that. She looked back at me with contempt through the tears.
“I suppose he just knows I won’t hurt him.” I said with a shrug. Hagrid hummed thoughtfully but waved me off to my next class.
"Should I get a bezoar?" Potter asked worriedly coming to her side also.
Everyone had their death eater robes on, but the masks were forgotten in the casual atmosphere of the room.
Help.
"Severus, can you at least give us an explanation WHY you killed him?" The judge asked tiredly as if they went through this quite often.
“Of course not. I noticed Ron was left off your list of people to protect. Looks like that ship has sunk, hasn’t it?” He teased mirthfully. I blushed at the insinuation.
"Snape.."
“Oh you found her!” She announced happily as if I was a lost kitten. I sighed but gave a smile.
I drank and felt a warm flush that helped ease my gitters at being seated at a table of death eaters.
His bald scalp was replaced by jet black hair that flowed to his ears perfectly straight. His red eyes had become a light brown that sparkled mysteriously in the most charming of ways. His skin was thick and while still pale, soft and youthful more resembling someone in their twenties than fifties like he was.
"She is in shock it seems. Very peculiar. I don't see any physical damage except to her face, some sort of bruising." She mumbled more to herself than me bustling around running more spells and casting spells on her to help fix her damage from the cold.
“She was due back in about half an hour. Knowing him you have an hour maximum.” Snape explained casually. I could only see the lower half of his face with the mask on and his eyes and it gave nothing away. He didn’t seem to be taking pleasure in watching me suffer, but he didn’t seem to be bothered either.
“Maybe. They are based on existing spells, but he seems to have modified them for his liking. I don’t they you can create new magic rules anymore. You have to work with what’s established putting together smaller spells and enchantments to make different effects.” I explained not sure if I really understood it well.
"Except you." The faith he put in me was astounding. I did so many horrific deeds and dappled in the dark arts constantly. I didn't think doing it, but then trying to bring it down really quantified as not indulging. I got my fix as much as I wanted and maybe more. One of the reasons I wasn't sure I even wanted to survive the war was the withdrawal of not having that dark power at my disposal. Controlling people, punishing them…destroying them. It was a dangerous addiction I didn't know if I could overcome.
I had no say in being here, I might as well enjoy myself.
“I think that’s enough for today.” He said abruptly putting away his wand and rolling his sleeves down as if trying to hide the darkness. He grabbed his glass and refilled it.
"Knew what specifically?" He asked quirking his head trying to read my mind without actually reading it. He never dared to actually go through my thoughts.
“I found some important research I thought you might be interested in for one of your…tasks…you’ve been assigned.” The headmaster said giving me a small smile before turning his attention on a drunk Snape.
“Yesss, very well. You’ve done good. That will work for me. As for your Granger…after much debate, I’ve changed my plans. I want to kill her instead. She’s too powerful to control.” He said uncaringly.
Relax Granger. Nothing will happen without your permission.
"She wasn't a good person, but she was still my mom. One night on summer break when I was fourteen I was pulled into the Headmaster's office and told he killed her with a pan during one of their fights. I had tried to leave to kill him myself, but the headmaster pleaded with me to let the Dark Lord handle it. Allowing him to kill my father would fulfill my initiation requirements and would also leave me blameless so I could be apart of normal society." He confessed darkly, the memory of that night still troubling him. I couldn't imagine being placed in that position at such a young age. My heart went out to him for his loss and getting caught up before he could ever understand what was going on.
"The death eaters had dinner, then I just hung around. I can't really say too much." I said pointedly nodding to the students chattering away not too far from us. Harry raised an eyebrow questioningly.
I tipped her chin up so I could look in her eyes doing just a tad bit of legilimency hating myself for abusing her trust.
Silence followed my words.
I managed to keep my thoughts off of Snape very effectively learning new defense spells, but the moment the class ended I felt my worry for tonight’s lessons coming back.
"I think so."
There was no way. He was dead.
"No." I said opening my own book owing her no explanation for my mood.
I ignored him for the next week unwilling to let myself be at his mercy. I even skipped Potions class which I never did just to avoid him. I would gladly take the failing grade just to have some semblance of control back. I wasn’t Hermione Granger the slut who was obsessed with men. I was Hermione Granger, the book worm who needed to find a way to protect herself so no one could ever put me in the same position as Malfoy had.
The only time I had ever felt anything similar was when the dementors had come on the train. Everyone in the room looked around at each other confused and I realized then that they felt it too.
I said nothing as Snape picked me up in one quick motion and carried me out of the large room. I wanted to stay awake and see what happened next. I wanted to regain the control that had been taken from me. Between the fact I had barely eaten or slept in weeks and the stress from the cruciatis curse though I just snuggled tiredly against Snape chest. He smelled of cedar from his potions and a lingering musky scent that I couldn’t quite place.
“It was my fault. I goaded him. Well worth it though. We just came to a new understanding of our mutually beneficial relationship.” He said casually as if they had just rewritten a contract.
“Want some hot coca dear?” The kind old store owner offered bringing me a cup to help me warm up. It was freezing outside and I was wearing a petticoat and my school skirt since I couldn’t find any outfit that worked nicer. The only thing that gave my legs anything warm was black thigh high stocking I put on. I had spelled them to stay warm, but the charm had worn off about an hour ago.
“Is Misses hungry? Dobby barely sees Misses plate dirty anymore. Your far too thin also. Dobby will feed you, but you have to promise not to free any elves.” Dobby said with a smile grabbing my hand making the decision for me quite happily. He bounced down the hall to the kitchens which wasn’t far from where I had been.
"I'm just saying…that was a bit…hot. The way he looked at you. I swear he would have taken off your clothes if not for us. Your welcome." Harry said with a laugh grabbing a chocolate milk to drink.
“Well I’ll be! He seems to like ya!” Hagrid said excitedly as if he hadn’t almost gotten us all killed.
“Okay. Good. You’ll have to help me pick out something to wear of course. I’m tired of wearing the same uniform everyday.” She said going through her clothes trying to find something that would look good without being slutty.
“You look nervous. Why?” He asked changing the subject.
Please tell me where you are at. I'm sorry.
It could have been ten minutes, or an hour, I wasn’t sure, but when their onslaught finally ended I didn’t even feel relief. My brain was fuzzy and I was having trouble remembering where I was.
“Well, what are you waiting for? Go get her. I’m already annoyed enough Severus, don’t test my patience.” I ground my teeth and closed my eyes for a second, the reality of the decision I was about to make weighing on me. Yet it was also the easiest thing I had to do.
It wasn't signed, but it didn't need to be signed. I wiped away my tears trying to stop them from ruining the small parchment note. It was a cold reminder of where the future would take us.
His ties were released.
Snape came up behind me quietly and carefully placed his hand over mine on the wand. He was so close to me I could feel his breath on my neck. His hand slid almost instinctively to my hip, pulling me to him gently.
“Look, can we talk. Privately?” He asked. I debated refusing him. He was very persistent and annoying though so after a moment I sighed and waved my hand putting up a muffalito charm.
Somehow his mood had changed and I was sure he would regret all the alcohol he drank and his actions in the morning.
"Do you think I'm an empath?" I asked, taken aback still by Riddles soul ramblings. I wanted to believe it was just him trying to manipulate me into wearing the diadem to possess me or something, but I knew reality wise his admiration and excitement had been genuine.
I swept through the halls, the students parting letting me pass terrified of my horrible mood. I had almost made it to my class, which I only had a few minutes before it would start when Lupin found me. I growled trying to walk faster, but his werewolf side let him keep pace.
“You’ve brought me a gift?” Voldemort hissed sitting in what had to be described as a throne in the middle of a hall at Malfoy Manor. My breath came in ragged and my exhaustion was going to be a severe hindrance in my fight with them, I was sure of it. I looked up at his snake like face and gasped in horror seeing myself surrounded by the hooded figures. That’s why they were coming here, they were already coming anyways for some sort of meeting.
All this time I had been wearing a piece of his soul. I wanted to throw up. Luckily I was weak enough I restrained that urge.
I inhaled her lavender scent trying not to let myself dwell on how perfect it smelled. She couldn't be with me. She was innocent and sweet and everything that I wasn't.
“I can assure you, I couldn’t be more straight.” He said with a smirk pulling my hair out of its ponytail letting it fall down around my face. My mind raced realizing what he had planned. My mind said fuck no, but my body ached for more. I had never really wanted to kiss or go further with guys because I never enjoyed it. My body knew what pleasure he could give me and wanted more.
"You fucking IMBECILE! You thief! How dare you steal AGAIN?" My father roared picking me up by my collar despite my shrieks of terror, shaking me roughly.
I should have known he was well endowed with how tall he was, but it still surprised me how big he was when erect. I moaned into the kiss and moved so I was facing him. He pulled me down harder to him, his force so much stronger than my own. I should have felt some sort of panic, but every instinct in me just melted at his command letting him do anything he wanted to me.
"Thirsty? You mean I'm with him for his looks?" I asked, confused. I was sure she didn't mean thirty for more wine.
“What? Lavender Brown said girls like when you take control.” Ron said confused why I pushed him away. I growled a bit backing up so he didn’t try it again.
I pushed her roughly and waved my hand opening the door behind her. I had been about to go into my rooms when she stopped me so the positioning couldn't have been better. It was like fortune wanted us together.
When she went back to bed, silence overtook the room and I didn't know what to say, but I knew I needed to say something.
"I can't believe she drank Harry's potion. She has some balls, that's for sure." Draco said with a slight smile, much more relaxed now that she wasn't dying.
"You should probably go to her. I'm sure she's upset." She said after a long considering moment. She wouldn't give me her blessing, but the meaning made clear. She wouldn't stand in my way either, no matter how much she disproved.
“Are you sure? Nothing seems different to me. Her looking at you doesn’t mean she is bonding with you.” The Headmaster said rubbing his thick beard curiously.
“Thanks.” I muttered not opening it and just leaning exhausted against one of the cauldrons I had put on the floor to clean after I got tired of standing. He opened his mouth to chastise me again, but the fire in his fireplace turned green and in a second Malfoy Sr. stepped through.
"Drop him now!" She demanded. I didn't remember what they screamed at each other next, but within seconds my fathers fist made its way to her face and she crumpled up defeated on the floor.
I ate my cereal in peace after he left and went to go change my robes before I had to get to class. When I got in the common room Harry was already waiting with Ron looking very worried.
I asked her, feeling a sharp stab of pain having gotten my hopes up too soon.
“I will let you get some rest. Tomorrow we will plan for how to keep Voldemort busy so this type of thing doesn’t happen again. For tonight though, get some sleep.” He said getting up and giving me a pat on the shoulder.
I gasped in shock, brought back down to earth with a sharp bang.
"What makes you think that?" He asked curiously.
"You know he killed your father then gave you a memento and your just...okay with this?" I said aghast at his coldness. He shrugged nonchalantly.
Hagrid tried to grab the bird back panicking, but the bird flew up and got caught in the wind. In a split second he was in my hands and the storm dissipated as fast as it started.
"I assumed you asked me down here to yell at me for taking your potions ingredients or for reading dark arts books. I much prefer this." I said after a few moments.
The manor was huge and I quickly got lost trying to find a bathroom. There were rooms full of books that made the Hogwarts library look like a thrift store comparatively, lots of fully decorated bedrooms that were warm and inviting. I found an office that held tall bookshelves that went to the ceiling and a large desk in the middle.
I assumed she was kidding, but she got up to leave with Harry so I didn’t have time to confirm. I just had to hope she was there.
His confidence in me was surprising considering I had failed up until that moment every chance. I felt my confidence pick up and I nodded taking the Dark Lord's hands in mine holding back the revulsion I felt at touching him. His dark energy shying from me and I tilted my head , my anxiety gone and replaced by curiosity.
“I’m fine Albus. I just mouthed off about how needed I was, and well, he seemed to despise that fact even if he agreed since I’m still alive.” Snape explained as vaguely as humanly possible.
"Not money. Love. I dare say, it's a price I'm willing to pay though." He said smiling a bit and I realized he was playing with me.
"Is that a challenge?" He asked raising and eyebrow making to move away. I grabbed him by the shirt I was unbuttoned pulling him back in.
I felt my chest clinch at the thought. I didn’t have time to decide if my anxiety was because I had feelings or just a self-serving feeling since her death would come back negatively on me.
I gave her another shake for emphasis, but she didn't respond.
"Severus, long time no see, eh?" The skinny guy said with what could almost be a genuine smile.
“What are you doing?” I turned around to see Granger standing there looking around confused as if trying to get her bearings. There was only the fireplace, so it was a pointless cause.
"You really don't remember?" I asked sure she was kidding me. She shook her head befuddled, her eyes wide and a slight bit terrified.
"What about you Granger?" I questioned turning my attention to Hermione. Her smile was back and the confidence I loved so much blazed fiercely.
“I can get you some water.” I offered immediately, but he pulled me back down and shook his head.
"Is that what you're doing?" I asked innocently. He growled annoyed and grabbed me by my arm dragging me out.
“Any specific reason for your insolence today Miss Granger?” Snape asked after about an hour of my work. I chanced a glance at him and surprisingly he seemed calm and was watching me almost curiously.
“Your magic feels so dark. I can feel it.” I said confused still able to feel his magic swirling inside of me, aware of it in a way I had never been aware of my own.
“Do you have to be such a bookworm? We need to get you a boyfriend. Or girlfriend if you swing that way.” He said tilting his head observing me obviously never having considered the idea I might be into girls. I chuckled at him bemused.
“I think Molly’ll worry to death if she doesn’t find us home soon,” he tried to say as a joke.
Harry took a peach ring out of the box, got off of the blonde’s lap and got on one knee, smiling in a most precious and adorable way.
“Kids,” Draco assured in a soft tone.
Draco was now lying on the grass, crying of laughter. Or maybe was he truly crying,
“What?”
Does he even see himself
“I- damnit, that’s not how it’s supposed to be-“
There were plenty of different kinds of flowers in 34 Juliet Avenue’s flower shop, but they were not the ones Harry laid eyes on first. What he saw first, were the purple lavenders the boy behind the counter had in his hair. His soft-vanilla-blonde hair.
“I have a ring, it’s just that-“
“If possible? I’m afraid it is, otherwise this wouldn’t have been called a ‘flower shop’, don’t you think?” He paused at the sight of the other boy’s face. “Potter? Merlin’s beard, how in the
“What’s on your mind?”
“Of course! She’s an angel, beautiful, really, you should see her...” Hermione responded.
“Good, I want that too. I’m not going away, ok?”
This had got to be the best day ever. Harry could feel it in his chest when he woke up. He was sure it had something to do with Ginny... his Ginny. He was going to go see her later in the day, and this time, everything would be perfect. She would be perfect.
“Right” Malfoy grinned. He grinned and Harry forced himself not to take a mental picture of it, because he was scared to never remember what sad days feel like if he kept Malfoy’s smile in his head. “Which ones?”
With the rhythm of the melody hummed by the blonde, Harry climbed on the blonde’s feet, slid one hand around his waist and another in his hair, tightened both of them and softly kissed a spot on his neck.
“Well I better be careful, now that you know my technique- except, I’ve only ever used it on one person so I might not get into too much trouble, I hope.”
“We should be the ones worrying about her!”, Hermione says in a laughter. “She wakes you up early
“You know what those flowers symbolize?” she questioned after a while.
“Well, thanks for the flowers, Draco, they’re lovely.”
“Are you talking about the ones in my hair you keep staring at or the ones I sell?”
And with that, Harry closed his eyes, not knowing if the blonde who gave him the purple flowers was a complete fool or a clever idiot.
“We don’t have to go straight back to my parents. We could have a bit of fun around here first.” She was turning and jumping around her boyfriend trying to get excitement out of him.
Harry’s voice was now so shy it sounded like a breath only meant for Draco to understand.
“Marry me.” Harry repeated.
“Hey! You should consider yourself happy someone actually enjoys drinking your Butterbeers! Last time you gave some to Luna and she practically threw up on the table!” replied Ron with a laugh.
Draco chuckled, though it didn’t seem like a joke to his boyfriend. He shrug off the hair covering Harry’s eyes, and stroked it until he said : “You’re daft crazy, Potter.”
His lips closed and he sat, Harry still on his lap.
Their backyard
“Well, I think I’ll be off. Thanks for the invitation, and the delicious homemade Butterbeer,
“Yes, of course I will.”
Harry and Draco have been best friends for eight years and boyfriends for exactly four today, the October 19th.
Harry hadn’t seen his girlfriend come in the kitchen and the sound of her voice almost made him jump. He kept silent.
Malfoy, still talking with his friend back to Harry, turned around.
“Yes- yes I have it! Just-“ He took his wand on the grass and pointed it in the direction of the house. “Accio ring!”
he thought to himself.
Harry Potter woke up to a sunny day. It made him think of the ones where he would run in fields of sunflowers last summer. He would stop for a moment and, after making sure he’s all alone, scream, and laugh loud enough for every flower to hear his love for life.
“You’re daft crazy, Potter. In a proposal, you’re supposed to be so far from me I can’t be able to do this.”
Ginny laughed. “Well exactly, it’s a hundred times better that Harry and I don’t have to live together
The grey eyes were so blurry they couldn’t difference much things, except for the green eyes staring at them and the smile of his boyfriend full of promises. Through the tears dying to escape his throat and eyes, Draco whispered : “You’re supposed to ask the question.”
A year ago, back when he questioned it too much for his own good, Harry read in an article that telling yourself over and over you
exquisite”. Harry winked at Ron because they both knew the bitter taste it actually left in their mouth.
“Well, to the Burrow, obviously.” Harry saw Ginny’s disappointed look. “No?”
don’t even like them.” Harry joked.
“We’re 28!”
“Merlin, you’re going to be the death of me, Potter.”
He quickly came back to his senses and remembered the reason he entered this shop in the first place. Ginny.
*******
only made your unconscious mind gayer. So, he stopped trying to convince himself, in the fear of only worsening the situation. But he wasn’t. Gay. Just, for the self-inf...
all you needed was a flower shop to move on from everything?”
“We’re still kids, Harry.”
Draco held his hand out for Harry and said :
Molly Weasley had changed a lot ever since Voldemort died. For starters, the dark circles around her eyes which sank her down to the Nightmare Place every night had vanished, she regained the pounds she lost and her face had a much more vivid expression. And whenever she had happiness rushes, Harry could even see her face light up like it did before the war. Before she lost- him. Harry knew the horrors of Fred’s death sometimes came back in Molly’s dreams and he tried as hard as he could not to picture his second mother crying in her sleep because of it.
“I- well I- I don’t want to wait. We’ve been together for four years! And I think it’s stupid that you refuse commitment simply because of your father. What about me? Do you think because of your decision I’ll magically stop thinking of us having a future together? That I wouldn’t want us to grow old together?” Harry was impatient, but not mad, and if he was, the emotion faded away the second Draco looked at him with a grin.
“Blimey Ron! You should really think about cleaning this chimney of yours sometime! No wonder why I fall sick every month, the answer is right there, goddamn dirt and—“ His best friend turned around, mashed potatoes all over his mouth and blurred out a “Harry!” all too familiar with him. Ron went towards him before giving him a big hug that Harry took as a “Welcome home, buddy” gesture. He let go of Ron and did the same to Hermione, who was smiling at the sight of Harry visiting them.
Harry, already lost in his thoughts, took the roses-not-rose to the kitchen. He found the perfect vase for them : the transparent heart-shaped one that adjusted its soil to the plants’ needs. Which meant the flowers could never wilt.
******
“Um, not really. I just found them pretty.”
“You’re my best friend, Draco. Of course I want to grow old with you.”
It was a happy kind of shock.
His home was very different, to say the least. To start off, he lived in a flat, which, even though was a rather big one, was nothing compared to Ron and Hermione’s home. There was also the fact that Harry felt uncomfortable living with ancient, he preferred much more the new, the fresh, it was like breathing newly washed clothes when they just came out from the washing machine to him.
Harry knew exactly which ones. The pink tulips and the white irises. “Surprise me.”
Damn it, why did Draco seem to think this was some whimsical question asked on the spot? On top of it all, Harry didn’t feel the bump of the ring in his pocket, and remembered now that he had left it in their bedroom. The universe was really playing with his cards tonight, the night.
“Marry me.” Harry whispered, not taking his eyes off Draco’s lips.
pretty in it.
“No, you’re right, they’re not. They’re only my third favourites.”
“The flowers, what do you think about it?” Hermione almost made it seem like she was rolling her eyes. “I said that Ginny would probably really appreciate a cute gift from you, don’t you think it’d be a good idea?”
. That was enough to tell the difference. Not to mention his whole appearance looked a lot softer, way too much for Hogwarts Draco : his hair, his eyes, his jawline and his lips-
did you manage to find yourself in my shop?”
Ginny got closer to her boyfriend and grinned at the purple roses Harry had in hand. “And for
“What do you think about it, Harry?”
Something was not quite right. He didn’t know if it was normal that he could smell Malfoy’s lavender flowers so overwhelmingly from where he was standing or the fact that he had the sudden urge to buy every flower from Malfoy’s shop, but- wow.
“You’ll either be glad that your ring turned out to be peach candy or you’ll be disappointed and we’ll blame it on the universe for wanting the death of me on my most special night.”
“You know my mom’s going to be happy. She worries about you every bloody day. At least you’ll get to see her and say you’re not dead for yourself”, Ron said in a funny tone.
A package flew out of the kitchen to land directly between the couple. Seeing what lay in front of him, Draco burst out laughing.
“Luna? Luna still talks with you?”
“Hi” Harry was awfully shy for no valid reason. “It’s good to see you, Malfoy. And, well, nobody in my town sells flowers except you, so- What are you even doing in Wackston’s anyway?”
After the war, Harry only continued talking to the people he was already close friends with,  like Mione, Ron, Seamus and Dean. Of course, though, the war times brought all the kids together and now, all the hatred they had towards one another disappeared. They all needed to heal. And they did. This world felt like such a better place now, there was really no reason for anybody to bring unnecessary hatred out of old resentments.
Harry lifted his chin up and catched a breath of Draco’s cologne. Harry couldn’t stand it. He simply did not know how he was supposed to stay this close to his boyfriend without wanting more of him. Draco had this way of bewitching him with almost nothing: a single moment, a single kiss, a single dance, and Harry was all his.
Holding back a smile, Harry took his boyfriend’s hand and blushed at the warm touch of his skin.
Malfoy let out a soft laugh. “I really can’t say you’re wrong, unfortunately. I mean- who
Harry let go of Ginny’s hand and hugged the redhead mother with the smile of an angel. “Really Molly,” he assured her, “you shouldn’t worry about me so much. Living in a flat is very rarely the cause of death of people in London, you know.”
. How on Earth did he get from
24 Binmy Street was a truthfully beautiful house. Harry paid minor attention to its exterior, since he always showed up in their chimney or in rare times by Apparating. He guessed it was pretty resembling to the interior, traditional colours, a tad of modernity right then and there but mostly an old-fashioned house, because Ron would probably not be able to live with technology or with anything created after his birth. Harry always considered it to be a rather huge residence, and from the fact that they moved in a few months ago, he suspected some plans of family fonding between the couple.
, Mom, for Merlin’s sake!” She avoided her mother’s hand jokingly trying to hit her face.
For Harry’s case, it might have been...a year? Two? Yes, two years; since they both left Hogwarts, Harry had completely forgotten the existence of the majority of his fellow classmates.
Ginny? She’s a very pretty girl indeed but- Harry truly wonders if he imagines himself spending the rest of his days with her... She’s far too- girly. And that was what worried Harry most, because if Ginny, the strong independent woman who scares most boys away, was too girly, what bloody kind of girl was he looking for?
The lavender boy only smiled at him one last time, before Harry closed the door behind him.
Draco Malfoy was standing there, eight feet and one counter apart from Harry.
“Huh?”
“You bought a ring? Harry...”
“I said surprise me. I’m not buying them if
“Oh yes, yes, but it’s surely not the same as living with your family here: Ron and George and Charlie... And Ginny!” Oh-how she
He wondered if the boy was simply having a hippie phase or if he was actually- if he was g- well if- if he fancied blokes. Now that he thought about it, it was a lot more natural to imagine Malfoy kissing a guy than kissing a girl.
Hermione made him the face of a mother proud of her 3 year-old’s drawing. “Oh Harry, it’s so great you’re excited to see her! The afternoon would be a perfectly appropriate time for her, I’m very sure.”
The guy had his back faced to Harry and didn’t even see his new client come in. There was no use for eye contact. Harry had seen the golden reflections and how soft the hair looked and he knew, he knew it could not belong to anybody else.
Harry laughed. Was this a way of getting Harry to come back to the shop? “So that’s how you lure your clients in so they don’t ever buy flowers elsewhere, huh?”
Harry nodded. Even though he actually
“Um, hi, I’d like to buy a bouquet of flowers, if possible.”
God, no, god no, he didn’t mean to
“Wackston’s is a great town and the people are amazing. You’ll love it, I promise.” Harry assured him.
“Harry,” he whispered, “right foot, remember?”
Draco was chuckling a bit to try not mixing up his emotions, because if Harry really had a ring, it meant he hadn’t been the only one to think about a wedding for the past months.
“Tell me you’ll marry me.”
The roses smelled so good but when Harry closed his eyes, all his nose remembered was Draco’s lavender perfume overwhelming his mind and body... What a lovely shop, though. If Harry ever wanted buy flowers for Ginny again, he’ll know exactly where to go.
Harry turned into a red tomato. “The- the- selling. Bouquet. The ones in the shop, yeah.”
As he does so and fails every day, Harry’s first thing to do was to take a comb and try (very unsuccessfully but very stubbornly) to put some sense into his hair’s mess. No use. He took the first baggy clothes he found in his drawer before heading straight to Ron and Hermione’s. With his large purple sweatshirt and grey sweatpants, he yelled “24 Binmy Street” before arriving head first into Ron’s chimney.
Harry stared in Draco’s eyes. The roses didn’t seem like his favorites. And he asked him.
If Harry was honest, the last thing he wanted to do right now was to run away with Ginny. He was tired, and he didn’t want the flowers he just bought her to wilt due to lack of water and soil!
to find himself a flat after Hogwarts because he was leaving his school, his only home, he knew Malfoy didn’t have much of a choice either when it came to Malfoy’s Manor : how could anybody even sleep in the house where lived Voldemort without getting horrendous nightmares? He thought about how horrible it must’ve been, not feeling safe in the environment that always was a home to you, and it broke his heart.
Snape had to have removed his tracking curses on the pocket watch at some point. He had no idea it was destroyed.
"I can't believe I almost killed her." I said taking a few calming breaths just realizing how worked up I had gotten now that she was okay.
I relaxed letting him pull my dress down, melting into his ministrations easily. His hands explored my body somehow knowing exactly where to go to please me. I couldn't deny that thoughts of his kiss hadn't kept me up at night on more than one occasion. Many potions classes had been spent remembering how right it felt and daydreaming about the next time he would kiss me.
"The back and forth! One moment I'm ignoring you, the next you're angry at me for nothing. It's like we're two planets rotating around each other, magnetic and attracting the other but unable to touch." She explained stumbling a bit with just standing still, but her explanation was absolutely perfect.
"I'm just a witch. I swear." I said giggling a bit at his flirtation.
I didn't know what happened in Lupin's class, but I was ninety-nine percent sure holding her and seeing her smile that it wasn't dark magic. She was stressed perhaps, but people who went to the dark side didn't have such a light and happy energy to them.
“Where are you REALLY?” She said pulling back a bit and looking in my eyes. She seemed concerned. Her brown eyes were so gorgeous, yet I rarely had the chance to appreciate them in real life.
“Just leave Granger.” I snapped briskly, turning to go make breakfast not wanting to discuss things further. She laughed softly and left, leaving me alone once again.
“Severus. She was just in here a few hours ago for having punched him. I hardly think its love.” He confessed enjoying himself quite a lot. My anger died down even more.
Its not like the headmaster could fire me, this was just a job I took to appease the Dark Lord to keep eyes on Albus. All my real money was in actually selling the potions I brewed in my off time. I made more money than I could ever hope to spend from that and the best thing was I didn’t have to deal with stupid, idiotic staff meetings. If I did it full time I would be in seven figure income easily. I was one of the only potion masters left and yet demand was never better for a high quality product.
She was curled up against me sleeping peacefully, her soft breathing the only sign of life in her. She was clearly exhausted and didn’t stir even when I was moving around. I felt an overwhelming wave of guilt being in such a compromising situation with a student, no matter of age or not. I tried to play it off like I didn’t care about ethics to get her relaxed enough to bond with me, but really I hated myself for crossing that line.
"Don't make more promises you can't keep, I know he has to die. And stop reading my mind!" I said upset with myself for having trusted him more than anything. He was a death eater, what did I expect?
“Miss Granger, when you are done with your potions you are to immediately bring me a sample. Don’t wait until the end of the class and don’t empty your cauldron.” He said without even looking up from the papers he was grading.
"I...I was trying to make...nevermind." She said deflating at my comment, her confidence leaving in a split second. She usually argued back with me, or would meet my gaze with even more hatred than mine had.
"A split second. Why? What did you see?" He asked curiously, but also worried. I backed away from the diadem that still called out to me. Beckoned me to put it on again. Wear it. Become a beautiful powerful queen like only it could make me.
"I asked him to do it." The silence that followed this admission was thick. I couldn't imagine ever asking for one of my family members to die. It was such a cold and calculated murder, how he could sleep at night knowing what he did baffled me.
I could see it. Her future . A family, her in my mansion running around after our black haired child. I could hear her joyful laughter at their insane tactics as if it already existed. She would teach them potions from a young age, feeding their desire to learn with the love and the patience every child deserves.
“I’ve tried Harry. No matter what I do the magic won’t respond. Its like…like someone created a block making sure that no one could ever do exactly what I’m trying to do.” I said frustrated with my lack of progress.
“I wont forgive myself. This wasn’t how its supposed to go. I have done worse than tonight’s deed so many times I lost count. I don’t even register it half the time. Its impersonal and serves a purpose.” I explained trying to articulate without giving details since I knew he was squeamish knowing exactly what I had to do to keep my cover. He hummed peering at me over his glasses.
"Says who?" I was stunned by the question.
“Always! Look at you! Your eyes are all puffy and you look downright exhausted! You need sleep. I have some rose water that should help.” She said grabbing my hand and dragging me away excitedly. Harry refused to rescue me and yawned waving me off and plopping on the red couches ready to sleep.
"Everyone has a price Miss. Granger." He said back to last names it seemed.
"How long..how long was I wearing that?" I asked, taking a few deep steadying breaths. He gave me a weird look and looked at the diadem skeptically.
"You have to eat something Hermione!" Harry urged me putting more food on my plate at lunch. Professor Snape was nowhere to be found at the head table much to my relief. I pushed around the food uninterested in the mixture of steak and vegetables they gave, my appetite nonexistent.
"It depends on who you ask of course." Severus said nonchalantly sitting in the large chair in the middle of the floor. The judge looked down at me standing beside him and I only then realized the aurors had left.
I was stunned.
I had only ever felt Snape's magic before, which was dark but pulled my magic in a strange but strong way. He seemed repulsed by me, or perhaps scared of me.
"Get Harry to the final scene for him to die? How valiant. I know he's a horcrux Snape." I said bitterly hating the fact that I knew the truth. I had been searching for months a way to defeat Voldemort to get to live without his terror hanging over me, but what was the point? By then he would have taken everything worth living for. Perhaps death would be more merciful than life without everyone else.
I waited around all day for Snape to come tell me it was time to go to the meeting, but by the time dinner time came I gave up and went outside not in the mood to eat.
A giant black panther was on Lucius who was screaming like a little girl. Yaxley and Igor had ran off nowhere to be seen clearly not wanting to deal with the massive beast.
“I’m taking her. Potter your welcome to stay and be tortured of course, but I rather think Granger should be your first priority.”
"I don't know why I put it on. I didn't want to." I said stunned at myself more than anything. I didn't want more knowledge or power, but Snapes magic had taken over. For a moment it was like I was possessed by him instead of his magic just living alongside mine. It was a terrifying loss of control.
"You won't be able to bring down Dumbledore without me. He won't let you stay in power. So kill me then." I hissed. My eyes meeting his without a trace of fear. He was surprised.
"You see it too now. Albus tries to hide the reality behind a veil of happiness. What he really wants is control. Power. Just like me. This isn't a battle of right or wrong. Its been a power play all along. He wants to replace the ministry entirely with a group of his chosen leaders. He doesn't care about magic, or equality. He cares about power. He always has." He said closing the distance between us. He reached out to touch me and I flinched back expecting him to hurt me, but he didn't. He just put his hand on my shoulder in a trusting way that I wasn't expecting.
"Look, I'm really sorry for everything with Professor Snape. I took a picture and I showed it to Ron, who gave it to Blaise, who gave it to Colin who said something to some journalist he was bugging at Hogsmeade." She explained, clearly torn up by her unintentional betrayal.
“Why would you keep mine? You never keep any. It’s not like you would need it that often, right? How often can he possibly torture his own followers?” I asked confused. He was still drinking the bottle I gave him and stood up waving me to the fireplace ignoring my question entirely.
"Screw Dumbledore. Screw the Dark Lord. We are much better people than they are. Let's stop doing what they want and do what we want." She said closing what little distance we had between us. The innocent way she looked up at me, I knew she had no idea how dangerous it was to tempt me.
"Finally someone has gotten her out of here." The librarian said shaking her head amused, misreading the situation entirely. I bit my tongue wanting to tell her I most certainly did NOT want to go with him, but I held back.
"Look. I was meanin' to ask you about some potion for my knarls. They've been lookin real thin lately." I didn't stay around to see how it played out, I carefully got out of sight of them then ran inside thankful to get freed from Severus's grasp.
Each item had emotional significance to him which was ironic considering how cold and calculated he was. I saw some drawings in a book about Salazar Slytherin with a locket in it, and I remembered Ginny saying Riddle's memory had a locket on him. I didn't think we were lucky enough to have killed the locket with him since it was just a memory and not the real thing.
My curiosity was piqued even more realizing where we were headed. We weren't going towards the doors outside, but rather the astronomy tower.
I had often wondered why Voldemort didn’t die when the killing curse had rebounded, but had never gotten far in figuring that out. Voldemort’s sudden loss of interest in killing Harry had triggered my suspicions that there was something in it for him to keep Harry alive. I wasn’t sure what, but it had to be significant.
"It's possible I suppose. She has the power for sure. And her mind is just spectacular." He mused going through the book until he found the page he was looking for.
"Fine."
“Your letting him take over the ministry?” I asked horrified sure they must be joking.
"Avada Kedavra." The Dark Lord hissed.
I wanted more.
"I don't suppose you're going to let me in on what this master plan is, are you?" I asked annoyed, but calming down a bit. The fact he hated Harry and was still making sure to protect him eased some of my anger at being manipulated.
"Yes, well we can't all marry rich." I said feeling slightly guilty about the ring around my neck. I didn't want to divulge the scandalous relationship to her just yet.
“Is that so?” He asked looking at me over his spectacles, his eyes sparkling mirthfully.
I said to her using our connection trying to act as casual as possible walking towards her. She crumpled the paper in her hand beyond furious and stalked towards us.
"I suppose so. Though strangely enough you seem reluctant to oblige." I said getting up and sitting in his lap. His shock was tangible, but he adjusted quickly , his hands wrapping around my waist protectively.
“What does it mean Headmaster?” I asked him a bit panicked at how upset he seemed.
"Well...maybe I didn't do so great." He admitted unwillingly. I smirked and handed the glass vial to Hermione. She stared at it shocked for a split second before taking it.
"Oh really? I know most of us would be ecstatic to get more than a one night stand out of him. He just refuses to commit. A player in every sense of the word." Bellatrix said watching Snape dreamily making sure her dress was down in the front enough to give him a good view. Snape just rolled his eyes and talked to some death eater I didn't know. I thought back to his comment at the lake. He never got attached so he could die easier. It was such a dark thing to go through life with.
Was he…flirting with me? I had assumed he hated me, but the look he gave me was of desire.
“Where are we at in the ministries plans?” He asked going straight to business.
"Oh, I'm not allowed to kiss Lucius, but it's not like you're making any moves." I said snarkily, snatching my arm out of his vice grasp. He spun on me fast stopping in his tracks.
"Fuck it." He said, I could feel the warm wetness inside as he came hard forcing me down on his cock several more times. Finally I was able to cum when he released my throat and I leaned against him riding out the wave of pleasure.
I felt guilty realizing I had thought the worst of him when he had given me such blind trust with drinking my potion. I went back to my seat quietly waiting for everyone else to finish mulling over this in my head.
“Then what? People will never trust the ministry again. They will rebel.” I said shaking my head sure the plan would fail.
“Yes actually. Is that such a bad thing?” He asked leaning forward and brushing my hair out of my face tenderly tucking it behind my ear. It was so unexpected I felt my breath hitch and my heart race.
"You accuse me of being dark, yet then drag me off to him every chance you get. Don't you see the issue?" I snapped a bit more loudly since the librarian had wandered off leaving us alone. His eyes narrowed.
"Tell me what's bothering you." I said not answering his question, wanting desperately for such a difficult question to just not exist.
"I will speak with her." I said emotionlessly keeping my mask firmly in place so he wouldn't see my guilt at doing that to her.
"Ah Severus! How wonderful. We were just talking about you!" The Headmaster said drawing Minerva's attention to me. I sneered and was annoyed. They always seem to talk about me when I was away. I didn't have time to ask what the conversation was about . Minerva rolled up the newspaper and started smacking me with it harshly, chasing me when I tried to dodge her.
“I’m sure.” I said to the Headmaster.
"I've never heard of anyone telling him no." I mused. He yawned and stretched out not caring in the slightest if he were caught.
"No. I almost got him fired and his only comment was you need to talk to Miss. Granger, she needs friends right now, not enemy's. I think he's not quite as bad as everyone assumes." She explained, her close call with death by his hands apparently changing her perception.
It was a long pause before she responded.
"YOU TRAITOR!" I screamed, the pain of every lie he ever told me infuriating me. My magic crackled around me dangerously and even the Dark Lord took a step back surprised. Snape just had a slight ironic smile under his mask.
I responded back with more than a hint of innuendo. She was quiet after that so I had no idea if she approved of the flirtation, but my mood was high enough I didn't care.
Neville sullenly packed his things and I couldn’t help but feel pity for him as he left with his head hanging.
"You too then? Why does EVERYONE think I'm into that? I'm literally spending every waking moment trying to fight the Dark Lord." She said with tears starting, her feelings quite hurt. I sighed loudly pulling her to me again, this time successfully.
“Well with my job its unwise for me to have a relationship.” I said staunchly. I knew it was more than that though.
"I have two masters Hermione. What do you think the chance of me getting out of this alive are? My goal has always been to get Potter to the end scene alive. Knowing I would die. I didn't want to be attached to anything that would make me want to stay alive. It would only make accepting my death harder." He explained getting quieter as he walked closer to me. I felt my breath hitch realizing he was right. He was going to die. Yet another person I had become attached to that wouldn't make it to see the end of this war.
He grinned a bit, leaning back in his chair thoroughly feeling great it seemed. The only other time I had seen him smile was at the death eater meeting. The dirty and salacious thoughts this brought back made me blush instantly. He noticed and his grin became a full smirk and his eyes grazed over my body hungrily.
“Of course it is. I corrupted it many year ago Granger. I can see if I can take it back.” He said unsurely. We were in uncharted territory for sure, I had never heard of magic stealing in the many, many books I had read before.
“I hope this is important Severus? We were having an important conversation.” The headmaster said with a sigh leaning back in his chair waiting to hear my explanation.
"What the hell Hermione!" He yelled, the entire rooms attention on us now. I didn't even realize I could do wandless magic, but I could feel the air around me crackling with charge and I felt a rush that was unlike anything I felt before.
"Do you mean that?" I asked quietly, catching my breath.
Good. You will be just mine then.
“I guess love doesn’t care if it takes death to bring people together. It will accomplish its aim regardless.” I mused albeit sadly knowing there would be no real winners in this war once all was said and done.
When I walked in his office the next day he wasn't alone, a very peeved Minerva was at his desk angrily explaining something to the headmaster who wore his usual empty smile. Lupin was just hanging out in the corner lurking seemingly drug in here not out of his own free will.
"Why do you have it?" The silence stretched on longer than what was comfortable. She looked at me with utter contempt.
I felt the hair on my skin standing on end almost feeling a change I couldn't quite place a name too. I glanced around several times thinking I was being followed, but no one was there.
We got to the great hall just in time. Granger was reading the paper and I could hear some of the whispers going through the hall with laughter as I stepped in. I wanted to curse every single one of them that was saying anything mean to her, but I knew I couldn't. I had to act natural.
"You are mine and mine only Hermione. Do you understand?" He asked before pushing me back on the bed roughly getting on top of me in one swift motion.
I closed my eyes taking a deep breath trying to hold back the pain that was physical, but didn’t have any actual cause. It was the pain of having to love her and then leave her all alone.
I tried to take off running, but Igor and Yaxley grabbed me roughly and I was pinned against the wall in seconds. I had no wand since it was in my clothes before I transformed and I had no pockets in my dress. I was screwed.
The light side was royally screwed now.
"The Dark Lord's." I said nervously biting my lip. I wanted to indulge myself, but without an audience this time. He smiled darkly and leaned in whispering in my ear.
“What old man. I was busy.” He snapped leaning back in his chair taking his hands off me. My shirt was still untucked and my hair was a mess from him. The headmaster raised an eyebrow surprised, but strangely enough didn’t comment. Surely such relations were frowned upon at Hogwarts even if the witch was of age?
“You coming Granger?” Draco asked seeing Harry bottling his own attempt at a new potion.
"Yes please." I said eager to get away from everyone and be able to relax and rant a bit with just them not worrying about anyone else hanging around watching. Draco had blown his cover with Voldemort coming in with Harry, but he still didn't seem apt to tempt fate and have all of Slytherin after him for hanging out with us.
“I wanted to see if there was anything I could learn about using a spell on multiple people at once.” I admitted trying to get thoughts of him in the dark with me out of my head. He glanced down at the book and shook his head.
“Severus, you realize red is a Gryffindor color, right, you always argue for green and silver. Every year. Without fail.” She said sounding way too concerned about my color choice. I scoffed at this.
“They control the weather Hagrid!” I yelled over the thunder that started with a large bellow.
I grabbed the stool and reached up to grab it. Even with the stools extra height my fingers barely grasped the worn book. If I was just two inches taller…
“Hermione, stay behind will ya?” He asked me gruffly. I started to feel nervous worrying Snape had told him about everything with how secretive he was being.
He opened his mouth to retort, but quickly closed it unable to figure out what to say. I had made him speechless finally.
"Hopefully whatever happens, happens soon. I want to get on with my life. The drama they cause is enough to make me want to leave the Wizarding world altogether." I said with annoyance knowing I could never actually turn my back on them. Ginny nodded understandingly.
I didn't want to open my eyes and face life without the warmth of his dark magic swirling with mine, surrounding and caressing mine as he had for months now.
"Normally they aren't well fed neighbors for it to show." He said with a shake of his head. The sun was starting to set and it was getting colder fast. I started shivering so he immediately pulled me to him to warm me up. The protective way his arms wrapped around me lulled me into a false sense of security, so when I saw some people approaching his wrought iron gates, I was a bit surprised.
“Great. Who’s next? If I can’t kill the Potter brat, the least I can do is destroy his toy.” He said with a chuckle of happiness. I had never seen him in person, but the aura of insanity oozed off of him in waves. I bit my lip and tried to right myself, but the next curse hit with an almost silent incantation and I was back shaking under the pain biting my lip so hard I drew blood just trying to keep quiet.
Even if that wasn’t enough it was his dark black eyes that seemed so dark yet this close I could see an almost playfulness left in their depths. Something you could only see up this close, which only made it more enticing.
Perhaps me pushing him away was my heart's way of protecting itself from the oncoming loss I knew I would be devastated by.
“Okay students! Everyone gather around now. Come on! Don’t be shy! We have a real treat for ya today.” Hagrid said urging everyone to come to him where he had a large cage he was bringing out of his hut. In it sat a tiny beautiful white and gold bird that was watching everyone cautiously.
He pushed me into a warm bedroom that looked much like his office rooms and stalked to me with a deadly look in his eyes. I was scared, yet I wanted to see more of him without control.
“Using a spell on a potion knowing full well it is banned…bold even for you Granger.” He said the moment we were alone.
Slowly the conversation picked up again once I sat down and I could hear my name being whispered across the hall more times than I could count.
"That's bollocks, he was with me!" I said indignantly. The judge raised an eyebrow questioningly.
"Severus Snape, you have been charged with the murder of Mccoy Finnely on the night of the twenty fourth of December. How do you plead?" The judge asked lightly.
"I want everyone to redo the beautification potion you were working on before break." I said sharply flicking my wand at the board showing the instructions for everyone to work off of incase they were idiotic and forgot their book.
What was that about?
"What is today? Hermione has no right day? Who is he to tell you what happened? Bragging about his conquests, was he?" I snapped fighting back tears hating how rude I was being, but just so frustrated with everyone. She looked taken aback and then concerned.
I didn’t even mean to think it to her, but I knew she recognized the thought because her smile fell a bit.
"They will let themselves out." He said not caring about formalities. I found myself caring significantly less also feeling the relaxation of being with him edging me towards a deep sleep.
"I haven't ever seen a pregnant house elf before." I commented, surprised that I had missed such a thing.
I zoned out paying the bare minimum attention to her many outfits she had gotten from the second hand shop that looked amazing on her. She could wear rags and look good. Snape had intentionally went out to find me tonight. He was drunk, sure, but it was like he couldn’t resist the urge to come play with my mind. Make me think he wanted me just to leave. I was curious how far he would have gone if Dumbledore hadn’t shown up when he did. His comments about what he regret come back up and I had to force my heart rate to not speed up unbearably.
A hand popped up snatching the book before I could get it and I almost toppled over in shock.
"I have made peace with my path long ago Hermione." He said gently.
"No. Go to your next class." Professor Lupin said leaving no room for discussion. I sighed heavily feeling like the air was going back to normal finally. It had to be all in my mind. The air couldn't become thinner randomly, and there were no dementors here. Maybe everyone was staring because Professor Lupin's magic had vanished. It was quite peculiar actually. I had never seen someone's magic dissipate ever. Deflect, yes, but not dissipate.
“With each spell that exists, there is generally a breakdown that happens.  A suffix and prefix. Levicorpus, Levi meaning levitate, and corpus meaning body.” He explained smoothly, the firelight seeming to flicker in just the right way to make him full of life.
"What are you doing?" My mother said coming in waking from her endless lines of naps. I felt a bit of relief. She would protect me at least. She looked at me and was horrified.
When we got in the courtroom, it was already filled with people including a presiding judge that I didn't recognize. The rows of people looked at us walking in curiously from their high seats.
"Why are you stopping? I want you. No one can say what we can do now. What more can you ask for?" I asked, pulling him down a bit not ready to stop. He chuckled and kissed my cheek not giving into my demands.
The room was silent.
She gasped in front of me stepping back shaking her head as if trying to clear her thoughts and bury the memory again.
“I’m just tutoring her.”
"I'm fine." She mumbled sitting back down slowly refusing to look at me. Poppy sighed and nodded giving her a firm pat.
He was fairly light skinned, but he had not a single wrinkle on him. His hair was thick and glossy, its health evident even without me touching it. He didn't have a single grey hair anywhere.
"Of course." He said simply.
"Whatever you do, don't put it on." Draco warned me firmly, looking at the cursed piece wearily. I smiled and put it on before he could stop me.
“Studying. Sure...learn anything new?” Harry asked smiling knowingly but not commenting thankfully on who was just in here.
“Strange though. They generally only like other magical creatures. They hate regular witches and wizards. Isn’t that something.” Hagrid said taking the bird back and cooing at it before putting it away.
The Dark Lord.
I gasped jerking away from him stunned.
"I am a potions master. I'm fairly sure that qualifies me automatically as a good cook." I could have smacked myself in the head for my stupidity. Of course he could cook, it was all the same following directions. He picked me up easily and set me on the counter immediately feeling me a bite of eggs that were still piping hot. They were so fluffy and light it was heavenly.
“I think Professor Snape is in trouble.” I said biting my lip hoping I wasn’t completely mad.
“Well I’m pretty sure I’m not supposed to be here. In your rooms. It’s indecent, crossing a line of mortality.” I said nervously. He stood up frustrated  at this going to the kitchens.
"Hmmm...well of course not with your nose always in a book. If you marry rich you won't need all this studying and with your good looks you could easily catch a nice rich wizard." She told me wisely, nodding to herself at the idea. My mouth literally dropped open at her backwards comment realizing she was dead serious.
Anytime I started to trust him, he messed up and made me question everything all over again.
"Why do we keep doing this?" I spun around and almost spun into her not realizing how close she was. Her lavender shampoo wafted up at me teasing me.
“Truly.” He murmured running his finger on his lip thoughtfully. I had expected him to yell at me love didn’t exist or was just for the weak, but he seemed to agree. I scrubbed the cauldron with slightly less angry energy, my mind swirling with confusion on what to make of him as opposed to worry about not dying.
"No, I want you." I said letting his shirt come off. I hadn't noticed it last time, but he wore a silver locket. It was familiar, but I only got to focus on it for one second before he kissed me again, not letting me stay distracted for long.
Snape’s plan for changing our governing system was bold. It went against everything we were taught to respect in a government. Freedom was supposed to be a given right of modern day countries, so to intentionally take away peoples freedom was not going to go over well with all people.
"Of course professor. Wouldn't want people think I was up to no good, wouldn't you?" I sniped back folding my arms across my chest. He ground his teeth at the attitude, but he left quickly not staying to fight like I expected.
“It’s everything.” He gave no further explanation and swept out handing the book to the old cashier who I only then realized had a full view of our interaction. I couldn’t have blushed deeper if I tried. I grabbed one of the transfiguration books I had been interested in a few weeks ago and took it to the counter to pay.
"I'm sorry...no?" He said as if confused with the meaning of the word.
“Severus?” The headmaster’s voice cut through my thoughts and I only then realized I had let my guard down and had gotten lost in my thoughts. The headmaster was back with Harry and Draco and the boys looked at me far more concerned for me than I deserved.
I twisted the ring he gave me in my hand forgetting where I was in the advanced healing book yet again, my thoughts drifting to that night under the stars. The way he kissed me wasn't like I had been kissed before. It was hard to pinpoint exactly what the difference was. It held a desire that I felt within myself. A passion that drove me mad just to think about wanting to forget everything I said and kissing him again like that.
“That’s impossible. I was the one casting the spell. I was showing you how to do it correctly.” He said twirling his wand absently. My mind started to reel realizing what I felt.
How can you say that when you're being arrested?
"I'm more than a death eater." He said weakly. My heart stopped realizing how badly I misjudged him. He had a single tear falling down his cheek and I wiped it away shaking my head empathetically.
“Not her.” I whispered more to myself than him, drinking my drink in a single swallow. I leaned over stressed closing my eyes trying to block out my misdeeds.
“Bye Potter. Enjoy.” Voldemort said drinking in the drama more than the wine in his goblet.
"Of course you are. You are my hero. Just hold on a bit longer please." I begged him sobbing trying to calm down enough to think of a counter curse or way to fix the curse he was struck with. It was essentially a slow moving death curse that guaranteed a slow painful death.
"Hermione, it will help the pain. Goodness, Madame Pomfrey said you would be in pain, but I didn't think it would be this bad. Draco, go get her." I couldn't stop sobbing long enough to even explain it wasn't a physical pain I was dealing with.
"Looks quite happy indeed." Minerva said with a tight smile mirroring my earlier statement about the picture in the article that started the morning's drama. I snorted in amusement, shaking my head still quite shocked.
"Not much else to say really." I said vaguely. Harry and Draco shared a look and I knew they were going to ask more questions so I got up.
I drank my hot chocolate considering his words. He was right. I had crossed the line of decency, but she hadn’t really. She hadn’t opened up at all let alone let her guard down.
I had seen how stressed she was. She had lost weight for sure, and while she was normally the calm one of her friends she had lashed out more often than was normal for her. Yet, I had to continue on. To not go along with the Dark Lords plan would mean she wouldn’t serve a purpose anymore. She would be dead.
"I hope he kills you. You deserve it."
Life continued on over the next few weeks giving me a break from his drama. When we had our training sessions together he kept everything perfectly professional and made no comment to our night escape. During classes he was predictably jerkish and docked points as usual for every little infraction.
"Oh, I'm sorry Miss. Granger. I missed the update that you are too special to make the correct potion. Surely you don't assume you are so beautiful you wouldn't have any use for a beautification potion?" I said silkily, my anger at her for practicing the dark arts coming out full force. She looked shocked, then hurt. I could hear a few of the slytherins snickering at this comment despite the fact that I knew they had been talking before the break about her attractiveness.
I looked to Snape while he was distracted. He was in line with the other death eaters and the mask hid his face, but I could see the slightest quirk of smile under his mask, our argument seeming insignificant now in comparison to such an acomplishmemnt.
“I think you misunderstand her intentions Severus.” He said confidently.
I felt the searing pain streak through my body, but instead of screaming in agony the pain seemed to fuel my fire. I smiled up at him sinisterly. The look of total fear on his face was perfect.
"We both know that's a lie." Lupin said, sounding a bit sad. I sneered in annoyance at his care.
"I'm aware. How did you figure that out?" He asked curiously. My jaw quite literally dropped open.
"I'm sorry. I'm busy." I said brushing him off going back to my reading refusing to acknowledge him. He slammed his hands on the table and leaned in angrily, his mood sour.
“He’s a jerk to everyone.” I explained  not wanting rumors to start about us. Especially since there was no us.
She was pale and a mess from the cruciatis and then me running my hands into her hair passionately pulling her into me. When I got back to my rooms I sat beside Granger and carefully brushed her hair out of her face. She was an angel compared to me and I had done the most wicked of deeds to her. And wanted more. I was fucked up. Even remembering the way she leaned onto my chest while I fucked her was enough to have me ready for another round. She was passed out and I had no business ever touching her again.
“Leave it to you to give me a death hug after I finally escape alive.” He said sarcastically, his voice was raw and yet barely above a whisper. I didn’t have to ask to know he had been tortured again.
"Leave her alone, it was me! She didn't do anything." Harry said angrily shoving the Dark Lord away and standing in between us, always the valiant knight. I knew what was going to happen a split second before it did, but I watched in slow motion, my horror building seeing the green curse hit him squarely in the chest.
"If you want of course." He said toying with me. I glared at him, but smiled despite myself.
The burned hand on the headmaster was definitely from his family's ring, it made perfect sense. After researching a bit on how horcruxes worked I was sure the diary was one too. It literally had a piece of Voldemort's soul in it.
He grinned knowingly.
"See, I told you it was him! He deserves to be sent to Azkaban!" A hysterical woman said from the stands, tears running down her face and a handkerchief in hand. Severus's eyes narrowed dangerously to her.
His lips were on mine before I could register him leaning in and I felt my next scream muffled by him.
I got to Hermione's but hers was entirely wrong. I didn't even recognize the concoction she was making. It was a shimmery dark blue and smelled absolutely divine. She bit her lip nervously and shifted uncomfortably under my disproving gaze.
"Oh dear, what happened?" She said running her spells the moment I laid her down.
"I just came back from sneaking to the quidditch patch with Harry." He said casually as if this was the most obvious thing in the world. He looked me up and down taking in my tired state.
“That’s it exactly.” I admitted just to annoy him even more. He paced towards me backing me up to the walls, his eyes flashing dangerously.
"No idea. Maybe he's just lost what little sanity he has left." Draco said brushing off my worry. Harry frowned worrying just like me of what the end game was.
"Thank you my Lord." I said when he was done, death evading me for one more day now. I had never regretted inventing that spell more than I did today.
"So your okay with me seducing her, but as long as no one knows? What kind of crap is that?"
Ginny dragged me up the stairs, her excitement quite intense for someone who just wanted to get me to sleep more.
"Nothing. Just something I have to take care of." I said taking a deep breath not knowing if my plan would succeed at all. My thought that they could be destroyed by fiendfyre was and educated guess at best.
"I can't defeat him though." I mumbled trying to clear my head, quite sure the dead boy smiled at me.
Like a waterfall came over me I felt his magic pass through my wrist and back to me, this time pulling mine back out with it. His eyes grew wide and he let go abruptly.
“Ron, why don’t you go with her. It’s not safe to go alone at night, you know.” Lavender said sweetly giving an unwilling Ron a shove.
"What's a king without a queen?" He asked with a smirk taking my hand and kissing it. It was only then that I realized what I was missing.
“Let’s go.” He was devoid of all emotion grabbing me by my arm and shoved me on the fire throwing the floo powder in. He didn’t send me to Malfoy manor since it was blocked off so even once we got into the little shack he sent me to he, we had to walk to Malfoy’s house.
"What would give you that impression?" I asked, wondering how he jumped to that conclusion by me hugging her. He shrugged a bit.
“Neville asked me to go with him to Hogsmeade tomorrow.” She gushed happily the moment we were alone except for our sleeping bunk mates. That’s why she wanted Harry to find me, to gossip. Of course. I had forgotten that today was Friday let alone the fact that we had a Hogsmeade weekend coming up.
"I hope you enjoy the dish? I went with something non traditional. After all, your not quite the steak and potatoes type." He said with an amused smirk eating his own food steadily. I noticed the slight shake of his hand and realized he had to have just come from a meeting. Obviously it hadn't gone good.
"Is something wrong Severus?" The headmaster asked me closing the book he was reading and peering at me calmly, his lack of emotion pissing me off. I slammed my hands on his desk. I probably shouldn't have, but it was that or I would deck him.
"I want you to encourage it. Keep your enemy's close, right? If we turn her, we turn Potter. You saw how he came running in to her rescue. I have Draco working on Potter also. If I can't kill him I might as well have him at my disposal and not have all my plans ruined by him. Plus, I get a new weapon." He explained referring to Granger. I relaxed slightly realizing I wasn't going to die. Today at least.
"But you also would know if they are destroyed, right?" I said pointedly. He stopped pacing considering this.
The Dark Lord waved his hand and a mirror appeared and he took in his youthfulness touching each part of his body fascinated by the changes.
She knew the deep dark parts of my past and my soul and still accepted me. Just like that. I had anticipated horror on her part and quite a lot for anger. Instead it was almost like...like she was proud of being with me?
“He’s my professor.” I said shaking my head while handing her the change.
When he finally opened the latch to the top of the tower I was stunned by what I saw. A hundred small glimmering orbs hung suspended all around the top of the tower lighting up the space delicately. There was a small table with hot food on it and two glasses of wine with its own candle on it. It was a beautiful setup fit for a queen.
“I will see you soon.” She said with a smile that looked worried before she vanished. Just like that. She was gone. I tried to think of her, bring her back, but it was useless. The darkness became overbearing lonely and even the firelight couldn’t light up the space anymore.
"She stole my magic."
"I'm here on his orders actually. My task was to keep him from doing anything useful for the day , apparently he thinks someone's trying to find something that belongs to him. Not sure why he would think that." Draco said with a shrug. I froze realizing the Dark Lord could tell I was messing with the horcruxes. It never occurred to me he knew when one was moved, but I hoped he didn't realize Severus took off his pocket watch. That would put us both in danger very fast.
"No. She's not. I went through her memories to make sure. What you saw must stay between you and I, understand? I had your back, now you must have mine. A wizard's word is unbreakable." I told him firmly stressing how important this was to him. He nodded empathetically, his eyes wide at the seriousness of the order.
I would give my life for her. Switch places with her. Whatever it took.
“Your fucking insane! How can Harry hang out with you?” Ron yelled drawing a nice crowd around us.
"Oh? I don't think you could stop yourself if you tried." I said with a grin.
“There’s no meeting tonight. You’ll be fine.” He said quietly mistaking my nervousness about potentially poisoning the potions master for nervousness about being kidnapped again. I smiled meekly realizing that is where my concern should have been.
"I have known him since I was born and I haven't ever seen him look at someone like that." Draco mused looking at me like perhaps I had the answer.
Bellatrix turns to look at him and laughs as she sees him struggling to get to Draco. "Don't worry, after i'm done with my dear nephew i'll be sure to question you next." She laughs. Harry is the roughly dragged down the stairs away from Draco.
"Now we won't be forgetting who actually caught him I hope, Mr. Nott." He says. Nott turns around quickly.
Bellatrix stands back up from where she fell. "Stupid elf you could've killed me!" She yells at Dobby.
”I said stop. That’s my son and I won’t let you hurt him anymore.” Narcissa says as she stares her sister down.
The snatchers let go of their captives and Draco, Ron, and Hermione all run to a wall to get some distance from the fight. Bellatrix walks back to the front of the room, the leader being pulled by the whip around his neck.
Harry looks around at the others. All thinking the same question. Why was he needed?.
"No! No! Don't touch him!" Harry yelled as he was being pulled down the stairs to the cellar by Peter Pettigrew. "Keep me! You can have me! Take me!" He begged. He had to protect Draco.
Suddenly there was a loud pop behind them. Harry turned around to see Dobby standing there.
He was about to continue when a hand landed on his shoulder. He turned to see Hermione shaking her head at him.
"I don't really have time for that." I said evenly used to her prying. She was a kind old lady, but rather nosey.
He said glancing down at me seeing me nodding off a bit. I sighed and wrapped one arm around his neck closing my eyes obediently and I was out.
"No. Never. I'm sorry, I forgot myself for a moment." I said emptily turning and walking away. I needed to get distance between myself and her. She was too dangerous. I never lost control. Ever. Everything I did was calculated and intentional.
“Where am I?” She asked taking the hand I offered to her letting me draw her up close. No hesitation like in real life, she just melted into me.
It was all fake promises to get what he wanted. Me to do the Dark Lord's bidding.
"I'm not your toy." I retorted hotly and made to stomp away, but he grabbed me roughly by my wrist pulling me back to him, his dark eyes full of ice.
"Save him. He can owe me a life debt. He deserves the shame of owing his life to a muggleborn." I said barely above a whisper. He growled a bit obviously not liking my plan, but reluctantly gave in, releasing Lucius who got up scampering away faster than I had ever seen anyone run before.
"What's that?" Harry asked curiously.
"Why do you need me? Looks like you already got what you want." I said harshly refusing to show fear. His eyes darkened and he stalked towards me quietly. I glanced around for Nagani and the goblet that he always kept near him, but they were both gone.
"Yes. Minnie will have baby soon. Minnie can't wait, maybe Mister's friend wants to give baby their first clothes?" She offered to me kindly. I smiled loving the fact she looked forward to freedom for her baby as opposed to despising it.
“Shit.” I heard Snape mutter and for a brief second he looked scared before his bastard mask was back in place perfectly.
I collapsed into tears unable to hold back.
"Oh, don't have enough juice for your next article?" I asked harshly, still angry for her betrayal. She sat down fidgeting with her red hair nervously biting her lip.
The box was small, but looked expensive. I opened it carefully hoping it wasn't from the Dark Lord and I would die in a few seconds. Luckily for me it contained a beautiful white gold ring on a simple thin chain. It was stunning, but unexpected. When I pulled it out of the box a note was charmed to appear and I picked it up recognizing the familiar scrawl instantly.
