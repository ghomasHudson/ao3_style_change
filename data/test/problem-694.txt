Potter suddenly spots them, and his smiles widen as he waves at Draco, signalling them to come over. Or was he waving and smiling at Padma?
She winces. “Well, not all of it, but yeah, he did substantially help. We felt a bit guilty accepting, at first, but we actually needed the help at the time. Besides, now we’ve realised it’s just how he is. He helped Neville set up his greenhouses, he finances most of Luna’s travels when she can’t find another way, he invested in Dean and Seamus’ pub when they started, and even once bought a whole lot of top-notch broomsticks for Ginny’s team, when the club was doing poorly. You know, at the time, he even gave George – and Fred – the money to start their shop.”
Draco lowers his cup to stare at him. “You literally live a building surrounded by thousands of kids.”
“That ended a month ago! And, spoiler alert, I don’t come here because of a deeply rooted fondness for kids, or quidditch, or fries, or whatever shenanigans you decided to pull me into that day. But you know what?” Draco says as he gets up. “If all of this is just
He finishes his coffee in one gulp with a panicked look to the door, then sits next to Draco, thigh against thigh, to put on his shoes.
“And here are your fries, lovelies,” Rosmerta interrupts, setting up two plates on the table. “And there’s the usual ketchup and mayo for you, Harry, and Draco, I didn’t know so I put a bit of everything. Can I get you anything else?”
“I was tired of other people branding my body, so I decided to do it myself.” He feels Draco tense a little, and lightly bites his skin. “I put my parents there, and my friends, and everything that made me feel like me.” His hands go up Draco’s flanks, ending up over his shoulder blades. “I needed to ground myself in my own body.” He trails kisses all over Draco’s jaw, feeling his breath hitch under him, up to his mouth. He then raises up, straddling Draco, and stares straight into his eyes. “I’m surprised you don’t have any, to be honest with you.”
Draco has the smallest of nod, probably to acknowledge he’s heard him. Harry waves awkwardly and turns back to the stairs.
He soon focuses on the game at hand, keeping an eye on the players while looking for that golden glimmer that will lead him to victory. The exercise is familiar, and he keeps tabs of the score at the back of his head, circling the field at different heights, watching nowhere and everywhere at once. He also keeps an eye on bludgers, would one fly his way, and on Draco, in case he would see something.
But, despite the sneer in his words, Draco already seems more relaxed, and the smile on his lips is kind.
The implications are all too clear in his smirk, and Draco buries his head in his mug. Why is he feeling embarrassed? He woke up naked in Potter’s bed, for fuck’s sake.
“I have to go check the quidditch field, I promised a game this afternoon to the kids. I’ll show you the exterior on the way, and then you can see the main building when we come back.”
“I will not name names,” Harry warns, pointing at him with a fry. “Just trust me when I say that blood magic can do as much good as harm.”
Harry turns toward Draco. “Sorry, these games with the kids are always a bit of a mess. If you see one running away, could you try to stop them? Or at least yell at me, so that I can.”
“Padma, I know it’s none of my business, professional or otherwise but, as I was going through the ministry’s files on this place, I couldn’t help but notice you only receive minimal pubic funding. Now, I know Potter said that you wish to remain independent, and that you have a lot of generous private donors, but you know you could ask for more, right? I could direct you to the correct forms, if you wish. You would get it, with all the amazing work you do here.”
“It still is,” Draco admits quietly, though he doesn’t really know why. Why he would say that kind of things to Potter. “I guess it always will be.”
Harry laughs. “That’s the spirit I love. Come on, Ginny has got the team making all in hand, let’s go get brooms and balls.”
Both teams are shaking hands and hugging in a spirit of comradry. Harry would like to go after Draco, hug him, kiss him and tell him it was just luck, but Draco doesn’t seem in the mood for that and everyone else is around them. He resolves to do that later as Ginny pulls him in for a hug and drags him to the rest of his team, who joyfully claps him on the back. Children are also gathering around them all, yelling and jumping and asking wild questions. Harry feels good seeing some of them are surrounding Draco, keeping him busy.
“Well, first of all,” he says as he plants his fork in the pie, “I’ve been really busy with this fundraiser.”
“That’s a cool name,” she says after thinking about it. “Hey, Harry, can I help you? I’m three, now, I’m old enough to help!”
Harry takes off his shirt, letting it drop on the floor. Draco is faced with the huge tattoo on his back, representing a wolf, a doe, a stag and a dog. The snake is coiled up at their feet, but seems to wake up as Harry stretches his arms. The other animals move as well, but their movements are more similar of a picture – just a repetitive loop. The snake seems truly alive, and he goes up to Potter’s right shoulder, joining the hippogriff splashing his wings.
“That black spot over there, though,” he winces, “is where Luna very kindly planted what she believed to be innocent hairy corndoodles gathered on her trip to Greece, but turned out to be very dangerous level three controlled substances plants? I don’t even remember the precise name. Luckily professor Sprout was here only a couple days after they were planted, and very kindly took them from us before anyone got hurt. She was actually pretty happy, she said it would be a good project for her seventh years. But now Luna is forbidden from bringing anything here, plant or beast or even food, that hasn’t been approved by a specialist of the topic. That’s a bit of a shame, the kids love her and hearing the stories of her travels. She’s quite a good storyteller.”
“Hey, boys, nice to see you,” Rosmerta says as she puts their usual butterbeers and fries between them. “It’s been a while since we hadn’t seen that boyfriend of your, Harry, I started thinking he dumped your ass.”
, I said,” she adds to shut up Ron. “I’m no saying there is no issue with him, but at least these ones are out of the way. Besides, from what I’ve seen of him lately, he does seem perfectly nice.”
“Sorry, I got to go, I guess,” he whispers. “Take all the time you need to get ready, don’t worry, and let me know about Sunday, alright?” He turns to him with a smile, putting his hand on Draco’s thigh and planting a kiss on his cheek. “Have a nice day,” he adds before jolting up to the door, here he turns to wink at him.
He extends his hand to shake Draco’s, but realises that it’s still full of dirt and ends up waving awkwardly as he leaves.
The box they’re in is around the middle of the field, high on top, just above the players, for a panoramic vision of the game. There’s only a few seats there, and most of them aren’t even taken. Potter walks toward the front row and turns back to him, his smile crinkling up to his eyes.
He fears that less and less each time he sees Draco, though. Because he’s still here, even after everything else, and that has to count for something, right?
“Well,” Harry turns away again, “She’s the reason I’m still alive. After Voldemort killed me – or, rather, killed the part of himself in me –, we were both out I don’t know for how long, and when he woke up he asked your mother to check if I was still alive, and I was, but she asked if you were alive, so I said yes, and she told him I was dead. If she hadn’t lied to him, I would probably have really ended dead. So it’s actually you who are the reason I’m alive, I guess.” There he is again with that smile.
He seems angry. Harry knew he shouldn’t have gone down that path. That’s why he never does. That, and he doesn’t really like to dwell on it, either.
Potter is talking and laughing with some people Draco recognizes as high-ranking ministry workers, including the minister himself. From where he’s standing with Padma, Draco has no idea what Potter is saying, but everyone seems fascinated by it, and Draco totally understands them.
The truth is, after-war Potter reacted very different from what everyone else expected him to. They all thought he had a brilliant auror career ahead of him, right under the spotlight, that would have ended pretty early with the position of Minister of magic open just for him. But no, instead, Harry completely disappeared form the radar, not even coming back to Hogwarts, as it was found later to raise his orphan godson, and when he reappeared, it was to open this orphanage that has been his career since. He has refused to talk about anything else than that in interviews, has never hinted of having any life plans besides that, and has remained a mystery, as he always was, in a sense – though a different one this time.
He’s really happy Draco’s here, but he must admit he’s a bit worried about everyone else’s reaction. The were all pretty cool when he told them, but there’s a difference between knowing and seeing.
“And if I wanted that for Teddy, wasn’t it fair to want that too for the other war orphans? Didn’t they deserve it too? Being an orphan is shit enough as it is, they don’t need exclusion and loneliness on top of that. None of these kids will be abandoned as long as I’m here to stop it.”
“It’s Adam,” Matty says, “but he says he doesn’t want to be my game buddy because then I try to hug him but he doesn’t like being hugged and then he’s mean at me and then I cry and then he cries too because he doesn’t like it when I cry and then Amantha says she can’t even enjoy the game in peace.”
Harry isn’t exactly fond of surprises, as too many of those have backfired against him in the past. But he knows Ginny won’t let go, so he says “Alright.” He then turns to her. “But please don’t tell anyone about it. I don’t want people to know, and I don’t want him to be embarrassed.”
“I swear it’s like herding cats,” he sighs. “Anyway, sorry for all that. And,” he smell his own shoulder “sorry about the smell. There may have been an incident involving manure.”
Rose stares at him with a frown, then nods and extends her little hand. “Hi, I’m Rose Granger Weasley. What’s your full name?”
Harry is kneeling on the ground, showing Jerry how to dig a nice hole for some pepper plant, when he sees a familiar silhouette on the edge of his sight. He raises his head, then stands up with a determined sigh and wipes his dirty hands on his jeans.
Maybe he wasn’t casual enough? Maybe Draco just wanted meaningless sex, and instead Harry offered him breakfast and quidditch with kids? Of course Draco ran. He sobered up and realised that he didn’t want that trainwreck in his life, which is understandable. After all, Harry jumped on him after what, two dates? That weren’t even dates? Who does that? Some sort of regular drunkard, probably.
Draco nods and, half-heartedly, admits: “You still get on my nerves too.” He then sighs, and adds: “I shouldn’t have talked to you like that, I imagine.”
“Yeah, I finally made some use of my brief and infamous past as captain of the Gryffindor quidditch team.”
They keep talking about the game – mostly Potter, but Draco joins in once the firewhisky starts kicking in – while the fries and the drinks come and go. Draco is surprised at how easy talking to him actually is, considering they spent most of their youth hating each other. Maybe it’s the firewhisky helping, but here, in this noisy pub, eating fries with his hands and facing Harry Potter, Draco is actually feeling more relaxed than he did in a long time – than he ever did, maybe. Strangely, for once, he doesn’t feel self-conscious at all. Maybe it’s because Potter himself seems to have no knowledge of the word or its meaning, with his tee-shirt that has holes on the collar and is probably two sizes too big, his hair that is getting all over the way for all the times he puts his hand in it, or his unashamed laughs.
Draco’s fingers briefly touch Harry’s and he makes the pot of cream, emptying half of it into his mug. He feels Potter’s stare on him all along, but doesn’t look back at him.
“Apology accepted. But you didn’t have to be so formal about it,” he says, squeezing Draco’s fingers.
In the end, he joins Draco standing on the edge and says: “The property extends until that fence over there. If you want to go and start checking what you have to check, I’ll join you right after I’ve taken the kids back inside.
“It was brilliant!” Potter exclaims as he takes one of the glasses. “I won’t bore you with the details, I know you don’t care, but know that Ginny did a stunning catch of the snitch.”
His throat is tight. He has the impression Draco has been distant tonight – more than usual –, as if he did something wrong. Or maybe he’s getting bored with him already? He shouldn’t have invited him to the fundraiser. It was boring, and noisy, and why did he think Draco would enjoy it when he hates them himself? That was a terrible idea.
“I have accused you of making assumptions about me, and yet I have been guilty of the exact same thing toward you. And for that, I… I apologize.”
Harry laughs as he picks up the last fries in the plate. “Well, she can’t fire me. Ok, technically she can, but I don’t think she will. Or will she?”
“No, I get what you mean,” says Draco, making Harry raise his head. “It was a horrible thing, but thanks to it, things are better now.” He smiles sadly.
Potter’s smile is all too smug, now. He puts his hand on Draco’s neck and his thumb slowly runs across his jaw. “Ask again,” he dares him in a whisper.
He starts walking to the locker rooms, and feels some relief when he hears Draco’s footsteps behind him. Just to be sure, once they’re far enough from the others, he says: “You know I don’t believe in this Slytherin-Gryffindor rivalry anymore, right?”
When they leave the bar, Draco doesn’t wait for his invitation to follow him. In the almost dark of Scottish summer nights, Harry grabs his hand. Draco doesn’t stop him.
“Ginny also comes sometimes, to wow them with some fancy techniques she learnt. She also gives us invitations for the whole school to some of her matches. The kids think she’s way cooler than me and they’re absolutely right.”
“Draco, wait!” Harry yells, shooting after him. “Rosmerta, I swear I’ll pay next time, put this on my bill,” he says as he passes the counter.
“Sorry,” Harry says to shorten his awkwardness. “I shouldn’t keep you here when you have work to do. I’ll owl you the details if you want, and you can let me know then if you can make it.”
Where he was expecting a clean jean and a t-shirt with no holes – what he thought Potter’s idea of “fancy dress” was –, he sees a dark green, well-tailored suit, on a crisp white shirt. With his dark hair that he slightly trimmed before coming to London to stop it from constantly falling into his eyes, Potter is stunning. Not that he would ever tell him. Or anyone. And – is he wearing a tie? Draco doesn’t want to dwell on that.
“But you don’t have to stay,” Potter adds. “Maybe you have things to do. You can apparate straight out of here, if you want. Do as you wish, really.”
He waves it off with his hand. “It’s alright. I guess with kids there are always bound to be… incidents.”
Potter laughs as he leans and pushes the bed sheets. “There’s like, two dozens, at most. Who live there, I mean. Maybe a bit more in the summer.”
“I’m not done yet. What I mean is, don’t go self-sabotaging yourself there. You clearly like Draco, and he clearly likes you too. Don’t ruin this by… you know, being you.”
Harry turns and finally sees Draco, and his face has this weird reaction between a wince and a smile. “Oh.” He puts away his wand and runs his hand through his hair. “Sorry for, uh, causing a commotion,” he says to Rosmerta.
Harry sighs and smiles. That question is the reason why he likes to have this one tattoo hidden. “I don’t hate snakes, you know. This one actually based on a boa constrictor I met as a child and that probably was kinder to me than any other human being in my life at that time. The fact that it’s associated with Voldemort and dark magic in general doesn’t mean the animals in themselves are bad. This is sort of a reminder to stay open-minded.”
Draco gets up and shakes his head. “No, that was all. Thank you, I won’t take up more of your time.”
Harry shrugs his jacket on the chair and starts searching the deck. He has an approximate idea of where he put it, but in the dark, it’s not easy to find.
“Good. Thank you.” She looks toward the library next to her desk, as if considering her next words. “You know, that fucked him up quite a lot. Dying, I mean, and learning that he was always supposed to,” she adds, turning back to Draco. “Well, his whole childhood probably fucked him up – I know it fucked
He smiles at them, and they smile back, but he doesn’t like the pity he sees in the look they exchange briefly.
“It’s alright. It’s all in the past, now. And can you promise not to tell anyone?” he asks, finally turning to him. He’s really glad he isn’t wearing his glasses. “No one knows, and I’d rather keep it that way.”
“I know your social education is lacking, Potter, but did really no one teach you how presents work?”
When he comes back, Potter has finished his piece of toast and is now holding a steaming mug in both of his hands.
Amantha’s eyes are throwing daggers at him, so he whispers to her, as they walk into the stadium: “Hey, don’t be mad, I left you with the quiet one.”
Draco was starting to see the appeal of farm life. Remus and Harry were clearly in their element out here, surrounded by nature and animals that they clearly loved and adored.
He dropped his bag on one of the sofas, extracting from it the fancy Whittard hot chocolate his mother always bought him, and a mug he had been given as a joke from Greg, on which was written ‘the princess has arrived’.
Then, not a week later, he and Cho start shagging, and eventually going out. I don’t know what happened between them, but it must have ended, because he’s been simpering pathetically at me all term.
He discovered the mazing muggle culture of band t shirts while in Europe, and came back to England with a suitcase full a band t shirts.
“Right here mate” Ron groaned from the other bed, and Harry could see a tuft of curly brown hair poking out of his duvet.
“I understand that this is a big request, and I would not ask if I did not feel I had to. As much as I know you hate the fame and influence you have, it is there nevertheless, and I must beg you to use it. Room assignments will be magically revealed at 9 pm, and I have placed you with Mr Malfoy. If you two can outwardly appear to bury the hatchet, and act civilly towards each other, then hopefully the year, and then the school will follow. Whilst I know this isn’t ideal given your history, I believe this could be cathartic for the two of you also. I have already spoken to Mr Malfoy and asked him not to openly express disdain or discontent for his roommate, and I must ask you to do the same. My wish is that soon you will discover that friendship is not outside the bounds of possibility, however civility is all that I need for this school to heal and move beyond the pain that hangs all around us.”
“Well, Ron and Hermione know, obviously. And Snape and Dumbledore used to, but they almost took that to the grave with them. And… you, now. But that’s it. And I don’t want anyone else to know. Ever. Some things must die with me.”
The other night with him, at the pub, left a strange taste in his mouth. Having drinks with Potter was an entirely wild thing on its own, but having a conversation with him that lasted more than one hour? Seeing where he lives? Hearing him talk about the past – about the present? That was more than he expected – more than he could handle, maybe.
“You’re very smart, Jordan, and very cunning, so you would make a good Slytherin,” he answers as he puts his hand on the boy’s shoulder. “But Ravenclaw or any other house would be lucky to have you.”
Draco has a hard time settling in. That Potter knew his birthday was a thing, getting a present from him another one, but
But Draco is still as impassible as ever as Harry guides him as fast as possible away from the dark spot, toward a safer part of the garden.
Draco pulls the mug to his chest and glares at him. Potter laughs as he drops the shoe to the floor and leans to kiss his temple.
“If you want me to. I mean, you can invite anyone you want, a friend, your mother, whoever. They’re yours. Just because I got them doesn’t mean you have to take me.”
Also, neither the internet nor the Harry Potter creature books could tell me how long an hippogriff lives.
“You fucking—” He hears Draco say behind him, right before the children underneath start yelling and clapping.
answer that question, especially when it’s a ministry employee asking. To his surprise, Draco laughs.
Holding Harry’s hand against his belly, Draco whispers back without turning: “Okay. You’ve done all you needed to do in London?”
Draco starts to expect the worst. Was Harry making this place more wonderful than it actually is? Is I actually on the verge of falling apart?
Draco has a head start, but Harry has a better broomstick, so their chances are about equal. Harry understands, thought, that he won’t be able to catch the snitch before Draco does, and his best chance is in placing himself right between them, blocking Draco’s path, who has to stop abruptly.
Draco arches an eyebrow to him. “Well, you better start believing again soon enough, because I’m going to crush your soul and your ego on that field.”
Maybe he shouldn’t have mentioned the dark spot and the dangerous plants. And Luna. Is this a concern for safety? Will Draco report about it? Maybe his friends are right and he
Harry joins Draco and puts his hand on his lower back. “Sorry about all that. Is this too much? If this is too much, you can leave, you know. I won’t blame you.”
“Is this…” Draco starts, not sure if it’s safe to continue. “Is this why you didn’t come back to Hogwarts, after the war?”
Draco turns and arches an eyebrow, worried he’s gone too far. “I thought parents were off limits?” he says, to make sure.
He waves at her awkwardly and starts walking toward Draco. “You could have just owled me, you know,” he says as he draws the chair facing him.
When the meal is over, Potter leaves the dining hall, followed by a herd of children like some quidditch flute player. In the corridor, he accios his broom, that comes flying from upstairs, and a handful of kids fight to have the honour to climb on the latest Nimbus. The winner are a very tenacious blond girl named Nina and a the tiniest black boy Draco has ever seen. Potter levitates his broom a few inches from the floor and the excited group goes out on the field, some of the kids even asking Draco some questions, to which he feels compelled to answer.
“You remember the ministry inspection today at nine?” He nods, and she continues. “I have a last minute meeting with parents, so can you welcome them and give them a tour while I finish? It shouldn’t take long.”
“Anyway,” Granger continues, “we all saw and lived a lot of things before we turned eighteen, you included, that no teenager should have to see or live. And if I believed this helped us turn into the adults we are today, I also think it could have fucked us up beyond recognition. And I’m very glad that Harry, even if he has his issues, is living a relatively sane adult life today. But it took him a very long time to get there. After the war, there was a point where I thought we wouldn’t get him back. Learning that he was meant to die basically obliterated all his plans for the future, because he didn’t see himself with a future anymore. That’s why he didn’t come back to Hogwarts, that’s why things ended with Ginny, that’s why he never became an Auror, and a lot of other things. Of course, I tell you that today, with the distance I now have from it, and it’s only my point of view. At the time, we were all too caught up in the moment to interpret anything. In a sense, Harry was very lucky to have Teddy. He focused all of his attention and hopes on him, and his determination to give him the home and family he didn’t have himself as a child is probably what saved him, in the long run.”
Draco looks up at the kids behind Harry, who turns too. A handful of children are flying haphazardly around the pitch, and half the balls are abandoned on the floor. In the middle of that, Ginny is hanging upside down, Debbie and Nina flying around her and shrieking with laughter. The kids not on brooms are standing or running in the bleachers, barely controlled by the adults present.
Potter? Listen to him? That would be a first. No, Draco will not talk to him about any of that. It’s his own problem and, as Padma confirmed, she shouldn’t even have told him about it. He will not meddle in Potter’s business.
“I’m messed up too. And I don’t have to explain you why, I guess, because you know exactly who I am and where I come from. And I can’t change that.”
Just as the countdown starts, he swears he sees the tiny head of Potter’s snake tattoo rise above the collar of his shirt, and Potter winks at him as he shoots up to the sky.
“Let’s go through the botanical garden,” he says, inviting Draco through a small waist-high gate. “We’ve been developing it since we moved here, and it’s still quite small, but slowly growing. Both professor Sprout and Neville have helped set it up and furnishing it, and they also still donate some of their time to teach the children about magical plants. None of what we have here is dangerous in any way, of course, we can’t risk anything around kids, but it’s a good introduction to magical herbology, plus tending to it is a great activity for kids, to canalise all of their energy, and it teaches them to care about other living things.”
“What?” Harry says before laughing nervously. “No, Draco isn’t my boyfriend, we’re just friends! I could never get someone like him, can’t you see?” he adds, hoping to put this conversation behind them as a joke.
’s top 10 most eligible bachelor’s list since the end of the war, if he’s embarrassed about that, he’s probably the only person alive in that case. But, fine,” she adds as she sees his look, “Your secret is safe with me, don’t worry. I won’t tell anyone.”
“Sorry for not telling you it was boring,” Potter laughs as he walks past him to grab a glass of water on the table. “I just thought you might make things more fun.” He hands him the glass.
“Oh, okay.” Harry feels both disappointed and relieved. He’s trying to review what he could have done wrong, and also to find a way to keep Draco here so he could try to extract the answer from him. Even if, at the same time, he doesn’t really want to stand under his wrath. “Hey, are you free on Saturday?” He asks, almost as a pretext. “I’m taking the kids to the Harpies’ game, and we always have spare tickets. Do you want to come?”
“Between us, and off the record? Harry should have been headmaster. But he didn’t want the job. So he agreed on doing the whole public figure thing, defending the interests of the institution in face of the ministry and the general wizarding population, even if he would rather not, and I took on the more administrative side of things, which always bore him anyway. In exchange, he gets to keep doing what he likes, which is hanging out with the kids, playing quidditch and telling us about his ideas. And he’s good at it, so it’s a win-win situation.”
“I don’t know, it just looks fancy, that’s all. And look at how you hold your glass! I look like a regular drunkard next to you.”
“I know you’re not on that level anymore, but how do you feel about a good old Slytherin versus Gryffindor?”
Harry doesn’t really know how to act around Draco, and he certainly doesn’t want to show it. Sure, they’ve been on friendly-ish terms for years, but that doesn’t mean that they ever willingly spent any time together. Especially alone with each other.
He then takes an inspiration and says: “I just wanted to apologize. I lashed out at you last week, and you didn’t deserve it, so I’m sorry for that. I guess,” he adds with a smile: “that, after all these years and despites my best wishes, you still get on my nerves.”
“Beats anything else I’ve ever done.” Potter’s tone is sharp and, from it, Draco half expects him to draw his wand and challenge him to a duel. “And you know what? I’m proud of what we’ve done, and my life has more meaning than it ever did. Can you say the same about yours?”
“Ah. I can see how being gay at a posh private boy’s school may have put a bit of a limit on exploring. Especially given how painfully straight your friends are.” Harry says, and Draco huffs a laugh, tension dissipating from him.
“Alright there, gin?” Harry said, nodding at her as he passed and opened the neighbouring barn to let the cows out.
“it’s okay, Harry. Whatever you need to feel better. I understand” Draco said, and he found he really did understand. He imagines himself sharing a bed with Pansy, and knows it’s the same thing.
“oh fuck and I’ve made it awkward now haven’t I. shit. Shit!” complained Draco, until he felt a hand on his.
This avoidance didn’t mean that Draco didn’t want to date; didn’t yearn to feel loved and appreciated, and appreciate romance the way all his books described it. To have someone see him as more lovely than a summers day. To be the sun to someone’s east.
And he hadn’t expected Harry to look so fit. They had both reeked of sweat, but Harry’s eyes were so bright and his shorts were so short and even though he had been coming from the gym he could just as easily been coming from a one-night stand for how his hair looked.
“Draco, oh Draco I’m sorry, I’m so, so fucking sorry” he says, over and over and over again. I tilt my face to the ceiling, blinking back tears.
He felt the bed beside him dip, and a hand grip his. He smelt the awful ethanol of muggle liquor, and knew it must be Draco. Luna had told him how Draco had drunk when Harry was injured, but Harry didn’t know how to talk to Draco about it without shattering the tentative thing that was between them. He heard Draco heave a sigh and then gently slurred French filled his ears, fumbled words of comfort from someone who clearly didn’t know what to say, but Harry was touched that Draco was trying. Harry started at Draco’s declaration of love, but knew at the way the blond went tense beside him that not only was it genuine, but that it had also been accidental, so Harry spared Draco the embarrassment, and continued to cry in the darkness.
Sirius looked surprised, which Draco hadn’t been expecting, and he suddenly doubted the offer for him to take the cottage.
Theo said imperiously, before reaching into his bag and withdrawing a bottle of Glenfiddich that Draco knew to cost upwards of £400. At least he would be getting drunk on the best money could buy. Of course, as Lucius would say, and Malfoy should do nothing less.
“This is on the republic” was all he said, wincing as it came out cold rather than explanatory. He really was fucking awful at making friends. No wonder he only had about 4 at school in a year of about 200.
They then enjoyed high tea at One Aldwych, which was a delightful experience. Despite his copious amounts of money, Harry’s upbringing imbued him with forced frugality, and it felt really nice to spend money on himself for once. He was overtly polite to all the staff, well aware that he and Pansy probably came off as spoilt children of foreign dignitaries or some such, and he did not want to fall into that stereotype. Pansy was surprisingly good company; funny, witty and scathing, but in a strangely respectful way. She had come a long way in the short months since the war, and it warmed Harry’s heart to see the improvement.
Draco heard Theo groan from beside him, and he looked to the stage, where two boys were making their way up the stairs on one side. One was… very ginger. Very ginger, very tall and very freckly. Despite all this, he still managed to be attractive, a fact Draco found very upsetting. The ginger had nothing on the second boy, however.
The week between Christmas and new years was somewhat calm and relaxed, but characterised by Hermione and Harry sneaking off downstairs, heads bent together and furiously discussing some sort of spell work.
“sleep now, Pans. We’ll sort it all out in the morning” whispered Harry, turning onto his back and pulling Draco to him, one arm still wrapped around Pansy’s shoulders.
Harry went for a run to calm down, before apparating to the burrow and spending the whole day baking with Molly. Not ready to go back home yet, he stayed as late as he could, before strapping a slumbering Teddy to his chest and apparating back to London. He wandered the dark deserted streets for hours, before using his wizarding privileges and apparating into Regent’s park, which was locked for the night. He refreshed the warming charms he had cast over Teddy, nestled against his chest in the baby carrier. He wandered around, loving the glow of the streetlamps over the near-skeletal trees. Pushing down the feeling of cowardice, when he finally decided to return to Grimmauld, he apparated straight into his bedroom, conjuring a cot for Teddy so he didn’t have to face Draco. He was so disappointed that Draco had so quickly reverted to how he had been at Hogwarts. Harry felt a bitter taste in his mouth thinking about how much he had hoped Draco had really changed.
lmk what you think of the story so far? coming to the end of pre-written chapters so updates will probably get slower soon, but I'll do my best
Harry thought he had fallen a little bit in love with Narcissa. Draco was so lucky to have a mum like that.
“Honestly, Harry. I did not expect this level of immaturity from you. We keep talking about communication.” Hermione interjected.
For someone who had been at an English boarding school since age eleven, harry was unsure how Seamus managed to be so Irish. ‘Sure, it’ll be grand’ felt like a line from Father Ted. Harry loved it though- Seamus’ unabashed foreignness helped him feel more at ease with his own.
“I mean, I don’t have to if you don’t want me to anymore” Draco said, looking at his fingers twisting in his lap.
A forceful shout of “FUCK” from Malfoy, standing before the board startled Ron out of his reverie dreaming of the bacon waiting for him in the Great Hall.
“Hey Harry” he replied, voice embarrassingly scratchy. He was so glad no one else was here. He turned back to his laptop, trying to focus on the last few paragraphs of the essay he had been writing since 5 pm that afternoon when he heard heavy footfalls and looked up again to see Harry bounding over to him.
McGonagall surveyed the teenagers gathered in front of her, all with backpacks on, most looking half asleep and some looking really quite terrified. As a precaution, she had cast tracking charms on all of the tents in case of an emergency. She smiled, and prayed this idea wouldn’t turn out to be a terrible one.
The door to their ensuite was shut, with plain blue towels hanging on the hook on the back of it. Harry went to the desk on Ron’s side of the room and picked up the chair, bringing it over to his own desk, and motioning at Draco to sit, before he rifled through his backpack and found his own French sheet and the Charlie and Lola pencil case that Draco had come to love.
The four of them ate breakfast in amicable silence, everyone too tired or hungry or hungover to maintain conversation. “I don’t know when you intend to leave, but the bedroom is yours for as long as you want it. I was thinking I would take Draco to the cinema today, and you are both more than welcome to join. We could get lunch and make a day of it. Teddy is off to the Weasley’s.”
“That was surprisingly good advice, Draco” Sirius said, smiling at him. Draco blushed, so unused to praise from a father-like figure. Lucius had never once said anything like that. Draco was hoping that he might get some praise on his a-level results when they came, but he knew he was being unrealistic.
“Good. So, I guess you wanted to see the documents about the protection of the place? I already have them out.”
Hermione laughs briefly. “Yes, I guess. But, mostly, very Harry. Apart from broomsticks and a few personal trinkets, he has never been really interested in material possessions. He has a huge house he barely ever uses and mostly serves as a hotel for visiting friends in need, he gives away his old broomsticks to friends or Hogwarts students, and he even offered to give Ron and I his own house when we were looking for a place to live – we refused, obviously, it was enough he paid for the wedding—”
“They do. But I don’t exactly schedule birthday parties.” He rolls his eyes. “Don’t give me the pity look, Potter, I celebrated with my mother at lunch. You’re not doing the white knight rescue of my day you think you’re doing.”
Both Ron and Hermione immediately still. Harry keeps his head lowered over his plate, though he’s not eating anymore.
Harry snorts. That’s the least he could say. But dwelling on their Hogwarts hobbies isn’t part of tonight’s plans.
Potter’s smile falters briefly, only for a second. He takes a step back, and Draco’s hand fall down. He regrets not pulling him in.
Harry spends the next few minutes herding his bunch of kids to their seats, and manages to stop Nina from falling over the railing as she looks at the field – twice. He finally settles in between Matty, who won’t let go of his hand, and Draco.
Draco seems taken aback by the question. “I… I don’t know,” he stutters. “I’m just glad I have a respectable job.”
It truly does. It’s a vast hall with glass ceiling, filled with plants and organized in a way that makes it look like a series of small enough conversation corners, and not a vast, empty room.
“How are you doing? Was the meeting alright?” What did they discuss? Did Draco complain about how Harry dragged him out last time?
Not that he’s telling lies or anything like that. He is insanely proud of what they’ve built here, knows everything there is to know about the place and worked very hard to insure the children’s security and their well-being. He also loves to show what they’ve done and achieved to other people and, since his friends grew bored of that a long time ago, he’s somehow glad to have a new audience to introduce to the wonders of the Tonks and Lupin school and orphanage.
“Guys, this is Dora and Charlotte, and they’re thinking about putting their daughter Carla, who is seven, in this school. Could you please tell them a bit about your days, so they know what they can expect for Carla?”
Somehow, the conversation started being easier once they started having sex. Harry still doesn’t know where they stand exactly, but at least it’s somewhere beyond the polite, professional realm. In a place where they can have sex and the fries, or the other way around, where they can joke and kiss naked skin, talk about the mundane events of their week and put shivers on each other’s skin with their fingertips.
“Oh, right, that was clear for you. Well, some of these kids don’t know where they come from, and they all have questions about that. I – we – try to teach them that each house has its own qualities, and sometimes we tell them about this or that trait they have that could make them fit in one or the other. Anyway, in the end, they’re gonna choose it themselves.”
Draco looks down and sees a black shirt with “Bikini Kill” written on it in faded white. It does look clean, if crudely folded and rudely worded. He puts it on.
The room is fuller than the last time they were there, and Draco can hear laughs and recollections of today’s game already. Potter walks straight toward the same table they were last time, which appears to be empty. Is it luck, or is it Potter’s own table? He waves at some people sitting here and there, even stopping a couple of times to exchange a few words about the match.
Draco nods as he rubs his eyes with his hand, then gets up on the other side of the bed. He looks around him, suddenly self-conscious about standing naked in front of Potter. Behind him, he hears the crunch of toast and Potter saying, his mouth half-full: “Here, I put your clothes over there this morning, if that’s what you’re looking for. Catch.”
“Well, that’s a very good word, and perfectly used. Go on, kid, stop bothering Draco and go to the bathroom with everyone else. Matty! No lingering! Don’t touch the leaflets!” He sigh and mutters “for fuck’s sake” as he walks toward a tiny boy with dark curly hair who’s holding a handful of leaflets about the school from a nearby table.
didn’t want people to know, because, well, I’m not like you, or your friends, or the people around you – and by that I mean that you’ve made a life for yourself, and you’re successful in what you do, and you probably have a lot going on without me nagging you to watch over kids with me, and I didn’t think you’d want my interference in your life, when I’m just… well, I’m just me. I prefer hanging out with kids than adults because that’s less stressful, I’m messy, I’m too scared to live on a house on my own, I didn’t even finish Hogwarts, and I’m not a wordly Londoner who knows hip places and any interesting thing that may be going on. I’m not like you.” The light in the stairwell goes out, and Harry waves his arms over his head to get it back. “I’m messed up, and I will probably always be. And, well, since you never suggested we made plans, or involved me in your life in any way, I just assumed you didn’t want that. Me. And maybe I was wrong? I don’t know. I’m often wrong.” He sighs. “Anyway. I said I wouldn’t be long, so I’m gonna stop rambling. The point is, I like you. And I don’t want to hide it.” He raises his arm, showing the snake curled around his naked wrist. “I’m done hiding. And, well, I’m leaving tomorrow to Norway with Teddy, but I’ll be back in a week, so… if you want to talk, or anything, I will be at the Three Broomsticks next Thursday, from five thirty. If you don’t come, I’ll stop bothering you for good. And if you come…” he shrugs with a small smile. “Well, we’ll take it from there, I guess?”
Padma shakes her head. “I don’t think he will ever not care about the place. He built it from his own hands. It’s his baby, more than all of the kids that we have here. He is passionate about it, I will not take that from him, and wants the best for it. I believe that. He also assured me, with proof, that, were he to die, his will states the orphanage would get most of his possessions. And we know we have other funding options to explore, like the ministry, or even a partnership with Hogwarts.” She smiles. “I don’t want it to happen, but we would find a way. We have competent people working here.”
But as Draco says nothing, just staring, for a few seconds, Harry says: “Look, we have our first cucumbers. And see, over there. The tomatoes are already growing. And the courgettes are huge. And I can’t wait to see the—”
He’s proud of his tattoos, he loves them, and they bring him comfort and happiness. But explaining them to people always takes a toll out of him, because most of them weren’t born out of happiness, and most people don’t understand why he needed to do that.
Harry doesn’t know how Zabini is at all, but, if Draco is to be believed, the answer is: unreliable.
Harry gestures for Charlotte to sit too, and quickly tries to reorient the conversation towards more interesting topics for the prospective parents.
Harry turns to Draco, whose lips are still in a thin line. He holds the hand that isn’t wrapped around the snitch. “No hard feelings, Draco. You played well.”
She’s already shuffling parchment as he walks himself to the door. As it closes behind him, he thinks that Harry and him seem to have more in common than he actually thought.
Draco shrugs. “I don’t think about it, I guess. I do enjoy it, but I don’t look for it, you know what I mean?”
They all wave at him as he disappears into the hall, wondering if maybe he should wear a jacket for meeting the ministry worker in a more serious outfit. He’s about to go towards the stairs when a voice calls behind him.
“Is it Granger who put these ideas in your head, or did you put them in hers?” Draco is still smiling as he takes a sip.
“Yes, they have some cooking classes, but, like the garden, it’s more of a teachable moment ? You know, for them to learn to care for others and to do things with their hands? And they’re not forced if they don’t want to? And they don’t cook the meals for everyone. Just, you know, classes.”
Draco stops in his tracks. Oh shit. Doesn’t he like birthdays? Maybe Harry shouldn’t have brought that up.
“Come on, Harry,” she sighs. “You’ve been here for almost two days, this is only the second meal we’re taking together, and—” she continues, as he opens his mouth to retort, “We know Neville is staying at your place and he says he’s barely seen you and your bed is still unmade. So, where have you been? Are you ok?”
Harry raises his glass in silence, and Draco echoes his move. For a while, they only eat and drink, avoiding staring at each other. The humming of background conversations and clinking of glasses and plates echoes between them. Draco eventually turns to him and smiles.
Draco feels a bit ashamed of himself for trying to put Potter in a bad position. He doesn’t even really know why he did it; he knows that times were indeed very different, and he is the living proof that people can change. It’s as if he’s intent on proving, like all those years ago, that Potter is a fraud who doesn’t deserve to be admired. Maybe it’s because he has a hard time admitting to himself that he actually admires Potter – not because of his boy-who-lived bullshit, but for creating this orphanage and school that has done so much good in the after-war wizarding world; for becoming something else than what he was expected to be.
Draco doesn’t know where Potter is dragging him, but they’re stopped on the way by a lot of people who want a word with the Boy Who Lived. He indulges them all, though keeps it quick by pretending “urgent matters” expect him.
“But…” Draco starts regaining control of his brain. Is Potter really emptying all of his vault into this orphanage? Is he that rich? Does he have any idea on how to manage money? “But what happens if – Merlin forbids – he dies, or doesn’t want to give his money to this place anymore?”
Harry is as dishevelled as ever when they get back to the field, and Draco hopes Potter didn’t lie to him when he said his hair was perfect earlier, right before they left the locker room..
“I’ll let him know. He told me you two were becoming quite good friends? You’re going to a quidditch match together this weekend, right?”
Draco has a hard time believing all of that, even if he’s the first to acknowledge that time can actually change someone, and this is partly the reason he’s taken this assignment from his department: to find out who Potter has become.
But, no matter what Draco tells himself about not wanting to be anyone’s dirty little secret, every time he sees Potter’s smile, or hears his voice, he thinks “just one last time.” And how many last times has it been, now?
Potter stares at him a bit, a half smile on his lips, then finishes his drink in one gulp. “Should we go?”
Draco internally cringes at how he sees his phrasing could have been understood that way. “No! I believe you. I do. This is wild, okay, but I believe you.” This time, he’s the one who squeezes Harry’s hand. “I just don’t understand how my mother is involved in any of that.” Did his mother kill Potter?
“I won’t tell anyone, okay? I promise. I swear… on my mother’s life. No one else will know. But… can you tell me? I just… you… fucking hell, Harry, you
Harry shrugs. “We have a lot of generous private donors. I told you, we’ve received a lot of overwhelming support, form the start, and that’s what has helped us expand. People caring about what we do has helped us do better at what we care about, you know?”
“I’ve never heard of a tattoo that can move around your body,” Draco says, putting his fingers back on it.
“We’re just what, Potter?” His arms are still crossed in front of him, and all trace of his half-smile is gone.
Oh Merlin, Padma is gonna kill him later. He will be the one who has to pay the rounds of butterbeer.
“Okay, then. Come one, lunch’s on the house,” Harry says as he gets up, “and then you can attend the most anticipated quidditch game of the year before we head up.”
Of course, Draco knows of the place. The Tonks and Lupin school and orphanage has been the talk of the wizarding world since it was founded in Hogsmeade about a decade ago. How Harry and Andromeda had founded the place to raise the war orphans who couldn’t be taken in by relatives, how it had gradually grown to welcome any children that needed it, then developed into a school for wizard kids who weren’t always orphans, and not yet of age for Hogwarts. As the number of children had expanded, so had the team and the building. What was once a family business in a tiny Hogsmeade house was now a well run institution with consequent staff and a luminous building on the edge of town with enough fields around to have ten times the current number of children running around. Though it was known that Potter was at the origin of the project, he had declined the role of headmaster when the place grew bigger, preferring, in his own words, to “leave the role to someone actually competent for that.”
“Sure, he’s dated before, a bit, but always as if he was looking for something specific and then got disappointed when he didn’t find it. But you made him happy, even if he was too dumb to tell you – or maybe even to tell himself.”
He pushes him toward the rest of the group as he wrestles the leaflets out of his grasp. He’s still holding them as he walks back to Draco.
His mother, saving Harry Potter. The most surprising thing about this is that it isn’t the most surprising thing he’s heard tonight.
“Draco. Can we… not talk about this anymore? It’s not exactly a fun time of my life, and I… can we just stop? It had to be done, and I did it, and I’m still here to tell the tale, and that’s all there is to know about it.”
“Well, first, Demelza had the quaffle,” Matty answers, “but she was hit by a bludger, like, on her arm, so she dropped it, but then it was caught by…”
“I just want to give the other team a chance to not lose horribly. Besides, I have an old feud to settle.” He points to Draco behind his shoulder.
Draco shoots him a glance without stopping his spellwork. Harry Potter, the Saviour, the Chosen One, who had just killed Voldemort, depressed? But Potter doesn’t notice him and continues.
Draco chuckles, and Harry feels like it’s the first time that sound hasn’t been mockingly directed at him. He smiles back.
Draco is sitting on the bed when Harry comes back. He’s only wearing his dirty t-shirt and his underwear, and the hair tie is gone.
“You know what, today is your birthday, so I’ll let you jab at me all you want. Consider it my present.”
Ginny does a quick survey of the stadium, then says: “It’s alright, we’ll do Gryffindor and Hufflepufff versus Slytherin and Ravenclaw.”
“A bit, maybe. But not really. It just… I just thought it was more important that I stayed with Teddy ad Andromeda that year, and that I’d go back after, when things would be easier. And then we had started the orphanage, and I thought I would go back the year after, when it was done… and I kept pushing it back and, well, I didn’t go back at all, in the end.” Harry sits up and pushes his hair back from his face. “I guess that’s it, now, I can say that I will never finish Hogwarts. I don’t need it, anyway, to do what I do.”
“Thanks,” Potter smiles. He turns to the mirror, pretending to arrange his hair which falls back the exact same way, and risks a quick glance toward Draco’s reflexion. “Can I… can I come around later? When it’s over, I mean. It will probably finish late, though, so you will probably be asleep, it will be better if I go back to my place, I guess—”
Draco is starting to feel unnerved from all the opposition Harry is giving him. “The drinks will still be there in an hour. Will you take off that fucking shirt?”
He knows this was not his original plan with Draco, but he left a word with Rosmerta for him to join them, hoping Draco might enjoy this too.
Potter gets up, still smiling at him, and waves at Rosmerta, who is buried in orders. She nods at him with a smile, shooing him away.
“There are always at least two other adults present with him, and every creature and animal he show has to be approved by both our staff and the Hogwarts staff. Children are also not allowed to touch and it’s merely and observation, you know, we see it, like the garden, as an introduction to what expects them at Hogwarts. The important thing is that the children get familiar with the magical world, even if they don’t understand it. To prepare them, you now? But in a fun way. Because they’re kids. They deserve to have fun. That’s what childhood is supposed to be all about, after all, no?”
Potter huffs a laugh, and his fingers glide down Draco’s arm, until they can intertwine with his. “Come on, then.” He starts dragging him toward the school, half-stumbling, half running. Draco can only follow him mechanically.
She stares at him a bit more before answering. “Yes. It’s true.” After another silence, she asks: “What are you going to do with that information?”
Harry catches Draco’s wrist with his hand and, despite Draco’s reluctance, he raises it up. “I know. And I don’t care, Draco.” Still holding Draco’s gaze, he kisses his faded mark. “I don’t care.” He kisses it again. “This isn’t who you are anymore. Just like this—” he takes Draco’s fingers to his own forehead, tracing the lightning bolt he knows all too well “— isn’t who I am anymore.” Draco frees his hand and takes off Harry’s glasses, making the world blurry for him again. Harry lowers downs, stopping only a breath away from Draco’s open mouth. “I won’t let us be defined by the marks someone else put on us,” he growls before kissing him furiously.
Draco’s smirk doesn’t forebode anything good. Harry loves it. Draco takes a step closer, and Harry is very glad they’re hidden inside the locker room at that moment.
Harry’s heart is beating fast again, and this time it has nothing to do with any type of physical effort. “I don’t know!” he yells-whisper. “I don’t know what we are! I thought we were friends? Casual? You obviously can’t be my boyfriend, you—”
“Teddy has got his Hogsmeade outing tomorrow, so I told him I’ll take him for ice cream after lunch, but I guess I’m more excited about that than he is. He would probably rather hang out with his friends than with an old man like me.”
“But he’s our best tour guide. He know everything there is to know about this place, and he has more passion for it than any of us there. I mean, we all love it and would do anything to make it succeed, but he’s the founder, you know?”
There’s a silence, then Draco rolls over to face him. His left hand rests on Harry’s hip and, with his right, he pushes back the hair from Harry’s forehead.
should – tone down our assumptions about each other and have a real conversation, right? Because I… um… I enjoy your company too.”
“Hey, I do other things!” Harry protests, but he can see Draco’s smile as they take place at their usual table. “But hey, if you’re around at that time, I’m having a birthday party at my house in London on the 31
Potter takes his hand on his knee and squeezes it. “Happy birthday, Draco,” he says with a wild smile.
Draco sighs. “I’m not gonna leave. Well, except if someone challenges me to a duel, maybe. I wouldn’t want to duel on your birthday.” He smiles and briefly puts his hand on Harry’s cheek.
Above the bed, Draco notices a small, clearly older picture. In it, a waving young couple holds a tiny, black-haired, scarless baby. Draco steps back, feeling like he intruded too far on Potter’s intimacy, and almost stumbles into the oddly placed bed. He swears and walks back to the desk, which seems a safer place. Standing there, he just takes in all of the pictures of friends, kids of all shapes and ages, people he knows and people he’s never met, all scattered on or under colourful childish drawings.
Draco seems unmoved by this question, but he briefly frowns. “I don’t know. I…” He sighs, almost as if defeated.
Surprisingly, he is finding out that he actually enjoys Draco’s company. He has grown off his hatred a long time ago, but he never thought the two of them could actually become friends. And yet, he comes to enjoy the time spent with him more and more. He is smart, funny sometimes, unpredictable and yet familiar. And, in a way, hanging out with him is a bit like hanging out with kids, though for opposite reasons: when being with kids feels freeing because they have no idea who he is, being with Draco feels freeing because he knows exactly who Harry is. It is, in a sense, refreshing.
He knows the generic story, of course, like anyone else – he supposes –, but hearing it from Draco himself is different. How he ended Hogwarts with top grades, how he had to start at the bottom of the ladder anyway, how it probably took him longer than anyone else, and how his hard work and precise spellcasting eventually paid off, leading him to a more than decent position.
“Where does your money comes from? You employ a lot of people, without counting all of the investments, like the new building, and ministry funding is minimal, to say the least. So, how do you finance everything?”
Harry is stopped from arguing by a magnificent goal by the Harpies, causing the whole stadium, himself included, to erupt in a cheer.
“I didn’t mean it that way,” Draco says, putting down his glass. “It’s just, I’ve heard that same speech in her mouth about fifteen million times.”
Without thinking, Draco holds out his arm and catches Harry’s hand. “Can’t you stay?” he mumbles, still half asleep. “It’s Sunday.”
There is indeed a strong smell coming from Potter, but Draco had barely noticed it until now, hidden by the high-pitched voices of the children and the dishevelled general appearance of Harry.
“Yes. Teddy gave him a purpose when he didn’t have any. And in the past decade, he’s accomplished amazing things, and I believe that he is reasonably happy in his life. But, even if Teddy isn’t his sole focus anymore and he’s got a lot of things going on, the one thing Harry hasn’t gotten back to doing since the war is building a life for himself. He lives in a dorm room at his school, he spends all of his waking time with kids or working or helping anyone who asks him, and all of his money on the school or on his friends projects. And he’s a great friend, a devoted godfather and an amazing teacher, I’m not belittling anything he does. But, apart from his broomsticks – and maybe his tattoos, but that’s an entirely different story –, I haven’t seen him get excited about anything for himself for years. Until you.”
Lunch with Potter is less dreadful than Draco had feared, mostly thanks to the fact that they get interrupted every thirty seconds by some kid wanting to ask something to Harry about quidditch, or tell them about something they did this morning, or show him something they found or, in one occasion, just wants to hug him. Potter kindly obliges every single time, without showing any sign of annoyance or tiredness. He smiles at each kid, is amazed but each rock or leaf they show him, or by how good they did in spelling, or shows real excitement about their potential involvement in the upcoming match. The worst of all that isn’t the patience he shows or his genuine interest in children’s trivial talks, it’s the fact that those kids all seem to adore him. Sure, Draco knows that Potter is one of the most beloved wizards in the magic world, with all his defeating you-know-who thing, but the Boy Who Lived always had his detractors and haters, and never would have Draco thought that he could spark that kind of unanimous loving. Did he bewitch these children, or is he just, as the rumour says, really good with them? Sadly, from what Draco is seeing, the latter is probably true. He is sure that himself would have lost patience by the third child interrupting his meal.
Some adults are gathering children to bring them back to school, others are still discussing, and Draco is apparently engaged in a pretty intense debate with Nina.
“I’m gonna start to believe you really don’t have any friends,” Potter says as he climbs the stairs behind Draco.
“So you just…” Draco can’t even finish the sentence. He can’t imagine himself at seventeen, or even now, willingly walking to his death. Would he be able to do that? Would he have been?
Harry squeezes him briefly. “You know, a classic Slytherin versus Gryffindor. To reminisce the good old days.”
Harry winces. “You’re right. I’ll take them off.” He leans to untie them, then takes off his socks as well. “This will have to do.”
Did that fucker just squeeze his hand? Did he really, just after telling him, in the most distanced tone, that he died because that was the only way to kill Voldemort, squeeze Draco’s hand to
“So you went to fight Voldemort, and he killed you?” he asks, trying to piece things together with the crumbs Harry is giving him.
She rolls her eyes and sighs. “Merlin. You better hope Padma doesn’t see any of this. Fuck, you reek, don’t come any closer. Go take a shower yourself, I’ll handle the filthy gang. Oh, hi, Draco. Here for the inspection, right?”
“Yeah, but we’ve got the orphans who live at Hogwarts during the year coming back, plus we’re organizing some summer camps. We’ve got a quidditch training camp in collaboration with the Harpies! And another one focusing on magical plants. Neville said he’s got some fine specimen he brought back from the Sahara. Plus, you know, day trips to the beach or to London, plus the usual activities. Summer are actually more exhausting for us than the school year, where everything is already calibrated around class.”
The hit of fresh air is the most welcome once they step out, but only for a couple of seconds, because after he’s shivering. The May nights are still pretty cold, despite the sun never quite setting down behind the horizon. That’s the thing that was always the hardest for him to get used to, in Scotland. In summer, the nights aren’t quite real, and in winter, they are far too real.
“Come on, you hero,” says Ginny as she puts an arm around his shoulders. “Help me bring all those broomsticks and balls back to the locker room.”
Charlotte, slightly less stressed after talking to the kids, answers very politely while Harry tries to calm a still overly excited Nina.
“Harry!” sounds a voice as they approach the bathroom. “Were you the one who brought them back in this state?”
Draco pushes him back. He can’t be like that. “How are you not angry?” Because himself is angry. Very angry. At Voldemort, at the whole wizarding world, at Dumbledore, at anyone who put Harry in that position, and even at Harry for acting it was all normal.
Harry shrugs, feeling suddenly stupid, and diverts his eyes. “I didn’t think people would care about what I did if it didn’t involve killing Voldemort or defeating the dark arts. I know,” he adds as he turns back toward Draco, “that some people were disappointed that this was what I chose to do. They thought I should be defeating evil or get involved in politics or whatever.
Harry laughs. He was a bit afraid Draco wouldn’t come, considering how long he took to answer his owl, but seeing him here is a relief. It means Harry didn’t mess up everything.
“It’s not that crazy anymore,” says Harry on a defensive tone, heated as usual by the dismissive comments on his friends’ publication. “Sure, there are still articles about the two-legged Glaridon or whatever, but they also have pretty good political and societal pieces. Much more accurate than what
Harry turns back to him, and there’s the first hint of emotion in his voice since the beginning of this conversation. “You don’t believe me, do you?”
“Yeah, I guess that was the one good thing to come out of it. Well, one of the good things, with Voldemort’s defeat, anyway.” Harry sighs and put a hand through his hair. “Well, let’s be honest, I hate to admit it but, somehow, I feel like we needed this war to… reset things, in a way.’ He buries his head in his hands. “That’s a horrible things to say. Sorry. So many people suffered from it. So many people died.”
His fingers are about to slip away from Draco’s skin when he finds the strength to catch them with his other hand and assert: “No.”
The snake, wrapped around his wrist since he fell asleep, slithers back up his arm until it disappears under his shirt. Draco’s eyes must be questioning, because Harry says:
Draco must feel his reluctance, because he doesn’t press the subject. Instead, he comes snuggle closer to Harry and runs his hand over his chest and shoulder.
He would have loved to give some compliments on the garden, how instructive it seems to be and how pretty it is, but, first of all, Potter is talking all the time, barely letting him put a word in and, second of all, the passion on his face as he explains everything fascinates Draco to the point of making him forget his words. People have always listened to Potter, and Draco 100% understands why. He knows how to captivate an audience, and has a form of charisma that forces attention.
He sees Draco’s eyes going down on his body, and himself looks down at his knees. His jeans are good for a nice wash. He winces.
“Look, I’m not gonna beat around the bush. I like you. And I don’t care if anybody else knows. Hell, most people already know, apparently? And I don’t give a fuck about that. I don’t give a fuck about your past either, I told you that before. I like you, with the good and the bad and the screw ups. Your past doesn’t get to define who you are today. I don’t want my past to define me, so I think it’s only fair that I apply the same standards to other people. You’re not my dirty little secret. You never were. I want you to know that, even if… even if you don’t like me. I like you. And I’ve liked you since the first time we’ve slept together. I didn’t use you. I just thought…” He puts his hand through his hair – talking under Draco’s silence and scrutiny is harder than he thought it would be. “I just thought
“Sure,” answers Harry as he raises his head over Nina, relieved that Padma doesn’t seem in any type of bad mood towards him. “I just have this quidditch match to handle after lunch, but then I’m free. Will I need to do, or bring something?” he asks as he turns to Draco.
“Those will go to the trash, I guess.” He sniffs them. “Yep, they also smell. Do you mind waiting a bit more? I have to check the gang indeed washed its hands and take a shower to get rid of that smell. You can come with me, if you want, to avoid getting attacked by those gremlins again.” He waves Draco to follow him, then stops and turns back. “Not in the shower, obviously. I meant upstairs.”
“Harry asked me to give you this when I saw you. He said he’s been trying to reach you, but that you wouldn’t answer neither his owls nor his floo messages, so this was the only way he thought to get your things back to you. He also told me to tell you there’s a note in it, but that you don’t have to read it if you don’t want to.”
“There is no evil house,” Potter concludes. “And any house you end up in will be the one that suits you the best and it will feel like your second home.”
Draco is a bit surprised that Potter didn’t use the situation to boast about his victory over Draco, but he isn’t going to complain.
He turns to him and snuggles his nose into Draco’s neck, planting a kiss there. He feels Draco’s arms closing against his back. Eyes closed, he answers:
Draco releases his hand and flexes his fingers. Next to Potter, he feels overdressed in his suit, and yet he knows that it is Potter who is actually underdressed. He just has that look about him that makes him look good in whatever he wears.
Andromeda laughs and her hands drop from Draco’s shoulders. “Just saying you’ve been very selfish about your boy there.”
, you should come, if you want. It’s just a small gathering with friends, there are usually around twenty of us depending on everyone’s plans, so it’s nothing big.”
Harry turns a sad smile towards him. “Well, it was a different time, wasn’t it? Also, I was a competitive Gryffindor who wanted to beat you in quidditch,” he finishes on a lighter tone.
“And here we have a simple vegetable garden, you know, for daily food. Right now we have the first courgettes, and some peas, a few radishes – though they didn’t grow very well this year, don’t know why –, and tomatoes are starting to appear even if they are still very small and green. The kids also help with that, they love eating things that they’ve helped grow, it’s a great way to make them eat vegetables, plus, like the magical garden, it’s a great activity for them. If you stay for lunch, I think we’ll have some spinach we harvested yesterday.”
“Impressive, indeed.” He seems pensive for a few seconds, then asks: “But why a snake? I would have taken you for more of a roaring lion person.”
“Bathroom’s that way, if you need to,” Potter says, pointing a door with a toast already in his hand.
Harry squeezes his hand and winks at him. “I’ll accept that as a compliment. Always a pleasure playing against you, Draco.”
Voices of children echo through the dining hall as he gets in, and he waves at the few adults supervising the room. He’s barely grabbed a coffee when a tiny pair of hands catch his – other – wrist.
“You okay?” says Potter behind him, almost making him jump. “Sorry, I did as quick as I could but this stench was hard to get rid off. Sadly, there’s no spell for that, you have to do it the good old fashioned muggle way.”
Draco was a bit nervous about coming back to the school and orphanage and running into Potter after how things ended last time but, apparently, he shouldn’t have been.
“Harry, how long does a hippogriff live? You said you knew one who was twenty years-old, but Dan doesn’t believe me.”
“Evening, Harry,” says Rosmerta barely a few seconds after Draco sat in front of him. “So, what did you do again?” She sets the butterbeers in front of them.
Draco turns and sees Potter holding the door open as a bunch of children walk in in front of him. He smiles brightly at Draco as he notices him, but his attention is quickly diverted.
She disappears, and Harry is left on his own to entertain Draco. He raises his glass, determined to finish it as quickly as possible so Draco can be relieved of this social obligation and go back home, in London, where no one will insult him to his face.
Draco feels weird at this reversal of places, each sitting in each other’s usual spot. He tries to stay as composed as usual, though. He’s prepared his speech, and he will stick to it.
She pouts, but complies nonetheless as she flies away from him. He smiles. No matter how much Nina protests, she always ends up listening to him.
“Hey, you’re Harry’s friend from Hogwarts!” says a girl who seems to be dirty from hair to toe as she stops in front of Draco. “His quidditch nemesis.”
Draco doesn’t really hug him back, but Harry pretends he doesn’t care. Draco isn’t the affectionate type, so what. They’re not dating, anyway.
Draco frowns. “I’m not a dick, you know. Just because him and I are done doesn’t mean I’ll go out spilling his secrets. That’s not my story to tell.” He feels a bit offended she would think that, but that’s probably fair enough, considering their history.
“I don’t like people to see it. They make assumptions.” He then leans down and kisses Draco right under his jaw, before squeezing his hand as he raises back up. “I’ll be back soon. Don’t worry, I’ll lock the door so no one will bother you. Get back to sleep.”
He shakes his head. “Padma. I brought up the subject of ministry funding with her, and she spilled the beans, I guess. Harry only told me about ‘generous private donors’.”
“But with Draco, you don’t have that problem. He clearly won’t idolize you, but he knows what you’ve been through, and he’s been through the same thing, in a way –
“Yes. I can still give you her card, though, if you’re done with Harry,” she smiles, twisting her hands.
A few minutes later, he finds himself seated in the middle of a gang of seven to nine-years-old, barely able to swallow a bite in between their relentless questions.
Draco snorts in surprise. He hadn’t thought about following Potter into the shower, but now the picture is definitely on his mind. He does his best to push it away.
“See you later,” Potter says as he walks to the door. “Thanks for coming. Enjoy the buffet and the champagne.”
She stops and stares at him. “I will ask you one thing, Harry. And I need you to be honest. Does he make you happy?”
Draco refuses to admit he feels a bit disappointed and leans against the back wall, hands in his pockets.
“Sure. Don’t worry, I will do honour to the place,” he smiles as he sees the tension in her shoulders. “It’s just routine, anyway, I will wow them with our top notch installations and projects before you submerge them into paperwork.”
Until he sees Draco flying up, a deep focus on his face, eyes set right above his head, and glances up to see a golden glimmer. He shoots up immediately, determined to get there first.
“Or we have spare rooms at the orphanage,” Potter adds. “Plenty. You could take one for the night, no one would mind. People do it all the time.”
Potter takes a sip. “I’m sorry, did you hear me say anything about the freakish neatness of your place? No. Then don’t tell me anything about how I organize my stuff.”
Harry waves his remarks away. Actually, he was expecting a lot worse from Ron, but also from Hermione. This is good. He can work with this.
Draco lowers his wand and watches him walking away. Why does he still feels the need, after all these years, to tease Potter, look for his weak spot, and belittle him and everything he’s done? That’s not how he feels anymore. So why can’t he stop antagonizing him?
Harry tries to imitate him, but he’s never been able to control a single eyebrow, so he probably just looks surprised. He ends up laughing when Draco rolls his eyes. “Come on, admit this is better than drinks.”
“But that’s it,” Draco finishes. “Some of us have jobs that aren’t about playing with kids all day.”
“Draco, do you want to come?” Potter asks. “We’ve got to take the kids back to the school first, but we can go for a drink after, if you want?”
“Or,” Potter whispers, looking up at him, barely inches from his face, “There’s spare room at my place. In my bed,” he clarifies.
“I know I can,” he mumbles. “It’s just… I don’t think Draco wants to be with me. He’s clearly fine with fucking, but the rest? I don’t think he’s interested.”
Because, even though Potter is sitting right next to him right now, and their legs are touching under the table, and Potter keeps dragging him into the conversation, he knows all that will crumble if anyone else gets the first hint of what’s exactly going on between them. He knows he should walk away now, before it’s too late.
He doesn’t know if he should, but he lets his curiosity take the best of him and approaches the pictures on the walls to observe them closer. There’s one that seems to be from Weasley and Granger’s wedding, with Potter grinning at his two best friends, and another one with the whole Weasley family, that was probably taken at Christmas, if he believes the decorated tree behind them. A lot of them feature a boy at different ages, who must be Teddy. He’s sometimes with Potter, but mostly alone or with other people that Draco doesn’t always recognize. One picture was taken in front of the new orphanage building, and Harry is smiling widely, one arm around Padma’s shoulder and the other around an older woman, in whom Draco recognizes his own great-aunt Andromeda – Teddy’s grandmother.
Harry laughs and, without looking, points his arm to the window. “The view.” He raises himself up on his elbow to stare at it, not resisting the temptation. The silhouette of the castle is shadowed against the luminous night sky where, at this time of the year, the sun always illuminate the horizon. “I love to see it when I wake up, and if I put the bed against the wall, then I have to stretch my neck, or get up, for that.”
Harry leans forward, hands wrapped around his glass. “I’m not asking if you like what you do. I’m talking about dreams. Is there something you’d like to do? It doesn’t even have to be a job,” he waves. “It could be, I don’t know, travelling, or getting a dog, or whatever. If you could do anything in the world, what would it be?”
Draco feels incredibly more angry than he should be at this idea – and also a bit ashamed for saying (and thinking) Potter was acting inconsiderately. As Padma just said, Potter is a grown man. What he chooses to do with his own money shouldn’t trouble Draco that much. “But doesn’t he need it for himself? Is this why he dresses like a beggar?”
It’s okay. Harry can do casual. Next time they meet, he can act as if nothing happened, and let Draco see that he doesn’t expect anything from him. That will help, hopefully. He just needs to stop being so blatantly upfront about everything. He can do that, too, probably. Maybe, if this works, they can stay friends. Or, at least, friendly. He likes being friends –
“And you think you deserved what happened to you?” asks Draco, incredulous, before being able to stop himself.
“I must admit I’ve never been a fan of this kind of busy life, but I get what some see in it. Padma actually has a flat in London, when she’s off from here. Where do you live, exactly?”
When he’s above the snitch, he dives straight toward it, extending his arm as soon as his trajectory is stabilised. From the corner of his eye, he sees Draco following straight after, but he doesn’t keep his eyes of the snitch, straight ahead of him. Sensing his closeness, the ball starts flying forward as well, but Harry uses his acceleration to the most, even if he feels Draco’s wind right against him. Stretching his body to the maximum, he jerks forward and his fingers close around the tiny ball. He laughs and rises straight up, barely avoiding Draco, right behind him.
Nevertheless, he’s in the entrance hall after his meeting with Padma, waiting for Harry to show up. To keep busy, he reads posters on the walls, mostly drawn by children to illustrate their numerous activities. A bunch of them are about quidditch, some show excursions to what he guesses to be Diagon Alley, others are of classrooms or other places within the institution. A couple even show Hogwarts. On a good portion of them, Draco notices a dark-haired figure with glasses, more or less crudely drawn. The drawings go back a few years, if Draco believes how some of them have faded colours, compared to the bright most recent ones.
He turns back expectantly, and Draco is standing in the rectangle of his door, arms at his side, staring at him, his face impenetrable. But then he just shakes his head, turns around and closes the door.
He then seems to notice he’s still holding Draco and lets go of him, running his hand through his hair with another awkward laugh.
She closes the door behind him then goes behind her desk, where she retrieves a bag Draco is sure he’s seen somewhere. She hands it to him.
Harry laughs. “Sorry, I’m on breakfast duties. This is a place with children and they will not accept the excuse of a handsome man in my bed if they’re denied food. But I’ll try my best to be quick.” Is eyes fall on their joined hands and he whispers “Oh shit.”
“I’m glad you could make it,” Harry smiles as he hugs Draco in front of the Three Broomsticks. “I thought you would have other plans.”
They’re standing in front of a miniature replica of a quidditch stadium, complete with hoops and stalls, and even a small building that could pass as a locker room. He follow Potter to the middle of the pitch, admiring not only the place but also the growing excitement in his voice as he talks about it.
“Yes, Ginny is always very generous. Okay, kids,” Harry adds in a loud voice. “Remember the rules: no running, no swearing, no leaving your seat without the company of one of us adults, and, what’s the last one?”
Harry extends a hand to him, but Draco crosses his arms, tucking his own under his flanks. He’s not ready for that. Not yet. Harry’s hand stays in the middle of the table.
Draco wonders a bit what he may have done or said wrong, for Potter to suddenly want this evening to end. Was it not going as well as he thought? What has Potter decided, during these few seconds he was looking at him? His throat suddenly dry, he empties his own glass. “Yes. Let’s go.”
Despite being in over his head with the children, Potter is positively glowing from the inside. Even if he has always enjoyed the sport, Draco feels like he will never adore it as much as Potter does. There has always been true passion in his playing of quidditch – on top of actual talent –, and that is something Draco has always admired and envied. Even today, it still draws him toward Potter.
“You can tell us if you’re in trouble, mate,” Ron adds, giving him his plate back, full of mushroom pie and lentil salad.
“Yes. Apart from that, I’ll be home, I guess. Zabini mentioned maybe he’ll drop by London over the weekend, but you never know with him, so we’ll see.”
? And is he now smiling at him with pity, or something like that, in his eyes? That man is mad. He truly is.
Harry sighs. He is touched by their concern, really. But, somedays, he would like a little less of it. He is fine, now, really. He hasn’t always been, and there was a time where their concern was one of the main things keeping him standing, but not anymore.
“Hi.” Harry is too stunned to say anything else. He blinks because of the sun, then brings his soil-covered hand to his forehead to protect his eyes. Flecks of dirt stick to his glasses. “I didn’t know you were coming today,” he says as he gets up.
He becomes enthralled in the game again, and stands up without noticing it. Ginny has always been great on a broom, but she hasn’t stopped improving since she joined the team. Her flight is precise and agile, and her coordination makes it seem almost like a dance. He truly is fascinated by her, her fierceness and her playfulness. When he watches her playing, he can understand why he fell in love with her once.
Draco keeps staring at him. “The best years? Didn’t you almost get killed basically every year you spent there?”
In less than five minutes, he’s already entranced in the game. Quidditch has always had a special way of making his heart beat, whether he is playing it or watching it. He likes the freedom of the players, the thrill of the tactics, the adrenaline of the score. And of course, the almost calm and detached mood, but at the same time staying on the edge, it takes to find the snitch.
“No offense to you, but I’ll catch the snitch in half a second and that wouldn’t be an interesting match for anyone.”
He takes a quick trip to the bathroom and, before leaving, briefly runs his hand through his hair in a useless move to appease it.
Draco grabs Harry’s hand and intertwine their fingers. “I’m happy to be here,” he answers – and realises it’s true. He knows there are still hard conversations ahead, and anxiety over the world knowing about them but, right now, he’s happy. “Harry birthday, Harry,” he whispers back.
“Anyway, as the sorting hat always said, the houses are stronger united than divided, and that’s the spirit we try to give them. Debbie, don’t provoke Nina! You know how it ends! The truth is, I don’t care which house they end up in, but some of them do actually show stronger traits that makes it quite obvious. Debbie, what did I just say!”
He sighs. “Sorry. I’m not mad at you. I’m not mad at all. I’m seeing Draco, it’s casual, it will lead nowhere, I’m fine with it, that’s all there is to say about it. Alright?”
find a way to get dirty. They will bring just as much dirt in when you wash them and when you don’t. Merlin, once I took a two minutes walk on the path with Matty, and when we got back in he had a huge clump of soil in his hair. I still have no idea how it got there.”
His other hand is taken by the sticky fingers of Matty, who is both the tiniest and filthiest kid he’s ever seen.
They make their way to him through the densifying crowd, and Harry greets them with a beaming smile and “Draco! I’m so glad you could make it!” while he pulls him in a quick hug.
“Now? Yeah, sure. Just, let me bring those to the kitchen and change. Hey, can you grab that basket over there?” Harry quickly wipes his knees and hands, then takes another basket. “So, what have you been up to, this week?” he asks as they start walking.
Ginny laughs. “What I mean is, you’re the least casual person I know – apart from Hermione, maybe. And, also, you’ve always been bad at romance.”
“Was there anything else you wanted to discuss?” Hermione asks. “I’m not kicking you out, but I have a heavy day ahead of me.”
“You know what, I actually have stuff to do, so if you have questions just go to Padma or anyone else.”
“Hey, Ron, could you come help me put the flowers?” Neville yells behind him. “Hi, Draco.” He only gives him a short nod, which Draco returns.
And now, Draco found out that not only does Harry dedicate all of his time and energy to the place, but also all of his money? And, even if there’s nothing inherently wrong with that, Draco can’t help but be bothered by all of it. Maybe it’s all that Potter didn’t tell him, maybe it’s all of his avoiding personal questions, maybe it’s the disarming honesty with which he answers some other questions, maybe it’s the kids drawings in his room, but he has the nagging feeling that Potter is hiding a lot of himself – not only from him, but from everyone else.
“What?” Harry pauses, then laughs. “No, of course not.” He laughs again, as if the idea in itself was so preposterous it became funny. “No, Ginny and I haven’t been in love with each other since the war. We’re just really good friends, now. And, regardless of all that, she’s a brilliant seeker.”
She asks him to give a tour – another one – to the prospective parents she was meeting with, and he gladly accepts as he shakes Draco’s hand to wish him a pleasant day.
“Make yourself comfortable,” Potter says as he moves in front of him to take the clothes and parchment off the desk chair. “I won’t be long.”
“I’m so sorry, but I have to leave you in the hands of Padma for now, my duty calls elsewhere. I’ll talk to you all later?”
Harry shakes his head. “There will always be good, caring, generous people. I trust people. But the political power of the entire magical world relies on one single institution. Why couldn’t we, like the muggles, have different ministries instead of just departments ? That way, if one of them were to fail, we could still rely on the others. As it is right now, if the ministry shifts, or falls, everything within our one political and juridical organ shifts, or falls. I’m sorry, but I can’t trust that.”
He looks down, and Draco feels his warm fingers on his cool wrist, just under his faded mark, and he clenches his fist while inhaling sharply.
They drink in silence for a few seconds, and Harry realises that Draco’ glass is not emptying as fast as he should, so he matches his pace, not to seem like an unsophisticated ignorant.
Harry is still catching his breath, hands on his knees, and Draco stares at him with his usual blank face.
This is a lot of information for Draco to process all at once. He thought, after his own experience, after living under the same roof as the Voldemort, after being there at Hogwarts and at the battle, that he had a pretty good understanding of what happened. But turns out he didn’t know anything. No one knew anything.
He does indeed shut up, even if he doesn’t stop looking at Draco over the ridge of his mug. Draco sighs and sits, cross-legged, on the other side of the tray.
She’s still looking at him, and Draco knows he has to unfreeze and say something. “You mean… his fundraising?”
“Thank god for her. The place wouldn’t be running so smoothly if she wasn’t here. It was a blessing when she joined us. She was bored at her office ministry job when I ran into her at a ceremony or something and I casually mentioned how behind I was on some paperwork, and jokingly said she could have the job if she wanted. Two days later she was at the door with her resume and her conditions. She was hired on the spot.” He chuckles an runs a hand though his hair, briefly looking toward the bar. “That’s basically how everyone joined. Just by showing up at the door and saying they could help. More times than I am willing to admit, it followed a joke I made about how we could use a hand for this or that.”
Draco feels like he’s being lectured by a teacher who is way too smart for him, and he doesn’t like the feeling.
They end up talking about their weeks, Draco briefly describes the lunch with his mother, and even mentions Zabini’s visit, who eventually turned up the day before for a few hours – apparently, they celebrated wildly enough together, which comforts Harry on Draco’s social circle situation.
She quickly glances away before coming back to him. “If he didn’t tell you, I guess that’s not my secret to tell.”
“Stop calling me that!” This is not going at all where he wanted it to go. “And that’s not what I meant! I don’t think I’m too good for you!”
He then turns back to the rest of the group. “You know Padma Patil, of course, our wonderful headmistress, who does all the hard work while I’m here telling you jokes. And you may know Draco Malfoy, who works at the ministry, in the secrecy and security department.” He keeps his hand on Draco’s shoulder.
“We have what we need. I don’t see the point in asking for more when we function perfectly fine as it is. I don’t see the point in taking money from some other place just for some greedy reason. And Padma probably agrees, or she would have done it before.” He smiles, then adds, seeing the frown on Draco’s face. “We’re fine, really. Thanks for the advice, though. If we ever need it, I’ll know we can ask.”
Harry decides to play it off casually, as he does best. “I guess all these years storing useless information on you to fuel my feud at Hogwarts finally paid off. But I won’t mention it again, if you mind it.”
Harry runs out of the kitchen at the sudden sound of broken glass, and finds the glasses repairing themselves on their way to the plate under Draco’s wand.
“Besides, apparating is the exact same thing whether you do it from here or from your place, so your complaints are irrelevant.”
As other players retreat to the back of the field, Draco and Potter go to stand in the middle. Potter is the first one to extend his hand as he mounts his broom, and Draco shakes it tightly, trying to convey his determination through all of his body and face.
“I don’t think that!” Harry defends himself – though he was kinda thinking that. “I just don’t think people should be alone on their birthday.”
“Look, I wouldn’t worry too much if I were you. Harry doesn’t feel pressured to give his money to the orphanage, and he can afford it, so the place is in no trouble financially. There are worse ways to spend the Black inheritance – well, not according to the Black ancestors who must turn around in their graves, probably, but you know what I mean.”
“I’m getting there. But you have to swear that you won’t judge, and that you won’t tell anyone.” Hermione opens her mouth while leaning toward him, and he rolls his eyes. “I’m fine, I swear, I am not in any kind of trouble, and nothing’s wrong. Do you swear?”
“Yeah. You said you likes games, but didn’t really think about going, so I thought you might go and enjoy it if you had the tickets.”
“Draco!” He hears on his left and turns to see Padma, wearing a stunning green sari. She comes to him and gives him a quick one-sided hug, a smile on her lips. “I didn’t know you were coming tonight. It’s good to see you.”
Harry buries his head in his plate. They don’t need to know that he suggested to Draco that he may come over after dinner and that Draco didn’t say no.
He actually feels relieved to not be in his company anymore. Not that it was disagreeable, but there are too many things about Potter that actually distracted him from his job. He’s been straining more and more to remain professional, but Potter’s passion about the place was somewhat contagious and he probably let a couple of emotions slip away.
Draco lets himself be swirled in the frenzy of setting everything up and saying hi to everyone who arrives in the middle of it. Hermione greets him warmly with a knowing smile, Ginny instantly asks him if they can now discuss Harry’s kissing techniques, George says, as he shakes his hand, that he would love to travel back in time to announce the news to his fifteen-years-old self, and Luna hugs him like they’re old friends. With each new arrival, he grows less and less nervous, and even starts to relax a little. Maybe Harry was right, and it won’t be
And with a pop he disappears, and Harry is left alone with his explanations on the tongue and thousands of thoughts swirling in his head.
“Whatever he wants. Well, no, not exactly, and you’re ministry so I shouldn’t be telling you that so, officially, he’s our project director, which means he’s in charge of the development of the place, of coming up with new ideas for our grounds and activities, of developing partnerships… He actually does a lot of work besides giving tours and quidditch lessons. But, you know, if one day he wants to give a cooking class or help set up a vegetable garden, no one is going to stop him.”
Charlotte, the muggle, seems a bit distraught, but Dora sits down opposite to Nina and says: “Really? I was a beater too in Hogwarts!”
“So, what about this summer program?” Draco asks as they start walking toward the Three Broomsticks. “Isn’t there less kids to entertain, since school is ending?”
“Okay. That’s it now. I’m done. I’ll leave you be, I have to pack. Goodnight, I guess? And if you want to see me… well, you’ll know where to find me.”
Most of the walls are covered in the same type of children’s drawing as the entrance hall, except those almost all feature a figure supposed to be Potter, with more or less details. Some photographs, both muggle and wizard, have been stuck in between the pieces of paper.
“There’s too many people in London.” Potter says as he gets up, turning around his bed in look of something, his own mug in hand, while Draco starts gulping half of his. “Too many… you know, things,” he waves vaguely.
He flies away for a couple of minutes to follow the action, then comes back to Draco, who still seems lost in thoughts.
The fact that he takes it with so much lightness makes Draco wonder what else has been going on in Harry’s life that he doesn’t know about – that the world doesn’t know about. He always assumed most things about Harry Potter was public knowledge, especially what happened during the war, but the more he gets to know him, the more he realises how wrong he was.
Harry gives the same sad smile as earlier and, this time, Draco realises that the pity isn’t directed outward, but inward. He leans forward again and pulls Harry against him. Harry scoots closer and nuzzles his nose in Draco’s neck. They just rock back and forth for a bit and, this time, Draco is the one rubbing Harry’s back.
Draco leans against the doorframe, arms crossed, staring at him. Harry takes it as an authorization to continue.
The school year is almost over, the weather is splendid, and both kids and adults have absolutely no desire to stay inside. Ginny’s surprise visit was an excellent excuse to organize an impromptu quidditch tournament. Everybody joined in on the field, even Padma, teams were made, and the winners have been promised ice cream for desert – spoiler alert: there will be no loser, and ice cream was already planned for desert long before that.
Hermione crosses her arms and leans back on her chair. She stays silent a few seconds, looking for her words. “Look, after the war, your problem with dating has been that you either met someone from the wizarding community who knew all about you and idolized you, or a muggle who knew nothing about you but with whom you couldn’t share your trauma.”
“I am a simple man with simple tastes,” Harry answers while plunging the mixing fry into his mouth. “What, how does an enlightened man like you eat his fries? Salt and vinegar?”
“Oh, alright, then.” Potter looks toward the window. Is he disappointed? He turns back to Draco. “At what time do you have to be there? I mean… Do you still have an hour to spare, or…?”
“So how comes you had no plans for tonight? It’s your birthday! Why don’t you have plans on your birthday?”
With a whiff of manure, he’s gone to the closet where he seems to pick up a random assortment of clothes. He then disappears through a door that closes behind him and that Draco assumes leads to the bathroom, as the sound of running water is soon heard.
It doesn’t really work, as Potter explodes into laughter and the way he’s late to put his hand in front of his mouth, the way he blinks, the way he almost splashes his drink, is worse than what Draco was trying to avoid.
“Sorry about that,” Harry winces. “But it was sweet of you to let her call you that. You don’t have to, though. Technically, you’re not even
“And you’re going to spend your entire summer here, surrounded by kids? That’s not much of a holiday.”
“If you don’t play by the rules you won’t make it to the team at Hogwarts! Penalty for the red team.”
They’ve barely been sitting for a few seconds when Rosmerta appears at their side, two butterbeers in hand.
Potter also said he could bring a plus one, and Draco asked whether he meant a lover. Potter had the decency to look away and say he meant a friend. Draco hesitated about that too, but if he brought a friend he would have to explain to them what they were doing here, so he didn’t want that.
“Not today, the game was longer than expected and we have to catch our portkey. Come on, guys, no lingering. Matty, you stay with me.”
Harry laughs and, closing the gap, kisses him. “Good,” he whispers as he briefly leans back, “because I like you too.”
So here he is, alone, wearing a pretty fine suit – though not his best, he doesn’t want Potter to believe he put too much effort into this –, not knowing exactly what to expect or with who he’ll be able to have a conversation here.
“The dirty children,” Potter nods sternly. “Come on, let’s be as quick as possible, maybe she’s turned her back to the door or something.”
In the decade since the war, Draco and Potter haven’t exactly become friends, but the magical world is small enough that they were forced to run into each other at frequent intervals, and as Potter proved no desire to fight with him in any way or fuel the climate of animosity that had existed between them since their very first meeting, Draco eventually gave up being angry at him too. Now, they are cordial when in each other’s presence, saying hi nodding when their paths cross.
