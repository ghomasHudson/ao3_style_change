“Quite.”  Draco said, scratching the back of his head and looking down.  He picked non-existent lint off his shirt, trying to wildly pull a neutral subject from his head.
"That sounded like it hurt."  Harry said, dropping his hands but staying standing where he was.
“But not that time??  Ass..”  Harry said the word without venom, smiling when Draco shoved him.
He paused at the entry of a room not far inside, his breath catching in his chest and two voices flooded his mind in memory.
Draco nodded a bit but stayed quiet for the moment.  He was feeling like a wrung out cloth.  Too much had happened before the day had even gotten started, and he had yet to shake the skeevy feeling of the nightmare entirely.
Draco nodded and didn't argue the point which actually made Harry smile.  He watched as Draco flicked the wand through his fingers, then twisted it in a tight circle with a muttered incantation.  As soon as he did, the walls became cluttered with posters and pictures, clothes were strewn about the room over the back of furniture and out of one opened drawer.  A massive fur rug sprung up through the wooden floor and the typical Slytherin furnishings of green and silver turned to navy blue.
“So... You're going to teach me Muggle things.” Draco said, narrowing his eyes skeptically.  “You.”
As he stripped and then slid himself under the hard and hot spray of water, he thought about everything that had happened.  He didn't WANT to rehash it all, but he was rather powerless to stop the march of the memories from intruding in.
"Some of us have other things on our minds than being top in potions class." Draco said haughtily, pushing through a thicket of waist high bushes, trying not to react to every single noise he could hear in the woods around him.
“You're not being serious.” Draco folded his arms across his chest as he gave Harry a cold stare.
, Potter.  That if I want money from my Gringotts account it is NONE of your business why I want it.  That if I want to have these app things that let me have food delivered to my door then that is MY choice.  I have lived on my own and done just FINE.  Even if YOU don't agree with the manner in which I've lived, I have done just fine.  I will thank you VERY kindly to remember that I agreed to this protection program, but at NO point did I surrender my freedom or my autonomy.”
He thumped down the pile of books he was carrying, picking up the one off the top before he sat down across the table from Ron and Hermione.
Draco slept pretty much all of the next day.
“No.  None of them gave their names, I assume that was to promote some sort of anonymity.”  Draco frowned as he looked the short ways down to Harry's face, curbing the desire to step away from him.  He looked altogether TOO happy and too pleased.  Coming off him being so angry, this was more than a little disconcerting.
--------
Harry slammed the book shut.
"It was really.. that arranged?  When you said it before I thought it was just sort of...  Well I don't know what I thought, but I didn't think it was that set up."  Harry fiddled with his napkin as he watched Draco.
The ring acts on thoughts already in your head, it's not at all dark magic, but sometimes something that makes us open up to ALL our thoughts, especially the deep down ones, can be a little bit of a gamble about where they might lead.  ;)
He wasn't happy.  But he was content.  Contentment meant a lot to him, content was safe and easy and asked very little of him.  He worked, he had a few friends, he went out and had a decent time.
“More.  I don't know if any of these will be any help but they seemed remotely relevant.”  He opened his book, scanning the pages as he flipped them slowly, not really looking for anything in particular since he was pretty much relying on Hermione to do the bulk of the leg work.
“You aren’t going to ask what exactly I want to see Draco about concerning Scorpius?”
“I have absolutely no idea.” He said to her in return, and it was an honest answer.  He didn't really know what that was.  What Draco had truly wanted.  If it truly was to try and give back the necklace that Harry had always thought rather girlish to begin with. Ginny gave him a slightly side long glance with a smile and raised eyebrows that made him laugh and colour faintly.
“He's angry at the lot of them.”  Draco said, his own tone rather dark.  “I don't really blame him.  They expect him to fight for them but don't tell him anything at all.  Keep trying to protect him like it would really do any good in the end.”
"Who'd want to invite him anywhere?"  Ron said, struggling with his tie until Hermione leaned over to help him.
Draco didn't reply to what Neville said, folding his arms almost defensively over his chest as they walked, trying to keep his mind from the conversation he'd had with Harry the day before.  About how Neville had specifically asked to be on Draco's protection team full time.  And by extension he was working not to wonder if Neville had also tried to advocate heavily into giving him the best place out of the lot.
Then Draco understood.  Warm lips crushed hard against his own, forcing yet another noise from him, though this one was far lower, slightly cat like and heated as he pressed into Harry in return.  It was like reflex to lean into him, to tilt his head so their lips slid and fit together more closely.
"I thought you liked Snape."
“Ollivander...”  He said, turning his head to look at Neville.  “You talked about him.. disappearing... He was in our dungeon.  At my house.  I used to have to bring food to him...”
Draco watched as Neville got out a pan, explaining as he went about pans and oil and all things Draco actually knew, since even with a wand you had to know some basics about cooking.  He let Neville say whatever he wanted to, though, tired of having to cut him off from telling him basic things and not wanting to make him even more uncomfortable.
"What do you mean?"  Hermione said as she and Luna rejoined them now everyone was dressed.
“I guess not...”  Harry said, rubbing his hand against his leg under the table so he wouldn't grab the heaviest book and heave it at Ron.
"You don't know."  Draco said quietly, squeezing the other boy's hands.  "You may never know... What everything has meant to me.  All of it."
"A Vanishing Cabinet."  Borgin said in a surprising display of truthfulness.  He had taken a tray of jewelry and small trinkets out of the case and set it on the counter.  "But it won't suit the purpose he wants it for."
That helped.  The slower breaths helped ease the last of the squeeze on his lungs.
Harry grabbed for the first object he could lay his hand on, hurling it at Draco who laughed even harder.  He held one arm up to deflect the blow brought by the moldy pillow Harry had tossed and then smiled down at him a little more warmly, plunking down onto the floor in front of him.
Harry had barely opened the front door of Malfoy Manor before he was leaving again.  Pelting down the walkway as fast as he could possibly go while something massive, dark and ghostly chased him away from the house.
He'd finish his coffee, first.  Then he'd write back to him.
Harry weighed this information carefully.  Part of him not understanding why Borgin would offer him this information so easily, but part of him also understanding why, given how Draco had acted with him.  Perhaps he was tired of the way the Malfoys treated him.  This was, after all, the second time Harry had seen Draco in Borgin & Burkes and both times he wasn't exactly a pleasant customer.  Maybe Borgin wasn't interested in whatever it was Draco was doing, maybe he didn't care a bit and this was his revenge.  Not giving Draco what he really needed...
Harry trailed off then, raising one hand to touch his scar as it prickled.  It started small and was getting stronger... His mind jumped to Draco talking about the icy feeling on the back of his neck when someone was prying and he pieced it together.
So he had no wand, which meant the fireplace was necessary and it served it's purpose well.
Draco took another step back as Harry swung around so he was sitting on the edge of the window ledge, his feet hanging down.
"I know.  I
And yet...
He watched the train start to move, knowing he, himself, had to now leave for Hogwarts as well.  He waved at the windows even though he had absolutely no idea where any of his children were behind them, and found himself hoping, really hoping, that Albus and Scorpius would be friends.
He opened a drawer and stuffed it inside, hoping that the Room of Requirement would hide this for him as well.
"I'm not.  But we've done this three times now."
"I saw her out yesterday."  Harry said, clearly speaking in careful tones.
He looked at them for a few moments, curled around his wand, then deposited them into a small vial that he then held out to Harry.
a big deal, Ron.”  said Hermione, making a face at him and then pointing to the spell words for Harry to see more clearly.  “It isn't a spell that you just say and that's it.  Its a spell where intent, power and focus play the biggest part rather than the right words.”
The deed went into his vault at Gringott's.  The key he pocketed and carried around for several more weeks before he did anything with it.
"Fudge was always a coward.  And Scrimgeour was a ridiculously pompous figurehead.  We've done so much better with Kingsley."
Again the unnatural stillness hung in the room. Tom's eyes were on him intensely though his pose was quite relaxed on the couch.  He tilted his head a bit, his eyes narrowing slightly.
Harry’s eyes went wider as he looked at Draco, feeling a hot curl in the pit of his stomach as anger burned his insides raw.  “The Ministry searched your house when I gave them a tip.”
“And specifically asked to be assigned to your protection detail.”  Harry said, smiling as he rocked back on his heels.  “We both assumed you recognized him.”
“I do, too.”
--------
Harry sounded so sorry.  So apologetic and so lost that it made Draco's chest ache.  He swallowed hard a few times, clearing his throat to try and keep his voice from sounding thick and tight.
“Maybe I could help you.”  Harry said after a lengthy pause.  Shifting a bit before he spoke again before finally asking Draco a direct question.  “What is it you have to make a quick get away from?”
The two men smiled at each other a bit more openly, neither saying anything for a few moments before Draco broke the silence.
Draco- Can you please go back to calling me Malfoy?
“And I wouldn’t hesitate to tell someone if I thought they were involved in something nasty again.  You know that and they know it too.”  Draco smiled a little more softly, closing his eyes as he leaned into Harry’s palm.  ”I just can’t believe this...  I thought for sure even with you speaking out for us we’d all end up in Azkaban.”
“I'll just order things from Diagon...”  Draco said with a scoff, folding his arms against his chest.  “I won't need to buy anything in Muggle shops.”
"This... Us.." Draco said, shaking his head a bit, making the line Harry hated appear between his eyebrows again.  "This isn't how it's supposed to be."
Harry shook his head, finding it hard to understand why Draco was so wary of him.  "Nothing like that."
"What good would that do?"  Harry asked, sitting on the lid of his trunk to make it close, groaning as he got up to retrieve a sock that was his, sticking out from under Ron's wardrobe.
die.”
“His idea.”
"Did he say who he actually managed to talk into being the one?"  Draco asked, then sighed when Harry shook his head.
He made it outside and apparated home, managing to get in the door and to a chair in the foyer before the full brunt of the interaction hit him.
"You assume, Harry."  Dumbledore said gently, tilting his head in a bit.  "And I would assume as well.  But should someone find out, should there be one thread that could lead from you to Draco... That could be all it takes to lead them straight to the source.  It is best that you have nothing to do with it.  If something happens and they trace the communication with Narcissa back to me, well.." Dumbledore smiled, waving his hand a bit.  "It would not be nearly cause for alarm the way it would if it was discovered you were helping them.  I am the root of many of Voldemort's problems.  Adding another will not cause a ripple."
Draco ducked his head a bit, smiling and going slightly pink.  "I told you, the arrogant prick still exists.  Just not quite the same way."
"Yeah.  He did."  Draco shifted, leaning a bit to rest his chin on the top of his knees.  "And it's been full on.  Just.. full on.  My family is out of favour with him to start with.  My immediate family, anyways.  With my father in... Azkaban..."
Draco felt his eyes widen at what Harry was telling him, nodding his head a bit and motioning with one hand a bit to get Harry to come even closer.  "Go on..."
Draco found the sugar cubes and slid them onto the counter in front of Neville before taking the pot of coffee from the machine to pour into two mugs. He tried to think of something to say, but found the harder he tried, the more embarrassed he got over the whole thing.  All the fuss.
"Fairness.  Harry Potter ALWAYS has to play fair."  Draco smirked in a slightly more in character sort of way his head tilting down a bit.  "Can't ever have a leg up on someone else or you can't sleep at night."
"Well it never happened, hm?  So maybe we don't
A rush of heat flooded him as his hips jutted forward and he could feel Harry's pressed into him.  Feel HIM pressed against him, that hard flesh that matched his own grinding into him, sending tingles through his limbs as he ground back.
"It might be as simple as a new owl to start with.  A new owl and a late night delivery right to her room while she's asleep.  He, and no one, ever went into my parents bedroom.  And while I wouldn't trust that long term, it would be enough to start things."
Draco watched, impassive though he was quite enjoying the look that crossed Harry's face, the way he opened and closed his mouth several times without saying anything, before dropping his head down to look at Draco's wand.
"No.  Dementors..." Harry said, watching the other man. "What would yours have been?"
Draco's voice cut into his mind, his full body stepping through the image in front of him and scattering it like it was made of  fog.
He felt quite warmly invited to step into the Manor, which he did readily.  And while the outside looked like the house had been abandoned for several decades, the inside looked like it had maybe been left for a month.  Everything felt empty, maybe slightly stale, and everything had just a bit of dust on it's surfaces.
"Relax, Malfoy.  Just making conversation."
Will he let Harry help him with the dark plans he has to undertake by the end of the year?
“Because I would have given it to you then if I'd known you wanted it.”
“I’m afraid it was becoming more than a little boring and a little routine.  At least in the past ten years or so.” Harry said truthfully, trying not to feel regret in his words.  Being an Auror had meant something to him when he was coming of age.  There was so much need for good ones, so much of him was consumed by the desire to bring justice and find the people doing wrong.  But honestly, it was only interesting for awhile after Voldemort was destroyed once and for all.
Nothing from the Wizarding World was enough to destroy that contentment.
He wondered now, as he carefully started to open the drawer, if something had happened to it.  If something was happening in the Wizarding World that had activated it.
Draco shivered slightly, thinking he should have gotten redressed, not just pulled a cloak over his pyjamas, sitting down on the ledge of the window he'd sat in the last time he was up here.
He tapped each cake carefully to make them instantly cool enough to work with, and tapped the raspberry one an extra time so it would cut itself perfectly in half.  He worked carefully and slowly to assemble the cake as much as he could without magic, but he did give the towering structure a gentle poke to straighten it up and solidify its supports once he was done putting it together.
Sitting in the library, way at the back.  Both of them next to each other, alone.  His hand under the table, against Theodore's knee.
"Then what, pray tell, do you want from me?"
Draco had given Harry the letter, thrust it at him as tears poured down his face.
Then pretending to have a magical moment of clarity while the camera was trained on him.  "I think.." He said, leaning towards the camera a bit, smiling.  "I think I might know what to do..."
“It's a spell to fix Vanishing Cabinets.”  She said, opening the book properly and turning it around for Harry to look at.
Then came a crash course in Muggle money, which thankfully was not that difficult, although holding bits of paper that were WORTH something rather than actual gold seemed odd to him, to be honest.
"We should go."  Draco said, releasing the hold he had on Harry's shirt, looking out the window once more before he stepped away from the other boy.
His hands trembled a bit as they clumsily unfolded the parchment, unsure of what he expected as a reply.  Unsure what he WANTED to see as a reply.
And that was more than a little uncomfortable.  Weren't his priorities warped then?  Shouldn't he want to care more about keeping Dumbledore alive than helping Draco?  How messed up had things gotten....
"If Draco was with family I'm sure they would have taken care of Malfoy Manor."  Hermione spoke crisply as always, wiping her mouth carefully on her napkin before she continued.  "But everything is falling apart and no one can get inside.  The house still protects itself from intruders."
“I don't think that it's doing this exactly for me.”  Draco said, moving along a path that wound through the piles of junk precariously.  “I think this is what it is when someone desperately needs a place to hide something.  Maybe it started out as small as a closet but had to grow to accommodate the centuries of things students have needed to hide.”
"What do you mean by that, Potter?"  He sneered, his eyes as icy as his tone.
Draco shook his head.  "No, I couldn't see them then.  I can now.  I did on the way to school this year."  He paused, chewing the inside of his lower lip for a few moments, looking at the floor, scrunching his socked toes into the rug.  "It was a bad summer."
What COULD that have been if things hadn't been as they were?
But after a startling revelation about who one of the Aurors is, and a very awkward conversation, Draco finds himself in the one position he never EVER wanted to be in.
He did think, though, as he ducked through the portrait hole, he might actually prefer whatever conversation was to be had in Slytherin that night.
“Really?”  Draco tilted his head a bit as he looked at Neville, furrowing his brow.  “Your grandmother...  She had to know that using someone else's wand won't give good results...”
Harry- I gave you money.
"I didn't outright tell her.  We had enough reason to go our separate ways without it, I didn't feel like adding something on top of it.  I think she suspects."
“They're a matching set.”  Draco said, shifting a few things that had fallen in front of it since the last time he was there.  “The one in the shop is still there and this is it's mate here  But it's broken.”
Physically he was still sitting in the kitchen of his Muggle flat, but mentally he was back in Malfoy Manor.  Seeing Ollivander's gaunt face, his sunken cheeks, the sympathetic look in his eyes as Draco's hands shook holding out the food that he was, more often than not, tasked with bringing the prisoners being held in his own home.
--------------------------------------------
"Why in Merlin's name would I lie to you?"  Draco unfolded his arms and set both feet on the floor, leaning forward a bit.  He felt Harry shift next to him, felt a hand against his back very lightly.  "What would I gain from lying to you?  It isn't as if anything I do escapes your notice forever, I'd be doing nothing but buying myself the few minutes it would take you to write to Astoria and ask her who she's been dating or ask her if she even really likes me."
"Very soon, I hope."
Draco rolled his eyes, picking up a box of cereal he had in the 'recognized from television' pile called Lucky Charms.  It promised marshmallows along with crunchy cereal and that was quite intriguing.  “I only put in my withdrawal form this morning with one of the Aurors.  You shouldn't have bothered coming until you had it yourself and could go to the bank.”
They sat in silence for a little while, digesting the conversation.  When Harry lightly cleared his throat, Draco brought his attention back to the room.  "Hm?"
“So.  This is...?”  He trailed off as quickly as he started, turning around to the Aurors behind him, all of whom seemed to smile stiffly and encouragingly at him.
"You okay?"  Harry asked, looking at Draco and raising his eyebrows a bit.  "I was surprised you agreed to come with me."
"Snape's bound to be more hands on."  Harry said casually without thinking, nearly running into Malfoy's back when the blonde stopped and turned around to glare at him.
Eventually they broke, both in their own heads claiming they stopped first.
He stroked the Owl's chest as he brought him over to the open window, smiling encouragingly though he had to admit he was reluctant to send Mimir off again so quickly after reuniting with him.
"What is WRONG with you!?"  Draco sputtered when Harry continued to talk to him in such a friendly way.  He'd taken a step back from the dark haired boy, looking at him like he had eels coming out of his ears.
He was in the middle of contemplating what the weird wood and metal structures were when Harry broke the silence.
“Not necessary, I can figure it out.”  Draco said, frowning a little more as Harry sat down on a stool next to him.  “Why are you here, you said you'd be here in a few days.”
"No, we wouldn't.  But you should."
Harry himself, to his own admission, had killed people in the war.  But surely he had reason to.  Did he feel bad about it?  Probably not since he offered the information so openly.  He'd killed Death Eaters and Quirrell.  Quirrell had been quite innocent, he thought.  But there was nothing to be done, really.  Voldemort had attached himself quite literally to Quirrell, Harry couldn't have decided to not do as he needed to just because of that.
"I know.  That's why I think we should start on that now.  We don't know if we'll need to talk to her, but if we do, we want to have a plan in place beforehand so we aren't in a rush if and when the time comes."  Harry brushed his thumb once more against Draco's cheek then lowered his hand.  Immediately he found he missed the warm softness of the other boy's skin.
“One of the Aurors brought it to me.”
"And what about you?"  Harry asked, leaning forward a little bit more.  "What about your safety?"
He should have known Hermione wouldn't have been subtle enough to try and figure out what Draco had been doing and looking at in the shop.  But she moved so swiftly he hadn't been able to stop her.
Once he finally finished and put the cap back on the ink, it was starting to get too dark to see well in the living room, which made it perfect time for him to open the window and call Mimir over to him.
“That young one.  The one who's always smiling so much and who laughed when I talked about you needed new Aurors if I had to walk up and tell them I had been hurt.”
"Kingsley is working on this..."
After rinsing the last dregs of conditioner out of his hair, he turned off the water and reached for a towel.  He'd hoped the water would help scrub what felt like masses of cobwebs out of his brain, but it had mostly just made him feel tired again.
"When is he being released?"
"But I should help you with the good essay."  Harry tapping one finger lightly against Draco's shoulder.  "I shouldn't have the easy time writing the bad essay while you have to do painstakingly good work."
"My mother?  Why?"  Draco's tone was immediately defensive, his hackles raised in obvious protection of his mother.
"You need to open the door."
But they were targeting people like him, like Draco, and killing them.  The pattern was quite clear and now they, the Ministry, needed to take action.
“You would have done the same thing in his place.  He never really wanted to get married, but the entire WORLD was waiting for his happily ever after.  Anytime someone talked to him they asked him when he was getting married.  He did it because he thought it was the next logical step.”  Neville paused there, finishing his toast and brushing his hands off.  “He was.. kind of going through the motions for awhile.  He had no idea what he was supposed to do next, talked a lot about what the hell he was supposed to do with his life when he had achieved something he could never top while he was a teenager.  So when everyone talked to him about getting married he just thought... Alright that's what I do next.  I get married and have kids and be a dad and an Auror and...”
He moved back to the table and sat down, then looked reproachfully at Harry who was holding a biscuit.
"I know exactly..  what is going on..."  Snape said, tilting his head to look down his hawkish nose at the younger boy.  "I know what it is you're to do this year.  I know what service He has set to you.  I aim to help you complete it as you will surely fall short."
"It's a compliment!"  Harry protested, smoothing his hair back and wiping water from his face.  "Unless that's all you've got.  You know.. shower, rather than a grower.  Which are you?"
Chapter Summary - It is absolutely, without a doubt, without even a TRACE of question, Harry's fault that they were doing detention together.  Alone.  In the Forbidden Forest.  There had to be rules against this sort of thing.  It was CALLED the 'Forbidden Forest' for Merlin's sake! Now he was alone with Harry again.  And he couldn't stop thinking about what had happened in the Observation Tower a week before.  Stupid, stupid, stupid.....
Draco- Do YOU know what internet is?
"It could come to that, Draco.  You can't do the task Voldemort set for you, you know you can't."
"Snape had EVERYTHING to do with it!"
"We'll find a way."  He said firmly, looking straight into Draco's silver grey eyes.  And he meant it.
He had no idea if there would be anything in the house or grounds that would lead him to what happened, or where Draco was now.  But as soon as Ron and Hermione had told him Malfoy Manor was going to be sold, he knew he wanted it.  Didn't even have to think about it, he wanted it.  He wanted everything inside.  He wanted to rifle through everything, find all the secret hiding places, search the grounds, and maybe, just maybe, turn up a lead somewhere.
Draco let out the breath he was holding when Harry broke the awful silence.  His fear had started saying maybe the other man had just apparated away as soon as he spoke.  But he was still there.
Draco looked up from the wand to Harry’s face, studying him carefully.  “You won it from me fairly.”
Ron was still chuckling as they went upstairs, and said a cheery goodnight to Harry who was eager to just get into bed and not have to talk anymore.
Draco smiled, raising his head again to meet Harry's eyes as he nodded.  “That works.  But...”
They had asked him if he'd heard about the murders, and of course he had.  He may have decided he preferred to spend as much time as possible inside, but he still took the paper.  The deaths had been front page news, six wizards and witches so far, all of them of dubious alignment in the war seven years ago, all turned up dead without a mark on them.  Everyone suspected it was the Killing Curse and Draco had to agree.
A nightmare...
Draco, once returning to his study a few hours later, had long since forgotten that he hadn't put the letter in the drawer.
He wasn't sure how he felt about that.  It bothered him, before, that his scar was no longer acting up.  He had felt disconnected, but now...  Now he just felt spied on.
"Oh yes."  Harry said with a smirk, getting to his feet.  "Very much so..."  He sighed, stretching his arms and looking regretfully at Draco.  "I have to get back.  I'm sure Ron and Hermione are waiting up for me."
When Harry finally corners Draco in the bathroom with Moaning Myrtle, he expects to demand answers to his questions. But when he finds Draco in tears and absolute despair, all he can think of is getting him somewhere safe to find out what the hell is going on...
"Draco told me." Harry said simply, turning his head slightly away from Snape.
Harry watched him for a few moments, then seemed to forcibly put softness into his eyes and smile at the blonde even though there was concern and question still written behind every feature.  “No matter.  Whatever it was, you seem fine now.  Are you fine?”
“It's so I can show you how to use the oven part.  Bacon and eggs is cooked on the stove right?  Chicken is cooked in the oven, then I can do it all at once and you'll have chicken you can warm in the microwave later for an easy meal.”
Draco was barely breathing as Harry spoke.  Something about the words, the information and the way he was talking about it raised the hairs on the back of his neck.  Not much of it made any sense to him at all, but he suspected that THAT was what would make it so meaningful to Voldemort himself.   He nodded as Harry finished, smiling just a bit.  "I'll tell him..."  He made a slight choking noise, laughing as Harry pulled his tie again.  "If it's safe to do so!  I swear I'll only tell him if it's safe to do it..."
Harry’s face was right in his, his eyes looking fiery and murderous as both hands were bunched in the front of his robes, holding his hard against the stone wall.
He couldn't help but smile ever so slightly at the note of frustration in Harry's voice.  Some things, like wanting to taunt the ever loving fuck out of him, never went away.  No matter what the situation and no matter that he hadn't set out to antagonize him.
He felt Draco shudder, squeezing him tighter.  He couldn't help thinking right then, even though it really wasn't the right time, that this was a little strange.
Harry smiled a bit, letting out a soft breath as he nodded.  "You're right.  It's just... easier to accept the threat to yourself.  Harder to accept the threat to those you care about."
to your Auror.  The Auror spoke to me.  Knocked on my door and offered me the drink.”
"Don't listen to him."  Prue said with her warm smile turned towards him.  "I think it sounds a treat.  Something totally different.  Who's to say it wouldn't make a good wedding cake when all together.  The flavours sound beautifully cohesive."
Harry’s face fell again as he realized how true that was.  Draco’s hands tightened on his arms and he growled at the blonde. “Get your hands off me.”
“I didn't even hear you say the incantation..”
"I'm not joking."  Draco said, pushing his hand further towards the other man.  "Bet me I won't make it onto the show and win."
Draco watched Harry carefully, as he always did when he started talking about his family and their involvement in the other side of the war.  He knew Harry didn't hold him personally accountable for any of it.  But he couldn't help being worried that at some point he'd say something that went too far, that revealed something that Harry didn't know and couldn't stomach.  That even if he didn't hold Draco accountable or responsible for any of this, he wouldn't be able to stand being around him once he knew too much.  So far, Harry had never flinched, not once.
"Ouch...  That's the really long winded version of 'I'm not angry at you, but I am disappointed in you.'"
He didn't say anything, but he smiled when he saw the thin lines there.  The skull, the twisting snake that moved a bit of it's own accord.  He moved one finger out, gently tracing along the snake, watching as it seemed to recoil from his finger.
"So... Did you get your Howler from Mrs Weasley?"
Harry smiled, not as easily fooled as Draco's own mind.  He abandoned the chip, finally (poor thing was ragged at that point), and brushed off his hands.  “You will be fine with it, it just might take some time.”
He lingered at the door, long enough for Draco to notice he was there and glare at him.  Zabini turned around and did the same.  But Harry looked back at Draco, one side of his mouth quirking up just a bit before he regretfully carried on down the hall, back to his own compartment.
“We're not supposed to be talking to each other!”
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
"But he wouldn't tell you what it was, I'm guessing."  Harry frowned when Draco shook his head.  "So we really are just supposed to trust him."
Draco huffed out a breath, moving to slide his wand into his pocket only to realize he wasn't wearing anything with pockets.  He was, in fact, just wearing boxer shorts.
That rendered Draco silent as he looked back at Harry with a deeper but not quite so suspicious frown.  “Afraid of you?” He asked after almost a full minute had passed.
He moved closer to Neville but only so he could look more closely at some of the other things.  “Sam.. Sung...  eh.. phone..  google...  Oh now whatever that last one is, it sounds rude.  What ARE those?”
"It was."  Draco agreed, stretching his arms up over his head.  "The looks I got when I came out of the room.  Aunt Bellatrix and Snape and a few others were still there.  They just gaped at me but I didn't say a word."
Frustrated, Draco tossed his phone onto the coffee table, ignoring it when the chimes went once, then twice, then a third time a few minutes later.  He didn't want to talk to Harry anymore, all that ever seemed to do was make him angry.  And it was clear that Harry didn't particularly see why being mistaken for dead was such a big deal.
"You're looking in the wrong direction, Malfoy." Harry pointed out the window he's been looking through, then at the one Draco had been working at.  "East.  Not West."
Draco looked back up to Harry's face again, two small pink spots appearing high on his cheeks.  He hesitated a moment, started to put his hand out, then pulled it back again, his head tilting and eyes narrowing as he sized Harry up a little more.  “Why?” he asked simply, his hand still slightly outstretched, not close enough to take the chain back, just enough that Harry would know he wasn't yet saying no.
Harry waited until they couldn't hear the footsteps anymore, then pulled his hand back from Draco's mouth, smirking up at him.  "It's hard to muzzle someone taller than you."
"All will be well, My Lady Malfoy."  He said easily, raising one hand and bowing slightly as she swept out of the shop.
Then turned without another word or even a look to Harry to follow his mother up the hall.
Harry just about melted with relief, so pleased that Draco was so much quicker and so much more clever than Ron ever was.
Harry is having trouble getting to the Room of Requirement so he and Draco meet outside.  Draco has talked to Snape, they need to do some planning, things are getting more complicated.  There has to be a way out of this and Harry won't stop until he finds it.
“Potter's idea.  And after he screamed at me thinking I was socializing with you.”
"Well...  I'm not so sure now, alright?  I can change my mind."
More people, two of them, at his bench.  Smiling at him. The fucking judges, Prue and Paul, right there in front of him.  He turned on his smile again, trying to look charming and a bit harried.
They sat in silence for a long time, both lost in their own thoughts, but comfortable.  That was the oddest part, Draco thought.  He was perfectly comfortable sitting here with Harry.  Perfectly comfortable talking to him.  Maybe still slightly embarrassed by what they'd been doing together aside from this...  But he knew there was a good chance he'd feel like that about anyone he'd been doing those things with.  Not just Harry.
"Not all of us have flaunted the rules so much that we're quite well acquainted with the nasty things in there." Draco spat the words out at Harry and his confidence raised a tiny bit at the murderous look on Harry's face.
"Potter?"  He said, his hand starting to shake a bit as he looked around and around, turning on the spot where he was, not wanting to move an inch.
Harry fell silent and Tom stayed silent as well.  The quiet in the room was unnatural and muffled, no noise from the world outside, no noise from the rest of the orphanage.  Eventually Tom spoke again, sliding to get to his feet and walk over to Harry.
And predictably...  Draco has used his wand to make things around him much nicer.  As would befit a Malfoy.
Tom smiled as Harry answered.  The cautious way Harry felt around his answer was what he had hoped for.  Had Harry answered him with how great and wonderful and amazing it was, he would have ended the conversation immediately and likely would have struck Draco dead within the hour, Dumbledore's murder be damned.  He didn't need too many people knowing things about his young self if they were liabilities.
It only took him a few moments before he knew exactly what he wanted his very first text to say, and he carefully typed it out on the small screen of letters.  Once he clicked send, the phone made a faint blooping noise to indicate the message had been sent successfully, and Draco could see it in the green speech bubble, just waiting for the eyes of the receiver.
"Why?  It is all my fault, I sort of deserve it."
"As himself in an orphanage.  Voldemort was an orphan, Dumbledore went to the orphanage to tell him he was a wizard and was entitled to go to Hogwarts.  That was one of the memories that he showed me in one of our meetings, so Voldemort put us back there.  He wanted to make sure I was telling the truth, that I recognized him and could give him details about his meeting with Dumbledore."
“You're joking.”
“I don't think I need to, do I?”  He asked, looking from Ron to Hermione.  “I got what we really needed to know.”
“What?”
But warmth... And a gentle noise.  Noise that rose and fell.  Close to his ear?
"Get married and raise a family." Draco said, confirming Harry's suspicions that this was just like what everyone else said.
He was lying.  Totally lying.  But he wanted to do anything to cling to some part of having Harry in his life.
He turned the folded parchment over and picked up his quill again, sketching out their own made up version of the Slytherin crest for good measure.  He wasn't sure Theodore would recognize his handwriting now, but if his memories were the same, he might remember the crest and would be more willing to open the letter.
Who was speaking?  He'd just been...  Talking to Ollivander?
And then... he wasn't sure what to do at all.
"Mm..  I never cheated on her.  Never.  I wouldn't do that..  But I couldn't help seeking out new male friends.  That I could have been into if it wasn't for her.  And I'd never tell them anything.  Ever... But you can just tell sometimes with the right people and so we'd get really close and get really... borderline obsessive, to be honest.  One day, during one of these friendships, she was so angry at me for focusing so much on him and not on her.  She said 'Why don't you just go and marry HIM then!?' And I just..."
“No really!  I mean... growing up with my relatives I had absolutely nothing.  Nothing.  And then this giant man shows up, gives them what for and tells me I'm a wizard.  Suddenly it feels like I have everything and it's all because of this giant guy and someone he calls Dumbledore..”
Draco couldn't seem to turn his head, or move, and could just barely breathe, but he heard and felt Harry's back thump against the couch as he sat back.  He heard his exasperated sigh.
"Even compared to keeping Dumbledore alive?"
Neville, it turned out, was relatively undemanding company.  Sure there were topics that they clearly could not touch without things getting weird, but Draco had to admit that that was probably the case with everyone he knew.  Or used to know.
“I.. Sorry, My Lord.”  Draco said, inclining his head a bit and taking a few steps forward to stop next to Harry, his eyes glued to Tom.
“Maybe they'll be friends.”  Harry said quietly, standing a little taller than he had been, his shoulders setting back, his chin raising slightly.  But his posture was in a way protective of the man standing in front of him, not challenging him. “Perhaps.”  Draco said after a long pause, uncertainty and unasked questions showing plainly in his eyes.
That's really what it felt like.  He had been dreaming, and at once became aware he was dreaming before it felt like the floor shifted from under him and he drifted down deeper within his own mind.
“It’s funny how many regrets you can have based simply on who your father was.” The blonde said somewhat quietly, unable to stop his eyes moving around to figure out if anyone else could hear him.  A habit that still hadn’t died when he spoke of things, of family, that he was sure wasn’t proper for him to say.
“So.. uh...”  Neville cleared his throat once, twice, then accidentally clattered his knife and fork off of his plate and onto the counter.  He spoke again as he reached for them to put them back where they should be.  “Harry mentioned you know how to wash up.”
"It doesn't have to be anything.  I understand why you would have felt it.  Everything was so messed up, everything was so crazy..."
Harry and Draco get one over on Snape, while also leaving McGonagall almost speechless!
"I think so.."  Harry said, looking over at Sanguini (having overheard an introduction so knowing his name), a guest of a guest at the party.  "I've never seen one before I don't know for sure, but the name kind of gives him away."
"I kind of want to tell her to just go to the safe house and stay there."  Draco said, leaning his head a bit towards Harry's hand.  "I just...  Have a feeling that this isn't going to go well.  I want her out as soon as possible.  If no one knows where she is then she's safe."
"I know.  You were talking to yourself and it was driving me insane.  I can't work with you muttering and swearing."
Thanks so much for all the comments on the last chapter!  I'm sorry I'm not answering everyone individually.  I'm a shy dork... this is easier.
"Crash course in life."  Harry said, turning his head so he could see Draco, smirking a bit.  "Harry, you're a wizard.  Oh and you're the sole reason the Wizarding World exists as it does today instead of being ruled by a really nasty super villain.  Oh and he's dead, don't worry.  But wait!  You say he isn't dead?  You must be lying.  Lets spend a year trash talking you.  Oh wait, we're wrong and you're right.  He is still alive.  Well shit, sorry mate.  You better take care of that for us.  You're the only one who can, we're pretty sure."
"No...  Well, I mean yes... But that's not what I was thinking."  Harry said, one hand still closed in the side of Draco's velvety dress robes.
"He wants you to do something and if you don't then he'll kill you."
"Lies."  Snape practically spit the word at Harry, leaning against him harder.
He cleared his throat softly, touching his glasses, then held his hand with the chain back out to Draco who immediately shook his head.
Harry watched Draco move back to the couch, puzzled when the other boy took out a piece of paper and a quill, thinking that he was writing out a time and day to meet.  He was about to tell him they could just agree on a time now before they left when Draco came back with a very fake and very odd smile on his face.
He pulled and opened the door, pushing it wide enough to see Harry on the other side.  "You called me a prat."
It stung to see someone care about him so much when he didn't deserve it.  He didn't...  And not just because of his past, but because he was cowardly in the present as well.
"I believe you.  Completely."  He was sold on the whole idea, and quite content to relax a little more as he ate and Harry did the same beside him.
Harry shook his head, shifting in the chair to turn towards Draco a bit.  "The day we were all in Diagon Alley.  I saw you on your own and followed you to Borgin and Burkes.  Overheard you talking about him...  Friend of the family or not, I figured it was possible he was threatening you.  But it isn't him."
“Inconvenient...”  Draco could help but say, his eyes still looking at the 'phone' in Neville's hand.
Okay so that wasn't terrible...  It really wasn't.  But he left feeling odd about the whole thing.  He didn't know what to make of what had been said to him.  He was so far removed from dealing with people socially, he couldn't for the life of him tell if that was just friendly kindness, or if it was something else.
It ignores a good deal of what the “Epilogue” led us to believe, though some parts I’m keeping because it adds to the story. If you love the Epilogue and everything it represents don’t read this. ;) )
" Harry spluttered the word out in shock, then started laughing at himself for it.
“Stop, Potter.”  Draco said sharply, turning his head to glare at the other man.  “Just stop.  I don't want to talk about it, and if you insist on forcing me to I'm likely to have another panic attack and then I'll be useless for this thing with Nott for another few days.  Leave it.”
"But then he did come back..."
“Draco, I...  I'm sorry...”  Harry said, turning his eyes away and exhaling a long breath.  “Really.  You're right...  You'd think I'd learn by now.”
“Well.. We really aren't supposed to be socializing with any of the people that are being protected.  But even he recognizes that someone is going to HAVE to in order to teach everyone what they need to know to live in the Muggle world.”
He could tell as he spoke that this time, at least, while talking in a self depreciating way that made his skin crawl, that he'd managed to say something that was alright.  The young man seemed to warm to him then, and much to Draco's dismay a look of obvious pity crossed his face.
He turned his head, looking towards the back of the class where Harry sat with Ron and Hermione, as always.  The dark haired boy was writing something, but after a moment he raised his head and saw Draco looking at him.  He arched one eyebrow and raised his hands like he was silently asking Draco who he was choosing before he went back to writing.
“Draco.... Did you hear what I said?”
"I suppose there's never been anything worth having just for myself."  Harry said with a small shrug, absently picking up Draco's quill to fiddle with.
"Then..  How..?"
He'd felt absolutely agonizing guilt for having let five years pass without doing anything.  Five years he could have been looking for Draco.  But he'd had to step back.  He'd had to take that break and once he'd actually started to rest, he'd realized just how badly he did need it.
“What he
"What's worse than a Howler?"
He looked at Harry, really looked at him.  Met his gaze and held it, measuring those steady dark eyes with his own.
“This cant be any different than a wizard restaurant.”  Draco said bitterly, still directing his words at the table.
“It's lovely..”  Draco said, at that point figuring she was some crazy lady who was just showing off the picture because she was proud.
Draco was more than a little floored by that.  That Harry and Kingsley had immediately jumped into action and were working so hard and so carefully for him and his family.
Draco snorted a soft laugh that he tried to squelch when the suspected vampire turned his shadowed eyes to him.  "Oh god he knows I'm laughing at him, let's go somewhere else...."
Now they were standing on opposite sides of the door.  Harry having predicted correctly that Draco was there and listening to him on the other side.
"Well...  Silver more than gold."  Harry said, tilting his head a bit as he looked at Draco, pleased when a ghost of a smile crossed his lips.
He found he was actually kind of glad that Ron and Hermione had to go to the front car and patrol for awhile on Prefect duty.  He was tired of talking about what Draco Malfoy was up to, and it seemed like no matter what the conversation had been about in the past few weeks, the other two always brought it back to that.
"Sure I could have.  But this was far more fun."
"I wanted to finish sometime tonight and you weren't going to run out of steam quickly.  Too distracting to work."  Harry said, then smiled and tilted his head a bit.  "And because Hermione told me what to do before I came up here so I didn't feel like it was fair that I knew the trick and you didn't."
“Have you put other people like me in not nice neighbourhoods?”  Draco turned his head a bit, enough to look up at Neville from the corner of his eye.  “Seems counter productive if you have.”
"There will be no need.  I am taking care of the situation."  Snape said smoothly.
The words came quietly, and from much closer behind him than Draco expected.  He turned his head a bit, just enough to glance over his shoulder and saw Harry just a mere couple of steps behind him.
"How did you know they would be here?"  He normally didn't plague his customers with questions but given the circumstances he felt he was owed at least a few answers.
Hermione nodded slowly, a deep line between her eyes forming as she spoke.  “I think I read somewhere that you can sort of link up Vanishing Cabinets.  They are primarily used for vanishing things, I think they were kind of a 'must have' for anyone on the wrong side of the war originally.  Not surprising Malfoy knows about them, really.  But if he can link them up and he wants it for a fast get away...  That MUST mean there's one in the castle somewhere, and he hopes to use it to link up with the one in Borgin and Burkes so he can get out of here quickly!”
DRACO'S POV
Draco stayed silent then as he walked to his destination and stopped, gesturing slightly to the vanishing cabinet that stood hulking in the midst of a toppled over pile of books.
They filled some sacks with trinkets and odds and ends and things that were distinctly strange and that Harry didn't want to look at.  He left out a few silver framed photos of Regulus, which Draco found odd and filed away to ask about sometime, like what happened with Kreacher.  But they were too busy sorting things for him to dwell much on it.
Draco- Ugh.  Don't.
Draco- UGH.
Neither of them knew that the phrase went through both of their heads that time, at the same time.  Draco's head fell forward and he looked down.  "Bullshit." He said, looking at the floor.
Draco turned away again and fell into step with Neville as they walked at a relaxed pace down the street.  He was imagining what it would be like to turn Malfoy Manor into flats.  How it would be divided up.  How it would look when it didn't just belong to him.
Draco's eyes went a little wide as he raised his head and Harry straightened up.  He took an unconscious step closer to the other boy.  "Acromantulas?" He said quietly, his eyes moving around the dark woods, only a small circle of it still lit by his wand lying on the ground.
Neville rolled his eyes, which made Draco smile and like him a little more.
“You'll have questions.”  Harry said, taking the remote and the note from Draco and setting them down so the other man would pay attention to him.  “I'll be coming back every other day or so until you really are well and fully settled.  No matter WHAT, don't talk to the Aurors.  Don't ask them questions.  Wait until I come back and I'll answer everything for you.”
What if Harry changed his allegiance? What if it was brought about accidentally? What if no one, not Harry, not his friends, not Borgin, not Voldemort, had any intention of it happening... But it did.
Draco shook his head, exhaling a breath sharply.  "To think you've come this far with them as it is.  You're loyal, I'll give you that."
They walked in silence towards the woods and Draco paused at the edge while Harry walked right into them.  The taller boy stopped after a few meters when he realized he was alone before he turned back to look at Draco.  "I'm not doing this alone, this is your fault."
He opened it carefully, sliding what seemed to be some squishy sort of material to keep it safe off the top before pulling the silvery square out.  It didn't really... look like anything he had seen in the window of the shop...  But he seemed to recall that you had to open them.  They unfolded to show the screen and what he was pretty sure was called a keyboard.
An all night conversation...
The pink spots on Draco's cheeks deepened to close to crimson, his eyes dropping for a moment as his hand reached out further, opened, and the chain returned into his palm.
Only then did Draco smile and let out a long sigh, withdrawing his hands from behind his back.  His wand was clutched in one of them, snatched from Harry's pocket when he 'fell' and used the other man to hold himself up.
Harry smiled, giving Draco's hand a squeeze in thanks for not even asking him what he was thinking about.  “I did... He was VERY disappointed in me for not getting Slughorn's memory.”  He said with a sigh.  “I hope that we hear from Tom again soon.  I didn't even know what to say to Dumbledore.  I had to stutter and hang my head and act like I felt so ashamed.”
“What is this...”  He asked, tilting his head to look at the sandwich that was on his plate.
"Don't shout, Draco, you might attract attention to yourself."  Harry said with a smirk, folding his arms across his chest.  But he frowned after a few moments as he watched the smaller boy.  "You're really scared."
"Everyone talks, things filter around.  The poor care of The Boy Who Lived is definitely something that makes it from ear to ear."
Even though he did admit what he said painted a humorous mental image.
Cold crept into Draco's chest, and he reflexively raised his chin up a bit as he gave Harry the same haughty stare that had been delivered to him since the first year.
"Scrumptious."  Prue pronounced it as she tasted it, shaking her head with a smile, going in for another bite.  "Remarkable."
"Why so little?"  Harry asked, once again suspicious, his chin raising a bit.  "What does it do?"
When Draco didn't respond and didn't move, Harry reached over for the other boy's arm.  Draco let him pull it forward but didn't watch him do it.  Harry felt him stiffen as he started to inch his sleeve up, he looked around to make sure no one was watching and Draco's arm was hidden by the table before he moved the sleeve right up his arm and looked down.
"Where are you going?!  You can't LEAVE me here like this!"  Draco yelled at Harry's retreating feet.
“Hello again, Tom.”  He said and looked over at Draco when the blonde took in a sharp breath of air.
"Leave getting an Owl with me?"  Harry said, squeezing Draco's hands as he looked at him.  "We want absolutely no trace of you on this.  Nothing that could ever really be traced to you.  No one in their right mind would suspect I'd be helping you.  So if anything ever happened they might trace it to me, but it won't go past that."
Draco tilted his head a bit, holding his hand out to Harry.  "I can help you there."
But this time he didn't end up in the orphanage.  He wasn't anywhere he recognized, though something about it seemed to nudge at him as oddly familiar.  Like a room he had read about in a book that he was now walking around inside.  He followed the hall he was in, wide and panelled richly in dark wood.  There were sconces on the walls, the fire lit in them oddly static, glowing without flickering.  He wasn't sure if that was because this was something of a dream or if they were magic and supposed to be that way.
Tom's tone grew sharper, his eyes which were fixed intensely on Harry's seemed to take on a slightly reddish tint.
But this time his mother had come without warning.  She had come because she'd heard a rumour that Draco had been seen with Harry sitting in a park eating chips and looking very comfortable together.
Which Draco rather liked.

treatment than anyone else.  And THIS was it...
Some people threw things at him.
Fate has some sort of sick sense of humour.  Or at least it certainly seems that way when Draco walks into the Prefects bathroom late at night and finds none other than Harry Potter already in the massive tub.  What sort of cruel cosmic joke IS this??
April of Year 6.  Draco keeps disappearing and Harry manages to corner him to question him.  But if he wants answers, he has to pay for them.
Harry tilted his head to look at it, smiling a little more.  "You didn't pawn it off on Crabbe or Goyle to take for you?"
"You write an absolutely shit essay."  Draco said with a grin that was bordering on dark it was so pleased.  "I'll write a really great one.  Then we copy each other's work and I'll hand in the bad essay while you hand in the really good one.  When you get a terrible grade for the good essay I wrote, and I get a great grade for the bad one you wrote, we have our proof."
"French toast, raspberry and cream and coffee cake."  Draco repeated, slightly more deadpan as he looked at Paul levelly.
He wasn't sure if he could leave her alone with him.  But he also wasn't sure if he could live here with them both again.  With Astoria and Scorpius as well, because they would have to come back.  They'd have to pretend every day.
“We can hope.”  Harry said, pausing for a moment.  “I do hope.”
"I don't know that I want it."  Harry said honestly, he wasn't sure if he wanted it at all.  "But regardless of what memories or feelings people have of it, it's a piece of history.  Bad things might have happened there but it seems wrong to just have it auctioned off to the highest bidder.  It should be at least sort of maintained.  Who knows if it might be needed in the future?"
This time he did look over his shoulder to make sure Harry was walking with him.  He didn't think he could handle any more surprises that night.
“I don’t think it’s funny.” Harry said at once rather sharply, immediately regretting it when Draco startled, a slight fear creeping into his silver eyes.  Harry softened his gaze, one hand instinctively reaching out to touch Draco’s arm, just for a moment before he dropped it down again.  “I mean, I don’t think you... I mean anyone.. should let a parent off so easily, for damage they’ve done.  I do love my father but I also rather hate the prejudice he somehow instilled in me.  It’s not all his fault but I don’t ignore the fact that he put some of it there.”
I always absolutely HATED how Harry approached Slughorn to get the memory from him at first.  Harry's not an idiot, I don't understand why it seemed appropriate he'd act like one and just go charging off to ask him about Horcruxes the same way Tom did.  He'd seen the memory and had seen the way Slughorn tried to hide the truth.  It was so ridiculous that he'd not even attempt to be covert in his approach and ultimately scare Slughorn away from him.  Ugh.  UGH!  In my version Harry doesn't behave like a feeble minded oaf.  ;)
“I know you didn’t mean that.  But I did.  I doubt you would have had such issues with Slytherin as a house if is wasn’t for me.”
"You know how risky that was?" Harry spat the words out, even as his anger ebbed away seeing the other boy.  "What if I wasn't alone?"
“I taught you about television, didn't I?”  Neville's smile turned slightly quirky as he swallowed his coffee.
"No...?"  Harry shook his head, his brows knitting slightly as he tried to recall anything he might have heard.  But nothing came to him.  It had actually been years since anyone had even said the name 'Malfoy' to him, even if he did think the name daily.  This pricked his senses.  If Ron and Hermione were talking to him about this, maybe now, finally, they had utterly forgotten his 'madness' right after the war.
But it's the night time conversation in the hallway, and a trip to the Room of Requirement that truly starts to peel back more layers, making this new friendship deeper.  Creating trust between them both that could well and truly start to turn the tides of the impending War...
"The whole point of a question like that is to make you try and choose between two things you don't like.  You HAVE to find the least offensive option between two equally shitty choices.  Which you did, obviously.  You'd have to put up with listening to her talk and shriek and bitch and moan, but you'd be awfully well fed."
“Draco, do you WANT to kill Dumbledore?”
“Unless they're in the Room of Requirement.”
“It isn't that.”  Draco said, knitting his fingers together like he didn't know what to do with his hands. He chuckled softly after a moment and tilted his head a bit.  “Well, okay, it isn't JUST that.  Not having a wand.  Not having any sort of defence if something happened.. It's an incredibly difficult feeling.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who thinks so, and I know I'm not the only one in this position.”
“So you know about Horcruxes..”  Harry said, taking off his own tie and shrugging out of his robes to be more comfortable.  “Tom said you had to tell me about them.”  He made his voice purposefully teasing as he spoke, nudging the other boy a bit.
Impossibly blue eyes, dark hair, and features that had been slightly more squared off where his own came to sharper points.  It was like staring at the past... Almost.  He was older now, he could see that.  Just like he was, of course, but he looked so much the same that it gave Draco's heart a particularly hard wrench.
Basically, all he ended up having an opinion on was his phone colour, and the case that went on it to protect it.
“You aren't mad.”
"What the fuck are YOU doing here?"
Draco faltered.  His eyes had gone wide as Harry said the words 'Vanishing Cabinet', making it clear he DID know what he'd been in Borgin & Burkes for.
"You're welcome."  Harry pushed off the wall, smiling as he moved closer to Draco, looking the small ways up to his face.  "It's still going to take some planning and some work but..."
He would have felt worse about it but Theodore hadn't tried to contact him, either.  He knew both of Nott's parents had been sent to Azkaban just as his own had, so they were in much the same situation.  Maybe Nott had gone through something similar to him.  He was already a very paranoid person to start with, chances are that hadn't improved in the last seven years.  In fact it had probably gotten much worse.
Draco- You underestimated me, I suppose.  What else is new.
”And found nothing.” Draco whispered to him, smirking now, shifting under the heavy hands that held him fast.  “If you curse me now.  If you hurt me in any way. You’ll do nothing to strengthen your story to anyone who CAN stop me.”
“I'm easily adaptable.  I always have been.”  Draco said, not at all comfortable with Harry being even vaguely complimentary to him.
Draco nodded slowly as he looked around as well, then sighed as he looked back at Harry with an expression of uncertainty.  “Nothing I've done has had any impact on the cabinet, though.  And I don't know just how hard Borgin is actually trying to fix it on his end.”
"I never said it was a small task, I said it was one we needed help with.  I find it strange that you would make an Unbreakable Vow to help Draco kill Dumbledore if he couldn't do it himself, but you seem to balk at the idea of a clear line of communication."
long time.  And I never in a million years would have guessed I'd see him again while he was angrily justifying something I'd done."
Harry was having the time of his life.
Then the inside of his thigh before he reached further...
"So you say.  But you haven't exactly given Draco any details about how you're going to handle it.  Don't stand against him having a way of communicating with his
He'd never meant to stay at Grimmauld Place, but after the first year he realized that as the legal owner of the home he could actually move things around.  The portraits weren't up with a permanent sticking charm after all and he'd spent several weeks taking them all down and stacking them in the basement.  With their presence removed the house suddenly felt different...  And for the next six months after that he worked hard, erasing every last trace of the Black's from the house and doing it over for himself.
But after several minutes passed with nothing where he was,  and a walk around the main floor to see if he could hear the bells from somewhere else, he decided that what he was looking for wasn't in the house.
"He actually...  He intends to die, though."
They hefted the portrait across the long basement where Keacher directed them, leaning it against the wall facing inwards, but on enough of an incline that Kreacher could slide between it and the wall to see his old Mistress.
Draco- Potter Stinks.
"I know."  Harry said, pushing himself to stand up straight against the wall, starting to pull his hands away from Draco's chest, but stopped when the blonde held them fast with his own.
“Well it is perfectly safe in here, but you don't have to be in imminent danger to have a panic attack.  It could come from something we were talking about.  You giving up your wand or Neville or the war..”
But now he couldn't help but wonder, considering the coin HAD been in Malfoy Manor.
"We can't keep doing this." He said bluntly, which was how Draco tended to approach most things.  Head on, straight to the point, nothing delicate at all.  And immediate.  He made decisions like lightning, fast and sharp and often destructive.
“And do you wish to carry out that task?”  Tom asked, once again looking at Draco even as he spoke to Harry.
“Come off, Draco.  You saw him...  Don't tell me you wouldn't like to get 'creative' with Tom Riddle.”
Dumbledore was speaking carefully and firmly, nodding as he spoke.  Harry was not about to disagree at all.
They stayed where they were, grasping tight to each other, looking at nothing but each other's eyes.  Both seeming to dare each other to look away in the heat of this very intimate moment.  But neither of them did.
"To what end, though?"  Draco asked, sitting up after the touch and slide of Harry's fingers had made him shiver in a way that had nothing to do with cold.  "What am I looking for from him exactly?"
"I must say," Dumbledore said after a few solid minutes of silence, lowering his hands and smiling at bit at Harry.  "Between the two of you, you've actually come up with some very good ideas.  They are not fool proof, but nothing we do in this situation is.  Nothing we could plan would be without risk, and so the best course of action is simply the one that seems to have the least amount of risk."
Whatever Harry had found out, considering how long it had taken him, likely wasn't good.  There was nothing that could be done.
--------
"Hm..." Draco tilted his head a bit, his eyes narrowing slightly in mischievous thought.  "We could catch him out."
That was what he wanted, he thought.  A laptop of some kind...  When he looked at pictures on his phone of 'computers' he managed to figure out what a 'desktop' was and what a 'laptop' was.  Laptops looked more his speed...
If there is one thing that can be said about Harry and Draco, it's that their rivalry is nothing short of explosive. And sometimes rivalry like that can turn into something more. They don't have to like each other to be drawn to each other...
"Is it still there?"  Draco was reaching for his wand, but stopped when Harry shook his head.
"You are not."
"Good help is hard to find.  I mean, they're clearly serving good purpose, but if you set them loose on their own, you're asking too much."  Harry said, smirking and arching one eyebrow a bit.
His hand raised, probing at his scar that had started to tingle very slightly, making him feel that he and Draco were perhaps not the only ones in this conversation.  He turned his eyes to meet Draco's and tapped his scar a couple of times, holding his gaze and hoping that he would understand without him saying anything.
He left the day his parents stood trial.  He waited, loitering in Diagon Alley with his sack full of treasure and suitcase full of the most normal items he owned, until the whispers started and he heard for certain that both of his parents were sentenced to life in Azkaban.
Draco only had a moment to gasp, his arm instinctively raising with his wand, before his back was slammed against the wall, knocking his wand from his hand and sending it clattering to the floor.
Draco tilted his head back against the couch, looking up towards the ceiling.  "We could just not be here."
“DRACO won the war!  If it hadn't been for him...  If he hadn't done what he did... It was him!  HE WON IT ALL!  How can you not understand how important it is to find him!?”  He had shouted this and much much more directly at the Minister for Magic.  Kingsley was in the middle of a meeting when Harry had burst into the room.  Wild eyed and absolutely on a tear, utterly oblivious to anyone else in the room he had raved at him about Draco for ten minutes before he finally had to have people remove him from the room.
With a smirk, Draco picked up his quill and smoothed the note from Harry out a bit so he could write his reply on the same parchment-
When his hands finally steadied completely, he slid out of bed and padded into the bathroom to turn on the shower.
He felt awfully driven to do it, though.  He wanted to know more now, SO much more...  He wanted every little bit of information he could get.
Draco stayed silent for a few moments, pretending like he was considering before he nodded, smiling at the dark haired boy.  "Fine.  Is it formal?"
The shop keeper sniffed in a particularly insulted way that drove home to Harry that he was well and truly tired of the Malfoys.  Maybe Draco in particular.  And that was a feeling he understood.
That was satisfying, at least.
He hadn't paid one lick of attention to anything they officials had been saying or anything he was signing.  If Harry said he signed something, there was every possibility that he did.
“I feel perfectly fine, thank you.  I just don't feel like trying to justify why I want something or need to know something to you anymore.”  He snapped at Harry, rather viciously and sharply.  He'd held his tongue on being rude before, but even just the gentle prod was enough to send him over the edge.
“Potter, I doubt that would make any difference.  And if I did decide to talk to someone about it, it wouldn't be you.  And I don't mean that to be an asshole or to be offensive, it's just fact.  I wouldn't talk to you about this any more than you'd sit down and talk to me if you were struggling with something of the same kind.”
He inhaled and held the air in his lungs as he closed his eyes.
Draco hesitated, raising his eyes to meet Harry’s, looking into them for a long few moments, searching them rather deeply before he reached to take out the wand he was currently using.  He raised it and Harry could see a slight shake in his hand that steadied after a moment before he flicked his wrist and all but whispered
------------------------------------------------------------------
"I'm following you but also not if this isn't a long term plan."  Harry said with a frown, then relaxed a bit when he saw Draco hesitate, reaching forward a little more to smooth his hand up the other boy's leg gently.  "If it's a good plan and you'd rather I don't know, that's fine.  This about you being able to talk to your mom when you need to.  I don't absolutely have to be involved."
Unbidden, and without any lead up or warning, panic slammed Draco hard.  It seemed to knock the wind out of him like a physical blow, hearing Neville say what he did.  His hands shot out across the counter, knocking over his coffee cup as they scrabbled against the smooth surface trying to find something to clutch as his head spun and his lungs constricted.
And he also felt stupid for even wondering if it was something else.  Why would he even think that would be the case?
Again something that was supposed to be a one shot and it's becoming more. ;)
Draco had pushed Harry's hand off his mouth to speak.
After they'd helped Kreacher down to the basement with his new treasures and watched for a few minutes while he rummaged in the bags and started hopping around cramming things on dusty shelves and rock ledges, they went back upstairs and Draco got his coat on.
Harry shook his head, stepping closer again and leaning in to inhale close to Draco's hair, one hand resting on the smaller boy's thigh for balance without thinking of it.  "No it's quite nice, actually..."
"Stop it."  Draco said, covering himself with his hands, turning around to glare at the other boy.  "Why do you want to look so bad, huh?"
Harry's words were gentle and soft.  A cool wash of water over the heat of his anger.  He stopped his pacing so he could turn and look at the other man.
It was somehow both drab and tacky at the same time.  Small...  Made smaller by the large number of crates and boxes of his belongings piled haphazardly in the centre of each room.
"There's one more thing."  Harry said, taking a great amount of happiness in the look of pure loathing on Snape's face as the older man rounded on him to glare into his face.
Well...
And he certainly doesn't anticipate the obvious evidence of things missing from the shelves and tables within the Manor.
Draco frowned.  It was close to a pout really at what Harry said, making reference to the train at the start of sixth year.  He tilted his head back further, calling louder so his voice would carry.  "Hold a grudge much, Potter?"
“I'm sorry...  Electronics?”  Harry's brow furrowed as he watched Draco, his look clearly seeming to say he didn't know what to make of ANY of this.
He 'made' sugar crystals that looked like natural formed gemstone points in different blues and purples, creating a swirl of them from the top of the cake down to the bottom.  He methodically placed one by hand and a careful incantation put a few more where he was leaning in so it never showed that they seemed to grow onto the cake.
He recreated what he'd done yesterday, but three times over for his different layers of cake.  Dumping things into bowls, then using his wand to make them right.  Putting them into pans and tapping the oven so it cooked them perfectly.
"But the question is, Harry, do you trust me with this?  Because if you don't, I will not be offended and I will not become involved.  I trust you, I think your judgement is good and your reasons and motive justified and well placed.  So should you just need me as someone to throw ideas at and receive counsel, that is fine."
Draco nodded as he got up from the couch, a little wobbly but perfectly passable for being alright.  He fixed another cup of coffee for Neville, adding in milk as he had seen the other man do earlier.
Harry looked at Draco, meeting his grey eyes that were silver in the moonlight, quiet for a few moments before he leaned in enough to nudge his shoulder against Draco's.  “Breathe.”  He said, smiling slightly when the taller boy took in a deep breath.
"It doesn't have to mean anything."  Draco ventured when the silence stretched again.  "We've been getting along so well.  It won't change anything that you know.  I knew and we did fine..."
!?”  Draco practically shouted the words.  Neighbours be damned if they overheard.  He instinctively put his hand over the hilt of his wand where it was sticking out of his pocket.  “I certainly did not agree to that.”
"Oh shut up, Malfoy."  Harry growled, walking faster and making it harder for the smaller blonde to keep up.
Chocolate...  Ganache?  He thought that was what it was supposed to be.  Merlin, it was hard to think with so much going on.
“Easy..” Neville said, loosening his arms around Draco as the other man stood up on his own, but not removing them.  “Are you okay?  You're breathing but.. Merlin you're pale.  And that's saying a lot considering how pale you normally are...”
The knock, when it came, still made Draco jump.  He knew they were coming, but he still startled, still took in a sharp breath.
"You too."  Harry said, raising a hand to wave a final goodbye to the blonde before he ducked out into the hall.
"In the flowerbed...  Why?"  Draco shook his head, shifting a bit to settle more comfortably in the arm chair.
It came out in such a conversational and genial tone that Draco was clearly startled.  He stayed silent for a few moments and Harry watched his pale eyebrows knit together, clearly trying to find Harry's angle in this.  When he couldn't seem to find anything to scoff back at, Draco held up his hand that had a scroll in it.  "Professor Snape wanted McGonagall to have this."
Harry pushed his glasses up, then reached out to touch Draco's cheek, then moved his hand down to clasp around his left forearm, squeezing it firmly but not really hard.
Harry frowned for a second, watching Draco's retreating form.  "Talk later, maybe?"  He couldn't help calling hopefully after Draco, smiling when the blonde turned to look at him again.
He turned on the spot and apparated home, figuring there was nothing else he could do that evening.  He thought about it most of the night, but it wasn't until he had woken the next morning that he had an actual concrete idea.
It was so dark.  A night with heavy clouds so neither stars nor moon could be seen, let alone share light with the ground.  Harry stood on the covered bridge, his hands in his pockets as he waited.
A spilled cup of coffee...
Dumbledore had already pulled a scroll of parchment towards himself and was writing.  Harry watched him without looking at the words and Dumbledore must have known he could trust him as he did nothing to shield them.
It wasn't a soft romantic kiss as far as kisses went.  It was demanding and hard and deep. Immediately deep.  They clung to each other so hard and so tightly that both of their arms ached, but they still held on...
For awhile after his parents trial, people did talk about him.  They wondered what had become of him.  No one knew for sure, and somewhere along the line it started circulating that he had actually died in the war.  He had been reported alive but no one had seen him for certain after that night so perhaps he had actually perished.
This IS the worst case scenario....
They kill Dumbledore and then... What?
Draco gave Harry a nasty look, then held his hand out.  “Give me the money you said you were going to.  I'll go and pay.”
But there was something fluttering in his stomach as Paul and Prue walked to his bench, the look on Paul's face turned from smarmy and self satisfied to more than a little surprised when he saw the visually flawless and perfect cake, his eyebrows shooting upwards.
Eventually Draco scoffed, turning to continue walking when he couldn't think of a thing to say in response, which made him far more uncomfortable than he wanted to admit.
"I'm not here to play games.  I'm here for answers.  Tell me, now.  What did Draco Malfoy come in here, what did he want fixed?"
Draco leaned his back against the bottom of the couch, having seated himself on the floor while he pressed the buttons on the 'remote' to flip through the different 'channels' on the television.  Looking around, he was quite satisfied with what 24 hours and a wand had done with his flat.  He hadn't done anything that was truly untoward and
Harry watched him pick up his things, waving at him in a bit of a confusion as Draco left, waiting until he was gone before he turned the parchment over in his hand to read it.
