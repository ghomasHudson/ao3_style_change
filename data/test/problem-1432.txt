“Good morning,” he greeted, taking in the ambience of the room and the person’s looks. He had a vague idea of having seen them before, at Hogwarts, and he could see the resemblance of the face in his mind with the image of a Slytherin tie.
“Sorry, Mrs. Weasley, but I severed all contact with my so-called father and changed my name to Black.” Draco spoke softly, and Harry heard a slight shakiness in his voice.
As Draco Flooed home, he heard a few shouts about careless drivers and lyrics of pop and rock songs. It seemed like the man was listening to the car stereo while driving home. This suggested that the man might be a Muggleborn and could not live too far from London. People who avoided Apparating and Flooing were usually Muggleborns.
Harry felt relieved. He had seen in the last three days that he didn’t have to worry about the fact that  Mary was a witch as her father had been so loving and accommodating. Dudley had developed into a relative worth having, Harry realised with a sense of amazement. Precious was a woman with an extremely apt name. And if he could feel safe to come out to them, he would definitely invite them to stay at Grimmauld Place next time they were traveling to London.
“Of course not, it wouldn’t make sense to come and tell you, if I were the person who did it.” Draco was surprised at his own lack of anger with Weasley. But he knew that he would have been just as angry and asked the same kind of question, had Weasley told him of an attempt to spy on Pansy, Blaise, or Greg.
“Dempy, leave that to me. Let me think of something, I promise, I’ll come up with an idea.” He whispered, before they continued their way to the lab.
After a long afternoon of cleaning, baking for the next day with the elves and giving the gnome snacks, carrot pieces from the carrot cake, fruit slices and a little bit of crumble, Draco felt mentally exhausted. Whoever he was bonded to constantly thought very loud.
“And Hagrid, but you apologized to both when you were no longer under your father’s thumb. And the kind of Slytherin you are today I wouldn't mind sharing a House with.” Harry tried to form a block against the drain, using his own and an accessible part of Malfoy’s magic, he didn’t even know how he was able to do that.
Draco felt a very distinct twitch against the zipper of his trousers. Fuck! Potter had always been attractive with his emerald eyes, his black hair and his Seeker’s build, and as a grown man, his baritone voice. “You were my gay awakening.” Draco blurted out.
Harry had discussed it with Ginny, Luna, Ron and Hermione, who all had told him they trusted his judgement and would be on his side if anyone was to tell Malfoy bullshit. Ginny had said: “Even if Percy is my brother and the groom, he would catch my meanest bat-bogey hex if he insults your plus one. On the other hand, Merlin and Morgana have mercy on Malfoy if he doesn’t treat you perfectly well.”
In the background he heard Sirius bark a laugh and Professor Lupin say “like father like son” with a grin in his voice.
But apart from being a drama queen about colours (which also pertained to Harry’s clothes, it also meant that he had never been as well-dressed as since adopting Meowfoy), the cat was endearingly well-behaved. He only ever scratched at the sofa corner with the Thread-Go-Back charm, had his energy outbreaks only in his room, greeted him every time he came home happily and enjoyed his brushing sessions and the occasional belly rub. He seemed to have a sixth sense for Harry’s emotions and was good at grounding him if Harry was about to spiral and providing comfort and ease when he felt sad.
He decided to go to Creevey’s Stationery on Diagon Alley. Dennis Creevey had, at sixteen, decided that he was sick and tired of using parchment and quills, and had convinced Headmistress McGonagall that for him, and for the other left-handed students it would be a great improvement to write with a biro on paper. What had started out as an improvement for legibility of left-handed students soon became the new standard of writing at Hogwarts. Dennis had the capital to open his shop on Diagon Alley when he was directly out of Hogwarts due to finding investors who were glad their kids found it easier now to make legible notes and score better at their exams. And Dennis had invented a charm, that made paper as weather-resisting as parchment.
There were no pictures on the walls, and the whole space looked very impersonal. “How long have you lived here?” Bobby inquired finally after a moment of silence.
Draco noticed, after they both had decided to order vegetable pakoras for starters, that Potter turned the menu directly to the page with the vegetarian dishes. “Are you a vegetarian, too?”
Luna returned with a white cat in her arms and placed him on Harry’s lap. To his amazement, the cat just rolled up and purred, looking rather like a white fluffball. The shade of white looked just like Malfoy’s hair. But why did a cat make him think of Malfoy? Malfoy would hex him and not roll up on his lap and purr. Also, why would they allow Malfoy to become an Animagus?
They had spent one week in the holding cell together, and as there was nothing to do, they had talked. Liam had been the first person Draco had told his biggest secret: That he was gay. He was rather sure Pansy had figured it out, especially since they had always acted dramatically like a couple, exactly until the moment they were alone. He believed now that Pansy and he had had an unspoken arrangement to make each other look straighter than they were.
Draco forced himself to start running, if he headed for the same castle as the Granger-Weasleys, he could avoid Harry.
“Fucking Hippogriffshit!” Draco finally exclaimed. “How am I going to get home with my cat if he doesn’t want to tell your cat goodbye!”
The next time he looked over to Malfoy, the blond was resting his cheek on his arms and sleeping, his hair becoming undone by the sleeping position.
“I didn’t like your attitude towards my friends, but to be honest, you still were part of my bisexual awakening, although I was quite in denial of it.” Potter confessed, fidgeting with the napkin.
“Who are you and what have you done to Potter? Your behaviour is far too Slytherin.” Malfoy exclaimed softly as his magic tried to push Harry’s out.
Draco realised it at that moment, all the threat in Father’s gaze was nothing but a mask.  An Illusion that he could still intimidate Draco. But in reality Lucius Malfoy was just a wreck now.
“No, I can’t let him know before the wedding day. Even though the Armiger ring lies in a box on Draco’s desk, it’s still connected to Lucius, because he conducted a blood ritual before they took away his wand.” Harry sighed with exasperation.
Draco didn’t have words to reply; he just hugged his mother, feeling closer to happy than he had ever done since his early years at Hogwarts.
“That’s what I eat. That’s all my cooking skills amount to. The most elaborate thing I can cook is fried potatoes.” Draco looked down. At least he had cleaned his fridge yesterday and eaten the last potatoes. “When I was a kid, only house-elves could enter our kitchen. I learned that not everybody lived like that only when I came to Hogwarts, and spent more time away from my father, and my house teacher mentioned that his mother had to cook for his father.”
“That’s where you’re wrong.” Narcissa said softly. “He had to court a Pureblood woman, and propose to her. And she was forced to say yes. The Malfoy heir ring is a Q 3 artifact bound to a D 1 artifact, the Malfoy Armiger ring, and he can only take it off when he’s married. Before his trial, when he was still allowed to wear the Armiger, Lucius managed to give Draco a binding order to propose to a Pureblood witch, and cursed the heir ring to force him. The heir ring can only be taken off after getting married, when Draco will also be able to wear the Armiger ring.”
Only at the last moment, Lucius remembered that Miss Greengrass was sitting here with him. “Please, excuse me for a moment.”
The money he made with it, went completely into a foundation for Muggleborns who were injured during the war. For Draco, it was enough that he could spend some time gardening. It felt like he was healing the grounds gradually. He loved it.
“Uncle Harry? I have an uncle here, not in Ghana? We have relatives here?” Mary smiled at Harry, and suddenly flowers appeared in the air.
It just confirmed what Ron had always suspected: That there had been more to Harry’s spying on Malfoy in sixth year. By now, it was beyond the shadow of a doubt that Harry had lots of feelings for Malfoy, the way he was checking him out and acting with more bluster and swagger than he normally did. Had he ever acted like that before? Surely he hadn’t behaved like this around Ginny.
“I’m not sure he knew those charms himself. He was disowned and burnt out of the family tree at sixteen, and only got the house because his brother Regulus was already dead.”Potter sighed and led Draco into a not very refined but passable kitchen. “The Weasleys wanted to teach me their house charms, but we found out that the houses were built on different runic principles.” Draco sat down at the table. Potter made tea, his posture one of someone who had too many losses to mourn. Draco wished he could help him somehow.
Draco rolled his eyes, but they had a point there, it wasn’t a pleasant idea to have a choice between being ignored and being asked questions he had no idea about. It looked like cooperating with Potter and his entourage was the lesser evil. But why did his one and only ticket to an acceptable afterlife have to have the sexiest body in the whole world?
Harry burst into laughter. “If her plan had worked out, she wouldn’t have found out about any love life. I finally convinced Seamus that I don’t want to be set up on any blind dates ever again. She brought me together with Draco, but will hear it from the news the day we are ready to share it with the public.”
“Let’s dance, then,” Draco suggested, and although Harry was anything but confident in his dancing skills, he followed Draco to the dance floor.
“I believe, he’ll wake up soon. And he’s a very brave little cat. Before he came to Theophanu, he spent his first six months in the house of someone who didn’t treat him well. He still has a scar on his forehead from this time. It’s amazing how he overcomes his trauma. I believe he can help you overcome yours.” She brought out a rattling cat toy, and the little black cat stirred.
But if he asked Kreacher to wake him and give him the crane? Yes, that probably was his best option. He Accioed a piece of paper and wrote a message to Harry.
Lucius Malfoy, everyone has been better off since we’ve been free from you. Don’t you dare try to interfere with our lives! Draco glared at their father.
“Hey, darling. How was your morning?” Harry hugged him from behind, and Draco wondered where he had come from. After all, behind him was the way to the kitchen.
George Weasley clinked a fork against his glass and told everyone to go out and look at the fireworks.
But being bonded with Potter was completely unlikely, even though Draco felt something weird in his stomach at the thought.
“The white cat is mine. His name is Meowfoy. I don’t know the black cat’s name. They put Meowfoy into the room with them at the cattery.” Harry explained.
Although Luna was the kind of person who rarely cast a Tempus, she seemed to have a rather good sense of timing. As usual, Draco was surprised how precisely on time she arrived at the Manor. And he was grateful that she visited him at all, having been imprisoned in the dungeons during the war. “You changed the magic of every single room after your father’s imprisonment. And I am only in the Winter Garden, which was least affected because the dittany your mother grew here actively unravelled dark magic.” She would always tell him when he brought up his gratitude.
Harry mumbled something like Accio Meowth, and a hissing Meow flew into his arms. “Sorry, darling, but you know, Teddy is coming over and having dinner with us.”
As soon as he felt in control of himself again, he vanished the mess and fell into a dreamless sleep.
With a flick of his wand, he started his magic-compatible CD player, and Freddie Mercury’s voice filled the room, he lowered the volume, but when Malfoy didn’t speak or do anything else encouraging a conversation, he hummed along under his breath to Delilah, and moved to the music while flipping the pancakes.
“I just got back into bed. You slept so deep and didn’t even hear the owls.” Harry gave them a tender look, then reached over to the bedside table. “Good news first or the letter from your father first? Don’t worry, I checked it for threats with all the detection methods Ron taught me.”
Luna was dressed in her typical unorthodox style, and his mother was wearing a modest  dress, but her posture made her still look like a grande dame.
Why had Luna forced this correspondence on him with her big eyes and her talk of imaginary creatures? Fuck it! It wasn’t that Luna had really forced him, he could have said no, only that he was completely incapable of turning down anything Luna would ever suggest. Luna was the daughter of his father’s disowned nonbinary sibling who had been brave enough to take their wife’s name at the wedding.
“Guess we must face the hippogriff and arrange for a playdate.” Harry mumbled barely loud enough in resignation.
Harry decided to ask George about it. He remembered vaguely that Ron had told him about a perfume potion that George had sold to a shampoo company in France, some business the Delacours invested in, but it had sounded rather boring to him, as he didn’t really use beauty products.
“Rule number three. Potions are to be brewed only in the Lab. I’ll vanish any potion brewing utensils I find in the kitchen.” Draco had never seen Po… Harry look so stern.
“Lucky Pawter,” Draco mumbled under his breath. “I wish I had someone to cuddle with once in a while. But no, Father made sure I would never get to be loved.”
“I’m fine, but if you don’t mind, you know, Draco is my best friend and it feels awkward if his flatmate is on last name terms with me. Also, thank you for finally getting him out of the Manor.” Parkinson’s voice sounded weak as if she were summoning all her courage to make conversation. That was probably the case, as they hadn’t had much contact after her letter of apology in their eighth year.
“No, I wanted to be his friend the first time I saw him, but I insulted two people he cared about. Then, of course, he didn’t want to be my friend. And I was a sore loser when he rejected my friendship and decided if we can’t be friends, we must be nemeses. I was such a dramatic kid. It was not until fourth year when I realized that I was attracted to him. But by then Voldemort was back. And, of course, the boy was on the Light side.” Draco looked down.
“I’m not good at buying things for myself, and most especially clothes. My school robes were the first things I owned that were not hand-me-downs from my cousin.” He muttered in a low voice. Everything in Potter’s voice and tense pose revealed that it was difficult for him to speak about it.
“I think I’ll have a little chat with Kingsley about Dawlish when this is over. Because I asked and you had the right to have visitors.” Harry growled.
They did all sorts of joking around with the costumes and props for Luna’s theatre group that found their way into my wardrobe because there’s no space for them anywhere else. Imagine a posh-looking grey-haired man in a niffler onesie lifting the hood up high, so it won’t tousle his hair. One of them, who was wearing higher heels than Louise Delacour, put on my Quidditch leathers, and one of his colleagues gave him a piggyback ride.
Both looked at him. “Why would I be happy?” Astoria asked back. “My father sold my hand in marriage as if I weren’t a person. For a fucking holiday cottage near Stonehenge!”
Merlin’s balls! Did life have to torment him with having to eavesdrop on some lucky Auror bloke getting a blow job, while all he had for his pleasure were his hands, a fleshlight and a plug?
Harry stared at his clock. QI had almost begun, and Malfoy was still not around. This was not normal, and this was unlike that day when they had bought the dressrobes together, when Harry had thought Draco felt embarrassed by his own words. No, this time, nothing special had happened, and they had bantered about their favourite Quidditch teams in the morning.
This chapter is a bit sad; we reach the peak of the angst; but I promise the next chapter will bring hope.
“Lucky sod. With Oliver on the national team, the World Quidditch League determines when we’re allowed to shag.  He had to sign in his contract that bottoming is only allowed off-season. That’s what you get from being out and proud. Now that’s nitpicking.” Percy had rolled his eyes at the thought.
Unlike what Draco had expected, the house rules were quite what he would have set as rules if it had been in his own house – with the one difference of equally dividing up housework. At home, he would do a sixth of the work and the other five sixths were done by the house-elves, but only if there were no guests around, because the elves wouldn’t let him once there were guests. But then, they were not in their employer’s house now.
“Mr. Harry Potter is knowing Mr. Draco Malfoy very well.” Dempy looked into Harry’s eyes in a mixture of hope and worry. Harry gently squeezed the elf’s shoulder in a reassuring manner.
And if he was honest with himself, he had to thank Ginevra Weasley for knowing who was hugging him as if he were an old friend of them and not Deatheater scum. Because it had been Ginevra who had insisted on a televisual, when Luna and she had moved in together. He was amazed that he remembered the men so well after watching their show only once.
Karamo put a hand on his arm. “Giving and getting hugs is a healthy thing. And regardless of your past, you deserve to accept love into your life.”
“So you save lives on your job.” Karamo added more colourful Legos. “Draco, can you look at the scales?”
“Good morning, handsome.” Draco picked up his wand, turned around, cast breath freshener charms on both of them and then kissed Harry soundly. Harry’s lips and his tongue felt perfect. Without even interrupting the kiss, Harry banished their t-shirts to the chair. He peppered little kisses across Draco’s neck and chest, then licked across Draco’s left nipple.
“Draco, long time, how is your hair salon in Muggle London doing? I’m happy you’re here with Harry.” Arthur shook hands with Draco cordially. “Harry, Draco was the best at the rehabilitation program. He really got interested in rock culture.”
“May I suggest a fake date with a good-looking bloke who is currently negotiating with WWN Visual for the Magical British franchise of Queer Eye? You’d love him.” Emily rested one hand on Harry’s shoulder. Malfoy seemed to choke on air. Maybe Malfoy fancied the bloke.
A closing door somewhere woke Harry up. The familiar sound of footsteps on the stairs revealed to him that Draco was on his way downstairs. Harry went to the en-suite, considered having a wank, but decided that it would be highly inappropriate to wank in Draco’s personal rooms, and opted to take an icy shower instead. Then, he got dressed and headed out.
“Why would you meditate in a cupboard? It’s not a room.” Draco asked. If Harry hadn’t looked so scared, Draco would have assumed that he was having him on.
He looked into Harry’s eyes and felt like a flower that had been in the dark for too long but had finally been brought out into a sunny spot.
“He isn’t even aware of the bond, I think. At least, he isn’t as straight as the Prophet wants us to believe. Nor is Ginevra Weasley.” Draco told Greg the whole story, leaving only the wanking out.
“No, I’m not.” Astoria loathed the fact that when it came to young women the only thing every person of her parents’ generation had on their minds were marriage prospects. She had never felt the desire to get married. A man would never compare to the majesty of the stars.
“The last thing I heard from my cousin, who turned out better than his parents, is that their house is haunted by a ghost who has lots of fun with them. The ghost sounds quite familiar. I think it’s Fred, Ron’s brother.”  Harry reached for Draco’s hand, and Draco pulled him into a comforting embrace.
“I know what you mean. Oh, fuck!” How did Draco spill his secret so fast? Well, yes, he was registered, he had registered his Animagus form in France, and the British Ministry had been obliged to accept his registration. But he hardly ever transformed. Also, he felt like he had no right to use his Animagus form.
Meanwhile, Antoni had started looking at the kitchen. There was a Muggle fridge, an oven and stove with a kettle on top, and a microwave.
Last time we had tea together, you told me the Manor felt so empty without your mother in it, and I have found a way to ease that loneliness at least a little. We both know that you can really solve the problem of your loneliness completely yourself, and while I have an idea of what you could do to fight the infestation of solitari that built their nest around you, I know you are not ready to do that and would rather deal with it much later on, if I even as much as told you about it.
“Let’s turn to the good things you did in your life so far. What are you proud of doing? Put Legos for it on the empty scale pan.” Karamo lifted the box with the colourful Legos towards Draco.
“But – but I might do or say something creepy again. I’m not ready to lose Harry’s friendship because I…” He paused for a moment in contemplation and walked over to the portrait, leant closer and whispered “feel too much.”
Draco woke up, feeling soft breaths against the back of his neck. So, it wasn’t a dream! Prongs really was Harry Potter! He felt giddy at the thought that the two men he had developed feelings for were one and the same person. They had talked, kissed and cuddled for hours yesterday, until they fell asleep in each other’s arms.
magic,” Harry whispered back, then regretted saying it. What if Dudley was going to love his daughter less for having magic?
And today was probably going to be a whole lot of more trouble in the cafeteria. It was Valentine’s Day after all, and he had to watch all the displays of interdepartmental declarations of love, knowing very well that there were only three wix in this country and one abroad who cared about him. One of them was his mother, one was very lesbian, one was happily married to a Muggle, and the other one was very aro ace.
Please, if it is somehow possible, visit me as soon as possible and spend a few days here; I won’t accept his courtship if you don’t get along with him.
He asked the shop assistant if they had any clothes designed by Akasha Gupta. Draco loved Akasha Gupta robes, but they weren’t suitable for his pale skin, while they just seemed to be made for Potter. Akasha Gupta combined modern British robe cuts with the rich colours and fabrics of Indian clothes.
Draco should feel at ease, but their stomach kept on churning. Why was Harry nervous? Had they done something wrong? Or was Harry in danger? Or Ron? Were the Aurors investigating something that might be connected to Draco’s parents? Draco had to pull themself together and get on the fucking stage. They could talk to Harry afterwards.
“This house is being affecting even house elves. Mr. Draco Malfoy is not being supposed to live here, he is being supposed to have the house decontaminated.” Resignation sounded from Dempy’s voice.
the third program, was in its fourth day. The house had been sold out the last three days. Blaise had informed them earlier that day that tonight would be no different, concluding from the number of reservations.
Draco nearly lost it with Pawter during the next 24 hours. The cat sat stubbornly beside the chimney they had flooed in through, and yowled mournfully, and, what was worse, it only increased in pitch throughout the rest of the day. When Pansy came over in the evening, she had to say things repeatedly because it was difficult to be heard over Pawter’s complaints.
“Then, get dressed and start courting him, Mr. Draco.” Kreacher piped up. He held out the outfit to Draco.
“I can’t tell you much except that it had drops in a green web around its eyes and smelled of artificial flowers. Its mane was between yellow and grey. And its voice sounds like a flying stinger.”
Karamo asked: “Can I adjust the scale to what you just told me and to the fact that during most of the things you put on the guilt pan you were underage and during the rest barely of age?”
“After your trial, it was no longer Rowena Baker in charge of who was allowed to visit you, but Dawlish. He didn’t allow you to get visitors. But he told me you didn’t want to see me, I only learned shortly before Christmas from Tonsy who cleans the DMLE rooms that you would have liked me to visit you. I thought it was too late. I thought I had failed you twice. Once by kissing you without your consent, and once by not finding a way to talk to you.” Harry’s voice sounded shaky.
“Pans, shouldn’t you be with Astoria, after all you’re one of the bridesmaids.” Draco looked at her incredulously.
As soon as the door was closed, Nippy, turned to Mick. “When they is releasing so many mating hormones, why is they arguing, why is they separating their cats?”
“Harry, if I can give you some advice, arrange playdates for Meow and Paw with Draco.” Mick said placatingly.
He massaged Harry’s scalp with shampoo so tenderly, it was the most relaxing feeling. The shampoo didn’t have the usual salon fragrance, but a different one, one that seemed to be exactly Malfoy’s cologne mixed with Treacle and the air above a Quidditch field.
“Mother, since when…” Draco’s voice sounded like a wounded animal. He had never told his mother that he was gay.
If he didn’t use magic, he could live a year. Maybe as many as four: if he was very careful see his son get married, and if Draco and his wife were fast, maybe get to know the name and gender of his first grandchild.
“Eighteen. I had one year of house arrest, but with the chance of finishing my education, then I studied Muggle microbiology and then healing in France, staying in a dorm at Uni. Later, when I had a chance to return here, I first moved into my mother’s suite, but I couldn’t stand it there. Nobody would rent a flat to me, so I moved into this hut.”
He remembered the decontamination of Grimmauld Place. It had taken two long years to decontaminate, during which he had lived first at the Burrow, until he had lost his patience with Molly trying to get Ginny and him back together. Then, he had moved to Dean and Seamus’ uncomfortable sofa, and then for over a year, Luna had persuaded her father to rent a room to him. Xeno had proved to be a bit too eccentric for Harry’s liking but until Ginny had told her mother that she would never get together with a man again, that she just didn’t fancy men at all, he had managed. Finally, Harry had been able to move back to the Burrow, when Arthur had convinced her that their way of getting a son-in-law was not recruiting Harry for the position but Harry’s future boyfriend. It had helped that all Weasley siblings, even Percy, told her that they saw Harry as a brother.
“What do you think? Should we tell the public that we’re going to get married, too? Or should they only hear that we’re in a relationship?” Harry asked.
It would make me happy to see you in person if you were still ready to see your friend Opaleye in me. However, there is a big risk that as soon as you see me face to face, you will immediately hate me, and I’d rather not see your face if I learned that you do so.
“We have an empty guest room as our second daughter Abbie is too small to want a room of her own. Do you have a family of your own, too?” Dudley looked shy, as he asked.
“The Golden Boy is the persona the press wants you to be. I know better than to assume that you were him.” Draco said quietly, so only Potter could hear. Shame flooded through him, thinking about all the times in the past when he had fed into the gossip.
“And then… well, I think I should tell Harry alone first and have him decide how much of it to tell you. It’s rather…” Draco trailed off. This wasn’t easy to talk about.
“I can afford either the decontamination or the rent of an apartment with a potions lab. You know, with the things I brew for a living, I need more lab safety than for brewing Pepperup. My vault isn’t quite as large these days.” Draco said admittedly, lowering his head.
“Potter and Weasley aren’t around. I’ll call Auror Smith, and you can tell him.” Smith was one of the worst from the DMLE crowd.
“We have a special guest tonight. You know who you are. But this song is especially for you.” Draco smirked at their father, then sat down at the piano and started playing. The band chimed in, and Draco began to sing
She put her handbag on the kitchen table, hugged Potter hello, then shook Draco’s hand as if it wasn’t unusual. “I brought food, and then we have to run some tests.”
“You told me that your relatives didn’t want you, but you never told me how abusive they were.” Draco knew very well why Harry hadn’t told him back then. He might have believed that his father had a point in his views, unlike now, when Draco had contact with Muggles like Keiko and knew that one abusive couple was not representative for Muggles in general. “I wish my father had gotten them instead of all those innocent Muggles.”
“Mmh, I’m the luckiest bloke on earth. I get to marry the most gorgeous” kiss “amazing” kiss “witty” kiss “and sexy person.” He ran his finger across Draco’s chest, and the zipper charm parted.
“We’ve just had our first date yesterday, but I’ve known him since we were eleven, and I have yet to see a side of him that I don’t love. So, I bet that I can love everything of him.” Draco blushed.
“Put on your suit. We have to go through with it.” Draco sighed. “And don’t forget to cast a glamour. It’s unbecoming that the guests see the anger in your eyes. They might get scared, and it’s not their fault my father is a git of the worst sort.”
“I can’t. I’m here for work, not as an Auror, I quit the Aurors, but as an estate agent. The owner died and her heir wants to sell the house.” Harry locked eyes with Malfoy in a silent challenge.
Meow struck out, but without using his claws. Then he snuggled into Harry’s arms, obviously understanding the meaning of ‘Teddy.’
“We could also hyphenate and tell them both our family histories,”Harry smiled softly at them. “The good things and the bad. They’ll know about your family, about mine, and about their mother’s. We’ll tell them about the stories of our ancestors who built little niches of love in the stream of history. Anyway, look at how the press reacted to our engagement. It’s the first time the Daily Prophet got it right.”
Draco looked at their left arm, at their tattoo. The Dark Mark was still there, but Dean had given them a session with a Muggle tattoo artist for their last birthday.  The artist had tattooed in rainbow colours and in Dean’s handwriting above the Mark:
Nippy blushed and smiled. “Mr. Draco Malfoy, Nippy is being happy to meet you and happy to have taken care of Paw. He is being such a lovely cat.”
“Good designer dressrobes do that, Potter, not that you would know. The designers weave in a charm to make them as comfortable as jogger bottoms while making you look your best.”
“Harry Potter. At least you’re bonded to a decent man.” Greg sighed sympathetically. “I’m sure he won’t blame it on you and look for the person who sicced the gnome on him. You can trust him.”
She took takeaway out of her handbag. “I hope you like Vietnamese food, Malfoy. I’m in the Sub-Department of Statistics, Magical Phenomena Squad. We deal with the influence of magical phenomena on the lives of Wix.”
In an atypical bout of impulsiveness, he penned an answer, asking Luna to come over in the evening. His mind was made up that if the cat wasn’t the most awful creature or repulsed by Draco, he would be his cat. After all, he did long for some living being to cuddle with once in a while.
In reply, Sirius mumbled something that sounded a lot like “It’s about time you got laid, Prongslet. Can’t have you being prudish forever.”
“Malfoy’s cat? Bree, did you book Malfoy into the last room?” They gave her a stern look. “Because I booked Harry Potter in.”
The car stopped at a traffic light, and Karamo narrated: “Draco was nominated by his cousin Luna. He is a potions master and microbiologist at St. Mungo’s, and lives alone, Luna says. Apart from occasionally visiting her and his Saturday lunch with his mother, Draco only moves between the hospital and home. He wears clothes that used to be very posh, but are beginning to get threadbare, because the only new things he bought in the last ten years are labcoats. He doesn’t want to be like his father, who is a bigoted racist obsessed with the most expensive outfits.”
He took an icy shower, drank a triple espresso, and dressed up. The worry about the date still made him want to claw off his skin, but he had to pull himself together. His mind went a mile a minute thinking about how he could avoid the disaster that was bound to happen when Prongs would see him. After all no restyling could delete his past.
“I saw the hero and I saw the awkward boy in his too big clothes and the boy who was happy to go on adventures with his friends, and Merlin was I pissed off that you didn’t want me to be among your friends! When I wanted you so much to be mine. I was a fucking idiot! I should have wanted to be yours. I wish I could be worthy of being yours. But I never was.”
In the following weeks, they fell into a routine in each other’s life. In the mornings, just after getting dressed, Draco and Pawter would floo to 12 Grimmauld Place. Every other day, Dempy would Apparate in with an impressive breakfast, and the day it wasn’t breakfast it would be dinner. They would bicker over their breakfast, but instead of annoying each other, it would feel rather – nice, to be honest, very nice, Draco mused.
The tension between his best friend and the other stubborn git made Ron want to crawl out of his skin, douse them with Veritaserum and ask the right questions or simply grab them and shake them, yelling “fucking admit that you guys fancy each other!” At this point he would not mind seeing them shag on the breakfast table if only Harry stopped making himself unhappy. Not that he wanted to see Draco Malfoy’s ferrety pale cock, a decent cock would look at least a few shades darker, (Yes, Ron was very bisexual as another escapade Hermione and he had had recently with Lee Jordan had left no shadow of a doubt of) but if that paleness was Harry’s kink who was Ron to kinkshame.
“Actually, there are only a few rules, and most of them are about communication and one is about where you can brew next week. My first rule is you’ll stop calling me by my last name. I believe flatmates should be on first name terms.”
Rule number one: “It should elicit laughter from our valued customers”, didn’t help a bit. Neither did two: “No lingering effects, it’s a prank, not a curse”, three: “A good prank is like a song, not too short and not too long”, or four: “A Wheeze will never humiliate, shame, degrade, injure, or manipulate”. But Five! “If it doesn’t work, what alternative means could achieve the same effect? If Harry took Felix Felicis? No, that wouldn’t work, Harry was allergic to ginkgo aphids, and she wasn’t sure if the ginkgo leaves in the Felix Felicis were without aphids.
“Oh, shit!” Ron exclaimed and subtly pointed at Lucius Malfoy. “Seamus, look who’s there. Why of all nights, does he have to be here tonight?”
It turned out, I inherited my hair structure from my mother’s side. With my father’s A+ parenting, I’d rather be my mother’s spitting image than my father’s. (Although, I’d say I look by far more masculine.) She may have been on potions during both wars and also in between and may therefore have obeyed him unconditionally until the day the elves no longer put the potion into her morning tea, but I know she loves me, and she always did. She used what strength she had to protect me and to help me be as much of myself as was possible. And since the end of the war, she has supported me in everything, including the fact that I’m gay. She even went to Pride to Muggle London with me, wearing a “Proud of my gay son” t-shirt.
The face of the ancient elf seemed to light up and looked ten years younger. “Are you going to court Harry?”
“Storey will be happy to hear it. And I guess you can look forward to receiving a  wedding invitation soon. Would you like to get your cat settled to rest after their journey today? I'm sure when they wake up, they'll want to explore the grounds a bit"
“That’s their deadname. And I think you can show them that you are fine with them being nonbinary. I rely on you.” She put her hand on Draco’s shoulder.
He ascended the stairs to look at the mezzanine, where there was the sitting room, a large kitchen, and a room that could be used as dining room or an office. Or, if there was someone in the family with difficulties with climbing stairs, as a bedroom. It was big enough for any of these purposes. Opposite the spare room was a fully furnished bathroom with an easily accessible shower. The kitchen and bathroom overlooked the front garden, as he saw when he opened the fir green shutters.
Draco hesitated, and Dempy whispered in his ear: “Mr. Draco Malfoy should be doing what he is doing when he has been saying something embarrassing to Ms. Pansy Parkinson. Pretend nothing happened until someone brings it up.”
As Harry waited for Malfoy in front of the hair salon, he was glad that Malfoy had insisted on him wearing a suit with cufflinks. He would have twisted off his buttons if they were sewn on. It was a Muggle suit in a brilliant emerald colour, that he would never have dared put on without Malfoy encouraging him.
They levitated him off to his room and it felt like a déjà vu to him when Mary asked Harry to go to his room to try and sleep. The way over to it felt like the walk to Voldemort at the final battle knowing he was going to die. Except this time it was not him in danger but Draco and Harry felt like the worry would tear him apart. Once Harry was in his room he started pacing around it. He couldn’t help it he had a really bad feeling. He couldn’t tell how much time has passed and right when he started getting tired outside there were loud noises. He was awake at once again. Something was definitely going on but apparently someone locked his door. Harry tried desperately and worried to death to hear what was going on through the door but it was impossible. People were talking over one another, trying not to wake the other patients but some seemed to be in a state of panic. And then one of the Healers silenced the others and Harry heard the dreadful words.
Two healers stood in the room and talked to I assumed their trainees, though I couldn’t see the patient. I didn’t really care who it was because I would be out of here in no time. But just in case I didn’t I kinda wanted to make sure that I knew with what people I would have to deal. The nurse or what ever they were called here in the wizarding world smiled sympathetically at me as she showed me my room. I hated when they would give me these looks. Me, the savior of the wizarding world, being in the mental ward of St. Mungos. As if I was sick. Because I wasn’t. Hermione just wanted to make sure. I would be out here in no time when the healers noticed that everything was okay. I was just a little cautious but who wouldn’t be when they were followed by Deatheaters and Voldemort their whole life. I looked around warily when the nurse left me alone finally. Plain white walls with no pictures or posters. A boring looking table and an uncomfortable looking bed. As I looked around, I noticed tears coming up. I didn’t want to be here. I wanted to go home to Grimmauld place. I wanted to lay down in my bed. I even missed Kreacher. “Mr. Potter? If you don’t want to unpack now you can do that tonight before bedtime and look around now. We have a nice common room where the other patients are too. You can look around, talk to them and make friends if you want. Your family the Weasleys will come around tomorrow they already flooed.” I turned around and saw another nurse looking at me. She had brown hair put into a bun on top of her head and green eyes just like mine. She also had a pretty face and wore the white dress all the female nurses wore. I nodded shortly and followed her as she smiled at me. “Do you want us to call your Mr. Potter or Harry? We always ask that to make everyone comfortable. You can call me Mary by the way.” She said. She seemed nicer than the other Nurse that brought me in here. “You can call me Harry, thank you Mary.” I said shortly and looked round the hall again as we walked. All the walls were white, just a few paintings would be planted on the walls. And despite these paintings it looked stark. When we came into the common room, I looked around again. All the walls wee white except one that was black. It seemed to be one of those walls where you could write on with chalk. That was kinda odd because I recalled it being a muggle thing, but I didn’t really care. Some of the Patients stood at the wall and drew at it. There where flowers, people and even writing on there. At the other side of the room there where two couches and a bookshelf. “We just have five other patients here at the moment. At our chalk wall there are Martin, Damian and Sam. Olivia is the only girl here and she is in her room now. And over there I think you already know him from your time at Hogwarts is our lovely Draco.” She pointed to one of the couches. When I looked over, I couldn’t really believe my eyes at first. Sitting there was Malfoy, Draco Malfoy. His hair was still short as ever but not gelled back like he had his hair at school. It was falling into his eyes, but he didn’t pull it back. He looked over at us for a short moment and then let his look glide over to the window again. He wore a plain white shirt and grey…joggers? Draco Malfoy was wearing Muggle clothing. Am I sure I am really not dreaming? “…Harry?” Mary the nurse asked. “Hm? Sorry what was that?” I asked. She chuckled shortly and pointed at Draco again. “You could sit next to him, maybe talk a little bit and later he could show you the room we are eating in.” She said. When I nodded at her, still a little stunned, she smiled at me again and then left the room.
It was across from the dining room and If I remembered correctly the door was closed all the time I was here. When I looked around it looked almost exactly like every other room and especially like the common room with the only exception that It was smaller. Molly and Arthur Weasley looked up from their place at the window and Hermione and Ron jumped up from the couch they had been sitting on. Ginny stayed where she was. “Harry! How are you? We are so sorry that we put you here but…” “Mione let him breathe.” Arthur interrupted Miones tirade. While she talked, she had run to me and hugged me. I didn’t really like the feeling. When Hermione let go of me and I could breathe again it was only for a moment before Molly was there to strangle me too. I gave a little strangled noise when it became too much and after a moment Molly let go of me again. I looked at all of them for a moment. “When are we going home?” I asked then. Their looks turned from sad to sympathetic. “Harry…You didn’t even talk to the psychiatrist yet. We should wait for the diagnosis first.” While listening to Hermione’s explanations I felt panic grow inside me and something restricting my breathing. “But…I can’t stay here. I need to go home to take care of grimmauld place, water my plants and…I want to sleep in my own bed.” I felt myself being close to tears. Ron came over to me. “Hey...Hey Harry! Calm down. You’re going to be home so fast you wont even remember you were here. You just need to start talking with this psychiatrist and if they give you medicine you take it and your doing what they tell you and then you’ll be out of here in just a week or two I swear mate!” Ron put a Hand on my shoulder and I looked at him with tears clouding my vision. “But who will water my Plant? And who will take care of Kreacher and who…?”
“Lucky you, it must be amazing to be a felismouth.” Luna’s eyes looked even dreamier than they would usually.
“We can show him that taking care of himself fits in well with being better than his father!” Jonathan’s voice rang out with enthusiasm. “Let’s call this mission ‘the Dragon learns to fly.’”
Or the man was a crime scene specialist. After some problems, Potter, for example, had changed from Auror to crime scene specialist. Maybe not the best choice for his mental health, Draco supposed. After all, Potter still had to spend his working days looking at crimes. Maybe the man was a colleague of Potter’s, although, an Auror would surely be more likely to be targeted by a potion attack.
As Ginny stepped through the Floo in their living room, one look at Luna showed her that she was feeling sad, too. She was lying on the sofa and staring into a middle distance.
“I don’t know.” The gnome’s voice was high-pitched, but lower than an elf’s and very nasal. “I did what the big female told me.” He looked sort of sheepish—
“I think the Hippogriff nest is safe enough if you accept sharing with him,” Weasley addressed Potter now.
Happy tears welled up in Draco’s eyes when Harry used their stage name as a middle name. “Yes! I will, I love you!” There was so much more to say, and they would say it, but not on the stage in front of an audience in which there were at least two reporters.
“It definitely isn’t Obliviate. That’s the spell to make someone forget something. And she probably made you forget your name. What do you think, if I call you Cupid until we find a way to restore your memory?” Draco tried to ignore the obnoxious noises the gnome made while eating.
He couldn’t even pretend to do any brewing today so instead, he made an inventory of his ingredients, cleaned and sterilized all his empty jars, bought any ingredients that he was short on stock, more so than needed, as it exceeded his monthly ingredients  budget, but most of all, he had stared at imaginary points in his lab over the last week wondering if all he was doing was actually pointless. He rearranged all the ingredients of Pepperup Potion, the easiest potion he was selling. And the one that would run out first, then sat down, covered himself with a cozy warm blanket and finally laid down to have a break. His mind was spiraling.
“No, it’s Rita Skeeter. She doesn’t get her stories published as easily as before, now that people want real information since the Prophet group’s de facto monopoly is broken.” Hearing Ron say this, Draco was no longer surprised that Ron would sometimes speak at the Auror press conferences. He radiated professionalism. “People can find news in the Quibbler or get accurate information on WWN. She thought if she could uncover a story about your love life she would be back on top.”
“And I’m proud of you for planning to go to that wedding with your head lifted high and a date for the occasion and not letting that Finch-Fletchley bring you down.”
“You have changed since Hogwarts, and so have the Weasleys. And no matter if it’s you disrespecting them or they disrespecting you, I have zero tolerance for disrespect. The same rule is just as strict for them. Rule number five: We divide up the housework equally between all the people living here.”
But unlike most people, they treated him like any cafeteria employee, and not someone they suspected of spitting into their soup.
“Brat!” Harry pulled him in for a kiss, then walked with him into an alley and sidealonged him to Grimmauld Place.
“You look happy and confident, Emily. I’m proud of you.” Was it good to say that? Emily didn’t need Harry’s approval.
He prepared a valerian chamomile tea. He would rather have taken a dose of Dreamless Sleep, but he had harmed his health during the probation by excessive Dreamless Sleep consumption. After drinking his tea, he tried meditating, then lay down in his bed, but the last time he cast a Tempus it was 3.30 am.  When his wand alarm poked his shoulder, at 6 am, his head hurt, and his eyes burnt.
Emily leaned over and said, “Maybe it would be better for you if you went there with someone capable of making sarcastic remarks about Finch-Fletchley.”
Mick sat at their reception table, on one of the two comfortable office chairs. On the chair beside them, Nippy, the head of the house elf team sat, shifting from side to side. She was used to sitting on office chairs along with Mick by now, but it still made her nervous when they had to talk at the reception on a day a cat would be picked up; and this time, there were two cat owners going to come in and see her. Nippy held the sleeve of her blouse, that she had sprayed with catnip to her nose. If cats loved the scent, maybe it would attract another elf, too, as she had explained to Mick this morning.
“I like the Earl Grey better, but I usually prefer Chai latte.” He thought of drinking Chai latte with Sirius and hearing his godfather tell him stories about his parents and grandparents. Sirius had also taught him the three Indian recipes he had learned from Harry’s grandfather, Fleamont.
“Good morning, Malfoy. Did Paw yowl all night, too? Did he eat?” Harry just hoped Malfoy would be too tired to lash out.
It had been only after this that Draco had allowed themself to indulge in the idea that Harry was here to stay, that they weren’t just a bit of casual sex for Harry. And only from the conversations with Harry about this on, Draco had allowed themself to accept that their war trauma was valid. That they had been victimized by their father too, and even more by Bellatrix.
Luna smiled warmly. “She’s preparing for a match. I’m looking forward to Sunday, after it. You know, after every match, we take some time just for ourselves.”
“No problem. I’ve been seeing a mindhealer ever since those days, and I feel like I’m still not where I should be.” Harry thought of how often the mindhealer reminded him that he deserved good things in life, and how often he was not able to act upon her words.
He put the key with the hexagonal head into the lock and turned it. A scent that seemed vaguely familiar hit him. And he saw a corridor of Hogwarts before his inner eye and felt a wave of excitement, but he just couldn’t grasp what the exciting thing was. The memory was weirdly cut off, but there was this mix of adrenaline and feeling alive with it.
Draco took a few deep breaths. It didn’t help, but he had to say it. He stared into his teacup to avoid eye contact. “In the night, you had a – you had a wank. I heard your fantasy about Quidditch and silver eyes, and I felt on my body how you touched yourself. I’m – I’m sorry. I didn’t know yet, that it was you. I only found out in the morning, when you read the Daily Prophet.”
“Sorry about the state of the corridor.” Potter ruffled his hair with a sheepish look on his face.  “This mark is where a picture of my godfather’s bigoted mother was and yelled insults at everybody, and those marks...” Potter motioned to the opposite wall. “...are where we removed house elf heads and gave them a decent burial.”
When he washed out the hair potion, he didn’t cast any charms, and he used a shampoo that didn’t contain any straightening potions. Turns out, I have never seen my natural hair structure. At least not after my third birthday, when hair potions can be used on a child’s hair.
Draco rolled his eyes, but felt fondness for his best friend. “Pans, do you really think I don’t know that? You know about the DMLE’s behaviour towards me, from me.”
Draco went into the other room, which was now furnished as a sitting room and study. Here, too, the furniture was modern but made of natural wood. He looked at the blue sofa, and at the mural above it, a picture of a rainbow over a landscape in the Scottish Highlands. Draco smiled. This landscape reminded him of watching Potter near the Quidditch pitch.
Happy New year you all! This chapter is not as long as the others because I have problems with my Computer. Anyway I am glad I got this ready now. Have fun reading it. :)
Feeling a little bit unsure I walked over to Malfoy. “Mary is nice isn’t she? I really like her. She is the only one who really cares about me except maybe the healers and their trainees.” He said without looking away from the window. I looked at him for some time before sitting down on the couch next to him. “What are you looking at?” I asked because I couldn’t really see anything outside the window except a little pond in the back garden and a nurse with an old witch in a muggle wheelchair. “Somethings moving in that pond and I can’t really see what it is from here…” he answered me and I tried to see what he meant but nothing was moving in there. It was a tiny pond without fishes or anything. I couldn’t even see frogs. “I can’t see anything.” I said. He nodded. “I know…” I hesitated a moment before talking again. “So…Malfoy…why are you here? I heard your parents were put into Azkaban, but the daily prophet didn’t mention anything about you. Many people wondered about that because normally they write about anything. “The Aurors forbid them to write about me.” He murmured still looking at the pond. “But why? Hermione and me tried to get to you because we thought they would just throw you into Azkaban but they blocked us and didn’t let us see you or help you. And now I find you here. What happened to you?” At my words he looked over at me for the first time. His grey eyes were dull, the storm in them I remembered from school was gone. And again, I wondered what might have happened to him in the year nobody could find him. Well apparently, he was here all the time so he wasn’t really gone. “Why would you look for me? And why did you two want to help me? Why would you even have cared?” He asked and for the first time I could see emotions in his eyes. He was wondering, waiting for my answer. “You saved our lives back at the Manor because you didn’t rat me out to Voldemort and then you even let go of the wands. We didn’t want you to just be thrown into Azkaban.” I answered him. He looked at me for a long time, so long in fact that I started to think that he was gone in his mind when he started to smile at me. It was odd seeing Draco Malfoy smile especially it being directed at me, but it felt good at the same time. Anybody rarely smiled at me genuinely all they did was look at me concerned or smiling at me with pity in their eyes. Because they thought I was ill. But I wasn’t. “I’m here because I have the Fran Bow Syndrome. Do you know what that is?” He asked me. I wanted to shake my head before I remembered that the Healer talked about it when I first came in here. Malfoy must have been the patient in the room. So I nodded. “Well if you know you probably know why I am here. I mean its pretty obvious.” He said. I nodded again. “Yeah well…” I said. Draco looked out of the Window again, his eyes focused on the Pond. “I will be out here pretty fast again. I mean Hermione said I’m ill, but I am not. Once the Healers realize that I can go home.” I told him and he looked at me again after a few moments. “I thought the same thing when I came here first.” He said smiling. “But I think hoping is a good thing. I hope you get out of here fast.” Malfoy finished. I started smiling too. “Thank you, Malfoy.” I said. “Call me Draco please.” He said. “Okay…Draco, Thank you.” That sounded weird. Hopefully I would get used to that.
They were just preparing the drawing room with the tapestry for the bonding itself when Ron’s Animagus appeared. “Harry, there’s been an attempted attack. Quinn got the perp. Send me a message if your present state is safe for work.”
“Oh, Merlin and Morgana, this is perfect for you,” the mirror in the corner exclaimed, and Draco felt a pang of jealousy. He should be the one to praise Potter’s looks.
After bringing Pawter to Potter and having breakfast with the Golden Boy, Draco collapsed on his sofa with a sigh. He felt exhausted and fed up with having to pretend everything was alright. But he couldn’t bother other people  like that, most of all not Potter. All those things were his own problems. Not that there was nobody  he could talk about it to, Pansy and Blaise had heard enough of it already and Luna would just advise him to find a better place to live, but he had to stay in the Manor, what about his family legacy, what about saving his family’s reputation?
Thanks to @stonecoldhedwig for consulting me about the best Scottish word to use for Headmistress McGonagall's exclamation.
“One day, when I came back from the nursing home, there was a parcel on the table, and I assumed that Quipsy had left it there, that it was from Mother. I opened it, and inside was a box. When I touched it, a notice-me-not was lifted, and the last thing I saw before dying was Rabastan’s face. When I came to as a ghost, he told me that the best thing to hurt Mother was killing me and letting her not even get a body to bury. He had put the cursed box there.” The despair made Malfoy’s voice sound more ghostly.
“I knew you weren’t straight when all your letters in first year were pages after pages about Harry Potter. You could have been bisexual then, but, darling, when there was never a single letter that dedicated more than an obligatory phrase to a girl or woman’s attractivity, that was a clear sign. I’ve probably known it before you did. I never told your father, and he died thinking you would marry Astoria Greengrass, but I’m glad you’ll be free to marry whom you want.” She smiled softly in her endearing manner that Draco recognised as she tucked a small lock of hair behind his ears.
The sounds of steps on the stairs attracted Draco’s attention. Harry’s bare feet appeared in Draco’s line of view, then a large white towel slung low around Harry’s hips, a belly that Draco wanted to lick just like he had seen Meow lick Pawter’s belly. Perfect brown skin, with a stripe of dark hair leading from the navel down and disappearing under the towel. Draco quickly changed his sitting position and pulled the duvet up. He couldn’t let Harry see his asinine physical response. How could Harry not regret inviting him here if he got a boner just from Harry coming down the stairs barefoot and shirtless?
“I love how he ruffles his hair when he considers something,” Draco started slowly, but then he picked up. “How his green eyes shine when he is happy, his dry sense of humour, I love the way he moves and the way he talks. I love how surprised he looks when someone asks about his feelings about something. I loved that before the trial, and since I can hear thoughts of his, I know that nothing changed about it in the last years.”
Astoria looked at him quizzically. “Did Draco analyze the curses on his rings with you? He only told me about discussing the matter with Bill Weasley.”
“What does your royal highness want? Darjeeling first flush? Assam? Earl Grey? Oolong? Pu Erh? Matcha? Chai latte?” Harry snarked. It felt good.
“Follow me.” He pulled Draco into the house and into the guest room that had been built after the war, the room where he usually slept when he stayed overnight. He noticed that it was neater than he had ever seen it before, but then he was too busy undressing Draco to really give it a second thought.
“Er, I wanted to buy a present for my goddaughter, but of course. We can have a cup of coffee and catch up.” Had Mary not been there, he would have declined, but the girl made him curious. He distinctly remembered Uncle Vernon’s racist slurs, but Dudley had obviously a child with a black mother, maybe he had overcome some of his prejudices.
Harry put a beautiful gold-and silver ring with an emerald and a diamond on Draco’s finger, got up and they met in a sweet long kiss. Draco felt their cock stir up under the notice-me-not.
The end of the day lead to Mary skipping cheerfully alongside Dudley as they strolled to the local cafe to discuss the upcoming renovations.
“That’s enough, Malfoy. Firstly, Paw needs you. You’re his human, he might lose hope if you abandon him because you won’t get help. Secondly, I’m being selfish about watching QI with you.” He tried to focus his magic at Malfoy, to strengthen and support him against the dark residue draining life.
Draco gasped for breath. His fear of the situation mingled with Potter’s angry thoughts, and they were very similar: “Will I never be able to live in peace?” was a very dominant thought in both their minds. Draco feared having to live in some dodgy kind of safehouse for the foreseeable future.
“I never thought you would need to ask.” Luna’s face in the Floo had an expression Draco had never seen. It took him a while to conclude that it was her flabbergasted look. “I was sure you were familiar with Catford Cat and Kneazle cattery?”
That was unusual. Nobody ever wanted to go to Draco’s tiny cubicle. Usually, people activated a protean charm to make him come to them. It was not really good for the efficiency of his work, but what could he do? He was obliged to obey his superiors, and compensate for interruptions by working longer.
“Circe’s pierced nipples! You’re obtuse!” Pansy swore. At Narcissa’s stern look, she apologized and continued. “Have you ever heard someone mention reasonable political opinions in the most prominent place when they talk about their true love? You’d expect something like sexy, witty, or kind! But Draco’s only talking about political opinions and that she’s a very committed healer.”
“If I were still talking to mom and dad this would be the reason to cut the contact. But I haven’t talked to them since I started dating Mary’s mother. I practically live without a family apart from Precious and our two daughters. You can imagine why.” Dudley gave him a sad smile.
Harry entered the room feeling dread and excitement fight inside him. He could see Draco again. With hurried steps Harry storms into Dracos room and then comes to an abrupt stand when he sees Draco again. He looks….for a lack of a nicer word horrible. His hair is tousled too much as if he recently pushed his hand through it. He looks deadly white battling the bed sheets. His wrists and hands laying on the sheets in his lap are even more thinner than before. But the worst thing...The thing he has dreaded the most is the bandage over his eyes. It was recently changed so its cleanly white but it takes away his most lively feature. He looks like a doll propped on a bed and left there forgotten.
Draco looked like he wasn’t even breathing anymore and he stared straight ahead. “What’s wrong with him?” nobody seemed to pay attention to me. I saw Mary in the group of people running around the room. “Mary what is going on? Is he even breathing?!” Mary looked up at me, she seemed to be stressed and nervous which caused my stomach to turn slightly. “Harry you should go to your room, I will come by later to tell you everything okay?” Before I could say anything, Draco started screaming and when we looked over it looked like there was blood running down from his eyes like tears. His whole body shook violently and his muscles seemed to be spasming. Horrified, but not able to do anything I watched the Healers and Nurses work on him with spells to silence and calm him before they levitated him into the air and rushed with him out of the room. Then I stood there alone in the common room the screams of Draco still ringing inside my head.
As I walked into the common room again, I saw that Draco still sat on his usual place. That was odd because by now he should head off to his therapy lesson as well. I walked over to him and hesitantly put my hand on his shoulder. “Hey Draco. Are you coming? We should head to our therapy lessons. Hey…you there?“ I asked. He didn’t respond. I shook his shoulder a little bit and tried to get his attention, but he seemed to be completely gone. I started to panic by the time the Healers and Nurses noticed that something was wrong. I felt them pull me away from Draco, but I couldn’t take my eyes off of him. My breathing was ragged and I felt like I was run over by a herd of hippogriffs.
A few days later the Weasleys came to visit again. Harry sat down in the visiting rooms and talked with Hermione, Ron and Arthur while again Ginny sat silent in a corner. “Harry I talked with some of the nurses and they said that we could take you out to the garden.” Hermione said after some time. Harry started smiling excitedly. The idea of going outside was pretty nice. He didn’t leave this building for over a month now. “That’s nice! I would love to go outside! But can I...can I take Draco with me? He wasn’t outside for much longer than me. I think he would love the idea of going to the garden.” Harry asked. Hermione smiled and nodded.  “I don’t think that will be a problem. Speaking of Draco, I asked around the ministry but nobody really knew something about it. It seems that only some high Aurors know about this case. There’s something fishy going on.” Arthur explained.  Harry nodded. “I already thought so.” He said. Everyone stood up and exited the room and Harry walked straight over to Draco’s bedroom. His family followed him. When Harry opened the door Draco was reading a book and he looked up surprise showing on his face. “Harry. What are you doing here? Are the Weasleys already gone?” He asked. Harry shook his head. “No they’re still here. We want to go in the garden...Do you...are you free...you want to come with us?” harry asked a little bit unsure. He didn’t know if Draco wanted to spend time with the Weasleys since the two families weren’t really on good terms in the past. But Draco smiled and nodded. He stood up and followed me out of the room again. Hermione and Arthur shortly but politely greeted him and even Ron nodded shortly. Ginny, like always, ignored everyone. Draco fell in step beside Harry and they entered the garden. Harry closed his eyes for a moment to enjoy the sun and when he looked over to Draco he saw that he was doing the same. Harry started smiling. There was a warm feeling growing in his belly but he couldn’t really detect what it was so he brushed it aside. “Do you want to go look at the pond? You could see what’s in there and then you could stop worrying.” Harry asked Draco. Draco looked surprised for a second and then started smiling brightly before taking Harry’s arm and hurrying to the pond a few metres away. Ron, Arthur and Hermione went along and walked behind the two slowly. Harry and Draco stopped at the pond and Harry looked into it excited, what Draco would say was in there. Draco looked at something in the pond for a moment and then started to speak. “It’s just a Beetlepig...he just plays in the water. He’s not dangerous.” Draco seemed to breathe out. “What is a Beetlepig?” Hermione asked. “Mione! It’s a beetle and a pig! Isn’t that clear just by her name? ” Harry exclaimed in a good mood. And then Draco actually started laughing.
Exhausted I exited the room without saying goodbye to Dr. Grant. I closed the door after me and looked around until I found a magical clock hanging on the Wall over the exit of the ward. The numbers were hovering in the air there. It was almost time for Lunch. I didn’t really feel hungry but I didn’t want to leave Draco alone either. Most of the other Patients were on a trip today, when I asked Mary told me that usually we would be with them too but because of the Incident Draco had they didn’t want to let him go outside and because I wasn’t here long enough. And she said that I probably wouldn’t want to leave Draco alone anyway. She was right. I would never have left Draco alone after what had happened yesterday. And that’s where I was heading now: Draco. I entered the common room and stopped abruptly. Hermione, Ron and Arthur were standing in the middle of the room, looking around uncomfortably.  Draco was sitting in his corner of the room, again staring out of the window and as much as I loved my family at this moment I wished they would go away so I could sit next to Draco and listen to his meanless ramblings. While I was still lost in thought Hermione and Ron noticed that I entered the room. “Harry! How are you?” I sighed. That stupid question. Our talks were always about my feelings lately. They didn’t talk to me anymore about any other topic. I didn’t even know what was going on in their lifes anymore. I shrugged suddenly feeling even more tired than before. My gaze slipped over to Draco who looked over at me with a small smile before looking back out the window again. It made me feel better. Arthur seemed to have noticed the smile too. He came over to me and Ron and Hermione followed. “Is that Malfoy? At the Ministry nobody knows where he is and his records are lost. He never had his Death eater trial. What is he doing here?” “Draco is here for almost a year now. He said something about Aurors dumping him here.” Arthur, Ron and Hermione started frowning and I silently agreed to them. I did sound really strange. Something was wrong there. “I’m going to investigate that. It sounds like something was swept under the rug there.” Ron nodded. His hate for Slytherins vanished some time ago when Ginny started dating Blaise Zabini for some time. I still noticed how much we grew up at this moment. A few years ago Ron would have protested and said something like letting the death eater rot in here and I probably would have agreed with him. But now it was different. We were adults now. I wanted to talk to them for a little bit but suddenly Draco stood beside me. He was staring ahead as if he didn’t really see us. He probably didn’t. “It’s time for dinner Harry. They won’t wait for us and if we hurry up we are there before the others come back from their trip. Then we have all the food for us.” He already started walking while he was still speaking. I smiled involuntarily. “We are going then Harry. Have a good evening Harry, Malfoy” Hermione said smiling at me. “Good night Granger, Weasleys.” Draco’s voice came from the corridor. I said goodbye to them and then hurried back after Draco.
I am sorry this took so long. The problems with my computer is solved and I can write again. If you have questions or even suggestions of things you want to see you can leave a comment and I will gladly answer or work your ideas into this. :) Have a good day! :)
“The Fran Bow Syndrome is a mental illness from the wizarding world. The first time it appeared was in 1940, where it got its name from. A little girl, named Fran Bow Dagenhart, a muggle born how we later found out, developed this illness after her parents died at an accidental magic outburst of hers. Since none of the muggles could explain her symptoms, she was put into a muggle asylum. According to her medical record, Fran claimed that she could see dark shadowy figures that loomed over every human being she saw and the humans themselves would look scary, distorted and some were even displayed dead. She also said that she could speak to a creature she called Itward and that it would come by sometimes to see her. It is described to be a skeleton with a suit and a hat like a cylinder. Fran died when she broke out of the Asylum because she tried to find her cat. Patients that developed the same syndrome claim that sometimes they can see a cat’s tail that disappears around corners and objects. Until today nobody could find something to heal the Syndrome completely, the only thing we really know is that most muggle medicine and even some potions can worsen the effect of the symptoms. Mostly children develop the syndrome. They had to have endured some kind of trauma to develop the syndrome. It is mostly unheard of but sometimes teenagers or even young adults get this illness as well…” I heard from the room we walked by.
“How are you feeling today Harry?” I just shrugged. I didn’t know what to say to her. Dr. Grant. I didn’t even know her. Iona Grant my new psychologist she introduced herself as just minutes before. I felt uncomfortable knowing that she knew my name not only because I was harry Potter the boy who lived but also because she read my medical record. She looked at me for a long time before she adjusted her sitting position. “Harry...I assume I am allowed to call you that right?” I nodded shortly still not looking at her. “Harry. Since your here for the first time let’s just get to know each other okay? Or do you want to talk about anything?” She suggested. I shrugged again. “Let’s just get to know each other then.” She said. After a moment of silence she started talking again. “Should I begin?” I nodded. If I knew more about her maybe I could make sense of her. And maybe I wouldn’t feel so uncomfortable anymore.
I’m so sorry it took so long so much happened in the last few months we had a family death, a divorce is incoming, we moved and my depression flared up heavily again, so heavy in fact that I couldn’t move out of bed for almost a month. Anyway I’m better now and I finally got around to continue to write this I hope you enjoy :)
„It´s not that easy. You need to find out the source of the syndrome. The thing that set it going.” “but how...how do I do that?” Harry asks unsure of himself. He doesn’t know if he will be able to do it. But he promised. He promised Draco. And he wants to help him. He really does. Because he likes Draco. The thought strucks him just like that. Its just a tiny little thought in a wave full of thoughts but it stucks out like thunder. He. Likes. Draco. Not just likes him. He really likes him. Probably more than he should. He stores that thought away until he has time to think about it properly. “The syndrome must have developed in Dracos childhood due to a traumatic event. So we need to find out what exactly happened to him and then we need to find out the harder part of finding out why the syndrome hasnt shown itself until after puberty. Its something ive never seen before. The usual course of the syndrome is that the child experiences something traumatic and it opens their eyes to the five dimensions letting it developing the syndrome to protect their mind. The child usually then dies of suicide or because of some weird accidents either due to their own magical outbursts or things that don’t really seem to be their doing. Other patients told us that sometimes creatures called kamalas try to kill them and sometimes they succeed.” Harry swallows. That sounds so horrible. Even more horrible than his own childhood. “But...what horrendous thing has to happen that triggers the syndrome?” Harry is trying really hard to not think about it. He just hopes what he fears is not true. “Well...its mostly triggered by severe abuse cases be it physical or psychological. But sometimes...sometimes its sexual assault too. Lets just hope for the best harry and concentrate on you for now okay?” Harry feels tears prickle behind his eyes but he wont let him come. She is right. Just hope for the best. Lucius would never do such a thing right? And Narcissa would never let something like this happen to her only son right? ….
But he could! “It will take me some research in the Black library to find the specifics of this house, but then I can teach you. The Black properties and the Malfoy properties are built on the same principles.”
Beside him in the cell had been Liam Kim, who was maybe two or three years older than him, a former Ravenclaw, who had been on the light side of the war, but was bitten by Greyback and had not declared his lycanthropy infection. Had he declared it under Thicknesse, he would have been sent to Greyback’s pack or put down. And now he was on trial.
It had not only been Harry’s love helping Draco break free from their past.  With Harry, the Weasleys came into their life. And while every member of the Weasley family had threatened them with their own version of a harsh punishment should they hurt Harry, their brother in all but blood, as soon as the Weasleys had seen that Harry was happy with Draco, they protected Draco just as fiercely as their adopted family member.
A knock at the windowsill drew his attention. A graceful tawny owl with a dreamcatcher around his neck stood on the windowsill and awaited his beckoning.
Then, Weasley sat closer to Draco, and cast Legilimens. The uncomfortable feeling of someone prodding and poking around in his mind began. Draco was grateful that Weasley kept it limited to the events of February 14.
Draco heard the Golden Trio’s loud footsteps, then they entered the downstairs kitchen. He made himself dense enough to be visible in the hall.
As he wanted to open the sitting room shutters, he had the feeling that someone stood behind him. He drew his wand and turned around quickly.
“Ah, good morning, Mr. Potter, I see that you Apparated in.” Their voice was soft, with a slight Wizarding Southampton accent.
Draco cast a stasis charm on the sample. It would have been catastrophic if it dried out. He was glad that he had perfectioned his stasis charms. His charm for blood samples lasted for an impressive time of three days. And he was sure whatever this interruption was would not take that long.
“Nah, Daphne can help her better, also, I had to see my best friend and wish him good luck. Remember, I have something for you.” She pulled a small parcel from her pocket and put it in his hand.
With a crack that sounded a bit different from human apparition sounds Harry found himself and Malfoy on the doorsteps of Grimmauld Place. The door opened at his Alohomora, and he carried Malfoy directly into his living room. Only now did he notice the rest of the house-elves with bags of luggage that had followed him inside. Dempy levitated both of them on the sofa that another elf had changed to its bed function. “You both is having to have a lie-down. Voldyturd’s magic is being the most fucked up magic Dempy has ever seen.”
A sound from outside made Draco interrupt his pacing and moping. He checked his fly and listened up.
“One moment, Denise, I think, I’d better give Lucius here some great-grandfatherly advice. Looks like my son got the family into quite a mess with his unfortunate choices, and it took until Draco to find a Malfoy to have the courage and the brains to go their own way instead of stumbling madly after any megalomaniac who babbles nonsense about becoming, as your father would call it, überwizards.” Achilles gave Lucius a look like a stern teacher, and Lucius felt shamefully aware of the fact that he was sitting on the floor.>
Pawter and Meowfoy had a satisfying sex life with each other, but they would not stoop down to display their intercourse publicly. That was a doggish thing to do, and if someone had to teach Harry and Draco, Pawter and Meowfoy had no doubt, the dog-humans in the portrait would be less disinclined to instruct the grownup cubs.
“Harry, I’m so sorry. You gave me a place to stay, and then I…” Draco wanted to touch Harry’s shoulder but didn’t dare to.
“How did it happen?” Hermione interrupted the discussion between Harry and Malfoy about how to minimise the trouble of house buyers.
As Meow began purring loudly, Mick watched Harry. The man’s body language revealed coiled tension between annoyance while simultaneously unable to help himself with gazing across at Draco.
“Harry, could you please cast a strengthening charm on the bed and a silencing charm on our room; I think we shouldn’t have taken so much of the Love pastries,“ Hermione said under her breath.
“Okay, okay.” Draco opened the parcel and brought out a small vial with a gold-shimmering potion. He glared at it for a while, then whisper-yelled. “Felix Felicis? Have you forgotten that the Rhizoctonia Mandragorae in the Redirector Infatuationis potion and the sweet clover in the Felix Felicis form a toxin when they interact? I owe Astoria a satisfactory performance if we are supposed to get married and to … consummate our marriage.”
Lucius caught himself. “But - but shouldn’t a Malfoy have ambition? And all Draco does is strut around on that stage in women’s clothes, make jokes and si-”
“Come on, we’ll drive to your home. We’ve already arranged that with your boss,” Karamo said as the commotion slowed down a bit. Draco still felt overwhelmed. As many people had hugged him within five minutes than in all his life before. (His mother, Pansy, that one-night-stand in Muggle Bordeaux, Luna and Greg when he cried on his shoulder at Vince’s funeral – end of the list.)
“What the fuck were you doing? Why did you pour some weird liquid into my face and then crash land in it?” He whisper-yelled, as Mipsy cleaned his face with a wet cloth.
Harry cast an Animagum Revelio at the cat, earning him an indignant look, but also the knowledge that his new cat was no Animagus, just obviously a clever cat.
“Send a Patronus to Morag, Sylvester and Ivy. And then do your job as planned. Harry is counting on you. You can count on your team."
Pansy laughed. “Oh, Draco! Isn’t it time to overcome that schoolyard rivalry attitude? It could be good for you to open up and accept that Potter still plays an important role in your life. You name your beloved cat after him, and then you claim you hate him!”
But Harry wasn’t ready for prank stories. “What are you insinuating? Should I give my cat away to Malfoy of all people?”
He couldn’t keep still and eavesdrop any longer, his arm was falling asleep. With careful movements he stirred.
As soon as Weasley was out of Draco’s mind, Potter sent his Patronus to a person called Uche to bring a cup of tea. When she brought the tea and the chocolate, Potter didn’t, as expected, give them to Weasley, but pushed them in front of Draco. “It may be only Twinings, but it will help you feel better.” He gave Draco time to finish his tea, before casting his own Legilimens.
“Sorry, Draco,” George grinned in that way that revealed to Harry that he was not sorry but smug about a successful prank. “I can’t let you both keep believing this thing between you isn’t real, so I smuggled a Veritas toffee on your cake.” He handed Draco a candy “This is the antidote. Take it now, before someone from the Finch-Fletchleys asks what you thought of Mr. Binns-Fletchley’s speech.”
Please note that I added a warning for a mention of potions addiction. The person manages to stay sober despite temptation.
“Wouldn’t you help me most by leaving me alone?” Why did he have to sound so whiny when he wanted to sound like Snape, maybe. Who would take him seriously if he sounded like a spoilt brat?
“You really mean he isn’t straight?” Harry asked, only now grasping that Draco’s oversharing of Astoria’s virtues was somewhat unpersonal, and rather as if the blond tried to convince himself.
“Thank you, she’s fine, going to remarry next year.” Malfoy’s face seemed to soften at the mention of his mother.
They had never noticed what an apt description for Father this was. Father had seemed like a lighthouse in Draco’s childhood, something that was flashing up and reminding them of danger, indicating a shore, but never really safety. Where Mother’s presence had felt safe like a harbor, Father had been the feeling of ‘there is land and people out there, but one degree off route will be a deadly mistake.’
A few times, Draco had tried to send the man a thought, but the bond seemed to transmit only one way.
Today, I had the weirdest day in my life so far (and that includes the day Hagrid informed me that magic is real and I’m a wizard, as well as the day someone who wanted to get me into trouble signed me up for a competition I wasn’t really supposed to take part in), but I think it was weird in a good way.
The liquid Cupid had poured on his head was no Thames water, but some kind of bonding potion, and he was now bonded to a bloke who worked at the Ministry, most likely to an Auror.
That was the corner where the audience felt weird, there, on the right, at the back. Draco focused their eyes on what was going on back there and choked halfway through their next word.
“You both are free. Lily Potter was the daughter of Abigail Evans, née Greengrass, adopted by the Baker family.” Headmistress McGonagall slowly walked towards Astoria. “Abigail was the Squib daughter of your great-grandfather Ebenezer. And as Harry is a Greengrass by blood, Draco can marry him. I recommend though, that Draco and Harry use the Potter rings, if possible.”
“Then he gets married to Astoria, and you all will move on as if you had never tried to prevent it. The Armiger ring is only a D 1.” Narcissa said. “I know it would be hard emotionally, but I believe it won’t come to that.”
“They don’t calm down, do they?” Malfoy didn’t look Harry in the eyes, but Harry considered it already a little success that Malfoy didn’t insult him.
Harry, who had a shy look on his face and said in a very soft voice. “If you want to, I’ll be your bride. Your mother said that you had to promise that you’d propose to one of the Greengrasses and get married.You followed through with the proposal to Astoria but it's never specified that you have to marry her. I talked to her. She would rather marry Dennis Creevey. She only had to promise to say yes to your proposal and get engaged to you. You could break the engagement today and marry me. If you’re afraid of your aunt and cousin, I’ll take Polyjuice and look like her, and Officiant Abbott will know and someone can mess with the microphone, so we can include my name in the ceremony.”
He had noticed how Draco had stumbled through his show before.  Had made plans of using it to tell him clearly that this freakshow was not what a Malfoy should do, especially as he wasn’t even good at it. Then Draco had transfigured his jumpsuit - at least the jumpsuit had had trousers - into a dress that had an elegance that Narcissa could have worn during their courtship. But honestly, a dress! And Draco’s hair, it wasn’t a manly long hair, tied back strictly and straight, but the untamed curls of the Black family with a sparkling tiara! All the Malfoy ancestors would roll over in their graves at the thought of Draco dressing up, wearing makeup and playing Madame Eltanine!
When Draco found the courage to lift his eyes after a lengthy silence, Harry stared out of the window. “You didn’t choose to be involved in this. It’s not your fault. But those people who… They are lucky they aren’t here at this moment. I hope that it didn’t make you feel too uncomfortable.”
Draco closed his eyes and focussed his magic. Long hair fell on his shoulders. I don’t want to look like Father! He opened at his eyes and was amazed. His hair looked nothing like his father’s, despite having the same colour; it looked rather similar to his mother’s every morning before the hair charms and potions – loose waves, that curled at the tips.
Kreacher smiled with a softness Draco had hardly expected to see in the elf’s face. “Mr. Draco can rely on Kreacher. Kreacher is happy to see that Mr. Draco cares about Mr. Harry.”
“We’ll try out a few different ways of keeping it out of your face and your work, but first things first: Such gorgeous, silky blond curls need tender care. You need a lightweight shampoo and conditioner, and whenever possible, take the time to air dry your hair. What drying charm do you use?” Jonathan sprayed something at Draco’s hair.
“Yass, Queen, now we can see what gorgeous hair you’ve been hiding behind all that gel.” Jonathan picked up a comb with wide teeth and combed through it a bit. “It’s not unruly, it just has some cute natural curls. Prongs will have a hard time keeping his hands to himself when he sees your gorgeous hair. Could you imagine wearing it at shoulder length?”
In reality, Harry suffered from PTSD so severely he couldn’t function in the Aurors except as a public face, which he couldn’t do regardless since he hated giving speeches. And the reality of his legendary sexual experience consisted only of expert wanking and the knowledge that he was actually gay. He had some failed attempts at sex with Ginny on his list of sexual experiences before they had both admitted to themselves and each other “I love you, but your parts do nothing for me.” And he had an experience with a mutual handjob in a Muggle club loo, although it had just turned out that his one-off was a glamoured Zacharias Smith who had outed him in the Daily Prophet.
Pansy guided him into her flat above the Parks and Greg Café. Draco sat down on her sofa, as she went downstairs. Two minutes later she came back levitating a tray with hot Matcha chocolate and an assortment of cakes. “The way you look, you need the hard stuff.”
And dancing was a lot different and better if one could follow Draco’s lead. After they hadn’t left the dancefloor for a long time, Draco whispered into Harry’s ear, “I like leading on the dancefloor, but in bed I prefer when my partner tells me what to do.”
Meanwhile, Nippy conjured two chairs and summoned some special cat treats. “If Mr. Draco Malfoy and Mr. Harry Potter want they can be sitting down and be trying to offer Meow and Paw some treats. Cats is being easily reconciled with something delicious after their humans have been away for a while.”
When they had finished, Jonathan was waiting for them in the car to take Draco to a salon in Soho. He washed the gel out of Draco’s hair. “Your hair curls a little. It’s a waste to make it completely straight. The owner of this salon is a Squib. You can transfigure your hair longer than it is now, if you want to make the best of your hair structure.”
The cats took their time to show any interest in the treats after their rouse, and when they did, they didn’t go alone to their respective owners, but ambled side by side first to Harry, then to Draco, and both cats together tasted both treats, evading the hands that wanted to scoop them up.
Dear Readers, this fic is over now, but after a break due to fest fics and other things, I'm planning to return to Kitties Verse and write a sequel. Stay tuned; our boys and the kitties are still going to have some adventures.
“You do remember who we’re talking about?” Matthew sounded almost like a masculine version of Pansy. “This is Harry Potter, immune to flattery and bribery, but with an unlimited desire for a few things you have to give. You were born and raised by Mistress Narcissa, you have learned how to be witty from small. You like him, not his public image, I can see that when you say his name. And, tell me, what is it you love most about him?”
“This is your case. You have the right to get a lot of information on the results, as soon as having them won’t mess up the test.” Granger gave him a reassuring smile. “Call me Hermione. I think we have some acquaintances in common.”
“I – What if Prongs sees me and decides that he doesn’t even want to sit at a table with me. Prongs was on the Light side. He deserves someone better than me.” By now, tears streamed down Draco’s face.
The tune changed to the soft, elegant entrance of the bride, and Morag MacDougal sang the traditional song with her rich alto voice.
“Oi, he has become much more eloquent since he no longer has to focus all his strength on surviving and saving the world.”
Harry didn’t know why the Muggle job he took was that of a real estate agent. Why had he listened to that divination-obsessed bint? Four years ago, Parvati had told him to; she had insisted that he would find something he had lost by working in that business; and he had just known he needed a Muggle job if he wanted to avoid the unwelcome attention of the wizarding press on a daily basis. He couldn’t just go converting Sirius’ Galleons to Pounds all the time.
Jonathan smiled at him encouragingly. “Time to throw your father’s ghost out of your bathroom, then.”
As the second wave of Ministry employees came to eat, and Draco cleaned tables close to the people queuing for their food, suddenly, he heard someone yell. “Eww, what’s that? Ouch!”
If only Narcissa had done her duty better. Draco was thirty already! He should have married and sired an heir and a spare before now. But when he had told her yesterday, she had just laughed in his face, and her new husband had told him to leave lest he call the Aurors.
He gently kissed Draco’s forehead. “I’ll be back in a moment, but that eagle owl out there will break the window if I don’t open it soon.” Harry  exclaimed as he padded to the window.
“Draco, I don’t mean that type of special occasion. I mean occasions like dates, pub nights, or if you don’t have people to date or go to the pub with, St. Mungo’s Christmas Party.” Tan’s voice sounded exasperated but not unfriendly.
How are you this morning? How was your presentation at the international healers’ conference? I wish I could have been there. But I’m clueless about healing and needed a lot of tutoring to pass Potions at Hogwarts.
Harry put his hand on Dempy’s shoulder. “Let me guess, he’s too proud to ask a friend to let him stay with them for the time it takes?”
She told him the potion would wear off by itself at some time between in a few hours and in three days.
That was the voice in his head again. Talking about Quidditch? That feeling in his hand and his nipple, was it a result of that weird bond, too?
But I know from the few details you let me know that I’m proud of you. Some of my students have lycanthropy, and you make their lives so much easier.
It was a Muggle hair salon, at least Harry thought so. And he preferred Muggle places, especially since his dramatic breakup with Justin Finch-Fletchley, who after dating him for two years left him for Percy Weasley of all people. “He’s less chaotic and doesn’t have so much baggage.” Justin had said.
“Yay! He’s doing what he likes to do!” Tan said and high-fived Jonathan. They watched Draco stroke over the pale oakwood of his new dresser and then turn and touch the king-sized bed with the blue and sage coloured duvets.
“I won’t. At least not yet, and I’d rather avoid Obliviating people if I can. Did you hear Harry think of a Department I might or might not be in?” Granger’s voice sounded friendly, but could he trust her? He had never given her a reason to treat him well.
Before turning in for the night, Draco took his compendium of wizards’ health magic and looked up what he did wrong with his spellwork.
Draco deepened the kiss. Harry’s mouth tasted of coffee with cinnamon. As they came up for air, Draco asked: “Can we find a more comfortable place to take this to?”
“You have exactly the smitten kitten look on your face that James had for Lily.” Remus’ voice sounded shaky, and when Harry looked at him, he spotted a happy tear in Remus’ eye.
It was Draco’s voice, but it came from outside, rather like an echo of his voice, but Draco was sure that the anger wasn’t his.
On screen, Draco was standing in his bathroom, wearing a bathrobe and spraying saltwater spray into his hair.
A man, whose salt-and-pepper hair was combed into an elegant style, and whom he recognized from a picture Luna had shown him, approached him and pulled him into a hug. What was the man’s name again? Tawny? Bronze? No! Tan. Tan France. One of the hosts of Queer Eye. An American show that was now working on a season on WWN Televisual. Those who were going to occupy his groundskeeper hut. He had better pull himself together. Those men were only televisual celebrities, and no Dark Lords. He could do it.
“The owner of that other cat must become a friend of yours, Uncle Harry. It seems Meowfoy wants to marry the other cat.” Mary said sagely.
Harry gave him a reassuring smile. “That’s no problem if you have a sofa or a mattress where I can sleep.”
“I  -  I woke up – and – the board - had disappeared – and you were – spooning – me with – morning wood. And I pretended – that – I was still – asleep. Because I fancy you.” Harry cried.
The elf Apparated away, and after a minute, Malfoy knelt down on the hearth pillow. “Potter.” His voice sounded weary and resigned.
“And you think that we can see what’s off about this ghost? Harry, are you sure you aren’t just obsessing over Malfoy again?” The voice belonged to Granger, at least it wasn’t the Weaslette, or was she now Mrs. Potter?
After some time, the Floo chimed. It was Potter. “Malfoy, are you still brewing? Dinner is ready. I made Aloo Gobi. And Paw is waiting for you already.”
“May I introduce to you Uther Weasley,” Achilles lifted Weasley’s hand to his lips, then continued.”...bonded to me in matelotage. We had to borrow pirate customs back in the day, Your child will have it significantly easier when he…”
Draco carefully carried the gnome into the kitchen and sat down, holding him—as he saw now—carefully as not to hurt him, but at the same time tightly enough, so the gnome could not escape. He cast an Ennervate and waited for the gnome to look coherent again.
“I’ve cooperated with curse damage and we developed a potion to manage the effect of Jacques Bardian’s curse and restores the red blood cells’ ability to transmit oxygen,” Draco said shyly.
“Firstly, he’s working somewhere, and secondly, I said something utterly embarrassing, Dempy.” After mumbling these words, Draco asked the elves for help, and together they continued with housework.
“An Animagus can be around werewolves during the full moon without endangering themselves. My father and Sirius were Animagi to be there for Remus, I mean Professor Lupin during their time at Hogwarts.”
Draco’s comment showed Harry in what a bad state Malfoy really was. If he were to stay here for but one more night, Malfoy would die.
“I had been living here alone after Florence had broken her hip outside and was taken to hospital. I only found out she was in hospital when I sent Quipsy to find her. She knew about magic; she was a Squib, but the information about what family she was from was obliviated from her mind. If she had broken her hip at home, I could have healed it easily, but I wasn’t even around. And if I had healed her in hospital, it would have broken the fucking statute of secrecy, and I would have ended up in Azkaban. So, I had to accept that she was gone. I visited her in hospital and in the nursing home. All I could do was to cast pain relieving charms on her. It was so frustrating.”
“Guess this is as close to accepting our engagement as Father could get.” Draco noticed that they didn’t feel sad or angry. They simply didn’t care about Father’s opinion. But the mental image of themself and Harry being parents, was something different. “And he might even have a point about kids, but I’d rather give them your family name and a Potter family history to grow up identifying with.” Draco said pensively. “There is so much toxicity in the Malfoy family.”
Harry chuckled. He had grown very fond of Mary in the last two days. Dudley and Precious were very welcoming, and Harry saw that Precious had a very good influence on his cousin.
The more time passed the more Harry felt worried. What if something terrible had happened? Before he thought about it, he threw Floo powder into the chimney and shouted Malfoy Manor. Dempy answered the Floo twisting the sleeve of her matronly dress in her hand.
“Draco doesn’t want to meet Prongs in person. He says that Prongs would only hate him if he knew who was hiding behind the pseudonym.” Luna melted into Ginny’s embrace.
He had found out that if he failed to get Draco out of this marriage deal, he could wait for seven years and hope Draco would take him to be his affair on the side. If it was true that he was the man Draco wanted. He believed after what Pansy and Narcissa had said that Draco would be more likely to fancy him than to fancy Astoria, but they might also be mistaken. Draco might have fancied him at Hogwarts, that didn’t necessarily mean that he wanted more than the friendship they had. They had grown up after their Hogwarts years after all.
“Will you, Draco, talk to nobody but me, Harry and Ron about my real profession unless I allow you to, as long as I shall live.”
“Have you ever considered that Potter might be attracted to you, too?” Pansy took a small bite from her petit four.
He chewed resignedly and then answered her. “No, Dawlish is leaving me alone since the elves insisted that I’m essential for their loyalty at their last talks with the Beings Division. Smith must have been close to tearing off his own hair that day, as Ninty told me. I don’t know if I deserve the elves’ loyalty, but I’m grateful for it.”
“You lived in a manor with lots of antique furniture,” Bobby started the conversation. “What style period do you like best?”
“I nursed a ficus back to life from having only two leaves.” Draco took one green Lego and placed it on the pan.
“Who do you want to impress, handsome? On the one hand, they would be smitten if you go out like this and show your legs, but I know, you might not be in a situation where that’s an option.” The mirror answered in a bass voice.
“He’s healthy, but unfortunately he’s become friends with the cat of someone who’s always hated me. And I don’t know how to help him. I’m considering asking that man to sell his cat to me.” Harry said in a tired voice.
“Harry, I think we must postpone the cuddling, and maybe have a nap at noon, but now I have a letter to write.” Draco climbed out of bed, and Harry followed his elegant and lithe body with his eyes, as he crossed the room and went into the en suite.
Well, Draco didn’t smile. He was wearing his best poker face, which the Malfoy traditions valued more anyway. He assumed that his relatives never smiled in their wedding pictures because they too had to marry someone they didn’t love.
A soft touch on his shoulder interrupted his thoughts. He noticed that it felt different from the touches he was used to from Astoria, as if the hand was bigger, but probably that was just some weird effect of having the heirloom wedding bands in his pocket.
Then another spotlight illuminated the stairs on the other side of the stage, where Harry was standing, and Draco heard Freddie Mercury’s voice from the loudspeakers.
They faked a cough, went to the table that was hidden behind the piano, drank a sip of water and reminded themself that the show had to go on. If there was one good thing they had learned as a child it was to look perfectly normal while something scared the shit out of them. And this time they would fucking use that skill against their father.
In his younger years, Draco would have considered the gnome’s description of the person barmy, but working among the elves had taught him to take non-human creatures seriously. Now, he tried to learn about their culture before judging, so he could interpret their statements in relation to what he had learned.
“Nah, he wouldn’t alert Molly because you want to experiment with threesomes. Last year they forgot to block their Floo, and I firecalled while Angelina and George were making out with Leroy from Eeylops. But the idea that one’s brother or brother-in-law knows too well what goes on in your bedroom is still cringy.”  Harry placed the quiche in the oven and made tea.
Dennis stood behind the counter, leaning over towards a customer in a blue dress with dark blond hair. “I wish we could…”
“I came here to report witnessing a failed attack--against you. You had an incident with a strange transfigured Cupid who poured a liquid on you and tore out a strand of your hair on February 14, Potter.” Draco started.
“Fine, Storey told me to make sure I invite you and, if you have, your significant other to our next pub night on Friday at the G&S.” The G&S was a LGBTQ+ friendly pub in Little Compton Street, owned by the surprisingly successful business partners Marcus Flint and Seamus Finnegan, whose husbands’ professions were reflected in the interior; while most people would guess that Oliver’s sport accessories and Dean’s art would clash inside a pub, an anonymous interior architect managed to create a fusion that was comfortable and stylish. Yet rumour had it that Marcus and Seamus had to take an Unbreakable Vow not to reveal the genius’s identity to anyone. What everyone did know was that G&S stood for Godric and Salazar, and that it was considered the best LGBTQ+ pub in wizarding Britain.
Draco had watched with extreme fascination, on their first visit to the Burrow, how Percy and George had been engrossed in a controversy about the necessity of submitting the same form to four different departments of the Ministry to keep George’s business licence. The brothers had exchanged words like “nitpicking” and “criminal negligence”.   Their argument had gone on for three hours. Then George had broken into a wide smile, said “guess we agree to disagree again. I have to go home, Lee promised to babysit, and we haven’t had time for kink in quite a while. Comes with having a toddler.”
“I’m glad Mother gets to have a love match in her life now. With my father, it was a match due to potions and magical artifacts.” Harry was good at reading  Malfoy’s expression and believed that he was happy for his mother, but there was a tremendous sense of melancholy behind it. Was Malfoy sad with his life?
“If he can accept my financially limited and non-traditional means of courtship?” Draco feared that he didn’t have enough to offer.
“Hold on to me as if we were riding a broom together.” Harry said when they both were sitting on the bike. Then, Harry started it, and it moved forward making noise, then it even got off the ground.
“It’s the same with Harry. He says that once Opaleye finds out he’s not some demigod but a flawed, needy person, he will be gone before Harry can say ‘charm.’” Ginny felt desperate for her friend. ‘Needy’ was the adjective least fitting Harry James Potter. What Harry perceived as neediness in himself everybody else would have called demanding that others respect their human rights.
Astoria had seen that feeling on Daphne’s face when she had visited her at St. Mungo’s after the birth, and seen little Zoe for the first time. Since then she had wished to have a child too, as long as another person would be the primary parent. And as long as she didn’t need to play the wife. But Draco was openly gay and in a relationship with Harry. If she offered to be their surrogate, she could have that child without needing to fit into the norms her parents tried to press her into.
“Yes, I would like that. But you have to know that I haven’t – haven’t done it with any person yet. My only sexual experience is with toys.” As soon as Draco had said it, he was afraid of Harry’s reaction.
“Harry's a Gryffindor. They don’t beat about the bush. So, Harry how do you feel about being Draco’s best man?” She seemed to consider herself an expert of Gryffindors, since she was dating two of them.
“Sit down, please.” Draco was shocked at how scared he was that Potter might really walk away.  “Of course, I want you around. I – You came here, fully aware that it’s me.”
Harry leaned in and kissed him, softly, as if he were afraid a wrong move would wake him up and reveal that all this was just a dream.
“I believe we both deserve better than to be trapped in a compulsory marriage. Tell Astoria, that I was glad when she refused to marry me. The only reason I didn’t refuse was that I didn’t have the courage. I’m glad she had it. I only feel free to be myself now that Father is deceased.” He gave them a smile when they didn’t flinch at his words.
“Yeah, my cat doesn’t like the Floo.” He remembered who the person was. “Bulstrode? Millicent Bulstrode?”
“If your father were still alive, I’d hex him six ways from Sunday.” Dennis reached out and stroked her cheek.
A deep husky voice came from a portrait on the wall. “He’s not a Gryffindor like you and me, Harry. His pureblood education wouldn’t let him show you that you mean something to him if he believes he can’t win your real friendship. He thinks you just pity him, and a Malfoy accepts no pity. The Black family used to think so as well, at least those who remained  on the tapestry did.”
Suddenly, just as he was thinking of his arms feeling comfortably heavy, he felt the sensation of his hand lifting, while simultaneously lying still. The ghost touch feeling seemed to move to his crotch and rub across his cock through his pyjama bottoms. Okay, maybe when Harry was asleep, the connection was wider open. It didn’t necessarily mean anything.
He turned and looked at a white veil. Yet, the person in the veil didn’t look like Astoria. Draco nervous brain took a little to really grasp what he saw. The person who just lifted the veil off their face was a man. Not just any man – Draco had to be dreaming – it was Harry!
After coming for the second time, this time by rutting against each other, Draco needed something to eat and drink, while Harry had dozed off. He saw a bathrobe hanging on a hook beside the door, put it on, and padded downstairs.
“Uncle Harry, what’s wrong with Meowfoy? Is he sick?” Teddy looked at Harry with big curious eyes, his head sporting turquoise cat ears.
And even though he felt a little closer to Pansy, he was glad she was free to live the life of her choice, being out and proud in a relationship with Hermione and Ron, an amazing power throuple.
Draco took the Potter Armiger ring from the cushion Ron was holding and slowly slipped it on Harry’s finger. “With this ring I wed you and I will from now on be Draco Potter. I will love you with all my heart, be there for you, and be true to you forever and ever.”
“So, we’ll start this on uneven footing? No.” Draco drew his wand and cast a Flaccidus on his own crotch. “It lasts four hours, I think. We’ll just have to wait, and do the cuddling before the sex.”
, telling some more jokes.  Knowing they were failing miserably at putting on a show this evening. They tried during the song to focus on their Patronus memory, going with Harry to pick Rose Weasley for an afternoon at the cinema, and Molly telling her: “Listen to your godparents.” The day they had felt for the first time that even the Weasley Matriarch accepted and trusted them - which was frankly a huge deal, as she was convinced that their father had been one of the five Death Eaters involved in the killing of her brothers who had escaped justice. Draco couldn’t even begin to imagine how much it must have taken her initially to remind herself again and again that Draco was not like Lucius Malfoy.
And in their eyes, Draco had gone out of his way to change his ways. He was working alongside the elves, which most wix considered humiliating, he didn’t complain or hex anybody who dirtied the tables on purpose after he had just cleaned them or shot hexes at him. And from his meagre salary he donated what he could to two charities: A pre-Hogwarts children’s centre, where kids from Pureblood and Muggleborn families got to know each other and could form friendships beyond the old barriers in wizarding society, and Padfoot House, a place, where kids from abusive families could find safety.
“Don’t get the idea of calling me honey or any other pet name. That is strictly reserved to significant others, which I don’t have.” There had been men who would have shagged him, but only if they had been sure nobody would ever know. And being someone’s insignificant other was something Draco was too proud for in most cases; maybe he would accept it if Potter propositioned him, but why would Potter; after all the Golden Boy could have virtually anyone.
“Yes, but it will take a little experimenting because the elf who baked it uses elvish measurements.”
sounded through Draco’s head in a smooth, rich baritone voice. Draco didn’t know if he shivered from the voice, or from it coming from the inside of his head. It sounded good, even though he usually found the song obnoxiously upbeat. But then, he had a thing for beautiful men’s singing voices.
“I – I can go, if you don’t want me around. I know, I’m not your type, but I hoped at least we could talk like we would by letter. I loved our correspondence…” Potter looked – maybe almost frightened.
Potter interrupted him. “You’re doing your work no matter how they treat you. You are friendly to the elves. I hear them talking a lot about your patience and your hard work. Your past shaped you, but it matters so much more where you went from there. I’d be happy to be on first name terms with you.”
“Uncle Harry, does that mean you’ll visit us and stay for a few days? My friends’ uncles, aunts and grandparents visit and stay for a few days. Mom says Ghana is too far away, and my Ghanaian uncles and aunties don’t have enough money to visit. Please, Uncle Harry. My birthday is next week.” Mary pleaded and grabbed Harry’s hand. She looked at him with puppy dog eyes.
Then the elves had integrated him into their community and he had learned how to be himself among the others. They may not be human, but they were still people, and very decent ones at that.
Merlin’s balls! What have I done to Harry that he reacts like this to being alone with me. I must do something.
If he had said that aloud in the presence of Ninty, she would have told him: “Draco is having a thing for men, especially if they are having black hair and a pert behind. When is Draco going to be introducing his mate?” She kept telling him to find a “mate” on a regular basis, and on the same regular basis he kept reminding her that he was neither a Veela nor a werewolf, and therefore didn’t “mate.”
“The first thing I heard was his thoughts about the monologuing of his colleagues during a meeting. Later, it seemed like a song was stuck in his head on his way home.”
“You think I haven’t spent the last year looking for a way out? What idea would I have today if I hadn’t already had it in the last 365 days? Maybe you should take the potion yourself. Oh wait, your abusive father died in the Battle of Hogwarts, and you wear the Armiger ring yourself, that I broke the curses on and on all your other family rings. Also you’re pansexual.” As soon as Draco had spoken it, he felt ashamed of lashing out.
“Merlin, I never thought I’d say such a thing in my life, but change your clothes and never try dress robes again. You look so uncomfortable it itches me when I look at you. I would recommend a nice Muggle suit for your wedding.”
They didn’t know why the air seemed to be thrumming in a different way tonight from what they were used to. But Harry had been nervous all day, too. He had denied it, but Draco knew him.
Draco Flooed to the cattery clutching Pawter to his chest. As he stepped out of the hearth, he noticed a very well-known messy head of hair leaving through the door. Potter. So, that obnoxiously handsome git who lived to dress in the most asinine clothes but still haunt Draco’s wet dreams had a cat? He always would have assumed that Potter was more likely to be a dog person. And hadn’t the Gryffindor been with a dog on Platform 9 ¾ when they were in… was it fifth year?
Draco knew nothing about Namreifs, he had never heard of them before, but Prongs was amazing. If only he himself wasn’t Draco Malfoy! Prongs deserved something better than a Death Eater. But Draco couldn’t break the contact. He needed to continue writing to Prongs. Even though it was selfish and depraved. But seeing each other in person was out of the question.
“Dawlish told me that I wasn’t going to bribe my way back into society’s good graces or corrupt you.” Draco remembered the contempt in Dawlish’s face, and how before the war, Dawlish had kowtowed before Father. Dawlish had not needed to be Imperiused under Thicknesse, as Draco had heard his father say several times.
Draco learned that the day he and Potter ran into each other one lunch break in front of Twilfit and Tattings. Potter needed a new set of dressrobes for a charity fundraiser. Being the curious wizard he was, Draco followed Potter inside. Potter wanted to take the least expensive robes, even though the fabric was itching him obviously and he kept on pulling it away from his body in an uncomfortable manner.
“Hello, Cousin Sirius, how are you? And how is Remus? Is he sleeping after the Full?” Andromeda turned to Sirius’ portrait, seeing that the place beside him at the painted table was empty.
The assistant, Marvin, showed him two different outfits, a combination in blue and burnt sienna that reminded a bit of a kingfisher, and on the other hand, something Draco craved to see Potter in. It was the more daring outfit, but Draco felt like he would beg to see Potter wearing this. Of course, he questioned his sanity at the same time. What was it to him what Potter would be wearing to the gala?
Passing by his room, he saw the door wide open and noticed with surprise that the bed looked untouched. He cast an indicating spell that showed him that nobody had slept there at all in the last night. “Pansy Parkinson, are you fucking kidding me?” he mumbled under his breath.
“We didn’t ask you to make a statement like a politician. You can let your Gryffindor out here.”  Pansy put a hand on Harry’s arm. “You can’t tell me you’re happy how things are going.”
“What’s Ms. Parkinson’s opinion on him living here? I can’t imagine that she wants him to live here.” Harry needed allies to get Malfoy out of here, even if they were one Pansy Parkinson.
“C-can I take the vow now, to convince you?” Draco was afraid she might remember what a git he had been at school, or that he might still not have overcome enough prejudices to be considered worthy of the way they were treating him. He cast two cushioning charms on the floor and knelt down on the one.
Harry let go of his nipple and breathed, “Lift your hips, darling,” against it. The sound of his voice made Draco shiver with pleasure.
The evening was a success; it seemed as if everyone was as happy to tear down House borders as Harry and Draco were. At 1 am, after Dean and Seamus had left, only Hermione, Ron and Pansy were still around. They were all sitting on the three-seated sofa and talking too quietly for Harry and Draco to hear, although Harry noticed Pansy’s hand landed on Hermione’s knee whenever she stopped gesticulating.
“No potions, but what about my clothes? And who will help me when I lose my job?” Draco felt anger rise. He would be sent to Azkaban if he lost his job, his probation was 15 draconic years.
Karamo took two thirds of the legos off the scale pan, divided them up in two piles on the table and took post-its and a pen from his pocket. In front of the scale pan, he wrote ‘Draco’s guilt.’ In front of the other two piles he wrote ‘Voldemort’s guilt’ and ‘Lucius’ guilt.’ “Okay?”
Harry took his hand and slid the Potter ring on his finger. It was a rather simple platinum band, precious but not ostentatious. And while its physical weight was just as it was appropriate for a platinum band, its magical weight was far lighter than what he had been used to for all his life. The ring was only imbued with protective charms, not with all the load of pressure and curse residue any ring from Draco’s family had been heavy with.
“I will. From the bottom of my heart, I will.” Draco felt relieved by the questions of the vow. He knew that they could have been worded in a far more dangerous way, and he knew Granger well enough to be aware of how deliberately she must have chosen her words.
The Fab Five followed him into his sparsely furnished groundskeeper hut. They looked around. Beside the window, there was a mattress on the ground, next to it, a crate as a nightstand. A clothes rack stood on one side, reminding rather of a flea market than of a wardrobe. Beside it were the only three complete pieces of furniture in the room: A bookshelf, a small table and a swivel chair.
The next nine days didn’t feel like a witness protection program at all. When they weren’t shagging or sleeping and cuddled up against each other, they researched and prepared the house bonding ritual. Harry had to meditate for preparation in every single room — including en-suites and the pantry — and Draco learned more about the horrors of Harry’s childhood when Harry asked in a small voice if it was necessary to meditate in the cupboards, too.
“My charm to make my bed appropriate for sharing with Harry wore off. And if he had noticed, it would have been creepy for him. Thank Merlin I was the first to get up. I was really a dick not to offer Pansy my bed and sleep on the sofa but make Harry share the bed with me too?. I’d better just find a different place to stay. Let the fucking Manor crumble and live where I don’t take advantage of Harry’s kindness.”
Harry’s hands shook when he told Draco about the cupboard under the stairs, about having to sleep there every night, about Uncle Vernon beating him and locking him in without food, about being a preschool kid and having only the spiders for company.
“You better accio the owl treats. I’m not ready to wait for you to come back into my arms any longer than necessary.” Draco grumbled, wrapping the blanket back around himself.
“I was the last magical Black by name. And Harry is my heir. In past times before Cantankerous Nott and his toxic ideas, Harry’s name would have been Potter-Black from then on and he would have been the head of the House of Black and passed the name Black on to one of his heirs and Potter to the other one. Only that our ancestors were the first to be so stupid and follow the ideas of Cantankerous Nott, even before the Nott family themselves. What I want to say is: This is your home too if Harry says so. And you heard him say that you can stay here. I’ve stayed out of your sight so far, but I have watched you. And I agree with Harry that you are worthy of his friendship. Welcome to your maternal family home Draco.” He took a deep breath. “And now stop being stubborn, I hate talking like a fucking Pureblood patriarch. I only did so because Remus promised to ri…”
Draco cut up vegetables all morning, then spent lunch time cleaning tables and avoiding most groups of people. The only people he was sure he didn’t need to avoid were Potter, the Weasleys, and Granger. Not because he had any illusion that they might have a better opinion of him, he was fully aware they had the same reasons to hate him as everyone else here.
“Dempy, please, pack things for him and also for you elves, how many of you are there by the way?” Harry had to be more stubborn than Malfoy, this dark magic in the walls of the Manor could kill someone he mused. It was the kind of decontamination site that could only be worked with charms working from the outside, if it could be decontaminated at all.
Harry sat silently for a few moments, the way he would sit over a difficult question at Hogwarts, then he pulled himself together visibly and called Hermione back in. He explained to her that the bond obviously transmitted also the thoughts and sensations of getting off.
Draco didn’t know how it was for others, but for him, after becoming a ghost, time had become a rather blurry matter. Apart from the time Potter had been here (was it an hour or a year ago?) the hours might have ticked away like seconds, or he skipped a lot of them. He could see days and nights passing, but while he could easily count the leaves on the cherry tree outside the kitchen window, despite their large number, he was unable to count the days.
It was no question that Percy and George were opposites to an extent Draco had never imagined siblings could be opposites.  Although, whilst at Hogwarts there had been rumours of them not really getting along, now as they had matured, disagreements didn’t stop them from caring and trusting each other. Also, nobody forced a legacy or a hierarchy on them.
“I won’t invite your cat to the Manor. I don’t trust you to have trained him well.” There it was. Of fucking course Malfoy would lash out sooner or later.
Not for the first time Draco wished to have a timeturner, to be able to leave his family instead of doing all the evil things he had done as a teenager to please his father. His heartless, abusive father, who had always threatened to harm his mother in order to keep him obedient and threatened to harm him to keep her under his thumb.
Faux-Draco yelled, and Draco slowly came to realize what was going on. He was hearing a nightmare of Harry’s.
“I—I’m not the intended target. The man I’m bonded to is. The gnome crashed into me when he was on his way back from targeting him with the potion. And he…”
“Are you sure that he would want to attend a wedding with someone as broken as me?” Harry cringed at his own voice.
“It was okay. I understood it the moment I saw you that you can’t just tell someone whose name you don’t know. But what does being an Animagus have to do with looking after the kids during the full moon?” Draco took a sip of his drink.
“Nngh, yes. Please, more.” Draco gasped, as Harry trailed kisses down his abs, then dipped his tongue into Draco’s navel, making him gasp with arousal. Harry’s hand found its way under the waistband of his boxers, and Draco decided to wear lace knickers next time. He wanted to drive Harry as crazy as Harry drove him.
“Can you ask a friend who would be credible as a fake significant other?” Malfoy turned on the water at a perfect temperature.
They finally did weave around their owners’ but when Meow weaved around Harry, Paw followed, and then Meow followed Paw around Draco’s legs.
Dudley blinked, then gaped at the flowers with an open mouth. Then, as he noticed that other people were staring at the flowers, he raised his voice. “My cousin is an illusionist. But there’s no time for a show now.” Finally, he whispered: “I thought you weren’t allowed to do magic in public?”
“You’d be surprised. I cook my breakfast two days a week when my elves have their days off. Although there is no breakfast that compares to Dempy’s.” Malfoy smirked with challenge in his eyes as if he expected the breakfast to be hideous.
“Because of all the things you did after that. And, Draco, I see you as someone who could easily be more than a friend.” Harry took Draco’s hand.
“That calls for a few secret weapons! You chose well to come to our salon.” The stylist gave him a smug look. She pressed an intercom and said, “Harry Potter is here.”
Andie firecalled me today and asked if we could imagine getting married in Tonks cottage, because her healer said it’s not recommendable for her to travel with portkey for two years, because last time she travelled by portkey, she had an allergic reaction  to the portkey charm. The desensitizing potion has to be taken for two years before it has healed the allergy.
“Your cats have become close friends. I ran tests with what cats might harmonize, and apart from your cats, all other combinations of cats put into one room for a night would have been a disaster. So, Paw and Meow had to share a room for one night; and then I wanted to move one of them into the room that became free, but to no avail. I guess, you both will have to find a way to help your cats stay in touch.” Mick felt more nervous than they had thought they would be. The way both men glared at them, Mick was not sure if one of them would hex them or have an outburst of accidental magic. Why did they have to…
“He’s still in the saving business, what with the Padfoot Foundation. He just doesn’t need to risk his life anymore for it.” Hannah added.
Draco stood in front of his mirror and cast a glamour on his eyes. The wedding guests didn’t have to see that he had cried half the night. It was enough that his mother knew.
Draco popped the candy into his mouth and started getting up, but Harry stopped him. “I fancy you, too.”
Draco turned in for the night. He changed into his pyjamas then looked through the bookshelf for something readable. The only thing remotely interesting was an old copy of Hogwarts a History.
Harry went to the bathroom, and Draco watched the cats grooming each other on the side of the bed-sofa where Harry had been before. Pawter was sprawled on his back, and Meow was licking the black cat’s belly and purring loudly. Draco wondered if this intimacy between these two exceeded the normal sibling-like relationship. He knew that kneazles mated for life, and that gay kneazles weren’t unusual. Pawter and Meow both had kneazle ancestors.
“Watch it with Granger or Weasley, they’ve always been your friends.” Malfoy’s magic pushed back in order to keep him out.
Usually, his lack of hope to ever be loved felt like an old scar, but days like Valentine’s day, Christmas, Beltane and also Greg’s wedding last year, were like icy weather that made an old injury throb again. He knew that the only one to blame for it was himself. He hadn’t run away the day Aunt Bella had announced that there would be a party for him. He had guessed that she meant his Marking Ritual, fear had gripped him, but he had done nothing to prevent it.
“And I get lots of half-witted letters from anyone who wants to run for any kind of office and tries to persuade me to support them. Sometimes they try to trick me into supporting things that are the opposite of what I believe in.” Potter barked out a humourless laugh.
He added the crushed pearls and the rosebuds. It would be expensive to brew this potion often enough to give Astoria a satisfying marriage life, but nobody deserved to be in a marriage with someone who didn’t want to make them happy. Astoria was a good woman. She had the same worldviews and cultural interests as Draco and she was a great friend. If this kind of thing could work with any woman then it was only with her or Pansy.
The one cup of tea to wind down had somehow become a sleepover in the guestroom of Grimmauld Place. That first renewal of their acquaintance had rapidly evolved into them  seeing each other every single day. It had not even taken them until the premiere of
Trying his best to avoid people altogether, he collected plates and cutlery from tables without magic. He knew that nobody took it well if he used magic. Whenever he showed his wand, he had to reckon with people hexing him, or calling the Aurors and accusing him of trying to curse them. The fact that he had a Ministry-issued wand and could only use a very limited range of spells didn’t matter.
“You know, Ron and I don’t want every experiment we get up to commented by George. Especially considering if he might interpret it as a marriage crisis and alert Molly.”  Hermione tugged at her bracelet, as she would sometimes do when she was feeling nervous.
Lee grinned at Draco: “What a nice surprise, our future televisual star is dating Harry. I already lost hope that I would win those ten galleons from Ron. Fred would love this.”
“I didn’t ask you to meet me here because of my husband. He deserves what he gets, and the way he spoke to Draco last time Draco visited him, I’m not inclined to visit him any time soon. We are still waiting for Pansy, and we have something to discuss with you. What would you like to order? Oh, and Mr. Potter, I think it’s about time you started calling me Narcissa.” Her smile had something tentative in it.
“You can talk to Luna, she’s coming here in a few minutes, as well as your mother, they both will join the cooking class, at least the first part.” Karamo added.
A freckled hand appeared in his range of vision. “Mione, Draco, enough nerdy discussions! All work and no play are boggart attractors. The castles are ready! The last on the purple castle is a rotten dragon’s egg!”
“Lie back, Draco. I’ll take care of you. I’ll make you feel so good.” Harry followed Draco as he lay back, kissed a trail from his collarbone to his left nipple, and sucked on it.
“So, this is an impromptu double wedding?” Officiant Abbott said with a mischievous wink, as Dennis ran towards the altar with a ring box in his hand and Ron Weasley and Neville Longbottom in tow.
We are happy to inform you that Queer Eye Wizarding Britain will come to your house in the two weeks from May 4th to May 19th. Due to a scheduling necessity, the recording of the episode will take two weeks of part-time filming instead of one week full-time.
Draco scowled. “He’s not sick. But Bulstrode had to put him into one room with Potter’s Meow. Yes, the Boy Who Lived to be Asinine really named his cat after the sound it makes.”
“But how are you managing emotionally now that Draco is here around the clock?” Hermione returned to the original topic.
“House arrest and community service, between six months and two years,” Ron replied. “Depending on how severe the Wizengamot considers her crime.”
For a moment, it felt liberating to laugh at Voldemort splinching off his nose. But then Draco thought again about how wrong it was to get arousal from an unaware sleeping Harry and fell back into despair.
Harry had the vague feeling of having seen Emily, the brown-haired hairstylist before, but he couldn’t place her; maybe she was a friend of Dudley’s, after all. Dudley had apologized to him, and they had formed a tentative friendship, and Harry had attended Dudley’s wedding and the baptism of his daughter.
“Mal-Malfoy!” Harry brought out, and the dam behind his eyes broke. He cried on Ron’s shoulder, sobbing desperately.
Working in the kitchen alongside the elves was actually not so bad. They had taught him the Elvish language, and among themselves they were very different from what Draco had seen from House Elves in his youth. Some had a wicked sense of humour and loved to banter with him. Also, they treated him almost like one of their own, and where they treated him differently, it was things like not being able to  Apparate inside the Ministry, where they had to sidealong him, and that he needed explanations on their customs.
“Harry, you know what, Meowfoy reminds me of James when he was in detention at a Hogsmeade weekend just after getting together with Lily. All this whinging and pining. Even Binns let James go that time.” Sirius’ grinned, like there was a very interesting prank story behind it.
Draco stared at the scales. Was limiting the damage a good deed? He had not even thought much except not wanting to get caught by anybody.
She had decorated everything with Happy Birthday streamers, and there was a cake in the purple, white and green of the genderqueer flag, as well as candles on top.  When Draco counted, and thought back, they gasped. The day was the anniversary of the verdict of their trial, sentenced to a four year probation with the condition of them completing an intensive Muggle studies course. Harry, Luna and Ginny had decided to throw a second birthday for them every year from then on, as it had been the day the Draco who could be themself had been born.
I stood numbly there, watching as the Healers rushed from the entrance to the ward through it to Draco’s room and back to get more people. I couldn’t even count how many people where in the room at the moment. I felt horrified, watching, not knowing what was going on. Draco was the only person i knew here. The only thing keeping me on the ground because he was familiar. He was the only thing that was familiar to me in here. What would i do if he died? Because who knows what can happen with that syndrome? Nobody really knew anything about this and maybe these things Draco saw are they really just hallucinations? Maybe they were real and they killed Draco and nobody would ever know about it because they didn’t know these things were real. Suddenly there was a weight on my shoulder. It was a Hand. There was a Hand on my shoulder.
Well, Harry’s luck wasn’t there long. When he and Draco reached the common room Draco was gone again. But at least he ate something. Harry sat him down on the couch and then after a while considering sat down beside him. He grabbed Dracos arm and stayed like that, scared that something would happen, scared that Draco would cramp again.
Harry nods slowly and after a few moments he realizes that Draco cant see that and is still waiting for an answer so he clears his throat a little bit embarrassed and then answers: “Its good that its gone now. I mean it should stay away from you when it does these things to you. Cant you...I don’t know tell it to go away?” Draco snorts and Harry feels even more embarrassed.
It was the next day and Draco sat at the same couch and on the exact same spot looking out the window as yesterday. It was as if he had never even moved. Did he do this every day? I asked myself while walking towards him and sitting next to him again. Will every day be like this? No, No, it won’t because I will be out of here by tomorrow, I reminded myself. “Good Morning Harry…You don’t happen to have your wand, do you?” Draco greeted me without looking up. “Uh…Draco everyone gets their wand taken away when coming here.” I said confused as to what he wanted with one. “Oh…Right. I just thought maybe they made an exception for the savior of the wizarding world.” I shook my head and he sighed looking out of the window again. “What exactly do you want with a wand here Draco? I mean what do you want to do with it?” I asked watching him. He wore his white shirt and the joggers again. I wore almost the same with the only difference that my joggers were black. It seemed to be the normal ´uniform´ for the Patients. “I want to vanish this window.” Draco startled me out of my thoughts. I frowned. “What? You want to do what?” I must have heard wrong. “I want to vanish this window.” Draco said again looking pretty sure of himself. “What for?” I asked him still confused as hell. “I don’t want to see this thing in the pond anymore. I can’t figure out what it is, and it is making me crazy.” He answered my question.
“I already tried that Harry...But the Kamalas are always with you...Everyone has one. I think they are the manifestation of you're bad feelings, the things you are ashamed of and the sins you commited as well as the trauma that you endured. It will always come back to me because it belongs to me. You have one too.” Harry thinks about that for a few moments. Draco lets him think without interrupting the silence. “Can you hear mine talking…?” He asks cautiously not sure if he wants to know the answer. “Yeah I can hear it muttering…but I can understand them clearer when I can see and confront them. You have to wait until I see again I think Harry. Im sorry.” Draco sounds genuinely sad that he cant help and Harry immediately wants to make him feel better again. In that exact moment he notices that he is still loosely holding Dracos Hand and even though he can feel his cheeks reddening and getting hot he starts caressing it and holding it a little tighter to himself again. Draco smiles softly and his head sinks against the headboard of the bed, clearly relaxing again and cheering up. Just as Harry opened his mouth to say something a nurse comes in. “Ah here you are Harry. Your appointment is now. Would you go to the office? I will take care of Draco in the meantime okay?” Tentatively Harry nods and then slowly gets up off the bed and lets Dracos hand slip softly on his lap again. “I will come by later so we can eat dinner together okay?” Only after Draco nodded in his direction and flashed him a good bye smile does Harry leave the room and head to his talking session.
I am sorry to end this chapter with a cliffhanger i didnt intend to but my story wrote itself this time :) If you have ideas, questions or criticism i would like to hear from you in the comments! I dont really know when the next chapter is going to be up but i will try my best to hurry up. Have a good day folks :3
Draco was standing in the room, tears running down his face. He had his hands at his ears and apparently tried to block something out. After this short moment of shock Harry could hear what Draco was saying, or rather muttering to himself. “I can’t take this anymore...Stop talking to me! I don’t want to hear your whispers anymore! I can’t do this anymore...can’t hear your whispers anymore...please stop whispering to me...” Several healers were already on their way over to Draco but the spells they were casting on him seemed to just make it worse. Draco struggled against them when they tried to pull him away or give him a potion or even just tried to touch him. Harry stood still frozen in the doorway. He thought Draco was doing better- he was in reality most of the time and didn’t seem delusional at all anymore. But now this was happening. Finally after what felt like an eternity Draco passed out and fell into the healers arms.
I am really sorry this chapter took so long but there is so much going on in my private life and on top of that I had a writers block. Anyway just enjoy the new Chapter! :) Also I changed the Pov I hope that is not the ending of the world :)
I heard healer Atkinson tell her current students through the door and took a steeling breath. Everything would be fine. My fingers stroked lightly over the bandage that covered my eyes. Everything was fine. The door opened. I heard people walking into the room footsteps too close together and muffled to count. “Hello Draco dear. Are you ready to answer some questions?” At my nod, she gave her students the okay to start. There was a shy pause but then the first questions came. “Draco...can we tell you Draco?” I nodded again. “Ok...Do you know how long you have the syndrome now? I thought only children got it.” “I don’t know it’s hard to recall anything from my childhood really. Up until I turned 11 everything’s blurry or black and then there is just school and the war.” I answered as best as i could. I could hear some of the students shift uncomfortably at the mention of the war but i didn’t really care. “...What creatures do you see? I mean when you can see.” “I see the Kamalas mostly. Itward comes sometimes but that’s a rare occasion. He is really busy these days.” “are they scary? Is it really that bad that you...tried to kill yourself?” You could practically feel the tension in the room. They were uncomfortable asking things like this. “I didn’t really try to kill myself I just...needed a moment of silence...of not seeing them...” I tried to explain. “They are not scary anymore but it’s horrible seeing them knowing people don’t believe you because they can’t see these things. They can’t even imagine what it’s like and that means they can’t feel real empathy. It’s...bone crushing...but I can live with it most of the time.” “Does Itward talk about the other realms? Can you go there? Do you...know Fran?”
I walked down the hall away from my family and my friends and back into this strange bubble with just Draco Malfoy to talk to. It was strange that just after a day I felt relaxed talking and sitting with him. Before I came here I never really felt relaxed, even when I was at the burrow or alone at home just watching tv. I didn’t really like going outside either because it made me nervous, the people made me nervous because they stared at me or even tried to take pictures of me or asked for an autograph. When it got too much I stopped going outside. But now I did feel relaxed again because here nobody would ask me all these things about the war or to sign on their breasts or even just to take a picture again. Here there was just Draco and Mary and people who completely ignored me. Here I wasn’t just the savior of the wizarding world the famous boy who lived twice, here I wasn’t the famous harry potter. Here I was just Harry. The only place I would rather be was my bedroom in Grimmauld place.
“Like I explained the last time we saw each other Fran bow was a muggleborn witch whose parents died early due to accidental magic outburst. She had the ability to see into the five realms of reality which is a very rare skill not even trained unspeakables can master. The only people who can do it have the fran bow syndrome. It was named after her because her case was the first one documented. There is not much known about the syndrome since after Fran only 5 other people ever developed it. 3 of those died in the first few days of being sent to saint mungos due to false potion. It was simply not researched enough at that point. That means we only have one documented case of a young girl named Alice who didn’t even live a year with this syndrome because she died suddenly one night. You can call yourselves really lucky though as we have a recent case of the syndrome right here at the hospital. If you would follow me because he agreed to answer some questions for us.”
