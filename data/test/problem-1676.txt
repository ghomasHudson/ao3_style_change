“Yeah, fuck. Okay,” Draco nodded frantically, running his fingers through Harry’s beard, into his hair, down his neck.
Slowly, almost dream-like, Harry ducked his head and the white noise buzzing in his ears grew more insistent when the tip of his nose brushed the side of Draco’s neck. He smelled like sandalwood and rich vetiver, and Harry knew his salty-earth taste before his lips reached that soft spot framed in between taut tendons. He bared his teeth and grazed the skin there and Draco let out a breath as if all reservations left him like a punctured balloon. Then, when Harry opened his mouth and sucked lightly at the spot, Draco’s hand flew to his shoulder, fingers digging into the leather of Harry’s jacket.
Harry runs a hand through his hair and stubbornly decides to keep his voice down no matter what. “Thanks again for letting me use your phone,” he says.
, adorned with a grainy picture of a dark silhouette going through a gate at Heathrow. Another, smaller one, shows the silhouette getting into a Muggle cab and both look like they’ve been taken out of Muggle security footage. The figure is suspiciously dark, given the lighting, as if the person cast a handy little charm, knowing they’d be recorded, and the media, in its glorious proficiency in jumping to conclusions, decided it must have been Potter for reasons unknown.
or otherwise indicated his Potions knowledge might be just limited enough to render him underqualified for the task. Robards, however, was having none of it—the man dismissed him, barking something about
“Oh my— Fuck, Potter,” Draco gasps into his mouth as he cups him through the fabric. “You can’t be serious—” He actually stops kissing him just to look down, his mouth falling open in a soft
There’s no fanfare when he’s done, he can simply feel that it’s enough, some foreign magic thrumming anew through the warm body next to his, and Harry pauses at the realisation it must be Malfoy’s core, evidently pleased with its host brought back to health. Malfoy’s face is flushed, his fringe is sticking to his forehead, and he’s biting his lip that’s already red and worried under his teeth. All in all, Malfoy looks completely debauched and Harry’s thoughts go to places they should steer clear of for multiple reasons but mostly due to the fact Malfoy just had two of his ribs magically mended.
It’s not that Harry has a stick up his arse (not a single one has ever ventured there, though a specific kind would be welcome if the occasion arises)—he has, however, learned very quickly that if one sits in their office all day, bored out of their mind over case paperwork, witness statements, and crime scene reports, one finds the strangest ways to combat said boredom. Most of those ways are not productive, the majority of them are far from wise, and a few are straight-up unethical for an Auror to even entertain. In Harry’s defence, he’s twenty-five, he’s a Gryffindor through and through, and, come to think of it, he
He doesn’t move, just sits propped up against the headboard and stares, taking Harry in, his eyes roaming over every inch of inked skin, tracing every line and shape with a careful glance. His mouth is slightly open and his breaths are coming out shallow.
“Mhm,” Draco hummed. “I can’t believe it, it’s like we’ve just moved in,” he said, rucking up his shirt a little higher and placing his own hand over Harry’s, tangling their fingers together.
Ale in hand, he steps outside and immediately spots it—a narrow set of metal stairs leading to the roof, at the very end of the terrace. Halfway up, Harry can already see a mop of white hair, stark and shining under the stars. If Malfoy notices he’s there, he doesn’t acknowledge it, sitting propped up on his arms, his long legs hanging off the roof between the vertical railings.
“Want you,” Harry murmured around Draco’s finger, palming all over Draco’s flanks, warming up his skin with the oil on his hands, fingers shyly skitting lower and lower until they were grazing the dark-blond hairs below Draco’s navel.
They stand there in silence and Draco’s shaking his head with an impressed look on his face. “Oh, Granger, even after all these years… I always remembered to never underestimate her.”
—” Draco rocks his hips in time with the steady rhythm, letting out a harsh exhale when Harry adds another finger.
Draco adjusts his collar and follows Harry inside the house. “Ah, yes, let’s keep the violence domestic, like in the old days?” he says conversationally, with a barely-audible nervousness lacing his tone.
When Ron finally tells him that they’ve intercepted the Family’s owl, Harry’s whole body goes stiff.
“I’ll… consider it,” he says with a grumpy note lacing his tone, but there’s something pleased in there as well and Harry chuckles softly.
and sees white tufts of fluffy hair styled around the bald top of his head and when the stranger smiles, Harry struggles to locate more than six teeth that are still attached to his gums.
,” he looks at the pastry in his hand, shaking his head. Harry grins at that—he has always found Draco’s love for sweets surprising yet strangely in character once they became friends. “And they smell like heaven, too. If they ever close down, I’m going on strike.”
Draco saves him from saying it and it’s equally welcome as it is terrifying. “You mean sex,” he says calmly.
Struggling a little at first, Harry managed to send a text message with an address and a question, signing his name at the end. Being a paranoid law enforcement officer, magical or not, he made sure he deleted the message after sending it. Maggie must have seen the heartfelt gratitude on his face when he handed the phone back because she shot him a bright smile, they exchanged a few pleasantries, and the babysitter from the Shrieking Shack was gone.
“You’re refusing to look me in the eyes, Hermione, and— Ron!?” He cranes his neck so Ron actually looks at him, his freckles standing out in his red, guilty face. “You’re in on this!” Harry says, trying not to be too loud to startle little Fred, who’s looking at his aunt and uncles with huge, brown, curious eyes.
Harry raises a brow and Draco seems to notice his strange behaviour. He smooths down the front of his shirt and coughs. “
Harry tries to picture the mystery man and fails, even though the description sounds vaguely familiar. He grimaces. “That’s... Something to go on.”
Slowly, as if approaching a wild animal, Draco climbs up the stairs, careful not to slip on the fresh layer of snow, and finally, after four bloody weeks of complete silence, he stands before Harry in the flesh.
It was disconcerting, and maybe a tiny bit shocking, how well they got on, and how easily they jumped back into their soft sort of camaraderie, so vastly different than what they were at school, and so infuriatingly
Draco put down his quill (yet another irrational fear of old reactionists, that Muggle ink would somehow make their paperwork less pompous or prominent) and folded his hands atop the next parchment in his pile. He inclined his head towards the massive, strange-looking chair displayed in front of the largest window in the study. It was one of Draco’s favourite showpieces, and possibly the luckiest find in his collection.
Draco is the first one to break the silence. “Yes, so this happened, no use being coy now, I suppose.”
“I would—” Draco’s voice comes out a broken whisper but his eyes tell a different story—emotions flash behind the steel curtain, too fast to decipher, to catch even a single one and hold on to it, just so everything else would stop spinning.
“Hey.” Draco nudges his wrist with one finger, and Harry watches the pale skin contrast with his warm brown. “Is this the part where I give you a pep talk, Auror Potter?”
The corner of Draco’s lips goes up in an unamused smile. “I wonder what you mean by that, Auror Potter.”
It’s the most erotic thing Harry has ever seen: the shared arousal etched into their faces, soaring higher and higher to reach its apex, Draco’s arms thrown over his shoulders and chest, holding him in place, and Harry’s fingers clutching the sheet, tight enough to rip.
“I want you to tell me if you want to stop,” Draco murmurs, positioning himself a little lower. “At any point. Promise me, Harry.”
They’re very close. Draco can count Harry’s freckles and he makes a mental note to do it with his lips at one point, seeing that Harry has them in other places, too. Before Draco can weigh out the pros and cons of the situation, before he decides what the fuck they ought to do right now, Harry just smiles and leans in.
He could feel Draco’s girth in his hand, imagined how it would feel slowly breaching him, sliding inside, setting him on fire. He was
“Don’t look at me like that,” Harry says calmly, feeling Draco’s glare linger just a second too long. “There’s a launderette near the town centre,” he offers. The only answer he gets is mortified silence. “You’ve never done laundry in your life, have you?”
“You have thought about it,” Draco murmurs, baring his neck for Harry to kiss. “I bet he likes to be spoiled, don’t you think?” He squeezes Harry’s cock and his hand goes to unbutton Harry’s trousers. All while Draco keeps talking. “The things he would let us do,” he whispers, “we would take such good care of him.”
. Draco, who let out another quiet groan, whose eyes were nearly all pupil, who was biting his lip so hard it should have bled, and squeezing his cock through his trousers with a quiet hiss.
He hesitates, every second he wastes not planning ticking above his head like an ominous clock counting down to zero. “Malfoy,” Harry bites his lip, indecision tethering at the edges of his judgement. “I can’t—”
Potter lifts his chin and licks into his mouth and in that moment, Draco knows there’s no going back.
Harry’s good mood doesn’t last long. After a few blissful days of Draco recovering at St Mungo’s, the trials begin and Draco’s scheduled to testify as one of the first witnesses for the prosecution. Harry’s there every day, from dusk till dawn, listening to all the people that have been hurt by the Family. There’s a total of seventeen criminals put on trial, but it’s just the first one of the many that are to come, once a solid case is built against them. Finally, Harry gets to listen to the long-awaited Draco Malfoy testimony, sitting in the public gallery that hasn’t changed a bit since he’s last been there. The same cold, dark wooden benches, those very same chains whose rattles still make him suppress a shiver, and two Dementors, silent and terrifying, watching over the prisoners. Harry’s heart goes out to Draco who’s reliving the nightmare of standing before the judges, only this time, he’s not the one on trial. He’s a crown witness, under the protection of the DMLE, just so this day could happen; so he could share everything he’s seen in the years he had worked with the accused, so he could help put them in Azkaban.
While Draco’s soft, calm breathing lulls him to sleep, Harry remembers how he once thought Draco’s hands were made to hold fragile things. Nestling himself tighter into the cradle of his body, Harry thinks that it just might include his heart, too.
“What on earth were you watching on the telly this time?” Harry mutters, leaning around Draco’s shoulder to look at him incredulously. It never failed to baffle him, the way Draco has taken to muggle TV like a fish to water and, frankly, how absolutely endearing it is.
“Tell me,” Draco whispers. He comes closer, so close their noses are almost touching and Harry could move just a fraction of an inch and their lips would touch, too. He pushes Harry a little, a weak, shaky nudge to his shoulder and Harry’s completely powerless to resist it.
“Putting me on the spot like that?” Draco asks, but there’s no malice in his voice. “All right,” he says softly, not looking at Harry.
who was willing to pay a hefty margin just to have something special in stock to apologise to his bored wife if the need arose. Quite a few of the items belonged in a museum and Draco was definitely going to mention that, feeling strangely melancholic about them getting closed up in a vault, or worse, displayed near tacky, mismatched furniture.
Draco moves to get up but Harry wraps his fingers around his wrist, lightly, trying to catch a breeze that’s already gone. “Draco.”
“Well?” he asks in a mocking tone. “Doesn’t look very noble if a Priori Incantatem lights up with an illegal spell, does it? Don’t want too much blood on their hands, just a little, to spice things up—”
“Don’t listen to that rubbish on the telly,” he said and placed a light kiss to Draco’s brow. “We’re the safest we can possibly be. The Muggles never pay any attention, the wizards have probably assumed we’re dead by now. It’s just you and me,” Harry whispered. “We’ll be alright.”
Draco did, leaning over his supine form, and kissed him, unbothered by all the saliva and the dull ache in his jaw. “What’s wrong?”
Malfoy isn’t too happy with being manhandled and in all his hissy squirming, Harry accidentally elbows him in the side, making him groan in pain through clenched teeth.
When they wake up in the wee hours of the morning, it’s still dark outside, but neither can bring themself to fall back asleep. Instead, they stay in bed and kiss, dizzily, between whispered conversations and careful touches. It should be awfully tacky but not even Draco, forever ready to mock such practices, says a single word when Harry finally gets to kiss that gorgeous beauty mark on his hip, laving it with attention until Draco lets out a laugh that breaks out from between his soft moans, saying Harry’s obsessed with it. Harry doesn’t deny it.
"We need to wait for Harry anyway, he has to decide who wins,” Seamus says, taking a swig of his beer.
“No,” Harry sighs, rubbing at his eyes. “I’m not a lawyer, it’s— complicated, okay? You’re a witness but also a criminal. You turned yourself in by coming to the DMLE but they’re willing to let you go if you help catch the rest. If you don’t, you’re—”
“So you’ve been watching,” Draco whispers, his head spinning from the proximity of the concealment spellwork, or perhaps the proximity of
“What all rich people do in places like this—he was looking for drugs,” Draco says, like it’s something obvious. “I knew that look instantly.”
The final straw, however, were the events from a year ago, back when the whole DMLE was on high alert, working full force on dismantling a huge smuggling operation consisting of a complex network of suppliers in both magical and Muggle London’s underbelly. Harry was running on fumes, fueled by stress, instant ramen and four hours of sleep a day. When he finally had a moment alone to breathe between all the raids and visits to St Mungo’s, Harry had to resort to the only relaxation method he knew that was quick, effective, and feasible in the privacy of his own bloody office. The price to pay for the short-lived endorphin high he so desperately needed could have been painfully, embarrassingly high—he was sitting behind his desk with both hands in his pants when he heard a knock on the door.
Later at night, they lie in their respective beds and neither is falling asleep anytime soon. Harry keeps thinking about unprofessional choices, Draco’s hair, and the way his hand slipped while shrinking the shirt which resulted in him having to see every single dip and muscle outlined in the fabric stretched over Malfoy’s chest. He also thinks about whatever the fuck could be keeping Malfoy awake as he tosses and turns two feet away.
Harry inclines his head. “There isn’t one. Once it closes with someone inside, it can’t be opened with any spells, only with the key. This one, to be exact,” he says, showing Draco a simple metal key he’s just fished out of his pouch, a little tarnished with age but still fully functional. He wiggles it in the air and puts it back into his jacket pocket.
Draco rolls his eyes as if Harry was the absolute worst nuisance that has ever happened to him. “Might as well get this out of the way, then,” he mutters, more to himself than Harry. “You do know I’m in love with you, yes?” he asks, his voice turning quieter with every word. “Quite madly, I’m afraid.”
As if on cue, Draco grabbed him by the hair at the back of his head, baring Harry’s throat, and sucked on the sensitive skin there. “May I take off your clothes, then?” he murmured, and that question had no right to be so arousing and yet, Harry only managed to make a breathy, incoherent sound and nod, not quite ready to give up Draco’s mouth on him.
Harry looks down at his hands, carefully folded in his lap. “Let’s go,” he says. “We need to try something.”
When Harry gets back to the Atrium, he lets out a relieved sigh. He can see Robards, standing in the distance by the central fountain. He’s pacing nervously and stops dead in his tracks, staring at Harry with a deer-in-the-headlights expression, his silent shock strangely disconcerting.
Draco looked… like usual, and these days, his usual in Harry’s eyes was rather sexy, wearing a tight, white button-down and dark tailored trousers to match, sitting somehow perfectly poised in what must have been the most uncomfortable bar stool in East London. In the corner of his eye, Harry saw McLaggen notice his entrance and then he turned back to his table so quickly, his companions probably didn’t even notice and Harry was glad he didn’t have to greet him.
The silhouette moves but doesn’t jump, unperturbed by Harry’s sudden entrance. His eyes slowly adapt to the dark and Harry can make out Malfoy’s pale face in the cell, his hair a little out of order. He’s still wearing his jacket and while it couldn’t have been comfortable, there’s a slight draft so Harry imagines he must have been cold. The small space smells like almonds as if Malfoy radiated it, and the stark contrast between the sweet scent and the damp, stone walls makes Harry huff in annoyance.
Harry makes a few noises, none of which is an actual word. He tries again. “Well, you know I have to—”
And, in all honesty, they were nice lips—Harry had to admit she was a very pretty girl but no matter how pretty the lips, the sounds coming from them were absolutely unacceptable. He miserably thought that all his internal monologues about not being judgemental while virtually judging people should be somewhat of an indication of some kind of cognitive dissonance but that was a topic for another time entirely.
Harry picks up the surprisingly thick file and opens it—he leafs through the first few pages and excitement spikes along his spine at the sight of a few names he already knows peppered here and there. There are pictures, maps with ticked locations, personal files on some witches and wizards he’s never seen and a few he knows all too well. His breath quickens. “What…”
At that, Harry feels slightly annoyed. “Listen, this isn’t personal, but have you maybe thought you’ll actually
with you today?” he asks, closing the books he’s currently reading with a loud smack. Harry stiffens, refusing to meet his eyes. “It can’t be me, I am delightful company,” he says off-handedly, “so what is wrong with you?”
Draco didn’t know what to do with any of it so he decided to sort of hold it close to his chest and ride out the high until it would finally all slip through his fingers.
Draco’s wand will be returned to him only after he testifies so Harry sends his stag Patronus to keep watch. It is allowed now—not for the defendants—but anyone giving their testimony can have a Patronus accompany them in order to avoid any unpleasantness associated with the Dementors present. Draco looks at Harry across the room as the stag dashes over to him, its large antlers illuminating the stand and bathing it in an ethereal glow. His Patronus lightly nudges its nose against Draco’s wrist and Harry notices Draco’s hand stop shaking.
Harry finds the florist studio easily enough after taking a short walk from the Ministry building. It’s visible even from a distance, a thick, green mane growing out of an otherwise grey side of a building—it looks even more beautiful as he approaches and a strong, heady smell of different types of flowers assaults him with increasing intensity. There are boxes and pots with a variety of plants lined up outside, each adorned with a small, black sign with the name of the species written in white chalk. Ivies and ferns hang under the awning and over the entrance, creating a lush, green curtain nearly covering the windows, letting only partial sunlight inside. Careful not to knock over any of the smaller succulent pots lined neatly on several tiny hanging shelves, Harry steps inside.
“Vice-head Potter, how ghastly!” Draco exclaims in mock-scandal. “How far can this Auror-on-Auror cruelty go?”
“Love, you had a chocolate bar on the way here,” Hermione looks at him in admonishment. “I honestly think you’ll be fine for a few more minutes, we’re just waiting for Harry.”
“I… suppose,” Draco said in a tight voice, the muscles in his back tensing and rippling under porcelain skin. “Can you gather some onto your hands? From— From my back?”
Standing on the curb as cars pass a little too close, with a streetlight directly over his head, Harry realises there will be no blast wave. He’s left with the fallout, slowly descending over him like speckles of golden dust and bringing a looming sense of finality. He has to physically shake himself out of it and a new wave of nausea hits as Harry starts to walk.
Their kisses grow in intensity and Harry finally finds some leverage—he grips Draco’s arse and grinds against him, once, twice, feeling that hot, hard length against his inner thigh. He knows the odds of them both coming in their pants like a couple of teenagers are growing with every minute, every time Draco rocks his hips and licks into his mouth. Harry wouldn’t mind it at this point, if only he didn’t know how much better it could feel with just a few… adjustments. Draco slides a cool, soft hand under his shirt and just leaves it there, ghosting over his ribs. Harry, in all his inexperience, deliberates if he should be the one to make that move, if maybe Draco feels like he shouldn’t push him, if the slight stutter to his movements has anything to do with restraint.
“All right,” Harry says, solid resolve settling into his bones. He stands up, dusting off his uniform. Malfoy watches his every move, splayed out in the dingy chair as if every seat in the world was his throne to sit upon. A thrill goes up Harry’s spine at the thought of what he’s about to do—this whole affair has been rather unprecedented and the privileged little bubble they have inserted Malfoy into is about to burst. Now, they have to play by the rules of Harry’s world, at least until he reports to Kingsley and Robards and the three of them figure out what the fuck they are going to do with this. But Malfoy doesn’t need to know that. “Stand up, I’m done with you for now,” he says coldly, the tips of his fingers grazing the thigh holster he’s wearing. The worn handle of his holly wand reaches out to him with a familiar ripple of magic—it’s a strange kind of comfort, but since small reassurances have never been an abundance in his life, Harry welcomes it without question.
There’s another set of footsteps reverberating in the empty hall and Harry turns to see Draco running towards them with his gun aimed straight at Robards. He’s hurt—a trickle of blood drips down his face from a large wound at his temple, sticking his fringe into a bloody cluster, his suit is singed in a few places, and he has a split lip. But all Harry can focus on are his eyes—shining with unrestrained, wild fury, like two pools of molten silver as he zones in on Robards.
Harry’s stomach clenches at those two words; it’s significant to hear Draco confirm it out loud, and it’s more than enough to make Harry’s breath catch in his throat. Draco
Draco’s sitting on top of him, all flushed skin and perfect teeth, and he’s so beautiful, Harry forgets about everything else for a moment. “
“If it weren’t for him, we wouldn’t have known you’d be there,” Ron says quietly, and they both know what it means. They wouldn’t have come. No-one would have known what went down in an empty Atrium with no witnesses. And sure, Draco still would have shot Robards, but then, he would have died there in Harry’s arms and the Family’s goons would have taken care of Harry shortly after, just like they had planned.
“Prat,” Draco retorts and flops back against Harry. His back is warm, he smells like citrus and spice, and he’s trying to hide his grin. It’s all platonic, and good, and feels like coming home.
insistent once their eyes are on the prize,” he says. “Most of them looked like Krum, all shoulders and brooding, Dmitri was a poor example, as you can imagine.”
Draco raises an eyebrow. “Again?” He takes slow, measured steps towards Harry, like a predator already salivating at the prey before him.
“When the sponge was good, the buttercream was awful, when the cream was delicious, the decorations were horrid, when the flavour was nice, the sponge was as dry as paper—” She stops and exhales sharply. “You get the point.”
Malfoy sighs, a little impatiently. “There are other spells, Potter, that can cause pain when applied with imagination.”
Harry sees black in his peripheral vision and stops in his tracks as another man in a black suit, this time with sunglasses to match, hurriedly passes by the Floos. Frowning, Harry watches him go into a lift and then, he’s gone. He takes a look around the atrium and counts three more men in suits, different heights and ages, all clad in black, all walking through the crowd without ever stopping or talking to anyone. Harry shakes it off as simply strange; it’s not exactly illegal either, so there’s not much he can do about men wearing clothes that are accidentally also worn by a person that annoys him.
—the reason lies in Harry himself, in every sharp intake of breath that wants to swallow him whole, in the way Draco tries to hide his face so Harry doesn’t see the tears drying at the corners of his eyes. Once again, it’s Draco who lays down the rules, with Harry helplessly obeying, worshipping every moan that rips out of Draco without him calculating whether it’s okay to let it out in the first place.
Sick, nauseating shivers took over all of his nerves as Harry rocked back and forth, twisting his fingers into his hair.
—for a fraction of a second, he peeks at the open magazine where a picture of none other than Harry Potter takes up the whole two-page spread. The Saviour still manages to look slightly uncomfortable in the moving photograph, smiling weakly as the interview title slapped across the page suggests yet another charity the man apparently can’t help but support.
It was a quiet, breathless request and for a second, Harry thought he was imagining things but there was no mistake in the black of Draco’s pupils swallowing the silver of his eyes. Harry thought about crossing rivers and burning bridges, whether this spark of a moment could become a fire, a lighthouse, or would it burn out like a match and he should savour the flame while it was alight.
The little girl smiles for real this time, a huge, bright grin with a few baby teeth missing here and there, and she looks down at her boots. “You’re cool,” she says quietly.
Harry tries not to think about the fact Draco has just called him sweet. Instead, he bumps their shoulders together. “You’ll like it, I promise.”
“If you agree to the conditions, I need to put you under a Surveillance Spell. It’s nothing fancy, just—”
Harry and Draco both knew they weren’t going back anytime soon. Not after what Draco’s family was accused of. Not after Harry had shown up at his lover’s house one night, with a suitcase and two sets of muggle documents arranged with the help of a few trusted friends.
“Does this,” Draco whispered, and leaned in, and touched Harry’s lips with his own, “feel like I’ve moved on?”
“God, Draco,” Harry breathes and pushes him onto his back. He slides his thigh between Draco’s legs and sets off an agonising rhythm, slowly rubbing his cock against Draco’s hip, up and down, humming at the delicious friction, feeling Draco’s pubic hair get wet with his precome. They’ve never got actually
Finally, Harry’s mind keeps going back to all those… moments; all the things that kept happening between them. And while one or two slip-ups could have been called an accident and moved on from, those fleeting seconds when he felt there was something
Harry lets out a small laugh and turns his head on the headrest, facing Draco. “No. I just… maybe envy that a little.”
“He could have done anything he wanted with me and no-one would ever know,” Malfoy says and looks through the window again. “And—as much as it pains me to admit it—” He rolls his eyes. “He’s been nothing but kind. And—cherry on top—he is now tasked with keeping me alive until the trials,” Malfoys adds with a smirk.
They talk details after that and Harry knows the drill, more or less. His heart is still hammering as he goes over possible scenarios in his head. Malfoy betraying him and running off into the sunset. Malfoy getting killed by a hired hitman. Harry committing a crime of passion and strangling Malfoy with his bare hands.
It becomes very apparent, very fast, that no amount of soap will wash out the image of Draco tonight that lingers at the back of his mind, the way he looked at him and talked about all the things Harry thinks about when he’s alone. And he thinks about it now, the insistent tug of the spell dancing along his core, and Harry digs his fingernails into his palm just thinking about it—how easy would it be to just let that tug guide him over the edge.
“I should have expected this outing to be rather like one of my late grandmother’s soirées,” he says abruptly, leaning on the backrest with his hands crossed, “but I urge you, do try to unwind, Au- I mean,
“Are you a wizard or not?” Draco says urgently, moving to suck on his nipple. Harry gasps and buries his hand in Draco’s hair. “Cast a Stasis Spell before I Apparate us to the bathroom
Harry sighs, his mind racing, thinking what Draco could possibly want to ask him. It’s not really unexpected if Harry thinks about it, turning whatever’s between them into a
“Don’t be a bitch!” Ginny rolls her eyes with a smile. “I am about to change your life with the date I’ve got cooking up for you.”
Draco brings his hands up to rub his temples, elbows propped up on his desk. “Potter, I know what you’re thinking,” he sighs. “Correct me if I’m wrong—you will smell the bloody potion and embark on a lunatic mission to find your One and Only and live happily ever after,” he recites, peeking up a Harry. “Amortentia isn’t… an oracle, it’s just a reflection, the results vary from person to person, and
Harry chuckles at the image of Draco coming out to Voldemort, asking for boy advice. Something stings in his chest at the thought that after so many years, they’re finally able to joke about those things. “That’s… fair.”
Before Harry can get the conversation back on track, there’s a loud knock on his door and without waiting for his ‘I’m busy’, Ginny Weasley barges in with a content smile, Luna treading lightly behind her. Ginny plops down in one of the armchairs to the side, never taking her eyes off Harry, while Luna bends down over Draco to wrap her arms around his neck and kiss the top of his head, their blond hair mingling together into a shiny, moonlight mess. Draco smiles a genuine, soft smile up at her and Harry is transfixed for a second but then, Ginny pointedly clears her throat, smiling mischievously.
One of these days, Harry should maybe think about what exactly it means. To him, to Draco. Not now. Just, at some point.
“It’s revenge,” Draco said, reaching behind his back and tugging at Harry’s belt. “Getting back at him.”
“Take this.” Kingsley reaches into his pocket and produces a small, empty vial. “It’s a Portkey. I can’t lift the anti-Apparition wards on the whole perimeter, it’ll just make it easier for them to get inside. Grab what you can and go,” he says quickly, pushing the vial into Harry’s hand.
“Mmm, no,” Harry mutters, pretty sure he’s not. Still, he feels exhausted. “We should go before they all—”
“As the Muggles say, don’t hate the player, Weasley,” Draco muses, unable to hide his satisfaction. Harry chuckles next to him and kisses his cheek. Draco feels his face getting a little warm but he can definitely get used to Potter being all over him. Especially—
. Harry wants everything Draco is willing to give, wants to strip himself bare and offer himself up for the taking. Draco wraps an arm around his neck, the other around his waist and kisses him again. He can feel the tip of Draco’s tongue brush against his lips and opens up to that hot wetness, licking and sucking as they both scramble for purchase, gripping each other’s shirts and groaning into the searing kiss.
“He ate just before you came so it was a matter of time before he was out,” Harry says. “Babies are sort of like Ron. Not that hard to manage once you figure it out.”
He lay there for a while, covered in his own mess, and thought how completely and royally fucked he was—all because of an ex-enemy who wore sexy clothes and wasn’t afraid to be mean to him.
Malfoy’s eyes darken at Harry’s brazen display of wandless magic. It ignites something ferocious deep down in Harry’s belly—he’s not the bragging type, usually choosing the efficiency of a wand channelling his magic over the flashy displays and the hand-waving that wandless entails. Still, he savours the faint tingling at the pads of his fingers and the smell of ozone strong enough to overpower the dull stench of rust and linoleum.
was the insane one, as if leaving Draco was ever an option and rage roared throughout his body—rage at Draco, at the Vault Man, at the whole bloody world, Muggles and wizards alike. A world that couldn’t stop fighting for five fucking minutes. All strength left him and Harry turned to leave, to plop down on the sofa and wait until Draco calmed down, until he came to lie down with him and then they would never discuss it again.
Draco just stared and he looked so small in the middle of the living room, barefoot and helpless, and Harry thought he might go insane. He wrapped his other arm around that slender waist, not to lose any of his warmth, to make it count, as he clasped Draco tightly into the cradle of his body. His shoulders hunched over protectively, his head bowed, Harry touched the shell of Draco’s ear with his lips until Draco’s arm instinctively wrapped around him.
Harry grabs his wrist, careful not to touch any of the cuts and bruises. “Oh, no, no, no. Sit,” he says coldly, jerking his head in the direction of the bed. Malfoy stares at Harry’s fingers wrapped around his hand and tries to free himself, softly at first, but Harry tightens his hold. Malfoy isn’t weak or frail by any standard, he’s quite fit actually, with tight, tense muscle curving along his chest and arms, going down his back and thighs, visible even under his trousers. He has the slender physique of a Quidditch player, fast and agile, with reserves of hidden strength and probably the stamina to match. Harry wonders how and when the slim, porcelain lordling he remembers from school turned into the man before him. He supposes he’s changed as well; Auror training, while strenuous and boring at times, has filled him out where needed and Harry himself isn’t a lanky, dark-skinned boy with knobbly knees anymore. He uses that strength, gently but determinedly, steering Malfoy to the bed.
All that happens next is decidedly the most mind-blowing, filthy-good, toe-curling sex Harry has ever had. Draco preps him with excruciating thoroughness, driving his fingers into him, and sucks him off from time to time, just to rile Harry up, to keep his arousal on a dangerously high level. By the time there are three fingers up his arse and a pool of precome glistening around his navel, Harry’s dizzily begging Draco to
“I left because…” Draco trails off and sighs, looking at the ceiling as if it holds a perfect answer to placate Harry’s anger. He tries again. “I needed time. I’ll have you know I honestly did visit my mother and found her in good health no less. There were also some… real estate issues that needed my attention, and well. I really did have to sort it all out,” he says quickly, listing all the reasons as if he’d learned them by heart. He toys with the hem of his jacket when he quietly adds: “Also, as much as I’d hate to admit it, I was scared.”
Draco shrugs, watching a small crowd of older kids strut by, carrying snacks and cups of cocoa. “You’re small and defenceless, you would be very easy to kidnap,” he says sagely. “And it’s no fun,” he adds.
“Relax, Potter, I know you wouldn’t voluntarily say something like that.” He shoots Harry a weak smile but quickly looks away and something ugly pushes inside Harry’s chest. “I can only imagine what mind games those two have stooped to in order to get you so agitated.”
The tense silence that fell upon the room would have been disconcerting if it weren’t for the delicious little flush slowly taking over Potter’s face. It made his freckles stand out and something stirred in Draco’s stomach. Seeing Potter’s questioning glance, he continued.
.” Another thrust, and this time Draco let out a hoarse shout followed by a series of whimpers and he pushed back, responding beautifully to Harry’s thrusts, clenching around him like a vice.
“Well that’s just fucking fantastic,” he sighs and points to his flawless shoes. “These probably cost more than a fortnight in whatever hotel we find in this hellhole.”
Harry doesn’t know what he’s been expecting up until now, but when his bosses break the news to him, he needs a moment to collect his thoughts. In just twenty-four hours, the whole DMLE was put on full alert. They’ve detained eleven people and every single one of Malfoy’s tips has turned out to be valuable so far. The detainees aren’t any big fish, mostly business owners and a few bankers, but Ron has informed him with the utmost satisfaction that all have been spilling everything they know and the investigation is going smoother than they had dared to hope.
interested in women. Harry just hugged her very tightly and was relieved to find out that the only thing he felt in his heart at the news was love and joy for his friend’s happiness. And somehow, even though his chest still felt tight, in the bracket of her arms he felt safe and he managed to whisper into her hair that he thought he might be bisexual. His limbs still hurt from the Body Bind and his throat was a little scratchy, but the relief Harry felt that day made him realise that the world wasn’t going to end over who he might one day love.
Harry reached for the lube and ripped the packet open with his teeth, then poured some over his fingers, and he didn’t want to wait for it to warm up, just slid his middle finger down between Draco’s cheeks and kissed away the sharp hiss it drew. “Tell me if it’s too much.”
Draco hums. “He would… accost me, at times and, well, I obviously didn’t mind, being nineteen, horny and repressed. And then, I went to France for my Potions Apprenticeship which made things considerably easier,” he says. “Mind you, he wasn’t some great big love of my life, it was purely physical,” Draco adds, as if reading Harry’s mind. “We kept doing it until…”
A dark chuckle. “I can… resist the spells. For a short time,” he says, letting out another low laugh when Draco sneaks his other hand around and down his waist. The other arsecheek cannot remain unattended and Draco uses the leverage to slot their hips closer together.
“I’ll take that as a strangely-spun compliment,” she says and rolls her eyes, trying not to grin. “Although I am glad to have been sorted Gryffindor in the end.”
“You could get us both killed!” Malfoy hisses, casting a worried look through the window. For a second, he looks straight at Harry, making him start, and then Harry remembers Malfoy can’t see him, even though his gaze lingers. It transports him back onto the Hogwarts Express, years ago, and Harry can’t shake the feeling Malfoy somehow knows.
“They’re all the same!” Draco scoffs. “Honestly, I’m starting to understand why so many victorian women killed their husbands or drowned their children in bathtubs. They must have been just bored into madness.”
Quando il diavolo ti accarezza, vuole l’anima - When the devil caresses you, he wants the soul (Italian proverb)
flakes off piece by piece leaving Harry like an exposed nerve, naked and pulsing with shivering need. Draco often seems so disarmingly unsure when he stares at Harry’s lips, sometimes a little shaky when he straddles Harry’s lap and his hands move to his belt, but always silent in his visceral hunger. The only thing that’s unfailingly
Draco’s movements grew stuttered and Harry’s body was just a tangle of nerves and tissue, his bollocks drawn tight, cock red and leaking against his stomach. He let out a string of weak, broken moans and Draco lowered himself to capture his mouth. He was beautiful, all strong hands, wet lips, and twitching wings, he was fucking
Everything about Draco is contrary to what Harry has always believed to be true. The things he learns vary from mildly disturbing to view-changing in their crushing simplicity and cutting bluntness. That darkness Draco carries inside him with all the self-inflicted discipline of a twisted monk has seeped into Harry’s alleged purity, twisting into the thin spaces in between, teaching him about a whole spectrum of grey between the black and white lenses he’s always used separately to look at the world. There’s a thing about diffusion he remembers from one of his Potions classes—even two hard, smooth metal plates, when pressed close enough, will pass their atoms into the other, exchange their particles back and forth, slowly blurring the seam that once separated them. And just like with diffusion, Harry can see his own light shine through the cracks and reveal the Draco underneath.
’ written on it in a neat script could make things very, very complicated. Harry isn’t brave enough to think about what it would mean for them if the feeling was mutual. Which Harry doesn’t think it is. Sure, they have… moments. Moments that make Harry’s heart stop, moments he thinks about before bed, moments that stretch out into something longer in his dreams before he startles awake, hot and bothered and… well. But it’s normal for two male friends who are attracted to other men to appreciate the other’s looks.
And it’s not like Harry doesn’t know—Draco made his feelings abundantly clear, just minutes ago—still, hearing him say it out loud makes Harry’s heart leap and he does everything in his power not to pounce on Draco right then and there, taking it slow be damned.
Harry groans. “Wait. Wait, wait— A girl is coming over to babysit and she’ll find a grown man, who, might I add,
He’s only half-present when they finish talking and robotically repeats what he’s been told; he promises to get Malfoy on board, to get him to agree to their conditions, and to keep the bastard alive. He barely hears Ron wish him good luck in a strained voice.
Draco glances at him with an arched brow and turns back to his food. “Public loos, cheap wine, Diagon Alley,” he says without missing a beat.
Draco opens his mouth, closes it again. There it is, that telling little crease between his brows, and Harry rushes to make it disappear.
Deliberately, he didn’t go anywhere near Harry’s cock, not yet—Draco wanted him desperate, begging, wanted to take care of him so Harry could lay back and enjoy the ride. His legs were bent at an angle that didn’t allow much movement so Draco was surprised to feel Harry’s fingers tangling in his hair and pulling.
“I want to—” Draco gulped, brushing his hand up and down Harry’s flank. Going lower, curling under his knee and up his calf.
“But,” he sighs dramatically, a tragic hero burdened with the many mysteries of an uncaring universe. “But you’re bi, yeah? You have like”—he pauses and frowns, clearly conducting some complicated thought processes—”twice the pool any of us does! You could shag anyone!”
They step into Draco’s small office—still bigger than Harry’s, which Draco likes to remind him about any time the occasion arises—and take their usual spots: Draco in an over-the-top leather chair behind his desk and Harry in a victorian armchair facing the desk. He plops the paper bag on the desk and Draco immediately snatches it and takes a whiff of the fragrant chocolate pastries. “Ah, yes,” he hums, “you’ve done well, Potter, very well.”
Everything about Maggie was nice, pretty and proper. Everything was just as one would expect it to be in a young girl. Everything except for her shrill, high-pitched, Merman-out-of-the-water, Mandrake-out-of-the-soil voice which she was unable to bring down an octave or two (or five) no matter how many times Harry had asked. And no matter how lovely of her it was to show up to what she had initially thought would be a baby takeover, it was still utterly baffling how the woman had ever gotten her job in the first place.
Harry wonders if it’s something about him. Dating was never high on the list of his priorities, mainly due to a noseless madman dearly hoping to murder him for seventeen years of his life. And then, came Auror training. And then, he got his dream job. And then… Harry wonders.
Harry licks his lips, satisfied with the way Draco drops back onto the pillows with a groan. He comes right back up, apparently keen on watching him and a shiver of excitement washes over Harry—he makes a mental note to look Draco in the eyes as he sucks him. Harry lets go for a second to lick his hand—Draco exhales a long, strained breath as Harry does it, a slow swipe of tongue over his palm, and spreads it all over Draco’s cock in a few lazy strokes. He gives it another tentative taste, licking off the precome beading at the tip, and finds it all right—it has a faint salty-bitter tang to it and it’s not bad, especially with the unholy sounds Draco is making. Harry’s own cock gives a little twitch at that, seeing how the lightest touch takes Draco apart, how the muscles in his thighs contract, and how shallow his breathing is.
“And you,” Draco turns to Harry like a hawk, making him freeze. He looks like he can read people’s minds and that’s the absolute last thing Harry needs right now, considering he’s just been thinking Draco is hot and not interested in him in that way. “Do you have my brioche? I wasn’t joking, you know.”
Draco Malfoy is secretly soft—that’s all it is and Harry wants to laugh into the oblivion Draco would send him into with a few lazy swings of his wand if Harry ever mentioned it. Draco craves physical touch probably as much as Harry loves giving it; but it was a scary line to cross at first, to allow those touches just between the two of them, maybe part of it was the fact they never acknowledged it out loud. Harry remembers the questioning looks Draco aimed his way at first, as if asking permission, asking a thousand things while not really needing an answer. They still never talk about it, how Draco sometimes adjusts Harry’s collar, or how Harry unceremoniously plants his feet in Draco’s lap when he joins him on the sofa. Their friends never comment on it either, perhaps attributing it to their peculiar relationship as a whole.
Keeping Draco’s hair in an iron grip with one hand, Harry grabs the base of his cock with the other and guides it over Draco’s lips, smearing wetness all over them, hissing as his slit lightly catches on Draco’s teeth. As if on cue, Draco sticks his tongue further out and Harry drags the head of his cock against it, back and forth, in slow, shallow thrusts, going a little deeper each time. Draco lets go of his own cock and moves his hands up Harry’s thighs, opening his mouth wider—an invitation Harry’s more than eager to accept.
“It’s very risky,” Harry says tiredly, “it’s not just going to the shop, or booking a room, someone could see us, their memories can be extracted. We can’t have a trail of Obliviated Muggles behind us, someone might see a pattern—”
It never fails to render Draco speechless, to make him a pile of string-taut flesh and bones, the way Potter just loves getting fucked, how he’s desperate for it, how amazing he looks on his hands and knees, or with his legs wrapped around Draco’s waist, or spread over any given flat surface. He’s always so enthusiastic and demanding, and quite particular about it, too, so much so that he practically reduced Draco to a mere service top, doing Potter’s bidding and clinging to his own sanity, especially once Potter is adamant on getting his brains fucked out.
Harry feels a little bad as at that moment, he feels every hard knot in his back and realises how hard he’s gripping his glass. Draco’s sultry voice only adds to his nervousness, so he tries taking a few deep breaths. “You realise having drinks with witnesses hunted by the mob is not exactly in my job description?” he asks tightly, taking a large gulp.
Harry’s hikes up Draco’s leg over his hip and slots them closer—the change of angle punches the breath out of him and Harry rubs their cocks together in sharp, relentless thrusts and Draco arches up to match the pace, dragging blunt fingernails across his back. Harry’s muscles burn with the force of his thrusts, arse clenching on every plunge as he kisses Draco messily, hands roaming over smooth skin, calves, thighs, and up, finally clutching at his waist, hard enough to bruise.
Not slowing his steps, he takes off his sunglasses and puts them in his pocket. Piercing, silver eyes sweep around the Atrium, following a group of Aurors heading to a late lunch break; he quickly eyes the Floos, the guest exits, and all three Apparition points, memorising their exact location—cold, calculating and vigilant.
“Draco,” Harry sighs more than says, his heart hammering so hard he suspects Draco can hear it. “Please. Tell me.”
It’s refreshing to talk to him, Harry thinks; Draco’s voice is always smooth and low, and sometimes it’s so calming, Harry wants to ask him for a story, just to listen a little bit more.
He shifted them a bit, and Harry let out a quiet moan at the first touch to his cock as Draco’s slender fingers wrapped around his shaft. After a few teasing strokes, Draco moved his hand lower, fingers ghosting right where Harry wanted them the most, and he arched at the soft pressure right at his hole.
“Thank you Luna,” Draco inclines his head with a serious expression. “Potter might be a lackwit at times, but he sure does make an excellent pillow.”
Draco slumped against him, defeated, and Harry immediately caught him into his arms, kissing the top of his head.
The footsteps are getting closer and suddenly, Ron and Hermione are by his side, wide-eyed and terrified as they watch Draco’s wound close up a bit—still bleeding, still deadly, but controlled. Draco’s letting out shallow, laboured breaths as he looks at Harry with something akin to a smirk.
He leaves his jacket in his office and treads down the hall to the Forensics Lab, clutching the bag with the brioches—an offering to appease the Dragon that dwells within. He knocks on the door twice, having learned his lesson to never just waltz into their workspace, let alone Draco’s private office. Harry wagers Draco keeps his subordinates (
Panic creeps its way into Harry’s stomach at being found out, so easy to read he might as well wear it on his forehead. “I wasn’t going to—” He shuts his mouth, thinking of something to say. “You know I can access any evidence filed by the DMLE? Forensics isn’t a separate entity in that capacity,” Harry says defensively.
“Potter,” Malfoy hisses, “is the show really necessary? I came willingly, I gave you what you need—”
When one turns the lights on in a basement, all the cockroaches scatter to the darkest, filthiest corners, to hide under the debris, and wait. Venomous spiders hole up amongst the intricate webs they’ve been learning to spin since they first emerged into the world. All those born in the dark eventually return to the womb that has nursed them to wait out the fallout and be reborn, all freshly-adjusted to the new light.
He looked around their empty office, thoroughly bored with the day he’s had so far. Draco was absent today, due to certain…
It dawns on Harry then—why Draco is reluctant to let him go, why he’s so clingy all of a sudden, what that serious glance actually means, and Harry’s heart stutters. He promises himself to make sure Draco will never have to doubt his feelings and the idea is so ridiculous in itself, Harry chuckles. “Which one?”
Guiding Draco’s head, Harry lifts his cock and lets him lick up the seam of his balls, suck them into his mouth until they’re tight and wet with saliva. Draco moves up and buries his nose in the thick, dark curls nestling around Harry’s cock, moaning, savouring his scent, making Harry shudder with want so much, he immediately tilts Draco’s head back and lines himself up. In one slow stroke, he pushes into Draco’s hot, open mouth and down his throat, feeling him relax around the girth until it’s as deep as it can go. Draco’s breathing harshly through his nose, letting out soft, needy whimpers, making Harry’s eyes roll back at the vibrations. His cock dribbles more precome down the back of Draco’s throat as Harry recalls his fantasy and tries to push a little deeper, revelling in the sight of Draco’s depraved mouth stretched around him like that.
“Thank you,” Luna flashes him a bright smile. It falters then, replaced by a thoughtful moue and a tilt of her head. “Draco,” she says, waving and gesturing around him as if swatting off some imaginary creatures. “Don’t be sad. I still think you would make the best—”
He didn’t dare look at Draco’s face right now so instead, Harry lifted his oil-stained hand to his face and took another intoxicating drag of Draco’s scent.
Harry Potter kissed like he meant it, with a hot-focused intensity that should have landed him a prominent Seeker position but instead, threw him into a life on the edge and, in consequence, straight into Draco’s arms, fitting in that jagged space like he belonged there all along. He gasped hotly into Draco’s mouth and moved to kiss down his neck, the slow drag of his teeth setting Draco’s skin aflame. It wasn’t enough, Draco needed to be
“What was that about?” Draco frowns, not looking at Harry. Harry though, watches him intently until Draco turns around. “What?”
Draco’s face goes a little ashen, even with the slightly darker complexion of his Glamour. “Oh that’s sweet,” he says, his voice a little high. “You’re under the impression that I'll go willingly.”
“It doesn’t look that bad,” Harry said, insistent and slightly miffed someone would dare describe any part of Draco in any words other than
Draco has had a new partner for a few weeks now, and the man’s arse is one of undeniable beauty, pert and firm, and always tightly clad in a pair of delicious, albeit non-designer, black trousers. Those enticing buttocks have become Draco’s calling, the core of his obsession, and the air of mystery only adds to his fully-established fantasy of what exactly he would do with a handful of
The babysitter arrived about an hour after his friends left and by that time, Harry had decided to just roll with it—knowing his tendency to dive into things headfirst, he was more partial to see what happens than to think about the possibilities of what might have been for the next week. Maggie seemed nice enough—dark skin, curly hair, and a pleasant smile showing off her even, white teeth. Harry never expected something like that to matter to him that much, but after the Archie Calamity, he was positive he liked teeth. As in, he liked it when they were
Suddenly, a well-aimed Knockback Jinx hits him square in the chest and Harry flies backwards into what’s left of the chandelier. He can feel a few pieces of sharp, broken metal drive into his back and he shouts as the stabbing pain spreads across his body. His wand is nowhere to be seen and Harry can’t get up, watching Robards run towards him with his wand in the air.
“Yes, please,” Potter murmurs against his temple, smiling as Draco’s hands instinctively grab onto his hips.
Malfoy is an intimidating presence beside him, determined and silent apart from the soft gasp he lets out at Harry’s words. “I fought a war, Dmitri,” Harry continues, slowly releasing the valve on his magic, tightening his grip in a careful, excruciating show of power. “They’ll just say I’m crazy if my hand…
He worked his way down the massive appendages, combing his fingers through the silk-soft feathers, straightening them out and thinking how they would feel against his face and cock, of all things. There wasn’t a part of Draco he hadn’t imagined touching him that way—Harry thought about it constantly, on days when he’d let his mind drift off, on days they’d spent in their cramped office, surrounded by their mingled smells and the scratch of quills on paper. He had thought of slender hands and bony fingers, watching Draco fold his letters, carefully stroking the expensive parchment with his fingertips. He thought about plump lips worried under perfect teeth, or wrapped around a beer bottle and slick with moisture. There was that one time when Draco was reaching for something on a high shelf, and Harry caught a glimpse of a toned stomach, a trail of hair disappearing under Draco’s belt, and watched, hypnotised, as the lean muscle moved under porcelain skin, and imagined putting his hand there.
, and Draco just gives in, twirling his tongue between the digits, starts to slowly suck on them, and in this position, he couldn’t go limp even if he tried, not with the way Potter’s hole gives his cock little tantalising squeezes, one, and another, and another.
“Auror Potter, is that what I think it is?” Harry almost drops the bottle at Draco’s voice in his ear, so close he can feel the warmth of his breath tickling the curls behind his ear. Draco laughs as Harry looks at him with annoyance.
The response comes flying two minutes later ad Harry opens it, grinning at Draco’s neat, pointy script:
“No,” Potter said on an exhale, his voice strangely distorted by the billows of smoke, thick and white against the cold December air. “But I’m willing to share,” he added and took another drag.
“What did you normally do there, then?” Harry can’t help but ask. He can’t really imagine Malfoy talking investment and wealth management with decrepit old men or entertaining dowagers with biscuits and tea.
, Draco shouldn’t be groping strangers at a bar while having a price on his head. As to Harry’s personal issue with the whole thing, he refuses to say it, or even think about it, alcohol still flowing in his blood, propelling those awfully inconvenient thoughts.
“—and absolutely brilliant,” Draco finishes, throwing the wand away and, once again, assaulting Harry with lips, teeth, and tongue.
Warm fingers wrapped around his elbow and Draco was led to the large sofa that stood against the window. Harry sat them down and started casting without a word, the complicated incantations falling off his tongue in a gentle susurration, and the tense crease in his brow slowly dissipated when the diagnostics didn’t indicate any harm. It was awfully distracting, to have him so close, with his scent, and voice, and that jacket with the onyx clasps, and all Draco could do was clench his teeth in that familiar, aristocratic way so no-one would notice. What was worse, Potter was entirely non-smug about it—just calm and focused, casting with razor-sharp efficiency and he looked so bloody
The waitress is exchanging pleasantries with Archie, and Harry is having a tiny mental breakdown. Should he go through with it? Should he get the man’s hopes up? Knowing himself, Harry would feel bad about not being attracted to him and sit through the date out of politeness. Then, he would probably feel even worse for having to cut all ties, so he would lead the man on, probably invite him to the wedding, after spending a few sleepless nights thinking about sad, old, lonely people sitting in their stuffy homes and petting their cats, crying about their grandchildren not visiting anymore. And then, it would have gone too far to break it off and thus, Harry would wind up marrying the equivalent of his late grandfather because old people make him soft. Dear God, what if he invited Harry to his place afterwards? Harry shudders at the thought and, again today, wishes Draco was there to say something, anything that would make sense. More sense than Harry spiralling into planning a life with an old man he’s never met because apparently, Harry Potter can be guilted into marrying and spending his life with people who seem frail and helpless.
being a good soldier, thrown into the fray like some lesser cannon fodder,” he says, his brows knitted into something akin to concern, like he’s trying to understand why, when Harry is anything but lesser. It makes Harry’s palms sweat. “I know you were raised by Muggles. How did that go?” he asks, looking right at Harry. “And then, you were raised by Dumbledore, yes? Or shall I say,
“It was about you,” Harry whispers to himself, helplessly watching as the St Mungo’s Healers take over.
“Hello,” Draco replies with a raised eyebrow that quickly curls into a frown when Potter palms him through his trousers. “You’re on the clock, Jezebel,” he says in a low tone, still baring his neck for Potter to mouth along the column of his throat.
There’s a warm hand on his shoulder, squeezing lightly. “I’ll stop you right there.” Draco looks at him seriously, his grey eyes a thunderstorm. “There’s
Harry doesn’t even notice they’ve approached their last week on the run, partially thanks to Draco’s unparallelled skill in distracting him—not only with the way he looks, or the things he can do with his mouth, but also with the way he
Draco pushes him back a few steps until he has Harry against a large oak tree in a small clearing off the nearest path. The sounds of commotion are almost completely drowned out by the thick foliage around them and Harry watches Draco take a steadying breath. “You have to immediately Apparate us to our room because—the things I want to do to you right now might be
Draco responded immediately, winding his arms around Harry’s shoulders, burying his fingers in dark curls. They kissed, deep and slow, until a loud knock startled them apart. Draco froze in his arms and Harry planted one chaste kiss at the corner of his mouth.
Potter is grinning with his mouth slightly parted and the only thing Draco has left to do is to suck on his fingers to stifle any sounds threatening to come out and expose their compromising position. He briefly considers whether falling on someone’s cock
Ron pauses and then snorts. Shaking his head, he takes a large gulp of ale. “Not the only oblivious one, eh?” He smiles wryly, regarding them with a twinkle in his eye. “Guess I have two best men now, that’s wicked.”
His legs give out under him and Harry lowers himself onto the couch, watching Draco as if making sure he’s not a mirage.
A long time ago, Harry had promised himself he wouldn’t make Malfoy a one-off. No matter how badly Harry wanted him, no matter how fuckable Draco looked filing invoices or opening a bloody window, there was always something painfully
works, to see what makes him click and smash the big red button even though there’s a ‘danger’ sign right above it.
they’ve made feels like the most real, sincere thing he’s done in months, maybe years, and he greets his old, rule-defying self like a beloved relative that’s been gone just way too long. Draco had questioned the way Harry navigates the world, and Harry hadn't had a good answer. Now, it's not the ‘sex and power’ shite, but Harry finds himself dusting off old memories of himself after the war, and discovering they weren’t worth it in the first place. He had been searching for purpose after the war, but that search had
“If you must know, we stopped by on our way to Magical Games and Sports,” Ginny says. “I have a bone to pick with them.”
Arousal spikes through Harry as their clothed erections rub together. “What about breakfast?” He asks weakly.
. He sprints to the bedroom to change out of his pyjama pants, not paying any attention to the head in his fireplace, screaming something about ‘limited visit times’ and ‘still very weak’. Remembering about his manners, Harry runs back to thank him and Apparates on the spot.
“Good to know I’m running up against death and Azkaban,” says Harry. “Well? Do you want the food or not?”
Harry chokes on his saliva under the Cloak and quietly thanks Merlin and Morgana none of the Muggles heard him. He chooses to believe what Zabini just said is some kind of a Slytherin inside joke, and tries not to think about all of Malfoy’s lewd, shameless comments, or his ridiculous, messy hair, or his black leather gun holster. The whole comment is just ridiculous, and Harry can’t imagine he would ever cross that line with a witness, and Malfoy no less.
“Amazing—” He praises, shaking with the intensity of it, peppering kisses all over Harry’s face, his hands roaming over Harry’s back and kneading his arse. “You’re
has accompanied Harry wherever Draco Malfoy was concerned, ricocheting between them like a stray bullet that never really lost its momentum. It’s been present at the back of his head, along the tendons in his fingers, simmering at the base of his spine, and buzzing around his very core. When they were eleven, Draco wanted to be his friend, he wanted Harry in his circle, and Harry didn’t share that want; all he wanted was for Draco to stay away. He wanted Draco to do a lot of things: shut up, get lost, don’t say that,
“And the cat’s out of the bag,” says Draco. “See this… submission—and I use the term just to avoid the word 'meekness’—manifests in ways not everyone sees, Potter. Regular people perceive it as kindness, politeness,” he chuckles. “What’s more, they admire it.”
At the first lick of magic spilling from Harry’s wand and twirling around Malfoy’s injury, he gasps and slams his hand down and over Harry’s free one, wrapping his fingers tightly around Harry’s wrist, squeezing it so hard, his knuckles turn white.
Suddenly, he’s not hungry anymore. The smell cuts through the air and Harry feels like he’s drowning, like he’s back at Privet Drive and the last fourteen years never happened, and it should be ridiculous, to have such bad memories associated with a smell, not to mention one that’s supposed to be pleasant. Harry can feel his stomach churn and no matter how hard he tries, no matter how insignificant it ought to be, any time he casts a quick look at the lined-up pots, all he can see is Petunia Dursley’s kitchen and that horrid flower garden.
Draco was so tense Harry wanted to ask if it was okay, if it was going to hurt, but perhaps the temptation was too much to resist. The trust Draco put in him made something unfurl in his stomach, going deeper and growing hotter with every quiet exhale, and Harry was hopelessly trying to control his breathing as he lifted a shaking hand to gather some of the oil in his hand, going up towards the base of the wings.
“Wait,” Draco gasps. “Stop, fuck, Harry, slow down. If we’re doing this, we’re doing it right,” he rasps against his lips, making Harry groan.
He leaned back, but not before sealing the last blooming lovebite with a soft lick, and looked down at Harry, and intertwined their fingers. “Shall we follow in the footsteps of our English forefathers, then?”
He saw those words painted on walls and people’s doors, heard them hissed in bars and pubs, saw young men sitting at bus stops at night, with split lips and bruised faces—Harry knew what people thought about two men touching each other,
Draco stiffens. Harry could swear the air around them has just turned a bit more stifling as Draco regards him with barely restrained fury. “You know,” he says, a dangerous note lacing his voice. “At first, it was amusing. It even got interesting with time, I’ll admit, to play this fucking game of cat and mouse.” He takes a step with every word, zoning in on Harry who’s rooted to his spot with a racing heart.
They talk about safe, mundane things and Daniel seems to like everything, to be absolutely fine with all the things Harry says without seeming to have no spine; he listens rather than talks, probably not wanting to come off too opinionated, or perhaps actually not being like that at all. The conversation flows like a lazy river rather than a tempestuous mountain stream—it’s not difficult or especially challenging in any way, but rather relaxed in the sleepy kind of way that people feel too guilty to call boring. Just like Draco said—it’s good for him. It’s safe.
Malfoy picks up the shirt and examines it for maybe a second before throwing it back onto Harry’s bed. “I’m not putting it on,” he says in a clipped tone.
“Fuck, you’re so hot,” Harry said quietly and Draco smiled at his fumbling. “Always have been. I don’t have my wand on me,” he added when Draco raised his brow at the very Muggle condom and a packet of lube Harry was holding.
have you done? I hope you know they’re all looking for you, and not to send you to another orgy.” He talks quickly, brow furrowed in concern. “There’s a manhunt and more than a few
“It… has the faintest sparkle, which I’ve never seen form from an Aguamenti,” Draco says, glancing at him in fascination. “And it tastes almost… like rose water.”
It should simply be clinical—they both know what’s happening. A crack in Malfoy’s smooth attitude should mean a point for Harry. But then, he helplessly watches the tousled fringe fall into Malfoy’s eyes, and it subtly grazes the surface of what they’ve been doing so far; as far from objective as it's possible to be. The moment feels like bending over a Pensieve, just a fraction of an inch too close before it sucks you in, sending ripples across the still mirror. Malfoy nearly rips his jacket off, shrugging out of it while he mutters profanities under his breath. He tugs on his shirt buttons, working his way down the fine cotton that looks perfectly opaque and light as silk at the same time.
Draco was acting pissy at work that day so Harry logically knew there was a big chance he’d find him here and the pint suggested his mood was particularly sour as Draco wasn’t really a beer person, or even a mope-at-a-pub person. McLaggen being there was just a frying pan-fire situation, a cherry on top, really, and now, on top of everything, Harry was on his way over.
A crippling familiarity settles heavy onto Harry’s shoulders at the use of his last name. His heart is pounding for reasons too complex to dissect right now as he looks straight into the clear, quicksilver eyes that seemingly disappeared from the face of the Earth right after the post-war trials. Clear of all charges, they said. With Lucius Malfoy serving life in Azkaban and subsequently dying after just three years, his wife and son were rumoured to have left Britain for good, tucked away in some mysterious corner of the world, free of gossip and speculations about their family patriarch’s swift demise. The Ministry didn’t look too much into Lucius’ death and, similarly to many of the deceased Death Eater prisoners before and after him, made a quiet affair of informing the family, scribbling ‘heart attack’ in the
They keep bickering back and forth and talk about pleasant things until lunchtime when they both leave the building and go to grab a bite in unspoken agreement. Draco subtly makes sure Harry’s okay, weaving seemingly innocent questions into their conversation with all his congenital restraint, tries to let him know he’s allowed to have preferences and it does make Harry feel a bit better. He’s not going to tell Draco that he’s the voice of reason, considering his head is already big enough as it is, but he appreciates it nonetheless, to have someone look out for his “Saviour Complex”, as Draco likes to call it, to tell him he’s enough and to stop him from burning out.
Harry’s coming down, and the fog in the corners of his eyes clears enough for him to notice he still has his hand on Draco’s thigh. It feels almost unbearably good, and embarrassing, too, to crave that scrap of skin contact, to crave the feeling of
Draco made a broken sound at the back of his throat and folded himself tightly into Harry’s arms. The wings were gone, inconspicuously retracted back into Draco’s body as soon as they came, and all Harry could feel as he had Draco warm and sated in his arms, was the trails of oil warming Draco’s back.
“I’m— Ah. Spoiled. And I can be cruel if I want to. I’m possessive and vicious and your friends will hate me and it will tear whatever this is apart,” Draco says, slowly shaking his head. “And we will fight, we will always fight, and I will say the cruellest, most uncalled for things just to stab you where it hurts the most— I—”
Deep down, he wants to snap his fingers in front of all their faces and revel in watching astonishment give way to realisation. He wants to swipe the irrelevant papers and poorly-written reports off their cluttered desks, resentful of their negligence, the infuriating lack of vigilance from the ones who so arrogantly call themselves
Harry chuckles; Draco talks so much he usually jumps between topics like a sports anchor commenting on seven different disciplines. “I’ve told you several times, a window can be opened without a wand, too,” he says.
He’s going to show his friends, one day. Just not yet. Harry wants to keep them to himself just a little longer.
“I’m sure you are,” says Draco, with an expression that clearly says otherwise. “But back to our conversation—how is this mindless servitude going for you?”
“Yeah, Draco, why?” Harry asks, abandoning all hope of putting on a t-shirt. Instead, he jumps up on the kitchen counter and watches his… charge-turned-lover-turned-maybe-boyfriend in amusement as Draco squirms.
Harry’s searching fingers stopped right at Draco’s waistband with only the tips of his fingers feeling the warm skin underneath, smoothing over the faint impression of the elastic. “Are you drunk?”
“It’s worth at least a thousand Galleons,” Harry said with a note of awe after he was done with his Diagnostic Spells.
The land in a stumble, tangled in a mess of lips and limbs—Draco’s already pulling on Harry’s shirt, bending down to kiss up his ribcage and circle his nipples with rapid flicks of his tongue. “I want you,” he gasps and pushes Harry onto the huge bed. “Fuck, I want you.”
Draco exhales. Slowly, deliberately. His heady smell permeates the air, stronger than any detergent could ever be. And then he asks: “Did you listen?”
The fact that they don’t talk about that night doesn’t mean either of them forgot about what happened.
“You smoke?” He asked abruptly, leaning on the marble railing, close enough to brush his shoulder against Potter’s.
Draco pressed Harry’s leg flush against his body and held it there, slotting them even closer, and fucked him even harder, his stomach contracting on every grunt. Harry didn’t even register his own whimpers anymore, just let his mind float as his eyes rolled back in ecstasy.
They get off the ride and as soon as they’re out of eyeshot, Draco grabs Harry’s elbow and drags him off to the side.
He meanders between passersby with the graceful dexterity of someone who knows how to blend into a crowd while still managing to turn heads when he passes. There is not a single crease in the bespoke, black Gucci suit he’s wearing and his silver tie pin gleams with a tiny, discreet emerald—just simple enough to exude good taste without an arriviste-like air of entitlement. He wears the ensemble like a second skin, moving with a lazy, efficient agility that people are either lucky to be born with or master by suffering through years of self-inflicted social ordeals amongst crows fighting for every measly scrap of prestige they can find. In his case, it’s definitely the former, and it is as clear as the enticing glint of light reflecting off his sunglasses.
Potter hasn’t really lost who he is at his very core—an insufferable prat with a saviour complex, annoyingly kind to children and the elderly, always delighted to sacrifice himself for those who require said saving. What is new, though, is the lack of that teenage awkwardness that had once leveled the field, and given Draco an impression of some kind of an upper hand in their day-to-day interactions. Draco has, obviously, always been a roguishly handsome, debonair young man and the years that passed had only further refined him into the sophisticated specimen he is now. Potter, however, has always been a tad lanky and somewhat clumsy and Draco finds his staggering transformation awfully unnerving. Potter’s demeanor used to make Draco want to taunt him, get a rise out of him, and nowadays, perhaps, he could be charmed enough to take a man like that for a spin, if only to teach him a thing or two, and shamelessly reap the benefits of his particular brand of bedroom education.
“I wouldn’t spare myself a second glance anyway, looking like the caveman you’ve turned me into,” Draco sniffs, without any real malice in his voice.
He rolls his hips back, making sure Draco can breathe, and pushes back in, setting a slow, dragging pace, moaning shamelessly as he starts to fuck Draco’s mouth. By unspoken agreement, he pulls out whenever Draco’s fingers dig into his thigh a little harder and lets him take a pause—he swallows a few laboured breaths, a string of saliva stretching between his lower lip and the tip of Harry’s cock.
Harry deflates, seeing the tiny tremble to her lower lip. Guilt floods his chest when Harry realises he’s worried his friends so much, too preoccupied with his own despair. “I…”
! We have less than ten seconds!” he says urgently and doesn’t even bother to hide his fear anymore.
Harry makes use of the privacy and puts up some wards for good measure—Muggle-Repelling Charms, Glamours on the windows, an overall standard set to make sure no-one will barge in on them using magic if it comes to that, seeing as they might spend a while there. He doesn’t tell Draco he’s not exactly a laundry expert himself, and it’s ridiculous such a mundane thing could become their demise. No matter if it’s laundry or lunch, they’re still on the run, there are still two more weeks until the trial, and the danger of discovery remains unchanged.
his purpose, he had become lost in it. Harry had almost missed it, had almost let himself fall into a life of doing what everyone else thought he should, rather than what he believed in. With the sweat of the sex they’ve just had still drying on his temples, Harry realises that Draco was right about more things than he cares to admit. And that realisation is capable of shifting his whole life.
Draco stares ahead with the empty gaze of a starving man and slowly shakes his head. “Merlin, I would gladly bury my face there and not come up for a week,” he says gravely, christening the statement with a gulp of wine.
“I’m so sorry, Harry, I can’t believe they scheduled the cake tasting and forgot to tell us!” She calls from the bedroom, accompanied by some loud thuds and a few muffled curses. Harry makes a face at Ron—they’ve only heard Hermione swear a handful of times over the course of their nearly fifteen-year-old friendship and teased her mercilessly every once in a blue moon they had the chance to hear it. The rarity of such an occurrence only adds to the legend: Hermione Granger is not to be crossed.
The Head Auror finally lifts his gaze from the file he’s holding and freezes as he notices the stranger. Rheumy eyes swipe over the room so quickly it could almost be missed, a paranoid little habit that always betrayed them quicker than the offensive scarlet of their uniforms.
He twirls the wand between long fingers, swings it like he doesn’t care and a cascade of ethereal purple hydrangeas spills from the tip, quickly dissipating into the air with another, more deliberate swing. “It’s funny,” he says.
Ron pipes up at that, clearly eager to tell Harry the story. Harry smiles weakly, welcoming the distraction. “So get this, Zabini came to me, saying he had heard something and that he promised he’d come to me if he heard any aliases. He picked up on some conversation, they said: ‘
Potter, who’s currently trying to get even closer, nosing lightly at the nape of Draco’s neck and smiling at the light shiver it elicits.
When he finally gets his windpipe working again, Draco takes another swig for good measure and examines the glass.
Draco straightened his back and towered over Harry like a mighty seraph, his wings string-taut, sharply glistening in the scant light, his toned body tense and nearly luminescent, as if some inner power came to the surface when he let go of his control. Harry could see a slight golden tint setting his irises aglow and it suddenly dawned on him, Draco’s raw power dormant in his blood, and the significance of being able to witness it.
to collect. Somewhere at the edges of his astonishment, he can feel anger slowly welling up to the surface, boiling and ugly right under his skin. “And what? Things got too dangerous for you so you’re selling your buddies out? Secured yourself a nice little deposit first, so now you can break the inconvenient ties and cut yourself a nice deal on the side?”
Harry lowers himself to the floor and Draco lets out a hoarse shout as he feels Harry’s tongue at the base of his cock, licking alongside his thrusts, circling Teddy’s hole.
“Harry,” Draco said, sounding like he was begging—for an answer, for something to anchor them both, for Harry to stop and keep pushing at the same time.
“If you’re going to rub something in my face, I’d much rather be it your gigantic cock,” he deadpans and throws the offending garment to the side.
“All right,” Harry says. “So I’ll start with: why did you leave? Because the fucking excuses in that
The smell of flowers is even stronger inside and Harry can’t stop himself from sneezing into his elbow, luckily managing to stifle the sound. The studio extends deeper and Harry realises it also includes a courtyard in the middle of the building. It’s adapted to act as an orangery with a dome-like glass roof that allows more sunlight inside—it spills into the space through the dusty glass slates and bathes all the vegetation in a mysterious, greenish glow. The air is cool and moist, possibly to best preserve all the cut flowers and Harry can hear the murmur of flowing water echoing around the studio.
’ and that his face showed as little distress as possible. At the time, Harry had hysterically thought he was now forever doomed to be turned off by knocking sounds. The person behind the door turned out to be Draco which was actually a lucky outcome considering what Ginny was capable of, how fragile Ron’s sensibilities tended to be, or how much more startling Hermione’s frantic knocking was. Ever since that dreaded day, Harry has introduced an ‘always knock’ policy to be one hundred percent sure all his bases—and his body—are covered.
A vision of Draco Malfoy’s face right after being called ‘lad’ pops into his head and Harry bites his tongue to stop himself from snorting and making things even worse. “I can call you a cab,” he tries, feeling a little bad, but not bad enough to offer to walk her down the stairs.
Hermione yelps when Ron grabs her by the waist and tugs her down into his lap. She laughs as he holds her in a vice-like grip and buries his face in her jumper. “We’re almost done with all the—Ron!” She tries to wiggle out, helpless against her husband-to-be and his alcohol-induced burst of emotion. “With all the flowers,” Hermione says flatly, folding her lips into a thin line as if half of the world’s vegetation existed just to spite her. “I’m starting to hate all of them, honestly,” she adds with a sigh.
The fights they used to have, the ones about mundane, everyday things such as who gets to shower first, or what they’re having for breakfast, with both of them saying things they haven’t meant for longer than Harry suspects, now seem like a relic of the past. Now, they take their showers together, and most quarrels somehow evolve into slow, sensual fucks on top of the bedsheets, with Draco riding him in all his flushed glory, drenched in a thin film of sweat.
“Oh, Ronald, get over yourself,” Hermione says with a laugh, not even bothering to move. Harry smiles at Ginny who gives him his beer that got passed around the circle to reach him, courtesy of Draco.
“Shit,” Kingsley curses and a few Aurors nearby turn to look with wide eyes. “Weasley, go join the rest—I want them all found, cuffed and lined up in under an hour. Don’t evacuate, but watch out for civilians. Take Mulberry with you,” he barks. A nearby Auror straightens into awareness—both him and Ron nod a quick
Hermione covers her face with a hand to stifle a soft giggle. “Well,” she smiles mischievously, “it’s just because all of us do it on the regular,” she shrugs. “Except for Harry,” she adds quickly. The group erupts in laughter and Harry flips them two fingers.
Harry dreams about dragons and the sounds of gunshots, feeling strange, cold knots curl around his stomach, but all of that dissolves into an afterthought when he wakes up to a warm, soft body wrapped tightly around him. It’s not that he expected Draco to bolt, or to move to his own bed somewhere during the night, but Harry’s foolish heart still flutters helplessly as he cracks one eye open and sees silvery-white tufts of hair spilling onto the pillow.
Harry wants to rip his hair out. Opposite him, Draco looks like he just found out he’s Minister of Magic. “And you didn’t think of setting me up with one of them?!” Harry shrieks, abandoning all hope of his voice ever dropping.
He smirks. “I’ll start at the end then.” Another tired breath. Harry doesn’t know if it’s the pale moonlight, or the black clothes, or something else entirely, but it suddenly strikes him how exhausted Malfoy looks. There are shadows under his eyes, a slight hunch to his shoulders, and something not quite
Draco slowed down at that, studying his face in soft astonishment. “Why— Why didn’t you say anything?”
They part, not yet ready to let go, standing there with their foreheads pressed together and Harry steals two more sweet, soft kisses, feeling Draco smile against his lips.
“I know, I know,” Draco says, walking over and sitting cross-legged on his bed. He’s wearing the usual shirt he sleeps in and a pair of soft, grey joggers he’s taken a particular liking to, to Harry’s utter dismay—his whole adult life, he had no idea that a person could be disturbed by a piece of clothing but has since adjusted his views. Harry tries not to look, knowing full well Draco usually goes commando like it’s a social norm, and even has the cheek to justify it with made-up-sounding pure-blood customs and definitely made-up medical facts. Harry never asked, Draco just says these things.
“Have you ever heard a Howler?” Harry asks testily and Draco inclines his head. “That’s it, like, in terms of pitch.”
“It’s never quick with you,” Draco says testily, and bites down on Harry’s lower lip, just because he can. He tastes like the treacle tart he had for lunch and Draco might just buy some later this week, if only to deceive his taste buds it’s still Potter lingering on his tongue.
Harry wonders if the Family has anything to do with the Wizengamot’s relentlessness, wonders how many judges could be corrupt enough to vote this through. Two months is such an inconvenient amount of time for the DMLE, there must be more leaks in their department than Harry’s ready to accept. Two months is not nearly enough time to catch all the perpetrators. It’s going to be a nightmare of a task and Robards informs Harry that there will be no task force this time.
“You’re insane,” Draco pants, leaving a trail of wet, suckling kisses along the tendon on his neck, all the way down to his collarbone. “You’re a maniac and you will be the absolute death of me, you’re—”
His assistant walks in with an unamused look, eyeing him over her brown-framed glasses—the only person who doesn’t knock and isn’t planning to start anytime soon. Claire is a strict lady in her late sixties, the self-proclaimed ‘Backbone of This Entire Bloody Department’, and the last bastion before reaching Harry’s office. The woman is a legend amongst the Aurors—most fear her, some hate her, all know her. Initially, Harry was mildly surprised to see someone her age at the workplace but has since quickly learned that not only does the woman refuse to retire, she is a far cry from a decrepit old lady one might perceive her to be. Possessing the natural, effortless air of authority of Minerva McGonagall and the resilience and stubbornness of Molly Weasley, Claire has become a true godsend in Harry’s job, striking fear in the hearts of weak men, pushy solicitors and unscheduled reporters. Harry appreciates that she never shies away from speaking her mind no matter how harsh and brutal the truth is and, what’s more, she will speak it if it’s the last thing she does. He likes to tease her about the fondness Harry’s sure she’s harbouring for him underneath her stone-cold facade, even if it usually results in threats to ‘hex him out of it like someone finally ought to do’.
He admires his handiwork for a while and Harry thinks about how Draco’s right. He doesn’t know what the rules are either—all he knows is that his skin is tingling, his heart is pounding and he’s about to pass out.
Draco’s Adam's apple bobs visibly at the column of his throat; Harry follows the movement with his eyes and he feels Draco’s hand slip from his as his pulse quickens. When he finally speaks, his voice is shaky. “I would be just a little more patient.”
“And you’re wearing that cologne again,” Harry sighs, dragging his nose across Draco’s overheated skin.
It’s become a virtue to have such a lot of experience spying on Draco Malfoy in the Invisibility Cloak, Harry thinks bitterly as he secures the fastening and makes sure he’s fully covered. He exits the alley and focuses on the spell, easily finding the connection—the voices are hard to discern, meaning they’re either underground or surrounded by Muggle appliances intercepting the magic. Harry thinks back to the café he spotted at the other side of the square earlier—it’s a perfect spot: private, not too crowded at this time of day, and close enough to slip away unnoticed.
There was something profoundly melancholic in the furrow of Draco’s brow. “Not nearly enough to excuse this.”
“It’s— It was specifically brewed to attract women,” Harry said quietly and moved his hand an inch, like he was reaching out, but decided against it, somewhat forcefully putting it back in his lap.
As a bonus, Draco had once learned (courtesy of Pansy and Blaise) the muscles at the juts of a man's hips are called ‘cum gutters’ but has never had the chance to observe them be
is what that means, he would be gladly called a dog for the rest of his life. Draco fucks into him in fast, unyielding thrusts and Harry cannot, for the life of him, take his eyes off their reflection. Normally, he would let his eyes fall closed and ride out the mounting waves of burning pleasure, but not tonight—not when he can clearly see Draco burying his nose behind Harry’s ear and sucking bruises into his neck, not when he’s fixated on the way Draco’s muscles shift under his skin, not when Harry sees his hole stretched around Draco’s cock, pumping in and out, as come and lube drip down onto the sheets.
Harry didn’t remember how it once felt to be able to save someone. He was completely and utterly powerless and he wanted to scream.
Nobody on Level Two turns to look when the lift’s bell chimes and the stranger emerges, immediately drowning in a sea of crimson uniforms. His nose scrunches in distaste as he bumps shoulders with a few Aurors, surrounded by the smell of cheap coffee and the dusty, papery scent of every old office he’s ever been in. Looking straight ahead, he slowly advances down the hall, passing a row of doors to the smaller offices, each step measured and deliberate, like a cat circling its prey. His eyes jump to one of the doors and the plaque beside it—for just a fraction of a second, the only crack in his stone-cold resolve he will allow before reaching the door to the bullpen at the end of the hall.
It strikes Harry how close they are. Almost too close to breathe, definitely too close to excuse it in any way. He can see Draco’s eyelashes, how they turn a pale blond halfway down their length, how the nearly translucent tips curve upward and glimmer infinitesimally, so fleeting and easy to miss. The scent of citrus and spice is suddenly strong and heady and he wonders if it’s because of that one open button, if it’s cologne or Draco’s skin and whether it’s even stronger in the hollows of his collarbones. There are so many things to learn about him still, Harry thinks, and it makes his head spin, and then his heart stutters as he realises Draco is watching him too, gingerly, like a butterfly locked in a glass case, too beautiful and fragile to touch. So Draco just watches, maybe he has been watching for longer than Harry thinks. And just like a dead butterfly, he feels pierced through and pinned down to his spot.
Zabini is quiet for a few seconds, searching Malfoy’s face. “Draco. What happened? Are you alright?”
The loud beep of the washing machine starts them both and they jump apart, hot and flustered. Harry steals another kiss and earns himself an annoyed glance when he cups Draco through his trousers and then leaves him there to go get out their laundry. Harry’s clueless as to what has got into him—whether along with an orgasm, Draco’s has sucked his brains out as well. He wonders whether the giddy, relaxed feeling stirring in his gut has anything to do with the endorphin high or rather with the way Draco’s trying to hide a smile. All he knows is that the
Harry exhales. One, two times, the images of him and Draco yesterday morning still fresh in his mind. “Yeah,” Harry whispers and swallows thickly. “Yeah, we did.”
sent straight into the ground at his opponent’s feet, sending the man flying backwards with white-hot pellets of vitrified sand following in his wake. Harry distractedly thinks he should focus on his opponent but keeps stealing glances at Malfoy, making sure they both have the upper hand. And Draco Malfoy duelling is something to behold. He moves with the speed and agility of a seasoned rogue, barely having to move as he dodges his adversary’s attacks—not only with his wand, but also with his body. Harry wonders where he picked up those techniques, casting like it’s breathing, moving like it’s dancing. The red-haired woman curses as Malfoy dodges her lazy
He’s going faster and faster as Draco’s breathing speeds up and his delightful, keening mewls ring in Harry’s ears like the filthiest litany. The hot water dribbles down Harry’s back and the sides of his neck, every scorching lash making him gasp and drive his hips forward to meet the steady pump of his fist. Draco must be getting closer, and so is Harry, and he immediately knows they will come at the same time, and squeezes his cock harder, all slippery with precome and the remnants of water. He wishes he could lay down comfortably, maybe add a slickened finger to the mix to feel his orgasm build hot and low, twist his insides and curl his toes in complete bliss, but this will have to do, and with Draco’s incoherent groans it’s still everything he could wish for. Harry hisses as the head of his cock catches on the calluses on his fingers on every downstroke; his vision blurs and it’s either the water or the sloppy, wet sounds he can hear as if Draco were right next to him, and then he hears something else. A broken whisper, dripping with urgent pleasure:
It’s not that Harry was a creep (he dearly hoped he was not). And it wasn’t wings in general, he supposed. But seeing Draco, pale and perfect, and his wide, terrified eyes at the two additional limbs springing out his back had awakened something in Harry himself. Draco had basically sprinted to Harry’s Floo, hastily thanked him for the drinks, and bolted before Harry had a chance to take a proper look or the wings to fully emerge.
Harry hoists Draco up by the hips, onto his knees, and lets himself pause to admire the view. Draco, shamelessly spread out, wet and panting, his hole clenching and unclenching, cock bobbing hard and heavy under his belly. Harry cups it in his palm, bends it backwards, and licks a wide stripe from the very tip, up its underside and his balls, paying extra attention to that lovely plump spot just under his hole, wrapping his lips around it and sucking on the sensitive skin with a satisfied purr.
As soon as the deafening gunshot echoes off the walls, a stream of vicious, orange light plummets towards him and hits Draco in the ribs. Harry doesn’t know where to look—in the corner of his eye, he sees Robards falling to the ground in silent shock, grasping at the bullet wound in his abdomen and trying to stop the blood gushing from the hole. When he turns to look at Draco, he’s lying in a slowly expanding pool of blood, moving raggedly to keep himself upright.
Draco watched the parchment, as dry as the words it carried, quickly catch fire, and rode out the shiver zinging across his back. Memories from one particular night, two years ago, assaulted him with renewed intensity.
Malfoy recoils from the table like it burned him, looking at him with that years-old fury Harry remembers so well. He takes his wand out and puts it on the table and Harry is momentarily transported ten years back as he takes a proper look at it. Without a word, he slips it into his holster right next to his own and perhaps there’s something symbolic there but Harry knows better than to ponder over it or pay any attention to that cool twirl of magic he just knew he’d feel. Instead, he sends a Patronus to the bullpen—he needs to talk to Kingsley and Robards right away and he’s done babysitting Malfoy for the time being.
“Back at your office,” Harry says. “I wanted to ask but it felt— I don’t know,” he breathes. “So I didn’t ask. But I’m asking now.”
“Isn’t this enough?” Malfoy asks and there’s a desperate note to his voice that makes Harry pause. “Just take it and let me go. You’ll find my file there, too, thought I’d make it easy for you,” he says with a little eye roll. “Consider it a bonus. Should be enough for that deal you mentioned, I have no intention of rotting in Azkaban.”
Draco stirs awake and for three short seconds, Harry gets a glimpse of a creaseless, dreamy version of him before he schools his features into the usual guarded look. Slowly, like a trapped animal, he tries to slip out of bed without seeming like he finds it hard, and Harry pulls him in with a gentle tug.
Teddy doesn’t answer but the sounds he’s making say everything Harry needs to hear. He loves it, he’s loved it from the first time they’ve done it and Draco and Harry were helpless against that mutual need, to take care of him, to reassure him of their love and to tell him exactly what a good boy he is.
They were neither strangers nor friends these days, and it shouldn’t have felt so easy because Draco was a difficult fucking person, with all his quirks and being so hard to read. Their departments were on the same floor and they sort of absently fell into a strange acquaintanceship where they never questioned it and neither said they should stop. Harry watched him carefully—always had, when he thought about it—and Draco watched him right back but that scrutiny made Harry feel like he was a museum exhibit or a very expensive vase gathering dust someplace resembling Malfoy Manor. He supposed he could understand it on some level, the way Draco shook his head and muttered about reputation whenever an intern turned into a spluttering mess when they passed the front desk on their way back from lunch, or when the Prophet managed to snap a picture of Harry with a faceless fling he would forget about as soon as he snuck out the door the next morning. He wanted Draco’s reservation to be a
!” Harry whisper-shouts at her, low-key proud he’s not losing his temper while holding an infant. “I’m going to get punched in the jaw, aren’t I?” He asks miserably.
The room was silent—even the carved grandfather clock was already sealed away—and all Draco could hear was his own blood, rushing along his body in all the directions leading to reckless decisions. With his stomach somewhere around his throat, he reached out and tucked a single silky, dark lock behind Harry’s ear, letting his hand fall back right next to Harry’s bent leg.
Thoughts of Draco and his newly discovered creature inheritance tormented Harry until the end of the day and reached a culminating point when Draco’s owl pecked at his window later in the evening. Harry opened the laconic note in Draco’s familiar, pointy cursive and frowned.
“It’s not like we’re going to have Firewhisky and bet on Hippogriff fights, right Freddie?” Harry coos, kissing the top of the little boy’s nose. He lets out a tiny laugh and much more drool than a baby should be able to produce. “Bloody hell, and I thought it was going to be a peaceful evening.”
Harry met him halfway as he propped himself up on one elbow and dragged Draco down by the neck to claim his mouth. “Inside me,” he growled, “now.”
Draco isn’t fully listening to his rambling, still apologising, still trying to play it down. But his hands are shaking and his breath hitches on every other word and Harry needs him to be quiet just for a minute, he needs to explain, he—
Seconds later, they’re there. Harry’s whole world narrows down to the four loud cracks he counts, to the long, pointy shadows moving quickly across the dunes. They’re about fifty feet away and the quaggy, wet sand slows them down, enough for Harry to gather his wits. The mobsters slowly emerge from the darkness and he knows they’ll see them as soon as Harry gets a clear shot. As if on cue, the goons emerge into the moonlit clearing and both Harry and Malfoy cast in tandem, a jet of red light shooting from Harry’s wand, and a sheaf of angry, purple sparks firing from Malfoy’s. Harry doesn’t know the spell but one of the mobsters gets hit square in the chest and immediately collapses onto the ground.
Harry snorts at that, causing Freddie to squeal in delight. Feeling Draco’s eyes on him, he kisses the top of his nephew’s head.
The Muggles called it an atomic bomb. On the telly they said it annihilates everything right at the second it touches the ground. A blinding flash of white light and then it’s over, everything gone. Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. Like a million Avada Kedavras, a Fiendfyre swallowing everything for miles, leaving char and waste in its wake. The wizards didn’t know any spells like that—it sounded like pure death, carefully distilled and magnified to be capable of wiping out entire cities. Harry wondered what twisted minds could come up with such a terrifying weapon, what cruelty and animalistic fear could have driven them to devise something so horrendous, so powerful, that people all over the world lived in constant fear of that power being unleashed.
the man’s face but, at the same time, cannot picture it in his mind. Draco wonders if the rest of his physique is as enticing.
The only shred of hope Harry could muster was that it could still miss them somehow. That they were out of range, a speck of dust in the grand scheme of things, not important enough to be bothered with. The siren kept wailing, people kept running back and forth, some crying, some tense and determined to save their loved ones, packing their families and what possessions they managed to grab into their cars and driving away.
“I suppose it does have a certain panache, doesn’t it?” Malfoy says with a chuckle. “Also, my hair looks
Their predator-prey relationship in which both thought they were the former, has turned into a mutual ceasefire; with time, it has started to resemble a slow, coiled prowl on the edge of each other’s understanding. Harry’s not sure if he wants to be understood if it would mean exposure, just like he’s not sure he wants to understand Malfoy if it would mean being wrong.
feels like a profanity, it ignites a roaring fire in his belly, spurring him on to hide and protect it—not hide it from the world, to keep it safe and close to his confused heart.
Careful not to wake Draco up, Harry shifts a little and winces—a certain place on his body is slightly sorer now than it was last night and although he didn’t expect to feel it in the morning, Harry bites his lip, thinking about what happened. He looks down at Draco’s peaceful face and something warm and tranquil floods Harry’s chest at the sight—Draco’s slightly parted lips, a trail of purplish lovebites going down his neck and disappearing under the covers, his pale eyelashes gleaming in the sunlight like the lightest of feathers. Harry feels him breathe as Draco lies flush against him, feels his slender fingers lightly resting against his ribs. Burying his nose in those silvery locks, Harry inhales the familiar, calming scent of lemon and sage and smiles into Draco’s hair, thinking how unbelievably lucky he is.
Seamus looks like he’s trying not to laugh. “Harry, focus, mate,” he snaps his fingers in the air. “Top or bottom?”
It could still happen—his position has some obvious perks, including, but not limited to, first dibs on the hottest, most difficult cases, and Harry has always had a hard time refusing a good challenge. It’s definitely worth all those meetings and Claire’s authoritarian style of running the office because that’s when he has the chance to get into the fray, to actually help people and feel the adrenaline rush he always gets when fighting the good fight.
, as per the man himself) on a short leash—the young men and women always seem fidgety, jumping at the tiniest sound that’s out of place, and a little pale, although that one could be attributed to the sheer amount of chemical vapour in the room and Harry chooses to believe that. It’s not like Draco’s undisputed reign of the Forensics wing could make Ministry interns shiver in terror, could it?
As in, the flowers aunt Petunia had in her garden. The garden Harry was forced to work in on long, summer days from the age of eight to ten, until Dudley rode his brand new mountain bike into said garden and ploughed down all of Petunia’s bloody flowers, turning them into a violet-green mulch. The garden that Harry was still punished for destroying.
Harry’s come trickles down Teddy’s balls as he turns to face Draco and he’s immediately pulled into a deep kiss. He tangles his fingers in Draco’s tousled hair, holds on to him and lets Draco devour his mouth as he lines himself up and guides him down onto his cock.
. I release you,” he rasps in a thick accent and Malfoy moves behind him, letting out a slow exhale.
Draco is a never ending source of strange, hidden beauty, with his quirks, and looks, and words. Watching him feels different now, and Harry realises it’s not so much his own perceptiveness but rather the fact Draco
“What are you talking about? You chose a Draco look alike?” Harry wishes his idiot mouth would stop talking, wishes he never let himself be sucked into this conversation.
Apart from that, they mostly make out in Draco’s hospital bed, after Harry makes sure he won’t hurt him or open his wound. They have lunch that Harry’s brought from a little café down the street, and then the Healer lady from before tells him she’s been lenient enough and Harry needs to leave.
Harry slaps his free hand over his mouth and moans; his legs turn numb as he comes and comes all over his fist and the shower wall.
Ron stays with him for the rest of the day, with most of the Family caught and in custody, and their most prominent members being arrested as they speak. And speak they do, after over an hour of just sitting there and processing all that has happened.
“Take me home,” Potter said bluntly, two hours later, causing Draco to miss the hook he was hanging his lab coat on.
They take the short walk instead of Apparating and Harry welcomes the crisp November air biting at his face and fingers, watching Draco’s hair gleam in the faint street lights. He uses the time to sober up and regain a little of the vigilance he feels has leaked out between one shot and the next, and discreetly watches Draco walking beside him, unusually quiet and deep in thought.
Draco stirs, letting out a small grumble and Harry tries not to laugh too loud—Draco hates getting up early on weekends. Nevertheless, there’s now one silver eye peeking at him from behind a golden curtain and Harry feels a soft kiss being planted on his sternum.
They part when the descent begins, careful not to draw any attention. It feels too prolonged to ignore it—that short moment when lips part but still stick to each other, that last, warm sigh as Draco’s taste lingers on Harry’s tongue and dissipates, leaving him hungrier then he was before. Draco’s eyes are like the onyxes on his cigarette case and his thumb still brushes Harry’s cheekbone until the cheerful buzz of the fair reaches them once again and the bubble bursts.
Draco rubs at his eyes, pained. “Salazar, you Gryffindors are a terrible influence, do you know that?”
Harry doesn’t take his eyes off him, not for a second. He’s made this mistake before, he wasn’t paying attention, he was looking but he didn’t
?” Harry raises a questioning brow. “Don’t tell me you don’t have someone nice and proper in the store for me. I know how much you like to be right.”
Draco watches him for maybe a second more and then he’s moving, positioning himself on top of Harry and looking him straight in the eyes. “You're going to kill me,” he whispers and gasps softly as the tip of his cock catches on Harry’s abused hole. He casts that lubricating spell again—Harry finds it incredibly hot that he can somehow do it wandless—and covers his cock in the pleasant-smelling gel, hissing as he touches himself. There’s a primal hunger in the way he looks at Harry as he lines himself up and buries his cock inside him in one smooth push.
In the next second, Draco is pulling Harry into a deep, hard kiss, hands gripping at his clothes, their bodies flush together. Harry kisses him back with everything he has, and it’s over way too soon but they both know it’s not about the slide of their lips or any kind of pleasure. It’s a statement, as clear as day, it’s
“You’re staring,” Draco murmurs with a small smile, crumpling up his napkin and flicking it into the nearest litter bin.
Malfoy is slightly less relaxed than he was five minutes ago—his shoulders are tense as he stares at Harry, absently tapping his finger on the file. He flattens his hand on top of it and slides it across the table. “Here. I’ve been collecting this for… longer than I’d care to admit, actually.”
Harry feels his face burn, an idea already forming in his head. Like a missing piece of a puzzle, it falls perfectly into place—Malfoy’s lecherous confidence, his suave, upper-class charms, and, as much as Harry would like to pretend it’s not the case, his infuriatingly good looks. He clears his throat. “You mean— That is. Er,” he stammers, hoping he won’t choke on his beer. The tables have turned and Malfoy seems to revel in seeing him squirm, and Harry welcomes the small sting of anger in his chest, easy and familiar to hold against him. It’s like getting a new job just for the thrill of something new—he’d rather stay in his lane for now, skeptical and a little mistrustful, than dive headfirst into the notion that Malfoy might see right through him.
Slowly, he reached out to run his hand down the edge of the left wing, from the joint to the tips of the primaries, and the wing recoiled with a flutter as Draco let out a choked sound.
Nobody questions his behaviour, though, as he slowly walks up to the reception desk where a bored witch sifts through the latest edition of
,” he continues, clearly biting down a smirk. “Just like it probably says in your little files, my mother and I left Britain and went to France.”
“I… wish I had an answer for you,” Harry says, staring down the neck of his bottle. “We wait. I’ll make contact tomorrow, see if it’s safe for us to come back,” he says, wondering what Ron, Kingsley, and Robards might be up to. Wondering if they caught all the mobsters, if they managed to get some answers that will prove Harry did the right thing. Wondering if Malfoy was telling the truth all along.
. It’s just like with fancy cars or those Muggle pills and medicines that don’t do anything. People like to feel safe,” he said gently, gazing at Draco with all the conviction he could muster. “Besides, how many weapons can Muggles have? We can defend ourselves,” Harry added, not entirely convinced of that himself.
Draco’s breath sped up and up until he was coming all over Harry’s fist, writhing in his grip, and Harry thought he had never seen anything more beautiful or raw, and he momentarily regretted they were doing this in a bathroom instead of a proper bed with sheets and a space to gather Draco into his arms. He wasn’t sure if it was that thought that finally brought him over the edge but Harry came with a muffled shout, filling up the condom and gripping Draco’s hips tight enough to bruise.
the delicious stretch and burn of Draco’s cock inside him. It hurts only for the first few seconds, the initial discomfort quickly dissipating.
Draco adjusts his grip on Potter’s already bruising hips, shifts underneath his weight, and slams up into him with all the strength he can muster, impaling him deeper in one swift move.
Like so many times before, Harry wonders how this could happen. He tries to analyse the past seven weeks, to connect the dots of their way to each other as if it were a messy treasure hunt with its grand prize now peaceful and safe in Harry’s arms. As he traces his favourite mole on Draco’s hip, Harry realises he doesn’t need to look for a reason anymore—it’s been in front of him all this time, and it wasn’t so much a hunt—it’s been a toilsome labour of stripping down the walls of a fortress to get to the treasury deep within. A sinking feeling of being completely and utterly doomed tightens its fist around Harry’s stomach and Harry tightens his arms around Draco. The reason is so obvious, he almost chokes with the weight of it.
If someone asked how Draco let it go so far he’s in this situation, he’d probably sign off his Mungo’s paperwork himself.
close one, they were a hair’s breadth from being discovered and some insane, repressed part of Draco’s brain finds that extremely, unbearably hot—that they never stopped what they were doing, that they are both still hard, and that Potter’s looking at him like he wants to
“Fuck me,” Harry whispers. “Come on, Draco, I know you want it,” he begs sweetly, grinding against Draco, each thrust crumbling his defences more and more, until Draco starts to respond, reluctantly meeting Potter’s hips with his own.
They rode out the aftershocks, fully tangled in the other’s arms, and when Draco’s limp cock finally slid out, he gently helped Harry take his legs off the metal bearings and get out of the chair. As soon as they stood on solid ground, Harry staggered a little, and Draco wrapped an arm around his waist—he could imagine the strain in his thighs from being in that position for so long. He cradled Harry’s face in his hand and Apparated them straight to his bedroom.
Compartmentalising things into numerical systems has always helped Draco get around and organise his thoughts into some semblance of order. It should have been a rather last-resort coping technique but one tends to abandon one’s standards when one ends up with an insane sack of flesh and bones as a housemate in their teenage years.
thing, that it’s not only Draco’s nature but a direct effect of their friendship they both worked so hard to build.
Harry grabs the front of his shirt and slams him against the wall. “Listen,” he barks, but Draco cuts him off.
“Is that supposed to make me feel special?” Harry asks, tilting his head. “There’s no-one else here, Malfoy,” he gestures around the room, knowing full well the chances of Malfoy believing him have just dropped to zero.
“Oh! And a nice arse! Everyone likes a nice arse, right?” Ginny wiggles her eyebrows at him. “Calves? Uhh, feet? You into feet, Harry? I don’t think you are, but—”
Harry can’t make out the man’s croaky response but sees him take off his hat and smile at the girl. And then, Harry’s stomach sinks.
“Of course, Mr Malfoy, I’m on it!” The boy chokes out and nearly runs to the station to clean up the mess.
Robards is quiet. Seconds pass as if they were minutes, and the initial suspicion lightly tugging on Harry’s gut now turns more insistent, turning up the heat along his spine as he tries not to make any assumptions that would go into the ‘doom’ category. Not yet. Taking advantage of the fact his boss’ back is turned, Harry slowly, quietly moves to a better vantage point.
all along. Draco shares the sentiment, judging by the groan he lets out in response—the kiss is now a slow, deliberate slide of tongues, Draco’s fingers ghosting over Harry’s clothed ribs and tangling in his hair. At one point, Draco carefully takes his glasses off and puts them on the coffee table. The slight change of angle makes them both gasp and as Draco stretches to reach the table, Harry sees the tented front of his trousers, sees the outline of Draco’s cock through the fabric and suddenly, he becomes aware of his own arousal and the low, bubbling heat building up at the base of his spine.
He spends almost all day there, not really thinking about why the Healers are allowing this—it could be his name alone, as much as he’d usually hate to admit it; it could be Hermione or Ron secretly doing him a favour, talking to some old friends; or the Healers themselves, glad there’s at least one person in the entire wing who is capable of shutting Draco up. They talk about everything that happened, and Harry tells him about Robards, his wife, and how they thought it was Narcissa—Draco’s visibly relieved at that, although he turns a little pensive after Harry recounts the events. They avoid the topic of the upcoming trial—Hermione said the Wizengamot, now free of any corrupt judges, after a thorough cleansing conducted by Kingsley, has moved the date of Draco’s testimony so he can fully recover.
Potter lifted his hands in a placating gesture. “As you wish. I’ll be watching you leave,” he added with a smirk.
“Yeah, in a second,” Harry replied, stretching his arms and legs. Draco chuckled and walked out of the room.
Draco’s brows rise up. “And you’re here alone? You could get kidnapped, little girl,” he says conversationally, leaning forward and propping up his elbows on his knees.
Draco’s grip on the headboard is so tight his arms are shaking, and he lets out a guttural moan as Harry slowly enters him, inch by eviscerating inch, his cooling sweat dripping onto Draco’s back. By the time he’s inside him up to the hilt, Draco’s panting so hard, his breaths are coming out as choked gulps and Harry holds him tight in his arms, biting into the meat of his shoulder. Draco is taut like a metal rod, so tight around him Harry’s eyes roll back, and he groans, patiently waiting for him to adjust to the pressure.
Draco’s gaze lingers for a few more seconds before he picks up the book. Harry’s relieved he can just take a few minutes to unwind and Draco never pushes or picks his brain. A change of topic is sort of an unspoken plea of
“How does it feel?” Draco asks as soon as they’re in the room, after a walk that felt like going to the gallows.
The ring Draco gave him right before the fire hit their house. He looked down at the inconspicuous gold band and felt nausea roll in his stomach. Harry thought about Draco’s long walks after the argument they had. His quiet demeanour in the days that followed. He wondered what it took for Draco to arrange such a specific Portkey.
“Bloody hell, how does he still talk like that, he must have had, what, four glasses of wine?” Ron shakes his head and lets out a low burp. “Sorry.”
Harry doesn’t want to make him cagey about it, so he doesn’t jump him right then and there. He doesn’t cry either, although he does feel it would be possible, maybe if he were a little different. Harry also doesn’t die, even though he should because no heart has ever beat as fast as his is at that moment. For the lack of anything better to do, he just kisses him, probably for the thousandth time in those last two days, and Draco sighs into it, then tries to hide his face in Harry’s neck.
“Mate. I get to eat cake all day,” Ron says sagely, although there’s a happy little glint in his blue eyes. “I was supposed to eat cake next week, I find out I get to eat cake today. It’s a good day,” he nods as if confirming it in his heart. “Besides, ‘Mione needs a calming presence.”
“It’s some sort of a romance novel,” Draco says. “Nothing award-worthy, probably something old auntie Walburga kept under her pillow for a cheap thrill.”
, do get your mind out of the gutter,” Draco says exasperatedly, reading Harry’s expression in a matter of seconds. “Not all gay men have slept with each other, you know,” he adds grumpily.
They update each other on everything that’s been going on, with Harry sedulously omitting the part where he’s fucking his charge, and they pause, listening to the faint static on the other side of the call. In lieu of goodbye, Harry asks Ron to find her. Ron says he’ll do what he can. Harry asks him to promise.
