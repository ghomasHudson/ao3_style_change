"Don't mind him Neville, Malfoy's just taking the piss."
"Draco." Theo's voice takes on a serious tone that makes Draco go still. He looks up and Theo watches his face. "I know you've been enjoying yourself at these suppers, despite your protests. Don't forget yourself entirely."
Around the semi-circle, the hat changes hands. There was a great roar of laughter when Finnigan is the first to be declared NAUGHTY, the red hat darkening to a deep black, piping acrid smoke from the tip. Granger was obviously NICE, Parvati who looked as if things could go either way, and Blaise, who tossed the hat as if he’d been burned when declared NAUGHTY.
“Potter.”
Potter. He’ll be fine.
“On the contrary, it would explain all the grammar mistakes.”
"Really, Draco!" Pansy shouts, tossing the Lovegoods’ livelihood over the side of the bed. "You’re making me work harder than someone I actually have a chance at shagging. Yet not one mention of our green-eyed, bed-headed savior?"
Draco’s eyes flutter. He leans down and picks it up,
“Explain
By Wednesday he’s picked all the fruit in the orchard, re-soiled all the pots, and has pulled all the weeds from between the blooms. He changes the spell work on the fountain so that the spray is iridescent, light illuminating the roses it blooms at night, petals floating on the water.
“We’re seeing where it goes, while not seeing anyone else,” Harry answers smoothly. “I’m not a fan of labels. And really, it’s no one else's business but Draco and I. If anyone's asking," he adds, with finality.
Draco leaves without his tea.
Draco walks into the room, his eyes immediately seeking Potter out amongst the many, many cushions spread across the floor in a layer so thick, there's no stone to be seen beyond them. Potter sits crossed-legged, wearing a Cannons t-shirt and a pair of modest boxer shorts. Draco's eyes roam over his exposed calves and forearms, the latter flexing enticingly as Potter reaches forward to grab a handful of popcorn.
happened.”
Draco turns several times in place. Judging from the view he must be in one of the towers. He can see the night sky, stars spread across the dark like spilled salt.
It’s suffocating.
The saddest part of all is that Draco can’t say the idea hasn’t crossed his mind. On numerous occasions as of late.
Turning on his feet, Draco’s smart shoes click clack the pavement as he follows Hangingbone off the courtyard and through a side entrance, back into the castle. Consumed by thoughts of Potter and his stubborn temper, it’s not until they pass both the door to Hangingbone’s classroom with the emblem of a holiday pudding, and her office on the first floor, that Draco notices she’s leading him across the empty foyer to take the staircase that leads down to the harbor, and not the dungeons.
"Hullo, Blaise. Draco." Cho Chang is wearing a red summer dress, her dark hair pulled back at the nape of her neck. It's simple, but elegant. He supposes she looks beautiful if you like that sort of thing. Draco scowls as his eyes dart once more to the fountain.
Draco watches through his fingers as the Hufflepuff takes a sip. Nothing immediately happens and Ernie takes another long swig before Draco feels his shoulders start to relax.
She hefts her handbag onto the table before her, busily rummaging inside. “And while many of those traditions are familiar to you, I thought today’s lesson could do with a bit of fun.”
“Yes?” Draco can feel his hackles rising. “That’s what you’ve told us we had to do in order for--” He pauses, his eyes darting to the smaller Weasley who stares back at him challengingly from her perch. “In order for us to work out or difference,” he finishes stiffly.
“I didn’t know you were a fan,” Potter’s face lights up like the tree behind him and Draco feels his breath catch. He looks from Potter’s face back down to the album, flustered as heat rises in his face.
The house elf -- Corey? Cappy? -- holds out the box for a second time. "Please Mr.Draco, Karrey will be in trouble if he can not verify all wands are present."
When the plates have thankfully been cleared away, individual tubs of ice cream are wheeled out in a metal trolley. Ben and Jerry's comes in a remarkable assortment of flavors and Draco feels rather safe in his selection as he chooses it. Turns out muggle ice cream tastes the same as what he's used to, even if there is no fizzing or whizzing to go along with it.
Reaching for his quill, Draco ignores Harry in favor of dipping it into his inkpot. He’s using a deep green today, and even in his head, he’s finds it saccharine to think that the color matches Harry’s eyes. When the quill has enough ink, Draco touches it to a scrap of parchment. He glances at Harry out of the corner of his eye. “Are you sure you shouldn’t have been in Slytherin? You’ve taken to us well enough.”
"That’s alright, we’ve just ordered drinks," Longbottom laughs, beaming up at Potter. "Sit down, sit down."
It’s Hangingbone who cries out, the color draining from her face. It's too late to draw her wand. The Santa hat neither stands erect, nor turns black, but begins to violently twist in on its self atop Potter’s head. Blinding light, like a hundred lumos or the final moments of a dying star, causes Draco to shield his eyes as the light bursts and Potter topples to the ground.
Draco comes, jerking with each pulse of his release as he groans, low in his throat until he’s he spent, and sags. Potter’s moist breath cools the flush of his neck., the prickle of sweat at his nape. When his heartbeat steadies, Draco pulls back just enough to look down.
"I'm a very giving person, Harry. You'd know that if you took the time. Those Potter Stinks badges weren't cheap."
“Draco?” Beside him, Ernie looks confused.
Draco blinks. Disappoint wells up within him like he’s submerged himself in the lake. He doesn’t understand. He was so sure that his theory was right.
A few minutes later, Potter returns: he’d ducked down to the kitchens to bring them all piping hot mugs of hot chocolate, decorated lovingly by the elves with marshmallows that looked like snowmen, smiling up at them as they drank. There were sprigs of cinnamon in each cup and perfectly sweetened.
Potter runs a hand through his messy curls and grins. "You too. Do you plan to actually eat something this time?"
"Malfoy, you’re not making any sense."
The elevator dings. The doors spring open, but neither one of them steps back despite the interruption. Potter closes his eyes, leaning his forehead to Draco's temple. He allows it until the doors slide shut again, leaving them alone in the corridor. Then he pushes Potter back.
"Says you," Pansy says, leaning over the side of her deck chair. "Mind healing is a form of treatment, Draco. Meditation. Counseling. All things you’ve done because the Ministry led you to believe it would help your case." She pulls her shades off entirely, mouth pinched. "And now these dinners?"
From the end the table, seated between Millicent and Finnigan, Longbottom looks up. "Alright, Harry?"
“Of course not!”
“Ron, c’mon,” Potter shakes his head, pink rising in his cheeks. “Don’t call him that.”
"Darling," she says with restraint, "Auror Abernathy’s kindly offered to accompany me in visiting your Aunt Andromeda, once he returns from seeing you off."
"Draco?" calls a soft voice.
Harry laughs. Presses his palms flat to Draco’s back and slides them down to grip the flesh of his arse, pulling his cheeks apart as he picks up his pace. Draco’s pajamas are pushed down around his calves, Harry’s down to mid-thigh. His skin is damp and Draco’s hands slips, finding purchase in the sheets as his mouth falls open. “Harry,” It comes out as a strangled warning. Dolt that he is, Potter just laughs again and wraps his fingers around Draco’s prick, gives his a few skillful pulls to match the rhythm of his hips as Draco moans.
“I think they’ve finally reached some kind of agreement. Hangingbone’s free to stake her claim as long as she dedicates herself to helping Sprout harvest the next batch of leaping toadstools.”
Draco shakes his head. "So I’m another of your sycophants, am I? Lord Potter, reigning over Wizarding Britain like the King of everything while us peasants fall to our knees and lick your boots."
“Perhaps it’s why you’re so fair. Hermione suspected there might be Veelas in your family, but I didn’t think there were any--” Potter stops short as a stately looking Eagle owl soars towards them, its wings extended as it enters a smooth glide. Even after so long, Draco recognizes his mother’s owl Bellero instantly and while his stomach swoops at the thought of what could possibly be in the envelope she clutches, he’s more relieved to know his mother has finally broken their silent standoff.
“So tell me, Potter,” Pansy points her wand at his face. “Have you ever considered what you’d look like with a face full of fur? I've always imagined you as the Dumbledore type, myself.”
They take the idea for its first spin that afternoon. The Hufflepuffs are holding a practice match on the Quidditch pitch in preparation for next week’s game. In defiance of the cold, and the fact that eighth years aren’t allowed to play as there’s no room for it in their schedules, there’s a rather large turnout of students sitting in the bleachers. He and Potter keep a healthy amount of space between them as they walk up the stairs, although there’s the occasional bumping of shoulders, the brushing of arms. Draco feels every sensation like currents under his skin.
In bed, it was even worse. Draco had lain wide awake, alone with his thoughts and resentful of the bright green that glittered angrily before him whenever he tried to close his eyes. Desperation had him casting a silencing charm in order to pull himself off -- a method he knew to be quite effective -- except the thought that those eyes and the urge to wank could in
“Dwayho?!” His eyes are wide and panicked, drool falling from Ernie’s chin due to his inability to shut his mouth.
It’s a light supper of tea and toast in the Gryffindor common room, side by side in front of the fire, before Harry takes Draco’s hand and leads him quietly into his dorm. The others are already asleep, their curtains drawn. They crawl into Harry’s bed and slip under the sheets, Harry drawing Draco’s body to before his head has hit the pillow.
“She’ll be fine if you can manage some meaty bits from the kitchens,” Draco says absently, turning the letter over in his fingers. It feels a bulky, and when he breaks the wax seal on the back, something small and shiny falls out into his palm.
"Three weeks of randomly assigned dinners, yet we always end up at the same table. I wrote to the Ministry after the second time because I thought there had to be some kind of mistake."
"It doesn’t have to make sense. Nothing involving you ever does." Draco throws him a haughty look. "That’s how I know that I’m right."
“Distracted, were you?” Blaise asks, smugly. Don’t worry, we thought as much. Would you like the third degree now or now? Believe me, it’s much better to get it over with while we’re tipsy enough not to remember anything endearing you might say. Drink, Potter?”
“So you’re telling me that you’re not a dom when you have sex for pleasure instead of work?” Harry asked.
“I’m still me though, so I’m okay with banter and playful insults among friends. But never in a scene unless it’s explicitly desired. I have a few regulars who come in specifically so I can talk down on them. I just don’t care much for it outside of that.”
“May I help you?” A woman’s smokey voice came from the buzzer speaker.
The door clicked as it unlocked.
Much of them were no’s for Harry. Like spanking and insulting/humiliation, which reminded him too much of his childhood.
Malfoy shrugged. “I had plenty of time to think while I was on house arrest. Surviving a war puts things into perspective. Plus, it’s like I said, this is my job and I like what I do. I like how it makes me feel.”
Harry Potter would gladly submit to another man, but only when he wanted to.
“Have you used toys before then?”
Harry could feel the tension in his arms and he wanted to beg, but he couldn’t beg yet, not this soon. “It’s small. I’ve only used it a few times,” he said, ignoring the last question.
Harry muttered the words for each spell, lubing up and loosening the tight rim. Malfoy groaned and closed his eyes, able to feel the magic working on him. Harry didn't personally like the feel of those spells but Malfoy made it look like it felt amazing.
His heels clicked as he stepped closer. His hands were still warm as they lightly ran across Harry’s shoulders, down his chest and abs, only to settle on his hips as Malfoy leaned in and whispered, “I’m also impressed at that big cock you have. Maybe I’ll get some use out of it tonight. If you follow my every order, that is. Only good boys get rewards, Harry.”
It felt like ages before he heard the door click open behind him and the signature sound of heeled footsteps enter the room.
Long hairless legs stretched up to very short black shorts, the bottoms of Malfoy’s arse cheeks hanging out. The shorts looked skin tight. He wondered if he’d be allowed to peel the tight fabric off the other man at some point.
Harry gulped and spoke without even thinking. “Will I get to cum.”
He saw stars, beautiful constellations.
The hand not cradling Harry’s head palmed at the front of his leather shorts, a bulge visible, mouthwatering and tantalizing, patiently waiting for attention.  It was the most erotic thing Harry had ever seen Malfoy do. Malfoy of old was a snotty little bastard out to do whatever for fame and fortune- including bullying Harry. But this man before him now was sexy and safe.
He probably continued visiting Malfoy at Miss D’s for 6 or 7 months before he got the nerve to ask Malfoy out for coffee.
All Draco Malfoy could do was wait, staring at nothing and hoping enigmatically that Potter lived.
Then everything became chaotic again and Draco stopped thinking of the string for a while.
“My, my, Harry,” Malfoy grinned. “Look at you. I see that becoming an Auror has made you fit. I’m impressed.”
Draco Malfoy was using Harry for his own pleasure. But it was all because Harry let it happen. Harry wanted this to happen. Harry wanted to be used, because this was the only way being used felt good. This was the only way that being used gave Harry a sense of fulfilment.
“Yes, sir. I think about getting fucked,” he replied, nervously.
"Malfoy, what the fuck?" Potter said, still holding his hand to keep him still. His other hand scratched through his messy hair and he looked at the floor, pensive. Then he sighed and looked up at Draco, eye to eye. “Did someone give you a strange potion?”
Harry groaned again, head tipping back as a wave of lust flushed his body from head to toe. “Yes, sir,” he whispered.
The fucking thought would have made him laugh just hours ago.
Harry groaned. Malfoy's hands were back on his arms, inching their way up to his shoulders. They stopped where they cradled his neck and those caressing thumbs smoothed against his cheeks, smearing the now cool cum.
“Fill this out for me,” she instructed, again with the kind smile. “It’s our kink negotiation checklist. Simple yes or no for kinks and toys. It helps us narrow down the escort best suited for you- unless you request someone specific of course. The escort will get a copy so they know what they can and cannot do with you. You fill this out for every session.”
“And if we were to meet outside of this room, would you go back to being the same old Malfoy I remember?” Harry asked, not sure why. He just knew that a part of him missed the times where all he could think about was catching Malfoy in some nefarious plot. Well, the ones that didn’t involve 6th year and Voldemort trying to kill him anyway.
“I think I’ve thought of how to reward you for being such a good boy. What do you think it is?”
. No more trying to live and love in a world that treasures a particular image of him, but actually knows very little of the real Harry Potter.
Once clean, Malfoy helped him sit up and walked him over to the warm bed. “You can’t sleep here, but this is much more comfortable then the bench.”
It put a little fire of fear burning in Draco's chest. No one, not his parents, not his friends, not even Potter could see the strings. Only he could. At least, that he knew of. And he didn't know what it meant. But he wanted it to stop.
He pressed the button, his hands sweaty and his lips in a thin line.
The round blunt end of the butt plug pressed into him slowly. Harry moaned and his fingers stretched wide, reaching for who knows what. The feeling of getting filled felt so good, sending these waves of electricity straight up to his scalp and back down to his cock. He wanted to cum so bad.
Harry’s lips twitched again, but this time it formed into a smirk. "Merlin, can we at least get dinner or something first before you admit your undying love for me?"
A finger trailed down the length of Harry’s erection, making it pulse at finally being touched.
Even with thinking that, Draco still felt a weight lift from him when Potter moved.
“We’re still going to start slow,” he said, sternly. “Stand up and strip. Fold your clothes and put them on the chair beside the bed. Do take your time, though, Harry. I like a show.”
. Why did that make Malfoy so happy? It was the happiest he’d been in years. The string pulsed with a loving glow.
The footsteps felt like it was slowing down his erratic heartbeat. As if the calm saunter of the man walking in was enough to simmer down his worries.
"Please," Harry croaked. "Please sir. I want your cum. I want your cum all over my face. Please. I need it." By the last word, tears clung to Harry's eyelashes and he was panting harder. He hasn't said words so true to his own desires in a long time. His next words were practically cried. "Please, sir. Let me have your cum."
, Draco thought repeatedly.
She took him to a room that made much more sense to what he had imagined this type of place would look like. Red walls with black leather floggers, whips, and ropes hanging on hooks. There were padded benches with leather cuffs attached and a large open armoire that housed silk scarves, dildos, and other sex toys Harry wasn’t familiar with. In the back of the room, which was the size of a typical bedroom, was a bed, covered in silk pillows and black sheets. On one side of it was a nightstand with bottles of water and chocolate bars. On the other side of the bed was a tall mirror with wheels so it could easily move around the hardwood floors.
The sky remains a stark, grey, backdrop as the players zip through the sky in their yellow jerseys, like bees in a hive. Draco glances for a seat, the corner of his mouth ticking up when Ernie spots him from high in the bleachers and motions with a friendly wave.
In the distance, a horse neighs. A carriage, drawn by two regal looking horses, glides towards them. There's no driver, but when the horses reach them, it stops and waits.
"Is that all you're going to have?" he asks Finnigan, his brows knit as he leans forward.
Blaise looks up in surprise as Draco busies himself smoothing his parchment.
Potter took a deep breath. “Hey. Forget it. Maybe, you can come by the Tower when you’re done?” He runs an errant hand through his hair and tugs at a knot. “I’m not up for skating. We can just hang out or something.”
“Are you alright?” Potter rolls off of him into the snow, still panting as he turns his head to look at Draco.
Outside the tall, thin windows, the weather is frightful for early December — snow coming down so thick that even the best owl would be waylaid by it. It’s a perfectly reasonable excuse as to why his mother has yet to communicate any definite plans. Last year’s celebrations hadn’t exactly left them in the mood for a repeat.
“Fair enough,” Blaise says with a shrug. Pansy looks like she has more to add to that but Blaise stops her with a subtle shake of the head. She frowns but seemingly drops the subject. Instead she turns to Harry, a mischievous smile curving her lips.
"Pureblood homes are always built on land rich in magical attributes," He tries not to take Harry’s confused expression as a personal offense. "There’s enough nutrients in the grounds of Malfoy Manor to replicate the Forbidden Forest if we wanted." Draco shakes his head. "As it were, we’ve been selling what we grow as a way to recoup some of our losses."
“Pit you-- You think I like this?"
Still, the words are out of Draco’s mouth before he can put sense to them. Gryffindor recklessness seems to be catching. Perhaps he’s picked it up through osmosis alone.
The first week of July brings with it the third gathering of Squill & Spoon. Draco apparates into the middle of a clearing-- the grass is high and springy, coming up to his knees. The evening air smells fresh and the sun is on the horizon, painting the sky a brilliant orange. A sense of calm suddenly comes over Draco, despite the isolation of the current location, and he closes his eyes, feeling the sun on his face. The arrival of another person is brought on by a shift in the air. His eyes track across the expanse, looking for the source, spotting Blaise Zabini heading on a rather direct course across the grass his way.
Pansy and Theo exchange a glance. Persephone whinnies somewhere off to their left...
From the corner of his eye, he spies a quill inching towards his inkpot. Frowning, Draco slides the bottle just out of Parvati’s reach.
"Well," Potter says, tersely, "tell your sources that was just an assignment, and the assignment is over."
behind bars and I have
Potter nods, his eyes still closed. “Yeah.”
"Draco, where would you ever get that idea, you must have misheard me. You should get rest at night, you're very tired. Or perhaps a hobby? Something to help ease the tension and stress"
"That was nice?" Potter laughs in disbelief.
It’s not until once again, Draco stands gazing up at the portrait of The Fat Lady, his palms sweaty, that he stops to think about just how ludicrous this idea truly is. He’s about to willingly enter the lion’s den, surround himself with a room full of brash, reckless Gryffindors to something as cozy as wrap presents together. There was offering the proverbial olive branch and  then there was offering oneself to be eaten alive.
"Draco, really. Don’t be boring."
“What, like an
Any trepidation he felt now over crossing lines would be much easier to ignore if the line remained vague.
Chapter 9
sorry for the erratic posting I've hit a bad writers block with the story and will bring you new chapters as soon as i write them. Thanks for reading!
sorry this took so long to get up! got a little bit of writers block and then COVID exploded in my country. so here's a break from the worlds stresses with our two clueless boys!
When he woke up, he was on edge, having spent most of his night chasing the man with wild black hair and piercing green eyes through his dreams. He couldn’t figure out who they belonged to and that was just adding to his frustration from the day before. He had also woken up with his cock so hard that it hurt. He drew back the covers and they drifted over his achingly hard member eliciting a moan from him. He stuffed his hand down his pajama bottoms and firmly gripped his weeping cock. Starting with slow strokes he began to move his hand up and down his cock. Rubbing a thumb over the slit and spreading generous amounts of precum all down himself he began to pump faster thrusting his hips up as be brought his hand down. He was starting to sweat and all he could see behind his lids was that man with those gorgeous green eyes. He imagined him from his dreams that night and sped up his stroking as he was teetering right on the edge of his orgasm more details came to focus such as a lightning bolt scar on his forehead. Draco let out a strangled cry as he spilled himself all over his hand and into his pajama bottoms. What the hell had that been? Had he just wanked to the image of Potter? He cast a quick cleaning charm on his bottoms and himself and headed into his shower even more frustrated than he had woken up.
He was pulled out of his thoughts when Professor Melbourne entered the room. She came to the front of the semi circle and called every one’s attention to her. “Since you all have survived a war with most if not all of you either on the run or in situations which required more than your fair share of defensive magic, the Headmistress and I thought it was more appropriate for the ten of you to be in a separate class.”  She said while looking around at them. “In this class we will be focusing on how we can rebuild the wizarding world after such a divisive war. You will be paired up and the two of you will need to work on and present a way we can help the wizarding world come back together.  To help us heal and make it better for future generations. The pairs will be of my choosing.” At that there was a collective groan from around the semi circle. She ignored this and powered through. “Ron Weasley and Susan Bones, Theodore Nott and Harry Potter, Parvati Patil and Neville Longbottom, Daphne Greengrass and Hannah Abbott, and Draco Malfoy and Hermione Granger.” As soon as she said Hermione and his name, Weasley was starring daggers at him, he lifted his chin determined to not show how nervous he was.
A click made him look up and stop reliving the events of the last few months. He looked up to find Theo smiling shyly at him. He hadn’t seen Theo since before the battle of Hogwarts but he had received several letters from him while in Azkaban, one of his only friends that had bothered to after the war. He slid over to let Theo into the compartment. Theo had grown into his looks he wasn’t as lanky as he was during sixth year, he had grown about half a foot and filled out with much more muscle than he had then. He noticed Theo looking at him expectantly and he realized he must have said something. “What?” said Draco. “Well if you were listening to me you would have know I have found out something very interesting.” Theo said while giving Draco a sly smile. “Out with-it Nott I don’t want to spend the whole ride to Hogwarts with you basically jumping up and down in your seat trying to hold it back.” Draco said lamely. “Well I think you would be interested to know who else will be eighth years this year and I happen to know”, “well just say tell me then” Draco said starting to get irritated. “Hermione Granger, but that’s no shock there. I would be more shocked if she hadn’t come”, “Susan Bones, she’s a Hufflepuff” Theo clarified when Draco gave him a blank expression. “Neville Longbottom, Parvati Patil, Daphne Greengrass, Hannah Abbott, Ron Weasely though I expect he is just following Hermione, and Harry Potter” Draco’s head snapped to look at Theo like he had just sent a stinging hex to his heart. Of course, Saint Potter would come back. Couldn’t he just get a year away from Potter and all his glory. Theo had a smug smile on his face obviously having got the reaction he had wanted out of Draco. Draco glared at him and turned back to the window. This was going to be a long year of trying to avoid Potter and his merry gang. His probation just got a whole lot harder.
His first class was double potions and when he arrived, he found that all the seats had been taken except the one beside Malfoy. He reluctantly took a seat beside Malfoy and started getting his books out for the class. Professor Slughorn entered the room puffing like he has just run from a stampeding hippogriff, he turned to the class and announced that they would be reviewing what they should have learned for the previous year “due to the interruption in several of your education we will start with the draught of peace. Who you are sitting beside will be your potions partner for the rest of term.” He said then started writing the instructions for the potion on the board. “Great” Harry muttered. “Contrary to your popular belief Potter, I am not to thrilled about being paired with you either” Malfoy interjected has he went to set up their cauldron.  Harry huffed at him and went to get the ingredients from the store closet. When he returned Malfoy was bent over his potions book studying the potion they were going to be making. Harry started to prep the ingredients they would be using for their potion “the valerian root should be sliced into thin equal slices, stop mangling it.” Malfoy said to him. “How have you survived this long without basic potions knowledge Potter” Malfoy scoffed. “shut it Malfoy” Harry said feeling irritation prickle his skin. “This is a 5

Not even a day in and he already had detention and it had been all Potters fault.  If he hadn’t been so incompetent at potions, he wouldn’t be in this mess right now. As he headed down to the dungeons for their shared detention, he was thinking about how exactly everything had gone to shit. He had been insulting potter and then all of a sudden Potter had drawn his wand on him and he had retaliated by drawing his wand to, as to be expected.  Potter seemed to be even more hot headed than he was before Draco scoffed. Potter was always walking around thinking he could do whatever he wanted and not get in trouble for it. He had always been that way and the teachers had always fallen for it. Well everyone except his godfather.
(See the end of the chapter for
When he got up that morning it felt as though he had been hit by a heard of stampeding hippogriffs. He grumbled as he found his glasses and got his robes on not even bothering to look in the mirror at the mess he knew his hair was. When he got down to the great hall for breakfast, he found Ron and Hermione and sat down. “You look terrible Mate.” Ron said looking at him from across the table. “Rough night.” He replied. Ron and Hermione knew he had nightmares but never asked him about them because they knew he would just avoid the question. “I wonder what defence will be like today.” Ron said changing the subject. The new teacher they didn’t know a Professor Melbourne, she was a muggleborn and spent most of the war in hiding and helping other muggleborns hide themselves and their families, that’s all they had heard about their new Professor. “We all basically know the whole curriculum.” Hermione said glancing up from her defense textbook. They finished the rest of their breakfast in silence all wondering what the new Professor had in store for them.
to brighten the room to get his baring’s. He was still in his room at Hogwarts and no signs of fire around him. He let out a breath he didn’t know he had been holding. He grabbed his glasses off his nightstand and shoved them on his face while he swung himself out of bed and padded to the bathroom. He took a cool shower to wash off the sweat and grabbed new pajamas and headed back to bed. He was exhausted and when his head hit the pillow, he fell into another fit full sleep with flashes of platinum blonde hair running across his unconscious mind.
The sound of Lunas voice drew him out of his thoughts. “I saw Draco Malfoy on the platform he seemed a bit sad” she announced to the compartment with the same dreamy voice she always used. “Of course, he’s miserable! He’s a bloody Death Eater! He probably is just sulking cause daddy can’t protect him this year.” Said Ron. “RONALD!” Hermione shouted at him hitting him with the book she was holding. “What?! Do you really think believe he’s changed and not a slimy git like he always was?” Ron said while cradling the spot Hermione had hit. “I don’t think he is the same boy from school” Luna remarked “He was a lot more caring than the boy in school when they had me locked in his dungeon.” She said with the same airy tone she had been using earlier. Luna still managed to take them off guard with the way she would casually mention the war. Harry couldn’t help but remember how Malfoy had looked at the manor that night, face gaunt and skinny with his usually meticulously hair falling limp in his eyes, looking at him and turning around refusing the positively identify him to his aunt Bellatrix.
I will probably be updating every saturday or sunday until the fic is done. not sure how long it will be but so far I have 8 chapters completed.
How had Potter landed him in detention again? Couldn’t the git just drop the class if he was this awful at it? Draco was fuming by the time he joined Theo at the Slytherin table. “What’s up with you?” Theo said looking at him with a sly smile. “Fucking Potter landed me in detention for the second week in a row because the lunatic just loves blowing up our potions.” Draco grumbled as he plopped down beside him pulling a plate of pot pies closer to him. Theo chuckled at Draco earning a glare from the latter. “Yes, I saw the rather impressive explosion across the classroom.” Theo said. “The idiot couldn’t brew a proper potion even if his life depended on it! I have no idea why he is even taking the class if he is so shit at it. You would think he would have the common sense to at least drop it and get out of my damn hair.” Draco said glaring at his lunch. “He seems to get nervous around you.” Theo said not even giving him a glance. Draco’s head snapped up at Theos words. “Why the hell would he get nervous around me?” Draco asked him. “Well maybe he thinks you are a good-looking bloke.” Theo said smiling at him with mischievous smile. Draco snorted into his pot pie, “yeah right. He’s not even gay Theo.” He said. “I wouldn’t be so sure.” Theo said looking at Draco with that same damn smile. “He’s with the she weasel so I highly doubt it.” Draco said. “Actually, rumour has it they broke up over the summer.” Theo was looking at him an increasingly devilish smile. Draco’s heart gave a little flutter at the new news which confused him, why his heart would do such a thing about the benign news as potters love life woes. Theo was watching him like a cat would stalk their prey. Draco steeled himself and looked Theo in the eye putting on his signature Malfoy mask of indifference before he told Theo “Why would I care what Potter does or doesn’t do with his love life. It doesn’t affect me in the slightest.” “sure it doesn’t mate.” Theo said with that stupid grin still on his face like he had finally caught his prey. Draco just huffed in response and went back to his lunch.
Chapter 4
It was a brilliantly sunny day, despite the nice day Draco couldn’t clear the storm inside his head. The trial was less than two months ago and he just couldn’t wrap his head around the idea of The Golden Boy testifying on his behalf. Why had Saint Potter told the Wizagmont that Draco, while not entirely innocent, had been merely a child forced to play his part in the war or be murdered by the dark lord. While what the golden boy had said was true Draco couldn’t understand why Potter had stuck his neck out for him. The weeks leading up to his trial were some of the worst of his life. While having the dark lord occupy the same house as you for two years could be terrifying there was nothing like the effect of a dementor every day for weeks on end. The dementors were supposed to be banished from Azkaban but the process of removing them was apparently more difficult than the ministry had expected. Every day he spent there he would hear the screams of those who had lost their minds to the effects of the dementors and tried his best not the let them affect him.
Draco woke up that morning with a raging hard on. He wiped the sleep out of his eyes and trudged to the bathroom. He stepped out of his pajamas and into the hot stream of water, he sighed as it hit his back and cascaded over his shoulders. He took his aching cock into his hand and slowly started pumping using his pre-cum for lube. He started picking up the pace using his go to fantasy of being fucked in the shower, as he was coming closer to the edge, he imagined looking at the person fucking, and to his horror he found a familiar mop of messy black hair and piercing green eyes. He came with a strangled cry and spilled himself down the drain letting the shower wash away the evidence. “what the fuck was that?!” he whispered to himself trying to make sense of what had happened. He finished his shower and stepped out of the bathtub grabbing a towel to dry off. He walked back to his room still struggling to make sense of what had happened in the shower. Pulling on his robes he thought to himself there is no way he could fancy Potter; it had just been pure coincidence being due to having detention with him the night and had been messing with his head. That was sure to be it because there could be no chance in hell that he would fancy Potter.
Harry woke up to the sun starting to peak out through his curtains. He had had a fitful sleep last night with nightmares coming and going in a blur all night. He rubbed the sleep out of his eyes and found his glasses on his nightstand, he grabbed his wand after shoving his glasses on his face and cast a quick
Harry had barely listened to the start of term feast; he was busy keeping an eye on Malfoy. He did notice that most people tended to keep their distance not out of fear but out of disgust. He sort of felt bad for Malfoy at least during the hard times in fifth year he had his friends to lean on but Malfoy didn’t seem to have to many friends. Harrys brain barely registered the end of the feast and his feet mindlessly carried him towards the front of the hall. McGonagall was telling them about the new accommodations for the eighth years. When he heard about having his own room, he was relieved that he didn’t have to disturb anyone with his nightmares that he still had every night. Lately he kept having the nightmare about fiendfyre and barely making it out he rarely woke up without being covered in a cold sweat thinking he could still hear the roar of the fire in his ears. “Nice of them to give us our own rooms!” Ron said while winking at Hermione. She rolled her eyes and started walking out of the great hall. “It will be nice to have a common room for just us; it will really help with studying for our N.E.W.T.S” Hermione mused. Ron just groaned beside her, “Really Ronald you would think a bit of studying would kill you” she said while shaking her head at him. He took her in his arms and gave her a squeeze chuckling. Harry just looked away and sped up to catch up with Neville at the front of the eighth-year horde. “How was your summer Neville?” Harry asked. “It was good, spent most of it up here helping professor sprout rebuild and replant the greenhouses.” He said. Harry had been invited to help rebuild Hogwarts and he had come for the first week but had found it to hard for him and had to leave. McGonagall of course had understood and told him to contact her if he wanted to come help again after some time off. “What do you think the rooms will look like?” Neville said. “I’m not sure I just assumed they would look like they did in Gryffindor tower” he said. They had come to the door of the common room and Neville reached out his hand and touched the door, once hit hand met the door it dissolved showing the entrance into the common room.
Chapter 3
What the hell had Malfoy been playing at? Why had he cornered him in the store cupboard like that? After he had left, he wondered to himself if Malfoy had caught him looking at his arse. Why had he been looking at his arse? He surely couldn’t fancy Malfoy. Sure, he was a decent looking bloke but Harry wasn’t really into that was he? He had fancied Ginny and Cho and they were both girls so he couldn’t be gay. Although he never really did anything with Cho except that one wet snog in the room of requirements, and while Ginny was beautiful and he should have wanted to do more than just snog her he could never bring himself to do more. He had found Cedric half decent looking but he really hadn’t given it a serious thought. A sudden cold and wet feeling wrenched him out of his thoughts he looked up to find Peeves cackling wildly above him clearly satisfied with having hit Harry directly with a water balloon. “Awe Potty is all wet” he screeched in between his cackling as he swooped away before Harry could do anything.
Ron said he was acting like he’d gotten a boyfriend. Harry told him he was crazy.
The warm damp towel ran over his hole first, cleaning the lube off, then went up to his soft spent cock and cleaned that too. Then Malfoy cleaned his belly and chest, getting the cum Malfoy had spilled on him. He dropped the cloth on the floor and grabbed a package of face wipes from the night stand, taking one out. The cloth smelled like cucumber melon and felt refreshing on Harry’s sweaty, cum covered face. Malfoy handed Harry the bottle of water to drink as he finished wiping the brunet down.
But deep inside (where that little flame of fear had nestled in his chest because of the string and Potter) it was clear that he couldn’t do it. Draco knew that he couldn't just give Potter up to die. His conscious and his heart wouldn't be able to handle it. Draco was not that type of person. He never really was and he never really would be, apparently.
"Try not to cum until I say so," Malfoy ordered, voice still tinged with that stern domination, even as it quivered.
Draco scoffed. He turned, hiding his eyes behind the curtain of his hair. Then he walked to the hook near the door where a long silk black robe hung. He put it on and crossed his arms over his chest, still not looking at Harry. An aura of shame and annoyance came over the blond like a cloud overhead. He looked at the wall in thought, mouth twisted and thin.
“Yes, sir,” Harry said again.
The stupid little inch of string that hung from where it looped around his finger would do something funny, as well. Anytime he was near Potter it would reach out in the direction of Potter's string. And Potter's would do the same. It was as if the strings wanted to connect. Like they belonged to the same thread.
Malfoy gave him a soft smile and his eyes looked like smouldering ashes once more. “Shh. Shhhh,” Malfoy shushed. He leaned forward and took Harry’s face in his hands. “It’s okay. Don’t think about that. Listen to my voice. Think about right now. Think about how good this feels. Do you feel good?”
Another challenge Harry was determined to do a good job at.
He couldn't even think straight. His mind was foggy and his cock was leaking, starting a little puddle of pre-cum on the dark hardwood floor near his feet. The sight of Malfoy bent over, legs looking strong with him in those high heels, talking about fucking Harry with a toy while he’s strapped to the bench. Harry felt so weak, but so powerful at the same time.
Harry swallowed thickly before responding. "Green."
When the war was in full swing and he was home, surrounded by Death Eaters and a giant snake, only then did he focus on the string. It stood out against the greys and darkness that suffocated the Malfoy Manor. He would rub his thumb against it for comfort sometimes when he would train with Aunt Bella. He'd roll the bit of hanging string between the thumb and forefinger of his other hand out of habit when he couldn't sleep; the nightmares too much to handle. And on many nights, he wondered if Harry Potter could finally see the string, or if it remained a figment of his own imagination.
Harry had wanted release and he was so damn close to getting it.
Harry tried to nod, but he was feeling overwhelmed with every sensation. Everything felt so good. He couldn’t articulate a single word or even a thought. He had never felt this incredible.
Getting a hold of himself took a minute but eventually Malfoy crouched down again, and uncuffed Harry's arms. He helped Harry slowly stand up straight before guiding him to sit up on the bench. Malfoy's warm hands massaged the aching muscles of Harry's arms. The comforting feel of Malfoy's hands on his body made Harry's mind get more and more foggy. It felt so nice. He felt so cared for.
“I love you, too,” Draco whispered after a second. It was so soft Harry could have dreamed it.
. His body relaxed again.
"Don't move. I'm going to use you like the toy you are and if you dare move Potter, I'll leave you here just like this until time is up."
His pants were getting tight again, Harry couldn’t wait to take them off if only to ease the pressure a little. Slowly, Harry removed his t-shirt, folded it and placed it on the floor first. He stepped out of his shoes and pulled off his socks next. Then he tugged out his belt and unbuttoned his jeans, letting them slip down on their own, leaving him in just a new pair of boxers he had bought specifically for tonight. He folded the jeans before sliding down the blue cotton pants down his hairy legs. He took the folded clothes and put it on the empty chair, then waited.
“If I had known you were bent, Potter, I would have let you shag me instead of trying to kill you,” Malfoy said, playfulness twitching his lips.
When he saw who it was he instantly jumped back across the room.
He never had been.
“Please what?”
“What does that mean?” Ron asked, confused and Harry’s entire body flushed.
The blond backed away and stood somewhere behind the restrained man. Not knowing where he was or what he was doing drove Harry mad. He strained to hear the now comfortable click of Malfoy’s pumps.
He loved the fucking savior of the wizarding world.
Those strong warm hands maneuvered Harry to lay back against the bench, the leather cool and nice against the parts of his body that had been flogged. Harry felt like he was floating when he heard Malfoy get the cuffs under the bench again.
Malfoy hummed in approval. “I’ll reward your job well done, by allowing you to suck me off. And if you’re really good…” he trailed off, stopping the swipes of the flogger against Harry’s shoulders and bum. Harry trembled at the feel of Malfoy’s lips and the warmth of Malfoy’s breath on the shell of his ear. “Maybe I’ll let you fuck me too.”
He and Potter had a connection. A destiny owed to each other that they couldn't break. And all Draco could think about for a few more months, was... what if the strings connected? What would happen? Would Potter finally be able to see it? And would it confirm the part of the myth Draco was too afraid to confront?
"Okay…  Well, that's done," he whispered. Then Draco straightened his jacket and lifted his chin, trying to hold on to some idea of pride after that embarrassing display. He was proud of himself for doing this, but he was also ready to throw up from the nerves. The flame in his chest was burning enough to hurt, especially when Potter didn't say anything.
“Much better.”
But he didn't.
He had never heard his name so much in such a short amount of time and it was making him ridiculously turned out. It was like Draco Malfoy, bdsm escort and former Death Eater, was saying it as if he just liked the sound of it in his own mouth. And Harry had to admit, he liked the sound of it in Draco’s mouth too.
"Do you know the spells to get me stretched and lubed up?"
Harry gasped for air as Malfoy pulled out completely, but kept the head pressed against Harry’s open and panting mouth. “I’m Sir’s personal cock sucker. I was made to suck you off.”
Harry chuckled, embarrassed. “Yeah, that.”
Tomorrow would be another day and Harry would continue on with the normal routine of things.
“Thank you, Sir.”
Malfoy stepped closer, pressing Harry’s face against his crotch.
MInutes passed of Malfoy striking him with the flogger, enough to sting but nothing that hurt. The room was filled with swishing and moaning. Harry let his head hang, unable to concentrate on keeping it up. He could feel tears burn at his eyes and soak into the silk blindfold. He wasn’t sure if they were tears from the overwhelming pleasure or from the feeling of letting someone take control of him with his pleasure in mind. Malfoy was using him for Harry’s pleasure. It wasn’t for Malfoy’s benefit. It was Harry’s. Harry had always wanted to feel like he would get something out of working for others. He was feeling it now.
“I’m surprised, really,” Malfoy said, breaking the silence. But he never looked away. All playfulness was gone and what remained was that smouldering smoke look to his eyes. Harry was mesmerized by it. It had to be the post-orgasm bliss for sure. Because he couldn’t be actually attracted to this man after everything. But there he was, beautiful in his imperfections. Pointy nose, ego, and snark. Malfoy’s eyes looked over Harry’s face before he continued. “I honestly never thought you of all people would have some interest in bdsm. And if I had to put you somewhere it would have been as a dom. You always seemed in control and in charge even when the walls were literally falling around you.”
Malfoy took his length and pumped it a few times, slow and teasing, before rubbing the head against Harry’s lower lips. “Open,” he ordered and Harry compiled without a second thought. “Suck me off, Harry. Be a very good boy and try to make me cum.”
All Harry craved was the prize.
They glared at each other for a few tense seconds before Harry’s face felt like it was on fire in embarrassment. “Bloody hell,” he mumbled, placing his head in his hands. “What a fucking nightmare.”
The next hit was stronger, not enough to hurt, but just the right bite. He knew he’d have the most delicious red marks on his body; he was sure he’d have a difficult time explaining if anyone saw them.
Harry’s face warmed at the flash of memories from just moments ago. He could still feel the ache in his arms and the rasp in his throat from blowing Malfoy. And his ass was sure to be pink from the flogger. He almost moaned at the memory.
Harry wasn't sure, euphoria fogging up his mind, but he thought he gulped out a breathy thanks.
“Oh I never said a saint, Malfoy. In fact, I think the saints would cry at the mere association.”
“Draco!” Pansy falls to her knees in the snow, strands of dark hair stuck to her face like she’d just been running.
“I’ll bet,” Draco says, his voice heavy with meaning. “I bet you’ll enjoy it even more Potter, if you
Parvati snorts. “Not my area of expertise, but if we’re going to leave him here for three days, I’d rather get on with it. Hangingbone won’t miss him after what happened last time.”
He turns his head and Potter is shaking his, brows furrowed. His expression looks lost. “No, I— I think he might be right?” He looks at Weasley and it’s a bit panicked. “I should be glad that Malfoy was wrong but I feel disappointed?” Potter’s eyes meet his and linger. Draco has to pull his gaze away first.
"Mm?" Harry slides a warm hand under Draco's pajama top to idly run it over his flank.
“Yes but, Potter— ” Draco starts. This isn’t going how he’d planned. Not that he’d really planned it at all. He’s still surprised he hasn’t been thrown out yet, or enduring hex after hex.
"I'm aware," Draco snarls. "But that still doesn't explain why Harry Potter’s been the guest of honor at every supper I've attended, despite your assurance that the guests are chosen at random! You had to know something like this would happen eventually!"
Draco lifts his chin, drawing a deep breath through his nostrils in an attempt to steady himself.
Potter sighs. “Will it get you to go away?”
Draco startles. He hadn’t brought it up on purpose, but that was the reality of his situation. Being allowed back into Hogwarts to finish his education had been a hard won fight, harder still with the condition that he was to stay in line under Headmistress McGongall’s careful supervision. Draco assumed that was why Potter had begun following him around the castle again, taking it upon himself to make Draco his special assignment.
"Now. The last dinner. Sixth year," he adds with emphasis. "It wouldn’t surprise me if it’s a habit you can’t seem to break."
Potter doesn’t look like he should be forcing revision in the library, much less standing on two feet. There are dark smudges under his eyes and his face looks wan. The twinge of sympathy it elicits in Draco is completely unwelcome.
Sliding to his knees, Harry tugs down the silky material of Draco's pajamas and Draco kicks them aside. Harry runs his hands over the skin of Draco's thighs, the slight callouses making Draco shiver, even as heat gathers in his gut. Harry parts his lips, takes Draco's prick into his mouth. Draco curls a hand in his hair, tightening his fingers when Harry hums with approval.
“They’re all better looking than you,” Draco says quickly. “I obviously settled.”
Draco spins to gape at Potter. “What is your problem?!”
Pansy nods, her lips mischievous. “Practically tied at the waist.” She shakes her head. “The hip? Whatever.”
Draco hitches his shoulder. "Was he there? I hardly noticed."
"Stop hogging Granger's attention and come join us. And bring a seltzer for Draco won't you?"
Above their heads, Peeves continues to rattle his chains, cackling one last time before swooping through the opens doors to take his mischief elsewhere.
“Piss off,” say Blaise. There’s no winsome smile now, just teeth. “I suppose you think that’s funny.”
Draco nods. There's no use in pretending he'd say no. "Alright."
"Oh, yes," Lovegood nods. "Squill & Spoon has become quite popular. Daddy publishes an advertisement every month in
“Yeah?” Draco shuts his eyes tight, feels the way the arousal coils low in his belly, tension building as he arches his back before it snaps, carrying him over the edge in an intense wave of pleasure.
Abernathy escorts Draco into London the next Saturday. Squill & Spoon has chosen another muggle location to host their dinner, far more opulent than the last: a bank. Entering the building, a large chandelier gleams overhead and his dress shoes sink pleasantly into the plush red carpet. The familiarity of it all has a calming effect on Draco, until he’s led by Karrey the house elf to the place where the vaults are kept. There are no goblins, no carts. Just a large steel door with a circular latch that any idiot capable of a decent Alohomora! could unlock. It’s terribly disappointing, a fact he shares with Karrey as he opens the safe to reveal access to another room.
However, can’t stay in the dungeons right now. It’s not because Blaise is giving him the cold shoulder — he’s dealt with that before, and Pansy and Theo have been very good about keeping him company, doing their best to ignore his occasional giggles or his curtness when he grows impatient with them. He’ll have to make it up to them this holiday for sure. Neither of them celebrate Christmas but love presents, and he makes a note to order something by owl mail, as he’s hesitant to attempt Hogsmeade again.
"Don't you know it's rude to answer a question with a question?" Draco snaps.
"Is this a... muggle grocery store?"
Lately it felt like his sleepless nights, his errant magic, the stress of the upcoming holidays, and his unbidden thoughts of Potter were all compounding to form some strange miasma that Draco was blindly wandering through, but couldn’t find his way out of.
"And your medal will be sent via owl post. Though I suppose it says something if you've managed to escape being poisoned... so far."
He can write to his mother tomorrow.
It had been a very, very long night. They would be leaving for holidays the following morning. With the promise that she would talk to the Ministry on Draco’s behalf, and have supper sent up to them once they were ready for bed, McGonagall finally sent them off, rubbing at her temples.
And yes, maybe Draco’s anger makes him feel a little reckless. There’d been no sign of Potter when Draco’d finished being examined and he’s hungry to finish what the Chosen One started.
Apparently she doesn’t know what to say to that, and he doesn’t expect a response.
"And what team do you go for? I suppose the Wasps are more your speed."
With the door closed, Draco moves to stand with Potter on the threshold. There are four king sized four poster beds, each with their velvet hangings drawn back and the sheets clean and pressed. He, Blaise, Theo, and Greg had been the only boys who’d chosen to come back after the war, but mid-way through the first part of term, Greg had buckled under the pressure. The loss of Crabbe had hit him especially hard, and unlike Draco, who’d had a year to make some sort of peace with it during the castle’s reconstruction, the wounds for Greg were still fresh and bleeding.
Only once he’s there, he realizes he’s left his visitor’s badge on Opal’s desk. It’s a failed attempt to purchase his much needed cup of earl gray. The witch at the cart refuses to sell him anything without clearance.
“Better watch out, then,” Harry says as he guides Draco’s mouth to his own. “I think we’re all of the above.”
Harry's mouth is a thin line. "Cho works there."
"Yes, someone please talk about anything, there’s bound to be much more interesting topics of conversation than whether Potter will have to spend one night without a warm body in his bed." Draco sniffs, doing his best to look bored as he gives the crazy straw a try. It takes a bit of effort and he has to inhale for much longer than seems convenient before the drink makes its way to his mouth and down his throat. It's nice. Very citrusy.
Harry's hand on his body has stopped moving. It feels heavy on Draco's side, the digits of Harry's hand molding themselves to his skin as his grip tightens ever so slightly. "I wanted to." His voice is thick. Harry coughs to clear it. "I started so many times. Then I told myself it we were ever going to apologize to each other -- really apologize -- we'd have to do it in person."
“We’ll still be able to perform it, we just won’t always be able to control it,” Draco agrees.
The blue-haired reception-witch doesn’t look up when Draco reaches her desk. He clears his throat. He watches her shuffle through some papers and sharpen a quill. When she continues to ignore him, he casually tips the inkwell sitting precariously on the edge of her desk, spilling its contents across the official-looking document she’s currently reading. Her head snaps up.
filling out paperwork. And while he'd never be as calm as Harry during a crisis, in the year and a half since they'd first been assigned to each other, he'd become someone Harry could rely on.
“S’not bad,” Draco laughs quietly, licking along his digits. He falls onto his back next to Potter with a sigh. He’s so hard, he could probably hammer nails with his cock at this point.
"Too true," she say quickly, fluttering her lashes. Tossing her long, dark hair over her shoulder, Romilda's gaze drifts to Draco. "Speaking of which, how do, Malfoy? Harry’s being here isn’t much of a surprise but I can’t say the same for you." She pauses for effect. "I’d heard you were laying low for the time being."
” Draco says, turning away to walk the length of the aisle. “Rebelling against the dangers of regular sleep or defending your right to insomnia?”
Potter appears from somewhere at the other end of the aisle. It's only years of failed attempts to bring him down a peg or two, that makes him woefully familiar with Potter's dumb cloak and keeps Draco from being startled. At least outwardly. His heart, on the other hand, has leapt into his throat and is doing somersaults.
“Hope Hangingbone.” She points to herself, with a chuckle. “Faith, Hope, and
“There’s no need to shout, dear,” The Fat Lady scolds as she swings forward to let him in. Draco doesn’t have the time to explain that it’s nerves, that normally he’s very well-mannered when he’s not scared out of his wits or under the thrall of a genocidal madman and his own childish delusions of grandeur. Unlike the last time Draco was here, the Gryffindor common room is a riot of activity and almost every head swivels to look at him as he crosses into their territory.
“Quite perceptive for a Gryffindor.”
He angles himself towards Potter and their knees brush under the table. They both jump and Draco’s ears grow hot. "As this is our first meals as not enemies," he blurts out, "I'll ask that you not to do anything crass. Like molesting me under the table. Or folding your food in order to eat when there's perfectly good silverware."
"I think you do."
“Of course.” Draco gathers his things, ignoring the way Potter tries to catch his eye. It’s not until he tries to fall into step behind them that not Draco, but Hangingbone takes it upon herself to dismiss him. “I’d really like to speak to Malfoy privately, Mr. Potter. You should finish your packing. Have your trucks ready for the train.”
They were finally at the counter. Weasley leans past his shoulder to get a closer look at the items in the display, practically drooling onto Draco's pristine robes in the process. Draco bristles, stepping aside and leaving room for Weasley in the line. "Would you like to go first? You're practically foaming at the mouth."
Despite her understanding and her warnings, there’s nothing that really prepares them for the reaction of their friends.
Draco gave him a sharp look. “And what, I'm supposed to offer some formal apology? She sent us
"No, I–" Draco clears his throat. "I just– what is this?" He gestures to the loopy plastic thing.
“When we get back.” Draco tells himself he needs time to collect himself, but he’s pretty sure he’s procrastinating. “Since when do you take Narcissa Malfoy’s best interests into consideration?”
Draco swallows hard. "I don’t know what I want."
"I'm not the one who plans the table settings!" Headland stops frantically flipping through his planner to look up. "Wait. Something like what? What happened, Draco?"
“Harry, what’s he talking about?” Weasley still looks traumatized and the talk of figuratively getting off isn’t helping.
say that everyone would have a turn. I believe there’s still a few of your classmates who haven’t had a chance. Mr. Potter, for instance.”
“I’m allowed to have other people who care about me.”
"I'd like to speak for myself, if I may." Harry says roughly, the drink in his hand heavy with condensation. "And I don't think it's really anyone's business since I'm not seeing anyone right now. Can we stop talking about my love life now? Please?"
“When we were repairing the castle, after I first became friends with—”
His lips form a single word and Draco squints. “What?”
“I suppose we could test your mattress.”
Potter sits in one of the high-backed leather chairs, looking distinctly uncomfortable as the upholstery remains stiff and unyielding under his clenched fingers, squeaking every time he shifts his weight. Draco gives him time to look around, to take in the tall Christmas tree with its silver baubles and fireflies (the dungeons are too damp for fairies), the festive boughs of evergreen that cover almost every surface, dotted with berries and glittering pinecones, and the figurines of ghosts: Christmas Past, Present, and Future, placed above the mantle. Below, several stockings hang. Blaise’s
Weasley scowls and takes them without saying thank you, but that’s to be expected. He doesn’t expect everyone to have the manners he does.
The gift wrapping party goes on into the afternoon and the early part of the evening. Afterwards Weasley ditches his chess set for the new miniature Quidditch game his brother, the Dragon Keeper if Draco remembers correctly, and even Granger joins them, watching from the side as they break into two teams for a series of matches. Someone brings fresh pumpkin pasties and biscuits up from the kitchens, and the crackle of the fire fills the room with a profound warmth that penetrates the heart, sinking bone deep.
“The rules are simple, it doesn’t matter if you say, stop or no or beg me to stop. The only way to stop the scene is by using your safeword or by saying red. Is that understood?”
Harry didn't know how to answer that, didn't think he was supposed to answer the question at all. But it made him blush, which was amazing considering how hot his face was already. What really made him feel good was hearing Malfoy call him Potter, lost in pleasure.
“Fool.”
Harry nodded, throat dry and pants extremely restraining. Damn he should have stripped instead of staying in those jeans and t-shirt.
It was trust and love.
Every breath he took felt like it was counted while he waited. His left leg bounced, anxiously. He had plenty of patience, and yet in this situation, Draco was ready to tear his hair out because he
The first hit on his shoulder blade made him jolt, but it didn’t hurt. It was different though. Not at all what he imagined. Like soft thuds instead of stings.
Finally.
The receptionist took his clipboard, still with the sweet smile, and handed him a couple of papers, stapled together in the corner. “Read through these. They’re the safety tips and rules we give to all of our new clients. I’ll be right back to lead you to your room, I’m just going to send these up to Miss D so she can pick the escort for you.”
It seemed that Potter didn't see the string still, but he had definitely felt something. Draco was sure Potter probably thought Draco did something suspicious, like a weird version of a curse, but that was okay. Draco knew the truth.
Malfoy’s heels clicked as he began to move again. He sauntered back around to Harry’s head. Warm hands, somehow gentle and strong at the same time, lifted Harry’s head up and removed the blindfold completely. After so long with his eyes covered, he had to squint for a few seconds to get used to light again. His glasses were placed back on his face and Malfoy’s face came back into view. It was all angles and points framed by soft strands of blond hair. His eyes were looking down at him again, just like earlier. It made Harry’s heart slam into his rib cage.
“Thank your sir for taking his time, Harry.”
Harry looked at him for a long time, watching the blond stare up at the whitewash ceiling, periodically taking a drink. Harry watched the emotions cross those alcohol hazed eyes and wondered what he was thinking about.
He swore his entire body was tense trying not to cum as he slowly- oh so slowly- slid into Malfoy's hot wet hole. Harry knew there was life beyond the veil but he was bloody sure it would never feel as good as being inside Draco Malfoy.
With the flogging, Harry’s erection had wavered. He was still aroused, but the easy back and forth of the falls on his skin was relaxing. His oncoming orgasm had backed off, but his body still felt hot and stretched.
Give him what he needed.
He had a purpose- to give his dom pleasure.
No more feeling alone and empty with no purpose.
"Yes sir."
Malfoy's lips spread into a pleased smile that did that funny little thing to Harry's stomach again. "Your smile is nice," Harry said, not thinking first. His brain was so foggy. He just had need. He just had a purpose at that moment and that is to make Draco Malfoy continue to feel good. And then maybe he'll be able to cum. Maybe he'll be able to witness that smile some more.
“Yes what?”
“Green.”
“Harry, I’m going to tie you to the bench. I’m going to blindfold you and use some toys and weapons on you. I want to get you begging for me to let you cum, but you won’t cum until I say so. You got that, Harry?”
But he had finally taken Draco’s hand for the seemingly innocent handshake and both men gave small relieved sounding gasps the second their hands joined together.
A whine grew in his throat but it died when he saw Draco bend over to get something from the back of the armoire. “Fuck,” he whispered. Drool slicked his chin and he couldn’t even wipe it off.
More drool ran down Harry’s chin as he listened to Malfoy talk. His cock ached to be touched. He wanted to cum so bad and he hadn’t even done anything fun yet. The anticipation was so much more intense than he had imagined. He was shaking in need already. Not being able to see only heightened every emotion.
"Er- right. Um..." Harry gave an awkward smile and cleared his throat. "I'm glad. I guess."
“I’m sorry,” he whispered, broken.
His eyes watered and his bottom lip trembled, hands reaching to feel the scars.
“Such a big cock. I hope you know how to use it, Harry. I would sure be disappointed if the cock doesn’t live up to expectations. I’d be lying if I said I never wondered if you’d fuck like a selfless Gryffindor. At least, I hope so. I really am the only one allowed to be selfish in this room, you know.”
When he arrived in defense that morning, he tried his damnedest to not look at Potter or even acknowledge he was alive.  He didn’t know what this morning meant but he certainly was not going to dive into that mess. The best way to keep himself from thinking about it was to ignore the person he did not want to think about. As Potter entered the classroom almost late for the class, he tried his damn hardest to not look at him but his body seemed to think quite the opposite and his eyes followed him across the classroom.  What could be so great about Potter anyways? His hair was always a mess and didn’t even look like he tried to brush it, sure it looked messy in the I don’t care what it looks like but its still attractive way, but that was besides the point. His robes where always disheveled and his tie almost never properly done up, but it did make him look relaxed and more attractive that way. Did he think Potter was attractive? The realization felt like a punch to the gut. The rest of the class he refused to look at Potter. After defense was over Draco packed his books up and break neck speed and was the first one out of the class basically running to his next class, which thank merlin, Potter was not in.
Draco joined him a minute later. He noticed Potter was bent over working on the lower shelves. He had a nice arse Draco noticed. What the fuck was that Draco started as the thought crossed his mind since when had he admired Potters arse? He moved around potter and started to clean the top shelves.  After a while Potter had slowly moved his way over, while cleaning, to Draco and his head was about waist height. “In a bit of a compromising situation there aren’t you Potter” Draco said trying to get a reaction out of him. Potter looked up and blushed furiously when he realized where his head was in relation to Draco’s body and quickly stood up, hitting his head on one of the shelves, on his way up. “Shit” he said rubbing the back of his head where he had hit it. Draco chuckled and turned back to what he was doing. A while later as he was finishing up his part of the cupboard out of the corner of his eye, he saw Potter looking at his arse. Draco took what he had in his hand and bent down and put it on a lower shelf angling his arse towards Potter and chuckled to himself when he saw Potter turn red and quickly look away. As he straightened, he took a jar of pickled pigs feet from the shelf he was working on and crossed the small space so that he was right behind potter and reached over him, using their height difference to his advantage, and closed Potter in putting the jar on the top shelf right about Potter. “What the hell Malfoy!” Potter exclaimed and Draco had to bite back a smile “what Potter just doing what we were told to do” he said arching his eyebrow at Potter. Potter blushed and glared at Draco and then took his things and left the store room and classroom. Draco was chuckling to himself before his brain had questioned why he had been flirting with Potter. Draco stopped chuckling and furrowed his brow; he had simply done it to get a rise out of Potter like he always did. He couldn’t have been flirting with Potter because that would mean he fancied Potter in someway and that was not possible. Draco bent down and picked up his book bag and made his way back to the common room trying hard to ignore his thoughts about the motives of his messing with Potter.
Chapter 1
year potion even you shouldn’t be able to fuck it up that bad” Malfoy went on. Harry started stirring the potion while adding the measured powdered unicorn horn “Bloody hell Potter stir clockwise 4 time not counter clockwise are you trying to make it explode?” Malfoy sneered at him. Harry glared at him and corrected his stirring but forgot to add the powdered porcupine quills so now their potion wasn’t the light turquoise blue but instead a deep navy. “for the love of the gods Potter move over!” Malfoy said while shoving him to the side while adding the powdered porcupine quills and stirring clockwise twice and counter clockwise four times until their potion turned the light turquoise colour it was supposed to be. “you are a bloody menace in potions” he said while double checking that Harry had not screwed up their potion to much. “Shut up Malfoy” Harry growled feeling a pit of anger settle in his stomach. “What cant handle not being praise for being Perfect Potter?” “oh Saint Potter cant do anything wrong because he’s just so damn special” Malfoy went on sneering at him. Before Harry’s head had time to catch up with his body Harry had drawn his wand on Malfoy pointing it right at his heart. “MISTER POTTER! MISTER MALFOY!” Slughorns voice boomed across the room. “That will be detention for the both of you. You will report to this classroom at 7 sharp and will be cleaning out the store cupboards.” During the whole thing Harry had not noticed that Malfoy had also raised his wand at him as well. Harry put his wand back in his robe shame flaring in his stomach. He peaked a look over to Malfoy who looked like he had been hit by a bludger and turned to glare at him before emptying their potion into vials to be marked and exiting the room without even turning back to look at Harry.
Despite being a nice day Harry still couldn’t help but feel numb. Standing on the platform with everyone bustling around didn’t bring the same joy as it used to. “Hey mate you are going to miss the train!” Ron was tugging him towards a car. Ron and Hermione were coming back this year too but since they had become a couple Harry had started to feel a little like a third wheel. They found a compartment with Neville, Luna, and Ginny and sat down. Things with Ginny had ended better than he thought it would. After the battle they had all gone back to the burrow but despite quite a few snogging sessions Harry just couldn’t help but feel like it wasn’t the right to be with Ginny. When he had decided to talk to her about it she understood and told him that she had started feeling the same way and they had parted ways fairly amicably. He gave Ginny a small smile as he slid into the compartment and she gave him a brilliant smile back. He knew that there would be other returning eighth years like Hermione, Ron, Neville, and himself but he wasn’t sure who else had been invited back. Ginny and Luna were seventh years so they were required to come back and they would be having classes together as there were only ten eighth years coming back.
Harry couldn’t help but remember noticing how much more weight Malfoy had lost when he appeared at his trial. His hair had grown a couple more inches and was just at chin length. It was limp and lanky and looked as though it hadn’t been washed in a while. Harry had surprised himself by wanting to testify on Malfoys behalf. Even though Malfoy had been a tremendous git in school he had no more choice in his part in the war than Harry had. Harry Had gone in and gave his testimony that Malfoy had only been a minor when he was forced to take the mark and did the things he did just to survive the maniacal dark wizard he was living in the same house with at the time. After his testimony he hadn’t stuck around to hear their verdict and since he refused to read the Daily Prophet anymore he hadn’t know the outcome of his trial he had hoped that he would get off easier than the proposed 10 years in Azkaban. “whether he has changed or not I don’t really wan to have to be stuck with him all year.” Harry said over Ron and Hermione’s bickering. Hermione looked at Harry sympathy written all over her face “We should be friendly to him, he’s probably lonely now most of his friends and family are gone now.” She said giving everyone her signature Hermione look. Everyone knew better than to argue with her so the compartment fell silent. Hermione turned back to the book she was reading and Neville and Ron started a game of exploding snaps breaking the silence that had fallen on their compartment. “Do you think you will still be housed in Gryffindor tower this year?” Ginny asked him. “I’m not sure...” Harry murmured. He had just assumed that they would be staying in their house dormitories and hadn’t really gave it much thought. Now that Ginny had brought it up he wondered where the eighth years would be housed, there had never been an eighth year in Hogwarts history, so this was all new territory for them and the school. The Train was starting to pull into Hogsmeade station when he noticed that it had started to rain. Great, he thought, just the way to start out the year.
Short chapter for today! they will start getting longer now that the scene has been more or less set! Thanks for reading!
Chapter 8
When they got back from dinner Ron and Hermione went to the couch in front of the fire place and curled up together. Harry feeling awkward decided that he would turn in early for the night because he was feeling exhausted and really didn’t have the energy to watch them and feel like a third wheel the rest of the night. After a quick good night to his friends he returned to his room and changed into a comfortable pair of sweats and sat down in the chair in his room with his potions book determined to not fuck up the next potion in class with Malfoy. After a while of trying to memorize the exact steps of the potion they would be making next class Harry could feel his eyes begging to stop reading. He put his book down and rubbed his sore and dry eyes. He decided that he would shower this evening instead of the morning so that he could have a little extra time to sleep in.
Chapter 10
Harry had woken up with a start at that point covered in a cold sweat with the roar of fiendfyre still in his ears and the smell of smoke still threatening to choke him. Harry fumbled for his wand and cast a
He stood up and cautiously approached the witch not knowing how her friends would react to him coming to her. As he approached, he saw that her and Weasley seemed to be in a heated discussion, he slowed his steps to give them more time before he got to her desk. As he arrived at her desk Weasley got up, red in the face, and told him that he “better not do anything to her” and stalked off to his assigned partner. “Hello.” He said tentatively as he took the seat Weasley had just vacated.  “Hello.” She said a small voice. “I want to apologize.” Draco said grabbing her attention. “I was wrong. My beliefs were wrong and they hurt you and so many others. I can’t apologize enough for all the harm I have caused you or that my family has caused you. I will spend the rest of my life trying to right the wrongs I have caused. I know this may seem like the wrong time to apologize but I wasn’t sure when I would get another chance to be one on one so I could apologize properly. I had a lot of time to think over the summer and I realized that everything I believed in was utter bullshit. I’m sorry for calling you that disgusting name and I’m sincerely sorry about what my deranged aunt did to you in the manor. I know an apology won’t heal the wounds but it’s a start and I want to start proving to everyone that I’m not my father and that I don’t carry his beliefs anymore. Again, I am sincerely sorry for everything.” He finished. She looked at him for a moment, he felt like she was trying to look into his soul to see if he was telling the truth, and in that moment, he let all of his walls down so that she could see the sincerity in his words. She nodded and turned back to the page she was writing on before his sudden word vomit. After a moment she looked up and him “Thank you for apologizing, what your aunt did to me was not your fault but thank you for apologizing for it. I can see that you have tried to change this year even though you still like to rile Harry up.” At that mention of him trying to rile Potter up he felt a blush creep up his neck. “I forgive you Draco and I do truly think you are trying to be better.” Her honesty and willingness to forgive him threw him for a moment “You forgive me?” He whispered. “Yes, I don’t want to carry around hate anymore, I’ve had enough of that for a life time.” She said looking at him and giving him a small smile. “Thank you. Me either.” He said stunned at how quickly she forgave him. “Now, what do you thin would be a good idea for this project?” she said getting back to the task at hand. He sat for a minute thinking about how best he could give back to the magical world. After a couple of minutes, he turned to Hermione, “what about a program that helps Muggleborns and their parents when they first start showing signs of magic instead of the current system that waits until the child is 11?” He said bit worried about what she would think about such an idea coming from a former death eater. “That’s brilliant Draco!” She said and pulled out a fresh piece of parchment and started writing down ideas about how they could execute the idea. “I know that it was hard to get as caught up as I could in the month between getting my letter and actually coming to Hogwarts. It would have really helped me and my family if we had had more warning and time to get used to, and integrated into the magical community.” She said tapping the end of her quill against her lip. “we could start with a proposal to dedicate a department within the ministry to finding and incorporating muggleborn families into the community at the first signs of magic.” Draco said. “That’s a great idea! Kind of like magical social workers.” She said. “We could modify the trace charm so that it alerts the department when the first signs of magic appear in a muggleborn child and then they could send out a member of the department to go and speak to the family and start to slowly integrate them into wizarding society.” He said now that his brain had finally had a chance to catch up to hers.  They spent the rest of the period discussing the best ways to help families integrate with the wizarding world with the least amount of emotional damage. Once the bell rang Hermione started packing up, “This was really productive Draco. Your idea is absolutely brilliant!”  she said while walking to the door. Once at the door she met Weasley and Potter and they basically dragged her out of the room. “Bye Draco!” she said as she was whisked out of the classroom by her best friends.
Harry noticed Malfoy leave the great hall with Theo. “Why do you keep watching Malfoy?” Ron said with a mouthful of eggs. “I am not.” He said glaring at Ron. “Sure you aren’t.” He scoffed and turned back to his plate. “you do tend to stare at him whenever you and him are in a room together Harry.” Hermione said looking at him with a slightly amused look. “Yeah its like you fancy him or something.” Ron chuckled. “I do not!” Harry practically half yelled to the entire hall. He could feel a blush creeping up his neck and didn’t know why it was happening which irritated him even more. “Calm down I was only joking mate.” Ron said looking suspiciously at him. Thankfully at that moment grabbed them by their collars and started to drag them out of the great hall telling them they were going to be late for their first defence lesson.
That night Harry tossed and turned with his usual nightmares but this time they were a little different.  The fiendfyre had been right on his tail and he could still smell the smoke threatening to suffocate him. He found the brooms and hopped on racing for his life to get out of there when a patch of blonde hair had caught his attention and his screams filled the air. He turned around and made a bee-line for that blonde hair. Grabbing him and swinging his onto his broom he felt his terrified grip tighten around his waist. “can’t you go faster Potter?” he had heard his terrified voice in his ear over the roar of the fire. At that moment he could feel the heat licking at his heels and suddenly Malfoy was sliding off the broom. “POTTER!” he could hear his terrified screams and he slide farther and father down the broom. Harry reached a hand back to try to pull him back but at that moment Malfoy lost his grip and fell off the back of the broom and into the raging fire bellow.
The common room was decorated in neutral colours with the Hogwarts crest here and there. There were a few tables towards the back of the common room for studying and a large fireplace at the front with a couch and a couple of comfy looking chairs on either side. It wasn’t huge but a comfy size enough for the ten of them to not step on each others toe’s. There was a hallway at the back with 5 doors on one side and 5 doors on the other. Everyone wandered towards the hallway Theo was the first one in the hallway and found the door with his name on it. He opened the door and walked into his room everyone watching him to see what would happen. Instantly the room transformed in front of him. His bedspread turned from grey to a silver with green curtains his pillow green with the Slytherin crest in the middle. The chair turned into a plush looking green upholstered chair. The room was basic with a four poster, nightstand, dresser, chair, and en-suite bathroom. Theo’s trunk was sitting at the end of his bed. Everyone stared for a moment and then went to find the door with their name on it. Harry walked down the hall and found his name on the second last door to the end. He opened his door and his room started to fill with colour, his bedspread was red with gold stripes running diagonal across it his curtains were red and gold. The chair in the room turned into an oversized red one like the ones he favoured in the Gryffindor common room. He was amazed and went and sat down on his bed reviling on how soft and comfortable it was. He wanted to lay down and just take a nap but he dragged himself off the bed to go and see what Ron and Hermione’s rooms looked like. He wondered who the last room belonged to and took a quick peak at the name on the door. Draco Malfoy, it read, great Harry thought it’ll be hard to ignore and avoid him living directly beside him. He turned away from Malfoys room and wandered down the hallway to find his friends.
Chapter 2
short chapter today with Dracos room!
Chapter 11
It had started to rain, Draco noticed, as the train was pulling into the station. The ride had been pretty uneventful he and Theo had talked being careful to mention the war and played a few games of exploding snaps. As he walked to the carriages with Theo and picked the one at the very back trying to avoid the rest of the school. He hopped in the carriage shaking the rain from his robes and casting a quick drying and warming spell on himself and Theo before taking a seat. They sat talking until someone hopped into the carriage with them their back turned to them muttering slightly under their breath. When they turned around Draco was stunned. Harry bloody Potter just starred at them looking like a fish with how he was opening and closing his mouth.
They were barely into the school year and he had already managed to insult Potter. So much for keeping your head down Draco thought to himself. He followed Theo into the great hall trying to ignore the glares and murmurs that followed him across the great hall. He and Theo sat down at the Slytherin table and everyone at the table seemed to shift down away from them. Draco understood the Malfoy name meant nothing anymore and that it was better for people not to be associated with it. He had no idea why Theo was still sitting with him, his family had stayed largely neutral in the war after leaving his notorious death eater father, Theodore Nott Sr, if anything Draco would drag down Theo and make it worse for him. “Earth to Draco!” Theo was looking at him with concern, “you need to get out of that head of yours mate.” “Theo why are you even associating with me? People will just think you are like me.” Draco said resigned. “Look Draco I am not going to let you go on a, woe is me I shouldn’t even be here, pity party so suck it up mate you are stuck with me.” Theo was glaring him down leaving little room for argument. Before Draco could respond Headmistress McGonagall called their attention to the front of the hall. “This year will be a little different from years past” She announced. “We have eighth years with us this year and we will be focusing less on house rivalry and more on house unity. We have all survived so much in these past years and its time to put our old rivalries behind us and start making new friendships and connections. Its time for us to come together as one instead of being divided into four separate houses. That is why this year we will be doing away with having everyone sit at house tables. Except for this feast and the end of year feast you will be encouraged to sit at other houses tables and make friends within the other houses. There will be no bullying tolerated towards any one and I expect everyone to treat everyone with respect.” She eyed down the hall finding no protest save for a few mumblings. “After the feast is finished, I ask that the eighth years stay behind for extra instruction for the new rules for their year. Now everyone enjoy the feast!” as she clapped her hands the tables began to fill with food. Draco wasn’t feeling very hungry used to not eating very much in the last to years. Theo began filling his plate with an assortment of foods and encouraged him to eat. Draco took a few bites but mostly just pushed his food around his plate. As the feast drew to a close McGonagall asked again for the eighth years to remain behind. Everyone started to file out of the great hall leaving only the ten of them behind.
When he entered Potter had his back to him and was looking at an ingredient that certainly didn’t belong in their potion. “You do know that, that isn’t one of our ingredients right Potter?” Draco said. Potter jumped and nearly spilled the ingredients he had already gathered all of the floor. “A little jumpy, are we?” Draco said with a small chuckle. “you know most people announce themselves when they come into the room so as not to startle the other person.” Potter said while glaring at him with those gorgeous green eyes and his face slightly flushed. Draco felt his eyes drifting down to his lips and starting to wonder what they would feel like on his. He shook his head a little startled by his thoughts “Well yes but I figured since you could hear my shoes on the floor you would have heard me enter the room.” he said sneering turning away, before his body unwillingly got closer to Potters, looking for the rest of their ingredients. He found two ingredients and found that the rest were over Potters head directly where Potter was now standing. Draco strode across the small space and came up behind potter and reach over his head effectively blocking him into the corner. “OIY” Potter said with a small shout as soon as he realized Draco was behind him. “Oh, I am sorry Potter am I to close for your liking?” Draco said with a mischievous smile.  Potter whirled around and glared at him. “You don’t think huh?” he said with an edge of something Draco couldn’t identify in his voice. Draco found himself mesmerized by those green eyes and by the time his brain caught up with what his body was doing he was leaning down. He was practically nose to nose with Potter. He could smell him, overwhelming his senses, he smelled faintly of woods and fresh grass and a warm summers day. “Am I to close now Potter? He found himself saying. Potter was spluttering incoherently not able to form a sentence by the sounds of it. Draco let out a warm chuckle and leaned in further and captured his lips with his own. For one heart stopping second Draco was afraid that he would shove him away and start pounding him to a pulp. But then he felt arms around his neck and realized that Potter was deepening their kiss. He put his hand on Potters hips and pulled their bodies together, feeling the faint impression of Harrys cock on his inner thigh. He groaned a little and parted their lips and slipped his tongue into Harrys mouth tasting the sweet taste of Harrys mouth. Harrys lips felt warm and slightly chapped on his own and it was driving him mad. He couldn’t believe He and Harry Potter were snogging! As if reading Draco’s thoughts Harry pulled away and looked at Draco with utter shock. He pulled his hands from Draco’s neck and whispered “fuck” before bolting past him and into the classroom grabbing his bag and running out the door. Draco sighed and picked up the spilled ingredients Harry had dropped and went and made their potion leaving a vial for Slughorn on his desk and sulked all the way up to his room.
Unfortunately, Monday reared its ugly head and Draco had to rethink a plan to minimize exposure to Potter because they were potions partners. What was even worse is they had a one on one detention tonight with Slughorn and he was no looking forward to that. When Draco arrived to the potion’s classroom, he found that potter was already there and was taking out his stuff. Draco marched over and took the seat beside him and started pulling out the materials he would need for their potion that day. “Hullo” He heard from beside him and every muscle in his body automatically tensed. Was Potter trying to start a conversation with him? “Hello” Draco said in his best attempt to convey that he would not be conversing with him past that point. “I promise I’ll try not to make something to blow up today” Potter said with a light chuckle. “I should hope not” He said trying to out his usual sneer into his words. He snuck a quick look at Potter and his cheeks were flushed a light pink and he was looking down at his notes and fidgeting with his quill. Why was Potter acting so strange around him? It made him feel uneasy and he was now dreading the days potion class even more.
He started to remember how Severus would give him a hard time during potions and regularly give him detention, he was smiling to himself as he entered the classroom. “what are you smirking about” snapped Potter bringing him out of his thoughts. “oh, just about how much better I am at potions than you are and don’t deserve to be here.” He quipped back. Potter just glared and him and turned back to the front waiting for Slughorn to enter the room. Slughorn finally decided to grace them with his presence ten minute later.  “Well boys, you know why you are here. You will be cleaning out the store cupboard over there until it is clean and then you may leave. I have a staff meeting I need to attend so I trust I can leave you two together without trying to kill one another?” He asked them with a slight glare in their direction. “Yes Professor” they said in unison and Slughorn nodded at them and left the room. “well we better get to it if we want to be out of here anytime soon” Potter said heading into the store room.
The rest of the week he managed to avoid Potter. He scheduled it so that he would wake up before him and finished breakfast right after he entered the great hall. He spent his lunches in the library, ducking down to the kitchens to grab a sandwich from the house elves before the start of his afternoon classes. For Dinner he would eat as fast as possible and then lock himself in his room for the rest of the night. Now that it was the weekend though he wasn’t sure how he was going to manage to avoid Potter all the time since they shared a common room and literally lived next to each other. Deciding his best bet was to go to the library as Potter almost never went there, unless dragged by Granger, and spend his weekend there hoping that most other 8
Despite his earlier feelings the class had gone smoothly and they had managed to brew a perfect potion. The rest of the day had passed rather uneventfully. As Draco walked down to the dungeons for his detention with Potter he felt a growing pit of unease in his stomach and by the time he reached the class it had turned to full on dread. He noticed, as he grabbed the door knob to the classroom, that his hands where shaking. He tried to pull on the mask of Malfoy determination with great effort and entered the class. “Ah Mr. Malfoy you are here! Mr. Potter is just in the store cupboard grabbing some ingredients for your potion. You may leave when your potion is complete and leave a vial of it on my desk before you leave. If you need my assistance, I will be down the hall in my office. Now get to it.” Slughorn gave him a pat on the shoulder as he left the classroom. Draco swallowed hard and put down his bag and went into the store cupboard to help Potter gather the ingredients.
When Draco had gotten down to the common room it was deserted except for Theo who had been waiting for him to go down to breakfast. “Good Morning.” Theo greeted him with a wide smile. Draco had tried to avoid him the night before after he got back to the common room from Potter and his detention the night before. “Morning.” He mumbled trying to avoid the onslaught of questions he knew Theo would soon start. “How was your detention with Potter?” Theo asked smirking at Draco. “It was fine.” Draco snapped back hoping the slight hostility would cause his friend to abandon ship on his line of questioning. “Just fine huh?” Theo said clearly ignoring Draco’s attempt at derailing this conversation. “I would figure it would be more than fine, considering you were stuck in a confined space with Potter for several hours, and you practically ran through the common room to your room when you got back. Ten minutes after him.” Theo said giving him a mischievous smirk. “Nothing happened. We cleaned and sorted potions ingredients and left.” He hissed back. “Mhm, I’m sure that exactly what happened.” Theo said while dodging Draco’s swing to his upper arm laughing. They had finally arrived at the great hall and sat down at the Slytherin table. Draco just finished filling his bowl with porridge when his eyes automatically scammed the Gryffindor table falling on a certain head of messy black hair, Draco noticed that he had dark circled under his eyes and he looked more tired than normal. What could be causing the golden boy to lose sleep. Surely the chosen one couldn’t have nightmare like he had. A stifled laugh caught his attention and he looked over at Theo whose face was strained from holding in his laughter. “Careful mate, you glare any harder at the golden trio they may catch fire.” He said while snickering. “Shut up I wasn’t glaring.” Draco said sniffing and tilting his chin in the signature Malfoy way. “Sure, you weren’t.” Theo said rolling his eyes at him. “I wonder who the new Defence professor?” is Draco said changing the subject away from the Golden Boy. “Not sure, all I know is she is a Muggleborn and her name is Melbourne.” Theo said looking up at the head table that housed the teachers. “That one there.”  Theo said pointing her out. She was small in stature with dark brown hair that she had pulled back into a plait down the middle of her back. She wasn’t much older than him if he had to guess, maybe 22-24. She looked unassuming but if he hazard a guess that she could take on almost anyone and win. “Great another person who hates me.” Draco said turning away from the head table. He grabbed his bag, stood up and started walking out of the great hall Theo trailing behind him. “Well we may as well get this over with.” He said to Theo when he had caught up. They both headed up to their first defence class together in relative silence.
“Yeah,” Malfoy said. “Okay. If you say so, Potter.”
“Tell me,” Malfoy started not even looking at the restrained man as he perused the toys. “You checked off penetration. Have you ever played with your asshole, Harry?”
"No," Harry whispered. The plug in his bum felt much bigger now that he was sitting and it was putting pressure on his rim.
“Harry, pet, if you feel like you’re going to cum then tell me,” Malfoy said, voice still low and hot. It was as if he could read it all over Harry’s body that he was ready to cum. “Don’t you dare cum until I let you, do you understand me?”
want Potter to die, but he couldn’t do anything. If he did anything to stop this, he’d lose more than he could ever bear. That’s if he made it, of course. Time felt so agonizingly slow, Draco was sure it had stopped. But at the same time it was flying by like the wind through his hair like those years ago, in what felt like a different life, Malfoy would chance Potter around the Quidditch field.
Harry slouched, thanking Merlin that she wasn’t going to ask.
Draco turned and started to walk off, trying very hard not to feel sorry for himself. He had been
“Color?” Malfoy asked, repeatedly slapping his bum with the leather falls.
But it made Draco angry for some reason. How could he have a string like Draco and not see it? It drove Draco mad. He wanted to smack Potter silly and ask him about the red strings only they seemed to have.
The pale blond turned back to Harry and smirked wickedly. "Salazar, you are sexy. Being an auror was a brilliant decision." Malfoy walked around the bench, fingers, feather soft and gentle, skimmed Harry's body as the dom walked. "Big biceps, big cock, big ego, but most importantly, big slut for me. Is that what you are, Harry? Are you my slut?"
He was doing that.
He was at liberty to relax and explore further the man he was sure he was but was never able to test out.
Harry tried to hold back his laughter but for some reason Malfoy’s casual comment felt like a relief.
Harry was up and out of his position on the couch and into Draco’s lap in a blink, surprising Draco. He only surprised him further when Harry leaned in and kissed the blond like his life depended on it. Because for all they have done the last 8 months, they had only kissed that first time, never again.
Malfoy looked down at Harry with clear amusement, grey eyes soft and lips smirking. "Show off."
Malfoy looked like an angel, a twisted angel with a smirk that could sway a saint, but still angelic as he came for the second time, spilling his semen onto Harry’s belly.
The motion was repeated evenly, hitting his shoulder blade each time. The repetition was calming, even when Malfoy switched to the other shoulder, the motion was predictable. Soon the hits alternated back and forth, hitting his shoulderings softly. Sometimes Malfoy would stop and tickle down his back with the leather falls, running down his skin and making Harry hum and gasp. Then the thuds would start again, back and forth.
He had never felt an orgasm that strong in his life.
A sigh of relief left the brunet’s lips when he didn’t hear an insult or a threat to sell pictures to the
His hips bucked up unconsciously and Malfoy groaned deep and low, whispering out “Yes, fuck yes. Again.”
Draco nodded. He looked at Potter’s green eyes for a second, then his lips, then the string, then back to Potter’s eyes. He decided it was now or never. The words came out in a bit of a rush even though Draco hadn’t meant it to sound like some schoolgirl crush. "Potter, look I'll be frank. I fancy you, for a while now, I suppose. And I'm sure you didn't ever think of me like that, but I can't deny it anymore. For some reason, that even I can’t fully understand, I actually like you, surprising as it is."
“And? Answer the other question or I won’t let you touch me again.”
one another?
Potter and friends looked at him like he had five heads, but Potter’s lips twitched like he was amused and that didn’t piss Draco off like it used to.
He only remembered the stupid string when his days became bleak in those months before the Astronomy Tower. But he couldn't think about it for too long. Not then. Not when he had a task to complete for the sake of his family’s survival.
Mostly because of how freeing it felt.
He decided to stay clothed while he knelt waiting, hands clasped in his lap, fiddling fingers like a nervous tick.
"Yes."
Harry nodded.
The string dragged behind him, still attaching him to Potter..
That thought alone made it hard to breathe.
Harry closed his eyes and took deep calming breaths.
that the string meant for them to be together, as slightly horrifying as that idea was at first. But maybe since Potter couldn't see it, it meant that this was one sided? That hurt more than not ever knowing. He shouldn’t have said anything. Feeling like a moron, he briskly walked away towards the floo. Hopefully, if he got away fast enough he could deny this ever happened.
He was going to finally feel the release he craved. He would finally be able to let go of every exhausting thing on his mind, if only for the hours he had paid for in advance.
“Of course, Potter,” Malfoy scoffed. “I’m not a miracle worker or a saint.”
“I fancied you back then, you know?” Draco finally asked. He slowly turned his head to lay on the back of the couch so he could look back at Harry. “After you spoke at my trial… . I heard what you said and how you defended me, saying I was just a scared child who was trying to save his family from a monster and Merlin, I… I felt like you were the only one who actually saw me. You saw that I couldn’t hurt a soul on my own when other people, even friends, thought that I was a horrible person for even pretending to follow
“Fine, take me out to dinner,” Draco added, a playful sneer on his face. “But you better dress up, Potter. I won’t be seen with you looking like you just woke up sleeping with the trolls.”
“Do you want me to find you someone else?”
That was how Harry felt in control- giving up control when only he deemed it okay.
Harry’s cheeks burned bright at the question. “Yes,”
He didn't want the string to be right. Draco didn't want to lose to a piece of mythological string, dammit.
He walked around the bench, admiring the shorter man restrained to the furniture. He stopped behind Harry, where the sub couldn’t see him.
“Merlin, I love you, you arse.”
A horrible mistake.
It took a few more minutes, but by the time that Harry's jaw was hurting and his balls were aching for his own release, Malfoy's breath began to hitch. He pulled out and held the base tightly.
Go. Please go.
Draco took the finger out and added more lube before sliding it back in with ease, Harry relaxed against the intrusion. He worked Harry open, crooking the finger, pumping it in and out, circling the rim before going back in as deep as it could go. Then he repeated every action again with 2 fingers, then 3. By the time he was done and he deemed Harry successfully stretched open and slick, Harry was a mess. Harry was sure he must have looked a sight. Sweat covered his body, drool wet the leather bench beneath his face, back arched and legs straining to not quiver. He was ridiculously aroused. He had never felt this good before and all that had happened was some fingering.
“That’s it.” Malfoy cooed and tugged gently at the hair in his fist. Harry swore he looked proud. It did a funny little thing to Harry’s stomach.”So sexy. This is the best you’ve ever looked in your entire life Harry, with my cock in your mouth. You were made to be my personal cock sucker, weren’t you? Tell me. Tell me who you are.”
Malfoy’s turn to chuckle. “You must be lucky, Potter. Not many wizards can claim they had the pleasure to ever come close.”
When they got to the defence classroom Harry noticed that everyone but them had arrived and that there were only 10 desks arranged in a semi circle and that the three closest to the door were the only ones left. As they sat down Harry took notice that Draco was sitting as far away, as the arrangement could allow, from the rest of the group. Before he could think more about it his attention was caught by the witch at the front trying to gather everyone’s attention. “We will be partnered up and doing projects about how best we could help the wizarding world after the war.” She said. After that she started listing off the partners, he heard his and Theos name being partnered together. He didn’t know much about Theo except he seemed to be Malfoys only friend at Hogwarts and that he was decently nice in the carriage ride up to the castle. Then he heard Hermione’s and Malfoys names together and a pit fell into the bottom of his stomach. He wasn’t sure why he was feeling that way, he thought it was probably just unease for his best friend, because t definitely wasn’t jealousy that she had gotten Malfoy as a partner because that was just ridiculous thought. He saw Hermione and Ron deep in conversation about the pairing and decided to head over to where Theo sat. “Hello.” He said as he walked up to Theo’s desk. He noticed that Theo was a decent looking bloke he had messy black hair just like himself but he noticed that he managed to tame it so it looked more like, I woke up this way, instead of I was chased by a flock of birds. He was lean but muscular and had deep brown eyes with flecks of gold. Harry started; did he think Theo was attractive? Before he could think more into it, Theo spoke. “Well Hello Harry.” Theo said with a small smirk like he was thinking of an inside joke that Harry wasn’t in on. “you can sit, I wont bite.” He said with a wink at him. Harry didn’t know what to say so he took a seat in the desk that Malfoy had just left a minute prior. “Well I’m not sure what we should do for the project I don’t really have any ideas.” Harry said while he noticed Theo looking him over. A blush started to creep up his neck and his cock began to harden at the sight. Harry shifted so that Theo wouldn’t notice his erection. Theo chuckled at him “Well I do have one idea so maybe we start there, if that okay with you Harry. I was thinking about doing a monument to honour those we lost in the war and do an unveiling on the first anniversary of the battle; I was thinking it could be at Hogwarts so that the new generations can learn from the generations before their mistakes.” He finished a little somberly. “Theo that a brilliant idea!” Harry said clapping him on the back and looking up just in time to catch Malfoy giving them a murderous glare before turning back to his discussion with Hermione. What the hell was that for Harry thought, he wasn’t even doing anything besides talking to Theo. Maybe Malfoy had a thing for Theo? But was Malfoy even gay? He always had pansy practically hanging off his neck before but he had never seen Malfoy actually return her attention. Come to think of it he had never really seen him doing anything with anyone in a romantic way before. At that moment the bell rang and he gathered his stuff saying a quick bye to Theo and met Ron at the door to the classroom.
She beckoned them all to the front. Draco slowly got up and walked to the front with Theo making sure to put a good distance between him and the Golden Trio. McGonagall looked over them and then explained what would be different for them this year. “Since Hogwarts has never had an eighth year before we have had to make special accommodations for your year. The ten of you will have your own dormitory with a common room, it will be located on the third floor you will also have your own rooms. There is no password needed as the entrance will recognize your magical signature all you need to do is place your hand on it.” “You will be given special privileges since you are all of legal age now. You will not have a curfew and can visit Hogsmeade whenever you would like outside of class time. Drunkenness will not be tolerated in front of the younger years. I expect you all to set an example for this school in house unity, I know all of you come from different backgrounds but you should all work together to complete this year and your N.E.W.T.S” she gave them all a stern look. “now off you go to your dormitories. Pip Pip!”
years would go to Hogsmead and leave the common room fairly empty. Thankfully this plan worked for the weekend and he didn’t catch of glimpse of that wild black hair unless in the great hall.
Another short one today from here on out they start to get longer.  Hope everyone is enjoying!
When he awoke that morning, he felt like utter shit. His body hurt from the awkward angle he had slept in that night and his mind was sluggish from the shit quality of sleep he had gotten. Great, he thought a perfect way to start out the day that had to start with a double potions class in the morning. He got up and dressed and met Ron and Hermione down in the common room. After a breakfast where he hadn’t eaten much, they made their way down to the dungeons for potions. Malfoy was already setting up for their potion as they walked in. Harry bid his friends a rather sulky farewell and stalked over to the desk where Malfoy was chopping the days potions ingredients. He threw his bag down on the floor by his desk and walked off to the store cupboard to fetch the rest of the ingredients they would need. “What’s got your knickers in a twist Potter?” a familiar voice said behind him. “what are you doing in here Malfoy?” He said his voice full of irritation. “I’m making sure you are grabbing the right ingredients so we don’t have a repeat of last class Potter.” Malfoy said as Harry turned around to face him. “I think I am quite capable of getting the right potions ingredients on my own thank you.” He said glaring into Malfoy’s silver-grey eyes. Malfoy leaned into Harry so their faces where mere centimetres apart “are you sure about that?” he said. Harry noticed that his breath smelled like mint and that his hair was not slicked back like it always had been but was falling into his eyes slightly. Noticing Harry’s lack of response Malfoy chuckled and took the ingredients out of his hands and walked out of the cupboard. Harry stood in the cupboard a moment his mind trying to catch up with what had just happened. Had Malfoy just flirted with him? His cock twitched at the thought and Harry let out an exasperated sigh and exited the cupboard. They worked in mostly silence for most of the period and they were just a few steps from brewing a perfect wit-sharpening potion Harry accidentally added the wrong ingredients first and stirred the potion the wring way right after causing their cauldron to erupt the contents all over himself and Malfoy. He looked at Malfoy and could see he was fuming “FOR FUCKSAKES POTTER WHERE IS YOUR HEAD?!” he practically screamed at him. At that point professor Slughorn had come over to their table and vanished the cauldron and exploded potion. “Dear me boys, I think you will have to remake this potion for me in detention for you to continue to stay in my class. Unfortunately, I will not be available for the rest of the week so you must come in next Monday for your detention.” He said while giving both boys disappointed looks. “yes professor” They said in unison before they started to pack up their materials. “You better not fuck this class up for me Potter.” Malfoy said in a scathing tone. Harry could feel the embarrassment creeping onto his cheeks and turned and left the classroom. They were only into the second week of school and Harry had managed to get detention both weeks. He sighed as he made his way to the common room to wait for Ron and Hermione before heading down to lunch in the great hall.
As he padded into the bathroom and he turned on the steaming water he couldn’t help feeling the tension in his shoulders and back. He slipped out of his sweats and got under the streaming water he couldn’t help but think it would be nice to have someone to massage the knots in his back out from time to time. When he had thought that his cock seemed to spring to life like it had not forgotten about being ignored during defense. He took his weeping cock into his hand and soaped it up so that there wouldn’t be to much friction and started stroking. He tried to think about his usual go to fantasy but he just couldn’t form it completely.  Instead his addled mind slipped into thinking about how Theo had looked at him in defence class and he felt his cock twitch in his hand and he quickened the pace. He stroked himself from tip to base alternating between agonizingly slow and hot and fast. As he was thinking about Theo and nearing his climax Theo’s features began to shift. He kept stroking edging himself closer and closer to release. Panting with one had on the shower wall steading himself the picture fully turned into a man with platinum blonde hair standing and smirking at him. With a small yelp he spilled himself all over the wall and watched as the water washed away the remains of his orgasm. Trying not to think about how his fantasy had ended he finished his shower and got ready for bed. Once under the covers of his bed he started to wonder if he wasn’t completely straight, after all his go to wanking fantasy had failed to work this time and he had gotten such an intense response out of the fantasy with Theo. But why had Theo turned into Malfoy at the end and why had that sent him over the edge so fast. Malfoy was a good-looking bloke he guessed but he was always such a prick to him and there was no way he could even like Malfoy, after all they hated each other. Feeing unsettled he resolved to think more about what wanking to Theo could possibly mean in the morning when he wasn’t so bloody tired. With that momentarily resolved Harry drifted off into a fitful sleep with flashed of messy black hair and platinum blonde tangled together.
She handed him a clipboard and a pen.
Because Draco too started to have many things on his mind. A mark itched at his arm too distracting for anything else, especially some stupid bit of string.
“Shove off, Potter.”
He had no clue how it got there and after several tries to remove it, he realized it wouldn't budge. When he asked Crabbe and Goyle about it, they had no idea what he was even talking about. They didn't see any red string hanging from his finger. The string didn’t get wet when he showered. It didn’t get dirty in the mud during Quidditch practice. He realized it didn’t even seem corporeal, like a spirit. Draco thought maybe it was some weird magical charm his mother put on him to keep track of him or something, but she hadn't said anything. It was the only theory he could come up with, unfortunately.
“You never tried to kill me,” Harry rasped, throat feeling dry again. “I recall you never being soulless enough to actually kill even when you were desperate.”
“Let me take care of you. I’m taking care of you. Let go of all the things that make you tired and angry. Look right here,” Malfoy continued, pointing to his eyes. “Focus on my eyes.”
“I never thought it’d be you,” Harry admitted. “I never imagined I’d be in bed with Draco Malfoy of all people.”
After almost a year of searching, he found it in a mythological book that a collector that specialized in muggle mythologies had gotten from his trip to the wizarding school in Japan.
The strangest part, though, was that someone else had one too.
It left him trembling and his body twitched with the aftershocks of sweet, sweet electrifying blss.
“I know.”
He gave Draco a strange look but there was no malice behind it. It made Malfoy’s stomach do flips.  “Get lost, Malfoy. I’ll owl you about our date.”
Green eyes widened at the pale upper body that came into view. Shiny light pink scar tissue crossed over Malfoy’s chest and abs, jagged and criss-crossing. But they were old scars. Ones Harry recognized immediately, feeling his mind wash with old memories of something he never wanted to remember.
He wished he could work his hands, but they were still tied up under the bench. It made the whole process harder to control. At the same time, though, not being able to touch, hold, or guide Malfoy with his hands just made Harry more determined to do a good job. He wanted to make Malfoy cum. He wanted to feel his Sir’s cum on his skin, like a prize for doing what was asked of him.
Harry swallowed the lump from his throat and nodded. “Yeah,” he said in a small voice.
In reality, Harry assumed that submitting to someone was the true power.
He sauntered over to the armoire and put Harry’s glasses down inside and safe. He tapped his chin with a finger and he tried to decide what to pick from the many contents inside.
There was a pause where the man standing behind him didn’t move or speak. It was like he had become shocked still.
"Well, Harry. You made me cum like a good boy, but that doesn't seem like enough for you is it?" Malfoy ran his hands up Harry's thighs, thumbs just ghosting against his straining erection. "Even after everything you didn't cum. But I bet you still want to cum, don't you? You won't be satisfied until you cum? Greedy and insatiable aren't you?"
Harry knelt back down, eyes still lowered, his mind going to that place where his defenses fell and the weight on his shoulders vanished. That special place. He could hear Malfoy’s breath hitch from across the room and it made him smile more.
Because for so long in his life he was used physically, mentally, and emotionally. Whether it be the Dursley’s who used him as a slave and locked him away like some dirty secret. Or perhaps Dumbledore who used him like a chess piece in the game of War. Or even the strangers who claim to be friends with him for their 15 minutes of fame.
After that they went on a few dates, spending most of the time talking. Sometimes about stupid things they had done as kids. Other times Malfoy apologized and wiped away frustrated tears as he admitted his worst memories and emotions. And a few times they even spent the night drinking and talking about what they want from the future and where they had imagined their life having ended up by now.
“So you became an escort?” Harry asked, incredulous.
But then a hand grabbed his and pulled him to a stop.
“Which is?”
“Hmm,” Draco fake wondered. “I guess that’ll do.”
Malfoy put his hand back around his cock and guided it past Harry’s saliva slick lips and Harry began to suck him off all over again. He watched Malfoy’s face the entire time, seeing the small ticks of his jaw, the crinkle around those smokey ash colored eyes, and the tongue that darted out sometimes to wet dry lips. He watched as Malfoy sighed and gasped like music to his ears.
But just as quickly as the string had disappeared, it appeared again, so bright red that the second he saw it, it eased his aching heart, putting it’s broken pieces back together.
“No. I think we’ve already gotten this far.”
“I see the ego is still a problem with you,” Harry snickered.
"Well, what are you waiting for?"
“Was it big? Are you secretly a cock slut, too? I bet you fuck yourself on your big dildo thinking about someone fucking you instead- hard and wet. Do you think about getting fucked, Harry?”
had sent him in the appointment confirmation email. “Please, Mistress.”
_________
Potter and the others stared at him with wide eyed and slack-jawed, standing shocked and silent.
The blond in heels and tight leather shorts and long sleeve leather shirt cringed then scowled. “You don’t need to scream, Potter. I’m as fucking shocked as you are.”
No one knew him here.
enemy?” Harry joked.
Harry’s face started to heat up again and he wanted to run. But Gryffindors don’t run in shame. “You pretty much just explained it. I’m… looking to give my control over to someone for a bit of time. And fucking happens to be something I’m good at,” he replied, mockingly, most likely starting a fight with Malfoy with his snark.
, Draco would wonder often. But he couldn't ask anyone for fear of looking absolutely insane. So he did his best to ignore it. Didn't even want to think about it.
