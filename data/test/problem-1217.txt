After the dust settled on the rubble and fallout of the Battle of Hogwarts, the remaining Death Eaters were rounded up and sent to Azkaban. For Draco Malfoy, this meant losing his father. His mother only narrowly escaped due to her choice to save Harry's life by lying to Voldemort's face about his persistent survival. Draco, being a minor, was not punished – at least, not by the Ministry of Magic. Instead, they decided to send his class of peers back to Hogwarts for a pseudo-"eighth year" to make up for the disruptions the war had caused to their education. While this was a right sight better than Azkaban, Draco couldn't help but see this as a form of punishment, too.
"Getting a little ahead of ourselves, aren't we?" She leaned around the corner into the Great Hall, and gestured for me to do the same.
"You know I can't be killed, right? He literally tried twice. And I don't even have any Horcruxes!" With a grimace, Harry laid his hand over mine and ripped the blade out of him with great effort. Once it clattered to the floor, his other hand came up to cradle the side of my face.
Slughorn called out a page number just then, and we both strived to look engaged as we flipped to said page. The context for the lecture was lost on me, and I assumed for Harry, too, but our conversation seemed to die naturally at this point as we both turned our attention to the lesson. An emotion I couldn’t name festered in my chest, but neither of us wrote back for the remainder of the class.
‘Love?’ My hand wrote slowly. Draco’s eyebrow quirked as I glanced sideways at him. Hastily, I explained my thought process. ‘When V’ I scratched out the V and continued, ‘Riddle tried to kill me as a baby, my mother’s sacrifice cast some sort of protection spell over me that ended when I turned 18. If love can bounce the Killing Curse off me effectively enough to slay the caster’
"It is," he immediately replied, and lifted himself to pull my face back to his. Our lips connected, and he kissed me soundly. When he finally released me, I pressed my lips together. "Are you sure?"
“Yeah,” I replied as we took hands again and made our way to where our friends were looking on. A range of expressions painted their expressions, but we silently slid onto the bench and began loading up our plates from the dishes. Eventually, the group’s cumulative amazement relaxed as they returned to their dinners.
"Don't get ahead of yourself, you'll jinx it," Harry cautioned teasingly before sighing. "I'm gonna miss this."
Pomfrey tucked the end of my new bandage into itself and left without a word. I supposed her giving me space was just another undeserved kindness, and I felt my eyes start to well up.
Harry was idly pulling grass from the ground, a knot between his eyebrows. He seemed… Relaxed. Albeit a bit stressed and tired, but he wasn't tense in my presence like I thought he'd be. His glasses slid down his nose and he pushed them back up before looking up at me, and I immediately looked away.
Still, it stung my heart a bit to know what my peers thought of Malfoy. Not that I didn't understand, even somewhat agree, but… Didn't Malfoy do everything he did because if he didn't, Voldemort would've killed him?
"It's mental to me that you and he got away with what you did. Sure your father was preoccupied, but where was your mother during all that?"
This kiss was just as passionate, but also just slightly sweet. I tasted gratitude in his mouth, and then felt his hands lifting my legs. My muscles obliged, allowing him to lift my knees nearly to my chest, and I thought I'd break a blood vessel in my face so hard was I blushing. He positioned himself at my entrance and pulled back to look at me.
Slughorn's class was empty, as expected. I decided to sit in the back row, furthest from the door this time.
We arrived to breakfast together, as per usual, but a knot of anxiety had begun to fester in my gut.
"Well, not all of the relevant information may be useful for the project. I say we finish listing pages with said information, and then later, during free period, go back through them and cross out ones we can't incorporate, and narrow down the list. Or is that still too much for you, Mr. Minimal Effort?"
"You have a point. I'm not sure how it works, either. I'll do some more research. If my subconscious
Flitwick launched into his lecture, and I half-heartedly tried to take notes and follow along with the reading, but the other half of me was intent on Draco. What was he thinking now?
happy for you." Her genuine inflection squeezed my slightly melted heart. "But don't think you're safe now, Mr. No-Longer-A-Virgin." She grinned slyly at me, poking my arm again. I tried, in vain, to distract myself by shakily tucking in my shirt tails to my trousers. "How was it?"
My hips started moving of their own accord as I took him into him, again and again. Draco's hands came to grip my hips as he thrusted into me, and I was rewarded with that expression on his face again. I could hardly focus on it, though, so overwhelming was the sensation. My eyes rolled back in my head.
My head started to spin, and I swayed toward the rest of the class to steady myself against the railing. I had asked Ron and Hermione if they thought he was even sorry, and neither answered.
"I… I think it was… When you came to find me by the lake. I'd expected you to be tense around me, but you weren't, and… W-when I glanced up, you were pulling grass out of the ground and your glasses had slid down your nose. It was p-probably when you pushed them back up and looked at me."
, Draco thought. Regardless, he scarfed down the rest of his meal and arrived early to his first class, Potions.
Just as I was slipping into a chair at an empty table and pulling out my Herbology textbook, what must've been the
‘Not as open as you’ My eyes glanced over to see his absorb my reply, quickly followed by the darkening of his cheeks. Flitwick suddenly distracted us by assigning us reading in our textbooks, and we both jotted down the page numbers he indicated. As soon as my quill lifted from my notes, the journal page we’d been passing disappeared from my desk.
“Maybe you don’t need practice after all. If all it takes is me making you a bit nervous…” He leaned in to pass his tongue across my upper lip, and one of his lightbulbs burst. “Honestly, I’m surprised the entire castle didn’t come crashing down the first time we fucked.”
Draco covered his laughter with a cough, the pink in his cheeks darkening a shade. I suddenly felt McGonagall's eyes on me, and strove to appear attentive. Eventually, though, my quill returned to the diary page.
I shook my head to clear that thought from it, and exited my room. Once in the common room, I strove not to hone in on the whispers that surrounded me, instead making a bee-line for the Great Hall. Once there, I found Harry already seated at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione. As I headed to join them, she saw me first, and I blanched.
The morning attendees were all sleepily forcing food down as we approached. With a clear of his throat, Harry addressed the group.
"Don't give me that look," he accused as he withdrew to sit beside me. A resigned sigh passed my lips as I sat up.
Feeling us both cum together was one thing, but watching his face as he did was another. Once he’d collapsed onto me, I was sure I’d never have a better orgasm.
"No, it was… Er…" I perked up, his hesitance piquing my interest. "One of my father's friend's… Sons…"
I’d garnered a fair bit of attention from the rest of the room, but instead of replying, Draco seized my face and crushed my lips to his.
With a reassuring smile, I released her and returned to Draco, who had remained frozen where I’d left him, looking on with his own awestruck expression. My cheeks warmed.
"Indeed. Erm… This might be inappropriate to say, but…" He met my eyes with such sudden sincerity that I froze. "Nobody blames you."
Experimentally, I did just that. Harry's delicious gasp drew air directly from my mouth as his hands seized my waist. It took all my willpower to pull my face a few inches away and look down into his eyes. Their shocked wideness eased as they drooped slightly. I was suddenly struck by the contrast of his beet-red face and the bright green of his irises.
“Oh, my god, I’m so sorry.” My fingers instinctively pried his hand away from his eye. “Let me look at it.”
'We tried to make it work for a little while, but when shit hit the fan, our priorities shifted. We're still friends, but I don't think we were ever a very good match. I suppose I just felt left out when Ron and Hermione got together.'
Was the only answer I could whisper back. She gave me a concerned side-eye, but thankfully decided to drop it, instead deciding to catch me up on what all they'd covered in the first ten minutes of class.
"Of course. A terrible thing happened here, one that directly affected you. Anyone who blames you is a fool."
Of course, Ron and Hermione would be each others' pair, and no doubt several other students would ask to work with me, but did I want to work with any of
"Sure," he said as he withdrew his wand from his night stand and refilled both our cups. After handing me mine, he stood and went to his window, leaning against the wall and gazing out. After a few gulps, I swung my legs around the side of the bed and set my glass back down.
"Of course! After glimpses into your head, how could I resist a full tour?" He grinned at me playfully, and I returned his playfulness with a weak shove.
"Look, if things turn nasty, just imagine me naked, alright? I'm sure your subconscious will make quick work stripping me, and
Fighting the urge to cum was nearly impossible, but all the multitasking I was doing made it slightly easier.
My spine straightened in shock. It was troubling to me how easily I transitioned from thinking of him as Malfoy to thinking of him as
"Er, Draco, can I… Talk to you?" I stood suddenly, unsure what exactly I was going to say but taking Hermione's hint to heart.
It was supremely uncomfortable to walk into Snape's old classroom, but he found a seat farthest away from the door and was fast asleep on his desk within moments. Not the dreaming kind of sleep, thankfully, but it wouldn't have mattered anyway because within minutes, the rest of the eighth-years started filtering in through the doors, waking him. He decided to look away, out the window, instead of acknowledging any of their reactions to his presence. He could feel the hatred without looking at it, thanks.
"Okay, I think we've finally got enough material for our project. Now we just have to decide how we're going to present the information, and get to organizing it."
Ron gave an assenting grunt, prominently focused on consuming as much as humanly possible. I offered Hermione a shrug, which she returned with an encouraging smile.
Harry slammed his forehead down onto the table with a groan. Hermione only snickered, and I was surprised to hear
"Mister Malfoy?" I winced at my father's title, but realized I hadn't been paying attention and had no idea what I was being asked.
The dust never seemed to settle on Draco's life. Deafening whispers followed him through Platform 9¾, and dread sank in his gut as he searched desperately for an empty compartment. Luckily for him, the third from the back was unclaimed. A sigh broke through his lips as he dropped into the seat, but he couldn't quite taste the relief on his breath. As the train rolled out of the station, he thought on his predicament.
He glanced at me, and I saw another thought struggling to make it to his lips. Instead of prodding, I waited patiently.
"Yeah. She helped me realize that I was worried about uncertainties. No point agonizing over something that may or may not even happen, right?"
“Were you…?” I felt an intrigued expression spread across my face as I shifted to face him more directly. “Worried you’d come between my friends and I?”
I pointed at her increasingly amused expression emphatically as I twisted my door knob and retreated into my dorm.
"Let them." I shoveled another spoonful of cereal into my mouth stubbornly. "I'm the reason they're breathing. Couldn't give a shit about their opinions of me, honestly."
large as his words resonated in my heart. However, regret reared its ugly head again, and an apology was on my lips before I even had time to arrange my thoughts.
tore at my heart a bit. "Also saw the piece of Riddle that had been inside me my whole life." Something I wanted to call disgust curled his lip slightly. "And when I came back, it didn't."
" My father glared at Harry as he faced him. "You're rotting in Azkaban, just like you deserve. You'd better thank your lucky stars you're not within my reach, because if I
"We still have probably half an hour before that thing should be visible," Draco commented and kissed my temple.
My heart rate stuttered and my hands started trembling, but I couldn't stop myself. My head was feeling increasingly lighter, and the adrenaline started climbing back up my spine. I was about thirty seconds from either throwing myself off the side or collapsing, when something suddenly grounded me.
"Hey, guys? Harry here, Harry Potter." Harry stood between them and me, facing the aurors who'd come for me.
At the same time, I was simultaneously jubilant that I could direct my Legillimency on a specific individual, but also frustrated that this skill couldn't have developed a
I took the glass, full of pinkish fluid, from his hands and hesitantly sipped from it. The flavor of alcohol still twisted my lips, but I found it much more palatable than the previous drink. He laughed at me.
With a sigh, Draco set his cup down on his night stand and backed up onto his bed, lifting one foot onto the edge and leaning back on his hands.
Harry's intonation said he was nearly there, and suddenly, I was, too. It’d been far too long, and I couldn’t help but be swept up in his ecstasy. "
Harry knelt to the floor to retrieve the telescope, looking it over to make sure it hadn't broken when he dropped it.
I cast an assuring glance around at Slughorn, McGonagall, and Flitwick as I pulled the Slytherin girl into my arms.
"North north-east, I think?" I said as I stood to join him. He peered through the lens and aimed it as instructed, searching the night sky.
dreams now are just an echo, but that bastard really got in my head. Made me think we shared similarities, and that everyone only does what's best for themselves, and that I should, too. I mean, I was
My heart seemed to squeeze slightly as warmth crept into my cheeks. Seamus gave a dramatic flourish with Draco's wand, inciting laughter from everyone. A chuckle even broke in my mouth.
your imagination can manage," he retorted and, as I watched him, he aged maybe two years. He grew slightly taller, a dark stubble shading his sharpening jaw, but the smug look on his face remained. "This is probably fairly accurate, right?" His voice had deepened, and I scowled.
Potter seemed… Oddly exhausted. Now that the Dark Lord was dead, did he have any reason to lose sleep anymore?
But I couldn't possibly take his again. He was only trying to offer some comfort in an uncomfortable situation, right?
I couldn't help but glance down at his legs spread around either side of mine. My awareness was suddenly focused on my hips, where his fingers were sneaking up my shirt. I swallowed and studied his face, trying to determine if he was teasing me or genuinely trying to…
I allowed myself a chuckle at the memory of Malfoy's reaction. He'd not only looked so hilariously shocked, but also positively perplexed. If all I did was random acts of kindness for him, like holding doors and choosing him as lab partners, it would drive him insane with bewilderment.
As he rolled onto his back, I took advantage of the bed and stretched my own limbs. My elbow barely collided with his brow, and I suddenly flipped over.
The night Dumbledore died was fresher still in my memory, here atop the tower where it happened. I remembered the terror in Malfoy's eyes, the way his hands and voice trembled. The class moved to the railing to look where Sinistra was pointing at the sky, but I was frozen still.
Harry had started eating nonchalantly, as if to encourage everyone to ease up, but it was especially ineffective on me. I simply sat, staring down at my hands and fiddling with my bandages.
‘YOU’RE the one constantly thinking about it. I can see it on your face’ My hands clapped onto my cheeks at this notion, loud enough that a few classmates closest to us cast suspicious glances back at us. Which, of course, only made my face hotter. Harry, however, continued. ‘You’re like an open book’
After what seemed like an eternity, we arrived at the top just as Sinistra was doing her head count. A few students cast dubious, even loathsome glances back at me, but when they saw Harry by my side, they quickly turned back around.
When the bell rang, we finally separated as we both turned to walk out first. Neither of us said a word as we descended the Astronomy tower. Before either of us could think of anything to say, we'd arrived at our Transfiguration class.
I couldn't admit it, but it stung to know the brunette was only being nice to me on someone else's behalf. But here he still was, even after admitting it, talking to me like mates. I wanted to make Potter spit blood, and tell him I didn't need hand-outs, but… Some part of me wanted to believe he actually wanted to be there. I pulled my legs into myself and glanced up at him.
I winced, hoping he hadn't jinxed it. Thankfully, we arrived at the doors to the Great Hall without incident. The enormous double doors swung open to allow us in. Everything in here looked untouched, too. Uninhabited, even.
"Nothing!" He glanced at my clearly disbelieving face, and sighed. "It… I mean… I was just w-wondering…"
"Quidditch is one of my favorite things to do... But I don't know, I think it might make games a bit unfair, don't you?"
the reaction I expected from my best friend. Regardless, this was his version, I supposed, of acceptance.
I was still prickly by the time Flitwick started class, but soon settled into the familiar wand patterns and incantations. Hermione, of course, with her knack for, well,
"The very same," Harry gave a half-hearted chuckle as the two shook hands. Rodolfo gave a disbelieving laugh.
"Nothing." I shoved another spoonful of cereal into my mouth, and was relieved to be joined by Ron and Hermione.
I'd never fancied a bloke before, so I really had no idea what I was doing, to be honest. If it hadn't been for that moment in the library, I probably still would've only thought of him as a friend. It was maddening, trying to gauge how much or how little I could touch him, how much or little I could say to him or ask him, how much or little time I could spend with him within reason.
And then there were the nightmares. The months when He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named was living under his roof, when the screams would wake him up at night and he witnessed true Evil, replayed behind his eyelids until he drove himself to exhaustion to escape sleep. Only when his pride was well and truly shattered did he resort to taking Dreamless Sleep before bed. Now he couldn't sleep without it. It was the first thing he packed, safely tucked away at the bottom of his luggage, when he prepared to go back to school.
We cautiously exited the train once the door slid open, and made our way towards the boats. Everything seemed normal so far, but I realized I was walking on eggshells.
Again, she mimed zipping her lips, locking them, and throwing away the key, all the while grinning smugly. With a groan, I pushed past her and collected my book bag, when I suddenly realized I'd left my wand in Draco's dorm. I froze.
"However, a word of caution is necessary at this moment of transition. Many, if not most of us have lost, in the past year, that which we will never regain. That can never be undone. It is now up to every individual to decide how we will allow that to change us. I urge you all to pursue the best possible outcomes. It is all too easy to allow the war to live on in our hearts, should we yield to hatred. Forgiveness is no petty trifle to give, but therein lies healing. And healing, dear students, is a goal I think we can all prioritize."
"I, uh… No clue," I concluded as I wrung my hands together anxiously. Harry approached me to take my hands in his.
I took a deep breath in through my nose and released it quietly as I felt Harry's thumb stroking the side of my thumb. With a set jaw, I forced myself to focus on the lecture. This time, when Sinistra called for us to take out our books, I was the one to hold mine open for both of us.
Initially, we were all surprised silent, but his hunched over, shaking figure sent us back over the edge. When our laughter finally subsided, I withheld a sudden urge to see if Draco was
I couldn't rightly say if I was ready or not, but I nodded nonetheless. With painstaking caution, he pushed himself into me.
“Mmmorning,” came his lazy reply, and he pressed his lips to the side of my neck. A flash of pain reminded me of the now-worsened welt he’d dealt my skin.
to leave this room, d'you hear me?" I tried my best to leak some intimidation into my tone as I stepped closer to her. "I don't care about what suspicions you had that may or may not have been confirmed. This isn't mine to tell, nor is it yours to share!"
blush on his face. He cleared his throat as I sat back in my seat, a curious grin spreading across my face.
Draco said we still weren't even, but I think he did forgive me, because he asked me to toss him a pumpkin pasty, and I obliged.
'If you still hate me, you don't have to go out of your way to tolerate me, you know. If you want to tell me to fuck off forever, I will.'
Toward the end of class, Sprout assigned us a project. Group up in pairs, choose a research topic, and create a presentation to share with the class.
"Come on, aren't you going to sit down?" Harry patted the bench next to him expectantly, but several other Gryffindors were giving me such looks ranging from mistrust to curiosity to surprise, and I wanted to bolt.
Catching my breath to answer him verbally seemed futile, so I silently swallowed and nodded. His eyes never left mine, but I couldn't bring myself to watch him expose me, so my head fell back onto the bed as my pajama pants and boxers were pulled down to my knees. My cheeks burned even hotter, and I lifted my hands to cover my face.
Draco's breath was coming more quickly now, and every exhale was a different kind of moan. His hand found mine on his thigh and gripped it tightly, and I, in turn, gripped his thigh.
Draco was clearly pleased, too, judging by the look on his face as he leaned against his bathroom door watching me.
were stuck on repeat in my head from years of sitting atop my pedestal, but after having fallen from such a height, I expected to be curb-stomped by those I'd looked down on. And here they were, helping me up?
“Come to mention it, can I talk to you?” I stood, tugging Draco’s sleeve. “See you in the tower later, guys.”
Truth be told, I maybe saw a little too much when I used Legillimency on Draco. How he hated being called by his surname because he associated it with his father, how worthless he felt that any attention directed at him was baffling… My distaste toward him softened, however slightly.
His legs sliding back off the bed answered my question as his lips reached my navel. I wanted to look at him, but couldn't force myself to. All I could do was keep gasping in air as his fingers found my waistband. He started tugging, and I suddenly forgot how to breathe. Here, however, he paused.
"Draco!" I whined as he joined me, my glasses dangling from his fingers. Once I'd shoved them onto my face, I realized it
"Wow. This… Makes so much sense." I commented as I walked around the room, observing not even a single atom of dust.
It was more of an instinct than a decision when I set down my glass of water, dismounted the chair, and went to kiss him. He gasped through his nose as my lips connected with his, and clung to the front of my shirt. Before I could process what was happening, he was leaning back and pulling me down on top of him.
"Yeah." Was all he said. A grin stretched my lips, but before I could reply, he continued, "W-we should probably get to class."
"I'd like you to set an example to the other students. They might be afraid of the ones who've been given a second chance, but I'd very much like to avoid that chance going to waste."
Instead of causing a fuss or making a mess, he grimly touched his magic quill to his arm, soaking up the blood to write with. He was only taking notes, so no one would see it but him. Still, he made a mental note to go to the infirmary later and try to find some gauze.
he was. His half-lidded eyes glanced from mine to my lips, and just like that, they were back on his.
at me. The rest of lunch passed uneventfully, and then we were off to the library for our free period.
Eagerly obliging, I tried to mimic his pacing and kept the rhythm synced between my hand and my hips.
“What the fuck is going on?” I demanded as I tore through the gathering to crouch over the weeping first-year. “Are you alright?”
I'd never admit it to him, but the brief moments I'd been inside his mind were very telling. However, I genuinely did want him to open up to me and tell me of his own volition. Whether that would ever happen, I couldn't be sure. But I hoped.
"And…?" Hermione beamed at me expectantly. When I didn't answer, she sighed. "What you think of each other is that
As soon as I was released, I all but ran out of the room, only to find Draco leaned against the wall outside, waiting for me.
‘Of course. Still, that stick is rather pitiful…’ He turned a teasing grin up at me as he stamped out the final ellipses. His competitive nature inflamed my own as I snatched the page back from beneath his hand.
” My lips found his, and I was suddenly scrambling to rid myself of the rest of my clothes. His bound wrists wrapped around the back of my neck, keeping our lips connected as I undressed. There was no force in heaven or on Earth that could’ve prevented me from fucking him. Before dropping my trousers, however, I withdrew my wand from my pocket and prepped us both.
Why that mattered so much to me, I couldn't understand. Still, the last few steps to their table were agonizing.
My head drooped as pleasure started to pool at the base of my spine. To my utter embarrassment, a whimper sounded in my throat.
suddenly seemed lost for words. I was accustomed to seeing Hermione blush, but this blush confused me. She glanced up at me.
"Holy shit," I commented as the train lurched forward. We were moving again. I suddenly realized the sky had lightened again, too.
sight I'd ever seen, but I was sure if I broke into hysterics now, they'd all think I'd played an elaborate prank on them, so I simply stared at the table in silence, waiting for someone else to say something,
“There’ll be plenty of time for both.” He pulled my face close enough to kiss my forehead, right on my scar. “That is, unless you don’t think you could go a few
Silently, I flipped to the table of contents in my Herbology textbook to try to narrow down a research topic as Draco sat next to me.
With Hermione's insistence, I copied all the notes down from the entire class, but my attention was torn between the lecture and that damn blond in my eyesight.
"Nothing, I guess." He sipped his water again. "So… Quidditch practice is Monday Wednesday Friday, right?"
"It'll certainly be a shock to everyone… Might upset a few… But honestly, what can they do? You're still Harry Potter even if you're dating a guy."
"Yeah, disgustingly so, but…" Seamus tore a bite of bread off in his mouth and continued around it. "Far be it from us to stand in the way of happiness."
Fighting off a grin was increasingly difficult as Harry's hand casually brushed against mine as we walked. A sideways glance at him told me he was having just as hard a time keeping his face neutral.
"J… Just don't do anything I wouldn't do!" I felt confusion twist my brow, when she grasped my wrist. "Don't do anything YOU wouldn't do, okay?" She clarified.
echoed in my mind. Tongue, fingers, scent, warmth were all I could perceive as he ravaged my mouth with his. Nothing but my fist gripping his tie again, our mouths steadily bruising each other, when suddenly it ended.
I scowled, but the wandless, nonverbal magic we’d practiced the previous night gave me an idea. It was tricky, like trying to hit my own knee just right to cause the kicking reflex, but I tried to imagine the panic I’d feel if someone opened the door just then, and suddenly my tie loosened around my wrists.
"Still haven't had enough, have we?" Draco suggested, then downed the rest of his drink, eyeing me flirtatiously.
suddenly registered on my erection. The same thing happened to my fingers, and I experimentally touched them together to realize two of them were slick.
My eyes narrowed at her. Maybe she wasn't as oblivious as I suspected? I hesitantly cast Legillimens at her, but it bounced off her Occlumens and she gave me a scowl. I smiled apologetically at her, silently chastising myself for doubting her Occlumency skills.
"Harry." I stood, and he half-turned to look at me. My face arranged itself in such a hateful glare at my father, I could almost feel the distaste dripping from my expression. "He's not worth it. He only wants to control me because he can't control his own life. Look where your choices got you, you
"What exactly have you two even been talking about? Can't imagine he has much to say to you, except apologize." Neville offered, to which Seamus snorted.
"I thought it was mental, too. But it turns out, people care about you. And I guess now it's MY job to fix everyone's damn problems."
that I was sitting with him, talking to him, working with him. Which in turn made my face even hotter.
Then there was the issue of the Boy Who Lived himself. What should he do if faced with the Golden Trio? Sneer? Avert his eyes? Would they lash out at him? If Potter tried to hit him, should he stand and take it? Or would that make him more of a target? Panic stirred in his chest and he took a deep breath to try to assuage it. He could cross those bridges when he came to them. For now, he turned his gaze out into the rolling, green hills and thought of his mother. He had been in no place to offer her comfort, but now that she was alone in that big, cold house, how would she fare? The panic in his ribs turned to worry and he idly scratched at his Dark Mark.
"I'm-I'm sorry! I really am, Draco, I…" I felt the bed shift as he came to sit beside me. He sighed. "If there's anything you want to know about me, I'll be one hundred percent honest with you. I promise."
"Apologies aren't necessary. I understand it must be difficult to be here." I grimaced down at the floor. "If there's anything I can do to make it easier for you, please don't hesitate to let me know. Even if it's looking the other way every once in a while when you don't show up. I know Mr. Potter will keep you abreast of the lessons."
"Your wish," he released me, smacked my ass (earning a surprised yelp from me), and withdrew his telescope from his desk drawer. "My command," he said as he handed it to me.
"Then what!? WHY are you being so… So nosy about me? Getting involved in my business? Sticking up for me when no one asked you to!?"
With a roll of his eyes, the blond finally followed me to the bathroom as I set the shower water running. We were already naked, so there was no stripping to do, but we did stand heartily blushing as we waited for the water to warm.
All the portraits on the walls, usually bustling with animated characters, were empty, save for the backgrounds. The unsettling hush persisted as even the staircases seemed frozen in time.
"That first day... When I helped you pick up your things, were you...? Did I...?" I didn't half know where to begin asking this question, but Draco seemed to understand.
My eyes locked with his, and all my humor died. There it was, swimming in those emerald pools, as clear as day. I wanted to hide from it
He unconsciously started scratching at his arm again as his anxiety took over. Yes, this was quite a suitable punishment.
When the bell signaling the end of class finally tolled, I waited for the rest of the students to leave first, but groaned internally as I realized Harry was waiting for me. I didn't want to be alone with McGonagall now that I knew what I knew, but I
His glance caught in my eyes, and we shared a very intense moment. My cheeks warmed, and I tore my eyes from his to finish my meal. The rest of our classmates were pouring into the Hall now.
The rest of the table didn’t even raise an eyebrow as I pulled Draco along with me out toward the courtyard.
"I forgive you." A multitude of emotions flashed across Draco's face, but I continued. "You used to be a prick, and you're
The most beautifully strangled cry ripped from Draco's lips as he released onto his chest a second later. Our gripped appendages squeezed each other so tightly as I tremblingly pressed as deep into him as I could reach. Once I was sure I couldn't cum another drop, I fell back onto my hands.
“Mm,” was the only answer I got as we finished redressing ourselves and made our way to the Great Hall.
I wanted to apologize for subconsciously invading his privacy, but I was too hung up on the admission he'd made in the dream.
crossed my lips as we held each other. We embraced a moment more before I pressed a chaste kiss to the biggest scar on his chest.
Draco was crying. 1 AM found me sitting on the floor at the foot of my bed, teeth worrying my poor nails. I glanced down at the open Marauder's Map at my feet, confirming Draco was still in his room. At this point, I knew him well enough to know when to give him his space. But all the same, I couldn't help but wonder.
He awoke with a start, and for a brief moment, I saw wild horror in his eyes. A look I was all too familiar with. When he found my face, his ears turned bright pink.
"Shit…" Hastily, I pulled my shirt back over my head and collected my book bag. "Er… Keep the snacks, I guess. I brought way too many…"
Maybe this could be the moment he snuck off to the infirmary for some gauze? But coming to class late was worse than just being last, and he didn't want to start the semester off getting points taken from his house. So, with a grim scowl, he followed his peers to Herbology, a good seven paces behind them.
Our banter was both comforting and slightly unsettling, but I was stepping back into my pants and trousers before he finally looked at me again.
"I think you should go for it. It's our last year anyway, might as well do what you want while we can."
"It's quite itchy. I should probably get my bandages replaced again soon, but it might already be scabbing."
I wanted to laugh at her outrageous request, but the sincerity in her eyes stopped it in my throat. A whirlwind of emotions flooded through me, and I was silent for a long while. Finally, after what must've been 50 seconds, I sighed.
"Yeah… I guess." I pushed my arms into my shirt and started doing up the buttons. "He's… Still the same, but… Somehow, completely different."
Once class ended, we headed to the Great Hall together, once again hand-in-hand. The irony of my being shown kindness while Harry had been shown hatred was still reeling my mind a bit, but I'd already seen how nobody would say anything to us while we were together. That anyone would have the nerve to go against the Savior of the Wizarding World was beyond me, but teenagers were teenagers at the end of the day. At the dinner table, the following conversation ensued:
think,” we continued as we dropped onto the Gryffindor bench in the Great Hall. “There’s someone out here who’d make a
He did, in fact, follow and sit across from me, to the utter shock of the Slytherins that scooted away from me. I silently started filling my plate from the dishes in the center of the table, and Harry did the same. A glance up at him told me he was fully confident in his decision, nonchalant even.
is in any way asking me out?" He laughed again, and I pouted. This was far too amusing for him, so I decided to turn the tables.
"Anytime," he responded in kind. I didn't release his hand yet, though. I was afraid if I did, I'd lose the balance I'd just finally achieved.
I could barely hear myself, but somehow he perceived my question because a wide grin stretched across his face.
Lucius wasn't worth all the hatred in Draco's heart, however. Some, he saved for himself. It chafed his ego to admit he had made mistakes, but the weight of his regrets was heavy enough without trying to maintain his pride. True, he had been raised to look down on muggle-borns, but to be painted with the same colors as those who would see them all dead… It sent chills down his spine. He had spent weeks scratching at the skin where his Dark Mark was, trying to scrape it off. He had only succeeded in adding to the multitude of scars in his skin and terrifying his mother.
My panic must've been lost within the post-coital reconstitution, because Draco didn't comment, didn't react. All the same, my thoughts were circling the drain of
"If you ever tell anyone I said this, I'll deny it and hex you, but…" She stepped close enough that only I would be able to hear. "Draco and Harry sitting in a tree… K-I-"
As I shoved my hands into my pockets, he followed suit and set his glass down on the floor, a teasing smile playing at his mouth. He stood and stepped so close, his gin-breath ghosted across my lips.
"Malfoy, I've just about had a lifetime's fill of enemies, so can you just cut the bullshit already? I don't want any more, and I'm sure you don't either."
I'm not sure how long I was staring, but as soon as I realized I was, I decided to leave him to sleep. But at that very moment, his sleeping became disturbed. His brow knit together and his breathing accelerated.
I found I was intensely curious to see how Draco would react. Would he give me up at the first sign of trouble? Would he fight for himself? Class was over before I could reach a conclusion, and I was still deep in thought as we silently walked to the Great Hall together.
It was a weird kind of smug, though. I didn't think he was just gleeful that I was uncomfortable, but it was more like… He was…
he looked, mixing us drinks, but he was pouring them back into the glasses we'd previously used before I could comment.
This was the repetitive mantra in my head for a good ten minutes. I'd seen it, after all. He'd been lost in thought about
With the utmost care, I withdrew my fingers, pulled my mouth away, and swallowed what I'd received. I knelt between his legs to catch my breath for a moment, before climbing back onto the bed beside him. I leaned on one arm to face him, taking in every inch of his flushed, heavy-lidded expression with a grin.
I stunned myself silent as I realized some of what I'd said to Harry could also be applied to myself. A strange warmth flooded through me at the notion that understanding him was helping me understand myself.
We boarded an unmanned boat, and it carried us silently across the water. Eventually, the castle came into view, and everything looked… Pristine. No bodies, no carnage, no destruction. It was then I realized we'd changed into our robes. Harry glanced between us and chuckled.
With another groan, I lifted myself off him and leaned over the side of my bed to grab my wand. I cast the same vanishing spell inside him as I'd done before, and that was that. I flopped onto the bed beside him, throwing an arm and a leg over him.
"Booze? If anyone will sell me any… Might visit the magical artifacts shop, see if they have anything new."
care that they all knew, it was the supposed importance I knew it’d have to them that bothered me. They’d all be offering me different looks, as if to say
"'Mione, I really don't see how that's any of your business," I asserted as I tore myself from her hands. My legs carried me to my dresser, where I withdrew my blazer, and started pulling it onto me. One glance behind me at her pitiful expression drew yet
to disappear and let the chips fall where they may." He ducked his flushed face, and when he spoke again, it was barely a whisper. "When I woke up, it was like no time had passed, but… I spent
“Right, of course not… It’s the weekend, after all, and… You said you’d let me know the moment she responded.”
Draco's legs carried him all the way to the edge of the Black Lake, where he found a tree to lean on. The adrenaline was fading, leaving his brain foggy and his limbs shaking. He slid to the grass against the tree, and just focused on breathing.
"This isn't f-fair…" I managed to croak as his fingers tickled my skin. A deep laugh rumbled in his chest.
“Nah, I’ve been living up to expectations my whole life. It’s fun flipping the script on everyone. N-not that
Since I could feel both his tightness and my own girth, I assumed a slightly faster pace, at each pass feeling both of our pleasure.
"You think I need someone to babysit me while you're busy?" I asked incredulously. It came out a bit more biting than I'd meant. Harry only cocked an eyebrow at me, but Hermione, ever-sensitive, interrupted his answer.
It'd been quite a long time since I'd done this, but the muscle memory easily returned as I focused on keeping a consistent rhythm with both my mouth and my fingers. His leg twitched again as a wholly
"Hm?" I asked, feigning ignorance. When I didn't look up at her, she sighed and stood, nearly dragging me from the table and out of the hall. "Hey-! Hermione, what-?"
“We’re gonna get in so much trouble… But the Headmistress only has herself to blame, after all, I mean… It’s her fault any of this is even happening…” He continued under his breath, but nonetheless, I perceived. He must’ve predicted my eye roll as he suddenly straightened. The red of his cheeks hadn’t diminished in the slightest as he shoved an apple into his mouth, leaning into his free hand and sighing dramatically.
Now, I did force myself to look down at him. His eyes glanced down before returning to mine, and I understood his question. '
Draco's face turned bright red, and he didn't take the paper back for several nail-biting minutes. When he finally reached his quill over to my desk, all he wrote was,
"If he survives that long," I chuckled, but it turned into a sigh. "Quite a task she's assigned to me, eh?"
His thumb stroking my cheek seemed to bring some control back to my body, just enough that I could speak for myself.
"Well, you're lucky I'm not just taking out my sexual frustration on you, then." He leaned down to kiss me again, and I realized he was probably talking about Rodolfo.
forming on his lips, and hastily interrupted that thought. "Some crazy old witch predicted you'd vanquish evil, and for some reason that means you're without flaw? Bollocks. What, are you
The general consensus of the rest of the group amounted to uneasy affirmation, but that was enough for me.
"You have no one to blame but yourself," I promised as I yawned. Draco stretched his limbs with a groan, but only thoughts of his face from our dream-sex dominated my thoughts.
"I don't want to do this," I answered through gritted teeth. She gripped my arm. We walked in silence to our third class of the day, Charms.
“Please…” I rolled my eyes, finally tearing them from his body as I stepped into my pants and pulled them up, wincing again as the elastic passed over my tender skin. “There’s nothing you could do to me I wouldn’t be able to handle.”
Experimentally, I ran one hand up and down the length of Draco's back. His response was to lean even further into my arms, nestling his face into my neck. Hot tears spilled onto my skin, but his shuddering frame seemed to relax as he took a few deep breaths. My hand continued steadily up and down his back as I allowed him all the time he needed.
you all McGonagall asked Harry to be nice to Malfoy. What did you expect?" Ron interjected, his mouth full.
Some of the other eighth-years stuck around the Gryffindor table with us, but most went back to their respective house's tables. I intentionally (again, reluctantly) sat facing the Slytherin table, and was unsurprised to see Malfoy eating alone. He seemed lost in thought, and I quickly dismissed him. Having my friends around, just eating together and laughing, was too good a feeling to ruin with keeping an eye on my ex-nemesis.
Granger was wrapped around his arm, and they were talking animatedly until they saw me. Harry's carefree face immediately changed to one of alarm when he saw my puffy eyes, but I wasn't about to have this conversation here and now. I went through the doors ahead of them and power walked all the way to my room.
His hips angled slightly more upward, and suddenly his voice was ascending in pitch, his moans coming more frequently.
This damn flush in my face didn't go away the entire time we were discussing topics. I was ready to lash out at him the moment he said anything about it, but he never did. If anything, the git seemed
We ended up holding hands the entire class. I was unwilling to let his hand go, and he never tried to pull away, either. Which left us in a very awkward position.
"I-" He tried to say, but his voice came out as a whisper. After clearing his throat, he tried again. "I don't know what to say," he eventually confessed. He still wouldn't meet my eyes as his began to water. "I can't wrap my head around how you can see beyond my past." His voice broke, and it seemed to strike an arrow through my heart.
"I' thay you alreathy hab," his tongue and lips moved around my ear as his teeth gently bit down. Another tremble coursed through me.
‘Sometimes it’s questionable’ I slowly wrote back. This time, he snatched the page back before I had a chance to pass it back. A grimace contorted my lips as I watched him furiously respond.
I held as still as I possibly could as Harry adjusted. When I felt his muscles relax, I slowly pulled myself almost all the way out, and was rewarded with a new kind of groan from him. Relaxed as he was, I pushed myself into him a bit more quickly this time. Another moan sounded in my throat as I assumed a painfully slow pace with him.
"Exactly." I grabbed a bag of crisps and ripped them open, crunching soundly on them. "Any idea where we might get our hands on some of these herbs?" With a free hand, I pulled our notes out of my bag, trying not to get crisp dust on them. "D'you think Sprout would lend them to us?"
Remembering this fact, I hastily arranged my own breakfast from the dishes set out on the Gryffindor table. Slowly, the rest of the group joined us, but Harry and I were done before the rest. We slipped away quietly, leaving Hermione to whisper animatedly to the redhead, and the rest looking half-awake as they consumed their breakfasts. Once outside the Hall, I rounded on Harry.
"Maybe determining one's compatibility with another?" I whispered back with a shrug. We shared a laugh just as Sinistra started calling attendance.
We did end up being late to breakfast, but it was worth the entertainment of watching Harry frantically dress himself, cast his bodily cloaking spell, and try to work off his erection, all the while casting me scathing looks. By ten minutes in to breakfast, we were strolling into the Great Hall, hand-in-hand.
"Draco…" I'd meant to sound more wary, but my voice came out breathy. One of his arms unwrapped from around my waist and fingers wrapped around my reawakening member. A gasp hissed into my mouth as I braced myself against the window with one hand. "I…" My sentence was lost as his hand started stroking and he pressed me tighter against him.
Harry’s voice was steadily rising in pitch, and I suddenly wanted to show him what he looked like, so I lifted off his neck and watched his face. His eyes were closed, but the slight shift in his expression betrayed embarrassment.
"Well, I mean... If we start openly dating... There's a high probability people will think I'm doing so against my will, and I want to protect him from any harassment, but I don't want to paint him in such a way that he seems powerless to defend himself-"
My head snapped up, first to glare at his half-turned smirk, but then to McGonagall, because he wasn't actually wrong. I'd been zoning out in class far too often lately.
"Impossible!" My voice still wasn't my own, and the terror his voice inspired in me caused even my possessed hands to tremble.
Return to Hogwarts? After all he had done? He didn't believe it until he received his formal invitation via owl. He wasn't sure he wanted to stay home, either. Since losing Lucius, Narcissa had grown even more distant from Draco, and the one source of warmth in his home turned cold. He had to go back, though, as a sign of good faith and atonement. Draco understood the pretenses very clearly. This last year would be a test, to see if he would follow in his father's footsteps now that the Dark Lord was gone.
I couldn't ignore the heat in my face, but thankfully, Draco didn't comment on it. We just kept stacking books into our arms silently.
Another flush crept into my cheeks as we both wrapped our towels around our waists and brushed our teeth with the two toothbrushes that'd presented themselves on the sink.
Tossing my robes in her general direction (and carefully avoiding eye contact) I went to my dresser to withdraw a clean pair of pants. When I withdrew back into my bathroom to change into them, she must've insinuated the rest of my sentence because, when I reemerged in only my briefs, she was grinning broadly. With another roll of my eyes and a sigh, I snatched my robes from her tightly gripped fingers and started dressing. We'd changed around each other enough during our months hunting Horcruxes, this was nothing for us.
intentionally testing his boundaries, but the results were far more entertaining than I could've hoped for. All his brash nonchalance was nowhere to be found, and I'd reduced him to a blushing mess, hiding against the side of my neck.
Still pensively silent, I followed the flow of students to the Great Hall. I hardly even noticed when my presence at the Gryffindor table was met with a sudden hush.
His answer didn't make me feel any better, but we were entering the Great Hall now, so I decided to drop it as we joined my friends.
If I was honest with myself, I didn't want him to need me. Want me? Of course, but that had already been established. Just as I stepped off the last stair of the astronomy tower, my reverie was shattered.
The Room of Requirement was arranged as dorms for all the eighth-years, so they wouldn't over-crowd their usual house dorms, but sharing a space with everyone seemed to Draco like a recipe for disaster. At least everyone would get their own rooms, but wading through the sea of his peers gathered in the common room, he felt like a sardine thrown to sharks.
“Oh, god, I’m gonna be sick… Ow!” Seamus reached down for his ankle, and I had to assume Hermione’d kicked him. This seemed to bring Harry’s presence of mind back as he cast her a sideways glance. She was happily spooning porridge into her mouth.
honest, I wanted to keep his sweaty hand in mine forever. It felt so solid, like I'd been subconsciously reaching out for something to grab this whole time, and now that I'd found it, I was wholly unwilling to let it go. Who knows when he'd let me hold his hand again?
“Why do I even bother? The cloaking charm, the sneaking around, the late night rendezvous…” He muttered to himself as he lifted his arms to fold around his head, shoving away his untouched plate.
"We should get ready for class," he murmured against my skin. I twisted my face to look at him with one eye.
Draco couldn't move, couldn't speak, couldn't even breathe as he watched the brunette hold out a handful of his things to him. When he didn't immediately take them, Potter's lips twitched.
my problem!" I was surprised to hear aggravation in Harry's voice. "It's just… McGonagall said this thing that I can't get out of my head, and against all odds you actually DO have a heart, and I can't just go back to blindly hating you. So what the fuck am I supposed to do?"
I committed it to memory as I silently attended Harry's throbbing erection. He clapped a hand over his mouth, and I was all the more committed to having him yield to his pleasure. I reached my left hand up to peel his from his mouth, replacing it on my head. Another
With flaming cheeks, I threw an arm over my eyes. Today would be an interesting day, to be sure. Another groan sounded in my throat as I sat up. I decided to be early to breakfast again, so I started getting ready. When I finally emerged, though, Harry was pacing anxiously outside my door. He immediately turned his intense attention to me.
Everyone's eyes were back on me now, and I would've ran right then if I hadn't caught Harry giving me the biggest, stupidest grin.
I scowled and set off at a slightly faster pace than we had been walking. Harry simply jogged to keep up.
“Think you could do it?” I dared him as I began slowly withdrawing from his warmth. He groaned, then swallowed.
"Jesus," I whispered. My fingers left his skin as he turned back to face me, a different kind of pink coloring his cheeks.
"Isn't it?" I commented as I propped myself up to sit against the headboard. "What a different world it'd be now if
"Not even close. You've got to teach me how to do that," I gestured from my head to his, implying legillimency.
The rest of Charms passed uneventfully, and then we were off to lunch. The crowds in the hallway still parted before us, but Draco and I were too distracted to care.
He cast me a sideways scowl but studiously tried to focus on the material before him. I withdrew my attention, suddenly feeling awful for prying. And what's worse is he didn't even know I'd heard what I'd heard.
Draco's eyes raked down my naked body, and I could've blushed into my fingers. Before he said anything else, though, he grabbed his wand from beside my head and aimed it at himself. He uttered a spell I couldn't hear, and then aimed it at me. I hadn't even a moment to wonder what he was about to cast on me when his lips moved again, and within me, I felt a strange, shifting sensation. He tossed his wand to the floor then, and lowered himself down to kiss me.
" I hadn't meant to exclaim this, but it slipped from my lips nonetheless. Draco observed my expression with concern, but seemed to be reassured as he closed the gap between his hips and mine. An incredible sound slipped from his lips as he did this, and I gasped.
Class was over before I realized, and it came as a shock to me that I'd survived the entire lesson without incident. This small victory gave me a tiny ounce of pride. However, that was quickly replaced with dread when Sinistra asked me to stay behind. I cast Harry a worried glance, but he nodded encouragingly.
Turning my gaze from his concerned face, I resolutely pulled his pajama trousers and briefs down to his ankles. Having come face-to-face with his erection, I swallowed. Thankfully, he'd dropped his head back onto the bed, so whatever reaction I'd had was hidden from him. I ran my hands back up his legs, and curiously leaned in to nudge him with my nose. One of his legs twitched, and I nearly missed the quiet half-gasp he gave. This only encouraged me, though, and I decisively ran my tongue over his tip.
"I'm... Not sure, honestly... My future was already kind of planned for me, but since that's no longer an option..."
Somehow, his touch seemed to bring feeling back into my fingers. He said nothing as I forced a deep, DEEP breath into my lungs and tried to let it out evenly. Thankfully, my heart rate began decelerating as my trembling hand gripped his.
"Um… H-Harry?" A voice I didn't expect raised my head. My eyes boggled at a, yet again, very pink-faced Draco.
"I love it when you talk academic," I teased with a grin. Draco smirked, but a faint pink touched the tips of his ears. "By the way, I've never asked, what are your plans for after graduation?"
My thoughts could barely even form as I pressed my mouth against Draco's. All my prior anxiety seemed to vanish, though, and for that I was grateful. His soft breathing on my cheek, his hair tickling my forehead, his lips against mine were all I could comprehend.
?" A girl in my year who I'd never bothered to learn the name of stood in my way with a few other girls behind her. My eyebrows raised incredulously.
However, towards the end of the lunch period, I saw Malfoy get up to leave when a group of other Slytherins pushed past him, intentionally knocking him to the floor and scattering his belongings. With a loathsome sigh, I stood.
Once we finally made it to the top of the tower, Professor Sinistra called for our attention and counted us out.
The Dark Lord's name had rarely been uttered in my presence, and hearing it now seemed to shake my psyche because the train literally shuddered.
He gave me a sad smile, and I couldn't help but lean in to wrap my arms around him. The tugging of him into my embrace sent him forward and me backward until we were sprawled out on the grass, dissolving into easy laughter.
Harry smiled at me, and I felt my heart melt a little. I couldn't help but smile back at him. The silence dragged on a bit too long, and I cleared my throat.
So exhausted and preoccupied was I that I was asleep beneath the covers before I could remember my Dreamless Sleep. It'd been longer than I'd care to admit since I last had a dream, but the dream I had that night was unlike the ones I'd come to expect.
"Your friends will always be your friends, though, and it's not like we can never come back here. I'm sure you'll be invited back to make appearances like every other week." Harry snorted. "I, for one, can't wait to have free time again. Free time! I can't even remember what that's like."
'Impressive, Mr. Minimal Effort. Just how much schoolwork are you hoping to accomplish in one night?'
"I… I'm gonna be early." Draco stood and nearly ran from the table. As I watched him, perplexed, I saw him dodge Ron and Hermione, who were arriving hand-in-hand. Ron was giving me (or rather, trying
"So there was this time in first year, when I was out wandering the castle in my Invisibility Cloak, and I stumbled upon the Mirror of Erised. You know what that is?" Draco nodded, listening intently. I swallowed. "Well… When I walked up to it, I saw… My mum and dad, standing behind me. Smiling at me." I was briefly lost in the memory before I continued. "And then… When V- he came back, we dueled and our spells… Connected? I still don't really understand, but Dumbledore called it priori incantatem? I saw all the people he'd killed, including my parents. The final time was in the Forbidden Forest when I was walking to my death. Dumbledore'd left me the Resurrection Stone, and I finally used it. I talked to my parents, to Sirius, to Lupin... "
"I-I think it would be…" He swallowed. "Like a safety net? If our dream turned terrible, to be able to wake up… Not alone…"
"A-anyway, I hope you'll forgive me… One day…" He cleared his throat as he shoved his head, then his arms back into his pajama shirt. I waved a hand dismissively.
'Think we could cause enough of a disturbance that Flitwick'd have the balls to tell Harry Potter to move seats?'
"What the fuck? Who the hell are you and what have you done with Malfoy?" Some color was returning to Finnegan's face as he looked me up and down. I attempted a sheepish grin, and his shock replaced his confusion again. "I never knew your face could do that."
His answering pout was so damn adorable, I leaned down to kiss him. I'd already tested his limits once, but I just couldn't help myself. My fingers wrapped around the edges of his shirt and lifted. When his arms raised to allow me to strip it off him, I took it as a green light and immediately reconnected our lips. The pressure of my kiss forced him back on my bed, and I was straddling him within moments.
Draco was deeply lost in throughout the entire train ride, and when they finally came upon the rebuilt castle, it was too soon. With his jaw set and a familiar scowl in place, he gathered his luggage and followed the flow of students out into the night. He tried to keep his head down, ignore the whispers and the way the crowd seemed to part before him, but his desire to avoid the Three Musketeers drew his gaze up to rake over faces. Most were strangers, some were slightly familiar acquaintances, even fewer were those he once considered friends, but they all had something in common:
Draco rolled his eyes, but he must've actually been worried about it, because he turned his attention back to the lesson. Without him stealing glances at me, my attention followed suit.
Shock, once again, stained his pink features. He blinked a few times before refocusing on my face. My hand loosened to allow his tie to slide from my fingers.
"Making us truly even," was his only answer as his fingers made quick (if trembling) work of his buttons. No words found me as he finally shed his shirt, and my eyes widened.
The look I gave him must've been desperate, because when he glanced at me and Hermione, another sigh broke on his greasy lips.
"Honestly, I'm not even sure it's a real memory. If it is, I was too young to understand what they were saying. It's just them, alive, and interacting with me."
Harry was still patiently awaiting my response, but I didn't miss the surprise on his face when my response was suddenly standing, without ever touching my food.
"Oh, what business did you have in town, Draco?" Hermione asked as she helped herself to some toast. I shoved an elbow into Harry's side.
"Of course I have. It's a handcrafted spell, though, so it's not like a removal spell is just conveniently lying around."
"You don't have to apologize. I can't imagine what living with him under the same roof must've been like."
Okay, this time, I was honestly just trying to keep him out of trouble, but what I'd heard filled my heart almost painfully full.
“Honestly, they might. But you’re not forcing my hand or anything, I’m hanging out with you so much because I
His eyes quickly skimmed what I'd written, and a frown creased his brow. He snatched the paper from my desk before my words could fully disappear.
My eyes skimmed his words before looking up to his in confusion. Fascination seemed to sparkle behind his green eyes, and my heart stuttered.
Harry gaped at my words for a moment, and I had to stifle a laugh. When he finally ripped the page back onto his own desk, it was with aggression.
I made to push around him to try to fix his light, but he stopped me, and I landed back on the desk with a hiss.
My legs were just barely reaching an ache (I had been at Quidditch tryouts for the first time in years today) when he surprised me by flipping us over. This motion was accompanied by an
Once we'd gathered all the books from our list, we brought them back to the table and spread them out. He took half and I took half, and we started going through and making notes of page numbers with relevant information. I was honestly shocked at the progress we'd made in one free period by the time the bell signaled the end.
All I ever wanted was a quiet life. When that didn't pan out, at least I got to learn magic, but now that life was quiet again, why should I have to strut around like the end-all-be-all of magical heroism? Couldn't everyone just ignore me, or treat me like a normal person?
Harry's face lit up. He tried to conceal it, but it was too late. Before he had a chance to say anything, I continued.
"You might've fooled him and his goody-goody band of lunatics, but you're a scourge on the Slytherin house. You should just drop out, save yourself the embarrassment."
But when I turned to see why he'd stopped, my heart lodged itself in my throat. He was frowning down at our clasped hands.
When class finally ended, I blinked down at my blank parchment. I hadn't taken a lick of notes, I'd been so lost in thought.
Draco flicked his quill back and forth as we contemplated this. An entire presentation came and went before either of us could come up with an answer. Draco was the first to take a guess, though.
I adjusted my own tie as Harry blinked up at me. My cheeks had never been so hot, and he'd never looked more attractive. My eyes were drawn to his raw, red lips, but I forced my attention away.
My mind couldn't complete that thought. Wouldn't complete the thought. Couldn't comprehend that our feelings were mutual. I dropped my head onto the desk.
I grit my teeth. Malfoy pissed me off, but I couldn't deny her words were making sense. This would be for the best, and I couldn't just stop doing the right thing now that the war was over.
I attempted the transfiguration twice more before I was somewhat successful. Where his quill had transformed into a beautiful fern branch, mine became a shriveled sort of twig. I frowned at it as he snickered. My eyes rolled, but a grin threatened to disassemble my disappointment. Withdrawing a fresh quill, I finally responded to his last message.
Images of Dumbledore falling over the railing flashed behind Draco's eyelids and adrenaline seemed to shoot straight up his spine, sending his heart racing. He was suddenly aware of how crowded the hallways he was in was, and his legs started sprinting on their own.
My spine straightened as the answer found me. Draco’s intense curiosity turned to my face just as warmth spread through my cheeks. Hesitantly, I lowered my quill back to the surface of the page.
"Oh no, the killing curse does exactly what it says on the box." I watched him silently as he probably spoke about this for the first time out loud. "I spoke with Dumbledore."
Draco suddenly stood and pulled me behind himself, again shocking me by tearfully lunging toward Voldemort and serving his fist into his face.
I cast another compulsive glance at his stationary name marker on the map. Every instinct was telling me to go knock on his door.
My internal monologue was interrupted by Draco coming to sit beside me. His eyes were soft when I looked up at him, and my rage instantly dissipated. He smiled at me, and my heart swelled. Sinistra must've been uncharacteristically kind to him, and I suddenly wanted to hug the woman. He gestured for our note-passing paper, and I obliged.
"I'm torn between feeling like it's a cop-out to assign these kinds of projects, because what do we need a professor for if we'll just be teaching ourselves the material, and actually preferring this method. Learning things for myself seems to stick in my head better than just being told the information."
He was at the liquor cabinet several long moments as I emptied my glass of water. With shaker in hand, he turned back towards me.
"Never did get to that herbology project, either." He reclined on his bed, grinning at me shamelessly as my eyes strayed over his pale limbs. The damn flush that'd never really left my face warmed further as my eyes finally met his again.
‘Maybe a bigger bed? More pillows? Some mood lighting?’ As soon as my eyes scanned his shitty handwriting, he was writing more. ‘And if anyone casts a location charm on us, we’ll appear to be right where we’re meant to be.’
'We'll be holding hands in the halls and someone asks if we're a couple and we just say no? What gave you that idea?'
I grit my teeth. I was used to being the topic of gossip, but now that I'd fought in an actual WAR, my love life was still the focal point.
"Don't apologize. Thanks for… Telling me all that." Cautiously, I leaned in to kiss him once. "You know, it made no sense to me when you said we were similar, and our differences seem to grow more and more stark… But I'm starting to think, maybe you weren't entirely wrong."
I could barely concentrate on Flitwick's lecture with Harry stealing glances at me. I didn't give him the satisfaction of looking back, but at one point, the hole through the sheet of paper we'd been writing on clicked for me and I snatched it.
"Morning!" Hermione's overly perky greeting confirmed my suspicions, and Harry gave me a guilty smile. A groaning, ruffled Weasley joined us just then, and another round of '
I don't know what possessed me to actually take Draco's hand, but he hadn't taken his hand away yet. He seemed to be getting back to his normal self now, so
McGonagall pulled me aside as Ron, Hermione and I were leaving the Great Hall. I cast a glance at them, but aside from mild curiosity, they didn't seem to mind.
Once atop the tower, the whispers around us finally registered. Everywhere I looked, glances were cast at our clasped hands full of bewilderment, anger, even disgust. I felt my cheeks warm, but Harry just held on tighter. He tugged me toward the railing on the edge of class, leaning casually against the banister. I tried to mimic his nonchalance, but felt increasingly uneasy under the scrutiny of the entire class. However, Harry distracted me by leaning in to whisper in my ear,
“Right. It’s also just as important that you know what exactly has been introduced into the body, to properly counteract it.” As I continued on my explanation of which herbs were most effective in which kinds of antidotes, I felt Draco’s hand surreptitiously rest on my lower back. This contact seemed to suck my irritation out of me, just like the antidotes we were describing. My tense shoulders relaxed and the words coming from my mouth sounded less and less harsh by the minute. Somehow, we were able to sum up everything we’d painstakingly researched by the time our five minutes were up.
This fascinated and bewildered me. I used to love being the center of attention, but that was honestly just a way for me to conceal my insecurity. I was still insecure, but now that everyone had a reason to hate me, even the attention of someone who pissed me off so bad was like the sun breaking through the clouds.
Herbology started off with material I vaguely remembered, but with Hermione constantly nudging me to take notes, the information nestled in my memory a bit more firmly. Malfoy was at the back of the room now, and halfway through the lecture, I felt that same prickly feeling on the back of my neck, and had to force myself not to check if he was looking at me. What did I care?
His chest heaved slightly as he caught his breath, and my hand seemed to lift of its own accord to brush the backs of my fingers against his warm cheek. He smiled and pressed his face against my hand, lifting his opposite hand to take mine. In lieu of a reply, he offered me an expression I'd never seen on his face before. I watched, fascinated, as he gently opened my palm and invited my middle finger into his mouth. My own mouth fell slack at the wet warmth of his, and I felt my erection twitch.
If I was right, her conniving was more characteristic of a Slytherin, but I couldn't stay mad at her.
‘Of course’ came my immediate reply. Still, a certain caution invited my next response: ‘What did you have in mind?’
He looked up at me, finally, with trepidation in his eyes. I wasn't sure if I should push this subject, because I really wouldn't blame him if he wanted to run away again, but at the same time, I knew it would be to his ultimate benefit to go to all his classes. I saw his Adam's apple bob as he swallowed.
This thought sobered me. It was honestly frightening how quickly I stopped being able to imagine my life without him in it, but even more frightening was the thought of losing him.
"I realize what I'm asking, given your history, but if you're the one to accept him, I'm sure the others will fall in line."
My shower passed in a blur as I mentally braced myself for all the teasing I'd just bought myself, but my grimace couldn't affix itself to my face. I was too lost in thought about all that had happened overnight. Briefly, in the mirror after my shower, I lifted my cloaking spell to steal another glance at the blossoming red on the side of my neck.
I glanced at what he'd written and rolled my eyes, a grin creeping back into my face. Before I could respond though, he lowered his quill back to the paper.
"Does it feel like I'm sure?" He leaned in to whisper this against my lips, his fingers tight on my hips. Even though it was dark, I was sure he could see just how red my cheeks were as I nodded. His lips pressed against mine as he started walking us back to his bed, and my hands came up to cling to his shoulders. "Don't worry, I'll walk you through it," he assured as he slid back on the bed, taking one of my hands to usher me down between his legs.
Chuckling again, he sat back beside me. I took another mouthful of water as he sipped his drink and leaned his head back. His face took on such a serene expression as his eyes slipped closed, but I fought against the impulse to kiss him again.
Draco reached behind him and shut the water off. We stood there, dripping, for several tense moments.
We filed into Flitwick’s classroom just as everyone else was arriving, and found two desks beside each other against the far left wall of the room. The others purposefully avoided sitting too near us, but I found the whole situation rather hilarious.
Draco's exhalations became gradually more vocal, and I was again lost in fascination as I drew moan after moan from his lips.
didn't want to be alone with the two of them. Who knew how far they'd be willing to go on their "Rehabilitate Draco" train?
“For things like venom or some harmful serums, you only need to extract it, but for poison, it’s critical to have your antidote completely destroy it once it’s in the body. If you don’t want long-lasting side-effects, that is,” Draco chimed in.
so. She asked some pretty invasive questions this morning.' My eyebrows raised at this before this note disappeared, and Harry continued writing. 'As for why she is? I think' Here, Harry paused long enough for his writing to vanish. 'She feels responsible for my happiness. She's overly mothering, and I know she'd do anything for me.'
The posse of Gryffindors I’d ripped through had dispersed as several professors arrived at the scene.
“That wasn’t so bad, was it?” Draco whispered to me as the next pair began their presentation. My eyes rolled again, but I withdrew the journal page to respond.
I grimaced, not really wanting to enlighten him about what had transpired between classes. Still, I couldn't hide my irritation, so I felt I owed him an explanation.
Panic barely touched my heart, and the lights in his dorm room flickered. He glanced around at them before returning his grin to me.
“He’s already proven himself a million times over! How many wins has he brought Gryffindor already?”
Draco's other eyebrow raised, and he was stunned silent for a brief moment before we both descended into hysterics. Our laughter didn't subside for a good several minutes, until we were both wiping away tears.
The glance he shot at me made my heart skip a beat. When he spoke again, I struggled to hear him. "I-I think…" His Adam's apple bobbed in his slender throat as he swallowed. "It might actually work…"
always been a fighter." He set his empty glass on the floor before standing and approaching my chair, a confident grin settled onto his face. "What did you have in mind, Mister Potter?"
was a question I’d been meaning to ask, but I was almost certain his answer still wouldn’t convince me. A deliberating frown indented between his eyebrows as I slid the page back onto his desk. He took quite a while to formulate his response.
He flopped on the bed, throwing an arm over his eyes. Everything used to be so certain, and now nothing was.
I held the girl to me a moment longer as she seemed to calm down, before gently pulling her shoulders from my waist and looking her in the eye.
"I'm just saying, it might be intimidating for the first-years. Also, yes, the other teams wouldn't stand a chance."
As I moved down his collarbone, I made sure to kiss every scar I'd left on him as tenderly as I dared. Without even thinking about it, I briefly lowered my ear to his chest. His racing heart thudded loud in my ear, and I grinned before resuming down his torso. Once I reached his navel, a fine, silver fuzz greeted my lips, and panic surged through me.
of it all, I couldn't even picture myself letting him in, telling him about myself. What exactly would he even want to know? I didn't think I was that interesting of a person, honestly. And my past was a topic I'd really rather avoid…
Harry Potter was silently collecting his stray parchments and accoutrements. Harry fucking Potter. The Boy Who Lived himself.
We did, in fact, awake to an incontrovertible mess. As soon as consciousness found us, Draco groaned.
I was rewarded with a gentle chuckle in my ear. Our telescopes were spelled to further the distance of vision, and a planet came into view. I was about to mention it to Draco when he pulled my earlobe into his mouth.
“It’s so strange… In a matter of a few days, I’ve stopped being able to picture my life without you in it.”
"Excellent. I was worried I'd asked an impossible thing of you, but if you two can get along, I have hope for the future."
"Now THAT'S not fair. You had complete control over that dream, why should you assume I had anything to do with it?"
I actually took a fair amount of notes that class. Around the middle, though, I found myself staring down at my hand.
With careful movements, Draco stood and dropped his pajama pants and briefs. My eyes widened at the sight of him naked, but he was tugging my own pants and boxers down over my feet, and I exhaled shakily.
"I think… If we can dream together again, it might not… Be so bad. But I understand if you'd rather not risk it."
Reluctantly, I was keenly aware of Malfoy all throughout Potions. He seemed like he was having trouble staying awake, but there was a moment when it seemed like something startled him. I saw him tense from behind, but couldn't see anything that might've set him off. Not that I cared, anyway. I was more trying to get a read for how he would behave from now on.
My attention was torn between Harry and Slughorn for several minutes. His must've been torn, too, because eventually a sheet of parchment was slapped onto my desk.
His answering flush earned a grin from me as the rest of our year started filtering into the classroom. Harry withdrew his textbook and notes from his bag, and I followed suit.
Our welcome was a much more relaxed one than our first, but I barely touched my food, and of course Hermione noticed.
"I'll give you a choice, little Malfoy. Either kill Potter and survive, or refuse and I kill you both."
The first class of the year seemed to stretch painfully long, but once the bell tolled, Draco's relief was swiftly replaced with dread. He had sat the furthest from the door, but that meant he'd have to wait for everyone else to leave… Which, in turn, meant he'd be the last to their next class. He cursed his planning internally.
I cast a sideways glance at him with my next measured breath, and saw a small, reassuring smile in his eyes. The absurdity and irony of our current situation suddenly struck me. This was our first time back here together since…
that, by the end of the class, I unintentionally stormed out of the room, leaving Hermione to collect her (and Ron's) things and hastily follow after me.
I complied, and suddenly wished the fire would go out and the windows would close so Draco couldn't see my expressions anymore. When all that happened as I'd hoped, my eyes widened in surprise.
I remembered the exact moment Harry must've been talking about. I'd been considering - indeed, with great pleasure - the companionable activity we'd found ourselves doing. How simple a thing it was, working on a school project together, but for some reason it made me immensely happy. And when I'd glanced up to catch him staring at me, there was this look of rapt fascination on his face. I flushed with pleasure, again, as I glanced up at Harry's smiling face.
I immediately jumped to my feet to stand between him and Draco, which drew a malevolent laugh from Voldemort.
Hermione sent me over the edge. Draco's beet-red face in contrast to Seamus's sheet-white shock was just too funny. Even Ron couldn't resist as a snort ripped from his throat. Before long, we were crying into our dinners from laughing.
I looked up at him, only to see him pretending to flip through his textbook, an adorable pink staining his cheeks.
I tried to keep my face neutral as if I was paying attention to her lecture, but it was a struggle to keep a scathing glare off my face.
My hands were still acting on their own, and they flew up to seize Harry's throat. He didn't even flinch, though.
saying, if you even just showed up at tryouts tonight, you’d have your old position back, one hundred percent guarantee.”
For the first several minutes, we showered stoically, cleansing our bodies of the stickiness that clung to us, shampooing and conditioning our hair, sharing the water, until I was watching Draco wash his face with the soap the Room had provided.
A chill went down my spine as I considered the possibility that he used Dreamless Sleep as recklessly as I. I knew all about the side-effects that came with overuse - hallucinations, insomnia, mood swings - but didn't dare use Legillimens on him again. I knew how uncomfortably invasive it felt.
The memory of his skin against mine had my hands eagerly lifting his shirt up over his head, just as his legs came into contact with the bed. We'd broken away for a moment as it came up over his head, but I pulled back when he came to reconnect. His adorable pout changed to curiosity as I withdrew my wand from my pocket, connected it to the skin of his neck where I knew my love bite was, and uttered, '
My pace increased with renewed vigor as I gave myself over to my impulses. Shame and dignity were nowhere to be found as I pounded into him. Thankfully, toward our final moments, he took
Draco glanced up at me, and I realized I'd been staring. Instead of infringing on his privacy again, I reached into my bag and withdrew a certain journal I probably shouldn't be carrying around, and tore a page out of it.
“If I do play Quidditch again this year, then…” A pang of sorrow twisted my heart as I pictured Draco alone while I practiced, and he must’ve perceived.
"Is that so?" Harry glanced back at me now, and I wanted to beat my head against the wall to erase Rodolfo from my subconscious.
Now it was my turn to awkwardly drop my gaze. I traced the rim of my glass anxiously as he took several moments to respond.
"Not really. My father uses fear as a motivator, and I wouldn't have wanted him to target her any more because of me. It's his fault we drifted apart."
I whipped my face up, ready to make some biting comment back to Potter's stupid, pitying face, but saw no pity in his eyes. Instead, there was a kind of understanding that made my toes curl.
didn't think you were gay?" I internally cursed myself as I realized I'd just admitted to knowing something he'd only privately thought to himself.
"And about… Er… Everything else." His voice trailed off at the end, but I still couldn't believe what I was hearing.
Draco snatched the papers and quills out of Potter's hands and stood so suddenly, he felt woozy. The other boy stood more slowly, giving him an unreadable expression before turning on his heel and walking out. Draco was frozen for a few more moments, trying to process what just happened, before his feet started leading him to the infirmary on their own.
“So,” I cleared my throat. “We decided to research antidotes, and the different herbs that are used in them. It was all very medical, but basically, what we learned is that there are two types of antidotes: ones that bind to the poison or venom or what-have-you, and then are expelled from the body, and ones that attack the whatever and break it down.”
A look of awe overtook Draco’s curiosity as his eyes raked over my clumsily scrawled message. He turned this look up at me, and I shrugged. Snatching the page back, he replied with a short answer.
appreciate it if you'd give him a chance. I mean, don't you just feel bad for him now that he has no friends?"
I was surprised to find we'd woken up in the same position we'd last been in in his dream. The right side of my body was thrown over Draco, my head on his chest, as we both inhaled the morning air.
Once we were both confident that our project was ready for presentation, we packed up our things and left the library. We were still much earlier than the rest of the class, and we decided to descend to the courtyard to relax before Charms.
His mouth opened into a perfect O, and I imagined mine did the same as he filled me. Slowly, I came to settle all the way down on his hips. A groan slipped from my lips as he released the breath he'd been holding with a sigh. I grit my teeth as I adjusted, again, to the sensation. Remembering what I'd learned, though, I forced myself to relax. Once I did, I lifted myself up and dropped down.
