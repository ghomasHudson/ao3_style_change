He suppressed a content sigh, and waited until a kiss was dropped on his forehead, so light that he would miss it if not for the hot breath that followed after. He felt more movement around him, careful as if afraid that he would jolt up at any moment. The movement then stalled, followed by silence long enough to lure him to open his eyes. He almost did so, if not for the sudden sigh.
When they have taken their seats and distributed the drinks to their friends, Harry wrapped an arm around his boyfriend’s shoulder, giving a peck on his cheek before he softly whispered that only Draco can hear,
“Kill him, Malfoy!”
"-Then you know that I am the only one who can do this."
“What do you think they want from us?” asked Ron, pursing his lips in distaste but before any of them can answer, Malfoy has reached them.
"Come on, move over. You didn't mind if we shared this bed, right?"
Of course he doesn't, it took him a willpower to stop himself from going to Potter and kiss him as usual, but there was Ginny right next to him, placing him down his place.
They giggled.
Harry sighed heavily, feeling down that he won't have his kisses anymore. That is, unless he was the one who went to sought it himself-
He anxiously waited until his friends fell asleep before pulling out his Marauder's Map and conjured a small light just so he could look at that one specific name with a thunderous heart.
“Not even the colour or perhaps the title of the book?”
Draco smugly grinned as he put his hand on the man's shoulders, “And he was interested in me.”
The luck was on their side as the room was empty the moment they stepped in, though they were amazed to see the whole space clearly screamed a room shared by boys. As soon as their dad stepped out, Albus immediately went to guard the door claiming that he'd done a better job at guarding their dad which left Scorpius to search for their dad's Map, taking too much time for their dad's bed was messy, his things were literally everywhere.
"If you two were done flirting?"
The four Gryffindors and the two Slytherins have been on their separated way after they left papa's room, and naturally, they have followed their dad to the Gryffindor tower, claiming they were tired when they arrived at the common room, aware that the attention was instantly on them the moment they stepped inside the portrait hole. Their dad agreed, and led them to his shared room whilst his three friends waited in the common room to have more discussion as aunt Hermione had said. Albus repressed a grin when he saw uncle Ron's mortified face, poor him.
He choked a bitter laugh.
They have been watching the little family from afar; the man has taken the twins a little further than where they gather to ‘talk' but from where Harry can see, it was more of a scolding.
Draco nodded vigorously. “Exactly! And the patient is my middle name, Weasley. Unless Potter got himself falling in love with someone, I won't give up.” He stated firmly.
Seeing the bright faces managed to draw a smile from Harry. It was nice to see a change of event. Perhaps with this, Hogwarts will finally heal.
“Shut up, Zabini! No one asked your opinion!” Ron grumbled while the other man just shrugged casually. “You saw it yourself, Weasley. We've been sitting here for almost twenty minutes and not once did Potter talk or even glance at us.”
“I'm his husband!”
He was only met with silence.
Harry frowned, "What do you mean, professor?"
A soft pressure on his lips however, gently woke him up from his nap, but before he even managed to register what happened, the soft weight was gone. He was about to open his eyes but the sudden hot breath hovering his lips halted his action, and he discreetly breathed even and out to conceal his consciousness.
Harry exchanged amused looks with his friends when they witnessed the once gloomy Slytherins turned bright and cheerful. They have been practically laying low since the term has started; walking around like a kicked puppies, heads bent down instead of lifting them up proudly like they once did, and they were literally doing their best staying out of trouble.
“Well, it was not that hard to notice when one moment you were talking and the next it looked like you were making out with the air.”
Harry frowns as he unconsciously runs towards the crowd, pushing his way to the front when the scene in front of him almost send him into a heart attack.
“Papa, are you okay?”
Harry shook his head, "The curse was undetectable until it consumed cursed one's magic entirely."
?" asked Harry incredulously. Merlin, why were they talking about marriage all of a sudden?
"Well, he is. That's just his face."
“What do you mean he doesn't know?” asked Parkinson, completely bewildered.
“Indeed he is.” Potter says, caressing the small boy's head as he regards Draco once again. “I should probably head back now.”
A sudden shout from Malfoy tears Harry's gaze from the first year, and he quickly turns to see Dixon had his fist on the silver-white blond hair, reversing their position and pin Malfoy on the floor, eyes possessing wild looks. When he pulls his grip on Malfoy’s hair to knock his head on the floor, that's when Harry snaps out of his stupefaction.
Malfoy sniffed, and wrinkled his nose. His face flamed red, “Shut up, Blaise.”
Thus why Harry had taken his Invisibility Cloak during dinner. He wore them as he waited for Malfoy's arrival at the Gryffindor table, felt Hermione’s hand on him when the white-blond Slytherin finally made his way towards their own table with his friends, he noted that Malfoy discreetly brought his gaze towards them, pressing his lips when he didn't saw Harry which make him smirk in satisfaction. Gleefully, he watched as Malfoy took a seat with his back facing the Gryffindor's, attention grabbed by his friends particularly Par- Pansy who had agreed to his plan wholeheartedly when he went to see her earlier.
. Dear Merlin, he recognised this hand.
“How dare you!” scoffed Granger, “Let the man do what he wants.”
Draco turned his head to scan around. Indeed, their friends were rather busy with each other. He grimaced as Blaise practically had his tongue down to Pansy’s throat. He shuddered.
He positioned the arrow on the bow, taking a good stance to line up his body to his targets for easier yet effective shots. He pointed his first shot towards Ginevra, seeing as she was the one who pinned Harry to the wall and she got Draco’s approval for her action. He released the bow string, launching the arrow into full speed and landed cleanly on her. She pressed her body closer to Harry as a result, and Harry's grip on her waist tightened.
"Gryffindor." Malfoy muttered, and sighed. "Well, I am well and alive. You may go now, before Madam Promfey wakes up and sees you here."
‘What?’ He mouthed, but Ron just shrugged dismissively.
He knew he had said the wrong thing the moment those eyes went steel. "You're being incredibly selfish, Potter. We both know that I am the only one who can successfully sneak into the Palace!"
"I did not." said Draco, giving him a glare.
Draco’s heart decided to quicken their beats at the simple gesture. He covered it up with winks, “I surely will, Love.”
Draco Malfoy was the type of person who will make sure that his presence was known by his crush. He wanted his crush to acknowledge him, to make sure he knew him and to be aware of him.
Malfoy quirk his lips, just slightly. "Magic words."
“I think he's on glamour.” whispered Hermione, slipping in between Harry and Ron.
It took a moment of staring when his twins suddenly squeaked and tightened their grip on Draco.
Their younger dad stopped at that, blinking at Albus in a questioning manner as he asked, "Where's Scorpius?"
Sounds of clapping hands grabbed his attention and he looked up to see the rest of the Malfoy's gang were there, watching their interaction with great interest. Harry merely raised an eyebrow, but didn't move a muscle while Malfoy let out a dying sound at the back of his throat.
"Precisely, Harry." agreed McGonagall. "I am certain that you can recall Draco’s health during his pregnancy?"
"Did you know that one time when Albus and Scorpius were three," began Harry, waiting until he had Draco’s attention and continued once he was. "They- hm nevermind."
Not at all.
Potter suddenly huffed, and reached out a hand to pull Draco towards him, and place a kiss to his cheek instead.
“They were too busy being intelligent and searching for complex solutions!” cried Albus, and Scorpius facepalm, giving up of his brother's manner. “Papa is getting weaker by the day and it's only a matter of time for his body to shut down!”
The witch sighs eventually as her eyes turn thankful. She smiled apologetically at Draco as she carefully hands the baby over to Draco. “Yes, please. Thank you.”
He proceeded with telling Harry that they were originally just wanted to give the chocolate to the Slytherin students to lift their spirit, but then they decided it was better to include their house in their plan and change their target to the other three houses seeing that Hogwarts practically dead when the students acted like the castle itself brought them misery. "Besides," said Draco with a little smirk. "It was good to restore our image."
“Wha- you told us they were adopted!” shrieked Parkinson while Hermione quickly gathered back her wits, “Traveled back in time?”
“You love me more.” Potter frowned in disapproval and Draco sniffed haughtily, “I don't know, Potter.”
Augustine Dixon was a bad news. He was a transfer student from Dumstrang, and since he arrived, he has brought terror to the students, as if it was his vow to make the Hogwarts students suffers - much to Harry's chagrin.
“Malfoy,” Potter began, “You don't have to stay away.”
"Harry!" beamed Ginny once she stood in front of him and Harry blinked up at her in perplexity.
Draco narrowed his eyes at that. He doesn't need to know what kind of books he'd owned in the future, but he definitely knows a guilty face when he sees one.
“Come on, that's bollocks!” groaned Parkinson.
“Albus, look! It's papa!” He exclaimed and his brother immediately followed his pointed finger. Albus widened his eyes and let out a delighted shriek making Scorpius laugh.
Harry gave Malfoy another heart soaring kiss before he pulled back, and breathed heavily as he took a look at Malfoy and couldn't help but stared at him in awed. Malfoy has his head rested on the wall, face flushed attractively as he closed his eyes, chest moved rapidly to catch his breath. His hand that was connected to Malfoy's hair moved down to his nape, caressing the baby strands and he leaned forward again to peck the red swollen lips. Malfoy opened his eyes at that and Harry smiled.
“Can't we just go to the future, bring things from there then send Albus and Scorpius back along with your blood?” asked Potter innocently, and Draco was not sure if he wanted to pat his head or give them a good whack.
It was after dinner, and Harry can't believe that they had spent their day mostly in Malfoy’s room.
“Thank you for having a crush on me. Now, let me have a crush on you too.”
“Of course,” said a small haughty voice all of a sudden, “Merlin forbids Harry Potter to keep secrets from his friends.”
He let the time pass by; not thinking particularly, just having a moment of his own. It's not everyday that he has the privilege of enjoying a peaceful time like this, so he will take this opportunity to the fullest.
He didn't mean to say that out loud.
"You wish." Harry playfully shoved the Irishman, "Go take a shower now, you stink."
As soon as the words came out, Draco slapped a hand to his mouth, widening his eyes in horror.
McGonagall said nothing, but put her attention on her cup as she delicately brought it up to her and took a small sip. Harry patiently watched as the Headmistress placed down her cup gently, brows slightly frowning as she seemingly in a deep thought. Harry unconsciously held a breath when McGonagall brought her gaze to him, frown ceased from her face but she still appeared serious.
"What are we going to do now?" asked Scorpius.
"All of us didn't get any." Neville piped in from his bed. "You know the Slytherins gave them away at breakfast, and we were late this morning."
Harry looked up to see Malfoy already in a sitting position, looking down on him with lips curling as if he was trying to repress a forming smile. He gave an unsure smile of his own, scratching his head as he greeted the white-blond haired man.
Scorpius, on his part, immediately moved and continued his mission, trying hard to make sure he found it before their dad now that he was looking for it too, just like what their older dad had predicted. If he found it first, and looked into the Map, their older dad's identity will be revealed and it causes more problems than necessary.
“Headmistress, we've heard from the healer that there was no solution for papa’s curse because it was an old curse." explained Albus. "We tried to help by reading books about curses and Scorpius found one solution which involved papa’s virgin blood. That was the reason why we're here.” said Albus firmly, his eyes determined as they met McGonagall’s.
“Right,” said Ron, “I forgot that they were with McGonagall first.”
"Magic words?" asked Leo, tilting his head as he looked up to his brother with a perplexity.
“Never mind him.” Ginevra jumped in, “I have never met you officially. Hello, I'm Ginny.” She smiled, holding out a hand and Draco took it and gave them a shake, “Draco Malfoy.” He nodded.
“Of course not, Harry, but I don't think he knows.” said Hermione softly. “Slytherin was kind of shunned since the term started, it was only because of the chocolates that things seemed to get a little bit better.”
They waited until the door was closed, and let a few minutes passed by before they opened their eyes and looked at each other.
“Dad, You're being ridiculous!” Albus giggled, and Henry snorted, “Shut up, brat. This is your fault.”
“Albus, Scorpius! Come, let's eat!” called Ginny, and the twins immediately perks up at that.
When Harry had asked why they were given an applause much later when they were wrapped around each other in Draco’s bed, the white-blond haired man snorted and rolled his eyes as he said; "They were thankful that I have restored our house's image by dating you, the bloody Saviour."
Albus nodded, “You keep that book along with other fancies looking books, you said the books are a forbidden knowledge for little children.”
Five years in, and he-
The man nodded and gave a slow smirk, “Want to make it even more graceful for tonight?”
A few steps away as they walked, Granger suddenly stopped on her track, and Draco nearly slammed into her. The woman turned to him, knotting her brows as she looked at him with a determined look on her face.
Together, they gathered the possessions in a center, making sure everything was in place before they stood facing each other in between the piles. “Wands ready?”
"You are, don't deny it. You're desperately wanting one right now."
Draco suddenly heard a high pitched shouts, before another pair of small arms wrapped around his shoulder, “I want to use Papa’s wand too!”
"Yes, but how did Dean get one?"
Hermione and Leo nodded in approval.
Draco watched him go, stunned. But he can’t fight the warm feelings spreading through his chest.
A gasp was heard above him when Harry decided to deepen the kiss by sneaking his tongue in and he mentally noted of the voice that definitely wasn't a girl but Harry was far too gone for the soft lips to even be bothered with it.
The whispering continued, and Harry quickly recognised one as Seamus. He promptly recalled that the Irishman went out just before everyone went to sleep, claiming that he was going to spend his night somewhere in the castle. It didn't make sense to Harry at the time, but now, he understood why.
"You were having twins, Harry," McGonagall words snapped Harry out of this thought as he focused his attention back on the Headmistress. "Their combined magic can easily cover up the curse, as well as slowing the process of magic consumption done by the curse. It was the exact reason why the curse was not detected during his pregnancy."
“I think it was because of his house,” said Hermione.
“I haven't seen you around, lately.” said Potter, when there was only silence between them.
But Draco doesn't stop, he can't stop because he can't bear the thought of Potter rejecting him right on his face.
And yet, in a blink of an eye, his world was turned upside down.
“Yes, Draco.” said Henry, before he took a deep breath - with the familiarity that Draco can't put a finger to - and locked his earnest green eyes with Draco. “Do you trust me?”
“What?” said Harry, defensively. “Just look at them!” He pointed, “Look at them and tell me you didn't feel the same.”
“That's just insulting!” Ron squared up, “You Slytherin can't be trusted! He might've Imperius that poor bloke!”
Henry's voice called and they turned to him simultaneously. The older man has already leant against the wall, assessing both of them with a bored look.
Adopt a son.
Harry can't help but chuckled seeing the boy's enthusiasm, and reached out to pat the boy's shoulder.
Harry narrowed his eyes at the dry comment before he rolled them. "Malfoy, if you must know, I'm not pleased to have you as my pretend boyfriend as well."
“Brilliant! Now that everyone settles down.” said Malfoy all of a sudden, clasping his hands together and taking his seat next to Albus. The boy instantly latched himself to his father, mumbling apologies with his face buried in his robes. Malfoy replied his forgiveness in a hushed words, kissing the top of the boy's head lovingly.
She nodded at something behind him and he turned to see Malfoy walking towards them. Just meters away behind him were Zabini and Parkinson, following his pace with Malfoy’s twins each on their side.
It has been a week since Weasley's little sister transferred from her last university. And since then, Potter seemed to be hooked by her existence.
"Whatever you say, lover boy." Seamus winked, and proceeded to the bathroom with Dean and Neville on his tail.
"Cuddle," said Harry, "I want a cuddle."
"I see," said Harry. "I really need to pay attention to what the Healer and Hermione have been saying to me." Harry rubbed his face, a bit frustrated with his ignorance.
"You don't have to worry," said Albus, tugging his hand and smiled when Harry looked down to him as they walked behind the others. "You can trust our dad, he won't do anything unpleasant to papa."
"You haven't told me about your inspection on my person."
"Oh, this little arrow?" asked Harry innocently, and made a show of giving it a thought before he snapped the arrow into two with a smirk, successfully managed to plant a seed of fear inside Draco. The arrow was a sacred, unbreakable tool and Harry just destroyed it with his bare hand.
“Now, Weasley!” He barked in authority, making everyone jump.
“Boys.” The man slowly spoke in a deep voice that sent chills up to Draco’s spine. He gulped.
Harry breathlessly chuckled, knowing it was Draco’s tactic to distract him and of course he succeeded.
Henry chuckled as he stepped forward to extend his hand, “Harry Potter, I assumed?”
“Bloody hell, mate.” Ron commented, “Did someone shrink the Slytherins?”
“I can't believe you really did travel back in time.” Zabini shook his head, curling his lips in amusement.
McGonagall tried to suppress her smile seeing the familiar expression of the child in front of her. “And how sure are both of you of your father's virgin identity?”
“Are those Slytherin uniforms?” asked Ginny with bewilderment, asking no one in particular.
Potter laughed out loud, amused, while Weasley groaned next to him. “Come on! I'm trying to eat here!”
"Salazar, fine!" The voice on his side hissed back at the door before he turned back to Harry. "I guess it's a good bye now. I'll… see you around. Don't miss me too much, though I doubt you will. Have a good sleep."
"Why didn't I get any?"
“Not so bad yourself, Malfoy.” greeted Potter back, giving Draco those boyish smiles of his as he quickly set down the box to open it. Draco grinned despite the dragons swirling inside his stomach. He took an empty seat next to Weasley and placed down his lunch, not forgetting to greet him and Granger too.
He blinked at the scene.
“Alright,” said Potter suddenly, clasping his hands on his knees as he looked at Draco. “I want to know your plan about your blood.”
“Stop it!” Ginny hissed. “Here they come.”
“Come on, Harry.” called Hermione, as she waited at the door along with the others. “Perhaps there was something that Henry needed to discuss with Draco.”
“Very handsome, here!”
It can only mean one thing, right?
“Papa’s 18 year old photo?”
"Yes, professor." sighed Harry, reaching out his hair and ran his fingers through his locks, trying to tame down his frustrations."I just- it's really hard for me to think that he suffered years, unknown of the curse that was placed on him."
Draco gave a firm nod at that, biting his lips when he saw Potter knitted his brows together in deep thought. “Do you have anything in mind?”
Draco felt his sight getting blurry, and his breath quickened. He then felt someone’s hand on his cheek. “Malfoy, look at me!”
“I don't think you see the point here, Potter.” Draco says distantly. “I'm asking you to fucking set that prick up to his place. Do you think I will just sit there, doing nothing when he and his fucking minions bullied other students, hexing them into oblivion?”
“I can tell that both of you have been sneaking around behind your dad.” said Zabini, giving the twins an approving wink.
Draco bit back a smile, as he pushed Potter away. “I will try for as long as you're available.”
"Do you trust me?"
Albus?!
“I think you're late for your next class.”
That one peculiar day did.
He followed Seamus when he went to meet Parkinson despite having his eyes trained on him with amusement. Even worse when Parkinson smiled at him like a cheshire cat, enough to give him goosebumps. It took a few moments of awkwardness standing next to the two students that Harry finally got the courage to ask about Malfoy.
He ran his fingers through his hair, “My sons, from the future.” He let out a shaky breath, and felt blank somehow. As if the valves that were connecting his brain short circuited by the sudden information, and they just simply stopped working.
- that led to Malfoy scolding Albus for being rude but it managed to seal Ron's mouth shut and thus, they managed to come up with a plan.
Malfoy’s shirt was dirty, signs that he's been down on the floor quite much, his buttoned shirt was open up to his chest showing those pale skin, and his hair was wild - long gone the perfect style hair. The look on his face was quite dangerous, Harry never saw it before, not even when it was them that was in a fight.
Henry shook his head slowly and gave him a fond smile, “You always know what to say, I can't even disagree with them.”
Usually, the sight of the heart shaped chocolates managed to make his day. Now, knowing that there won't be kisses accompanying these chocolates anymore, Harry doesn't feel like eating one; let alone touch them. It felt incomplete, because those kisses were what made these chocolates ten times tastier.
Harry made a face, though he didn't deny his friends' accusation because it was the truth. He straightened up when something occurred to him. "Wait, wait. You said Ginny saw him using the charm and the chocolates when she went to see Malfoy. That was ages ago!"
Harry’s magic instantly disappear into thin air at the words. He stares at his boyfriend’s distant face with a surprised look, as his words managed to put Harry on his place.
Both Albus and Scorpius promptly turn their gaze at their father. He looked rather shocked, speechless, and seemed to be unable to utter any words apart from having his wild gaze on them.
“Perhaps,” Potter shrugged playfully, “You've been very good to him, from what I've heard.”
Harry agreed, he had seen it himself and it was a pretty wicked thing to see a perfect Disillusionment Charm, and to think that Malfoy had the audacity to perform it in front of him just to get away from him was pretty endearing. However, that doesn't really explain anything, he looked at Hermione in confusion making the bushy haired girl roll her eyes at him.
Malfoy turned around, raising his head as his eyes widened in an instant the moment they met Harry's. With a smirk as a warning, Harry cradled Malfoy's face with both hands, and stooped down to capture Malfoy's lips in his. He moved his lips against him, trying hard to keep it as innocent as possible without getting their tongues involved. He felt Malfoy's hand placed on his chest after a moment, regrettably pulled away when Malfoy gave him a gentle push.
He smirked when Draco turned into a pretty pink and gave him a chaste kiss on his lips. He then moved to reach out the tray of drinks with one hand, as he locked his other hand to Draco and led them to their awaiting friends.
He was just laying underneath a cherry tree where he usually went, for it was a bit further from the castle as well as it was hidden from the view of other students. He took his usual spot, putting his hands behind the back of his head as a pillow and not a moment later, he drifted off to sleep.
Doesn't mean he was in love with him.
That made Potter promptly turned to him and frowned hard. “Was that what makes you stay away?”
“We performed the ritual ourselves!” said Scorpius smugly, lifting his chin upwards that made him look like a tiny Malfoy.
“Well, I say truce for now,” Ginny announced, picking up her pumpkin juice. “We don't want Albus and Scorpius to get scared every time they sit with us.”
“Yes! Why don't you find yourself some girls for tonight, hm?”
He chuckled when Ron and Hermione dropped their jaw in unison which soon followed by Hermione when Ron twisted his face in comical confusion.
"You too, sweetheart." reminded Draco, lifting Harry's hand that was holding him and gave a chaste kiss on his knuckles. He let go and Harry watched with a heavy heart as Draco walked towards Ginny, taking the equipment that was handed to him from the General. With a parting glance, Draco and Ginny disappeared into black mist.
He saw Potter shrugged, glancing at She Weasley in a brief moment. Draco bit his lips at that, nodding slowly. Of course, Potter got her by his side. Besides, he's the Saviour of the Wizarding World. He can get anyone he wants.
Fuck.
Harry could see nodded from the others, and felt himself nodding as well. He has been meaning to ask himself and now he was sure that everyone has been wanting to ask the same question.
Draco sighed as he followed his two friends’ step into the cold night. He doesn't know what he was doing, going for an unrequited love like that.
“I think I need a moment.” Draco breathed heavily and closed his eyes, mindlessly waved his hand around for a seat but a small hand caught his hand and led him to sit.
"But it was my fault!" came the voice of his younger self. "I could've killed you!"
“By five minutes!”
Other than that, they did talk. Talked that it was Draco’s friends who have been encouraging him to test his luck on Harry, seeing as he has been harbouring his crush since forever. Harry delightfully noted that Malfoy went as red as a ripe tomato when he said it. Harry teased him at first, but he decided to spare him and told Draco that if he hadn't acted, Harry would have never realised his feelings towards Draco. He thanked Draco by pressing his lips against him, pleased to see the pale cheeks flushed beautifully.
"For the love of Merlin, snap out of yourself, Potter!"
“Yea, well,” Albus shrugged, “It's papa.”
Their younger dad smiled even as his face was dreaded with worry. "Alright, there was an old parchment somewhere and we need to find it. Can you do that?"
Malfoy sighed, ghosting his breath on Harry's lips. "I- Potter, you have shown me kindness when I have taken an advantage on you."
“Oh, I bet I tasted good!” Draco wiggled his eyebrows and Harry snorted out a laugh, shaking his head at Draco’s ridiculous face. “You are, Sweetheart.”
"Hey!" said Harry, protesting. "I just want to make sure you were fine."
Now they acted like lovers who were newly formed. Harry snorted, "So, may I ask why Malfoy was half naked?"
He had his face facing the open window, hands lose in between his parted legs. Permanent scowl written on his injured face. There was a nasty bruise around his right eye, a cut on the bridge of his nose, on his lips, and on his eyebrow. Each decorated with dried blood. Harry gaze down to his hand to see his knuckles were decorated with blood too, must be Dixon's.
"I can help!" offered Albus, too eager for his own good.
He was woken up by kisses earlier that morning with a fresh looking Draco who already had his uniform on, ready to start the day. He let Draco dragged him back to the Gryffindor tower, left Harry in front of the portrait with a kiss and promised that they'll see each other on breakfast.
“I was just about to explain to the Headmistress about our situation when you arrived.” said Scorpius, silently asking Albus with his eyes. When Albus nodded, Scorpius turned his attention towards Headmistress McGonagall and smiled confidently.
“Oh, do tell!” Harry growled, “I saw you two with my own two eyes! You got him naked for you!”
“I need a moment.” said Draco, holding up a finger as he continued to look up at Potter's agitated face.
It was him.
“He doesn't believe that, you can stop now.” Blaise chuckled, giving Draco a smirk.
"You're bluffing, right?"
Henry bit his lips as he regarded Draco, and shrugged easily. “Well, I need to check your body actually.”
He decided to play dumb, and narrowed his eyes at them. “I don't understand why all of you are too fascinated with Malfoy’s husband.”
He waited patiently until he felt the same soft pressure against his lips again, a faint pleasant smell of sweet - like vanilla - invaded Harry's nose that got him to curved his lips in a lazy smile just in time to catch the lips against him in an open mouth kiss.
“What?” Harry snapped, reluctantly tore his gaze off Malfoy to look at Henry who had his eyes trained on the both of them with a slight resignation on his face.
Oh Heavens, if his colleagues saw the way he pathetically begged for his life, his reputation would drop much quicker than getting demoted to a lower rank.
Draco slowly turns only to see a person that he hasn't seen for almost a decade since after the war. He silently regards the other man, not sure with himself if he was truly him seeing that he looks different from the last time Draco saw him.
"Harry here tried to set luck with his forbidden lover." said Seamus, grinning.
“But what about Ginny?” He can't help but ask.
His three friends looked at one another with the same confused look upon their faces, but decided to humour Harry and followed the direction of where Harry has pointed out to see the two boys were whispering with each other; the black haired boy mindlessly gestured to their table. After exchanging a few more whispers, the black haired boy looked at their table again, this time followed by the white-blond haired boy. They shared a look full of mischief, locking their eyes to Harry and
He continues to rock the baby gently in his arms, softly sings the nursery rhyme - now that he manages to recall - that was sung to him when he was a child himself.
“You're-” Weasley pointed at him shakily, and Draco frowned at the git, somehow nervous by his reaction. “I'm what?”
"I am happy."
I frowned at him. So he wanted me to spell it out to him. Probably already knows, just wants me to say it out loud, confess it, and confirm his suspicions. Time for some truth I guess."I know you might have thought that I hated Draco. I never did. He was only my rival because he took the refusal of my handshake as some huge slight against him and held it against. I always got pulled into fights with him by Ron or got too hot headed when he struck a nerve, but I never really wanted to be his rival. I don't want to be his enemy. I like him a lot. More than I should. I have had the hugest crush on him for the past three years. It hasn't got away. I don't know what to do because it's getting worse and I get jealous every time he brings someone home. It hurts. Please Dad, help me."
“Dong!” said the clock.
"Thanks guys."
“I know, Mother,” said the Prince.  Yet he knew something was wrong. He had met many of the young men.  Yet after he said “hello,” one by one, he could find nothing more to say.
"What?! No you aren't," I tried to deny.
Over at the ball, the Prince did not know what to think.  “Why do you have that sad look on your face?” the Queen said to her son.  “Look around you! You could not ask for finer bachelors than these.”
"Oh. Oh my god." She gasped.
While at Gringotts Harry took up all of his titles. There were a lot! He was now rich several times over. He was also now Lord Harrison James Potter-Black-Peverell-Emrys-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Lefay. He could not believe that he could now basically run the Wizengamot with votes. For the first time he was elated to know he could change the world for the better. Not the way Voldemort or Dumbledore tried to do, but make real change.
As he sat down, he started talking. "I was hoping that you would allow me to be in Ren's life."
"I needed to do something different. Find my own way. Do something unexpected. There is nothing holding me here. Why do you care?"
Harry smiled. "I couldn't ask for anything better."
"As I thought. If you allow me to come with you, I shall tell you where his hideout is."
When Dumbledore entered the Wizengamot, I could see he disliked seeing me there. I knew he would try to bring me trouble, but I was rightfully where I belonged. He was not.
Blaise would touch me whenever Draco was near. He kissed me and spent dinners at the manor with me. We even went out on several "dates."
"Am I dreaming?"
"I feel…relieved. I feel like I can finally be myself for the first time in my life. And I feel hopeful, that this is going to make it easier for other gay witches and wizards to accept themselves. I hope it will make life easier for someone else; if it does, even for one person, then this is more than worth it.”
I have everything planned the morning of Christmas we enjoyed opening presents with Lucius and my dad. Then I gave Draco a special portkey that I had made that would take us to one of the Malfoy cabins, I approved it first with Lucius and Dad.
But all the Prince could see was Harry.  They laughed and talked, and they danced some more.  In fact, they danced for so long that Harry did not see the clock.
Draco was staring at the morning paper in shock. There was a picture of Harry and a baby. This baby looked like him! He didn't even read the article. He knew it was his child. Why didn't Harry tell him? Draco could rationalize that maybe Harry didn't want a relationship with Draco because Draco was the one who told Harry it could only be a one night stand. He was betrothed. He had to marry Astoria. Even if he wasn't in love with her. They had an arrangement. She knew he was gay and that was fine with her, she was too. They had agreed to have side lovers, but married to keep their parents happy and to produce an heir. But now, he did have an heir and he loved Harry, but he was married to Astoria. He didn't know what to do.
"Then I must go." The Prince proclaimed.
"Okay so about a couple months ago I had a one-night stand with a man. I am in love with him, but unfortunately he does not feel the same," I took a pause they seemed to take that information alright, I took a deep breath and continued, "And lately I had been sick and feeling off, so this morning I went to St. Mungo's and found out that I am pregnant."
I slowly nodded. "I'm sorry. I just- I'm what?!!"
Draco came back in and Harry smiled at him. Draco handed him a coffee and took his back to his desk. Harry watched him the whole time, never taking his eyes off the blond. Hermione watched this whole exchange and finally realized why Harry had rejected all those dates.
"Not that it is any of your business, but I am single. I am open to opportunities that might come my way."
"You traitor!" Harry yelled.
I am trapped. I am trapped.
Ugh this was not going to go well at all. I knew it would only be a matter of time before it would all blow up in my face. I was secretly pining after Draco my former rival who hated my guts.
I was shocked. I didn't know how to respond, luckily or unluckily at that moment Ren decided to wake up. I looked at Draco apologetically and then asked, "would you like to meet your son?"
I then went to my dad and explained everything that happened. "I can't do this anymore Dad. I can't be here anymore. I broke things off with Blaise, not that they were real anyway, but whatever. I just need to leave. I am so humiliated. He will never want me. And to make things worse, I have fallen in love with him."
"Oh you know 'Mione. She was just upset because she thinks I am not happy or whatever without having someone to share my life with. She's just being intrusive in my love life again. That is all."
Things had been going great for the past five years. Harry worked hard and still saw his friends. Ron and Hermione had married and now had a daughter named Rose. Harry was happy. He worked well with Draco. They made a great Auror team. They solved the most cases and brought in the most former death eaters. They were friends now, Harry was even friends with Astoria, which made his love life kind of sad. He knew that all he had to do was let Draco go, but he just couldn't. He couldn't fall out of love with him. He couldn't even date because of the Ministry.
Severus stared at him in shock. "You can get rid of my mark?"
"For that I am truly sorry. Harry. I only meant to stop Blaise from defiling you. I wanted to protect you and be where Blaise was at the same moment. I have no excuse. Are you willing to give me a chance? Give us a chance?"
“None who matter!” said Petunia in a hiss.
"I love you too," he replied, "I love both of you."
"All in favor?" Kingsley asked. Many of the Wizengamot put their wand up.
Blaise and I had been fake dating for months now. Lucius had finally stepped in and stopped Draco from bringing random dates home. Draco threw a tantrum and asked "What about Harry?" Which Lucius responded with "At least Harry is dating one guy consistently and Blaise is at least a nice respectful boy whom he knows." Draco didn't have anything to say after that. Though he did try to date one guy that didn't last long. He tried to make me jealous. He even tried flirting with Blaise. Nothing worked.
"Hi Harry," Hermione replied.
"Are you out of your mind?! No! First of all he's getting married to a woman, whom I like. Second of all how am I supposed to be with him if I tell him how I feel?" He yelled thankful for the silencing bubble he put up.
“Dong!” called the clock.
Hadrian woke up next to a warm body, forgetting that Draco let him sleep with him. “Morning Hades.” Draco said sleepy, causing Hadrian to smile. “Morning, Dray. Ready for class?” By the time he asked the question, Draco was fast asleep again. Hadrian rolled his eyes and tried to shake Draco out of sleepiness. “Draco. Wake up, wake up, wake up! Come on.” When shaking him softly did not work, Hadrian pushed him off the bed. Draco fell on the floor with a loud thump. “Ow! What the heck, Hades? I just wanted five more minutes. I know that you are not a morning person either, so why did you have to push me off my bed?” Draco groaned at him. “Last night, didn’t you say that you wanted to hear the story of my expedition in the morning? Well, it’s morning, and it's time to hear it. Now, wake up!” Hadrian reminded him. Draco rubbed the side he fell on and stretched out. He sat back on the bed and let Hadrian tell him of his adventure. “...and after I ripped his heart out, I sliced off his head! It was so bloody! I don’t know if you remember what my robes looked like last night, but they were caked in blood. Here, let me show you.” Hadrian grabbed his robe that he hung out to dry last night. The blood from last night’s killing was still there, but it turned into a darker red and made the cloth turn crusty. Hadrian held up his robes like a trophy. Draco examined it in astonishment. “That is a lot of blood. I’m glad that the Weasley boy had suffered as much as you said. You better go wash it out, though. We have classes today.” Hadrian shook the robes out like that would instantly get rid of the blood. “I am...but not all of it. I have a plan to scare the Gryffindors out of their wits.” Hadrian started to clean up some of the blood that was on his clothes, mostly the big patches that made the stains really stand out. He left in the rest to get his point across. He put on his bloodstained robes on top of his uniform and smoothed it out. “How do I look?” he asked his mate. Draco hesitated, trying to find out what to say. “You look...uh...cool? Scary? Evil? I don’t really know what you are trying to do with the bloodstains.” Hadrian told him of his scare tactic that he planned for the Gryffindors. Now that Draco knew, he gave his appropriate decision. “Well, since the Gryffindors will be shaking in their boots, I think it will give you a menacing look. That plan will probably get them off our backs so we can focus on Dumbledore.” Hadrian nodded. He linked arms with Draco and they headed downstairs. They met up with the girls so they could go to the Great Hall for breakfast. Violet was the last one to head down. Her robes were now of a Slytherin’s. The Gryffindor crest disappeared from her robes and was replaced with the Slytherin serpent. The usual red and golden pattern now shined with a fresh green and silver. She descended downstairs, her mushroom beanie bouncing in the wake. “I’m officially a Slytherin now!” she declared with her hands high in the sky. “Greetings, fellow Slytherins. I sure do like hanging out with other Slytherins because those Slytherins are my best friends.” Violet hugged her new friends into a group hug. Draco, as per usual, tried to squirm out of it. When they broke out of the hug, Violet twirled around in her new robes. “Do I look good? Do I give off that Slytherin vibe?” she asked them. Valorie looked her over, seeing if she was able to walk the Slytherin walk. “Well, you certainly look and act like one of us. You’ll fit in great with the others, Vio.” Violet smiled at her new nickname. Hadrian stepped in. “Well, now that Violet is officially one of us, I think we should head along to the Great Hall.” The five of them walked to the Great Hall. The crowd heading there was big. It took away Hadrian's flare to show off his bloodstained uniform to the Gryffindors. Students were filing in, ready to start another day of school. Hadrian and the others took their place at their respective table. Once all the students and teachers were in the Great Hall, Dumbledore grabbed everyone’s attention. “As you all know, we lost a professor. Professor Moody was taken from us and we had to cease our Defense Against the Dark Arts classes. Now, we have someone here to take that position in our faculty. You have met him before and I hope that you treat him with the same respect as you did last year. I present to you, Professor Lupin! The Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.” Remus walked in after Dumbledore’s introduction. He got a big welcome from the students, particularly from Remy and her friends. Remus took his place at the table, sitting in between Severus and Professor Karkaroff. Dumbledore nodded at Remus and Remus smiled back. “Thank you for giving Professor Lupin that warm welcome. We are very pleased to have you back, Professor. Now that we are done with introductions, it’s time for breakfast. Enjoy!” Breakfast appeared on the tables. Violet dug into her food. She noticed that the others were barely grabbing anything. “Hey, why aren’t you eating? You barely touch your food. Is something wrong?” she asked while slathering honey butter on a currant cake. “We don’t really want to eat anything that Dumbledore gives us. So, we eat the bare minimum so no one gets suspicious and that we don’t die from starvation,” Hadrian explained to her. Violet shrugged, taking a helping of baked eggs with cheese and mushrooms. The food tasted great to her. Better than her Gran’s cooking. “Suit yourself,” she told them. Hadrian pushed his food around for a little bit and noticed Remy staring at the teacher’s table. “Remy? Remy!” Hadrian tried to grab his friend’s attention. The occupied girl got her head out of her thoughts and focused on Hadrian. “What?! What? I’m listening,” Remy jolted. “Sorry, it’s just, I want to go to my mother. I want to give him a hug and tell him about my day. And I can’t…” Violet took a sip of her vanilla milk. “So, why don’t you go over to him? He’s right there. Your mother is Professor Lupin, right?” Remy nodded her head. “Mmm-hmm. But, it’s not as simple as you think. I can’t just walk over to him and tell him that I was so worried and that I missed him dearly. I just wish that there was a story that could explain to me how much I hate Dumbledore.” Just as she made that wish, a giant wad of paper plopped down on her head. “Seriously?! Darn you, owls!” Remy picked it up off the table and unraveled the parchment that unceremoniously hit her head. The latest paper of The Daily Prophet was in her hands. In the center of the paper, there was a picture of her and Hadrian as their former selves. A picture of Mad-Eye Moody was there like a little side note, scowling at the reader like he had nothing better to do. Remy became intrigued and started to read the paper aloud to her friends:

Alira unwillingly stumbled into the Potions classroom. As she entered, a wave of fear washed over her. She saw the Dark Lord himself, Tom Riddle, kneeling over a fire grate. Looking closely, she saw a face in the fire. She recognized it as Lucius Malfoy, Malfoy’s father and one of the Dark Lord’s most powerful Death Eaters. Sitting at a potions table was Headmaster Karkaroff of Durmstrang. Alira remembered hearing whispers from Ron that he used to be a Death Eater before being convicted to Azkaban by Dumbledore. With the three of them present in the room, she had no doubt that they were plotting the downfall of Hogwarts and the ‘impures’ of wizard kind. Tom got up from his spot and walked over to the center of the room, trying to make sense of the spectacle. Severus joined him at his side. Hadrian led her in front of them both, with her trying to squirm away. He swiftly kicked the back of her legs, her knees buckling and forcing her to the ground. “Kneel! You are in the presence of Tom and Severus Riddle, the King and Queen of Darkness.” Alira internally gasped at the revelation. She remembered reading about the King and Queen of Darkness in her studies. They were extremely powerful and influential nobles of the magic community, known for their knowledge and practices of the dark arts: controlling time and space, taking new forms, splintering their souls, and even conquering Death. The tomes never mentioned them by name, and Alira was shocked to see their faces in person, much less know who they are. Alira looked up at the two of them, hatred twisted on her face. “I can see where Hadrian gets a lot of his traits,” Alira snapped. “Ugly,” she looked at Professor Snape, “and evil,” glaring next at the Dark Lord. “I’m not surprised,” she taunted. Tom was infuriated that she was insulting his family; nevertheless, his face remained as passive as a stone. He took a step towards her and bent down to her eye level. Wand in hand, Tom lifted her head with it and forced her gaze into his. She wrenched free from his grasp and spat on the ground in front of him. Tom was surprised by this girl’s bravery. “It talks. I can see why you were placed in Gryffindor. You are very brave for one so small. Brave, yet foolish. If you ever insult me or my family again, I will not hesitate to slit your throat and hang your head as a hall ornament,” he threatened. “Let me guess, your name is something sickening like Bella or Rose or Sophie.” Alira defended against that. “I am Alira of the Gryffindor house. I’m not an ‘it’ and I know what your name is, Lord Voldemort.” Hadrian intervened at that moment. “My father is not to be called by that name anymore,” he spat. Hadrian looked at his father and explained what transpired. “I’m sure you heard of what we were doing father. However, we were ambushed by her in a mysterious room. She took out Valorie, Draco, and Remy single-handedly. Luckily, I was able to knock her out with my magic. For her insolence, I suggested that we maim her. However, Valorie objected.” Tom looked at his daughter. Confused by her actions, his eyes shone with a hint of disappointment. “Why did you do that Valorie? You know that we must cut down anyone who stands against us. I thought you were better than that.” Although Valorie was not physically hurt, her father’s dejected words stabbed her the most. It did not make her falter to defend Alira, for she tried to get him to see what she saw. “Father, when she attacked us, I sensed that she was different. As you know, I have fought against many of Dumbledore’s assassins. When they fight, they fight mercilessly, caring for nothing but themselves. Alira, however, fights with courage and valor. She even helped Hadrian, her ‘enemy’. Her kindness saved Hadrian from his conflicting sides. She treated him with warrior’s honor. It is only right that we do the same.” Tom looked to his mate, hoping that he would get a truthful answer. “Is this true? Did that really happen?” Severus lost his words. He wasn’t there for the fight and could not vouch for what Valorie saw. He could only tell them what he experienced. “I...I don’t...know. When I arrived, the Gryffindor casted a spell on Hadrian. I didn’t know what she was doing, so I shoved her aside. My only concern was helping Hadrian, not looking out for the enemy.” Tom looked back to his son. “That is why we are here, father. Since one of us had objections, we hoped that you and mother together would deliver the proper judgement for her crimes against us.” Valorie was through with her brother pushing her around, despite him being the stronger one. “How is having a conscience and true justice a bad thing, brother?! You wouldn’t know justice if it rolled over your foot!” Alira looked at Valorie with a newfound respect. Maybe not all Slytherins were bad after all. Tom hesitated on scolding his daughter. Her words had sunk in. The look in his eyes had given Valorie hope that she had changed his mind. “Fine, daughter. For you, I shall deliver as you call it, true justice.” Tom returned his gaze to Alira. “Valorie has vouched for you despite what you’ve done. She believes that you can help us. I shall not go back on my word because I greatly love my daughter. Here’s how we will decide your fate. Since many of us want you dead, while Valorie sees you have potential, I’ll be willing to turn my head and give you a chance. Although, we have to see how much you are worth to us. So tell me, Gryffindor warrior, are you prepared to bargain for your life?” Alira was confused. “Bargain...for...my life?” Tom chuckled. “Yes. If you want to live, you have to prove to us that you are not worthless. Now, here are the rules.” In a flash, Tom seized her chest and ripped out her heart. Alira screamed. When her heart left her chest, she could no longer feel the emotions of everyone in the castle. The sounds and feelings she felt in emotions suddenly stopped and was now left in a void of emptiness. Her magic immediately waned, leaving her tired and breathless. Alira’s bound hands touched her chest where her heart was. “What did you do to me?!” she cried. Tom cruelly chuckled at her. Her heart beated in the palm of his hand, its glow ominously illuminating the shadows that fell on his face. “You no longer have your heart. You probably do not know of this magic, so I shall explain it to you. When a witch or wizard pulls out a heart, it becomes enchanted and its owner is forced to obey every command given to them. You will bargain for your life, little warrior. If you do not or if we deem you worthless,” The Dark Lord then placed her heart in Hadrian’s hands, “Hadrian will kill you.” Valorie was about to stop them, but she was held back by Malfoy. “No! Stop this at once! She is not worthless! Hadrian! Just as you had seen the difference in Violet, I have seen a difference in her. Are you really that blind to see that she is good because your hatred for Gryffindor runs deep?” The Dark Lord resumed telling her of the deal. “You will not stall for time. You will not call for help. You will not struggle or fight back. Do any of these things, and all Hadrian has to do is bite.” Hadrian raised her heart to his lips and placed his fangs on it. Immediately, Alira felt like her chest was about to explode. She held her arms close to try and stop the pain to no avail. Hadrian removed his fangs and spoke into her heart to command her. “Bargain for your life, Gryffindor scum! Tell us! Why should we spare your life?” Alira knew of some talents that could save her life. Perhaps that would earn her heart and life back. “I am very talented with magic. The professors here tell me that I am a natural and a quick study. I have learned many spells during my three years here.” Hadrian looked at his father for his response. “Your paltry spells pale in comparison to my children’s powers. Valorie and Hadrian are stronger than the great Merlin and my Death Eaters are the best of sorcerers. Try again.” Alira hoped that would work, ending the bargain quickly. This proved to be tougher than she imagined. “I am a very skilled fighter, able to hold my own in a fight. The Slytherins here know that, especially Hadrian, since I crossed blades with him. Magic alone might not be able to convince you. Allow me to fight by your side. You won’t be disappointed.” He gave it thought, only to retaliate her offer. “My family and I are exceptional fighters. We’ll be fine in holding our own. Next!” Alira thought of another way to be of use. “Throughout the years, I’ve been collecting dozens of Muggle weapons and caring for them for my own uses. I have a multitude of weapons you can choose from. I even crafted one myself. If you don’t want me to fight for you, then take my weapons.” Tom shook his head. “If you didn’t notice, Hadrian and Valorie already have weapons. We don’t need anything made with a Muggle’s shoddy craftsmanship,” Tom bargained hard. This girl had to prove that she was undeniably useful, having something precious that no one else could offer. “If you want information, I can get you information. Let me be your spy. I am an empath and am able to feel the emotions of everyone here.” Alira didn’t know what to say about her sudden break in her empathic powers moments before, but still continued. “I can gather intel from the inside. See what people are feeling. No one would suspect that a Gryffindor would be helping, well...you. I can report any suspicious behavior and potential moves against you.” This time, Professor Snape spoke. “Absolutely not! I will not have you ‘be our spy’, only to rat us out to Dumbledore when the time is convenient to you.” Tom smirked at the girl. “If my mate thinks that it's a bad idea, it is one. Tick tock, little warrior! Rack your brain and try to come up with an excuse to keep living.” Alira thought that those options would satisfy them. Yet, they still turned her down. Those seemed like the only noteworthy abilities that would help sorcerers like them. They still thought her as worthless. Her heart was to be eaten and she would become one of many helpless victims who never stood a chance. Becoming more frightened by that prospect, she blathered out anything she could think of that was useful, something that might save her life. However, each offer she gave became lamer than the previous ones. “I have experience with battle strategy! I know about magic events of the past! I can recruit followers for you!” Tom, Severus, and Hadrian began laughing at her attempts to save her life. Alira knew that her excuses were terrible and they knew it too. “Mmm. Nothing. That’s what I see: nothing. You have one last chance to convince us. Otherwise…,” Tom motioned to Hadrian. Snape was advising Hadrian how he should eat her heart. “I find that most blood pools in the upper chambers. Bite there, my child, and you will have tasted your first heart.” Alira shouted in vain. “I can be your servant! I will devote my life to you if I have to! Please! Give me my heart back! Leave Hogwarts alone! Let me go!” Tom knelt in front of her. He cupped her saddened face in his hands. “And here I had thought we were on the verge of a breakthrough. Wait, no I didn’t. Kill her.” Valorie protested furiously while trying to break free of Draco’s grip on her arms. “No! Father, no! NO! ALIRA!” she shrieked. Alira began to cry. She had no heart. She had no future. She was going to die. What would her family think? She would be leaving her brother sisterless, and her family broken. Alira looked into Hadrian’s eyes and he looked into hers. They watched each other, waiting to see what the next moment would bring. Alira could only see the remorseless face of a monster. That would be the last face she would see before she died. She watched as he once again raised her heart to his mouth, feeling the sharp edges of his teeth graze the glowing heart. The pain was excruciating. Her screams reverberated throughout the classroom. Alira wasn’t able to save her life. Her vision became cloud white, focusing in and out, in and out. She wasn’t able to concentrate, her only focus finding solace in Valorie’s kind pleas for her to be spared and her heartbeats that seemingly echoed louder and louder. Nothing was able to save her. Suddenly, an unexpected thought entered her mind. She didn’t know why, but that thought may it be her best chance to live. Alira never told anyone this, not even her own parents. She promised herself that she would never tell anyone, no matter how trustworthy. Probably going to regret it if she was able to live, she yelled her secret over the pain. “I can enchant weapons to deflect magic!” Everyone’s eyes widened at her scream. Hadrian nearly dropped her heart from the surprise. Alira slumped in shock and relief, gulping tearful breaths. With the exception of Alira’s heartbeat, everything was silent. Tom broke the uneasy tension. “...What?” “I...can enchant weapons...to deflect magic…,” she slowly repeated, gasping for air. Tom and Hadrian didn’t know what to make of that. That little girl, able to enchant weapons to deflect magic spells? Tom bursted out into a fit of laughter. Hadrian followed his father’s example. Then, Snape, Mr. Malfoy, Karkaroff, and Malfoy began laughing at her too. Their cackles confused Alira. “What’s so funny?” she asked them. Tom began composing himself, laughing off his last bout and began to strode around her. “What’s funny, is not only your pathetic excuses, it’s also your overreaching lie to save yourself. How stupid do you think we are? You knew that you were going to die, so you were willing to say anything to save yourself. The first and last time an enchanted weapon was crafted was almost two millennia ago by Godric Gryffindor himself. The Sword of Gryffindor is the only known magic-imbued weapon in the world’s existence. And it’s not like Godric Gryffindor shared his methods with anyone. He took his secrets with him to the grave! You craft enchanted weapons?! It’s ridiculous!” Alira gathered herself, settling back on her knees. “Don’t believe me? Ask your son. He knows what he saw. I can tell when I looked at his face when he saw the weapon.” Both of Hadrian’s parents looked to him, who began backing up from the uneasy stares. “What is she talking about, Hadrian?” Snape asked him. “When-when we were about to battle, I saw her weapon. A sword. It was quite beautiful. The part that threw me off was that it looked like it glowed with a white light. I was quite exhausted from using magic and I thought I was hallucinating. I’ve never seen a sword glow before and I imagined it was all in my head. I’m quite skeptical about her claims, but that would explain why the sword was glowing.” Alira smirked at the Dark Lord, knowing that he would trust his son above anyone else’s statements. She then looked at the far wall where her sword leaned against the wall. Using a potions table as a crutch, she lifted herself from the ground and walked over to grab her sword. Hadrian was just about to stop her, but Tom and Severus held him back, curious to see how this was going to play out. Alira held her sword in her bound hands, the hilt resting easy in her palms. “I made this creation last year. I used the purest of steel to forge the blade, fusing it with silver. Guess I made the right choice with silver. Quite useful in a variety of ways. It’s also what I used to craft the arrowheads I shot at Wolf girl there. That’s why she was knocked out cold.” Remy instinctively placed her hands over the wound. It was still quite fresh and dripped blood. “Wait...that’s what you shot me with?! You could have killed me! Silver harms werewolves!” Alira made a face. “You’re fine and alive, Remy. Silver doesn’t kill werewolves. Only knocks them out for a while. I was surprised you fought its effects and were ok...ish. I’m sorry about that, by the way.” “I accept your apology, Alira. A lot of people in your position would probably scare easy from that too.” Remy said. Alira nodded, glad to clear the air with one person. She resumed talking about how she made her sword. “...I wanted to do something different with the cross guard and decided to braid it. I wasn’t as good of a smithy as I am now, so I learned a metal bending spell as a substitute to magically braid the metal into what you see. As for the stones, I used thulite and shaped it into a butterfly and lunalite for the flower. Once I enacted the ritual, it was able to imbue the sword with its magic properties.” Hadrian internally smiled. She unknowingly gave away her secrets. There was no need for her anymore. With those ingredients, they could perform the ritual without her help and dispose of her. “And...that is how you craft enchanted weapons?” he asked craftily. “Yes. Well, mine that is.” Hadrian’s smile slipped away. “What do you mean ‘yours’?” Alira let out a laugh. Tom and Hadrian shared a look of confusion. “When you guys aren’t threatening me, you sure are funny. I thought it would be obvious to master sorcerers like you,” she quipped. While Tom and Hadrian stood there like boulders, Severus became impatient. “Stop toying with us, Gryffindor girl. What do you mean?” Alira caught her breath and tried to stifle her laughter to explain. “Like a person, every weapon is different. Unique. The ingredients needed and the ritual is different for everyone. Not only do you need to take the caster into account, but also the initial owner of the weapon. Take this for example: I wanted to add rubies instead of those pink gems. When I tried, the spell became unstable and had to stop it before the room blew to pieces. It sensed that the rubies were not the perfect fit for me and would not work well with the sword, so the spell backfired. It’s sad though. Would have wanted fire magic too. Rubies are a bit of my specialty. Imagine what I can do to your scythe.” she said to Hadrian. “If you want me to enchant your weapons, untie me. I also would like my heart back. Also, I want your word that you will not harm innocents in Hogwarts or anywhere else, like Ginny.” Malfoy scoffed. “Do you have rocks for brains? Valorie and Hadrian told you that Ginny is a traitor. She is dangerous, a menace to the future of wizard kind.” His father spoke up from the fire grate. “Tom. You should get rid of her. A deal like that could cost you if you are not careful of her. Besides, it would be a win for us if we are rid of one more pesky Gryffindor,” Lucius advised Tom. Alira was insulted. “Hey! I may be a ‘pesky Gryffindor’, but this pesky Gryffindor is the only one here that can enchant weapons.” She laid her sword up against the wall and crossed her arms as much as they could be. Hadrian went over to talk with his mother, father, and the other Death Eaters. Alira watched as they huddled and whispered away. For a second, Professor Snape hunched over in pain. She watched as he recovered from it. Hoping to get a reading on his emotions, she tried to concentrate on them, but remembered that she could not feel them anymore. The girl lightly brushed it off, thinking it was karma catching up to him. Once the small group disbanded, Hadrian shimmered his scythe to his hand, walked over to her, and held it up. Alira recoiled back, thinking that he was going to strike her head. Instead, he changed direction and split the ropes in two. She gasped at the gesture, shocked that he would be the one to cut her ropes. She rubbed her sore wrists to get the circulation to flow. “You promise you will not do anything to mess up this scythe?” he asked, holding it out to her handle first. “Yeah, I won’t do anything to mess it up…,” Alira said, taking the scythe from him, “...much.” Hadrian wanted to maim her, but held it in. Alira examined the weapon thoroughly. She ran her fingers through every groove and crevice in its hilt. Her hand slided on the blade, her index finger lightly touching the tip of the sharp blade. Testing its balance, she gave it a few swipes. This went on for a few minutes. Getting tired of how long she was dragging it out, the professor interrupted her. “I think you have seen enough of the scythe. Are you able to do it or not?” “Of course I am able to do it. Performing the ritual is the easy part. Getting the right materials for said ritual is the hard part. Like I said: every weapon is unique. Not every weapon needs the same kind or type of materials that I used for mine. Hadrian’s and Valorie’s are no exception. So…,” she held her free hand out towards him. “I’ll be needing my heart back, please.” Snape laughed at her. “No. You don’t need your heart to do your work. My husband said you need to prove your worth to us.” “But-but, I d-did. I told you that I know how to enchant weapons s-so they can deflect magic. That shows I’m useful,” she stammered. “You told us you were useful. You didn’t do anything to prove it. To prove that you are useful to us, you will enchant our weapons, and have it done by the start of the winter holidays.” Alira’s jaw dropped. She stood there, processing what he was asking for. He was asking for a lot. “That’s absurd! Do you know how long it took me just to find my own ingredients for the ritual?!” she vented, waving Hadrian’s scythe around to demonstrate how big of a task this is. “It took me half a year to find the right combination! I went through a lot of trial and error for that. And that is not the only thing I have to do. I have to find a way to correctly combine those ingredients with the weapon. It’s not like I’m forging it from scratch. I also have to prepare the ritual, find the right setting, perform the ritual, while making sure I won’t blow up anything. And it’s not only Hadrian’s weapon I’m doing. It’s Valorie’s and yours, and anyone else’s you want me to do! That could take years to complete.” Snape looked smug when she became frazzled. “Well then! I guess you better get started, little sword smith. And just so you won’t get bent out of shape about where your heart will be…” He walked to one of his shelves lined with potions. He pulled out a small box, gilded with gold, much like the one Hadrian used to store Ron’s heart. The professor placed her heart in the box and closed it, lifting it up to hear her heart softly beat within its walls. “Your heart will stay here. Where we can keep a close eye on it.” Alira threw her hands up in exasperation. “Great! I’m a prisoner.” Hadrian snickered. “What else is new? You were my prisoner since I tied you up.” Valorie rushed to her mother to back away when his eyes flared bright red. “You forgot Valorie. How easily I could just kill your little friend…” Snape’s voice trailed off as his hands began reaching for his stomach. Feeling dizzy, he sat down in the closest seat and tried to wait out the pain. It wasn’t this bad a few minutes ago. He tried to catch his breath. Alira looked at him confused. One second, he was threatening her and Valorie that he could easily end her life any time he pleased. The next, he looked like he was the one whose life would end any second. Professor Snape prided on not displaying weakness. It was both difficult and weird for her to see him in this state. Tom, Hadrian, and the others sprinted to help him, pushing Alira away again. Alira noticed that while everyone was tending to Snape, the box containing her heart was left unguarded. Not wanting to be their servant, she tried to get her heart back. She creeped closer to it, trying not to draw attention to herself. When she was a few inches away from grabbing it, Tom shot her a look. “Don’t even think about it,” he sniped at her, then returning to care for Snape. Alira deflated after her attempt, knowing that if she were to try again, she’d die. Mr. Malfoy would probably alert them from the fire since he had such a good front row view of the action. After a minute, Tom and Hadrian helped Severus to his feet. “We better take him to the hospital wing. Madam Pomferey will know what to do,” Hadrian told his father. “I’ll help,” Draco piped up. “I’ll help your husband get there. If you want, ride on my shoulder in your snake form. That way, you can be there too.” As they marched their way up to the door, Alira shouted out to them. “What about me?!” Hadrian turned around. “You can get started on finding what you need for the ritual. There are plenty of materials here that can probably be of use. Lucius Malfoy and Headmaster Karkaroff will watch you.” As Violet was about to join them, Hadrian asked if she could assist him in a different way. “Violet, do you think you can stay here? Alira’s arm looks like it needs tending to and you're the best with potions.” Violet smiled. “Yeah, Hadrian. I’ll help her. Make sure that professor is ok!” Hadrian turned to Karkaroff next. “Make sure she doesn’t try to get her heart back.” Karkaroff bowed to him in response. “Of course, young Riddle.” Hadrian left Alira behind in the Potions room. “Uggghh! Why did you have to say anything, Alira? Why?” she mumbled berateledly to herself. Her eyes caught Karkaroff and Lucius staring at her every movement. “You can’t get out of this one, Alira. Not now anyways. I better get started before they nag,” Alira said under her breath. She walked to a giant cabinet filled to the brim with magical objects. Opening the wooden doors, she rummaged around, starting her mission to enchant their weapons.
"My name is Harry by the way."
There was confusion. Astoria went first. "Ginny, Draco and I decided that we aren't getting married today," gasps were heard all around. Harry stared at Draco who just smiled saying 'just wait' under his breath. "Ginny, we don't love each other. We only were going to marry because of a marriage contract and the weird political atmosphere the Wizarding World had. We are both gay. I love you. Ginny, will you marry me?"
I was taken back by that question. I didn't want to tell him the truth. "I liked him, so I dated him."
Ron, Ginny, and Molly were stripped of the Weasley name by Arthur, who asked for my forgiveness, which I gave none because there was nothing to be forgiven for. It wasn't his fault his wife, and youngest children tried to steal from me and hurt me. The elder Weasley children also turned their backs on Ron, Ginny, and Molly, vowing their allegiance to me. Saying I was family, while those three were not. I found this to be quite hilarious. They are currently in Azkaban whining about their lots in life, complaining loudly that it was all Dumbledore's fault.
"I insist."
Harry was happy with how the article came out. He was out now, but still hid the fact that he was in love with his Auror Partner and friend Draco Malfoy. He got a lot of support for coming out. He was glad to be recognized for something he actually did, rather than the pumped up celebrity status he had before. He felt so much better now getting that secret off his chest.
I was taken aback. That was a lot of information to digest. "I am willing to let your parents see Ren. I understand why you were upset because I kept you from knowing about my pregnancy and didn't get to enjoy the joys of it with me. I am unsure why you divorced, but that is not my business."
"I should tell you it is because I no longer had to hide behind a false marriage to have an heir. I have Ren, it doesn't matter if he doesn't have my last name, he is my first born and my heir. And for the other reason, it's because I am in love with you Harry."
Blaise Zabini. He was perfect. Not only would it drive Draco mad but it would show Draco that I was into boys and not against dating a Slytherin.
"What was that about?" Draco asked after she left.
"If you would like me to." Harry agreed.
"Really?"
Ginny gasped. "Yes. Right now?"
We made a plan to use Gringotts, ICW, and Amelia Bones to go after those who had betrayed and abandoned me.
All was well.
"I don't." Draco snapped.
He looked angry and hurt.
“But we just met!” said the Prince.  “Why leave now?”
"No they won't! Your parents will hate me!" Draco yelled.
'Why are you apprenticing at Beauxbatons and not Hogwarts?"
The Epilogue
"You? Go to the ball? Absolutely not!"
He gathered me in his arms and took my lips in a possessive and fierce kiss. He growled and pushed me back onto the bed. He undressed quickly. He mapped my body with his warm corse hands, then with his lips and tongue. I was already putty in his hands. He took off my panties and tank top. He took my hard on in his mouth and sucked me while he prepped me for his cock. I couldn't wait for him to be inside me. "Oh god Draco, please. Inside me Draco. Now!" I pleaded.
"Yes of course I will marry you."
Harry stared at her. He was skeptical, but he wanted to hear her out. "I am willing to hear your offer. I am sure I will have to give you something in return for whatever you are willing to help me with. I would love to help Draco, his mother, get the mark off his arm and his godfather's arm, and to be able to get rid of oldy voldy since I am fated to defeat him."
"No young Harry. It is all real, but there is one thing you should know."
"But that is simply impossible. I have nothing to wear and no way of getting there."
When I got home I still felt in shock. I had gone to the hospital in the first place because I had been so sick lately. I was constantly throwing up or becoming dizzy and tired easily. I thought I had somehow gotten cancer of all things. Nope, just pregnant.
"I just don't believe that." She insisted.
Severus released the straps holding me to the bed. He unhooked me from my IV and sat me up slowly. I groaned. Not used to sitting up. I didn't understand what was going on. I barely understood why Severus was there. Why he cared or why he was rescuing me. I just knew that going with him would be better than where I was now.
"Of course." I handed him and Draco took him gently into his arms. Draco seemed like a natural. It was a wonderful thing to witness. I knew right then, I was gone. I would let Draco into our lives.
That was until Hermione decided to but in. She had been bugging him about his lack of love life. He tried to reassure her that he was fine. He didn't need anyone to complete him. He was fine on his own. She just didn't understand. She insisted that Harry was unhappy being alone. So she started inviting women over to ambush Harry during dinners at her and Ron's place. Harry chuckled when she did this. It was annoying, but humorous. Hermione wouldn't understand ever. After months and months of her trying to set Harry up with every available woman they knew, she finally confronted him at work!
The whole courtroom was in an uproar. It was amazing what one person could do against another. Once everyone settled down, and we got to business, we were able to show all the evidence that we had gathered, going back generations, where Dumbledore had truly done some evil things. He tried to say it was all for the "Greater Good", but once we showed evidence that, that slogan was once used by Grindelwald, Albus' lover, and they had used it to try and control the Wizarding World and the muggle world, it was all over. They had used Vertaserum to confirm all the evils Dumbledore did. He even admitted to wanting Harry dead because he wanted to stay in control, and use his power to manipulate the Wizarding World and shape into his views. The Wizengamot sentenced Albus to 90 years in Azkaban, in a cell closest to the dementors, after serving 200 years in the Goblin Mines, to payback everything he stole, while wearing magic surpassing cuffs and life extending collar. After all that he would get the kiss, but first he would suffer.
Harry whimpered. "When will I have time to make mine?"
About an hour later I heard a knock on my door. I opened it to see Draco staring at me on my front step.
The last bit was a bit harder. The plan was to take date someone. It couldn't just be anyone though. It had to be someone Draco would actually think I would date and be jealous of. I talked to all my friends and even a few of Draco's to get their opinions because I had to make sure they would be willing to do this with me. That was when I started to fake date...
I smiled at him.
After the lovely dinner, cake and lots of dancing, both Harry and Ginny got surprised once again with trips for separate honeymoons. Astoria was going to take Ginny to the Maldives, while Draco was going to take Harry to Paris.
I shook my head. Tears formed in my eyes. "I really don't know how to tell him. He's getting married to a woman."
"No. Thank you for everything you have done for me Professor. Now, if you don't mind, I have a Dark Lord to smite along with all his so called Death Eaters. I have a date with destiny."
“Have we met?” said the Prince.
And so the Prince and Harry courted and married not long after.
"What seems to be the issue?" He asked.
"Are you busy?"
"Like what?"
"I cannot believe you rejected every last girl I tried to help you go out with."
All in all, life turned out to be pretty good. I had a loving boyfriend (possibly fiancee if says yes), loving guardians (Severus and the Malfoy's), a great career, amazing friends, and no more traps getting in my way. I could not be happier. I am so glad things worked out the way they did. I owe it all to Severus, who saved me. I would not be where I am today without him. I am doing my best to prove to him how thankful for him I am. He hates it, but I have to do something! I can't just let him do all this for me and not pay him back somehow.
I just hope I can get through the next year without incident. If I can, then I can escape. I have my sights on becoming an apprentice under the DADA professor. That's what I had to focus on.
Severus and Harry traveled back to Hogwarts and informed the Headmaster what transpired. Dumbledore looked surprised, but was happy that Harry had done what he had set out to do. He saved the Wizarding World. Harry said he didn't want to be a hero. He just wanted to be Harry. Let them come up with some fanciful reason for Voldemort's defeat.
But when asked his name, the Prince frowned. Still not his Harry.
She opened the door and let the Prince in. "I have one son for you to see."
"Oh Draco, I know that you don't love me. We only made a promise to each other that we would only marry for an heir to appease our parents. I'm not pregnant. We haven't even consummated our marriage. I can talk to our lawyer and have it annulled."
Harry climbed into the carriage thanking his fairy godparent. And he was off.
So Harry had successfully kept his sexuality hidden. At least for now. He knew Hermione was still trying to get him to confess, but he didn't really want to yet. He wasn't ready. He had kept it hidden so long, it was natural to him now. He was afraid. He knew that coming out would create a huge whirl storm of havoc. It would shake the Wizarding World to its core. He really didn't want to face all of that. He knew that he would have his friends support, but he was still afraid. It was only natural. It would be a big thing and it would change everything.
After taking me to Malfoy Manor, he set out to heal me physically and mentally. It would take several months, but it would be worth it in the end. Severus explained he would help me heal and help me get my revenge.
The next time I feel less delirious there is a commotion going on outside my room. I frown confused. I wonder what is going on. Then my room is opened. I looked over towards the door. There standing inside the frame is the last person I thought would come rescue me. It was Severus Snape! I could not believe it. It made me even more confused. He looked at me with concern, which did not make sense at all.
He nodded. "That's fair. The way I have acted hasn't really shown you who I truly am. The thing is I was attracted to you and wanted you for myself. I tried to get you first by pulling your pig tails at first when that didn't work, I tried making you jealous, but then you started dating Blaise. I was so jealous and angry. I didn't mean to hurt you with my words. I didn't mean to drive you away. The truth is that I overheard you talking to Severus that night. I was so shocked by what you said. I had no idea that is what happened and how you felt. When I went to you that night, I had it in my head to get you to confess, but you were so stubborn I got so mad that I had to leave before doing something stupid. After you left, I realized how stupid I was being. I talked to my dad and Severus and they advised me to chase after you. That is why I am here. I am hoping you will give me a chance."
"What?! You - argh! I can't just- Fine! Leave!" He yelled, turned around left my room, slammed the door behind him, and stormed away. I was left even more confused than before.
Albus Dumbledore's name was tarnished. His reputation was in the gutter. Not even his strongest supporters believed in him anymore. He is still currently working hard in the Goblin Mines.
"Mr. Potter, you shouldn't go alone." Professor Snape protested.
I was confused. "I don't understand."
Harry looked up.
At the end of the meal Draco finally spoke up, "So you are just going to leave?"
"Hermione, listen to me right now. Don't even think about outing me. I will lose my job. Please just let it go. You understand now right?!"
"Why are you leaving?"
There was a slight murmur in the courtroom.
In last weeks Wizengamot session Lord Harrison James Potter-Black-Peverell-Emrys-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Lefay came out as gay and put forth a new bill declaring that being homosexual should be decriminalized and making it illegal to discriminate based on people's sexuality. There was some who said that homosexuals in our society and our savior had this to say: "Yes I am. I am gay and I wish to marry a man one day, and not have to marry a woman because people don't like the fact that I am gay. We have magic. If I want an heir I could blood adopt or seek out a woman to surrogate for me or even use a potion to help me and my partner have a child of our own." That got quite a few people thinking and in a vote 140 to 39, the bill passed. It seems that we shall see much change to our world with Lord Potter-Black-Peverell-Emrys-Slytherin-Gryffindor-Ravenclaw-Lefay in charge. In an interview after the session there were some questions.
Black
Lucius’s POV:
Remy heard the door open. She put down the photo and turned around. She saw her mother, tired yet triumphant. Now that they were alone, they could be the family they could not show. Remy ran to her mother and gave him a hug. “I was so worried that they would have been suspicious. First day back on the job, and an incident occurs. I thought they were going to pin the blame on you.” Remus stroked her hair. “I’m fine. Pup, it’s ok. I’m fine,” he said soothingly while brushing his hand through his daughter’s hair. “None of the professors saw me and Madam Pomfrey didn’t raise questions. She is close friends with Severus and Tom, so don’t worry.” Remy sighed in relief. “Ok. Good. So, what did you want to talk about mother? When you told me to meet you here, you seemed worried. Did someone find us out?” Remus held out his hand to stop her. “No, nothing of the sort. I want to talk with you and see how you are doing, but I need to tell you something first. Do you recall last month?” Remy looked back at her that time. A lot happened during those days. “I think you need to be more specific, mother. Many things occurred last month. I could list them all if you’d like.” He chuckled at her intelligence. “I’m sure you could, but not the moment I am referring to. Do you remember the day you blacked out and woke up in the middle of the woods?” Unconsciously, her ears and tail sprouted out as if they knew what he was talking about more than her. “Wh-wh-what about that time?” Remus saw his daughter’s unease. “There is something that you need to know. As you have already seen, you are part wolf. However, it seems that you have also inherited my werewolf side. I told you about how I could not control the werewolf inside of me. You even saw it firsthand when you met your father. Last month on the night of the full moon, it seems that you could not control the wolf either.” Remy gasped. It now made sense. That night, she felt powerful, strong, free; a euphoric feeling that she never felt in her life. She could not recall how or why, but it seems that she could not recall it at all. Fearing that she did something she regretted, she mustered her courage to ask her mother. “Did I hurt anyone? Did I hurt you?” “No, Pup. No. You did nothing wrong. You were very lucky that night. However, you might not be so lucky next time. The werewolf inside will only get stronger. There is a way to control it. But, you need to want to learn it.” Remy was determined to learn. Anything to keep her and her friends safe. “I want to learn to control it. More than anything,” she spoke. Remus kept his expression grim. “We shall see. You may be willing to take the risk, willing to learn to control the wolf, but the wolf may not. I dismissed the Gryffindors early since Hadrian attacked one of them, and your friends are still in the classroom, probably bored mad by now. We have time and no one to bother us. Lay down on my bed and relax.” Remy walked over to the bed sitting in the corner in the room. She climbed on the bed, resting her head on the plush pillows. Remus sat at the bedside and brushed the hair from his daughter’s face. “Ok. This is what I’m going to do: I am going to send you on a vision quest to see if we can tame your wolf side.” Remy wasn’t scared. She read how they worked during her time in Divination class, but she thought it was a little odd. Remy lifted her head to look at her mother clearly. “A vision quest? I thought that was only used to help a person seek answers,” she questioned him. He nodded. “It is to help you seek the answer of if you will be able to control the wolf. Now, I need you to relax. If you are going to go on a vision quest, your mind needs to be calm.” Remy closed her eyes and took a deep breath. When Remy began to feel much more relaxed, Remus began the spell. “Horoma Viventem.” Remus chanted slowly and traced the spell around his daughter.

Hadrian and the others had finished training for the day. After what happened with his mother, they resumed for a little while and ended it early. He decided to go see him and make sure he was ok after today’s incident. Hadrian went into his mother’s room and saw that he wasn’t the happiest. “I wonder what happened here?” he thought. Hadrian walked towards the bed, trying to see if his mother was willing to talk. When he turned toward his son, it startled him. “Hadrian? What are you doing here?” Hadrian smiled at his mother and gave him a hug. “I wanted to check on you. When you fainted, it worried me so much. I am glad to see that you are ok now.” Severus smiled at his son, grateful that he was a thoughtful and caring young man. “Are you feeling better?” Hadrian asked as he sat on the edge of the bed. “A little. Narcissa came and gave me a check-up. It was annoying. She started to act all high and mighty, like she was above me and everyone else,” he fumed. Hadrian put his arm around his mother and comforted him. “Mother, you need to calm down. Mrs. Malfoy was just trying to help you.” He crawled over to where his mother was laying down and sat down crossed-legged. “You don’t understand, Hadrian. No one mocks the Riddle family. We are supposed to be strong and proud. And everyone who thinks otherwise should be put back in their place.” Hadrian just raised an eyebrow at his mother’s outburst. “Mother. Please.” Severus looked at his son and decided to listen for once. “Moving on from that. What happened to you Hades?” Hadrian was confused. “What do you mean?” he asked. “We never really got the chance to catch up. Everything in the past week was so overwhelming and I didn’t get the chance to talk to you alone. I have so much to ask you. I wanted to ask you about your past.” Hadrian gave him a weird look. Back when he was Harry Potter, his mother constantly berated him for his “past”. Now, he wanted him to tell him everything. “I don’t get it,” he questioned. “When I was Harry Potter, you constantly mocked me for my past. How I was raised by Muggles. How I was the ‘boy who lived’. How I was ‘the son of Lily and James Potter’.” You should know more than enough about my past. I even remember one of the first things you told me when I entered your class.” Severus did remember what he said to his son. “I said: “Potter! What would I get if I added powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?” Hadrian nodded, glad that his mother actually remembered. “That’s correct. I didn’t know anything at the time. Now I do.” Severus looked at his son with sorrow. For the past three years, he unknowingly tormented his own son. He always thought there was something off with the boy, but he should have figured it out sooner. “Hadrian,” he said. “I’m so sorry. I did not mean to hurt you in any way. Those three years at school must have been painful for you. If you don’t forgive me, that’s fine. But, please allow me to fix my mistakes. Let me be the mother I should have been.” Hadrian hugged his mother. “I forgive you. It’s just… when I was little, I thought no one could love me. Now, I see that I was wrong.” The two hugged for a while, letting their sorrows drift away in the moment. After that, Hadrian told his mother the little details of his past. “Mother, I know what you're thinking. Let Father take care of them, ok?” Severus relaxed, knowing that his son is ok with the idea of killing the ones who hurt him. “Mother?” “Yes, Hades?” “What are we going to do when we go back to Hogwarts?” Severus thought about the question that his son had brought up. “We won’t do anything to your name. You’ll just say that you were homeschooled when they ask for any transferred students.” “Ok, but what about you? Will you be ok?” “I can manage. As long as your father stays with you, I’ll be fine.” “Alright, Mother. I’ll let you rest.” Hadrian smiled at his mother before leaving the room and closed the door behind him. Hadrian walked down the hall to the stairs. When Hadrian got downstairs, he was met with the others from the training yard. “What do you guys want?” Hadrian wasn’t in any mood to deal with any more questions. Draco walked over, looking upset with himself. He should have listened to his mate. Draco hugged Hadrian close, trying to calm him down. Once Hadrian was in his mate’s arms, he started to calm down and snuggled into his chest. “I’m sorry that I didn’t listen to you.” Hadrian looked at his mate. “It’s fine. Just listen next time, ok?” “Yes, Hades.”

Vaults:
“I’m heading out the door for a minute. I’ll be right back.” Hadrian stepped out into the hallway. When he closed the door, he heaved a giant sigh. He was plotting Ron’s death most of the day, trying to get rid of him as quickly as possible. It was hard to make and even harder to not tell the others. Hadrian got away from the rest of them so he can think alone without the guilty feeling of not telling them. Not telling Draco was burning a hole through him. “I must kill Ron tonight. He will not live to see another sunrise.” Finally alone, Hadrian closed his eyes and leaned against the wall, scheming away. “Hadrian?” He looked around when he heard his name. In front of him, a bright, fiery haired girl stood in his path. “Hello, Hadrian,” Ginny greeted. Hadrian frowned when he saw her face. Despise for abadonning Amelia filled his mind. He was already planning the death of one Weasley and he was too busy to plan hers. Getting closer to Hadrian, she tried to appear as delicate and graceful as possible. “I was looking for you.” Hadrian thought that was suspicious. Ginny never went looking for him as Harry Potter, and they ‘barely knew each other’ now that he was Hadrian. “You were?” he asked her. She smiled slyly, like a fox waiting in the brush. “Yeah, I was. In the common room when you were helping Violet move out, I saw how you faced the others in the room. How you demanded respect and drew power from all around you. I like guys like that.” Hadrian was disgusted. He already had Draco as a mate, and if he found out, he would go ballistic. “Not interested.” He tried to walk away, but Ginny was faster and blocked his path again. “But, Hadrian, give this some thought. We are both strong in ways that rival many. You and me, we can find our destiny together.” “Didn’t you just have a child with Dean Thomas? A child that my mother found?” Hadrian tried to remind her. Ginny simply scoffed. “Well, yes. But Dean was just a one night fling. I never actually expected for him to fill my womb with a child.” She sashayed closer to Hadrian, closing the gap between them. Hadrian looked away, but Ginny forced him to look at her, their eyes burning with a different goal. “Ginny, even if you were done with Dean, aren’t you in love with Harry Potter? Rumors have spread that you two have quite a history. That curtain of his history is certainly still open.” She shook her head, her fiery red locks blinding Hadrian. “Curtain closed. Harry is dead. Sure, I was broken when I heard the news, but when I saw you, I was whole again. I felt that we belonged together. Now, it is time for you to feel that too.” Hadrian realized that he was now pinned against the wall, Ginny entrapping him. She was so close now that Hadrian could smell her sickeningly sweet scent. “Hadrian…” Ginny whispered. With her free hand, she placed it on Hadrian’s chest, feeling his heart throb out of control. She leaned in closer, a breath away from his lips. “No.” Hadrian pushed her away. She reached for him again and Hadrian shoved her away. Hadrian couldn’t believe it. “She doesn’t get the hint that I’m not interested.” He just stared at her, wanting this to end. “When are you going to get it through that thick head of yours that I’m not interested?! Which part of the word ‘no’ did you not understand? I am not your soulmate and I never was.” Ginny stepped back in confusion. Hadrian was mad at her just for trying to win his heart? “But, Hadrian, give me a chance. If you’d like, I can prove to you that we belong with one another,” she tried again, keeping her anger down in the depths. Hadrian shook his head and regained his composure. “No. Don’t prove anything. I want nothing to do with you. Now, I have one request for you: stay out of my business and out of my way. Your brother already has something coming for him tonight. I will see to it that he gets the full force of my wrath. And soon, it will be your turn. Don’t press your luck any further by messing with me, Ginny, or you might end up with a fate worse than death.” Hadrian made his eyes flash for emphasis. Ginny was now terrified by Hadrian. She unconsciously backed away from the Riddle boy and ran out of the corridor. When Hadrian could no longer hear her footsteps, he relaxed. As soon as he turned around, Draco was standing in the doorway. His face gleaned with sadness and disappointment. “I heard everything...Are you really going after Ron tonight?” Hadrian nodded, not wanting to hide anything anymore. Draco fumed at Hadrian who did not even try to say anything to him. Draco could not look at him in the eyes. “So, you are keeping secrets from me? I thought we told each other everything.” Hadrian could not lie to his mate anymore and decided to tell him the truth. “I’m sorry, Draco. I really wanted to tell you. It was tearing me apart that I couldn’t. And then you found out on your own…” Draco couldn’t bear his excuses. “Save it, Hadrian. I thought we were mates. I’m supposed to protect you. It’s one promise that I intend to uphold. I can’t do it with you sneaking behind my back. What would my role be then? Draco Malfoy: the guy who’s always left in the dark?” Hadrian did not want his mate to feel like that. “I never wanted you to be angry. I was trying to get my point across to Ginny who was flirting with me. Please don’t be angry with me about that.” “I’m not angry about that. In fact, I’m glad that you resisted her. But, I just don’t get why you had to hide your plans from me. We’re a team, you know,” Draco reminded him. “I had to. The plans to take down Ron are too important. If anyone else were to find out, it could damage our cover. Dumbledore and the Order would find out if he decided to drag the information out of you.” Draco did not know what to say. His mate had cared about his own wellbeing. “Thank you, Hades. That's very sweet of you. Now that I know of the plan, let me help you. You don’t know if you are going to need backup,” Draco offered. Hadrian told him no. “If any of you were to help me, it would compromise your safety. This is something I need to do on my own.” Despite Hadrian’s noble efforts, Draco’s trust in him decreased. “How can I trust you with your plan if you can’t even trust me with it?” Draco asked him. Hadrian did not know how to answer that. “You don’t. Just trust that I can handle myself. Like you said, we’re mates. And mates have a way of knowing how the other feels.” The two were silent for what felt like days. Draco opened the door for the both of them and they headed back inside the Potions classroom. They parted and sat at opposite sides of the classroom. Hadrian covered his head with his arms, shielding himself from the world. Valorie noticed that her brother looked more down in the dumps than ever. She headed over to him and gave him a sisterly hug. “Hey, you ok?” she asked. “No.”

“Wake up.” Ron did as he was told. He got up from his bed and stood there, a blank expression across his face. “Now, head to the Chamber of Secrets to help your sister,” a mysterious voice commanded. The Gryffindor did what he was told and started making his way down to the Chamber. Ron thought it was a dream, nothing more than a particularly vivid dream. He dreamt that he was walking down the stairs to the Gryffidor common room and heading out the door. It was one of those dreams that were perfect in every detail. It didn’t seem like it was that scary right now. It was just...odd. The paintings on the wall were urging him to go back to bed before Filch caught him. He didn’t care. As long as he could save Ginny from the Chamber of Secrets again, getting caught was the least of his problems. “No. Avoid getting seen by the ghosts and Filch, or you will never see your sister again,” the voice warned him. Ron did not want that to happen, so he crept carefully whenever the patrol was within his vicinity. He reached the girl’s bathroom and swung the door wide open. He looked around. The bathroom was empty, the smell of the sewer reached his nose. “Ron Weasley,” a familiar voice called out. Ron looked around and spotted Moaning Myrtle perched on her windowsill. “How wonderful to see you again.” Ron looked at the ghostly girl and a sense of obedience washed over him. “Hi, Myrtle. What are you doing up there?” Myrtle smiled a big cat-like grin and giggled. “Oh, you know, floating here and there and everywhere, thinking about death. I’m actually glad that you came. I saw your sister head into the Chamber of Secrets again. Brought up so many memories from two years ago.” A prickel went up Ron’s spine, jolting him to focus. “What is Ginny doing down there?” Ron asked Myrtle. “She said that something important was down in the Chamber and needed to go get it. I tried to warn her to not go there, but she didn’t listen. I always tell the living a little motto of mine: never head back to the place you nearly died, or you might not be so lucky the next time.” The mysterious voice in Ron’s head started to speak to him again. “Ask her what happened to Ginny.” Ron complied with the voice. “What happened to Ginny?” Myrtle faked a look of concern, trying to get Ron to comply. “I don’t know. After a few minutes, I heard a terrible screaming coming from down below. It sounded like she was in horrible pain. Tortured! It’s a good thing that you came. You can rescue her.” Ron was determined to get his sister back, so he walked over the sinks, the sealed entrance to the Chamber of Secrets. When Harry had opened the door, he spoke in Parseltongue. Even though Ron didn’t know how to speak the language, he remembered bits and pieces that Harry whispered in his sleep “Open up,” Ron hissed. The sinks began to open the door and revealed the large hole that led down into the Chamber. Ron looked back at Myrtle, who nodded at him to press on. Ron stared at the hole for a moment and then jumped down into its dark, slimy depths. The boy looked around the darkness that was all around him, the tunnels stretching out like a snake. “Go ahead. You know the way.” Ron trekked through the tunnels, his feet crunching on rat skulls and rotting snake skin. He made his way to the center of the Chamber, the same place where he saw Ginny being tortured in his dream. It looked just like it did two years ago, except for a decaying basilisk corpse splayed out on the floor. “Ginny?! Are you here?” Ron looked around for his sister, but found nothing. In the shadows, Hadrian watched Ron and slowly walked out as Ron turned his back. Hadrian picked up a basilisk bone from the floor and creeped his way toward Ron. Hadrian hit Ron over the head; the Gryffindor collapsed on the floor and blacked out.
Next day:
It has been a month since Severus reunited with his children. That day seemed so far away now. Ever since that day, so much has happened. He first found out he was pregnant. Then more of his family returned. New faces became allies and friends. “Has it really been a month? It seems like much longer...” he thought. He pressed his hand to his stomach, feeling how much he had grown. At the start of his pregnancy, he didn’t show. Now, his stomach started to protrude a little. Narcissa helped him a lot during that month. She gave him weekly check-ups and corrected his eating habits so he can feed enough for him and his baby. He has been feeling a lot better lately with her help. He was even able to walk around the manor without an escort. As he walked around the back gardens, he became lost in thought. Only one day was left before he and the children were to go to Hogwarts. From there on out, they were going to be treading in dangerous waters. Hogwarts was under Dumbledore’s control and everyone there followed his every command. If they were going to kill him, it had to be strategic and sneaky. Severus was interrupted from his thoughts when he heard a piercing cry ring out from the woods. While Tom and Narcissa gave him strict orders to not wander away from the Malfoy Manor, but his motherly instincts had taken over and he followed the sound of the cry. It was a heartbreaking sound. It was torture for Severus to hear that. He walked and walked, trying to find whoever was crying. After passing through the light part of the forest, he came to a densely wooded area. It was much darker and the trees blocked out most of the sunlight. Severus was tempted to shadow travel to find the child, but he told himself not to so he does not hurt himself. For another few minutes, he traveled through the woods, but didn’t see much except for trees and squirrels. He was close to the sound, but couldn’t find where that child was. As if he was in a trance, he walked to a giant tree that had a small hollow near its roots. Near the hollow, was a young woman holding a baby. Severus walked closer, the leaves crunching from his footsteps. The woman heard him and darted away, leaving the baby behind. He did not get a good look at the woman, except that she had fiery red hair. “Must be Molly or Ginny Weasley. It seems typical of them to leave a child out in the middle of the woods,” he thought. As he walked closer, he saw the baby bundled in blankets. A baby girl looked up at him with saddened eyes. She was tiny, the size of a newborn. She had tiny fuzzies of black hair on her head and her eyes were a light brown. When Severus looked at  her face, he had a flash of Ginny Weasley in his mind. “That stupid Weasley girl. She gave up this child for no reason.” That made him furious. He suddenly had the urge to kill her, punish her for what she did. The baby sensed his anger and resumed crying, reaching her tiny arms to the angered male. Severus tried to calm her down by rocking her back and forth. She stopped crying and reached out to his finger which he held close to the child’s torso, grasping it in her tiny hand. He gasped softly, seeing the sweet gesture the baby made. The male pressed his forehead to the baby’s, holding her tight. “Don’t worry, little one. I’m here,” he whispered. “She needs a name…” “Hmm, how about Amelia? Ameila Cici Riddle. The little girl giggled and seemed to like her name. “Alright. Amelia it is.” Severus held her tightly as he made his way back to the Malfoy Manor. He didn’t want to stay much longer in the woods and Amelia needed the proper care she deserves. By the time he returned, the sun was high in the sky. It warmed his skin, but irritated it a little. He was able to stay in the sun for a few hours, but affected him greatly if he stayed in it too long. Severus entered through the back door and saw Tom and the others eating lunch. They didn’t notice his presence until he closed the door. “Was your excursion in the garden helpful....” Tom’s voice trailed away as he saw Severus holding a baby in his arms. In his shock, he dropped the plate and it shattered on impact. Everyone turned to Severus, surprised to see him with a baby. “Severus,” Tom said, trying to keep his composure. “Where did you find that baby?” Severus looked at Amelia, who was staring at him with her big eyes. “I found her. The Weasley girl abandoned her in the woods. I heard her crying and I decided to follow the sound and it led me to her,” he explained. Narcissa gave him a disapproving look. “You went outside the boundaries of the Manor? Severus, your intentions may be pure, but you can’t just wander off like that.” Severus glared at her briefly before returning to rocking the baby in his arms. “Does this mean we have a new member of the family?” Valorie asked. Tom walked up to Severus and the baby. “Hold on. We can’t just take in this baby. We are heading to Hogwarts tomorrow and it’s not like we can just bring a baby onto school grounds.” Severus was starting to get mad that Tom didn’t see they had to take in this baby. She needed her best chance, and that best chance was with them. “I’ll just tell Dumbledore that I found her in the middle of the woods and decided to take her in. It’s the perfect cover up. He won’t suspect any attacks from me if he knows I am taking care of Amelia,” he reasoned. Tom was confused. His mate wanted to attack Dumbledore and take care of the baby. “You are not attacking Dumbledore in your current state. And you gave her a name?!” “It’s also the perfect time to get revenge on Ginny,” Hadrian said. “No one should do that to a child.” Tom had to deal with Severus and Hadrian defending the baby. “Wait! You can’t just rush in like that. And Severus, what will happen if Dumbledore does go after you?” He thought about that for a moment, trying to quickly form a plan. “We’ll just help Mother and attack Dumbledore. Easy,” Valorie chimed in. “No, you are not. Severus, they...” Severus had enough trying to explain this nicely. “Ok, enough! We are keeping this baby Tom. And that’s final! If anyone else has a problem with that, you can take it up with me!” He headed upstairs to his room with Amelia in his arms, leaving the dining room with a roomful of confused people.

Tom watched as Severus rushed out of the classroom with Remy. From what he gathered from her breathless rant, Hadrian was in danger and needed Severus’s help immediately. He was hoping that Severus would be there to help convince Karkaroff to join, but he knew that he could manage on his own. After all, Karkaroff was one of his most loyal Death Eaters before misfortune befell them. He heard a knock on the door. “Come in,” Tom said. As he suspected, Karkaroff walked in. He closed the door behind him. When he laid eyes on his master, he promptly sunk into a deep bow. “My lord,” he said. Tom commanded him to rise before him. With the formalities out of the way, the two greeted each other as old friends. “Igor Karkaroff. I wondered when we would meet again. I hear that your school is flourishing and that you lead a prosperous life.” Karkaroff thought that he was scolding him for not trying to help his master achieve that. “I-I am s-so sorry Lord Riddle. I tried my best to help you when all was not well.” The Durmstrang headmaster bowed his head in shame. After a few seconds, he looked up to see that Tom had a remorseful, faraway look. “I know, Karkaroff. You did your best. And please, call me Tom. There is no need for formalities anymore,” Tom chuckled. Karkaroff relaxed himself. Tom led him to a cleared off potions table. They got themselves comfortable before Tom went to business. “I’ve been meaning to ask you to rejoin the Death Eaters, Igor. I am sure you remember the fight against Dumbledore, correct?” Karkaroff nodded his head. “Of course I remember. I lost a lot of sleep around that time and my hair began to turn white.” Tom looked at his colleague and realized he looked much older than he did years ago. “Yes. After the fight, Dumbledore had you imprisoned in Azkaban for a while. How did you manage to get out?” “When I was imprisoned, Dumbledore visited me every other week. He made sure that the Demeanors had wrought enough pain onto me until I cooperated with him. I realized that I was going nowhere until he heard what he wanted to hear. I began to say what he wanted me to say, cooperating and obeying every whim. He then deemed me ‘reformed enough’ to be with the rest of the magical community. After a few years, he told the jailer that I’ve ‘seen the error of my ways’ and that I should be released. The only reason that I’m not back in Azkaban is because Dumbledore truly thought I reformed.” Tom scowled at the thought. “Dumbledore is a fool to think that he could ‘reform’ Death Eaters. You were clever enough to trick him. Your cleverness and deceptiveness are precisely why I ask you to rejoin our coven.” Without a second thought, Karkaroff answered him. “This life was given to me by you, my lord. I do not intend to give it to anyone else.” Tom grinned at his devout follower. “Thank you, Igor. I knew you would make the right decision. And enough with the formalities already.  I insist that you call me Tom. Just not when in a meeting.” “Sorry, my lord. I mean, Tom,” Karkaroff corrected himself. Tom began to head over to the small fireplace near the far side of the room. “I better tell Lucius the good news that we have another recruit. He’s helping my sister-in-law protect Riddle Manor. He’ll be delighted to know that your back. I still remember you two would rival over who was the better dueler.” Karkaroff laughed at the fond memory. “Lucius was always good at spell casting, but I was better in countering his spells.” Tom laughed with him as he knelt down and lit the hearth with a quick spell. He was trying to communicate with Lucius through the fire grate. When Tom casted the spell, Lucius’s face began to form within its embers. “Tom? Tom! It’s good to hear from you. How’s life at Hogwarts?” Lucius’s voice echoed through the fire. “It is great so far. Igor has decided to rejoin our ranks. Another Death Eater to battle against Dumbledore.” Mr. Malfoy’s face in the fire smiled back. “That’s great. I can’t wait to tell the others the good news. I…” Lucius was cut off by a sharp knock at the door. “Who is that Tom? Classes should be near over by now. No one should be heading to the Potions room at this time. Transform and hide!” Lucius warned him. Tom waved him off. “It’s probably just Severus. He had to go help Hadrian and the others.” Tom shifted his weight to look at the door. “Enter,” he called out. Draco opened the door and an unexpected figure walked in struggling, with Hadrian forcing her to move. The rest followed suit, confusing the three men who watched the unusual sight.
The wall slowly peeled back, the stones rustling in the wake. It began to reveal a hidden passageway. The opening was smaller than they anticipated, so they both got on their hands and knees and crawled through. Squeezing themselves through the new door, they entered a new area that opened up as they ventured further. It looked unused. A thick blanket of dust covered the area, and a pile of artifacts and antiques were overflowing with cobwebs. “Wow. I don’t think anyone has been back here in a long time.” Tom walked toward the dusted chests and piles. With Severus’s help, they were able to pry them open. What they saw inside filled them with awe. Just like Moody, there were invaluable belongings that were lost in time. The chests were filled to the brim with them. Rummaging around, they saw treasures that many thought were lost forever and priceless objects that seemed to emanate a sort of sentimental value from its original owners. “These...must have been stolen from innocent people by Dumbledore,” Severus finaled. He held up an elaborate painting in his hands, setting it down to look more. “Yes, he must have been collecting for years. I can tell. Moody had something similar to this. Pinned up like trophies from a tournament. I hated him for displaying such horrifics like that. But this...this is much worse. These have belonged to families and friends all over the magic community. They have been meaningful to those people. And Dumbledore goes and destroys their lives, taking what doesn’t belong to him. And the worst part of it is...is that he puts it away like garbage, like they didn’t matter and to hide his doings from everyone.” Tom slammed his hand on the floor, pushing up a dust cloud. Severus let out a small sneeze because of it. “Sorry. Had to get my anger out,” Tom apologized. Tom and Severus kept looking through the piles. All sorts of familiar belongings greeted them: Tom’s old Slytherin pin, a photo of Sirius and Remus when Remy was a baby, and many other objects. They even found pictures of when they were in their school years. Their young and smiling faces seemed to look up at their own. About to set the picture down, Tom found something clinging to the back of its frame. He released the object, finding that it was a small, wooden box with the initials “S.T.R” carved into the otherwise smooth wood. Opening the box, he was surprised to find an object he once thought was lost. Nestled in the smooth black velvet lining was a necklace. Clung to its golden chain was a snake that curved around like a vine, and in its mouth a dazzling emerald. Tom’s hand flew to his mouth as he gasped. “What is it, Tom?” Severus asked, crawling over from his side to his mate’s. Tom held up his find to Severus, who also gasped at its presence. “No way. How is that possible? I remember...but I didn’t think…,” Severus fumbled with his words and at the grasping the wooden box. He let the necklace fall in between his fingers. “The necklace. The one you gave me as a wedding gift. I thought it was lost.” Tom gave Severus a smile. “Dumbledore has been doing that a lot, including to us.” To be holding that necklace once again felt surreal to Severus. First their wedding photo, now this. Little slips of tears fell down Severus’s cheeks. Tom held him close, hugging him for what seemed like hours. “Don’t cry, Severus. We found it.” Severus shook his head. “I’m not sad. I’m-I’m overjoyed,” he sniffled. Lingering for a few more moments, they looked at their other belongings. “I think we should leave them here. We can come back another time. Dumbledore seems to have forgotten this place and won’t be looking here anytime soon. It’ll be our secret place,” he told Tom. Severus didn’t want to leave his necklace there, so he clasped it around his neck and pocketed the box. They made their way out of the small space and crawled out to find the children having fun. They laughed as they experimented different spells on each other. The two of them smiled at the wonderful sight. For the remainder of the time, they supervised the children, even teaching them different spells not taught at Hogwarts. There was very little tension, save for the ongoing arguments between Hadrian and Draco about the incident earlier. “Neither of them are not going to let the other live it down,” Tom thought to himself.
The baby basilisk popped its head out of Hadrian’s pocket, looking around for any danger. “Is it over?” the serpent hissed. Hadrian gave the basilisk a warm smile. “Yes. You can relax now.” The basilisk slithered out of his pocket and hung loosely from his neck like a boa. Hadrian returned to look at the head with indifference. “Pitiful. You foolish, arrogant boy,” Hadrian remarked. He looked at his hand where Ron’s heart was. The heart stopped beating. Its glow dimmed until the last bit of light was snuffed out, like a mirage that has disappeared from view. Hadrian smiled at the still heart. He put his scythe down and summoned a box into his now free hand. It was a small black box gilded with gold. An elegant golden heart charm was set in the center of the lid. Hadrian carefully placed Ron’s heart in the box to make sure his mother’s dinner will not ruin. With the box in one hand and his scythe in the other, he shadow traveled out of the Chamber and into the common room. The place was empty, the only noise coming from the crackling fireplace that usually danced in the night. The young man headed toward his mother’s room and found his mother wrapping his father’s wings. The two looked up at their son to find him with his hands full of presents. “Hades, did you do it?” Severus asked his son. Tom didn’t know what they were talking about, so he looked at their faces for clues. He saw Hadrian and his scythe was covered in blood. “Hadrian….Did you kill someone?” Hadrian turned to his father and told him about his plan about killing Ron and how successful he was. “Sounds like you did an amazing job. I’m proud of you Hadrian,” his father beamed. Severus started to tear up. “I’m so proud of you too. I knew the training would pay off.” Severus and Tom gave their son a hug. When they broke away, Severus became interested in the presents. One of them smelled strongly of blood. “What did you bring?” Hadrian handed him the box. Severus opened it and found a heart. He took a sharp fingernail and sliced into the muscle, withdrawing blood. The vampire lapped it up like it was the most delectable treat in the world. “Thank you, Hades. This is the best present ever. Besides, who’s heart is this?” Hadrian knew that his mother would be happy to hear who the heart belonged to. “It’s Ron’s. I ripped his heart out before I cut off his head.” His mother took another taste, savoring the Weasley's boy’s blood. “Pure wizard blood. One of the sweetest of them all. Next to your father’s of course. I’m going to have a feast tonight. Oh, I almost forgot to ask. Who is your little friend that is dangling around your neck?” Hadrian unwrapped the baby basilisk from his shoulders and held her out to his parents. “I found her when I entered the center of the Chamber. She was hiding in her eggshells. I thought she looked lonely, so I took her with me and decided to keep her.” The basilisk looked at his parents and deemed them friendly. “Hi. It’s nice to meet you,” she hissed at them. “It’s nice to meet you too, little one,” Tom hissed back. The basilisk looked up at Hadrian with big eyes. “That man can speak my language too?” Hadrian pointed to his father. “That man right there is my father, Tom Riddle. Like the both of us, he can speak Parseltongue.” She looked back up at Tom and waved at Tom with her stubby tail. “Hi,” she said in a cute voice. Tom chuckled at her cuteness and Hadrian had wrapped her around his neck again. “I’m going to bed. Also, I have to give Draco his present.” Severus grabbed his son’s arm and pulled him back before he could rush out the door. “Wait. Let me clean the blood of your robes. You don’t want to head to class looking like a mess.” “I can do it myself, mother. Thank you for the offer, though. Besides, I don’t want to get rid of all the blood just yet. I have a plan in store for the Gryffindors tomorrow.” Hadrian stepped out of the room with his serpent friend and headed up to the dorms. Everyone was sound asleep in their beds. Everyone except Draco. Draco was sitting in his bed curled up like a cat, looking out an arm-sized window. He heard Hadrian walk in and sat up straight. His feelings from earlier reminded him that he was mad at his mate, so he turned away and curled back into a little ball. Hadrian walked over to Draco who still turned his back on him. Hadrian knew he had to make up big time for what he did, so he softly spoke his apology to Draco. “Draco, I’m sorry. I didn’t even think that you would take what I did that seriously.” Draco drew a heavy sigh. “Well, I did. I hope you are happy.” Silence filled the room. Hadrian decided to sit down on the side of Draco’s bed, trying to get a little closer. “Come on, Draco. This plan...was what I have been waiting for a long time. To take him out so we can finally be at peace. For the past three years, Ron was bullying you. I was hoping that you would be, I don’t know, happy that he is gone forever. Happy that I took him out, for you.” Draco slightly looked from the spot he was focusing on, and sighed “Ugh, why do you have to be so adorable? I try to stay mad at you, but I can’t. It’s not every day that your boyfriend kills someone for you in the middle of the night.” Draco buried himself in Hadrian’s arms. “I missed you, Hades,” Draco admitted to him. The two hugged for what seemed like an eternity, the night still forever and the moon to remain high in the sky. When they broke apart, Draco noticed Hadrian’s new scaly friend. “Who’s the little guy?” Draco held out his hand so the basilisk could slither onto it. “I found her in the Chamber of Secrets. That is where I led Ron so I could kill him. She was hiding in her eggshells. I was thinking that you should be the one to keep her company. Draco looked at his new familiar who was slithering happily in his arms. “It seems she likes you. What do you want to name her?” Hadrian asked him. “How about Bassi? Bassi, our baby basilisk.” Hadrian facepalmed his forehead. The name was ridiculous. A name such as Bassi for that cute little thing. Bassi, the one who will grow up to be the next fearsome resident in the Chamber of Secrets.``I like the name Bassi!” she hissed. Hadrian groaned at the thought. “Fine. Bassi it is then,” he sighed. Draco led Bassi to the edge of the bed, where she curled up in the blankets and fell asleep. “You must have quite a story to tell, Hadrian, but you must be exhausted. You can tell me in the morning. Right now, I think it’s time for bed. Draco let Hadrian sleep in his bed. They cuddled up together and drifted off to sleep, the burden of guilt lifted off their shoulders.
Slytherin
Next morning...
Creature inheritance: None
In the course of two days, we have had a great deal of losses. According to Professor Dumbledore, the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, he received an ominous letter at the Welcoming ceremony. The letter’s contents contained a malicious declaration that said that Harry Potter, the Boy Who Lived, and Hermione Granger, the Brightest Witch of Hogwarts had been murdered. The letter said that the one who murdered them was the Dark Lord himself! It seems that Harry and his sidekick were not able to escape the Dark Lord’s wrath after all. They may have evaded his grasp for the past thirteen years, but were not so lucky recently. Many students were distraught by the unfortunate loss, for they have adored the two of them. “It seems like yesterday that we were in the classroom together, learning about magic. Hermione and Harry were the ones who helped me with my Potions class. I wouldn’t have gotten my grades up if it wasn’t for them. They helped me find the courage to not give up. And now they’re gone,” one source had said. Another was particularly shaken. “They were the strongest students that Hogwarts had. And they were murdered by the Dark Lord. If it wasn’t for them, Hogwarts would have been under You-Know-Who’s control. With them, the world was a brighter place. What’s going to happen now that they are gone?” another source said. To answer that question, I don’t know. The future isn’t set in stone, especially with how uncertain these times are. Many students were lining up to give their responses for The Daily Prophet, but were too saddened to be able to share. Now that a new year is starting, an unexpected arrival has come to Hogwarts grounds. New transfer students Hadrian and Valorie Riddle and Remy Lupin-Black have been accepted into the school. This raises many questions for our readers: who are these young sorcerers and what are their intentions? With the rise of the Dark Lord comes the rise of his offspring. A little birdie had whispered into my reporter ear and told me that: “The new twins look very similar to Severus Snape, the Potions Teacher at Hogwarts.” I say to my little source that you may need to get your eyes checked out because Severus Snape most certainly does not have any children. These demonic siblings and their odd friend have already made the students and faculty uneasy. No one knows if they are as mean as their parents, but that remains to be seen. Two days ago, we received an anonymous tip revealing that Auror Alastor Moody was murdered in the middle of the night. No one knows who had taken his life, but my writer’s intuition tells me that the new arrivals had something to do with it. Dumbledore and the rest of the Hogwarts faculty are doing everything in their power to prevent anyone else from getting murdered. For now, we can only hope that the future will be better from here on out. To Harry, Hermione, and Moody, we give you flowers for all of your heroic sacrifices. Stay magical, my lovely readers.
I nodded. I wanted to try. "Of course Draco."
“I cannot hear you,” said the Prince.  “The clock is too loud!”
(See the end of the chapter for
It was like he was waiting for me to say so, because he couldn't hold back anymore. He started pounding into me harder and faster. "Yes, Fuck me Draco!" I moaned. He fucked me into the mattress. I screamed my release all over us while he came deep inside me. Once we came down from our highs he slowly pulled out, cleaned us up and wrapped me up with him under the blanket and held me tight.
He looked at me in the eye. "Are you sure?"
So now I knew why Severus was helping me and why the whole hospital thing seemed weird. No wonder I couldn't escape. Well, at least now we had more evidence against Albus Dumbledore.
That was when he realized something strange. It was earily quiet. Everything seemed frozen. Time had stopped. How? He looked up to see a beautiful young woman looking at him. Harry quickly wiped his tears. He didn't know who she was, but he was going to find out.
"I knew it! You are the one!" The Prince exclaimed.
