He thought about himself and Draco. Legally, they were husbands. Legally, they ought to have been celebrating their wedding anniversaries for the last five years. But they didn’t. And they had never introduced the other as their husband, even though their situation was common knowledge by then. In every way that mattered, they were boyfriends. But Harry wanted to be more than that. He wanted to be married to Draco in a way that meant more than some silly certificate. He wanted a ceremony.
Remus collapsed on the ground and found himself crying. He was so thankful and he was so proud. He always knew he made a good decision in making Harry Teddy’s godfather. He was overjoyed that his son would live a better life than any of them ever did.
“No one was snooping! Seamus just recognized it and liked the book, so he got excited and told us about it! I’m not going to go through your books, nobody is! Just calm down, will you?” He was absolutely exasperated and desperate for this to end. Though he had no problem holding his own, he didn’t like conflict.
Upstairs, they entered yet another room who’s purpose Harry didn’t understand. But again, Draco and Arachne were going on about how the room was obviously just a much smaller foyer. There were two hallways yet again. To the left was the master bedroom, a second bedroom, another office, and connected to each bedroom was it’s own bathroom. To the right was three more bedrooms with their own bathrooms. Behind the smaller foyer, was a large balcony that gave a gorgeous view of the backyard and the woods surrounding the house. Wrapped around the house was a wall that came to a gate in the very front. The wall was covered in flowery vines that had grown to crawl up it.
Harry mulled it over a bit, not completely sure himself. He decided to go for the one thing he never did on Halloween. “I want to talk.”
“I could pay you in pleasures.” Draco said nonchalantly, “I’m not a selfish lover, I would love to see how loud you really get.”
The next day came and Harry still hadn’t heard from Draco. By lunch he was starting to get anxious. He decided to bake once again while he slowly lost his fight against blaming himself for the whole ordeal. In his moment of weakness he sent out a letter, reaching out to an old friend, an invitation for tea. It was accepted, and Luna Lovegood suddenly found herself arriving at Harry’s.
Draco had begun pulling his own clothes off and Harry blinked a moment before doing the same. Draco’s eyes were hungry while Harry’s were filled with wonder as they trailed each other. Draco’s body was so pale and lithe, he looked soft. Harry’s was tan and strong, freckled and scarred, he looked like sex.
“Excited that easily?” He chuckled, mostly out of pride. “Come on, Potter. I like a good fight.” He tilted his head and watched as Harry struggled to come up with a response, but was rendered speechless. “Cat got your tongue?” He didn’t even realize that he was slowly leaning closer until he found himself almost leaning over the man.
Harry immediately let Draco go and rolled his eyes. “Now then, let’s see if you really are pathetic.” He said as reached for Draco’s waist. He rested his hands there and looked up at Draco, silently asking for permission.
Harry’s cheeks went pink. “Well ..... neither of us really have anywhere to go after Hogwarts, and we’ll both be teaching there. So. I just. I thought. I thought maybe you’d. You, you might want to stay with me ..... or something. You could have your own room if you wanted! I-I don’t want to pressure you, or anything. Or you could live somewhere else and just visit me.” He was sputtering for his response, quite coy about his intentions. “But. I. Either way I just want you to like it to. I don’t know.”
“Touch me, Harry. Touch me more.” He moaned as he gently set his hand on top of Harry’s. He slowly guided Harry’s hand towards his nipple.
Harry was red once more and he curled up, facing away from Draco. “That’s so embarrassing. Shut the fuck up, Draco. I can’t help it.”
“Well what about yourself? You are no Casanova, but I haven’t seen you around any of the girls that work here.”
Draco rolled his eyes and planted a kiss on Harry’s cheek, giving him a surprised expression and red cheeks. He chuckled and took a seat on the sofa. “I’m putting that in my book.”
“I swear when I get out of here I-“ He cut himself off with a shiver when Draco gripped his growing erection. He wanted to move his hips, he wanted to hump Draco’s hand and get himself off. But he didn’t want to give in so easily, either. It was Draco’s birthday and he wanted to play the fantasy for as long as he could.
His only anxiety left in life became The Quibbler. The newspaper was doing some sort of huge exposé on the Death Eater trials; listing every trial, all the charges, and their outcomes all in one mass article. Molly had made the decision that one Saturday, they should all get together and read it. She thought it would be good for them to all be together, to hear the crimes, and to know the bad guys were getting justice. To know it was finally over.
"Dragons have either brown, gold, or green eyes. Their violet eyes are a rare mutation. We only have a few dragons capable of violet-eyed offspring, only two of which are Romanian Longhorns. Turns out, the mother abandoned the clutch because the father kept picking fights and losing. She took it as unworthiness and abandoned her eggs after laying them. We couldn't take the kids to their father because he wouldn't know or care about them. But their mother rejected them. She kicked Lupus and roared at the other two."
"Because the other one is a lawyer." He said it as if it was obvious. When he saw the blank stare Draco sent him, he realized the other wasn't going to get it, so he explained himself. "Draco, people with important jobs, they tend to be more submissive. CEOs, subs. Lawyers, subs. Politicians, subs. People who work in a position where they have a lot of control and power, are submissive in sex. But a photographer, someone will less control, more likely to be a dom."
Draco then let his tongue lick up and down the small hole, swirling around it and feeling Harry relax under him. He dipped his tongue in just slightly before letting it run around his rim once more, still staying a bit inside of him. He wanted Harry used to something inside of him. He wanted Harry to crave something bigger.
Harry’s cheeks went red and he looked away. “Now I’m cold, git. And you made me fog up my glasses a bit.” Insults were his last effort at regaining any façade of dignity. His display had been quite loud, vulnerable, and embarrassing.
Eventually, Ron knew it was time to let Harry deal with the situation on his own. He said his goodbyes, gave Harry a hug, and left with another bowl of risotto for Hermione because, “She would kill me if I didn’t bring her back some.”
He got a few looks of sympathy, but others were fuming. They couldn't understand how anyone could do this to their own son. For a moment, he felt as if they were angrier at Lucius than he had ever been.
Harry opened his mouth to speak, but was cut off by another man. “It’s Voldemort all over again, but in the opposite direction! Her and her followers will continue this media warfare and she’ll become just like that villain.” Harry silently estimated it would be less than a decade before the rude man gave up politics and could be replaced by someone who wasn’t so ersatz.
They locked eyes. Draco saw a deep sadness and a cry for help while Harry saw another innocent kid who was hurt by the war.
Draco couldn’t hold back his laugh. “Sometimes I just can’t take you seriously. You’re cute and a bottom. But you try.”
"Well that's life, isn't it? It happens whether you're ready for it or not. I know it's too early, but you had to grow up much faster than everyone else, didn't you? I know it's too late, it's time for you to live your life, right?" Luna couldn't do this anymore. Of all people, she was one of the few who never treated Harry as if he was anything other than a normal boy. When they were together, she wasn't the weird girl and he wasn't The Boy Who Lived. She never gave him special treatment, and she certainly wasn't about to start. "It's time for you to be an adult, yea? Toil away in the Ministry, play house with Draco, and one day, if you're lucky, you'll drop dead in the middle of all of it. That's what you want, right?"
“Alright.” Harry thought it was a good idea. He loved the idea of celebrating the little anniversaries.
The more he thought about it, the less he was surprised that the focus of the goblins was to find someone to inherit all of Voldemort’s stuff. It’s what they did. Passing on wealth to the next in line was one of their main jobs. It was a lot to deal with, anyways. He couldn’t blame them for wanting to get rid of it.
“I can fix that.” Harry began dipping his fingers in the rubble of the gingerbread house and scooped up the icing, sucking it off his fingers. His hand was slapped away when he reached back for more.
"You like reading, France, silver, expensive fabrics, you know who you are. I only just figured out what clothes I like to wear." Harry tilted his head. "I really was dehumanized, wasn't I? I never had my own clothes or toys, I didn't have a birthday, I didn't have a favorite color or music because it never mattered. I wasn't a person." He gave a shrug as if he accepted the fact. Harry couldn't make himself look at Draco. The panic rose again and the taste of bile shocked his mouth, though he knew he wasn't going to throw up. There was a fear he felt for people who couldn't hurt him and that he would never have to see again. He supposed there was no point in being afraid but there was no controlling it.
Of course Hermione and Ron stood by his side and supported him, helping him, talking to him, they became a sort of therapy group. They talked about the people they lost, how they felt, they cried together, mourned together, got angry and depressed together. But by the end of it, they felt better.
He wrote his book, invited friends over, went to a few of their houses via Floo, but rarely ever left home. So long as his attacker was still out there, the world was no longer safe. He didn’t mean for it to so drastically effect him and he felt as if he were overreacting. He shouldn’t feel unsafe. Not with Harry by his side and not when he’s already been targeted. Astoria seems to have moved on with her life, but Draco hadn’t.
“Yes. When I was a child, I was mostly ignored. I wasn’t exposed to a lot of conversation so I was late developing. Because of that, I couldn’t talk until I was four. Meanwhile, there are four year olds who can do math and are bilingual. All babies have such a potential for genius, it’s the job of the adults to teach them how to use it.”
Harry didn’t expect that Draco would take in his own fingers so quickly. He was awestruck by the sight of such a collected man fingering himself. It was wondrous view that halted both time and Harry’s breath.
Harry’s jaw dropped and closed his eyes. That information hit him in the gut. He felt like it would be his fault if she ended up dead. “I am so sorry.”
Draco spent the day trying to track down Hannah Abbott in an attempt to set her and Neville up. He asked around and was eventually told she was in the library.
“Forgive me for making myself comfortable, then. This is meant to be my home too, so I’d like to be able to leave my stuff out without anyone snooping!” Draco had no problem with making his expectations clear. Part of him knew this was going too far, but he was tunnel-visioned. All he saw was his own anger. He was angry at the lack of control in his life, angry that his father threw him away, he was angry that he had to live with Harry, and he was angry at himself for reading those books. This made him feel better about it.
It was then that he realized he and Harry hadn’t spoken to each other since Hogwarts. They hadn’t spoken to each other in half a year, and now they were married. They hadn't even made eye contact today.
Harry bit his lip as he watched Draco let out heavy breaths in an attempt to keep his resolve. He saw it as a challenge. He wanted to see Draco’s resolution crumble. He needed to see Draco broken by pleasure. He craved the sights and sounds of a man who’s will has caved in on itself.
Luna said she and Rolf don’t plan on having a permanent home for a few years since they want to travel.
He didn’t because whether or not Harry was his, Harry is allowed to have friends. As for John’s flirting, as far as they knew it part of the running joke around the sanctuary. It wasn’t Draco’s place to take Harry away from something so harmless. So he did nothing.
It all felt very convoluted and twisted to him. It was as if someone had gone out of their way to make him life more complex than it needed to be. Or at the very least, his time at Hogwarts. But it was almost comforting to think that he hadn’t really lost his loved ones. Still, he tried not to get his hopes up.
With that, Harry was left alone in the great hall of Malfoy Manor. He looked around and realized he had more memories of this place than he'd like to admit. He shook his head and forced himself to focus on the task at hand. He climbed the stairs and turned down the hall, counting the doors as he passed them. He came upon Draco’s door and stood outside it a moment. He was nervous, scared even. He didn't exactly know what he was doing. Not much thinking had been involved in his decision to pack up the biscuits and hop on his broom. It was more rash that he'd like to admit. But here he was, he'd come all this way to stand outside the room of his husband with a basket of sweets.
But here, he was all alone and had all the time in the world. His head tilted back, letting out weak groans as his hands roamed even more. After he cleaned every inch of his body, he started on his hair. He was massaging his scalp and keening into his own hands. He buzzed with excitement and his skin craved touch. Upon looking down at himself, he began to wonder if he should get off in the shower or wait till he got in his room.
Draco squirmed at the teasing on his nipple. “Harry, now really isn’t the time to be exploring my body. You know how that feels!”
Draco was very familiar with the way Harry’s eyes moved and knew what he wanted to do. He wanted it too. “You want to kiss me.” It was a statement, rather than a question, but it demanded an answer all the same.
Harry let out a laugh and sat up a bit, reclining against Draco. He started off eating, but somehow ended up feeding Draco berries.
Harry was watching his second batch of brownies bake in the oven. He was starting to slowly struggle with the idea that this was somehow his fault. That he shouldn’t’ve brought up the book, or he should’ve just apologized for his teasing and moved on. Maybe he was a fool to think they could get along. Maybe he was dumb to believe he could make a joke like that without repercussions. But he had to keep reminding himself that Draco was the one who took it too far, and no amount of anger or embarrassment could justify it.
Wizengamot was adamant about prosecuting Lucius Malfoy for abuse, based the comments he made against Draco while he was being suspected of responsibility for the attacks on “traitor” purebloods, all those years ago. It took them a long time to build a solid case. Lo and behold, they used a lot of muggle information on abuse to formulate their case. They pulled out examples of what abuse can look like, how it can manifest itself, it’s effects, and signs of an abuser. Witnesses came forward with small yet very off-putting stories of how Lucius had treated his wife and son. In the end, the general consensus was to lock Lucius away. Less for abuse and more for being complicit in genocide with Voldemort.
Muggle technology becoming enchanted due to magical exposure was common and to be expected. The results of which can vary. Sometimes you get something cool, like the Weasley’s flying car. Other times, you aren’t so lucky.
Draco gave a nod and took a deep breath, “So father really wants nothing to do with me? What about yourself? He knows you lied to Voldemort and therefore gave Harry the chance to kill him, which he did.”
The two copies of the contract held by Molly and Lucius were enchanted so any changes to Demgass' copy was transferred onto theirs. They read over the finalized document, and as unhappy as everyone was about the situation, it was determined that this was good enough.
"They want me to take your scent. They want to know that I like you too so they know you aren't a threat. I can feel that they want me to, and I know they feel my apprehension, they just don't care cause they're little shits.” Eventually, Harry was knocked off balance, and would have toppled over, had Draco not been there to break his fall.
Harry was losing any semblance of shame or pride. He only knew carnality and it’s warm embrace. His only desires were physical and nothing existed beyond the bed.
. You’ve stood up for me so many times, when no one else would. You made me believe in myself, showed me magic.” He hesitated a moment. “I really don’t mean to make you feel uncomfortable or anything, but quite honestly, you were sort of like a mum to me. I didn’t really have anything like that until I met you. You cared about me, and for the longest time, I couldn’t figure out why. It made no sense that anyone would care about me. But you did. I don’t think you have any idea just how important you are to me. I was in a bad place, a really bad place. You got me off the edge more times than you know. I’m not one for dramatics, so you know I mean it when I say I probably wouldn’t be alive right now if it weren’t for you. So, thank you.”
"No, not yet. But I might." He knew exactly what he was implying and he didn't regret it in the slightest. He wanted to be honest with Seamus because for the first time in a long time, he was forming a friendship he actually cared about. Crabbe and Goyle weren't friends, but alliances. Their friendships had been arranged to keep their Houses on friendly terms. He once thought of them as genuine friends, but when he realized how fucked in the head they were, he couldn't make himself care for them. Pansy and Blaise, however, had always been like him, which pushed the three of them closer and closer.
Harry shook his head. “No, uh. I got you something.” He reached under his bed and pulled out the bouquet. “I uh, it’s for Valentine’s Day.” He said softly, giving Draco the flowers.
Harry nodded and then closed his eyes. “I- I want to do that again, sometime. Can we do that all the time?”
Now that Harry has given his evidence, he gave his final statement. “Malfoy and I are the exact same, but we were placed on different sides of the war. After a while, Malfoy resisted what he was supposed to be. But I didn’t. Hell, I broke into a bank and I stole a dragon. So, if you find Malfoy guilty of committing no real crimes, then you have to find me guilty of the murder of Voldemort, destruction of property, countless assaults, and stealing a dragon among many other crimes.”
“Don’t say my name like that, Draco. Fuck!” He could listen to it forever. He was hardly halfway there, but Draco sounded close. He decided to use a hand to stroke Draco, whose name slipped out a few more times.
“Me and Draco have always had long and extensive conversations on our future husbands, current boyfriends, and the men we want to sleep with. So, he’s told me about everything that he likes in men. He always made me promise never to tell a soul, but this is more important.”
His jaw dropped. “He figured me out. Broke me down and played me like a violin! It’s calculated and precise, and he did it all just to make me feel loved! He’s so sweet.” He found Harry’s strategy and effort to be absolutely charming.
Harry froze, his heart flipping and his dick becoming a bit interested in the conversation. “Y-You what?”
Unfortunately, Harry believed that a lie of omission was still a lie, so the serum forced him to talk. His voice came out as frantic. He spoke too quickly and he almost began rocking back and forth. He felt manic.
A moan rolled out of Harry and his back arched up. He’s never had someone’s mouth on him before. It was so warm and wet. He let out a cry when Draco swirled his tongue around the tip. “Draco!”
He turned his head to looked at Harry from the corner of his eye, giving the boy a teasing wink before moving to straddle him. “Don’t move your hips until I say you can.” His tone wasn’t asking or commanding, yet Harry had no deviancy.
Harry gave a small smile and nodded. "Yea." He felt a bit better here. Part of him genuinely couldn't tell if he was physically tired or if he was going to start zoning out again. Either way, it wasn't as bad as it was. "I assumed it would pass, but I didn't think it would be by so much."
It sounded like a dream to Draco. Spending the morning with his future lover, in their pajamas with hot chocolate, and later they’d have a nice Christmas dinner together. “That sounds lovely.” Perhaps, if things went his way, they might be lovers by Christmas. He knew one month was a long-shot, but falling is easy. A person can get a crush on someone they've only just met, or someone they've known for years. It doesn't have to be love, not yet. Falling is so easy, especially when you want to fall. Knowing this, Draco wasn't sure what he wanted. Really, Harry was his only option, but he's grown fond of the lad. He did want to fall in love, he wanted their marriage to be real, but most of all, he wanted it to happen on it's own. He didn't want to manipulate it like he did with his other flings. He'd set them up, the people, the situations, the jokes, the flirting, he set it all up and watched the other fall into lust like a domino. There was no doubt he could do the same with love, but he didn't want to. He wanted to love Harry, and for Harry to love him, all on their own, if that is ever meant to happen. He wasn't afraid to only be friends with Harry for the rest of their lives. He's often heard that it's best to marry your best friend anyways. But he has to shag Harry, even if it's only once. He knew he'd never die happy if he didn't sleep with the man before him. He’s also always wanted to have Christmas sex, so he hoped everything lined up in his favor this month.
It was then that Draco realized there was something terribly wrong with him. He wasn’t even thinking of tradition anymore, he just wanted to mess around with Harry. Maybe it was the way Harry naturally spoke to his love languages by caring for him, the fact that Harry accepted his books, or maybe it was that Harry was a bit funnier and kinder than he remembered. Whatever it was, he knew he was starting to feel feelings that weren’t mutual and it was manifesting itself in a foolish lust. Of course, he wouldn't say he was even close to fancying Harry, but he knew the potential was there. He didn’t know what to do with himself anymore.
The question was a bit more difficult to answer than Harry wanted to admit. His first instinct was to not tell the truth and he hated that. He wanted to be honest and he knew he should be honest, but he also knew how shady and amoral his dealings would sound. He didn't want Draco to think of him differently or to see him in the same way he saw the followers of Voldemort. Though their interests are very dissimilar, he knew the tactics would sound identical. He was getting what he wanted through puppet leaders, manipulation, intimidation, and by controlling the press. Throw in a few unforgivable curses and there wouldn't be a difference.
He had to have an excuse since he didn’t want to tell her that he was asking with the intention of telling Neville. At least, not at the moment. It depended on how casual she was about the conversation.
Draco rolled his eyes at Harry’s question just as a moan slipped out. “Yes.” He began to bounce a bit harder, starting to enjoy the feeling. Every sensitive patch inside of him was being lit up with pleasure, there were even a few deep inside of him that he hadn’t known existed until now.
There was something so pure about the way Harry whined and shook through the pleasure. It was so innocent and overwhelmed, and Draco couldn’t help but to enjoy watching.
Harry gave up. He felt warm and fuzzy, and Hozier’s hypnotically sexy voice was pouring from the radio. Perhaps you can force someone to relax. He weakly pulled back the covers and said, “Come on then, lay down with me.”
“I swear it, Potter.” He tilted his head and raised an eyebrow. “Out of curiosity, how far would you let me go?” There was a note of seriousness behind his words. He wasn’t just teasing, he really wanted to know.
Draco could never hope to resist such a command. His eyes were filled with devotion as he looked upon Harry’s glorious form. He pulled back to only his fingertips and another finger slid in. Somehow, the process was easier with a third fingertip. As if Harry’s body knew it was coming and wanted it.
Draco handed the bunny back to Teddy, who got to work chewing the bunny’s ear. He then started to reach for Harry, who picked him up and set him on his lap, letting him lean against his chest since he can’t sit up on his own yet.
“I, uhm. I told one person. Once.” Harry said softly. “A neighbor. She asked about a bruise, I was young and stupid, so I told her the truth.” He stared at the ground long and hard. “She got confused, like she couldn’t believe they would do that, so she talked to them. They spun the story around so it was my fault. They said that I got the bruise when my aunt hit me, which was true, but that I deserved it for not cleaning as good as I was suppose to. I told my neighbor it happened all the time, even when I do nothing at all. But they told her that it only happened when I did something bad. And she believed them! She fucking believed them! She told me I was just confused, as if I didn’t really know what happened. I know what bloody happened!” He shook his head, looking up at Draco with a heartbroken expression, tears threatening to fall. His sadness broke and was replaced with anger. "And one day she comes and talks to me, telling me about how wonderful my aunt and uncle are. She told me that, to my bloody face, as if she didn't know about what happened!"
Harry peeled his eyes opened and looked up to see Draco was looking down at him, ocean eyes full of love, soft blonde air, the golden sun shining through their curtains. Harry was in awe.
He was filled a few seconds longer as Draco collected himself and pulled out. He nearly collapsed onto the bed and took a few deep breaths to calm himself down.
Draco reported his findings to the group that night and there was no doubt that Dean and Seamus were still completely infatuated with each other, even after four years of nothing.
He glanced at the time and saw that it was already nearly ten, the party began just after lunch, and Draco would want to have a few hours to get ready, so he knew now was the best time for Draco to wake up.
He's been in plenty of conversations where someone will go on about their sex life, sometimes in a bit too much detail, but no one has ever mentioned getting magic involved. Besides that, plenty of the grown witches and wizards that he’s met are complete prudes.
When the first day of June arrived, Harry ate breakfast, went to take his Transfiguration exam, had lunch, and then was off to his Charms exam.
Draco chuckled and got off of him, finally letting Harry up. “Oh shut up. I’ll just hold you instead.” But it was then that they both realized Draco was also hard.
Although Harry still didn’t question it, he was extremely suspicious at the amount of detail the Marauders had on his father. It only confirmed his theory on their identity. He might be a bit oblivious, but he wasn’t stupid.
“Really?” She asked, “Because it seems like he is. He wrote one Howler and you hide your face in the table and can’t come up with the balls to respond. You lost Draco.”
Harry just browsed around at whatever books there were. He noticed a few biographies, some history books, lots of stuff on dark arts, ancient spells and runes, but nothing too interesting. Of course he was curious about what the restricted section had to offer, but after that one book screamed in his face all those years ago, he’s been wary about looking around again.
Perhaps none of them were ready for parenthood just yet. Maybe some of them never will be. But they have time. They have all the time in the world.
“Apparently.” She scoffed, “The nerve of that man. Sometimes I can’t believe I married him. He really only did it for my money. I knew it but I still fell for him. You must think me a fool.”
"Must you be so desperate to prove yourself?" Draco teased, "Though that is true. And you're a better cook, but I am the better decorator and the best dressed."
It also brought Teddy closer to everyone else, and he became comfortable around Narcissa. Before she left, he hugged her and told her he would see her soon.
Once Harry started a task he had a hard time stopping until it was finished. He grew up learning to get a large amount of things done quickly and quietly. The habit stuck with him. He breezed through books like they were nothing and continued to read until the next day.
Draco nodded and let out a sigh. “You have no idea.” He said it as if Harry’s misplaced coyness was somehow tiring to him.
“Wow.” He said softly. It was all he could get out for a moment. No one had ever done so much to make him feel loved before. No one had worked that hard for him. He understood now that this was a relationship that was much more serious and strong than any other before. It made him momentarily uncomfortable. But when he looked down at Harry again, he felt a certain sureness. That somehow, everything would be alright.
Harry was soon handed a piece of parchment entitled, ‘The Cupboard Project’. He raised an eyebrow when he realized it was a rough plan for social services. “You named this after me?”
Harry didn’t even look up, “I never went to sleep.” He said it as if it didn’t even matter. “I’m already on V. There’s a good bit on Vampires and Veelas, but there’s also a lot about the veil and voids.” It seemed he was only interested in discussing the subject matter of his books. He couldn’t care less about sleeping.
That morning, Harry casually mentioned that he had been talking to Hermione’s landlady and that he’d been discussing the purchase of his own house. He told Draco that he was going to be looking at his favorite property that day and offered to take Draco with him.
He stripped himself and stood in the mirror, examining his body. He already knew that no amount of worry about stop him from sleeping with Draco, but he still found himself nervous.
“I know, but you can’t live like that. You need to relax. You’ll end up miserable, even dead if you keep stressing yourself.”
Harry looked absolutely starstruck. He leaned in a bit closer and looked right into Draco’s eyes, seeing things they weren’t there before. He saw the way the blonde’s eyes seemed to be predominantly grey with strands of blue tuning through them. It wasn’t just one color, but two distinct ones. He had no idea. He also saw little flares of lighter grey, he saw the way Draco’s pupils flickered and then widened from the eye contact. “Your eyes are gorgeous. I had no idea.” He sat back and took in the rest of Draco. His jawline was sharper than he remembered. His eyebrows were composed of thin and individual hairs rather than the blurry blocks of color he was used to seeing. They even had a slight shape to them that he had never noticed before. His chin had a slight cleft in it and his lips were thicker than he thought. They used to sort of blend in to the rest of his face, but now he saw their distinct pink shape. “You’re beautiful. You’re so beautiful and I had no idea.” He was talking without thinking. Had he been giving his words a second thought, he wouldn’t have said any of that.
Harry took this moment to pull out the map to see about his friends. He waved his wand and solemnly swore he was up to no good. With that, he was greeted by his friends. He took this time to explain the hilarious story of how he broke his arm and bruised his rib, how he’s spent the last few days as Draco’s patient in the hospital wing, and how he’s finally gotten the balls to flirt with Draco.
Draco quickly tore his clothes off and began stroking himself with his lubed hand, trying to get as slick as possible.
It was a nice conversation, teasing their lovers and subtly pointing out how attractive they found the other. Pansy, Hermione, and Luna thought it was absolutely adorable.
Draco hated every second of it. He hated how John spoke about Harry, he hated how Harry enjoyed being spoke to like that. He knew Harry deserved better. Harry deserved something much cooler than a few cheesy pickup lines about having sex, or about how good he looks. John’s lines were crude and rudimentary. Draco knew he could talk circled around the other man. If he were a bit more selfish, he’d probably start spouting out his own lines and whisk Harry away to make good on his flirting. But he didn’t.
Harry frowned, “I don’t see how anyone can do that to their own child.” He hated how Draco was being treated by his father. He acted as if their relationship didn’t matter at all to him and it disgusted Harry.
"Well, I feel now would be a great time to inform you that I've heard a few things that were said while I was out." He gave a smug grin and watched as Harry already began to look embarrassed. "I mostly only remember things my mother said, but you were quite the sweetheart, yea? I heard your voice, and you didn't shut up for the longest time. So I began to listen. I was able to focus a bit and I heard you saying that we were the same and deserve each other." He tilted his head, ever the pillar of pride. "Romantic, yea? Keep talking like that and you just might get in my pants sooner than you think." He winked. It seemed as if that was all he had to say, but he suddenly remembered, "Oh, I almost forgot the best part! You said you'd spend the rest of your life making me feel loved." He set a hand over his chest and found his necklace under his hospital gown. He held it and watched Harry shift from his chest warming up. "I never thought I'd end up with someone like you."
Harry woke up the next morning with a soft moan. There was a hand in his hair, petting him and gently scratching his scalp. His back arched softly and one of his hands drifted up to trap the hand in his hair, preventing it from leaving it’s place.
It all started a few days after Valentine’s Day, when Harry referenced Draco’s letter. “So, did you ever experience the raw honey of me?”
The first letter sent by Draco is from a poem by Nancy Boutilier, the only change being a female pronoun "her" changed to the word “your” in the last line.
Harry quickly nodded. “Yes ma’am, thank you.” When he left, there was a noticeable spring in his step.
Harry closed his eyes in relief and felt like he won a lottery. Narcissa ran to Draco, hugging him and crying. Draco was magically bound to the chair but was promptly released, and he hugged his mother. They were both in tears.
“Whatever.” He then grinned at the memory of what they had just done. “I had you on your back begging to cum, that was so hot.”
“My grandmother, she ..... she was old-fashioned. Strict.” Neville said, but it was obvious he wasn't comfortable talking about his own experience.
Harry shifted a bit. It was very strange that his magic wasn’t working, and Draco’s calm demeanor somehow made him even more anxious.
"No, it's fine. I don't mind it at all." He reassured before motioning to the Floo. "See you after work, love."
"Of course! If you're thinking about writing then I have to do everything I can to encourage you to do it."
Draco stood back and admired the tree before reaching into the last bag and pulling out the topper, a star. "Be a dear and put that on the tree." He handed it to Harry with a grin.
First was the Black family, obviously. Second was the Ollivanders which made sense considering they monopolized wands. Third was the Potters.
“Yes, but she had suspicions since third year. She wrote about it in her journal.” He found Draco walking around the hospital wing and he smiled. He watched as Draco spent most of his time in the back room where they brewed medicine.
Most of Wizengamot gasped. It was a lot more vocal than Harry expected. They all seemed so surprised, a few older members looked disgusted though he couldn't be sure why. Maybe they didn't like the idea of two men being married or maybe it was because Draco had once been like them.
Harry couldn’t stop himself from grinning. “I didn’t think you felt the same way so I guess I wanted a distraction. Are you jealous?”
Now the three of them stood in Gringotts bank, five minutes early and with the Malfoys nowhere in sight.
Harry let out a laugh, “Merlin, life would have been a lot easier if I'd had you around to stick up for me, Prongs.”
It was a wonderful way of passing the time. Getting to see his lover indulge in his passion was something that Harry never knew could be so beautiful. But it was. He was so focused and that made the features on his face tighten up a bit. It looked just a bit awkward but he thought it was adorable. Even the way he softly mouthed the words as he wrote them was cute. He found it especially cute when Draco made faces and seemed to react to his own writing. But the analytical expression that fell over him when he finished a scene and went in to edit was also attractive in it's own way. It was so overwhelmingly casual. He was seeing a part of Draco that he knew no one else got to and it was important to him. He never knew how gorgeous passion was until he saw Draco wearing it.
Harry smiled, “Exactly! Hogwarts is full of fine pieces of arse of many varieties. Why be picky? My best friend Ron, he has a whole handful of brothers. I keep telling him that if he makes me mad I’ll sleep with all of them.”
“Yea, she’s a bit aggressive, but that’s what makes her good. She gets in your face till you back down. She intimidates people into forgetting about the game and moving out of her way. One of our strongest players.” Harry agreed.
An owl came tapping at his window and he tilted his head. He opened it and took the letter from it's beak, watching it fly away. He looked down and his stomach churned as he saw it was from Hermione. He opened it after taking a deep breath and grimaced, preparing to be scolded like Pansy and his mother had done.
seen The Quibbler. Harry had only agreed to share his story in order to raise awareness and gain support for the bill, which ended up being unanimously passed. Harry's newfound political influence was the only hope that Draco had left. It's what gave him the gall to scoff in his father's face, “Even so, he has all the time in the world to change the law! The marriage will be nullified!”
Draco could tell he was stressed so he took a cautious step forward. “I might understand some of it.” He offered, “I was taught all about wizarding law growing up.”
Draco raised an eyebrow, “I’ve never before seen a teenage boy decline pleasure while having a boner.”
After discussing Neville’s Herbology ambitions, it went around the booth, everyone discussing their dreams. Ron wanted to be an Auror and Hermione wanted to be Minister for Magic. The position was currently held by Kingsley Shacklebolt, who was pioneering the arrests of dark wizards. He’s likely gonna have his job for another decade or so, which gave Hermione plenty of time to gain support and rise through the ranks.
Harry listened. All this time he’s been sort of alienated to Death Eaters, it was hard to imagine them as multidimensional people with lives and feelings and passions. But perhaps it was easier that way. It’s easy to hurt a stranger, it’s easy to hurt someone if you don’t see them as a full person. Not to say he saw them as less than human. But he didn’t know their ambitions, families, he knew nothing about them besides their anger. It’s easy to hurt someone when they seem like a background character in a story with no backstory or life. It’s very easy. It was in that moment that Harry realized, if he ever needed to hurt Draco for some reason, he wasn’t sure that he could do it. He didn’t want to hurt Draco, but if he had to, he would hesitate first.
Teddy stuck half his hand in his mouth and hummed happily. He then picked up one toy and handed it to Harry.
“Merlin, go to bed.” Harry whined as he went into his room, but Draco stood in the doorframe before Harry could shut it. He tilted his head and waited for Draco to speak.
After a bit more conversation, they said their goodbyes. Harry waved his wand and ended their connection. The map was nothing more than parchment again, and Harry put it back in his trunk.
She turned to Harry and seemed to have lost her breath as her breath had picked up. Her tone somewhat frantic tone displayed just how panicked she had become. "Get a nurse, she's moving!"
Harry Potter. Apologies, sir, I didn't know your face." The elf let him in and took his broom. "Draco is in his old room. Upstairs, third one down the hall."
Harry chuckled at the thought. "Oh, I hope they have fun with it." He agreed as he went down the hall to toss his robes into his room. He returned and sat down on the couch, about to say something until his eyes hit the copy of Witches Weekly on the table. "Ah, I was told they wrote something about me." He said as he picked up the magazine and began flicking through the pages. "Where did you get this?" He knew Draco wasn't subscribed, but after only a second of thought he answered his own question, "Seamus, yea?"
“There, five minutes and no more, just like you said. Your rib’s fine now and your arm needs just another week in the cast.”
The pointed tip of a tongue slowly teased his rim, sliding from the outside to just against the inside, flicking against the sensitive opening.
He saw the first was a historical romance about two cowboys, which he thought was really hot. Another was about two friends who work in the Ministry together. The third was about an Auror and a Ministry spy who he mistakenly thinks is the enemy, when really, they’re hunting down the same person. He got quite excited about the one. The fourth was very explicitly just a collection of erotica. As much as Draco wanted to hold on to his pride and leave the book be, he couldn’t help but to indulge. He attributed it to his desire to explore his sexuality, and, he could use a bit more late-night entertainment.
He took his time to explore Harry's skin. He ran his fingers over each muscle, curve, and scar that Harry had to offer. His fingertips left a trail of sparks and flickers that threatened to set Harry on fire. But with each sinful touch, Harry's body craved the flame more and more. By the time Draco’s hands reached his hips, Harry was flushed and burning with desire.
Dean immediately agreed, “They’re gorgeous. I still haven’t decided if they’re more blue than green or vice verse. I think it’s mostly blue with a little green hue. He also has those lovely specs of brown near his pupil, it’s beautiful.”
Draco was utterly overwhelmed and reduced to incoherent moaning in a matter of seconds. The ordeal lasted only five minutes before he was left in stark euphoria.
“We have two beds and a silencing charm.” He pointed out as he got up to unpack his bag. He planned on studying, but part of him was ready and willing to pounce on Harry if the opportunity arose.
Harry was anxious, but felt a bit better at the sight of a familiar goblin toddling up to him. “Demgass?” He managed a small smile.
Draco hesitated, but shook his hand. His own soft and pale in contrast to the tan and callused one. “Right. And you ran off to be a dragonologist. You seem to be doing well. I assume you and all the dragons get along, then?”
“I could use magic to skip some of the foreplay and get right to the filthy fun of it. But I don’t want your first time to be so fast. If I’m to deflower you, I want you to experience every beautiful second of it.”
Dean looked over and let out a whistle, soft enough so only Harry noticed. Harry looked over and his eyes immediately went to Draco’s bum. He had never really noticed before, but it was pretty cute. Of course it wasn’t big or very plump, it was more of a soft curve. But his pants fit it so well, it was difficult not to get distracted.
Now Draco was less shocked and more considerate. “Oh.” He said softly, thinking it might be a good idea. "I wouldn't even know where to begin. Few publishers would even take a book like that, and I don't know what I'd do if my name was attached to something like that." He was a more comfortable with his sexuality, but not THAT comfortable.
“An article came out bashing Crow and Hermione’s friendship, which we got ‘Mione to use in making Crow sway more members of Wizengamot. She played up the guilt Crow felt in someone having their reputation hurt for being friends with her. Then I spoke with my partner in The Daily Prophet and found out the source for the story was Garren.”
Harry glanced up at him and stretched. “Oh, hey. How was dinner?” The jumper rose up just enough for Draco to get a peek at Harry’s skin. His own eyes wandered to the small part of Draco's chest that he could see. He knew exactly what was going on. They were going to spend the afternoon teasing each other and he already loved it.
Harry found himself agreeing. “I know. I just want to get the conversation over with and have everything go back to the way it was. I don’t like these empty spaces in-between.”
The blonde froze when he realized what he had done. He was incredibly embarrassed by what happened with his book but he knew that was no excuse. He should’ve listened to Harry’s reasons and accepted that it happened, he should’ve moved on. But those books were important to him and the weight of many months of frustration decided to come out. His book was the straw that broke the camel’s back.
Andromeda smiled, “I felt the same way with Nymphadora.” She looked sad for a moment. It was the first time she said her name since the war.
Neither of them really understood how or why they were only like this with each other. But they didn’t question it too much, having someone there to talk to was more than enough.
Harry rolled his eyes and let Narcissa dominate the conversation with Draco. He'd seen her nearly fall apart over him and didn't want to interrupt. He didn't feel ignored or anything of that sort, he simply recognized that he had all the time in the world since they lived together. But Narcissa needed right now.
Now he felt a bit worse because he hadn’t done anything for Harry. Part of him wanted to come out and ask what Harry likes. Part of him thought being open about it would make it less special. All in all, he had no clue what to do. He decided to start at the beginning, which was that he knew what Harry had done.
Maybe he needed to fool around, romantically. It was expected that he and Harry would fall in love, as with most pureblood arrangements, so Draco concluded he should expect love to happen. With that in mind, he saw no problem in eventually starting to flirt with Harry. It was all according to tradition, after all. But it was then that Draco realized he had no idea if Harry even liked men. He'd only ever date women and he didn't give off any obvious indicators, like reading homosexual romance novels. A wave of guilt washed over him as he realized Harry probably intended to marry a woman and have children.
Draco smiled and headed towards the door, opening it. He saw how tense Harry was and tilted his head. “Do holidays normally make you so stressed?”
Harry’s eyes widened, “I-Inappropriate?” He felt like the conversation had taken a sharp turn from where he thought it was going.
Hermione rolled her eyes and turned back around, continuing to lead Harry through the busy Ministry. “Just come on, Minister Shacklebolt wants to see you.”
The plan was for Harry to keep the map in his pocket so he wouldn’t have to explain why he was carrying it around.
Harry hesitantly reached down and cupped himself so he’d have better friction than just the sheets. He dragged his hips across his hand as quickly as he could and trembled at the pleasure. The moans started up again, this time a bit muffled. He was trying so hard to be quiet but he also wanted to hurry up and finish. The faster pace made him louder than before. He moaned out into his pillow and he briefly worried about whether or not Draco could hear him. That was a huge mistake.
“It’s insane to think that I can still talk to him. He’s still here.” Harry grinned. He was obviously a bit overwhelmed and Draco understood that. “I never thought I’d be able to talk to him. I thought he was just gone.”
Draco chuckled. “You make even that sound so cute.” He commented as he moved to give gentle kisses around the man’s ear. From fooling around in his youth, he was very good at keeping in his noises, but he didn’t want to. He wasn’t coy or hesitant. He wanted to give Harry everything he had. Every noise, kiss, movement of his hips; it was all Harry’s.
"I just want to marry you. We could do it naked in your flat if you wanted, we could make out vows in the bed, seal it with much more than a kiss for all I care. I don't mind where or when, I just want to spend the rest of my life with you."
He trembled and writhed, feeling completely overwhelmed by the pleasure. He tightened his grip on his pillow and then his hand began to search for purchase on his sheets. His cries became louder and all he could do to stay silent was letting out pathetic whimpers and sobs in place of something louder. His back arched and he turned his face to the side, pressing his cheek into the pillow. His knees bent and his legs spread, allowing himself a better angle so he could move his hips faster and grind down harder. He accidentally let out a soft cry. He felt his thighs and lower stomach begin to quiver as he was able to go faster and harder.
Alex took the parchment and looked it over. Their lips parted in shock. “This ..... This is big! You want
“To trade. We melt Galleons, trade it for cheap silver in the Muggle economy, melt the silver, have it minted into Sickles, and trade the Sickles for Galleons.” Perhaps he was going into detail with it.
When Harry heard nothing more, he realized Draco was genuinely asking. He blinked a few times and tried to respond. “Uh, well. You came.” He shifted his hips hesitantly. He was still burning with pleasure, his body keening towards an edge that he hadn’t reached, desperately clawing for it, only to be slowly pulled further away with each passing second.
He ended up scrambling to sit against the wall, turned to the side so he didn’t have to face anyone. He panted for air and felt his heart thub in his ears. His chest ached and he felt like he was choking. He felt himself sweating as tears fell from his eyes. He hated being like this, especially in front of others. He tried to calm himself down, but the moment he stopped panting, a pained whine slipped from his throat. He shivered and stared at the ground, feeling just as helpless as he did when he walked out into the woods to die.
Now he was interested. “So, you’re suggesting I pick someone with a less-than-perfect record?” He shook his head and pulled himself back to the matter at hand, "Why are you even telling me this?"
“Why are you feeding me?” Of course Draco had no problem with it, he was only curious. He thought it was sweet Harry would do it for him.
Draco’s jaw dropped. “Shut up, Harry. You bloody bastard.” He grumbled as they walked on to their dorm.
Draco nodded, seeming relieved. "Right then. Let's go on to this ..... shack." He obviously wasn't happy about the arrangements.
“I want you to be happy too, and I know my father will never make you happy. He doesn’t love you, maybe he did, maybe he didn’t, but he doesn’t now. You deserve better than that. You deserve so much more. I want you to be okay. I don’t want to worry that you’ll die in that loveless marriage, miserable. He’s my father, I love him, but he isn’t good. I want you to rebuild your relationship with your sister, to meet Teddy, meet Harry, I want you to be happy. I wish you could run away with us and be in our little family.”
With each page he felt his chest hollow out like a wound, his heart dropped, his eyes burned, and his jaw ached with the desire to cry out. Everyone he lost, they were so innocent then. So carefree and childish. They were just children, they were his friends and family, and now they’ve been murdered. He never considered the fact that his parents and their friends started out as just a group of children. They were only children, then they grew up and decided to fight for what was right, and then they died for it. The journal was almost too much for him. He saw them as the children they once were. Pulling pranks, dating, wondering about the future, entirely unaware of the war that would kill them all. They were carefree, their only troubles being their classes. In those small hours, forever embalmed on paper, they were children. Playing Gobstones, Quidditch, Wizard's Chess, studying, joking, laughing, and smiling. They were just children.
Neville suggested they lock Dean and Seamus in a room together until they confessed. Everyone agreed it was a good plan, but a bit rash.
He sniffled, a bit hesitant. “Tell my mother that no one will ever hurt me again. Tell her that I turned out alright.”
Of course he still made time for his friends, but their afternoons in the common room were soon invaded with Harry’s book. No matter what, he always had a book in his hands. At meals, he read while eating. At night, he would fall asleep reading. He would even try to sneak his books into class to read.
He laid there a minute longer and then he heard silence. He raised an eyebrow and then heard Harry saying, “Shit, not again.” In a groggy and tired voice.
Of course, he’s grown a bit of an issue with most authority figures. After his own case in Wizengamot where he was left feeling berated and blamed, he’s especially hated Wizengamot. So he was quite excited to come in and tear them all a new one.
Exactly three days ago, Harry had received an unexpected letter from Lucius Malfoy. He stared at it a solid minute before finally opening it and reading it’s contents. It took precisely four paragraphs for Harry’s entire world to fall apart around him.
"Wait, what? You two can't be serious." Pawk suddenly felt as if she was suddenly in over her head. She was very aware of the rules that the two had to break and bend for the sake of the revolution, but she didn't expect them to carry over into politics. Though she's never faced opposition quite like them, she knew how to fight. But this was a warfare she was entirely unfamiliar with. "Where are you even getting these ideas from?"
“Oh, I’d fancy a nice lad. Someone taller than me, with black hair and dark eyes. I’ve also found myself a fan of short hair, little curls too.” Seamus said, all while thinking of how gorgeous Dean’s arse is. “I’d like someone kind, who likes sports just as much as me.” He bit his lip, “Someone, maybe a bit tan.” He was getting worried that he was being too obvious, but Dean was none the wiser.
"Well, his personality isn't intolerable either." He said as he finished setting up the kitchen table, arranging the pinecones and berries around the silver vase of roses. "As I said, we talk for hours every night. I've learned a lot about him. He also makes me laugh, and he isn't afraid to tease me." Most men he spent time with were too intimidated by his name to treat him as anything less than superior.
Draco was sat to the side, on his knees, when Harry got ahold of him. A surprised groan came from him as he was touched. “Eager much?” He asked as a small smile graced his face. It was hardly enough to mask his surprise. But a sweet shock took over his expression as Harry moved to put his lover in his mouth. The warmth alone was enough to make him struggle not to buck his hips.
Draco got a few presents and a chocolate cake. He was immensely happy with how it turned out. To him, it was absolutely perfect. Harry had gotten him three more pairs of scrubs and a few medical supplies he could use in his career as a Healer. He had also gotten him some flower seeds, “for the garden I know you’ll want to grow.” It meant everything to him.
Harry couldn’t help but to laugh as his face was coated in kisses. “What the hell?” The complement was a bit confusing to him, but he decided to take what he could get. “Thanks, I think.”
Sleep closed the gap between them. Their bodies were happy to feel the warmth of another. They were very used to sleeping alone, but the warmth of another body was too tempting to resist. It was comforting, relaxing, it was just what they needed.
“You should talk to McGonagall. I heard that this year we have a substitute teaching standard lessons that McGonagall wrote up, she’ll be lookin to hire as soon as possible.” Seamus pointed out to encourage Harry.
After they sang him happy birthday, he blew out the candle and they went into the dining room to eat it.
Harry slowly grounded himself with Draco’s questions and blue eyes. The smoke evaporated and he found himself mostly able to breathe again.
Harry took a deep breath and felt a soft smile spread across his face. It felt like everything was coming together. He was inching closer and closer to being able to focus on The Cupboard Project. Though it was cold and there wasn't much nature to enjoy, he found himself putting on more casual clothes and the coat Draco got him. He stepped outside and ended up sitting against a tree just on the edge of the forest he lived by.
“But, he is to move in with you and become part of your House. This is highly unusual.” Lucius argued.
“So good, love. You made me feel so good. Now it’s your turn, yea? Go on. Show me how good it feels.”
He glanced at the time and realized it was only a little past lunch. He still had the whole afternoon to himself as Draco wouldn’t be back until after dinner.
Draco smirked and raised an eyebrow. "Are you going to blush every time I complement your cooking? Of course, that won't deter me, but you act as if you don't know you have a talent."
Tears were falling down his face, his jaw ached with the urge to cry out, his eyes burned, and his lower lip trembled. Only three seconds had passed and he nearly felt lightheaded with all the memories and emotions that flooded him.
Harry noticed and elaborated a little further, “Draco was a bully to me and my friends. But he wasn’t a bully because he’s just an ass, he was a bully because that’s what he was taught to be. Every child wants to grow up and become someone that their family approves of, being the child of a Death Eater and surrounded by blood-purists didn’t give him a good start. My point is, Draco didn’t have a choice in who he became, he can’t be blamed for it because he was only trying to please his family.” Harry tilted his head, “And even so, what crimes has he really committed? He hesitantly took the Dark Mark to please his father, and at his absolute worst, he proved to be a mild inconvenience. He never really did much to hurt or stop us. He’s committed no real crimes.”
Draco, and that made his eyes widen just a bit. Shocked that his brain would even go there, he decided to refocus and start up a conversation to distract himself. "Cold outside, yea?" He was immediately ridden of any confidence as that was seriously what came out of his mouth. Of all the conversation starters, he decided to point out that it was cold while in the middle of fucking winter.
Narcissa smiled. The idea sounded so lovely and warm to her. It made her want to run away and never go back to that house. But it wouldn’t be that easy. Nothing will ever be so simple for her. “You have no idea how wonderful that sounds to me. It sounds so nice and warm. But I may never have that. I’ve made my choices Draco, I’ve lived my life. I may not have lived it well, maybe I never lived at all, but I did it. It’s over for me, please. Don’t worry about me. Know that if you’re happy, then I have absolutely no regrets. You’re the best thing I’ve ever done. You have no idea how proud I am of you. Go be happy. I’ll be alright.”
The happy air came under attack by something heavy. It leaked into the room and blanketed the lightness like oil on water. Something in their hearts and minds demanded to be out in the open. Something demanded to be said, and they each knew what it was. The room turned sour and they shifted, trying to occupy themselves, trying to do anything other than confess. But this was so different from their other urges to confess. This time, they were so completely alone. There was only them, in a small house, surrounded by forest. They were utterly isolated. Anything could happen and there was no concern for the outside world. It was so incredibly domestic that they could almost convince themselves they were already together, that there was no need to voice the words that hung in the air and aimed to smoke them out. Still, in the strangling atmosphere, they remained unmoved.
Harry gripped the sheets while needy wails ripped from his throat. He squirmed and quivered. Draco’s lubed fingers made him loose, wet, and warm in a place that had never been before. He felt dirty in the best possible way. He bit his lip and his body shook as he realized how much he enjoyed something so obscene. He pulled the sheets, grabbed at his own hair, rocked his hips back faster and harder. He did anything he could to cope with the pleasure that made him tremble and roar. The last of his hesitance and doubt were fingered out of him and he gave one more demand.
“I know. And if I had to pick someone right now to take over, I’d choose you in a heartbeat. Keep your grades up and see me about an application after you graduate.” She offered, not even thinking twice about it. She knew Harry was interested in the job, she knew he could do it as evident by the DA, and she trusted him.
Draco bit his lip and gave a small smile at the feeling of Harry cumming inside of him. It was a familiar tickle, deep inside of him. Something about it was satisfying. Not the act itself, but the actor. It was the fact that he made
Harry only glanced at him and laughed. "You know you're strong enough to push her off. Just give her a little nudge."
“I’ve been taller than you since fifth year.” He pointed out as he realized he had to look slightly down to meet Harry’s eyes. He was easily about ten centimeters taller.
“Come on, Draco. We need to find the table Hermione got for us. We can bring Pansy.” He suggested, a bit nervous. He wasn’t sure why, but he felt highly uncomfortable with where he was and wanted to find his friends and sit down. Of course, it wasn’t due to Draco or Pansy, he just felt really weird. Maybe he did have a problem with crowds? Or maybe it was the loud music? He wasn’t sure but it felt like shopping for Christmas decorations all over again.
“It’s really fine, in the end it was my choice.” Harry said, not wanting anyone to feel bad. But by the same token he also wanted to bludgeon them all.
Harry closed his eyes and balled his fists as his mind went completely blank. He didn’t mean to still be anxious about starting up conversations with Draco, but this was just so domestic and couple-y. He was worried about making the other uncomfortable. “Well, I was thinking about getting a Christmas tree, and uhm, I was just, I was wondering what you thought about that?” He felt so stupid.
Louis Luther was found guilty of three counts of magical assault and exposing magic to Muggles. The sentence; Azkaban.
He had a moment to think hours later, when he was brushing his hair and teeth. It was then was his content mood subsided and thinking over his dream, he realized that he still didn’t care. He didn’t care at all for the people he’d hurt. But this time was different. Rather than yearning for the ache of regret and empathy, he was entirely indifferent to every aspect of it. He was indifferent, shrugged, and stopped thinking about it.
Eventually, the conversation shifted to talk about their futures. They filled each other in on their lives. Internships, acceptances, and future homes.
“Of course. Hermione and Luna are fucking adorable. I’d never once thought of dating them and I never will, but you can’t tell me they aren’t adorable. Seamus and Dean have always been cute, but still, it’s always been obvious they were meant for each other and I never once thought of being with either of them. The same applies to the Weasleys, I never really thought about being with any of them, they’re just all attractive to me. It’s the same with Pansy and Blaise. I never thought of being with either of them.”
“Well, I wouldn’t keep any record of who they are, and if anyone asked, I would say I can’t reveal my source because it would compromise my integrity as a reporter.”
“You’re absolutely insane.” Harry let out a soft laugh. He’s never owned something so nice before. After a lifetime of hand-me-downs and wrong sizes, he was suddenly gifted with luxury. “I love it. Thank you so much, Draco.”
His body might not have reacted the way he wanted to, but he really wasn't up for doing anything at the moment and Draco could read that pretty well in Harry's nonchalant attitude. So Draco went back to writing and Harry laid his head on Draco's shoulder, reading as Draco wrote.
He was very aware that it was all just a front to lock his father away for entirely unrelated crimes. But still, he got through it. He got through every interview, every court date, every testimony, and every news article. He got through it all.
He set the books on his bed and popped one open. He’s always been able to read pretty fast, so Draco was in awe to see Harry spend only a few seconds on each page. He was even more impressed when Harry started to write notes as he read, his eyes never leaving the book.
“Draco said that you played with his hair once and he hasn’t forgotten it. He’ll kill me when he finds out I told you, but he’s been wishing you’d do it again. He said it felt great.”
Harry looked up and smiled. A blush could be seen peaking out through the soot and beard on his face.
As impolite and hazardous as it was, Harry still found himself sprinting through the hospital to Draco's room. He saw the blonde was still in bed and the nurse, Kai, was checking his vitals and trying to talk to him. "Hey, Draco Malfoy? I'm Kai, I'm a nurse and I'm just checking up on you. You're in St. Mungo's right now."
“I’ve been trying to.” Harry huffed and sat down on his bed. “This is the first year I haven’t had to balance schoolwork and people trying to murder me. School’s never been easier. There’s so much less to do already. I tried to fill it with looking through my parent’s old stuff, scheming to set up our friends, and then planning for the future. But now I’m running out of things to do.”
"I'd like to think the only difference between insanity and genius is perspective." He said as he lifted his chin and brushed himself off, mocking an air of superiority.
“Bill and Fleur are having a baby.” Ron mumbled, catching everyone’s attention. “They always knew they wanted two or three kids, so they just decided to go ahead and do it. Percy and Audrey too.”
Harry's eyes widened a bit. He didn’t realize surrogates made so much money. “Wow, that’s quite a bit of money.”
Draco shifted a bit and moved one hand to play with Harry’s nipples while the other drifted down to fondle his balls.
They both addressed the house elves by name and thanked them. It made everyone feel a bit bad for having never done that.
“I want to focus on The Cupboard Project. Pawk and Pansy have been informed of my doings in Wizengamot. I’m entrusting them to pick-up where I leave-off. I listed you as a friend for them in the media. You’ll still get stories about a Wizengamot, Alex, but they won’t be from me.” He gave a sort of sad smile. “Wizengamot never made me happy. I know it isn’t meant to be a happy job but it isn’t something that can satisfy me. But caring for orphans and saving people from abuse, that’s what I want to do. That’s what makes me happy. So I’m retiring.”
Draco was hit with the same excitement that had rushed through Harry and he bit his lip. “Not anymore. Just me and you, no magic, no help, I’ll always win.” He stayed leaned back, not even bothering to try and reassert himself. Instead, he stayed low and put his lips by Harry’s ear, whispering, “Don’t think I-”
Armed with his newfound intelligence on some members of Wizengamot and the important of getting Pawk's bill passed, Harry's face turned quite serious when he entered Wizengamot. He started making conversation with people he hardly knew in order to work his way around the room, slowly making his way to the few that piqued his interest. Of the seven members of Wizengamot that Harry was unsure about, five expressed that they were definitely voting in favor of the bill. That relaxed him just enough that he decided not to go through with his threats. In face, he was thankful for it. Making threats when he was about to retire seemed exhausting.
Harry looked away and almost seemed to glare at the wall as his cheeks turned red. “You’re worse than a girl.” He mumbled.
Pansy saw this and decided to contribute to the conversation. She very visibly looked Harry up and down. “I thought about it a few times. Figured sleeping with the enemy counted as fraternizing.”
Hermione gave in and broke it all down. “There are five main love languages. Acts of service, gift giving, physical affection, quality time, and words of affirmation. Everyone responds to them differently. Sometimes people will show love with one, but prefer to receive love with another. Sometimes people like all five, sometimes only a few. It’s different for everyone. Making your bed, flowers, holding you, spending time with you, complementing you. He was experimenting to see what you responded to and what you liked best. Like with words of affirmation. I’ll bet at one point he told you that he appreciated you, told you he loves you, and complemented you at different points in the same day, yea?”
Draco’s charm extended beyond words. He had also begun wearing less and less in front of Harry. He wasn’t strutting around naked, but he was showing off what he could. He would take off his robes, loosen his tie, and unbutton the tops of his shirts in their dorm. He used the warming weather as an excuse. But even Harry, as oblivious as he can be, suspected there was more to it than the weather.
Andromeda agreed and without even thinking about it, Harry took the cup and headed towards the kitchen. “Do you mind, Andromeda?”
That smug look turned to pure pride as his hand sped up, interrupting Draco’s sentence with pleasure.
Draco quickly recognized what was happening. Harry was letting himself be pulled back in to obsessing over his work. He hoped it was something that would only last that day and that Harry might be over it tomorrow. But he was wrong.
He felt hot and was worried that he had started sweating, his mouth felt dry and he feared he might cough if he spoke too much, his smile was forced and his eyes a bit frantic. He desperately wanted everyone to just shut up and leave. His eyes flickered to the Head Warlock at every chance, waiting for the man to tell them they could leave. The words he spoke were short and curt from his fear of choking. Hesitation clouded him when he went to shake hands for his fear of his own potentially clammy palms. He was so shaken by a sound that should have made him happy. The sound of the good members of Wizengamot celebrating a justice that Harry himself had started. He got what he wanted, so why was he afraid? Why did anxiety swim in him like a shark in water, searching for blood? Why now? Why when he was suppose to be happy? The questions only made him angry.
James looked up into Harry’s eyes and saw just how deep the fear ran. He accepted it and ate the chocolate.
The blonde was on the floor with three dragons staring him down. He was momentarily afraid. The dragons crowded around him, sniffing at him as he turned his head to the side and tilted it back. He was uncomfortable, but didn’t complain.
“I love you, Draco. I really love you. I love you more than I’ve ever loved anyone. Whenever I think of the future, I always think about you because I want you there, with me, forever.” He paused a moment and bit his lip before continuing. “I know forever is a lot to ask. But, maybe if you agree to be my boyfriend, we could start from there?” He was obviously nervous.
Harry reaches to bring forward the hips above him. With Draco on his lower stomach, he reached down to play with his hardened cock. The gentle strokes made the blonde bite his lip.
When his father returned, he was as prideful as ever, as if the war never happened. He was angry with Narcissa for lying to Voldemort about Harry’s death. He, along with other Death Eaters, thought Draco a blood traitor due to the doubts and hesitance he displayed in following Voldemort. Although Draco was very grateful for the way Harry defended him in Wizengamot, it made Death Eaters dislike him even more. Lucius felt his own family had betrayed him.
Draco unbuttoned his shirt the rest of the way and then began to change into his pajamas, right in view of Harry. Usually he moved to the side and Harry would respectfully look away. But now, he saw it all and it was gorgeous. He nearly choked when he saw Draco’s dark green silk boxer-briefs.
His body shook and he let out low moans, until Draco’s fingers began to move again. He rubbed the spot directly and mercilessly.
Harry threw his head back as tremors rushed through his body. He was nearly on the edge and he loved it. He squirmed under Draco and stroked him as fast as he could, his own eyes rolling back when he heard Draco getting louder. “C-Can I move my hips now?!” Draco had never said he could and he was getting desperate.
Just after lunch, Hermione surprised Ron with the down payment for their house. Ron didn’t even question how she got the money, he just celebrated with her and they even shed a few tears. They deserved to build a home together and everyone was ecstatic for them.
Ron was ecstatic to have the book and he spent a couple hours with Harry before going off to spend the day with Hermione and their friends.
Harry finished eating before turning over and burying his face in Draco’s chest. “We’ll stay here, okay? We’re going to lay here all day and do nothing.”
He smiled and let his hand move again. "You sound so posh when you speak. Your accent, word choice, all of it. So posh." He teased.
Harry didn’t even think twice at first. He just picked up Draco’s quill and handed it to him. He didn’t register what had happened until he was met with Draco’s smirk. He blushed lightly and his lips parted, surprised by himself.
It grew into a laugh as Harry was pushed onto the bed. He took his shirt off, “Love, what’s gotten you so excited?”
scarred into his arm. He stared at it a moment and he could feel the air tense around him. He wasn't sure how they expected him to react, but of all things, he started laughing. He threw his head back and laughed away. The irony of it was all too good. It was such a stark contrast to the Dark Mark and it sat right where it used to be. It was hilarious to him. But by the same token, he was oddly proud. He was proud that they considered him a Blood Traitor because he'd rather be that then have any association with Voldemort and the Death Eaters. It was almost a new era for him. It marked a serious change in his life, just like how Harry's scar was no longer red and irritated. It turned white and taped off into something much more akin to real lightening. They still had scars, but the scars had changed and so did they. He loved everything about that.
"I like looking at your face. You ruin it when you turn around." Draco explained it as if it was so obvious that Harry should have known, but his playful smile made it feel flirty.
"They say the Auror's are on it and that they're tracking him down, but I just don't know. I don't want you leaving this house until that monster is caught!" She took a deep breath and looked down at the ground. "They've taken your father in for questioning to see if he knows anything about it. They think he could come up with a list of potential suspects, or at the least, potential targets, and I don't doubt that your name will end up pretty high on the list considering no one else has renounced their old life as much as you have. I mean it Draco, perhaps you ought to come home."
This was it. This was Draco's fantasy. Harry remembered Draco told him about it once, but now he was witnessing it for himself. Harry was a heathen that Draco wanted to break down and tame.
Harry arched his back and his head tipped back as sighs and moans escaped his mouth. It felt so good to have such a sensitive part of his body played with, but it was frustrating as it wasn't enough to push him any closer to his orgasm. He closed his eyes and his eyes rolled back behind his eyelids. Part of him wanted to give in and tremble at the hedonism he was washed in, but part of him still wanted more.
To most, the war was distant and they weren't affected in any significant ways. They didn't understand how easy it could be for it all to happen again, but this time, there wouldn't be a chosen one. There wouldn't be a scarred child knowingly thrown into an abusive home. He was gonna made damn sure of that. There would never be another Harry Potter. He was the only one. He felt no remorse for making sure the world would never need another one.
“Oh, this one is so much better than I one I showed you before! This one is about an Auror who’s hunting down an international criminal, and requires the help of a young potions master. But as he solves the case he realizes the criminal is someone close to the potions master, so he has to stay close to him and eventually, they fall in love. It’s what they call a slow burn, because the relationship takes a long time.”
Harry also found himself succumbing to nightmares again. He would wake up in tears, begging for his life, calling out for his parents, begging for friends and family that were long gone to come back, begging someone to not die on him, begging to be killed. It was a bit bothersome to the people he shared the hospital wing with, but they mostly just felt bad for him.
He knew it would hurt, he wasn’t scared of that. He was scared that he would become irreversibly attached to Draco. He didn’t like such vulnerability. But by the same token, he wanted it. He wanted to let Draco do that to him, he wanted to be attached, he wanted to be vulnerable.
"You look like you've been crying. Your face is red and your eyes are puffy. Merlin, did you cry on the way here? Did you sleep last night?"
"I won't, I promise." He said this under the assumption that the man would be caught in a few days, or perhaps a week. Really, his social life had never fluttered as much as it did now. He wrote regular letters to Seamus, met up with Pansy every week, and went to Paris to see Blaise every few days. He’d never been so happy with his social life.
He leaned over but his back arched, “Ah fuck!” He squeezed his eyes shut as his tip began to leak. He moved his hand faster while pathetic and desperate whimpers left his mouth at every exhale. He lost all semblance of shame and yearned for the sordid pleasures of flesh. With his mind gone and his body craving the end, he let everything go.
Draco glanced at the time and realized they had been there for five hours. It was time to start on dinner. But first, he wanted to know what had Harry so squeamish. He never knew Harry to be like this. Then again, he had only ever known Harry in the context of war. Romance was very different.
Harry shrugged, “Maybe you sleepwalked.” He suggested before finally coming clean, “I carried you to bed.”
“Well, you write with it. It’s like a quill but the point in finer so you can write smaller, or perhaps draw in greater detail. This one is cut like a quill so it mimics the writing style, but most pens aren’t like this.”
Of course he’d always wanted a proper ceremony, but didn’t think Harry would care too much about that stuff, so he never asked. He had felt just as silly as Harry. Even more so when he realized Harry wanted the exact same thing as him.
“I just want to make sure. But please tell me you mean that. He hasn’t hit you, shoved you around, insulted you, nothing at all?” Her face was so serious that it was almost frightening. He feared what she might do if Harry had actually been hurting him.
“Wait, I know that book! Draco’s read it!” He had no idea Draco had been quoting a novel. It made him wonder what else had actually been a quote. But by the same token, he didn’t care. Inspiration can come from anywhere and the line had been very effective.
They spoke a little while longer, changing the subject from Harry to Wizengamot. They discussed the newest laws and amendments that had just entered.
Luna knew this was about much more than his old fire and brashness. Harry had changed since the war. Despite his baking and penchant for chocolate, he was thinner, his eyes were distant and had seen far too much, he was a bit paler, and he didn't smile as much.
The blonde smiled to himself and gave a nod. “Is there a particular event that you’re anxious for?” He figured that if he could identity a specific event then he might be able to talk Harry into relaxing about it, or at the very least, it could give him a more precise date.
I've written even more Drarry fics if you're interested in reading them. I've also written Johnlock and Ineffable Husbands. I even plan on eventually entering Marvel territory. If you’re interested in any of that, subscribe to my account for more!
Draco actually laughed at the statement, but still managed to scoff as he responded, “What kind of question is that? Of course I haven't!”
Though Harry didn’t comment on it, he’s noticed the way Draco has slowly started doing more. He’s begun cleaning up little messes and washing his dishes after every meal. He thought it was nice. He really appreciated the effort that Draco put in.
“And you’re hard.” He said in reference to Draco’s boner, which was currently pressed against his thigh.
Harry turned to him and gave a weak smile. “Come here, James.” He opened his arms, but paused when he saw the book in his hands. “Oh. You read it, didn’t you?”
He was cut off by Harry very subtly adjusting his robes, knowing it was a move meant to hide a boner. “I’m not having this conversation.”
Draco turned pink and licked his lips, looking away. “Oh.” He wasn’t used to this. Usually, when a man liked him, it was either for his looks or money. Harry had money, and apparently he didn’t even know how good Draco looked until now. So what was left but Draco. Just Draco, and who he was as a person. His heart skipped a beat and he took a sip of wine to try to calm himself.
Slytherins are known for being sly, cunning, ambitious, and charming. It's really the ambition that gets students sorted into Slytherin. Their ambition truly is something else. It's strong and unrelenting, so much so that they develop a sly and cunning nature in order to get what they want. Sometimes what they want is power, other times it's world peace. Slytherin aren't bad, just willing to do whatever it takes to get what they want, regardless of consequences or repercussions. The charm of Slytherin comes with their sly and cunning nature. They learn that charming others is just as good as manipulating them.
“Titles and properties to be dissolved by Gringotts Bank.” preceded the trial of everyone with a Dark Mark. It was strange to hear it at the end of trials where the accused had children who hadn’t taken the Dark Mark, and therefore, should be given their parent's belongings. Although nobody questioned it, the occasional confused expression revealed that everyone in the room was curious about it.
When they walked into their common room, Harry raised an eyebrow. “Ah, so they’ve taken an inclusive route. Would’ve thought they’d avoid house colors all together.” The room was a mix of heavy green, faded gold, deep blue, and worn red. Somehow, all the colors actually complemented each other really well and it looked quite lovely. The house colors were also only used sparsely, just to add a pop of color amongst the room. It wasn’t a particularly bright room, but it wasn’t dark either. It was a nice balance.
Three bars of chocolate later and he still felt like shit. He took a deep breath and sat at the kitchen table, trying to understand his own emotions. He was sad, a bit angry, he was worried, and he was hurt. Part of him hoped Draco would hurry up and come back so they could make-up and move on. He was already ready to put it all behind them. He wanted to take whatever difficult conversation they would have to have and put it in the past. But he was alone.
"Blood aside, no heir can be made of this marriage and I do believe continuing your family name is quite important to you. When was the last gay marriage between purebloods, anyways? Ah yes, never.” He rose from his seat and slowly leaned across the table, inching closer to Lucius as he spoke. “Not to mention how abnormally restrictive the marital contract is; no sunset clause, forgone amendment procedures, and an infidelity clause even though there's no possibility of an illegitimate heir?" His voice had slowly dropped to a low growl and he ever-so-slightly penetrated Lucius' personal space. He stayed there for the rest of his tirade. "Any and all chance of divorce is gone, and yet you claim to want the best for your son, which I find redundant though I think we're all far past how backwards you can be, Malfoy. Everything about this marriage is unusual, yet you seem to have no problem breaking societal norms to make it happen. So what’s one more?” In that moment, Harry Potter was gone, and in his place sat a vengeful beast. A beast that hadn’t seen the light of day since he struck down Voldemort. "Potter-Malfoy, or no deal."
Harry managed to get about halfway down before he started to bob his head. He pressed his tongue to the underside and let it rub against the length in his mouth with each bob. After only a moment, his neck and jaw began to ache. He decided he needed a bit more practice. Perhaps he should do this more often.
Draco was taken aback by the conflict and defeat in Harry's eyes. He removed his hand, but leaned in just a bit closer. "Are you alright?"
“You’re so embarrassed, it’s adorable.” Draco commented rather than answering the question. He didn’t bother with an answer because they both knew what the answer would be.
Maybe he had normalized some sketchy things. Maybe not everything that happened to him was fair or just, but somehow, he didn’t quite see what the problem was. He felt as if it was already over and he wanted to move on. Or at the very least, he didn’t want to deal with the fact that it happened. He was also a bit angry since it felt like they were making some example out of his father. An example that wasn’t necessary at all. He could name five other pureblood fathers who were just like his own. Five better examples. He wanted them to just let his father go down for plotting the attacks and hiding information from Aurors. This addition seemed completely unnecessary.
Nearly the entire Great Hall turned to look at him, a few professors even busted out laughing. Everyone heard it.
Molly recognized the look and quickly locked arms with Harry, pulling him close. When Harry gave her a questioning look, she responded, “You only ever smile like that when you’re about to punch someone.”
“Oh, that’s wonderful! I’m so happy for them." He looked Harry up and down. "You’re absolutely covered in soot. It only makes your eyes brighter though.” He winked.
Narcissa realized this was the happiest she had been in years. It made her a bit sad to think she had wasted so much time on a man that didn’t love her, but she was also proud of herself for finally taking back her life. It’s never too late, and it’s better she does it now than never. No matter what happens, nothing will ever make her regret this day.
Harry started off nodding, but then he cracked a smile and shook his head. “Have you noticed that a lot of people seem to have their first and last name start with the same letter?”
He got Neville a pocket watch with six different points on it. It was meant to be held in front of a plant, and it tells you what the plant needs. The arrow would point to either more water, less water, nutrition, heat, cold, or perfection. Perfection meaning the plant was fine.
It took a moment for Harry to find the energy to pull out and roll over. Draco groped for his wand and cast a quick spell to clean himself up.
The sweet feeling on his neck made him slowly realize that by comparison, his arm felt stretched and a bit uncomfortable, so he retreated it to hold on to the bottom of Draco’s shirt. A noise that could only be described as a mewl left him as he tilted his hips up to get a more direct friction on his arousal. He found himself turning his thighs out as far as he could, making himself spread open. He’d never done that before. But he wanted it. He wanted to give Draco all the room he needed to move his hips and make them feel good. He also began to realize that his breaths had become soft panting.
James watched in horror, wishing he could take it all back. He shed a few tears of his own, knowing this was all his fault.
Before Harry could register the reason why the blonde groaned, he let out a few noises of his own, surprising himself with the short and gentle moans that left his lips. A bit of force came from his hands, trying to encourage Draco to keep his lips there. Everything felt perfect besides the way his dress pants had become a bit tight. He didn't realize something as simple as this could feel so good. Entirely new and far too sweet, he knew he could be content spending the rest of his days with Draco's mouth on him. It was a fate he'd be honored to suffer.
Draco and Harry return to their dorm from their days out, and of course, one of them just can’t keep it in his pants.
“You don’t use bloody pencils.” Although quills and ink were pretty cool for about five minutes, it was a bit inconvenient to constantly dip the quill back in ink. Sometimes you didn't get enough ink, sometimes you got too much, it was hell to keep buying, and it made writing long papers a nightmare compared to going on ceaselessly with a pencil.
Still, politics were a very dangerous game. The Ministry was like Versailles. All important members of the government were in one place, away from the rest of society, trying to balance on what remained after Voldemort and the revolution. Though some wanted Harry to be the Sun King, he wasn't stupid enough to try. Trading his power for a title was a move he considered very unwise. Why do that when he sat at the heart of it all, pulling on strings people didn't even know existed. Not to mention, the moment a leader fell out of favor, they were left headless. Harry much preferred to have his hand on the rope of the guillotine.
Harry also told Draco that the article made Crow feel bad, so she promised to get two of her stuffier friends to vote in favor of The Cupboard Project and Pawk’s bill. It was sweet of her, but he hadn’t told the whole truth. In reality, when he and Hermione saw the article, they planned for her to use it to subtly guilt-trip Crow just to see what she might try to offer to make it better. But they were both confused as to how someone knew that her and Crow had been talking. It also worried them since they didn’t know what else this person might know about them and their dealings in Wizengamot. The source was listed as anonymous but Harry planned to ask Alex about it via a letter.
As he thought about it, he realized he didn't even know Draco was gay. He had never come out, which made him wonder if Draco was even comfortable with his own sexuality, and that made him feel even worse. He had to speak to Draco, but he didn't want to barge into Malfoy Manor unannounced, so he didn't take the Floo. Instead, he hopped on his broom and took off. He had a vague idea of where the manor was, and quite frankly, it wasn't exactly a small place. He knew he'd recognize it when he saw it.
“No. He hasn't hit me.” Draco sneered, his tone dripping with venom and his muscles tensing up as he tried to keep himself in his own seat; he was getting dangerously close to punching his father in the face.
He took a moment to wonder if Harry's words had any meaning to him, or if it was all just a game to him.
In his study of the restricted section, there wasn’t really much about the dark arts. More about things to watch out for and manifestos. He understood why it was in the restricted section, some of it would be terrible influence on a young mind. But some of it, some of it was very detailed instructions on how to do awful things.
Harry was scared and he wasn’t quite sure why. He shouldn’t be, but he was. He was terrified and heartbroken. He was so concerned with what he lost that he momentarily forgot all he was about to gain.
His expression snapped into that of shock as he reread the same few lines over and over, trying to process it.
“Right.” Draco mumbled as he sat up. “Let’s go to the Great Hall the-“ He cut himself off when he saw Harry reach other to the bedside table and pull out a plate of food.
“Well, I don’t have a preference. We could settle on whatever’s cheapest, if you don’t mind?” Draco offered.
They talked about couple stuff and then Ron shifted the conversation to ask if Dean still fancied Seamus.
”And they were only rumors. Probably started by the other purebloods who couldn’t believe the only heir to the House of Malfoy isn’t interested in the gender that can produce a child. As for the ball, we went as friends, and considering that boys were taught one part of the dance and girls were taught the other, there wasn't too much room for same-sex couples. She now happens to be engaged to a woman.” Draco then turned the question around. “What about you? I never heard of you being with a man.” He's heard rumors about Harry as well. About him and Cho, Ginny, and a number of other girls. There always seemed to be some girl after his affections.
“Turns out they were quite true. I don’t know much, but I’ve noticed some things. He spaces out a lot, he apologizes all the time, even about things that don’t matter. He came home from work late and apologized for not being there to cook dinner for me. I once pointed a wooden spoon at him, and I could see it in his eyes, he was terrified for a moment.”
It was then that the Malfoys arrived. Lucius stood tall and proud, Narcissa looked as if she had been crying, and Draco refused to lift his eyes off the floor.
By morning, they couldn't find the resolve to regret their openness, and instead, silently embraced that they were a bit closer than before. That night, they had a very similar conversation, but no wine was necessary.
“You were brought up to be all prim and proper, and you enjoy it. You like being upper class, rich, posh. But you have a kink for the improper, savage animals of men. Is that what you want, then? For me to take you like that, like an animal? I’d have you like a decorated whore.”
They sprinted into Transfigurations class just on time. Harry took his seat by Hermione who greeted him with a suspicious look.
He threw his head back and bucked his hips quickly, thrusting into his own fist as fast as he could. He was helpless to pleasure. He needed it, he craved it, he had to have it. His body shook and his free hand clawed at the floor for purchase. Moans and whines tumbled out of his mouth as he panted from the growing heat.
Scorpius claimed him as his brother immediately and Teddy momentarily copied his bright green eyes before declaring that he was going to teach him French.
Harry and his friends were starting to spend almost all their free time on the couches. Studying, reading, talking, doing projects, writing papers, and working on homework. They enjoyed the time they got to spend together because they were finally realizing it wasn’t going to last forever.
Harry raised an eyebrow, “You lot seem to know quite a bit about my parents and their friends. How did you all know each other?” He figured now would be as good a time as any to pop the question.
Pansy knew they were in love with each other, but Harry didn’t know that. Really, she wanted him to explain his feelings in his own words so she would know how to proceed from there.
He also came across an article about Hermione that Harry had very angrily addressed when he got home that day. It dragged her for being friends with Crow long before the woman had turned her attitude around. Harry told him that Hermione said she didn’t mind since her name had been through much worse, but Harry was determined to get to the bottom on who had exposed their friendship to begin with. Draco hadn’t even known about it until then, and it made him curious.
Harry decided he might as well get to the point since it was already a bit weird for him, “I hope this doesn’t sound strange, but I’m studying advanced DADA so I’ve been given access to the restricted section of the library. In it, I’ve found magic about linking one’s consciousness to an inanimate object. It made me wonder how you did this. Am I talking to real people, or some sort of magic guardians of the map?”
Harry’s face rested in Draco’s shoulder and slowly, they both fell asleep like that. Harry couldn’t resist the warmth of Draco’s body, and Draco was so at ease with Harry against him.
“Yea. My mum’s a Black. One of her relatives married his great grandfather, and another married Ron’s grandfather. I’m related to the both of them.”
As much as he wanted to get passionate, he knew that wouldn’t work on her. So he changed angles. “Do you happen to have a sibling that works for The Daily Prophet?”
Draco looked over at Harry and it took all of his will not to let his jaw drop. "What the hell are you wearing?!"
Harry wasn't intentionally listening in, but he and Narcissa were extremely quiet from where they sat and focused very intently on the conversation.
Harry cracked a small smile. “I'm glad you like it. Hermione picked out most everything, if I'm honest. I really don't have an eye for color.”
It took Harry a moment to realize he was sweating and struggling to breathe. It was confusing for him, as crowds had never been a problem. He furrowed his eyebrows and frowned as he continued to make his way through, trying to figure out what the problem was. Maybe it was too loud? Too frantic? Maybe it was too similar to the hustle and bustle of the Great Hall during the war? He didn’t know what his problem was, but something was wrong. He spaced out a bit and his eyes slowly sunk to the floor as they made their way to the trees.
"As I'm certain you can all recall, I was once made head of many Death Eater houses due to old law and the nature of Voldemort's Dark Mark. Goblins don't like it when you go back completely on deals, so I was advised to keep some things. I kept what wouldn't be missed, but out of spite, I kept some of Lucius Malfoy's wine. He didn't like that. He also didn't like that Draco sabotaged himself as a Death Eater, took care of the people held hostage at Malfoy Manor, and never truly followed Voldemort. Narcissa Malfoy had also angered him by lying to Voldemort. She told him that I was dead, but I wasn't. She enabled me to eventually kill him. Anyways, he was mad at the lot of us and wanted to make us all suffer. So he dug into old law and found that as head of the House of Malfoy, he owned Draco's right to marriage as he was unwed at the time."
It was still hard for Harry to process the fact that he really did save the world. Without him, thousands of millions could be dead in Voldemort's crusade for some insane idea of blood purity in wizards. Still, Harry didn't feel like a hero. He felt like a normal person, which was a first for him, and was better than he had felt in a long time. Normalcy was the sweetest feeling he ever could have hoped for himself. Something about being dead made him realize that he hated being a hero even more than he thought. He didn't want to only be the man who saved the world. He wanted to be something more than the fact that he had to be traumatized for the sake of everyone else. There was something much more appealing in thinking that he could spend the rest of his days working on something important to him without having to tear himself apart all over again. He could do good without being harmed. He could do good while he healed. The concept was almost unknown to him and yet he was desperately trying to pursue it. It sounded like a dream and he decided weeks ago that it was one worth chasing.
“Or, I could just suck it up and be with you now.” He mumbled as he leaned forward to rest his head on the table. He found himself hardly caring about politics when compared to Draco. “Wizengamot is filled with plenty of good people now, I doubt they really need me to stick around after I get my department passed. Maybe I could just leave Wizengamot and focus on that.”
Harry gave a nod and walked out the front door. He only lived about five minutes away from Hogsmeade, so he saw no problem in walking. He also enjoyed the nature. He liked the songs of the birds and the rustling of trees.
Harry fumbled at first but soon found himself rocking his hips in-time to Draco’s bouncing. Those green eyes stared up at Draco in a silent plea for approval. He had no idea what he was doing.
They spent the night cooking, eating, and talking. The wine made conversation flow even easier. Ten minutes into it and Harry was confessing a few details of his childhood that he had never really spoken about, and Draco found himself doing the same. Four glasses in and they were like open books. They sat there until some ridiculous hour of the night and let out things they never thought they would confess to another person.
“Bastard.” Harry said as he started to drink the bowl of soup. He was very aware that Draco was taller than him, but he didn't realize he was so much taller.
With all that under his belt, he couldn't imagine he'd done something bad enough to warrant a meeting with Shacklebolt himself.
The blonde gasped with joy, “Oh, you blush everywhere!” He couldn't have been more attracted to Harry. He thought everything about him was charming in its own way.
Draco chuckled but mixed a moan into it so his lover wouldn’t be too embarrassed. “But you enjoy it.” He knew the face of a man struggling to accept what he enjoyed. “Just enjoy yourself.”
Sunbeams danced on Harry's body as he stood in the kitchen. He was dressed in a red sweater with an 'H' sewed on the front and Draco recognized it as the sweater knitted by Molly Weasley herself. It was a bit big on Harry since she never knew his measurements, but he loved it dearly. He was smiling at absolutely nothing at all. There was a happiness in the air, and whatever plagued Harry's mind last night must have resolved itself, because in Draco's eyes, nothing in the world could be wrong. Not today. Not here. Not when they were together.
He would have woken up without distress if not for the final scene. Voldemort was right in his face, smiling. It wasn’t malicious but a genuine smile. Voldemort was honestly happy. He then commented, “Oh Potter, could it be that being a Horcrux had side effects? Could it be that you, the Boy Who Lived, might be just like me? Or maybe it has nothing to do with having part of my soul in you. Perhaps you’re a perfectly bad person on your own, perhaps you’re just like me. I do love the irony of it, Potter.”
Draco looked up with an impish grin. “Oh, I plan to.” He pulled his own underwear off and cast a wandless spell that Harry was embarrassingly familiar with. He reached behind himself with lubed fingers and looked Harry in his eyes. They were typically a deep mix of blue and silver, but now, they were rain clouds in a pale blue sky. They stared into eyes like a pastel dream of some enchanted forest. They still held magic and innocence in such a fleshly scene.
He nodded, liking that answer. “Well, after you finish writing about the lawsuit, I have a story I need in the papers.” He reached into his robes and pulled out a piece of parchment. On it, Harry had written the details of Effie Crow’s secret scandal with the St. Mungo’s reforms. “Do burn this; leave no evidence.”
Draco’s jaw dropped at the animalistic noise he heard from Harry’s room. He was leaking a bit into his own boxers but didn’t plan on going anywhere until he knew Harry was done.
Draco's eyes widened in surprise, enraptured by every word, holding on. He heard everything he's ever wanted to hear. So sweet and rough, selfish and pure, it sound like an adventure. With that, he knew his heart was stolen.
Draco couldn’t quite believe what he was hearing. He couldn’t believe that Harry was so genuinely proud of his dragons, how he treated them like they were his own kids. “So, you consider them to be your children?”
They talked about how Harry was doing in school and about what he wanted to do for a career. The conversation went over to Draco when Harry mentioned that they’re roommates.
When they arrived at the shack, Harry showed Draco to his room. “I know it isn’t much, but it’s got everything you need. The dragons are slight night owls but they won’t wake you up early.” Harry was about to say something else, but Atlas began head-butting the backs of his legs. He frowned and looked at the dragon, seeming to know exactly what he wanted. “Hey, no. I’m not going to do that.” It didn’t matter that dragons can’t speak English, he still spoke to them as if they were his children. Lyra joined her brother in headbutting the back of Harry's other leg, trying to push him towards Draco.
“There are so many people who would love to be with you!” He pointed out, still in a state of disbelief by Harry’s lack of experience.
Draco grinned. “Depends on what you’d let me do to you. I suppose I’d start with that neck of yours. It seems to be a bit sensitive. I’d really like to touch places that I know, no one ever has before ..... and to kiss where you’ve only dreamed lips would be.” He watched Harry’s lower lip give a soft tremble, looking as if he had never been spoken to this way. He looked so wide-eyed and innocent. “Not so tough now, are you?”
“I know Muggles don’t have house elves, but certainly the chores are divided out in some way.” Andromeda pointed out.
Harry stared at the parchment for a moment, his emotions running numb. He swallowed, and without thinking, clarified, “Growing up, my aunt and uncle locked me in the cupboard. It was my bedroom.”
Teddy sat in year six. Years fifth through second were littered with Weasley’s, Luna’s first son, and Scorpius. Though the Weasley bunch had remained mostly Gryffindor, two Ravenclaws and a Hufflepuff came out as well. With the introduction of Luna’s second son, Lysander, and James Potter, Hogwarts was going to be overrun by the children of Harry and his friends.
Draco looked down and saw it. “You can’t tell me you don’t enjoy this, Potter. Argue all you want, but your body says something else.”
His dream started off with flashes of different faces. Some he recognized immediately as people he seriously manipulated or threatened, but others he only knew as the little people he had to bump around in order to get his way. They seemed distressed and angry. Some glimpses of a scene showed someone lashing out, losing their job, their family, seeing their life go down the drain, and though Harry’s role was that of a fly on the wall, he knew it was all his fault. Each disaster and each life ruined was all because of him. Nobody called him out or even spoke his name, but he knew it was all because of him and his meddling. His manipulation and threats caused things to fall apart.
Harry nodded and showed her the necklace. Luna took one look at Harry and saw how completely vulnerable he was. Showing the necklace was like showing an open wound. She looked at the necklace and tilted her head, “The detail on the lily is so lovely a fae might try to steal it.”
"Not yet, I'm going to send it out today. I'm also considering publishing. I'll do it under a pseudonym, of course."
Draco’s eyes rolled back and he continued to pant, but every exhale was another hungry noise. “More, please! Faster, Harry.” Harry’s hands were much rougher than what he was used to. He was used to expensive moisturizers and soft skin from his lovers. But Harry’s skin was tough from the years of work. It made everything feel so much better. He hardly felt halfway there but he was already shaking.
