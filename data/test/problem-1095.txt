It would have been cold, but Ember's body gave off an amount of heat that wasn't quite normal, yet served the purpose of warming Harry thoroughly.
sing-songed Harry proudly. But in the back of his mind, he wondered if that was true. Somehow, the words, the melody, felt like something warm and vaguely familiar.
“The What-ian flag?” laughed Wolfe and leant forward on Binky's back to squint at the tiny pieces of clothes in the wind.
Just two boys shaking hands. Seven years too late. Or maybe at just the right time, for a new start.
Something wasn't right. Draco knew it, just... just he couldn't quite catch it. Something about the journal...
Draco rolled his eyes. “Thanks a bunch. Really, great way of helping, you guys: kidnapping and psychological torture!”
“Not even to go to the loo?” Putting his arms around Draco, Harry smiled gently and dropped a kiss onto the blond hair.
Finally the real Harry cleared his throat and declared: “I will think about the sleeping spell, alright? See if there can be a better solution.”
“I think she would really love to talk to you. She is... she has lost so much in the war: husband, daughter, son-in-law... You are the only immediate family she has left in Britain – aside from Teddy, but he's just a baby.” Harry turned his head a bit to look at Malfoy's cheek. “Had you even heard your cousin had a child?”
Malfoy started having a violent coughing fit that wouldn't end and sounded terribly as if he was trying to spit out his lungs.
“Hey Harry, what did the Ferret give you for Christmas?” Ronald yelled rosy-cheeked across the table.
Harry walked down the aisle between the wooden monuments and stopped in front of the tomb. His thumb brushed the cold marble where once a crack had split it from head to foot.
“We didn't want to see you getting your hopes up only for them to be shattered,” Half took over. “And then this episode at the barn happened and you freaked and we were afraid you might do something rash. So I traded Perchta my best joke for a few leaves of forget-me from Berchthold's magical garden in Holle's Pond. That did the trick: You forgot your ambition to leave and...” he looked up, pleadingly, “you were happy, Seeker, weren't you?”
“Fine~” Pansy extended a hand towards her house-mate. “Give me some red ink, a quill and another envelope.”
They followed the arched corridor, Malfoy's steps illuminated by lots of fireplaces, all lit and set into the outer wall at given intervals. Over each of them were identical clocks on the chimney-pieces that had got the face of little old men that grinned at them. It was creepy.
“Fine,” the ginger grumbled and she heard the ruffle of the Invisibility Cloak, “want to hear my suggestion now?”
Draco didn't feel like deigning this with an answer. He and his friends had indeed fed the giant beast on one or two occasions, for fun.
Potter shot a well-aimed Reconstruction Spell at the beams and Draco a curious look. “No? I moved into Grimmauld Place.”
Taking a step back from Warrington, as if the parchment alone could hurt her, Parkinson shrieked: “You put an Irremovable Pimple Jinx on this?! I'm not signing that!”
Harry, doubling over, held his stomach, gasping out words in between new waves of giggles:  “Because, haha, I figured something out just now that
Lacie chuckled. “Because we live on treacle, silly. The Mell is a treacle well. The Upsters send it down through the fireplace.”
Not coming from zis boy!” Suddenly her eyes were blazing. “Don't you all forget: 'e is ze reason my Bill got 'urt like zis! I won't trust anything 'e says!”
The last pages of the scrapbook were still empty; the final picture showed Harry in his Quidditch uniform, an arm around Draco and in victory pose.
The game forgotten, Half and Ember disappeared somewhere to do who-knew-what which left Seeker with the task of looking after the horses. They didn't really need all that much taking care of these days, however, since there was a corner at the edge of the forest where food was provided by the moss folk to feed the whole herd of Hunt horses.
“Will you not?” Draco aimed his wand at her. It was difficult to keep balance in water while holding it like so.
Harry held out his hand. “Shall we? It's a bit into the woods and I daresay we have time for the whole story until we get there.”
Mulling this over, Harry found he’d meant it. Sure, they fought all the time and Harry had thought at least on a dozen occasions during their acquaintance that his life would be so much more peaceful without Draco Malfoy in it. But if he was honest with himself, he would miss their petty arguments and schoolboy rivalry a bit… at least in times that were not as serious as they had been of late.
Exactly. Half-breeds were disgusting. But Murcus and Aoife didn't even have any children, so why couldn't they have left them alone? Draco felt angry and didn't quite understand why.
Draco thought it somewhat endearing that Potter’s pesky temper tantrums mostly occurred when he was defending other people. Also, Draco
Obviously. Bummer that Potter never seemed to think before he spoke. That had its perks at times, but mostly not.
Death smiled faintly. “Not yet. There are still things to do. But you set me free, to go whenever I wish. I'll leave when I'm done.”
Draco grumbled quietly. He was used to being addressed by name by the teachers by now; after all, he was one of the few that showed up almost daily. Nevertheless could he have done without sarcasm on this particular day.
It was their turn. Malfoy pulled at his lower lip, eyebrows knitted. “I really made you smart... too smart.”
as well as the sound of animated conversation and laughter. It was such a happy and welcoming sound.
“What's a grass sacrifice?” asked Harry no one in particular, petting Snowdrop who was perching on his shoulder.
They made it through dessert and into the living room, played parlour games and exchanged gifts. Harry gave Draco a Muggle book named
Malfoy growled disapprovingly. The way he flashed his eyes at Harry said without a doubt 'shut up, you imbecile'.
However, the next chapter will only be out in the new year, since I'm taking a two-week Christmas break. Expect it around January 11th.
Weasley had actually brought four identical books so that they could all have a look. How thoughtful. Pansy frowned. Weird how she'd never noticed how clever the ginger was when he put his mind into it. Must be an anomaly... Hopefully tonight's heightened brain activity wouldn't leave any permanent damage (not that she cared).
“Cadair Idris,” repeated Granger and pulled him unceremoniously onto his feet. “I took one of the volumes back to The Burrow for a bit of light reading and I found this!” She shoved an open book under Draco's sleepy nose. Its pages showed a moving, coloured picture of a round pond encircled by a ring of mountains, a breeze rustling the surface of the water. “
“Oh, I don't know, maybe the fact that you laughed at the prospect of an innocent animal being murdered because of something childish
Eyeing Harry as if he was waiting for a 'gotcha', Malfoy slowly leant back in his arm-chair when the bespectacled boy's face didn't change its distressed expression. “Explain.”
had accomplished, proud of what Lupin and Tonks and the others had fought for. That basically the whole of Britain's wizarding community could be here tonight, free from suppression and fear, this was
“Say... when we first met, didn't you tell me The Hunt had picked you up only a few months before me?” he spoke to no one in particular.
Honestly, it hurt my brain to figure that out and I'm not sure I did it right and if you have a different opinion, I would love to hear your reasoning. I just went like this: Sirius said that Arthur is his second-cousin once removed and Molly his cousin by marriage, whereas Draco is  Sirius' cousin Narcissa's son. After drawing a crude family tree, fourth cousins once removed is what I came up with.
When the Golden Couple had entered the hunt for The Hunt, he had been hopeful. After all, Potter had managed to win a bloody war with these two at his side. Yet the more often Draco had to repeat the great Potter vanishing act story, the more despaired he'd become. They wouldn't be able to help him, if they couldn't remember what Draco told them. It was useless. He was just about to say as much and bid his guests farewell, when Granger suddenly nodded, as if to herself.
Draco smirked a bit at the dumbfounded expression on the ginger's face when a heavy ancient key fell into his palm. “Er, thanks?”
there. It was certainly weird without the Hunt bracelet next to it. Harry had only realised it (and Holle's crown) was missing when they had looked through Draco's scrapbook in the living room. The bracelet had disappeared with The Hunt. Maybe that was a good thing. That it wasn't here to remind anyone just how close Harry had gotten to actual dying. After all, there had only been one white knot left on it and if that had turned red as well... He shook his head. Better not to think about it... and better
The revised copy of a thick tome came sailing through the air from Headmistress McGonagall's bookcase in the farthest corner of the sitting room. Draco caught it with the ease of a former Seeker and took a nearly threatening step towards the hairnetted woman.
Malfoy sat up straight and nodded. “Yeah, this is all a mad, mad dream. I will laugh about it when I wake up.”
That's why he ventured further and further away from the castle, since everywhere couples and small groups of people had gathered on the grass, enjoying the balmy summer night.
It was only when the newly engaged duo had left Draco's kitchen that he started to wonder. Why exactly had he become involved with the Golden Couple?
“Nothing a Death Eater like you could understand,” Potter sniffed, eyes following Draco's wand as it moved to silently clean dirt and leaves off his clothes.
“You don't think he'll follow us?” Potter whispered anxiously. It was severely odd to hear his voice coming from the top of Draco's head.
Harry was strangely satisfied to see though that, with a disgusted noise, the Slytherin pushed the apparition off. Malfoy glowered. “I mean my– the real Potter. Where is he?”
“The irony,” Harry dead-panned and was pleased when that earned him a chuckle from the other boy. Good. Genuine laughter was what looked best on Malfoy after all.
“Leaves one last thing to do,” Harry wheezed, “the thing we actually came for, really. We would like to have Dreamer back.”
“God, yes.” Harry let out a long breath. “You can have all the adulation of the press for all I care.”
“Hilarious.” Draco snorted and rolled his eyes, a slight blush creeping up his neck. As if they could bait him with childish pranks like that. Princess Potter however had a fun ring to it and he would
Harry shook off a couple of raindrops. What ghastly weather it was tonight. Even with the umbrella charm Hermione had taught him, he was wet now as the sudden wind gusts had doused him with cold water from all sides. Well, what could you expect from mid-November.
In front of Seeker's eyes danced little stars of fury. It took all of his self-restraint not to hit the ginger again. He took deep, deliberate breaths, then grunted out: “Explain.”
“You don't say.” Malfoy waved his wand to both sides to illuminate the head-high pipe they'd landed in. “Obviously they were mad. They live in the Wental Mell after all.” He started towards the right, since on the left bars were glinting in the wand light, blocking the way. “And you're welcome. Wouldn't leave anyone in there – not even you.”
He was about to Disapparate when his gaze landed on the only quiet corner in the whole bustling street: Ollivanders. Of course, the wand shop had its busiest time right before the start of a new school term.
Here, he took a break and smiled at Draco who stared at him with mouth agape. “If I had to be more detailed, I would say that I like your inner strength: How you face your mistakes and try to remedy them. I saw that S.P.E.W. membership badge in the bathroom; that's not mine. I like that you're smart, smart enough to find an unfindable Wild Hunt. I like that you are a good friend. Don't think I'll ever forget Hermione siding with you.” He winked. “I like your dry humour. You're really funny when you don't aim to hurt. I like how you can be forgiving – towards me for one – even when the world is so unforgiving towards you. I like that I can be myself with you and fight with you and laugh with you and cry with you and dance with you. Draco, I was blind not to see this sooner, but I see it now, I see you as you are and – I like you. Simple as that. The fact that you saved me is only an added bonus.”
“Through here,” said Mother Weasley and gestured for Draco and her children to follow her into the living room that was crammed with a giant live fir tree (decorated with way too many blinking fairy lights for Draco's taste) and buckets of redheads dispersed on various mismatched furniture.
“In other words: a Slytherin,” Harry deduced and nodded his head. Of course Malfoy would want a bloody Slytherin as company. Figured. “Or better yet – a Slytherin me. Good job, Malfoy, really.”
He made to stand, pulling Malfoy forcibly with him as their hands were still connected by the table's strange magic.
The room had erupted in laughter and Harry had kissed a thunderstruck Draco on the neck. Bloody elf logic... and bloody elf magic counteracting Hunt magic.
the leader and he's her right hand man and which of them is riding in a  wagon if any at all? Moreover, does he hunt her or is she part of The Hunt? And what's with the story where houses built on old roads get trampled but people are safe as long as they stand exactly in the middle of the street? Also, The Hunt brings doom but sometimes it's a good omen? Same as that leader being described as a demon, yet protector of the poor? This all doesn't make sense!”
“Let's say Ron tells you tonight he loves biscuits baked by his mother” (Ron gave a indignant little squeak of disapproval which made Parkinson snicker meanly.) “and he feels that this is a secret, then the jinx holds you to secrecy. Should you tell anyone outside of this circle – that is us four and Ron's mother in this example, since the secret affects her, too – about the biscuit loving, you'll regret it. Unless of course, Ron allows you to disclose it. Got it?”
“Headmistress,” he nearly screamed, making everyone flinch. “Did you by any chance bring some biscuits?”
Greg had been released from St. Mungo's and the whole Slytherin gang had gone to congratulate him and celebrate his sobriety.
At least, Harry smirked inwardly, he wasn't alone in this misery: Malfoy was still on hands and knees, scrambling for balance, as his feet were likewise captured by the jinxed step. His face, hanging downwards, slowly but surely took on a very nice tomato colouring. Served him right for chasing Harry through the castle for five measly minutes over curfew.
Harry's never thought he'd be a chess figure once in his life, let alone twice. This was all too much a déjà vu of the occurrences in first year.
The request came as a surprise. Draco's eyebrows lifted themselves without his permission. “But you said it's better I don't mention Potter all the time. For your memory.”
And on the next page was... Draco grinned. Oh yeah, August had been fun. The first time Harry had officially joined a Slytherin get-together – just Harry surrounded by Draco's school friends.
“What if we can prove it? Look at your wrist.” Half had got up too and was tentatively reaching for Harry's arm. “Here, let me show you.”
He felt way too hot. Time to change the topic. “You were saying second floor, yes?” With that he briskly walked ahead up the stairs with a still broadly smiling Granger trailing behind him.
looking at you,” Seeker said quietly, taking in the other's profile. “Draco.” The name was still foreign on his lips.
All traces of Potter seemed to have been eradicated which meant looking for guidance in books was out of the question, at least where The Boy Who Lived was concerned.
, but I figured it out eventually and when you're asking me now, what I like about you, the answer is: everything.”
But wait... clank... soft... Think, Harry, think. “Malfoy,” he grunted, barely audible over the curses Malfoy was throwing at Queen Harry by now, “Malfoy,
“He's quite attached to your daughter, Mr. Dreamer's Dad,” explained Half with a worried expression. “He's been looking out for her ever since she came to us.”
Harry had about a dozen comebacks to this but he never got to say even one because in that very moment, Malfoy had finally found enough leverage to push himself upright, one hand on the handrail, the other bracing him against the wall. Unfortunately though, the instant the blond boy's body was vertical, he started sinking rapidly and with a yelp and some rather funny waving about his hands, Malfoy was once again face down, ass up.
Harry was brave or at least he felt brave today, but flying in a storm was insane. However, when he looked around in panic for a way out of the centre of the tempest, he found that none of the others seemed even the tiniest bit alarmed. In fact, they were still just as relaxed as they had been moments before, when the sky had been cold but friendly.
Death exchanged a look with Holle on his shoulder. “You're taking that well. Seems like you were able to heal. That is good. You've matured a lot.”
“I don't like you!” Oh snap, did Draco just give it away? There hadn't even been talk about 'liking' yet. Stupid, Draco, so stupid!
Harry nodded. “So, what you're saying is that I got abducted by this ghost procession. And you  really are dead, ghosts. Even most of the animals.” Agreement all around. “But, if you are dead and I'm alive then how can you know me?”
Death shifted. “To be quite truthful that was a fluke on my part. My visions are sometimes a bit vague or blurry and don’t come with a timestamp. The one I'd really wanted to make aware was
Harry gave up, throwing his hands with the reins up in defeat which caused Lightning to huff disapprovingly. These guys made absolutely no sense and this was giving him headaches. One thing, however, seemed to be essential here: that The Hunt had a higher purpose than he had thought at first and that catching The Beginning would be very, very bad (or good?) and very, very far in the future.
Ron sheepishly played with the hems of his maroon velvet dress robe. “I just thought, for old times' sake, you know?” He grinned at Harry lopsidedly.
Unexpectedly, it was Draco who made the first move, pulling Harry closer by his jumper. He kissed him tentatively, almost in a shy way; the brush of his lips an unspoken question. Well, Harry had a lot of answers. He wound his arms around Draco's invisible back and kissed him the way he deserved – breathless, scorching, igniting fireworks.
Several feet from the ground the rider jumped off his horse, which turned tail and followed the  cortège.
“That you should have,” agreed Draco. His gaze grew soft as it wandered back to Potter. Merlin, Draco could spend the rest of his life simply looking at this heinous hairdo.
“I can't,” Draco croaked, backing away from the handle. “You'll have to do this on your own after all. I – I don't fly anymore.” He curled his hands into fists. He hadn't wanted it to sound so pathetic.
All that whilst animals, ranging from dogs and cats over goats, lizards, chickens, snakes, polecats, cows, toads, chamoises to bears (nobody seemed to mind but Harry carefully avoided
For a hot second there he thought about explaining the Hunt thing to Thomas, but then he abandoned that idea. A boy he had wronged badly was asking for his help. Draco would find that woman and thusly clear a fraction of his debts.
that he had been at Hogwarts... When Draco would finally get Potter back from The Hunt, Draco would forbid him to
Goodness. Out of all her sly and sharp-tongued house-mates she had to end up having a walk about with the most kind-hearted fool wearing the green and silver. Sometimes Cassius was such a Hufflepuff, truly.
“Exactly my point! This isn't normal!” Draco tried his best to disguise his embarrassment as indignation. “We are Potter,” he pointed at the other boy, “and Malfoy.” He pointed at himself. “
The kiss was just as inflaming as the earlier ones, but gentler, soothing somehow. And when Harry pressed one hand in the small of Draco's back to pull him closer, it was as if he said
On the fourth day, Granger had stormed in unannounced and had emptied a bucket of ice water over his head, proceeding with giving him a piece of her mind that had his ears ringing. Weasley had been standing by, snickering silently until the girl had turned to scold him too, for being insensible. Which really had lifted Draco's mood more than the preceding telling-off.
Ember grinned. “Just as well as I looked after Dreamer.” He nodded at the horse. “I'll call him Invincible though.”
I'm sure there were many and also much more people in Draco's group, I just didn't want to fill in more names. But they were there (really, whomever you wish to have been there).
. Draco responded in kind, winding his arms around Harry's neck, anchoring him in the moment. They kissed slowly; they had all the time in the world. Harry lost himself in the intimacy of being held this way. Being wanted had been nice, but being cherished was oh, so much better.
The whole day he had been fixing things at Hogwarts, trying to escape his self-imposed loneliness that he had procured by turning down his parents' invitation to  join them in France as well as his friends' proposal for a Christmas get-together. He just felt unable to be festive when the memories of last year's winter holidays in a house full of cold-blooded sadists were still too fresh.
The moss person must have known it somehow. Figured, after all, they saw things from Holle's perspective.
Malfoy chortled before he caught himself and fake-coughed instead. Then he suddenly stopped walking. “I'm sorry about Diggory, you know?” he said quietly. Remembering last year's pre-ball etiquette practice must have triggered a memory of the late Hogwarts champion.
“Pipes!” Weasley groaned. “Again with the pipes! First Slytherin's chamber, now Hufflepuff's Tea Room. What's the deal with pipes, really?”
“Un! Believable!” Half pried the invite from Seeker's hands and stared at with eyes huge as his sense of humour. “Being asked to attend the moss folk celebrations is like the highest possible honour. Wow mate, they must really like you.”
It was bad enough he had entertained the idea for a second in the tea room, what with the preceding lap sitting and hand holding and all that. Yeah, look at where that got him: A crazy Perv-Potter and the real Potter uncomfortably suspicious.
The door opened before they reached it and revealed to Draco's surprise one square-built, angry-faced Millicent Bulstrode, wand at the ready.
Yet… during the final duel at The Battle of Hogwarts, hadn’t Potter and the Dark Lord talked about love basically being a cure-all? Draco had not been able to hear the complete conversation as he had stood way back in the crowd, but there
Granger unfolded the letter and the owls settled on the well-opening to receive some praise and Owl Treats from Cassius.
“Look, do you want our help or not?” The ginger had stopped his impatient shifting and crossed his arms before his chest. “It's not like we have nothing better to do.”
“Hush, chérie. That is old news.” Her husband (Draco was vaguely remembering having heard of the union) leant closer towards her and placed a gentle kiss on her temple, a lone earring catching the glow of the fireplace for a second, lighting up his scarred face. Draco had to look away. “Besides, didn't you say I look even more handsome like this?” There was snickering and the air in the room relaxed with people letting go of the sudden tenseness.
“I was surprised they put him here. No, actually, I was surprised they included him in the Fallen Fifty, with what he did as his last deed,” Malfoy said quietly.
He poured himself another cup of tea while Howard jumped onto Draco's lap, demanding a petting session.
“And?” Draco had inquired nervously instead of a greeting. He'd been formerly pacing the floor around the kitchen table with a cup of cold tea clutched in his hands.
He leant his shoulder ever so slightly into the other boy who stiffened for a second but then relaxed, letting it happen.
“Yes, the dog,” Harry reassured. “May I introduce to you: Scoffer, Dreamer's – Anne's – uncle. He was turned into this shape for insulting The Hunt. But I think he has learned his lesson, hasn't he?”
Draco had no time to protest this treatment as Potter was already back on him, straddling his lap and kissing Draco as if he were the answer to all of Potter's prayers. Draco whimpered when Potter's right hand found his left wrist, pinning it down on the pillow, while Potter's left hand slipped under the borrowed Gryffindor shirt and made Draco shiver in anticipation.
Now, shortly before midnight, Hogwarts' Entrance Hall lay silent and deserted. There was no sound but the drip-drop of water from Harry's drenched clothes and the quiet snoring of his portrait on the wall.
The Great Hall was buzzing like a bee hive and Harry was just starting to feel a bit more relaxed when they announced a big reveal and asked everyone to assemble in the Entrance Hall.
“Seriously?” Malfoy groaned, but dutifully crouched onto the toy horse. He shot Harry the nastiest glare. “The things I do for you. You better be
“Yes,” replied Hermione coolly, twirling a strand of hair around her fingers, “that is a good idea.”
“We should just find you a partner as well, jester. How about that girl over there or that guy in the hat?” Wolfe pointed.
“Gee, thank you for the nice reaction, Ferret,” said the Weasel and sat down next to Draco, leaning into his personal space to have a peek at the card. “But they did turn out beautifully, didn't they?”
Harry shivered and it wasn't because of the cold seeping into his body from the snow-covered ground. There was something about this... being... something that touched his innermost core in a way he couldn't describe. Only that he knew without asking that she was oh so powerful and old, no ancient, and that he better not anger her. Yet there was also a confusing softness to her that made him feel something akin to hope. She felt like winter and spring – and she was still looking at him.
“Then, pray do explain to me: Why is it that all the weird stuff always happens to you, Potter? Tell me! There must be a reason. Have you checked your horoscope?”
“You've really changed.” Longbottom, who had been off to the loo, sat down next to Draco. “The patching, playing Quidditch together, helping to find missing people, giving presents, advocating house-elf rights and now even Mrs. Norris likes you.”
When they touched down to earth, the usual storm cloud of snowflakes and laughter enveloped them as the other members of The Hunt unmounted. People and animals alike scattered to huddle in groups on the hilltop they had landed on. A variety of noises in addition to chatter filled the air as they made ready to set up camp for the night, business as usual.
“Not quite, but along those lines, yes. We will have to entrust you with some secrets in order to give you the full story, but we can't risk you running to Umbridge with them first thing when we're done. So, that's a precaution.”
“No, you're just in time. You'll be a captor today.” Seeker raised his voice: “Now, everyone, gather round! We got this. Let's win us a piece of forest. See you at the Pond when it's over!”
But as Draco says in The Cursed Child, they were never real close friends and I thought that Crabbe deserved to feel what it's like to have close friends. That is why he only slowly changes after being fully accepted into the group (something that only happens with Harry's appearance) and that why it's always him who points out the togetherness of the gang.
Harry and Draco were in lead. Beside them, making scarcely a sound, walked Half, Wolfe, BraveHeart and Ember, flanked by the horses, and their presence was Harry's courage.
“We'll wait in the Atrium for you, darling,” said Narcissa Malfoy crisply and pulled her bewildered husband away with her. “Thank you again, Mr. Potter!” she called over her shoulder.
“Yes, sign.” Hermione offered the other girl the quill and when she didn't take it immediately, swang her arm at Warrington instead. “Wherever you like; as long as it's on the paper.”
Draco's death grip relaxed. “Concluding you say that Harry is essentially immortal and can go to the next plane without problems, once he's turned 950+. Did I get that right?”
He sat upright, anger flaring up. “She is nice, okay? Like, really nice! And you, what? Can't even bother to say hello, just because you–”
But then he shook his head. No, Potter didn't get to have any snacks either. And if their roles were reversed, Draco just knew that Potter would be already shouting it from the rooftops that Malfoy had vanished. Because that's who the Scarhead was, someone who would put others' needs before his own. Which was exactly the reason Draco had to bring the idiot back: so Draco could make fun of Potter's stupid selflessness.
Potter had also been present the first time Draco had got a fitting here, right before his first year in Hogwarts had started. Oh, he'd been so excited back then (and so pompous, haha).
It was one early afternoon in June as Seeker was absent-mindedly playing with the D-handkerchief. He had taken to wearing it on his wrist next to his Hunt bracelet, of which half of the knots were white and half red by now.
“To my friends.” Draco and Potter exchanged a look. Something unseen, unsaid was passing between them. Yes, this topic they needed to talk about. Maybe not tonight though. After all, their favourite ginger was momentarily very happy to have his best friend back and didn't need a damper by hearing about his dead brother riding with The Hunt.
Draco pushed him off. It was alarmingly easy. “Now, you listen here, you big oaf! Do you really think it was that simple for me? My family was acquitted because Potter spoke up for us and no other reason. Just because he has a soft spot for lost causes or something. The point is: He was right all along! Blood status doesn't matter. What's important is how you live your life and
Amused, the corner of Harry's mouth twisted upwards. “There's that secret motto of The Hunt again: Never give a clear answer if you can be all mysterious.” He shrugged. “Fine, be that way. Just tell me if I'm right on this one: Yes or no – Holle made the Deathly Hallows.”
“Attention, we need another hand here. Who's up for roofing?” Madam Hooch's magically enforced voice caused several interested heads turning their way. Yet as soon as they saw who they would be partnered with, the free patch workers quickly resumed their loud chatter and all so they wouldn't have to work with Draco.
Harry Potter and I'm a social outcast who hopes to gain back favour with the public by being with you?”
Harry pointed at the cross, “is definitely not your fault, Malfoy. He made his own decisions. No, don't interrupt me now. He was a dumb little shit and I know, he was your friend, but he was his own person and he died because of what
He glanced Malfoy's way. Finding him here was a bit unexpected and Harry really didn't know what to make of it.
“From then on, we met every sundown. She told me about her life, I told her about mine. She revealed how she'd noticed me in the waves, how she had started hoping I'd come back.”
Harry's brows furrowed and he was about to ask how Malfoy could possibly know that, when Lacie continued, as if as an afterthought: “Of course, they've also sent
Suddenly, BraveHeart/Colin's laughing face popped up before Harry's inner eye and he heard the tiny boy state with a voice of confidence:
“Wuzzat?” For a moment, he was disorientated by the strange environment, even threatened by the looming mass of bushy hair.
Draco jumped at the opportunity. “Professor! Good that you're here. Potter is in trouble!” He held his breath.
“I,” Draco rasped and licked his lips, “I would like that, ahem, Quidditch – and the truce, yeah.” Wow, great speech, Draco.
To the amusement of everyone but Draco, Millicent even asked suggestively: “So that Plague is keeping you busy at night, eh? Will we get to meet him once you've found him?”
to stay and listen to each other? She nodded to herself. Right and if she threw in a nice little feel-good charm this would totally go smoothly. Oh and maybe in a room they all wouldn't be disturbed?
When they landed at Goyle Grounds, Draco felt a pinch. How many times had he been over to play? Yet, he hadn't set foot here for an eternity now. It was surreal.
“You're only one person,” Malfoy said again, but this time his voice was gentle. Then he coughed awkwardly and turned away, averting his eyes.
“Okay, okay, but before you go, let's all have a cup of tea together, shall we? After all, today was The Last Ride of the year
“Can you turn it down a notch?” Draco hissed between gritted teeth. Slowly this was getting on his nerves.
you call your cat Howard?" Andromeda had come in, bearing a tray with two cups of steaming tea and an overloaded plate with self-made biscuits.
She and Ron high-fived. Those self-loving bastards would not put themselves in possible harm's way just to–
“Good, then I'll send Ron a Patronus to meet us here later. Kreacher, let's go.” With that she took an unwilling Kreacher's hand and Disapparated with a loud crack.
Malfoy chuckled, that prick. “I can't believe that after five years of breaking school rules and running around places you have no business to be in, you of all people have never heard of the Wental Mell.”
“Mhm,” hummed his interlocutor. “Much depends on the wand itself. The wand chooses the wizard after all. And it seems that this wand here chose to serve you fully once again after... Piggy... renounced his ownership.” Draco was very confused and very sceptical. It must've shown on his face. “You don't believe me? Well, have you noticed any difference in the performance of your spells after you got your wand back?” Draco slowly shook his head. “See? There you go.”
She waved her hand at him dismissively. “Okay, okay, but I guess it won't hurt to look into it, wouldn't you agree, Malfoy? We can start with what we already know about Thestrals and Grims and work from there. Yeah? Oh, what now?”
Draco felt sorry for him, he did, but he also needed answers. “Now, how do you spell O-od- that word you just said?”
, were you? Your heart was with someone else.” Her eyes found his. “Draco, you must be aware that I've loved you since forever. You know that, don't you?”
“Well, it wasn't so dark then, was it?” Potter harrumphed, cutting into Draco's thoughts. “But if this really is the lake then this is our way out – or better
“And no,” Death continued as if there had been no interruption, “when he eventually dies, as master of me, he will still have the choice to refuse or accept.”
In the last rays of the day, the dust inside the old barn sparkled like tiny stars as they rushed past stacks of hay and a dirt-stained farm tractor.
Draco's fingers drilled holes into Harry's upper arm and Harry suddenly wondered if Draco could even see anything at all. Must be horrifying to have this kind of conversation in absolute darkness. Soothingly, Harry put a hand over Draco's invisible one and cast a nonverbal
gives him power over you and makes him your master.” Harry hesitated, then added bitterly: “But maybe you don't have an issue with that.”
Harry/Seeker: Time is a valuable thing...watch the count down to the end of the day; the clock ticks life away.
. Okay, so the door chime was carolling. Draco would have thought it cute, if it didn't slaughter the song the way it did: Every two seconds, the door was opened, resulting in another rapid-fired line.
Draco felt heat creeping up his collar. “It's not like that. I just owe him, is all. He saved my life during the war. Yours, too, I'd wager. Lots of times, probably.”
“It's beautiful, B, thank you.” Seeker put the mask on. It fit well. “I didn't realise you could paint like this. I guess I just assumed your own mask was painted by... someone else.”
“Yeah, yeah, the mighty Scarhead doesn't have time for us mortals.” It could have been a snipe, but Malfoy smiled. “Just follow my lead then. Should be easier between the two of us.”
“We've stayed long enough,” elaborated Wolfe. “It's time to make new experiences. When would be better than now, leaving with our friends? The horses will come, too. They made that clear.” Some affirmative neighing was heard from Lightning/Invincible.
Real life kept throwing me curve balls (see below) and then there were holidays and somehow this whole chapter turned longer... and longer... and longer -.-
Shifting his baggage to the other hand, Draco pondered. Over the months, his memories about Potter had dwindled to a miniscule remnant and lately Draco hadn't even been able to clearly recall the other boy's face other than green eyes.
Mabel laughed at their exchange as Draco harrumphed and eyed his lobster instead of answering. Like he wanted to
“Well, he wins them a lot of Capture The Flag games, doesn't he?” Ember threw in, leaning over Half's shoulder. “Tonight's a bit spontaneous though, no? I have nothing to wear.”
He had agreed to Harry's birthday present for George, after long hours of arguments; but Draco'd been sitting at home, biting his nails while Harry had been gone, giving the gift – after the party. Worst part had been that Draco hadn't been able to, for example, pop over to Ron and Hermione's place and let himself be distracted by a moo-vee. Harry's (really
Somehow, looking for Potter, doing research about The Wild Hunt and all things attached to that had taken over his life in a bizarre way.
got their memories back and they're probably swarming The Burrow where they'll suspect me to be. I don't fancy an exclusive with Rita right now, so let's go to Grimmauld Place, the four of us.”
Harry sighed deeply. “I know that I like him alright as a person. He's really not such a git anymore and I do enjoy spending time with him. But lately I've been wondering if there is more to it? Do I like him or do I
crazy. That's why it was smartest to appease those three before they did who-knows-what. Don't think for a minute I'd normally crouch before such beings. But I'd rather not end up disembowelled and bet neither do you.”
Up and away went The Wild Hunt and the second to last knot on Seeker's bracelet turned red. He was too busy looking out for The Beginning to notice, though.
“Fascinating,” drawled Draco and pretended to yawn. Secretly, he really thought it fascinating though, all of this.
first during patching, he had not believed his eyes and had hastily departed from the grounds. However, as the fiend had decided to shadow him whenever possible, Draco had gotten used to it somehow. He had even (begrudgingly) tried to apologize, repeatedly so, but the hippogriff just wouldn't leave him alone. Although it should be a win for Draco that he hadn't been attacked again either.
The list went on and on. Everything and anything Draco could recall about Potter and his life landed on the expensive, handmade paper of the journal. If there were no books about the Chosen One anymore, someone just had to write one (maybe, once he got Potter back, Draco could sell it to the
are also echoes of sorts, but like memories or more precisely, the ghost form of the way the owner of the Stone wishes the memories to be. To put it differently: They appear as the wisher wants them to appear, albeit invisible to others. I wonder if they could even be called afterimages at all, since they are copies of ideal images rather than real people and–”
“Yes and no. Huginn-Muninn's time spearheading The Hunt is long, mine is short. I rule during Yuletide, she reigns the rest of the year. It's always been that way – it represents the life and death ratio of a lifetime. Only, people made
Walking to the nearest fireplace, a song popped unbidden into his head. Being reminded of the window had prompted it. Draco slightly shook his head. What had he been thinking singing love songs to himself in the middle of the night?
Next he had sat down in a still intact room in the otherwise heavily destroyed Hogwarts, full of former schoolmates who mostly hated him, to take his N.E.W.T.s. The school had announced that despite everything, any of the seventh years who wanted to sit the exam should be allowed to. Naturally, everyone had come. Thus the tests had been ridiculously easy in consideration of half of the test takers' inability to partake in classes during the past year. Draco had passed all subjects with flying colours. Obviously.
But unfortunately, I already know that the next chapter won't make the deadline either. So I'm aiming at August 4th for now. Apologies. (Sorry!! ... Did I say? Sorry!)
Harry shuddered. He'd been close to death so many times, but this occasion was different: He wouldn't have
“Making tea. Mum always says it's best to talk about calamities over a cup of hot tea. Makes it all better. Now how do you do this?” The redhead fiddled with the oh-when.
Feeling his heart pound faster, Harry thought how lucky he was, how very, very lucky. Since, although it had been unnerving to argue about it, having Draco being so protective, gave Harry the still somewhat unfamiliar notion of 'home', of being cared for. Draco wouldn't toy with him, wouldn't hurt him – and it made Harry weak in the knees recalling how Draco had said they were 'dating'.
Harry thought it was pretty Gryffindor of Malfoy to jump into an unknown dark hole without knowing what was on the other side. But given the circumstances...
However, the new angle made it impossible for him to kneel: Before he had been able to bend his feet at the ankles, but now, stuck up to half his calves, Malfoy could no longer do that. Therefore he was now precariously balancing his whole weight on his fingertips, cursing under his breath as he dug his shins into the stairs for purchase.
Turned out she had traded some travelling merchants on boats her spinning wheel, as a matter of prudence. I've never been prouder.”
Although, of late it was nearly impossible to get the two guys to sit down at one table. They always went off like fireworks.
“We won't. Cross my heart,” Wolfe promised and the others nodded, following her in motioning a crossing gesture over their chests. Snowdrop hooted and Scoffer gave a weak woof. “We will miss you of course, when you go, but we want the best for you, truly.”
That sounded like a whole lot of strangeness to Pansy, but Granger nodded, her gaze fiery. “I see. Of course you're afraid. Sorry for upsetting you, Dobby. What a terrible place though! That is once again this outdated thinking that house-elves don't deserve proper treatment and–”
“I will! Oh, thank you so much!” The relief and hope that flooded Draco made him temporarily forget that he was talking to an incorporeal being and he tried to shake his interlocutor's hand. “Ah, sorry! I just– This is marvellous! Thank you Nick, I mean, Sir Nicholas, I mean–
, so perfect and he had been unable to stop. As if he'd never wanted to let go of Draco again, now that he had finally found him. In that moment, suddenly, it all had made sense somehow.
“No... idea. Never... seen... before.” The new yoga master swallowed noisily, then fell silent again.
, when the other continued: “When I came to The Hunt, after I had died, I knew that part of me was still alive somewhere. I might look whole, but I just
“No, you're not dead,” Half shot Ember a warning look. “It just doesn't happen so often these days that The Hunt picks up witnesses. My bad. But hey, I'm only Half, dead.”
“Mabel,” Potter continued after a moment, when nobody had answered him, “isn't Méala a word with bad meaning? I think I heard my friend Seamus curse it once when he'd lost a game of Exploding Snap.”
Grinning from ear to ear, Harry ran a thumb over his lower lip. The tingling sensation was still there.
Draco opened his mouth. This would be a long night. He had had an inkling before, but now it seemed certain that people forgot about Potter almost the second they heard about him. Furthermore, they had trouble keeping the thread of a conversation about The Wild Hunt.
“Put that away.” Ember's voice was low and surprisingly soft. He pushed Harry's robes shut with one big hand.
He had only made it three steps down the corridor though when Potter's hand slipped under his elbow and manoeuvred him through the closest door into the very waiting room Draco had met his parents again after not having had seen them in weeks. The feelings of happiness about the reunion and trepidation on the prospect of maybe never seeing them again after today still hung in the air like invisible smoke and made Draco suddenly claustrophobic.
“Mhm,” Draco hummed, pleased with himself, and inspected the perfect fit. “But you better take that off before we visit my parents tomorrow. That is, if we want a mostly scene-free brunch.”
Draco was absolutely not 'clear', but he figured he'd had enough dance lessons in his life to nail this, swimmingly.
Turning the wand over in his hand, Mr. Ollivander hummed quietly to himself. “You say that this... Persia... willingly gave back your former wand to you because he said he would no longer require its allegiance?”
(I tried my best with these words/names, but if you are more knowledgeable than me in that area and find a mistake, please let me know. Thank you!)
Harry was about to change his course when a big index finger pressed against his forehead, keeping him in place. “Ah-ah-ah~ Not so fast. It's too late to correct it. When you've once said a thing, that fixes it, and you must take the consequences, Draco.” Queen Harry grinned like a lunatic. “It's H-3, which means... Red Queen to H-3: Off with his head!”
Only with the pooled forces of shocked Wolfe, BraveHeart and Ember did they manage to pull Seeker off Half.
The nun was a good storyteller. Seeker found himself swooning over the sad love story of Vega and Altair, the tragically separated lovers, and he was just about to name them his favourite, when the woman pointed at another group of stars: “And this is Draco, the dragon constellation. It...”
Potter's grip on Draco's hair tightened and wasn't it just cute that tiny Potty was so very reliant on Draco?
“Frigg is driving out to bless the harvest. It's about time too, after all it's already the end of July.” Wolfe dusted off her dress from powdery snow and turned around. “Ember, should we have Dreamer blessed as Frigg goes by?”
Harry groaned – because of the wording and because of the fact that Tillie's grip had tightened painfully. “I'm no one's dolly! Put me down!”
Harry hadn't planned on coming here this morning, but maybe seeing the DA at breakfast had subconsciously led him to the memorial site: Fifty white wood crosses in five lines were arranged in a half-circle around a lone white marble tomb, the only real sepulchre with a body inside.
Everyone was gathering now: Wolfe and Half, Ember and Dreamer, Snowdrop and Scoffer, even the horses – Lightning and Gee and Binky and Grapes. All of them, humans and animals, ghosts and whatnots.
Wham! Pain exploded in her forehead and she pressed both hands to where she'd bumped into Ron. “Bloody hell!”
“I thought you don't believe in Grims!” squawked Weasley and waved about with his hands. “What about all that Trelawney-bashing in third year?”
“What... did you just... say?” Harry faced him with an incredulous expression and Draco could feel his own heartbeat in his throat. If this went south, he wouldn't know how to handle it.
Potter had a quiet laughing fit, shaking all of them, as they were each touching him with some part of their bodies. “It's just hilarious, because, haha, I got you, I got you a Remembrall!”
. I'm modelled after your image after all. Also, I know you pretty well and you wouldn't have woken me up for no reason, so spit it out already.”
But he'd soon had other things on his mind and February had come with sleet and hot cocoa in front of the fireplace.
He frowned. Sure, he wasn't the best swimmer, but did he really mess up directions and swam into a castle wall instead of upwards? A few air bubbles floated by lazily. No, they went up, so Draco had it right, which meant... “This is a ceiling of a kind. Maybe we're not in the lake after all but in some sort of underwater chamber?”
Weasley had propped himself up on his elbows and was watching Draco with rapt attention now. “So Piggledy fought in the war?”
Hermione huffed. “Oh, for Merlin's sake, I'll do it first then, shall I?” With a flourish, she put her name in one corner. “Ron?”
“Hypothetically,” Draco said, his voice had a tone Harry had never heard before and which gave him goosebumps, “if Harry had... died... riding with The Hunt – what would have happened to him who is master of Death?”
Meanwhile, Granger had been staring concentrated into space, her fingers kneading her lower lip. Now, she blinked and came back to reality. “I can't remember the exact wording, but I certainly read about it before.”
“Pigwidgeon. My sister picked it,” Weasley explained irritably. “Anyway – Pig, I want you to bring this to Bill and get his answer right away. It's really important, do you hear me? Hermione will enchant you a bit to help you along the way.”
“You know,” Holle cawed and fluttered from Death's shoulder, landing as her usual white-clad human self (Draco gaped), “I was going to stay out of it, since our youngster here called for you and not me, but since we're at the topic of curses and such,” she put her hands on her hips and gave Harry a stern look, “temporarily, I was rather hoping you'd break his.” She jabbed a thumb at Death standing behind her like a mountain.
He opened the door before Draco could stop him. “Er, Potter, there's something–” Draco didn't get to finish the sentence as he was a) accidentally knocked into a preceding Potter by the arriving Golden Couple and b) stunned speechless by the way the entrance hall currently looked: on the formerly empty left-hand wall next to the kitchen entry flaunted now a beautifully painted phoenix, not quite moving, but with tiny sparks continuously falling off the underwing. There were also what appeared to be fine golden chains woven around the picture.  Those were actually three words, repeated a thousand times in golden ink:
“Yes, yes,” she allowed, then, apparently changing her mind, she stepped in front of Harry and raised herself on tiptoes. She kissed him on the forehead. “Godspeed, darling of fortune.” She smiled and did the same to Draco. “Now, go. I see a good life ahead of you.”
Harry was on the verge of zoning out, when Malfoy started humming. It was a gentle melody that made Harry feel at ease. After a while words were added here and there, quietly, in a language, Harry was almost certain, was French.
It had taken them some time to march back through the Forbidden Forest and to the gates of Hogwarts, so they could Apparate back to Grimmauld Place. There, Draco had presented Harry with an all-time-ready Portkey to baby Dreamer's father's farmhouse. Apparently, the former Slytherin had visited the grieving widower quite a lot to give him hope by telling him his progress. (Draco also had a vast collection of other Portkeys to various international locations, Harry marvelled.)
“Thanks, mate! This is huge!” Draco was hugged some more. “You have to come to lunch tomorrow, yeah? To get your presents. You
But no matter how colourful Malfoy swore (after firing several Drying, Warming and Cleaning Spells at the both of them), it couldn't wipe off Cedric's image, greenish-pale but rosy-cheeked, back in the lake, carrying Cho to safety. If only someone had got him to safety in time...
There were greetings all around as Harry looked at each in turn: Mr. Weasley (smiling warmly), Percy (looking stiff and all-important), Charlie (with a dragon-tooth-necklace), Bill (still scarred) and Fleur (still beautiful). And while they seemed like always, there was a thin layer of sadness enveloping the whole family – Fred's missing presence an unmentioned hole in their midst.
“Well~,” Death drawled, shifting from foot to foot, “we hoped you would find your will to live again
“Sure,” Harry shrugged. “But you do know I can come up with equally fun names for you, right Dame Draco?”
“He really does, B.” Harry beamed with pride. “Inadvertently, he even helped defeat these bad people you told me about, those that scared you? You were right, they did exist. Not anymore though, so you no longer have to hide. Give me your mask.”
Death mounted Sleipnir and turned in the saddle to look down at Harry and Draco: “One last thing. Remember the story of this one,” he jabbed his finger at the bird, “stealing children and how they come back different?” Draco shook his head, but Harry knew what Death meant. “Now that she 'stole' you, Harry, you came back as a...”
“Yes, sorry, but – kitchens!” Granger beamed at them in turn, yet got impatient really quickly when she was only rewarded with empty looks. “
Neither Binky nor Lightning (or the other horses) needed much invitation though and soon the pile was visibly shrinking.
There was a moment of heavy silence hanging between them, then Harry, grasping for a change of topic, ventured: “So, do you always come visit this early?”
Harry watched intently at the way Draco said his surname: Potter, with a P-sound, puckering his lips. Mhm, where had they left off in the hallway?
Draco excused himself and ventured into the kitchen where he started on making some tea. He vaguely wondered if maybe it hadn't been the best plan to have the newly-weds reconcile in his living room with the nice couch ensemble and he turned on the wireless, upping the volume as it played
“No, I'm sure this is it! Persephone is one of the alter egos of the crone character in The Hunt. And there's the key right here: Call his name, that's all!” Draco laughed happily and toppled over backwards.
“Yes, yes,” Seeker snorted, throwing his hands in the air. “But you all also said that you spent your summer mostly at Hoher Meißner and then we went back there, so The Hunt
The farmer looked at Draco with an unreadable expression, then he pushed himself from the table. “Come. I'll show you.”
“Don't you have plans with your family?” the Weasel obliviously clarified. “I mean you've been at this project the whole time. Don't you want to go home for Christmas? See your parents?”
Before Draco could stop himself, he blurted out: “Harry... don't go.” He blushed crimson. Oh shit, did he really just...? “I mean, I mean –
“But then... I don't understand. The wand was the only plausible thing that was different. Why is it that I can remember Potter when no one else can if we don't have,” he gestured helplessly, emitting sparks from the tip of his wand in the process, “anything special between us?”
“Oh.” Harry's eyes went to Sleipnir. During their conversation, the horse had been idly shuffling dead leaves with the nose. Maybe that was the true nature of all things related to The Hunt, they were always somehow
“Well?! What do you lowbrows think? Is this a dress or what?” Wolfe paraded her borrowed pearl tulle dress like a model on the catwalk. The fine layers of her garment were billowing in a light breeze.
Harry scrunched up his nose. Showering had been a good idea though. Draco had been right – Harry had reeked a bit of horse and such. Draco however smelled fantastic, of lemon balm. Inhaling deeply, Harry sighed; it was nice to wear Draco's shirt, his scent. The former huntsman blushed slightly at thinking how the other boy was wearing Harry's shirt at this very moment.
“Well, yes, of course. If I start something, I do it right.” Bashfulness and pride fought a battle on Draco's face.
Swooping down low to examine the repaired roof part that seemed to finally stay whole, Potter had his back to Draco when he answered: “I just felt like I could. With you.”
Draco huffed exasperatedly, but couldn't hide a smile. “Yes, yes, that's sweet. But I'd rather you would think about yourself first. You never worry about yourself.” He scrunched up his nose. “Guess that's my job now.”
Ron's freckled face brightened. “Distraction, you say. I know just the thing, I say.” He grinned and the way he did made Hermione think that this would be a Fred-and-George-style type of diversion. Well, as long as it got Harry out of trouble.
Harry sent a final farewell towards Death and Life who had been standing at the fringe of the encampment the whole time, watching them. They returned the gesture in kind.
“You're glowing,” said Potter unintelligently and as much as Draco wanted to snap back and say that 'obviously he was glowing', some part of him wished Potter had meant it differently, had said it in a different setting, for a different reason. So he kept quiet and started flicking off the algae from his soaked cloak instead.
“Don't I what?” Draco snapped in a fit of pique. It was one thing to be unable to keep memories of Potter because of The Hunt's magic, another altogether though to skip out of helping to go frolicking when Potter was in distress somewhere.
Then Draco spoke: “Thanks for the lecture, Granger. I'll see to looking into that a bit more and also the animal spirits. Now, almost time to get back, isn't it?”
And when he finally could lift his head again, he was alone in the quiet night. Potter was nowhere to be seen. The Hunt had taken him.
“You're here, too,” Hermione pointed out, her mind racing to find a way out of this uncomfortable situation.
“Guess that went south,” Cassius shrugged and grinned. “Nice doggy though, Weasley. Looked a bit like Dash, my neighbour's pup. He is such a nice little dog I should like to show you! A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly brown hair!”
“Do you really, Seeker, do you?” BraveHeart had Grapes flying upside down and hung his head next to Harry's, looking eager. “What do you see?”
To Harry's astonishment though, Malfoy's next words were not 'Here you go – where's my way out?', but instead: “I got distracted. It doesn't count. Let's go one move back.” Malfoy painted an inviting smile on his lips. “You like to please me, don't you? That's how I made you.”
Draco crossed his arms over his chest, schooling his face to look indifferent. “Got your memories back then, did you? And how, pray tell, did you know where we were?”
He turned off the lights, hummed a Christmas carol and fell asleep – not realising that he had not said his mantra yet... as he had finally forgotten the last bit about one Harry James Potter.
“You don't gather they did something to him, do you? He looks really rattled. They didn't, like, take his soul or something?”
“Here, I want to show you something,” Harry chuckled and tugged Draco into the library by his hand. “This.” He held out the notebook, open on the first page with the various unflattering attributes of Harry.
Hahaha, no. This is a deliberately chosen recurring motive. Call it symbolism, since essentially this story is about healing and hope. I like subtle things like that, such as the fact that when Draco forgot 'Harry' it thundered (Berchthold) and when he forgot 'Potter' it snowed (Holle). Also I love foreshadowing, such as having Harry ride a
As they drew back with matching brightness in their eyes, Draco was too flustered to say much. Merlin, how did he ever get into this... should he call it friendship? He cleared his throat.
After travelling over land for a while, they were soaring over an ocean now, the water a steel-blue grey, glittering in the winter sun.
Harry folded his arms before his chest. “My name is Harry,” he said with a snarl, not at all amused about being called not only dead a few minutes ago but now a wizard? By the name of Seeker? His irritation bubbled up.
Harry ducked quickly into the entry and– nearly toppled over. Behind the door was nothing but a very narrow and very brittle-looking staircase that led steeply into the darkness, the bottom-half indeterminable in the shadows.
Draco’s footsteps resumed, echoing on the walls. He briefly considered heading back towards the library to search Potter's name in the books there, but he realised that if Potter wasn't in McGonagall's books, he likely wasn't in any books at all.
“The Wild Hunt... isn't that a children's tale?” mused Wild-One. “Mum, Dad, you told us the story when we were younger, didn't you? How did that go?”
Harry glanced at Malfoy who had been strangely quiet during the little exchange. The blond boy looked decidedly more unwell than he had before. And... guilty. He looked guilty.
“It's AMAZING,” yelled Harry happily over the noise of the wind and the frolicking hunting party, “and my name is Harry!”
Following these words were immediate reactions: While Draco's thoughts flew towards excitement that he had finally found someone who might know something, Granger's hand flew to cover her mouth as Weasley flew out of his chair and hastily started ransacking the room for a kettle and cups.
Of course, Draco, Vincent and Gregory were close. How could they not be? After all, they'd known each other from an early age. However, His Majesty had been right about this part (duh, Draco had
“Like dogs, Warrington, do you?” Weasley commented unnecessarily, because duh. “Me too.” Double-duh.
“That's the first time I've ever heard you say 'please',” Granger piped up thoughtfully. “Okay, let's hear him out, shall we? It won't hurt, right?”
amusing,” Harry remarked and Draco snorted. “But I wouldn't have needed those to find out about your thoughts on my spectacles, did I now?” Pointing at Draco's reading glasses on top of Harry's head, the latter grinned widely. “Like my style, Malfoy?”
Harry swallowed at this. Maybe there had been... the tiniest bit... if he were very honest with himself... He shoved the thought away; even if there once had been some truth to it, now it certainly wasn't the case. He wanted to live, more than ever – with Draco.
He just about shoved the book into her face. “Here, read for yourself. The chapter on The Battle of Hogwarts.”
Breathing heavily as if he'd just run a marathon, Harry simply lay there, Malfoy half on top of him, and took stock of all his joints. Still in one piece. Thank goodness.
As he browsed the pages, he understood what Theodore had meant – all the recipes for supposedly better skin and slimmer hips came with accompanying background stories.
He had told Draco that he 'liked' him. How soon was too soon to rectify this statement, to confess deeper feelings...?
gave Harry some uncomfortably indecent ideas that he'd rather not explore, thank you very much. Why was an arsehole's arse suddenly so bloody engaging? Malfoy was still Malfoy after all, firm bum notwithstanding. On the other hand... ass was ass, no matter the gender... yet Harry wasn’t
“Actually–” Hermione faltered. “Yeah, alright. That's the last thing he needs: more Umbridge. Let's see to it that neither of us gets caught though. So don't do anything rash when we come across Malfoy, deal?”
When he'd been old enough to understand, Harry had sat Teddy down and brought him into the loop of all things Deathly Hallows.
“Harry.” Draco had come back to stand before him and cupped his face. He kissed Harry slowly, taking his time to show him exactly
“Here we are. Those are the castle walls.” Ada pointed ahead, beyond the magnificent underwater birds. Draco could barely tear his eyes away.
“Ah, we just call them that. They are not really her daughters... I think,” Half, arm around Wolfe, explained. “Rumour has it she's still a virgin anyway.” He snickered. “I mean,
Seeker shivered, somehow this picture reminded him of the Jolly Roger from The Hunt's games. It made him uneasy, yet he was curious. A serpent for a tongue and he himself could speak to snakes, so was maybe this tattoo connected to him? Did Draco get a tattoo for him? Did he like him
As Draco had learnt, the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare was a hobby Granger had taken up back in their school days. Now, due to her status as war heroine, the movement had evolved quite a bit, so that it kept Granger rather busy with charity events and promotions.
“We'll better add a Strengthening Spell as well,” Granger pondered and started murmuring incantations, seemingly trying for the right words.
Music and laughter was filling the chilly morning air and Harry found his eyes darting quickly this way and that trying to take everything in at once. He was fascinated as well as freaked out.
“Chop-chop, Seeker, we got a sighting of The Beginning,” Half greeted him, shouting over the turmoil, while he heaved a heavy blanket onto Lightning's back. Seeker's horse had become slow and fat during summer and was not amused at all to be dragged out to work.
shirt,” he growled. Indeed, Potter was wearing Draco's old Quidditch training T-shirt, a school-issued uniformly black piece with the Slytherin crest on the left chest.
Draco peeked through the grid covering the entrance. It was pitch black. He screwed up his nose. “This is what exactly?”
“So... what you're saying is: We'll talk about it when you're ready, but not now?” That absolute arse.
Once again I have to apologize for a late chapter. I don't know why I can't keep schedule with this story. Sigh. I'm sorry.
Life shook her head. “Bite me if I've ever seen such a dunderhead! You're really something else, boyo.” She reached out with her cold hands and mussed up Harry's hair and then, for good measure, Draco's.
Harry, sensing the approaching storm, put a hand on Draco's knee, smiling. “I told you they are shit.”
“Aren't we done with introductions yet? Besides, time to eat!” chuckled Wolfe who had finished handing out sticks with sticky sweets in different colours.
When he leant over the cradle, the little boy inside started to make happy baby noises and reached with his tiny arms for Draco.
Walking around, grabbing for food and attention in turn, he didn't notice he had reached the end of the park area until he – THUD – walked face-first into something.
“It wasn't the end of our story though: Others came. Others like us. Until there was a village, half on the shore, half under the waves. And the whisper of a safe haven floated through the oceans.”
“Quite so,” acquiesced First Voice. “I is Lacie by the way and these is my sisters, Tillie and Elsie.”
“I have some biscuits,” Harry quickly cut in and dug in his pockets, “and comfits. Want some? They're teeny though.”
Draco took a deep breath and rapped on the door. Speaking with Muggles was still not easy for him. He often spluttered and grappled with everyday words (heir-plain was a hate-word of his but often came up). At least today he would have Granger as a help.
“People leave stuff for us so we don't harm them,” it was Ember who answered, an unpleasant look of hunger in his eyes that had nothing to do with the hay, “because sometimes we do.”
is Potter!”) and also the heartfelt advice to have a check-up while Draco was here since “imagining someone who isn't there is a sign of insanity, Malfoy”.
did the fighting. It was bloody hero Potter who defeated the Dark Lord while you all just gawked at him. Did it with this very wand.” He held up his magic stick and twirled it around.
is allowed to speak for me and take its words at face value? God, the horror. I'll have to talk to Headmistress McGonagall about this later. And I'd like to see your reaction once they hang up
“That never stops you. You take all the blame for their deaths as well,” Draco mumbled and pressed into the touch.
He quickly dispensed his biscuits and was generally glad that no one made a bad joke about the quality of the baked goods. Weirdly, Lovegood even praised them. Well, that girl was peculiar in every sense.
A bit startled, Hermione reached for the offered things. “Ah, oh, yeah, thanks. Now, be quiet for a moment, all of you, I have to think.”
“Bloody hell!” Weasley swore at the same time Pansy did and for a second they looked at each other with deep understanding.
While walking down the hallways he wondered why his painted self could speak the truth out loud he himself didn't even dare to think. Maybe, because Portrait-Harry had nothing to lose... after all,
Death's remark about the scorch marks had reminded Harry of something Ember/Crabbe had said about Berchthold way back:
While risky saying so, it was true nevertheless: They'd been attacked because they – and the rest of Umbridge's Inquisitorial Squad – had taken to abusing their new-found powers and to bullying fellow students left and right.
“Alright, alright, you win!” Harry conceded breathlessly and let himself drop heavily next to Draco on the couch.
The blond bed head turned around to reveal red-rimmed, wild eyes, staring up at Harry. Draco really looked a bit deranged at that moment.
Harry shivered. It was six in the morning, still long before sunrise and after all the turbulent events of the night (and the whole past year, really), he was getting  cold and tired.
“Not another word!” Death growled, but the cow-horned crone ignored him and continued: “The answer is this: He would have taken Berchthold's place.”
“Helga's Tea Room, Helga's Tea Room... That rings a bell somehow. Argh, think! I've read that in some book, but I don't remember where.”
“I needed a day at the beach with my girlfriend,” the redhead tried to joke and put an arm around Granger who smiled tight-lipped. “Actually, yeah, maybe I did. I wanted a break, away from the shop. It's fun to work with George, but it's harder than you would think, to run a store.”
Harry's eyes went round like saucers and he stared first at the paper in his hand then at Life and then at Draco whose expression showed just as much surprise.
The house-elf had been latching onto Harry, gripping so tightly neither of them had been able to pry him off, and blubbering noisy apologies into  Harry's trousers' fabric.
“Er.” This was not going as Draco had imagined it and now he was a bit put off his stride. Their expectant beaming was unnerving. Fine. He squared his shoulders. “Very well, but only because it's your big day,
So, Harry had set forth his ideas and not two weeks later (with a lot of help and good connections) the H.E.D.W.I.G. programme had been called to life, a programme to Help Everyone Drowning Woefully In Grief.
Eyeing a colourful banner with the lettering 'Merry Christmas' written across, Draco recalled something odd Pansy had asked him during that time: “Why do you never say Merry Christmas back?”
God lord above, was he spared nothing? Dutifully he wrapped the now freely crying young woman into his arms and did his best not to roll his eyes. He was used to the explosive fights of his friends, but he could have thought of a better time for a nuclear fallout than Christmas morning.
where, in the beginning, she falls down a rabbit hole. And I just thought how this was like that story and poof, there she is, looking exactly like the movie version I watched as a child.”
At Harry's raised eyebrow, Malfoy explained with a solemn voice: “I would light a candle but I think he's had enough of fire for an eternity. Plus, the birds keep him company... since no one else does.”
“What's going on is,” Zabini, tall, dark and fierce ducked out of the room, as a splintering something hit the wall next to the door from inside, “that Goyle is beyond miserable and drinking himself into an early grave while his supposed
Harry was too busy pulling himself up on the tablecloth to answer. He had shrunk down to the size of his tea cup, more or less; maybe around eight and a half centimetres. So in order not to fall down onto his arm-chair, he'd clung to the edge of the table and had to scramble up now. When he'd finally managed, he was panting and glaring up at his mimicry of a face. “You did this!”
“Of course,” the other wizard answered dryly, his lips curling into a half-smile. “Well, now that you apparently have a newly redecorated house I'm sure you'll find a place to hang a portrait or two.” He blinked innocently. “Maybe ask that nice lady back in there for the contact information of the painter?”
,” he enunciated.) and opened the other one himself. He grew increasingly frustrated. Nothing. Potter's name was nowhere mentioned; neither in the newer section about this year's events nor in the older one about the happenings seventeen years ago.
“It'll be just for fun. Something some Patchers came up with last week and I mean, you do a lot of work at the castle, so you should come?” Longbottom looked a bit uneasy but then his face sobered. “Your help on the heating system in the dungeons really saved us in winter. I would have frozen my arse off if you hadn't found the reversing spell for that Heat-Blocker Hex.” He gave Draco a serious look. “We noticed, you know. You really are putting your shoulder to the wheel.”
Granger, smiling gently, went to assist him, while the owner of the kitchen just stared at the couple as if they were insane. Then he sighed heavily and said, waving a hand: “Brew a cup of coffee for me then.” Which they did.
“No! Don't leave! I still have to say... Give him back! Please give him back to me!” Draco ran dangerously close at the edge of the cliffs, stumbling at every second step as he almost  hysterically tried to catch up with his rider.
If anyone knew, they might find it weird that it was Draco that Potter confided in, of all people, and vice versa. But for them, it had come naturally. After all, they had literally gone through fire together.
“Something's wrong with this place.” Malfoy scrunched up his nose in frustration, glaring at his wand as if it was its fault.
“That's what we house-elves call it: the underground system of tunnels and pipes that lay under Hogwarts. We don't go down there, because there have been enough elves that never came back. We only take care of the Mell elves. And only on weekends also. During weekdays, all ways to and fro are barred to elves, for our own safety. Hogwarts takes care of its Underworld itself.”
“Yeah, alright. Good job, you. Have at it then,” Draco sighed and fed the bird a piece of toast, which he happily munched while Draco unfurled the attached scroll with a frown.
Harry squeezed Draco's fingers slightly. “Can you imagine? All of this – master of Death, The Hunt and all that – started with me grabbing your hand.”
Draco jumped up as though stung by a bee. Potter! He had nearly forgotten about Potter! How could Draco have been so careless as to... his eyes snapped to the book and he hoicked it up. Empty pages. Blank! All of them!
“What's happening is that these spectres think they're so great, but they're not. Ha, is that all you can do?” His head had swollen to a size so big he could have no longer pulled it back inside if he had wanted to.
The chaos and racket was just too much for Harry's still somewhat hurting head. He wanted to join but at the same time wanted to be somewhere more quiet to clear his thoughts and find out where he was – and maybe more importantly, who.
Indeed, the things Malfoy did. Harry was a bit flummoxed. Why was Malfoy doing all this for him? And why was he so obedient towards house-elves? There had to be a story, but Harry didn't dare ask with the sisters listening in. Some of Malfoy's displayed unease around them had seeped into Harry. He felt a creeping anxiety pushing at the edges of his vision. Just, something about those three and Malfoy's reaction towards them...
A cynical smile spread on the merchieftainess' lips. “Well, I'd reciprocate the compliment, Champion. But I'd think it's better to speak the truth and you students being down here is not really all that... good.”
Frustrated, he ran a hand through his unruly hair shifting the flower crown Holle had given him. Then he sighed long and deep and glanced over his shoulder: There was Ember, the big, intimidating boy holding on securely to a sleeping pile of pink wrinkles and tiny toes. He caught his eye and smiled gently.
“What're you looking at?” he spat as venomously as possible. “I don't want to work with you, so kindly fuck the hell off already!”
Well, better than wanting to get back together. Draco shook his head, wondering why he even cared. Then he snuggled his cheek into Potter's hair (to comfort Potter,
“Good, because I'm glad I'm not dead, too,” tried Potter to ease the mood. Yet there was a hint of something else that Draco couldn't quite place.

He groaned and released the wriggly Pig from his grip. “Just a cup of tea, if you please. And then tell me why I rushed over here first thing this morning.”
explanation and if he was honest, Harry was starting to get a headache from all these new/old realisations and revelations. Their nice warm bed at Grimmauld Place sounded suddenly very alluring, even if it was a tiny bit too soft. It was time to wrap this up.
A quiet laughter made them both turn around. Myrtle had come back and was now hiding her pimpled face behind one hand.
Malfoy didn't really get a chance though because Slytherin Harry's fist crashed onto the tabletop and he hissed with an icy voice: “Nobody asked YOUR opinion! You're a filthy, Muggle-loving prat and have no clue how a real wizard should behave.” His ire cooled down as fast as it had erupted and he continued a lot softer: “I'm a superior version of you. The real Harry Potter. As you should be. Tell him, Draco. Tell him, I'm a much better fit for you. ”
Walking back into the fog, Seeker knew he was on the right way. Soon, he heard the familiar laughter and the clamour of The Hunt. It was blue hour and the world was tinged in fading residue of daylight, when Seeker finally stepped back onto the clearing at Holle's Pond.
There was an awkward pause during which both boys tried to stomach Myrtle's sudden appearance and the fact that she had mistaken their trying to repair the window as ‘light signals’, then they both spoke at once:
They were lucky. The fall wasn't that deep – only three meters or so – and Malfoy's Seeker reflexes made him land catlike on his hands and feet.
For one, he had placed an assortment of pots on his bedside table – teapots, cooking pots, flower pots – so that he would see them and remember Potter the moment he woke up. Furthermore, he had started to collect all kinds of pottery and put them all over the house, for the same purpose.
He himself hadn't had time, since up until yesterday he'd been hunting down a lead in Egypt. Which had unfortunately turned out to be another dead end.
That statement made Harry's hair stand on end. The clock-faces. They hadn't been old men at all, they had been– Harry felt sick and looking at Malfoy, he must have figured it out, too, as the pale boy had just grown even paler. They'd better get out of here soon.
“Not a dream,” Harry confirmed, still puzzled with Malfoy's sudden outburst and his following implications. “But–”
No one had given him any hope for employment, so he pondered about it for a moment. Working for the Weasel, that thought was grotesque. Yet, somewhat alluring... a real job, a real purpose, earning his own money, clean from any Death Eater relations...
“It could go through there and be where it was but,” Lacie pointed at where Tillie had moved aside an old rain barrel and had opened a hidden trapdoor, “sometimes backwards is not forwards and the only way up is down. Or...” Lacie's grin was a bit deranged by now, “it could stay here with us. Forever.”
Potter hummed thoughtfully and the sound reverberated through Draco in a way that made him acutely aware that he should be going somewhere else. Now.
Harry stared at the picture. It had a draw he couldn't explain. Something dark and twisted, then again hopeful? It gave him a weird feeling.
Harry snorted. “Thanks ever so much. Now, do you want to explain to me what on earth a Wental Mell is?”
“Just one cup short of a full set,” giggled Alice, which earnt her a sharp look from Queen Harry. Which was odd.
When Harry's feet first had touched the ground on top of the cliffs, rushing back all the lost images, his feelings for Barn Boy had fought a silent battle with the status quo that 'Malfoy and Potter' had had when Harry had been stolen. The status quo of being something akin to friends and with Harry being unsure about his feelings' depth. It had been chaos in his head, however seeing Draco had somehow put Harry at ease and while all had been so much, almost too much, he had simply trusted that things would be alright with Draco there (and Ron and Hermione – crazy how those two had gotten hitched!).
Pansy cringed. For two reasons: One, Pig and Pepper were clearly making beady eyes at each other (ugh! Her owl had no taste!) and two... well, 'chap' was definitely not among Pansy's favourite colloquialisms. Like,
It wasn't just that, though. Draco turned around to face the opposite wall, finding it empty. No sign of the hilariously hideous portrait of a goofy-faced Potter that the thankful wizarding community had insisted on hanging there at the re-opening celebrations in August.
“Okay, so what you need to do is this: Just follow Berchthold on Sleipnir. He knows the way.” Half  was serious for once and pointed in the distance where Harry could make out a lone rider, halfway up the slope.
– they were speeding alongside her, which felt strange given their height difference (Mabel was about seven foot).
“Don't know.” Harry titled his head back to look once more up the way they'd fallen down. “I'd say I give pretty good advice – after all, cushions broke our fall.
“That Potter owning my wand for a while makes up the strong connection needed so that I didn't forget about him when everyone else did.”
Big news - the 2021 Mimbelwimbel Award for Most Entertaining Live Beta-Tweeting goes to... umbrellaless22! Wohoo~
Mabel ignored Draco's answer and launched into an explanation instead: “It's really simple. First, you have to have a race-course, a sort of circle, and then all the party is placed along the course, here and there. Then the race starts when everyone begins swimming at their own pace whenever they like and it ends when everyone leaves off whenever they like. So, it's not always easy to know when the race is over.”
He looked a bit ill, thought Draco. He had certainly noticed Potter's dark circles, the ongoing boniness, their midnight run-ins in the Entrance Hall. Potter had said it himself, earlier: He was still struggling with war-related things, the same as Draco. 'And everyone else,' Draco added bitterly and hesitantly took a sip from the bottle. The cold water felt divine. Draco eyelids were heavy and fell shut.
. What else? Mhm, I don't know – maybe the fact that you spent the whole summer talking about nothing else but him? Ring a bell?”
Last week marked the anniversarry of the first Covid-case in my country. Crazy, huh? Already a whole year...
that he had forgotten in the Charms classroom this morning? Couldn't he just have taken Ron up on his offer to share his?
Seeker nearly jumped out of his skin from surprise as Draco absent-mindedly put his hand on top of Seeker's hand. Impossible. He couldn't know! Or could he?
! Look, they brought provisions after all!” cried a half-naked, somewhat demonic looking lady next to Harry and her words focussed the attention of the crowd on the findings. Excited masses shuffled to the victuals corner and Harry was pushed and prodded from all sides.
It had been the last time Seeker would see him for a while, as the gang had informed him that The Hunt's leader rode solitarily outside of winter time: Berchthold ruled The Hunt during Twelvetide, Perchta during the rest of the year.
Draco had not planned on getting a cat. He had only been in Rome in the first place because he had been following a lead towards a source about the
“Oi! Let go of her!” Ron had quickly jumped in and separated the two girls, both red-cheeked and panting.
“Argh!” Seeker, who was in the middle of a game of ninepins with the gang, suddenly found himself at the centre of  a cloud of feathers which apparently had exploded from the pin he had just hit.
“Here you are, Seeker.” (“Harry!”) Wolfe was offering him a rainbow-coloured horseback cover, while Half unasked hung a satchel over Harry's shoulder. “Up in the saddle. In a way.”
Somehow, between spilling their truths and spilling their sweat they had come to an unspoken arrangement – to be confidants to one another.
Only as he had crossed the park's border did he hesitate for a moment. He had felt so close to Potter here. Draco looked over his shoulder.
“We might have won but for the merpeople joining hands with the fishermen. Both species had decided that they were better off separated than together. Mixing bloodlines, they thought, was filthy.”
“Shut. Up,” Malfoy's pressed voice floated up the stairs. “I'm trying to get out of the mess you got us in,” he glanced over his shoulder, a strand of sweaty hair falling into his eyes, “and if you ask
A haggard-looking man in his mid-twenties opened the door. With his ruffled clothes, his unkempt dark hair and the purple bags under his eyes, he reminded Draco of Potter right after the war.
“Here! Mistress Hufflepuff's Tea Room is in the Underworld as well. Dobby knows that, but Dobby also knows that it is a good place, although a bit... wonky. Mistress Hufflepuff has written all about it in here!”
That earnt him a drawn-up eyebrow from Harry. “How is that any different than the tables up in the Great Hall?” He edged closer to the buffet to eye a plate with bread and butter next to jars of jam and orange marmalade. His stomach signalled interest.
Draco took pity and cast a warming spell on the newcomer – being outside in a November storm like today's must have frozen his lover to the core. Still, Harry's sparkling eyes and ruddy cheeks said that the career change from Auror-in-training to Seeker had been the right choice.
No such luck though. “Malfoy.” Twin Weasley, merrily clad in a bizarre Christmas costume, motioned at him over the heads of the crowd.
Black fur and green eyes, Draco had found Howard, a stray, dumpster-diving in one of Rome's many side-streets. He'd been a malnourished and flea-ridden little thing. Overall not a nice sight, but the resemblance to a certain Boy Who Got Himself Lost had won Draco over and he had taken him home and named him Harry (because he was
Harry knew, rationally, he should be scared, too, but somehow a deep-seated confidence let him be calm in the face of Death himself. “I think, inside, I suspected it. Ever since we were in Sweden and that woman died... The way you were with her...”
“Malfoy, a word.” Draco turned to find the bulk of Potter's former dorm mates facing him. Longbottom, Finnigan and Thomas had him surrounded, no way of escaping.
Potter,” muttered Malfoy but the words didn't have any sting to them and Harry could sense the other relaxing again.
“I heard,” was all the reply Harry got and somehow this made him angry. He had thought that Malfoy was changing, trying to be more tolerant, but now his reluctance to meet Andromeda irked Harry tremendously.
“I suppose. Even though I wasn't wholly aware, I think. I just felt... numb. For pain, for pleasure, for everything really. It was always there, this haze, in the back of my mind, no matter if I laughed or cried.” He titled his head, so he could look at Draco's profile and the other boy turned to eye him. “In retrospective, after the War, I've only ever really felt alive when I was with you, Draco. I didn't realise it, but I was holding on to those moments I could spend with you at Hogwarts, patching.”
Meanwhile, what made him stand apart from any other entity Harry had ever laid eyes upon was his raw
Potter (or was it Harry now?) ignored Draco and nuzzled his ear. “The only thing my peabrain is thinking about right now is kissing you; in fact I thought about kissing you every day since Windsor Great Park.”
Snowdrop landed on his shoulder and rubbed her head against his cheek. Seeker felt a pang of guilt that he had left the owl behind. He rubbed her head and whispered a quiet 'sorry', getting an affectionate hoot as reply.
“I'll talk to him,” Wolfe offered, but before she had gotten out of sight, she turned around again and came back, followed by Ember who was carrying Dreamer in his large arms. Dog Scoffer accompanied the trio, seemingly excited at the sight of Mr. Withane as he yelped loudly when he saw the farmer and tried to jump up at him.
As Draco states somewhere there are at least 20+ names for each of the two Hunt leaders. I chose by random or more precisely I chose those names I liked best from the heap.
“Spiderweb Algae,” Mabel told them. “Look.” They were out of the cloud and the merwoman picked a thin, gleaming strand of algae from Draco's shoulder.
With the end of the speech, dinner was declared open and the Great Hall exploded in voices, laughter and busyness, with people eating, drinking and going back and forth to talk with friends and exchange words with acquaintances.
“Alright, out with it. What is up with you today?” Draco set his teacup down on the kitchen table of number twelve, Grimmauld Place.
“I think you had me for a long time already,” Draco ventured thoughtfully, facing ahead. “You don't have the monopoly on obliviousness.” Picking up Harry's left hand, Draco entwined their fingers. “Do you remember that time at the lake, when we watched the sunrise together?” Harry hummed affirmatively. “That's when I first allowed myself – just for a second – to think that there could be more.”
Eyeing the tranquil pond with its midnight blue water, its ever-present soft bell chimes and its gentle Somewhen glow, Seeker couldn't help but be confused. “I don't get it.”
“This is different and you know it! You and your shitty ingrained slurs that belittle everyone who isn’t pure-blood enough for you!”
Suddenly, Harry wanted to scream; to scream at Malfoy to shut up, to scream at Dumbledore for mistreating the elves, to scream at Hermione that she didn't understand him at all, to scream at himself for all the dumb shit he'd done, all the guilt, all the...
“Oh, I don't know... for treating him awfully? How about hurting him? Being mean to him? Ring a bell?”
She walked back to the hidden entry and opened the door. Looking inside, she only found blackness of the kind that gave no clue whatsoever what was in it. Carefully she dipped a hand over the threshold.
Draco was just about to bite back, when the girl of the group cut in: “Hey, boys, will you stop it? The letter, Draco?”
“Hi there, can you tell me where we are?” Seeker squatted down to talk to the boy, but the kid just bounced in excitement and put all his fingers at once into his mouth. “I guess you're not supposed to talk to strangers. But I just need to know–”
As frustrating as this was, things got worse when he realised, he couldn't really pick up anything, which meant that although he was obviously hidden by Hunt magic, he couldn't just snatch a few bits of fish and chips from passers-by and thus, in the afternoon, on top of everything, Seeker grew terribly hungry.
“I took her down, below the surface, to my home village. I introduced her to my father and told him that she was the one for me.”
“That, p, is not, pp, funny!” he complained while spitting out fluff and rubbing at his eyes – the prank had even snuck behind his glasses.
desperate, despite his recently renewed single status. Had Cho’s backside ever seemed so appealing though…? Gee, being a teenager with teenage hormones was the worst, really.)
“No one knows about that but you, me, Ron and Hermione. And we didn't tell anyone.” A breeze ruffled Harry's hair and he shuddered involuntarily as the memory of the Fiendfyre resurfaced.
finish that word!” sounded the voice of a sturdy woman through the night. She had appeared in the door frame presumably to see what the ruckus was all about.
“With pleasure,” she offered and was doubly pleased to hear Weasley's just-started snickering morph into a surprised cough. “No problem at all. It says here
cupboard then.” Portrait-Harry sighed. “Just so you know, I don't blab out our secrets just because I'm painted to look like an idiot. I mean
In an attempt to distract himself from the hand-holding (while Malfoy was determinedly muttering under his breath), Harry took the time to really look at Alice who sat on her dormouse seat cushion and didn't move, resembling a life-like doll. What had it been he'd been thinking about her earlier? 'At least Alice would have an idea.'
While his parents eagerly reached for the offered quill to retrieve their freedom, Draco's gaze flew across the room and landed on the key witness of this trial.
Ron pulled his own coin from his pocket and showed it to her, and really, the message had appeared as it should have.
“Let's say they exist, which I highly doubt, and this is a legit ghost type. I still don't see the connection to the baby,” Draco cut in.
“Er, Ember do you also see those random animals in front of the chariot?” Seeker asked the big guy, while rapidly blinking to perceive the zoo better.
He turned on his heels and walked back to his painted twin. After all, this was the perfect opportunity.
“Thank you, all, for coming for me though. I'm glad you saved me. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad riding with The Hunt. In fact, it was rather fun and I,” Potter faltered for a moment, “I'm sorry I didn't get to say goodbye.”
Harry was more than enough, thank you), but had relented when being faced with two sets of Potter puppy eyes.
She turned the portrait around so that all of them could see it: It was unmistakably Malfoy, his shoulders, the little curl of hair around his ears, yet the whole person was black, just a silhouette. Only over the chest was a blindingly white lightning bolt criss-crossing from the right shoulder almost down to Malfoy's left hip.
Half smirked. “Magic! No, really, it's more like amnesia – you remember how to talk, but not what you said.”
“What's wrong with him then?” Parkinson made a half-hearted attempt at freeing herself. “Why won't you tell us?”
“You are glowing to me with Somewhen glow,” Harry disclosed. “I've met you before, previous to joining The Hunt.”
“The infant was attached to its mother when she died. She unknowingly took the baby along when she crossed over. But she didn't take it further, into the next realm. Now this nursling is caught between worlds, sleeping forever. Not dead, but not really alive either, sort of in a coma. It's a real shame.” For once there was no mirth in Half's eyes.
he fell so hard for a bad boy in the beginning, all the million little reasons why he would keep on falling were very obvious to him in this moment, standing in their kitchen.
Wow, this chapter (alternative chapter title: A Year with Seeker and The Wild Hunt) really turned out so much,
This was how Draco found himself in the middle of a swirl of merpeople, clutching a lobster, and with Potter singing into his ear “will you, won't you”.
Okay, so, Harry'd played Ron often enough to know all the rules. He should be able to do this. After all, he was basically playing against himself. He would show them both – Malfoy and his weird idea of Harry.
“Stop petting me, Potter, do I look like an owl?” Malfoy's raucous voice already sounded annoyed again as he pushed Harry's arm away and wiped angrily at his face to get rid of the tears that had spilt down his cheeks while nearly suffocating just a moment ago. So, he was fine then.
Breathing heavily, he tried to open a door to his right only belatedly realising that it was no door at all but one of the many trick walls just
Especially not, when, later, Girl Weasley had walked up to them, eyeing them both critically for a moment before she'd kissed Harry on the cheek (Gasp! How dare she!) and had said: “It was good we broke up when we did. The way you look at Draco... I've waited a long time for you to look at me like that. But you never did. Be happy, Harry. You deserve it. You too, Draco – you're not that bad.” Then she'd sauntered away, leaving the two young men speechless in her wake.
“Hmh,” Harry hummed, glancing up and then away again, his cheeks tinting. “So, what makes you think that I came looking for someone in particular tonight?”
“Sure.” Malfoy sat down in the arm-chair that had formerly belonged to Harry. His grey eyes darted here and there on the board; clearly he was already planning a strategy. “He can
Since then summer had come to an end and in the last rays of the late August sun Holle (or Frigg?) finally returned – and with her the clouds above the clearing and the ever-falling snow.
And I planned the story beforehand. That some chapters got longer while I wrote wasn't exactly planned though, haha.
Draco huffed. “I told you: I'm doing this because someone's in trouble and needs saving. And weren't you the one who said not to bring up Potter so you would remember The Hunt better?”
After a moment of hesitation, Harry let Half gently take his left wrist against better judgment. The ginger lifted their hands and stopped short. “Huh. He's right, gang. He's really not dead.”
Draco hated it that Potter could see right through him. Almost more than the fact that he was right.
But the big grin on the Golden Girl's face spoke volumes of the amount she was buying into Draco's assurances.
“All good and well, but today he's not putting his hands all over you. So, Ember, you're with me,” the gang's leader decided as the wind picked up.
“Okay, one? Of course he knows you. He adores you to a nauseating level. Two? You would seriously get divorced
Meanwhile, Lacie settled comfortably into the hole of  a big car tyre with Tillie perched on the edge. She'd fetched two actual dolls, puppets really, from somewhere and was waving them through the air with a blissful expression on her face.
“Once you join The Hunt, you become part of it. I don't think he had a choice," Granger had explained and it had made sense to Draco.
Harry was standing behind Draco, one hand at the other boy's hip and watched over his shoulder. “Oh? Seems like the notes came back with the memories as well. Anyhow,
“The others are already here,” Millicent told them, when Pansy pushed past her and made for the stairs, up to Gregory's room.
Completely blind-sighted, Draco blushed hard and spluttered: “Wha– What are you even talking about?”
Draco tried for balance. “You have no manners and no interest in pure-blood etiquette. Why should I even bother trying to explain anything to you? Give me one good reason!”
The song doesn't really fit my idea of The Hunt but I like it, so ignore the lyrics, just acknowledge the line
Now, he didn't even need to think twice before walking down the stairs to the entrance area of the house-elves' realm.
The sun painted glowing patterns on Draco's knees. They felt warm and pleasant. He put a hand on his thigh.
They were quiet for a moment, each lost in thought, then Harry asked carefully: “You won't tell anyone, will you? About this conversation.”
by Granger (quite handy that Human Presence Revealing Spell, Pansy had to remember that one) that indicated no one but them was in close range. They grouped around a table in a secluded corner near the Invisibility section.
“They gave me an address where a Mr. Withane lives who also looks for information on The Hunt. It's a long shot. It might just be curiosity for him. But I need to try and find out if he knows something. I'll see that I can find a Portkey over there for tomorrow.”
But knowing the gang was happily frolicking somewhere out there, living their best death – that lifted a part of Harry's heavy guilt from his shoulders. He knew without needing proof that he would not have nightmares about them again. Being (almost) dead for a while had made his life easier somehow.
Draco didn't answer. Instead he turned towards the rising sun and watched it climb over the edge of the enchanted mountain top.
From what they could see, she was wearing a summer-sky-blue dress under a white apron. A black ribbon held back her blonde hair which fell almost down to her waist. She was reclined in her large arm-chair (topped with a bright yellow cloche) and was petting a rabbit sitting on her lap.
It was almost dawn on New Year's when they returned home, exhausted but in high spirits (emotionally and liquor-wise).
Looking at the stuffed animal gave Harry pause. He had a Somewhen Thing that clearly belonged to a child. If there was a child waiting for him somewhere, shouldn't he put more effort into returning? Or maybe this was just something reminding him of his own childhood? Yes, that was more likely. He
Draco exhaled slowly while smoothing his loose strands with one hand. Whoever it was they didn't need to know about his inner crisis. He put on his poker face and went to open the door.
Draco fidgeted and pretended to take a sip from his already empty cup. “I made it. During the year. I thought... I mean, I hoped Potter would be back by Christmas and so... anyhow, it's meant to be useful.”
“Who they are. Inside.” Harry rolled back onto his stomach, he peered down Malfoy's forehead. “Would you never compete with me if I weren't a wizard? Never talk to me?”
“That was very nice of you,” Potter chimed in and Draco felt like strangling the tiny annoyer. What was
“Of course I know it,” Slytherin Harry tutted condescendingly and curled his upper lip. He tilted his head to the side and eyed Malfoy thoughtfully. “Should I break the spell so he'll  finally leave,” he bit his bottom lip in a startlingly sexy way, “and we can be
“I said I can't, you muppet! Stop shoving me! Look, Potter, I'm glued to the blasted thing.” And he demonstrated by making a quick yank, which earnt him a lapful of taken-by-surprise Harry.
, choked him as he despairingly watched the fading features of the only thing that mattered in the world.
"It's one of Berchthold's private pack, a dog of hell," Half chipped in. “It's a hell of a dog, haha. Seriously though, when prey is sighted, Perchta – Holle for you – calls them up ahead.”
“Yeah, our Dreamer... she is so good at sleeping, she can do it with her eyes closed,” Half laughed and mounted Gee, accompanied by a loud thunder clap.
Wolfe smirked and took over from Half by kissing Draco on both cheeks, “we saw him once, remember? Also, Perchta stopped by earlier and told us you were on your way back and would bring a
– remnants of people who died and stayed behind, because they felt they still had something important to do here, maybe lingering regrets. They are incorporeal. That is the ghost type we met at school, in the form of the house ghosts for example.”
“You got Harry a present?” Ronald leapt to his feet and came over to look at the item. “When did you buy that?”
“Alright, how about we make it up to you, yeah?” Half tried again. “We'll all help you take care of the baby.”
Anyway, Draco decided not to stay and find out and took to his heels, running down the pathway until he reached one of the park's exits, Blacknest Gate.
“One of them caught my eye,” Merchieftainess Murcus faltered, her mouth a sad line. “She sang beautifully; with eyes like the sea and a smile like sunshine. Her name was Aoife.”
He pointed to the front of the procession where, in that very moment, a black greyhound with a fishtail, gliding next to Berchthold, opened her muzzle and – cried like
“Oh, you don't know yet, Seeker, do you? Just wait and see, it's like super!” BraveHeart beamed and took Wolfe's hands to dance in a tight circle where they were shortly joined by Half.
“What's next?” Potter procured a bottle of water out of thin air (show-off!), took a sip and offered it to Draco.
It was as they looked at each other with puzzlement, when they both felt the burning of an incoming DA message.
Harry tilted his head back and stared at the ceiling unseeing. Living with The Hunt had put things back into perspective that he hadn't even had noticed were off-kilter. Guilt was only one of many topics he would have to mull over.
Granger huffed and rolled her eyes. Again. That was turning into a habit. “Well, what did they say?”
“Oh, yes. But don't worry, we'll honour your wishes and won't call your real names.” Harry and Draco had talked about it on the way. “That way, you can stay with The Hunt and live happily. More so than if you'd know your identity but couldn't go back to your lives. Since you're dead and all.” That sounded sad somehow. Better add something uplifting. “Oh, but we have the means to visit whenever we want to now, so we'll see each other plenty, I'd wager.”
“Oh, don't we know it!” Half leered and decided to tip Wolfe over. She squealed and trashed as he pressed fervent kisses onto her face.
Feeling the bed dip, he relaxed in anticipation of being snuggled – instead there was utterly unwelcome tickling!
Unsurprisingly, BraveHeart lost, as he ate all his building material and then insisted his art was nihilistic and called 'Nut Feast'. An honourable mention got Wolfe's interpretation of 'Berchthold on Sleipnir' which caused the others to refer to this day henceforth as Berchthold's Day. Surprisingly, it was Ember who won in the end, as he simply had put four nuts close together on the ground with a fifth nut balancing on top and called it 'Us' – four Hunt people helping Seeker to stay afloat with his dwindling memories.
He peered ahead. Between the masses of bodies, beast and human alike, over the heads of the hellhound pack, in front of Berchthold's horse Sleipnir, Harry could make out a spot of gentle brightness.
“Oh, people all over the world know about The Hunt and most of them fear us. But that is only because they
didn't want to dwell on the idea of an immortal Dark Lord, good gracious. Draco would buy Potter a thank you gift after all this. A big one.
“You mean the mighty Weasel?” Draco smirked and quickly ducked, for wrapping paper came flying his way, immediately followed by a redhead aiming to tickle.
“Here, you headache. Happy holidays.” Draco threw a few snacks at the scrawny being and proceeded to enter the kitchens.
, but they are not set in the same story-line-universe. If you want to know more about The Wild Hunt though, go check out Storm Chasers ;)
“What's so funny?” the Weasel queried, turning a page without even asking. The pictures on it showed Teddy.
“Hello, Howard.” Potter didn't take his gaze from the cat when he added: “You have nice eyes.”  Was this an innuendo at the resemblance or just a random comment? Despite the camomile tea, Draco felt his nerves rattling.
The words were almost hostile and yet a wave of relief flooded Draco. They would help. He wasn't alone in this anymore.
“Why do you have it then? If it was his?” Granger questioningly put her palm out to touch Draco's wand and after a moment of hesitation he handed it to her.
Wolfe had attempted to reason with him (“Those are the rules of nature.”), yet Harry had disregarded her.
There was a moment of silence during which Draco looked desperately between the two teachers, hoping that, even if they mysteriously couldn't quite recall Potter, they would at least want to save a person in need of help.
“Alright.” Draco squeezed his arm, nervousness shimmering through. “But don't be too daft and do anything rash like you normally would? Please just play it safe for once, okay?”
“Do you mind?!” Malfoy, shoving impatiently at Harry's chest, knocked the latter's thoughts out of the skies. Whoops, he'd still been holding on to the git.
Draco had indeed been idly following the Weasel's story while lazily sipping a cocktail Hermione had produced from a small beaded handbag (Draco hadn't asked about that), until an unfamiliar Athene noctua owl had shot in from the outside.
How lucky that Headmistress McGonagall liked to read and had her own private collection at hand in her chambers.
“Time to go home.” Lucius Malfoy must have really been touch starved, because he took Draco's hand as if the latter was a ten-year-old. It was his mother though, who with a sharp jerk of her head towards the crowd that washed around Potter, stated: “We need to say goodbye.”
The first few weeks after Harry had come back had been wild. Still waking up confused sometimes, needing a moment to sort their memories, had been just a small part of it. People had been writing, Floo calling or (if they knew how) dropping by. There had been an endless coming and going. There had been a lot of hugs and tears for Harry and a lot of claps on the back for Draco.
Winking reassuringly at his face in the mirror, Harry couldn't help but be amused by the assortment of skin products, badges (S.P.E.W. and... was that the POTTER STINKS badge from fourth year?) and, even in here, random pottery.
The address of the farmer they had received from the library lady via foh-n the other day had turned out to be a thatched roofed farmhouse with a narrow courtyard surrounded by fields. There was a Carl vehicle parked next to the building. Definitely Muggle.
The problem was, Draco didn't have a name to tell. Even though there was no doubt in his mind that he had come to meet the laughing rider, Draco had no idea what to call him.
“What do you mean? We were literally just talking about the library at Hogwarts.” Weasley crinkled his nose. “Did you forget that?”
Indeed were the stairs not broad enough for them to sit any other way than stacked over one another.
Harry rolled out of bed, shaking off the remnants of the nightmare. Bad dreams still haunted him almost every night, but he had got good at taking his mind off them.
Carefully he pulled out a white rectangle: a handkerchief. How curious. He turned the soft material over in his hands and found that there was a single letter stitched into one of the corners, a capital D. What did that stand for?
“Yeah, so, this is the final time we're going to do this. For now. Let's enjoy it! Race you through this barn there?” Half was already dashing on with a head start.
“She's Huginn-Muninn today; thought and memory.” Berchthold's voice boomed through the Forest and made both Harry and Draco flinch back.
Harry leant back. Ah, so that was why. Earlier, in the heat of the moment, he'd simply taken Draco's explanation without questioning it, but later, lying restlessly awake, he's been starting to wonder. Scarhead as a nickname had made sense somehow; the fact that it had worked, if only said with enough conviction. Yet it had also been weird – why would an endearment function as a freeing, proper name? Now, a 'heart's name', that was something else. What had Draco mumbled again, looking so utterly flustered?
The silence in that moment had been palpable. “So,” Draco had cleared his throat, grasping for self-control, “you've known – or guessed –
“Ugh, fine then, do what you want. But seriously why don't you go play with that giant half-brother of Hagrid's instead, hm? He's such a cheerful chap, fun to be with, no?”
Finally, Death nodded once and Life turned to Harry: “No problem. But it would be a bit inconvenient if we had to travel to you every time you want to visit your friends at The Hunt. That's why...”
Looking between the three of them, Harry had the distinct feeling that he was missing something. “What's going on?”
“Mabel! What do we have here?” An old merman with a choker of shark fangs, a long green beard and a loin cloth that looked like having been made from eel skin approached them.
“Well, we can fill you in on all the little details later, but first let's hear from you. What was it like riding with The Hunt?” Hermione took up the thread of the conversation.
“No, he won't,” said the father softly and let a hand drop down to his daughter's where she wrapped her tiny fingers around his. “Nothing can wake her. That's the thing. The Wild Hunt as you call them, they took her soul while she was sleeping and now she doesn't wake up. Ever.”
He didn't even look when his old school rival came to stand next to him. Of course Potter had to be here. Even though it was Christmas Day and the boy wonder was supposed to be somewhere homely, surrounded by friends (and probably, adoring fans). At least today Draco had hoped to be lucky enough not to have to look at those unsightly glasses.
The amazing Mirela_Lupoaica spent her creativity, heart and free time to create this wonderful piece of art and she had the graciousness to share it with us. O.O
“Visitors from up at the castle. Look, it's Harry, last year's champion.” She pointed at Draco's head and the geezer squinted his eyes. “And this is Malfoy. They got lost down here by accident.”
When he did meet people, however, it always had a purpose. Like that time in July he had decided to visit Hogwarts to talk to the staff. Not about anything specific, just... that he still had bad dreams and he had convinced himself that the castle was a good place to find distraction, maybe even closure. After all, dissecting the hell that had been Carrow-led Hogwarts last year was something best to be done with people who had been there as well. Still, it had cost him quite some effort to gather his courage and face his former teachers. But he had done it anyway. And curiously enough the conversations that he had dreaded had turned out rather well.
. These ghost-like shades are, from what I gather, similar to portraits in their boundaries of real characterisation. Their actions, once conjured, appear to go along with the dead person's last wish or thought and have the spectre act accordingly.”
“Something entirely too loud. We need to get out of here, just in case.” She threw the Invisibility Cloak over them both.
So Teddy understood immediately. He reached his hand into the hidden inside pocket and produced– “The Marauder's Map?”
. Yeah, Harry could totally see that, with Ember having 'nasty personality' basically written all over him. He just didn't
Ron blinked, then cocked his head owlishly. “That's... actually not terrible, if not to say, pretty nice?”
However, as it turned out, he'd been calling that tiny little bird of his which came promptly to sit on his outstretched arm, hooting delightedly.
Grinning, he walked down the stairs. Boyfriend. Draco would probably have a fit if he knew that's how Harry thought of him. He'd say something along the lines of it being an uncouth term or so, surely, and suggest 'paramour' or the like. Harry snickered at the thought. As long as they were
Tilting his head up to the dark sky, Draco simply stood, listening to nearby Christmas tunes drifting from a shop:
“Er, what's going on?” Draco asked helplessly, feeling out of his element. He'd always been the leader, had always known all the details; now, he was on the outside and he felt himself flailing in deep waters, trying to reach shore.
Harry swatted irritated at the slender digit. It was better when Malfoy played, but his condescending tone sure as hell annoyed Harry. “Fine,” he growled.
“I think I've got something? Maybe?” ventured Cassius sceptically after a moment of silence during which all that had been heard had been the flapping of turning pages, their lit wands casting flickering shadows onto the shelves around them. “
“Of course not, don't be silly,” Draco snubbed and ignored Mabel's very visible eye-roll. Although she didn't contradict him.
Sort of, but that's canon. I just took the pre-existing setting and piled on: Everyone who's somewhat close is at first name base, everyone else is called by surname.
Harry blinked. Had Malfoy just been about to call him 'his Potter'? No, he must have heard it wrong.
He had been pleasantly surprised by the non-wizarding vibe of the house, in no sense how he had expected it: There were warm-coloured walls instead of dusty paintings, open doors flooding sunlight into the halls and not a single elf-head in sight (except for Kreacher's and that one was still attached to the body and very much alive, thank goodness). It didn't feel at all like a place his narky great aunt Walburga would have lived and he wondered briefly if maybe Granger and the Weasel did some redecorating during their stay here.
To this day, Draco didn't know why he hadn't shared his discovery then. Why he hadn't told them about the cloak he had found in the wardrobe of his bedroom when he had moved into Grimmauld Place. It had just felt like something private.
When he had only gone a few metres, he caught sight of a tall, antlered figure leaning on a tree trunk up ahead the road. And then he greeted Death as an old friend, and went with him gladly, and, equals, they departed this life and left the realm of the living behind them.
; I'll just order him around.” He grinned momentarily and poked little Harry with his index finger. “Everyone okay with that?”
“Oh, that's alright. We're all mad here,” offered Alice and petted her March Hare. “I'm mad. You're mad.”
In a mass of tangled arms and legs, they had, without warning, at last reached the floor, landing semi-smoothly on an old, dusty mountain of pillows littered with dried sticks and leaves.
Seeker had watched them set up this and that until his eyes had been drawn to a soft Somewhen glow in the shadows, between the trunks. There, almost out of sight, had walked a majestic, giant stag in whose wake all trees had withered. Seeker had recognized him without anyone needing to tell him: Berchthold.
I like fleshing out side characters. But mostly, I wanted to give the dead a conclusion and some growth if possible. Ember/Crabbe gets softer and learns caring. BraveHeart/Colin lets go of  his fear (of Death Eaters). Wolfe/Lavender finds love. Half/Fred gets to reconnect to his brother and Snowdrop/Hedwig can say farewell properly.
Malfoy growled deep in his throat. “We met her at the same time. You have no exclusive claim on her.”
awfully late already, isn't it?” She passed by him and left Draco standing, forlornly looking at a room full of redheaded people who had resumed their conversation from before his arrival and were now once again completely unaware of the fact that there should be a mop of black hair sitting among them.
When it finally was his turn, he puffed out his chest and was about to start with a speech he'd prepared beforehand when the wind was taken out of his sails by a two-sided hug by the bridal couple. “So good you're here.”
“Whatever you say, Malfoy.” Harry grinned broadly. There was more than one reason that the Sorting Hat had tried to stick him into Slytherin. Harry took it as a win, in any case: Malfoy had (somewhat) admitted to liking Mabel, despite her blood status.
They had been at it for hours and none of the park visitors got it. Sure, some pointed at Anguis and some even screamed, but no one looked hard enough to understand the motion patterns as means of communication.
Well, she and The Hunt had stolen Harry alright. He frowned. Something about all this was tingling in the back of his mind. The information was only partly new and yet, somehow, Draco's research cast a new light on the things Harry had learned while riding with The Hunt.
Summer was in full swing and the July sun was beating down through the open window when the newly-weds came back from their honeymoon in the Seychelles and showered Draco with souvenirs and stories in his private library. It was a bit of a surprise as it was Tuesday, not Wednesday. Therefore they found Draco dressed rather casual, lying flat on his stomach with the Potter-glasses on top of his head. Embarrassing.
Something very nasty worked in Parkinson's face and made her hard features even harder. “How do you even know that? You could have just made that up.”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Always, never. Those words are hardly helpful in a discussion, don't you know that? But alright, maybe it'll be good to have you with me.” His eyes darkened. “To remind me where I want to return to.”
, represented by their things and order, to fit so seamlessly in this shared space. It was as if it had been meant to be that way: posh French cuisine recipes next to Aunt Petunia's old cookbook; perfect chaos, perfect harmony.
help I need.” Draco's inner Slytherin had kicked in and apparently the flattery helped, as Sir Nicholas twisted his moustache and nodded slowly.
They had not made it easy for the Chosen One, prodding him with questions and making him swear up and down to treat Draco well. It had been quite sweet, if Draco was honest (though he'd never say that out loud), to see his friends' protectiveness and his boyfriend's steadfastness.
“Well, if you're certain...” When Draco's fingers touched the wooden surface it felt welcoming like the warmth of his mother's hug after their long separation.
infatuation? If Potter had been going to make fun of it, he would have done it already, so Draco had nothing to worry about. Yeah, and if Potter felt he needed to be courteous for being rescued, well, Draco would not have to endure that for long, after all...
The window quivered and flashed a few times back and forth between transparent and non-transparent, then it went dark again.
“But now Greg, yeah? He just has to sign, the rest is taken care of,” Nott pleaded, leaning closer to Draco which brought out their height difference. Nott had to be really worried to talk so much in one day.
Draco shook his head. Potter was everywhere these days. But boy, had he been a clueless little wimp that first day they had met. Draco grinned. Good old times.
Potter hummed noncommittally and proceeded in trailing a line of feather-light kisses up Draco's jaw, towards his neck.
As Harry had been watching, Holle had fluttered next to Berchthold. She looked even tinier next to the huge ghost rider.
Now, he went to stand next to the winner of the latest Quidditch World Cup qualifying match and handed him his own cup of freshly brewed tea. “I know. I heard it on the wireless. Congrats.”
It was no use. Harry couldn't fall asleep tonight with everything running circles in his mind and with temptation lying right there at his fingertips. Maybe he should rouse Draco for another round of kissing...
Sure, he could have tried to break out of the formation, steer his horse away from The Hunt, but the truth was, flying with his new friends had touched something inside him, something he wasn't ready to leave behind yet. Not if the alternative would be a life he didn't remember and that he might have wanted to run away from.
Well, there are some months between. In the beginning Draco can't cook, but when Harry finally comes back, he's learnt. He's not too bad a chef.
“Shut up, Potter,” said the other Harry and Malfoy in unison, the former gently, the latter with a snap in his voice.
Ember squirmed and sputtered, getting buried under a flood of name suggestions. Finally, he muttered, so quietly, they almost missed it: “Dreamer.”
Hermione blinked disbelieving at the signed parchment thrust at her by a pouting Parkinson, then she composed herself. After all, they had two boys to rescue(?). “That's right.”
“Of course,” Draco acquiesced at once, assuming his business face. “Right then. Listen up, Fallen Four,” Harry arched an eyebrow at that name, but found it quite fitting, “we came here not only to give Harry the chance to properly say goodbye for now, but mostly for...” Draco looked at Harry.
Draco tore at his hair and was about to spiral into a full-blown meltdown when there was a sharp rapping on the front door.
Granger watched him thoughtfully for a moment. “When Voldemort,” (Draco flinched.) “took over, I put a spell on my parents, remodelling their memories so that they would forget me and emigrate to Australia. I wanted to keep them safe from persecution. Still, even though I reverted the effect, they sometimes lapse back into their fake identities, so I've been reading up on memory magic. That is why I recognised the signs.”
