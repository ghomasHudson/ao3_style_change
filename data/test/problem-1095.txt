Malfoy rolled his eyes.“Yes, because
Potter?” Harry shifted, so he was sitting on the railing with his legs dangling down.
What are you doing?” His second leg followed.
“What will people say? If they knew I even thought this, let alone…”
“Of course, I know nothing about life being shit, and you know everything, right?”
“But oh, saint Potter, is just
“What are you doing in here?”
’ soft glow sent a rush of warmth through Harry, but he continued to look at the blond with suspicion. Malfoy made an exaggerated sigh.
“What makes you so special?”
“I’m fine,” Harry looked through Malfoy rather than at him.
“Harry?” Harry snapped his eyes open. His name was unfamiliar in that tone, that voice. “What are you... Are you... Shit.”
“It’s chucking it down.”
He hadn’t meant to fall asleep, but when he opened his bleary eyes to a semi-illuminated Malfoy, he realised his error.
“If there is one thing I learned from my parents, it’s that love doesn’t care what you are, it doesn’t discriminate. Sometimes it just is. Sinners and saints alike.”
“‘M not the Great and Good. ‘M just Harry.”
“I love you,” Draco whispered.
“If I remember rightly, you were one of them.”
The ethereal aura that the school always held had been shattered. The castle was repaired, but in Harry’s mind, he could still see rubble everywhere, decorated with the bodies of those too young to be at war. Too young to be gone.
Malfoy was hunched over with his finger tapping at the table. He had left a subtle but significant gap between himself and his friends. An anxious hand kept reaching up and down as if trying desperately to say or do something, but always failing to at the last moment. Harry watched with bland fascination at the single claps Malfoy gave the new Slytherins, the tension rippling through his shoulders. Finally, Malfoy’s hand came to rest on the back of his slender neck that seemed to strain with the weight of his head on top of it.
the important part of this conversation.”
sitting on the railing. I’m sure if something happens then Granger and the Weasel would make it my fault,”
“Harry!” Draco shouted when he was pulled out into the street behind the shorter man. “Move it,” They ran to the nearby shop and ducked under the canopy. It was barely a shelter from the torrential rain, but it was a shelter.
was meant to be painless,” Draco whispered. “You should’ve died,” he managed to force out after a long silence.
“No. I’ll see you at dinner?”
He wandered down to the Quidditch pitch. Like the castle, the pitch was no longer a place of joy or wonder. It wasn’t that same place he had finally felt good for something. The scorched grass had been cleared; repaired or replaced with some spell he didn’t know. House banners covered the stadium once again in seas of red, green, yellow, and blue and he walked transfixed by the way the silver of Slytherin swam in the wind and reflected the light of the full moon.
“Is everything alright, Harry?” Hermione peered over the top of her book.
“Want some company, mate?” Ron asked.
“The history of our school will never be forgotten. With heavy hearts, we mourn…”
the voice hissed,
“Oh good, you’re not dead,” Malfoy was sitting across from Harry with one knee pulled up to his chest and his other leg retreating from where it had just been tapping Harry’s leg.
He was already broken.
“What do you want?”
“You’re not a sinner,” Harry scrubbed a hand over his face, “and I’m certainly no saint.”
As McGonagall made her speech, Harry let his eyes roam. There were so many missing friends and faces. Harry longed for anything to replace the crippling sickness that gripped his stomach and turned it over and over. He hadn’t meant to seek out the blond he knew would be sitting across the hall, but he did it anyway.
Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry and snatched up his wand. “Enjoy your hypothermia, Potter.”
“I came to plot some stars,” Malfoy’s voice seemed oddly calm to Harry, but he didn’t pay too much attention to it.
“Yeah,” Draco agreed. Harry nodded. He stared at the scars, his eyes ever so slightly widened as tears started to gather. He wondered if the Wizarding World would celebrate their saviour’s history if they knew that this was a part of it.
Harry ducked into a passageway, letting the wall close behind him. He sagged against the cool brick, and let himself fall to the floor. All of his energy seemed to drain from him in that very moment because he no longer wanted to go outside. The dread kept creeping in. It’s spindly talons dug into his brain with a vice-like grip and wouldn’t let go. Every time he tried to take a step forward, the claws would violently rip him back to the war. Back to the tent and the battles and the lives lost. He couldn’t move on.
Harry tipped forward. It wasn’t far enough to fall but far enough to feel like he could, and that was enough for now. He could control it.
“Alright,” Ron conceded.
The Feast lasted longer than Harry remembered. His leg bounced under the table as he waited for the moment he could leave. At the end of the Feast, he slipped away from Hermione’s concerned and guiding hand and headed out of the closet door.
Returning to Hogwarts didn’t feel the same. Harry didn’t know why he had expected it to. Everything had changed.
“I asked you first,” Harry glared.
“You think life is all sunshine and happiness. Everyone adores you, of course, you think that. From the moment you stepped through those doors when we were eleven you had people just begging to fawn at your feet-“
“Bye, Harry,” Hermione gave him a small smile before pulling Ron up the stairs after her.
“God, you’re a prick! Why can’t you just be nice?” Harry saw Malfoy recoil as if he had just been slapped. Harry’s stomach plummeted.
It was that knowledge that kept driving him up to the Astronomy Tower almost nightly. Standing at the edge, leaning out over the railing, he could gain some perspective. He could see the world a little differently. He was reminded of his first time riding Buckbeak and the untempered freedom he had felt. Height had always offered him catharsis.
“No, I suppose he hasn’t…” and that was the end of it.
Halfway into the journey, a knock forces Draco to uncurl himself from the corner seat. Potter gives him a sheepish wave from the other side of the door. “Can I come in?”
"Not with all that inbreeding, certainly," Draco said. "Even I can't get in half the time!"
It was Mr Weasley. An expression of terror was etched onto his red face. "Ron, Harry," he said, voice shaky, "Hermione. Are you all right?"
He doesn’t get a chance to speak with Potter until lunch. He spent the morning in Transfiguration with McGonagall, and then wasted another hour in DADA, which Gilderoy Lockhart is now for some reason teaching. The man is a complete buffoon! He made them all do a ridiculous quiz about his
Finally they clamber upward into the girl’s bathroom. A ghost is waiting nearby, but Draco pointedly ignores it in favour of asking: “So, what actually just happened? My brain still feels fuzzy.”
It’s only a few minutes later that Draco is leaving Madam Malkin’s himself. His mother comes to collect him, a stack of textbooks in her hands, and a promise of buying Draco’s wand on her lips. They head to Ollivander’s together, Draco’s stomach flipping with nerves. He’s wondered about the sort of wand he’ll get since before he was in the double-digits, and whether it’d be like his mother’s Hawthorn or his father’s Elm one. Perhaps it would be entirely different but still perfectly elegant.
"Just Luna."
"What? No. I wasn't at Hogsmeade," Draco blurted. He clapped a hand over his mouth when he realised his mistake.
to be placed at the tallest point in the castle, on top of everything else. What would happen if he fell out the window? He would fall, and fall, and fall… before never falling again. That wouldn’t ever happen in the dungeons. In fact, there probably isn’t a window down there at all. Perfectly safe.
"Then give it back to me," Draco snaps. He reac for Potter's bag and rips it open. Things flew from it, "Give it back, give it back, give it back."
With a click of Dumbledore's fingers, food appeared on the four tables. Draco wasted no time in grabbing himself a plate of roast beef and mashed potato. When the main course was cleared, the castle served them ice-cream, various pies, and a couple of chocolate-looking things that he quickly took. Once he'd finished stuffing himself, Boot started blabbering on about the fourth-year curriculum.
Malfoy is still there, looking out the empty window into the night. Harry marches towards him, barely slowing down, almost colliding with him before Malfoy turns around. He doesn’t have time to form a question, or even an expression, before Harry is kissing him. It’s short, but fierce, with a flash of pain as Malfoy’s tooth cuts into his bottom lip.
Harry grips his glass tightly. “You could say that.”
“So you’ve been to see him,” says Hermione.
At long last, Draco moves away. He stands, stripping carelessly, paying no mind to where his expensive clothes fall. His cock sways, looking painfully swollen. He climbs back over Harry, kneeling between his legs, and lifts Harry up by the arse. To take some of the weight off his shoulders Harry wraps his legs around him, locking his heels together at the small of Draco’s back, the muscles in his stomach clenching.
A sound he didn’t know he could make slips past the lip he’s biting. He freezes, and then he melts. Malfoy rubs his palm up and down his back, and Harry wishes he could feel him on his skin. It’s only then he realises they’re both still dressed.
. Draco smirks, and lowers them down until he’s stretched out over him, pressing him into the mattress.
He nods, running his hands up and down Draco’s lapels. “Yeah, we can’t disappoint the room. It hasn’t seen any action in ages, it was probably really sad when we left last time.”
Judging from the numbers, he’s not the last one to arrive, but he’s not far from it. He can already spot the bright red of Weasley and Ginerva’s hair, Goldstein between them and engaging them in an impassioned debate about Quidditch from the looks of things. Granger has her head bent close to Millicent’s, and Blaise and Longbottom seem equally engrossed. Bones and Patil are at the bar, and Potter looks bored when Draco spots him, sitting opposite Luna as he endures the rambling attentions of Finch-Fletchley. Luna isn’t paying attention either, she seems to be smiling absently as she scans over her classmates. Likely assessing their auras or some such thing.
Harry sets it to one side, and continues shuffling. He’s not sure when it’s supposed to be finished, the book said he was supposed to just feel it, but he doesn’t. Now is as a good a time as any, so he lays the deck face down on the table. It’s a specific question, and he’s not ready to try a full spread, so he uses a trick Granny has shown him. He draws every card, pausing just long enough to glance over them, until he finds The Lovers. Once he does, the illustrated couple moving to kiss each other, he takes the card before it and the card after. He lays them out in front of him. The Star, and The Ace of Cups. The card he dropped was Death.
Slightly disturbed, Harry walks in. There is no bell, and the door closes softly behind him, but a voice calls “Just a minute!” from another room.
“You mean my viscous Hippogriff attack?”
Draco smiles. This is exactly what they need.
“I was surprised you came back, after leaving in such a strop last night. I thought you might be setting fire to the bed, you know, to eliminate the evidence.”
First thing first, he needs to see Harry. There’s no way he’s taking this well, and there’s a good chance this could be the end of everything. He thought Harry would just eventually get tired of him, but maybe that was it, maybe that night was the last time he’ll get to kiss Harry Potter.
Hermione scoffs again, louder this time.
He settles Potter on the bed, and undresses. Having sex in his clothes is all fun and games until he has to deal with being hot and uncomfortable afterwards. Too tired to fetch a flannel, he casts basic cleaning charms over their bodies. Potter stretches on the bed, rubbing his legs against the soft sheets like a cricket. It’s painfully charming, and Draco can’t resist lying down next to him.
Potter makes a grunt of disbelief.
over the new room. Where Malfoy Manor’s wards had given off heat, the Black’s wards are coated in a fine layer of frost. Instead of the twining pipes and sprawling machinery, the objects inside look sharp. Like teeth. Where Draco’s wards had been cobbled together from different metals, everything in here is made from black volcanic glass.
“No, not today. We can try again, but just not now.”
Draco talks about the renovation he’s being doing to the Manor, but Harry is only half listening. Part of him is wondering how to explain his request, and the other is just watching his long fingers as they move through the air. Harry gets on well enough by nodding along, and making small comments, then Draco begins to lead him towards a part of the Manor he’s never seen before. Down yet another set of stairs, these even narrower and timeworn than the last, is a small room. It looks like the engine room of a ship, if that ship had been built by mad space pirates. The walls and floor are earthen, but small pipes of every metal spread and interlock across them like a lace cage. Snaking along the floor, the pipes feed into a contraption in the middle of the room. It has wheels and knobs and cylinders, and none of them seem to belong to the same machine. Glowing from within, is a soft yellow light. It hums, and the energy coming from it makes the small room hot.
The doors are fully repaired, and even now Harry has to stop and admire them again. Dancers made from rosewood inlays waltz in circles, so animated he can almost hear the rustle of swirling gowns. He opens the heavy doors, ushers Draco through, and shuts the doors behind them. Immediately, he pushes Draco back against them.
Malfoy’s mouth forms a curve, too thoughtful to be called a smile. “I’m not a fan of sadomasochism, so if you want to fight, I’d prefer to finish fucking first.”
Earl flops onto his back, hoping for a belly-rub, somewhat undermining her serious tone.
“And when would you be available?” Herbert calls after him.
“Granny?” he calls.
“Yes, that’s my good boy,” rumbles Draco, voice deep enough that Harry can feel the vibrations in his mouth. “My sweet darling.”
Draco uncrosses his legs, marks his place with a slip of paper that looks like a list of potions ingredients, and balances his book on the arm of the chair. “Come here, then.”
“I went back to that leather bar, hoping to find them again, to say thank you when I wasn’t hungover and hating myself. That’s when I started to learn more about the kink scene. Anyway, to get to the point, sometimes after or even during a scene, you can drop. You’re all high one minute and then it feels like the world is ending.”
The approval moves through his blood like honey as Draco leans down to kiss him. The caress of his tongue on the roof of Harry’s mouth is a sharp contrast to the hands that clamp down on his hips, threatening bruises. Draco grabs his wand and casts the usual spells, nipping and sucking at Harry’s lips all the while. He moves away, tugging at Harry’s bottom lip with his teeth as he goes. His own are shiny with spit, and Harry strains his neck to try and chase him. Draco has no mercy, and only shuffles back, parting Harry’s legs to make room for him to lie between them. Instead of putting his fingers where Harry expects him to, he ducks his head down, bypassing his aching dick to lick his hole.
“Now I can only speculate about that,” says Granny. “But I’d like to hear your side of things before I do.”
Somewhere in the year since the war ended, Harry had forgotten how to be brave. Courage was one of the things he’d defined himself by, at one time. He was a Gryffindor, and so he was brave. In the only months of his life where there’s been nothing to fight for, nothing to struggle against, he’s gotten out of the habit. Like an unused muscle. It’s time to get it back.
Samuel interjects, reminding Harry of his presence once again. “Why would he be embarrassed about that? Any man in his right mind would want to fuck you.”

He thrusts up, frantic, losing control. “Just say it, Potter. Please.”
“Alright, I’ll leave you to it then. See you Saturday.”
Harry hums. “Maybe you should try something else. Is there another memory you can think of?”
“Well, you better go and tell him how you feel,” suggests Granny, after Harry tells her what he’s read.
and says “I know I made it sound simple before, but after you left, I was thinking about what you told me about going away sometimes. How will I know if it happens?”
Hermione forces a slightly crazed looking smile. “Hello Mrs Malfoy. It’s… good to see you.”
“I can’t believe I forgot!” hisses Granger.
“But where would I find someone who I both trust and don’t care about?” he wonders. “And we don’t even know if it would work.”
Harry wakes to an empty bed and a pointy finger poking his cheek. “Wake up, Potter. It’s time for breakfast.”
“She does, but I think she’s hiding. She says she’s spending most of her time with you, but I don’t think she wants you to see her.”
Draco soon discovered something that disturbed him; he was bored. Currently, Draco didn’t have a job so much as a lucrative hobby. He developed cosmetic potions. It had started in fifth year, when he’d modified a bottle of Sleekeazy’s to stop it turning the hair greasy afterwards, and given it to Pansy for her birthday. Pansy had demanded more and more convoluted concoctions ever since, and he’d gotten rather good at it. Then, when Pansy received compliments on her makeup, her hair, her perfume, she naturally sent people his way. All in all, he’d hardly needed to touch the family vaults since he bought the cottage.
“They’re not bad,” says Malfoy, shifting in his seat.
Malfoy painted a look of false innocence on his face. “Like what? Todger? Johnson? Trouser snake?”
“All of those are very good points, Draco,” said Harry. “Fine, tell Scorpius and Teddy that I will see all of you guys tomorrow. It’s not as if I have anything better to do. What time are you guys going to be heading out to London?”
“How do you know so much about the Weasleys Blaise?” asked Draco suspiciously.”
“Oh, I am so glad you asked our emboldened investor, Fred here has a crush and he’s a snake too,” grinned George. “You know that Angelina and I are basically an old married couple by now.”
“Oh, we are just lovely Draco. Andy and I were just discussing the apparent return of Harry Potter. He apparently has come back to England while he is awaiting his next assignment.”
Chapter 6
Taking care of his business in the Alley didn’t take as long as he had expected and it wasn’t quite lunchtime, so Harry decided on a leisurely stroll to pass the time until after the lunch rush, thinking of stopping in Fred and George’s shoppe and catching up. It had been quite some time since he had seen most of the Weasley’s because of traveling.
“Well, you wouldn’t, you have never been a person to go looking for the answer to your own plights,” said Kreacher.
Harry contemplated for a moment, “I know that we are not going to be able to do as we did before, we live very different lives now, especially you with Scorpius, but I have thought about making a semblance of a semi-permanent move back to England. I haven’t been home all that much, and Ron and Hermione’s children are getting older, and I feel I haven’t been the best god parent to them. Being gone all this time, has kept me from really bonding with them. They know me as the wayward uncle that comes home only two or three times a year. Like Charlie Weasley, the forever bachelor that lives for their work, and like Bill before he met Fleur. Even Fred is starting to think about settling down.”
“Well partially for the anonymity, but Astoria suffered from a blood curse, that is what ultimately killed her. The other part of it was that we never actually consummated our marriage. Before I could marry her, I told Astoria everything. I told her about our relationship, our time spent in Egypt. I told her everything, I apologized to her. In the end though, she understood. She knew that my heart wasn’t hers. However, she reassured me that she was being just as selfish. She said that she wanted to have a child. She knew that her chances of reaching 40 were slim. And she wanted a child to pass some of her legacy on, even if she wouldn’t be able to be there for it. She was amazing, even though I didn’t love her as I should have, as I love you, she was my best friend. She probably knew me better than even Blaise. Maybe not you.”
“Do you really think that this is the best place to have this conversation?” mumbled Harry, taking too much interest in his turkey sandwich.
“Oh, just Cissa. She’s been around quite a bit since that husband of hers died. She’s visiting with Andy and the children.”
Suddenly as Harry was turning around, he found himself knocked backwards by the force of a six-year-old Teddy Lupin crashing into him and grabbing him around the middle. “Hey, Teddy how are you little man?”
“Help yourself, what’s wrong mate? You rarely drink, and where is Scorpius?” asked Blaise, officially concerned. After the amount of alcohol that Lucius Malfoy drank during his life, turning him into a cruel and mean man, Draco had a strict rule against having alcohol in his home.
“Being your friend hasn’t ever been the problem, well at least since Egypt, its been being around you hurt to even think about. Knowing that I couldn’t have you anymore, not all of you. I had though that you were gone. And then when I heard about Astoria, I didn’t think it would be okay to just show up unannounced while you and Scorpius were mourning her. Then time just ran away from me. I ran and ran, taking job after job, and buried myself in my work. It worked for me at the time. I am sorry that you lost her. I am sorry that I didn’t let you explain yourself. I am also sorry that I didn’t trust you, that I thought the worst of you, thinking that you could do that, abandon me like that. I guess I have always been afraid of being abandoned. My parents died, Sirius died, Remus, Tonks, Ron left Hermione and I in the middle of the fucking forest while we were searching for the Horcruxes. For a long while, I just saw myself as someone that got left. Those were things that I had to work out for myself.”
“What a picture you make,” he says, rocking in and out of Potter’s mouth.
“Alright, darling?”
“Narcissa. I heard she died recently.”
Harry twirled the pen in his fingers. There was very little he could say.
“Tell me what you were thinking, Harry. Did you imagine us fucking in front of the mirrors, so we could see what a mess we’d make of ourselves?”
Here's that second half! No extra warnings for this chapter.
Harry lets that sink in for a moment, before something occurs to him. “Does that mean Moaning Myrtle can finally leave the girl’s bathroom?”
The cat reappears, stepping delicately out of her back like nothing’s happened. She falls forward, catching herself on her hands, before her arms give out under the weight. Shaking his head, he tries to think. Draco and Granny need a healer. Fast.
“You’re quite welcome, dear. Off you go, now.”
Weasley crosses his arms tightly. “Why are you sleeping with Harry?”
Granny chuckles. “Down the hatch, duckie. It may taste terrible, but if you want to know where this dream is leading you, this is just the thing.”
Simi gasps. “Is your last name Potter, by any chance?”
Weasley leans forwards, his elbows on his knees and his hands clasped under his chin. He doesn’t start right away, as if unsure what to ask first.
Terran makes sure his displeasure is audible when he says “Fine, we can just do this.”
“Yes, I do,” answers Draco, blinking rapidly in disbelief. He turns to Harry. “Now are you going to tell me why I’m here, or am I supposed to see it in the crystal ball?”
Harry moans. “What do you say?”
He asked Ginny about him, and subtle as ever, she yelled across the room to ask Terran if he liked blokes. Terran had only laughed, walked over to where they were standing, and told Ginny that if she didn’t know he was gay before then she was certainly about to. Then he kissed him. Square on the lips. Not long, but firm, with his hand on Harry’s jaw. A peck on the lips, but not the kind you’d give your aunt. Unless you were fucked up, of course. Harry was stunned, his face was red, and his stream-of-consciousness was babbling.
Granny opens her mouth to question him, but at the same time the shop door bursts open, once again clanging into the fallen bell.
He floos to Grimmauld Place, not stopping to firecall or send an owl first. Immediately, he hears raised voices. There’s no one in the living room he’s tumbled into, so he follows the sounds to the kitchen. Terran Jones has Harry backed up against the countertop, gripping his wrists in large hands. Harry’s still in his pyjamas, hair a dark maelstrom about his face, looking both soft and fierce at once.
“Lord, but I love you,” moans Draco, and Harry comes.
’ Does that mean it could signal the beginning of a relationship?
“Not like that, Harry. It just means they’re drawn to you. It’s like the ghost and the place they died are a pair of magnets, and they’re stuck together- but you’re a magnet too. The ghost is equally pulled between you and wherever they died, and now they’re completely untethered. Clearly some of them would rather follow you than stay where they’ve been stuck for centuries.”
Harry dissociates during sex and when he comes around his boyfriend is fingering him.
Harry sighs in relief, and pulls his own t-shirt off from where he’s lying diagonally across the rumpled sheets. Terran pulls his trousers the rest of the way off, and peels his socks off one at a time. Rubbing his hands up and down Harry’s thighs, he whispers something to himself that’s sounds a little like
“Did you ever take Muggle Studies at Hogwarts?” he begins.
Draco eventually admits that he’s done as much as he can for today, and they make their way back to the kitchen. Harry rummages through the snack draw and pulls out a half-eaten bar of chocolate. Lupin always gave it to him when teaching Harry to cast a Patronus, and though there were no dementors here, he’s sure it can’t hurt.
Draco’s bathroom manages to be both cluttered and orderly. Every shelf seems to host a wide array of gels and potions and creams, all spaced a centimetre apart, labels facing outwards. How long does it take him to get up in the morning? Still, whatever he does, it works for him. Hair shiny yet soft, skin clear, and always smelling dark and sweet. Like burnt sugar. Harry supposes some people would describe Draco as feminine. The way he dresses, the way he moves his hands. Still, there is a power behind his pretty façade, a confidence that doesn’t rely on proving he’s a man.
After she leaves, he chucks two thirds of the mug’s contents into a plant. It shakes its spiny leaves as if shuddering. Luna is followed down the stairs by Ginny, dressed comfortably and wearing…slippers? The moment she sees him she stops, pausing on the bottom step.
Harry’s heart sank. It seemed his imagination had not only run away from him, but also lead him into disappointment.
“I don’t know why I’m the one who’s embarrassed,” says Harry. “It’s
“Yes,” says Draco, resigned to being asked numerous permutations of the same question until Weasley runs out of ways to phrase it.
She nods. “Don’t worry about the watch. I’m just glad everyone’s alright.” She turns stern eyebrows onto the young woman. “Including my niece.”
A gravelly voice, slightly tinny as it filters through the phone, fills the room. “This was supposed to be a quick call, but now I’m tempted to drag it out.”
He nods, but still isn’t ready to speak.
Harry nods with an apologetic grin.
“No, Potter. I know you think I’m a heartless bastard, but even I wouldn’t just leave you in that state.”
“I’m in love with him.”
He starts pouring the drink. Samuel hasn’t moved, so now that Harry’s facing the other way, Samuel is right behind him. There really isn’t much room in this little kitchen. It’s more of a kitchenette, now that he thinks about it.
Potter hums around the thumb in his mouth, still not opening his eyes.
“I don’t know. I don’t know what to do.”
“What are we doing here?” wonders Draco.
A small piece of the jigsaw that makes Draco Malfoy slots into place. He had the corners, and now he has the edges that make up his life. The pressure to be the best, to be perfect, resulting in him putting other children down. As if by making others feel lesser, that would make him feel better about himself. Parroting his father’s rhetoric, the words of a man he trusted, trying to be a perfect copy. Not that it worked, in the end.
“We were just telling Harry about Draco’s younger days,” says Tabby, before turning back to him. “He was a mess.”
Granny thuds three mugs of tea and one cup of coffee onto the table, like a judge with a gavel. Harry watches curiously as Draco reaches for the lone coffee cup. Earl winds round his ankles like a cat, before hopping onto his lip.
“I’ll chop your liver in a minute.”
He pulls Harry back in by the back of his neck, his hands becoming more demanding at the same time that he forces his mouth to be tender. The kiss turns languid as he guides them down from the giddy height of their confessions and back onto solid ground. Draco sits up straighter, pushing back against Harry until they’re balanced against each other like a house of cards.
The warm covers are ripped away, and the cold air startles Harry into wakefulness. He rolls over from his position on his stomach, and stares at the ghost stood over his bed. “Since when have you been able to do that?”
Malfoy finds him in the afternoon, repairing wooden beams in the attic. These weren’t damaged during the war, just neglected, but they were important enough structurally that he doesn’t want to leave them too long. He’s standing on a folding ladder, when a voice startles him.
Watching the scene unfold, Draco wants to vomit a little. To see another man with Potter, with his mouth on him, makes him so jealous it blinds him for a moment. Then he breaths, and looks, and he wants to be sick again. Potter looks so nervous, his fingers twisting in the sheets, his expression unsure. The blonde man moves his mouth off him, says something, and suddenly Draco recognises him. Star Quidditch player Terran Jones, Potter’s ex-boyfriend.
“That is not why. I just don’t trust people who say they can do stuff that no one else can. If telling the future is possible, then why isn’t everyone doing it?”
“Then will you fuck me? I don’t need to come, I just- I just need-”
, but he knows Potter would react badly, and push him away. As much as Draco wants to stay for his own sake, he also thinks that Potter might need someone right now. He’s just had a pretty major panic attack, or flashback, or whatever it was. If Potter kicked him out, he very much doubts he’d call someone else to help. He’d probably just stew by himself.
“Hello, gorgeous,” he says, running his fingers down the tawny feathers of her back. She rolls her head, preening, but her leg is conspicuously bare. “No letter for me today?”
The funeral is predictably bleak. A handful of people gather in the mausoleum, in a circle around her obsidian coffin. It’s strange to think her body is inside, when Harry had listened to her teasing and complaining just that morning. The service is short, and no one makes a speech, but a few people leave flowers. Malfoy clutches a bouquet of daffodils to his chest, before laying them on the casket. Their bright yellow colour and common nature seem incongruous with their family’s love of all things monochrome and elegant, but he supposes they must have some personal significance. He’d ask Narcissa, if he didn’t think she’d object to such a personal question. She’d probably walk through him. Harry shudders thinking about it.
“Okay, I am still unsure if this is a good idea, but I will try to put on a good front for the children, they don’t need to know that anything untoward is wrong with us. See you tomorrow Draco.”

“There is no need for you to be so blunt with him Cissa,” said Andromeda sharply. “You know that Draco wouldn’t appreciate you butting into what he claims to be his business.”
“You would think that would have forced Binns to retire years ago. He was falling asleep in the middle of class when I was still attending Hogwarts,” remarked Narcissa.
“Kreacher be thinking that you should go take a walk after dinner, being a little more active may bring some clarity to whatever is on your mind.”
“Draco, mate, what an unexpected surprise.”
“I understand, I will still owl you,” Harry reached out and hugged the other man, reveling in the feel of him again. “I have missed you; I know my hostility hasn’t really shown it but I did, every day. You can use my floo.”
Draco left his son’s room and took a shower himself. Ridding himself of the day and trying to relax. It had been a long day, between a half a dozen business meetings for Malfoy Enterprises. Draco took his time, but enjoyed the moment in which his head hit his pillow, falling asleep almost immediately.
“Well yes, but how about we start with dinner at my house tomorrow? I’ll cook and we can just talk. Catch up if you will. Let’s start with that before we decide to take weekend international getaways,” chuckled Harry.
“Oh,” was all Draco could get out before he heard Scorpius’ cry across the yard, “PAPA!”
he thought darkly as he ascended the stairs.
“Aw, Freddie don’t be like that! You know we tease you because we care. It’s the Weasley way!” jeered George.
With a quick and panicked decision Harry apparated quickly back to Grimmauld Place with little thought of the possibility of splinching himself. Arriving in the entrance hall of Number 12, Harry quickly threw his purchase in the chair of the living room and went to the bar against the fireplace wall and poured himself a hefty amount of firewhiskey in a tumbler, gulping it down in quick succession. Harry knew that whenever he came back to England there always was a chance of running into his former...

“Oh, Draco just use the floo. The address is Number 12 Grimmauld Place.”
“Okay, I can deal with that, and you’re right, you do need to know Scorpius. He is my son and I love him,” replied Draco. “When should we go out first? I should also think that it might be pertinent that we make any outings we have for the near and foreseeable future to be in the muggle world, and maybe international. You have been out of the public eye for so long that I can’t imagine that their fascination of you has lessened any over the years.”
“Otay, Papa,” said Scorpius as his tiny chubby hands gripped onto Draco’s grey button-down shirt.
“I’m so happy that you came with us.”
“Well, my son is stubborn, there isn’t any doubt about that. An awful trait he unfortunately got from his father. His pride too. Draco has spent a long time alone. And if he had it his way, he would spend the rest of his life pining after the what ifs and had beens. He would wither away, and that is not something that I want for my son,” said Narcissa haughtily.
Chapter 2
“I did it was truly a pleasure. You know I went to Egypt to become a Curse-Breaker but I ended up enjoying excavation and magical archeology so much more. The ministry is in talks with the Central American governments to start on an excavation of some of the ruins from the ancient civilizations from the areas. They believe that they are connected to ancient wizarding cultures that the religious leaders of the civilizations were really Seers, that could prophesize. Which is why I had to order this book from Florish and Blotts.”
Harry shakes his head.
“Can I borrow that?” he asks, pointing at the newspaper.
“Just like you to treat a little fame like a hardship, Potter.” He rolls his eyes. “At least the beer here is decent.”
He lets himself be dragged into the wider conversation, something silly that Harry only half understands, but they seem to enjoy his lack of cultural know-how. He doesn’t mind being teased- anything to take away from the double tension of Draco wrapped around him and Samuel’s eyes boring into him. The alcohol is catching up to him, and he finds himself laughing more easily, leaning back into Draco’s warmth more freely. At one point, Draco’s thumb slips under the hem of his t-shirt and starts stroking absentmindedly at his waist.
“Honestly? I’m just glad someone’s looking out for Potter.” He shoots Weasley a sarcastic smile, painfully stretching his split lip. “Not that you’ve done a stellar job of it, considering how that shit stain of a boyfriend treated him. Did you punch him, too? Or am I just special?”
“I suppose I shouldn’t be so surprised,” says Zabini. “He did seem very emotional about it all.”
“Draco Malfoy,” he huffs. “And he says we can use Malfoy Manor as our premises, as he and his mother haven’t lived there since the war.”
Draco frowns. “You’ve nothing to be sorry for.”
The only people he’s ever called ‘sir’ are professors, ministers. Uncle Vernon. It speaks of authority, and despite his general bravery, a little bit of fear. He’s not scared of Draco, and he certainly has no sexual feelings about his uncle, so he’s not worried about that. But the idea of giving Draco that authority turns him on. He wants Draco to have power over him. Even more so, he wants him to abuse that power.
“You’re very welcome,” says Draco solemnly.
Harry leads him to the Kitchen. “You can’t start without a cup of tea.” He puts the kettle on, turning his back to Draco while he composes himself. “Granny says that there’s nothing worth doing that doesn’t start with a cup of tea.”
“I win,” he says, panting.
Harry turns away from Draco and shrugs off the robe. He hears a small noise of appreciation from behind him and steps into the shower. Looking back, he sees Draco unbuttoning his shirt. “Hurry up, I don’t know how to work all these buttons, and I don’t want a cold shower.”
“I heard that story so many times growing up,” breathes Aisling. “Grandpa would describe the watch to me, tell me how it was a family heirloom stolen by a graverobber, and that one day I would find it.”
“Ah.” Malfoy looks thrown off balance, like he didn’t expect Harry to actually tell him. “Was it about the whole…”
He whispers, scared to break out of the scene they’ve painted themselves into. “Do you want to go upstairs?”
“Thank you,” says Ron, “I think we will.”
“You’re not Hermione.”
Draco groans. “We really need to come up with a better name for it.”
Draco slips his wand out from where he keeps it secured with a charm inside his sleeve, casting the necessary spells. He doesn’t cast the one for lube yet though, instead tapping two fingers over Harry’s lips, the pretty peach nail varnish glinting in the light.
What can he say that won’t make Potter leave, like he did the first time? Although, this is Potter’s house. That means the question really is: what can he say that won’t make Potter kick him out? Any sooner than he was planning to, anyway. He won’t kid himself into thinking that Potter would want him to stay.
Harry could use some guidance. “Would you do a reading for me?”
He’s not ready. He came here to ask Granny to look into his love life, like so many of her patrons do. It seems silly, but he doesn’t want to risk anything with Draco. All his Gryffindor bravery has gone out the window, and suddenly he feels like a first year, adding up the letters in their names on a piece of parchment to see if they’re compatible.
indeed. Harry might not hate Malfoy anymore, but it’s clear that it’s not a two way street. Still, if that had been coming from a friend, it might have counted as banter. As for the business with the owl, Harry grins a sneaky grin, and begins to compose his reply.
“We talked,” shrugs Harry.
“It might,” he grumbles.
Harry grabs his hand, moving it away from his face, and kisses his knuckles. Their hands look so good together, warm and cold contrasted. Suddenly Harry wishes he could stand back, out of his body, and watch them. But then, he wouldn’t be able to look Draco in the eye, and see how full of need they are.
Draco woke to the sound of beaks tapping on a window and Potter sprawled across his chest. He rubs the sleep out of his eyes and looks in the direction of the noise; four different owls are jostling for position on the windowsill, nipping at each other viciously. Groaning, he shakes Potter’s shoulder.
“Don’t worry, Bunny. I wouldn’t really shut you out,” he says.
“What?” says Weasley, squinting with confusion.
“I prefer it, actually. Sometimes my welcome can be a little too warm.”
Draco hums, and rests his hand on Harry’s knee where it rises out of the water. “I’m not interested in hurting you Harry.”
He winds his way through the busy pub and over to the group, sitting down in the squashy booth next to Luna.
Narcissa does not move.
- smirks. He flicks his wand, and Harry’s glasses shoot into his hand. He places them carefully onto Harry’s face and chucks his wand away again. “Now, Potter. Fuck yourself on my cock.”
“Well,” says Malfoy, looking like the cat who got the cream. “Your wish is my command.”
“So,” says Blaise. “What was it like? Living as muggle, I mean.”
“Potter, wake up. There’s about a thousand blasted owls trying to peck their way through the glass.”
“You know, if there’s one thing I regret not doing at Hogwarts, it’s that I never pushed you up against a library shelf and had my wicked way with you.”
muggle
“We don’t have to do anything if you don’t want to. But, if you want to try it, we can work off of what we’ve already done. Last time I mentioned your praise kink- do you know what that means?”
“Fine then,” he says, throwing up his hands. “I’m not sorry I acted like a mad man, and shoved you, and made you sit on the floor for ages. That was all completely normal, I’ve no idea why anyone would be bothered about that!”
He’s been struggling not to call him Harry as it is. It’s probably time to accept defeat. Harry places the mug on the bedside table and lets his head loll back on Draco’s arm.
Teddy starts gurgling, and Harry pulls him onto his lap. “It’s not like you to downplay an injury. In third year you milked that scratch for all it was worth.”
“Harry,” he says, struggling to look them in the eye. This person knows exactly what he and Draco get up to. They even
She began to slurp the tea, and motioned for Harry to do the same. Bitter leaves flooded his mouth and he froze, unsure whether he should swallow them or spit them out.
Draco pulls him up from the chair so they're face to face and pushes him back against the table. Harry sucks in a breath, and Draco gently bites his bottom lip, before pulling back.
It’s probably only because Harry’s drunk that he says: “He’s actually a lot more, er... tender, than I thought he’d be.”
Harry shrugs. “Alright then.”
“Is she any good?” he asks.
Harry keeps going, building momentum. “You’re forgetting how this started. What if my head goes again, and I can’t talk, and I can’t use my safeword? A week ago I couldn’t even handle vanilla sex with my boyfriend!”
Granny laughed at him. “Just swallow them, but in the future blow on your cup every now and then and the leaves will float away from your mouth. If that doesn’t work use your teeth to filter it- it’s not elegant but it works.”
Harry doesn’t wake him, there’s nothing they can do now. So he sleeps.
“Hey, can I ride you?”
Harry clenches his fists, and wills his eyes dry. Malfoy gets closer, close enough to see the state he’s in.
Draco cups Harry’s face, his thumb resting on his cheek. “It’s not stupid.”
Malfoy’s eyes widen, and for the first time tonight he seems to be speechless. Harry comes to stand in front of where Malfoy’s sitting, and kneels. Grey eyes follow him down, and from Harry’s new position, he can see he is affected. When he undoes his trousers- buttons, instead of a muggle zip- his hands are steady. This is one of things Terran has been angling for for a while. When he looks up at Malfoy, guilt sours his mouth. It’s Malfoy’s hand gripping the back of his neck, and Malfoy he cursed in a bathroom. It’s Malfoy’s wiry thigh he’s resting his hand on, and Malfoy who broke his nose. He wants to get under his skin again, and for a minute he hadn’t thought about Terran at all.
“Does he die in your dream?”
Now he’s been acknowledged, Malfoy moves further into the room.
The bastard son-of-a-whore lies on top of Harry more fully. Didn’t he feel him flinch? Of course he did, he just cares more about getting his dick wet than the man who loves him.
He pulls them both to the ground until they’re lying in the doorway, half on the kitchen tiles and half on the wooden floorboards of the hall. Draco knocks his elbow on the floor on the way down, letting out a very un-sexy yelp.
“It’s fascinating,” says Draco, already walking inside. “My family has always been so rigid, so obsessed with appearances, and yet our wards are completely mad. The Blacks have always been unhinged, and yet these are some of the most cohesive and well-structured wards I’ve ever seen.” He looks back at Harry, eyes alight in a way he hasn’t seen in years. “Don’t touch anything unless I say it’s safe. Better yet, just don’t touch anything.”
The bird was brown, and about the length of his arm. It blinked yellow eyes at him, before rapping its beak against the glass, as if asking to be let in.
Hermione narrows her eyes shrewdly. “That’s surprisingly introspective of you, Harry. What brought that on?”
Hermione reaches out to lay a hand on his forearm. “What happened?”
“Good,” nod Granny. “And the castle?”
“Yes,” hisses Harry, pulling Draco on top of him and slotting their mouths together.
Harry huffs. Malfoy thinks he far cleverer than he is, but right then he doesn’t care. He just wants to touch him. He closes the distance between them. “Is that everything? Because I think I want to try and suck your dick.”
Draco captures his hand, and presses his knuckles to his lips. “You deserve to be taken care of Harry.”
Draco turns to leave. Harry scrambles to his feet, and grabs his wrist, pulling him round to face him. Their noses are so close he can feel their quick, hot breath between them. “I don’t pity you, Draco. Sometimes I wish I was you.”
“It sounds- it sounds good. I want it. I don’t know why, but I do.”
“She’ll be just fine,” says Granny. “Only matters of the heart.”
Draco makes sandwiches. The bread is thick and raggedly cut but they’re full of chicken, bacon, and mayonnaise. Harry groans in relief, he’d had no idea how hungry he was. Draco gives him an odd look, probably wondering how anyone could be so ill mannered even when eating a sandwich. Sauce drips out of the end of the sandwich and splats onto the polished table. Draco says nothing, but vanishes the puddle with a pointed slash of his wand. It looks like Narcissa passed her intolerance for mess and dirt onto her son.
They entered the Great Hall together. Granger sat down with him at the Ravenclaw table, as apparently, she'd gotten into a row with Weasley about their pets. Draco didn't really mind, though she'd taken to constantly correcting things in his homework, which was annoying.
“Sev?”
experience flying to join the Quidditch team. Honestly, what had they expected? It’s only the first match of the year and Potter has already gone and gotten himself injured. Then-- and this is the funny part-- he’d gone and had all the bones in his arm removed! By accident, sure, but what kind of idiot lets Lockhart cast spells anywhere near them? If Draco had been able to reach the field faster, he could’ve stopped it, but the Ravenclaw watchtower is so far away from all the action…
A little bit later, Severus arrived in the Hospital Wing with Potter and Granger floating along behind him. They were passed out.
They don’t calm down by Christmas. Draco receives a note from his mother two days before the holidays are scheduled to begin, with only a few words written on it in her elegant cursive. He’s forbidden from going home. He pretends not to cry himself to sleep that night.
"So. You have decided to study the art of Divination, although I now realise some of you—" Here, she sent a meaningful glance in Draco's direction. "have already begun to unveil the mysteries of the future. This gift is extraordinarily rare."
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco rolls his eyes, incredulous, and wanders over to the Gryffindor trio, who immediately bombarded him with questions. "Settle down, idiots," he murmured, raising a hand for silence. "I was just making him promise not to cause any drama during this whole DADA club thing. That is alright, isn't it? Talking to Slytherins isn't against the law?"
The party is in the dungeons, with a line of floating candles to guide them to the entrance. Draco links elbows with Luna and is giddy to discover the massive turnout. Ghosts surround them in every direction, from translucent soldiers to dancers that glow blue in the dark. He spots Potter on the opposite side of the room, near what appeared to be a table of rotten food.
"Suit yourself." Zabini swept off as dramatically as Snape always does.
Squeezing his eyes shut, Draco swiftly brings the wand down through the air. Immediately a cloud of white sparkles shower onto all their heads, while a lovely feeling of magic rushes down his arm.
“Well, no, why would I be? What with... the circumstances, and everything.”
“Malfoy. Or, um, Healer Malfoy?”
“Is that what you woke me for?” Luna said, rubbing at her silvery eyes. “What’s wrong, Draco?”
"Something gruesome."
Potter’s hand in Draco's loosens considerably. He’d almost forgotten it was there at all. “But--”
He’d not planned to leave his cottage today, but for Helga, he would. With this new plan, Draco rushed back to the bedroom and grabbed some Galleons he kept hidden in a pouch under a loose floorboard. He picks up a travelling cloak too, in case it gets any colder. Helga watched with her usual piercing gaze, following Draco to the front door.
A flying car.
“Yes, but he doesn’t know we know who he is,” Potter explains gently. Then he turns back to Hermione. “See? Draco won’t tell.”
Dog? Guarding? On second thoughts, this is getting interesting. Draco wishes he had some popcorn.
creatures…”
Draco would love to hit him. He doesn’t. Instead, “Of course, sir.”
“No idea.” Harry drapes it across his shoulders, which leaves him a floating head. “It came with a note, though. Apparently it used to belong to my dad.”
A flash of lightning revealed the man's face. He had one real eye, and another, fake one that rolled around in his head, as if trying to get a glimpse of everything at once. A large chunk of his nose was missing.
Madam Pomfrey didn’t let him visit Potter, as the Hospital Wing was already overflowing with the entire Gryffindor team cooing over Potter by his bedside. So instead he’d been forced to retreat back to his dormitory, write a short passage in his diary, and then have a quick nap. When he woke up, it was much later, and Draco was standing dazed outside the girl’s bathroom. There weren’t any teachers around, fortunately, so Draco just rushed back to bed and pretended it never happened. He couldn’t remember ever sleepwalking before, which is a little worrying.
life. Draco privately thinks he should’ve aced it-- with every question, he’d come up increasingly more stupid answers. Like,
Weasley thumped him on the back, and Granger started crying from joy; Draco privately thought he wasn’t too far behind.
Monday came around with a chilly breeze and lots of one-sided ranting between Draco and his cat.
“Right, well,” Weasley continues. “After we found the note, McGonagall announced another student was attacked, but worse this time, ‘cause they’d been actually taken into the Chamber. Me and Harry snuck into the teacher’s office and found out the student-- you, obviously.”
They stop outside their destined shop. Lucius’ nostrils flare like they always do when Draco says something out-of-place. “I am not
Goldstein hesitated, and then said, "The Cruciatus Curse? I read about it in a book."
“That
He could've laughed. Instead, Draco rolled his eyes, and shuffled past them all with his trunk, and murmured, "I'm gonna go find Luna. You coming, Harry? Ginevra?"
“Okay,” Draco says, sluggish. It takes them a long couple of minutes, as it’s dark and Severus can’t risk using his wand without dropping Draco, but eventually they find themselves knocking at the Hospital Wing’s shut doors. Pomfrey answers quickly, half-asleep in her pyjamas. She prepares a bed for him, asks Sev a few questions, and thankfully gives him a small bottle of sleeping draught.
"Yeah. Me, too."
“Help me with Weasley,” Severus interrupted. “Where are Potter and Granger?”
Sirius Black. Draco knew him— well, not knew-knew. They were related through his mother, and Draco had a vague memory of meeting Walburga Black before she died. That woman had been as bitter as he was dramatic. All she'd talk about was her blood-traitor son who ended up in Azkaban even after all his little rebellions as a teenager.
Granger holds no such qualms, unsurprisingly. She’s squeezed into the crowd, practically drooling over the man-- Lockhart, the sign reads-- smiling prettily down at everyone. Draco glances at Lucius to find him glaring at the pack of Weasleys.
The next morning, Draco decided he'd rather die than attend the stupid therapy session. He hid under his covers until Severus sent an older Ravenclaw student to come up and drag him out of bed. He skipped breakfast and went straight down to the dungeons. The plan was for Draco to go through the Floo network, meet his mother at St Mungo's, and then spend an hour of his life with a woman who once claimed he was depressed. He'd been eight.
“Well done!” His mother cheers, satisfied. Draco blushes.
Draco’s mind, inexplicably, flashes to his diary.
Draco choked. "Did you just say
A bright green light shot into the jar, and a rushing sound whizzed through the air. The spider stopped moving at once; dead. Draco couldn't look away. That light, it had been familiar. It had occupied so many of his dreams, and now he knew why.
Sometime in March, Draco seated himself at the Gryffindor table, with no protection except for his confidence. The seventh-years, sat a couple of seats further along, paid no attention, but the rest of the house did. It became very apparent to him at that moment, that perhaps Hogwarts should put less effort into inter-school cooperation, and more into inter-house cooperation. “Nice day, isn’t it?”
He wasn't handsome, exactly. Krum, that is. He was surprisingly lean under the thick coats the Durmstrang students were wearing, and was always sporting quite a dark look on his face when Draco glanced over. Really, Draco didn't understand all the fuss. Sure, the guy was an alright flier, but so were plenty of other people. The commotion about a famous Quidditch player being at the school reminded him of first-year when people were still starstruck at seeing Harry Potter roaming the halls.
It was a few hours later when Draco popped into existence inside his home, yearning to collapse on the couch for the rest of the weekend. His stomach protested, though.
The pub is built between a Muggle book store and record shop, as always. Draco avoided using Apparition to travel there, since the last time he had he accidentally landed on a man carrying a tray of drinks, which resulted in them both sticky for days.
From there, he’s assigned several patients, most of whom are causing a horrible commotion in the reception area. Still, Draco reacted with a trained gracefulness, cycling through the normal procedures to Diagnose And Help (that was the Healer’s Code). After escorting a few wizards and witches to better-suited wards, he returned to his main office and waited for patients there.
"Um?" Zabini repeated, smirking now. "I thought the Malfoy heir would be more articulate."
Draco shrugged. "I always do. What type do you want to hear about?"
This, combined with Riddle’s mouth opening to release a snake-like hiss, is enough to wake him up.
Luna grabbed his hand and led them both over to the coaches. Draco never took his eyes of the creatures, half-afraid they would attack. "Harry? Harry, what are they?"
He reached out his hand to the drawers handle. Draco held out his wand, the counter-spell ready on his lips.
The ink fades into the paper. A pronounced frown sews itself on Draco’s face, deepening as the diary starts to write back.
They were supposed to read a book about how Muggles perceived magic, and write how it differed to the real thing. Draco had been assigned a short novel called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. It was a lot of fun, surprisingly.
Walking down the first set of stairs to the ground floor, Draco did his best to keep up with Severus' running dialogue.
“Absolutely not,” Lucius says, insistently tugging the book from his grasp. “You don’t need any more books, let alone of the dark kind. What happened to the ones your mother bought for your birthday to read, and the hundred others you’ve stolen from our library? Why the sudden interest in magical creatures at all, Draco?”
The sight of the child snapped him out of his weird, Potter-induced daze. Breathing deeply, he said, “What is the problem today, Edward?”
Draco, briefly, felt very proud of Harry. He never swore.
"Hello," he said, a touch uncomfortably. "You're acquainted with Septimus, then?"
He wondered if Potter still thought about him. Probably not. He was probably too busy living his life, being in love with someone he’d actually seen in the last four years. Someone who’d been kind to him, even once. He hoped Potter had someone who was kind to him- he doubts he ever could be.
Harry shifts guiltily. “It wasn’t actually a stranger.”
The Healer hums, and addresses Granny’s niece. “I’m going to take you in to the hospital to stay overnight.”
He seems to decide it’s not worth wasting time that could be spent kissing Harry by finishing his sentence.
Death: Endings, Change, Transformation.
. Of course, he wasn’t expecting to see Malfoy, so he hadn’t considered it. He wanted to take his mind off it, and it had clearly been effective, because he hadn’t remotely seen this coming. And why did he choose to wait until now to bring it up, if he had this arrow in his quiver? Clearly, he was right in thinking that Arthur’s presence shielded him from most of his animosity.
Harry sighs. Anxiety has always made him tense and snappish. “Look, I’m sorry. We probably both have some growing up to do. That’s what I’ve been thinking about, by the way.”
“You already said thank you,” says Draco snippily, his warm breath tickling Harry’s neck.
Warm savoury aromas drift up the stairs. So, Draco really did make breakfast. He’d better go and take a look; if he ever managed to tell Ron and Hermione about all this, this is a story they’d want to hear. He pads downstairs and into the kitchen, immediately spotting his clothes folded into a pile on the chair. The smell of good food is stronger here, and the sight of Draco standing over the hob and pushing something round a frying pan is amusing in its domesticity.
“Don’t,” he snaps, jerking his hand away.
Today isn’t his day to babysit Teddy. He hasn’t arranged to visit Andromeda beforehand, either. Nether the less, he finds himself ringing her doorbell, on the afternoon Malfoy said he’d be there. In the space of time between the chimes of the bell and the sound of footsteps approaching the door, he curses himself, his impulsiveness, and the whole Malfoy family line.
Draco snorts. “How you ever managed to stay on your broom, I don’t know.”
He strokes over Harry’s hair. “Before, when I said we couldn’t, I meant we couldn’t do it
“Come in mate,” he says, standing back to let his guest inside. That sounded normal, didn’t it? That sounded like something a friend might say. Harry winces. He’s such a bloody idiot.
Ace of Cups: Love, Compassion, Creativity.
Harry takes Teddy to avoid looking at his former rival. “I brought something that might help with his bath time, I know you said he hates it.”
“Sorry,” he says, swinging his legs out of bed and rushing to open the window. “What are you doing here, Bunny? Couldn’t you find him?”
A few people at the front look to each other, unsure who to elect as spokesperson, but a teenage girl wrestles her way to the front of the crowd. “We saw the article!” she says, brandishing a copy of today’s
Afterwards, Malfoy approaches him. His face looks paler than usual, purple bags dragging under his eyes, and mouth drawn tight. Now he has no flowers to grip onto like a lifeline his hands are shaking, and he rubs him thumb up and down the handle of his wand. He looks like his father. Not the man Harry met in his second year, who looked down his nose at him and wore his hair in a ponytail held in place with a black ribbon. He reminds him of the broken old man he’d seen after the battle, who’s hair hung in a greasy sheet, and slouched defeated. Malfoy is immaculately groomed, and standing tall, but Harry sees the resemblance all the same.
have a moment of weakness.”
Harry shrugs. Logically, he knows that’s the case, but it still doesn’t sit right in his chest. Everything’s Harry’s fault; it always has been.
Draco snorts in a truly humiliating way. Lord, but Harry is quick when he wants to be.
Hedwig. In the summer after his first year, when he was imprisoned in his room and thought his friends had forgotten him, Hedwig got him through it. With a tug on Earl’s lead, he changes their direction, and heads towards Eeylop’s Owl Emporium. It’s much the same as he remembers it- cramped, stuffy, and stinking of owl dropping. Soft hoots punctuate the air like question marks.
“Do you know what this place is called, Mr Potter?”
“Hello,” greets Draco. He doesn’t say ‘Hello, Potter’ or even ‘Hello, darling’. Maybe he’s just as unsure as Harry as to where they stand right now.
They continue in this vein for a while, the argument devolving into some nonsensical debate about carpets, of all things. Harry stops paying attention, and is quietly finishing his burger, when he sees an owl tapping at the window.
Harry lets out a moan of pure relief as he fucks himself down on Draco’s cock. After going so slowly for so long, things finally start to move fast. Draco meets him on every thrust, movements too frantic for their mouths to meet in a kiss.
“I know people put you on a pedestal, but I didn’t expect you to take it so literally.”
He swallows, and looks up at Draco. “I think- I think I need to be alone, right now.”
“I bet even you don’t have one of those,” says Ginerva, just as he moves out of earshot.
Harry gasps, feeling sensitive and a little embarrassed, now the high is wearing off. He really did let Draco say some ridiculous things to him. He squirms as Draco strokes at his inner walls, and thinks he wouldn’t mind if he kept saying them. Intuitive as ever, Draco obliges.
Harry shakes his head.
“It’s not common, but it happens,” shrugs Malfoy.
Maybe, despite his world turning upside down, it did have one constant. Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy would never get along.
He has to pull off for a second so he doesn’t accidentally bite down, but he licks and mouths at Draco’s cock while he rides out the wave. A shuddering exhale over the heated skin in front of him makes Draco groan, and Harry takes mercy on him. A few bobs of his head later and Draco is following him over the precipice.
When Draco closes his eyes, he sees Terran’s smug bastard face. He drifts off to sweet imaginings of hitting him with every hex and jinx he ever learnt- and his Bellatrix taught him a few.
Andromeda steps aside to let him in. “Not at all, but I should probably warn you that Draco is here. I don’t want any unpleasantness; he’s a nice young man, really.”
As if summoned, a smattering of Ravenclaw's came into Draco's line of sight. They all stopped short when they saw him, and silence fell over the hall. Terry stood near the back of the group, staring down at the floor. Draco felt a fierce urge to strangle them all, but could not come up with a reasonable excuse as to why. Stamping these feelings down, Draco sent a rueful smile at Goldstein, who only stared back.
“Hogwarts, too?”
Potter frowns. The Weaselette interrupts. “Leave him alone, Malfoy.”
As they grabbed and swallowed down a few cups of punch, Draco admired the pretty decorations around the room. It was like a snow kingdom, with the towering trees and ice-covered walls. Hogwarts had gone all out.
Draco pursed his lips, tilting his head. Potter’s eyes traced this movement almost obsessively.

It was too late. Snape was smart, and was already putting it together as Draco had. He kept darting his head from the golden egg that Filch had picked up, to the map that Moody was now holding. It was a little like watching something from a movie. "Potter."
Leaving, the morning air hit him in the face, harsher than it had been before. He looked down each side of the street and decided to make a last detour for a fresh box of cigarettes. Draco doesn’t smoke often, but it’s good to have some handy.
Draco immediately throws most of his weight on the man. It forces Severus to move slower, but if he didn’t Draco would definitely fall. Every limb feels heavy, like a bag of stones has been tied to each corner of his body. “Where are we going?”

Sirius looked interested, despite the dark looks the rest of them were casting at her. Draco hadn’t even bared the brunt of it, but even he was sick of Granger going on about house-elf rights. “Crouch sacked his elf?”
Granger, who Draco doubted he’d ever look at the same again, stood up. “Honestly, you can’t actually believe he’s seen something! What utter rubbish!”
A moment of silence passes. Then:
“That’s Hagrid!” The boy finally sounds pleased. “He’s the groundskeeper at Hogwarts. Isn’t he cool?”
The next hour is spent splitting up to buy his school supplies more efficiently. Draco gets himself everything potions-related, while his father goes to fetch some new pots of ink and parchment. They meet at the bookshop after what only feels like minutes.
He squeezes his eyes shut and shakes his head. Draco is tired everywhere and feels sure that if he were to stand, he’d die or something equally as dramatic. “That’s alright. Would you like some water?”
Underneath the table, Potter kicked at Draco's foot with his own shoe. "What is it?" he asked.
He let out a breath. Potter tapped his fingers on his knee. An uncomfortable silence settled over them. Then, "You'll think I'm mad if I tell you. Everyone else who knows does."
"Severus, don't be rash," Draco said, which was almost definitely the wrong thing to say. Snape hadn't so much at glanced at him during class, and probably would've preferred to kiss Sirius Black than get some sort of order from Draco.
Lupin led them into an abandoned classroom when he finally showed up, where a single set of drawers was rattling in the corner. A few students jumped back.
A bell chimes when they enter the shop. There’s an old man bustling about that must be Ollivander, since he whirls around when the door snaps shut and quickly pins his pale, translucent eyes on Draco.
Sometime around Easter, Draco entered the Divination classroom to find every table filled with crystal balls. This was strange because they weren’t meant to start crystal-gazing till next term. He hurried over to their usual desk, where Potter was telling Weasley to not complain. “At least we’ve finished palmistry... Hello, Draco. Where have you just come from?”
“Where’s the dog?”
Draco furrowed his eyebrows. “Pardon?”
Draco blinked, and finally took a proper look at who he was talking with. It was Blaise Zabini. He had his usual look of his distaste in his brown eyes, like everything was beneath him, though it seemed less pronounced. His cheekbones were sharp and overall handsome. "Um."
Again, she shut her eyes. This time, her hair became shorter and changed into the same blonde on Draco's own head. Tonks also made her eyes grey and features sharper. "Hah! Now I'm a Malfoy!"
Draco hugged his knees to his chest. "They're not so bad. Dumbledore doesn't let them inside the castle or anything."
Before either of them could stammer out an (amazing) explanation, a loud commotion could be heard at the entrance. Draco turns and sees a group of ghosts dressed like hunters standing tall and proud by the door. Their heads, he also notices, aren’t attached to the translucent bodies. Nearly Headless Nick made his way over.
“What was it?”
Draco did so without question, and as he thought about the address written onto the note, a multi-storied house appeared, placed snugly between the homes numbered 'eleven' and 'thirteen'. He immediately worked out what had happened. "A Fidelius Charm! That's brilliant. Hey, wait, I've been here before."
Just as Draco begins to wonder what was happening, a new voice startles into his consciousness. A warm, determined voice that he’d learnt to recognise over the last few months.
“A Malfoy should never sulk. It is beneath us,” his father tells him, expertly weaving around corners and streets that bring them closer to Borgin and Burkes. “So why, please tell me, are
Draco licked his lips, belatedly realising that his attempt to stop crying had failed. His cheeks were wet.
The next ten minutes of his life were terribly dull. He walked and walked, legs burning, with no sight of Luna or her father anywhere. It was only when a dark green light burst from nearby did he get truly afraid.
“Well, this is a surprise,” he drawls. Potter straightens up. “Long time no see, yes?”
"We only wanna know who he is," Weasley says. "Is that a crime?"
When he woke up, there was sunlight glaring through the window and a high ringing coming from somewhere beside him. Draco groaned and rolled onto his stomach, stuffing his face into the nearest pillow.
Immediately, the spider began to writhe in pain. Its hairy legs bent inwards and rolled over onto his back. Draco was sure if it had a voice, a loud screaming would've been echoing throughout the entire room. He hated it. "Stop!"
He shook his head, waving a careless hand for them to sit. Weasley took the window seat, Granger beside him.
There was also the matter of Draco's wand.
Draco wonders if she thought that because of the
He guesses he’d been sitting like that for ten minutes before somebody familiar and grounding appeared next to his ear. “Draco, you must count to ten. Do you mind if I touch you?”
Potter left. Draco could finally breathe.
That makes him scowl for real.
Potter shrugged, and then started pulling him out of the shop. "Ron and Hermione should be at the Three Broomsticks. Let's go see them."
Potter pushed his glasses further up his nose and stood. He put his hand over Teddy’s shoulder, again. “Thanks, Malfoy.”
"His eyes are as green as a fresh-pickled toad, his hair is as dark as a blackboard. I wish he was mine, he's really divine; the hero who conquered the Dark Lord!" the dwarf sings in an awful, high-pitched voice.
Nobody moved. Draco resisted the urge to throw up a rude hand signal and stormed over to the entrance of the cave. As soon as he was hidden from view, he dashed away the tears on his cheeks and ran for Hogwarts castle. He had no inclination to stay for any longer than needed.
Sirius shrugged. Draco had a bad feeling about this. He had, after all, thought about it himself on that very night. When those Ministry people had been interrogating the three, Draco snuck off so they didn’t catch him and blame him for it.
Potter dropped a tender hand on the boy’s shoulder, appearing troubled. “Teddy is a Metamorphmagus, but he’s not been able to change anything since early last night. I think it might be a side-effect of one of George’s newest inventions that were left lying around.”
“Shut up.” Potter heaves Draco up and wraps an arm around his shoulders. “Lean on me, or we’ll never get out of here. It’s a good thing you’re so skinny.”
“No!” Draco says, pushing away the memories of waking up with bruises from knocking into things the day before and falling over bumps in the road outside the Manor. “It was an accident.”
Granger, in all her bushy hair and large teeth glory, lets out a loud sigh of relief at the sight of Draco. “My goodness, I’ve been looking for you everywhere! Harry and Ron are nowhere to be found, so I’m beginning to think that they’ve missed the trains. Hopefully they still have some brains left from last year and owled McGonagall for another way to get there, so I’ll-- Oh.” She stops her rambling very suddenly, breath coming fast. “I didn’t know you had a sister, Malfoy.”
"Have you got your permission slip signed?" Granger asked in late October, the evening before their first Hogsmeade weekend.
He flinched and ended up banging his foot against the table's leg. A blast of pain shot up his calf, and Draco barely was able to muffle his own shout. "What the hell did you have to sneak up on me for, mate? You fucking scared me!"
Draco stole another glance inside the classroom. Umbridge had started waving her wand and pushing all the chairs in from her spot at her desk, which seemed a bit stupid. Students were about to arrive and mess it all up, again, anyway.
He couldn’t say all that, though. It was embarrassing. (And just plain crazy.)
His parents had tried getting him to talk about it with them and, on one particularly memorable occasion, a mind-Healer, but the only thing that really seemed to help was writing the dreams down. He has almost three full diaries worth, full of things that at first glance seem meaningless but always has Draco waking up screaming.
"Oh." Harry paused. "Okay, then."
Professor Umbridge made a note on her clipboard. "And, correct me if I'm wrong, you are the first in your family to have inherited Cassandra's Second Sight?"
He entered Diagon Alley some seconds later and wandered off in the direction of Magical Menagerie.
Later that night, Ravenclaw and the rest of the houses were evacuated to the Great Hall. Draco and Luna moved their sleeping bags into the corner where Potter, Weasley, and Granger had situated themselves. Immediately, they explained what had happened— Black had found a way into the castle, and made an attack on... the Fat Lady?
Professor Trelawney came sweeping past again but paused in front of them this time. She looked at Draco and then snatched the cup from him. She turned it anti-clockwise over and over, tilting her head slightly. "The falcon, a deadly enemy.. The club, an attack... A skull, danger in your path. Oh dear, this is not a happy cup."
"Sirius Black," Draco said absently. Granger choked on her pumpkin juice. "Technically, it's first cousin once removed. Or was it third? Probably both, actually. Did you know his parents were second cousins?"
," Severus interrupted. "
"You're probably going mad."
Draco shrugged, pleased. He doubted Potter had ever thanked him for anything in their lives. “Of course. You know the way out?”
The sound continued until he, angrily, curled his fingers around the base of his wand and muttered a spell to shut it up. Breathing a sigh of relief, Draco dropped back into the warmth of his covers, eyes crusty with sleep. He cursed his past self for forgetting to cancel the Siren Charm that many of the Healers use, as it leaves him awake at 6:02 A.M. on a Saturday for no reason.
Draco sits down in the conjured chair, and touches a hand to his temple, before pushing his hair out of his eyes. “You’re a Seer, then, as well as the Chosen One.” There’s no lingering malice when he sighs “You just can’t help being special can you?”
“Sorry, Potter. What was that?”
“No, why did she visit you?”
“Oh mate,” sighs Ron.
Draco drops his head onto Blaise’s shoulder. “I fucked Harry Potter. A lot. Repeatedly. In very kinky ways.”
Malfoy laughs and pulls him into a filthy kiss. “You can ruin as many as you like, so long as we can do that again.”
“They sound like mental institutions,” Ginerva points out, none too kindly.
Harry freezes. What does he need? All he knows is that if Draco stops touching him he might die. “I don’t know.”
He frowns, and tries to channel his inner Hermione. “Um, the more you revise the better you’ll do. It’s up to you how your exams go.”
“I can’t really avoid it.”
Malfoy doesn’t ask him to elaborate as he leads Harry into the hallway, but he does anyway. “I wasn’t alone when I read your note.”
Draco has a few choice comments of his own to make, but he’s too far away to join the discussion naturally. Instead, he’s stuck being lectured by Percy about the proper way to format inter-departmental memos. He catches Harry’s eye, and glares. It’s his fault he’s being subjected to this. Harry’s answering grin is unrepentant, and he finds himself forgiving the bastard. You can get away with a lot, with a face like that.
Harry sighs. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you. I was going to, I was just worried about your reaction.”
Of course, he’d known this was coming. What he wasn’t expecting was for it to come after a kiss like that, when he’s already so off balance, when he’d spent a few seconds thinking that
Isla shakes her head. “Thank you, but I’d rather stay here for now. At least until the wards are fixed- I want to keep an eye on progress.
He huffs a laugh. “We were in a room full of dangerous and temperamental machinery. How was I supposed to kiss you properly?”
He hadn’t been sure that Pansy knew how he felt until that moment, but perhaps he really is that obvious.
“Why?” he breathes. “I still don’t even get why you offered to help me in the first place. Why do you want to do this with me when you could go back to that leather bar and find someone who knows what they’re doing? Someone you never hated and never hated you?”
“You know, I think you might’ve given him the wrong impression,” he says.
“I’m not! I promise.” Harry looks up. “Her ghost came to visit me.”
“Aright, alright, I’ll find a treat for you.”
“You’re not going to tell me who?” she asks, sitting next to him and folding her legs underneath her.
“I’m sorry,” says Harry, unsure how to comfort someone who’s been dead a hundred years or more. “I can move you downstairs if you like, so you won’t be on your own.”
“What’s that, then?” he asks, keeping his voice level.
He kisses Harry again and tries to ease him back down on the bed. Harry sighs into his mouth and lets him for a moment. Where did all his bravery go? It’s just sex. People do it all the time, even teenagers do it, why shouldn’t he? He’s twenty-six, not sixteen. It’s stupid to get so worked up over it. His resolve lasts until Terran’s dick presses against his stomach, and he flinches without meaning to. Terran doesn’t react, just keeps putting more of his weight onto Harry’s body, his fingers wandering back down between his legs.
“That’s it,” he says, stroking Harry’s skin with his cock, and scraping his teeth behind Harry’s ear. “Are you sure you’re alright? We can leave it there if you want to.”
Tuesday begins with blissful silence. Harry wanders downstairs in his pajamas- he’s taken to sleeping fully clothed since the random appearance of women in his bedroom became commonplace- and begins making breakfast. He’s stirring scrambled eggs when Bunny knocks her beak against the window, and as soon as he lets her in, she steals a rasher of bacon from the kitchen counter.
Harry shrugs and smiles apologetically. He’d begun to wonder as well.
“I don’t hate him. I mean, I used to, but not anymore.”
He seems so vulnerable like this. Draco’s instincts are torn between wrapping him in cotton wool and eating him alive. Regardless, he’s happy to go at this cautious, teasing pace. His dick doesn’t recover as fast as it used to, and even though he got hard again pretty fast, it’ll still take a while before he’s ready to come again.
“I’m not wasting my money on clothes I hardly ever wear, and don’t even like.”
Maybe it’s just part of the game they’re playing, but it feels like more than that. For the first time, Harry wonders if Draco isn’t a little fucked up about sex, too. He’s still inside him, not soft yet, and he jerks Harry with a merciless pace. He kisses him like he wants to climb inside him and never leave, and despite his confusion, Harry comes too.
Harry tugs hard, feeling the satisfying stretch of his muscles in his arms and shoulders, his core as he bucks upwards. It brings their chests together, Harry’s naked skin against the soft fabric of Draco’s shirt. As much as he loves Draco’s body, and he has a beautiful one, Harry likes when he’s the only one undressed. He feels exposed, and wanted, like Draco can’t even wait long enough to take his clothes off before he fucks him.
2: I'm already planning another fic, but I haven't started writing it. It's a Jane Eyre AU, because it was my favourite book as a maudlin eight year old and it fits scarily well with the characters, so I'd love to hear what people think about that. If no ones interested, I have other ideas on the back burner.
