“That’s not true,” Harry said indignantly, only to be ignored.
Malfoy looked up at him and blinked.  “You actually showed. I guess all that business about Gryffindors being honest is at least somewhat true,” he remarked, arms folded, as he leaned back at the table. “Or at least rather stupid.”
Ron waved off his comment dismissively. “Another day. I’ve worked myself into the ground today.”
“I wanted to talk to you… about our prior tutoring session,” Harry said through his teeth. “I believe we have a couple of things to… discuss.”
Harry exhaled slowly. His heart was thudding and he remembered just how stubborn Malfoy could be, so decided it would be best to just give in and get the talking over with.
Malfoy, not detaching his lips, looked up. “Why what?”
“Well what?” Malfoy prompted, breathless.
“You’re quite good at that on your own,” snarled Malfoy.
Harry went pink and he tried to cover his face with his hands.
"What?"
“Even to me?”
Draco jumped at the movement now, almost appearing nervous—even though they had already done a number of despicable things to one another. "This is stupid," He said harshly, not looking at Harry. "I should just go."
"Thought you didn't want to talk to me, Malfoy," Harry said accusingly, unable to suppress the glow of pride. “What happened to that? Just couldn’t stay away, could ya?”
She looked quite proud of herself. "It creates the emotion of love. It’s not real love, but it feels that way in the moment."
It got deafeningly quiet in the room. Malfoy took two steps toward him and, for a moment, Harry feared that he would lunge at him again. He could still feel the fading bruise beneath his left eye.
Ron gave Harry a triumphant look as he strode over toward him. He nodded toward the Slytherin, who was now deep in discussion with Professor Snape. “Appears as though Malfoy’s tomfoolery is finally catching up to him, you think?”
Ron stretched. "Well we have Potions next. Maybe he'll be back to his usual arrogant self by then," he concluded.
“Well, me and this girl… we kissed. We have a lot of chemistry, but we have never really gotten along very well before. But she said she wants to act as though it didn’t happen, and we are supposed to drop it. But— there’s this weird tension now.”
“I’m trying to explain Potter, is that not what you wanted?”
They fell quiet.
“It’s okay, Ron,” he said, but Ron cast him an anxious look. “I think it was just a misunderstanding.”
"—But I was wondering if you knew something about... Malfoy?" Ron asked, trying to sound casual but evidently worried he might set Harry off. "I mean, he has been acting a bit odd. Didn’t you notice?”
Now, Malfoy looked indignant. “Wait a damn minute, Potter, what kind of insinuation are you making? Pansy may have a thing for me but we are not involved.”
Harry just kissed his back, marveling at the scratch marks he had left all over it.
Harry closed his eyes, realizing just how absurd he sounded at that moment. He was stuttering and repeating half of his sentences to Malfoy, who was furrowing his eyebrows in confusion.
“I said turn around,” Harry repeated, more coldly now. He stared at Malfoy’s mouth unwillingly. He was grabbing Malfoy’s sides and trying, to no avail, to get him to listen.
“Hermione, please,” Ron moaned.
Harry could feel Malfoy unmoving against him. For a second, Harry thought himself absolutely idiotic for thinking this was the only way to handle the problem.
Malfoy continued at that constant speed, slowly going faster as Harry began to let out small little grunts around his hand. Harry attempted to mutter, his head growing fuzzy with the feeling of being filled with… with Malfoy.
“No, sir,” Harry said softly.
Harry went silent, stiffening, when he felt Malfoy's mouth on his cock.
Malfoy still was evidently raging inside. “Doubt that.”
“I’ll be going then,” Harry said, mouth a flat line.
Harry clenched his teeth to avoid spitting back another foul comment.
Ron blinked with interest. “Oh?” he asked, straightening up with sudden curiosity. “Who is it? Where did you meet? Do I know her? Is she fit? I bet—“
“Good.”
“Oh, no,” Hermione looked away.
Ron piped up, “Hey, Harry, did you know they’re serving chocolate pudding at lunch? We may want to make a grab for it.”
“What was that for?” Harry asked.
“There you two are,” Ron said, letting out a loud yawn. He stretched.
Harry’s heart thumped rapidly as he felt Malfoy’s hand on his neck.
“For your own health and safety, I’ll pretend I didn't hear that one,” Malfoy said.
It got quiet again. Harry was unsure of what to say and was half-expecting him to go on.
“Potter, I told Malfoy to reach out to you for help in the Defense Against the Dark Arts. I instruct you to take him under your wing and instead, you found it appropriate to absolutely swing on one another in the middle of the common room,” Snape drawled.
He lifted up the vial and took a slow, suspicious sip.
Harry mulled over this. Did he like Malfoy? Or did he just like the feeling?
Malfoy looked infuriated. He gave Harry a dark look, now looking extremely threatening.
“Fine,” Harry said shortly. “But you’re to take me seriously this time. I’m not doing this for fun and neither are you.”
"Something wrong?” Ron asked. “I thought it was funny is all.”
The next morning at breakfast, Harry made sure that he was flanked by Hermione and Ron. He begrudgingly filled the two in on the way to the Great Hall about his experience with Malfoy the night before.
“Nothing—nothing clever, which is also pretty typical,” Malfoy remarked defensively, but Harry did not miss his slight stutter. “Potter
Malfoy stopped and looked at him but said nothing. Slowly, calmly, he set his textbooks down on the floor beside him, crossed his arms, and gave Harry a dark look.
Harry shifted back and forth, wringing his hands, and gazing up at Malfoy as if looking at him for the first time. He felt oddly exposed after such a vulnerable and honest conversation.
Harry flushed. “What—mphhh—“
Malfoy, finally, smirked. “Enjoy that, did you?” He asked, sounding very proud of himself. It was the last thing he expected him to say. “Thought you would.”
Malfoy just replied flatly, "That’s repulsive. Disgusting, honestly.”
Harry’s head was spinning with confusion.
Regardless of Draco not agreeing to meet with him, Harry went out that night anyway. He found it better to be alone with his thoughts than having Ron ponder what had come over Malfoy in class.
He found himself waiting outside the Slytherin common room, waiting for a particular cocky Slytherin to emerge. He was unsure of how he came to this point but he, almost possessed,  Harry busied himself by pretending to lean against a window for light to read his Charms textbook.
Even Potions seemed to be only moderately frustrating, with Malfoy choosing to sit on the other side of the room with him. This allowed Harry to draw in ink on his parchment while Snape went over notes, with Ron beside him watching and Hermione on the other side taking notes meticulously.
Malfoy leaned back and cursed. Harry watched him sit up but didn't move himself. He felt as though he were made of rubber and could only imagine the mark that had been left on him.
"Well, it's not ideal for me either,
“I was not the one who wanted to discuss it,” Malfoy reminded him.
“Got yourself a girlfriend, Potter?” Malfoy asked disbelievingly. “Some miracle.”
Even Snape’s mouth was a flat line opposed to a tight frown.
“What the hell indeed,” Harry agreed, voice so low that it took even him aback. “Good luck on your final grades. I won’t be helping. Hire a different tutor; like you said, you can afford the best.”
Ron and Hermione fell into an uncomfortable silence where they glanced at one another.
that was as literal, because he wanted to punch Malfoy something awful.
He began to knock angrily. He had had quite enough of Malfoy acting like a child over a joke about kissing Pansy Parkinson.
The two stared at him. They blinked.
Malfoy hummed. “Unfortunate, really.”
“I felt angry and I felt a lot of things—“
Malfoy suddenly had his hand on his belt buckle, undoing it swiftly while holding eye contact with Harry. Harry, who at first stood there stiffly with his mouth parted, could only begin to help him get the rest of his trousers off.
This put everyone in a good mood except for Harry, who was still rather offended and confused by Malfoy’s display from earlier.
Harry had later waited for Malfoy to show up to the dining hall. He could hear his own blood roaring, his entire body tense with rage and frustration, continuously gripping and letting go of his wand menacingly.
Malfoy slumped to the ground, panting. “Damn, that--that was amazing, Potter.”
“Er,” Harry started, then realized he did not have much to supply that with. His face felt hot and instead of feeling more understanding of the situation, he now only felt more confused than ever before.
Hermione was also sitting on the couch, book in hand, as she swung her legs. “Oh, right. Isn’t that at 6?” she asked.
“Keep what a secret?” Malfoy blinked.
He told himself that he did not like Malfoy. He couldn’t; but hell, Harry would be lying if he said that he couldn’t stop thinking about their urgent, needy kisses. The way Malfoy touched him just above his—
Ron raised a brow. "Well, for starters he didn't even complain that he had to be your partner during Potions. And then that episode!" He added, as if remembering. "What was that about!”
Harry heaved a great sigh, dug around in his pocket, and pulled out a few Galleons to slap them on the table. “Go on,” he said. “I didn’t want to do this in the first place.”
He saw Malfoy around the castle, but it wasn’t enough. It hurt desperately that he was unable to go and see Malfoy, touch him, kiss him, cuddle alongside him in bed once they’ve finished their “homework”.
“Quiet—
Harry was staring at him.
Malfoy turned so he was in front of him then. Harry watched as his eyes trailed over him, suddenly feeling awkward and uncomfortable despite having just been ravished by the Slytherin. He had never seen the other look at him with such unmasked curiosity and thought.
Harry eyed him once more, noting that the Slytherin had pointedly put his wand away as if to signal that he was not going to do anything. “I suppose that works.”
That wiped the smirk off Malfoy’s face and replaced it with a look of sheer embarrassment. Harry had never seen it on his face and, for all the problems he had given Harry and his friends throughout the years, chose to relish it.
At last, Harry let out a harsh breath through his nose. “I understand.”
(See the end of the chapter for
By the time the two were able to pull the boys off of each other, Professor McGonagall brushed her hair out of her eyes in exasperation. “Now,” she huffed. “Would you care to explain yourselves?”
With that, Harry gathered his materials in his arms and walked off. He clutched his books in his arms and stalked out of the Slytherin common room, ignoring the disdainful looks he received.
“Nobody, Hermione,” Harry admonished. “Just a fling. Nothing serious.”
“Maybe you’ll listen to me next time,” Harry murmured, and entered him harshly. Malfoy let out a gasp that turned into noises of delight as Harry began to build a slow rhythm.
Malfoy, who was slouched in a chair, did not seem to notice Harry’s entrance, however.
Malfoy scowled. “Forget I showed up then!”
Harry was just about to grab hold of Malfoy again when—
Snape grinned devilishly. "Good. Now, can anyone tell me the effect of amortentia?"
“Malfoy…” Harry said warningly.
“My job,” Malfoy said, “is done then.”
He averted his eyes. He began to study his shoes as if they were truly interesting.
“Merlin, Potter, you can speak again.”
Then, it was over.
Malfoy peered over his shoulder, then turned back to Harry. “I’m going to kiss you.”
“Harry’s got a
“Just was offering,” Harry said coldly.
“Just get your homework out,” Harry said shortly.
“What? Oh. You go ahead. I’ll catch up,” Harry said, not looking away. He had not even noticed when Ron gave him a funny look at his hasty disregard for meat-filled bread, said his goodbye, and walked out in the direction of the dining hall.
There was a pause where Malfoy’s cocky look suddenly disappeared again. His face was unreadable and, for a moment, Harry worried that he had misinterpreted everything. He worried that Malfoy’s sudden softness, his allowing Harry to sleep with his arms around him, his gentle kisses on the forehead, had all been just customary.
“Privately,” Harry said between his teeth.
“Gladly!” Harry swore, kicking the wall. He instinctively grabbed his wand.
Harry continued to stare at him angrily. “Well, you don’t have to talk about her like that.”
Malfoy then stopped right beside Harry, looking down at him with unmasked hatred. “I’d like my money back,” he said shortly. It sounded as though he wanted to say something else, but he just went silent.
“You don’t seem all too happy to have gotten rid of him,” Hermione said.
Harry moved forward so their knees brushed slightly. "If it's so disgusting then I guess it would bother you if I did this," Harry said, finding himself placing his hand on Draco's arm.
Harry tried to look intent on the potion. "You are being kinda loud, you know?"
Harry barely touched his food after his kind began to turn over a number of scenarios. He instead poked at it as he tried unsuccessfully to swallow back some of the anxiety and stress he was now feeling. In that moment, he hated Snape more than usual.
“Merlin, you love this. You told you didn’t like cock or me, but suddenly it seems like you like both,” Malfoy said as began to build a constant pace. Each thrust forced Harry back against the desk. “Right?”
Glaring, Malfoy fumbled with his robes. "I said that, didn't I?" He seemed to realize that if he wanted Harry to reciprocate, he would have to not be so rash; for him, this would be difficult and Harry knew it. "So, yes. I like you, alright? Want me to say it aloud again?”
“You’re afraid,” Harry said matter-of-factly. “Afraid of liking me, afraid of what your father will say—what your friends will say. I don’t care. Don’t come and try to act like nothing is going on, when you clearly have feelings—at least some feelings—for me.”
A few Gryffindors were staring at him.
Ron looked up angrily, his fists clenched at the mention of his name.
“Oh, hello. I didn’t hear you come in,” Harry said, realizing how obvious that was.
Harry gave him a scathing look. “You want to kiss and have sex and hang out, but you don’t like me?” he inquired. “Right, makes tons of sense.”
Harry sat up, rolling off of him hastily.
“Was I unclear?” Snape cut him off in a voice so callous that Harry did not dare argue but instead gave Malfoy a dirty look.
“Lets try that charm together,” Harry said.
Malfoy looked equally as worn out.
He walked away with a taunting look, waving comically. He looked slightly amused at the ridiculous look that was inevitably bewildered.
Harry was unable to hide any reaction now. He looked at him still, more dubiously now as he waited to see if there were any trace of a joke in this. However, Malfoy’s expression remained rather stone-like.
Malfoy did grab his robes and forcibly push him against the wall. His hands held Harry’s arms in place, which gave the taller one the advantage.
Harry rolled his eyes.
Malfoy eyed him very suspiciously. “You… do? Like genuinely?”
Ron nodded slowly, clutching his hand around his wand until his knuckles went white. “I’m here if you need me, mate. Just call and I’ll be there to hex his—“
The Slytherin’s face was pink with anger. “Or so help me,” Harry continued, feeling hot with frustration and—Harry’s pants were suddenly tight as he watched Malfoy squirm and curse at him with a loathing stare, “I’ll turn you around myself, bend you over, and fuck you right here on this floor.”
“Yeah,” Malfoy snapped. “I would. You walked off halfway through our tutoring session.”
Harry could hear the desperation in his voice and was also reluctant to feel some warmth in his cheeks. He hoped that the two had not noticed.
“Fine,” Malfoy cut him off. “I'll be there Thursday at 6.”
Harry must have turned red with anger. “Maybe if you tried to be a better student, you wouldn’t have been failing in the first place.”
“Shut up,” he muttered. “You want the entire school to hear you moaning?”
Malfoy gaped, red with fury. “Potter, I swear—I will ruin your life even more so than I ever have. I will make your life a living hell. I’ll—”
Harry’s heart sunk, feeling defeated. “Yes, sir.”
”, and slipped them on.
Harry gaped at McGonagall. Would she do nothing else? What would Snape tell her?
“Fuck you!” Malfoy muttered, “You absolute fucker, I hate you and your hands and your cock and your stupid personality and your—oh, yes!”
Harry watched as Draco dropped his head onto the desk and gave a short, bizzare laugh. "Hey, Potter," He tried to speak but only got out another short laugh. "You have such pretty eyes. Green."
“Right,” Malfoy said dryly. “Your schedule must be entirely packed with meetings with the press and Quidditch tournament interviews. So sorry to disrupt that.”
“But—”
“Not that I need to explain myself to you,” he added quickly, almost defensively when he saw that Harry did not react to the statement about his father.
"Is it alright if I kiss you?" Harry asked, surprising himself.
Malfoy was purposefully silent.
Malfoy scowled. “Just begin, professor,” he sneered coldly.
“Nevermind,” he said quickly. “You really think I should do it?”
“Well,” Harry said slowly. “We are kind of… around each other more… and things have been going on between us—“
Harry was having a hard time focusing— yes, trolls are in fact— yes, unicorns are best known for— no, werewolves do not—they do not—and then Harry looked over.
Malfoy had settled himself in now. He was looking cozied up in the chair, his wand in hand, and he looked very impatient. “Well?”
Harry nodded. Anxiety still made his chest tight.  “I don’t know why…” he said, trailing off.
Snape continued his lesson and even when class was about to end, still no snide remark from Draco Malfoy. It was a little unnerving, honestly, seeing him so quiet and contained, but he still appeared disgusted.
Ron was pursing his lips, ears pink.
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry noted a wild dash of red move in his direction. The red was paired with a freckled face, and long limbs.
“I never said that,” Harry hissed. He felt his chest tighten a bit, however, and tried to push away the slight hurt in his voice. “I just wanted to do the right thing, and yes that includes you.”
“No,” Harry said quickly. He did not particularly want to get into a fight in the Slytherin dorms where he would undoubtedly be outnumbered and widely disliked. “I’ll be leaving.”
“How the hell are you supposed to do what?” Malfoy asked again. “I don’t feel like we are making a lot of progress on a proper conversation right now.”
“What’d he say?” Crabbe leaned in, almost knocking over the potion.
“No need for a reminder,” Malfoy looked positively annoyed. “I remember how distinctly boring you are.”
“Mate,” Ron said slowly, after a long pause of thinking, “I just don’t understand romance and it’s time we admit to ourselves we are in the same boat.”
It was mostly empty except for a few first-years and Hermione, who was sitting at a table with a book.
Harry hardly needed to be asked twice. He edged forward and wrapped his arms around Malfoy. He breathed in his sharp scent, watching the way his mouth curved up in a knowing smirk and pulled him in.
Harry shrugged, still observing his food as he ate. "Dunno."
Harry was surprisingly ready, trying to go for his wand, but Malfoy had him so that he couldn’t move his arms. They went down together, Malfoy landing heavily on top of Harry and practically knocking the breath out him.
“Yeah,” Ron added hurriedly. “At least you get the money from it. And, hopefully, stay well above failing in Potions.”
Ron laughed. "Wait until I tell Hermione! Of all people, Draco Malfoy, tried to snog you," He said, laughing so hard that he leaned over the chair. He pounded his fist on the table. "Who heard of a thing?"
“Nothing, carry on,” Harry said mindlessly.
Malfoy went from angry to suddenly looking understanding, looking over his shoulder. “You’re right, I don’t think this is the place for something like this.”
“Good.”
“Don’t tempt me!” Malfoy snarled.
Harry, mortified, attempted to pull the collar of his sweater up. He had forgotten all about the bright purple mark on his neck that was now garnering attention from the whole class, including but not limited to Snape and Draco Malfoy.
Please comment! :) Hope you enjoyed
It wasn't much at first, but then Malfoy was definitely acting rather strange. Really, really strange. He was behaving in a rather loopy manner. His features softened and he looked rather content. He hummed amicably, seeming almost unaware that he was still in a classroom.
Hermione pursed her lips, staring at him quizzically, so Harry hurried to make a couple of rude comments about Malfoy, and her curious look deflated slightly.
Harry, mindlessly, leaned forward and pushed away the piece of Malfoy’s hair. Harry realized how stupid he looked almost immediately after he had done it. Of all the ridiculous things he had done, this was at the top of the list—and now, to top it off, his cheeks were burning.
," Malfoy rolled his eyes.
Harry then tried to ignore suspicious eyes on him as he entered the Slytherin common room. It felt that all eyes were on him, which he should be used to, but also his robes felt overwhelmingly red in a mass of the dark green.
Harry reddened. “I’m not trying to be a savior, I’m just trying to be nice!”
“Glad we cleared up nothing,” Harry mumbled. He began to turn, suddenly wanting to be enjoying chocolate frogs with Ron in the Gryffindor common room, with Hermione at their side.
“Uh-oh,” Harry said immediately. He elbowed Ron. “Look.”
Malfoy looked absolutely stunned. Harry couldn’t help but wonder if that’s how he dumbfounded he looked when he was kissed. Then, Harry felt dumbfounded himself because he had just purposely, on his own will, kissed Draco Malfoy.
Only a few others glanced in their direction quizzically but seemed to just go back to their potions when Malfoy returned to his chair by force.
“I think, maybe, you two need distance—”
She eyed him suspiciously and, after a moment, folded her book and put it aside. Her eyes were now glowing with delight.
"No!" Harry got out. "I like you too."
“Malfoy! Don’t grab me like that!” Harry reprimanded.
Why would Malfoy… what in the hell… when… why? Harry’s thoughts were choppy and panicked. His brain has turned into mush and abruptly, he was unable to move. He wanted to pull away and shove Malfoy firmly but he felt his shoes had grown into the floor.
She was still fretting over his eye. “You’ll be all bruised up tomorrow,” she scolded. “Honestly, boys are just so stupid sometime. Fighting!”
“Right,” Harry said hurriedly. “Um…”
Harry kissed Malfoy again, which he certainly didn't argue with. His fingers found his hair and pulled him closer, still trying to manage to shuffle forward.
Malfoy let out a sob of pleasure, pink rising to his face at Harry’s words.
Zabini looked taken aback, going from looking interrupted to purely offended. “Potter, if you don’t find yourself out of here, I have the nerve to go straight to—“
“So,” Harry said slowly. “Back to the lesson?”
Malfoy was beginning to bristle now, no longer smirking. “I’ll do as I please, Potter!” he said. “You’re not a prefect and you can’t tell me to do anything.”
“You’re a slut, Draco Malfoy,” Harry whispered, and with that, Malfoy came with a high-pitched moan around Harry’s fingers. Come coated Harry’s hand as Malfoy shuddered through his orgasm.
“Only a bit? That seems like an understatement from what I’ve noticed going on in your pants.”
Harry licked his lips self-consciously. “Well,” he repeated. “Are you going to tell me now? Are you going to tell me why you kissed me? Tell me how much you hate me? Tell me how much you hate kissing me? Why you—”
With that, he turned over and eventually fell into a troubled sleep.
"Malfoy, right! What happened?” Ron repeated.
Somehow, Harry managed to get back into his dorm. He closed the door a bit loudly and Ron sat up in bed. His hair was a wreck and his eyes were only half open.
“You’re a risky little shit, Potter,” the blonde murmured, giving Harry a dark look. “Suppose it’s why I like you—only a bit.”
Their hands touched once, briefly, when flipping through their textbook and they practically leapt away from one another. Harry looked at him angrily and slipped both of his hands into his pockets.
And then, Harry grabbed Malfoy’s belt and undid it. He turned Malfoy around forcibly, who hissed and thrashed at first due to a preference for being in control, but moaned when Harry found his cock.
“Hello, Malfoy,” Harry said, and watched Malfoy stiffen in his chair.
“Mr. Draco Malfoy, I believe we ought to speak after class,” said a professor with particularly long, oily dark hair; the blonde, in turn, did not take very long to cast his typical ill-tempered look at the remark. “But rest of you may go.”
“Just let me talk to him. No fighting,” he said, trying to soothe Hermione.
Harry looked at Malfoy as though he had grown a second head. He felt like his thoughts could not catch up with what was happening in the moment.
The other hand slid and hovered over his throat
He then turned and said, “You said you didn’t want to talk, and I’m fine with that. I already apologized anyway, so I’m okay.”
Snape was sitting at his desk, not looking up from where he was as he wrote determinedly on parchment. He was frowning and gave Harry a disapproving, withering stare as he approached his desk. Harry tried not to appear as timid as he felt.
Malfoy audibly barked a laugh and grinned. He proposed, “How do you figure?”
“You’d rather not go to class?” Harry challenged. “Then don’t act shocked when you get failing grades and need me to tutor you!”
“This… us… whatever we’re doing,” Harry replied with unmasked annoyance.
“I heard you,” Malfoy said flatly.
It was about midway through the lesson. Harry had just finished explaining to Malfoy a powerful counter jinx for—for something—Harry was not thinking straight because Malfoy was biting the end of his quill.
Malfoy stopped rocking his hips, putting his hands on Harry’s chest. “We both know that won’t happen,” he said coolly, looking unbothered. He continued after a moment.
“You’ve got it all wrong if you think I’m complimenting you, Potter,” Malfoy snapped. “I’m talking strictly about grades and experience. And yes, I could go elsewhere. But I’d rather my father didn’t know about my needing a tutor.”
With that, Malfoy kissed Harry roughly. It took him by surprise but it also caused a wonderful new feeling to spread through him. He felt Malfoy hand slide up his back and bury themselves in his messy hair.
Malfoy now smirked. His hand on Harry's leg and looked at him oddly.
“No reason,” Harry said hurriedly. "I just... never thought he would do that."
Harry felt a bit guilty. "Sorry. A lot on my mind right now is all."
“Well,” Harry whispered.
Harry rounded on him for a moment but then realized his eyes were gleaming with good humor. Again, Harry felt guilty for the second time that day.
Malfoy rolled his eyes, came up behind him and grabbed his hair. He pulled on it.  “So very funny and observant of you, Potter. Smart Potter always has his quipps, hmm?”
,” she said, in a squealing voice.
At last, he spoke: “No, I want you to admit it,” Malfoy chided in a decided tone. “Admit you want me. Admit you aren’t doing this just to tutor me.”
“Don’t,” Harry said, and was aware of how in-pain he sounded. “Here is not the place for this sort of conversation.”
“Thought you went to bed,” Harry said. “You’ve got an early class, don’t you?”
“So, that’s it?” Harry asked. “We just proceed with lessons as usual and I don’t get my answers?”
Gasping, Harry tilted his head and ran his tongue along Malfoy’s lower lip experimentally. He found himself pulling Malfoy on top of him again. He could hardly believe that his raging hormones would allow him to simply sit here and be kissed by none other than Draco Malfoy.
Hermione looked extraordinarily anxious about the situation. She was shifting in her seat.
Harry was never in a relationship with anyone besides Cho and Ginny, and both of those ended quickly. Besides, he was never with another man. Shuffling, he moved a bit closer to Draco cautiously.
Harry quickly threw his cloak on the floor. "I'm fine," He lied. He crawled into his own bed, his face still warm.
When they pulled away, Harry just stood there with his arms awkwardly out where they had been on Malfoy’s hips. He felt angry, not with Malfoy, but with himself to allow him to go along with Malfoy’s antics. It wasn’t like he liked it.
“If you need us, you can come get us,” Ron assured. “Do you want us to wait down here?”
“Oh?” Malfoy jeered. “What did he say, then? You two good friends now?”
“Oh!” Harry practically gasped. “Merlin!”
“Kind of?” he asked, raising his eyebrows as he opened the book and flipped to the proper page. He pondered this, then shrugged, “Couldn’t tell you.”
Harry paused, waiting for him to go on, but when he didn’t, asked exasperatedly, “So?”
“Fine,” Harry said.
Harry used his other hand to jerk him off.
"I do."
Sitting up, Ron wiped his eyes but, upon seeing Harry’s face, began to look more serious.
Harry sat at a reasonable distance from him.
Harry was shaking with anger. The week’s pent-up anger toward Snape and stupid Malfoy, who he just could not seem to get away from, was taking over and he wanted nothing more to deck him. One good solid punch ought to do the trick—
His lips felt tingly. He could hardly believe he was thinking about Malfoy of all people.
“At least he put a little excitement into your day,” Hermione shrugged.
“Go on,” Harry encouraged. He felt
“I’ll show you, Weasel!” Malfoy snarled, “Don’t you dare talk badly about my mum, or I swear you will suddenly find yourself unable to have children.”
Malfoy launched himself at Harry.
Ron relaxed, leaning back into the chair. "I got you, mate. No worries," He said, and offered an encouraging smile.
Harry lowered his hands a bit. “I am what?”
Harry shook his head. “I’ll be good.”
“You’re damn right it is,” Harry said determinedly.
Harry sputtered weakly, coughing, as the hand released him and—and it was Malfoy.
Malfoy was looking at him, but immediately turned to look back at the paper. He cleared his throat and half-heartedly nodded along with Harry.
Harry looked up and, to his surprise, so did Ron and Hermione to look at him eagerly. For once, they looked just as curious as Malfoy. He could have sworn he saw a couple of the other Gryffindors glance over in their direction too.
“Temper, temper,” Malfoy said lazily. “Just a simple observation.”
“I have been informed that you are not terrible at Defense Against the Dark Arts,” he went on, looking at his hand as though it were particularly interesting.
,” Hermione silenced him in a reprimanding voice. “I think Harry would like that part to be private. But, he wants some advice,”
“I’m warning you!” Malfoy snarled, and pulled out his wand. Harry, for some reason, did not feel too worried.
"What?" Harry said distractedly around a mouthful of pot pie.
Harry knew where this was going. He ground his teeth together, prepared for the name that was evidently floating to Ron's lips.
“I’m done talking about this,” Malfoy silenced him. “I elect we just act as though it never happened.”
Harry shrugged, watching Malfoy turn an even brighter pink—almost as pink as the potion—at his passiveness. “Okay.”
Malfoy grudgingly jotted some of that down, not looking up from where he was half-heartedly scribbling.
Zabini looked between them, seeming unsure as to what to do.
Ron stared at Harry. “Where are you going?”
“Mr. Potter! Mr. Malfoy! What are you— oh my, no! Absolutely not,” said a familiar voice that Harry recognized as Professor McGonagall. “Professor Snape, please help me. Boys! Boys!”
“And I don’t see you with one,” Harry replied smartly.
“You came over here to tell me that? Why?”
“I don’t understand,” Harry said very honestly. He tried to survey Malfoy’s face carefully, but his mouth remained set and firm as he gave away nothing. “You hate me.”
“Well. Wish me luck,” Harry said. He tucked his material under his arms. “If I don’t come back, I was killed by a pack of overly-confident Slytherins.”
Malfoy looked even more embarrassed, as if he had not been expecting this.
“You?” Malfoy looked doubtful. “At this point, I’d do better with Longbottom.”
Malfoy eyed him, his arms folded again in apprehension. He stayed quiet for a moment, his mouth remaining in a tight line.
Harry nodded slowly, still not speaking. He still did not understand but did not want to interject again.
Malfoy pushed himself so he was sitting in front of Harry. “So you don’t like her then?” He challenged, finally looking Harry in the eye. Malfoy looked different; normally he was so guarded. Right now, he appeared to be open, unmasked, and uncomfortably knowing. “You lied, then. You lied to me, Potter?”
Malfoy took the opportunity to kiss him again, this time grabbing a fistful of his untidy hair. This kiss was not nearly as tentative.
“Well, observe your textbook,” Harry stammered.
Malfoy kissed him, hands finding his chest—Harry’s hands stayed lamely at his side for a minute until he nudged forward, inches apart from one another.
Harry had no idea what was happening but it was all in a rush.
His words drove Harry insane. He felt like his skin was itching and burning and his trousers suddenly felt annoyingly tight. “Fine,” he said. “Then, you have to admit something too.”
“I think I should go.” Harry said quickly, suddenly uncomfortable. He was far too aware of Malfoy’s hands still on him.
Harry found himself irritated by this behavior. Especially when they both knew Malfoy was the one who had left his saliva and teeth marks all down the side of his throat.
“I know you don’t, Potter, that’s why I’m doing the thinking.”
Harry was relieved that Snape had not noticed this or he would have taken points from Gryffindor as well. Hermione was taking notes profusely and Ron would jot something down lazily every once in a while.
Malfoy was being stubborn, and Harry was tired of turning thoughts over in his head throughout the day. He was beginning to have a headache and, besides that, he has never felt such a level of confused anxiety.
Harry pretended to not care, sticking his nose deeper into his textbook. "How do you mean?" he asked innocently.
So, back to the Slytherin common room he went. Harry received several cold stares upon his entry and found Malfoy talking easily with Pansy Parkinson. She was staring at him with a dreamy, far-off look in her eyes that made Harry feel a small twinge of irritation.
Harry, however, felt that he wanted to approach him. He was still feeling angry about how Snape had berated him regarding tutoring Malfoy.
Harry nodded. “Sure,” he agreed, but his mind was nowhere near the game.
“She likes me, but I think she’s a bit air-headed,” he continued. “I don’t care for her like that.”
Harry tensed, ready to have to fight back. He waited for him to punch him, hex him, kick him, knee him—anything at all. He was ready to feel Malfoy’s wrath for all the times
“You’re not?” Malfoy asked, pulling his hips back. “I guess I won’t fuck you, then.”
Finally, he popped off and backed himself against the door. “Let's waste no time, Potter.”
says anything clever, you should know that, Crabbe.”
Ron crawled from his chair into bed. He stretched in his too-small pajamas and leaned back. "Nah, I'm good. Thanks, mate."
Malfoy tilted his head to look at him quizzically and, in that process, a piece of his hair that remained ungelled fell forward. “What’s the problem, professor?”
Harry felt weirdly unconcerned.
Harry tried to pry his hand away, but suddenly found it very difficult. His mind was foggy and befuddled.
Draco ignored Ron. He simply gave him a long stare and Harry noticed that he seemed thoroughly annoyed. “I don’t know why, honestly,” Draco replied, leaning back and crossing his arms over his chest. “She isn’t even pretty. Kind of snotty too, if you really think about it."
Malfoy pulled away, agonizingly slowly, and repeated in a hushed voice, “Shut up.”
Harry flipped to the next page. “Like I was saying, there are no cures for a werewolf bite. Not yet, anyway, I understand they’re still doing a lot of research for… Malfoy?”
Harry didn’t look at him but continued to scribble, shakily. “We only did that about half the time.”
Ron ran his hands through his hair, mussing it even more. He yawned. "Well what happened?"
Harry found it hard to focus in class that day. His mind was elsewhere, still running through the scenario repeatedly in his head. He found himself exceptionally confused on a number of levels.
Facing forward again, Harry raised his eyebrows and felt his cheeks grow warm. It was strange to hear the word love with Malfoy boring holes into him with his eyes. Harry could not read his expression, besides the sneer that was plastered on his mouth.
“Let me get you ready,” Malfoy mumbled and, for the first time since they had begun, they made eye contact and it felt raw. It was the most gentle Malfoy had sounded yet. “If that’s okay?”
“Sorry,” Harry mumbled after a moment, and stepped away. “Looks good—you— your work. It looks good and correct.”
Malfoy’s nostrils flared for a moment. He looked as though he had not expected to see Harry again. His face was guarded, jaw set tightly.
“Fine, fine, fine,” Hermione snapped and grabbed Ron’s arm. “Lets go, Ron. We need to let him do what he feels that he needs to do,” she said, casting Harry a look over her shoulder as she led Ron away.
Malfoy, the typically dominant, controlling, and confident Slytherin, was crying and whimpering like a small puppy. He kept begging, absolutely pleading for more.
“Yeah!” Ron said challengingly, glaring over Harry’s shoulder at Malfoy.
“Make a move, make a move,” Harry began to pace again, before asking aloud, “How the hell am I supposed to do that?”
Harry tried to reason himself back to being a tutor, a task that proved difficult. He knew that practicing with mirrors would them would allow Malfoy to become more easily disoriented, something he needed to know how to combat when studying defensive tactics.
“What?” Harry managed. He felt affronted.
Malfoy began to stammer uncharacteristically, as if trying to garner the strength for a snippy comment. "Didn't expect to look up and see you looking at me at lunch," He muttered bitterly, tossing his wand to the ground. “And no, I did not want to talk to you. Thought that was evident.”
Sitting up straighter, Harry leaned into Malfoy without getting too close, mind you. He had to lean away quickly though because suddenly Draco’s cologne seemed very, very strong.
But Harry, persistent as he was, wandered over to Malfoy’s desk by the end of the class (90 minutes of Snape blatantly picking on Neville and cutting off Hermione), trying to act nonchalant.
He clapped a hand over the other’s mouth and looked around to make sure nobody had heard that.
To his surprise, he could easily feel Malfoy’s pulse under his fingers. Harry looked down, feeling rather stupid at the way he was just holding Malfoy’s forearm.
“Look, mate, it’s weird. But it’s just classwork. If anything, Malfoy will just be his usually ass self,” Ron supported, propping himself up on his arms. “If you need me, though, I’m here.”
Snape stopped mid-sentence, as if he just noticed that Harry was the only student besides Malfoy leftover from class, and said, in a cold voice, “May we help you, Mr. Potter?”
Harry wedged his way between the two, who were practically inches apart and still cursing and spewing venomous insults.
Malfoy shrugged. “Wanted to,” he said, and uncharacteristically, leaned forward to kiss Harry on the cheek. “Problem?”
Professor McGonagall held her breath, looking as though she wanted to interrupt and put Snape’s demands to bed. At last, she spoke. "Severus, I don't find that appropriate..."
Tears rolled down his face. Harry pressed two fingers against Malfoy’s lips and the blonde happily opened them up to allow Harry to enter. The blonde sucked on them happily.
When he sat down in class, he was unaware of the people gaping at him until he saw that Ron had joined in.
Harry was sitting there with his head on his closed fist, unable to not smirk over at Malfoy. It was his turn to be coy. “What, you didn’t appreciate that?”
“Why?” Malfoy’s eyes narrowed accusingly.
Harry felt very offended that Malfoy was lying.
“Both of us,” Harry retorted.
Harry practically leapt up, but had to restrain himself to approach him coolly. He did not feel as sanguine as he tried to appear.
"Y'know," Malfoy commented, leaning forward to inhale, "this stuff smells funny. I wonder what it tastes like."
With that, he lifted Harry’s legs and laid him back against the desk, which was still littered with their books and parchment and ink.
“And he,” Snape uttered, “is demanding you out of his classroom at once.”
McGonagall looked appalled at being spoken to but pursed her lips. "I expect a proper explanation."
“Like, for sex?” Harry asked. He knew how dumb he sounded. “I would, but I’m tir—“
“You know,” Malfoy said suddenly. “Zabini went home for the weekend.”
“Not that Ron seems to notice that I’m a girl but—wait, what did you say?”
“Why do you like her so much? Even you could probably do better than her,” Draco argued, still not giving up. “Maybe a nice house-elf,” he mused.
Hermione took a sip of her tea. "You know, he has been acting quite strange today," She said, looking at each other then. "Earlier, he didn't say a single word during breakfast."
Then, he slunk away, not daring to look at Malfoy or Snape. His blood still felt hot and his skin seemed rather itchy. Over and over, he clenched and unclenched his hand around his wand in the pocket of his robes.
Harry stared back, eyes still wide as saucers. Their faces were only inches apart still and Draco was still partially holding him to the wall, his fingers digging into Harry’s arms through the robe.
“You don’t, do you?” Malfoy pressed against Harry’s entrance, which had been worked open skillfully.  “You don’t want all Hogwarts to know you’re a whore, right?”
At this point, Harry slammed his wand down against the table hard enough to at least make Malfoy look up, a sudden dark look in his eyes.
“Sorry, babe,” he said. “Duty calls.”
Malfoy’s own breathing had picked up by then but he just smirked. “I could tell by the way you look at me.”
make me smile and comment :)
Harry suddenly felt cold. Dark Arts and Malfoy’s father, who was a Death Eater,
Harry blinked stupidly. “What does that matter to me?”
Harry simply said, "Shut up, Malfoy."
Harry cursed.
“Help Mr. Malfoy, or I shall drop you a grade in Potions—”
Malfoy just hummed, throwing his arms around Harry’s neck and kissing along his cheek.
“Hell,” Harry said, using his feet to attempt to batter Malfoy but he seemed awfully persistent. He reached out and grabbed his shoulders, trying to wrench the other off of him. “I’d just love to see you try.”
It didn't sound convincing whatsoever but his voice was still cold and sharp.
Nobody was looking up, thankfully.
Malfoy shifted, pressing just the head against his entrance without pushing inside. The sensation made Harry squirm, he felt Malfoy effectively hold him still with two hands on either side of his waist. “But you are, right?”
“Turn. Around,” Harry said through his teeth. “I’m trying to help. And I’ll speak to you any way I want.”
Harry was lying on the floor with Malfoy awkwardly on top of him. Draco was staring wide-eyed. The fall seemed to snap him back to reality, causing him to appear highly horrified.
“What?” Harry snapped.
Harry was surprised by his defensiveness.
Harry dropped down in the chair, pulled his wand out of his robe and went on to take the textbook. “Alright, let’s begin…”
Harry, suddenly feeling brave, leaned down against Malfoy’s ear. “I want you to watch yourself get fucked, do you understand?” Harry continued, taunting him. “Imagine if your father could see you now, begging for Harry Potter’s cock.”
"Just Malfoy being himself.”
He sneered. “Typical savior complex.”
Zabini budged back into the way. “Problem, Malfoy? I knew he was up to no good. I just knew it,” he said excitedly, as if hoping to have to back-up a fight.
Then everyone was looking.
“I’m fine,” Malfoy snapped. “Move away from me.”
“He started it,” Harry began. His cheeks felt hot.
Please comment! Bookmark for updates! :)
But now, Harry could not think of what to ask.
“No!” he said, a bit too loudly. He immediately lowered his voice and glared at Hermione. “It’s nobody you know personally, and I’d like to just keep it that way if you two don’t mind.”
Harry’s face split into a grin. Relief washed through him as he watched Malfoy’s guard slip. "Like what?"
Harry stayed quiet again.
Malfoy exhaled heavily. “You don’t mind yourself with that, Potter,” he sniffed, and put his nose to the air. “Run off your little troll of a girlfriend.”
Malfoy’s own face was unreadable. His features gave away nothing, which made the situation even worse. Harry’s stomach twisted
Harry, who did not wait for him to question him uncomfortably, unleashed a miniature rant (not directed at Ron, he reassured his friend) about Malfoy’s proposal courtesy of Snape.
Harry attempted to enjoy his last couple nights of freedom but his mind was unwillingly plagued with Malfoy and Snape and cursing whoever had decided it was okay to put him in this predicament.
Malfoy just smirked. “Is that a direct order,
Malfoy’s eyebrows drew together. “You’re jumpy,” he said. “Why is that?”
Harry sat down in Snape’s class the next day, the presence of Malfoy behind him almost mocking. The two had parted the day before acting as though not much had happened, other than some absent-minded flirting that Harry wrote off as Malfoy attempting to diffuse the tension; that, or a few well-timed insults.
Harry looked back to the front of the room.
Hermione and Ron had both voiced their concern for Harry and Malfoy’s latest conflict, as Harry had expected.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Honestly, Potter, you’re so daft at times.”
“Oh, and I’m really looking forward to this too,” Malfoy remarked, giving Harry an annoyed look as he crossed his arms. After a moment, he huffed and tucked his wand pointedly  into his pocket. “Tonight at seven in the Slytherin common room?”
Harry began to nod.
It took Harry a few long seconds to realize that he might have meant it. Did he like Malfoy? He had called Ron poor, purposely got Hagrid in trouble, called Hermione a wizarding slur, and had disrespected his parents.
Harry nodded. Only then did he realize just how ridiculous he sounded. He rubbed at the back of his neck uncomfortably.
“You need more than just passing to get a decent job in the Ministry,” Harry tried to muster, but it came out stammering and weak. “You said that’s what you want to do.”
Harry huffed. "Just a bit. It'll be worn off by tomorrow. It was only a sip."
Harry looked to Ron, who was staring in bewilderment. Hermione also had stopped eating and held her fork inches from her lips, mouth agape.
He trailed off as Malfoy pressed his hips against his own. He began to rock them absently, making Harry clutch at his robes. He could get used to this, he thought, as his head leaned back and hit the wall painfully.
Malfoy looked pleased with himself, as if he didn’t always. “I suppose that’ll do.”
“Do not patronize me, Potter,” Malfoy growled. “I’m just telling you as it is. And, I ask you not to involve yourself with my fellow Slytherins. What’s my business is just that—mine.”
His head was foggy. He knew that he had perhaps jumped the gun on walking out on Malfoy, but Harry had his own studying to do, and Quidditch to practice for, and something of a social life, and-- and he was making excuses for Malfoy’s behavior. Which he did not need to do.
Malfoy grew angrier, his own wand still half aloft. “Call your ginger friend off, and let’s go discuss next week’s assignment. I find it will be easier if we clear things up.”
,” Malfoy said in annoyance. “I need a tutor. Because I’m failing it, and I’d rather my father didn’t find a failing grade on my report card,” the blonde remarked, as if everything he was saying was entirely obvious without any sort of explanation. “I’ll pay you of course.”
“That was—wow.”
He then kissed Harry. In a different way. Not his usual, hard and needy one. He kissed Harry softly, in a way that made his stomach feel light and fluffy instead of hot and tight.
Harry pulled his robe away. “And I said it’s nothing,” he said, more firmly this time. He was surprised by how stern he had sounded and could chalk that up to the sudden panic he was feeling. “Don’t worry about it.”
Malfoy glanced at him. “I’m still listening, just taking notes,” he said. “Go on.”
Harry exhaled and looked off.
Ron sat beside Harry. “Yeah, just couldn’t sleep. Was waiting on you,” he said, rubbing his eyes and looking at them blearily. “What are you two talking about?”
“What do you think?” Harry was almost shocked by his confidence, or maybe it was Malfoy’s reaction that made him feel so comfortable speaking to him like this. “You think it would be humiliating for your father to find you writhing underneath Harry Potter, taking his cock so very well?”
“I’ll be fine,” he said to Hermione again.
Malfoy, scowling, slouched toward Harry and sat down in the seat beside him without a word. He propped his head on his fist.
“What?” Harry snapped. “You think I don’t have enough going on without that one relentlessly making rude comments about my parents? Of course Snape just wanted to make me miserable, though.”
Comment please! make my day :)
Harry paused. Malfoy—did he like Harry? That had to be the only explanation for all this strange behavior. But, there was just no way, Harry convinced himself.
Their tutoring lessons went on, however, now they were considerably more uncomfortable. Harry made sure to keep his distance, sitting nearly three feet away from Malfoy at all times.
Malfoy whitened and stepped forward, until he was nose-to-nose with Harry. To his own resentment, Harry felt himself glance down at his lips—briefly, Harry reasoned with himself— then back up at him. “Don’t,” Malfoy spat. “You even dare.”
“None of your business, Potter. Contrary to what Snape says, Potter,” Malfoy sneered, looking down at Harry in disgust. “I was better on my own.”
“It’s not worth it.”
“Right.”
Malfoy stopped squirming and said coolly, “That’s supposed to scare me?”
Hermione and Ron whitened, mumbling a sorry to Snape as they got up.
But, he couldn’t bring himself to care because Malfoy was holding onto him and he could feel his hands trailing around him lazily.
Harry was amused for a brief moment. “I’ll take anything above failing at all.”
Malfoy lifted his eyes though still avoided eye contact. “Still, I don’t like her,” He said, and Harry could tell that he was willing to argue; he seemed to be looking for an argument. He had always been very stubborn after all. Perhaps this is what this had all been about: Malfoy had not had much of a chance to make Harry’s life hell lately beside the tutoring fiasco.
Harry was blissfully aching. His heart was pounding unceasingly.
Harry looked at his desk. He awkwardly pulled at his collar again while Ron continued to poke at him to get his attention.
Much as the thought pained him, Harry came to the realization that night that he would have to apologize—he winced—to Malfoy. He had been avoiding him all week, more than usual, and had even neglected to show up to their tutoring session.
Harry snorted. He couldn’t imagine why, but the thought of a hundred girls trying to get at Malfoy made him feel bothered. Made him annoyed, made his cheeks flush red, and his throat dry. He exhaled, trying to push the thought away.
Snape raised his eyebrows but did not reprimand them.
“Nothing,” Harry said quickly, right as Hermione informed Ron that—
Hermione eyed him wearily. “Okay,” she said grudgingly. “If you say so. But just come get us if you need us! We won’t be far, I think we should be able to hurry back. And--”
Malfoy smirked. “I’m good, aren’t I? I just knew that I’d be able to make you scream and—“
Harry watched the two and gave Hermione a sympathetic look.
“I can see you did too,” Harry found himself saying, nodding down at the front of Malfoy’s robes.
Harry let go. “Sorry,” he said, and pulled out.
He could already hear Hermione chiding in his head to leave it alone. He could also hear Ron cursing Malfoy under his breath and trying to get Harry away from him.
Snape tapped the desk with his wand sharply. "Potter," He said. "Ten points from Gryffindor for daydreaming in my class."
“Sorry,” Harry murmured. “It, er, was bothering me. We can continue.”
Ron shrugged. “Maybe he just thought you have more experience with You-Know-Who. He’d know about that, now wouldn’t he?” he added, a bit sarcastically.
Draco suddenly looked coy. "Well, what about you? I heard you're dating Weasley's sister."
“Yeah, thanks for the inspiration on that,” Harry chided.
Harry laid on his back in the bed that night. He stared at the ceiling. Ron was talking in the bed over from him, but Harry was only absentmindedly listening and nodding every once in a while.
Malfoy covered his mouth, silencing Harry effectively. Harry did not bother to fight this.
“I’ve been tutoring Malfoy in the Slytherin common area, you know this,” Harry snapped. “His preference not mine. Also, not very clever of a password. Sea serpent? Quite pathetic.”
“Hmm—oh!” Harry leaned over his shoulder to check his equations.
“Oh.”
Malfoy laid on top of Harry, lazily kissing him.
“You too,” Malfoy said, equally as awkward.
It wasn’t until Harry had been walking down the corridors after class, mindless as his thoughts were elsewhere, when two hands grabbed him by the neck of his robes. He felt his throat tighten as his tie was forcibly yanked into a side-passage.
“So—so, yeah!” Harry said feebly. “Just shut up about all the nonsense, and just talk to me about what is going on. I want answers.”
Surely not anybody else on the staff? Dumbledore never was too interested in his and Malfoy’s arguments and would have nothing to gain from pairing them up.
Zanini opened their door and immediately bristled. “Potter,” he said sourly. “What are you doing in the Slytherin dormitory? Who gave you the password.”
“I find this conversation to be highly unhelpful,” Harry said.
Harry had just stopped thinking about whatever Snape had been talking to Malfoy about, sitting alone at the dining hall as he had missed dinner with his friends, when an unwelcome reminder approached him.
Harry leaned back, crossing his arms. “Not much else I can do about that.”
Harry’s heart sank. He cleared his throat. “Erm, what do you think she ought to do?”
Harry demonstrated it, drawing a barrier around their table. He dropped the charm and then turned to Malfoy. “Your turn,” he said.
Harry hummed.
“Not that it would be a problem if she and I were—”
The Slytherin’s expression was stony. “Yes. He did.”
Zabini just seemed shocked, then embarrassed as he lowered his eyes and tried to scoot out of the way. He evidently had not expected to be between something personal between the two.
Harry looked up to find that Ron and Hermione had already scooted close together. Annoyed, he thought he would go to Neville but he saw that he was crouched together with Luna. He turned around.
He had told the two that he wanted to talk with Dumbledore and, to his relief, neither of them seemed like they wanted to inquire further on that matter.
They made their way to Professor Snape's room after lunch. When the bell rang, Malfoy still wasn't in his seat. It wasn't maybe a minute or two later that he burst through the doors, aghast, and fumbled to his seat.
He slid his fingers into his hair, giving a tug a bit harder than he intended. Instead of flinching away, though, Malfoy let out a soft moan around him—almost as if he liked that. So Harry did it again.
“It seemed you had ideas other than talking,” Malfoy said.
Harry squirmed in place, letting out furious grunts and curses. To top it all off, he couldn’t reach his wand, damn it all to hell.
Instead, Harry stood, until he was almost nose-to-nose with the blonde. “It’s none of your concern who I’m sleeping with,” he said, and then dropped his voice so low only the two of them could hear it. “Isn’t that right, Draco?”
Harry realized with some mild amusement that Malfoy’s arrogance and cockiness would refuse to ever  budge and that alone made Harry want to curse him.
They both grew quiet. Harry shuffled a bit closer to try to get a better view and, as a result, Malfoy tensed immeasurably.
“That isn’t fair!” Harry protested, leaping out of his chair. “It’s not my fault he’s struggling in class!”
“I’m tired of this,” Malfoy complained, looking up as he paused from his work along Harry’s neck. “I’m bored. Entertain me.”
He gathered his books and cast a final look in their direction. Malfoy met his eyes unwaveringly, which narrowed into dark slits similarly to Snape’s before Harry continued on his way.
“Oh, will you?” Harry asked.
Malfoy didn't smile, but he did light up quite a bit. It was evident in his eyes when he pushed his hair away. His features seemed less threatening suddenly.
“Put your wand down,” Harry replied tightly, trying and failing to keep his voice steady. “Now.”
Malfoy just shrugged. “See you around, Potter.”
“Oh?” Hermione said, then spoke quickly as if she were reciting lines. “I thought Snape wanted you to work with him til the end of the semester? He said he’d drop your grade, Harry!”
Harry hesitated, nervous to go on with Malfoy so utterly irritated before him. "So... You do like me? Like, actually?”
“Well, I do know girls, considering I am one.”
Malfoy smirked. He slid back down into his chair. “Yes, professor.”
“Are you sure?” she asked, looking worried.
Harry reddened and allowed himself to be kissed.
Harry slammed his book shut. "He drank a bit of the love potion."
Harry breathed out and put his head in the crook of Malfoy’s neck. He always forgot how significantly taller Malfoy was by comparison to him. He smelled quite good, Harry noted to himself; he would never admit this to him, though.
"So Harry," Hermione began. "Ron told me you met with Malfoy..."
Malfoy now glared, the anger returning to his eyes. “Potter, I don’t need this right now.”
Malfoy’s eyes were unreadable as he met Harry’s stare challengingly and, as a result, Harry wrung his hands.
He cleared his throat, shaking his head a bit. He refocused his eyes on his textbook for Transfiguration; the words, however, seemed fuzzy on the page.
Harry was dumbfounded, absolutely embarrassed and finding his hands shaky. He tried to busy himself by re-reading over the potion instructions—even though they were already done. “Stop that.”
“I’m trying to check your homework, Malfoy,” Harry said back with equal annoyance, but he could still feel Malfoy’s eyes on him. “You did just ask me, after all.”
Malfoy sneered, delivering a withering look at Harry. “You don’t tell me what to do, Potter,” he said. “I’m afraid that’s not in the cards right now.”
“Potter, Potter,” Malfoy drawled abruptly, giving Harry a small start. Harry looked up, annoyed, to see the blonde staring down at him condescendingly with a more-than-noticeable smirk. “So good to see you.”
Malfoy snarled. “It just—felt—like—it felt like the appropriate thing to do.”
“If I knew, I would tell you!”
Malfoy and his friends laughed wildly. Crabbe and Goyle banged their fists obnoxiously on the table while Harry delivered a scathing stare to Malfoy.
Malfoy exited thirty minutes prior to their first class. His hair was less gelled than usual, his eyes bright and cunning per usual, and his textbooks held to his chest.
Malfoy looked at him in a way that made Harry feel uncomfortably naked.
Harry’s stomach was in a knot the entire way to the Great Hall.
“Yes, sir,” Malfoy replied shortly.
“We’ll see,” Harry said.
Malfoy just looked bored now. He was beginning to impatiently run his hands through his hair. “That’s the most I’ll understand, so I’ll take it,” he said nonchalantly.
Malfoy caught his eye. “What, Potter?”
“Malfoy,” Snape remarked. “I trust you not to… fool around when it comes to such serious matters. You and Potter can deal with your arguments outside of my classroom.”
Malfoy eyed him. “What?” he asked, somewhat self-consciously.
“So? I was buying your time, not the other way around,” Malfoy said.
Malfoy's reaction surprised Harry. Instead of being his usual pale self, a bright pink washed high into his cheeks. He coughed slightly, purposely turning his head and trying to twist his mouth into a scowl.
“Kiss me?”
“Glad we’re finally seeing eye to eye,” Harry said coolly. “So, are you prepared to talk?”
Harry silenced them with a smoldering stare.
Harry did not miss Draco. Not even a little bit. Not the late night make-out sessions or teaching him how to properly ward off trolls or watching him change back into his suit. None of that.
Harry leaned back, observing Malfoy. He had a slight flush on his cheeks and his white-blonde hair was frizzy. "Quite," he said at last. "I mean... I thought you hate me."
“Honestly, Harry,” Hermione said, and Ron and he exchanged looks before Hermione went off on a tangent about how their grades were important for their future careers and… and then Harry’s thoughts began to wander.
Ron started to grin. "Wait, wait... So Malfoy was coming onto you?"
Harry laughed weakly. “Yeah, true.”
“Okay?”
Malfoy glared at him. "Oh, shut up. Like I said. So fucking full of yourself. Harry Potter, so high and mighty. The stupid Chosen One.”
Harry let out a quiet noise that sounded like a cross between a gasp and a cry. “No!” he pleaded, trying and failing to not sound miserably needy. “Just come on and do it, Malfoy, please. You know I’m a whore now, okay? So just do it.”
Harry just finished washing up and was beginning to get ready to sit on his bed, when he heard a noise. He heard yelling between Ron and a familiar voice that made him feel cold.
Malfoy snatched the money back. He pocketed it, his shoulders back and his chest forward.
Harry gave a short, disgruntled laugh.
“So?” Malfoy narrowed his eyes. “Since when do you care if you upset me?”
Malfoy smirked, never failing to pick at Harry’s blunders. “Oh, fantastic English, Potter,” he sneered. “So good to have a proper tutor.”
Maybe he should just leave it alone at least, Harry thought.
Harry blinked. Make a move on Draco Malfoy?
“Only a couple lessons, that’s it,” Harry cut him off. He definitely did not want to do it and he was growing more wary by the second, but it was money and Harry could use it for over the summer.
“Okay,” Malfoy said harshly, angry and flustered again. He fell back away from Harry, breathing harshly with his white hair in front of his eyes. “Yeah.”
Ron and Hermione gawked at him.
Harry continued to look at him blankly, but instead of Malfoy taunting him further, he came over and cupped his face. He crouched down. “Would you like to stay with me?”
“Shut up! Would you just shut up? It’s your own fault that you’re acting like a damn fool,” Harry snapped.
Harry was intent, however, on flipping to the correct pages in the textbook. “You said it earlier Malfoy, let's just get this over with, shall we?”
“I’m going to confront him again,” Harry said determinedly. He ignored Hermione’s pleads to just let it go. Ron even offered to take him on in a match for Quidditch but for some reason, he could not bring himself to drop it.
“She likes you, you think you like her, you’ve kissed, but you don’t want to get together, but there is chemistry, and you’re curious about what could come of it?” Ron echoed after Harry recited the story to him, Hermione still looking at them wide-eyed.
“Especially to you.”
Harry could not understand what Malfoy was going on about. Again, his mind was racing and he asked, in genuine confusion, "What's wrong with me looking at you?”
Harry gasped into his mouth, not expecting this at all. And Malfoy took the opportunity to slide his tongue into his mouth. The warm sensation was new and different, and Malfoy continued to pull on his hair with one hand and stroke the
Harry gasped when he felt Malfoy against him, trying helplessly to push back against him. “No.”
He was panting, red-hot with anger.
“Well, I hardly think you were possessed by another being,” Harry said coolly. “Use that brain now, no matter how difficult that is for you.”
“Did you hear me?”
“Damn you,” Malfoy mumbled. He ran a hand through his hair, disrupting the gel that had it in place. “Stupid Potter.”
They stared at each other for a moment. A heavy silence had filled the room besides Malfoy’s rough breathing.
“I’m not doing as bad in that class as you think, Potter,” Malfoy said. “Don’t get high and mighty on me.”
“You too,” Harry rounded on him, which led to a great amount of shock and offense etching into Ron’s face. He wavered, only lowering his arm before Harry delivered a stern look.
Harry sat up abruptly too. “I don’t know why I even bothered,” Harry said. “I really don’t. I knew that Snape would have just had it in for me.”
“Correct,” Harry said dryly. “Thanks for that.”
Malfoy looked tense as his eyes flicked down and back up, staring at Harry’s hand as though it were a foreign object. "Don't touch me, Potter."
Harry’s heart was beating fast. “No.”
What? Harry kicked himself. He groaned inwardly.
He would never comprehend how he was able to see right through Malfoy, yet his friends would continue to regard in a god-like manner. Abruptly, Harry was grateful that Ron and Hermione were not with him.
Harry’s mind grew fuzzy. For a second, he could not process what Malfoy was telling him. “What?”
“We’re going to start with a basic charm,” Harry said. “The Imperturbable Charm was a charm that created an invisible magical barrier around an object, such as a door.  Objects would bounce off of the barrier, and it also muffled sounds. The incantation is obice circa.”
Harry was biting his lip to hold back his moans. “Hurry, please.”
He looked far away, looking past Harry as if he were trying to gather his words. Then, a slight blush, crawled over his cheeks and Harry couldn’t help but smile a little bit.
"Malfoy," Harry said through his teeth. "You great ass! Why did you do that?"
After all, this was Malfoy. This was Malfoy, who had punched him, called Hermione’s slurs, and had made malicious comments about his parents. Stupid, mindless kisses between them had meant nothing and it was done with.
Harry just silently nodded. He felt too overwhelmed to speak.
Malfoy raised his eyebrows. “Go on.”
A week went by.
Malfoy just raised an eyebrow, looking most displeased at the fact that Harry had just told him to do something.
Then, Malfoy laughed. Not his smug kind, either. A real one.
"I want to kiss you, Potter."
“I’ll see how much of you I can handle,” Harry added, trying to match Draco’s heat and feeling a bit idiotic at his weak comebacks. He was shaken by the fact that Malfoy would even approach him for a favor, a favor in public nonetheless.
Harry just stared, his hands balled into fists.
Malfoy’s smirk widened. “Oh,” he said, “that just makes loads of sense.”
Instead, he looked rather abashed and began to eat hastily. Harry turned back to his food as well, not realising that Hermione and Ron had picked up on what happened.
“How the hell are you supposed to do what, Potter?” Malfoy drawled, and Harry jumped. He had not heard him enter.
Harry felt oddly relieved and allowed them to lapse into silence.
“This time,” Harry began, before Malfoy could say anything. “You’ll listen to me. This time, you won’t just goof off, and not pay attention, or–”
Harry silently wanted that.
“Who is she?” Malfoy asked in a soft voice.
Harry could not imagine, he thought as he tilted his head up, how ridiculous he must look with Malfoy kissing at his neck. He closed his eyes, chest heaving still.
“Will you let me speak?” Malfoy retorted.
Harry wanted him from those words alone and, resisting the urge to slide into his lap, focused on flipping through the pages.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry’s head was pounding suddenly as he attempted to process all of that. He was only acutely aware of Malfoy standing feet away from them, arms-folded tightly.
Malfoy froze and Harry pulled his hand back as if he had been burned badly. Malfoy’s face was pressed together in confusion, his eyebrows drawn together, his mouth in a quizzical frown and his nose scrunched.
“Move, Potter,” Malfoy said coldly again, but his voice sounded a bit creaky as though he were recovering but a particularly bad cold. “Your—shadow, hard to see my paper.”
When Harry did not move, Malfoy yanked his hand away. “What are you doing? Stop touching me! I have no problem decking you again,” he threatened. “In fact, I’d quite enjoy it.”
“Okay, I’m sorry,” Harry said, in a rush. “I’m sorry about what I said about Pansy and you. I wasn’t trying to insinuate anything at all, and I know it’s your business.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“What, you mean Pansy?" Malfoy asked, surprising Harry, and giving a noncommittal snort of near-disgust. "Yeah, right. She's entirely full of herself and never thinks of anyone else. Honestly, I only hang around her because she would fail her classes without me."
Malfoy, whose eyes were dark with something Harry couldn’t name, grinned.
“Okay,” Malfoy said. “You apologized. You can leave.”
Harry suddenly felt very anxious. He looked over, double-checking to make sure that Pansy was indeed out of the room. “You have to be more careful. We have to keep this a secret,” Harry said, hearing the worry in his own voice. “This can’t get out.”
Collecting his things, he stormed out of the class and slammed the door behind him. While Harry's thoughts were swimming, he still heard Ron behind him: "See? That's the Malfoy I've come to know.”
Harry was very aware of Malfoy’s eyes on him as he left the room. Feeling stupid, he tore out of the Slytherin common room while ignoring the judgemental, suspicious eyes on him as he left.
Harry blinked, dazed. “What?”
Malfoy covered his mouth again, more forcefully this time. It drowned out a lot of his noises but it did not stop his small grunts each time Malfoy re-entered him.
Harry ducked his head. "Sorry to wake you."
Crabbe and Goyle had paired. It left him alone with Malfoy. Not that, at this point, he minded but it would be weird for all others if they saw the two acting kind to one another.
Hermione just scowled at Ron.
“What?” Malfoy asked.
After a few seconds of silence, Harry said, “Yes, professor?”
Malfoy whirled on him. “Well, maybe if I had a better tutor, I would be able to.”
Harry pretended to be cleaning up some of his mess from class, wiping off bits of troll fur from the desk. He caught bits of the two’s conversation. “Dark Arts… ridiculous… failing… disappointed... your father.”
“You wouldn’t,” Malfoy repeated accusingly. “Don’t.”
Harry reddened at the very thought.
Harry felt his stomach twist uncomfortably. “I was just trying to do the right thing.”
“It’s having no effect on me,” Malfoy said coolly. “Is it?”
Harry almost felt as though all of his movements were sluggish. It seemed as though he were watching from the outside as he slid closer to Malfoy, leaning over him in the armchair.
“That, or a good stunning spell—“
“‘Fraid so, if I’d like to keep on passing Defense Against the Dark Arts,” he simpered. He patted her, almost degradingly, on her head. “I’ll have more free time tomorrow, thankfully.”
Malfoy nodded curtly. "I think that should work," He said, seeming to be acting much more amiable than usual. He seemed much more cheerful now, almost grinning. “This way we will be alone.”
“Because, what started out as you picking up some extra change has turned into an addiction for my cock,” Malfoy said, each word enunciated with a press of his lips to Harry’s neck. “But, if that’s what you want… So be it.”
Harry just stared at him, giving him as little of a reaction as possible. “We know that’s not true,” he said. “What do you want?”
“I hate this,” Malfoy growled. “These mirrors are so disorienting. I can’t do this.”
Harry yawned and raised his arms over his head. He pulled his sweater, which drooped over his hands, around him.
It was back to snarky comments and dull remarks about the homework. A bizarre feeling had settled over the room.
" 'Arry? Bloody hell," He faced him and blinked tiredly. "Harry? You look like you've seen a ghost."
Hermione and Ron exchanged uneasy looks.
Harry was now sure he was red. He began to stutter from the heat of Draco's hand just next to his thigh. "Malfoy, stop. You're going to regret doing this.”
“So,” Harry challenged once they had gone. “How did that test go?”
Malfoy went red.
Even Malfoy looked abashed as he was spoken to, Snape looking at him disapprovingly through eyes squinted so hard that they almost appeared closed.
“And—Potter?” he asked, just as Harry began to walk away, now more frustrated than before.
At least not until Draco leaned forward, attempting to push himself onto Harry. Harry, trying to push him back, was unsuccessful. Grabbing onto him to keep his balance, it caused them both to fall out of their chairs.
Yet, recently, there had been a sadness in his eyes that Harry could not deny being curious about. And they had been fucking for almost two months now without any sort of label.
Harry took a shaky breath and turned to Crabbe and Goyle. “Want to hear a little fun fact about your friend over there, mates? Well--”
They leaned back as they let it set.
“I’m not the one going over to him during breakfast,” Harry muttered.
“Then, we need to talk about your tutoring,” Harry retorted, choosing his words extraordinary carefully. “Now. And I’d like to not put it off.”
He stalked away, his pockets now jangling loud with the sounds of the Galleons.
It was Malfoy who broke the silence with a soft, but tense, “Would you just kiss me?”
Malfoy just opened up his book and grabbed a quill. Admittedly, he already looked more studious and attentive tonight.
Harry gave a long exhale. He fiddled with his wand nervously, wondering if he would be using it tonight against Malfoy—you never know with him. “I just think it’s strange. I’m good at Defense, but everyone knows Hermione is top of our class regardless.”
Harry raised his eyes. “Oh?”
“You’re kind of a bottom at times,” Harry commented.
“You won’t hurt me, Malfoy,” Harry said, surprised at the confidence in his voice. “Just like you won’t just move your arm away.”
He leaned back, as if scanning Harry’s face for a reaction. His eyes were wide, his pale cheeks suddenly a darker pink. His chest heaved as though he were out of breath.
“Okay…” she said slowly. “What is it?”
Malfoy looked to be fighting a grin. “Yes, Potter, I forgive you,” he said.
Harry regarded him wearily. Malfoy was now looking far more confident than he was comfortable with. His throat felt cottony and dry. “What?”
They sat close for a few minutes, unsure of what to do. After so long of wanting to kill each other, it seemed dangerous to speak for fear of their momentary tethering truce would shatter.
Harry jumped, grabbing the container from Malfoy and looking to see if Snape had seen. He was busy reprimanding Neville for turning his green.
, a small voice said in his head.
“I don’t have to tutor you.”
“Yeah,” Hermione said without looking up. “He said he was tired out from Quidditch.”
Malfoy gave an uncharacteristic whine—Harry almost did not recognize the sound as it came from him—and leaned close. "But I want to kiss you."
Harry was silent, choosing to not dwell on that last part.
Harry, not turning his back on the other as though afraid he would jump him, collected his belongings and rushed out of the Slytherin common room as though Peeves the Poltergeist were chasing him down the corridors.
Well. Five minutes later, it was affecting him.
"You'll get one," Snape said. He then turned to Harry again.
Malfoy snorted into his hands. He was quiet and then mumbled a small, “Thank you.”
“Right,” Malfoy said hastily. “Well, I suppose that cleared up nothing.”
“Malfoy,” Harry started. With embarrassment, he heard his breath hitch. “Anyone could see us.”
Malfoy stared disdainfully at the parchment. He set the quill down, pushed the parchment away, and turned his stare onto Harry. “I’ve got something less boring.”
And, he was right. Malfoy liked that quite a bit. He let out another approving sound before he continued to move his head agonizingly slowly.
“That good, huh?” Ron ventured.
Harry felt a small surge of irritation. “Shut up,” he snapped, and was quieted with a particular rough thrust.
“Like what?”
“Don’t start a fight with him, please,” Hermione pleaded. “Just please try to keep it tame.”
A different voice startled Harry.
Harry’s mind was foggy. He swallowed thickly and exhaled. “Well,” he said. “Now that you’ve had your fun, finish your paper.”
Harry stiffened. Then, he rolled his eyes. “Don’t look at me like that.”
“What the hell?” Malfoy snapped. He stared darkly at Harry.
That would be a positive thing, Harry tried to tell himself half-heartedly.
“You tutoring Malfoy tonight?” Ron asked at last, which only soured Harry’s mood further.
“Thank you, Ron,” Harry said and strode out, not turning to look at Malfoy until they were halfway down the hallway. His head and heart were pounding and he was aware of Malfoy’s heavy breathing at his side.
could not be a promising conversation.
When Malfoy did finally pull away, he managed to immediately slant his eyes away and clear his throat awkwardly.
Malfoy was stubborn, crossing his arms. “Yes, you apologized. Why?”
He had meandered back to the Gryffindor common room, and then into his room, where he found Ron lying back on the bed, snacking per usual. He greeted Harry brightly but seemed to notice immediately that Harry was in a foul mood.
“Harder,” Harry found himself saying. “Just… harder.”
“No, come on,” Malfoy challenged. “If you’ve got a problem, just come out and say it.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Big words. Very boring, Potter.”
Malfoy looked down grudgingly. Harry had the feeling he was pink as well.
“No, sir,” Harry said quickly, broken from his trance. “I was just cleaning up. I’ll be on my way.”
Harry’s pride prevented him from correcting himself. He remained rooted at the spot and fought the run after him.
“Very mature, Potter,” Snape said sarcastically. “Unfortunately, I may not have been direct as I should have been.”
Harry only then realized that his hands were shaking. He could barely feel as though he could get a breath in but at the same time, he was becoming very aware of his breath coming in quick pants.
He hated how he was acting; it was sheerly embarrassing. Harry reasoned with himself, trying to tell himself that it was just a kiss and nothing to get worked up over. They had both agreed
Ron looked utterly lost now. He kept swinging his head back and forth between Harry and Malfoy, as if half-expecting one of them to explode at any moment.

Harry stopped, shifting on his feet. “I’ll only stay if you admit it.”
“Malfoy, I don’t think—“
“Of course, I have to do all the work,” Malfoy continued. “He’s too busy daydreaming about the Weasley girl to even try to focus.”
“You’re too cocky. Someone needs to take you down a notch,” he snarked. “I can easily learn to hate you again, believe you me.”
Harry scowled then, nerves vanishing suddenly and wondering how he thought that he could have possibly had a thing for Malfoy.
Harry then rolled his eyes. “Shut up now, before you ruin it.”
Malfoy cast Harry a confident look. He looked far too pleased with himself and Harry was half-tempted to try to break out of McGonagall’s surprisingly firm grip.
Ron made some violent punching motions to demonstrate.
Jeering, Malfoy crossed his arms over his chest. "Why would I want to talk to you?" He asked, loud enough for half the class to hear. It certainly earned him some wanted attention.
(See the end of the chapter for
"You really seemed like you didn't want to talk to me today in class," Harry replied, then added. "And you looked a little unnerved during lunch."
Harry made a point to snap his mouth shut, pursing his lips tightly.
“And he refuses to listen,” Harry snapped at once, immediately regretting it.
Snape just had a dark expression on his face, looking furiously at Harry as the scuffle was entirely his fault—which, Harry thought, meeting his professor’s eyes, it was not.
When Harry put down his quill, he touched his finger to his lips. He could not fathom that he had kissed Malfoy. Or, Malfoy had kissed him, he corrected himself quickly.
“I’m teaching you Defense Against the Dark Arts, not grammar,” he quipped. “I don’t want to hear it.”
"Where were you?" He asked.
Hermione began to grin. “Do you really like this girl, then?”
Hermione pursed her lips and shook her head disapprovingly while Ron called Malfoy a few callous names.
Malfoy was positively stony-faced. "Yes."
Harry withheld a laugh. He instead acted as though he was interested in the potion again. "Suppose. Same place?"
Harry found himself, regretfully, in the Slytherin common room again. This time, he didn’t feel nervous; this time, he felt annoyed and was not intending on masking it as he approached Malfoy who was sitting in the same spot as last time.
“But,” Hermione protested. “Who else could it be?”
“You just finished class twenty minutes ago.”
a vindictive rush of pleasure. “Nothing to say now, huh?”
Harry held his cold stare, hoping he looked more resolute than he felt. He put his hands in his pockets to ensure Malfoy could not see them shaking from the confrontation.
At least, Harry said to himself, Malfoy showed up to this session. They were both cold and short with each other. It was almost worse than when they first began.
“I’ve got my wand on me,” Harry said, feeling bad for Ron who was clearly bewildered. “It’s okay.”
Harry had been wearing a scarf for two days in a row, but on that third day, he woke up late for class and rushed to Snape’s without it. His hair was untidy, in a disarray, and he barely had time to button up his shirt.
He also mentioned how Snape threatened him with his grade (“Oh, no!” Hermione had exclaimed at once).
Malfoy had to bite his lip to resist a smirk.
They thought for what felt like a while. He thought over all the places on the Marauder's Map—and then finally, a place not on a map.
“Testy, Potter,” Malfoy drawled slowly. “I’m paying you, don’t forget. I’ll waste as much of your time as I damn well please.”
Harry swallowed thickly and said to Malfoy, quite curtly, “Come on, I’d like to begin instead of having you make small talk with others from your House.”
Carefully, he watched him writing, making corrections every once in a while. He pointed to areas in the textbook that he felt may be helpful and, for the first time, Malfoy seemed to be interested and diligent in his work.
He waited, however, until the other Slytherins slipped away towards their own classes. Malfoy had decided to linger a bit longer. He did not look very concerned about getting to lessons.
Please comment and bookmark! Make me smile :)
He looked at him for just a moment and knew, Merlin, he could not make a move on him. Even just saying it to himself felt awkward and unnatural. But, he did sort of want to, especially before their tutoring sessions when it was just unpacking and quiet tension of who would speak first.
Harry ignored this.
“Obviously I can’t, Potter,” Malfoy said coldly.
“Have I done something?”
“Well, you seemed upset by it.”
“Does that matter?” Malfoy bristled. “Get out of our common room.”
“Because you and I are not,” Malfoy continued, not seeming to notice that Harry had not objected to this. “So, I can see whoever I like.”
He could not stop reciting in his mind what Hermione had said to him about Malfoy—or, who she thought was a girl he fancied from a class.
“As much as I appreciate that, I think it would be best if we stayed out of each other’s personal lives and just focus on what we are here for,” Malfoy said, giving him a scathing look.
Could this be a prank? A joke between Slytherins? Worse, could he be in real danger?
It was not an argument or a fight. Malfoy was just trying to get a reaction out of him, Harry tried desperately to remind himself. He would come around in a day or so to write it off as a joke, surely. Or maybe it wasn’t and Harry had rid of him for good.
“On your turf?”
“Oh,” Hermione said, thinking hard. “Then, try to carry on with ordinary conversation. But, if you like her and she likes you—you did say she kissed you first, right? Thought so. In that case, maybe make a move if you both are comfortable.”
Harry babbled on, speaking hurriedly as if the faster he spoke, the faster this would be cleared up. After he finished, he swallowed thickly as realized how dry his mouth had become.
Harry said hurriedly, “Yes, of course.”
Malfoy looked away with a scowl. "Don't look at me like that," he muttered.
At those words, Harry felt eyes on him and noticed Draco staring at him. The blonde shook himself a bit and muttered a quiet, “Show-off.”
They lapsed into another long silence. The school around them seemed to vanish.
Harry looked at him crossly. “Finish my own homework tonight,” he said. “I’m trying to figure out how I’m supposed to finish my own homework tonight if I have this tutoring session.”
“Well,” Hermione said pointedly. “Unless you’d like to fail Snape’s class, I suggest you just go along with it. Whether or not Malfoy actually wants to take you seriously should not matter.”
"I guess. Don’t know."
“Well, it appears Malfoy has other ideas,” Harry said. He felt bad lying to his friends, but at the same time it was not totally incorrect. Except, it felt more like a weird enemies-with-benefits but also some unadmitted feelings break-up.
Malfoy exhaled shakily. Then, in a soft voice, as his hand trailed to the top of Harry’s pants, he said, “As if.”
Malfoy nearly knocked the ink bottle over, catching it narrowly. He glared at Harry. “Not funny.”
The next tutoring session was filled with fury and snide comments. They began by insulting each other, and Malfoy was quick to go after Harry’s dead parents—with Harry retorting that at least they had never been a follower of You-Know-Who.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Don’t test me, Malfoy,” Harry said. “You’d be surprised by what I’m capable of doing.”
Ron continued to stare at him, but now it was disbelieving; not sleepy. "Yeah, right. It's Malfoy. Something happened."
A number of people were staring at them now; Harry was beginning to get used to the way people eyed them suspiciously, almost as though expecting them to break into a fight in the middle of Snape’s classroom.
Harry had never seen him so needy, and Merlin that made him want it more.
“Harry!”
He picked up his glasses, muttered “
It was already five, nearing dinner-time.
Harry felt Malfoy gasp against his neck, running his hands down the front of his chest as he pushed into him again with more rigor.
“Right,” Ron enthused.
He turned back to his work. "Now. As I was saying, get into pairs and we will begin creating amortentia, one of the strongest love potions. Even one sip will affect someone strongly," He said, pausing in the front of the room. "Into pairs. Go."
Malfoy just flicked his wand. “M’not the settling down type,” he said. “They all would rather just get in bed. I’ve got a hundred girls just dying to take my last name, though.”
Harry took a breath. He could barely bring himself to look at Malfoy without feeling somewhat embarrassed. “I’ll tutor you again.”
Harry grinned up at him, feeling slightly better now that he had been able to talk about the situation. “So I suppose... studying for finals is not on the table?”
Malfoy shifted in his seat, looking uncomfortable and weirdly nervous. He seemed to be wincing.
Harry just stood, frozen on the spot, with his mouth stupidly hanging open as he stared after Malfoy, who disappeared down another passage.
Thinking about this for a great amount of time, Harry was silent again. Why had he chosen to go about it that way?
It gave Harry a chance to sneak a look at the Slytherin table. Malfoy was sitting with his usual Crabbe and Goyle, all laughing obnoxiously at something that was most likely not funny in the slightest. He was acting as though the night prior had not happened at all.
“Her?” Ron echoed, sounding disdainful. “You told Hermione? You told Hermione and not me? C’mon mate! Let me in on it!”
Harry watched as the Slytherin merely slouched further into his chair, eyeing everyone enviously as he trailed out of the classroom. He then faced forward, a scowl on his mouth, to glare at Snape coldly—he looked betrayed by the fact that the Potions teacher had broken their unspoken truce.
Harry rolled his eyes and opened his own book. He began to delve into explanations about the importance of jinxes and anti-jinxes and how some are more useful than others.
To that, Malfoy drew a shaky, furious breath. “You wouldn’t.”
For some reason, he wasn't surprised to find Malfoy sitting near the same spot as the night before. He was slouched in an armchair outside of the Slytherin common room.
"Well. No."
“Do you have to?” she pouted.
Harry saw Malfoy in the hall the next day. He was laughing and joking around with some of his fellow Slytherins, who were looking at him with something of admiration that Harry himself could not begin to understand.
“What?” Harry said, trying to sound nonchalant.
Snape just looked over and frowned but continued to grudgingly tell Hermione that hers came perfect. Ron looked quite pleased as well, sitting up very tall in his seat.
Harry rolled his eyes. "That’s saying nothing good about her.”
Harry winced, knowing at once what this was about. Hermione and Ron also seemed to catch on as they began to collect their belongings, looking a bit embarrassed to have to leave him behind. Harry could not blame them.
He didn’t know why he was entertaining this but he could feel his own heart racing.
“Just a compliment,” Harry said. “Pansy know you kiss that well?”
He picked up his wand and pocketed it.
“Yes,” Harry snarled.
"Potter..." he said, his voice just above a whisper. His eyes had a glazed, distant shine about them. “You are just so nice to look at.”
“Oh…” Harry said lamely. “Do you want to talk about it?”
Harry stood up and headed out, holding his breath as he wandered down the hall. It was late but not late enough for Filch to get on him for being out of bed.
Harry froze, eyes flying open suddenly. His body went stiff as a board. He could hardly believe it. His head was swimming and all he was aware of was Malfoy’s warm, slightly-chapped lips against his own.
“What?” Harry asked.
Malfoy straightened up. He went redder and redder, a high blush forming on his cheeks.
Harry noticed, which brought great heat to his face, Malfoy adjusted the front of his robes. He tried to pay no attention to that but continued to redden at the thought.
It almost took Harry all of yesterday to comprehend that, yes, that had actually happened. When Harry returned to his dorm, he had to blow out the candle beside his bed to hide from Ron his glowing-red face.
Malfoy made eye contact with Harry, almost challenging him and suddenly he didn’t know how to feel. Not in a bad way, just merely in a way that left him at loss for words.
They both collapsed to the floor, Harry on top of Malfoy.
After a while of sitting in silence, Harry grew fed up. “Fine, I’ll just leave,” he said. He threw his arms up in exasperation.
He sat down and looked away. The class didn't talk much after that.
His stomach swooped as he kissed back. This kiss was urgent, and rather needy. Malfoy moved in closer, and was breathing harshly through the hasty kisses.
It was at that moment Draco Malfoy stood up and sauntered over. Harry sat, silently praying he didn’t start anything, but his prayers were not answered because the Slytherin stood right in front of his table.
The topic of Malfoy came up the next day during lunch as well. Hermione brought it up first, which surprised Harry. He would have thought Ron would have after their bickering last night.
He realized that, with Snape forcing him to tutor Malfoy, he would not be able to wriggle out of this situation. And neither could Malfoy.
“And you were not even paying attention to our tutoring session,” Harry pointed out in a harsh voice, meeting Malfoy’s eyes confidently.
Harry blinked. “What now?”
He wasn’t sure if he liked Malfoy truthfully. He thought that he just liked… the feeling, the idea, the rush of the secrecy. But he would be willing to find out if it were more than just that. There were times, after all, when Malfoy showed his vulnerable side and it made Harry feel rather warm inside. This, of course, was something he was not eager to admit.
Snape clapped. "Get to work."
“You two are on equal playing fields now,” Harry said, instantly feeling guilty for bringing Neville down in the meantime. “How does that feel?”
“Come on, I know you can do it,” Harry said, trying to sound encouraging.
“Zabini?” Harry heard a drawling voice. “What are you doing? Who’s there? Is it Goyle with my food because I’m positively starved—oh.”
“Yeah, right. Talk,” Ron scoffed disbelievingly. “Jinx half the Gryffindor Quidditch team, more like. I don’t buy that for a second, Harry! Do you?”
“I just wanted to shut you up and a punch did not seem fitting at that time, so I just did what I felt was right—which now I realize was not right,” Malfoy added the last bit, almost as an afterthought. “Right now a punch seems more accurate—“
“After all, my grades are at least passing now,” Malfoy shifted his robes to hide his, um, excitement. His face was pink. “Which is all I need.”
And, with that, he began to write again. Now, however, he worked more stiffly and silently. When he was done, he did not so much as touch Harry before he left.
Malfoy’s cold look suddenly turned plotting. “You know what I mean,” he continued, daring to drag a hand down Harry’s front before resting at his belt buckle. “You want me inside of you again, fucking you raw in an empty common room while everyone is at dinner?”
“Problem, Potter?” Malfoy asked innocently. “What has got your cloak in a knot?”
“Malfoy,” Harry said more firmly before his mouth could travel further. He found himself to be distracted easily when in Malfoy’s presence.
Malfoy’s eyes, momentarily, lost that sense of dreaminess and instead hardened. It was gone almost instantly, though, when he said smoothly, “I just say and get what I want, and you don’t like that about me.”
“Just stay away from me, Potter, will you?” Malfoy demanded, his voice now sounding a bit more panicky.
Malfoy was evidently taken aback, mouth slightly open, and refused to meet Harry’s eye. He seemed as though he were trying, and failing, to find the proper words.
Then Malfoy kissed him, hard. Kissed him.
“Like what!”
Malfoy sneered. “Who are you sleeping with?”
"No, but—”
“I—I just thought that was best because I was copying you,” he said, knowing full well how absurd he sounded.
Harry was silent for a bit longer, before sighing. “Okay.”
“But, the effects—“
“Now you’re sounding like my mother,” Ron tossed a piece of chocolate wrapping at Harry, narrowly missing his head. “Let me know if you need any backup with Malfoy. I can always hold his arms behind his back.”
“So you do have manners,” Harry mused. “Interesting. Never would have guessed.”
“We, kinda, can’t,” Harry said.
Harry heard Crabbe and Goyle snicker, reaching across the table to high-five Malfoy.
“I better go,” Malfoy said again, bluntly. “I’m tired.”
They broke away for breath, but Malfoy didn't seem satisfied. He moved his head down and started kissing along his neck. Harry felt him begin to suck, bite, and lick. That caused a burn in his stomach. It was then that Harry tilted his head back and moaned.
“Don’t you blame this on me, Potter,” Malfoy hissed, trying to elbow him. And, when Harry tried to dive for him again, he was held back this time by McGonagall.
Harry came up behind him and tried to guide Malfoy’s arm, which was flailing wildly instead of with a controlled flick as they spoke the spell. Harry ignored this comment and bit the inside of his cheek. “Cause you’re doing it wrong, you absolute empty-headed git.”
“I guess continuing with lessons on Thursday as we had agreed before,” Harry said glumly.
“A whore.”
“Potter,” Snape said slowly, before he could escape the classroom. “My desk.”
“Ron go to bed?”
He was standing at Snape’s desk fully engrossed in their talk while all of the other students continued to walk out, seemingly relieved to have avoided their own talk with Severus Snape—and Harry could not blame them.
“How do you figure?” Harry parroted.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy let out a noise that sounded like a cross between another sob and a moan. “Oh, my— Merlin, just fuck me— keep going,” he babbled.
They were soon sitting with the textbooks in front of them as they finished out the lesson. Their hair was in disarray, the room smelled of sex, and their scarves nearly got swapped. It was Harry who quickly had to grab his Gryffindor scarf before Malfoy had.
Before long, Harry had a fistful of blonde hair and was rutting into him roughly against the floor. An image of them caught Harry’s eye in the mirror. He could see Malfoy, with his mouth open and his eyes half-lidded as Harry penetrated him.
Snape sneered. “What a good idea.”
Harry kissed him. He didn’t know why he did it. He had never exactly considered it, but it was quite nice. He had soft lips at least, Harry noted to himself, though a bit dry. Tasted like coffee. He smelled like woodfire.
Ron took a second to catch on and nodded unconvincingly. “Yeah, they’re together.”
Harry then pulled away and cleared his throat. He could not bring himself to meet his stare.
“I said just forget it,” Malfoy said more loudly than before. “I regret ever coming over here, and Weasel-by was right: I should have hexed you.”
For once, he was extraordinarily relieved to have heard Snape’s voice as it silenced Ron and Hermione and sent Malfoy sauntering back over to join his friends. His face, Harry noticed, was screwed up with great annoyance.
“Yeah, okay,” Harry said. “Thank you for that, Malfoy. Now, get out of the way.”
Malfoy just smirked. “Well, I don’t like it.And I changed my mind,” he added. “I realized that I won’t benefit from having you as a tutor.”
In fact, a half hour later, when he was mounting his broomstick, he could have sworn he saw a white-blonde blur watching him from inside the castle.
Harry realized that he had stopped talking. He had his book open but suddenly the words on the pages looked rather jumbled together. He blinked.
“I wanted to talk,” Malfoy said coldly, still boring holes into Ron with his eyes. “To you. And this one immediately pulled his wand out on me.”
“It’s not like that!” Harry protested. “And you know it, do not make a fool of me.”
“And anyone would be able to see you behaving like a slut for me, don’t you see?” Malfoy soothed him, running a finger over his cheekbones as he continued to press against Harry. Harry could feel his pants growing tight.
Malfoy almost looked amused, eyeing Harry as though he were a challenge. Harry did not like the look in his eyes.
“I didn’t like it,” Malfoy retorted, and even Harry noticed how lame the response was. “After everything that happened, I’m just uncomfortable.”
Malfoy stood there lamely, as if unsure what to say. His mouth was parted in slight surprise and his hands remained at his side. “Oh,” he said, at last. “Okay.”
