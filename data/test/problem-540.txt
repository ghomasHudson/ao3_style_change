“I want to fuck you tonight,” he said, because he did, and because he couldn’t think of anything else to say. “Slow.”
“Or not,” Malfoy says, profile lit by the sunlight coming in through the door, his expression closed. “Fix that for me, would you? I didn’t particularly appreciate being left outside without a way to defend myself,” he adds. He brushes past Harry and walks out, stopping in Harry’s line of vision. He clasps his hands behind his back and faces the distant horizon. Harry’s exhale feels more like a gasp, the oxygen having turned stale in his lungs.
“I was busy,” Pansy said, not looking at the letter. “You’re interrupting one of the two nights per week I have a few hours to do what I want, and the time I spent last week with you cost me a perfect mark on my magithermodynamics and kinetics exam. I
“And again I say, so?” Draco swiped away a strand of hair sticking to his forehead, off balance. The timer still had another twenty minutes on it and he couldn’t really leave, so he moved his robes and jumper from the stool they were resting on and sat, crossing his arms over his chest. Potter didn’t say anything and Draco huffed. “Who’s Julia?”
Through his teeth, Harry said, “You—” but was saved from finding out whether the rest would be an inquiry or something seriously vicious by the opening of a door he hadn’t noticed near the back of the shop, and Blaise Zabini walked out, tall and strikingly gorgeous as ever. Immediately, Harry understood that the lights were kept so low in the shop not because of the product they carried, but because it made Zabini’s brown skin practically glow and added a certain sparkle to his curly-lashed eyes, something that intensified his sex appeal ten-fold — as though giving a sample of what he might look like in bed after a long, hard shag. Even his clothes seemed chosen for such a narrative: his white shirt unbuttoned past his collarbone, his trousers just this side of indecently tight, a raisin-sized diamond winking in each of his earlobes. Harry gaped at him, so flustered by Zabini’s slow, full smile, it took Malfoy several increasingly sharp,
Draco removed his fingers with a twist and kicked his pyjama bottoms all the way off. “Do you want it—?”
Finally, Draco’s eyes came up. He inhaled slowly, consideringly, and then said, “No,” before turning and walking over to drop into the lone chair on the side of the room. Leaning back and crossing his legs, he propped his elbow on the arm and tucked his hand under his narrow chin.
“No,” Malfoy said, speaking for both of them, whether or not he knew it. Harry’s tongue didn’t seem to want to work. He couldn’t quite meet Bill’s eyes, but couldn’t look away. He shook his head. And then, as if he’d been waiting for Harry, Malfoy cleared his throat — a soft sound, awkward in its attempt at dignity — and said, “No, thank you.”
Granger’s chair creaks as she shifts subtly. There’s something mutinous about the line of her jaw that reminds Narcissa of Granger’s daughter — though Rose has a much sweeter disposition.
” Harry stands without meaning to, a nervous, disbelieving movement. His throat works; his eyes are hot. “
Malfoy shifts again and Harry closes the book with a guilty glance behind him. He tucks it away amongst the folders, and sets the messenger bag on the floor next to the other, turning his thoughts to what could be next.
“I was dreaming I was late for class!” he shouted, scrambling out of the bed. The blankets tangled around him and he fought them, huffing, until he managed to kick them to the floor, then marched up to Harry and dragged him into the room by the arm. Eyes locked onto Harry’s, voice frigid, he said, “Mother, I’ll take care of this. Go back to bed.”
“Will Master Harry be wanting more stomach potions, sir?” Kreacher asked, glassy eyes narrowing. “Or does he be having his tea now?”
. He folded it in thirds and sealed it, then handed it over to the owl with a gentle stroke of its feathers. “61B Diagon Alley South. Draco Malfoy, all right?”
“Sorry to keep you. Didn’t see a reason to prolong that mess,” he says, gesturing to the table, “but I wanted to ask about the greenhouses.”
“Going to a costume party?” he asked, in a harder tone than he meant to. He cleared his throat when Malfoy didn’t answer. “What do you want?”
Potter lifted off, letting my cock slip from his mouth. His eyes were hazy, his cheeks a deep red. He rose to his feet, breathing unsteadily, and swallowed. He cocked his head. “Do you? Really?”
Harry closed his eyes against it, the raw honesty almost painful — something Draco had demonstrated but never admitted to. Harry hadn't known how much he needed to hear it, or how lonely he'd felt, out on the limb by himself. He'd been lonely for so long it had become second nature. A habit, unfair of him when he had so much, and he'd taken worrying the feeling as one might like sore tooth with their tongue, the snap of nerves its own sort of company. And he could feel Draco's loneliness, too, in his confession. That same wound Harry had lived with, watching the people he loved move on with their lives,  knowing his differences might preclude him from doing so. He opened his eyes to find Draco watching him, heavy-lidded. Harry tipped his head for another kiss, careful, slow. “Sweet,” he said roughly. “D’you see?”
Harry did, and he did. Draco’s mouth was criminal, its own sort of Imperius curse, and the only one Harry had ever let himself yield to. Lips stretching and sliding up and down Harry’s prick, Draco brought Harry to the edge again and again, taking Harry into his throat, hollowing his cheeks with a deep suck on each pull back. He bunched Harry’s foreskin towards the base and lavished attention over his swollen cockhead, the pointed tip of his tongue flicking into Harry’s slit — lifting off with a cruel degree of accuracy whenever he sensed Harry was getting close. Murmuring,
Draco tightened his fingers around the quill, then dropped it and spun his chair around to face Harry. Witheringly, he said, “Because it couldn’t possibly
There’s a vague, flat note of question in Malfoy’s voice. Harry glances at him sharply, less surprised by the insinuation than he is by how long it took Malfoy to make. They’ve been in the room far longer than Harry anticipated, and though Malfoy’s been fairly patient, Harry’s been waiting for the point where Malfoy got sick of platitudes and half-promises. Hell, Harry’s sick of
“Good to know.” Malfoy sat back. “Wouldn’t want your reputation to suffer too badly. It might be of use to me, especially if it’s going to reflect on me somehow.”
Draco took it briefly, soberly. His shoulders had gone so straight under his robes Harry wanted to curve his palms over them, wanted to press his thumbs to the knotted muscles under the sweet spot on Draco’s nape, and ease that strain.
Laugh lines, people call them, smile lines. It’s hard to believe there was ever a time Harry didn’t know how to laugh with Draco, or how to make him smile. The knowledge that, over the years, even certain things about Draco’s face have been shaped by Harry, feels unspeakably precious.
“If you can.” Draco’s fingers moved, slower, travelling apart towards Harry’s sides. Harry’s mind immediately returned to a few minutes ago. Draco’s mouth on his, his hands holding Harry’s jaw.
Fortunately, Rose doesn’t even notice. She tips Hermione a sunny little smile and scampers back in the direction of her rooms. The hem of her nightgown flutters a few centimetres above her ankles, and Hermione makes a mental note to take her shopping — if, that is, they're alive when this is over.
“I made soup,” Harry says after a beat. Draco looks so calm. Unaffected, the way he does whenever he’s truly frightened. Harry takes the blanket Draco hands him and draws it back around his shoulders. “It won’t be very long.”
true, though Draco felt fairly righteous about not revealing the fact that he’d already begun uhm-well-you-know-ing when the technicians had burst in to spray them down with neutralising charms; there was no reason for Potter to know.
At length, Harry moves off him by increments, gaze still riveted on Draco’s tent siding. Draco drags in another deep breath, cold air washing over him in the absence of Harry’s heat. Not looking at him, Harry holds one finger up to his mouth, then points to their bags, the pile of their damp clothing, to himself and Draco in turn. Heart galloping at hectic speeds, Draco retrieves Harry’s clothes and passes them over, and they rapidly start dressing. He’s tying the laces of his boots when the swamp of sensation returns, heavier than before; he looks up and grabs Harry by the arm.
Draco points to the bed and watches Harry crawl to the middle, eyes flaring with interest when Harry sits back against Draco’s pillows and brings up his knees, letting them fall open. He breathes a low, aroused laugh and uncorks the wine with his wand, his steady, knowing gaze far more rousing than it ought to be when Harry’s already come twice, and when he says, “Stop being such a greedy slut for it, Potter, and give the rest of us a turn,” Harry draws in a sharp inhale. His cock, already fat, plumps harder, a bead of moisture welling at the tip. It’s the longest sentence either of them has strung together for hours, and trust Draco to make it one that turns Harry nonverbal again.
Harry sits back and fiddles with the tin on the table, sliding it back and forth. Gaze on it, he says, “Not sure. Maybe they remember me coming in here. Maybe the magic of two wizards in one nearby space is too big a lure, even when we’re hardly using it. They didn’t do that before I showed up?”
The longer Draco’s breathless pause went on, the more convinced Harry grew over how brilliant the idea was. Years had passed since he’d stopped bothering to deny the extent of his fascination with Draco; if nothing else, the longevity of that fascination boded well. He’d always liked knowing things about Draco and, since they’d become friends, he liked the things he learned.
“Well, you left quite a backlog,” Robards said. His moustache quivered slightly, too bushy to reveal the full depth of his frown. But it was an expression Harry was familiar with, regardless: worry. “And then of course there were new cases. There are a lot of people waiting for news, for justice, and we’re so understaffed. But I didn’t mean to overwhelm you, Harry. You take too much on. It’s a bad habit, that.” He pulled his wand and gave a graceful swish, separating the files into smaller, neat stacks. “There. You needn’t accomplish everything in one day, son. Some of those are cold cases, remember. Put your first efforts to the most urgent of them.”
” Fearful hissed. His body looped downwards; he slithered to the floor of his enclosure and flicked his tongue out, beady eyes curious. “
Harry stopped. He Summoned his glasses from the sofa and shoved them on, vision clearing. Malfoy was in pyjamas, tatty, green-flanneled things that were nearly worn through and hung, overlarge, on his frame, and his hair was rumpled flat on the left side of his head and sticking straight up on the right, matching, almost perfectly, the pillow crease he sported on that cheek. He looked frankly mad, and maddened, and Harry gulped back a laugh before it got him killed. He held up both hands, placatingly.
It was like last time, and not at all; the sensation of arousal coursing through Harry didn’t come as a surprise, but as a sweet, exhaustive relief, sweeping away the cobwebs of rage and sadness that choked the flow of his magic. Draco’s hand trembled on his cheek, and Harry brought up his own to cover it, tilting into the press of Draco’s palm — little stings, sharp and needling like the bristle of Draco’s magic, a whisk of something
The sun was fully up by the time Bill arrived. His knock was soft, but cursory; to Harry’s relief, he opened it without waiting for an invitation. Malfoy shifted, sitting up beside him, so Harry did as well, Summoning his glasses and shoving them on. They didn’t look at each other. Bill was serious, eyes red from a lack of sleep, a small frown caught between his brows as he approached the foot of the bed. His nostrils flared and his jaw flexed. Harry’s blush hit him hard and fast, a blast of heat to his cheeks.
Potter was going to take it the wrong way. Potter crowded him, jaw knotted, and Draco shoved him back a step.
. Gasping, Harry stepped forward to help. Head in his shirt already when Harry curled a hand into the material, Draco sucked in a breath and swayed. He let go — giving the unveiling of his body over to Harry, blinking at him as Harry dragged his shirt away. Muttering
“Draco does it for me,” Harry said. Ron stared at him, so Harry shrugged and explained, “You know I’m shit with Healing charms, so I bring the regular stuff to him. He’s brilliant, never leaves a scar.”
Impossible to keep his eyes open. Harry closed them, disappointed, certain there was so much more to that thought. A hand gripped his, squeezed it firmly. Draco’s, he thought. Harry wanted to look, wanted the chance to figure out what he was missing, but didn’t have time.
Potter was. After he’d taken Draco’s elbow to the ribs, he’d settled his hands on Draco’s hips. Draco tried not to look too smug; these were Potter’s friends, after all.
“No.” Draco turned around, his glare at Ron more of an interruption than his hard denial. He strode to the coffee table and picked up a quill resting atop a sheet of parchment, then scrawled something at the bottom with an angry flourish. He threw the quill back down; it clattered, bounced off the table. Draco’s eyes glinted at him. They looked like the block of knives from the kitchen before Draco had tended to them — blades exposed, a shiver of air away from lethal. “Because nothing,” he said grimly. “If you’ll excuse me.”
Harry’s narrowed gaze searches his before slipping down to pause on Draco’s mouth for a fraction of a beat. Then he closes his eyes, his jaw knotting under Draco’s fingertips. He pulls away and curses softly. Looks to their clothes. “I don’t think I can dry them fully tonight without expending too much magic. If the storm keeps up, I’ll try to find something, find a way to cover you.”
“Ah.” Harry leaned in to drag his teeth along the elegant line of Draco’s neck. “Have you been there? Do you want to go?”
I drag my eyes from it to find Potter looking at me, so intently it takes all of my considerable control not to squirm. Then he huffs a small laugh to himself and gives a tiny shake of his head. His cheeks bloom rosy. "Yeah. Yeah, sorry. I'll call when it's done."
Potter nodded, a swatch of satanically dark hair falling over one eye, and inched his zipper down to reveal grey boxer briefs. His stomach fluttered, caving in briefly as his gaze landed on my prick. I gave it another rub to shine him on. Potter fucking
It comes in between, to London, as Ron steps out of the Floo and coughs out a lungful of chimney dust. He’s pretty sure Kreacher leaves the fireplaces sooty to spite him; he’s been clear from the start that he doesn’t approve of people using 12 Grimmauld Place as a travelling stopgap. But despite his feelings on the subject, Kreacher appears out of nowhere, as if waiting for Ron to request coffee, and Ron knows he’d make some if he asked. He never thought the curmudgeonly old bastard would have a soft spot for him of all people, but Kreacher’s loyal as hell to Harry, and Ron supposes he can sense that Ron feels the same, in that way house elves seem to know so much while saying so little.
They’d made the same remarkable recovery as everyone else, since Harry laid eyes on them. Narcissa’s pale cheeks bloomed with health, and Lucius was as tall and unpleasant as ever, a sneer of distaste pulling at his upper lip. Both of them wore the same kind of semi-formal robes that Draco insisted upon with Harry’s family and friends. Lucius was stark in solid black robes, colour only hinted at in the muted emerald of his buttons, the silver trimmings of his cane. Beside him, Narcissa was more welcoming to look at, her robes silver-grey and covered in lace as delicate as spider silk, the gathered material fitted close around her bust and then falling like a dress to the tops of her shoes. Arm-in-arm, they presented as a unified front, haughty and forbidding, perhaps even frightening — to anyone who wasn’t Harry.
He should probably resent Potter himself more, but since neither Pansy nor Blaise is ever going to give Draco an orgasm like the ones Potter can, Draco’s willing to keep shuffling as much blame onto them as possible. At least until he uses the spell he found to regain his own self-control. Which he’s going to do, absolutely, very soon. Probably today.
scripted elegantly on the lid in English and French. Under the desk is a black leather messenger bag with silver clasps. Harry fits the strap over his shoulder and continues. The sofa he’d almost sat on before, richly upholstered in a soft cream that matches the wallpaper, is pulled away from the wall, just far enough to accommodate the space of Parkinson’s body. Harry glances at it and keeps walking; he frankly needs another minute before he can even contemplate doing anything about that.
Draco swayed, cheekbones splotched pink, breath coming in short, sharp pants. They were on the fringes of the crowd, the room bustling and alive around them, but they could have been alone for all it mattered. Harry shifted closer, tilted his head up to put his lips against the hinge of Draco’s jaw. Felt the shudder, unrepressed, rip through Draco’s lanky form — felt the telltale twitch of his cock through their robes.
“Numbers are even more reliable than time is.” Draco sets Potter’s clothes out to dry like the others and gets up as Potter starts scrubbing at his hair. He makes his way to the jacket and digs through the pockets until he finds a couple of folded slips of paper. He unfolds the first, wondering when Potter has been comparing it to the maps; he’s certainly never seen him do so. It’s filled with several lines of Potter’s messy scrawled symbols translated into letters with no spaces between and often no vowels included amongst them, but it doesn’t take Draco a moment to read Granger’s half of her conversation with Potter at the hotel. At the bottom, there are fifteen numbers, in no discernable order. Every subsection of the DoM begins with a specific set of three numbers, though, and none of them match anywhere in Potter’s list. He refolds the note and tucks it back into Potter’s jacket, then opens the second, which looks more worn-around-the-edges.
Potter steps in front of him, swinging his arm with a grunt, and a small cry falls from Draco’s lips as her body jerks, then crumples. Potter exhales loudly, bending to wipe the saturated blade of his weapon on her skirt as the world swoops around Draco. He straightens, fixing his gaze on Draco’s face.
It was a rhetorical question — he’d already sat down. Harry didn’t turn. He watched as the water slowed the gush of blood. Watched the gush transform into ribbons and wash away.
“Of course you would,” Draco muttered. But he sounded interested. Continuing to massage the spot on either side of Harry’s waist, he said, “Locating the magical nerves can be difficult; they’re less apparent when they’re not in use. But they’re connected with a witch or wizard’s emotions — it’s one of the reasons accidental magic in children is so common — so people experience the sensations differently when they’re stimulated. How and where you feel them can be a good indication whether there’s blocked flow. Most people sense it in their hands or wrists or arms, a tingle. I’m not surprised you had a… more extravagant response. Do you ever get hard when casting a spell?”
Harry heard Blaise clear his throat, and Theo and Draco broke away from one another. Blaise slanted Harry a swift glance, and gathered Draco into another embrace, this one blessedly shorter. He pulled back and Harry looked at Theo with a sense of crawling dislike, only to see Theo returning the look in spades. Harry’s jaw hardened, and he turned to Draco to keep from doing something stupid.
Stupid Kingsley. Stupid new policies of training with Unspeakables. Stupid fucking Draco Malfoy, wearing stupid, low-slung black joggers and a clinging white tank-top instead of those boring grey robes that cover the stupid, slender curves of his biceps and the stupidly elegant jut of his shoulder blades. Those robes swim around him, make him look skinny. Harry much prefers them.
“And again I say, we’re twenty-one,” Draco said. “It seems rather early to start fostering fears about that sort of problem.”
“What about you?” Face forward, Harry risked a sideways glance. “I thought you were supposed to be getting a Potions Mastery.”
Harry takes in the slight smile pulling at the corners of Malfoy’s mouth and makes a guess. “You didn’t eat it, though. What the elves baked.”
“Uh, don’t tell him that part yet,” he said. Then he got the hell out of there, before Draco ripped the door off by its hinges.
“You’ll have to stop that sort of shit,” Harry said plainly, gripping the balls of his knees. They shifted under his palms, and he loosened his hold.
Pansy’s smile is utterly wicked with glee — she’ll have had a hand in it, Draco knows — and though Blaise looks bored because he always looks a little bored, there’s a telling air of smugness about it this time.
“Yeah,” Harry said. “Okay. Fine.” He hadn’t thought of that. Didn’t want to think on it now — how Draco had essentially been moved from one prison to another. How he’d been handed over, as much a sacrificial lamb as Harry felt, having to make the choice between a life sentence and the death of...
Eating placidly beside him, Malfoy quirked a pale brow when Harry threw down his napkin, then rose languidly when Harry stood — the polite host, tolerating an ill-mannered guest.
Yet, when she's near enough to Harry that he could take a single step forward and grab her hand, she suddenly flinches and swivels, her body seizing up. She exhales a rabid, ravenous shriek crashes away from him as the other Inferi makes its position known by struggling onto one leg, falling, and righting itself again. Harry processes it all in the span of a second and searches for Draco, whose bright hair becomes obvious in the gloom once he knows to look for it.
and looked regardless. Draco had an open book face-down on his chest and he’d kicked his coverlet away. He wore nothing but his pants, and as Harry watched, the flat of his stomach rose a touch, slowly, then scooped inward — the bones of his hips shadowing, the trail of hair on his stomach like spun-gold in the firelight.
“Tends to happen. And anyway, so are you,” he said, sounding irritated and pushing his hipbone against Draco’s cock. Just as delighted as Draco was with everything, it throbbed out a little precome — then a little
Whether or not it is perhaps conceivable that our hero is so fundamentally heroic as to befriend a lonely, ‘“reformed” Death Eater-turned-Private-Magical Technician and stay true to the cause of protecting the public, the story doesn’t end there—for the question still remains: Where were Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy headed together? The answer to that is perhaps the most titillating factor of all.
The wizarding district in Paris is a bit bigger than that in London, but all it takes is one look to see that the streets have been ravaged by Inferi. Glass from broken shop windows glitters in the streets, lit by the few lamps that still have a working flame, and Harry can't feel the telltale buzz of wards over any of them. The air is colder here, too, and is oddly thick, a murky sort of fog, as if the necromancy that's soaked into the hordes has permeated every magical space. Maybe it has.
“Oh.” Draco sags, grimacing at the dampness of the pillow under his back. He starts to sit up, but Potter’s hand on his chest stops him. He looks down; his robes and shirt have been removed, leaving him in nothing but his trousers and shoes. “What—?”
, he would have asked when I’d started… looking at you differently,” he hedged, “and I’d have had to explain about how he was assigned to you, and I couldn’t.”
“Dear fucking Christ,” Draco said weakly when it was over, Harry slumped and breathing hard against his back. Then: “If I turn around and there are people staring in our direction, I’m going to claim you dosed me with a lust potion.”
“Oh,” Draco says. Because he’d known, of course, that it was, but not that Potter smiling that way and saying something so mundane would be the thing that made Draco realise he'd at some point fallen in love with the arsehole. He blinks. “Thanks.”
Setting Harry’s hands firmly on his hips, Draco reached back between them. He cupped Harry’s cock through his jeans and rolled his head on Harry’s shoulder. “What?” he murmured. “Tell me what you want.”
he? Sometimes I think he has to; sometimes he looks at me the way he just did, and I'm almost certain it clicks. He's such a brilliant Auror, I never know whether to be grateful or horrified that he can be so unobservant about other matters. That he doesn't realise I'm a fucking slag for him. That the lift of one of those dark brows makes my whole body throb. Fuck, it took me nearly a day to leave my room after seeing him emerge from the loo in just a towel for the first time, golden skin still beaded with clinging droplets water, the slender feathering of hair below his belly button damp.
“Mm.” Looking vaguely interested, he nodded at Harry’s uniform. “And the wardrobe? As far as I can tell, even the Head Auror wears robes.”
A deeply petty part of Draco resents his hesitation and wants to refuse, but logic reminds him that Harry’s yet to let him down. Not in any real way. Shivering, Draco fits himself just enough against Harry’s side, their legs tangling with a familiarity born of necessity. Harry’s arm comes down to lightly circle Draco’s shoulders, the tension leaking from his body in increments.
Pansy fell silent, still looking at him. Their parents had come to the table multiple times over the years to engage in talks about their future. For awhile, it had seemed the thing, an obvious choice to make. It still did, sometimes, though they’d probably have to use Muggle technology to have any offspring; Draco learned at thirteen that even kissing her made his bollocks virtually disappear inside his body. It hadn’t been pleasant. But this was. And they were of-age, and he trusted her, and Pansy’d never once looked at him like...
Without really talking about it, they walked the short distance from the cinema to Barnaby’s offices. After having been outed in the papers as Harry and Draco’s solicitor, his sleepy trade had begun to boom, but serendipity was on their side: he’d just had a cancellation. They watched in silence as he drew up the contracts, and once Draco signed, he Flooed to the flat near his shop with a promise to come home the following day. It as two-thirty in the afternoon.
Eventually, Kreacher ushered everyone into the dining room. The table began to lengthen after the first eight people entered, duplicate chairs popping into existence. Startled, Harry stopped in the entryway near Draco, who was watching the display with a blandly patient expression. Harry opened his mouth to comment on it, but stopped, overwhelmed by the clean scent of Draco’s aftershave. Woozy from his nearness.
Harry can already feel the dangerous spike to his magic that indicates an oncoming magical crash, just from forcing the broom to fly. It’s as if the very air is sucking all power from his casting, from his blood. Still, he angles the broom up, willing it to go higher. It rocks before sluggishly obeying. But a stubborn broom has never been a match for him, and though it feels like it takes a lifetime to get to the fourth storey, he manages with some effort.
Alright, so perhaps it was feasible Potter liked him. Plenty of people liked him. Well, several, when he made an effort to be likable. It just happened to take… a lot of effort, sometimes. So, a few people liked him. Maybe Potter. Almost definitely Potter, he’d said so. Kind of.
Untying them, Harry gestures for Draco to stand back, then slides one of the doors open. It gives off the barest whisper of a squeak, and Harry pulls his machete and steps inside, relaxing when no crazed Inferi dart out at him. Instead, it’s just what it looks like from the outside — a musty shelter that hasn’t been used in weeks, if not longer, smelling of nothing more offensive than hay and hard-packed dirt. Six horse stalls decorate both sides, each of them cluttered near to the brim with household odds and ends. An empty tack room at the far end has a door with bolted locks. Harry sheathes his machete before waving Draco in and rolling the door closed. He latches the doors tight with the metal cinch hanging from one of the inside handles.
“Fine, but — I want to be clear — I’m only telling you because I don't think we'll be able to practice again,” he says. “Which means
“No.” Harry finishes off his coffee and sets the mug aside. He draws Draco closer and kisses his cheek, his mouth. He tastes like spiced coffee, and his tongue slides against Harry’s, warm and unrushed, until Harry pulls away. “I like you in everything you wear.”
The air shimmers and there’s a single beat of silence, every living thing within a kilometre somehow recognising the violation of the natural order. Then a passerby shakes off his tremble with a laugh and says, “Quelqu'un doit avoir marché sur ma tombe.”
“Draco!” He beat against the wood framing with the flat of his hand. “Draco Malfoy, wake your arse up
And Draco can’t even argue with that. He can’t deny the way his muscles froze when confronted with that young woman, the memories that blinded him in the face of oncoming danger. It’s been bloody
Malfoy’s head twitches and the poisonous gleam disappears from his eyes. In a blink, he deflates and becomes a sad blend of vacant and weary. He takes another step back, head bowed, the damp hair of his fringe hanging. Eyes on the ground, he skirts past Harry and heads over to the rocks, where he bends to retrieve his clothing. Harry follows to stand beside him and takes the blanket when Malfoy silently passes it to him. Malfoy rises and stays still for a moment, clutching his clothes to his stomach.
The first breach should hurt, shouldn't it? You've never been fucked before. Yet your body accepts him, your own, inexplicable slick easing the way, and all you can feel is that same relief his arms promised, his smell. You moan, finally filled, and reach back to grab his clenching arse as he pumps into you. He groans your given name and your dripping erection bounces under you, slaps against your belly and the hem of your shirt.
And then Malfoy slips his hand from Harry’s hip to his belly — still standing behind him, practically
"None of us want you to." Bill’s eyebrows drew together. “Hermione’s looking for a way to get you out of it. I am, Fleur is. I’ve no doubt even the Malfoys are looking. We would never, ever make you.”
“I didn’t know,” Draco said. He put the items from the first pile into a different trunk, and the items from the second into an open box, things Harry recognised as having come from around the house, except — repaired, improved. “No matter what Granger thinks. If I had, my parents would have—”
don’t have long though, because I promised she could… But make sure you pay attention to how Malfoy reacts to whatever she says,
“Well, well. That was masterful,” Narcissa murmurs, but the glare Hermione whips at her lands on her back as Narcissa strolls calmly back to the seat she’d been occupying.
Potter was an entirely different sort of horrible: he snorted at Draco’s insults (or smiled, which was worse), poked around Draco’s lab with the curiosity of a toddler, and picked little arguments with Draco seemingly just for enjoyment’s sake, (because he’d usually just end up capitulating whenever his break was over). And if Draco’s mind occasionally wandered enough to provoke a physical reaction to the immaculately-presented work version of Potter, he simply registered those as a delayed response from the powder and was able to move on.
“Harry.” An invitation lurked in the rough notes of Draco’s voice. In the hitch of his breath. The lamps had burned down low, more puddled wax than anything else, but the fire was hot at Harry’s back. It didn’t make sense that the trickle of sweat down his spine should be cold — or why he should experience it as a terror he hadn’t felt in years.
“After your provocative little display,” Draco said, folding the fingers of one sure hand around Harry’s and placing the other firmly at his waist, “all of the cameras are on us. So smile and don’t plough into me — you’re
For some reason, that seems to register. Harry blinks again and pins Draco with a stare. The walls and floor stop creaking as though on the verge of flying apart. The windows take a few seconds longer; the screech of Inferi, at length, slowly begins to subside.
“Merlin no.” Draco rolled to his side. He slipped his hand along Harry’s flank, gaze warm and sleepy-soft. “Am I to understand, then, that you’re
The ball of Draco’s throat moved in a hard swallow. He used his elbow to push off from the door frame. “Be that as it may,” he said, “he wants you. They might have an arrangement, like we’ll have an arrangement.” He walked up to Harry, smooth, loping strides that ate up the expanse of floor between them. “You could always ask, when we’re out of here. If that’s what you want.”
The bottle in Harry’s hand exploded. Soaked with gin, Harry stared at the blood welling from two deep, irregular gashes in his palm, numb to any pain they might be causing. He pulled out the bits of broken glass he could see, set them carefully aside, and excused himself with apology to go clean up.
food in the room, things available for purchase in a tiny cabinet on the desk; fruit, he thinks, and perhaps a jar of cashews? All he knows is that he’d eaten it without thinking about a week in, almost everything at once, and that the cramps to his stomach that coming in waves afterwards had felt like what he deserved for his gluttony and… other things.
“Or keep three hundred students and dozens of assorted others fed and in a safe place,” Harry says, rolling his eyes. “Apparating within the wards of Hogwarts is one thing, Apparating people out of them is another. Believe me.”
She flipped the picture of Scorpius over, probably out of habit, since Aurors were trained to check all sides of everything they touched, and Scorpius watched as her eyes widened comically. He’d never seen Head Auror Clearwater surprised—she’d always seemed ineffable to him. She reached for the other photo and flipped it over as well before Scorpius remembered there had been writing on the other side.
“Are you saying I’m trouble?” he teased. Harry shook his head quickly, unsure how to respond, but Luna spoke up.
“These images were found lodged inside a journal, which was originally submitted as evidence item number 26. These images should have been catalogued as separate pieces of evidence, but because the investigation was rushed by the Auror handling it, they were missed. This is of consequence, because of the code written on the back. To explain this, I would like to call Head Auror Penelope Clearwater to the stand.”
You have to look at the facts objectively, even if they lead you to a conclusion you don’t want to hear.”
She accompanied her frosty drawl with a fake smile, and Harry stepped aside, his mouth twitching, and swept one arm out.
Confused, Draco exchanges a look with Harry and sees his own surprise mirrored back at him. Granger’s tone is devoid of the cool superiority from their last call. “I’m fine,” he says cautiously.
“You should be able to call him, no matter where you are!” Draco grabs his arm, demanding his attention. Harry’s bicep flexes in his grip, his mouth, if possible, going even more immobile, and Draco says, “He’s your elf; you can call him here, he could—”
Draco flinches away from her voice. “It’s nothing,” he says again, hoarsely. He nods at Potter’s shoulder. “Lift your arm up with your other hand.”
“Draco.” Harry tried to catch him as he passed, but Draco swerved to give him a wide berth at the last second, leaving Harry grasping at air. The doors to the study slammed behind him, and Harry, hands distinctly empty, turned to the people who were supposed to be his friends. Trying to curb the fury in his voice, he said, “Someone tell me what the
No one wanted to acknowledge what they all knew: that the biggest threats to unwilling participants would always be to the people they held dear.
“Is that a compliment?” Potter grinned and and stretched. He settled onto his side and shook his head. “I didn’t hear you complaining.”
. He had half a mind to spend the holidays in the shadowed, vacant Manor, rather than be subjected to any more of Potter’s nonsense.
“I’m at work,” he said. But he sounded unsure, and bit his lip. Harry took another step. Draco inhaled sharply and shook his head; his whole face had turned pink in a matter of seconds. Harry liked how it looked, and continued closer, pausing only when Draco’s palm settled on his chest. Draco curled his fingers slightly, digging into the cotton of Harry’s t-shirt. “I-I’d get fired,” he said.
Besides, if Draco wanted to accuse him of impulsivity, it would only give Harry the opportunity to explain that he was wrong, and Harry liked doing that, too.
Harry sighs and Summons the remote, passing it over. Draco hums with satisfaction and settles his head a little deeper into Harry’s lap, short locks of his blond-and-purple hair strewn over Harry’s flies. They’ve both gotten good at ignoring any accidental biological responses, and Draco gives no indication of even noticing Harry’s slowly hardening cock, except to push his skull back against it with a grunt as he blinks blearily at the telly and tries to get situated.
” Harry demanded. He pointed to the two dozen or so letters he’d managed to gather in his rage before Apparating over. “There are at least another hundred at my house, probably more by now! Either condemning me for keeping my mystery lover a mystery or begging me to consider them in his or her stead. I’m not faking a fucking engagement to get a job I deserve. I was willing to put up with your shit, but I draw the line at that. You really haven’t changed, have you, Malfoy, that you could possibly think I’d
“That should make it harder for them to grab me,” Malfoy says, casting Harry a look. But he lets Harry haul him up from the floor and plops down easily at the foot of the bed. Harry can feel his gaze on him as he rifles through his pack to pull out a tin of beans, his can-opener, and the heavy bag of shelled pistachios he’d harvested from the market. Harry tosses the bag to Malfoy, who catches it deftly. The plastic rustles loudly as Malfoy unties it and reaches inside for a handful. Setting the bag aside, Malfoy adds, “If we ever actually leave.”
Grudgingly, Harry holds himself in place as Malfoy pulls his good arm from its sleeve, then works the jacket down his dislocated arm. Harry glances down and immediately away, grinding his teeth against the bile threatening to rise in his throat. His shoulder joint juts out under the skin against the fabric of his t-shirt, a dark green-blue bruise discolouring his arm where Malfoy peels the material up to take a look.
Draco goes first, one eye on Harry above him even as he scans the ground below. Harry’s coordination is clumsy at first, but by the time they reach the fourth floor he’s steadied, and Draco’s able to pick up the pace. Running out of rungs for his feet requires some awkward use of upper body strength but he manages it, lowering himself one rung at a time until he’s dangling from the last, about the length of his own height between himself and the ground. The drop is bone-jarring but painless. There’s a wheeled bin a few feet away that would probably make Harry’s drop a little easier; Draco attempts to get it rolling with a hard lean against one side as Harry suddenly freezes, three rungs from the bottom.
“From Blaise,” Harry guessed. “I saw them in his shop. Because you’re sleeping together?” If he recalled correctly, they had built-in vibration charms. But then, most of the things Blaise sold seemed to.
“That’s what I thought,” Potter said. Draco picked up the little bottle of Sleekeazy mix and shook out a little onto his fingers. Rubbed his hands together.
“Don’t,” Draco said unevenly. “Just—” He gripped Harry’s wrists, led both his hands to the fall of his breeches. “Harry.”
Draco moans around his cock, cutting the sound off with a sharp whine, the slide of his mouth increasing slightly in speed. His hips, arched high behind him, start a tiny, needy rock, and that’s pleasing too. Harry has to close his eyes against the sudden, blurred sting in them. While there’s still time, he says, “Enough,” the word broken in a strained laugh. Draco draws off his prick, wrapping his fingers around the base to squeeze it tight — thank fuck — and lifts his head, breathing hard. His gaze narrows, one eyebrow hooking up when Harry shoves his glasses to his forehead to rub the moisture from his eyes.
Harry shook his head. “What happened to the discussion of titles? The several steps and all the rules?”
He had a way of speaking when he was invested, a gravity not unlike Mad Eye’s. He paid attention. He was committed, and he cared. It was what made him a good mentor, and what made Harry so determined to do him proud; he was trustworthy, paternal, and Harry had always taken heart from that.
“Master Harry was not meaning his abandonment of Kreacher, Kreacher is being very old and was being willing to die with no one to take care of and nothings to do, for his good and kind Master,” Kreacher said guilelessly. He glanced over his shoulder, the droop of heavy wrinkles on his forehead multiplying momentarily.
“Is that what I’m doing tonight?” Potter asked, one brow lifting. He nudged his jeans down further so they hung loose around his hips; they were gaping open, the outline of his cock obscenely swollen through his pants.
“No, that was the one whose father was still frequently using him for Cruciatus practice when he thought Goyle wasn’t behaving enough like a man,” Draco said with a tightly-reined look of anger. Taken aback, Harry met his eyes, and Draco nodded, tensely. “He’s gone through a
“I’m not—” Harry broke off with a helpless writhe against him, autonomy obliterated by the potency of his desire. He tucked his head harder against his arm to expose his neck, Malfoy leaning in and nipping at the bend of it. “I don’t—”
It was one of the most fundamental truths of Harry’s life: as soon as things were going well, everything would turn to shit.
Harry knee-walked closer and pressed his cock to the back of Draco’s thigh; he pulled his finger out to the tip and added another. It went in easy with the first, the crinkles of Draco’s rim softening and smoothing around them. Settling his hand over the small of Draco’s back, Harry fucked against his leg and watched his fingers vanish into him, emerge. He was breathing hard, the world spinning around them, a tingle heating around his branded wrist. He twisted his fingers, turning his palm down, and fucked into Draco with short, shallow thrusts — skimming his fingers firmly against the smooth small swell of Draco’s prostate. Wanting to make him feel good, to make him go as mad as he’d sent Harry, humping the back of Draco’s thigh like he’d never fucked before, fumbling for more friction, dying with the need to come. And then coming like a virgin too, so focussed on the swing of Draco’s tightened balls between his thighs and shivering moans, that the first hard pulse of it caught him off guard.
Shifting Teddy onto his hip and lowering onto his knees, Harry grabs a handful of powder and throws it against the grates, then sticks his head into the flames that erupt and calls out Malfoy’s address. He’s got one of those fancy call-signalling chimes Harry keeps meaning to invest in, and Harry listens to it ringing faintly in the background of Malfoy’s empty study. Bouncing Teddy on his hip, he resigns himself to either a long wait, or an incredibly cross Malfoy spewing venom his way for being woken up.
“Oh, Merlin, what do you want from me? It’s casual wizarding attire. Particulars have gone out of style — see the lace on these cuffs? Oh, wait, that’s from the moths; over there, then — but they last for centuries if made and kept right. They’re incredibly comfortable, fit like a glove, and are usually only worn in the privacy of one’s home.”
The doors to the study opened, and Harry stood as Draco stepped out and spotted him. He was holding a small parcel wrapped in brown paper, and he set it on the ornate pillar at the bottom of the staircase as he passed, legging up the stairs two at a time. His gaze was narrow but mesmerising, and Harry’s body pulsed with a craving so deep he was hit with a devastating surge of vertigo. He clutched the railing desperately.
“Shut up,” Harry says, but he’s smiling, and so is Draco — one of those subtle smiles he wears sometimes, tiny enough to be mistaken for a smirk. “Do you want to hear this or not?”
Harry found the term funnier than he perhaps should have. If it had been a fight at all — and Harry was abruptly unsure of that — then Malfoy had undoubtedly won the round. He thought of saying
“I never agreed to let you martyr yourself to protect me,” Draco says with a breathless, sneering laugh. "Noble Harry Potter. That's how you decide to do it?" He bucks again and Harry grunts, tightening his fingers around his wrists. Draco slumps against the tree once more, an irascible glint in his eyes; through his glove, Harry can feel the wild flutter of Draco’s pulse. His chest is heaving under Harry’s, and as they stare at one another, Draco narrows his eyes into slits.
he blurted. “Am I—?” His hand flew up in alarm and he ended up slapping himself in the face. Yelping, he gentled the investigation of his own blindness as he seemed to remember that he was wearing a mask. He patted it, found the elastic holding it in place, and stripped it from his head. His mouth dropped open.
“I meant— I didn’t want it to be a reaction to something else, the first time,” Harry says, each word dragged painfully from him by the demand in Draco’s gaze. “I meant I didn’t want you to wake up and regret it, regret me. I meant that I wanted to do it right so we wouldn’t end up…” He trails off when Draco starts shaking his head.
“Yes. Like Kingsley,” Harry said. He drew a letter from his pocket, tossed it to the desk. “Who knows your tactics well, and has been wondering about how you’ve been running the department for a while. But if the Minister for Magic doesn’t impress you, what about Glendis Whitmore?” he asked, pulling another letter and tossing it beside the first. “Don’t recognise the name? You should; she’s been one of the filing clerks for the DMLE for nearly forty years. She charms copies of every case anyone turns in and keeps them down in the wizarding space on level thirteen. Unaltered.” Harry took a breath and reached into his breast pocket. “Or Draco Malfoy.”
And Draco moans and presses his hand to the headboard, knuckles turning white as he grips it, and turns to Harry with blind, needy kisses, desperately digging his teeth into Harry’s lower lip. He gasps,
“I have my own appointment,” Blaise said. “But Greg is in the back. He’s got a few things nearly ready based on the measurements of the customer whose clothes Harry stole.”
He smells like whiskey sours and sweat, like spunk and a cologne with sweeter notes than the one he uses. Harry cards his fingers through Draco’s damp, messy hair — purple-tipped this time, Harry sees, prettier with his moonlight blond than the green was — and says, “I’m not waiting up to let you in the next time you’re too drunk to unward the door.
“But not for my sheets,” Draco said, voice gratifyingly unsteady, “not the oil I use for sessions.” He slung his arm over Harry’s shoulder to reach for something and came back with a small bottle of soap, thumbing open the lid and squeezing out a healthy dose onto the flannel. “Turn around.”
Harry glanced at Hermione to see if she’d argue the point, but she was gazing at Ron, transfixed. She blinked a glittery sheen of wetness from her eyes and slipped her hand into his, leaning her weight against his side. Ron dropped a kiss onto the cloud of her curls and shot Harry a sheepish smile. Harry cleared his throat, looking away, then self-consciously shuffled them into what Draco insisted on calling
“If it’s possible.” Harry looked up. The disbelief on Draco’s half-damaged face was so extraordinary, Harry didn’t know why he wasn’t tempted to laugh, why it made him
, that he used his own magic to ease the suffering of others, perhaps the only way he could make amends. Draco wasn’t the boy he’d once been, cruel and full of the hate that had been bred into him; he was his own man now, and one that Harry—
“You fuck around, too,” Draco says, a dark cast to his face. “You’re not so pure as you like to pretend.”
So Draco wasn’t going to take his suggestion. Potter was up to something bigger than helping him with with cooking. It didn’t matter how curious he was — he was done dancing to Potter’s tune.
“Wait, wait.” Granger sounds harried. “I need you to write this down in case the call gets interrupted, are you ready?”
Harry watched him carefully. Draco’s expectations had likely been grandiose, full of the bowing and scraping that befit his status, spoiled little shit that he’d been. But with a disconcerting flash of insight, Harry could see why, beyond that, knowing what to expect would appeal to him. Draco was drawn to the uniformity of things, their order, their virtue; it was why he liked magical repair, why he was so good at it.
She stretched up on her toes, and Ron stooped. They kissed, slow and sweet. Harry waited for it to end, but when Hermione’s arms slid around Ron’s shoulders and his hands tightened at her waist, decided to give them a minute and headed into the parlour.
Squinting, Harry follows flashes of silvery-white and sees Draco dart behind a tree, then another, weaving in between obstacles, the blind Inferi hunting him down. Harry opens his mouth as Draco passes him on one side, but Draco cuts him off with a yell: “
“It was Sheffield,” Harry says. “The one whose memories had been ‘wiped.’” He loosens his hold on the counter and rounds it. “Someone must have seen that I found the gold transfer he received three months ago, from a person who doesn’t exist — except on parchment, as one of the many owners of the corporation that was funding last year’s pureblood extremist group.”
(It would be me, of course. Harry Potter never paid for anything and I knew that for a fact; countless restaurants refused to present him with a cheque when we found ourselves shopping for our classes in Hogsmeade or Diagon Alley, as though they’d rather go bankrupt than take a Sickle from one of the wealthiest wizards alive.)
He wasn’t completely successful, but wasn’t a complete failure either. There was a lot to focus on besides the identity of who was beneath him: the knobbly rug against the skin on his knees, his arms, the slender, toned length of a body moving heatedly against his, the damp patch growing on the inside of his pants. It had been more than six months since that last time with Gin, a mistake, they both agreed, over a year after breaking up. She’d never told him why she’d come over that night, and Harry’d had no good reasons for taking her to bed, either, not love or even the desire they’d shared when things were good. He’d simply
“Really?” Potter said, not seeming that interested. His eyes were no longer green so much as black, and his face was splotchy-pink and distracted. He bit at Draco’s jaw and kissed his mouth again, palms rubbing up and down his sides, and Draco wondered what had happened to his shirt, because it had gone and opened all the buttons — even the cuffs were loose, his sleeves riding up.
— her nose wrinkling with distaste as she’d whipped them a few times, dust and grime clouding the air. Neither of them had seen the Inferi come from around the corner, and then it was too late.
” Draco barked. Harry blinked, cock throbbing, and took a dazed step back. He dragged his gaze up to Draco’s with the petty thought that at least he wasn’t the only one who was irritated and turned on.
The two sides of Harry’s belt went lax, jangling as they were dropped. Draco thrust himself back and whirled to face away with such immediacy, Harry could only assume he’d been expecting a rejection. Shoulders heaving, Draco said, “Right. Yes. Of course. I shouldn’t have presumed—”
“Actually I did,” Draco says, capping the shampoo before tossing the bottle to Potter, who catches it with an automatic smile. “If I wanted to avoid going another night drifting off to the odour of them. You can only Scourgify so many times before it stops working, you know. Or perhaps not.” He hears a soft snort and looks at him again. “What was it you wanted my expertise on this morning? Or was that just a diversionary tactic so you didn’t have to—?” Draco cuts himself off. He doesn’t actually
the elves—” this assurance is so readily given, Hermione realises it’s the only thing he believes with any certainty “—but we need more power, right now, or we can’t allow the call to come through.”
Harry hikes up his good shoulder defensively. Draco observes him with the disconcerting realisation that nothing less than the end of days would have brought them to each other’s bed. He probably should have known as soon as Harry finished speaking to Granger that it would precipitate a change between them, but finding out his mother was alive, the confirmation that his father wasn’t… His instincts have been off. Evidently more than he realised.
Harry put his wrist in it. Draco sighed, brow furrowing. He reached into Harry’s jacket and plucked Harry’s wand from the holster hugging his ribcage, giving Harry a distracted frown when Harry inhaled with surprise.
“If you’re not going to send it in, Owl it back to me,” Malfoy mutters. “I’ll have it published by morning.”
The look Harry levels at him is at once chastened and entertained. “Inferi aren’t going to be critiquing your form. But I— I suppose I—”  He hesitates, ruffles his hair with his fingers, and then, as though he doesn’t see Draco’s glower, sets Draco’s wand on the desk and gestures. “Move to the centre?”
“They were for my birthday,” she said. Harry said nothing, confused but not thrown — having a conversation with a Slytherin felt a bit like being dropped into the middle of a maze without a guidance spell, but it was something he was getting accustomed to. But he did raise his eyebrows when Pansy flipped up the flounce of her skirt, another wink of red and purple, and added, “The knickers.”
“Did I hurt your feelings?” Luna asked, the dreamy cadence of her voice taking on a momentarily forthright quality.
Draco looks down, a slight smile playing around his mouth. “I have others,” he says, a twinkle to his eye when he glances back up, “but I rather thought you should eat and rehydrate before I showed them to you.”
Robards coughed into his fist, deliberately overlooking the slight. “Care to join me for that drink while we plan?” he asked, Summoning a bottle and two tumblers.
“Wait,” she said. Her face had gone ashen in the last week, her lips dry and cracking, and red between the cracks. Her voice was faint as dust, but everyone paused. “Wait. I’m close to figuring out… I just need a little longer, I know it.”
Harry wasn’t sure he did. But he pushed up with a final nip to Draco’s jaw and got back on his knees. Holding his breath, he cupped Draco’s arse cheeks — massaged them, pushing Draco’s hips to the mattress, a slow fuck downward, liking the small grunt Draco gave. He bent and kissed the dimples on the small of Draco’s back, licked them, dragged his tongue down between his hands, over the crack of Draco’s arse. And then lower, not wanting to stop yet, feeling as drunk as Draco sounded, from the scent of his sweat and the taste of him, and how Harry could scent himself too, under Draco’s freshening charms. Lips trailing along the pull of Draco’s seam, to his balls; they were plump, pressed to the mattress, his sac shiny and responsive to Harry’s tongue. Harry licked over them, sucked them into his mouth as well as he could, his tongue shifting soft, tender skin, lips pulling, mind lost in the heat. His position was awkward, wrong for this sort of thing, but worth it when Draco started shaking, when he cried out, and then muffled his cries with the pillow. They were devastated sounds, nonsensical, but Harry heard a
Harry narrows his eyes, taking in the sweat at Draco’s temples, the wild look on his face. Draco’s nipple has darkened to a deep rosy-brown, wet with saliva. “Noted,” he says with interest. Then, because it’s his turn — he thinks — says, “Someday you’re going to come just from my mouth on your nipples.”
going to lose all her hair if Draco had anything to say about it, no matter the disturbed look on her face. Draco brushed the crumbs from his fingers and forced a smile, and Potter returned it awkwardly. “I had a question about schoolwork.”
“I— haven’t got any other plans,” Malfoy says. “And, I like spending time with Teddy. Yes, alright.”
“Two,” Harry admitted. Draco paused, blinked, then set his chin on Harry’s shoulder expectantly. Harry shrugged. “After Gin and I— She was a Muggle. Beth. I liked her, it, but. It was different than with Ginny, not as,” he struggled with the right word, gave up, “good. I guess? I— I was too nervous I’d say, do, something, give myself away. She was just visiting, anyway, from Canada. I was relieved when she was gone. What about you?”
“Thanks!” Goyle nodded, looking momentarily unnerved at Harry’s presence but quickly regaining his enthusiasm as he continued, “The fairy-silk is harvested humanely, don’t worry, but you see that bit of… sparkle?” He hesitated as he gestured to Draco’s tie, like he was unsure that was the right word for it, and looked at Draco for confirmation. Draco nodded, ticking him a measured smile, and Goyle grinned and said, “That’s only found in fairy-silks from tropical environments, and I knew it’d work with the black, ‘cos he’s so pale. He doesn’t usually let me make him things, but since it was his—”
Draco tightens his fist experimentally — correctly. “I see,” he says, though, judging by the wary glance he throws Harry, he clearly doesn’t. "Next time I hit you, I'll be sure to remember your advice," he adds, then blinks and glances around them, seeming to remember where they are. He eyes Harry, gaze catching on Harry’s midsection. “You’re bleeding.”
he felt, as clearly as if it’s happening now. Which it sort of is, in its way. It’s never stopped, really.
He didn’t realise he’d said that out loud until Malfoy cleared his throat and turned back to Harry’s wardrobe. “Regardless,” Malfoy said, strained. “I’m not suggesting you keep the trunk in another flat. Simply that storing them amongst the items you wear isn’t a good way to preserve them. We’ll pick you up a preservation trunk today as well. Or two; one for keepsakes and one for formalwear.”
Harry measures his exhale in seconds to slow the flip in his stomach. He looks up at the canvas top of the tent. He doesn’t want to know what expression he's wearing that provoked Draco’s question, not that he's able to answer anyway. Draco’s right. They
“She didn’t tell you,” Malfoy said flatly. “About anything, I suppose. Ah.” He crossed his arms over his chest, slender biceps bunching under his shirt, and rolled his eyes. “Legal confidentiality. Did you even know to expect me?”
There are usually a few changes every time he returns from a trip. This time, Draco’s redone the bedding in soft, cosy shades of white, and spelled their window curtains into a breezy, translucent material; he’s also, of course, replaced the flowers on the teak side cabinet with pink camellias and an accent of baby’s breath.
“I— No,” Malfoy says, gaze on Harry's hands. He licks his lips, still straining for contact. “I— I killed— Before they could change. My coworkers. Two— of my,” his voice cracks, “friends. They were—”
“Not everyone goes around nabbing other people’s wands,” Draco said, narrowing his eyes at Harry’s hands. “But mine is on the sofa, and this couldn’t wait.”
Malfoy pressed his lips together and finally nodded, but said, “You should put them in a trunk if you’ve no plans on wearing them.”
to like each other, do we?” Malfoy said. His thumb danced over Harry’s slit, spread the precome around the head. Harry shuddered in response, blinking in a room blurry with faded colours as the first beams of sunrise spilled through the window. Hating Malfoy for being right.
Harry hesitated. Giving in to the temptation of using the Elder Wand still weighed on him a little, despite having made himself accountable to McGonagall’s opinion on the matter. But as McGonagall had pointed out, he was doing it to right a wrong, and with no expectation of power. Using the Elder Wand once every eight years under such selfless circumstances might be acceptable, she’d said, and there’d been no way for Harry to admit that it
Harry smiles bitterly and reaches for his own bag. He wishes he could tell Ron how much better about that he is these days.
“Fine,” I said, sniffing. “Only one of us has any common sense, then. I wish I could say I was surprised that it’s me, but...” I waved a hand at him.
“Well,” Narcissa says, tipping her head at the closed door, “while not particularly bright, the guards you set upon me may eventually be asked for more context about this morning’s conversation. Though Mr Potter’s reaction to the unfortunate news and your dramatic exit currently overwhelm finer details in their daily report, we must take what opportunities we are afforded, mustn’t we? ”
“Want to come on me, Harry?” he asks. It feels good to use Potter’s first name — here in the dark, they don’t have to be who they’ve always been to each other — and even better when Potter lets out a low gasp, and jerks into Draco’s fist.
“Yeah. What?” Harry ran his fingers through his hair, heart pounding, and turned back to his friends. His face was hot. “Sorry — I thought Teddy was going to fall.”
“It’s only as easy or hard as you make it,” Malfoy said and jerked a nod to the top tube of the bike’s frame. “Get on, I can show you.”
Malfoy gives his wrist another squeeze. Releasing it, he slumps against the pillows at his back, silent for a few measures as Harry studiously pays attention to the tension bleeding out of his own muscles, barely able to believe Teddy hasn’t woken up. Then Malfoy says, “Fuck, Potter.”
Starting on her garlic bread, Hermione seemed to mull that over. “I think for me to even consider giving you —
Hermione paces her office, cursing under her breath. She uses every wizarding term Ron’s inventiveness has taught her over the years, every Muggle term as well, sometimes in different languages, and applies them all to Narcissa Malfoy — who still won’t say a word. Won’t give a single inch. Who’s eating their food and living under the protection of their wards, who obviously wants something, but won’t say what. Won’t explain Ron’s sacrifice, won’t even look at the parchment Hermione’s held in front of her time and again over the last few days.
“Fine, I’m fine.” Draco swallowed hard and decided to demand another blood test before Healers released him.
“Okay.” Malfoy nods. “This is what’s going to happen: Edward and I are going to get cleaned up— yes, we are,” he says firmly, shifting to Teddy when Teddy lets out another tired sob, “and Harry is going to get cleaned up, and change your sheets, and I’ll tell you about the pumpkin and the shoes, how does that sound?”
Harry knelt in front of her. She was sweating like Hermione had, her cheeks a vexed red, her limbs starting to tremble. But she met his gaze unfalteringly. He set his hands on her waist and closed his eyes, pushing a burst of magic into her, the strongest anesthetising spell he knew. She inhaled loud and deep, as though breathing had been a struggle, and nodded for him to go on.
Wobbly-kneed, Harry shuffled Draco into the shower stall when it was over, a practical measure to address both Draco’s hygienic preferences and raging hard-on. He pressed Draco’s back to the tiles, kissed the tang of his own come from Draco’s lips. Curling his fist around Draco’s cock the way he knew Draco liked, he murmured in his ear: how gorgeous Draco was, and how good it felt in his mouth, and how much Harry had liked it. Delivering all the praise he hadn’t known he’d been storing inside himself for months. Under the spray of water, Draco sobbed out his orgasm against Harry’s cheek and clung to his shoulders, his gaze stark and shocked when he was finally able to open his eyes.
For nearly twenty years, Minerva’s office has been a haven, a stretch of placid waters in the midst of a turbulent sea. Hermione only wishes being in it still felt like enough to cheat some of her loneliness away.
He reluctantly pulled away from the kiss, but Harry stole his lips for another kiss. Draco had to put an end to it by pressing a hand on his chest.
“I feel so much more secure and at ease.” Draco smiled lightly, glad to be forgiven, happy that Harry still chose him.
Harry stared gloomily down at a four-foot-long parchment, quill scratching notes and corrections. Draco pitied the poor, unfortunate first year critiqued in the margins by the legendary Harry Potter, the man of everyone’s dreams.
He expected glaring, strong words cursed out at him magically or otherwise, but Harry’s eyes were red-rimmed.
The wind smacked hard against the window. The whistling from the vociferous blizzard sounded everywhere in Harry’s office, yet Draco could barely hear it. They kissed hungrily, lips smacking and groans tearing deep from their throats. Draco dug his fingers into Harry’s hair and tugged, drawing out a raspy breath. He gripped Harry’s hair so tight that he accidentally scratched his scalp.
The aches in Draco’s body and the fatigue dulling his mind bled into a dreamy nothingness. He closed his eyes and disengaged from the outside world, detecting only the sensation of Harry’s mouth. His heart pattered as their kisses discovered a lazy pace—the easiest, most relaxing activity he had done all day. His knees shook; he enveloped Harry in a serpentine embrace, the kind that he had perfected quite nicely over the years. He sat on Harry’s lap, the chair creaking and reclining from the added weight. He coiled an arm around Harry’s shoulders, palm firm on his scratchy jaw, and kept those lips right where he wanted them.
Soon enough, Harry caught the Snitch and Draco had never been so glad to lose to the Gryffindor Quidditch prodigy.
The night sky cloaked Hogwarts in a long and darker than black winter, the grounds blanketed with the coldest snow in years that was vengeful with its frost and constant blizzards. Wind shook the window of Harry’s office, flurries swirling and falling in tiny, white mountains on the ledge and diamond leaded bars. Draco’s attention had long waned from reading his O.W.L.s level students’ essays on Amortentia to instead focus on the blizzard, then the crescent moon illuminating the heavy, gray clouds, until finally, he grew content watching Professor Harry Potter mark up his pile of Defense Against The Dark Arts essays covering Dementors, the Patronus Charm, and the finer art of vigilance. They were grading the last of the essays before exams ruled everyone’s lives.
Harry stopped dead in his tracks, shoulders tensing. Draco encouraged himself not to cringe, waiting for the inevitable.
Draco stopped behind him and placed his hands on the back of Harry’s leather chair. He leaned his weight down and pulled Harry backward, forcing him to look up at Draco.
Harry looked at him out the corner of his eye. Draco tried not to fidget. “I was wondering,” said Harry lowly. “I don’t know who else to ask. Everyone else has been here for ages except for you. I did not expect to—I rather like my students. They remind me of my old owl, Hedwig.”
Draco reached out to him, his cold hand shaking without a mitten to keep it warm. “I have no good explanation, but I
” Harry jerked around to look right at Draco. Angry tears welled in his eyes and streaked down his cheeks. Draco ached to hold him.
Harry turned his chair around and spread his knees wide, trapping Draco between his legs. He reached up and grasped the end of Draco’s tie, pulling it softly. “Professor Malfoy,” he said, “you’re aware that my best marks in Potions were because I copied notes out of a book?”
Draco kissed his ear, then leaned back slightly to catch his eye. Somber, he thought. Melancholic. Heavy with a thousand memories that Draco doubted Harry would ever tell him. That cycle of loving and losing remained an unfortunate fixture in Harry’s life. He pulled Harry tighter, closer to where he ought to be—with Draco. There was a glimmer in his eyes that shone from the moonlight, or with tears that Harry did not want to fall, but it shone bright past the sadness, and Draco knew. Harry loved him, too.
Harry fell silent, glowering at his eggnog. Draco nudged his shoulder. When Harry looked at him, Draco smiled ruefully. “My family’s no better. They hated my ex-girlfriend. She wasn’t… She wasn’t proper, you could say. I don’t like to visit them after I invited her for the Christmas feast.”
Draco leaned into his broom and accelerated at breakneck speed, chasing Harry through the shadows of the Potter signature move of diving into utter chaos in pursuit of the Snitch. He cut through thick fir trees, foggy blindspots, branches whose sole purpose in life seemed to be decapitating benevolent, apologetic boyfriends.
The cold, foggy December winds nicked Draco’s numb cheeks as he flew against it and hunted for the Snitch that Harry had released just to spite him. Harry chased the Snitch, and Draco chased Harry.
Harry crashed into him so hard and fast that Draco clung to the broom for dear life, the Snitch bitterly cold against his skin. Harry kissed him like it could keep Draco in his life forever. Draco kissed him back just as hard.
The school day had ended ages ago, their minds sluggish and drowsy from dinner. It struck Draco as absurd that after a long, exhausting day of snow and gloomy clouds that Harry poured all of his remaining energy into that quill when he ought to focus on more worthwhile pursuits. Namely, Draco.
“You know… she delivered the mail well; they performed a spell well. I’m happy for them. It’s exciting. Malfoy, why are you still here?”
Draco bolted as fast as his broom allowed. He flew around Harry and halted in midair just in front of him.
They bolted toward the tiny cabin they had meant to cozy up in together over Christmas, but Draco’s invitation may as well have been rescinded, if Hermione Granger’s baffled owl demanding to know why Harry had sunk into a dark mood carried any credence. But Harry had not seemed
He had incepted in Harry the idea of extending an olive branch to the Dursleys. He was big on olive branches over the last year. After all, Harry had extended one to him and he’d extended one to his father to spectacular results. As they had walked through the quiet Muggle neighborhood on the way to the Dursleys’ house, wishing a good day to an old married couple walking a beagle that took too kindly to sniffing Draco’s leg, all Draco could think of was the night Aunt Bella had taken him to a similar neighborhood and taught him the Cruciatus Curse. He had knocked on the door to the Dursleys’ home. And right after he had Disapparated to sob underneath a grand oak tree in a nearby park that they had passed on the way over.
Harry held Draco’s face, his cold palms and the frigid Snitch in his hand drawing out the warmth in Draco’s cheeks.
In the year that Harry first taught Defense Against The Dark Arts, he had stayed at the school over Christmas. Draco could not fathom it. Malfoy Manor had been cold, drab, and haunted by a quiet that was broken only by the memories lurking in the shadows of rooms no one dared to enter anymore. Harry had the massive, jolly Weasleys waiting for him—their dilapidated home, woodburning fires, those hideous sweaters. What in Merlin’s name was the prick doing still at Hogwarts while his lovely family waited for him? The Hogwarts Express had pulled out of the station like clockwork. Apparition was not affected by the weather.
Smirking, Draco rose, stretching his arms high and feeling a luxurious pull in his shoulders and back. He scratched roughly at the light scruff that had grown over the day. The tip of Harry’s quill poised over the parchment, his shoulders a little tense.
Harry kissed him fiercely, gripping his thigh hard and rocking the chair back, banging it into the desk. They kissed until Draco forgot when they had started kissing, and the only thoughts in mind were marveling at how good Harry felt in his arms and wondering why he had never thought to spend Christmas with Harry Potter for every year that he had known him. Where else ought they be but together?
“I don’t care if you’re sorry,” bit out Harry, then roughly ran a hand through his black hair. “I didn’t mean—I mean. I’m not angry at you. I hate that you left me.” He touched the broomstick. “Look at me.”
disappointed to see Draco when he had arrived… When Draco’s unexpected Apparation tripped a protective charm, Harry had flung open the door with his wand braced for battle, but upon noticing that only Draco stood on his doorstep, he looked rather aggrieved. Tried. Not disappointed. A worthwhile sign. Draco began to recite the apology he spent all night crafting, which spurred Harry to charge back inside and fetch a Snitch and a broom for a restorative round of avoiding the issue through Quidditch, not even bringing a broom for Draco. He had to conjure one out of a stick.
Like a smug little Slytherin with a grudge, he approached Harry one evening at dinner with eggnog in hand and a clever quip on the tip of his tongue. “Well, did you regress the intellect of our future generations, or not?”
Draco leaned back and peered at him. “Careful. I might get jealous. I thought I was your archnemesis.”
He only had to convince Harry to walk through the door just beside the bookshelves, the one that lead to Harry’s bedroom. It would not take much. What Harry lacked in observation he more than made up for in brisk execution.
Draco slipped a hand over Harry’s shoulder, lightly tracing his fingertips along Harry’s neck, mesmerized by the scratchiness of the dark shadows over his jaw. Harry’s throat bobbed beneath his hand. Draco never once beckoned Harry to relax and let Draco’s touch guide him, yet still, Harry rested into his palm as though Draco were a pillow. He rubbed Harry’s earlobe between his fingers and watched those green eyes flicker and droop closed.
“I want to see the look on Uncle Vernon’s face when I introduce him to my wizard boyfriend who can legally perform magic outside of Hogwarts.”
Tossing down his quill, Draco stretched out and leaned far back until his chair creaked and his foot nudged Harry’s under the desk.
“Divorced.” Harry lifted his goblet but looked down to ponder the eggnog, a frown line forming. “Mrs. Weasley said I’m always welcome. I believe that she believes it.”
Draco had Apparated to this lonesome cabin in the wilderness to apologize for a poor decision on his part that had, admittedly, been nothing short of horrendously catastrophic. But frankly, at this point, part of Draco wanted a little grovelling from Harry over ruining what could have been the apology of the century.
Harry took a long drink of eggnog. “Everyone says that Professor Malfoy is their favorite. The first years start out Potions by making fudge.”
Harry nipped at his bottom lip before biting down, hard and desperate. Perhaps he wondered if all of this between them was real. Forever.
Harry was the greatest riddle of Draco’s life. He hadn’t wanted to befriend him in first year. His father had ordered him to keep The Boy Who Lived close and make him an ally, a friend. Draco hadn’t understood it as an eleven-year-old, but, in fifth year, the puzzle pieces fell into the realization that his father had plotted to spy on and potentially murder the boy he’d encouraged Draco to turn into a dear friend. Retrospectively, Harry had been smart to reject Draco’s hand, but in the narrow corridor of the Hogwarts Express in September of 1991, Draco only had to take one look into those deep green eyes before he hated how cold his lonesome palm felt after Harry made his choice and his choice wasn’t Draco.
Harry glanced over his shoulder, the chaos of want building in him at those two words, at what they implied. But it would mean detaching from Malfoy, at least long enough to walk a few steps from the tree to Malfoy’s flat rock, and he was hit with a flash of worry that in the time it took, one or both of them would change their mind. Harry couldn’t even remember making up his mind to begin with, just that course of heat from his scalp to his toes flushing through him when Malfoy went to investigate the bicycle, then turned on Harry with a grin that looked like Christmas morning.
Draco flashed him a look, then turned back to the clock. “It’s been a long few years,” he said, as though that explained everything. Maybe it did.
“So you’ve never talked about it?” Malfoy asks when they’ve gone through most of the food, apropos of nothing. He breaks a piece of chocolate from the end of his bar, not looking up. There’s a watchfulness to his posture, even to his lack of eye-contact, that feels deliberate.
“That presents a problem,” Harry said. The aftermath of Draco’s revitalisation, even just a few seconds’ worth, left him giddy. Sure. Like taking a sip of Felix. He huffed a laugh and rolled his hips once with a rumble of pleasure, but stopped when Draco managed to, somehow, poker up even more. “Because that’s the second thing: I need a plus-one for the gala Sunday night.”
Draco scoffed and pushed at Harry’s shoulders, glaring at him disapprovingly when Harry snagged a last kiss, but returning the kiss all the same. His cheeks were bright red, and he stayed wilted against the reception desk for a few seconds, propped on his hands behind him as he caught his breath. “I have to— I’m not cancelling, but I’ll have to Apparate by yours in a bit.”
,” not knowing if he was begging to be fucked or simply to be put out of his torment. Draco made the decision for him with a curl of his tongue into Harry’s rim and a final, obscenely slurping suck as he pulled off. He tilted his head, nipped the crease where Harry’s buttock met his thigh, and stood, plastering himself to Harry’s back. Lips on the curls at the base of Harry’s hairline, he inched his hips away and reached between them with a small grunt, pressing his cock between Harry’s arse cheeks.
He’s got used to compartmentalising since the Spread. Each of his team members went fast, one moment themselves, the next — not. Moving or unmoving didn’t seem to make much of a difference. Dead is dead, and Harry has mostly been able to push aside any feelings on that in favour of focussing on the next countermeasure, the next evasion, the next step forward. One after another until his body is too exhausted to move, his mind too weary for logic. And he’s tired now, already. He feels raw all over by having heard another human voice, by having touched someone and been touched, no matter that it’s someone he used to hate and now can't even really claim to know. Malfoy lies on the bed, unmoving, his cheeks hollow with hunger, his clavicle a sharply angled wing under the fabric of his robes. Harry’s almost afraid to do anything — any gentleness he’s managed to retain has been buried with the rest of his softness to better allow for survival, and he doesn’t know if he can access it in the way he’ll surely need to get Malfoy back up.
Kreacher’s breath hitched. “Master Malfoy is calling Kreacher last night and saying he is not feeling proper, he is asking Kreacher for some Pepper-Up and saying it be helping, but then calling later for stronger potions, he is saying ‘that should do it’, when he is drinking them and smiling at Kreacher, but he is not looking right,” he said, information tumbling fast and froggy from his throat. “He is wanting Master Harry not to know, ‘Don’t mention me to Master Potter, do you understand me, Kreacher, I am fine,’ he is saying to me, ‘It is nothing,’ he is saying, and telling Kreacher that Harry Potter cannot know because he would be loving Master Malfoy being sick, but then still is saying no when Kreacher tells him Master Harry is the defender of even house-elves and would take care of him, he is saying we cannots be troubling you at all, ‘I am forbidding it, Kreacher, I refuse to give him the satisfaction,’ but when Kreacher is checking on him again he is writing letters for help that do not be leaving the house, and—”
“It’s…” Malfoy turns a veiled gaze on him. “It’s fine. But it’s not wise to go off without letting the other one know,” he says. “Especially with our resources. I know you’ve got some
"Who?" Harry says, voice raspy. Cracking. His chest, god, it's sticky with come. His stomach. And there are other smells. All over his hands, all over the room. They tear a whine from his throat. "Who was—? Did I hurt—?"
Malfoy ran his fingers over the fine powder on the table, smearing Harry’s hand prints there, then rubbed his fingers against his thumb thoughtfully. “This is what—?”
Their chests were slick, rubbing together. The slap of their bodies was loud, their gasps. All of it so focused, melting down into something sweating, straining, splendid. Harry slipped his hand down from Draco’s throat, fit it between them. Draco’s cock was slippery, with sweat, with precome, hot in Harry’s palm, rigid as Draco’s body went at his touch. Harry twisted his fist around it, thumbing the silky skin under the exposed head, clumsily, earnest.
“I don’t think the word ‘just’ is even a little defensible in that sentence,” she said, giving him such a look of dismay that Harry had to look away. “Oh, Harry. If I’d known that sending you to him would… That you’d… That…”
The simpering, jealous girl who still adored Draco as much as she ever seemed to back then. Perhaps more.
"Yes, how realistic to already expect trust or respect from… From your people. I think what we have here is a keen watch on me." Draco scoffed, a dry sound in the back of his throat. "At least she's got nothing to pin on me lately."
Harry looks up. The sun is still up but getting lower in the sky, and he’s not chuffed to stay submerged and get frozen in place, but Malfoy’s been reading Hermione’s numbers for a few minutes and he still has the blanket Harry was hoping to use to dry off. He starts to call out, but something about the way Malfoy is listing almost drunkenly where he stands makes Harry head for the rocks and search for his glasses. He’s barely got them on when he heaves himself from the water, pausing only to grab his wand and almost losing his balance on the rocks as he nearly runs to Malfoy’s side.
They kissed for a long time, so long that Draco’s lips started feeling swollen and chafed, the skin around his mouth over-sensitive from the stubble on Potter’s cheeks. His neck felt bruised and his cock ached, but he didn’t want to stop, didn’t even want to
Ron whispered on their honeymoon when she teasingly asked him why he loved her. She’d squirmed a little, having expected some ribald comment about sex. He’d still been firm inside her, his cheeks flushed, and he’d pulled her down so they were pressed against each other, her breasts squashed against his chest. His big hands had come up to frame her face.
The story begins like this: The world was nothing once but lonely particles floating in space. The universe formed from their collisions, they were so desperate for contact. Earth had no focus and was chaotic, too hot to create life and too combustible to sustain it, until two motes of magic, small but powerful, were drawn to one another from across the furthest reaches of it though they hated each other. They clashed, and fought when they couldn’t get separate, so they tried to coalesce but couldn’t do that either.
Narcissa hides another smile. Granger’s resignation of post changes little, and it’s a rare pleasure to oppose someone who has both the perception to look five moves ahead and the willingness to sacrifice their queen if necessary.
Swiftness and stealth are traits he's had all his life — learned first at the Dursleys, used later at Hogwarts, and perfected in the Auror Corp. But this time, when he needs them most, they fail him; the shard of glass sticking up from the sill snags his jeans. It cracks and falls to the pavement with a resounding shatter. Harry snaps his head over.
Which meant at least one thing: Draco, wherever he was, wasn’t hurt. Harry could take his time figuring out the rest.
“Well, I learned my lesson, didn’t I?” Harry said, exasperated. He’d probably never understand how Malfoy could be so contradictory. Wasn’t sure if he wanted to, even if the idea that he and Malfoy could be friendly occasionally gave him a warm feeling inside. “I thought I demonstrated that well enough by breaking your nose.”
Thrown as much by the direction as the fact that Draco turned to walk away, Harry said, “Why don’t you—?” but broke off at the exceedingly patient look Draco gave him. He lingered by the curtain, waiting. Harry absentmindedly flicked his wand over his shoulder, and a shaky exhale burst from his lungs. He held his wand tighter, feeling the flutter of responsive magic skate up his arm, a like-new feeling akin to the one he’d felt when Ollivander first found it for him, when the wood seemed to glow against his skin. He cast another set of wards, just to see, and found it similarly powerful. “Jesus.”
“Twelve hours then,” Draco says, giving him a long, even look. Harry fights the urge to break their gaze. Fights the heat rising in his cheeks. But he doesn’t really regret deciding to retire early, no matter how unwise it may have been. They could have easily covered a few more kilometres before calling a halt, could have perhaps taken the time to find a shelter further off the beaten path. But the last few nights have been such a convenient escape from the press of his thoughts — something Harry hadn’t realised he’d needed so badly. And Draco’s touch that afternoon, sweetly, unconsciously proprietary, had felt like a
“Let me, Harry,” he says. Potter’s flat stomach ripples; he hesitates. Draco swallows and presses his cheek to Potter’s, breathes it directly into his ear. “
“Well, not today,” Draco drawled. Harry ticked him a glance. Flushed. Draco’s gaze was moving up and down his body. Harry pulled on his pants, then his bottoms, and Draco clicked his tongue. “In school, yes. A few times.”
Harry — the real, live Harry Potter, whom I’d very definitely shagged — lifted his head. His hair was a disaster, as though he’d been caught in an electricity-dampening spell, and he gave me a disgruntled scowl before fumbling his glasses on. His expression shifted to one of concern, something that might have bothered me, if I had any expectation of lasting through the next minute. As it was, I couldn’t really breathe or feel my face.
She strolls to the fireplace and lifts the single photograph that’s been tipped onto its face. Granger’s wedding day. She and Weasley are looking at each other, and the lower half of Granger’s cathedral veil loops around the small of Weasley’s back, to pull him closer. A backdrop of fairy lights lends a warm glow to their smiles, but there’s something awkward about their positioning — the pose is clearly staged, but their stillness looks unintentional. “Very pretty. This is magical, is it not? What happens next?”
to flaunt all of his many contradictions, and it pissed Draco off so badly, he cursed and came all over the side of Potter’s sofa.
Draco closed his stance and reached between them, filling his hand with Potter’s prick. It was hot, wet, slippery at the slit, and Draco thought of how Potter might respond if he toyed with him a bit, but then two more students came in, talking loudly above the sound of both showers, and Potter’s exasperated sigh warmed Draco’s cheeks. Draco grinned and fit Potter’s prick between his thighs.
it could be. Granted, he and Draco hadn’t precisely talked about, well, anything yet, but Harry considered it promising that the nerves Draco rubbed wrong could be so easily soothed by… this. Harry took off his glasses and slid to the floor.
It’s a rather tacit way of giving Draco the option to say he wants to find another way across the Channel. Of letting him decline the risk. And it
"So, not demoted, but shunned. How fun." You click your tongue since you can do nothing else, and decline to answer her unspoken question. "Well, it's not as if I have no experience in
Potter’s brows go up then, but he reaches behind himself to grab the blanket and hold it out. Draco takes it and climbs from the water, shaking it out and wrapping it around his shoulders. The warmth of day has bled away since he’s been in the water, and Potter’s going to have an even colder time of it, but that doesn’t seem to bother him. He tugs off his sling and shirt with one hand, then looks at Draco. “A little help?”
Harry moved away to let him roll to his back and peeled their blankets down. Draco’s thighs parted expectantly for him, his cock tenting his bottoms, a damp patch darkening the faded blue fabric, and Harry’s mouth flooded with saliva. He swallowed and hunched over him, hooking his forearms under Draco’s knees to jerk him closer so they were plastered together. Draco blinked up at him, his eyes hazy. The weight of his arms slipping around Harry’s shoulders secured him in place; with a childish ache, Harry thought he might float away without them. They kissed, and kissed again, a third time, a fourth, Draco’s mouth opening under his without reservation, his moan like a sigh — and then louder,
I pushed him off and attempted a glare but my heart wasn’t in it, and anyway, I’d caught his yawn. It had to be after midnight. I just needed to close my eyes. I’d know how to deal with the repercussions of shagging my worst enemy in a moment.
“I—” My throat closed up. Potter flashed me another smile and stepped forward, between my splayed legs. He dragged his fingertips over the loose waistband of my trousers, my boxers, carefully avoiding contact with my cock, and then abruptly grabbed them and tugged them down, hard enough for the fabric to burn my arse. I hissed and lifted my hips, and Potter wrangled my clothing off, kneeling down as he went. He plucked one of my shoes off, the other, gaze flicking from my prick to my face, breath ghosting over my bollocks. He raised his eyebrows questioningly.
Then Malfoy's knee slid to rest on the inside of Harry’s thigh. He began thrusting. Less tentative than before, steady — even, measured strokes of his long prick out to the tip and back in. His head moved away from Harry’s shoulder, his thumb digging into the muscle of Harry’s arse cheek. Pulling him further open as he fucked him. With a start, Harry realised that Malfoy was — was
, okay? He’s never seen me mad and he was scared I’d, I don’t know, hit him when he calmed down, or make him sit in it for days, or lock him in the bathroom without something to eat, whatever,” not in control at all apparently, because his voice is clogged and cracking, and he thinks he’s going to sick up, horrible images filling his mind on a loop, Teddy’s features transposed over his own, and
evil before getting called back?” he asks with a touch of wry sympathy. Harry hesitates, and Draco frowns. “Did someone get hurt?”
Draco blinks. “I suppose so.” He hadn’t even thought about it, though if the magic Silencing him about the work they did on Nine was still in effect, there's a very real chance he would have choked to death. “I’m a developer of magical instruments and objects, specialising in configuring common spells to suit the undercover needs of the black ops and special forces teams. My team has made half of the defensive mystical items that your group have been so fond of using the last five years.”
“We’ll count that as your turn,” Draco says, so smoothly Harry quirks him another smile without thinking.
“And so you came to Pansy,” Draco deadpanned, looking from one of them to the other when they exchanged a glance, “who you don’t share any classes with.”
“No, I—” Draco says. The last thing he wants is for this to turn into another argument. “I know you’re not. I only meant that because she didn’t give clear instruction, Granger must have thought…”
If he’d held any hope Malfoy’s reaction would equal how big it felt to say, Malfoy dashed it immediately; he gave Harry a small nod and said, “I know.”
Harry got to his feet and flicked his wand, grimly pleased by the shatter of porcelain against the flagstones and the dull, scattering thump of the cherries a scant second later. Malfoy’s grin disappeared, his eyes shuttering, and Harry pointed his wand at the open French doors. “Find somewhere else to eat.”
Potter shook  his head. “But let’s go somewhere private,” he said, absently Summoning their brooms. He laced his fingers through Draco’s and tugged on his hand. “Where we can talk.”
"What're you waiting for?" Ron said. "I'd like to get my bride," he pointedly elbowed George in the stomach, lips quirking at George's guffaw, "home before New Year's."
Harry sits up. He straightens his glasses and watches Malfoy in silence as Malfoy hunts for his wand, as he flicks a cleaning charm over himself. Malfoy shoots Harry a wary glance, wiping the back of his wrist over lips that are swollen and pink from Harry’s kisses, then crouches to collect the files that fell from his desk. His skin is still flushed, his hair a mess. Harry struggles to catch his breath, looking at him.
“Ron.” Harry gently set Hermione aside. He wondered if the house knew how to slip its inhabitants into different dimensions. “It’s— it’s his home, too.”
why you’ve never come back? Draco, you’ve only seen my basement. My house is fine. I mean, messier than yours, maybe, but that can probably be said of most hospitals, too. Come with me; I’ll show you. I’ll take you out to lunch first,” he says, temptingly. As though Draco’s non-response to his question last night about their status has completely settled things in his mind. He’s completely daft for thinking so, and completely irritating for not being wrong.
Evasive truce over, Malfoy was suddenly, constantly underfoot, seeming to, if possible, have even fewer qualms about entertaining himself at Harry’s expense. He knew too many of Harry’s pressure points, could trigger them with minimal effort and devastating accuracy, using nothing more than a well-timed smirk and a lifted brow. Like a virus, he encroached on Harry’s space, swallowing the numb inertia of Harry’s days, transforming it into something else.
“I am not,” Draco lied. She filched one of the madelines from the box he’d brought — it was his present for that day, an arrangement of delicacies from his favorite patisserie in Paris — and made way for the door anyway. Draco leaned out of the way as she opened it.
Malfoy collapses into Harry’s arms, his head sagging on Harry’s shoulder. But he’s breathing, and the horror on his face has been chased away by the slack of unconsciousness. Harry taps his cheek lightly with one palm and sighs when Malfoy’s only movement is a brief fluttering of his lashes. He doesn’t stir, and when Harry lifts him up, he understands why: Malfoy is light as a feather, his muscle and fat stores depleted after who knows how long he’s spent starving in here. He places Malfoy on the bed, a new flicker of unease rippling through him.
“Malfoy’s not an easy thing to get over,” he said. “But we’ve been trying. I didn’t— see it, until Christmas. That it was more than… trying your best to get along, making the most out of a shit situation. ‘Mione thought, maybe… Only I think it was hard for her to accept, too. He’s never apologised, not really.”
Shoving it back into his holster, he searches the ground until he picks out the slight swell of powdery snow covering something, hints of red underneath. Draco’s face isn’t covered, but he’s so pale he blends in with the environment, his lips alarmingly blue. Harry forces his legs forward, the pain a distant third to his horror, his panic. He bends over Draco, hands so clumsy he immediately gives up trying to get the snow off Draco in favour of shoving his hands beneath his torso and hauling him up. Draco gives a low, weak moan and slumps against him, knees buckling. With the surge of energy his relief gives him, Harry snarls and put his back into it.
him: how to make the comfort he offered less about himself than someone else’s. When Draco lost a patient or woke up shaking from a nightmare, Harry listened, and pulled together the threads of what he knew about Draco, to become whatever Draco needed.
“Come on,” is all Potter says. His face is grim. “We’ve got to set up before it gets dark.” He fumbles his bag off his shoulder and finds a map within one of its pockets, unfolding it and scanning it with a brief nod. He closes it up and stuffs it in the pocket of his worn joggers instead of putting it where it belongs, then hefts his bag once more. “Can you walk?”
did,” Malfoy muttered, flicking Harry an uncertain glance when he laughed. His blind search of the table found him a napkin, and Malfoy began patting his shirt with it, his tie, the newspaper he’d been holding, then sighed and grabbed his wand, spelling it all dry with another mutter. He cleared his throat and stood up straight. “Hello, Potter.”
“That’s fine,” Harry said, nodding again. “Yeah, of course, I’m asking a lot of you. Charge me. I’d love it if you charged me.” Ron’s chewing slowed, gaze narrowing, and Harry smiled his most virtuous,
Harry paused. The crushing seriousness of Malfoy’s tone finally sank in, blotting out the direction of Harry’s thoughts. He gulped once— nodded. “Yeah. Okay.” He tilted his head up Malfoy, who was staring down at him with a small frown pinching the bridge of his nose, and said, “Okay. I’ll Owl— either way.”
” Harry stalked up to Pansy and handed over Draco’s letter. She took it with a single, arched brow, a familiar mask of polite derision. It was the same one Draco wore so frequently, Harry felt like he’d just swallowed a whole bottle of Polyjuice — his insides slimy and squirming alive, his skin stretching too tight.
“We all have one,” Draco said. His lashes swept low. Under them, Harry saw Draco’s eyes move to his mouth, move away. “Everyone in my mother’s line. Hers is behind her left ear, here.” He pushed his hair back, touched the spot. The tip of his ear had turned as pink as the warm, inviting flush on his face, like he knew that Harry suddenly wanted to kiss him there, and in the spot he’d touched, and on the back of his neck. Like it had just occurred to him, as well, that they were bare hours until Saturday; until they’d be able to touch, and breathe into each other, and find release — though never for too long, and never very deep, and always more restrained than Harry wanted, since the day Harry had gone to his knees for him.
“So,” Hannah said, cheerful as ever at a mixer a few weeks later, when Draco returned from the loo, “you and Harry are… together?”
“It’s only been…” Harry thought about it — realised they’d been stuck together for over six weeks. He felt like he’d been sleep-walking through most of the month, his life stolen in more ways than one. The world bent around him, righted. He straightened his shoulders. “A few weeks. After last night, we should be able to avoid—”
The silk vanished, and a small plume of smoke rose between them. Hermione coughed at Harry’s side, gasped, and Ron did too. And Bill, and Luna, Arthur and Narcissa, all of their faces taking on hints of colour again. The solicitor clapped his hands together, once, then took out a handkerchief from his pocket and dabbed at his shiny forehead.
to Death every time he walked past the treeline, the moments he felt a cold breeze on the back of his neck and thought he might see his mum when he turned, those eerie howls he heard coming from deep in the forest sometimes, that probably sounded nothing like Padfoot had, but made Harry smile all the same. But Malfoy didn’t seem to expect a more involved answer than Harry had already given — seemed a bit overwhelmed by what Harry
“I did wait for you to come to me, after you ran from the Astronomy Tower — Rose is fine, of course? — but when a request for assistance isn’t forthcoming, it behoves one to be proactive.” Stirring her tea slowly, Narcissa adds, “You can only imagine my dismay upon summoning the Headmistress to find Minerva McGonagall at my door.”
He’d got so many of them, plus ones Pansy hadn’t written down: Potter helping him with the recipe, an autographed edition of Newt Scamander’s biography. Other things.
“Oh fuck,” he mutters as Harry curls his fingers around Draco’s cock and starts jerking. “Oh, fuck, I can feel all of you, I knew— I knew it’d feel—
Malfoy hops up. Gritting his teeth, Harry does too — watching Malfoy's languid stretch. It displays the soft, white-blond curls under his arms and lifts the hem of his shirt to bare a strip of pale skin. His nipples are tight through the cotton of his tank. Peaked. Harry looks away, refusing to visit Paris twice in one morning, and Malfoy drops his arms with a low, quiet chuckle.
Pansy squeaked, and Draco stepped forward with real concern. “Leave one what empty? What was that light? Pansy, what did you—?
“It’s mostly fallen. Some Unspeakables made it here as the Floos were shutting down, a few Aurors and some Healers from St Mungo’s managed to get some patients here. We got a lot of people from the village. There’s very little outside help to be had, but we do have people monitoring what’s going on with the available magic. We’re working on it, okay?”
But Draco’s long wondered how things might have been different had Lucius not decided his priorities, his loyalties, so early in life. If he’d been willing to examine them more closely later on.
Hastily, Ron says, "Both of you, I mean, yeah. Both of you. Yeah, you… We just got you into a room before anyone got hurt, put up," he clears his throat, "charms, to prevent—"
“You can look,” Robards said, unbothered. “My pay packet is generous, but perfectly legal, my increases in salary agreed upon by the majority of the Wizengamot. It was poor judgement on your part that you never questioned my version of why our department’s budget is so low.” He smirked. “I’m proud of you, actually. Lesson learned. Constant vigi—”
Draco’s frame stilled for one tense, quivering moment. He stared at the drink. “Well,” he said. “Well.”
Harry grimaced. But he remembered Lucius pleading with Voldemort for Draco’s life, remembered him and Narcissa screaming for their son as they’d torn through the castle on that last, chaotic night. “I never said that. What were they trying to talk to you into doing?”
They think they remember what it was like, but memories have a way of fading over time. It’s been ten years, five months, and one day since the last time their names were on its list.
Hermione nods. Her hair is a mess. She combs through it with her fingers, then ties it up with one of the spare hairbands in her desk as Minerva hesitates. She shakes the creases from her robes, absently missing the luxury of simple ironing charms. Not that it ultimately matters if her clothing is wrinkled — it’s not as though she has anyone to impress.
It's unnerving, the silence. The soft echo of his footfalls. He knows he's not the only one living in the area but it feels like it. Yesterday, he saw some scavengers roaming the street, covered head-to-foot in leather and quiet as the grave. Muggles, perhaps — none of them seemed to have a wand, or even a wand-holster. It gave him hope and he almost called out to them, but quickly cut off the words gathering in his throat; his magical signature might have put them in more danger. Nothing to be done about it now.
Harry didn’t. He kissed Malfoy hard instead, breathing into it — committing to memory what little time they had left.
Lulled by Malfoy’s muttering and still half asleep, Harry considered just sliding sideways and taking a kip as Malfoy got on with it, but then Malfoy tossed a t-shirt in one of the piles — he’d made four — and said, “Burn it,” under his breath, and Harry’s eyes shot open with a burst of adrenaline.
Harry went home, determined to let him think. He expected several more weeks to pass before Draco came to any conclusions; since Hogwarts, Draco had become something of a compulsive over-thinker regarding significant decisions he had to make. Understanding that was the only thing that had kept Harry from tearing his hair out after waking up with Draco gone from his bedside. But Draco, possibly defending his title as the Most Contrary Arsehole Ever, sent an Owl later that night:
Draco swallows, resolutely ignoring the feel of Harry’s heat against his body from shoulder to knee. Ignoring the way Harry does nothing to control the shudder that ripples through him as he applies pressure with his hand to plaster them together, nestling his twitching prick against the crevice of Draco’s arse. Ignoring, as well as he can, how his own body responds to the sensation.
Draco shook his head, pushing faster into Potter’s hand. “I don’t know,” he choked. “Something other people don’t know. A secret. So I can tell you one.”
Harry never comments on it, doesn’t seem to mind more than a sleepy frown at Draco indicates, but Draco would just as soon avoid blatant reminders that might instigate his more graphic dreams.
want it — and he didn’t. More and less than he’d ever wanted anything, his limbs trembling with need, his stomach sour and knotted tight. He thumbed himself into position and pushed in, opening his eyes to meet Malfoy’s glare. Keeping them open, even when they wanted to fall shut, because Malfoy was— he was so tight, his rim clamping in resistance upon Harry’s entry, right around the head of his prick. He was wet inside, too, and Harry pushed deeper with a determined grunt, the rival sensations of his body and heart and brain coalescing into a stubbornness to
"She just ate a lot of the onion tartlets, is all," Harry said, taking Hermione by the shoulders when she snorted and rolled her eyes. "Got to prepare myself a bit, don't I?"
Harry felt helpless with it, the room spinning about them. He fucked into Draco faster, sweat chilling his temples even as his hair dried, and hunched in to kiss him, whispering, “Come to— the gala— with me,” punctuating the order with three hard pumps that made him squeeze his eyes shut for fear of coming, and slid Draco’s arse back. Harry yanked him up to the lip of the counter again, Draco’s thighs tensing as he lifted his hips to meet Harry’s thrusts, his eyelashes fluttering when Harry straightened.
Draco’s jaw flexes. He tosses his wand at Harry, who’s so startled he nearly fumbles the catch, and says, “How did you mean it? What did you think would happen?”
“I’m— not—” Harry drags in some air as Malfoy adjusts his stance, tugs his hips back and up. Higher. “—very…
“Draco’s the oldest of us, did you know that?” she asked. Her lips curled in a nasty little smile. “Of course not, you don’t even know his birthday.”
He escorted Harry to an entirely different room than Blaise had brought him to before, to Harry's initial relief. Rather than a large closet of sorts filled with clothing hung in rows, bits of parchment Spell-o-Taped to their collars or sleeves, Harry saw a more standard tailoring chamber. A raised pedestal sat in the middle of the room; mirrors on each wall cast a series of infinite reflections. Where there was space, multi-coloured swatches of fabric gleamed in the abundant light, draped expectantly over hangers affixed to the bare spaces on the walls and fluttering as if waiting for the opportunity to be used — exotic burnt oranges and shades of turquoise Harry’d only seen in pictures of Grecian seas, reds so rich and liquid they looked like they belonged in a wine glass, and greens that made Harry itch to feel the grass of a Quidditch pitch under his bare feet.
Draco eases off the desk. Some instinct has him backing him into the corner. He watches helplessly as Harry glares at the ground, then suddenly rips a metal drawer from the tall filing cabinet and throws it against the loo door. Harry shoves the cabinet onto its side, then attacks the one standing next to it, and anything else in his reach — he sweeps the desk of its electronics; he sends folders flying; he systematically decimates the office piece by piece until everything is shambles around him. And when the Inferi below are howling once more and there’s nothing left to destroy, Harry snarls with animalistic frustration and turns to slam his fist into the wall with cracking force, again and again and again, plaster dust fogging the air between them, and all Draco can do is… wait. By the time Harry wilts, what's left of the section of wall he's been pummeling is smeared bloody, and the Inferi below sound like they're rioting. Harry slumps, shoulders heaving. Draco unlocks his muscles and walks through the evidence of Harry’s devastation, careful not to trip.
It shouldn’t be. For either of them. Fidelity wasn’t a thing they owed one another, not like this, and perhaps neither was faith. But what Draco wasn’t saying felt more profound than the coil of their names etched on Harry’s wrist:
“Of course not,” Draco said, pushing him away. Potter rose to his knees, hair dry and more disheveled than ever, face pink.
, was what she couldn’t bring herself to say. They needed an attestation for the— Oh, god. Harry closed his eyes.
“Bastard,” Draco breathes, mind stuttering to a grating halt. Frozen with indecision, he looks to his transfigured wand, gleaming wet and sharp under the lash of rain, then scans the storm-tossed cluster of trees. He’s a talented duellist when he can use magic, but hasn’t had any real hand-to-hand combat training, and the only physical fracas he’s been party to in the last ten years consisted mainly of running, the night the world ended. He doesn’t even know if he could bring himself to even brandish the weapon his wand has become. Not again.
Self-involved, annoying, ungrateful, bitchy, uncompromising, petty… Sometimes lonely and sad, perhaps. Brilliant, creative, clever and funny, fit, pragmatic, incredibly loyal. Annoying a few more times and I know this is more than ten words but so what, god it's just a
Draco tilts him a wry, knowing smile. “That,” he clicks his tongue, “sounds absolutely nothing like him.”
Draco's Dark Mark had faded to a few shades darker than his skin over the years. Harry took it in, the blurry lines shaping the coil of the snake, the skull he could see a little if he squinted. He hadn’t applied much thought to it in years, not as anything other than something Draco was ashamed of having, or that Harry might need to defend him over; hadn’t wanted to, maybe.
“I could have told you that already, after having seen your reaction on the street a few nights ago,” Draco said. “I should have realised how much of your magic is connected to your pleasure centre. But I’m not finding any problems; if it’s been muffled, it’s only been marginally so.” His hands lifted off Harry, and there was a rustling sound, the small pop of something being uncorked. Citrus this time. Draco put his palms flat on each of Harry’s shoulder blades, slippery with oil. “You haven’t been sleeping well since you got that Owl from your boss.”
It was unhurried, as though he knew I’d be gone if he went any faster, or it could have been posturing; he had to know what he looked like on top, coppery nipples tightened to hard points, his stomach and thighs rippling with tension and his cock slapping gently over the flat of my belly on each downstroke. He looked shameless, like every wet dream I’d ever had and some I never could have thought up on my own, eyes dark and skin blotchy with arousal, the rise and fall of his body driving me closer and closer to my climax. Helplessly, I ran my hands up to his chest and back down; I wanted to touch every part of him, wanted to
“Get what?” Draco’s strides didn’t even falter for a second, a tiny, baffled check on his forehead. The perfect fit of his trousers drew Harry’s eye to the length of his legs as he walked, to the flexing curve of his arse.
He spent the next few hours researching whether it was possible to make an Unbreakable Vow with oneself, if it pertained to something simple like not fucking someone you were sort of sure you shouldn’t be, even if you hadn’t yet figured out the reason. Finding a spell that ought to work wasn’t precisely the relief Draco thought it would be, but he copied it down, regardless. He stared at it, poured himself three fingers of whiskey even though it disagreed with his system, and put the spell in a drawer when Potter finally arrived.
