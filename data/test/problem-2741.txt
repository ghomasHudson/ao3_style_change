“He will sleep in my house… after my Uncles deal with him,” Harry said. Draco’s face brightened with realization. Harry shook his head and sighed, “We are in so much trouble Draco,” he said seriously.
Harry just nodded before looking up, “Yes, it’s true,” he said. “I was treated horribly because I was magic and because I was my parents, Lily and James’s, son. They’ve locked me away in a cupboard under the stairs where I lived for eleven years. They beat me, made me do all of their chores even when I physically couldn’t, and barely fed me. They were both nasty in their own personal way. Uncle Vernon would whip me with his belt and Aunt Petunia would grab me by my hair, cutting it to shreds only for it to grow back the next day.”
Taking out his wand, He looked around and whispered to it, “Point me to Draco Malfoy.”
“Well just keep it to hand-holding and kissing,” Uncle Sirius said. Draco nodded and Uncle Remus gave his shoulders a squeeze before letting go. The blonde moved to Harry and held his hands.
“Enemies,” Harry laughed. “There are children.”
“Yes Alpha,” Harry moaned. “Please put it in.” His legs spread apart, and his hands spread his ass, revealing his wet and needy hole. “Please Alpha.”
Hermione had a weird expression on her face, “I uh… I don’t mind, you know, about you dating a boy, Harry, but maybe Ron’s right and… can you give me time to digest it? I mean, with Malfoy we all have a history with him.”
“I would like that,” Harry found himself blushing. His time was up, and he said goodbye to the two purebloods.
“Yes Harry, every last drop,” Voldemort said. “But do not worry for your lord and father… unlike you, I know how to stomach unpleasantness.”
He left the classroom and grinned at his brother, “I think he likes me,” he said.
“Oh… that’s nice,” Lavender said disinterestedly. Ron frowned and licked his lips. His hands started to feel sweaty again and he looked around. All of his food was done, and it looked like Lavender was halfway done with hers. He did not really think it was going well and wanted to go away. He kept glancing at Lavender, who kept glancing at him. She placed her sandwich down and leaned towards Ron.
His nostrils flared as Harry tried to control his breathing. Glaring at the Dark Lord, Harry resisted everything inside him that told him to kill the man. To take his wand and use the Killing Curse. It would be so easy; he is so close. Harry could not miss, he is faster, younger, he could even kill the snake. Voldemort saw the hesitation and gave a cruel laugh. “If I die here… what will my followers do?” he said, “It would be easy to pin the blame on you… those who are, as you said, too stupid to turn and run will instead hunt you Harry… but I feel you would like that, wouldn’t you? After all, you want to kill them. Every. Last. One.”
“Anyway, it’s not like we instantly like the brat or anything,” Uncle Sirius said. “We just agree that, for the time being, he’ll be tolerated in this household, like a personal demonic servant.”
“Uh hi guys, why the awkward questions?” Harry asked, shaking Theo’s offered hand.
“I’m sorry for your lost,” Voldemort said, vaguely remembering Sirius Black. He was Regulus’ brother from what he remembered.  “I lost my Omega too,” he said. “However my dear Adrian died sixteen years ago.”
After breakfast, Draco came over near lunch. He had a very satisfied look and he greeted Blaise with a kiss before doing the same with Harry. The five convened in the living room with Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus taking up one love seat while the lovers take up the other, larger one, Blaise in the center and Harry and Draco on either side. All four warlocks looked towards Blaise expectantly. “Well,” Draco said, “what did you find out?”
“No sexy man to take charge.”
Powerful freezing winds burst into the church. The doors were flung open and the windows shattered as hail and hard snow rushed in, beating and packing onto the monster. It snarled and tried to move however its body was quickly freezing. Ice formed on its pale skin, the body moved sluggishly before stopping completely, a full inch of ice covering the whole creature, it’s mouths all frozen open, the first head’s ice was stained red while the others were purely transparent.
He felt heavy, his stomach somehow gaining weight… no, not his stomach. Harry squeezed his eyes shut, darkness surrounded him with his heartbeat booming all around. Along with another sound. A soft sound lying under his frightened heart. Harry did his best to focus on the new soft sound. He never heard it before, yet it sounded familiar… comforting. His frantic heartrate calmed the more he listened to the sound, the soft angelic hum filling Harry with a new sense of determination. He was awash with it, drowning in this sound, feeling it’s warmth and determination.

she said again.
“What do you mean?” Cedric frowned. “I mean yeah he’s a git and such, but you’re amazing Harry! Give him time and maturity and I’m sure he will.” He pressed his knee against Harry’s in a supporting way and the two shared a secret smile. “There’s uhh one more thing I wanted to talk about with you, also,” Cedric said.
It sickened Draco and he wanted so much to hold Harry’s hand, to kiss and lick the pain away. But he held himself back. Harry did not tell him about the horrible things the woman had done and so he will wait and do nothing until Harry says otherwise. Though it hurt, it really hurt.
“Hey!” Harry jumped, up while Ron looked up miserably, too nervous to eat even a piece of toast for his first game. Draco just rolled his eyes and said, “He knows I’m joking.”
“And he wants to learn about being kinky George,” Fred said. The two stepped towards Cedric, their eyes full of lust and their smirks turned predatory. “I think we should teach him a lesson on Dominance, don’t you?”
“So that’s why you two are weird,” Ron muttered, earning him a glare from both Harry and Hermione.
The excitement turned into anxiety and worry as time went on. The students couldn’t dawdle anymore and were forced onto the train by their parents. Those who took off from their jobs began to mutter bitterly, sharing looks with one another and talking about how stupid they were to be duped by “that one guy” who made them believe that the Potter twins would show up instead of taking their own responsibility. Some were even getting angry at the twins themselves. How dare they get their hopes up! How dare they lie to them! Save their world and then disappear only to not come back when they’re supposed to! It was very rude of those kids, they all agreed. They were supposed to make articles on the boys, talk about how they were sorted into Gryffindor, their parent's house, and all the good they will do for the Wizarding World! But instead, they were gone!
“Which means, to use your eloquent language, during the full moon I rail Harry all night long,” Draco walked in, wearing only pajama bottoms. “In the bedroom, and with our link, I am the Dominant, and Harry is my sweet submissive.”
looked to be a heartless asshole who broke my brother’s heart. So yes, Weasley, I am
“Sirius!”
“He loved me,” Harry whispered. “He really loved me.”
The Alpha reached into his pocket and pulled out a picture. He gave it to Niall and Harry crowded him to look at it. Both boys gasped. There were the two men, and between them were a man and a woman who looked like them! The man was holding a one-year-old with auburn hair like Niall’s as the woman held a baby who had the same unruly black hair as Harry’s and green eyes. Everybody was smiling. “Is this?”
“Yes!” Draco said in an outburst. “Yes! I would love to help!” Harry smiled and hugged Draco, kissing his cheek. “Oh, I knew I can count on you Draco,” he cheered. “Though you do know that there will be rule breaking involved, right?”
“The same happened, more intentionally I assume, with the diary you have destroyed three years ago,” Dumbledore said, looking at Harry. “Once I have realized its nature, I had hoped that it would be the only one that he had created… It seems, however, that I have underestimated Lord Voldemort’s thirst for immortality. I am sorry to distract you, but Harry do you have any idea of how many he has created? Or which objects?”
The three walked out. Harry led them back to his room and turned, “Right uhh, have to make this it worked,” Harry said nervously. “Ron… tell me your deepest secret,” he commanded.
“Kinky,” was Harry’s automatic response. Zabini snickered and leaned back, looking more relaxed.
For those who just wanted sex.... sorry I just wasn't in the mood for sex scenes.
Relax
The pillow reached the three, and, with Mr. Riddle’s instructions, each took one. “Now, Draco, repeat after me,” Mr. Riddle said. “’With this ring, I thee wed.’”
“I haven’t figured if I wanted it or not,” Draco mused. “I need to see if you can be a good girl…”
“I don’t… I still love you Harry,” Draco said.
Voldemort chuckled. He hissed and looked around happily.
It was almost comical in Harry’s mind, at how mundane the scene was. The Dark Lord reading the newspaper as he drank coffee, and his son, Harry Potter, cooking him breakfast. He made eggs first, before frying up bacon and asking his father if it was okay to give Nagini some pieces of raw bacon. When he was done, a full breakfast spread was laid out on the table, and Harry served his father first before filling his plate himself and began eating. He noticed his father watching him, judging silently. Harry placed his fork down and took a sip of his coffee, frowning, “The food isn’t poisoned,” he said softly, “you know that I wouldn’t dare to poison you father. You’re my only family.”
“Um hello Harry,” Daphne said.
“Yes I am, I’ll have you know I’m twenty-years-old, thank you very much,” Draco huffed. He shook his head and said, “I’m Draco Malfoy.”
Harry and Niall stood uncomfortably. Harry grabbed Niall’s hand and tried to pull him away from the man. “I’m sorry,” he said in a soft voice, “but we really have to go.” The Great Hall started to rumble with noise.
“What about us, baby?” Draco asked. Harry shrugged, “Like how we don’t go on dates, even though I know we don’t really need to.”
“Agreed,” Uncle Sirius nodded, “So, I believe that for the ceremony, the Dark Lord will sit in the seat normally for you, Lucius, and during the reception, for we will need one after this ordeal, you may sit in the seat reserved for the father of the groom.” He placed two set pieces that had Mr. Malfoy’s name on two different spread sheets that showed the event room in Harry’s home, both showing different arrangements of seating and tables. He looked up at Blaise and said with a short frown, “I’m assuming that only your father will be invited? There will be no other demons or, hell forbid, your grandfather?”
“Malfoy’s been being sweet to me,” Harry whispered gently. “He somehow knew my favorite dessert is a chocolate parfait with a strawberry. He’s been giving one to me every night.”
“Not to mention you would be the perfect son-in-law,” Mr. Krum continued. “So honest and polite—and the only one who can keep our Viktor on the good path. Way better than any of these British Omegas.”
The clothes shop, incidentally enough, was right next to the third shop that Draco needed to visit. This clothes shop, Draco smiled as he looked at the tight fitting clothing that fitted properly.
“Yes, my lord,” Draco said, sounding shocked as the Dark Lord talked to him.
“He’s beautiful,” Harry said automatically. “Indescribably so. His skin is black as obsidian like yours… with eyes that burned with the passion of Hell… I haven’t really gotten a good look at him but I know that our Lord is extremely physically strong.”
The classroom slowly filled with students, Harry and Blaise both waved to Ron when he came in, and the three shared a look when Parkinson came in with her group, all of them glaring daggers at the three boys but saying nothing. Mr. Riddle ignored the three as he went about teaching the class, having Ron collect homework as he looked at all students but Harry, Blaise, and Draco. The two humans were too busy taking notes that they couldn’t glance at Blaise to see his reaction. However, halfway through, the class was interrupted.
His disgust turned into a wave of pure anger that led his fist, slamming into McLaggen’s face as hard as he could punch. The Alpha staggered, staring at Harry, “What the fuck!?”
“So?”
“Harry,” Harry whispered, “Just Harry.”
“We weren’t,” Harry said.
The blonde only glanced up, “It is nice to see you too Potter, ask again.”
“I want you to just tell the others in our year to meet up in the common room after dinner,” Harry said. “There are some things I need to tell you all—things that Hermione and Ron know.”
Harry’s face turned red and the two Slytherins leaned forward, silently demanding an answer. “The submissive marriage clause…” he answered. “I just… I like that idea very much.”
As Harry said, he wrote a letter to Viktor, a long letter explaining almost everything that the man missed because of Dumbledore. He had Draco hanging over his shoulder the entire time, and though at first, he found the Alpha’s jealousy cute, but it quickly became irritable as Draco started to comment. “Why are you telling him that? Krum doesn’t need to know about that!” “Harry, my pet, please don’t tell him about our time in my manor!” “You misspelled odious.”
“Dude you need to watch him he’s like a wizard with the bottles!” Ron said, showing off his drink with pride. “It was like amazing to watch!”
“What do you want, demon?” Draco asked, “you’re ruining a sincere moment before my father’s idea of proper punishment.”
“Like how you’re going to die fighting the Dark Lord,” Pansy Parkinson sneered. “Then all alone, Draco will have no choice but to run back to me like he’s supposed to! We have a contract!”
Harry said. He turned back to the garden with promises of seeing Nagini later that night. The snake slithered out of sight, and Harry’s heart fell a little as he realized he was alone once more. His mind on the sad tale Nagini told him, he went back to work on the garden.
Harry was starting to get irritated. He forced himself to take a breath and looked at the beautiful demon. “Do you know why your father marked me?” he asked simply.
“It is barely the afternoon,” Voldemort hummed, “and my son is in desperate need of clothing. I think I will go out with him, and your son too if required.”
Nagini stared at Harry for a moment. She pressed her head against Harry’s cheek in an almost soothing motherly way.
The Howler ripped itself up and Harry stared at the pieces blankly before slowly looking up towards his uncle. It was almost comical, the shade of reddish-purple his uncle’s face turned. His face looked as though it was ballooning as he just stared at Harry, glaring at him. “What is this all about, you freak? What did you do now?”
“Terrible, you can say it,” Harry said. “I know because of Lupin we don’t want to think about it but… it’s terrible.”
“Yeah, it is,” Blaise nodded. “This is Loki, the old trickster god. He’ll help us trick and trap my father during the wedding.”
“Don’t say his name!” Harry yelled and Niall flinched. Harry blinked and whimpered. “I’m sorry,” he said in a softer voice. “I just, I don’t know. He was our friend but…”
“You’re done,” The Dark Lord appeared behind Harry. The boy jumped and turned around. Voldemort moved passed Harry and examined the potion. “Adequate, but not good enough,” he muttered. “Shame, I was told you were worse at Potions… or is it because you are following orders?” The Dark Lord smirked at the thought. He opened his robe and pulled out a thin bottle filled with a dark-green liquid.
Breakfast went on in a normal fashion afterward, no talk of Dumbledore or Voldemort was brought up and before Harry knew it, almost an hour passed, and Professor McGonagall was near them with their schedules. It took longer than usual this year for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O.W.L. grades to continue with their chosen N.E.W.T.s.
“What is this?” Harry asked.
“Are getting cleaned, they’ll be with you in one second,” the healer said in a gentle tone. Lily just glared at her exhaustedly, but her glare lightened up the moment she saw a midwife walking towards her holding two swaddles. “Here you are Mrs. Potter, two very healthy boys.” Everyone helped Lily get into a position to hold her children. She and James smiled down at their babies.
“Arthur, the Blacks are here with Harry for some business,” Mrs. Weasley said. “We’ll be in the back room if you need me. There should still be tea in the kettle and if not, well, try not to break it like last time.” She turned to Harry and smiled, “Come along dear.”
“I do treat my boy with respect,” Blaise said, “we’re just joking around, right Theo?”
“Then we’ll get a stronger version—”
Harry laughed, “Our first date,” he snickered, “and what did we do before then?”
on the front. Niall looked at the letter confused and looked up at Harry on the other side of the Great Hall. His twin opened the letter immediately. Deciding to trust Harry, Niall opened his to see official-looking handwriting.
“Okay,” Harry breathed softly.
“Neville, aren’t you hungry?” Niall asked.
“This is quite unorthodox, I was not informed that I would be needed to testify,” Professor McGonagall said, “however yes it is true. Mr. Riddle visited Hogwarts several times in preparation for this trial, and each time he interviewed one of the staff, I accompanied him. One of the staff members he talked with has been our own groundskeeper and keeper of the keys, Rubeus Hagrid.” She sat back down as the crowd exploded in yells and comments.
Niall found the Vanishing Spell manageably difficult. He was still the first one to get the hang of it, vanishing his snail completely almost three-quarters through their double period. Hermione Granger looked both impressed and annoyed, getting the spell down almost five minutes later. Niall glanced towards the Gryffindor’s table and winced to see that the most Harry was able to do was making his snail’s shell look extremely transparent.
Harry frowned. He looked down at his stomach and placed his free hand on it. “You mean to say… that I can easily get pregnant?”
“As I said, Mr. Potter, I feel for you, truly, however, I do not see how my family fits into it,” Mr. Malfoy said.
Harry did not care or wait for the Slytherins reactions. Instead he tugged on Draco’s robes, and the two left the dungeons.
“Narcissa will be more than happy to deal with that,” Mr. Malfoy said.
“I will not take those potions for the last time Remus!” Uncle Sirius yelled. “We agreed on this, agreed. You would use the potions, you would carry our child! We agreed to this!”
“Yeah,” Harry nodded, “and because of that, he cannot die.” He frowned. “And neither can I, not really anyway. He just wants to use me, I think, to keep his soul safe. Because if it’s destroyed, then he can die.”
“Don’t worry Hermione, since when have I ever done anything rash?” Harry asked, giving a joking smile. Hermione gave him a look that caused him to laugh, “I promise I won’t do anything,” he said. Hermione relaxed and the three went on to lunch.
“Can I wear this now, Sir?” he asked.
For a full hour, the Unspeakable screamed under Harry’s torture. It wasn’t until that his throat went dry, and he started hacking and coughing, that the Dark Lord placed a hand on Harry’s shoulder. “That is enough Harry,” he said gently. “You have fulfilled your role perfectly.”
“You’re awake!” Draco said. “Harry, what was that?”
“But Dumbledore!” Niall protested.
“I am saying that it is both irresponsible and highly abusive to put the state of our existence all on a teenage boy who is barely old enough to use magic outside of Hogwarts,” Mr. Riddle said. “The fact that this prophecy exists is also to be highly contested, due to the circumstances surrounding it and it’s creation. I have gone through these reasons in the documents that I have submitted.”
Draco chuckled and lightly stroke his thumb over Harry’s scared hand. “I understand,” he said, sounding extremely pleased. Harry finished his account and gave it to Draco. The Alpha read it over and nodded. He pulled Harry up and carefully pocketed it. “What do you need for your little potion?” he asked.
“But you’re a guy,” Ron said.
Harry turned to see the door opening, Ginny standing in its place. She looked angry, glaring at all three of them.
“I will handle it well,” he said. “And when I cast the Killing Curse, I will make sure not to miss.”
“Oh, you’re all here,” Mrs. Lestrange said with a huge air of disappointment. She was done writing on the chalkboard. It was in a strange language that Harry had never seen before, the symbols sprawling out in a large spiral over and over again, each one looking more sinister and frantic than the last. It looked like the writings of a mad woman. “Right then—idiot boy come here,” she said, jumping off of the desk.
“Then who are you then?”
“And it is because of me that the demon did not kill everyone,” Harry countered. “Or would you rather I sit by and allow it to eat everyone, just as it did with Ms. Warrington?”
leather Harry,” he flirted.
When the time was up, Harry snapped out of his trance and looked up from his potion. Through the fumes and heat he was sweating, yet his hair somehow didn’t look out of place at all, and his skin looked like it had a healthy glow instead of being drenched which he saw that some of the Gryffindors, as well as Crabbe and Goyle, looked. He then looked at his own table. They all made the potion, however, and not to brag, it was clear to Harry that his was the best of the four with Malfoy’s begrudgingly being a close second.
“What?”
Draco thought for a moment, “I sang,” he said, “There were some amateur competitions that I entered and won, but uh mostly I just hanged out with Daphne.”
“Was this another thing the muggles did?” Voldemort asked.
“Thank you,” Draco said In a small voice.
“Go,” Ginny said a little too sharply for either’s liking. She realized it and said in a softer voice, “I’ll tell Ron and Hermione. If you can’t get in the same carriage, we’ll see you at the feast.”
Harry smiled, “Blaise baby,” he said sweetly. He moved towards him and wrapped his arms suggestively around the demon, “listen to your mages please? You’ll be very amused.”
The omega jumped and nodded, immediately running to show off the store’s collection of dress robes. Voldemort selected several colors and styles, some shorter and longer than each other in shades of greens, blues, and blacks. He did not talk while doing so, his manner business-like as he listened to Harry and Draco talk with each other, sometimes bickering over colors.
Hermione shrugged at that and said, “Well, have fun with it, Ron. Why are you looking so worried about it?”
Draco’s cheeks blushed, “I have some but uhh, just don’t judge me with where they’re from.”
“If I wanted you to know, I would have said it in English,” Niall shrugged. “But don’t worry Nev, it’s nothing bad,” he added, winking at Neville.
Harry took his and scurried away back down to the Slytherin dungeons where he found Draco lounging lazily by the fire. “Draco!” He said quickly, running towards him.
“I’m not gay,” Draco drawled.
The two left the Burrow, and Dumbledore led Harry through the garden until they passed the wooden gate and beyond the Burrow’s property line. “Take my hand, but be careful,” Dumbledore said, holding out his hand. Harry looked as he reached for it, and noticed that it looked different. It looked as though it had died. “Do not worry about that Harry,” Dumbledore said, moving his sleeve to cover it. Harry grabbed Dumbledore’ wrist, holding on as tightly as he could.
Harry thought to himself as he took off the black robes, replacing them with his Hogwarts one before leaving, walking the manor until he was back in Draco’s room where he closed all lights and curtains, and waited in the darkest corner until the red eyes appeared.
“Good,” Harry said, “You don’t need that extra stress.”
“Well I can’t, the place makes me feel weak,” Harry said, still looking at the monster before him with a hard glare. Voldemort raised the skin above his eye as though raising an eyebrow, even though he had none. “Uncle Vernon just beats me and beats me. Happy? Now, will you kill me or not?”
“Ron! Harry,” Hermione said, “There you two are, I’ve been looking everywhere for you, where have you been?”
Harry nodded, however he had a frown, “But I hate Professor Snape… he makes us call him Professor and he always picks on me.”
“And you will be home for Christmas,” Remus added.
“Albus Dumbledore,” Voldemort nodded. “I’ve heard interesting things about that man. Though I do not like how he is handling Harry Potter.” Remus flinched at the name. Voldemort smirked. “I mean, the poor boy is being dragged through the mud and instead of shielding him, the headmaster is doing nothing.”
“Okay, yeah I think I can do that,” Draco nodded. “What is his favorite dessert?”
Sirius was going mad. He ran around house several times, yelling at the portraits who yelled back at him, looking in every small hiding hole and room he could think of but there was no sign of Harry. With each room he looked in, the more desperate and frantic he became. “KREACHER!” he yelled, looking in the first floor drawing room for the third time. “KREACHER! Get over here you useless elf!”
“What do you mean Uncle Sirius?” Harry smiled. “I’m still your innocent little Harry, it’s just now, I have a very nice boyfriend.” He giggled to himself and pranced to his uncle’s side, placing a kiss on Uncle Sirius’s cheek. “Goodnight Uncle Sirius,” he smiled and walked blissfully out of the kitchen.
“Either way, I would like for you to visit Madam Pomfrey after this for a physical, just to make sure that everything is healing smoothly,” Professor McGonagall said, and the boys nodded. “Good, now then Mr. Riddle, the second biggest accusation, at least in the newspapers, is your kidnapping, that is not to mention all the rumors milling around the students blaming your… for lack of a better word, adventures, on Professor Dumbledore.”
Blaise left the next day on a search to figure out how to contact his grandfather. He promised that he would be back as soon as he could and disappeared in a puff of black smoke, leaving Harry and Draco alone to fend for themselves in the Academy. As well as prepare for Samhain and the Dance of the Night.
Harry huffed and sat down, crossing his arms. “Is it so weird that I have a backbone?” he demanded.
“What?”
The Weasleys went up to Harry and Draco and smiled, “Want to grab a bite to eat?” Ron asked them.
Harry nodded, “Everyone’s out,” he yelled out. The room was indeed empty except for the four of them, and the monster. Mr. Riddle was still at the podium where he always stood, frozen in fear and shock. “Good—Draco! Come here!” Blaise yelled.
“I thought you said you didn’t know about that,” Ron said accusingly.
The three slowed as they heard more laughing, she was with another girl, and Harry couldn’t recognize the other voice. They turned the corner and Draco peaked around, “Oh great she’s kissing, cover Weasley’s eyes.”
The Turning
Draco hesitated for a moment, “My aunt is one of them,” he said. “Bellatrix Lestrange.”
He rushed back to the Gryffindor common room where Harry and Hermione were. “That was fast, how did it go?” Hermione asked as Ron sat with them.
“It’s Oblivion,” Draco answered, sounding a little embarrassed. “It’s uh… from
Amends
“I’m shopping,” Draco said. “I’m allowed to shop here, am I not, Yaxley?”
“Give this to my husband when I leave,” he commanded the shadows, holding the letter out. The shadows came to him, darkening the room to do so, and he felt a warm hand brush against his. Smiling, Harry stood and stretched, it was time to prepare for detention.
“They probably consider it all Dark Magic now,” Draco said, “but I thought that you might find that interesting.”
With a shudder, Harry watched her leave before saying, “I do not like that woman at all.”
“Oh no, we are not done here Sirius Black, you will come back here this instance!”
“I did not hear Nott’s name… shame really, since you have been explicit with Greengrass and Parkinson,” Voldemort continued. A cold sneer grew across his face. “Come here boy,” he said, holding out his hand to Harry. Harry moved towards him, more out of fear than obedience. His legs moved while his mind was telling him to stop. Voldemort just held his hand out patiently as Harry took painful step after painful step until he was close enough for his father to snatch his wrist and pull him the rest of the way. Uncaring, Voldemort grabbed Harry’s sleeve and pushed it up, revealing his Mark on his inner forearm, fully formed.
“Look, we have our food let’s just eat, okay?” Ron grumbled. “Neville, you want bacon?”
“I’m just saying, it’s obvious you like him, well to me at least I don’t know about the others,” Draco shrugged. His phone buzzed and he glanced at it, smiling. “Harry’s here. If you’re going to stay in for the night, just try not to mess my stuff up? I still have my textbooks open for Professor Snape’s essay and I would rather not try to find those pages again.”
“Hmm I see…” Loki smirked. He walked towards Harry, “what a lovely woman—”
“Remus, puppy, please—”
Nagini insisted.
A feeling that was confirmed not even a week into the semester. Their dormmates avoided them, the two boys who share the room with them pushing their beds as far from Harry and Niall’s as possible, and even trying to jinx them when they weren’t looking. One day, they jinxed Harry’s nest to smell like garbage and attract bugs. After crying about it to Niall and Viktor, Harry was able to get his revenge by filling the two boys’ pillows with spiders that nipped at them all night leaving small bumps everywhere, and that was the end of any hope of friendship that Harry and Niall might have with their dormmates.
“Umm…” Harry looked up at his Uncles apprehensively. The two nodded, Uncle Sirius saying, “Lead him to the kitchen Harry… He’ll stay the night and we will discuss this in the morning.”
“Yes, sir,” Harry nodded.
“I didn’t—”
(See the end of the chapter for
The audience gasped as the reporters began writing furiously. Sirius ignored them as he went on, “He did not eat and barely slept! He spent his entire days in his nest holding everything that had Viktor’s scent.”
“We just had to threaten him but yes,” Harry said, sticking out his tongue. “So, what should we do now?”
“Because if we can, Ron, than we can figure out a way to turn that into a potion,” Harry said simply.
His entire life was packed in two suitcases. It was easy to travel, yeah, however, Draco couldn’t think that it was sad that he had so little he wanted to hold onto and bring with him. There were his clothes, obviously, however, there was also an old album filled with pictures of his Nonna and Nonno, his Grandmother and Grandfather, who did more in raising him than his actual parents, as well as pictures of Draco when he was happy when he was younger and innocent. Pictures of Draco with his friends, or at least people he thought were his friends until Theo happened, but more importantly pictures of Draco with Daphne! His best friend, and now only friend here. He wanted to text her and tell her that he was here, but his coffee-fumes-addled mind just called for a bed, a proper bed. So, making sure he had everything: his suitcases, phone, and wallet, Draco Malfoy stepped towards the campus of Hogwarts University.
“Did you know then, Potter, that the suppressants we use are based on the Dark Arts?” Professor Cornett asked. “A group of Omegas developed them—for their own safety—and the act was declared Dark by Alphas around them. And now they are all commonplace! But you will learn more about that, and other useful spells from Professor Barbanov. Before the feast, you all will be tested to be determined which of the four Semey, the Four Families, you will be sorted into. There are Volkovio, Korolvskiy, Knigav, and Skunchnyy. Which house you will belong to will be based on the results of these trials. You have ten minutes to prepare yourselves.”
“That’s your familiar? It’s so cute,” Ron said. “Way better than mine!”
“The old gods… huh,” Mr. Riddle said, “the other covens will have to hear about what is going on. Especially Greendale’s. The High Priest there is even more stubborn than me if you are to be believed…”
Harry’s face turned red and he said angrily, “Well since we’re all taking about how Draco fucks me—why don’t you all just blurt out your sex positions? Huh?”
“Of course baby,” Niall chuckled. He patted Neville’s stomach and moved a little away to give Neville some room. “But actually, do you mind if I stay? I need some help with Herbology.”
“Yes, but your mother’s protection may no longer be on you,” Dumbledore said. “The protection here is good and will repel Voldemort and his followers, but we need to think about the future, and where you will go after this school year.”
“Hermione’s in Political Science,” Ron said, scrunching his nose a bit. “You won’t believe the things she has to read! Let alone write about!” He took a bite of his eggs for emphasis and nodded. “Anyway this is no way to diss either of them, like I said, they’re brilliantly smart.”
“That’s great,” he said honestly. “I’m really happy for you two.”
Mr. Malfoy led Voldemort through the middle of the chaos, his eyes set directly towards an office in the back labeled “Barnabas Cuffe Editor-in-chief.” Mr. Malfoy knocked once before opening it.
“I know, I had to keep myself busy in order to keep from growing mad,” Draco said. “I was studying my blood, trying to see exactly what that disgusting mutt did to me.”
Hogwarts was only a few days away, and they passed the same. Ron kept finding him and rubbed his back, helping him through this strange illness.  It wasn’t until the day before they leave that Ron stopped Harry. “Don’t eat that,” he snapped.
“A family home in France,” Draco said. “This is where I want us to spend the night, away from everything.” He kissed Harry roughly and guided him to bed. They kicked their shoes off as they kissed, holding onto one another until both were comfortable, cuddling by the pillows. “Did you mean it?” Draco asked hesitantly.
“No, no, it’s all good, all good,” Mr. Weasley said.
“You don’t like it?” Blaise asked. “I’ll stop it if—”
The teenager smiled up as he talked loudly, “I met the love of my life Uncle Remus! And his name is Draco Malfoy!”
“You cheeky brat!” Mrs. Lestrange said, she raised her hand quickly, as if to hit Harry, but stopped when Mr. Riddle’s voice called out, “Mrs. Lestrange.”
“I’ve seen him last night too,” Mrs. Weasley nodded. “He helped me with the dishes then said goodnight. He looked rather worried or nervous.”
“Then that makes her completely far from harmless, now does it?” Voldemort chuckled.
“He saw me hex Zacharias Smith. He kept going on and on about what happened at the Ministry and in the end I got annoyed and hexed him—Slughorn came in and I thought I was in trouble until he asked me for lunch,” Ginny said.
“Or actually befriending the house-elves,” Daphne said, “Which reminds me, how did you three were able to do that? Draco came to the common room one day just complaining for a straight hour about it! Along with Harry whipping him of course.”
“Yeah, I am,” Harry nodded.
“Oh? That’s nice,” Daphne hummed. She gave Draco a small smile and said, “I’m happy you’re still singing.”
Harry frowned as he took a step unconsciously closer to Ron. It felt cold, having the entire House against him. He could hear their whispers, feel their stares crawling off the skin of his back. He moved quickly through the common room with Ron and made a straight line for the Great Hall. All he wanted was to eat, get his schedule, and go to class. He did not want to deal with anyone.
A few feathers and droppings vanished. She gave a small shrug and said, “I never got a hang of those householdy kinds of spells. Well, got anything? Trunk? Cauldron? Broom—Woah! Is that a Firebolt?”
Harry looked up at him sorrowfully, his cheeks red and wet. “Why aren’t you in school—what happened?”
“You’re sweet,” Daphne smiled. Ron smiled at that and took a huge bite of sausage, almost stuffing it whole before realizing what he did. “Sorry!” he said with his mouth full.
“I do not smell like him,” he muttered in English.
,” Voldemort said, emphasizing the last word. “I need half a liter.”
“Heretic!”
“Only for my little Omega,” Niall smirked. “He’s kinky, I’m sure of it.”
Some Academies like to boast of how their schools were shaped of a perfect pentagram, how each room was a pentagram, and each connected perfectly together. The builders of this Academy liked simplicity over other things, as well as the thought of originality, hence the name of “The Academy” as in this particular school is the Original One. The inside, of course, had a statue honoring the Fallen Angel in the middle of the main room. He was depicted rather monstrously, nothing like the blur of beauty that Harry saw. Made of marble, it depicted a creature with a human’s body and goat hooves and head. The man wore nothing but a loincloth, his hand raised. Harry stared at the statue and felt odd.
“An important manner that is between Dumbledore and I, Professor,” Harry said quickly, “and why aren’t you downstairs eating breakfast either?”
Both Hermione and Harry sighed. “Did anything good go on during the date?” Hermione asked.
“Get out Parkinson,” Zabini barked, “I want to hear what Potter has to say.”
The Dark Lord stood transfixed for a moment before smiling. It was a wide smile that did not match with his face. He knew that he should have been angry, however instead of anger or rage, pride swam and filled his body. He stepped towards Harry and watched as he cried. “Damn it, damn it, why couldn’t I do it? I’m pathetic! Weak!”
“Why? Is it because Slytherin has the highest amount of recorded Dark Wizards?” Harry asked innocently. “If that is the reason, Professor Dumbledore, then I have to say that I am disappointed.”
Nagini led Harry down the hill and towards the front gates of the impressive mansion. The gates opened for them and they made their way down the impressive pathway towards two grand front doors. Harry’s eyes moved from topiary to topiary, marveling at the lifelike dragons and snakes.
“Oh please Draco! There would be no room for the both of us,” Harry said, rolling his eyes. “I brought my bike.”
“He always finds a way,” Niall said, “Not that he’s the only accomplished Potter twin! I’m a pretty good flier, and I am the top of our class in Dark Arts—and defense if we had a competent teacher—as well as Transfiguration.”
He kept going back to his arm. Kept scrubbing and staring at the blackness that won’t fade, no matter how hard he rubbed and how red the surrounding skin became.
“Can you even use that spell?” Draco asked. “As in, can you even kill with it?”
“You look fine,” Ron shrugged. “Why are you dressing up if this isn’t a date?”
“Detention, Mr. Potter!” Umbridge said. “Now, let me make this absolutely clear: There is no one who is going to attack you so there is no reason to practice using spells.”
“And that shield will last as long as you keep your arms and hand steady,” Blaise said. “It isn’t the best shield you can conjure, but it is the easiest. Harry, Draco, why don’t you try it out?”
“Believe me, I know how much of a top he is,” Harry muttered. He looked between the two of them and blushed, “Draco and I had an interesting summer. I don’t want to tell you guys more so, however, until Draco is here.”
“I gave a speech, a very hurtful, hateful speech towards his followers,” Harry said. “Draco and I fled to France for some time, and we came up with a plan. We were returning when Voldemort caught us. He forced our plan out of us, as well as the list of Death Eaters. He decided to show mercy.” A disgusting sneer appeared on Harry’s face, any weakness left him as a fit of venomous anger filled him. “He summoned Theo’s dad, Theo’s a friend of Draco and me. He came, obviously, they always come to that monster’s summon. He had… he ordered me to kill Theo’s dad. I refused. So he… he used the Imperius Curse on me. I tried to fight it, but he was too powerful. I can still feel him inside me, crawling on my skin … I can hear his whispers in my head. Telling me to relax, to obey and to kill. I… I watched my hand bring my wand out and point it at Mr. Nott. I killed him…I killed my friend’s dad. And I felt happy during it like I didn’t have a care in the world. And then he released me and sickness flooded back in…”
“Your muggle blood will be conquered, taken over by my own,” Voldemort said. “The Dursleys, you will no longer worry about, for you will be mine, Harry, just as you were your father’s.” Harry nodded, exhausted and full. “Go now, back to Gryffindor Tower,” Voldemort commanded, “rest my son, and you will wake up to a new life.”
“Oh, okay,” Harry said, getting to his feet. He looked at Draco. “Um, we’ll talk when we get back?”
“Okay Greengrass—”
“Of course,” Lord Voldemort said, and the two adults walked away, leaving Harry by his lonesome, staring at the knotted tree, his thoughts turned downward.
Draco took the moment to run away towards Harry and Blaise. “That wasn’t good,” Harry said, looking at the heads, “they’re still moving!”
He nodded softly and in a soft voice whispered, “I would like that…”
Both Draco and Blaise looked at each other and shared a large, lewd grin as Draco’s cock throbbed and Blaise’s pulsed. Blaise winked at Draco and gave his ass a hard slap before stepping away. “I truly have the sexiest mages in the worlds,” he sighed happily. “Mine to play… and corrupt,” he purred. “I’m sure you both like listening to my orders by now, do you?” he chuckled. They both gave a nod. “Good. Then kneel before me and make out. I want to see my mages play a little before I join.”
He appeared in the Leaky Cauldron, and as he stepped out, a strong smell hit him. It was pleasant, strong, and oaky. It was a hot smell that somehow heated his body, causing him to flush as he felt his head going lightheaded, the scent seemingly invading the deepest parts of his brain. He needed to follow it. He needed to see where this scent was coming from. Harry looked around and only found that the only person in the tavern was Tom the Barkeep. The smell was definitely not coming from him. Instead, it seemed to be coming from upstairs. Harry allowed his instinct to lead him, following the alluring smell away from the fireplace and towards the staircase. He barely climbed five steps before he saw the source of the smell.
“The submissive clause can be used with Half-bloods… however there is a way… for me to become pureblood,” Harry blushed. “I don’t know why but… thinking about it, it makes me feel weird. I’m disgusted by it and also drawn to it, like I am with the submissive clause. I just want to know what your thoughts are on it.”
Voldemort nodded and sighed, “I never meant to fool you, my love. I am just truly scared for my son’s well-being.”
“Oi!” Ron yelled, “Not in front of me please!”
Ten minutes. There is no sign of the Potters.
he thought to himself. He turned to look at the goat and gave a small gasp. For the entire ceremony he thought that the goat was alive and well, but now he could see a deep slit in the goat’s neck, dark smoke coming from the deadly wound as it’s beady black eyes watched Harry with an advert attention. Harry stared at the goat and swore that it smirked at him with a knowing look. He looked back at the tree and pressed his hand against it.
“In that case, I would suggest you read somewhere else,” Mrs. Lestrange said. “Nobody likes a student who reads in the library so much.”
Uncle Remus was a handsome man with sandy blonde hair and moustache. His nose was longish, and there was always bags under his eyes, but he was relatively handsome, especially when standing next to his husband, Sirius Black. Sirius had long shaggy black hair, a devilish face, and a mischievous twinkle in his eyes. Both men were lean though showed some stock of muscles and were wearing pajamas.
“I know,” Harry whimpered. “I’ve—I’ve written to Sirius and Remus about it.”
“Okay, good,” Ron said, looking relieved. He went to his own bed. Draco huffed and pulled Harry in, closing the bed curtains. “Finally,” Draco said.
“I get you,” Ron nodded. “So, uh back to the singing,” he grinned.
“What do you mean?” Harry repeated, “The book said I needed to marry—”
“Alpha,” Harry whined.
“Y-You have?” Harry asked.
“Harry! How was your heat?” she asked, “Are you okay? Did you eat during it?”
“Sure,” Draco nodded.
Harry looked down and frowned, he was wearing muggle-like clothes that he and Draco have picked out in Twilfitt. They fitted him perfectly, especially around his butt. Harry blushed and took a step back, “I had a bit of a shopping trip last week,” he said.
Hmm a question from me to you: If I give Daddy Voldemort a beau, who would they be?
“Who were you talking to in here boy? Hmm? Think it’s funny scaring Dudley talking to ghosts, eh?” Uncle Vernon asked. In her cage Hedwig hooted angrily. “That ruddy owl!” Uncle Vernon screamed back at her.
The twins found an empty room and took it for themselves. The two enjoyed a peaceful sail, and even heard that they were underwater! The journey took all day, and Harry was happy that they packed food for it as he and Niall leaned against each other and ate pre-made sandwiches and snacks. At one point, Harry brought out his giant dragon plushie and Niall snickered. “You actually brought that?”
Voldemort stepped forward and hugged Remus from behind, kissing his neck. “Were you a good puppy while I was gone?” Voldemort chuckled.
Draco stared at the mark before shaking his head, “I’ll be fine,” he said. “My father will slap me a couple times before grounding me. …I’m used to it.”
“—and Bill’s been giving her a lot of private lessons,” Fred sniggered.
Draco nodded. “Yeah… I will be. He doesn’t… he’s not the kind to…”
“Was the first marrying Uncle Remus?” Harry asked.
Harry looked up and said, “All the way, I’m willing to do anything.”
Nagini said.
“Are you alright Sirius?” Lupin asked.
“Ron’s supposed to be here in half an hour, but I think you’ll be busy cooking dinner for a while,” Blaise hummed, “I honestly was expecting you to just make pasta and red sauce maybe some meatballs.”
“Will both of you just shut up?” Harry groaned, annoyed. “I don’t need either of you looking after me! Draco and I are in a courtship, big deal. There is nothing sinister or backstabbing going on here.”
The three were left speechless. Voldemort was amused by this and led Harry to the table. He made Harry sit next to Draco as he took the place at the head of the table. Food arrived in silence, and Voldemort waited for the Malfoys to snap out of their stupor. Mrs. Malfoy was the first, looking at Harry. “How is this possible?” she asked.
Harry looked up to meet Voldemort’s eyes. Though he had a stern, disapproving face, Harry couldn’t help but smile at the pride that was in his eyes. Voldemort turned to the Malfoys, his hand moving to Harry’s shoulder. “The Light has stolen my son. Yes, our thorn in our side, Harry Potter, is, in reality, my son: Harrison Salazar Riddle.”
“Oh just fuck off,” Harry scoffed. “I’m not dealing with this tonight.” He took his pajamas and changed, closing his bed curtains, and sticking them close with a spell. Feeling angry and betrayed by everyone, he just laid there for hours on end. He heard the others go to bed one by one, but still couldn’t sleep. There was a strange noise and looked down to see a mass moving in his bed towards him. It hissed and licked his body and a moment later, Nagini appeared from under the covers.
When he was done, Harry returned to his room where he was forced to stay the rest of the night. Hopefully, if he was lucky, Dudley won’t come in to bully him. So instead Harry was left with nothing much to do but to talk with Hedwig or reread the dreadful copy of the
a voice said in Harry’s head.
Blood spurted from Greyback’s face and chest as though he has been slashed with an invisible sword. He staggered backwards and collapsed onto the floor, his wand falling from his limp right hand. Greyback’s face was scarlet stained as blood drained form his body. Harry and Draco stared at each other for a moment, before pocketing their wands. “What was that?” Draco asked.
“Shut it,” Harry said miserably as he drank his water. “Can you stay? Please?”
“Well… Loki might need help, you know, finding the old gods,” Harry said, looking up at his husband. “And I always wanted to meet the God of Love.”
“What did you do to me?” Draco asked, his voice now higher and scared.
“He’s fine… it’s just he is angry at me,” Draco said cautiously. “I know that you and he don’t have the best opinion of me, but I need your help Potter, and it is very awkward and hard for me to ask. I messed up in every attempt I’ve made in trying to get close to Harry which should be impossible, I’m irresistible but—”
“So you’re saying that you’re very good at handling large amounts of meat?” Harry asked, sticking out his tongue with a snicker.
The black goat Uncle Remus mentioned was tied near the knotted tree, was a stone alter had been placed with a very large, and very old book has been situated on top of it. Two torches on either side of the chairs gave the only light, along with the moon which hung full over the crowd of witches and warlocks in the night sky. Next to the alter stood Mr. Riddle with his wife, a petite thing with short blonde hair whose name Harry always forget. Mr. Riddle was dressed in his High Priest outfit, which consisted of a deep black robe that draped over his shoulders and angry looking fire that burned around the hem. On the inside of the robe was gold that glinted and glittered in the firelight.
“And if not?” Niall asked.
“Wait,” Harry frowned, “my dad had a demon bound to him?”
“Thanks Neville,” Harry said earnestly, “honestly.”
Draco scoffed and looked around the living room they were in as Harry went to the kitchen. “What even is this place?” Draco complained, “a glorified pen?”
Mrs. Lestrange looked bitter. She glared at the three teenagers before a sadistic smirk slowly appeared, “Well then… I better get back to my classroom then,” she said sardonically, “Have fun studying boys, I will see you in class. And Potter, make sure to do your best for Samhain, you’ll never know when a demon will come up and make you fertile…” Harry could have sworn her eyes shifted towards Blaise for a moment before leaving.
“Done,” Draco said.
“But what about Remus?” Harry asked, “will you ever tell him?”
“Damn Harry…” Draco breathed when Harry swallowed the last of his cum. “That was brilliant… take out your own dick.”
“No, no, no, his
Ginny looked up and saw Harry. She immediately dropped the carrot she just pulled out and turned to run away. “Ginny wait—”
“Yeah, but we’ll get through,” Draco said comfortingly. “In the meantime, we’ll just keep doing what we’re doing.”
He couldn’t tell why he felt scared. Everything was just as normal as it always was. October was beginning, and the last full moon was a few days behind them. His schedule was busy, yes, Sixth Years are expected to be studying almost every hour for their N.E.W.T.s at the end of their seventh year, and every spell is expected to be performed nonverbal now which Harry had great difficulty with. On top of that, there was Harry’s Quidditch practices. Since he was the team captain now, he had to hold trials and make sure everything was perfect. Even with his team made, he did not feel like he could relax. Ron was his Keeper, and though he knew that his friend was good at it, the redhead had terrible nerves, and that in turn became another thing for Harry to worry about.
“O-Oh,” Hermione said, totally stunned and looking defeated. Ron, meanwhile, sat up a little taller and his cheeks blushed. Niall saw this and scoffed, “Not you Ron,” he said.
There was a knock, but Harry kept scrubbing. The door creaked open and Sirius started to come in. “Harry, I have a drink that will help your throat,” he said gently. He stopped and stared. Harry kept scrubbing at his Dark Mark, tears still flowing openly. “Harry!”
he thought to himself as he watched the two drink and eat. Harry kept his focus on Sirius, talking with him as he kept his mind far from Voldemort and the potion. When dinner was over, Harry looked at Ron and Hermione, they looked normal, as though they’ve just drank regular pumpkin juice. “Ron, Hermione, can you come with me for a sec?” he asked.
“They are supposed to be with their family,” Dumbledore said sternly. “Their aunt and uncle. Surely you’ll see how selfish you two are acting.”
“Why would you want to isolate the thing that makes you get pregnant?” Ron asked.
“Because they were caught,” Harry said. “Wouldn’t the most useful allies be the ones who don’t get caught?”
“Yes,” Dumbledore said. “I think I might have told you before, but lately I’ve been having trouble keeping staff. It seems, for one reason or another, they all must leave for a different reason,” Dumbledore spoke as though it was an amusing topic. “I am hoping to bring you along to help convince an old friend of mine to come out of retirement.”
He sat on the bed and patted his lap, “Come here.”
And with that, the Dark Lord moved passed Harry, not even giving the boy a glance back. Alone in the basement, Harry walked around for a couple minutes before an idea came to him. He was going to find Draco.
Viktor watched sadly as he felt his father’s hand on his shoulder. “You missed your chance, son,” he said. Viktor sighed and ruffled in his pocket for a moment, pulling out a small black box.
Draco kissed Harry and smiled, “You should be, my love. Your husband is very skilled with his tongue.” Harry raised an eyebrow at that, “Then I really should get to know this skill, Malfoy,” he said.
scared,” Uncle Remus scoffed, “are you fucking kidding me? I wanted this for years! You’re the one who’s scared!”
In the darkness, Harry did not hesitate, nodding at the essence, he said, “Yes.” There was a moment of silence. The dark shadows encasing Harry’s room moved, retreating back to the central body of the essence slowly; the moonlight revealing itself again through the blinds of the windows, giving a soft light to the room that barely illuminated anything. The central darkness stayed, pure shadows and hidden from clear view as Harry stared. It was as though looking into a void that created itself and refused to leave, no matter how much light was pressed upon it. The shadows all collected there in the swirling mass and the essence’s figure disappeared into the void. There was a whisper, like a small cold breeze in the wind, and out from the corner of Harry’s room jumped an animal, standing in the moonlight. Harry quickly turned on a lamp to stare at his new familiar.
Nagini nodded.
“Ron texted all of us about the food, I hope you’re not mad about it Draco,” Neville said, his cheeks turning red.
“Ronald!” Hermione yelled disapprovingly. She frowned and looked at the paper again as she reread it. “Harry,” she said hesitantly. “Everything you told us, from what you said to everyone and the uh… other thing. It was all true?” He looked at him as though she didn’t know how to react. After Harry and Draco sent the container with the letter, Harry brought Ron and Hermione to a secluded place and told the two everything Voldemort told him and Draco the night prior, as well as everything that happened in Dumbledore’s office.
Mr. Malfoy sighed, looking reluctant, but stood as he outstretched his hand as well, “For my family… Lucifer Morningstar! Light-Bringer! I bind you!”
“Oh thank goodness, you are safe, thank goodness,” Uncle Remus breathed when he was able to talk again. Both he and Uncle Sirius pulled Harry and Draco into a hug.
Zabini stared at Harry, his mouth hanging open. “You just yelled at me,” he whispered. “That’s… that’s amazing,” he grinned.
Quick as lightning he grabbed Harry’s and Draco’s hands and laughed, “I think I’ll interfere with their plans!” The flames around the stump once again burst with an angry fire, green of color that towered high into the sky. Harry and Draco shared a look of fear as they felt their bodies trapped in place, unable to move by an invisible force. Blaise was smirking at them, leering at them openly as he said, “Don’t worry boys, you’ll thank me in the long run but fore now, let’s leave a little mark.” He took Harry’s hand and brought it up to his mouth. Opening his mouth wide like a snake, far wider than any human could, Blaise bit down on Harry’s hand, two pointed teeth landing directly in the center of the Devil’s mark. There was no blood but still Harry screamed as he felt something seep onto his hand. Draco tried to yell out to Harry but found his voice lost. After a minute of the agonizing pain, Blaise finally opened his mouth to remove Harry’s hand. Still throbbing in pain, Harry stared at his mark to see that there was a new addition. Furious red, it looked like a sharp spiral perfectly in the center of the two black horns. The spiral was perfectly spaced with no imperfections, yet looked strangely pointed at times, as though it was moving when Harry stared at it long enough. Draco’s screams filled the air and Harry turned his head to see that Blaise has bitten him too.
“Only to give him a cup of water,” Remus said, giving both his husband and Niall a warning look. “Afterwards, Sirius and I are going to sit you down and have an important talk.”
“You take that back right now Malfoy!” Harry yelled as they stepped out of the car.
Dumbledore opened the door, and Ron jumped out of his bed, sweaty. “Professor Dumbledore!” he squeaked.
“We didn’t know that you were gay,” Dean said, looking around. Ron nodded, looking a little ashamed of it himself. “And we kept egging you on to date girls!”
She broke and turned quickly as she hunched over. Madam Pomfrey held her, and escorted McGonagall out. A few moments later Filch left the dormitories.
Mr. Malfoy recovered first. “And why… should we care? This has nothing to do with Draco, just the fr—Potter.” He glanced at Uncle Remus.
Harry curled around himself, shaking as he cried silently. There was a rush of footsteps, and a moment later Harry heard one of the twins yell out, “Mum! Mum! It’s Harry!”
“Strange, they should have gotten it in time, did they mention your owl?” Theo asked.
“SILENCE!” Mr. Riddle yelled, “Parkinsons! Control your daughter!” Pansy’s parents looked hesitantly at Mr. Riddle before forcing Pansy to sit down. “We know what happened on Samhain, we know of the tragic death that that came to us… however we must also come to terms that though Potter might have been the target, it was he and his lovers whom saved us. And because of that, this church has decided to give them the same blessing and tradition as it does to all future joining’s,” Mr. Riddle lectured. The people went silent. Mr. Riddle looked over them and continued. “Their wedding will be on the winter solstice, when the moon’s radiance reigns supreme over the light’s sky. A second reminder shall occur when the date comes closer and more details are known. Until then, you will all join me in congratulating this lovers’ joining and celebrate the coming of their new life as one function.”
Mr. Krum just grunted. “You two are the good ones, you went to Durmstrang. Who knows what they fill the children’s heads with here at this Hogwarts.” He said the word like it was a disease. The twins just sighed just as the door opened and three people walked in. Harry gave a scream and ran towards Viktor, hugging his friend tightly. “And see how he greets him! Niall, talk sense into your brother, and make him mate with Viktor,” Mr. Krum complained as Viktor easily caught Harry. The young Omega did not even notice the attention they were getting as he smiled and walked back with Viktor to his parents, Viktor’s arm around his shoulders. Viktor hugged and kissed his mother before shaking his father’s hand and giving Niall’s shoulder a friendly slap and squeeze. “I’m so happy you two were able to come,” he said to Harry and Niall. “You too, Mama and Papa,” Viktor said.
“You mean, it’s not weird?” Neville asked. “I uh don’t know anything about this—I’m the first Alpha in my family at all!”
“Yes,” Draco answered easily.
“Who’s there?” said a nervous voice he recognized as Mrs. Weasley’s. “Declare yourself!”
“Ohh, that’s rough, but at least you’ll be in good hands, eh?” Ron smiled, “Harry’s a good guy.”
“Respect? Sounds like something that should be earned,” Harry hummed. “When will this carriage start?”
“Damn right I don’t,” Niall nodded. “Anyway, one o’clock, I throw your potion at Umbridge?”
“Or what, Omega?” Draco scoffed. Harry glanced at him and did not say a word. However, Draco suddenly began to panic as his tongue started to feel icy-cold as it stuck to the roof of his mouth.
“Of course you stick up for her,” Ginny said, rolling her eyes at Ron. “Fleur, Harry,” she added. “She’s just so annoying! Why couldn’t Bill get with someone better—like Tonks?”
“Well, good for us, I was able to sweat talk the owner,” Draco said, glancing back, “he somehow thinks we’re in our twenties, looking very youthful, and while it was disgusting, he just wanted to watch you browse his wares.”
“My lord?” Mr. Malfoy said, looking a little confused.
“Lucifer Morningstar! Light-Bringer! I bind you!” Draco yelled out. The cube began to whirl, the strange markings carved into it began to glow. The Devil looked at the cube, then at Draco, and began to laugh.
“No, I believe not,” Dumbledore said. “I believe that Lord Voldemort never held the ability to love.”
“Talk?” Harry asked.
Harry looked around, finding Nagini sitting on the table. He glared at her. “YOU!” he yelled, “You stupid snake you betrayed me!”
“Then you better shape up your Transfiguration grades, though casting spells is rare in the art of potion-making, I assume that you are at least aware that there are several difficult potions that require its ingredients to be transfigured from other objects,” Professor McGonagall said.
“I never thought of it like that,” he said. “I mean yeah there was a huge rivalry between us… still is I guess, but it’s more complicated than that. It really started when I started to read about Pureblood culture, this was also around the time when I was discovering that I am gay. I was experimenting, wanting to learn about myself and Draco. I guess you can say I loved him since third year and at the time when I heard about the Submissive Clause, it sounded perfectly romantic. Marrying your love, and having your love be proven superior because of your submissiveness, your willingness to submit. Obviously I didn’t know exactly what that meant at the time, but now I do and… I still love it, I’m happy identifying myself as a submissive, as Draco’s submissive boyfriend. I just haven’t been able to act on my wants till this summer. Voldemort returned, he offered to teach me as a way to get to Draco, and I took it. I became his apprentice; I was able to talk with Draco face to face—show him my love and submissiveness—and we started dating. He must have also had feelings for me, I mean we’ve been butting heads for four years, it’s hard to not have feelings for a rival like that. After that, everything basically fell into place… and just recently I’ve became a pureblood.”
“Alright, fine,” Draco said, nodding. Harry was happy that Draco decided to put it off for now, however he could still feel his Alpha’s worry. Harry went under the covers searching for their underwear, slipping his on first before slipping Draco’s onto his Alpha. They got out of bed and got ready for the day.
“It just feels wrong,” Harry frowned. “Like, it saps me of something. Alpha and I agree that we need to try one month without it and go from there.”
“I must say, I must agree with Harry on this point, Minister,” Dumbledore said, speaking for once. “I too am shocked that you want to change your career path, however, what you propose does sound intellectually interesting. Though, this would require a mastery of Ancient Runes, which you have not taken up as an elective.”
Draco gave an impatient sneer, “I know it was one of you who whispered that spell in my ear,” he said, “telling me how to make Goyle infertile. Come out now, Harry is my submissive, and so are you!” Still there was darkness. Draco turned to Harry and grabbed the back of his neck, “Show them your submission, boy,” he commanded.
“Harry,” Hermione whispered, “When did this started?”
she asked.
he hummed. He sat up a little taller and stared at the two of them. “We are twins who were forced to separate from their only friend and school and now forced to pretend that we are even happy to come to this damn place. We want to be alone, Beta, so leave us be.”
“Yes Alpha,” Harry whined. Draco dressed Harry in his school robes, an act that Harry did not even feel embarrassed about. He wanted to be doted on in that moment, to have any excuse or reason to have Draco touch and hold him just so he could forget the disgusting smell of McLaggen’s arousal. The train stopped and Harry held onto Draco, not even thinking of separating to sit with his friends on the carriage ride to Hogwarts. Students glared and whispered about him as Draco led the small group. The five got in and closed the carriage. A few moments later, the thestrals in front of the carriage moved, pulling the group to Hogwarts.
Harry rolled up the scroll in confusion and looked down to see the shadow-walker. “Err… thanks,” he said to it awkwardly. The snake gave no reply, instead slithering back under the chair. Harry immediately got on his hands and knees to peak under, finding nothing.
“Now come on, the ship leaves in an hour,” Sirius muttered. The four of them wore their heaviest robes, though it was a pleasant day in Britain. Harry looked quite lovely in his, a long emerald robe that matched his eyes while Niall wore a dark red robe that showed off his developing body. Niall’s auburn hair was short, only a couple of inches long while Harry’s was starting to grow out. Remus made a tutting sound as he checked Harry’s hair as he adjusted his robe. “They should have a barber there to cut your hair, otherwise I’m doing it.”
Harry felt relieved and turned to Ron and Hermione, smiling. “Well,” he said, “That solves the Alpha Protein, now I have to go and write a quick letter to my father about it all.” Ron and Hermione shared an uncomfortable look but nodded. Harry saw it and gave them a reassuring smile, “When we’re alone, I have some major catching up to do. But first, let’s go somewhere else? Draco—” he turned around only to see his Alpha standing behind him holding two cups. The Alpha silently handed one to Harry. The Omega pouted, “Just because you gave me a drink doesn’t mean you’re in any less trouble,” he warned.
he admitted.
Harry nodded, “He told me that Dumbledore asked him to get the werewolves on his side.”
he thought as he continued to hold Remus. Fear of being left alone, of Dumbledore or anyone messing with his family, washed over him and that only made the Alpha more possessive, more paranoid about making sure to keep Remus safe.
“What? You asking for permission, Malfoy?” George said.
The rest of the day, Harry felt like his body weighed nothing and his heart sang every song possible. Especially when Uncle Vernon approached Harry to tell him that he, Aunt Petunia, and Dudley were going out for the night. For once in his life, Harry relaxed in the empty house. It squeaked around him. The pipes gurgled. But none could detract from Harry’s happiness from the day’s events with Draco. And then, quite distinctly, he heard a crash in the kitchen below. He sat bolt upright, listening intently. The Dursleys couldn’t be back, it was much too soon, and in any case he hadn’t heard voices.
“But has he ever?” Harry asked.
“No, you’re wrong!” Harry said. “I don’t know what you are trying to accomplish but I know who I am. I have enough to deal without your psychological mess—”
“Oh, what would you be doing then?” Hermione asked. “I can see why Ancient Runes would be a requirement for this.”
“Okay,” Harry nodded. The two stood awkwardly and Harry took the first move. He hugged his father and stood on his toes to kiss Voldemort’s cheek. “I better hear about you looking for your own happiness,” he said strictly. “I don’t want to hear about you being alone. And no, Mama Nagini does not count.”
“Why not?” Harry asked simply.
“Who else would visit you?” the voice behind the door said in a droll voice. Bellatrix opened the door to see Lilith standing in the doorway, looking surprisingly neutral. “Hello Bellatrix, may I come in?” she asked.
The two have been ‘dating’ for two weeks, a word which here meant meeting up whenever they could to snog and touch themselves. Today, however, both Harry and Connor were to go all the way. Connor led Harry along a dirt path in the woods, before turning off and walking around trees, this way and that, until they reached a small picnic blanket. The boys were laughing as they did so, a strong fire growing within Harry. “You ready babe?” Connor smirked at Harry when they stood on the blanket, reminding Harry of the day when Connor saved him from his cousin when Dudley tried to use Harry as a new target practice for his hockey stick.
He hated hearing them, he wanted to block out the screams, but Harry focused as his lord commanded. He focused on the screams, on the anguish faces the target was making, and through them did flashes of the real Minister appeared. The real Minister mocking Harry, calling him ridiculous, flashes of anger appeared in Harry’s soul, and he found the spell becoming easier, the screams more tolerable. The Dark Lord noticed this, and smiled. “Yes, yes… good Harry,” Voldemort said, “your anger is powerful, yes… I can feel it. It is not as radiant as when you’ve killed Wormtail, but the power is still there, locked away deep inside. Tap into it Harry, use your anger not just against your personal foes, but against mine as well. Use it as a weapon, and you will become a wizard far more powerful than Dumbledore could dream of. Use it, and become my apprentice… my heir… and succeed
“You should,” Harry said. “I have Blaise and Theo; they seem nice enough. You should find two friends to hang out with too. Or at least be nice to them. Just keep your temper in check, I’m not there to keep you in line.”
“That’s not a demon, you idiot mortal,” Blaise said, “It’s a monster, plain and simple.” He glanced back at the man before turning to Harry, “I’m sorry baby but looks like we’ll need to do a quick lesson,” he said. He looked critically at the monster before him. It’s first head was busy eating the remains of the makeup shop keeper while the second and third kept pounding away at Draco’s shield, the boy grunting and wincing with each blow. “Right, we need to freeze it,” Blaise said. “Ice magic should do the trick here; we need to aim for the heads Harry.”
Harry’s voice echoed in the forest. The candles’ flames burnt violently, turning into an eerie green that gave everyone a deathly glow. A tense silence filled the area. All eyes were on the circle of fire in the center of the stump. Nothing happened for a moment until, suddenly, a hand thrust out of the portal, slammed on the stump and pulled as though dragging his body out of it. The demon slowly appeared, pushing himself out of the portal. He was dressed somewhat revealingly, leather strips that left little to the imagination, yet he was still somehow decent and regal looking as he now stood in his full frame, staring at Harry and Draco with red eyes.
he yelled out. The dummy did not move at all, barely a scratch appearing. Harry tried again, swinging his arm, “
“Was just told to tell you,” Blaise shrugged. “Anyway, how are you holding up? I hope the lions are treating you good.”
“Yes,” Harry nodded, “Where are we going?”
“Even though it felt so right,” Harry muttered, smiling softly at the memories.
“Don’t trust him,” Weasley said immediately, Granger nodding along.
“Indeed, you have,” Dumbledore said, looking at Harry with a somber, regretful look. Almost pity-like if Harry did not know the man better. “Kingsley has done everything he could to treat your wound, and I came as quickly as I heard. We’ve treated it, and it will scar, however Harry, you are now, and forever will be a werewolf.”
“Well, we’re reading just now,” Professor Umbridge said. “If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.”
“Yes, my lord,” Snape said, bowing stiffly before sitting.
The rings on their finger glowed warmly and turned into two sets of small rings, to show their marriage to both.
“I am, sir,” Harry said politely.
Chapter 17
Death. Death was a terrifying concept, an unknowable abyss that would last for the rest of eternity. And yet, it was also inevitable, a force to come to everyone, from great tyrants to common wizards; from leaders to common folk; and Dark Lords and their followers.
“Do you think… that Blaise was right?” Harry asked to no one in particular. “He mentioned my womb… or at least the space in me where a womb can be formed. Do you think Mr. Riddle wants me to have a child with Lucifer?”
Nagini asked.
“Will you be joining us at Hogsmeade?” Theo asked, “we all usually hang together. Us, Crabbe and Goyle, and Daphne.”
A cold shiver went down Bellatrix’s spine. She knew how she was going to come back to her home, she knew the pain that was coming, and though she was afraid, she refused to let it show. “How long?” she asked.
“Take my feathers, mages,” he said. Harry and Draco took Blaise’s feathers, “lay them across the stump,” Blaise instructed. They obeyed, walking around the large stump and spread Blaise’s feathers around. With each feather added, Harry felt the air becoming thicker with both atmosphere and essence. When they were done, they returned to Blaise’s side. His clawed hands reached out for them, wrapping around their waists as he kissed them one at a time. “My sweet mages,” he purred, “I will need to speak a language that none of you should hear. With your permission, I will take your hearing momentarily.”
Draco smiled and pulled Harry to a book on a display, and opened it to a page, “Look at this,” he whispered, “Later on, we can have a child with this,” he pointed to a potion that would make Harry able to bear children.
“No, so let’s just start over and you get those thoughts out of your head,” Harry said. An idea popped in his head as he couldn’t find the right words. “In fact, I have a small gift for you, if um I can use your wand for a moment.”
Harry found his anger leaving him. He bit his lower lip as exhaustion took over as he looked at Remus pleadingly. Remus was silent. He kept looking between Harry and Voldemort, his eyes showing great confusion and hurt. Neither Riddle spoke as they waited. They both knew that it was Remus’s decision, and neither could push him.
“Daphne, that’s my name.”
“But Draco, that is what Malfoys are.”
“Nowhere, but I do know this place somewhere else,” Draco chuckled.
“Well, good for you,” Harry sighed. “I meanwhile have to finish that essay for Transfiguration.”
Harry went to the desk and sat down. On it were several textbooks and a large notebook, which was blank. “You will obviously take notes in there,” the Dark Lord began. “We shall begin with the Dark Arts. Now Potter, I am sure that you know at least of some Dark Magic?”
“No? Then you may leave,” Voldemort said dismissively. “If you come just for coddling and taking out unneeded anger… then you better go elsewhere, Potter.”
“Harry, what are you thinking?” he demanded.
“No, sir,” Harry said.
Harry faltered, then looked up at Voldemort, “Why are you at war? Why did you include me? I feel… I feel tensed, anxious… I don’t know what I’m doing, or why I’m doing it.”
“I was told I had to get an ‘Outstanding’ in my O.W.L. Professor,” Harry said.
“Thank you,” Blaise smiled. “Now… I’ll leave you two to your romance. I have to get back to the basement before Harry’s uncles find out I’ve left… but before that.” He got off the bed and stepped towards Harry and Draco. He took both their hands with his mark and brought them to his lips, kissing the marks very gently. “I’ll do my best to teach you two everything,” he whispered, “so be good boys for me, alright?” And with a wink he vanished right in front of them.
“Of course not, she’s just a child,” Draco sneered. “But I have to since our parents arrange it.”
Remus thought. He continued to watch the two until the door opened and a fat man walked out and yelled, “You are not done yet! Get inside you ruddy children, you’ll finish it in the morning!” Remus snarled as he watched the man slap the back of their heads as they walked inside.
“Horrible,” Ron moaned, “that was the worst thing I ever went through.”
They hissed angrily but Harry kept his smile. He didn’t know why many people did not know this, but snakes apparently all knew English very well. He knelt in front of a rather large one and said,
“Yes, ma’am,” Harry nodded, his cheeks getting a dusty pink. “Ginny, can we talked?”
Harry wrote. The cut on the back of his right hand opened and began to bleed afresh.
“Just make her say it to me, not anyone else,” he muttered and shrugged the Ginny issue away.
“Oh right, Sorry Lord Voldemort,” Harry said, calling the man by the name that all heads of the Church are called.
“Different?” Draco repeated. “Different? Well, at least one of us is.” He looked around and saw Goyle sitting with Crabbe. “It’s amazing how quick you’ve seen to forgotten who Harry is,” Draco said, looking back at Greengrass. “First using the word mudblood… and now writing a song that mocked his best friend? It’s almost as if you want the Dark Lord to personally hate you.” He had a cold smile as he saw Daphne’s eyes widen in shock. He walked past her and towards Crabbe and Goyle, who both were oblivious to Draco’s entrance.
“Oh yes,” Uncle Remus said. “He is very good at Levitation and conjuring. As well as knowing some demonology.”
“A housewife.”
“Yeah, it is,” Niall nodded.
“For now, we’ll keep him in the basement,” Uncle Sirius said. “The storage room has a bed. If he is telling the truth, and I am not saying I am trusting him Harry, however if he is saying the truth then, though I hate to admit it, it would be safe to keep the demon here.”
Harry gave a terrified nod and opened his mouth for the potion. It slimed down his tongue and throat, having a hot nutty flavor. When he realized what it was mixed with, he wanted to throw up. But instead he swallowed it. “Good bitch,” Fenrir said, “Now the fun begins.” Before Harry could react and throw any punches, Fenrir bit him.
“Sirius, please,” Remus said. Uncle Sirius stopped talking. “Thank you,” Uncle Remus said gently. “Yesterday has been just a repeat of the same argument that we’ve been having for years. I can’t get pregnant, but that does not mean that Sirius cannot. It’s just that he… refuses to try.”
Time slowed down.  Sound for Harry started to muffle as his focus was on the gigantic jaw of razor-like teeth coming closer and closer with each second. He could feel his heart beat drumming in his ears, it slowly began to override everything until all he could hear was
“Tonight, is the night before the wedding,” Draco explained. “On the eves of their wedding days, Lord Satan will visit only the most loyal and faithful of brides and give them his blessing and seed.”
“No it isn’t,” Harry said, fighting to hide his relief. He didn’t want to deal with this and the Dursleys at the same time. He looked around once more, “Where are the Weasleys?”
“Why didn’t you summon it?” Draco asked.
Harry was supposed to drink the potion, three gulp-fulls after his dinner. So after dinner Harry retreated to his room and took his first full gulp of the Wolfsbane Potion. It was horrible. Despite the steam, the potion was icy cold and sluggish in his throat. Harry grimaced as the potion slowly slimed down his tongue, the taste so disgusting it was hard to even describe. He loathed it going down his throat and was relieved when it was all over.
, Harry thought. His wrist flicked slightly away.
“No, I’m not at all,” Draco answered. “I’m happy that Harry is mine, but I hate the Ministry for the pain he had to go through. Both emotional and physical…” His eyes went towards Harry’s scarred hand.
“Well, he did—”
Draco licked and stuck his tongue in Harry’s ass, causing the feminine boy’s moan to go higher and higher as his tongue prodded his hole, followed later by a slick finger. “Pussy feels good full of Draco’s finger, Harry?” Blaise chuckled.
The letters were all from his friends, wishing him Happy Birthday but still kept vague with them “being busy” and him “finding out soon.” Harry didn’t have time to angst over it, however, as soon he had to cook breakfast for the Dursleys, eating little while they weren’t looking, and as he returned to his room, the shadow-walkers were waiting for him.
When he went into the kitchen, he was surprised to see that Loki was already there, dressed in a lovely black dress that shimmered in the sunlight. “Hello,” he said uncharacteristically calmly, “I hope you’re ready to box a fallen angel. Gods I love weddings—I mean, Me I love weddings, boxing a fallen angel might be my favorite yet!”
Harry stood up and said, “Professor Umbridge!” Professor Umbridge looked up at Harry and gasped.
Chapter 16
The demon caught up with Draco at the door and grabbed his hand before the blonde could open it. “Looks like Harry’s not the only one I have to protect,” Blaise smirked.
“No!” Harry said angrily. Would no one understand? “I was having a dream at first something completely unrelated and stupid—and then this interrupted it. It was real, I didn’t imagine it. Mr. Weasley was asleep on the floor and he was attacked by a gigantic snake, there’s was a load of blood, he collapsed, someone’s got to find out where he is…”
“Yes Dobby, a simple mistake,” Harry nodded.
“Well, it is always a pleasure to meet a friend of Mr. Malfoy’s,” Cuffe said. He stood up to shake Voldemort’s hand.
“What do you mean you saw it happen?” Professor McGonagall said.
“Thank you, Headmaster,” she simpered, “for those kind words of welcome. And how lovely to see all your bright happy faces smiling up at me. I’m sure we’re all going to be very good friends.” Harry looked around; nobody was smiling. “The Ministry of Magic has always considered the education of young witches and wizards of vital importance. Although each Headmaster has brought something new to this historic school…” she looked at Dumbledore and nodded. Out of politeness, Dumbledore nodded back, “Progress for the sake of progress must be discouraged. Let us preserve what must be preserved, perfect what can be perfected and prune practices that ought to be prohibited. Hmm-hem.” She gave a smile and the hall was silent for a full second, all students’ eyes were on Dumbledore. Dumbledore clapped politely for only a few moments, the school following afterwards.
“No, it is perfectly normal,” Mrs. Malfoy smiled. Harry nodded and blushed, “Can I ask you something, as another Omega?”
“Calm down! Both of you,” Harry said loudly, looking between Blaise and Draco. “You,” he pointed to Draco, “have no need to go off like that. So what if we need to do this stupid meditation, you think I want to do it too? Hell no, but we have to if we want the stronger magic. Remember this is all to stop Mr. Riddle if he’s planning something, so calm down and stick this out with me. And you—” he turned and pointed to Blaise, glaring at him, “will not lose your temper like a little kid! You’re supposed to be a hundred years old so act like it! None of you are leaving until you apologize, and I don’t care if we’re late to Mr. Riddle’s class because of it!”
“Yes, and it was continually spiked into his food during most of September until Harry and his friends went down to the kitchens themselves to stop it,” Mr. Riddle nodded. “This is the jar of Alpha Protein that Dumbledore has given the house-elf Dobby.” The jar appeared in front of the Minister. “As with Hagrid, I have personally interviewed the house-elf, under Professor McGonagall’s supervision.”
“I ought to punch you for that!” Ron yelled back.
“Yes… it seems that you have missed quite a bit, Bellatrix,” Voldemort said. Harry looked between the two of them. He seemed to treat Bellatrix differently than all the others. He was kinder, as kind a monster can be, gentler… and the way she looked at him. Harry’s stomach rolled. “Potter is no longer a problem,” Voldemort said. “Quite the opposite in fact… for he is now my son and heir… as well as your nephew-in-law.”
Satan stopped, he turned to see Draco standing before him. Next to him was the cube that Harry was desperately waiting for. “Mor—”
It was Hermione.
Harry asked, amazed.
Harry pouted, “Sirius,” he said, “Draco was the one who helped me—helped both of us through everything. He helped heal my scar.”
“A spell from my potions book,” Harry said, staring at Greyback. “It just came to my mind.”
“Hiya Harry,” he smiled, oblivious to the room’s mood, “had a good weekend?”
The baby was small and chubby, as all babies are, with raven black hair and the most striking emerald eyes he ever saw. “No,” Harry whispered. “No… it can’t be.”
Remus nodded and stepped further into the room. Nagini saw him and sniffed, hissing jealously,
“Well it has before so why not now?” Niall yelled back.
“This has to be a trick,” he muttered. Yet still, he walked slowly towards the crib. The baby was still awake, staring up as next to him a magical stuffed animal played the lullaby. Harry looked down and stared at the child, his heart feeling cold and his body trembling.
“She is right,” Dumbledore said, “The death of Theodore Nott Senior was not your fault, Harry. However, I am disappointed that during these events you haven’t considered coming to me, asking for my help.”
“Come on,” Remus sighed, “We’ll be late.” He pulled out an old large watch with the Ministry’s logo on it and the five of them surrounded it, holding one part of the Portkey as Harry and Draco continued to hold hands.
It did not hurt at all, they stood where they were as the scenery around them changed, blending around them until, with a sudden stopped, Harry felt cool air and saw leather. They were in an entrance area of a large store. Harry was kneeling on a leather pad, with Draco standing before him. To the left and right of them were other pads for kneeling on. The walls were painted a light gray with a black outlining, and Harry could already see things that would make him blush. Draco took the ring off of his finger, and pocketed it before holding his hand out for Harry. He took it and turned to see even more sex toys and harnesses of every kind and size. Directly in front of them was a dildo that looked massive that was advertised as “Realistic Dragon Dildo.”
“Same for us,” Cedric smiled, “my boys treated me so nicely today.” He hugged the twins closer, and kissed both their cheeks. “We just wandered around Hogsmeade buying stuff, how about you two?”
The woman in pink, whom Dumbledore referred to as Professor Umbridge, their new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, stood up with a “Hem hem.”
The goblin just chuckled, and the minecart continued on the track, gaining speed as it closed in on the waterfall. “I am not in the mood to get wet, goblin!” Draco yelled, but was ignored as they soon swept through the waterfall, and Draco sputtered as the cold water hit him. Now wet and angry, Draco sneered at the goblin, crossing his arms. The cart stopped a little after that. In front of them was a large black metal door. Draco stepped out and watched the goblin walk up to the door, placing his hand on it. The sound of a large lock turning rang through the caves, and the black metal doors slowly swung open, revealing mountains upon mountains of gold Galleons, priceless jewels and artifacts, and paintings hanging on the walls. Draco pulled a small leather sack from the pocket of his robe and filled it to the brim with Galleons, not exactly counting how much, for he knew that he had more than enough. With his sack full of money, Draco turned to the goblin. “We are not going through that waterfall again,” he said.
“Sixteen people… how ambitious,” Voldemort said in a mocking way. “To think you will kill sixteen of my men. Very well, name them.” Harry did. He read directly from the list, never once looking up at Voldemort until he was done. The Dark Lord was silent for a long moment, staring down at Harry and Draco. “That is an impressive list of names, I must admit however it is clear whom you are sparing… you wouldn’t dare to hurt those related to your friends.”
“Mal—”
Harry continued himself and pushed down any tears as he swept every bit of paper into the small wastebasket in his room. Once his bed was clean, he moved to the small desk he was allowed and wrote a letter.
“Good, because I’m the only one who’s going to do it, understand baby boy?” Niall grinned, shaking Neville’s ass a little. He steered them away from the streets into a little alley and pushed Neville against the wall softly. Neville was breathing quickly, his eyes staring at Niall with a fearful lust that Niall recognized. “Why are you afraid?” Niall whispered.
A few people mumbled, “Good afternoon,” in reply.
Wind rushed against Harry’s face, the col night air rushed through his hair as the neat square gardens of Privet Drive fell away, shrinking rapidly into a patchwork of dark greens and blacks. He felt as though his heart was going to explode with pleasure, he was flying again, flying away from Privet Drive as he’d been fantasizing in his dreams.
Harry knew better to argue, so he just nodded. “Okay,” he said. “Please, can you…”
“No!” Niall said immediately. “Baby you’re perfect!” He moved closer still. “I mean, you don’t need to force yourself to change just because you’re not like other Omegas. Look at my brother! He is far from any other Omega I know.”
“Why is Potter here?” she asked curiously.
“Then he should go to the Minister or Dumbledore and tell them everything he knows about his family’s dark artifacts and Voldemort’s plans,” Hermione said.
He thought as he stared at it. He shook his head and dismissed it before looking around. It was a little early to sleep, however Harry felt exhausted. He collapsed on the bed and looked over at the books. He guessed he should continue reading, if not for his own orders then just to pass time. With that in mind, Harry took his book and continued where he left off, reading about the many ways a proper witch (he just substituted the word wizard into it) can submit to their pureblood husband.
