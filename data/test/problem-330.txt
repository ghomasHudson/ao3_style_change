Suddenly, the loud sound of the house phone rang out, startling Draco and causing his heart to race. The main landline hadn’t sounded for months since most calls went straight to Draco’s mobile, so a feeling of unease settled in his stomach instantly at the sound of the high pitched ring. Who could possibly have his number? In the moment, he decided that it would be best to let the phone continue ringing due to the fact that it was most likely a sales call or a misdial, and he breathed an audible sigh of relief when it eventually fell silent. Draco goes to turn back to the comfort of the instrument when the phone begins again, causing him to hesitate and rethink the current situation. Running quickly through the possible scenarios in his head, he concludes that he should go to the phone and wait to see if it rings again. Third time’s the charm, as everyone says.
As the following week drags by, Draco becomes increasingly distracted from his work, and this distraction has a name. The distraction also has adorably messy hair and broken glasses and absolutely atrocious fashion sense. Ever since Draco parted ways with a certain Harry Potter on that dark street the man has been on his mind constantly like an itch he can’t get rid of. It's not like Harry is someone he would want to forget about, his smile alone made Draco’s mood higher than it had been in years. Yet in his line of business, you simply can’t afford to get attached to people. The risk of Harry getting hurt increases with each and every thought that Draco spares regarding his presence, and even though Draco barely knows Harry, the thought of him getting dragged into Draco’s destructive web doesn’t bear thinking about. He’d already lost two family members. How could he cope with losing someone that, despite barely knowing him, made him feel normal?
After that, Draco became colder every day, and he didn’t ever think to care about anyone or anything. There are many reasons why Draco resents his father, a key one being how he was denied a ‘normal’ childhood. He never had a birthday party with his friends from school as Lucius didn’t think that they were worthy of entering the Malfoy home, he had never been allowed an actual pet to keep him company, and most of all he resented Lucius for never letting him be anything more than the perfect Malfoy heir who would someday marry a wealthy woman from a family on the same level if not higher than the Malfoys and he would carry on his father’s legacy. Sometimes Draco questions whether his father was like him when he was younger, whether he wanted to rebel against Draco’s grandfather and move to Italy to become a philosopher or something. But that would mean Draco was like Lucius, and Draco was nothing like Lucius. Even as a child he went against what his father wanted to some extent, until the dog incident taught that it was better to just do what Lucius wanted. In a strange way he misses the simplicity of childhood, he was told what to do, where to be, what to wear, what to eat, what to say, who to be. Now there’s no one left to guide him and Draco doesn’t know who he is well enough to guide himself.
Harry opens his mouth to protest but Ron shushes him quickly, “I don’t want you to look like a greasy rat for your hot coffee date.” If it were anyone other than Ron Harry would have been insulted at the comment but he doesn’t deny that his hair is starting to clump together and the bags under his eyes are getting darker every day. One early night couldn’t hurt, plus he doesn’t want Draco to think that he’s anymore of a mess than he already is. He does have some pride after all.
“Well,” Ron is more hesitant this time, “this is where Granger was more uncertain. There are examples of more extravagant crimes, not the simple killings. They’re… elevated. It's like whoever is committing the bigger kills wants to put on a show, like they’re performing to someone and showing what they’re capable of. It's a mockery, they’re humiliating the victims. Granger said she thinks these ones are different because it's not about killing, it's about power. They want people to know that they exist; they want to be known for what they’re doing. But she doesn’t know what she’s dealing with, whether it's one person or more. Yes all the deaths have a heightened level of violence and cruelty but they’re also all completely different. Plus many of them must have happened at the same time and in different places. Granger used the example of the butcher who was hung up with the pigs he’d slaughtered on one side of London then there was the group of teenagers who were impaled on spikes outside a cemetery on the opposite side. There were more too but you get my point, there are just a lot of coincidences in this whole thing.”
When Draco is out of sight of the apartment block he leans against a wall to stare up at the cool evening sky. The light wind brushes over him, as though it were clearing him of his sins. He removes his latex gloves and shoves them in his suit pocket, before sending a simple text to Harry.
“That would be wise.” Draco smiles and leans back in his chair. “So,” His voice signifies a change in topic, “Tell me about your family.” Harry’s eyebrows raise in surprise, he hadn’t been expecting that topic so soon. Draco notices his surprise and continues to speak. “When I mentioned not wanting to do what my father told me you nodded in agreement, I’m interested to know why.”
“’S fine, wasn’t getting a good sleep anyway.” Draco can hear Harry yawn and he can’t help but smile at the thought of how adorable Harry must look now, messy bed hair and all.
“Coming out tonight, Harry? It’s quiz night at the Three Broomsticks and Neville wants you to come along to get your
“Please,” Draco throws the gun on the ground as he sobs, “Please, Dad please, I don’t- I can’t do this please don’t make me kill him. I-I’ll do better I swear I’ll do what you ask and I won’t question it. I-I’ll be the best son ever but just don’t d-do this I don’t want to hurt anything. Midnight is al-all I’ve got please-” The cries of the boy had been cut short by Lucius dragging him upwards so he was stood straight. Lucius picked up the gun from the ground and had placed it in his son’s shaking hands. He slowly moved behind the shaking child and angled the gun so that it pointed directly between the dog’s eyes.
At Lucius’ words the young boy began to cry vehemently. His knees buckled so that he was bent over and his back shook with each sob and his breathing became choked. The small dog had sensed the boy’s distress and looked up at it’s owner with wide, dark eyes, which just made Draco’s heart hurt even more. When Draco had finally looked up with clouded eyes he could barely see the man he called father through the clouds of his own anguish. “W-Why are you saying this?” the child had barely choked out, “what have I done wrong?”
As Harry is putting the papers into a pile to leave on Ron’s desk he notices the door to their office open. He straightens and frowns at the bushy haired woman who pops her head around the door to glance around the room. When her dark eyes lock his she flashes a toothy grin and walks over to Harry.
“I’ll take a chance. You seem like you could do a lot better than just the paperwork side of analysis. I never see you out in the field, but just by listening to your take on my work I can tell you’re wasted in this office. So my question is why do you choose to stay in here?”
After about an hour and a half of walking across the hills and looking at the towns below Draco reached a wire fence cutting the old, crumbling farm house from the fields surrounding it. The walls were holding up as well as they could but it was clear that the house was in dire need of refurbishment if the owner wanted to preserve it. The battered roof had tarpaulin over large patches, and nearly all the windows had cracks in them. Despite its pitiful appearance the house was clearly inhabited as Draco could see by the light shining through the windows. The cover of darkness meant that anyone inside would barely be able to see Draco standing across from the window, but Draco could see the middle aged man bustling around the brightly lit kitchen. Draco didn’t recognise him from the photograph but he presumed the man must have been one of the older children given his age. His hair was going grey and there were bald patches appearing in random places, most likely a sign of stress and not of old age. His clothes were ill fitted and worn, the brown, plaid shirt and denim jeans showing a clear lack of care and maintenance. Draco couldn’t see below the man’s waist as he moved past the windows but he assumed the shoes were in no better condition. He also appeared to have a limp as Draco watched him move at the awkward angle; an added bonus making Draco’s job a hell of a lot easier. It was always annoying when you had to chase a target.
“I don’t negotiate,” Draco looked dead into the man’s eyes, “I’m not leaving until you’re dead. But I’ll humour a dead man, what do you propose?”
“Sure, basically there’s nothing dodgy in most of the cases, just your run of the mill killers. They’re smart though, don’t leave any traces, the rooms are usually untouched, save the blood splatters. Granger guesses they’re not anti-social per se, there’s nothing really in support of an insanity plea if the killers were ever caught. They’re…average."
So there was going to be another section to this but it ended up being over 10'000 words so I've split this up into part one and part two :)
“Wow you’re really going all in on me today, thought I was the one who over-analyses everything?” Ron chuckled and Harry grinned briefly, something which Ron hadn’t seen him do in ages. Whoever this ‘Draco’ guy was Ron would happily keep him around if he made it easier for Harry to smile.
“So why ‘ant ya done it yet?” The man grinned widely, showing a mouth full of crooked teeth, “Tell ya what I think, I think ya ain’t gonna shoot me ‘cause you wanna know why yer daddy didn’t kill me in ‘98.” Draco remained silent and the man nodded proudly, “Thought so. Tell ya what, I’ll make ya a deal.”
“Good,” Ginny leans against the door frame and flashes a smile at Hermione, “Hey Hermione. I’ll let you get going then, remember to text Ron that you’re home, Harry. He spends half his time stressing over your lack of sleep, at this rate he’s making Mum look like the most relaxed person on the planet.”
“Well I did learn from the best,” the compliment made Harry’s smile widen. “But seriously have you got anything new? I’m getting bored with the robberies McGonagall has given me to look over. There’s only so many times I can read about lax security in the alcohol section at Tesco, you’ve gotta give me something vaguely interesting.”
“No,” blood spat out of Draco’s mouth as he struggled against the bigger man’s grip, “I could go all day.” Draco used all the strength he could muster to kick Mulciber’s crotch, and with a load groan the man threw Draco back towards the wall of the apartment. Draco landed on a coffee table which instantly collapsed, and from his lying position he could see Mulciber bent over cursing.
When Draco’s cousins eagerly asked him what he had gotten for his birthday later on at a family gathering he’d looked at them with dead eyes and told them that he’d gotten a snakeskin notebook.
The fresh air hitting his face as he steps outside the house is a vast relief; he had no idea how stuffy it was in there until he was out. The walk back to his house was a blur, and as he stumbled up to the room where his parents stayed his mind was completely blank. He only began to think when he walked over to the dresser specified in the instructions, opened it, and curiously cocked his head at the note in the otherwise empty draw. He hesitantly opened it and stared at the paper.
The small coffee shop where Harry arranged to meet Draco is surprisingly dark when he enters the next morning. The industrial lamps hang from exposed wires in the ceiling and Harry has to squint slightly to make out the sleek white hair in the far corner of the room. Draco has his back turned to the door so Harry composes himself briefly before walking over to the man. There’s a jittery air to Harry’s movements, like an excited but nervous child, which is exactly how Harry feels right now. Yes, he and Draco have been speaking a lot and he would be lying if he said that he didn’t feel a connection with Draco, but this is only their second face-to-face meeting and the butterflies in Harry’s stomach are going haywire. He’d been tired and stressed during their first meeting, but now he’s buzzed on adrenaline and wide awake and afraid of how Draco will react to him. Ron would tell him to ‘act natural’ and ‘just be himself’ but being himself could end in disaster.
“W-what’s that for, Father?” His voice trembled and he had struggled to see clearly as his eyes welled up with tears. Draco had had an idea of what the gun was for but in the innocent eyes of an eight year old he didn’t think his father would hurt anything. Lucius rolled his eyes in exasperation as he roughly shoved the gun towards Draco. Draco had violently jerked away but one glance at Lucius showed that the older man’s patience had worn thin. Draco held out his small, shaking hand and took the gun. He remembered how heavy it felt in his hand and how he felt shocked but also completely mesmerised by the cold and lethal object in his hands. Yet when he had heard his father cough impatiently the reality of the situation came crashing down and Draco had looked up at his father with wide, fearful eyes.
A shiver had ran up Draco’s spine as his father’s gaze pierced his skin like a dagger. The eight year old nodded slowly, unsure of where this conversation was going. Lucius smirked slightly at the blonde haired boy before he reached into the pocket of his coat and pulled out a loaded pistol. Draco’s breathing turned to frantic gulps of air as his heart rate sped and he stepped back, patting at his leg in the hope that Midnight would come over to him.
“Your mother cares about you far more than I do Draco; even you can figure that out. But don’t be fooled; even she wouldn’t hesitate to cast you out if you don’t follow tradition. Do you know how hard your mother and I have worked to keep the family name going? We have built up the legacy of my father and have created a business which you have a duty to protect. If you don’t then you leave us no choice but to cast you out Draco, no inheritance, no title, no land, you’ll be left with nothing. Do you want that?” Every word that Lucius said chipped away at the defensive stance Draco had taken on and the child had felt as though his heart were being punctured with hundreds of needles. Tears welled in his eyes and he looked pitifully down at his shoes.Through his blurry vision Draco had seen Midnight come over and start sniffing at his feet, and the tug at his heart still resonated with him over twenty years later.
The man smirked as he leant against the sink, and a subtle feeling of unease settled in Draco’s stomach. “Ya know ya do spend a lotta time in those woods by yer house. Enough time for someone to walk into that big ol’ mansion and plant a timer in the room where ya keep yer folks. Yer pretty fucked up kid, keepin’ ‘em locked up in that house like prisoners. I’d be doin’ ‘em a favour. So yer gonna do as I say or else I don’t tell ya how to stop the bomb goin’ off an’ its bye bye mummy an’ daddy.” The man handed over a phone to Draco, looking at him expectantly. As much as Draco despised his parents, especially Lucius, he didn’t have the heart to kill them. They were still his parents after all, or at least that’s what he told himself as he dialled the number for the headquarters of Voldemort’s organisation. Someone picked up on the third ring but didn’t say anything.
It’s not that Draco is particularly lonely living with no one but the comatose bodies of his parents. For the most part he is perfectly happy with his own company, yet ever since he met Harry he wants to spend more and more time with the messy haired man with the glasses and a tendency to spend several minutes on end just staring into space. Draco is well aware of how quickly he’s gotten attached to Harry after only meeting him once, but he’s never actually had someone who he could form any form of a relationship with. Growing up in a strict household focussed on pride and nothing else meant that he lacked the social skills many other children his age had developed. Yes he had interacted with the people at school and the children of family friends but he’d never genuinely felt a connection with anyone else. Yet now here he was finding Harry on his mind 24/7, and Draco is unsure of whether this is a normal obsession for someone who’s never had a real friend before, or if there are potential romantic feelings bubbling under the surface. If only Lucius could see him now, Draco has no doubt in his mind that he’d have a fit and possibly disinherit his only heir. A few years ago Draco would have wanted to avoid instigating a reaction like that at all costs, but now he couldn’t care less of what his father thinks of him and the choices he makes. It’s not like Lucius would be able to tell him that he was disappointed in Draco, but Draco had been considering sending his parents away with the nurse who would come to feed them  Plus, he is carrying on the family business and it's not like he’s getting anyone to help their current situation. There remains a small part of Draco who wishes he could go back to when he was seventeen and just starting out in the family business. Lucius had declared how he was “so proud of him” — and those four words were enough to make Draco forget about all the heartbreak and nights spent feeling like he wasn’t born into the right family. However, the feeling had not lasted. After a few months, Draco began to realise that he still wasn’t what his father had wanted, and the one time that he had confronted his mother about it she’d said that Draco was reminding Lucius too much of his youth. Part of Draco felt bad for his father after this, but Draco began to resent his father more as it became apparent that Lucius didn’t care about Draco and just wanted to make Draco into ‘the perfect son’. Yes, admittedly Draco wasn’t the ideal son and he didn’t share many of the same values as Lucius — but he was his son nonetheless. His blood.  By the time of the crash Draco felt like it didn’t make much of a difference that Lucius was dead to the world, he’d been dead to Draco since the day he was born.
As the man apparently settled down to eat Draco slowly and silently moved around the house, assessing potential exit and entry points. He considered cutting the phone lines in case the man attempted to call for help but decided against it just in case the police suspected a meticulous killing as opposed to a general homicide when they eventually found the body. There was no one around for miles so he didn’t have to worry about anyone coming by, but the darkness would make it difficult to track the man if he escaped. Hopefully the limp would hinder that course of action. As Draco came to the front door after encircling the whole house he was surprised to find it already open. ‘God he must be going senile’ Draco thought to himself as he quietly pulled the plastic suit on over his clothes and loaded his guns. Just to be safe he kept a cocked pistol in his hand as he softly walked into the house, sticking close to the walls to keep the doors in his direct line of sight. There was a set of rickety stairs towards the centre of the house but the lack of a bannister and the general instability they seemed to have assured Draco that no one would be running up and down them. He can’t be one-hundred percent certain that the man was home alone however he appears to be cooking for one and there are no other lights on in house. Even if there was someone else in the house they most likely wouldn’t pose any immediate threat to Draco’s plan.
Fuck, Draco thought as he ran a hand through his hair, am I becoming like him? Staring at his reflection in the computer screen, Draco dragged his gaze across his sharp facial features, the silver blonde hair, the cold eyes hiding a million lies. Was this what Father did, all those years ago? Stare into a face which is supposedly his own, and see nothing but his own father? The warm feeling Draco had felt before when his mind was filled with Harry had left as swiftly as it came, and in its place was an all-too-familiar hollowness in his heart.
“You shouldn’t have given it a name,” Lucius had snarled in Draco’s ear, “It just makes it complicated. Now shoot the fucking dog or I swear on the grave of my father that you’ll live the rest of your life alone with all the other unwanted children.”
“McGonagall won’t be happy about that.” Hermione sounds hesitant, like she doesn’t bend the rules often.
“I suppose we do.” Draco leans back and becomes wrapped up in his own thoughts. Harry takes the comfortable silence to sip his drink and observe how Draco is sat. His body language is far more open than it had been in the pub, he has his legs spread slightly and is absentmindedly stirring a spoon in his coffee. Yet an element of control remains in his hand movement, the spoon moving in perfect circles and in the same place each time. His grey eyes remain fixed on the cup, but Harry doesn’t feel like Draco is being rude at all. In fact, Harry is truly fascinated by the man before him. Draco is both an open book and a mystery, both cocky yet modest, controlled yet chaotic. He’s a riddle wrapped in an enigma, and Harry can’t wait to break the walls down and see what lies beneath.
“Not really, no.” Ron was squinting at the screen in earnest, trying to understand what Harry was trying to imply.
“You’re like a chameleon.” Harry blurts out without thinking, but Draco just raises one eyebrow and makes a small hand gesture as if to say ‘continue’. Harry obliges, “You switch how you look to fit in with a new environment. You’re good at it too, anyone else wouldn’t notice the changes.”
Ron senses Harry’s discomfort so hurriedly attempts to change the subject. “Hey don’t fret; I forgot to tell you that Granger came up the other day to give me some extra insight into the cases. Wanna see?” His tone is hopeful and Harry smiles weakly as Ron brings over a thick wad of paper. “Do you want to read through it now?” Ron asks.
“Hi Harry, it’s me. Draco I mean, Draco is me,” God he sounds like such an idiot right now, but Harry’s sleepy chuckle stops his brain from sending him into a spiral of anxiety, “Sorry, did I wake you?”
“That’s okay, I didn’t see it at first until I went over my notes again.” Harry smiled briefly at Ron before pulling up a list of properties on his computer. “Alright, so even though the areas are all council housing the people living there have the same landlord, well the company anyway. They’re not paying rent to the council-- they’re under a housing association, I don’t know the name and it doesn’t really matter because that’s not the link. It could be if the houses attacked were more random, but the only houses which sustained any major damage were all under a private landlord: this man.”Harry clicked off the list of properties and brought up the file on ‘Dirk Cresswell’; a private landlord owning property in all the areas which had been attacked.
Forced back to the present, he carefully held his hand out for the dog to come up and sniff, and surprisingly the animal took an instant liking to him. Draco smiles slightly as the dog licks the palm of his hand, and his smile widens when the dog begins to follow him on the walk back up to the manor. Draco wouldn’t mind a companion, even though it may be a furry one, and he hopes that Harry likes dogs. Although his trip to the woods hasn’t enlightened him with any new knowledge about the numbers and the mystery caller Draco almost wishes that he had been fixated on the numbers. Yes the numbers were frustrating him but when coupled with memories of Midnight it was like salt in an open wound.
For the past week or so Harry has been acting slightly different than usual, or the usual Ron has seen anyway. He’s less stressed, and although he is still distracted at times, his usually vacant expression is replaced with a small smile and sparkling eyes. In Ron’s opinion he’s still too focussed on this supposed link between all of the murder cases they’ve been getting recently, but he’s happy that Harry is finally acting like he has other stuff in his life other than his job. But Ron is extremely curious about what’s going on in Harry’s head, especially since he has spent a lot more time on his phone than he usually does in a work day.
“Thought so,” the man nodded, “Got a lot more balls than yer daddy did, kid. And put that fuckin’ gun down, I got bad eyes an’ that’s messin’ me focus up.”
“But you don’t keep people safe,” Harry grins down at Draco menacingly, “You couldn’t even protect your own parents. You’re not good enough for me, or anyone. You don’t deserve to live a happy life when you’ve torn lives away from so many others.”
“Oh Draco,” Bellatrix cocks her head mockingly as she walks towards Draco, “They’re as good as dead, what was the point in me being there?”
“I agree. This case is like nothing I’ve seen before. There is no way this is all done by one person but one thing I do know is that everyone involved has psychopathic tendencies to some extent. Did you get that feeling from my notes or did you see signs of anything else?”
“Thank you.” Draco’s voice is small and sincere, nothing like the cocky tone Harry has come to associate with the man. The pair smile at each other softly; nothing more needs to be said.
These are the thoughts running through Draco’s head on the Wednesday evening following their encounter. He’d texted the other man a few times after the initial meeting, but he craves having an actual conversation with the dark haired man. Yes, texting is good for thinking carefully about what he can and can’t say, but ultimately Draco struggles to connect with anyone through a screen. He wants to be able to see how Harry’s styled his hair and what this says about his personality. He wants to be able to smell to subtle scent of Harry’s cologne.  He wants to see the way Harry’s green eyes light up when Draco smiles at him. Never before has anyone been able to wheedle their way into Draco’s mind and completely warp his perception of the world in the way that Harry Potter did. Not that Draco would have let anyone in prior to this experience; the old idea of ‘they can’t hurt you if you don’t let them in’ had been indoctrinated into his mind from an early age. And what would Draco’s darling father have to say about Draco considering opening up his heart to another man, especially a man who doesn’t seem to have any noble ties? God forbid the Malfoy name is sullied; Lucius’ poor heart couldn’t stand such a thing. In a strange way, the fact that Draco knows how much his father would disapprove of his desires only makes him want to act on them more, to remind his father that he had failed to make the perfect son he always dreamed of.
“I don’t want to defend someone I know is guilty.” Draco shrugs, running his finger lightly around the rim of his cup.
“Yeah, I arrived early to get us a table, but looking around it was entirely unnecessary.” Harry nodded in agreement as he looked around the almost empty coffee shop. The two men sit in silence for a few minutes until a waitress comes over and takes their orders. Harry wonders if the fact that Draco takes his coffee black and Harry takes his with extra milk and sugar says anything about their personalities, but that just sounds too much like a stupid online quiz. After the waitress leaves Harry looks at Draco once more and finds the blonde scanning over Harry’s face with his eyes, almost like he was dissecting every part of Harry’s psyche just from his appearance. Harry is usually on the giving end of the analytical look so to find himself being the one under scrutiny makes his stomach twist uncomfortably and he makes a mental note to stop analysing people so often if this is how strange it makes them feel.
“I’m not saying he wasn’t the target, in fact the only thing I am actually certain about is that Cresswell is the target. What I am saying is that this wasn’t necessarily done by a gang, not a local one anyway. It just doesn’t add up, and how would they know which of his properties exist on other estates? They timed it perfectly and like you said it would be a pretty big coincidence. So it's probably not a coincidence, meaning this was planned and those who were involved knew who they were targeting. This is a lot bigger than just some gang violence, and the fact that they managed to avoid being detected shows just how efficient whoever organised this is. Now I’m not saying local gangs can’t be effective and organised but they’d have to be communicating with other gangs from other communities, and I just don’t think this was them.”
“Oh I beg to differ.” Draco’s cold and calculating smirk is back and Harry shifts uncomfortably under the intrusive gaze. Unsurprisingly Draco notices this discomfort, but surprisingly he rectifies the situation by letting his cold eyes fill with warmth and the unsettling smirk melts into a friendly smile.
“Draco.” Voldemort’s voice snapped Draco out of his thoughts and he reluctantly re-entered the room. The brightness seemed even more overpowering on his tired eyes and he was surprised to see the man still so calm despite having been in the company of someone Draco found even more terrifying than Lucius. Draco looked expectantly at Voldemort, wondering why his presence was needed. Voldemort handed Draco the gun that Draco had left on the kitchen table, and a shiver of déjà vu ran through Draco as he recalled his father handing him the gun to kill Midnight all those years ago.
He remembers a few weeks before his eighth birthday he’d seen a tiny dog with black fur and wide, bright eyes when he had been out shopping with his mother in the town, and after that day he’d begged and pleaded his father to let him have a dog. For an eight year old he’d put forward as convincing an argument for having a dog as he could (“I promise I’ll look after it all on my own and it’ll make me into a real grown up like you want, Father!”) and eventually Lucius gave in, which Draco was shocked by at the time. On the morning of his eighth birthday Draco had ran down the main staircase to the living room where his abundance of presents were wrapped in silver and green wrapping paper. The eight year old had bypassed all the boxes and ran directly for the black Labrador with a white smudge on its nose in the middle of the room. It was small and excited and had a silver collar around its tiny, fluffy neck-- and when Draco went down to stroke its head it began dashing about his feet in excitement. The eight year old had laughed, and in that moment he had felt the happiest he had ever been. When his parents entered he did something he had never done before: he ran straight into Lucius’ arms and sobbed out of sheer joy, most likely staining his father’s satin shirt in the process. Lucius had remained uncomfortable against Draco, but the boy hadn’t expected him to react any differently. When he pulled away he looked up at his mother to thank her but had been met with sad, empty eyes and a strained smile which was more forced than usual. Draco was confused for a moment but shrugged it off; he hadn’t wanted anything to ruin the greatest birthday he’d ever had.
“Hey, Draco,” Harry smiled before sitting down on the wicker chair and awkwardly finding an angle where he didn’t kick Draco by accident, “So...have you ordered anything to drink already” Harry internally cringes at his question when he notices the empty coffee cup in front of Draco. How could he be able to observe the littlest things about someone yet completely miss the glaringly obvious? Thankfully Draco just smiles at Harry and doesn’t comment on his idiocy.
“No,” Draco replied without hesitation, “My Father had a deal with…your Lord. The Malfoys could continue with our business, and my Father would work on the side for the Lord. Now it might have escaped your notice, what with not visiting at all, but my Father is somewhat incapacitated at the moment. I continue the business, but have no part in the sick ways of your glorified gang.”
"I haven’t been able to find a definite link yet if that’s what you’e asking,” Ron pulled up his chair so it was next to Harry’s, “but I am looking over some old cases which have a lot in common. Look here; about three years ago there was a series of arson attacks on a couple of council estates just outside of London. They were all put down to local gangs but no one was brought in for questioning because no one said anything. You know, the whole ‘snitches get stitches’ mentality. Well, because no one was brought in it was just forgotten about, but the files still ended up in the system. The thing is that they’re not unusual cases; they’re just normal gang arson. But what’s weird are the locations-- hang on I’ll get up the map.” Ron paid close attention as Harry got up a digital map of the outskirts of London up, not quite seeing where Harry was going with this but nevertheless willing to listen.
“If I told I’d have to kill you.” Draco’s voice is secretive and the deadly serious expression on his face makes Harry rolls his eyes.
“Getting tired, yet?” Mulciber jibed, grabbing Draco by the collar and lifting him up as though he weighed nothing at all.
“The feeling’s mutual.” Hermione smiles back and opens her mouth to speak but is cut off by the door opening once again. Harry glances over and sees the youngest Weasley sibling looking at the two of them with an air of suspicion.
“Here,” Harry pointed with his pen at a small collection of houses on the screen, “This was the first location. It’s not particularly a violent area but there have been minor complaints made about some people so the people on the case wouldn’t have thought anything weird. Now this,” Harry’s pen moved across the screen, “is where the next attack happened. Exact same M.O. but different location and different gangs. Then it happened again a couple of towns over, then again, and again and again until they all just suddenly stopped. Do you see where I’m going with this?”
Another chuckle from Voldemort, another shiver up Draco’s spine. “‘Sadistic’? Draco,” Voldemort shakes his head condescendingly, “You’re just like me, just like my Death Eaters, you’re just waiting to let yourself go.”
“Um, there’s a loose end you’ve left. Cymbeline farm, about six miles from Malfoy Manor. Come quick.” With that Draco hung up the phone and tossed it back to the man, “Now tell me how to disable the bomb.”
“I would like to have not spoken to my parents since I was seventeen,” Draco says, “we weren’t exactly close either, so I understand what its like to feel like an outsider in your own home.”
“Would you do the honours Draco?” Voldemort’s voice was smooth and calm, juxtaposing the manic gleam in his eyes, “After all, you were the one who discovered this mistake of your father’s.” Draco was a lot quicker to take this gun than he had been to take the one to kill Midnight. He turned to the man and looked at him with dead eyes, curiosity rising about why he was so willing to die.
“Can I ask him a question?” Draco quietly asked Voldemort who nodded, leaning back against the wall to watch the scene unfold. Turning back to the man Draco asked, “Why did you wait until now? You’ve known all these years why did you only phone now?” The man slowly walked over to the fridge and Draco kept the gun pointed at him as he pulled a sheet of paper off and walked over to Draco. He held it up for Draco to read, and Draco squinted at the messy scrawl before his heart sank in realisation.
But now I wanna get in touch with Voldemort, give him a lil bit of payback for what he did. Ya know ma niece were only three year old? God I ain’t ever gone forget what she looked like when I found ‘em. Half her fuckin’ face were missin’ and the flies had made her into their own goddamn playground. That evil son of a bitch is gonna pay for that.”
The line goes dead and Draco is left with a high pitched beep to tell him the caller is no longer available, and he puts the phone down slowly. A sense of foreboding replaces his anger and the sense that he is being watched returns. He practically runs up the stairs to his room like he did when he was a child and thought that monsters were chasing him wherever he went. As he lies in the cold bed looking up at the bare ceiling he thinks over the phone call. The numbers resonated with him for some unknown reason and he can’t help but feel like they have significance he doesn’t yet understand, not at one AM anyway. Draco closes his eyes in an attempt to calm himself yet the computer generated numbers keep playing over and over again in his mind. He groans and rubs his face out of frustration; turning on his side to stare out of the circular window at the manor’s overgrown grounds. The moon is full and bright which in turn causes the trees to cast eerie shadows across Draco’s room, and the wind causes the nearby branches to tap at his window like fingernails. Draco’s arms are covered in goosebumps as he tries to calm the unsettled feeling in his stomach. Yet this is a hard thing to do when you’re essentially living in a large, empty manor all on your own. Yes his parents are only a corridor away but they’re not in the position to keep him company. Draco feels completely isolated and, for the first time in years, scared.
“Sure,”Ron chucks the stack of notes at Harry, “Just don’t stay here too late, alright? I’m finishing now but I’ll send Ginny up at 10 to make sure you’re packing up and going home.”
“Not at all, I don’t mind anyone asking questions. I just might not give you an answer and if I do it might not be what you want to hear.”
“How interesting I find your answer.” Draco smiles widely and Harry rolls his eyes, ‘God he’s insufferable’ Harry thinks to himself.
“It’s not you doing something wrong Draco,” Lucius’ cruel smirk was back, “It’s about being taught an important life lesson. You are too reliant on the things around you at making you feel like you belong. The things you care about aren’t going to stay with you and you need to get used to fending for yourself. You are going to have to get used to not getting attached to things in such a childish way; caring is weakness and I don’t want weakness in my family. Do you think I am weak? Do you think my father was weak? Who are you to tarnish the legacy we have built over something so pathetic as caring. I am teaching you a valuable lesson here, draco, so to begin we’ll start with a simple task,” Lucius pointed towards the gun in Draco’s hands, “Shoot the dog, Draco.”
The feeling of relief as he finally reaches the parlour is immense, like a huge weight has been lifted off his chest. He leans against the fading wallpaper and sighs deeply, closing his eyes and scolding himself for being so childish in his unease. The sound of the phone ringing yet again startles him and he hesitates for a moment before picking it up from the receiver.
Also I spent ages on that hyperlink Elliot Alderson is shaking, I put it in because I wasn't sure if everyone would get what a 'plastic suit' was and I didn't really know how to describe it.
As Draco aimlessly wandered down the large stone steps at the entrance of the manor he observed the gravel drive and hedge surrounding it. Malfoy Manor must have looked grand hundreds of years ago, and parts of the manor have held up well such as the wrought iron gate and the main house-- but the acres of land surrounding the home had overgrown to the point where they were unrecognisable. Dark green weeds poked through the gravel but there were no colourful weeds like dandelions or daisies to make the drive any less bleak. The darkness was exemplified by the fact that the overgrown hedges tower high over Draco’s head, making it difficult for sunlight to cut through. Towards the end of the drive Draco cuts down through the hedge and emerges onto masses of open land. If you walked further and looked back at Malfoy Manor you once could have seen it clearly over the hedge and trees but now it was completely hidden from view. This spot is without doubt the area in the manor’s realm that gives Draco the most peace. In this space he can pretend to be anyone he wants and isn’t reminded constantly of the life he truly has. Despite it nearing the end of June Draco shivers slightly and puts his hands in his coat pockets for warmth. Ever since he could remember the manor was significantly colder than the areas surrounding it, but Draco had soon learned to love the cold.
Draco looked up the address from Blaise and saw that the cottage it would take him to was on the outskirts of the next town over. It seemed secluded enough, should things get a little messy. As insufferable as Blaise’s language was Draco had to admit he was actually fairly decent at his job, although not that Draco would ever say that to his face. Grabbing his phone and the bag containing his
“Great!” Ron held his hand up for Harry to half-heartedly high-five, “My work here is done. Now-- I can also tell that you’re still thinking about the case so do you wanna tell me what’s running through that head of yours, or is it another one of your instincts which make no sense?”
Draco had remained silent throughout the man’s story, and the missing information in the file finally made sense. Lucius was terrified of Voldemort, that much Draco knew, and so it wasn’t surprising he attempted to hide his failure. He does genuinely feel bad for the man, no matter what the parents have done the children should never be pulled into this mess of a world. But that doesn’t change the fact that the man is a liability to Draco, and Draco sure as hell wasn’t going to let his father’s mistakes be his downfall.
“Yeah I understand what you mean about the intimacy still being detached. It's like whoever has killed the victims is saying that the victim was just a means to an end. They’re not the focus, the killer is. So what theories have you got so far?” Harry asks curiously.
“Neither have you, nor are you going to start any time soon with the amount of caffeine you’re drinking.” Harry snaps, instantly regretting it when Draco’s eyes narrow. However the annoyed look fades quickly and is replaced with Draco’s trademark mask of indifference.
After a few hours Draco felt like he had a friend who would always be there for him and that Lucius approved of, he had apparently even picked him for Draco! Draco called the dog Midnight which, in hindsight, wasn’t the most creative name but the eight year old had thought it fitted the dog perfectly. At around noon Lucius came back into the living room where Draco had been playing with Midnight, teaching him to roll over and to run in circles.
Draco’s guns were on the other side of the room, behind his target, and the only way he could get to them was to get past the giant man. Frantically looking around, Draco’s eyes were drawn to a bookcase next to the cursing man. What Mulciber had in size and strength Draco had in speed and agility, and with a burst of adrenaline the blonde man scrambled to his feet and ran to the shelf, pushing the shelf as hard as he could. Mulciber grunted as the shelf hit his shoulder on its fall down, but it didn’t cause as much damage as Draco had hoped. There was fire in his eyes as he looked at Draco in rage, and Draco didn’t stop to think as he lurched past the fallen bookcase towards his duffel bag. Thanking all of the gods that he had pre-loaded his Glock, Draco turns around and fires at the advancing figure. The first shot hits Mulciber in the stomach, slowing him down, but he doesn’t fall until the third. Wiping the sweat from his brow with the back of his hand, Draco moves towards the fallen target to finish the job.
“I know,” the man stands up abruptly and Draco instantly lifts the gun, “Woah kiddo am jus’ puttin’ ma bowl in the sink no need to go all ape shit. An’ I respect that yer not gonna let me leave, don’t want yer daddy’s mistake fuckin’ up yer life anymore. So ere’s what yer gonna do. Yer gonna contact Voldemort right now an’ tell him that if he wants to tie up some loose ends he better get his ugly ass down here and sort it out himself.”
“Well if he isn’t a target then what is this all about? It’s a pretty big coincidence that they all attacked his properties.”
“What are you doing here, Bellatrix?” Bellatrix is leant against the doorframe leading to the next room, staring at Draco with her signature manic smile.
Draco glares at his aunt, and is about to retort when there’s a grunt from the floor behind him. Within a second, Bellatrix has pulled a knife from her belt and stabbed Mulciber in the spine. “The Dark Lord sends his regards, Mulciber.” Bellatrix cackles as the man twitches on the ground, blood pooling on the wooden floor.
A few hours of reading and sorting through notes about assassinations pass and Draco has learned far too much about certain members of the 1980s government and the exact method of their assassinations, the inclusion of coloured photographs adding only more to his understanding. There was a significant drop in the 1990s, most likely due to his birth, and Draco smirks at the thought that his father must have been extremely annoyed that the birth of his son had hindered the businesses’ killing progress. The majority of the cases were mundane and straightforward (as mundane and straightforward as assassinations could be, anyway) but one in particular catches his attention. Attached to the inside of a document from 3rd June 1998 is a picture of a family of nine smiling happily at the camera, but what Draco’s eyes are drawn to is the small black Labrador with a white mark on its nose sat in the middle of them. Draco stares in confusion for a moment or two, squinting at the picture in confusion. Although it's been around 20 years Draco is almost certain that the dog is Midnight, but the rational side of his brain is telling him that that’s ridiculous. But the date is from 3rd June, only two days before his eighth birthday when he was given an identical dog. Looking inside the file he learns that the father, James Rhodes, had gotten into debt with Voldemort and when he couldn’t pay him back Lucius had been sent to execute the whole family. Usually Voldemort’s lackeys (or the ‘Death Eaters’ as they liked to be called) would be involved in such a large scale job since they were typically a lot more violent, but Lucius had owed Voldemort a favour and so he was sent in to do the dirty work, but had probably decided the dog would be best used for Draco instead. What catches Draco out, after the initial surprise that his dog had belonged to an executed family (it’s an extremely Lucius thing to do), is the fact that Lucius only reported eight executions and there are nine people in the photo. Lucius Malfoy was by no means a good man, but he had been damn good at his job and it's just not the kind of thing that he would intentionally let slide. Unless one of the people wasn’t there for some reason and for some reason Lucius decided they weren’t worth the effort tracking down. Knowing Lucius it was possible that in his arrogance he didn’t think the person who was lucky enough to evade assassination would be competent enough to track them down, and so he probably just lied to Voldemort by saying they were all dead.
The vibration from Draco’s phone startles him out of his thoughts, making him jump slightly as it echoes around the silent room. If it weren’t for the texts Draco imagines he would go insane in the empty house with no one to keep him company except two lifeless figures and the spiders crawling the walls. When Draco checks his phone the light from the screen almost blinds him as it pierces the darkness of the room. This is the one room in the house that his father wasn’t allowed to touch. This had made it into a sanctuary for Draco despite his own bed not even feeling like his own; everything was contaminated by the silver and green décor his father adored. The beds were all iron and cold so there was no comfort to be found there, the only place Draco could find peace and solitude was in a small, dark room which had been barely used since Draco was a child. When he was twelve one of the maids had found an old piano in the cellar below piles of paperwork on contract kills over the years, and once all of the dust had been scraped off Draco felt like that battered, old piano was the most beautiful thing he had ever seen. It was horribly out of tune and the keys were yellow with age but after months of pleading he had managed to convince his father that the piano was a way of keeping Draco out of the important business meetings Lucius would hold at their house. Of course Lucius wasn’t going to pay for any repairs; Draco had to pay for it himself as “being responsible for one’s own finances builds character” Lucius said in a monotone voice with a glare that could kill.
“Ya gonna stand there pointing that gun at me all night or ya gonna sit down?” The man looked at Draco with a bored expression, like Draco’s being there were a nuisance and not a clear threat on his life. Draco narrowed his gaze and glanced briefly at the chair opposite the man before looking back at the man.
“Less than three months,” The man shrugged nonchalantly, “By the time doctors caught it it’d spread too much. Ya called me a dead man before, bet ya didn’t know how right ya were. Code for detonating the bombs on fridge, look its right ‘ere. Yer a good kid, get outta this business while ya can.”
Just as Draco was about to put the file away and call it a night the numbers from the phone call rang out in his head again. “980603,” Draco murmured to himself, looking over the file again, before the realisation hit and he flipped the numbers around, “030698.”
“Oh no reason, just wondering who you’re texting and why they’re more important than work.” Ron reaches over and snatches Harry’s phone out of his hand and looks at the contact name, “Ooooooo who’s Draco? That’s a fancy name-- is he a fancy man?” Ron laughs at Harry’s annoyed expression before tossing the dark haired man’s phone back to him. “Seriously,” Ron continued, his tone now calmer as he looked straight at Harry who tried to avoid his gaze, “Who is this guy?”
Harry chuckles slightly as he slings his satchel over his shoulder. He gives Hermione a nod as he leaves and bids the two women good night. The night air is quite warm and pleasant as he walks quickly through the dark streets, careful not to trip over any strangers’ legs on his journey.
Hermione stays silent for a moment or so more before speaking again. “Fine,” she sighs, “but if anything happens to me it’s on you. You better find me a decent paid job if I get fired.”
I weren’t round ‘ere at the time, off in Europe tryna sort out apprenticeships with this big car company. Clearly didn’t make no difference since am still ‘ere in this goddamn house. Thought yer daddy was gone come hunt me down with a pitchfork when I got back an’ found their bodies, but he never did an’ am guessin’ he never told Voldemort since him an’ his Death Eaters ain’t ever come lookin’ for me. One good thing that blonde bastard ever did for ma family.
“Who is this?” His tone is harsh, but not like he’d ever been taught to be polite to strangers and this stranger was certainly trying his patience. There’s no response at first, just the sound of someone breathing quietly into the phone. Draco rolls his eyes in annoyance; of course it's just some stupid teenagers playing a prank call. He goes to put the phone down when a strangled cry comes sounds out, causing his grasp on the device to slip.
“Oh lovey,” Jean gently cups Draco’s cheek, “I know you want to please your old man but he’d much rather you be happy and stress free than to stay looking after him and your Ma in this old place.” Draco barely contains a snort of laughter at how wrong she is.
Once again it could just be a coincidence, but unlike Lucius, Draco was not arrogant enough to think that people won’t be able to figure out who his family are and to track them down. Running through options in his head Draco settles on tracking the caller from the landline. Even though he didn’t have the knowledge or expertise to track an unknown caller he did have a family friend who worked at the police station and could most likely track the call in a matter of minutes. Although it was somewhat of a risk getting an outsider in on what could potentially turn out to be an assassination Draco had a sufficient amount of dirt on Blaise Zabini to make his life significantly more complicated if the occasion called for it.
“And hopefully I never earn that.” Draco mutters, keeping his eyes focussed on his aunt instead of the paralysed dying man on the ground.
“I work in crime analysis.” It’s technically true, Harry just won’t mention the level at which he works. For all Draco knows Harry works for Scotland Yard and not the NCA, and for now it’ll stay that way. He notices Draco tense up slightly but he relaxes again almost instantly. Harry frowns slightly but ultimately decides it isn’t anything important. Most people are at least a little bit uncomfortable around members of law enforcement, it doesn’t necessarily mean that they have done anything incriminating. Instead of fixating on the momentary lapse in Draco’s body language Harry focuses instead on trying to convince Draco that he is in fact somewhat interesting. “Is my answer to your satisfaction?”
“Here,” He holds his hand out to take her bag, “Let me carry that down. You’ve done enough for me over the past few months anyway.” Jean looked surprised at his actions, especially considering they had barely spoken in all the times she had been visiting beside the impersonal exchanging of names.
“Questions, questions,” Bellatrix tuts at him like he’s a small child again, “This isn’t the loving welcome I expected after all these years.”
The man wagged his finger mockingly, “Nah-ah, yer waitin’ ‘ere until he arrives. Still got six hours left on the clock, didn’t know how long we’d be talkin’.” Draco felt his fists clench in anger and he tried to focus on keeping his breathing steady. There was no use in panicking in a time like this. He let his mind wander far away from this current situation and found himself thinking of Harry. The man’s presence was extremely calming so Draco pretended he was here with him, as childish as that may seem. Thoughts about Harry ran through Draco’s mind like wildfire, filling his head with images of the dark haired man. He was still a mystery to Draco and as much as Draco liked being the smartest one in the room he knew damn well that he’d met his match. He knew he would give anything to just glimpse inside the mind of Harry, he wanted to know every inch of his mind, wanted to know what makes him tick, what makes his heart speed up and what makes him break down in tears and not want to get up in the morning. It’s somewhat amusing to Draco to think of various interactions he could have with Harry, but ultimately he knows nothing could ever come of wishful thinking. They may be similar but Draco highly doubts Harry would be willing to have any form of a platonic let alone romantic relationship with an assassin. And even if he did it would simply be too great a risk for the two of them. Take the situation Draco is currently in; he’s somehow gotten his parents hooked up to a bomb and now he’s waiting for the most infamous mob boss in the UK to come and do who the fuck knows to a random man who owed Lucius a whole lot of money. Throw Harry into the mix and Draco just doesn’t think he could handle that. Then again he is a damn good liar and if he was as careful with Harry as he is with everything else then there’s no need for Harry to ever find out about this part of Draco’s life.
“Potter?” The woman sticks out her hand to shake Harry’s, “I’m Hermione Granger from Behavioural Sciences. I gave Weasley some files you requested a few days ago and I just wanted to know if you’ve read through them yet?”
“Hello again Harry.” Draco’s voice is just as smooth as it had been that first night but the cockiness is considerably less prominent and his smile is more genuine than the smirk.
Harry shook his head slightly, “I don’t think so, just look at his property rates. He’s got a decent influx of people buying into his property and since he’s a private owner he won’t come recommended by the council. So he must be being promoted by the people who live there, otherwise his rates would be a lot lower. I mean the average rate for private landowners is significantly lower than what he’s earning, and while he’s certainly no billionaire he’s got a fair amount of money.”
“Tell me,” Draco sets his cup down on the table and comfortably rests his cheek in the palm of his hand, “What is it you do? I simply cannot work it out, and I don’t like not knowing things about my…companions."
Draco stumbles backwards, his nose bleeding rapidly after being hit by his opponent. The man in question; 6’4 and built like a brick wall. Most targets aren’t too hard to take down, usually they’re  politicians, hackers, or ?, not typically difficult to take on in a fight. But this target, a certain drug lord named ‘Mulciber’, had been blocking every fatal blow and had only sustained a few cuts to the face. Draco, on the other hand, was beginning to feel the ache of the fight. His attacks were less precise, and his head was beginning to spin.
The man smiled slightly at Draco, a genuine smile this time and not the grin from before. Draco took a deep breath and pulled the trigger. He didn’t flinch as the wall turned red and the body of the man thudded to the floor in a pool of his own blood, a small smile still left on his lips.
Draco doesn’t know why he reaches for his mobile that’s next to his bed, and he certainly has no idea what compels him to call Harry at this ungodly hour, but what is perhaps the most shocking thing is that Harry actually answers.
“Love won’t get you anything in life, Draco,” Lucius’ laughter died down and his tone dripped of pure maliciousness with the intent to break the eight year old down so Lucius could remould him in whichever ways he wished. “Your loving mother is waiting back at the house to phone for a driver to take you to an orphanage far away from here. You will have no contact with either of us again and would become another nameless child in the system. You’re too old to be appealing to most families and not childish enough for any others. You’d be left to rot inside the four walls of a single bedroom watching other children come and go until you yourself are kicked out and left with nothing. See your mother and I do love you Draco, you are our heir after all, but love isn’t going to save you from being kicked into the dirt.”
“That makes sense,” Harry agrees, “I’m no expert on the organised crime that goes on around here but I can probably pull up some files of high profile individuals who may be involved.”
“And look how far that got her,” Bellatrix places a hand on Draco’s gun, gently pushing his arm down, “I’m not going to bring Sissy back, and neither are you. It’s a lost cause, Draco.”
“You haven’t been sleeping.” It’s not a question, it’s an observation on Draco’ part and an accurate one at that.
“I-I’m not sure,” Harry leant back in his chair and sighed, “ just don’t know how to approach this whole thing? I don’t even know what this is, I don’t do stuff like this. I mean you already know that but yeah, I just don’t know what to do. Plus it’s distracting me from the case and I feel like I should just focus on trying to find a link instead of-“
“Nothing, why?” Ron doesn’t miss the subtle blush which rises on Harry’s cheeks as he goes back to typing on his phone.
Ron nodded slowly as he took in the information and attempted to organise his thoughts. “So,” he said as he absentmindedly ran his thumb along his bottom lip, “You’re saying that this wasn’t a gang crime? We’re looking at third party involvement. But what’s the third party? What’s their motive? We can’t just start throwing around accusations without evidence.”
Over the days following his date with Harry, Draco is even more distant than usual during his work. Where his thoughts would usually wander to the dark corridors of Malfoy Manor, he finds his mind preoccupied with green eyes, messy curls, and gentle hands. The target before him is begging for his life, salty tears mixing with the vibrant blood gushing from his head, yet all Draco can hear is Harry’s soft voice telling him that he is no longer alone. The target’s eyes widen as Draco moves gracefully behind him, and his face is forever frozen in terror as his neck is violently twisted to the side. Draco doesn’t even look at the target, imagining that his aggressive touch is in fact a gentle arm around Harry’s neck, that the thud of the target’s body hitting the floor is the sound of him and Harry falling into a blissful embrace against the wall where they met. When Draco returns to the Manor to fill out his paperwork with details of the assassination, he finds he can barely remember what happened, his memories filled with nothing but the man he is quickly falling for.
“I think everyone knows what it’s like to carve their own path in life,” Harry says thoughtfully, My parents died when I was a baby, so I never had them telling me what kind of man I should be. I lived with my aunt, uncle, and cousin until I was seventeen, but we weren’t close so they never really tried to make me like them. Honestly, I think they’re happier pretending I wasn’t around. I believe that family is something you find, and I haven’t found mine yet.” Draco’s eyes remain transfixed on Harry and a flicker of understanding dances across them.
“Where are we going Father?” Draco timidly asked, looking back at the manor which was steadily growing further and further away. He saw his mother stood on the front entrance looking sadly at Draco as he walked down the drive, but she abruptly turned and went inside when she realised he could see her. Lucius still hadn’t responded and there was an uncomfortable twisting in Draco’s stomach which made him feel queasy. He held Midnight tighter to his chest, using the dog as a source of comfort whilst he followed the tall, slender figure of his father into an open field far away from the manor. That year had seen a major heatwave and despite the sky being grey and dark the air had been uncomfortably humid. Draco could still remember how claustrophobic and queasy he had felt, and he had never been certain if it had been due to the weather or his nerves.
“Guess I’ll have to be careful not to get on your bad side then?” Harry lowers his voice to mimic Draco’s.
“I--,” Draco’s words came out in choked sobs, “I don’t want all of that, Father. I jus--I just want you and Mother to love me.” He practically mumbled the last part, and if it hadn’t been for the complete stillness of the air Draco doubted his father would have heard him. Then the sound of Lucius’ laughter pierced the air and Draco began to feel sick. It wasn’t the laughter of a father who was playing an elaborate and cruel joke on his child, instead it had been the laughter of a man driven to cruelty in the pursuit of creating a legacy.
Harry sits in silence as he attempts to organise the new information in his mind, but he feels like he’s hitting a brick wall. “The only link between the cases is the sheer amount of coincidences.” Ron snorts under his breath as Harry rolls his eyes, “Can you leave the papers on my desk? I’ll go over them later.”
In the grass by the side of the main entrance, Draco digs a small hole for the victim of his panic, and gently places the bird to rest in the dirt. After he has patted the earth flat he sits back on the grass, looking mournfully at the grave. How is it possible for him to feel such remorse for shooting a bird when he can barely count how many people he has killed in his lifetime? Because the people deserve it, he thinks, and that bird did nothing to me. He nods, as if reassuring himself that he did the right thing, and hastily wipes away his tears with a dirt covered hand. Getting up and heading back to the Manor, only one thought races through his mind:
“This house has been in me family for years ya know? We used to be a big deal like you Malfoys, but we didn’t like doin’ illegal shit like yer people did. This whole areas full of clay soil, used to make a fortune offa it. But as ya can probably tell that didn’t last much past the 1850s. Hadda sell everythin’, ya know we used to have a big house a couple farms over? Got taken by this lord in the 1890s an’ we were left with this shithole. Anyway am getting’ side tracked.
“You dare speak his name!” Bellatrix snaps upright and points the bloody knife at Draco, “You have yet to earn the right to speak of such excellency.”
and guns, Draco quickly heads out the house and onto the fields. Draco is thankful for the dimming sky as a cloak of darkness means there’ll be a lot less potential witnesses wandering around on the hills. The adrenaline pumping through his veins adds a slight bounce to his step; if anyone saw him they’d presume he was off to have a date with someone he loved, not off to kill someone he had never met before. It had been a month or so since he had last killed, and even then that was a paid job. This is different, he isn’t getting paid for it but he’s treating it like a mission. It’s not that Draco hasn’t killed out of necessity before, a few years ago there had been countless times when he needed to dispose of an unsavoury individual who threatened his family. Draco doesn’t see himself as a proud man focussed on values, not in the same way as Lucius, but he is well aware that sometimes you have to get your hands dirty to keep your future clean. This was one of those cases. If there was even the slightest possibility that the surviving family member could expose the nature of his family business to the general public Draco needed to act fast to stop it. He debates taking a car to reach his destination quicker, but a loud car driving across the moors would be a lot more noticeable than a lone traveller, and Draco doesn’t particularly want to be caught mid-kill.
After he replies to Harry’s message Draco gets up from his sitting position on the floor to wander over to the piano and sit before it. He lightly brushed his pale fingers along the even paler keys, pressing absentmindedly at random which brought about soft echos around the dark room. The sun set long ago but the moonlight is enough to make the keys shine in an almost ghostly manner. Punctuated by the notes, the air held a heavy silence, and Draco contemplated opening a window so he could breathe easier.
The shot echoed across the bare fields and seemed to carry on for hours, and when it stopped the air stagnated around them. After a brief moment Draco had let out an inhuman wail. The horrible noise cut through the silence like a knife through flesh and was only broken by Lucius harshly slapping the screaming child across the face. That was the first and last time his father ever hit him.
The man stood up as soon as Voldemort entered, and Voldemort looked him up and down with an air of boredom and annoyance at being brought out for this.
Draco sits up suddenly in bed, hyperventilating and sticking to his sheets with sweat. A rustle sounds from across the room, and instinctively he grabs the gun from under his pillow, points at the open window, and shoots. A loud bang followed by a small thud sounds out, and Draco blinks slowly while lowering the gun. He walks over to the window and looks down to the body of a bird. It lies completely still on the windowsill, wind ruffling soft white feathers now stained crimson. A deep feeling of guilt rises in Draco’s stomach, and he carefully picks up the dead creature.
Things got worse ‘bout 30 years back when weather changed and the ground was fulla water all the time, couldn’t sell nothin’. We couldn’t even afford to move outta here, so me parents went to yer daddy askin’ for some money. He hooked ‘em up with Voldemort who gave it to ‘em sure, just didn’t tell ‘em about the payback time an’ how yer family dealt with folks who couldn’t pay ‘em back.
Getting lost in his thoughts like this was something Draco often found himself doing. At a young age he felt himself being pulled into a world of fantasy in which he didn’t have to think through everything twice before he said it, a world where his parents didn’t care if his collar was slightly crooked, a world where he didn’t have to be him. When he was out of the house with his mother he would often see a family of redheads laughing and constantly smiling. They all wore mismatched socks and ghastly knitted jumpers at Christmas time, and his own mother would look at them like they were sewer rats whilst encouraging Draco to do the same.
