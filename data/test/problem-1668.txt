And finally we made our way to our rooms. Where you took me on every surface, in every position. Merlin we hadn't gone that many times in a row for that long in quite a while. I am so wonderfully sore today. Your parents sure gave me some knowing smirks when I limped my way to breakfast this morning.
"Yes. Let me take Wojtek from you," I said, holding out my hands. She placed him in my hands before turning to wave at the students she recognized. "Now, this student right here needs to learn a lesson, so I need you to throw her over your shoulder AND punch her in the gut. Can you do that for me love?"
"No Dad, I did NOT say that! Now get out of here ya mooch, I need to go take care of my paying customers!"
I rubbed her back once more and pressed another kiss to her head. "It's called parenting. Someday you'll understand. In the meantime, I'm going to have Pippa call up your Mind Healer and have her come over today so you can talk this through with her until you hopefully understand. Also, I need you to promise me that you will NEVER try anything like this again."
So, now that I've settled on the perfect drumming soundtrack to practice to, I'm about to lead ALL our kids that are home and Shtara's entire troupe through a firedance. I am quite looking forward to looking over to see my beloved husbands watching me with lust in their eyes.
I know! I am going to be so good for you. I am going to go lay down and take a nap on the rug by the floo. That way you can see me as soon as you get home and know that I missed you and I waited for you. And maybe then you'll carry me to bed. Because I like it when you carry me. It makes me feel safe and loved and harder than bloody granite.
After I finished up with Phillip, Miles snagged me and dragged me to the dorm he's currently sharing with Finnegan. And possibly a few others. See, it was still the time when everyone else was taking music lessons, and while Miles would normally join in, he noticed me in the sparring room with Phillip and opted not to. So, once in his room, Miles asked me for another makeup lesson. It seems he had tried doing it on his own and didn't quite like the way it turned out.
She looked at me significantly. "But you do realize that that also means that if two people are consenting, then they CAN do it."
Viper nodded, holding out his hand. Before Other Draco could make up his mind to accept the offer, the door to the suite burst open and a multitude of kids piled in. Elena – who hadn't left just yet – River (who was kicking himself for saying anything), Viona, Eris, Orion, Hazel, Siri, Zwei, Delphini, Tommy, Bellerophon, and Harrison were all chattering at once, demanding to know if it was true that Other Draco had come to this world. They were pushed forward a bit farther into the room as Draco's adopted younger siblings (who were home from Hogwarts for the weekend) entered the room too. Eliza, Sebastian, Della, and Gavin all wanted to see the other version of their older brother.
Now that I've had a mini mental health break and I'm calm again, there are a few things I want to address. I'm NOT saying you are wrong. I DO agree that *I* need to make an effort to NOT treat her like she only has worth if she's beautiful, BUT - and please try to hear this with a calm mind - but MAYBE you might need to consider that she cannot stop from flirting because it's an inherent part of who she is. Like Magic is part of who we are. Like being a girl is part of who Hazel is. We cannot take being a girl away from her and we would do far more damage trying than any sort of result would be worth.
In any case, tomorrow night is our adult party, and as I promised (I think), I'm going to have you wearing nothing but gold satin underwear and shimmering gold body paint - and golden sandals. You'll be the God Adonis. I decided that *I'm* going to be the God Hades... Hercules style. So I'll be wearing black and blue robes, bluish skin, and I even plan to charm my hair to look like it's burning from a blue fire. After a few hours, I plan to take off my robes and reveal the sexy leather trousers underneath. With no shirt. You'll have to tell me if my chest looks as sexy charmed blue as it is normally.
"WHAT ARE YOU *DOING*?!" I demanded in shock. Side note, why do people who want to seduce me always think it's a brilliant idea to do so when I'm just about due to wake up?
He chuckled and nodded. "Yeah, after getting used to it, it's what I actually prefer. Or did. Everything's different now."
We had a nice day yesterday spending most of it in the stables. But far and away, the best part of the day was you coming home before bed last night. I know you had said you would be home to sleep where you belong, but we can plan and plan and plan and things don't always end up the way we envisioned. So I was hopeful you'd be home, I didn't want to truly believe it until I could see you in person.
Speaking of teens... I overheard this somewhat alarming conversation between Viona and River today. They were standing a bit off to the side of a table where the rest of them were eating lunch, and didn't know I was there because I was actually just rounding the corner of the food truck and I stopped when I heard Viona shriek.
Similar to when I read your email descriptions of things we did together, it was completely different hearing everyone else's perspective on our festivities. Did you, at any point in your life, think Pansy, Hermione, and Luna would sit around your dinner table discussing your talent at cunnilingus? Gotta say, never would that have been on my radar. Then again, the conversation also included Hermione and Luna discussing what it was like to have a penis and "bugger Harry's fit arse" so maybe I've had a stroke of some sort, or I'm in a coma and dreaming all of this.
Well, since I was full and Morgana was already in a carrier, I didn't see any reason why I shouldn't go. So, I cast a dressing spell and had Muffy Apparate me - as I didn't want to risk overusing my magic while still recovering from my pregnancy.
"Shag me hard up against the wall, and then deny me my orgasm and torture and *spank* me! Force me to please you, and then make me beg like a slag to have my release!"
During the break, Elena unsurprisingly burst into song, and this prompted me to join in with her. She was glowing with happiness, dancing back and forth between me and Greg - both of us obliging her with dances - when some soft laughter startled us.
"Elena. She has drama you may want to ask her about going on and is coming with me. That said, I'm curious about one thing," I looked the decently fit and attractive man and woman over. "Do you actually know that he is JUST turning 18 today?"
Yes, I was afraid to make you mad at me; to engage in an encounter that *could* potentially turn dangerous with our kids all right there and you still mad a me for putting myself in danger. So, I was trying to think of ways to express my displeasure while somehow deescalating the situation. And my focus was definitely more on you than the pathetic creature who calls himself a man.
But that's not even the best part! I get to snuggle with you, and hold you in my arms, and kiss you, and dance with you, and fall asleep to you, and have babies with you!
See, I think there are probably ways to make it obvious he has our permission without having two idiot Gryffindors attempt to go undercover as well. I just don't think adding us to the mix will make it *less* likely the cover will be blown.
Well, since I was up anyway, I made sure Jaz couldn't let out a single peep, magical or audibly, to wake you up. I just fed her, and you are right, she thinks it's time to party. I had her sitting up in my lap, and put Bear in HER lap, and she did the same thing she did with Romulus and can't seem to stop rubbing the fur and making little humming noises. She's going to be our little animal lover I can tell. Not that the rest of them aren't absolutely in love with our pups, but I think there's something special about how much Jaz seems to love them.
And then came the closet. I thought she was bad when she was tiny, she would pull faces and whine until I picked the right outfit. But now that she can walk, and has enough words to vocalize her displeasure? "No Mumdah, no bwoo" since when does she not want blue? She looks so stinking cute in blue! Hopefully she just wasn't in a blue kind of mood today. I finally managed to get her into a cozy knit sweater dress. But little miss "No, Mumdah, me do" had to do everything herself which of course took twice as long as if she had just let me help her.
"Will you?" She asked, sounding just a tiny bit afraid. "Because I've been feeling off and I just kept telling myself that I'm literally worried sick about Haz healing as quickly as possible, but what if I actually DID catch something?"
Eeek! We leave in two days! I am so ready! It's been ages and ages and ages since we've been on holiday! Or, it's not even been a full three weeks, but it's been a very long three weeks!
So...….. Well, I *may* have had a tiny bit more to do than sit in a tent and wait for the raid to be over.
Ughhhhhhh, that spa. I didn't think I would like it. I don't like being touched by people I don't know and love, but being with you made it ok. And I just felt myself drift into relaxing. It was almost like when I float into subspace. I just felt adrift and floating, but also anchored? I don't think I am making sense, but I think I might be becoming a snob who could live inside of a spa!
All in all, it was one of the best rituals so far, and that's mostly because I *finally* have some bloody energy again! Maybe, just maybe, I'll have the energy to molest you after the twins finish up their 2 AM feeling. If not, maybe *you'll* have the energy to molest me when they wake you up for their 6 AM feeding.
After my shower, I was headed off to the Onsen when I happened to pass by Zwei's room. To my surprise, he was home - as I could hear him talking. I opened the door and poked my head in to ask why he was home when he had his first opening for BabyMetal tonight. But before I could say anything, I realized that he was speaking Japanese and thought he might be talking to one of the girls in the band.
Except for one thing: I absolutely DID NOT want you to think that I had run away for good, or worse, think that I was doing something irrevocable that needed to be stopped. As for that, I probably will consider that in great depth, but for now, I don't want to think about anything, so I ordered that Auror to go call in the usual raid team and get them geared up as soon as possible. I promised to be there as soon as I could, but wanted to take a few minutes to write an email to you so that you can read it and know that I'm not running away from you and I'm not hexing the problem permanently away.
In a few minutes, I'll get up and get our costumes ready to go, and then bring Viona into the shower with me. Unless I decide I want a bath instead. So, because we always call Viona our little Princess, I decided that's what she's going be for her costume. She's going to wear a fluffy pink dress - although I don't think she'll want to wear a heavy gold Tiara, so I'm going to cast a strong illusion charm on her head so that it *looks* like she's wearing a fabulous gold and diamond tiara. Meanwhile, in order to keep with the theme, you and I will be dressed up as Princes. Your costume is white with white and gold embroidery and is simply gorgeous, and mine is a soft shade of gold that has gold embroidery and other gold accents - such as a couple of chains that look like gold pearls hanging from one shoulder to the other. We both have simple little gold circlets to complete the look.
I dropped my head into the palm of my hand, already having a strong feeling of dread as to where this was going.
Considering that it had been a few weeks since she first received the case, I'm sure this was the best news she could have short of literally recovering Penny and returning her to her parents.
I was tired enough that I didn't specify a floo when I came home, and so the Manor spit me out of the floo closest to the three of you. It's always so rare for *my father* to be giggling like a toddler, but then to see him with an arm over your shoulder and you laughing merrily as you slurred: "And then you hit send. Easy Peasy!"
Topping Blaise with his own cock was brilliant! And you were so perfect. Seeing as he knew better than to call you Master again, and how even though I know you friend-love him you didn't tell him how much you love him the way you do to me when I'm the one bottoming, it was so sweet watching you comfort and coach him through it. I think I get what you mean now about enjoying watching my pleasure with someone else because you can focus on every reaction, because watching you comfortingly shush him, tell him he's doing well, and give him updates like "more than half of that shaft is already in you" and "you've taken it all, don't you feel so full sweetheart?" was so bloody hot.
Is there a "mency" that is a mix of Occlumency and Legilimency? I mean, could I project a memory to you, similar to pulling it out for pensieve viewing? While we certainly don't need to parade through each other's minds, it would be nice to be able to share some memories. I'd be interested to see some of our earlier interactions from your perspective. I think it would be better than a pensieve because with Legilimency you can get emotions and hints of thought as well. I'd love to be able to let you feel my emotions when I saw you striding up to our first date!
"Oh love, this isn't the end of the world at all. You're 25 and it's NOT like we're having this conversation when you were still 15. If there's anything this family is good at, it's babies."
That said, insisting that Brogan go home to his family was the right call. I rather like the bloke. He has a charming attitude and is more than willing to make fun of himself for our entertainment, but no matter HOW much he looked at me like I was betraying my best friend in the world, I wanted what was best for him, and honestly, unless he identifies as ace (which he doesn't), letting him hide from the world for the rest of his life is just not healthy in the long-term. So, home he went.
Wow, it's usually you who gets so distracted while typing that you forget you're writing one or forget to hit send. But I got distracted when Sammy got here. I got the kids settled in. And ended up singing some songs and helping pick out the best movie to watch. I got so distracted that you were completely ready to go and for once I had to go get ready while YOU waited for ME! Luckily you had realized this and set out my clothes for me so getting ready was pretty quick for me.
I started beating him over the head with the roses. "SO RATHER THAN ***TELL*** ME THAT ***WE*** ARE GOING TO BE HAVING A BABY, YOU KEPT IT ALL TO YOUR BLOODY SELF!!!"
That is what it's called, right? When a man likes being a man but wants to wear women's clothes. Or wait, I remember another term too, I think. Transvestite? And then that phrase from the Lion King comes to mind where Timon said: "Dress in drag and do the hula." Which brings to mind the term Drag Queen, and so now I'm wondering if these are all the same thing or if they're actually different things, and if so, what exactly is the difference between them. I might have to look them up on the internet when I'm done with this email.
By this point, I'd managed to run to where you were and pull you in my arms. You held onto me and cried into my neck.
So all of this is sort of a long and rambling roundabout way to get to the juicy bits. As Harry stated in his last email, he was excitedly waiting for me to finish getting ready to go out. We were planning to go to an all gay club. As in all gay MEN, as we wanted to avoid the whole women working me up while dancing situation that triggered you just the night before. However, in our experience, clubs dedicated to only gay men tend to be REALLY open sexually. I suppose that once one comes to terms with being a 'sexual deviant' (as some people still describe homosexuality), one becomes open to all sorts of deviances.
Seeing that must have triggered something in you because you promptly filled his mouth. It was then that we noticed that we had a bit of an audience. Another gay couple had arrived after we came into this room, and upon asking if there were any other gay couples visiting that night, were directed toward us. The shorter of the two - a mildly chubby white man who was also brunet - positively *begged* to be allowed to rim you, which I naturally permitted. Meanwhile, die ehefrau commanded ihr ehemann to hoover the other (other other?) gay man.
I am so glad you came clean about having worn a dragon costume to do work at Traditions. Because Hermione sent me an owl roughly 2 minutes after you got there to tell me about it! It would have been so hard to pretend I didn't know! I'm sure you were the handsomest Dragon in all the land! And all teasing aside, I bet it put the kids at ease to have something to giggle about.
"I suppose I'll just watch these babies, or erm, this bloody cheetah actually, as she's trying to lay on me again."
So, getting back to that working theory, it's thought that after she was brought there, they began whatever they were doing to her and she more than likely withstood it for a bit of time, but eventually, she was pushed to the point that her magic activated and she blew the place up. That's the destructive bit that was lethal. The bodies of seven men were found in the rubble, and the first people to respond (basically neighbors rushing over to find out WTF had happened) were utterly shocked to find a relatively unharmed girl in the center of the crater where the house once stood.
Thus, I was left alone in a nice and dim room until - can you guess? Uh-huh, the MEDIWITCH came in to give me a lovely bar of dark chocolate with sea salt and almonds, and a heavenly cup of tea.
Applying one of my better skincare potions to Serenity's face. I was sort of impressed by this, except that she was sort of mixing it with the spa mud to form a sort of goo - that probably would still be rather good for one's skin.
Speaking of rituals! We need to do something to welcome River into our family. It's obviously too late for a naming ceremony, so should we do a welcome ritual like we did for Elena don't you think? We could always wait for a significant date, but we may also want to do it soon so that the Lewises could attend as well if they were interested. Not that they couldn't come back for it if we held it later, but considering the distance it may be easier to plan it around them already being in the country.
Between my emotional state and my exhaustion, I thought maybe I was being ridiculous. I knew eventually you'd "miss me" enough to come drag me back to bed where I belong. I thought you'd at least come searching for the boys. Or maybe you would snuggle up with the kids and I to watch movies. Maybe you'd be interested in visiting the thestrals and you'd find me in the stables.
So, this morning, before I floo'ed the kids back to Hogwarts, I had a conversation with our Haz. When it comes to the crush on Natalie conversation, I pretty much just told her that playing the Slytherin manipulation game with one of her best friends who happens to be her crush *and* her brother's was probably just a recipe for disaster. She must have been running the whole idea in her head all night because she quickly agreed and said she definitely didn't want to hurt her family.
"Yes!" I hissed happily. She handed out the rest of the biscuits first, then took Sunshine from me as she handed me the plate that now only contained my gravy covered one.
Which ended up making Lucius giggle at him. Which was the wrong decision. Narcissa took up where Grandmama left off, and with a voice dripping with honey, almost made your father cry. He was a bit wobbly, and I thought he was about to fall, but as I was watching I realized he kept almost gracefully dropping to his knees in front of her, and then realizing there was an audience and stopping himself. But if you weren't paying attention, it just looked like he was so drunk he could barely stand.
I'm here at movie night at Unity. They haven't started the movie yet so I'm in the office writing to you. Any chance you'll get done with your classes early and I can snuggle up with you? There's a certain snuggly little boy who's ready to climb in our laps, pop his thumb in his mouth, and fall asleep in our arms. How can you possibly want to pass that up? We're watching Big Hero 6! You know how much you love Baymax!
The only time I'm not worrying about you is when I am dealing with the children. That is both a blessing and a curse. Because they seem to be the best at distracting me with terrible crap. Mostly we've been sitting around watching telly, playing outside, and just being lazy. Haz is still healing and I won't be able to concentrate on keeping everyone safe if we went anywhere anyway. But Siri was able to distract me by showing off his "new quidditch move" he had learned. Which ended up being a move he couldn't actually perform which resulted in a broken wrist. Obviously that was an easy enough fix for me. It was a really small break so it was fixed with a quick episkey but still, the damn kid broke his wrist showing off his ill practiced quidditch moves.
Then you broke off the kiss, making me feel a bit woozy and even slightly drunk from your kiss and the sudden removal of it. You really are very brilliant yourself, because you said: "I think it's time to go out to dinner and get some real food in our stomachs."
Yes, I'd love to adopt her. I never thought for a second that I would be allowed to. That *we'd* be allowed to, but since you say that we can, I want to. I mean, I'm never going to let her go back to Unity House for longer than a couple of hours anyway (not that I have anything against Unity House), so why not make it official?
The goal of these fundraisers is to raise a ludicrous amount of money. In years past we’ve had goals of enough to run the House for ___ years. But this time it’s going to be different. We want to raise enough money that each House could theoretically live off the interest/investment income and rarely have to touch the primary amount. There could be additional uses of that money, but an international board will vote on the validity of those uses. Like a small business loan for Unity Royalty trying to open their own business. Or larger renovations and additions to accommodate changes as the world changes.
No child of yours will live a single moment of feeling unwanted, un-cherished, unloved. And the further I dug, the more I realize that I think the both of YOU actually are the ones who want babies with me.
Oh fuck that. His bullshite was enough to get me to stop the stuttering. "That's utter shite and you know it Ron!" he tried arguing back, but I shut him down real quick, "Never once have any of you told me you wanted to get married. Never!"
I know you were a little out of it last night, which was definitely the point, but I think you misconstrued some of my reactions because of it. So now that you're done being all floaty and groggy, with just a hint of soreness to remind you of your lesson, I wanted to explain some of my behaviors and reactions last night.
I figured that all of us would love to wander the enormous nature preserve - or fly over it on a carpet - just seeing all of the elephants. And they apparently have a large population of residents. But just in case I got a tiny bit bored, there's also the Similipal Tiger Reserve in the same park. Actually, I figured that if we like it as much as I think we're going to, we can always book one of their cottages for a later date and come back for a holiday.
Anyway, after I dropped Viona off, I got dressed up in some of my finest robes. I'd received your email saying that Antonio's mother was awake, and so I was tempted to go to St. Mungo's but decided that I would be of better use in the Ministry consulting with our lawyers. As it turns out, I didn't need to use any sort of stalling tactics. Just as the hearing was scheduled to begin, you and a few others walked in. One of which was one of our lawyers, and one was Healer Rowe. You must have asked her to help.
Chuckling because Hannah was clearly on fire with both determination and frustration, I gave her a kiss on the cheek. "Good luck!"
With Russia getting a bit of the glory in creating the first (fantastic) task and Britain getting glory in their Champion being the first one out of the maze, I can see Josette and France feeling like they really need to come out swinging for task two. She seems like a fighter with something to prove. We personally can't wait to see what the next task holds.
I know you're both excited, Draco already trying to pack for a trip he doesn't even know the start date of. Or which location we're going to first. Thankfully, for as big of an event as is being planned, you really don't have long to wait. Less than three weeks actually.
Portia sighed a little sadly, and since she deals with victims of sexual abuse as her job, I'm willing to bet it saddened her that Mahafsoun didn't understand why this situation is a problem. "Listen sweetheart, I know it seems to you like no big deal, but you haven't *recovered* yet. You still think of sex as a tool to use to get what you want."
Now, I can hear you both ready to argue, “Harry, we believe you that Morgana can make it hard to get things done, but why are you blaming Nicolas? He can’t crawl or walk, he can’t even sit up unassisted, how much trouble can he possibly be?”
Hence the fact that they were playing a card game. It was a somewhat childish game called War. There was no betting involved, no exchange of money, and no stripping or dares. They weren't QUITE at that level yet! They *might* have decided to bond by drinking had Harry not been pregnant. With his 11th child, depending on how you wanted to count it.
I mean, I know that I don't run and 'exercise' like you do, but I do usually sneak in at least an hour of dancing with Viona each day, so I *should* be in shape still, but apparently anything more than a sway is beyond me, and it's not necessarily due to my magic/energy drain. I mean, I felt fine at the time. There was no indication that I was overdoing it, but my body literally *ached* after we finished the dance, and I don't like it one bit!
Apparently, Pearl must have floo'ed in last night after we all went to bed. It's so sweet that she wanted to surprise her fiancée by showing up in the middle of the night on her birthday. She likely got in very late, or very early, since they were .... still at it when I walked in this morning.
And that's when I'm pretty sure I mumbled something incoherent because you chuckled a bit and just kept going.
In any case, that means that normally, I'd simply have to dance one or all of them to sleep and then merely keep an eye on them as they slept as I danced and did my own thing for a bit. Except this was most definitely NOT a normal day. It seems that all the kids I had with me were determined to stay awake and enjoy daddy Draco's attention for as long as possible. I had to take turns dancing with them all, only Gabriel being patient enough to wait his turn. Even with elves holding the ones that I didn't have in my arms or tied to me via wrap, it seems that I couldn't even get through an entire song before the ones not in my arms insisted that I give them another turn already.
The best way to do this was to hand him the original plans for Unity Park. These plans included all the designs for construction, not to mention the specific attractions and spells used to make them work, plus a long and detailed account of the budget. I asked him to look over all the designs, and then told him that his first assignment was going to be to find a place in or around Tokyo to build a Unity Park, and then figure out how to adapt and change the plans so that they fit the place and his vision.
First of all, unrelated to today, how DARE his ex-boyfriend out him to his family?!? We can encourage people we love to come out when they're ready. We can show them we're a safe space. We can prove to them that no matter what happens we will continue to be that safe space. But it is never our decision as to how or when someone comes out. Even if they're out to us, it's not our place to out them to the world. I'm furious for him that someone he trusted threw him out of the closet before he was ready.
She tried to sit up and failed. This made her sigh rather morosely. "No... I'm pretty sure that I don't have enough energy for that. I feel so stupid and weak at the moment."
Several people offered to give me a blowjob, and since I'd cast a denial spell on myself, I let them. However, I didn't want to just get off and be done for the night, so I warned them about the denial spell and told them not to be disappointed that they couldn't get me off.
Prior to tonight, I had assumed that you had somehow escaped Iran without any trauma at all. I mean sure, you cried whenever you saw a new child come in, but since you ALWAYS cry, I thought that it helped you cope and not be quite so effected by those poor kids. But after seeing the look in your eyes when we comforted our kids, I realized that you were just as traumatized as the rest of us. Maybe that's why you were so insistent that we go on vacation as soon as possible.
"Stop it!" I commanded in possibly my hardest, sternest, most steely voice. "This is why I hoped you'd elect to stay behind! We CANNOT afford you to waste your magic right now!"
I'm so excited to be heading to Egypt. This might have been one of my favorite locations in our world tour of Unity House building. There really wasn't anything dramatic, the children were pretty much just orphans that would do better in a magical orphanage, very little in the way of abuse or neglect cases. The staff was all excited and hard working. It was a nice change of pace from some of the more stressful builds. It gave us time to spend a ton of time together outside of Unity, we got to sightsee, it felt the most like "home" of any other spot. Like we just put in a hard day's work and then spent the rest of our time like any other regular family.
So I've managed to make it to Friday. I squeezed every drop of business I could fit into the meeting yesterday so that all we have left today is just tying up a few loose ends. That means that I will be home in plenty of time to get ready for our Circle Dinner.
Suddenly, a dog came by and played with the boot for several hours - as far as I could tell. He was a husky that I can only guess had run off from the nearby farm for a bit of a lark. His playing of the boot eventually brought it to a clearly frozen foot in a bit of snow freshly fallen from a small cliff. The foot looked like something had tried to nibble on it at some point in the past.
Wake up you sleepy-head! Our babiest babies are six years old today! I've already brought them their breakfast in bed and now they're waiting on you to get up so we can get to their birthday plans.
Although, I'm certain you know that already, because eventually, you both came to pick me up for dinner, and to be honest, I was probably starving by that point. I simply was so focused on what I was doing that I wasn't paying attention to my own bodily needs. Therefore, when you two arrived, you were allowed to join me in the cave, but rather than join the fray, you simply stood back and surrounded yourself with a wall of fire barrier that would prevent them from going after you.
"Well, let me just find some clothes to pull on and then..." I trailed off as Muffy popped up with the perfect track suit for my morning activities. "Thank you Muffy, you're the best House Elf ever." I pulled on the black with blue contrast outfit and cast a couple of charms to clean and style my hair.
Lucky for us, our three babies are pretty well settled and only seem to get up roughly once per night, sometimes not at all in the case of sweet Morgana. Although it's probably not so much that she is being sweet and more to do with really loving her sleep just like her Daddy Draco. Gabe and Dyl are less likely to sleep the whole night through, whether that's because Dylan can't go very long without wanting to eat, or sometimes Gabriel's brain activity shakes him out of a restful sleep, I'm not completely sure.
Some of the students purred in soft congratulations at that. Then Macmillan and the rest gave their thanks before we encouraged all the students to do so as well. The second version of the ritual, I said more or less the exact same thing, only I worked this in there as well: "And I give thanks that Harry is bloody *brilliant* at shagging and pray that he will continue to be for the rest of our lives."
See the first night when I went into my closet so that I could cast a silencing spell and crucio myself in private, I don't think it fully helped because it was a sort of plaster I put on simply to numb myself enough to get to sleep. The next morning, I was *still* caught up in the emotions of disappointment and failure. I needed to wallow in them for a while, so that when I crucio'd myself the second time - alone in bed with Ben and Jerry - it was able to work the way it usually does, by getting me out of my head and resetting my frame of mind.
For Summer Solstice I have some ideas for you. First, YES let's do an adult's only ritual! I love that you're teaching this younger generation about important rituals in our heritage. But, while we've been able to keep the rituals wholesome while staying true to the traditional aspects, it would be nice to not have to be so "clean" during the rituals. Let's just host it at the Manor.
Pansy yawned, looking utterly shagged out by that point, but still awake. "I'll cast monitoring charms on the both of you and put a stop to it if either of you is seriously injured."
MEANING that I can actually talk to the kids and tell them as much as I want on the subject. Well, actually, I could do that anyway as I am not actually a Professor, but what I mean is that if I wanted to be a guest Professor for the day, I could make sure every student in this school knows everything I can possibly teach them.
You turned to leave, but I grabbed your arm to stop you. "Don't allow this to enrage you enough to put our babies at even the slightest risk. There is NO bloody sense in wasting your magic and potentially harming two children when we've already rescued a beautiful little girl that WILL have a good future - once she's had therapy and recovered from her trauma."
When the girls started nodding off, we tucked them into the bed in their room, and then we added Spain to our list of countries we've shagged in ... twice. Have I mentioned how happy I am that your libido has made its triumphant return?
I wasn't nervous that they would say no. I mean, I KNEW Luna wouldn't say no. And I didn't think Neville would say no. But what if he had? It was really important to me that he be Harrison's Godfather. But what if he was offended that we waited until our fourth child to ask him to be Godfather? I know, Haz is our sixth, but seeing as we didn't pick Godparents for Lainie or River, he's our fourth that needed godparents. What if he was offended that we asked him but didn't ask Charlie to be the other? Especially since we were asking Luna for a second time.
"There is no medical reason to move any of them right now, no." More glaring, but this time at Rowe. "But I've already said that if it's something you both feel is the right choice later on, now that you know the risks, I would be willing to do the procedure."
Here's the deal, their fashions are going to be aimed at teens and preteens. Pretty much Hogwarts age plus a few years younger and a few years older. They are going to open the show with a few of their "models" coming out in Hogwarts uniform robes, and then at the end of the runway they are going to drop the robe and show off the outfits underneath. Kind of a "you have to wear the uniform but you can look fabulous underneath" and a transition into "as soon as classes are done for the day, you'll be ready to look your best." Which I think is a super cool idea.
You took a play from my book and didn't give her a second to recover before kneeling between her legs and slamming your cock into her. I could hear how sopping wet she was from where Blaise and I were watching. Ron took that opportunity to put his cock near your mouth and you wasted no time in sucking him. Blaise gave me a nudge, "He needs the entire trio, go join them." So while you were bent to pound into 'Mione and reach Ron all at the same time, it gave me such nice access to your arse. I started rimming you just like you like, then grabbed the lube Blaise handed me, and prepped you well enough not to hurt, but I couldn't wait very long. When I slid home I leaned to whisper in your ear, "I love you Draco. Merlin! Look at you! You've got your cock inside of Hermione Granger, I bet she's all warm and wet and tight huh? Is it just what you wanted it to be? Oh wait, you can't answer me because your mouth is full of Ronald Weasley's cock, you never imagined that did you? Oh, I bet you did. I bet you couldn't even admit to yourself that you wanted this. And your husband Harry Not-Potter is balls deep in your tight arse." You could not stop moaning around Ron's shaft. I kept pounding you from behind which made you slam into Hermione harder and harder.
Once inside the funeral home, the priest took his time setting things up - sterilizing instruments and the like - before starting on the initial, relatively harmless, 'pretty' parts of the ordeal. The parts where he removes excess fat in 'problem areas' and corrects those things that are considered flaws. It seems he likes to start with the 'real' things before moving onto the 'creative' things.
The Traditions are doing much better. But that is due to most of the countries having funding in place for education. Because they are schools, they qualify for quite a bit of money. Needing to rely on very few donations or fundraisers. They are more likely to need fundraising for “updating magi-tech to enhance learning” as opposed to the Unity Houses which are trying to “pay their staff.”
Both of them were shocked and as excited as you can make a couple of teenaged boys; they pretended to not care, but I'd catch them smiling to themselves every time I turned away. I even saw Zwei petting the little dragon figurine I put onto his tray.
Are you ready for movie night? Tonight is Alice in Wonderland. I haven’t seen this one, Hermione says it’s quite imaginative and fun. But I’ve read some reviews and most people think it’s a bit trippy.
"AND I managed to convince the Dark Lord for YEARS that I was loyal to him, when the ENTIRE TIME I was loyal to Dumbledore above everyone else!"
That is to say, Adult Competitors in front of a LARGE paying audience. During a single weekend or week - as opposed to one event every couple of months, which I always thought was kind of stupid too, to be honest.
So are we going to spend the entire weekend in your grandmama's cottage or did you make some plans for while we are there? I am so excited either way. I'm looking forward to this hotspring, is it similar to the onsen?
Speaking of exorcise, tonight is the night that Mlungisi has prepared the burial ritual for. It's actually rather nice, there's going to be a feast featuring goat. Zaire is actually very excited to see and eat the traditional feast food here. Plus beer. But don't worry, it's a simple and not very alcoholic beer.
Chrissie and I are up to about the 40th chapter or so, and so while I probably *won't* be posting 4 times a day like I did with Oi Potter (because I don't actually know how long we're going to go on for and I don't want to post it all at once and then miss it, you know?), I've decided that I'm just a little impatient to get y'all caught up on the plot, lol. I mean where we're at right now is *so good* and y'all are so far behind, lol. So, I'm going to post 4 times today so that you at least get something juicier than was already posted :-D
So when you wake up I am going to shag you rotten, then we should grab some breakfast (or lunch, you are such a late sleeper!) and then we should go see The Mummy. That's one of the movies I suggested before, the one set in Egypt in the 1920's. Then we should come back here and shag some more.  What? Can't a guy have a one-track mind on his honeymoon? Fine, we don't have to shag, I will just practice my Dragon riding skills! You're lucky I'm persistent, can you imagine if I had given up the first time you turned me down for a date?
You're surprised that an email that was going to be about how excited you are about our son turning twenty ended up being two hours of you blubbering on about our children? Have you met yourself? If anything, I'm surprised that you only went on for two hours. Did you have a pressing case you were working on or something? How did you manage to limit yourself? Inquiring minds want to know!
He and I swapped back and forth, seemingly with no pattern as to who was spanking when and where. You were letting out cries and moans that were so sweet. I'm sure my stiff prick was poking into your chest. After a while, Oliver mentioned that your own was poking him in the thigh. Sometimes your punishments are just a release, and other times they make you hard as a rock. This was obviously the latter.
As the night got darker and the stars in the sky more brilliant, we started on the fire and poi dances - teaching the students to cast safety spells and giving them tips on how to do the dances without risks of burns in the first place. When the bonfire looked like it was dying down - and thus midnight must be approaching - we decided it was time to get around to the closing ritual in which we built up energy and power. I actually performed a visually stunning poi dance with Parvati during this, both of us leading everyone else in the chanting. When ready, we encouraged everyone to shout as loudly as they wanted their thanks and blessings.
You are also brilliant when it comes to names. I'll admit that because we didn't know genders before, I wasn't really interested in names, but now that we KNOW we're having at least one daughter, seeing Morgana Guinevere Malfoy written out like that is sheer perfection. I love it and will accept nothing less for Baby A.
While you were chatting, I walked away because I just wanted to have a fun lovely afternoon and not think about your class. I walked towards the changing rooms, thinking I might catch Ori before he heads in with his team. Well, technically I saw him before he went in, but I did not approach him.
"What?" I asked defensively, willing to play along until he was ready to listen again. "I've got my cleanser, my pore reducer, my toner, my moisturizer, and lastly, a cream that's a bit like a shield to make sure that nothing can harm my skin."
"Exactly sweetheart, he was ignorant," attempting to stay as calm as possible because our sweet little crusader was getting worked up, "ignorant means uneducated about something. He learned that nonsense rhetoric from somewhere. What's going to make him see the truth, that your Dad and I are just the same as any other dorky adults; continuing to be ourselves and proving that we are kind and loving people, or punching him in the mouth?"
At some point early on, I caught you and gave you about ten minutes worth of kisses before whispering in your ear that - if you were SERIOUS about me playing as a woman - I actually sort of wanted to shag Dean and Seamus. I mean that it's been ages since we've played with them, and I know you like having a pair of Gryffindors to play with because you all have this sort of base knowledge that includes inside jokes and that makes the experience so much more interesting for you.
I may be a bit biased, but I am pretty sure you are (tied with your older brothers and sisters) the most beautiful baby I've ever seen. When you're wrapped up and sleepy in your lilac blankie that Grandma Molly knitted for you, with your little hat Grandma Iris made for you, the only thing peeking out your gorgeous little face, you are a miniature version of your Daddy Oliver. That straight mouth that gives soft bemused smiles is the exact same. Those eyebrows that I'm sure will be a language all their own. Even the shape of your eyelashes up against your rosy little cheeks, exactly the vision I see when I wake before Daddy.
No, these kids were asking real questions about political discord within the muggle world. They talked about their fears for the planet due to pollution and climate changes. The rampant inequality in the world; be it based on class, gender, race, sexuality, you name it. They wanted my take on how we as wizards and witches could help promote change without completely outing our society. They were angry and ready to take on the world while still maintaining a childlike innocence and wanting to think the adults have it all figured out.
Ron laughed and patted you on the back. "No worries mate. I'm not trying to take him from you, I just remembered that it has been a LONG time since the last play night. I'm sort of tempted to invite us over for the night and race you to your play room."
P.S. We can get through this. I love you more than anything else in the world. Whatever your choice, my love for you is endless.
Wendy even speculates on the possible Hero Complex by saying that it's not surprising if he has some of the signs of that complex as his biggest rolemodels are the type to do whatever it takes to help those in need. (Ugh, she's talking about us, isn't she? Sigh...)
Luna arrived a bit later with her posse - her husband Rolf, their girlfriend Hayley, their boyfriend Hector, and their girlfriend Janna (pronounced Yanna, from Sweden). Almost immediately, Pippa (who I hadn't realized was there until that point, but it makes sense since she's practically my shadow, following me everywhere I go), defected to their side of the table and started flirting with all of them. I'm not sure how I feel about MY assistant (ours, whatever) joining Luna's posse.
Cut to the following morning and River was all talk about having their entire suite to himself, it was so great, he slept like a baby, etcetera. But then he brought up the completely logical argument about the waste of funds for him to have an entire suite to himself. Wouldn't it make more sense if he just joined us all? We could expand the bed to fit all of them. And he supposes it might be kind of fun to have a kind of slumber party all together. So by night number five, I had all five of our kids I brought on this trip in bed with me.
"I guess that depends on what the rest of the kids want for dinner," you murmured, resting your head on my shoulder.
Although, I will admit that you might have a point about my unconsciously and unintentionally being slightly more accepting of River's antics because he reminds me of my own. But please try to understand that just because I am doing my best to not freak out, it doesn't mean that I'm not freaking out in my head. I was not joking when I said I want to lock him in a tower guarded by a dragon until he's married.
P.S. Our lawyers are coming over tomorrow with all the necessary paperwork. That said, I suppose I may have forgotten to specifically mention it, but when I signed all those papers officially giving me full custody of River, one of them was giving you equal status as my husband. It's not exactly the same as adoption, as I understand it, more like acknowledging the fact that as my husband, you are his other parent - sort of the same thing as would happen if we each had a bunch of kids separately and then got married. The kids would legally be all of ours together. I can't explain it any better than that, so if you have questions, ask our lawyers when they get here.
"Well now you're just being bloody naïve!" Dad roared. "Oh sure, we'd have those with enough brains to suck up to us like leaches for any bit of magical help we are willing to give, but even if 90 percent of muggles were on our side, that remaining 10 percent would secretly hunt us all down and murder us in cold blood, and don't think for a second they wouldn't!"
Rolling my shoulders and sort of hopping for a moment, I got into the right frame of mind and ordered her to brace herself against the wall. I expected her to respond to each stroke of the whip with a color to let me know how she was feeling. If she was good and ready for more, green. If she was not sure or needed a moment to take a breath, yellow. If she definitely needed me to stop, red. Once that was agreed to, I began the whipping.
"Thanks love!" I replied with a grin, kissing first you, and then Oliver before leading the dancer back onto the floor. And even though you SAID you were going to dance with Oliver, I caught the both of you just standing there watching me for quite some time before actually dancing.
FYI: fun fact, when I wrote Draco's tantrum, I was actually on my period, so after I sent Chrissie the email, I told her to describe Draco wearing comfy period clothes, lmao ^_^
The only other thing I have to explain to you at this point is what happened after I brought her home and left her in Hazel and Pearl's care (for that bath). See... I was rather... snarly...
I have most definitely been enjoying our time as a couple, our time with the kids, our dancing or running times, and certainly enjoying our visits to the playroom. Again, I know I'm not where I need to be, but I am already feeling so much better than I was even just a few days ago.
When you said that the magical cameras are still out there, my first thought was how excited I was to not have to miss some of those moments. And then I thought about how many times we've had sex out on the Manor grounds. So .... who takes care of going through those pictures? Maybe we should get to them before oh, I don't know, your mother gets to them? But I bet if they caught any that we look fantastic. Nothing but your gorgeous pale skin, my darker skin, and lush green grass. Maybe they caught you with your head thrown back when you do that growling thing right before you start speeding up? Or caught us staring into each others eyes? Um, I know you'll be here at 4:00 but it's um, been a while since we've utilized my desk to its full potential and we could ....
You're just sitting there on the other chair staring at me like you're waiting for me to say something. Well I sure as hell wish I could. I can't. I tried. I open my mouth and nothing comes out except for my sobs escaping and a weird, shrill, noise. It certainly isn't English, and not parsel either. Hey, maybe I speak a new language, I can name it, I'm thinking "broken shell of a man"-ese.
"NO! MINE! MINE!" Morgana screeched, making all the glass shatter - which I cast a large shield to protect us all from.
Gods I needed last night. I thought I needed to discuss my worries, think about all the reasons those two could have been there, analyze every single moment of the entire interaction. No, what I needed was my gorgeous men coming and distracting me from my worry.
Muffy was once again the smartest elf in all of creation as she made me a cup of extra strong tea, waited patiently for me to drink it (by this point, you and Oliver had already used the loo and pulled on the first things you'd found - which I actually think was your dirty laundry from yesterday, but at least it wasn't ratty and ragged denims from 20 years ago), and then when I seemed marginally more awake, handed me an utterly delicious smoothie for me to drink as I worked.
Harry chuckled and sent a grin at Pippa. “I think Draco would appreciate it if you contacted her and set up an appointment for him to meet with her to discuss something important.”
I probably COULD go on and on about it, but I've decided to simply focus on my favorite part. My father daughter song and dance with Shtara. As you both well know, she has one of the best voices on the planet, and we are so bloody privileged that she serenades us with it regularly, but even better, she seems to think that us singing with her is even better. Thus, even though it's a song she has sang TO us many a time, she and I had a lovely waltz as we sang Tomorrow. First, in the more original style in which it's a bit of a power ballad.
And with that, I decided to go to my office and make sure there wasn't any lingering paperwork I needed to complete or sign off on. There was, but it was minor and mostly reports from my handlers and those that had to watch the feed from the camera contacts. I just had to read over them and verify that all the information was correct. After that, I was hungry, so I went to Café Exquis to grab a bite and write this email. But don't worry, I'm about to return home and I'm bringing all your favorites with me so that EVERYONE can enjoy food from our favorite restaurant.
"Of course Mutt, why don't we get you all set up. You stay on your knees and breathe for me while I get what we need."
P.P.S. I already sent word to Aya that her services will be very necessary once we check into our hotel room in London, and when she's done massaging us, she can make a bit of extra money if she wants by massaging everyone else, haha.
Or, I suppose, since this is a muggle hospital maybe I would be of some use? I could go in there and magically heal anything, the healers ... or Doctors ... can't do without magic. However, the fact that our beloved Minister for Magic herself Hermione is in there probably means there is enough magical power in there to help anything a team of doctors can't accomplish. She may not be as powerful magically as me but she is a million times smarter to even things out.
But, I will not be giving my virginity to anyone else while I am there. I probably would have if we weren't together, but knowing that I can have you? Why would I want anyone else?  As long as you don't laugh at me for having no idea what to do, I think it will be wonderful. I do agree that learning about yourself first is a good idea, but I can do some of that without other people.  I um, have been doing a lot lot lot of "research" and am pretty confident that I know what I at least want to try. And even if you only ever wanted vanilla sex? I would be ok with that too. And on the subject of top vs bottom? I'm not saying that I wouldn't ever top if you wanted to occasionally switch, but the ... item ... I bought and used let me know that bottoming is definitely something I enjoy. I don't plan on getting carried away with anyone other than my new best rubber friend.
I also think that she's assuming that she's far more healed than she is because with the healing spells and potions, she has far less swelling and pain than the typical M2F patient. She probably FEELS fully healed, or damn close to it, so she doesn't realize that these things take time - even with magic. And... did you notice that she apparently cast one of the temporary breast enhancement spells? Or did she ACTUALLY manage to grow a good two cup sizes overnight?
Then the sliding glass door between the game room and the second floor balcony shattered. THAT'S when I realized what was going on.
I have to keep myself occupied. I have to think of other things. Such as those missing files I was planning to tell you about. Robards checked and found that there ARE other files missing. Yes, yours is one of them, and your file is ALSO highly classified, and so, if it hadn't been stolen, it wouldn't be accessed by nearly anyone.
You were of course the sexiest of pirates. I still can't get enough of you. I kept wanting to drag you to the nearest cupboard and have my wicked way with you. Or to the dining table and spread you out like a feast just for me. And I'm really glad you admitted your outfit was pirate-esque and I didn't have to deal with you being angry with me, transforming into your marmoset, and biting me.
The Halloween party at Unity house was adorable. A bunch of kids in highly creative costumes is strangely my cup of tea. Or perhaps not so strangely, hahaha!
But you are still asleep, and writing all of this has made me horny as hell. I'm going to come wake you up and show you how thankful I am for last night.
But I'm in bed now waiting for your flight to finally arrive, so I'm going to sign off and take a nap in the hopes that you'll just wake me up in the best way when you get home.
Speaking of my parents, do you know how long before they are far enough in the adoption process that they can bring Della home?
Again, a wall of suits and robes ready to be worn. Ready for our young men to put on so they could watch their fathers and grandfathers (and sons since all three dads were in there as well!) get married. My heart was so full of love for this group.
After returning to our quarters, we basically had the weekend to do nothing but wait for classes to begin on Monday, except, well, you wanted to fine tune your lesson plans, and the problem was that you were trying to stick close to a more 'acceptable' lesson plan when what you really wanted was a more 'informal' one. After discussing it practically to death, you finally agreed with me and Oliver that your style is going to be just as valuable - and perhaps more so - than the previous Professor's.
I'm sorry you had to go through all of that reliving Jacob's last moments. It sounds like it really took quite a toll on you. I hate that it was at the expense of my husband's emotions, but I'm so relieved to know that his parents will have the closure they've been needing for twenty-five years. I have no idea how I would manage the loss of one of our children, but I can't even begin to imagine the horror in always wondering what happened and where they were if I just didn't know for twenty-five years.
River said he was hungry enough that he wanted to head over to the buffet room while the rest of us were still more than happy to swim or lounge. It can take a while to eat, so none of us really thought anything of it when he was still gone an hour later. It was about a half hour after that that I thought it might be a good idea to go find him.
Even after three hours of talking, your group still wasn't back yet, so I took her back to the girls. Where they talked about fashion, played with Bear and Venus, talked about their businesses, and the older girls talked about how much they were looking forward to Hogwarts on Wednesday. She had a blast.
I got out of bed and was perfectly content getting dressed and ready, except when I went into the loo to do a bit of business, you were in the tub with the five littlest and Caelum was wailing. I know we have spells on the tub so that none of them can drown, and I also know that their elves were on hand to help out if needed, but just HEARING him crying again, *already,* pushed all the wrong buttons.
I've not set it in stone or anything but I think I am going to do my actual performance to Aerosmith's "Crazy" It just speaks to me!
P.S. Is Traditions like Hogwarts in that it has final exams the first week of June and then basically holds the students hostage for the next two weeks until the results are in and all final House points are awarded (not to mention the House Cup), or does Traditions recognize the fact that these are *young* children (except for the squibs) and probably should be let out of school a bit sooner. In other words, how long until our Elena is off for summer hols?
Once I finish this email and actually go do the inspection, they've planned out a pre-opening event for the families of the team, our family, and a select group of others (such as most of the people involved in the various businesses I'm part owner of and their families). That means that on next Friday, October 1st, we'll get a chance to walk around your newest business and soak it all in. We'll have our kids with us, so straight away, they'll be tested on how family friendly the place really is, hahahaha!
I rubbed my temples. "Which would completely explain why the curse didn't care that there was already a womb full of child in there." I sighed, took a long gulp of milk, and then finished up. "It's also why - when we used the Curse again - during our play night - that I got pregnant yet once more... with YOUR child."
"BECAUSE THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SAFE PLACE FOR ME AND MY KIDS, AND YET *YOU'RE* ALLOWED TO JUST FLOO IN!!!"
P.S. By the way, I noticed that you accidentally knocked my picture off the wall and moved it to my closet, but don't worry, I put it back where it belongs.
Personally, if I were you two, the moment all the littles go down for their nap, I'd slip off to the playroom and make up for the fact that I only let you get each other off once last night. Unless you can't slip away from Unity, Harry. In which case, maybe Oliver and/or I will have a chance to pop in under your desk before you come home.
You know, it's one of those parent things to say "I hope you end up with a child just like you!" and I don't exactly have parents to say that to me. But I really do think I have earned every last impulsive thing our children do. I think maybe I should send Molly some extra flowers as an apology for what I put her through between my antics and dragging Ron along with me. I should probably send a nice bouquet to Minnie as well.
You got to hold our babies for a few hours before you fell asleep. You'd also decided that there would be no visitors (aside from my parents for about two minutes) because you wanted me to be the first other person to see our babies. And besides, I obviously needed my rest.
This places McGonagall in a hard position because while Miles could naturally stay at Hogwarts during every Holiday except the summer one - were he not pregnant - he only has one year left before he'd graduate and have to find a new place to live anyway. Then add a baby into the mix and it doesn't look good for poor Miles.
I love you, I MISSED you (or rather me, I suppose), and I can't wait to see you both after classes are over.
Damn you Draco! Since I read your email I have been going back and forth over whether or not to tell you about what I already planned for our anniversary. I had kind of been hoping your brain fog had extended just a bit and you would forget long enough that I would be able to surprise you! I booked a villa in Tuscany for all of us. Our anniversary is on a Monday, so we will leave the Thursday evening before, and head home in the afternoon on the day after our anniversary. And I made sure to book one big enough, because we are bringing your parents (and brother and sister obviously). They will be on their side, and we will be on ours, and they will watch all of the children while we do small dates throughout the entire weekend! This way we get away, we get to celebrate alone, but we never have to be away from the babies for longer than a few hours at a time.
I love the idea of having Elena have private dance tutoring. Music, dance, or performance in general are her passion. As long as she doesn't feel as though she has to be perfect, and as long as she's doing this for herself and not to please us, what's the harm in nurturing her passions? Are you going to hire a general dance tutor or specific masters in different types of dance? I actually think it would be super cool to have a dance instructor who can teach her some traditional Spanish dances. I hated growing up knowing nothing of my heritage, trying to figure out why I was black haired and golden skinned in a family of blondes, I think it would be neat for her to have a chance to learn something of her biological background. Especially since our sweet girl already has a penchant for big twirly skirts that she can dance boldly in!
I glared at him because he might just have hit my ONE nerve on this subject. I took a deep breath and stared him in the eyes as I thought this over. To my relief, he wasn't hiding anything sinister - and I would have known because his mind was such a disorganized mess that I don't think he could have hidden guilt over sneaking a biscuit - much less an actual secret.
Otherwise, well, I AM overdue for this year's summer cold. Maybe I'm coming down with the dragon flu.
Even as I was saying this, Toshiro was already in a group comprised of Gabriel, Dylan, and the Feisties. Atreyu and Nora were so excited that they were chattering in their native languages again. At the same time, Orion was asking Toshiro questions in Japanese, such as could he speak English.
"Did you give him a potion to make him love you? Or maybe a potion to make him turn gay and want to be with you?"
I nodded in understanding. You practically ran to the bathroom, and I took the time to write this email - mostly to organize my thoughts and decide how to explain things to you, but you've been in there far longer than it usually takes you to take a shower, so I'm going to sign off now and go check on you.
That's probably why I woke up this morning in such a good mood! I had a nice flight, I'm feeling well rested, and excited to get on with this first tour stop. Today we are all just getting the house ready to be really livable, relaxing a bit, and trying to fix any jet lag issues we may have crop up. But tomorrow, bright and early, I am off to Unity South Africa! I can't wait to introduce our children to this first of our spin-offs. Have them all play together, help out. Eeeeeek! I can't wait!
His eyes got a bit melty and watery all at once. "We're... We're going to have a baby that's all three of ours?"
Oliver looked like he was silently chanting a prayer to summon patience. "I wasn't here for that, but as I understand it, you both had a playdate with some friends of yours in which YOU wanted to be cursed into a woman for the night - s! Nights! It was two separate nights a couple of weeks apart. And because the curse to turn you into a woman had some potent side effects, you got pregnant both times. Once was with Harry, and that's this little angel Gabriel. And the other was with Dean - a bloke we all went to school with, back in the day. And that was AFTER you'd gone undercover by polyjuicing into a 15 year old girl who was a prostitute and gotten up the duff while working. I'm not explaining this very well..." He muttered at the look on my face.
So here are my thoughts on why I was ok letting the photographer use our images. I have very little control over being something "journalists" think is worth reporting on. As long as they're not libelous, there's not much I can do if they want to put me on the cover of the Prophet pantsless. But these are pictures I knew were being taken, I was prepared for, and I have control over how they're used. Even something as simple as asking her not to publicly use any of the grass skirt pictures she was willing to compromise on. And, just like we were willing to send one photo to the Prophet in the hopes that giving them one shot would keep them from hounding us in the hopes of getting pictures, perhaps having more pictures that we love out in the world will be less that get taken without our permission.
On top of being human, you are also a wizard. A wizard who has known since the womb that magic was his life and his birthright. You knew what magic was before you had a word for it. You have lived and breathed spell work for all of your thirty-eight years. Asking you to stop using magic and expecting it to happen instantly with no slip-ups is unrealistic. Thirty-eight years of near-constant magic, stopping cold turkey would be like asking you to stop breathing.
And being your good mutt? I always love being leashed, but it actually being used as a leash and not just for show? Unghhhhh. No. Words. And thank you so much for letting me touch you. I love being bound, but I do NOT like the absence of touch, either you touching me or me touching you. Thank you for casting the spell, there is no way I could have kept myself from coming for you!
The *funniest* thing that has happened all week was when I went to the loo and my wee lit the toilet on fire - this Dragon flu can be insane! (You do NOT want to know what happened when I, erm, nevermind.)
P.S. Alright, I'll admit it, I took Siri and Zwei out riding those dirk bikes you gave them for their birthday (now that I have one of my own) and they're rather fun. Definitely a lot less alarming than I thought they'd be. You are the best father for our children ever, I'm glad I chose you!
I'd better make this quick, we had a full day at Dudley and Donna's, and you said you had to get a few things ready before we begin our shopping spree. I knew I'd have at least a little time to write since it normally takes you quite a while to get ready, but we are also headed to shop so you may speed through the readying process to get shopping sooner.
Actually, I think you’re absolutely right, I didn’t believe you enough and I deserve every bit of your threatened punishment. Being forced to be tied up and shagged senseless alongside my bloody fit partner in crime by our insanely gorgeous husband … sounds terrible but I can’t argue that we really, REALLY deserve it!
"How is the Auror going to be DOING the job? Can't very well just have a random girl show up asking to work for this nasty pimp," Auror Ramsey pointed out.
I had a little free time earlier after your parents came for Della and before we got the news about Alric, and I got you a surprise! Well, I didn't get it for you but I scheduled it for you. I was getting lost in my own head and thinking of my tattoo I want, and now I am already trying to come up with another piece I can do for our children that will look complete but will be able to have children added as they are born or adopted. And then I remembered my bubble, so I contacted my library and she said that I am a no-go for tattoos right now. However, since you won't be limited until Friday at the earliest, I made us an appointment with Neil! If you're not ready for it, that's ok and it can just be a consult, but if you're ready for it you can have your dragon chasing its snitch before this week is over!
I know that you cared for the whole family while I was in St. Mungo's due to my own stupidity. My own stupid actions, I might add, that wouldn't have come up if you weren't hell bent on pretending to be an Auror while being pregnant with twins. I may have used up too much magic, but I wouldn't have been potentially killed if the raid went sideways. But no, I have to realize my own choices got me landed on hospital bedrest, my own choices forced me to be without my family for a month, my own choices caused me to be so sick I thought I was going to die and may have wished for it once or twice. I'll be gut wrenchingly honest with you and tell you if Persephone's life hadn't also been in my hands I probably would have ended it all.
"Well... it's more like I've managed to persuade his long-term Partner to let us send someone undercover as him in order to dig up whatever dirt we can. The problem is that the lover is half loyal to him still and doesn't want to just tell us things outright - despite being irate he was cheated on (the criminal doesn't know he knows about that) - AND part of it is that the lover literally CAN'T talk about certain things, having made an unbreakable vow."
Then I took up where you left off. "We gather today to bless these children, new lives that became part of our world. We gather to give names to these children. To call something by name is to give it power, and today we give these children that gift. We welcome them into our hearts and lives and bless them with names of their own."
I have changed my mind, we will not be firing Pippa. She's an integral cog in the Malfoy machine. As I'm sure you're aware, these pregnancy hormones have me wanting to impale myself on you and not let you go for the next eight months. Even with everything crazy going on in our lives, you have been able to attend business meetings and maintain some semblance of higher brain function. All I can concentrate on is you.
I know it was probably beyond surreal to receive an official memo like that from me via the Inter-teacher notification system, but I had a girl insist that she had to talk to me right away and concurrently, needed to be excused from your class to do so. I thought she was just, I dunno, not feeling like class today - which I'll admit is strange because the students all LOVE your class, but in any case, I was wrong.
The awesome thing about this pregnancy though is your magic is still holding nice and stable. Getting you on the magic booster and the blood potions preemptively seems to have really done the trick. I suppose the fact that you've (knock wood) not had a single episode where you felt the need to go to the crystal room and all of your current projects taking up your time are magic free have been helpful in that regard as well.
"I'm sure," I murmured with an amused smile. "I had to have special training when I became Head Auror for a bit so that I could apprehend criminals as needed without attracting attention from muggles." I lied so that he didn't realize that all he had to do was go to Africa and learn wandless magic there.
As you know, Friday late afternoon we sent Shtara off for her Friday night performance, we brought all of the kids (and Sirius) to Hogwarts where we exchanged them for Viona so we could have dinner together in Hogsmeade and talk Wedding Prep. Our kids are pretty well behaved and used to business talk, party prep, and other conversations happening at a dinner table, but I had the feeling Viona was going to have a LOT to talk about and didn't need all the little ones bored or chiming in where The Princess may not appreciate their assistance.
I laughed even as you had your face buried in my neck. "Sirius! Calm down, my mother doesn't want you to skip dinner, she simply wants to have a good laugh over this."
Then Zaire just so happened to return at the same time that Jaz and Vani were coming back for lunch.
However, I could think any of them were unbelievably attractive and I promise you, you never ever ever have to worry about me playing around with anyone behind your back. First of all, you are enough for me. Secondly, why in the name of Magic would I ever have to experiment behind your back, when we discuss everything and I wouldn't actually have to hide anything since you like the idea of me being with others WAY more than I am actually interested in it?
How did your chat with Hazel go? It's a bit silly, when she was using her upcoming surgery as manipulative ammunition to get you to say yes to her party idea she wasn't actually worried about it. It was all part of her creative form of getting her way. I wish she actually had something she was trying to talk us into now, it would be so much easier to deal with than actual worry. I'd give her just about anything she'd want if I could just take the worry out of those beautiful eyes.
The next few evenings will consist of Hannah, Officer Edwards, and me going over everything we can discover about that man. Prior to now, I've been home in time for dinner and a few snuggles with the kids before having to go to bed early. Tonight I will be late (I'm writing this from Hannah's office where we're working now that our daily show is over for the afternoon), because we need to know everything the is to know about that man as soon as possible. If he's the killer, Hannah is determined to find proof and arrest him before he can kill anyone else.
She was scrutinizing every millimeter of the rather plain envelope, but it held no clues other than an indeterminate return address. Curious, but also looking rather suspicious, she opened the envelope and pulled out a rather fancy and ornate looking invitation. She barely had time to speed read it when she was already gasping and squealing, leaping out of her seat (good thing Eric was holding Luka) and running around the room while pumping her fists in the air.
After a while I heard a mix of "Boy!" and "Mutt!" being said. Ooh, one of those is me! I went crawling over to your side and laid my head on your lap, Charlie doing the same to Neville, both of you clipping our leads to our collars. Then we were both getting our scratches behind the ears. Calming down from our playtime gave me the chance to look around at what else was happening. Not only were both Charlie and I out of breath, but both yours and Neville's laps were quite tented and Charlie was rock hard, which made me realize how hard I was. Once I remembered, it was so hard it almost hurt. I started whining a bit, which made you pull on me a bit, "Oi Mutt! Be good!" So I let out a small apology bark (wow, I have an apology bark, weird) and started licking your hand.
So, I decided to keep up the blood potions. So far all of my symptoms have been around for three or four days, and besides the dehydration, they've been more or less annoying as opposed to dangerous. Last night the sweating and the peeing seem to have disappeared and today's symptom is again just annoying so that's left me pretty hopeful. I can't stop crying. And not emotionally where I can't stop crying because I'm sad, my eyes are literally leaking. Super weird and annoying, but definitely something I can handle.
I've already had a few requests to have your mum and/or Molly to come along. Since this one's dedication is mostly to them, they thought it would be nice to have at least one segment with them.
My first question - as I'm sure your first question will probably be and McGonagall's first question was - was *why* in Merlin's malodorous sphincter would anyone drink an unknown potion from a cabinet that could very easily contain deadly brews?!?! Well, it seems that Slughorn had mentioned that over the years, students had an alarming habit of breaking into his cabinet and stealing the potentially deadly potions to threaten each other with. Such as: "Do my homework for me or I'll feed your cat this Daught of Living Death!" SO, he replaced all the deadly and grievously harmful potions with firewhiskey dyed to look like the correct potions. Thus making his cabinet safe except for since he mentioned THAT to his students, they now break in in an attempt to drink the firewhiskey.
