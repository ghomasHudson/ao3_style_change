know something about that! I didn’t think you did!”
After briefly losing himself on the wrong level of the airport, he emerged onto the pavement outside, where the rumble of automobiles reverberated.
Harry was fairly sure that was the tea that smelled like old socks. “That’s— I think I’ll be fine later, but thank you.”
“May I have one of these?” he said. “As a pint.”
Malfoy didn’t say anything aloud, only raised a skeptical eyebrow and waved his wand while still chewing on a mouthful of bread. The clothes immediately sagged on Harry.
Malfoy stares back at Harry with wide eyes, mouth slack.
A few moments later, Potter shifted restlessly and added, “And I, er, don’t have any other bodily needs.”
When Harry bangs into the court, there is an echoing silence, then a hissing chorus of whispers.
Luna shook her head. “No, it wouldn’t be best. We need a number of people to take them down and put them back up again safely. I’d rather not risk a fire.”
It was loads of fun, but it left Harry with a hell of a headache to nurse alone the following morning. He was relieved when Hermione and Ron came over in the evening for a quieter get-together.
Harry Apparated to the alley Ginny had taken him to on his first visit to Portland. He walked past all of the coffeehouses and bookshops and the pet shop with the rhinestone collars in its window. He didn’t stop at any of them, but he did walk slowly enough to take in the ambience (and not at all because he was nervous).
He plunges into the memory headlong.
By which Harry understands Malfoy means that Harry is the no one and Malfoy is the exception. Harry only smiles wanly in acknowledgment of the hit. He doesn’t mind it just now, because Malfoy is standing in his kitchen drinking tea like a civil person and talking about his lost research.
He found Luna by the barn. “Good morning, Harry!” she said. She waved her wand, and the half dozen buckets hovering behind her lined themselves up on the ground next to her. “Did you sleep well?”
“Right. It goes like this.” Malfoy raised his wand and made a smooth movement. “
“Do it, Potter.”
“I’m back in the field,” he admits, and at her shift in expression, hastily adds, “For a case that shouldn’t involve any heavy casting.”
A breeze streamed over the hill, catching in Luna’s hair, making the tender new leaves whisper.
Neither he nor Malfoy said anything. Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that Malfoy was staring at him, but he knew Malfoy was only looking past him through the window.
A gull laughed, and they parted. Malfoy blinked, looking as surprised and confused as Harry felt.
Harry turns cold eyes to Malfoy. “You, then? I bet you’re dying to have a go at me.”
“Yeah, probably,” Harry said.
Harry sighs. “The curse messed up my magical core. It was all tangled up with my organs, so my magic was strangling me. The healers disentangled it from most everything but my lungs. They couldn’t get that bit free without outright killing me. So now my magical core is wound up with my lungs, and that’s the way it will stay.”
This was one consequence of finishing work on the house: Harry had nothing left to do. It gave him an uncomfortable feeling, an itch under his skin that wouldn’t go away.
I do,” he said, a little too vehemently.
“Er…”
“You’re already mad!”
She rolled her eyes in a very Hermione expression that had not changed in twenty years. “Because. For one thing, you’d go mad. You’re a very active person.”
He closed his hand around Malfoy’s cock. “Is this what you want?” Harry whispered.
Luna was already in the kitchen, pouring a glass of cucumber water.
Draco rubbed his quill between his fingers. Of course, the true limiting factor—time—was one for which Potter could not reimburse him. Draco would be entering his busiest season, with stock to move and the garden to plant and early spring flowers to harvest and process.
“At home. She had things to do, but she’s looking forward to seeing you. Merlin knows why.”
“That’s— That’s true.”
Malfoy crossed his arms. “How magnanimous of you.”
Eventually, they made their way back onto the motorway.
“Oh. That’s a nice thought. But I thought I might see some more of the city. You know.”
“So we are.” He curled his fingers against Malfoy’s palms. “I don’t want to go.”
Well, he
Cafe. Restaurant. Art gallery. Clothes. Comics. Coffee shop. A garden shop selling books. A metaphysical shop selling books. Restaurant. Doughnuts. Cafe. Puzzles and games. And books.
“Do you really not remember?” Harry asks. His voice is hoarse, low. His face heats at the sound of it.
Harry shook his head “no.”
“Wait,” Harry says, gripping the banister and leaning forward. “What are you talking about? Malfoy, what are you saying?”
Hills glances at him. “We have your permission to search upstairs?”
And not breathing, is the silent implication.
He felt uncomfortable mentioning his relative wealth in front of them, especially Ron, but Ron only shrugged and said, “That’s a good point.”
“Harry?” Draco whispered, and touched a hand to Harry’s cheek.
“I hear you got put on the Malfoy case,” Alex says.
“Not bad. They used dark meat this time, and they added rosemary. I’ve made better puff pastry, but this is passable. A bit heavy-handed on the cooking wine, though. I daresay this is a drunken chicken. They’ve got a different chef today.”
Eventually, Malfoy met Harry’s gaze. Like he’d finally deigned to notice him.
“Mmm,” Malfoy hummed. His hand brushed over Harry’s side—Harry shivered from the touch—and traveled down, over his balls, to his cock. “Wow. You’re really hard for it.”
one he’d reasonably be seeking from Records.
The image haunts Harry all the way back to his hospital room, which is still made up for him, he notes with chagrin.
Harry’s brain was still stuck on the thought of Arthur here—in Oregon, and in Draco Malfoy’s house. Arthur here, barely containing his excitement while Malfoy drawled on. And Molly, gawping around Malfoy’s kitchen.
“Sorry I fell asleep,” he says at last.
Harry picked up the bag and followed Ginny. She carried two more identical bags. He glanced inside of his.
Draco Malfoy, in front of him. Draco Malfoy, in the Ministry’s holding cells, caught in a bust on the potion ring they’d been hunting for months.
It ends on Harry moving around his house, restless, waiting for news. That scene has a disconcerting echo to it, being as it happened so recently. Does he really look that pasty and unkempt?
here, bitch?” Ginny said.
is what matters, ultimately.
question Malfoy, not interrogate him—and certainly not to break his occlumency walls.
As exhausting as the speaking engagements are, they give him a feeling of strength and hope—he feels something long asleep stir within him. The fighting spirit. A sense of purpose and justice.
“Resent me.”
“I can’t sit, either,” Potter said, apologetically. “At least not properly on furniture.”
, Potter?”
“You seemed interested in the pictures of Thor’s Well and Haystack Rock.”
“That won’t be my fault,” Harry says, breathing over Draco’s skin, and Draco shivers.
“You heard me.”
Potter eyed him. “I was getting bored sitting in the kitchen. So I came out here. Did you do all this? The birds are singing. It’s beautiful. And you have pets.”
“So I’m going to put you to work.” He clapped his hands. “Chop-chop. Eat up. And drink your coffee. You’ll need it. Lunch rush soon.”
Harry frowned and stopped at something he noticed on one of the windows. A silvery line with a star, like an asterisk, at its end. It stood up vertically, and it gleamed with different colors, like the shimmer of oil on water. “What does that symbol mean? There’s one on your door, as well. It looks like a wand. Is it for wizarding establishments?”
“Tsk. Ron. Harry, you’re not going to be a barista.” She said it in the same tone Molly used when telling George,
At one point, Sophie wandered over to praise Harry’s charm-work. He also complimented Malfoy (who was wearing a grey newsie cap at the time), which pleased Harry but also made him bristle.
“Is Malfoy going to brew it?”
, read the words on the window.
“We’ve hosted some,” she said over her shoulder, already disappearing inside.
Maybe he should have ordered the Hindsight 20/20 beer or at least the Prince(ess) Charming one so he could charmingly deflect the attention. But he still had some of the Daydream Doppelbock in his system, and he wasn’t keen on seeing how it mixed with another effect. Not in public, not with Malfoy sitting across from him and Parkinson looking at him like a shark.
obliviated. They don’t have enough yet to prove that the obliviated memories have to do with his research surrounding Poesy, or that any of that terrible monologue of his was artificial.”
” Just that. He couldn’t finish the word.
But he shakes his head. That’s madness. He’ll stop by Malfoy’s tomorrow, show him the case file. Malfoy can tell him if there’s anything more Harry can do. And if not—then, well, that’s it.
“No, Potter. I’ll be by myself. My mother is on the continent. But no one needs to know that.” There is an outright speculative look on Malfoy’s face now. And all right. That’s enough.
“I’m sure it’s not what you wanted to hear,” Hermione says.
The next morning, Luna was waiting for him in the kitchen with her hair pulled into a series of plaits and tied beneath a scarf.
With shaking hands, he folds the paper and places it on a shelf nearby.
He looked back at the etching, trying not to be aware of how
” Malfoy straightened the car out and threw an irate look at Harry.
“Did you and Malfoy have sex?”
Harry could feel an apology lodged deep inside of him, but the words wouldn’t come out. It wasn’t the right time. It wasn’t what Malfoy needed right now.
Malfoy pulled out his wand and wordlessly banished Harry’s clothes. Harry yelped. His hands flew to his crotch to cover himself, but his dick was standing up, and his fingers knocked against it. A jolt of pleasure and shock went through him. His head spun—from the blood rush, from the alcohol.
Abruptly: “I am going into the kitchen for a minute. If I leave you there, will you stay? Don’t run off in a fit.”
“Hm?”
A little while later, Draco whispers, “Stay tonight?” and Harry hums in approval. “Good,” Draco says.
“I guess.”
“Something is going on with my latest case,” he says slowly, “and I don’t know what to make of it.”
“Are you going to try to help me?”
disappointing.
And anyway. It just surprised Harry. It wasn’t like he was crying into his coffee over thoughts of poor forgotten Malfoy.
sure what had happened, but it had been good. Very, very good. Possibly one of the best things ever to have happened to him. And it had been with Malfoy.
“I wondered if I was imagining this.”
“Really, it’s fine, Malfoy,” Harry said, some minutes later.
At that, they all four fell into a silence.
“No. Nothing that you’re able to provide, in any case. Have a nice walk. Or, hover, as it were.”
“Yes. Our year. Slytherin. Little pug nose.”
Him bracketing Ginny’s body, his dick soft, Ginny frustrated and furious. “Ginny, it’s not—”
Harry had never been so thoroughly mortified in his life. Even when he lived with the Dursleys, he’d never felt so completely squashed. He was nauseous and he hated Malfoy, except he couldn’t hate Malfoy.
Harry wrinkled his nose. He wanted to tell her that a car ride was nearly as bad, though it wasn’t, really—except he did feel uneasy hurtling down this side of the street, not that he would admit it to Ginny.
Hands shaking, Harry folded the letter and returned it to the chest. He cast his own ward over it, then went downstairs and had a glass of Firewhiskey.
“Looks like a fine young rowan tree you have here.”
“Is this what you want? For me to fuck your tight hole like this?” he whispered roughly at Draco’s ear. He was driving into Draco, his hips slapping against Draco’s arse with every thrust. The headboard knocked against the wall, and Harry spared a brief thought for their neighbors, if they had any.
“Shush. I—”
“How’d the interview go with Malfoy?”
Malfoy’s eyes glint like steel. “You’d love that, Potter.”
He and Malfoy walked down a long switch-back trail through trees and past scrubby dune plants, down, down to the level of the rocks. They picked their way across a landscape that looked like it had been crafted by an eccentric magical artist rather than nature. Harry could feel the craggy points of the rock through the soles of his trainers. Water had gathered in the shallow depressions in the rock. Barnacles and mussels and little green sea anemones nestled under the crystalline surface.
They search Malfoy’s bedroom and then the guest room whose white sheets are still rumpled from Harry leaping out of them. It may be his imagination, but he thinks Hills pauses for a moment at the sight. But it could be that Harry is just worried and oversensitive.
Mostly.
With that, he left the kitchen. He paused before the front door, remembered the weather, and pulled on his jacket and the boots charmed against water. He grabbed his basket and the umbrella. He would have preferred an umbrella charm or an
On the first floor, the door to Malfoy’s study stands open. The light is off.
Harry forced a laugh. “That’d be the day.”
He wandered into the kitchen but couldn’t eat. An agitated energy slid between his flesh and bone. Harry felt like he’d separate.
“Just as bracing as ever.”
“Uh, that’s all right Luna. I think I’ll pass, thanks.”
“I did,” she said. “For the most part. I liked my team. I liked flying. I liked playing. But I spent a lot of time away during training, which was a lot of the year. And when we weren’t training, we were traveling for games. The Portkey lag sucked balls. I missed home. I missed Luna.”
When Harry was done, he Scourgified his fingers and waited for Malfoy to finish his own cone. A lone cloud moved across the sky, which was so
The photo of Malfoy continues to frown at him, the steel grey eyes unblinking. Harry’s own eyes begin to water from staring so long, until he gives in and blinks, himself, and slips the photo into the inside pocket of his robes.
“I don’t know. I was thinking of working full-time with Luna on the farm. We never have enough help. But we’re lucky to break even with farm costs and revenue. For anything else, we need another source of income. I was originally thinking of maybe opening a training camp here permanently. Hence the shed. But the college was looking for someone, and a permanent training camp would have meant a lot of people and a lot of noise for most of the year.”
Malfoy is right, of course. Who is Harry to steal attention from him and his work? Only, Harry hadn’t been thinking about it that way when he went to the press the day before. He’d been thinking—well, apparently he hadn’t been thinking at all. He just…he thought it was about the
“That’d be— I didn’t quite catch the gist of it. Would you mind showing me again?”
“I’ll renovate Grimmauld,” Harry said to Hermione.
“We’re sorry,” Chesterfield said when he appeared in the holding compound. “We would have called, except they were already leaving and—”
“I am still looking for the right shadowing opportunity for you,” Luna told him.
At last, they reached what looked like a dead end. But then Malfoy turned down a narrow, nearly hidden path, this one marked with potholes.
to know it was one of the little pink eggs. His heart plummeted.
Flinty eyes stare back at him. Harry gets the message loud and clear.
“I mean, yeah. I enjoyed doing it alongside Bill, but I wouldn’t exactly want to do it full time.”
Harry balked; for an instant, he thought the implausible was happening, that he’d overestimated his own ability. He sensed a flash of consternation, a feeling that came with such an impression of Malfoy rolling his eyes that Harry could practically see it, and then the tight packet of memories opened like a flower, petals all coming apart and surrounding Harry.
“I don’t know what you’re talking about,” Malfoy said, flipping the page of the menu.
Hills turns steady eyes onto Bate. “Would seem so. Potter.” He gives Harry a slow nod. Harry can’t be sure, but he reads a somber respect in the gaze, and maybe something else. An acknowledgment, an unspoken “be careful.”
“What?”
Harry grins. This time he doesn’t say the words out loud.
Harry pulled his gaze away from Malfoy. There, hanging from the wall, were a number of small, framed etchings.
In the sitting room, the curtains have been tied back, and bright sunlight fills the space. Harry activates the table’s extension charm, and it dutifully expands. Harry thinks it
one kinky bastard.” He flipped a page. “Does Hermione know what you do to her collection when she’s not looking?”
Harry hadn’t spent much time imagining what Ginny and Luna’s home would look like, really, so he shouldn’t have had any expectations—except he must have had something in mind, because the house surprised him. It wasn’t nearly as old as he’d expected. Not old at all, really—and nowhere near as patchily put-together as the Burrow. It had two stories and an attached garage, and was half-consumed by vines and flowers. A large tree leaned over the whole thing, shading it from the summer sun.
“Malfoy?”
“The door opened for us, and no one answered when we called, so we thought we’d come in,” she says.
“What?”
“You’re welcome.” The bastard has got a small smile on his face.
“Draco is in auror custody. He confessed to creating the squib compound.”
“No prawn toast!”
Did he plan to begin courting this season?
But she hadn’t smiled. She furrowed her brow and hugged her arms to her chest. “We’re here for you. Don’t stay locked up forever. It’s not good.”
Harry refrained from asking, and only nodded along as Malfoy talked about finding the right flavor balance and roasting the coffee evenly (because something about
Malfoy considered Harry’s handful of books, nodded, and added them to his own short stack.
The problem was that neither of them had any idea how to make a popup book, magical or muggle. They enlisted Luna’s help and soon had several prototypes. Those helped, though making the actual book had still been a learning curve; the quality from the beginning to the end of the book differed noticeably. Thankfully, Harry doubted Teddy would care—or even notice. He had an eight-year-old’s delight for all things fun and colorful and enchanted.
He loved Rosemary and Heather like his own quirky, loving aunts—much preferable to his
Harry couldn’t see any reason not to, and Malfoy was watching, so he took a drink. “That’s. Some kind of fruit. And…I have no idea what that is. Something spicy.”
“And you should do it.”
“Get on the bed,” he whispered.
Harry says, “He’s a researcher. He’s been looking into the effects of the byproducts they dump into the water supply. Seems they might turn magical babies into squibs.”
was the visitor here, not Parkinson. Though she’d been traveling, she was a part of this family that Ginny and Luna and Malfoy had made in America, just the way Harry had his own life back in England: Hermione and Ron and Teddy and Andromeda. And Grimmauld Place, which needed him to fix it up.
Harry cracked the cover off of his paper bowl of chowder. It steamed in the cool seaside air. It was good—full of dense, soft chunks of potato. The smoked tuna was meaty, almost creamy. But the sourdough, while all right, was not as good as Malfoy’s, Harry was inexplicably pleased to notice.
,” at his back.
Actually, Harry wasn’t sure why it hadn’t occurred to him to leave England, himself. Albeit for the opposite reason as Malfoy: to leave behind the adoring fans and the requests for appearances. Although, was it really so different? Unwanted attention was unwanted attention. For the first time since encountering him here, Harry felt some kinship with Malfoy. It was an odd, unexpected feeling.
Lifting his head, Malfoy licked over Harry’s collarbone, his throat, the corner of his jaw.
avada kedavra
check in on him. Circe. With Robards in a snit and someone out to get Malfoy, anything else could have happened today, and Harry would have no idea. And Hermione said Malfoy hasn’t replied to any of her owls today.
“Exactly. Except you’ve been moping all evening.”
door.” He jabs a finger at a closed door a few feet away. “That’s the only other door you are allowed through. And I mean that literally. There’s a locking charm on your own, if you can think to activate it. It’s your own problem if you can’t manage it. If you need anything else, shout.” Malfoy gives an owlish blink. “It’ll be in vain, but I’d be entertained.”
Her eyes are sad, her mouth tight. “I mean you haven’t been happy working in the office, and field work is too dangerous for you.”
“It’s fine, Hermione. I’ll check on him.”
Harry glanced around. He spotted a pair of trainers on a little rack near the door. He Summoned them. “These yours?”
Bate, leaning against the door jamb behind Harry, says, “And what exactly is your relationship with Mr. Malfoy,
“Very manly,” Ginny said in a deep voice.
“Malfoy?” Harry called. He let the door close behind him.
Healer Catherine squeezes his hand and lets it go.
The road curved and wound its way into the hills, where trees pressed close, making a green tunnel. Ginny cracked the windows, and the smell of pine wafted in. They passed through a small town with a single petrol station and one short stretch of old buildings. “Vacuum Repair” said one shop front. “Stationery” said another.
Draco snorted softly. “Makes me nostalgic for the evening, never mind the reality upstairs. The kitchen is a disaster.”
“When you die,” Draco finished for him dryly. Then, in warning: “It’s the same as it’s always been. Nothing’s changed.”
Harry listens and nods, bemused, and Malfoy occasionally throws him a wry look, like he knows Harry is only humoring him, but he keeps up the stream of conversation anyway. The truth is, Harry likes the sound of him talking. When he isn’t sharpening his voice to cut glass, or twisting it to throw petty insults, it’s quite pleasant. Deep with maturity and almost lyrical.
Harry felt a strange sense of disconnection and discomfort. Probably mostly due to the Portkey and the time difference. But it was also the way the landscape struck him as familiar and different at the same time. It was Ginny’s familiar presence beside him, but the fact that they were in a car, and she wasn’t his same Ginny. She’d changed over the years, little things. Just enough that it didn’t sit quite right in his stomach. He didn’t miss Grimmauld, per se, or even London. But he felt out of place. He missed the Burrow; he missed not feeling this sense of displacement.
Harry Potter stood on his doorstep. Broader in the shoulder than Draco remembered, with scruff roughening his cheeks and chin, hair just as wild as ever, dressed in maroon auror robes.
Edward grinned at him. “Too early yet. Though she’d have been happy to see you. You’re all she’s been talking about these last few days.”
“It’s a lot of books,” Malfoy said, “but I promise they won’t hurt you.”
a good one,” Charlie said, with a grin.
“Ham and egg sandwich, no eggs. And a brulee coffee,” the waitress said, and Harry gave a little jump.
“No, I—” Harry musters a scowl. “I’m here on my own account.”
“I think he went down to the forest,” Luna said.
At last, they released the magic, and the paper cutouts flattened to the page. Harry dropped his arms. The awareness of his fatigue rolled over him: sore muscles, tight shoulders, the beginnings of a headache.
Harry feels like a real prick, but he can’t go back right now. Maybe if it were just Hermione, but he can’t apologize in front of Malfoy. Maybe it’s childish of him, but he can’t. He’ll wait till later, when Hermione is sure to be home, and he’ll visit her there when they’ve both had time to calm down. It’s been a while since he’s seen Ron, anyway. Harry isn’t even sure how much Hermione has told Ron about this case or her involvement. She must have told him something; she’s been spending so much time at Malfoy’s recently, she has to have. With a pang, he realizes where Hermione must have been over the weekend: with her family. Of course.
He has her full attention once more. He’s hot under the collar and doubting he should have said anything at all. Quickly, he says, “But I was wondering. Have you ever found yourself on the wrong side, when you thought you were on the right side?”
There was still a slight gap between the coats in the cupboard, where he usually pushed between them. Inside the room, the clock he’d moved to the chest of drawers was still where he’d put it.
“It’s a perfectly acceptable wand core. It’s a very popular core, in fact.”
“You liked that one. It goes good with the sour beer,” Ginny said.
Harry still feels wrong-footed with the shock of facing a man, not the boy. He nearly takes a step back, but sets his jaw and leans forward.
Malfoy sat at the edge of his own seat, hands folded and thumbs twirling, staring at Harry. It was off-putting.
The short green and golden grass was dotted with little mounds of…something. He walked up to one. It looked as if a small pile of dark brown soil had been covered with stones, leaves, and sticks, forming a vaguely chaotic, vaguely aesthetic pattern.
“Excuse me?”
“A non-magical hatter would have to reshape a felt hat with steam, but we’ve got charms,” Sophie told Harry.
The corners of Malfoy’s lips turned up. “Well. I was thinking of starting by sucking you off. As long as you’re not opposed?”
The hostess led them to a booth. Harry didn’t want to admit that it was…well, a restaurant, and maybe not worth the hassle. Although he
whispered Draco.
“Between you and Malfoy.” She glanced at him. “You dork. Grab that and let’s get going.”
The croissant was delicious—flaky and moist—but Harry had trouble swallowing his next bite. His stomach twisted, and for a moment, he wondered if the food didn’t agree with it.
At last, the paper fell away to reveal the book inside.
, and past-Malfoy is praising her strategic thinking.
The night felt alive around Harry. Vast. Cold and warm currents of air streamed past him. A bat darted in and out of view above. Harry darted, too, feeling fleet and free.
A breeze carried scents of warm sweet grass to him. For a minute, he considered taking flight. He took the broom from where it leaned in the corner, but a moment later, he set it back. It would be rude to leave Luna and Ginny without telling them, although probably neither of them would be surprised.
Hermione pursed her lips but said no more on the subject.
“Hi, Draco,” Luna said, leaning in for a hug. To Harry’s surprise, Malfoy broke into a genuine smile and folded her into his arms.
“Yes. But you can hardly tell the real truth if your memories have been wiped and replaced.”
After the tour and lecture, she directed Harry to attend the small, everyday tasks: checking the temperature and pressure in the barrels, sanitizing the equipment, running cooling and heating charms, adding carbonation to the barrels that would be served soon in the taproom, pulling moisture from the steam so the humidity didn’t get too high in the building. Once he got the hang of it, it was pretty automatic work for Harry, and he didn’t mind it. But he was relieved when Charlie called him over to a counter at the side of the brew space, thanked him for his help, and offered him a taste-testing session to round out his experience.
He pauses halfway to the sitting room door, his muscles vibrating. He turns his head not quite far enough to look over his shoulder.
A minute passed. Malfoy opened the door, buttoned up in a crisp white shirt.
potion while pursuing
Harry hissed and stopped holding himself up with his elbows, let himself lie flat on the ground. Draco unzipped Harry’s jeans, and— He slid his hands over Harry’s hips to the floor. And smirked.
The ordinary magical patrol supplied most of the personnel for the surveillance, but since the auror ranks were smaller, even the interoffice collaboration didn’t ease the strain on their department. Cases were piling up. The few auror teams on unrelated investigations were beginning to grumble about their workloads.
This was how Harry found himself going through stacks of aging scrolls, monographs, and journals. The smell of old paper reminded Harry of going through Grimmauld Place. Harry had to spend more time with these—unpeeling nearly-transparent sheets of parchment, unfurling brittle scrolls carefully (“Want to see a murderous librarian? Break one of those”), and deciphering the looping script of ancient wizards. He sat in the aisle near Malfoy, tapping his foot against the floor until Malfoy snapped, “Will you
Harry felt like this should mean something. What should this mean? He stared into his bottle for a few moments, but no answer was forthcoming, so he shrugged and took another drink of cider.
It all plays out around them, including Harry’s compulsive cooking for Malfoy and even Harry’s sleepless nights over the weekend as he worried about the hearing. (How had those ended up in the pensieve?) His shock that the hearing had been postponed, his anger that Hermione and Malfoy hadn’t told him about the postponement, him sitting alone in his house with shaking hands.
Luna slung the bag she’d brought onto a large flat rock that looked nearly like a table. Harry spotted other clues that she visited the spot often: a wilted chain of wildflowers, a metal trough of water that bubbled gently, a single wooden chair, depressions in the ground where large bodies had lain recently. From the bag, she pulled several large hunks of meat and began distributing them to the Thestrals. They waited in a loose semicircle, watching intently but motionlessly until they were thrown a portion.
Vaguely, Draco realized he almost
But he didn’t stop thinking about Malfoy.
read, correct?”
Malfoy sniffed. “I love my shop. But I spend enough time in it. No. I thought I’d give you a tour of the kitchen.”
“Uh…”
“Well?” Harry says.
It struck Harry that Luna had said this was Malfoy’s favorite room. Which…was unexpected and absurd, wasn’t it? Peculiar. Out of character? Or maybe not.
Draco muttered to himself. “Fucking hell, Potter. You’re like a child. Nothing has changed. Bloody-minded arse.”
The letters were all nestled inside, as if a month hadn’t passed. Harry ran a finger along them. Pulled one out at random.
“What of it?” Potter asked, sullenly, dragging his gaze up from the wand to Draco’s face.
Harry isn’t sure what to do with that. So he just gathers himself for the last fall from pride. “Malfoy. You’re doing incredibly important work. More—more than I’ve ever done, myself.”
“I was under the impression that’s what we were doing. What, pray tell, were you under the impression this interaction entailed?”
“By all means,” Malfoy said, waving a hand.
Harry spits into the sink.
Draco swallowed his scalding tea and snapped, “Will you
“Oh, yes. I’ve visited every other bakery in the city, and most of the coffee shops. There’s only one that makes croissants better than mine, but don’t ask me which one, because I won’t tell you.”
Harry’s grin widened. Maybe he did.
He opens his mouth, but he can’t say the words. He knows his face is turning terribly red, and even in the flickering light of the fire, it must be obvious.
“I did. But even so.”
“Next month,” Harry sighs.
“What, without telling you? Never,” he said, and ignored Ginny’s snort. He looked around the patio. The sun shone through the leaves of the vines spilling around them, and a butterfly fluttered past. “Beautiful afternoon. What’s for dinner? Should I get anything from the garden?”
Draco was beautiful—hair wild, a sheen of sweat making him glow. Harry projected the image back to Draco, who shuddered and showed him his own image of Harry—wanton, spread open in every way, flushed and hair curling. His desire reverberated with Harry’s own, combining into a frequency that threatened to shatter them.
She casts a disillusionment charm on them both in order to avoid the press, who are having a field day. Harry is relieved Malfoy was escorted separately to the Ministry’s jail, bypassing all of these vultures.
“What? No. What do you mean ‘cleaned out’?”
they were having sex. Perhaps it was some kind of glorious torture.
“Yes, I’ve heard of them. I’ve even been in one or two.”
“Malfoy,” he says slowly. “Would you like to stay in the guest room?”
He wished he had someone to talk with. At moments like these, he missed Snape with an awful pang, the miserable bastard. He could ask his potions mastery mentor for advice, but he didn’t want to admit he was working on another project, not after receiving the three-month warning from him. And his mother was out of the question.
Malfoy, taking a sip of an iced drink, choked.
“Minister Shacklebolt, if I may interject. Mr. Potter is too sick,” a member of the Wizengamot says.
Charlie laughed. “It does! Our Brewmaster’s Beer is a marvel, but also a bit like us shooting ourselves in the foot. Since guests can taste the quality in our brews, we have another incentive to do things right. So we use fresh berries for the Princess Charming and preserve them in stasis for some limited release runs when they’re out of season.”
“How, indeed. Honestly, I weep for our country.”
Then Ron is at his bedside, clasping Harry’s hand in both of his. Tired blue eyes look down at him.
Most importantly, Harry and Draco had had fun working on it. All of these years later, Harry still liked working with Draco: on a case, in the field, at home, on secret Christmas heirlooms. He especially liked witnessing Draco in his element, working on potions or on magical artifacts, like this one. Draco made a certain face. He was making it now: lips pursed and eyes narrowed as he focused on the 24th, blank, page.
“You have magical artifacts in your shop.”
Normally, the alcohol infusion would take far longer to sit—several weeks, at least—but Draco had a spell for quickening it, and what the muggles didn’t know wouldn’t hurt them (or break the Statute). He didn’t always rush the infusion process, but something at the back of his mind had nagged at him until he did.
Malfoy came over as Harry was just finishing up the scone. He carried a coffee cup in one hand. With the other, he held out Harry’s card.
“Is that it, then?” After hours spent in Luna’s library that morning, and the relatively long walk to the library, this seemed rather simple.
“Come on,” Malfoy said, with an expression Harry couldn’t quite read, but made his stomach heat. “They’re upstairs in my bedroom.”
They lobbed ideas back and forth across the table until they were all laughing easily and uncontrollably, even Malfoy, whose shoulders shook. And that made Harry pause, which made Malfoy stop, as well.
“Getting an eyeful?” Malfoy sneered.
For a moment, Harry blanked. He stared at Malfoy, who was smirking. Then he remembered why he was here. “Well. I actually told Luna I’d be helping you in the coffee shop today. So if she asks, could you tell her…? You know. I don’t want to disappoint her.”
“We’re not
“Come in. To what do I owe this pleasure?”
He spent another minute staring at the parchment, trying to pick up his train of thought. Then he sighed. “Here. This is what I have so far.”
“Well, that’s a mess!” Edward said cheerfully, regarding the brown liquid slicking the path.
He heats water in the kettle and puts on a pot of chamomile tea. Sits with it in his pyjama bottoms. He stares at the mirror on the table, the scatter of notes left by Hermione, the Ministry letter at its corner. He doesn’t go through any of it. Just stares.
“Scatologist!”
The lift doors open. He doesn’t head toward the floos.
Wary, cautious, Harry settles cross-legged on the rug. The fire is warm against Harry’s side, the air near the hearth tangy with smoke. Malfoy calls a deck to his hand. To Harry’s slight surprise, the cards are bent, well-worn, and a bit singed.
“So did you get good research done? Will Hermione be able to help you?” Harry asks as he steps from the last stair to the ground floor.
“Yes, thanks.” Although it really wasn’t. Harry looked down at himself, at his loose jeans and the worn button-down, and felt…drab. He had the urge to ask Malfoy to change them again, but he couldn’t bring himself to give Malfoy (with his skeptical eyebrow raising) the gratification.
The second time Harry approaches the cottage, he’s holding a piece of parchment.
“Fuck you, Malfoy.” Though Harry laughs, despite himself. He covers his face. Groans. “Oh, my god. You weren’t supposed to see
it. He wanted to— And he wanted Malfoy to be the first one to do it.
Robards throws down a pile of records. “That.”
For an established potions master, the resources required to develop new formulas were worth it. A successful new formula could sustain a potion master’s practice for several years, financing the development of yet more potions. But Draco, being a journeyman, didn’t have the license—or, frankly, the time—to develop his own line of potions. The common draughts he sold via owl order helped offset some of the costs of his studies, but not all.
“Semantics.” Malfoy unbuttoned one of his cuffs and began to roll the sleeve up. “Have you ever baked bread, Potter?”
Harry thought Malfoy might sit down to go through the books as Luna had, but he cast a Privacy Charm over the table before taking Harry to another aisle.
All the while, he staunchly ignored the crawling sensation of being watched that itched over his shoulders. Twice, he refrained from snapping at Potter to stop staring at him. By the time he sat down with his steaming bowl of soup and cheese, Draco realized he had another problem.
Bate looks around incredulously, as if he can’t believe his partner is just going to ignore the fact that Harry is standing against the banister in his bare feet. Then, realizing his partner is already disappearing down the hall with Malfoy, he follows after them with one last glare at Harry.
It was a nice location. If Harry were a tree, he would be happy there: overlooking the house and its gardens in one direction, the fields in another, the forest in another. The sun shone down. A wind moved through their group, stirring the little lacy white flowers.
Just as Ron had promised, the entire Weasley clan descended upon Grimmauld Place within a day of Harry’s return. Bill cleared the curses, Arthur calmed the enchanted furniture, and Molly attacked the kitchen and rooms with a volley of Cleaning Charms and ferocious intent.
Harry shrugs. He could say “it’s not your fault,” but he doesn’t. It wouldn’t be a lie, but it wouldn’t be the truth.
you like manhandling things.”
“It’s nice, isn’t it? We were so excited when it opened a few years ago. They have outside seating on the other side with a small rose test garden. Did you get to see it?”
“Prat,” Harry said, and couldn’t help the fondness in his voice. “You’re fine.”
Leaves the drawing room. Closes the doors for good measure.
Malfoy licked him again, again. Then he used his whole mouth to
, he was going to add. The idea had been forming in his mind since—well, since Hermione had made the suggestion during her call. Though he had been seriously considering it since their trip to the coast, and it had solidified during lunch earlier.
Malfoy up to?
Malfoy snorted and glanced at it, then slipped it into his own pocket. “Come on, then.” He waved at the person behind the counter, who glanced up from flipping through books to beam and wave back. The flock of birds burst across their face, dodging around their smile.
“Good,” Draco said, then frowned as Harry’s knee began to bounce again.
in your own space, where you won’t terrorize the muggles and, more importantly, where I don’t need to encounter you every time I want tea.”
“And that’s the last step to making non-magical beer,” Charlie said. “Once it’s carbonated, it’s ready for the taproom. But we only serve a couple of non-magical varieties. Most of our customers come for our
And when he realizes it, it hits him with the force of a bludger.
Harry returns to the bottom floor of the cottage. For some reason he can’t explain, he walks past the kitchen down a short hall Harry hasn’t explored before. Malfoy led Hills and Bate here when they visited and he took them to the pantry.
“So why do you want to renovate Grimmauld Place?”
“That’s all right. She must have just been sitting on it. But she won’t miss it for long. She’ll lay another, that’s all.”
from the Ministry. It isn’t forged. He hadn’t really believed it at the time, and he can’t deny it now.
Harry is trying to place why he seems familiar when the man turns just enough to recognize his features from last night’s Internet search.
, whose umbrella-like leaves glistened with beads of water from the last rain. It was a spitting image of its cousin, the
Ginny was too busy laughing. Luna craned her neck to read the label. “That’s the special herbal beer.”
From the nearest rack, Harry picked up a container of creme fraiche and looked at it.
Malfoy shot him an accusing look. “Have you eaten yet?”
It wasn’t like Harry was disappointed for Malfoy. Merlin forbid. Only, he was…surprised, that was all. Surprised, because he knew the intelligence behind those haughty eyes, and Malfoy was… Well, by anyone’s standards, Malfoy was striking. The pointed features somehow suited him in adulthood. The grey eyes and white blond hair were eye-catching and rare. You didn’t forget him, that was for sure.
“An ounce of tact. You’ve absorbed that much in a decade. And just used it all up in one go.”
“Malfoy,” he said, to hear it out loud.
They take a plate of shortbread biscuits to the sitting room. Malfoy stokes the fire and serves the biscuits with little cups of coffee. When that’s done, he produces a small tray of cheese and apricots and serves
Strong hands grasped Harry’s shoulders. He thought Draco was pushing him away, and he
“Fun?”
“Over here!” the voice said from beyond one of the cases.
Harry looks down at his soiled shirt and the damp patches on the knees of his jeans. “I was out in the garden.”
Harry frowned and pushed his free hand into his pocket. “So why baking? Some deep-seated need to take your frustrations out on something that won’t hit back?”
“Yep.”
After he was through choking, he pushed aside the soup bowl; he needed a short break from it. He tore a piece from his bread and tossed it to the gulls.
The words, tickling at the nape of his neck, were nearly his undoing.
Malfoy lifted two fingers. At least his nonverbal communication was intact.
Why didn’t he check the guest registry at the security desk before he left the Ministry? He would have evidence that the CEO of Poesy had actually been there. (Though when he told Hermione, she pointed out that the man had as much right as anyone else to visit the Ministry and could have been there on any kind of business. And even if he
“Yes,” Malfoy said.
A long silence passed. When Harry thought he might have control over his voice, he said, “Luna?”
“Yes,” he says immediately, though his face heats as he realizes everything he may feel compelled to spill.
“And?”
“Yell really loudly.”
Malfoy rolled his eyes. Heather clapped, and the customer on the other side of the till said, “Congrats!”
In front of the hearth, Malfoy pauses. “You know, Potter. It’s not a bad thing that you care.”
Harry smiles serenely.
In tones of awe, Malfoy said, “Potter. Is there a ghost only you can see?”
She put her fists on her hips and stared at him.
Despite the heat of the afternoon earlier, the night was cool, and he cast a light Warming Charm. The bright points of the stars were far more visible here than they were in London. He looked up at them and listened to the crickets. A train sounded its horn in the distance. It had been a while since he’d flown, but he had the urge to fly. He would have to ask Gin where she kept her brooms and see if he could borrow one.
“What do I need to do?”
himself at Malfoy. But again, Malfoy dispersed before reforming, whisper-thin but unbreakable, a rapier, a pick, a crowbar. He stabbed inward, leaned hard.
“Everyone has off time.” Although, Harry hadn’t really had any, had he?
“What the hell are those?” Harry asked, staring across the field.
They took the stairs back up to street level, passing window box planters and individually-painted bricks and a calico cat that stared out at them from a bedroom.
“The first thing to know about Portland is that, to fully experience it, you have to take public transportation.”
It was fascinating to hear the posh lilt come out in his voice despite the jarring use of “garbage” rather than “rubbish”—almost enough that the insult nearly slid over Harry.
Harry dutifully scraped them onto the pan Luna proffered, and—at her direction—spread them around to dry.
“It’s fine. We’ll talk about it later. You said there’s three? No more?”
“What? I don’t know. Maybe. What are you thinking?”
like his younger self, but there was something about the expression on his face and the slight tilt of his chin upward that brought to mind the boy.
Ginny swooped down on him as he stepped into the kitchen with the basket of potatoes.
Harry released the memo. He watched it fly away, then he stood in his cubicle looking at his crumb-strewn plate, the stacks of paperwork that fluctuated in height (but never by much), and the little notepad on which he’d written “potions test kits.”
Harry casts a nonverbal
Harry frowned and wanted to protest, but Malfoy had a point with that. “So…?”
“What do you want, Malfoy? How do you want it?”
Finally, he gave up the attempt and had a shower amidst swirling currents of chill air. The water, at least, was steaming hot.
“They’re not. But at least you’d have an idea of what’s happened.”
There was something familiar about the combination of coffee and treacle tart. Harry frowned and considered it while Ron told him about a dragon smuggling case. He took another bite of tart, another sip of coffee. And realized that it tasted a lot like the brulee caramel coffee from Malfoy’s shop.
“Besides breathing?” Harry jokes, weakly. Healer Catherine cracks a smile with him. “I’m—well.”
So, Robards suspects something. Or he doesn’t trust Harry, either because he thinks Harry is up to something with the Malfoy case or because he doesn’t have faith in Harry’s faculties. Whatever the reason, there’s nothing for it now: Hills and Bate will be reporting back on Harry’s presence at Malfoy’s. It didn’t escape Harry’s notice how Hills shortened the search and muzzled Bate. He’s sure he saw sympathy in the older man’s expression, and Harry dares to think he might find an unexpected ally in him. But that doesn’t change the fact that he’s bound to include Harry in the write-up.
Malfoy tossed it into the air a couple of times and then threw it back to Harry. His eyes tracked the movement as Harry caught it. “And neither have you.”
Harry stares at the file for several minutes before opening it, feeling like he is accessing something he shouldn’t, like he is in the Restricted Section again. He’s restrained himself from accessing the file several times over the years. Every time he itched to see what Malfoy was up to, he heard Hermione’s voice in his mind, chastising him for stalking Malfoy.
what Malfoy is going to ask, or at least he thinks he does, and the idea of answering truthfully makes him want to puke; the idea of answering
“Harry. She pointed at each one and told you the name. They’re written down.” Ginny pointed at the little slips of paper stuck to the wooden block behind each glass.
The corner of Potter’s mouth quirked up into a smirk. Then the expression stretched into a full, almost wistful smile as he cast a look at the clay jars lining the shelf above. “It feels homey. Almost reminds me of Luna’s house.”
“You’ll live.” Harry stepped close and placed his hands on Malfoy’s hips. He was gratified by the dumbstruck expression on Malfoy’s face and by the way his gaze dropped to Harry’s mouth. Harry grinned and Apparated them both to the farm.
Hermione’s own grin falls. Something flickers in her eyes.
Malfoy.
He blinks twice.
Malfoy looked up. “What, did a book bite you?”
Harry gave a frustrated huff of breath, because it was Ginny and he knew he wouldn’t get anywhere with it. He took a drink of his tea and a bite of his cheesecake, and watched the bees continue their dance from flower to flower.
“Your magic, Potter. What’s become of it? If you’re not dead, you must have some measure of control over it still, even if you can’t wield a wand?”
Harry shuddered. He was so close to the brink from excitement that he had to take a moment, and reached a hand down to squeeze the base of his own cock. His other hand was braced against Malfoy’s leg. He realized he was leaning too hard against it, and though Malfoy didn’t say anything—didn’t even seem to notice—Harry eased off.
Harry watches him with his own arms crossed and doesn’t respond.
Draco caught the plate of toast before it fell to the floor and got a handful of butter and jam for his trouble. He extracted the letters from the ruins of his breakfast, cleaned them with a charm, and threw another charm at the tea splashed across the kitchen.
Harry spends the next three days going through it. Every piece of correspondence, every bloody floo call. Robards was right. It’s all disgustingly, suspiciously innocent—almost mockingly so, in fact. Seed catalogues. Receipts for locally-made pottery. Recorded calls with Narcissa Malfoy full of sparkling laughter and airy conversations about the French countryside. Owl post filled with glossy photographs, tins of tea, and evergreen-flavored Bertie Bott’s Beans.
“It’s…a cupboard.”
Harry expect from Malfoy’s tastes? Not a coffee shop in Oregon, that was for sure. Harry only had his memories of the Manor and the Slytherin common room. More than ten years had passed since school, and this Malfoy was clearly a different persona. So, who knew? Maybe Malfoy liked, um—Harry glanced at the art on the walls—coffee beans and flowers, farm equipment and…some kind of sea rock rising from the sandy surf; some kind of rocky well surging with water.
Harry took another sip and gazed out at the bulky silhouette of the forest, trying not to smile. “Might have.”
“Fucking hell.”
“You knew where I’d be from Luna.”
“Yeah. How long has it been since you’ve gotten laid?”
But he lets his hands go and steps back, crossing his arms. His expression clouds with a shrewd look. A corner of his mouth quirks up, cool and cruel. “Just what wasn’t I supposed to see, Potter?”
“Almost as soon as I moved to Oregon. In the US, especially in this part of the country, it’s practically impossible to get around without driving. Easier for magical folks, but ultimately more convenient all around to have a car. Difficult to Apparate if you haven’t been to a location before. And you miss the countryside.”
approximate, considering Draco had absolutely no idea what would be needed for this project.
The emotions in Malfoy were different today. Not relieved and cold, but tense.
The fact that she is upset forces him to be calm, when all he feels like doing is standing up, charging out of the room, bursting out of his skin. He says, “What next?”
“You know it.”
Harry wondered what one of the larger ones looked like. He could imagine Ginny giggling downstairs at his reaction. He and Luna stood in a sitting area with a door to an en-suite. There was a rug and two upholstered chairs and a small coffee table rendered from a cut log in between them, next to a black iron stove. A blue kettle sat on the stove top. There was a large bed that could have fit three people with a quilt atop it. Beyond that: a more private sitting area with an escritoire, a wooden chair, and a bookshelf with a number of titles. There was even a small box that shimmered with preservation charms for food and drink. In short, it looked like its own cabin.
Harry laughed, perhaps louder than necessary. “A
“Something in the tea.”
or hesitated. But she’s had months to adjust to Harry’s situation and lose the soft pity and the fragile worry, months also spent as the mum to a little hellion. She doesn’t hesitate anymore. And deep down, Harry is grateful for that. He’s angry at her words, but only because they’re the truth.
“You weren’t even—” Humping, grinding, touching.
“Might be something here, too. Worth looking,” he muttered.
Harry had forgotten how much he enjoyed Quidditch practice. He hadn’t known what he would think about the quiet of the farm being disturbed, but he found that he liked the shout of voices, the creak of wood and leather, the dart of movement.
Brushing his teeth that night before bed, Harry is still thinking about Malfoy. Malfoy and Robards and the Ministry’s letters and the blank spaces on the case file.
“Fuck off.” Harry flips open the manuscript so he has something else to look at. He opens to the abstract because he
“I was there around noon. Just— Just for a few minutes. Are you sure he isn’t ignoring you? He was in a foul shit of a mood.”
people. Serving with a smile—albeit, sometimes it was a smirk, and sometimes with a face that looked almost like a question mark. He was as animated as ever, but he wasn’t insulting anyone, and he was taking orders as much as giving them, by the looks of it, and he wasn’t holding court, although many of the customers came away laughing at something he said.
“Shit,” he hissed, but his arm was fine, just a little pink from the close call.
“I can, indeed. But will I?” His gaze follows Harry’s as Harry throws a look over his shoulder. “What is it that has you so twitchy on my doorstep? Are you afraid of being followed? Or is it that your conscience is catching up to you? Will it round the corner in a moment?”
“Just fine,” he says. The upside is, the press won’t be able to bother him here. He looks down at the crisp white sheets of his bed. Though he wouldn’t want to stay here for good, he does admit that he feels safe here.
. I thought you knew something about that.”
It was ridiculous and vaguely magical (except the taxidermy heads did not blink) and crowded with pedestrians—a shock to the system after the peace of Ginny and Luna’s farm.
The interest isn’t quite genuine; it’s polite, a little remote. Alex has got something else on his mind, but he’s trying. Harry shrugs again. “Looks like Malfoy’s only crime is forgetting to cite his sources.” At Alex’s puzzled look, he adds, “He’s been doing research—” Something makes Harry censor himself. He ends with, “Hard to get him just on research.”
“I’m glad Ginny picked you up all right. I would have come myself, but I didn’t want to overwhelm you.”
Malfoy was beautiful, expression exhilarated and determined. The Snitch itself flitted into view and out of it again. They dipped and dived after it. Veered off. Pursued each other, sometimes passing close enough that Harry could see the gleam of Malfoy’s smile. At some point, Harry completely lost track of the Snitch. Forgot that it was supposed to be what he was chasing.
Harry kept looking at Malfoy. He felt a sensation in his chest he couldn’t remember feeling before, not quite like this. A sinking, and a ripping, and an aching. He had the overwhelming impulse to cross the courtroom and touch the side of his face. To know that he was solid and to have those grey eyes look at him. Malfoy without his self-righteousness or droll sarcasm was small, mean, and distressed-looking. He clutched his knees and blinked as if, without questions being directed his way, he kept forgetting where he was, what he was doing—vaguely reminiscent of Lockhart the last time Harry had seen him, or Hermione’s parents before their memories had been restored.
“Harry?” he said.
“Oh. No.” His mind raced. Saturday was less than a week away. He hadn’t realized so much time had passed already. His thoughts went to Ginny and Luna and the farm, then came to Malfoy and stayed there. Malfoy and the night they’d had.
Harry stared around. It was…a bedroom. A comfortable-looking bedroom in the same darkly-stained woods, with pale walls. It was very sensible-looking, except it did have some kind of spherical chandelier thing hanging from the center of the ceiling. It hung above the bed and reminded Harry of something from Astronomy class with its little models of planets in orbit (they moved slowly) and a single unlit candle suspended in the center. Harry wanted to make fun of Malfoy for it, but he couldn’t seem to open his mouth.
Malfoy dragged him through room after room, which were all connected by staircases and filled with bookcases. Memories of Hermione’s stories came back to him; upon returning from a trip to see Ginny and Luna, she’d mentioned this place in reverent tones.
It was different from telling Molly and Arthur or even Ron and Hermione. Luna looked thoughtful and offered some suggestions. (“Perhaps you could go into egg collecting. My Great Uncle Ovuphilius amassed quite a collection before a mother Occamy caught him on his way from the nest. He’d forgotten to cast a Disillusionment on the egg, you know. So it looked like it was floating. Occamies are very intelligent. And protective mothers.”) Ginny asked questions in between bites and poked fun at him. (“Fuck off to some tropical island. Make friends with a ball named Wilson.” Harry didn’t get it.)
“Shit. No. I expected him to hear me out.”
Harry’s face heated, but he ignored it. “Why shouldn’t I be cheerful? I’m on holiday.”
Harry realized he’d paused halfway down the driveway and was staring.
She blinks, turns away again. “He’s been transferred to Spell Damage.”
“The etchings.”
“What?”
“That Pansy fucked off to America with Ginny and Luna? Yes.”
But Alex is already pushing away from the door frame, and Harry doesn’t say any of that. “Good luck with that.”
Harry took the plate that Malfoy grinningly offered and loaded pieces of fried onion onto it. Something to balance out the alcohol sounded very good right now.
A second later, he realized he’d said it out loud, and added—in a ragged whisper—“Fuck me.”
Malfoy looked up from the little circles of biscuit—cookie—dough. “Excuse me? I need the powdered sugar.”
He took a narrow path around the side of the house and down a series of paved steps. Looking out over the rolling field, he wondered if he should send a Patronus, though he was exhausted from the trip and the heat of the sun through the car windows. Then he caught a glimpse of movement and saw that it was Luna.
Harry heaved a sigh. “What did you
“One part of the process I haven’t found a charm to replace is kneading by hand. In fact, we don’t
“Win and maybe I’ll tell you.” He flashes a toothy grin.
“Harry?”
There was an outraged cry, drawing Harry’s attention away from Robards’ orders.
Harry slumps back against the pillows.
“And you didn’t think to mention it?”
“I’m sure it is.” Malfoy’s voice sounded small, as if coming from a distance.
“What? Oh. Oh! Harry! That’s wonderful!”
“It is! He’ll be over after work, which is perfect, really, because there’s a song we need to sing first, and herbs we need to burn. It won’t do to relocate it without blessing the new land. Would you like to see the location? I’ll make us breakfast first. I never did eat. I had a dream about this chapter and came down. I suppose the sun will have risen by now.”
“What the hell, Malfoy!”
Harry wants to hex the person.
“This one has actual raspberries in it,” Harry said, with some surprise.
you getting out, you little bastard?” Draco murmured.
He set his bag on the bed. Hermione had helped him pack it. There weren’t a lot of things he’d brought with him—most of his material possessions had belonged to Grimmauld, so he’d left them—but he had enough that she’d set up an elaborate Undetectable Extension Charm on his luggage to contain it.
“Oh. Here,” Harry said, pulling the slip of paper Luna had given him from his pocket. He read the letters and numbers off. “Maybe we could ask at the desk?”
“Potter?” he said.
Slowly, cautiously—as if sensing the importance of what lay inside the chest—Andromeda accepted it from him.
Malfoy crosses his arms. “Are you questioning me, Potter? Directly after handing me that summons to be interviewed at the Ministry under the
“I don’t give a rat’s ass. I don’t want to live forever if I’m not
Draco laughed weakly. “A whale. In Britain? In a garden?”
The war never left him. Not entirely.
Malfoy was indeed waiting for Harry in the front. It was strange to see this side of the house; Harry hadn’t really been up here since he first arrived because he’d Apparated everywhere he’d gone. With his bag on his shoulder, he had a flashback to arriving. That brought an odd pang of emotion, and it mixed with the pang of seeing Malfoy leaning against the front of a silver car with his baseball cap on. His gaze caught Harry’s and held.
“You like flying. You’re good at it.”
More of that wrong feeling assails Harry. His gaze snaps to Malfoy. Apparently, they are directly in the middle of questioning him.
“Well, yeah, I like flying. It’s the attention I don’t much like.”
Harry pulls in a deep, shuddering breath. His lungs feel tight—an impression that comes with a squeezing sense of claustrophobia—but at least they are his to control again.
The retort on Harry’s tongue involved Hippogriffs, and probably wasn’t the most politic thing to say. Harry tore off another little piece and tossed it, half to see how Malfoy would react. He disappointed Harry by returning to his food (though not without rolling his eyes, which was enough to amuse Harry, really).
Malfoy is sitting so far on the edge of his desk chair that he’s in danger of toppling out. He leans forward with a feverish gleam in his eyes.
Hermione closes one book and reaches for another. Harry marvels at how completely absorbed she is despite Malfoy being in the same room. It gives him an odd feeling he can’t categorize. Something like wonder, maybe, and a bit like amusement, though the feeling comes with a hard edge that lodges inside his chest.
something—and Harry was adamant that, whatever it was, they needed to do it together. After all, there was no point in quitting the Aurors, where they had got involved in the first place because they clicked so well as working partners, only to spend no time with each other.
“I think you’d like Curse-Breaking,” Bill said to him one morning as they worked together to unravel the magic woven into a moth-eaten tapestry.
—and that was the problem. He sensed Malfoy giving him a long look but avoided meeting his gaze.
, but who cares if he’s the draw, as long as they stay to listen to what he says?
“I’ve got to
“That’s good to hear. Do you have plans for the day? There’s a very kind man who runs a non-magical bicycle shop in town. Do you know anything about bicycles? I thought you might be interested in learning.”
His gaze met Malfoy’s only a split moment before the water splashed down on both of them. Malfoy’s arm hooked around Harry’s waist to brace him, hand still clutching the hawthorn wand. The water pummeled down and down. Then it was over and a wind whipped past them. Voices whooped. Harry looked up into Malfoy’s face, which he couldn’t quite make out through his droplet-spangled glasses.
One of Malfoy’s eyebrows—the one under the white fringe of hair—rises. Harry swallows dryly, then takes another drink of brandy to wet his mouth.
“Hello?” echoed a wooden parrot head.
didn’t seem to care whether or not Harry wanted to listen to his ceaseless monologues (in fact, Harry did).
“And pass up free food?” Harry teases, his voice shockingly quiet, shockingly fond. He injects more good-natured scorn into it. “You’ve lost the plot, Malfoy.”
“Not just a pretty face,” he’d said to Draco.
“And what if the college hadn’t been looking?”
Heather turned from the till. She snagged the cup of espresso and the pitcher of steamed milk from Harry and said, “Look. You want the milk to go under the espresso, so you start off far away. But you don’t want it to splash, so hold it close first, then pull back—like this. You don’t have to worry about the latte art at the end. That’s just for show.”
“Do you want a chocolate biscuit?”
But Harry manages to check himself before responding. Right. Professional. He takes a steadying breath. “Conspiracy. Sedition.”
“Mmm.”
“Aurors,” Harry said, cheerfully. Hermione had taught him the spell after Ron complained that Harry took
” and “
Harry glances heavenward. “I’m tired, Malfoy. Now you know what went on.” A thought occurs to him. “How is your house being secured?”
And for the life of him, Harry didn’t know if she was agreeing that it was literally magical or “magical” as a turn of phrase.
Malfoy’s shoulders drop. “I resent you, truly.”
Gently, Harry gripped Malfoy’s arm and lifted it. Malfoy watched warily, like he was waiting to see what Harry would do next. Harry had no idea, himself. But he found himself stroking the soft skin of the forearm over the tattoo, feeling the faint scar. He placed a kiss to the inside of the elbow and then traveled down towards the wrist with his mouth.
“It needs to be cut back,” Draco agreed.
“See?” Malfoy said, spreading his hands.
“Stay there. I’ll be back shortly.”
I meant by ‘research,’ Potter?”
Eventually she calms, and they go over her notes together. The case file is surprisingly true to the real story. It states that Malfoy was accusing Poesy Potions of releasing toxins into the water supply and was attempting to rally public outrage and panic. The problem is that the authors of the file accuse Malfoy of making up false information against Poesy, or at least vastly exaggerating it for the purpose of creating dissent.
For some reason, this made Potter grin wider.
Harry dug the toe of his trainer into the carpet of leaves and pine needles. “Right. They told me Malfoy asked them not to tell me about him being in Oregon. I reckoned he asked you the same thing? Malfoy didn’t want me to know where he was.”
Harry had got that sense. And that should have intimidated him, probably—work that never ended—but instead it filled him with a sense of rightness.
After a minute, he tucked the letter back into the chest. He closed the lid.
thing not to be recognized. Just. Unfamiliar.
He blinks twice to acknowledge this information.
Fucker!”
“He almost didn’t, though,” Ron said, darkly. “That last armoire…”
Harry thought.
“Scowling like the other Ministry gargoyles, no doubt,” Malfoy drawls.
“Or brandy. Or port.”
Williams and Chesterfield must have sent a message to Robards, too. A silvery bull charged into the room. It reared its head and boomed, “Call Potter. We need—”
“Well, then?” Harry says, brazening it out. “What’s your question?”
Portland, Oregon
“Oh!” Her hand goes to her mouth. “You’re shitting me.”
For one thing, he was tired. He and Malfoy had arrived back in Portland late the night before. Harry had insisted that Malfoy drive to his own home rather than dropping him at the farm.
“I’m not uncouth.”
They turned onto the street. Houses and trees and countryside slid by. Harry was aware of it in a different way than when he’d first arrived. It felt more familiar now; he had lost the sense of being displaced.
Still frowning, Harry told them that it didn’t feel right anymore, and he wanted to have time to do something else in his life. They asked him what “something else” he planned to do, and Harry told them he wasn’t sure.
She maintains a calm expression, but her eyes soften. He might have called it pity if it were someone else. From her, it is compassion and a deep understanding.
Malfoy follows him up the stairs and hangs back as Harry pulls the pensieve out of its cabinet. The liquid is pearly with a memory, and he stares at it until he remembers the memory of the letters the Ministry sent Malfoy. Instead of removing it, he decides to leave it in. He adds the rest of his memories in with it: from first arriving on Malfoy’s doorstep till the end of the court hearing. Maybe he should leave that particular memory out, but he thinks Malfoy ought to know what he was made to believe and say.
Thankfully, once they’d accepted that he wouldn’t allow them to assault his roses any longer, they picked their way towards Rosemary and Heather’s land without much more trouble.
They returned to the broom shed in silence, and Harry put the equipment away. Though the night was still young, one flight seemed like enough—but Harry wasn’t ready to say goodbye.
Harry slowly stalks forward. The truth is he can’t move much faster for fear of losing his breath, but he scowls and hopes to play it off as intimidating. He doesn’t have to fake the anger.
“It’s me saving you from selling shoes today.”
“I haven’t got a kneazle.”
. But like you said, I could have owled it. I want to talk to you. Because—” He swallows a lump in his throat. He can’t believe he’s admitting this to Malfoy. “Because something isn’t adding up here. Why did you show me the information requests? What does all of this have to do with Poesy Potions?”
Harry takes an empty chair near the table. Malfoy glances at him. Hermione says, “Oh, hi Harry,” in a distant tone. The two of them return to their discourse. Harry, tired and hungry, wonders if he should have bothered coming right over. He has sandwich ingredients at home, and a comfortable sofa.
you, Mr. Potter. Have a
With the help of a mild disillusionment, Harry slips back out of the DMLE unseen. Needing to think, he lets his feet carry him to the stairs. A month ago, even, he wouldn’t have been able to make the trip of several flights without losing his breath. Now he’s only mildly winded when he arrives in the atrium, which is probably due to the lack of exercise as much as anything.
Malfoy glanced at him. Frowned. Put the pen in his teeth. Opened the book and placed it atop the other so the passages aligned. Took the pen from his mouth.
Harry squeezes his hand. “Good work,” he whispers.
“I didn’t.”
Harry made himself very busy eating and drinking, keeping his eyes on his food.
Harry had lost his command of language completely, but that was fine because Malfoy didn’t seem to expect a reply. He groped for his wand and murmured Cleaning Charms over both of them, then flopped down next to Harry.
“Nah. It’ll be all right. At least it’ll be over and done with, and then we don’t need to worry about traveling again until…”
“What? Harry! No!”
. It’s a farce. Hermione continues to shoot him needle-like looks, and Harry ignores her, and Malfoy ignores him.
“The spicy dill pickle should be ready soon,” Luna said, in that wonderful way she had of suddenly changing the subject. “You’ve come back just at the right time, Pansy.”
Harry shrugs. “Nothing, really.” He twines their fingers together, and Malfoy lets him. Their palms feel good, fitted like that. Harry squeezes once, gently. Malfoy stares down at them. Swallows.
“Potter!”
“Not bad. Guava and habaneros.”
Draco looked at him, eyes wide. “We are
The foreboding in his belly congealed into a ball of iron and sank, heavy and cold. This, then. This was the reason for the dread he’d felt since waking.
them. Because—okay. People did buy hats to wear them. And Malfoy had bought this hat.
“Where are we going now?” Harry asked, as Malfoy led him down the street. “And when can I have my ice cream back?”
“Huh,” Harry said.
They passed lavish displays and floating platforms that carried people to the higher shelves of the floor-to-ceiling bookcases. There was a caged-off area for the “Books That Bite — enter at your own risk” and a special room for old, cursed volumes with “tours and viewings by appointment only.”
Harry drew away from the forefinger and laved the thumb, took it into his mouth, applied his teeth to the pad.
Harry nearly choked on his quiche. “Bat cave?”
Luna smiled. “Oh, yes. It is.”
Before the patronus had vanished, Harry was on his feet. He cursed and patted his pocket for his wand. Williams and his partner, Chesterfield, were on stakeout tonight—at one of the least-likely sites, at that. Alarm and rage coursed through him; they’d had strict orders to call Harry or Robards if they noticed activity. But excitement moved through him, too, propelling him down the hall to the lifts.
Parkinson’s eyes went round, and then she laughed again. “You cheated! You’re drinking that Brewmaster’s.”
Raising his eyebrows, Harry says, “No jokes about my inadequacy to protect anyone right now? No references to my recent hospital visit? Have I rendered you speechless?”
Mafloy’s gaze follows the movement of Harry’s hand from his head to his hip. “You’re nervous.”
In the past, Hermione might have wavered, might have trailed off before adding
. He liked Malfoy.
The waiter gave him a strange look.
He righted the tower, scooped the dirt back into the pots, and placed the pots with their daffodils back onto the tower, grimacing as the flowers brayed in his face. He reached for his wand, encountered sticky damp fabric, crossed his eyes in disgust, and cast a charm to secure the stand and the pots inside of it.
Luna turned to him. “What do you think you’ll get, Harry?”
“No. It’s nothing. Just. Reminded me of something.” Heat rose in his face.
Malfoy’s lips purse. “Stressed? Who said anything about stressed?”
Ginny and Luna were moving effortlessly around each other in the kitchen again. Ginny asked Luna about Luna’s latest experiment with pickle recipes (“Mum is asking for the recipe when you’ve got it tweaked”), and Luna asked Ginny about what setup she needed for the next Quidditch camp on the farm. Harry hadn’t realized that Luna typically helped Ginny with the Quidditch camp, but she was well-versed in the equipment and even knew the names of frequent students.
They stopped next to the skip, which emitted a mixture of sweet and rotten smells today.
A thrill went through Harry, and he had to pause a moment as he tried to keep himself together. Another man’s cock.
Another one of those long, slow blinks. “But it was a curse...on you.”
Malfoy ordered an apple and blue cheese cone. Harry wanted the double chocolate, since he at least recognized that, but when Malfoy leaned past him to say, “Scratch that. Marionberry pie and honey lemon,” Harry was momentarily too stunned by the warm press of his shoulder to protest.
“Good. That’s settled, then.” With a flourish, he called off the spell.
he’d told Malfoy the night before.
Malfoy grabbed the banister. “No drunker than you.”
Evening sunlight bathes Malfoy through the window where he perches on the sill. He’s directly in Harry’s line of sight, and Harry’s gaze falls on him. This is a pose Harry hasn’t seen him in before: back propped against one side of the sill and feet propped against the other, a book open on his knees, absorbed and serious, his sarcastic mouth set in a thoughtful frown. Occasionally, he lifts a long-fingered hand to turn the page. Licks the pad of his index finger. Pulls on his lip and tilts his head so that his white blond hair shines with the luster of fine metal.
They put Teddy to bed, using a combination of charms to ease the eight-year-old’s journey from the sofa to his bedroom upstairs. Then they set a silent alarm on the boy (in case he woke) before creeping into Draco’s lab. It was the one room in the house that Teddy knew was completely off-limits, and so it had become their base of secret Christmas operations.
“You don’t think I haven’t been downing caffeine all day?”
She held out her hand. The rest of his friends were watching, and Harry didn’t want to be belligerent—and, really, he didn’t have a
Harry glares at his brandy glass and reflects that coming here really was an awful idea.
“What the actual fuck, Malfoy?”
One eyebrow rose to a peak. “What? Have you never tried?” His voice dropped to a murmur. “It feels really good.”
Harry’s gaze moved to the woman behind the counter. She had purple-streaked hair and smiled as she handed a receipt to the current customer. Next to her, a man with cropped dark hair pushed buttons at the bank of coffee machines behind the counter.
“This looks good,” Harry says, voice rougher than intended.
Harry looks at the Wizengamot. “It doesn’t count.”
Luna perked up at that. “I’ll make you some sleep tea later.”
“Yeah. I’m doing fine, thanks,” he grit out. “How are you?”
Potter hesitated for half a second before shaking his head. Draco
He set off across the field. A warm wind passed over him, bringing smells of dry grass and something kind of sweet, kind of bitter.
Hermione furrows her brow and pours them tea, adding milk to both—and sugar to his. Harry cradles his hands around his cup and looks back at her through the rising steam.
Harry can only scowl back because yes, actually, he’d had the same question. But he can’t admit that out loud, and he feels the heat of embarrassment.
“Don’t they just,” Draco muttered, still scanning the air above.
Draco Malfoy. The name on the parchment raises a flurry of unwanted questions. Where has he been these last fifteen years? What has he been up to? Who is he now?
“But this is the garden.”
Harry had a weird feeling, as if suddenly colliding with reality. “It’s fine. I’ve been fine.”
In the sitting room, Teddy was still passed out on the sofa as Harry had left him. He had green and blue smudges of icing on his cheeks, and his hair had turned matching streaks of color.
“Uh…”
Aware that he should proceed carefully—if for some reason someone
the camp this year?”
He doesn’t call out again. He casts a wordless
and found two of the newer, faster brooms from the back of the shed, where Ginny kept them under extra protection. She would probably flay them both alive if they damaged the brooms. Harry gently prised them from their wards.
“You assume I have off time.”
“I didn’t say a thing,” she said as she handed a receipt and a number to a customer.
Malfoy popped the rest of the croissant in his mouth and licked his thumb and first two fingers. He met Harry’s gaze, lips shiny from butter, and Harry realized that the feeling in his stomach had nothing to do with food.
Still spinning, and warm and comfortable and more than a little confused, Harry rolls over and drifts off.
touchy?” Harry deadpans.
He spotted some witches and wizards in traditional robes, as well as people wearing dress from other countries, though the majority wore Muggle clothing—some more appropriately than others. Although, when he stepped through the barrier into the general Muggle section of the airport, he had to reevaluate that thought. Quite a few of the people coming from the Muggle airplane terminals wore some surprising articles of clothing in even more surprising combinations.
a very nice-looking house.
The garden was surprisingly large—a long space that stretched back a distance that was at least as long as the house itself—and basic in design. No topiary for adult Malfoy. No lawn. Instead, a path of white, chunky gravel traveled down the middle of the garden. The rest of the ground was covered in bark chippings. There were rose bushes, a large waxy-leaved camellia, and ivy that crept over the fence. A tall tree spread shade over much of it.
They paused to take trays out of the oven and put a new set in.
Harry gave a jaunty shrug.
Malfoy frowned. He didn’t say anything, but then, he wasn’t trying to actively crush Harry’s foot anymore.
Costs grew especially steep during experimental potions development. Draco might run dozens, even hundreds, of combinations before he discovered the right formula. The longer a brew was in development, the more costly it became.
“Oh hey, Harry,” Hermione said.
“Hey, Luna.”
She gives his hand a squeeze. “Well, you flooed to Draco’s. Then you called me. Do you remember that much?”
“What?”
Harry can’t quite see the aurors from where he’s standing, but he can hear them just fine. “What’s the meaning of this?” says a gruff voice. Hills, then. That meant—
“Only the weak fear darkness.” Draco translated.
“What? No! He needs me!” The blonde looked up at them with alarm.
Harry gasped at the implication and watched her take a sip of her drink. The memory of their first meeting, Draco had come from nowhere, Harry hadn’t even thought of why.
-Albus Dumbledore, as quoted in the wizard’s biography A Phoenix at Heart
He didn’t let go of Dobby as he walked blindly back to Grimmauld. “You aren’t going back there Dobby, stay with me. Don’t ever go there ever again.” He sobbed. His feet hit the stone path heavily in his defeat. It had been there. It was right there, and now he had no choice, but to tell Tom if he was still at the house. He was going to ruin his family after all.
“Prove it.” He challenged as he pumped the member to hardness, the scrap of dry skin on skin filling the space between them. Draco was panting now, not entirely to do with the prospect of sex as he was sucking in air to keep centered and away from his own panic that had kept nipping at his heels this whole time.
“Don’t I just.” He sighed and shook his head mockingly.
A relived breath escaped the pair as they sat on the edge of the bed letting Nagini slide under the warm sheets, her large head sticking out like a content puppy. She must be, the bedding still warm from their bodies only minutes ago.
“Magic paintings are weird.”
“If you were just going to keep insisting it was important to state his position. Besides, you already know Bellatrix. If you were going to hate me for it, you’d have done so a bit sooner than this I suppose.” Draco looked away as much as possible even when it only faced him with a stone wall.

Her scream had cut short, no one had heard anything else and the rustling was still everywhere and as natural as ever. Wherever Pomona was to their side they had no way of knowing where this enemy had run to next or how deep their hiding place was in this new room.
“I was going to save you for her, you know. I had thought she would enjoy that, but I find myself more angry with you than I think I’ve ever been.”
With a few yells of indignant protest and footsteps his cupboard was opened, and Vernon grabbed his arm to drag him out. Harry found himself pushed into the room; two stiff men stood patiently. His family looked somewhere between furious and worried as Vernon bumbled and was promptly cut off.
“You lied for us?” Hope was showing in their eyes.
It was wonderful in that terrifying way that he kept waiting for the other shoe to drop and it just didn’t, leaving behind a sense of both relief and a continued renewal of tension. It was with that strange combination of rushing emotions and hyper focus that Harry let Mr. Weasley throw a soft arm around his shoulder to keep him close as they weaved out of the ministry, waving goodbye to most everyone they passed. It seemed that he had a good reputation, of course, but as always, the worry set in and a little voice tried to whisper ‘the Dursley’s have a good reputation’.
(See the end of the chapter for
“I get that sometimes too. Honestly,” Harry paused to find the right words,” Honestly, I just try to ignore it sometimes. Tell myself that someone didn’t mean to say that thing that sticks with me all day or that saying something someone doesn’t like won’t mean I end up on the receiving end of a fist. It’s like this knee jerk reaction and now that I don’t need it to be there it just feels like this out of place thorn in my heart.”
“How many meals do you eat?” Harry didn’t even answer that one, by the look of him Roody didn’t need to wonder much either. “Do you want to leave?”
“Maybe…” She considers the idea as they meet up. “Alright so—”
“Do I want to know?”
“Yes…yes, I’ll hide out with you like a common criminal.”
Sirius was impatient at the best of times and it seemed that he wanted them all squeezed together to open presents the instant they got up. Remus was stalling him from waking the kids by sitting on his lap and making Santa jokes he wasn’t qualified to use. Draco and Harry were quickly noticed when they burst out laughing at the next pun they heard, Remus almost falling to the floor when he threw his head back from the sweet kisses he was pecking on Sirius’ jawline.
The murky figure in front of him inched closer and his instincts made him flinch away.
“So, you think they could be a good thing?” Ron asked doubtfully as he watched a few full Nome’s trot off into the pastures beyond. “They’ve never been subtle about destroying the farm land before…”
The thump and drag of the floor opening filled their ears as the large floor entrance opened. Inside they could see two things, the old dusty steps down that hadn’t been seen in centuries and the small footprints left in them from where Narcissa had already been. She had somehow known where and how to open the entrance and there was no telling how long ago this was.
“She liked you?”
Hermione laughed in her hand, “Is that why you never got a familiar?”
“You think I’m handsome?” He asked instead of all the other questions he felt floating about his head. Harry twitched and rose up to look at him again. Draco took him in a second time, the bruises on his face obscured his finer features, a classic jawline and emerald green eyes blood shot beyond appreciation to name the ones he could see in the dim light. “You don’t look so horrible.” He muttered back to Harry. It struck him he was paying a lesser being a complement but didn’t care to mind. He was bisexual himself not that anyone needed to know, he would most likely have an arranged marriage, and anything less would bring shame to his father.
“Does this mean you’re immortal again?” Harry blurted as he kept staring at the man. Albus gave a concerned look at his comment, Tom didn’t know everything he’d learned so of course Albus was still unsure. Harry wanted to kick himself for omitting that bit so early. Preemptively he decided not to look at his parents.

“Hey sweet girl, is this supposed to go to you?” He asked as he brought his finger to its face, the mandrakes face opened into a gaping hole and the degusting scent of the corpse plant was almost overwhelmed by the sweet red apple smell pouring from the mandrakes face. He couldn’t tell if it was also a spine that did it, but some part of the mandrake licked up the pollen and then happily curled back up.
“I didn’t mean to. I’ve never used this stuff before.” He frowned as he coated his hand properly.
“And me sitting here is like the biggest fuck you or something possible? Slytherin is still a house after all that?” Harry absently handed Crabbe a scone out of reach when he saw the boy was too far away from the plate.
Harry was hyper aware of the sounds around him thanks to his partially blind state. He could only hope Sirius was faring better with his dog eyes and nose to guide him through and protect the others. He felt as if he had been going on forever till the rustle of the leaves around him faded enough that he let himself take a deep breath against a tree trunk.
“I’m sorry.” Lucius said. “I…”
“Yes, I’m being evaluated for service with the ministry. It’s taken longer than I expected, but I have enjoyed working here with everyone. I’ll still see you all when I visit.” He smiled. The crinkled up red mouth the girl wore unfolded into a smile in return.
Harry’s breathe caught at the words. “I don’t mean to be a bother.”
“Think she likes me.” He mumbled against his pillow as Draco snorted at him somewhere out of sight where he was seated. A hand slipped along his side and he sighed in approval.
“…You’re great too.” He heard directed at the back of his head. Draco could see his ears turn a new shade of red.
“Magic painting?” Harry arched his brow.
Nagini had been kind enough to not protest his decision as they made their way shakily down the drain pipe. Harry’s fingers shaking and quickly freezing over at the touch of the frosted metal. His grip tight with nerves as the added weight of the snake made the prospect of falling that much more real.
It had started small; Piers had been a rat faced boy that came over every day when they were kids. Best friends with Dudley he was always there and more often than not helping to hold him down to take someone’s punch. He still looked like a rat of course, no one can change that much, maybe it was Harry that changed? He started to look-
“You don’t have to say anything, just, I—you know how when we met, I said—Well I mean to say that—” Harry was choking on his words to the point Draco became completely lost as he waited. A minute went by with him watching Harry physically struggle to form words before he took out his wand. “What are you doing?”
Sitting down on the swing gratefully Harry looked down at his arms, splotched with purple and red smears. They’d never done it so hard before, left him so broken, save a few broken bones. Was it only ever going to get worse? He felt soar and light headed. Through the ache a different spike of pain hit at the center of his chest.
The walk was uneventful, somehow making it worse as they approached the panel to the hall outside his Mother’s private boudoir. Presented to the gold knobbed double doors to possibly the one room he had never been allowed in by his loving Mother, Draco felt sick. Dobby stepped to the side and ducked his head having completed his task; he was as sure as he could be that this was the right place.
He was panicking now, hyperventilating as quietly as he could. Draco of course saw. Of course, he just had to notice the change, it’s not like he had stopped looking. The Slytherin stood up, despite getting odd looks as he went around the tables, passing by the first years still waiting to be called up. He stomped his way right up behind Harry and pushed him aside to sit down with him.
It was one week till he saw Draco again.
As always, thank you so immensely for reading my work, it means everything to me to have someone to share this with.
“I want to be with you.” He relented finally and he could feel the body around him slouch in relief.
Rita was salivating over her headline choices; Death eater round up hits home, muggle child used as human bait, the newest Lucius Malfoy publicity stunt puts his son in the firing range! Each word a piece of gold. The trouble would be choosing her favorite.
“Prepare to be defeathered you pesky peacock.” He took stance.
“You know there is this one thing I read in the library downstairs.” Harry started from beside him. “About finding or searching for things, maybe one of the things in that book could help.”
The summer went by like that. The warm welcome slowly giving Harry enough support to let himself trust. To really trust the people around him. It had been moments of showing his fear or discomfort, of going along with everyone and hoping; now he was letting himself smile and talk openly almost all of the time. When it got too much all he had to do was go quite in the background and let the chatter roll over him in waves. Unlike the Dursley’s, his presence in their space wasn’t pushed behind a wall to be forgotten; They still turned to see if he got a joke or said little things for him to nod along to. It had been startling at first, but then it had become wonderful.
“This is so weird mate.” Ron said to Harry who could only shrug at the sentiment.
“It just figures Dudley would find someone like you to come here.” Harry looked down at his knees as he picked at the swing chains.
“Every time you get hurt or almost get killed it’s my fault.” His voice sounded a bit wet, almost pouty.
“That’s not what I told you to do Dear. I told you not to snoop anymore. Go back to your room and we can tell your Father about this in the morning.” She made to stand and Draco launched himself from his seat. He had just meant to stay level with her, animal instincts insisted that he be mobile as her shadow cast by the candles stretched over him. “Draco, I am asking you nicely. I am worried about you and I want you to go to bed and rest, that was a nasty curse you just took and you need to sleep it off now.” She was still holding the same insistently gentle tone, but her shoulders were squaring like she knew her authority was waning.
“I want this though. I shouldn’t, but I want you. I think I always did.” He confessed softly into the ear next to where he rested his chin. “If this is permission, I’m taking it. I love you too.” He said with hushed conviction. So much for that last line he wasn’t going to cross.
“No, no, I just.” He trailed off as they made their way back through the castle to the kitchens. “I’m new at this, go easy on me here.” He wilted
Meanwhile Tom was knee deep in thick ferns and shrubs blocking every path they went. It was growing thicker like a maze as they went and Sirius was probably the only reason they weren’t lost by now. The way back would be hell and they were too far in the rustling green to hear the sounds coming from behind them from Harry and the others.
“I don’t care!” Pansy denied and Blaze finally decided to push her back with the other two for him to take point.
“I didn’t want to deal with both my stupid muggle cousin and you simpletons.” Draco snapped and reeled back the next moment, checking Harry’s expression before starting again. “I’m not going to hide from you anymore, I was just busy and now it’s taken care of so come off it.” He tried to close the case.
“We think…We think that logically it can’t be in her vault since no one else has the rights to access it to put it there. That the person trusted with it wouldn’t rightly keep them on their person. So that means there has to be a proper hiding place that hopefully isn’t moving. I’ve been ransacking every place I can think of and so far, none of her affiliates have turned anything up. It had to be someone she trusted, but I can’t think of anyone like that when I try.” Tom shook his head hopelessly. “I can’t even hold onto the hope that one day I’ll get to follow after him because of her.”
“I do not worry. You just get into too much trouble if I don’t keep eyes on you.”
Harry stood before a huge door that seemed to warp only to dwarf him further. The intimidating fact that his entire future depended on what lay behind that door weighing him in place but not quite in reality. A heavy breath, an image of a scraggily dog, a lick from a forked tongue to his limp hand. Sensations whipping through him as he allowed the polished man before him to guide him onward.
“So, she got rid of him then? She was never at the Villa; she knew I’d trace him and cut her tie to slip away while we busy ourselves with this new mess of information, we can’t afford to leave uninvestigated. How long will the healing take before he can be interviewed?”
“You’ve had to learn pretty quick. You were the last person I thought ever would, I won’t say I’m not glad. You of all people have a voice that could influence all kinds of movements in the right direction someday. I just hope it sticks, if you go backwards, we’ll be the ones to hold you accountable for Harry’s sake. He is going to be my friend now too after all.” She answered.
The minister was pasty white by the end of his lecture. Draco hoped he wouldn’t have to prove that last part, father helping a muggle boy that would be the day, luckily no one outside the death eaters would understand to question it.
Madam Pomfrey was huffing as she worked on everyone in their beds. They were mostly fine, nothing a bit of rest and a healing drought couldn’t help along. The thing that gave her the most worry was the gangly muggle boy she was told had been attacked. He was stomach down on the bed and protested against being moved over. When she took her readings of his injuries, she was just downright confused.
“They outnumber you. Smart but hardly something to be proud about when your only target is constantly bleeding and passive.” Draco scoffed, he could send the lot of them flying to the hospital if he wanted, but one muggle needed an army to beat up this malnourished looking skeleton. “No, I don’t believe I’ve had the pleasure to meet this insect Dudley.”
Harry felt the clock counting down and bolted up the stone in a huge leap of faith that he wouldn’t be struck down. That the sword would give.
Narcissa had been baring her teeth and her ashen complexion only turned paler at the sight of her last obstacle holding what they both clearly knew was an unmatched weapon while standing proudly atop her goal.
“I’m not a professor young lady and you know it.” He joked back not thinking anything of it. The fourteen-year-old was always like this. The attempt at looking like a noble woman at her age was new though and he wanted to laugh, but didn’t dare do something that could make her feel insecure.
“Remus you stay with the kids, but Sirius I think we could use your skills for this just in case.”
After that Hill was all over Draco and demanding more pets from him. They both left with floating strands of hair trailing behind them where it jostled off their clothes.
“Moving on is hard.” He said before grabbing the handle of his cart again. It was hard, but he was healing. So was Harry. So was Lucius and Severus and if they could do it so could he. If the past half a year had taught him anything it was to appreciate the good moments when they were there and right now after the chaos, they had another moment to enjoy till the next thing happened. He’d let himself enjoy it the way his muggle did and deal with whatever came later.
“Sit.” Hagrid waited till the wagging butt before him hit dirt and Draco caught his breath as he tried to reach over with the hair brush.
“That’s enough Dear, your Aunt Bella would be upset at you for going through her things like that. Why don’t you put it back and we can enjoy some late-night biscuits together? I’ve had Lacy bring up a tray in the other room.” A gentle voice called from the door.
“I could have said that better, couldn’t I?” Draco said as he pet Nagini’s head as she watched them intently.
Harry stared into the shining red orb Kreacher had artfully crafted with wrapping foil somehow before disappearing off somewhere. He thought of all the times he’d been pushed to the side while Dudley opened a dozen glittering presents with ungrateful remarks to the very parents that had gotten them for him. He thought of how many times he wished he wasn’t a boy starving in front of a feast he’d be hit for touching. It hadn’t yet been a year since he’d come here, but it had been a year since the last Christmas he’d been forced like always to clean up. His throat squeezed at the promise of tears and he forced himself to take deeper breaths.
“Professor.” She said coyly as she draped herself on the chair opposite Tom’s desk after she had strolled in. It was technically the teachers desk he was using to grade papers while they were busy.
Harry was done, he promised himself, he was done running off alone like that. Even if he was going to see Zanna he would just take someone with him. An extra cookie and some milk for the gatekeeper should be enough to let an extra person in after all. None of them were happy about the potential cost of the Sylph’s help and this would help ease their tight grip on him after the conclusion of another incident.
“Confident as always I see. Draco, I don’t know if I can tell you what I want to. I actually shouldn’t, but I just keep thinking about it. Maybe I’ve been thinking about it a lot.” He hunched over quietly. This was a bad idea. Just because they were properly alone in a nice place didn’t make anything more likely.
“Not wrong, but not what we’re looking for. The foundation is big, but a cornerstone sounds like a small thing. What’s a small thing that holds everything up?” Draco rolled his eyes at Harry who just smiled wider.
It was then Minister Fudge and Dolores returned to the space. He deposited Cotton and stood before them determined. The tight smile on Dolores’s face was tugged down in mock disappointment at the events of the day. The minister just looked tired.
“Albus.” He called to the figure that slowly walked out of his room up an open flight of stairs, the image of Juliet played itself atop the old man who smiled with so much honest uncontained love it sometimes hurt.
“How did you get in without knocking on the front door Dear?” She said as she looked around the room. When Draco checked the feeling of his hand, he realized Dobby was still there and had gone invisible, he was just as afraid it seemed.
“Sirius Black speaking, for the record. Me and my husband have been to a few of these hearing in the past for much the same request we are here today for. We would like to adopted Harry Potter. We have been denied before on grounds of my family’s history of mental deficiency and Remus Lupin’s lycanthropy. It is my understanding that these reasons are discriminatory and have been used to deny the right of parenthood from us. We are both mentally fit and capable with access to medical magic and transport to saint mongos at any time through floo. We are located in an undisclosed and heavily warded home that will be shared only with Harry Potter and his caseworker for safety reasons. I will say that it is in a location that gives Harry the option of a muggle school and other muggle world amenities that he may choose to travel to at any time. We have talked with head master Dumbledore on this matter as well and have been granted permission to extend schooling at Hogwarts under the special requirement that a magic user will aid him in the required assignments.”
The only consolation to this whole thing was if anything happened to him and Albus again at least Severus was safe and watching Lucius in Saint Mungo’s. That and he wasn’t alone in the fight this time. He lined up with his fellow ministry workers who set a perimeter and began to upend the foliage to try and get a reaction. He heard a yell farther off, much farther than he thought the room went and a flare of light fizzed up out of the dark a meter away in an attempt to signal them. Albus was calling them as best he could. It told them two things for sure at least, the room was huge and judging by how much the light had been obscured so were the plants. Great.
“Avada Kedavra!” The impact of the magic hitting the wall was disturbingly quiet, a whispering mass that swallowed itself whole when it did not find its target.
“You fear me? But you have come for answers none the less. All those that come here will be granted this and more, for it is my purpose in this world.”
“When you say it like that it makes me feel worse, I’m related to her too after all.” Draco scowled.
“Mr. Potter, it is my pleasure to meet you.” He smiled softly, the practiced ease of his movements drawing Harry in. “I am Tom Riddle; I am your case worker. I am to present you with news of the rulings before you enter.”
“Oh ya, Sorry, Bellatrix, right? I just remembered, Grandma Walburga wanted me to tell you something—”
“Tom.” He smiled at the slip of tongue, it seemed that Severus was feeling reminiscent though who couldn’t blame him with the line of questioning going on. Severus cleared his throat, clearly embarrassed by the obvious mistake.
Tom was jumping two steps at a time as he ran up to Albus’ rooms at the top pf Hogwarts. Honestly, sometimes he wished the place had functioning and open floo systems like it had when it opened. There hadn’t been the same level of concern on security and travel now was making him hear a little clock ticking away by the second in the back of his mind.
“The crest, yes.”
“How- “He gargled on his uneven breath.
It had been his only defense against Narcissa, each piece absorbing or reflecting some bit of damage. It had still been excruciating, but he had been okay, something his opponent hadn’t counted on when he had sprung to action. He was sure that last spell wouldn’t have gone over well.
Draco was pale and heaving breath by the end of Snapes lecture. He hadn’t noticed. He thought it would be fine. They were just trying to have a good time; thought they would stay in that room all day. They had no plans of leaving all day…
“I won’t have you coming into my home and telling me how to do things! Potter is treated how he should be, no more no less. Now get out!” Vernon boiled over. The Auror’s were not impressed.
He snuck out every night after, bending a wire hanger to unlatch and latch the cupboard’s outside lock and swiping a forgotten spare key from a drawer, no one would miss it. It was the most freedom he’d ever had, and he spent it sitting and waiting in the park on his swing.
Kreacher comes home and Draco is losing a war in his heart.
“You two didn’t bring out a pensive or anything?” Tom jested, but he was now white noise to the boy before him.
Harry blushes and scrubbed his mopey black hair. Why did it have to be piers? Anyone, even another bloke, any bloke would be better than one of his tormentors. It was like Harry was finding ways to punish himself now, make himself more miserable. The revelation of his disposition only added to what the Dursley’s would call his list of faults.
Draco had called Dobby as soon as he’d climbed down from his window. Out of sight of the Grimmauld wards, there was no chance Dobby would feel anything or learn a location. Caution before haste.
“What book?”
“Moody, can you see anything?” Albus tried as they began their sweep.
“Can you tell what it is by the smell yet?” McGonagall whispered to Pomona from behind here.
Bellatrix had been a little girl with a high ponytail and dark rimmed eyes even without makeup when she arrived for her first year of Hogwarts. Sirius and Narcissa a few years older had already found their place among the students and clubs.
“That’s one of the questions isn’t it.” He nodded to the boy.
Quick blip, I'm on youtube and twitch as well as Tumblr though I haven't been on in a while so the art there is old. I have a Patreon I'm still building up so it's more of a tip jar than anything since I can't be paid for fanfics unless its a commission, which I've never done. They are all under the name Shy Leather Man just like my name here.
Draco felt like he was being speared, stabbed and pulled apart slowly, the drag of flesh inside him sent something akin to a picture into his mind of every inch covered and what Harry must look like every time he felt a new throb. Then that member in him rubbed itself against his prostate and he found himself screaming harder than before into his hand as the thing in him simply kept going and sweeping against that spot till he felt the weight of Harry’s hips resting against him.
“Draco, I swear to god if you’re not excited about this too I will banish you from my kingdom.”  He called back before bounding over to the blonde who looked down at his hand curiously. “Sea Glass!” He declared.
Harry nodded, and peaked out from his father’s chest to see Sirius trying to lift the mamba up into his arms regardless of what Tom had just said. He huffed with the effort and Tom quirked a brow at him in amusement.
He turned back to the wardrobe, and as silently as he could he leaned in to grab the small box inside. That was when he felt a sudden jolt of pain, not the normal kind, but real unfiltered pain shooting up his arm and rushing to his other limbs. His mouth shot open and a line of spit flew out, eyes popping wide like he was being crushed in a tight grip. Blood was rushing to his head so fast he thought it might burst. His index finger had only grazed the lid and he was affected. It took half a second for him to hear a shout from the other room as his Mother rushed in, fumbling for her wand or something related in order to help him. Draco blacked out.
Eventually, it had to work. A yell of anger came from behind him a hall way down and made him dive for the small crevice he spied behind a vibrant vermillion red tapestry. The space was not meant for a person, it was barely there as an indent in the wall to make the tapestry run straight along it, but he was skinny and small from malnourishment all his life and Harry knew how to make himself small. Instead of a spell missing again, he heard footsteps charge past him. He held his breath and rolled up into a tight ball for the moment. The steps stopped too close to him for just an instant. Yelling almost made him gasp out by reflex but he held it in tightly, covering the wisps blue glow with his body.
He took the hint and stayed looking down on the book, careful not to disturb the renewed energy around them. “Yes, that sounds great. Is it a secret or do I get to know now?”
“Salt maybe? Sea salt is one of the stronger kinds, it could be trying to counteract and cleanse the solution. It’s not always the right way to find an items affinity.”
__________
“Oh, come on, where’s your curiosity? You live life surrounded by magic and never once wondered where it came from? What other magical races are like beyond their connection to wizards?” Harry argued with more energy than he’d ever had.
“What happened to your glasses?” Sirius scowled in confusion, he hadn’t thought too hard on it, but now that he mentioned it—
Cotton, our little feather whisp of an owl that had been sent on her errand a few hours ago came to her destination. Her fluffy shape nestling into a corner nook of a windowsill at the end of the hidden Lestrange residence.
He was tall and pure white in everything but the outrageously happy lavender purple gown and cap he wore. The gold thread shimmered in diamond patterns and made it look like he was a giant fluffy quilt meant for hugs. Maybe that was the point, with a face that looked more joyous and ready to break into tears than any of these children had probably ever seen; before Sirius and Remus Harry wouldn’t have known just what that look was.
Harry stood up in the freezing cold, his hand pinching the pin between thumb and index finger. Looking around it was clear he wasn’t in England, not anywhere close, with a mountainous range surrounding him. The air was thin and he found himself working to pull in oxygen. The wisp shuddered in mutual thought before it started to tug again.
“Indeed, I can’t imagine the founders left the cornerstone unguarded when they passed on. We’ll no doubt need them to reach it before her if we can’t find her first. By the looks of it, I wouldn’t be surprised. If there’s one thing the Blacks have always had in their blood it’s genius to the point of madness.”
“Harry Potter, Rita Skeeter, writer for the Daily Prophet.” She started, her note pad and camera floating around her in a hypnotizing whirl. “What are your thoughts on your adoptive werewolf parent Remus Lupin—scratch that,” She instructed the self-writing notepad that scribbled furiously. “What was your experience surviving a werewolf attack from your own father.” She swept her hands about as if she was presenting the idea, the mock role of an over enthusiastic actor trying out a part.
“Young lady it isn’t funny to say such things to old men, they might get the wrong idea. If it’s a matter between you and your father than I think the two of you need to be the ones to talk about it.” He chose to elude gently to spare her any unnecessary hurt.
“Let me get this right, why are we all doing this?” Ron let himself get dragged towards the small gathering at the Hogwarts double doors as they opened for the day.
He reaches out for my cheek and my entire body craves his soft touch as I lean into his hand.
My temple is pounding.
I have not worked at all on my book today.  I couldn’t take care of my son when he asked for me.  My husband has been taking care of me all day.  I don’t even have the energy to even see friends.  How am I supposed to give birth and add another child into the mix?  I’m already useless.
Even though I read more now than ever before, I always feel like I don’t know exactly where to look in a bookshop. Do people just choose the prettiest covers, despite the common adage? Am I supposed to amble over to a specific section of interest? The closest one to me is “American Political Theory,” so at least that’s
know why, but it’s annoying.
But it’s only an instant of confusion before there’s gentle prodding and a tentacle slips in, and it’s more tantalizing than Harry even imagined. So full. The wicked promise of a stretch. The helplessness of trusting the Squid to not push him too far. So. Fucking. Full.
The bartender is attending to a couple, so I slip onto a seat at the far end of the bar — isolated enough from other patrons that I don’t invite conversation.
“Oh.”
“Top or bottom?”
“IF YOU’RE NOT DECENT, POTTER, YOU BETTER BE IN FIVE, OR I’LL COME IN AND DRAG YOU OUT!”
That’s the way it is with Harry, he never does anything halfway. It’s all or nothing.
I’ve cried more in the past three days than I have in years.  I feel like I’ve fallen in love with Harry Potter all over again.  Or, as he loves to correct me:  Harry Potter-Malfoy.
Harry lost track of time as they practiced together, as he lost track of where his body began and ended. He’d never felt so connected to another person before, and he wondered if it was the style of dance or his leader. Sex had never felt so intimate, so all-encompassing, and he pondered what else he was missing out on in life.
“Right.”
“What do you think about the thief returning only one of the artefacts?” he asked, aiming to have his voice sound disinterested and his face neutral. Hermione’s eyebrows lifted, and he realised that tricking suspects was much easier than someone who had known him for fourteen years. She knew him better than anyone.
Without fail, the next morning, we’d wake up in one of the dingy rooms above the bar, blindly rummage around for bottles of Hangover Cure on the bedside table, and head back to our own homes to send off an owl to ask an expert.
— spanning his entire back and wrapping around to his chest. Does Harry love any design enough for that level of commitment?
Draco’s face hurt from his grin when they landed, his fingers still curled around the Snitch. Harry hugged him tightly despite losing, and they could feel each other’s heartbeats still racing from the residual energy of the match. Harry had likely given countless victory hugs before, but it was the first time with Draco.
He drummed his fingers on the table, coating the tips with the condensation from his iced latte.
We finish hovering in a diamond formation by our goal posts before landing and waiting for our opponents to take the pitch.
“We won, by the way. 330 to 80.”
“Malfoy! Yes! I heard about your new foundation. This year Durmstrang had its largest class of Muggle-borns yet. Let’s stay in touch so I can help.”
Blaise had learned precisely how to toe the line of Draco’s temper over their years of friendship. The only other person who riled Draco up so quickly was Harry Potter, but it had been months since they last met and longer still since they had talked.
to a drink at a quality establishment.”
All the other rooms look down on me.  Not literally, of course. They just think they get all the good gossip: the bedroom hears the Masters’ nighttime secrets, the sitting room their public conversations, and the entryway always knows first who is visiting.
The maitre d’ showed them to their seats, tied the balloons together above them with a flourish, and then tapped the balloon Harry had chosen for Draco. A shower of green glitter floated through the air, disappearing just before it hit the table. The green balloon, on the other hand, contained reddish-purple glitter.
Maybe someday I’ll be able to share all of that anguish, hope, and desperation that the painting evokes in me with Harry, but not today. He’s made his interest clear in me, despite the meager encouragement I’ve given him, and I wonder if he sees my soul as worthy and light.
He had expected a refusal and started when he felt a hand on his wrist as Draco turned the straw to take a sip.
At twenty-eight, just as I’d been at eleven, I’m astonished by the sheer power and beauty of magic.
The bartender sports the same shockingly teal hair that Teddy prefers. Unlike my godson, I’d need to substantially lighten my own black locks for any dye to take, so I’ve never attempted it, even though Fred and George have been pushing me to try Weasley’s Wizarding Wheeze’s new line of temporary hair color charms. It’s hard to trust them, but would I even look good with blue hair?
tattoos. He’s sure there are more beyond the minimalistic lines like rings on the pale, agile fingers. The ones he now longs to kiss one by one.
Harry looked away as the couple kissed. Despite their differences, they looked like any other couple in love.
For one night, I can have him.
prettily. And fuck, am I here for it. That flush travels slowly down his pale neck as he thoroughly tries to avoid me.
I sit at the desk I hadn’t touched yet today and write my farewell letter.  I write, then erase it all with a wave of my wand, over and over again.  Tears fall onto the parchment, and I can barely see the ink as it flows out of my quill.
He took refuge in the loo as he processed the misunderstanding of the evening. He had two options: admit he wanted it to be a date or try again. He attempted to muster the courage for the first option, but rejection on top of his humiliation? Not today.
“I’ve honestly never painted before. New things and all that.”
Taking a deep breath, he shifts his lower body. There’s a sharp inhale when Draco feels Harry’s arousal, and a quiet, “Fuck.” Pale arms hold him even tighter and thin hips press harder against his. “I-I think that can be arranged.”
“What was there to even leave behind?” He scoffs, bitterness lacing his tone.
Draco finally knelt down.
Which, of course, reminds me that this is
“Are you here with someone? I’m not keeping you from your girlfriend, am I?” Harry asked. If it were anyone else, Draco would have been positive it was a non-subtle way of flirting.
Cursing the Weasleys, he grabbed the bright red fedora with a black trim. The Headless Hat was as tacky as every other product in the joke shop. He tried to charm it black after he had worked tirelessly with Blaise to strengthen the invisibility field beyond the head. He suspected, however, that the twins intentionally made Colour Change Charms incompatible; it was cherry red no matter which incantation he tried.
Well, the only way to know to find out is to ask.
Draco dropped the coin and pulled off his own shirt, folded it neatly, and then ran his hands down his own smooth chest. Having little hair himself, he wondered what it would be like to run his hands over Harry’s pecs.
I woke up alone again today.  Daddy’s still lost, so I don’t look through the house for him.  I just go downstairs.
“What have you told R-E-G-U-L-U-S about Draco L-E-A-V-I-N-G?” Narcissa asks, shooting a glance at the little boy sitting on the sofa to watch the telly.
He trusted Neville with his life, but that didn’t extend to Blaise. Merlin knows Harry himself had dated some bloody awful boyfriends. But talking to either of his friends would have to wait until tomorrow.
The ring’s diamond had been formed from the ashes of witches who had been hanged in the Witch Trials centuries earlier. The ring kept some of their essence, their power, and their desperation. If he hadn’t known the origin story, he would have dismissed its worth entirely. Not that the ring wasn’t beautiful; it just wasn’t particularly impressive. He had seen and owned larger diamonds.
Harry had briefly seen Hermione to return the diadem through Krum. He stated simply that he had got away with it but not caught the thief. Harry felt almost Slytherin with the half-lie, but he knew Hermione had seen him stumble on the word “caught.” He might have spilled it all if he hadn’t seen that Viktor’s pyjama bottoms were backwards and Hermione’s shirt (clearly borrowed), inside out.
This is it: potentially the most important match of my career as a Quidditch player.
Harry swore and winced as the light scars on the hairless torso were revealed. Draco never thought about them anymore; they were just a part of his body. Panic gripped him as he realised Harry had stopped his caresses, his fingers trembling and hovering millimetres over the raised flesh.
A few hours later, I wake up with the baby pressing on my bladder.  I try to move Harry’s arms from around my middle without waking him up, but his arms are so strong that it’s impossible.  He groans and lets go of me.
I read the letter several times.  I feel numb, but I can see that my tears are dripping onto the parchment, blurring the words, and joining the tear stains from when it was written.
He had stayed as busy as possible in the meantime. He had reviewed Asmo’s journals himself, brewed potions for the orphanage he sponsored, and reviewed the ledgers for his investments.
a tease, and still I hold my breath as though that will slow time.
“Do you care if I use magic?”
My fingers tap against my leg as I stare at the map, mentally counting down each stop as though it’ll make the time pass faster.
I picture Reg’s cherubic face: the messy hair he inherited from his other father, the round and rosy cheeks, the big, crooked smile.  I can’t condemn my children to a life with me as their father and watch their spirits dim as they face the real world.
“It’s Potter-Malfoy now.”
“No matter which name you use, you’re still you. You’re the thorn in my side from Hogwarts and you’re the one who has kept me company on what otherwise would have been a very lonely and pathetic Christmas Eve.”
How much time had passed? Where was he? What was that?
I am about to show them the letter just so they can read it for themselves and maybe there’s some message in it that I’m missing, but the letter’s missing.  I look for the trio of youngsters, and sure enough, Rose is slowly sounding out the words on the page for a captive audience.
too early to admit Draco also didn’t want Harry fully clean just yet. He had learned so much about Harry in the span of a few hours and couldn’t wait to learn more. He leaned over to kiss Harry’s forehead just because he now could.
Harry grasped the bottom of his shirt and jumper and pulled up, letting Draco’s hands roam over his chest and moaning as his fingers tweaked one nipple then the other. Harry tugged on the hem of Draco’s top to show that he expected the same access.
“If we are changing our tactic, should we use Draco Malfoy as a double agent?” Percy asked.
—magic.
my mistake. I’ve been making them all evening, all because of those piercing green eyes that are fixated on me, for reasons unknown.
“Fu—” he started before realising that he couldn’t say anything. Harry had the right to date anyone. Draco switched to a terse, “Harry, see you soon... and you too, Flint.”
be joining her, but also gave no indication that he was. Could he be one of the “references”? Draco decided to change once more just in case... after a run and a shower.
Draco decided to take the initiative and ask Harry for a normal friendship outing — something that couldn’t be mistaken as a date. He and Blaise often watched films together, so the cinema would be a good starting point. Maybe he could include dinner? He had a place he needed to try for work.
“Harry, I-I’ll be there as soon as I can.”
“We’re going shopping! We need clothes!” Pansy waltzed into their room.
“Nah.”
October 16th is our anniversary. Three years together, Two and a half filled with amazing, sweaty, screaming orgasms. (Less so in the last six months, to be clear.)
They both sat in companionable silence, listening to the crackling of the fire and sipping their tea.
“Love you, Draco,” he slurs and turns over to go back to sleep.  He’s snoring again within minutes.  I don’t know if he’s even aware of what he said.
Harry’s eyebrows knit as he struggled to assimilate competing memories and fill in the gaps. He sank to his heels and ran his hands over his face and Draco’s knees bent as if to follow the gesture, but what if Harry felt uncomfortable with him now, after everything?
“This feels like a date,” Harry whispered without thinking.
“Of course they are, Harry. A new antique is an oxymoron. Where do you think I buy most of our decor?”
His confidence wavered when Harry came in for a quick hug as they met at the entrance to the restaurant.
“He asked you on that date.”
++ /* ++
“…I would go see you play,” I admit.
“Celebrating something?”
? The maître d’ owes me a favour.” Mother and my friends will last a night or two without me. Harry shouldn’t have to beg for my attention.
It was light, tentative, and tasted like the açaí they had eaten. It was a warm press of the lips and then over all too soon.
Master Potter thoughtfully scans my furnishings: toilet, towel racks, spacious bathtub, mirror, and sink. As his eyes pass over the running water, I turn it off, even though Master Malfoy really
Not that the house-elves would have abided by the mess in this room. There’s an empty champagne bottle rolled under an accent chair, currently adorned by a pair of black boxer briefs hanging off its arm.
“You can’t run forever rat! I know every inch of this place and you will be lost even with that little guide of yours!” He heard the voice grow distant as he began to run again in the only direction Harry could have gone. “I will not let a muggle leave knowing our magic exists!”
Harry didn’t need to be told twice and made a break for it. He heard the usual speech echo after him into his hiding place.
“It’s alright you know. I’m used to it.” Harry placed his hand over Draco’s grip and the blonde stopped.
He’d been chasing the dark-haired boy up and down every staircase and hallway in Hogwarts and it was finally paying off. In truth it already had, he’d never been happier, never been farther from the reality of his life and responsibilities that loomed not far behind.
“The Goblins. That is quite unusual, let me check him over.” Tom sent out a flash of green that left a film like glow over Harry’s skin and pulled back to twine itself into a piece of parchment. “That is very unusual.” He muttered; shoulders slowly relaxing.

“Some would, but I aim for higher goals. It is my way. Mine and Albus.”
___________________________________________
He tugged at Draco as he tried to breathe through a closing throat, silently cough into a fist. He refocused as soon as he was placed in front of the shelf, the disgust still present, but he could try and look past the smaller sized gore. He could tell it was all things his Aunt loved. Locks of hair in the colors he liked. Glittering jewelry pinned up on hooks or rings resting on dead fingers sewn into a bowl that could hold an equal number of earrings. He knew at least one of those fingers by the polish on it, had been another Death Eaters, he could remember Bellatrix remarking about it years ago. The complement on the other woman’s hands had been memorable even now due to her unique liberties on what a complement was supposed to be.
Crabbe, Zabini, Pansy and Ron seemed content with their job of defending their operation against the twins and Harry and Draco took the opportunity to get behind the two red heads in order to surprise attack them. The glint of joy and recognition on the groups face tipped the twins off. They whirled around just in time and shoved the couple together face first. It was unclear if they meant to headbutt them together or smoosh them into a kiss, they teased either way. The two younger boys rubbing their foreheads in matching grimaces.
“Language.” Someone said, Harry couldn’t see who, he had guessed Minerva…
“You should know something!” He gasped out as a bolt of what looked like lightning missed him by a head.
“Kreacher is humbled by the Dirty traitor master.” He grouched lowly, Harry watched with wide eyes as the short man popped out of sight with a snap and a flash of light. Sirius seemed to mumble a few curses under his breathe.
“It’ll be fine Draco. If it helps, I can stay up so you can sleep first without worrying about me.” He turned on his side more to wrap his arms around Draco in return and only then did the other relax.
She had snuck in before I’d gotten there one day. She had gone up earlier that day so she knew the password. When I opened the door to the chambers Albus was tied down to his chair by a binding spell and her wand was poking at him as she waited. I watched her try to stab it through his cheek and the next moment before I knew what was happening, they were looking back at me.
“Bring something he’s worn for me to cast blood hound on.” Tom called after him.
It felt strange, like something should be different now, but neither knew how to change it after they had only just found how they liked to be together. They danced around the new romantic intention between them, a failed attempt at hand holding ended in them braking apart before anyone could see. Harry could tell Draco was nervous of anyone seeing him like that.
“You act like it working out is the scarier fate.” Harry’s joke fell flat in both their ears.
“Draco.” Harry stated plainly.
__________
“It’s like my own magic.” He said under his breath.
“Because all wizards are ridiculous as I’m sure you’ve begun to discover.” Hermione joked and Harry nodded in agreement as seriously as possible.
Warning for some sexual content. We finally got some going, hope it'll be a good taste of what we're in for.
Draco dusted himself off and made for the door, leading them out towards a courtyard. Harry could instantly smell the sea salt air as it was buffeted by fortress walls. He was glad he’d bundled up a bit extra for this, the sheer ocean wind would likely deafen and freeze him solid once they made it to the sand. Making way past the gate keep and several tourists taking the weekend to bring their children, Harry could spot one or two attractions laid out along the grounds sed children had rushed over to happily. The gray walls opened up to sedated blue sky and a sheer drop down a cliff lined with a way down. The expanse making him pull in a deeper breath involuntarily.
Harry’s labored breaths grew a bit deeper as his lungs slowly release their seized muscles. Laying across the living room’s worn sofa, he watched passively as the others took seats in the adjacent armchairs. Without his glasses he was practically blind and he let his unfocused eyes lull him half-asleep as he watched the soft shapes settle.
“The weirdest.” Sirius agreed.
The wisp lit up then, bright. Disturbingly bright considering their situation and Harry dove forward to cover it with his chest in alarm. It wriggled against him and tried to escape almost feverishly.
“He looked like he was having a seizure, he said it wasn’t anything that made sense. He tried to sleep walk to the front door before you arrived tonight, I was worried it was getting worse. I shouldn’t have left him, this is my fault, again.” Draco was sucking in air harshly. Dobby was shaking and incoherent next to him, kneeling beside him.
It was just another day where they were having fun and getting writing cramps from too many notes like every day before. Knee deep in study time with instructions to start up the semesters cumulative assignment that would predate the exams before the first break for holiday.
“Just because I didn’t cut him or Narcissa out of my life does not mean I walk the same path. I tolerated his choice and made peace, even friends with Narcissa if my guardianship over Draco is any indication. Things still never really healed though…” He shook his head to himself. It had been a different time back then, different people. “Now it’s too late isn’t it?”
Stepping out with his bag they waited for Milton who came after a few agonizing minutes. He left a speechless Dursley family in his wake, whatever he did left them pale as ghosts. Roody pointed wordlessly to the cupboard and that was all Milton seemed to need.
“Call me that in public and I really will have to beat you up.” Draco slammed the compartment’s door as he retreated.
“You are, you just don’t like advertising your weakness.” Harry countered as a Goodbye.
It was that thought that lead her to Hogwarts now, that led her past the wards and onto the grounds where she would slip in and begin her search. She knew all of Bella’s tricks having been there every step of her education and training, that included shrouds and concealment. It had never been enough to impress Bella, but maybe this would. This was Narcissa’s moment to earn true and glowing praise from her sister and that thought spurred on her every step.
Back at headquarters Tom sat across from Lucius with a qualified healer who had taken far too long in their mandatory screening. The platinum blonde hair of the Malfoy lord was untied and dangling over him like a small curtain, his eyes glazed over from where the healer was shifting through his mind. He could see the grey band of color eclipse with overly dilated pupils as the search continued deeper into his subconscious. With each ticking second of his pocket watch open and in hand Tom grew just a bit more nervous as to the reason this evaluation was taking so long.
“I was wondering.” Harry muttered under his breath softly. “If, since we don’t have to be anywhere for the rest of the day, if you’d just want to maybe stay here and hide with me?”
Harry choked on a gasp and shook uncontrollably, only spurring on the inner voices and their insults.
“And I got us everything we need to make a Christmas tree. We’ve never done Christmas before! Everyone always told me it was too muggle, Ha!” Sirius beamed up at Harry with a wide grin.
“Guess we’re guarding the exit.” Harry half joked and Remus huffed out as he inched a bit closer to him and Draco.
“You know what I’m talking about. The eleventh century and beyond. Living long enough to know everything. To solve every problem. To make love under the stars till they flare out around us and the whole world ends and starts again.”
“Why do you always run! We just walked at least a mile! I thought I finally wore you out!” The blonde complains from behind him.
“Good. That was horrifying, never do it again.” He laughed as he pushed Harry to get down and crawl into the small opening of the fire pit below before offering the powder again. “And for the record I did say you could ask anything, not that I’d do it.”
“Guess we’re three down, they’ll be unconscious all night. Everyone is exhibiting mild hallucination, numbing and lack of motor skills as well. Wiping the oil clean on our clothes doesn’t get rid of what needs a good washing or what’s already in our bodies.” Tom said from where he had rallied everyone. “Those of us the most effected need to stay behind and can watch over the incapacitated school staff. Unfortunately, we’re all taking things pretty bad from this one. Sound off and we’ll do a retest to figure out our numbers.”
“I don’t dream walk or the like sorry, but it’s not one of my personal skills. The facts are as I describe, she has guided you to interfere in the current path of events to avoid a specific future. Everything from your dream, to me, to saving those two men in love are a part in it. They would not be together if not for you, Albus and the end of the Gryffindor line would not be here if not for you. I know what I’ve played a part in, but nothing more, nothing that would risk another turn of fate in the wrong direction. My favor is that you trust Caer, let her do her work through you so that the dreams do not become reality.”
“It’s not good Moony.”
It was then he finally realized what he had been smelling since entering the room, the smell of soil and moisture secondary to the orchard like scent. A strong presence of red apple, an indicator for mandrake they had all overlooked as they had been so focused on the visuals. Pomona should have known though, should have realized. No, not if she was nose blind from working with her plants in the greenhouse again.
“A small exit, but I don’t get your thinking.” Draco gripes where he’s squashed himself beside his muggle as he looks around a bit frantically.
“Don—loo—li—tha—t.” Harry tried and choked on each word, bring Sirius back to the present. Harry was squinting hard enough to make an almost angry expression just to see him. Remus was the first with presence of mind to lower his now unneeded wand and rush forward to bring Harry into his arms.
“Will you want him less?” His love’s voice not judgmental in the least.
“You are sure, leaving such a stone unturned?” He asked softly.
“Thank you mister Weasley.” Harry choked out as he accepted a too long handshake. The foreign concern had made him cling to Roody, he was gentle; and if Roody was gentle then Mr. Weasley was what Harry imagined Santa Clause was like, Jolly. His eyes hurt from staring unblinking with big eyes at the man that only seemed to indulge the moment with an ever-brighter smile.
“Now, I can’t let something like that stand.” Draco smirked as he scooped Harry up in his arms to secure him chest to chest. The friction of cotton trapped between them pulled at Harry’s attention as Draco leaned down to press their lips together.
“What about me?”
“No, not after losing you… You know that. I was never the kind forgiving type.”
Five days left till break Harry and Draco found themselves fortified in a corner room of the dungeons left for storing extra tables, chairs, and the odd decoration the grounds keeper Filch could access whenever he needed. They had situated the identifier solution along a buffet length table to go down the line up of samples from the beach and write down their properties.
“I never had a friend before.” He managed to get the words out during Ron’s struggle. Ron looked at the boy curling himself against his front as he pulled them to the bathroom.
There was a time Harry used to dream and wish that one day he’d be taken away from here when his parents came back for him. On his eleventh birthday he made that wish one more time and as he waited for a knock on the front door outside. As sleep took him in his cupboard his heart broke.
A light reflecting off the freshly falling snow made it look like his world was on fire with embers in the dank street maze of a city whose name he’d already forgotten after combing so much of Britain and Europe connected to the Death Eaters. He had lost track of the splintered groups as they ran into even deeper hiding with one of their generals captured. That hadn’t done much though, even with a truth serum she had contingencies to prevent him from finding what she stole all those years ago.
One week later the house elf delivered his things and they were off. They trudged outside the school’s barriers that prevented transport spells. With an excited grip on the innocent looking book he could stow anywhere in their dorm from now on he cast the spell with his unsanctioned wand. Their forms twisted into the core of a black hole that unfolded them in a whirlwind onto the wet grass of a field outside the muggle city.
“Don’t need em’.” He wheezed, when he heard the crunch of her heeled boot dig into the lens’ he cringed. “That wasn’t an invitation to break them.” He complained partly to himself.
Dolores seethed as she wrote out the requested paperwork for an Auror team under Tom as a taskforce. She had given up arguing when she was threatened with being kicked out of the room. Now she was just thinking of a way to sabotage their efforts without hinting that she was the informant.
Harry thought on it, he thought it the most when looking at Piers though. One day of staring too many without Harry even realizing brought with it his fear.
As soon as the unknown wizard took a step in, Harry had hit him with a Stunner. Either it was a trap, or they had barely beaten VILE to the cathedral.
He smirked as he adjusted his emerald green bow tie in the mirror. He ran a hand over his hair, the signature platinum gleaming in the light. While he didn’t admire his father for his views, he did admire his father’s style. Both Malfoy men maintained their hair’s silkiness with a pomade brewed from a secret family recipe.
They stumbled in their haste to reach a secluded area of the park. Under the branches of a weeping willow, Harry took Draco in his arms roughly and apparated them directly to his bedroom. He was already pulling off Draco’s top when they landed.
Draco apparated them to a small alleyway. He looked up at the sky, and then they wended their way through the streets, looking for a place they could get a room. Harry looked up as well and saw the tip of a clock tower and guessed it was what his partner was using to orient himself.
The rest of the garden was equally impressive and full of exotic plants shaped into intricate hearts. As with any high-profile event, he assumed there had been a team working on customising the entire garden for this wedding.
Harry stared at the mess of papers on his desk and could almost hear Hermione’s chiding tone asking how he expected to work effectively. He peeked at the neighbouring desk and grinned, feeling better. Ron’s was always worse.
A shiver ran down his spine. The man not only looked like Potter, but
Three songs passed before his friend came back to his side. Then someone came to speak to Neville, so they didn’t get to talk about how much Harry wanted to try it and how nervous he felt.
Morgan and Devlin. Draco remembered hearing complaints about them over wine one night when
He wiped his brow and neck with a handkerchief, frowning as he tried to decide how best to expend the residual adrenaline. Even though he logically knew it had to be early, he checked the time for confirmation:  5:42 PM. Too early to go to a bar or a club and meet someone. A run, then.
from this.
Questions and communication will have to wait.
and turns out he only used one scoop of chocolate!  One!”
“Is this... hmm... lavender?” Harry asked, his mouth full of the sweet.
Harry ran to grasp his arm, the Invisibility Cloak sliding off his body as he did so. He wrapped his hand around Draco’s bicep, feeling the muscles move under his fingertips as the blond shot once... twice... at the figures that appeared in the doorway.
Even Harry is surprised when his Boggart takes form. It takes a few minutes for him to react, to transform it with a sharp, if breathy, “Riddikulus!”
Another piece of the puzzle that still didn’t seem to fit was the bright red hat seen at the second scene. The security guards could not describe anything definitive besides that hat. Why a hat? Why red? Was it not one thief but an organisation with the hat as part of their statement?
I hear the shuffle of papers, and I see my husband organizing the drawings on my desk in the corner of the room.  He never organizes his own work, but he knows how important organization is to me, so he will clean mine.
Picking up the book that thrums with the magic that made it choose me, I take the stairs two at a time to check out the bar. Hermione will appreciate the picture, and if I’m ever going to drink, today is the day.
“You don’t say! Fred would’ve loved that. We tried for months when developing it. Drop by the shop sometime and we can talk it through.”
Harry nearly choked. He had only met Zabini post-Hogwarts a few times, but it was obvious the flirty and cocky wizard had rubbed off on his former housemate. Seeing his friend so happy, he figured it wasn’t the time and place to voice the concerns he still had.
“And ‘we’ is…?”
Harry’s mind went blank — dumbfounded.
Oliver squeezes my shoulder as the rest of the team lines up behind us. We might be rivals in the National League, but today we’re a united front, playing for the bragging rights of our country (and of course, the 10,000 Galleons each that go to each of the winning team members).
Oh. Now the straws are out of alignment. I need to fix those.
If he hadn’t fixated on Harry, he could have enjoyed the night, but now he just wanted to return home and lick his wounds in peace. (And maybe wank to the memory of Harry’s arms around him.)
“Harry, but... what about...?”
“Why?”
“Oh.”
Finally, we arrive. Pushing my way off the train savagely, I run through the gates and bypass the escalator to take the stairs two by two.
“OK, Daddy.”
“Potter! The Salem Ring was returned!” Moreau could not contain her excitement as she passed a steaming mug to Harry.
And there, across the street, I see my family: Mother’s hair, still the brilliant blonde I’ve always remembered even if I doubt it’s natural anymore. She’s holding onto a small child with mousy brown hair, as she laughs at something her sister says.
Draco smiled his first genuine smile of the night. Only a Gryffindor would be so bold. Maybe he would be playing with fire, but what harm could one night of fun do?
His world had reduced to Draco, his warm hands, his lean chest, his quiet instructions. He knew his leader wouldn’t let him crash into anyone or expect him to do a complicated step. They could just be.
He saw a glimpse of something sparkling in the light and heard an audible gasp. The bride had arrived with her jewel-encrusted diadem.
Draco turned at the noise of the body falling to the ground, and he wasn’t the only one as another wizard rushed in, just to also be taken down by Harry.
“Er… well, I am. Here, that is.” Does he sound as stupid as he feels? He holds out the crumpled parchment with the final design. “I want this.”
know that, and he does want the tattoo. Or at least he thinks he does. Pretty sure. Maybe 60/40?
understand. It was hard in the outdoor space, where sound carried differently and the guests numbered in the hundreds, but with some concentration and a few minutes of exploring the area, he spotted a trio speaking in English and a couple speaking in French. He put on his businessman smile and sauntered over to the trio.
and reveal his feelings.
“Okay,” Harry replied, gripping his wand, monitoring the entrances for any sign of a wizard. He had only seen Muggles pass by.
The Squid loosens its hold just enough for Draco to slide his hand between them. In concert, Draco’s hand wraps around their cocks and a slimy limb parts Harry’s cheeks to slide enticingly over his entrance. His eyes lose focus as he gasps, back arching as he calls out for more.
“As soon as I’m done with cleaning up, I can go.”
“Can we dance again?”
. Only Hermione would remember what book she’s read where.
form if you weren’t there to see it. I don’t fear it, but more…er…what it represents.”
“Go where?”
I want to respond, but I don’t want to betray that I’m awake.  I can’t face him and lose my nerve.  There’s a reason he’s the hero, and I’m not.
“Tradition,” Harry whispered in a low voice in Draco’s ear as he pulled him into his chest.
I won’t let Reg sleep alone tonight, but I know it’s actually more for me than it is for him.  He feels so small curled into my side.
I go back into the master bedroom, where I see he’s left a glass of water on my bedside table.  I take a sip and lie down yet again.
Draco only became aware again when Harry slipped off his lap, his body collapsing on the bed with a loud thump.
Nothing can ever really happen between us beyond the walls of this hotel room. After all, Wizarding Britain would lose its shit if we are ever so much as
“You’ll look good in Slytherin colours,” Draco whispered in Harry’s ear and watched his boyfriend shiver. He smirked then added, “If you’re cold, maybe you should put it on.”
As fate would have it, James was also his roommate.
!” a small woman exclaimed, coming over to hug both of them, even though Harry had never met her before. “Since you’re new, I’d recommend being a follower for now, and if you like it, we can teach you to lead.”
“What if it’s like security experts in the Muggle world? Someone hacks or breaks into a system to show its flaws,” he countered.
“Yeah — everyone else is all coupled up, so it’s nice to not feel like a third wheel, for once.”
Pride infused Draco’s body:
“Hey Mione.” He greeted her with a kiss on the cheek as he nicked a chocolate biscuit.
“I can’t watch, and I can’t look away. It’s not Schrödinger’s cat anymore. It’s Malfoy’s crush,” Ginny added.
Harry’s hand grasps mine, warm to the touch as we descend the marble stairway, and I don’t focus on the lion sculptures or the paintings on the walls because his fingers are deliciously calloused. I’m not sure how I’ve lived without feeling that roughness against my skin for so long.
I am sick on a bush somewhere on the way home, but keep going.
Unexpectedly, he swears. A long stream of “fucking hells” and “there’s no fucking ways” and it hits me that he cut off all contact with the Wizarding world when he’d moved. The Ministry acquitted him and his mother of all charges after the War, and then he’d disappeared. Apparently, he went to the Muggle world, a full ocean away.
And then I see the Snitch.
He only had 5 minutes to finish the mission and counteract the wards. He listened to Blaise’s suggestions on how to disable each charm. The first few fell quickly, but the red turned out to be harder to break through.
“Sounds great,” Harry responded with a smile that made Draco’s heart stutter. His entire body felt lighter, and he could have sworn the wine tasted better.
“Oh,” Harry said when he saw his and Draco’s room, “Er... they must’ve made a mistake. There’s only one bed.”
After a while, he asks. “Are we going to discuss how your charm chose for me a ‘rivals to lovers’ story? That’s clearly not a coincidence, and I’m sure you trust your own magic.”
“Harry.”
It’s after midnight when I stumble through the Floo. I’m not exactly drunk, but tipsy enough not to risk Apparition. I’ve given Harry enough shit for Apparating after a night at the Leaky, so I feel the need to set an example.
The eldest Weasley kids were still the friendliest, given that they hadn’t known Draco personally at Hogwarts. On the other hand, Ron was not subtle about avoiding him or pointedly only talking to Harry.
Dad knows the way, and we end up in an office that isn’t Dad’s.  Dad argues with the man working there until the man places a chipped mug on the desk in between him and my dad.  Dad picks me up and uses the hand that still holds mine to touch it.
“You can leave now, you mean?”
The waiting was torture now that he knew there were only... two hours and thirteen minutes until Hermione would arrive. He had changed outfits six times, unable to decide how he wanted to present himself. He had even baked biscuits to serve, then frantically aired out the sweet smell from the flat so he could claim he had bought them at a bakery. Malfoys weren’t domestic.
He laughs around the sensitive tip, and my hips arch up off the bed.
finger.”
He’s so capable that I often wonder if he really needs me.  He rarely says the words except in bed in an “I need you now” way, which doesn’t count.
Everything about Boston so far has been unexpected. Not the Muggle tourists in Red Sox gear or the insistence of everyone I’ve met that I need to order a clam chowder. But everything after meeting Draco Malfoy at the bookstore has been like a fantasy come to life.
Hovering just beyond Harry’s shoulder, he saw a flash of movement. Draco lowered his body, crouching over the handle of his broom and drawing his elbows towards his torso. He hurtled towards the other Seeker, who lost precious seconds before turning to see what Draco was targeting.
Harry sent off a Patronus to his friend, and Draco was jealous of the ethereal stag that bounded away. He had failed the last time he tried to conjure one. The memory he used to use of his eighth birthday party had become bittersweet over the years as his relationship with his parents deteriorated.
Harry shrugged. “I just thought they’d look nice together. D’you reckon it would be rude to use my fingers?”
“Yeah! We’ll look for Daddy!” Dad reaches out to ruffle my hair.
On the outside, Draco remained unphased while his mind ran in circles to determine why they’d come.
“I see you, Little Dragon. The special exhibitions wing has six security guards, two in the room with the ring. The others would need at least 5 minutes to arrive. Should be easier than the last mission,” a mischievous voice echoed in Draco’s ear as he pulled on dragonhide gloves.
They reached Arpoador, the area between two of the city’s most famous beaches. It was already crowded, but they found a space to sit on the rocks with other couples. After all, Harry didn’t mind if they had to sit a little closer.
“Then I’ll be heading home. The T stops running soon, and I live on the outskirts of the city.” Okay, so my train doesn’t actually stop running until 1 AM, and it’s only 11 PM, but tourists don’t know that.
Sure, love was powerful. The entire Wizarding World had seen that with Harry’s survival. But, Draco didn’t love Jame-Harry (not yet, at least), and they certainly weren’t meant to be. Movies were just movies.
“So, what exactly are reddish-purple foods? Beets? You definitely got the more traditional option,” Harry laughed.
A year turned into two. Then two into three. Now, ten years later, I’ve stopped looking for something more fulfilling for a career. Quidditch is enough.
When Harry got home, he immediately walked to the bathroom, stripped, and drew a bath for himself. It was his first actual break after days of long hours, and he was determined to enjoy it. Worse, he would leave for Cairo in the morning to review the crime scene, so it promised to be yet another long day.
I start towards the entrance, and look over my shoulder at Harry Potter, still sitting at the end of the bar, leaning against the dark wood with one brow hovering over the frame of his glasses. As haughtily as I can manage, I ask, “So which posh hotel are you taking me to?”
Harry grabbed his hand to bring him through the crowd to a couch, and Draco marvelled at the casual touch in front of Harry’s family and friends. His parents had an arranged marriage and rarely showed physical affection in front of others, not even him.
Draco’s hands trembled. He appreciated that Harry took the initiative because he wasn’t sure if he had the courage to make the first move. He struggled to keep his nerves in check. What if they weren’t sexually compatible, or what if he embarrassed himself and came too early?
He wondered if he should reach out now that he was back home, to see if he’d been mistaken. For work, of course, and not only to see the pale face with stormy grey eyes.
Channeling his memories of a younger Malfoy, he leaves the shop as haughtily as possible.
He lifted his head to look into the slightly unfocused green eyes.
“It sounds crazy, right?” Draco’s heart seized a little at the apparent disbelief. Blaise and Longbottom thought this would be easy because they weren’t the ones who had to convince Harry. He sighed, “The hairpiece stolen in London was them. We had seen it written, but did not put two and two together until we saw the news.”
