Whispering a protection charm and a lubrication charm on his rigid cock, Draco then plunged his whole impressive length deep into Harry. Harry moaned his name loudly and immediately started to beg Draco to move. Draco complied, riding him hard and deep until Harry was screaming his name in pleasure. He then flipped the dark haired man over so he could see his face as he ploughed him. His facial expressions were even more erotic than when he was masturbating which made Draco even more turned on. Harry's cock was an angry red and dripping all over his flat stomach as it begged for release. It was too much for Harry as he reached down to pump it as he was getting fucked, only to have his hand be slapped away by his new lover.
"Yes." Draco said simply as he smiled. It was probably the first genuine smile that Harry had ever saw on his face.
"I love you, too." He replied to the now-empty room as he finished getting dressed and slowly made his own way to lunch.
As soon as the dilapidated door was shut, silencioed, and locked firmly, Harry's lips were on his. He pushed Draco up against the back of the door roughly, eliciting an excited moan from him in the process. Tongues fiercely battled as they ripped their clothes off. They couldn't seem to get enough of each other as hands caressed, pinched, and groped anywhere they could reach. Finally naked, Harry threw Draco down on the bed and attacked him once again with kisses before slowly making his way down his chest, making sure to pay extra attention to the pretty pink and super sensitive nubs on his way down. Draco moaned at the wet tongue that was swirling around his hard nipple and Harry lightly nipped it with his teeth before switching to the other side and giving that nipple the same treatment.
"Tilly!" Narcissa called suddenly. A loud crack swiftly followed and a young-looking house elf appeared.
"Please take Mr. Potter's belongings up to Draco's room. You can put them away as well." Narcissa requested, not unkindly. Tilly just bowed again in response before walking over to take Harry's trunk.
"It's your fault!" Ginny rounded onto Draco. "If it wasn't for you corrupting Harry then we would have ended up together. Before you we were well on our way to being happy forever." Draco scoffed.
Draco was worried. The way Harry had talked about them he knew that even if they had a hint of Harry having a boyfriend they would do their best to cut him off from the wizarding world to 'stamp out this nonsense'. They eschewed anything not considered 'normal' in their suburban muggle beliefs and being gay fell under that rather large umbrella. Ron and Hermione seemed to share his worries on that subject, but unfortunately they too were powerless to do anything about it. Dumbledore in his infinite 'wisdom' insisted Harry go back at least until he was of age to make his own decisions and wizarding law backed him up on it.
"But it is, Harry. It's exactly like that. The way she treats you like you don't have a choice is toxic. The rumors she spread to try to get you to date her is toxic behavior. Everyone in her family just lets her get away with it and you do too. Someone needs to let her know that it isn't okay, and if I have to do it to protect you I will."
"Nothing." Harry blushed as he replied.
"I know." Narcissa stated. Draco just gaped at her with his mouth slightly ajar. She laughed in response. "You've only obsessed over him since you met him. He's all you talk about over your holidays and I've noticed that you haven't written anything about him in your letters recently. I also saw the way you looked at him at the train station."
When it came to the conversation on previous sexual experience, Draco felt lacking. He hadn't been with anyone before Harry, but Harry had confided that he had messed around with Seamus a few times the previous year. This was how he had learned the impressive oral skills that had wowed Draco the first time they were together. Draco's ego was gratified with the surprise that Harry had shown when he told him that he was his first. After their stolen hours on Sunday, they typically had to rush back to their respective common rooms for the week to repeat itself. They spent many weeks with this schedule.
"Umm...well...I just wanted to say sorry. This..." he motioned back towards the Great hall "...is why I turned you down. I already knew I had feelings for him." Harry replied honestly. Her tears just started to fall faster.
"I..It's nice to meet you too, Mrs. Malfoy. You have a lovely home." Harry replied as politely as he could.
Harry meets Narcissa for the first time and some naughty shower shenanigans happen.
Draco and Harry learn more about each other
"I know." Harry replied cheekily and kissed him.
"No, I don't like her. I don't like how she hangs all over you, I don't like how she spread rumors all over the school, and I especially don't like that whenever she is horrible to you it just gets shrugged off and instantly forgiven. She acts like a spoiled little kid and you are her toy that no one else can touch and it sickens me." Draco's chest was heaving in rage.
"What did you figure out?" Draco queried.
"I have to say, I sure am glad that you're out of there Harry. I still have no idea what Dumbledore was thinking by sticking you with those people." Ron said as they climbed the stairs.
"They look wonderful, Harry. Do thank Molly for me. We shall have them with tea later." Narcissa smiled again before leading Harry and her son to the private residence wing of the manor.
"Only because she's going around telling everyone who will listen that you are." Draco stated. Harry sighed heavily.
Continuing his trek down Draco's chest and stomach, Harry completely ignored his boyfriend's achingly hard cock. Instead he trailed his wet tongue directly to Draco's tight virgin ass. Draco jumped in surprise but soon relaxed as Harry leisurely rimmed him. It wasn't the first time Harry had played with his back entrance. After the first time they had sex, he often would insert a digit into Draco while sucking his cock, and Draco had found he enjoyed it. It wasn't long before Harry had Draco moaning and begging Harry to pay attention to his needy dick.
"Thank you everyone, then. Happy?" He replied without venom as he loosened his hold on Harry. After the initial surprise, Draco had loosened up and genuinely began to enjoy himself. He got a bit tipsy while playing some drinking games, but Harry cut him off after a while.
"I love you too." Draco responded before kissing him once more and letting sleep take him as well.
"Fuck, Harry. I'm going to cum in your mouth if you don't stop now. Oh, merlin if I knew you were this talented I would've figured out how to get you in bed months ago. Harry! I'm cumming!" Draco exclaimed right before he emptied directly into Harry's eager mouth. Harry moaned and swallowed squirt after squirt of the hot jizz he had only dreamed of tasting. After Draco was done cumming, Harry continued to lick the still-hard cock of his rival turned lover until Draco pulled away. Harry looked disappointed at losing his new favorite toy.
Draco enjoyed the sight of the sexy guy in front of him flushed from desire and furiously pumping his cock to a fantasy that was presumably about himself before a whispered 'Draco' gave him the opening he needed.
"It's not like that...." Harry protested.
Harry Potter was acting suspicious. One minute, they were having one of their many daily after class bouts of insult exchanges, the next Harry was walking away. His face was still flushed from anger and the argument was nowhere near done, but he just walked away. Draco was puzzled and irritated at the same time. How dare he just leave?
"Y..you don't know that!" Ginny had gone pale but refused to give up her fantasy of a perfect life with Harry. Draco wrapped his arm around Harry's waist and smiled as he felt him instantly melt into him before replying:
"Yes! Draco, I'm cumming!" Harry cried out almost instantly after he felt the digit finally enter him. Draco smiled around Harry's cock, but didn't let Harry pull out of his mouth. A few seconds later, Harry blasted rope after rope of hot cum directly into his willing boyfriend's mouth. Draco swallowed all he gave him eagerly. There was so much that he could barely keep up, but he didn't let any escape.
"Draco, please! Please let me cum." He begged. Draco only leaned down and kissed him hard in response. Harry ardently returned the kiss, and the tangle of tongues seemed to be all he needed as his cock started to forcefully spurt his pent up need all over both his and Draco's chests. Draco followed soon after, cumming for the second time that night directly into Harry's well-used and sloppy back entrance.
"The school is going to go bananas tomorrow when they find out we're together." Harry replied then started to laugh so hard that tears came to his eyes.
"Let them, I thrive on the chaos." Draco replied with a slightly evil grin.
After he deemed himself as presentable as he could be, he ran back downstairs to be met with a hoard of red-topped curious faces. With a flush he realized he hadn't actually said anything before scarfing his food and bolting up the stairs. He quickly explained to them the contents of the letter and asked for permission for the floo to be connected. Molly said yes then immediately began to bake as 'it wasn't polite to visit empty-handed'. The twins on the other hand began to tease him about his eagerness and how he cleaned up to meet his mother-in-law. Harry blushed an even deeper scarlet at the thought that she might really be his mother-in-law someday. Too soon Harry grabbed his trunk and Molly's brownies, stepped into the fireplace, and yelled 'Malfoy Manor' as clearly as he could while throwing the floo powder into the flames.
Draco readily complied, swiftly removing his fingers and plunging his entire length deep into his lover. They moaned loudly in unison as Harry's heat wrapped tightly around Draco's thick shaft. Draco was in heaven, nothing could describe the feeling of being balls deep in his Harry as he begged for more. Draco set a punishing pace as he thrust hard into his lover, stabbing his prostate on every thrust. Harry was almost sobbing in pleasure and soon he could only barely hold himself up as he continued to take his boyfriend's long cock. He was calling Draco's name in between moans and he didn't care how wanton he sounded.
"But why?!" She wailed loudly. "We're meant to be together, Harry. It's just a matter of time! I knew you were shy and a bit slow on the uptake, but I thought you knew that!" She started sobbing uncontrollably into her hands. Harry was at a loss. He had no idea how to comfort her or even if he should, and absolutely no idea what he should say.
Unfortunately, it was all too soon after Draco's birthday that it was time to go home for the summer. This posed two problems: the first being the distance of separation for the first time since they finally became a couple; the second being the fact that Draco desperately didn't want Harry to have to go back to those abusive muggles that were called Harry's family. Harry had not come of age yet, which meant that he had no choice but to go back at least for the first few weeks of summer holiday before his birthday in mid-July.
Draco is found out by his mother and Harry's last summer vacation before his seventeenth birthday.
The usually calm Draco Malfoy was nervous. He was desperately hoping Harry's first impression of his home was a good one considering one day he wanted them to live there together. He knew the 'public' spaces of his house were pretentious, having been told so by his friends in the past. His father had said they were that way on purpose, to elicit fear and awe from potential business partners and to bring glory to the Malfoy name. Seeing it through Harry's eyes, Draco couldn't help but think the foyer was as pompous as his father with an ego to match. With relief, he spotted his mother walking towards them with her usual elegantly unhurried gait.
Harry felt like he would never be able to stand again. He was so blissfully exhausted that Draco had to wash them both as it took all Harry had to continue standing. Draco didn't mind though. He was happy as long as he got to be near Harry. After they were clean, Draco dried them both with magic before tucking his sleepy boyfriend into bed. He laid next to him after extinguishing the lights, pulling him close and whispering words of love as they both fell into a deep and peaceful slumber.
Draco was livid when he had learned of the abusive conditions that he had been left in before he came to school. He had no idea what had possessed Dumbledore, who was not only the most powerful but supposed to be the wisest wizard of their age, to put a defenseless young wizard (who had just saved the world) into the hands of muggles who hated his very existence. Draco had always known the man was a bit off his rocker, but this was a new level. All he could do was hold Harry close in attempt to comfort his dark haired boyfriend because he didn't know what to say.
"How was Hogwarts this year, Draco? Tell me everything." his mother promptly asked as soon as they were safely home. Draco had no desire to lie to his mother, but also was terrified to tell her the truth. How did he tell her that his year was the best he ever had because he had fallen in love with his father's enemy?
"No touching, Potter. You're only allowed to cum from my dick alone, like the cock-slut you are." Harry groaned in frustration before moaning loudly as Draco hit his sweet spot. Once he found it, he hit it hard over and over again until Harry was almost sobbing with his need to jizz.
"I do know that. He's mine. Piss off ginger." With those last words, Draco walked off while dragging Harry along with him. Looking back, Harry saw an incredulous expression on Ginny's face at their abrupt departure. He felt bad for her but knew that Draco was right. It had always been him.
"Yeah!" Pansy interrupted "It wasn't easy to keep you away from Harry long enough for this to work and everyone else contributed to the decorating and snacks." A chorus of 'Yeah's followed her remark, which only made Draco laugh happily.
"Thank you, baby." Draco told Harry as he smiled genuinely. Harry loved his smile.
While Draco watched, Harry laid down on the bed and pulled up his shirt. Draco blushed as he saw Harry's naked and leanly muscled chest for the first time. Harry then started to caress his own chest, pinching and toying with his nipples occasionally before his hands wandered all the way down to unbutton and unzip his school pants. His hand then slowly dipped inside and grabbed his sizable erection. Draco heard a soft moan as he began to pump up and down and felt his face turn scarlet. Apparently Harry Potter came here to wank.
"When is what I would've liked to know. They only had a blowout fight yesterday." Neville interjected.
Harry was so eager to see his boyfriend after so long that he hadn't even thought over the fact he would be officially meeting Draco's mother. He quickly finished his breakfast before running upstairs to re-pack his trunk. Draco wrote in his letter that his father was due to leave around ten o'clock a.m. and was expected to be gone for a whole month and that they would connect the floo to the Weasley's (with their permission, of course) around eleven as the Malfoy wards did not allow direct apparating. Harry readied himself in a flustered hurry before the fact he was going to be meeting Narcissa Malfoy as her son's boyfriend finally sank in. Then he re-readied himself with more care to how he dressed. He really wanted to make a good impression.
"'Okay'? What do you mean, 'okay'?" Draco asked confused. Harry laughed.
He looked up at his fair haired boyfriend in disgruntlement before instantly calming as Draco ran his fingers through Harry's hair. He always loved it when Draco did that. He loved it when Draco touched him in general. Harry sighed in contentment and gave Draco an adoring look that Draco just couldn't resist. He leaned down, capturing all too willing lips in a slow and heated kiss.
Somehow they managed to get naked without actually tearing anything off. Draco groaned as soon as he was skin to skin with Harry's heat and Harry moaned in response. They kissed needily as their cocks rubbed together, slick with precum and rigid with longing. It was Draco who managed to pull away first. Harry whimpered at the loss of Draco's touch. Draco smiled in response before walking away to turn on the shower. The lack of proximity gave Harry enough presence of mind to take in his surroundings. Draco's bathroom was huge and was complete with a giant three-headed shower (one of which was one of the rain-imitating varieties) and a jacuzzi along with the toilet and sink. It had to be almost as big as Draco's bedroom.
Harry felt Draco's needy hole clench tight around him as his lover orgasmed. It tipped him hard over the edge and not long after he was filling Draco to the brim with hot cum. His own orgasm was so powerful that he went blind for a moment before he collapsed on top of his now sticky boyfriend. When he could move again, he pulled his still semi hard cock out and watched with satisfaction as his creamy jizz leaked out of Draco's gaping and used hole. After he looked his fill, Harry cleaned both Draco and himself with a quick scougify before pulling the covers over them and falling asleep while holding him close. They woke up several times that night only to make love again before cleaning up and falling asleep again. The last time was in the wee hours of the morning. When the first light of dawn touched the sky they fell asleep for the last time that night.
“Do you mind?” Ron asked, handing the child over to Harry so he could check his hair in the small oval mirror that hung on one of the walls - Harry had spent many years wondering why they had chosen it as a decoration before finally realizing that its sole purpose appeared to be affirming the Granger-Weasley’s grooming habits before they left the house. It made him love them even more.
Once everyone was seated and had begun eating, Harry clinked his glass. “I have some news.” He began, taking Anthony’s hand. “I wanted you all to meet Anthony because, well, we’re engaged.”
“What exactly is it that you do?” Draco knows that Harry works for the ministry in a newer department, and that it has something to do with children.
Booo, biphobia.
“Why is that?”
This was Hermione’s sticking point as well. “Oh Harry.” She’d said, pursing her lips and trying to sound diplomatic. “You didn’t notice any of her things were gone?”
“Have you checked your home?” Blaise asked “He knows how to use the floo, maybe he went there.”
Scorpius only took a bit of convincing; though he was a well behaved child, apt to follow rules and respect adults, he was also quite fixed on both the brownie baking wizard and not seeming like too much of a wet blanket in front of Rosie. Given these two factors, it wasn’t long before the pair were standing before the perch in Hermione’s office, tying their letter to the leg of an official looking eagle owl (favoured by upper ministers for their impressive size and dignified bearing)(Hermione prefered barn owls herself).
“What?” Daphne looks quickly at Pansy to make sure she isn’t about to die before turning back to Draco. “When did you break up?”
“When did you last see him?” He asked in a strained voice.
“Scorpius!” Draco sighed, marshalled his temper, and then continued “I told you, this isn’t how things are done. You don’t meet someone because they heard your voice on the radio. You meet through friends, through work. You have a mutual spark and things progress from there!” Scorpius couldn’t have known, but Draco was thinking specifically of a certain very engaged hero of the wizarding world. He had found himself wishing more than once that it was Harry waiting for him at Le Phénix rather than Esme, though he supposed the upscale restaurant was probably not to Harry’s taste.
“Right.” Harry tried to strain his memory for the name of the Greengrass sister who had been in his year at Hogwarts. “That would be Daphne and - who is your other Aunt?”
There’s a beat of uncomfortable silence. Harry rubs the back of his neck awkwardly. “Actually, Ginny and I split up.”
“It’s nearly eleven!” He exclaimed. “Uninvited to boot. Hermone and I could have been, you know-”
There was a brief shuffling in the background, and a child’s voice was barely audible as he called out “Papa? There’s someone in the floo for you!”
“She does, every year since, you know, the Battle. Always some inoffensive pastoral scene with exactly four words, ‘Best Wishes on Your Birthday’ and then her name. Except for the first one, which had a short letter apologising for her part in everything.”
Harry stops short and tries to find it again in the crowd of healers clustered around reception. Just when he’s about to give up, someone exclaims “You’re a card, Malfoy!” and a pale head materializes from behind the desk, holding a sheaf of parchment triumphantly in the air.
“But you’re friends now?” Scorpius asked, sitting down cross-legged on the floor to lean against the open door, though Harry noticed he was careful not to set even a toe outside the frame - Malfoy’s wards were probably only activated if someone entered or left the room. Harry slid down the wall till he was sitting against it, and turned to face the child.
“Harry?” Hermione’s voice rang through Grimmauld Place like a bell, reaching Harry where he sat in the library, slumped against the unyielding back of his least favourite chair because he didn’t feel he deserved the comfortable one. He didn’t move to let her know his location - Hermione was far too skilled a witch to need directions.
Pansy let out a loud sniffle that she attempted to muffle in her glass of wine, and Draco felt tears spring to his own eyes.
“After breakfast can we pick out papa’s new partner?” Scorpius asked around a mouthful of egg.
Pansy laughed and reached over to ruffle his hair. “I know you do, Scorpo, but your dad can’t marry someone just because they can bake. Besides, he’s going on a date tonight isn’t he?”
Thanks for reading this silly fluff and commenting, I don't often reply because I'm a bit of a shy weirdo when it comes to my own work, but I do love every one of them!
“It’s so he knows we’re interested in him as a person.” Scorpius said - he was parroting something he had overheard his Aunt Pansy say to his papa, though it had been slightly lost in translation.
Harry’s grin widened as Pansy approached, a drink in one hand and the other trailing her fur wrap. “Oh look, it’s Harry Potter.” She sneered playfully, accidentally throwing her wrap in Harry’s face as she made a sweeping curtsy in his direction. “The boy who lived to grace us with his presence.”
“No-o” Draco says haltingly, trying not to give Potter an in.
Potter’s smile dims somewhat. “Yeah, I know.” There’s a moment of awkward silence and then “Do you think you’ll marry Ernie?”
They ate posh sandwiches and drank tea from a matching set of jade cups while Mandy droned on about her current case and Harry tried to feign interest. He wished Anthony had more interesting friends - if only they were in the warm chaos of Ron and Hermione’s home instead, drinking tea from the assortment of oddly shaped mugs that Luna hand made and gifted them all each Christmas till everyone had a haphazard collection. (This year Harry’s was bright yellow and the handle was a lion’s tale. It went well with the one shaped like a lion’s head from four years previous.)
“What are you reading Harry?” Hermione asked, sliding a pint across the table as she sat down beside him in their usual booth at the Leaky. She and Harry were  early as they had both come from the ministry where Harry was shopping WWW’s defense cloak prototype to the Head Auror. His visit to Hermione’s office had been undertaken with great trepidation, but Anthony was nowhere in sight (Harry had heard that he was dating again, some bloke from Magical Sports and Games, which seemed altogether too soon if he was being honest).
“Where’s Norway?” Scorpius asked.
“Okay then.” Rosie got a look on her face that was very reminiscent of a look her mother wore when faced with a problem. Getting up, she took parchment and a self-inking quill from the desk in the corner of their living room and brought them over to the kitchen table where Scorpius was sitting "Tell me what to say.”
Draco is browsing Flourish & Blotts with Daphne on a warm Saturday morning in late May. They’ve just enjoyed a lovely breakfast at one of the new cafes that has sprung up in the wake of the war. He’s infinitely grateful that he
“The two of you will be my death.” Draco muttered fondly as he set the tea to steep and added the final ingredients to their breakfast.
So, letting curiosity get the better of him and wanting Malfoy’s attention for reasons he couldn’t quite figure out, Harry jumped into the conversation. “She mentions Scorpius all the time.”
“Only because you cheat!” Harry exclaims. “If you make me go to another terrible film like that one last week-”
“I do, though we were in different houses.” Draco said, already anticipating her reaction when she found his out.
Scorpius clutched the letter to his chest and nodded. “I like brownies.”
“Have you ever heard this band before?” Sirius gestures at the album cover lying on the table as Harry takes a seat across from him - in the middle of a black background is a crest that looks a little like their house banners at school. A pair of lions frame a stylized chrome Q with yet another crown at its centre. A large white bird and a flaming crab float above it, and two fairy-like figures are beneath each lion, one sitting and the other standing. At the bottom in cursive it reads:
“Hermione.” He intoned politely, taking her lead in using first names. Her hair was styled shorter than it had been at Hogwarts, a cloud of neat curls rising up from her head. She wore a black robe open at the front over a purple dress and deep raspberry lipstick that looked lovely against her brown skin. Draco could not recall Hermione ever seeming so put together or confident in school, and he felt rather more intimidated by her now than he had as a boy.
“He’s really good at making breakfast” Scorpius said “but he doesn’t like jam very much.”
“A couple of weeks ago, I was listening to the wireless.” He began, launching into the whole sordid tale for the only two people he could trust with the information. By the time he had finished, Hermione was on the dregs at the bottom of her cup and Ron was looking perplexed.
“That’s a shame, I love jam.”
“Ernest” Potter smirks “when we were in school he went by Ernie.”
Harry goggled at Ron while Hermione looked smug, as she often did when Ron blasted through someone’s self-involvement with unexpected insight. He was particularly good at doing this to his closest friends, though he reserved it only for the most dire of scenarios.
“Whomever you choose. For your sake and the sake of any future partner, I think it would be beneficial to see this meeting through.”
“I promise she was.” Potter grins and takes a large sip of his drink, froth catching in the hair above his lip.
Of course Pansy picked that exact moment to appear.
“It’s too many!” He said, squirming out of the way of her long, manicured nails. “And mummy said they’re mean to muggles so Isla and Peter couldn’t come over.”
“Gay?” Hermione smiled.
“Hello?” He called out tentatively, feeling foolish.
“Why not?” Scorpius let out a large yawn
Harry weighed his response. “I didn’t really have a family” he said at last “well, I had my aunt and uncle, but they didn’t like me very much.”
6:15pm: hrry membr??
“The Nook.” He said, stepping into the fireplace.
“You have to admit that Pax Garden is the best of it, though.” Harry said, fiddling with the parchment. This was also true - Pax Garden sat at the end of a languid maze that had little paths leading into alcoves with statues of different magical and non-magical creatures arranged in tableaus among the flowers. The Garden itself was bracketed on three sides by the hedgerow, ivy dripping down the thick green walls. Arching over its entrance were trellised roses, their blooms hanging full and petulant no matter the season - in fact, all of the flowers within the garden were in perpetual bloom. A winding path shaped by all manner of flowers and leafy green plants lead to a little hollow where a metal gazebo that seemed to be made entirely of more large, white roses stood guard over a modest stone plinth bearing two pairs of hands cast in dark marble. The inside pair was cupped to hold a steady stream of water that gurgled from their depths; the second pair rested gently on the first, fingers touching its wrist, cupping the inner hands as though helping them bare the weight of their burden. The stone beneath them had a repeating phrase etched into its surface: “pax optima rerum” or “Peace is the greatest good.”
This is surprising news, not least of all because it hasn’t hit the papers yet. “I’m sorry to hear that I - I’ve actually only recently broken up with Ernest.” Over a month ago, but the wound is still fresh.
“No.”
“Well, it doesn’t matter anyway.” Draco says.
“So you think I should, what, stand him up?”
“You seem to be very at peace with it.” Harry says, scrutinising Draco closely. “I didn’t feel nearly this calm when Gin ended things.”
"Merlin." Harry shakes his head. “What shall we do with the rest of our evening, then?”
Luckily for her, Draco stepped out of the floo at that moment. “Hello, hello.” He said, dropping his satchel on the couch in a distracted and uncharacteristic fashion before depositing a large paper bag on the counter as he sprinted for the stairs.
“Well, my mum certainly did. She had high hopes I’d marry a nice witch and produce heirs that would lead our family name back to the cradle of prestige where she felt we belonged. Once she realised that wasn’t going to happen, she settled for being happy that Ernest was, at least, a pureblood.” Draco sees irritation flash across Potter’s face. “She’s finding it difficult to give up old ways of thinking that helped her survive - I'm not saying she's right, but it is very ingrained. We got past the gay business, and we’re working on the whole blood purity nonsense now.”
“Draco!” Hermione said warmly, though her smile dropped slightly as she sensed the tension in the room. “Where’s Scorpius?”
“Where’s your dad, Scorpius? Is Draco okay?”
“I know it hurts, Harry, but it doesn’t mean you’re flawed. The two of you were incompatible, which happens sometimes, even when two people love each other. Do you really see yourself giving up on having a family? Not resenting Tony for holding you back from it?”
It had taken a while for them to become close. Andromeda had, at first, mistrusted the boy she knew only from his brief appearance at her house during his final escape from Privet Drive. Given that upon their first meeting Harry had pulled his wand on her, he figured it was only fair she had reservations.
Draco blinked down at his son - he had the Malfoy hair, though it had picked up a slight wave by way of the Greengrass’ genetics so that it curled around the ears and temples of his pale little face. Eyes that were the same shade of blue as Astoria’s peered up at Draco with concern, and he felt a lurch of guilt at his own selfishness.
“Harry. And you must be Scorpius?”
The last thing Draco saw as they swirled away was Harry’s face, and the expression of regret that lingered there only fueled his sense of rejection and shame.
(Hermione had spent years working her way through the bureaucratic ranks of the ministry in order to reform magical creature and blood purity laws. As a result, she was the newly appointed Secretary of Foreign and Muggle Affairs. Kingsley had tried to appoint her Secretary of Magical Creatures and Muggle Affairs but Hermione had declined, citing the need for actual representation from the group. Firenze, formerly designated magical creature now designated magical being thanks in large part to Hermione’s efforts, became the first of his kind to hold a position of rank within the ministry.)
Fran and Amani look quickly at Draco.
“Not with two young children we aren’t.” Hermione said, coming in from the kitchen with a steaming mug of tea. “Fancy something to drink, Harry? I've just made a pot of chamomile.”
There was something about Malfoy that Harry couldn’t quite figure out, an oddly welcoming quality that had not been present in his youth. Harry had to admit that Malfoy was attractive, had always been even through the veneer of schoolboy rivalry, but this adult version was interesting. Maybe it was his voice, which seemed somehow familiar - but of course it was, he’d heard Malfoy speak countless times. Still, there was something.
Draco pauses, and turns to look at him. “I meant what I said, Potter. Kindly leave me alone.”
Dean looks at Harry with bleary confusion. “She was all packed and you didn’t have a clue? You live together.”
Draco laughed. “Ex death eater, widower.”
“Magic.” Harry whispered.
“I do think that inviting Andromeda and Teddy to move in with you is a great idea, though. I know she’s worried about keeping up with him and that old house of hers is getting to be too much work. I think you should ask her sooner rather than later.”
“Now it feels different. I can still sense him there, but I like how it evokes his memory. Him and Remus were the last close ties I had to my parents, so living in the house where Sirius grew up hurt at first, but now it’s a comforting channel to my family.”
“The first one. I didn’t know you were seeing Ernie.”
“Who would have thought, a Weasley-Granger and a Malfoy being such good friends?” Harry joked once he had caught up to the conversation. “Rosie definitely isn’t a Slytherin, I wonder if Scorpius will be in Gryffindor?”
Draco and Blaise always threw a New Years party, a tradition spawned during their fifth year at Hogwarts, though it had come a long way from covert bottles of firewhiskey in their dorm room. This year was shaping up to be one of the best, with Draco hosting at his new home and the guest list slightly more intimate than other years.
“I got your favourite eggrolls, Pads, but you have to share this time.” Remus stops short when he sees Harry, flicks his glance over to Sirius and then back again. “Having a late night get together, are we?”
“She would be appalled by the state of things.” Harry finished. Ever since Kreature’s death the upkeep of Grimmauld Place had been Harry’s responsibility. He wasn’t a terrible housekeeper or cook, but the recent breakup had not left him feeling particularly capable of doing either and it was apparent in the mound of take out containers, lager bottles, and discarded clothing that covered the room.
Harry can only stare at the sight in front of him. Draco’s eyes are red-rimmed, but he’s biting back the biggest smile Harry’s ever seen. He looks so- so-
“I dunno, I guess I was worried about you, you utter prat!” Harry yells, his resolve to be civil finally breaking. He can’t lie, not to Malfoy, not to the person who’s always seen right through all the shit everyone has always liked to bolster his image with.
Potter!”
“It was going to! If Snape hadn’t been there—”
“I— it’s not pity, Malfoy!” Pity? Is he mad? Why in the world would Harry kiss him if he pitied him? He says as much to Malfoy, who turns a lovely shade of pink and stalks out of the bathroom, his robe swishing behind him regally.
Potter? Stop blabbering like an idiot and come out with it!”
There is an onslaught of images in his head and he can’t stop them, he can’t make them go back into that dark, depraved place of his mind which conjured them, trying to fulfil a fantasy he didn’t know he craved.
“I don’t know, this is all I’ve ever used. What do you use in your hair, then?” Even as the words leave Harry’s mouth, he feels a sense of regret. Draco’s bathtub is lined with an arsenal of concoctions and potions and he doesn’t need a lecture on what is best for his skin or his hair or whatever.
He sighs and decides to try again. This time it’s an Iron Man t-shirt, because Scorpius had loved the movie when they went to watch it in the theatre. (Draco had not loved it. In fact, he’d spent most of the movie looking down at the popcorn box in his lap. Which
Hermione chuckles from behind him, her eyes firmly glued to a mammoth book. “Take a guess.”
“We were just. Arguing.” Technically, it was true. “After Quidditch.”
“He didn’t have any,” Harry said, as if that explained everything. “He was trying to charge it to his father’s bill, but the storekeeper said something about a memo from the Ministry. I think all their money’s been taken or something.”
“What reason would Malfoy have to help you with Potions?” Ron burst in. “He hates you, Harry! But if somebody told him to get close to you, then he would, right? I mean, you put his dad in Azkaban, why would he want to study Potions with you?”
On the wall, a map of the United Kingdom is hung crookedly with Sellotape; Harry's Invisibility Cloak is draped with most of his discarded clothes over a chair too rickety to bear anyone's weight; next to him, Ron is snoring amidst several empty crisps packets, a thick book spread open on his chest.  Harry has no idea what time it is, he hasn't seen Molly Weasley or Remus Lupin in three days, and he can't remember the last time he showered.
'Well,' she said, 'that was fun while it lasted.'
‘Because,’ Malfoy flushed, ‘it’s the only place I—ugh. I don’t need to explain myself to you.’
"I'm coming," Draco said hurriedly. "Just let me get dressed."
'Yeah,' Harry said, 'maybe.'
“I can explain,” Harry said weakly, but it was too late.
Harry said, 'Right. That's what I mean.'
'Well, maybe we can throw her a birthday party,' Ron suggests brightly.  Hermione gives him a withering look.
So what
'But you're—staying?' Harry says, a bit incredulous himself.
'No you don't, you did it yourself tonight,' Harry shrugged. 'I just wanted to help you because that's what, um, friends do for each other.'
a better wizard.'
'Professor—' Harry begins, overcome with questions, but before he can even get the first one out, the room erupts in voices.  From every wall, portraits are calling out, 'Dumbledore!' and 'Welcome, welcome!  You're awake!'  Several former headmasters and headmistresses even rush from their frames towards Dumbledore's, to shake his hand themselves.
Harry quickly crushed the flare of excitement that had soared inside him at the words. He wasn’t thrilled at the idea of danger, of course. He didn’t want to think about anyone else getting hurt because of him. But all the same, things had been maddeningly stagnant for far too long, and the idea of something happening made a small part of him eager.
“They probably want to see if he has any leads on where his father is,” Hermione said. “I wouldn’t be surprised if he did.”
He seized Malfoy by the arm of his robes. 'What are you playing at? As temporary as it might be, I'm actually glad to see you here.'
“I didn’t know, Potter,” Draco said savagely, “I didn’t know what would happen, I thought they were just looking for you, my mum said Tonks was going to lure you there and that was all! And my mum would know right away if I’d informed, I was the only one who knew besides those involved, and I told the Slytherins not to go, I said—"
“No, you look,” Malfoy hissed. "This is what the great hero comes down to? Is this what you do when people die? No wonder Diggory died, if your best solution to problems is sulking in an empty room. You're
“Angry,” Harry said rudely, because it was true. He stared at the ground. “And no, I don’t want to talk about it.”
'He's just,' Harry muttered. 'Look, you don't understand.'
“My sisters,” said Tonks’s mother. It was the first time she’d spoken and Harry looked at her again. Andromeda Black Tonks, her hair shot through with gray, her hands clenched tightly around the fabric of her bag. She spoke softly. “Narcissa and Bella. I never dreamed they would go after my daughter. I thought that perhaps we were still left out of the struggle, that perhaps they would leave us in peace.”
'Viktor,' Hermione says without looking up, even when crumbs spray out of Ron's mouth as he splutters in indignation.  She takes a bite of her own toast.  'He's really interested in helping with the Order, you know, I said I'd ask Lupin or someone—'
'Oh, shut up,' said Harry. 'Did you really crash into a helicopter on your broom when you were nine, or were you just making that up?'
'Hi—?' said Harry.
, Harry thought tiredly,
For once, Harry was inclined to agree. With the exception of Seamus’s dirty magazines, he’d never seen quite so much skin, especially not on someone he’d seen flinging spells with the best of them. She was dancing with somebody with a shaved head, shimmying in his arms, and something about it seemed so obscene that Harry had to tear his eyes away. When he looked back to Ron, he saw an unfamiliar girl leaning against the bar taking a sip from Ron’s Butterbeer, and Ron making frantic eyes at him that said, in no uncertain terms,
'It just says,
“And now all she does is whisper with Ginny all hours of the day! They’re always giggling—I tell you, girls, they’re all mad—"
They stared at one another, Malfoy like a cornered animal. 'That's the point!' he snarled at last. 'If I had to, to
"Right now?" Draco's voice was indignant, the spell broken. "Aren't you hungry? It's barely morning."
Raising an eyebrow at the fading Patronus, Harry took a few steps forward. "Really? It didn't look too impressive to me, either way."
“No,” Harry challenged back, “but Professor Kothari’s a good teacher and I think you should come. What are you planning on doing, never attending Potions again?”
Then again, perhaps that had been before the wedding.
“Of course,” he pointed out, for the umpteenth time, as they walked towards Hogsmeade, “Madam Hooch would have saved you, of course, or anyone in the stands. So you don’t owe him anything, Harry, if you’re getting any ideas.”
Harry said, 'What are you doing?'
'McGonagall's shown up,' he said triumphantly. 'She'll handle it, I'd only be in the way.'
“Inter-House unity, Harry,” Hermione said, as if he hadn’t been listening to a word. “Now that Umbridge is out of the way, it’s really important to start working on it, don’t you think?”
Across the dormitory, he heard Neville mumble to himself, “Erumpent fluid, erumpent fluid . . . Bundimun secretion . . . got to remember that,” as he paged through his notes. Harry shook off the image of Malfoy and sighed. He was getting nowhere with this. He might as well just clear his mind and attempt to sleep. If he dreamt of Voldemort, so be it.
It was another several seconds when Harry realized that Ginny and Dean had been dating for nearly four months, far longer than Harry and Ginny had that first spring, and were in the dormitory alone. The full realization came as a detached sort of shock, sweeping over him slowly. He had not thought of her for weeks now, not since Christmas even, where before swift memories of her nimble fingers or her mischievous smile would come unbidden. But the thought of her, in
Now that Harry thought about it, he remembered Michael's name being read off at the memorial service, and Ginny squeezing his hand tight. At the time he had not made the connection . . . he had been caught up in his own thoughts . . .
'I know what we've got to do,' Hermione says in an even tone.  She's barefoot and wearing the same loose t-shirt she was wearing the day before, but her hair smells of lavender, as if she's just washed it.  'I'm working on it.  We're all working on it.  But don't you think—' here her voice goes meek, the way it does when she is about to say something she is sure he will not like—'don't you think it all seems a little unreal?  Like we're—sort of—playing at being adults?'
“And that’s another foul from Slytherin!” Ackerley bellowed. “Rotten cheaters—er, good for the Ravenclaws, I mean—and that’s a penalty to Ravenclaw as the players move towards the Ravenclaw side—there goes Morag from the center, and she’s up against Bletchley for the Slytherins—"
Harry glanced down at his hand, where he could see the faint traces of
Ron frowned. 'Her, why?'
Harry glanced around the busy hall, suddenly aware of just how long he had eaten breakfast there without a thought. It still reminded him of the casualties the last battle had claimed, but now, glancing at the staff table, Harry thought most of Snape. The way he had looked at Harry the very first night at Hogwarts, black eyes piercing, as if he were combing through Harry's mind . . .
“Yes!” Harry snapped. And then, “No. I—I don’t know, all right?”
They're silent; Harry can hear the clink of a fork against a plate from the kitchen.  After a long pause, Malfoy says stiffly, 'I don't turn my back on those who've helped me, all right?'
Finally, he said, 'No. We won the war. There shouldn't have been so much—people shouldn't have died. But no, I don't regret it.'
'Yes, I'm sure it's a vast improvement to have me thinking you wrote scores of songs about me down there in your dungeon.'
"I'm just tired of people going through my belongings!" Draco shouted, tearing the letter from Harry's hands and causing it to rip halfway down the middle in the process. "You see what you've done? You're ruining everything, you and your fucking friends at the Ministry, can't keep your greedy hands to yourselves!" His face was red. "Need another chandelier for your office? Check Malfoy Manor, there might be one or two left! Some gold candlesticks? Another painting or two? Surely
'Oh, gross.'  Ginny makes a face at him.  'I do not need to know that about my brother.  Really.  Do you want to take a walk?'
Ginny shrugged. 'As long as you pass your N.E.W.T.s. Hey, Harry, don't you have a free period now? Flitwick's cancelled Charms because some fourth-year blew half the classroom up. Want to go down to the lake?'
The two of them turned and saw a familiar gloomy expression hovering behind them. 'Myrtle?' Harry exclaimed. He had never seen Myrtle outside a toilet or the lake.
“Can’t say as I know a Dursley,” the man said thoughtfully. He appeared so calm about the entire situation that Harry wondered if strange boys turned up on his doorstep every night. “Oh, wait now. The couple who owned the house, that’s right! Bit unpleasant, if I remember correctly, but quite eager to sell, I—"
“Tonks is—" Remus began, but Harry interrupted him again.
Harry snorted despite himself. “So, what, I’m now your father figure?”
It is said in the same tone that she's been using to yell at him, and utterly bewildered, Harry says, 'What?'
'I don't know,' he told her. 'I think I was. I thought I was.'
Ron stopped dead in the street, mouth hanging open, and stared at Harry. After a moment, he said rather weakly, “She does?”
After dinner, he spent a restless hour poring over Hermione’s Transfiguration notes before leaving to meet Malfoy. Luckily, Ron and Hermione were at a Gyffindor Prefects meeting, and neither were present to notice him leaving. He wasn’t sure if he was ready to spill about whom, exactly, he was going to see.
Draco moaned before he came, a guttural “
'It's what I've been telling you!' Hermione burst out. ''These aren't fair trials! They want a scapegoat for Dumbledore's death, you know how emotions were running high after the one year memorial, I think Elphias Doge is behind it—'
When the spell wore off, Malfoy squawked, 'Lord, Potter, you've gotten to the point where you can't even listen to people who won't agree with you!'
“It’s almost time,” he said, eyes glinting, “come on, come on, good luck, everybody . . .”
Draco's eyebrows rose skeptically. "You're reading
Harry was sure he was red-faced. Why was there so much talking? In his imagination, it had never been this awkward. “I’m sure,” he said, a little hoarsely.
Harry says, for what he feels might be the twentieth time today, 'Malfoy, come on.'
“I,” Harry said, “it’s just—"
For an instant, Harry felt the familiar thread of annoyance at Malfoy's inability to say anything outright. Then he touched the scrap of parchment in his pocket beside the Chocolate Frog card and his irritation faded. He followed Malfoy toward the doors.
Still, it was one of the best experiences Harry had had in months, he realized as they landed and purred to a halt back in the shed. He felt almost as if it were Sirius’s Christmas present to him; he felt closer to Sirius there, even if Sirius was gone forever, even if he was dead.
'Ginny and I are over,' Harry said. 'For good. We really are. You know that, Ron.'
'No, not everything,' Harry admitted. 'But some things.'
Harry rolled his eyes; he knew that Hermione meant well, but this was altogether more trouble than it was worth. 'Come back to Hogwarts, Malfoy.'
“Yeah, you are a blithering idiot,” Harry said, grinning. “But she likes you.”
'That's because your mum—'
Katie glances from Malfoy to Harry and back, then says, 'Harry was always better than you, you little ferret,' then claps Harry on the shoulder and turns away.
'You didn't know?'
'Yeah.'  Harry says.  He sits down.
“Sit down, sit down,” Tonks encouraged. “So? Sirius said you were working hard.”
“Well, Yeh-Know-Who, o’ course,” said Hagrid. “Death Eater activity, people claimin’ they saw ‘im, all the time. Dumbledore had a few o’ Aurors go an’ investigate, an’ that was the end o’ all of ‘em.”
if he didn’t mean it, and there was nothing else. Finally, he said, “Did you know him well?”
Harry is about to open his mouth to tell Malfoy off, but Hermione gets there first.  'I slapped you once,' she says, 'and I'd do it again, don't you think I wouldn't.  That's the problem with you.  Thinking you're better than other people, thinking that means you can order them around.  When I think about how your family treated Dobby—and all because most witches and wizards have been socialized to think they've got the right to keep house-elves enslaved, that house-elves don't want to be free, that house-elves aren't quite like
Several hours later, Harry woke to the vision of a silvery lynx, floating before him in the room.
Harry backed away without a word into the kitchen, where Remus was sipping his tea calmly. He’d momentarily forgotten that Narcissa Malfoy was Sirius’s cousin, making Draco Sirius’s second cousin. And Tonks, too, was the daughter of Andromeda; not counting the disowning, that made Tonks and Draco cousins, too. Was
!' Malfoy snaps.  'You can torture me all you want, Potter, but I can't give you an answer!  All I remember is that it smelled like potions.'
Harry meant to say,
'And er, that other one,' Harry said. 'Tall, dark hair?'
Harry shouted desperately, “
'It wouldn't be difficult,' Scrimgeour says, in a tone that suggests that he is a reasonable man.   'I'd do the talking.  You'd just have to sit next to me.'
'I'd go with you if not for Ron, just to save you the trouble,' Hermione offered, patting him sympathetically on the arm. 'You ought to just pick somebody, Harry, it doesn't mean you're bonded for life. Why not Parvati?'
'Of course I am not
“I can’t help how I feel about my father,” Draco snapped, turning away from Harry to look doggedly at the wall. He barreled on, so quietly that Harry wondered for a moment if he was hearing things, “But I can’t help how I feel about you, either.”
,” Harry screamed, feeling as if his whole body were pulled into the spell, so filled up with hatred was he, and a bolt of red light shot straight from his wand and hit Bellatrix squarely in the chest. She hit the ground so suddenly that the abrupt silence in Privet Drive was deafening.
Harry laughed. “It’s kind of quiet over here.”
'Oh, don't you?'  Harry arches an eyebrow at him.  He says, 'I thought that was exactly what you did.'
'Oh?' said Malfoy. His eyes were a curious color, the kind of nauseous gray the sky turns just before a tornado. 'Are we getting confused, Potter, or are you honestly telling me, me, that you're through with this arrangement?'
Malfoy blinked a couple times. Then he said, 'I could be captain?'
“Hooch hasn’t scheduled it yet,” Draco said. “In a few weeks, I should think.” After a moment, he said with a sneer, “Stupid Chang was sniveling in the snow, of course. Pity that’s the closest she’ll ever get to the Snitch.”
For an instant, Harry was truly bewildered, and then he shook his head. “Occlumency. With Dumbledore.”
“Killed?” Harry echoed, stricken. He remembered clearly how Dumbledore had murmured that Aberforth was the only family he had left. “But—Dumbledore—"
On his way to bed, when he splashed water on his face in the upstairs toilet, the tap tried to snap at his fingers and he snatched them away in shock. Behind his mirror reflection, he could see the window's thick panes of glass, gleaming from Kreacher's attentions. The tub stood on feet so clawed they could rip out someone's heart.
Malfoy, on the other hand, was livid. “I don’t want your
“But you heard him! He said—"
Harry opened his mouth to retort, but at that moment, Remus opened the door and said pleasantly, “Boys, come in,” and they followed him inside. He already had the Floo powder out and, after offering them both a cup of tea, which neither wanted, he gestured to the fireplace. “You boys go first.”
'I have to go,' Harry repeated, and tore away from her.
“I—suppose we should go in, then,” he said haltingly after an awkward moment had passed. It was awful, this not-knowing, having just spent several minutes attached to Draco Malfoy’s lips and now having nothing to say to him, not even a half-arsed insult.
'I can't see why I have to be the one to tell him,' Hermione said out the side of her mouth to Ron, though Harry heard every word.
Harry squeezes her shoulder.  'It's okay.  Go on making plans with George, you can tell me later.'
'She looked a bloody lot like Madam Pince, too,' Ron adds.  'You know, shrieking about the sanctity of knowledge and depraved schoolchildren.'  He does a very accurate imitation of Madam Pince swooping down on them, flailing her batty arms, and imagining Hermione doing the very same, Harry can't help but laugh.
'Thanks ever so for your Gryffindor protection,' Malfoy drawled, handling the mirror as if it might bite him. 'Whatever would I do without you.'
Malfoy looked furious. “My father is not a coward,” he bit out, enunciating each word. “He’s twenty times the wizard your father ever was.”
“We ran up the street towards the Three Broomsticks,” Ron continued, “but by that time, people were fighting in the street by the post office and Honeydukes. There were huge crowds of smoke and sparks everywhere—we couldn’t see anyone, people were just running by. I remember Hannah Abbott ran past me and grabbed onto my arm, looking like she’d just seen You-Know-Who himself. She didn’t, though,” he assured Harry, after Harry gave him a shocked look, “he wasn’t there, I don’t think. Just a lot of Death Eaters—Tonks was there dueling with one of them—I saw McGonagall firing spells, she had a group of third-years huddled behind her—"
'The Weasel girl and the Muggle,' Malfoy drawled, apparently having caught the right glimpse over Harry's shoulder. Harry's blood felt hot, feverish. 'Sordid goings-on in Gryffindor Tower, are there? What, Potter, are you embarrassed? The future Mrs. Potter busy dallying with another—possibly even in your bed—'
'But how do you know?'
'I'll be down in a moment. Let me finish my cigarette. Bad for babies, you know.' She took a drag and looked out through the windowpanes, shining and polished for the first time in years. 'I can't believe I'm raising another child. Alone, too.'
'She was,' Andromeda said. 'Teddy is hers and—'
Hermione, who had got her way, merely smiled.
The words seemed to hit Malfoy like a sack of Bludgers, because he went white.
Hermione visits the next week and yells when Harry feigns sleep and Draco smirks at her. "Harry Potter," she shouts in her best Molly Weasley voice, "you open your eyes right this minute!" When Draco chokes back laughter, Hermione fixes him with a death glare, and he slides out of his portrait to avoid her wrath.
But Harry had thought, naively perhaps, that what had happened at Grimmauld Place had changed some things between them. Maybe he’d been wrong. Was this the issue they’d been dancing around all this time?
“Yeah,” Harry said, “okay.” Tonks was looking at him strangely, almost wistfully, and he frowned. “Do you miss your dad?” It came out without him thinking, and he realized as an afterthought that, when people asked him about Sirius, he typically responded by freezing up and snapping at them. “You don’t have to—I mean—"
He can’t cry, so he’ll laugh. He’ll laugh the laugh of the insane, of the ones left behind, of the person who knows what he had in his hands and let it go.
Draco takes a measured breath and puts his book down. He pulls out the newspaper from under the stack of papers where he’d hidden it, its edges creased and careworn from the abuse it’s suffered from Draco’s stiff, shaking fingers. As he shakes it open, the familiar surge of anger and vitriol rises up in his throat like bile, and he can only hold it out to Potter silently. His eyes are closed but he remembers the picture, playing on a loop, and how he would obsessively trace that glimpse of a smile on Potter’s face with a finger.
— when Malfoy’s face crumples, his monotonous facade cracking  as he lets the raw emotion seep back into his blank eyes. In that second, that break in character, the display of emotion is far more terrifying than the blankness Harry had seen in those eyes moments ago.
vibrant) and pulsating with blood.
“You lived in the Muggle world, not on another planet! Who uses
“I don’t know,” Harry shrugs, “We didn’t use the bathtubs all that much. Didn’t have the time to wank in there like
“Dad, Papa? We’re all very happy that you feel younger, but for the love of Merlin, please put up a silencing charm!”
Draco will do
Harry stiffens, and for that awful second, Draco thinks:
Draco thinks.
"Such a dirty cock-slut, aren't you?" Draco asked Harry.
After a few pumps Harry seemed to become impatient. He roughly kicked off his pants completely and, after casting a very familiar lubrication charm, reached behind himself to push a finger into his hot hole. He groaned loudly then continued pumping his cock. Soon, he added a second and then a third finger. His whole boy was flushed and he was panting and moaning with abandon. Draco couldn't tear his eyes away from the erotic sight. Technically he knew he should leave him to it, but the sight of Harry Potter thrusting three fingers in and out of himself while wanking his impressive-sized cock was making Draco harder than he ever remembered being in his life. So Draco stayed and watched his rival become more and more undone as the minutes passed.
"So," he said loudly, startling Harry out of his fantasy. Harry's faced went pale and he looked terrified. "You jack off to fantasies about me, huh?" Draco continued. Harry sputtered, attempting to deny the accusations.
Anthony nodded. “I know it seems odd as we’ve only been seeing each other for a few months, but I really do love Harry. I hope you’ll see that as you get to know me.”
“Sometime after my twentieth birthday.” Draco tries to gauge if Potter is about to make fun of him, but can’t find any malice in the question.
Blaise nudged Draco gently, returning his focus to the giant clock overhead. 3….2…..1
“Do you and Weasley both work at the ministry?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Hermione studied him. “Are you telling me you’re queer, Draco?”
Hermione’s frown softened. “That’s called incompatibility, Harry. Do you think this is actually about how Tony doesn’t want children?”
“What’s a smut show?” Scorpius asked at the same time Draco said “Pansy!”
6:17pm: t’s my moble, haf the bttns wrk hlf th time
“Because I’m Rosie’s uncle. She’s with her grandma and let me tell you, Grandma Weasley does not allow anyone to stay up past bedtime.”
Professor Mentis chuckled. “Smart man. You sound a lot younger than our usual flooers. Why are you calling us tonight?”
“No.”
“You’ve packed your papers?” Ernest asks, putting a hand on Draco’s waist and bending to kiss him before he can reply. Draco is not typically one for public displays of affection, however there’s something about Ernest that makes him want to show everyone that they are together. He deepens the kiss, leaning in, relishing the touch. He knows they look good together, with their differing shades of blonde (Ernest’s dark to Draco’s pale) and smart muggle suits, a fashion that has bled into the Wizarding World thanks in large part to the sudden post-war popularity of many of their peers.
“Oh Harry.” Anthony took his hand and lead him off the bridge, over to a snow covered bench which he cleared with a flick of his wand. A second flick cast a warming charm as he pulled Harry down beside him. “Listen. I love you, I truly do. And I care deeply for Teddy and Andromeda. But I meant what I said about not being a parent. You agreed with me, at the time. Teddy might not be a baby, but he’ll still required care. He’ll still need parenting.”
“He’ll be so cross with me.”
Astoria’s illness had been a long decline, the degradation and eventual disappearance of her magic over a period of months in a manner that left healers baffled and Draco making reckless pleas to any deity who might still take pity on him. If the gods existed they were not listening - Astoria had spoken her last words before falling into a sleep from which her breathing slowed, almost imperceptibly, to an end.
Draco laughs “I’m willing to be talked into it.”
“Me too.”
“Or wizards!” The child’s voice interjected. “Papa doesn’t care about gender.”
Harry was in the middle of telling Mandy about their summer plans - namely that Teddy would be spending a large portion of his vacation at Grimmauld place - when he glanced over to see a frown on Anthony’s face, though it was quickly replaced with a gentle smile when he met Harry’s eyes. It was only after they had left Mandy’s and were strolling through Dumbledore Meadows (streets and public places in the Phoenix District were almost all named after those who had fallen during the first and second wars, though Harry kept well away from Potter Square) that Anthony brought his concerns to light.
Feeling as though he had been caught cheating, Harry flicked his wand to turn off the wireless and wiped the last vestiges of tears from his eyes. “In here!”
“That’s what they all say.” Scorpius interjected, going back to his Quidditch figurines.
“Hello?” Answered a quiet voice that sounded as though its owner was crying. A child’s voice.
“Wait, Malfoy, come back!” Potter calls.
6:15pm: Potter?
“Just fetching his bag.” Draco said, and couldn’t help glancing over to where Harry stood. Hermione’s gaze followed and she narrowed her eyes in an attempt to discern what had happened in her absence. Scorpius took that moment to re-appear, setting his bag beside Draco before turning to Ron and Hermione.
“Oh Draco.” She said, mistaking the shock on his face for dislike. “Do you still hate him after all this time?”
“- and I simply realized that I deserved more than a lukewarm relationship. Ernest and I weren’t happy, he’s always busy and I’m always busy, we barely see each other. I’ve had a week to get used to being single and the longer we’re apart, the more I feel as though it was the right decision.”
Scorpius was missing.
The room descends into chaos as tree-roots launches himself at the challenger, knocking into several people on his way over.
“Ugh.” Harry flicked the dial on the wizarding wireless.
Harry frowned. “What, Ron? Do you think?”
“Kriemhild”
“Of course I’m sad, Pansy.” Draco was realizing somewhat belatedly that he had overindulged on the wine. “I’ve lost my fucking wife.”
Pansy and Daphne are in the process of ordering drinks when Draco arrives, out of breath and weighed down by several bags that he has not had time to shrink. It isn’t exactly dignified, but he prides himself on punctuality and is nearly fifteen minutes overdue.
“Papa says you’re not doing it properly if you don’t have time for the people you love. Couldn’t you find someone to love?”
“And what exactly has Hermione told you?”
Draco contemplated how to answer - truthfully or sarcastically. The low lighting and lack of audience made him choose the former. “Yes, but I was afraid I would become my father- he loved me, you understand, but he loved power more. I wasn’t sure I could be better. Astoria knew she wanted to be a mum, and I realized that together we had a better chance of doing things properly. Once I felt safe in that knowledge I could let myself want children again.” He studied Harry for a moment. “Who is it that doesn’t want to be a father - you, or your fiance?”
“I understand, I guess.” Potter finishes. “I wasn’t the best husband, too busy all the time with my job, especially in the early years while we worked to set up the department.”
“Aunt Pansy is never getting married.” Pansy interjected. “She’s going to become a fabulous spinster and leave all her money to her very favourite Malfoy and her kneazle, Bitsy.”
“I thought I banned that enchanted glass from my house?” Draco attempted to take it from her but Pansy only giggled, backing away from him and into Harry who grabbed her shoulders to steady her.
“Look Professor, I don’t want to be rude-”
“Well, Ron and Hermione already know you and they think you’re fantastic. Mrs. Weasley will love you because I do. Luna doesn’t hate anyone. Don’t let the blokes get to you, and all you’ll have left is Ginny - you must remember her from our school days?” Harry paused, then decided to be truthful. “She’s the worst of the lot, really.”
Draco checked the clock on the mantelpiece. “I’m going to be late.” He said, reaching over to give Scorpius a hug. The small boy moved out of the way.
There was a cacophony of noise as everyone tried to introduce themselves at once. Ron pressed a beer into Harry’s hand as he and Anthony sat at the table.
“It’s fine.” More than fine, really. Draco has been enjoying himself, listening to Potter speak. It reminds him of when Ernest first started practising law and was determined to represent every person in magical Britain should they need a barrister. While Ernest’s enthusiasm has waned considerably over the years, it’s clear that Potter has both a personal and professional attachment to his job.
“Oh, okay.” Scorpius was already absorbed in the letter.
“I’m sorry, Harry. I don’t think I realized how different our two futures looked until we really started to socialize with your extended family and I realized that you enjoy the chaos of a house full of children. I don’t. I think this will be best for us both, you’d only resent me if we married and stayed childless. And I can’t get in the way of doing a good deed either, I think moving Andy and Teddy into Grimmauld is a lovely, kind idea. You’re a wonderful man, and once some time has passed, I hope we can truly be friends.”
“Maybe. Or maybe I’m looking for reasons to run, Hermione says I should talk to him but there’s something miss-” Harry stopped, embarrassed. “I’m talking too much about this.”
Scorpius nodded.
The end!
Harry groans and re-adjusts his grip. “That doesn’t mean I know how to do this! Neglectful childhood, remember? Besides, you’re clearly cheating.” He twists his hand, sending the line of little green figures twirling, but it’s not enough to stop the ball Draco has shot toward his goal.
Pansy sniffed disdainfully and sipped her drink. “I went to Italy after the war - my mum’s family, the Arcuris, all live in the south of the country. I’ve only been back here a few years and I hardly have time for gossip.”

“Papa!” Scorpius cried, immediately stomping across the room to bury his face in Draco’s side.
The man didn’t speak for a moment, and when he did his voice was tight. “I - I thought we were doing okay. Do you think you need another parent?”
“I should head out” Daphne says, appearing beside him with Parvati Patil's newest romance novel tucked into the crook of her arm. “I have a hair appointment at ten and...Draco...is that Harry Potter starting at you from the magical maladies section?”
“That’s—" Harry began, but she interrupted him.
Malfoy finally said, simply, ‘I can’t.’
He had been trying to come up with a name for the little creature for a month now, but nothing seemed to stick. Ginny had offered at least forty suggestions, though recently he'd asked her to stop—only because she looked hurt each time he dismissed one.
“You’ve gone fucking mad, Potter,” Malfoy screeched, and shouted a desperate “
'Yeah,' Lisa Turpin chimed in. 'Every morning I have to get up and look at Mandy's empty bed. Professor Flitwick said we weren't allowed to Banish furniture that belongs to the school but I'm thinking of trying anyway, it's bad enough that I keep finding her things in my trunk.'
Harry can't see Malfoy through the darkness, but at Malfoy's tone, he can tell that he's smirking.  'Afraid I'll try to kill you, Potter?  All alone up here, nobody watching us?'
'You already agreed to come,' Harry interrupts, fed up.  'What's the matter now?  Can't you Apparate?'
'She's my
“You knew?” Harry shouted, interrupting Remus. His chair flew back as he leapt to his feet. “You fucking knew the whole time, you—" Suddenly, it dawned on him, and something clenched tight in his stomach. Dully, he said, “That’s why you apologized to me outside the Three Broomsticks. That’s why you demanded to practice Defense right away. Right?”
Harry was about to suggest that it could be Nott—he didn’t know any other Slytherins out of their year, come to think of it—but they’d reached Hagrid’s and Hermione was knocking enthusiastically on the door. Whether her enthusiasm was borne of excitement to see Hagrid or gratitude for an end to the Quidditch discussion, it was unclear.
'Kreacher,' Harry says, 'and Dobby, you too, you've been following Malfoy, haven't you been?  Did you see where Snape took him after they fled from Hogwarts?  Do you know where they were?'
They sat in silence for another few moments. And then, as simple as that, as if nothing had been said between Harry’s entrance into the room and now, Tonks flashed him a grin and said, “Gave me the shock of a lifetime to see you in that club.”
'He ought to take a potion for that,' an unpleasant voice says from above Harry's bed.  Harry jumps, but it's only Phineas, and Harry says hopefully,
It was not Hogwarts, not the Hogwarts he had known, not really; it was all different.
"You don't
'Do something,' Ron repeated. He was eyeing the warmth of the common room. 'About what?'
“I,” Harry said, hoarsely, “I uh, really like you, Tonks—" He halted again. It felt strange to be calling her Tonks when she had her hand halfway up his thigh and was smiling at him so.
She gave him her saddest smile and he wondered when she had grown up; looking at her now, she did look older, no longer a girl, not his best friend's younger sister. She was the same Ginny—his Ginny, he'd thought—with the smattering of freckles across her nose like spilt cinnamon and her warm brown eyes, but for a moment she looked like a stranger.
“Tell your Mudblood to watch her back,” Malfoy spat, just then, and Harry whirled around. He had thought all the Slytherins had gone. “It’s only a matter of time.”
Malfoy lifts his upper lip.  'Well, I certainly don't want her filth in my breakfast—'
'I saw that, Ron Weasley,' Hermione says.  'And before you go comparing me to your mum, you ought to think about how hard she has to work in the kitchen with no help from a house full of people.'
Malfoy flushed. 'Better than being startled by you in my own house, Potter, I thought I'd pre-empt one of your surprise visits.'
He was reaching for his broomstick in the Quidditch changing room . . . he was writing lines in Umbridge’s office as she smiled sweetly at him . . . Fudge was pumping his hand . . . Dudley was using his piggy arm to hold him underwater as he struggled in vain . . . Tonks was grinning at him as she said, languidly, “Come here” . . .
They rushed around the corner, then, and drew up short, Hermione grasping his wrist in surprise. Outside the usual classroom, students were milling, and the classroom door was shut. Anthony caught sight of them and waved.
“Think about it,” was all Harry said. He tucked his wand into his pocket before he turned away.
