“He hasn’t made a single attempt at approaching me for a week! I thought he loved me. Or was that all a lie to make me less angry at him?!” I blurted out when I was sitting in the common room along with Ron and Hermione at the end of the week. From the corner of my eye, I could see Ron and Hermione exchange worried looks. “Look mate, Malfoy is probably just trying to give you some space to cool off after your last encounter. I’m sure He will be back at trying to apologize soon.” Ron said, his voice sounded a little nervous. Hermione nodded her head. “I’m positive Ron is right, just give it a few more days maybe?” She added, she sounded nervous as well. “Honestly, guys, you don’t have to keep treating me like I’m a fragile piece of porcelain. I’m fine.” I said with a sigh when I noticed their worried looks. “If it really bothers you that much, why don’t you talk to him? Be the bigger person Harry, I know you’re still angry at him, but deep down you still love him. If you didn’t, Draco not talking to you wouldn’t bother you this much.” Hermione added carefully. Her voice indicated that she was a bit nervous about how I would react. I sighed heavily. I knew she was right. I still loved Draco, even though he had treated me terribly, I just wasn’t ready to admit it yet. I stood up and started walking towards the portrait hole. “Where are you going mate?” Ron asked confused when he saw me get up and leave. “I have made up my mind. If Draco won’t come to me, I will go to him. I have an itch that only Draco knows how to scratch.” I replied and left the common room. I could hear Ron’s and Hermione’s confused voices behind me after the portrait had swung back in place, but I didn’t care. All I cared about was finding Draco, and I knew just where to look for him.
For the next few days, I tried my best to pretend like everything was normal, but I was slowly losing it. I needed answers to my questions but I knew the only way I would get them, was to meet up with Draco again. Part of me really wanted to see Draco again, but I knew it would be difficult to get a hold on him. I couldn’t just walk up to him and ask him to follow me somewhere more private so we could talk. I had to be smart about this, but I just couldn’t figure out what to write in that stupid note. I considered just being straight up with him and tell him exactly how I felt. I tried asking Hermione what she would’ve done, without telling her exactly what was going on, but she wasn’t of much help. I knew Ron wouldn’t be able to help either, so I was pretty much all alone with this. It was frustrating and it got to a point where I started to give up on the idea of ever getting the answers I wanted. But then one day Neville came running into the common room with a small piece of paper and waved it at me. “I found this outside Harry. You must be really popular.” He said and handed over the note. I only needed to take a quick look at it before I knew who it was from. I felt my heart skip a beat when I opened it.
As the fourth year went by Draco and I kept meeting different places around the castle in secret. And step by step we took a little bit further every time we met. We basically spend most of the year messing around and testing each other’s limits. I guess you could say that we were just trying to distract ourselves from the inevitable, the summer break. Neither one of us were looking forward to spending two months not being able to see each other. I think Draco had started to soften up whenever he was around me. His usual spiteful self, kind of disappeared over the past few months. I tried to talk to him about taking the next step and start dating, but every time I tried to open that conversation he shut me down saying he wasn’t ready to make us an official thing yet and that we still had to figure out a bunch of stuff before we should tell anyone about us. I would be lying if I said that it didn’t hurt, but I knew that nothing good would come out of pushing him.
I wandered the castle for what felt like hours until my feet started hurting and my stomach growled loudly to inform me that I should probably get some food soon. I looked at the giant clock in the clocktower. “Almost diner time-“ I mumbled and decided to head towards The Great hall, by the time I got there it would be time for dinner.
.” He said and nodded his head towards me. Hermione gasped and her eyes darkened. “Ronald Weasley! You take that back, right this instant!” Hermione hissed angrily. The air in here was suffocating and the way Ron was looking at me made me squirm on the inside. I felt disgusting and filthy. I had to get out of there, and fast.
I moved away from Draco’s thighs to remove his pants completely. His cock was throbbing impatiently beneath the fabric of his boxers, yet Draco didn’t make an effort to take care of it. I could feel Draco’s gaze resting on me as I removed his pants. ‘He really is expecting me to do all the work. This guy-‘ I thought to myself and looked up to meet Draco’s eyes. “What?” I asked and shot him an annoyed look. I was starting to get a bit impatient. Teasing Draco had made me hard as well and my cock made a small impatient throb, which made me bite down on my lip to muffle the moan. It was getting harder to contain them the longer Draco dragged this out. I sent Draco an impatient look and watched as the smirk on his lips grew bigger. “I thought you never wanted to see me again, let alone let me touch you?” He questioned and tilted his head slightly to the side while looking at me. My cheeks went red as I stared back at him. “Shut it. Do you want me or not?” I asked and ignored the fact that my cheeks were now burning. I had a feeling that my face was as red as a tomato, but right now I couldn’t care less. I had an ich that I needed scratched and Draco was the only person who knew just how to do so. That was all I needed from Draco right now. If I still hated him when we were done, I could always go back to not talking to him if that was what I felt like.
Days passed and I started to miss Draco less day by day. I was simply too busy during the day and too tired to think about anything before going to sleep. Most nights my head barely even hit the pillow before I was gone, but the few evenings I didn’t fall asleep instantly my thoughts weren’t focused on Draco, they were focused on next year’s semester on Hogwarts instead. I would be lying if I said that I had completely forgotten about Draco, because a few days before leaving to go back to Hogwarts an unknown owl arrived with a letter addressed to me but with the Weasley home’s address on it. I took one look at the letter and immediately knew who it was from. I could recognize that handwriting anywhere. I took a deep breath and shakily opened the letter, and oh Merlin was I surprised. Draco had practically sent me a novel in the letter.
I arrived at the West Wing shortly after I had agreed to meet up with Harry. I waited around the entrance anxiously for Harry to arrive as well. The picture in front of the entrance started to move and my heart skipped a beat before I noticed that it was just Harry. Apparently, he had never left his common room. “You scared me Potter-“ I said and looked at Harry. He looked like he hadn’t been sleeping for several days and he had large dark circles under his eyes. He didn’t say anything but just responded with pulling me inside the common room. His face lit up in a bright but tired smile once we were both inside. “You look awful Potter. Are you okay? Should I leave so you can rest?” I asked silently and stepped towards the backside of the painting leading back out to the hallway. “No.” Harry said and grabbed my wrist before pulling me upstairs to the boys’ dorm.
from your best friends?!” Ron yelled at me and I instinctively pulled my outstretched hand back. “Why are you getting so upset over this, Ron?” I asked, trying to stay calm, but the tears in my eyes had already started to run down my cheeks. “Because you literally fucked the enemy Harry!” The words stung. How could he say that? “Draco is
something that would have expected. I walked in on Ron and Hermione fighting. “What the hell is going on here?” I asked, interrupting their shouting at each other. I looked back and forth between them, but neither of them said a word. “Well? Aren’t you at least going to tell me what you’re fighting about?” I asked impatiently. Ron just glared at me, his eyes darkening and flashing with anger. “Well, wouldn’t
I quickly straddled Draco’s thighs and pulled his vest off before unbuttoning his shirt. My hands were a bit shaky, but I managed to get his shirt unbuttoned without too much trouble. Draco leaned back on his elbows and watched me carefully as I started fiddling with his belt to unbuckle it. He just sat there, a soft smirk curving on his lips. ‘Is he seriously just going to sit there and let me do all the work?’ I thought to myself as I finally managed to open his belt. It was no surprise to see that Draco had already started to get hard, even though I had barely even touched him yet. I allowed myself to smirk softly as I started to slowly rub Draco through his pants. He let out a quiet moan and I could feel him harden even more through his pants. He must have really been longing for me. I could feel myself harden as well and tried to muffle a soft moan by biting down on my bottom lip. There was a soft smirk curving on Draco’s lips as he continued to watch me. He let out a deep breathy sigh as I leaned in to kiss his neck. Draco was now rock hard, and I couldn’t help but smirk satisfied to myself. I decided to tease him even more and started to place gentle love bites all around his neck, just to see his reaction. Draco moaned softly and let his head fall slightly backwards to give me some more space to work with.
After dinner I went straight back to my room, excusing myself with homework that I needed to get done. I closed the door to my room behind me and slowly let myself sink down onto the floor, back pressed against the door. ‘If only I could see you Harry- I want to hold you and tell you how much you mean to me-‘ I thought to myself and let my mind wander for a bit. I think I must have fallen asleep at some point, because I woke up to the sound of my head hitting the floor. That was definitely going to bruise and swell at some point later on. I looked around my room and realized that it had gotten quite dark outside. I checked the time and it was past midnight, which meant that my parents had gone to sleep. ‘Now’s my chance to send the letter.’ I carefully opened my door and made sure that it wouldn’t creak as I opened it. I snuck out and tiptoed down the hallways until I reached our small owlery. I gave the letter to one of the owls and sent it away before sneaking back into my room to go to bed.
I remember Draco telling me that he had always really liked the night sky, so I decided that the first place I would look for him was the astronomy tower. I quietly moved up the stairs to the astronomy tower. As soon as I was close enough to the end of the stairs, I immediately noticed the back of Draco’s head. His perfectly platinum blonde hair was lit up by the moon and was shining beautifully. He was standing with his back turned towards the stairs, so surprising him wouldn’t be an issue. I stopped in my tracks to consider my next move; should I just casually walk up next to him without saying a word and wait for him to notice me? Or should I maybe sneak up behind him and cover his eyes to have him guess who it was? I had so many options and I just couldn’t choose between them. But before I even got to decide Draco started to move. ‘Shit, he’s going to turn around and notice me before I can even come up with a decent plan.’ I knew I had to act quickly, and I was starting to panic slightly. A last-minute decision resulted in me leaning against the stone wall at the top of the stairs, trying to look as casual as I possibly could. I quickly folded my arms across my chest, to make it look even more casual, right before Draco turned around and saw me standing there. That’s when I noticed it; his eyes were red and puffy like he had been crying recently. Draco froze on the spot when he saw me leaning against the wall. He opened his mouth to say something but quickly shut it again, almost as if he had changed his mind. His gaze was glued to the ground in front of him and he looked a bit uneasy. The silence was killing me, but I didn’t know what to say either.
When it was finally time to head out the butterflies in my stomach slowly started to wake up and my heart started racing as I walked down the hallways towards the study room. I arrived with a few minutes to spare, but that just gave me more time to try to figure out how I would like to approach this whole thing. After debating with myself for what felt like ages, I decided to just see where things went once Draco arrived and what he wanted from me. I walked over to the nearest table from the door and decided to sit down while waiting. It was now 11:59 pm, which meant that Draco was on his way and could arrive any second. Just like last time he arrived as soon as the hands reached 12:00 am. Seeing him again was felt like small fireworks inside my chest. I sent him a shy smile and waved softly. “So.. You wanted to see me again?” I asked silently and looked over at the door where Draco was leaned against he doorframe with his arms crossed across his chest. He just stood there with the most casual facial expression I had ever seen anyone make. “Yeah.. I guess I did?” He responded and slowly started walking towards me. His casual expression changed into a more confident smile that slowly turned into a soft smirk the closer to me he got. He stopped right in front of me and tilted his head slightly to the right while looking at me. “What’s the matter Potter? You seem a little out of it. I’m not making you nervous, am I?” he said as he gently grabbed my chin and lifted my head to make me look at him. “N-no.. Not at all.” I barely managed to get the words out without stuttering. My heart was racing in my chest and all I could think about was how badly I wanted him to kiss me again. I wanted to feel his lips on mine. “Kiss me.. Please?” I asked softly, still looking up at him. I could see his eyes spark for a second and it was clear that he was considering his next move. “And what if I don’t want to?” He teased and leaned in to teasingly pretend to kiss me before gently pulling away right before our lips met. “Please Draco.. I can’t think about anything else. I need you to kiss me again..” I pleaded and stretched to get closer to him. “You’re lucky that I think you’re cute, Potter.” He said and leaned back in, but this time he didn’t pull away right before our lips met. This time he kissed me for real. I wrapped my arms around his shoulders and gently pulled him closer to me. I could tell that he wanted to kiss me too, because he didn’t resist when I pulled him closer. This kiss was much more passionate than the first one had been. I slowly stood up from the table making sure not to break the kiss while I got up. I think Draco understood where I was going with this because the next thing I know is Draco gently grabbing my shoulders and turning us slightly around backing us up towards the wall. Once we reached the wall the kiss had turned from passionate to straight up lustful. Draco elegantly slid my robe off of my shoulders and was now untying my tie. Meanwhile I was struggling with Draco’s tie, but he didn’t seem to care at all. I finally managed to get it untied and slid off his robe before fumbling with the buttons on his shirt. Draco didn’t seem to have any issues with unbuttoning my shirt at all. He let his hand slide up my chest as I finished unbuttoning his shirt. We paused for a second only to catch our breaths. I let my hands slowly run up and down Draco’s perfectly formed chest. Without hesitation Draco pulled away and broke the kiss. We were both panting, and I looked at Draco in confusion. “Did I do something wrong?” I asked silently. Draco shook his head and a small smirk spread across his lips. “No, not at all. I just got an idea.” He said as the smirk curving his lips grew bigger and bigger. “Do you trust me, Potter?” Draco asked and looked at me, his head slightly tilted. “Mhmm.” I barely managed to answer his question. I wanted more and kissing just wasn’t enough at this point. I noticed the sparks in Draco’s eyes when he asked me to close my eyes, which I more than willingly did. I gasped softly in surprise when I felt Draco’s lips on my left collarbone. He started kissing along both collarbones and slowly worked his way down my chest and onto my stomach. Draco had now reached the hem of my jeans and teasingly kissed my hipbone. I had to bite my lip to mask the small moans I so desperately wanted to let out. Draco effortlessly unbuttoned and unzipped my jeans end gently pulled them down. I wasn’t sure for how much longer I would be able to hold back my moans. Draco teasingly pulled on the hem of my boxers with his teeth. “What’s the matter, Potter? You’re looking rather tense.” Draco said and looked up at me from the floor. A confident smirk spread across his hips as he kept teasing me. Fighting the moans got harder and harder the more Draco teased me. “You’re r-really enjoying this, aren’t y-you?..” I managed to ask even though every time I tried to open my mouth there was a moan trying to escape. At last I decided that I didn’t care anymore, it had now gotten way too hard to hide my moans. As soon as the first moan escaped me, I quickly covered my mouth and felt the blood rise in my cheeks. I didn’t expect it to be that loud and it was so embarrassing to say the least. I heard Draco softly chuckle at my reaction. “Ha, that’s cute, Potter. You’re so much fun to tease.” He said and slowly started to pull on my boxers. Draco effortlessly pulled down my boxers. I instinctively looked away to hide my face that was just as red as a tomato by now. “Don’t be shy Potter, I want to see and everything. Don’t hide from me.” He said and gently grabbed a hold of my member and slowly started moving his hand up and down. I bit down on my lip hard and muffled a moan. I looked down at Draco who was smirking up at me as he kept moving his hand. I reached down to tangle my fingers in Draco’s soft hair and gently pulled on it. We were both breathing heavily, and I could see in Draco’s eyes that I wasn’t the only one wanting more.
Harry was leaning against the doorframe leading to the study room where we usually met up. I noticed something different about Harry’s face almost instantly and I could feel the anger well up inside of me and I had to clench my fists. “Potter, what the hell happened to your face?” I asked and took a deep breath to calm myself down. Harry flinched at the sound of anger in my voice. “I- It’s nothing. Ron and I just had a disagreement, that’s all.” He said and looked away to hide his face from me. I sighed heavily and firmly grabbed Harry’s chin to force him to look at me.  “A disagreement you say. And just how did
Half an hour passed, and I heard footsteps coming up the stairs. “I thought I told you to leave!” I yelled without looking up to see who the footsteps belonged to. “Relax mate, it’s just me.” I heard Ron’s voice in the doorway. I looked up and saw Ron standing in the doorway to the dorm. I sighed in relief but stayed on the floor hugging my knees tightly. The shaking had stopped, but tears were still rolling down my cheeks. Ron came over and sat down on the floor next to me, gently wrapping an arm around my shoulders. “Are you okay? I heard you yelling at Malfoy to leave. He looked terribly upset when he left. Did you two have a fight or something?” he asked quietly and gave my shoulders a soft squeeze. I looked up at Ron, eyes red and puffy from all the crying. “He bit me Ron- Like really bit me, my shoulder is bleeding. And He was acting really strange, almost as if he was an animal- It was scary-“ I muttered. For a second, I saw some kind of ‘Oh crap, this can’t be happening’ look on Ron’s face but it disappeared again just as quickly as it had appeared. “Ron, is there something you’re not telling me?” I asked and noticed Ron squirm uncomfortably next to me. Ron looked extremely uncomfortable, almost like he was hiding a huge secret that he really wanted to tell but knew he couldn’t. I looked firmly at him even though my face was wet with tears. “Ronald Weasley, if there is something important I should know, I demand that you tell me. Right now.” Ron once again squirmed next to me and I could tell that there was something he was not telling me. I cleared my throat and shook Ron’s arm off my shoulders before getting up from the floor. “Alright, if you don’t want to tell me I’ll just find Hermione and have her tell me.” I said and headed for the door. I heard Ron scramble up from the floor behind me. “Harry wait up- There is something you should know-“ He started off and I turned around to look at him. “Go on, I’m listening.” I said and folded my arms across my chest. Ron fiddled nervously with his hands in front of him before continuing. “Well, uhm- I’ve spoken to Malfoy recently and he told me he was an Alpha. I’m really not the right person to be having this conversation with- Madam Pomfrey, Professor McGonagall, Dumbledore or even Professor Snape would be a better person to talk to about this-“ Ron trailed off when he saw how confused I looked. “I can come with you if you’d like?” He offered and walked up beside me. I sighed heavily and shook my head. “I’m good. Thanks for cheering me up though-“ I muttered and left. I needed to get out of there to clear my mind.
After a few hours my hand was sore and dried out blood covered most of my hand. Umbridge had allowed me to leave and as I was hurrying down to hallways to get back to my common room I ran into Draco. He had been on his way to meet me outside of the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom and walk with me once my detention was over. I instinctively pulled my sore hand back as I tried to hide it. Draco, being observant as always, noticed and grabbed it. I winced in pain and shut my eyes to force back a few tears. “What the hell happened to your hand Potter?!” Draco asked angrily. Even though I knew he wasn’t mad at me, I still couldn’t help but flinch a little. “I- Uhm- I’m not actually sure how this happened-“ I mumbled and tried to pull my hand back. “But I’m sure it’s nothing. She probably just wanted to teach me a lesson. I’ll be fine, don’t worry about it.” I quickly added when I noticed Draco’s eyes darkening. I softly placed my other hand on Draco’s chest to try to calm him down. I could feel his heart hammering in anger. “Draco look at me.” I said and slowly brought my hand up to Draco’s cheek and gently pushed his head to look in my direction. “I’m fine, honestly. You don’t need to worry about me, okay? It will heal in a couple of days and then it will be gone.” I said and softly stroked Draco’s cheek. He brought a hand up and placed it on top of mine. He tilted his head slightly and leaned into my touch. “I know-“ He sighed and closed his eyes to calm down. He stood there with his eyes closed for a little while. “I just- I wish I could do something. We can’t let her get away with this, we have to tell Dumbledore.” He said and opened his eyes again. “I’d rather not- He’s been very busy lately and I don’t know if it’s a good idea to bother him-“ I mumbled and slowly pulled my hand back. Draco sighed resignedly. He knew he wouldn’t get anything out of trying to discuss this with me right now. “Fine, whatever floats your boat. But will you at least let me follow you back to your common room then?” He asked annoyed. I nodded and took Draco’s hand. We walked in silence until we reached the entrance to the Gryffindor common room. “thank you for coming to get me.” I mumbled and looked up at Draco with a shy smile. Draco smiled back, but it wasn’t genuine. I could tell something was bothering him. “Yeah no problem. Any time.” He said and placed a soft kiss on my forehead. “See you in class tomorrow-“ He mumbled and turned around to leave. I quickly grabbed his wrist and pulled him back. “Where do you think you’re going?” I asked a bit annoyed. “Did I say I wanted you to leave?” I added and saw the confused look on Draco’s face. I couldn’t help but enjoy this a little. I had tasted the sweet feeling of control and I wanted to see how far I could take it.
It felt like it took Madam Norris ages to pass by, but I wasn’t complaining. I got to be close to Draco and feel the heat from his body against mine. When she was finally gone Draco and I both started laughing and Draco hesitantly pulled away. “Well, I guess we’ll have to continue this some other time then? What do you say Potter, are you up for that?” Draco asked still chuckling softly. “Yeah, definitely. But we should probably rethink the next location to somewhere Madam Norris don’t come around.” I replied and rubbed my neck awkwardly before picking up my tie. Draco nodded and picked his tie up as well. We got dressed and left the study room separately just in case.
All I could do was watch as Harry got more and more angry. He kept shouting despite the fact that I tried to shush him so we wouldn’t get caught, that only seemed to make ham even angrier. “Harry- Please keep your voice down- Someone might hear you-“ I tried but Harry quickly cut me off and snapped back “I will not keep my voice down just because it makes you uncomfortable-“ He trailed off and looked at me. I think he realized that his words had hurt me because he fell quiet after that and quickly turned away before walking out the door. But the words he said right before leaving were the words that hurt the most. “I can’t do this anymore Draco- I’m done.” And then he was gone. I heard running in the hallway, so I followed and tried to shout at him to wait, but he didn’t seem to care at all, he just kept running. And just like that I was alone in the big hallway. I decided to go back to clean the study room before going to bed. I felt something that I had never thought I would ever feel over anyone and especially not Potter. I felt hurt and betrayed Tears were slowly running down my cheeks and before I knew it, I was sitting on my knees, sobbing into one of the pillows. ‘No- This is stupid. Why the hell am I crying over Potter?’ I thought to myself and wiped the tears off my face before quickly emptying the room and went straight to bed afterwards.
I read this amazing story by Becstar7 some time ago and got inspired. (I hope they don't mind that I've used their story as inspiration *-*)
I arrived at The Great Hall just as the clock stroke 6 pm. I could hear the other students walking down the hallways. I quickly found myself a seat at the Gryffindor table and waited for Ron and Hermione to arrive as well. It only took a few minutes for them to arrive, but the wait felt like hours. Ron and Hermione were happily chatting about school as they reached the table. “Harry, you look awful. Are you okay?” Hermione immediately asked after taking a quick look at me. I sighed heavily and shook my head. “Honestly, no. I’m far from okay. Draco and I had a huge fight earlier, turns out he’s an Alpha or whatever, he’s about to enter his first rut and there is a very high chance of me being an Omega, or whatever it was Draco and Professor McGonagall called it, if that is the case I might go into my first heat soon. I’m not ready to turn into some horny animal just because my body suddenly has decided it’s time-“ I buried my face in my hands and groaned in frustration. I didn’t have to look at them to know Ron and Hermione were exchanging worried looks. “Alright, whatever you two are thinking, spit it out. My day can’t possibly get any worse.” I said and removed my hands to look back and forth between them. Neither of them seemed very eager to talk and I was starting to get annoyed with all the secrets. I grabbed something to eat that I could bring with me back to the common room, I wasn’t hungry all of a sudden. I shrugged it off and got up from the bench. “Well, since none of you want to tell me what you know I’ll see you later. I’m going to bed early; I don’t feel so well.” I mumbled and left.
It felt good to finally tell someone about Harry and I knew I could trust my mother not to tell anyone before I was ready. My mother and I talked for a very long time before one of the house elves came knocking on the door, announcing that dinner was ready. We went down to eat together, and I silently thanked my mother for listening and comforting me. I even told her that I love her, which made her light up in the brightest smile. She had always been kind to me and had always tried to understand me instead of just scolding me whenever I did something wrong, or wrong according to my father who was a lot less understanding. We ate in silence, but we always did, so it didn’t really bother me. I was just glad that it had been my mother who came to check on me and not my father.
After what felt like hours of thinking, I decided that I would try to write him a letter telling him how sorry I was and how I really felt. That turned out to be a lot harder than I originally had thought it out to be. I rapidly went through the papers, crumbling them up, scratching things and words out, starting over what felt like a million times before I had finally written something that I felt was good enough and expressed how I felt.
I woke up the next morning to Crabbe and Goyle standing on either side of my bed, just staring at me. I quickly sat up and glared at them. “What is it?” I snarled and yawned. They looked carefully at each other before Crabbe spoke. “We are just worried about you, that’s all.” He said and Goyle nodded in agreement. “Yeah, you don’t seem to be sleeping very well lately.” He added. I sighed and slowly ran a hand through my hair before getting out of bed. “Well- I guess I just have a lot on my mind lately-“ I said and completely ignored them for the rest of the morning. I was happy to be leaving the school when it was finally time. I just wanted to get out of there as fast as I could, not that I was excited to go home, but I just needed to get away. The train ride back to London felt like it took days instead of hours. Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle kept talking about all these unimportant things the entire way back. It was starting to get on my nerves because all I wanted to do was shout at them to shut up. I wanted to tell them what was going on, but I couldn’t bring myself to do it. So, I just pretended to listen and occasionally smiled or nodded whenever it fit into their conversation.
The fight with Harry from last night kept playing on repeat in my head and each time I came up with a new way that I could have stopped Harry from leaving. ‘If only I had been honest about how I feel-‘ I kept thinking to myself and sighed silently. ‘Maybe if I take a nap? -‘ I closed my eyes and slowly drifted off. It wasn’t a very pleasant nap though, images of last night and the way Harry had looked at me, puffy and teary eyes. It was devastating to re-watch the fight, and I don’t know how I didn’t notice how much my words had hurt Harry last night, but I could see it crystal clear now. I must have been mumbling in my sleep because suddenly, I felt a hand on my shoulder, shaking me gently. “Draco, are you okay? You seem pretty stressed out about something.”  I slowly opened my eyes only to find Pansy directly in front of my face. I gasped in surprise and tried to move away only to realize that I had somehow curled myself up in the corner closest to the window, so there was nowhere to move way to. I groaned in frustration and shoved Pansy out of my face. “have neither of you heard about the term ‘personal space’ before?” I asked annoyed and looked between the three of them, arms crossed over my chest. “Sure, I have,” Pansy grinned and continued, “I just choose not to follow it.” I rolled my eyes at her and sighed in relief as a familiar building appeared further ahead.
as I read through the letter, I could feel tears of joy forming in my eyes and before I knew it, they dripped onto the letter in my hands.
When we finally arrived at the train station at Hogwarts everyone hurried out of the train to get to their bags and other belongings. I stayed in my seat a little longer to try to avoid the chaos there would be on the platform. After a few minutes it appeared the worst part was over, so I got up and exited the train to find my things. The chaos was winding down and people were disappearing from the platform after gathering their belongings. I quickly located my bags and picked them up before heading up towards the castle. In the corner of my eyes I saw a familiar silhouette. Harry was walking beside me. Suddenly all my confidence from earlier was gone and I didn’t know what to say or do. “Hi- I uhm- It’s nice to see you again Potter-“ I managed to get out. Harry slowly turned his head and then realized who he was walking beside. His face turned as red as a tomato and I couldn’t help but smile. Harry stopped dead in his tracks and looked at me. “I- Thanks. It’s good to see you again too-“ He mumbled and clenched his fist around a piece of paper. It took me a few minutes before I recognized the paper and my eyes widened. He was holding my letter in his hand. It made me incredibly happy to see that the letter had arrived in time. “Harry listen- About our fight before the holiday- I really am so-“ But I didn’t get to finish my sentence before harry cut me off. “Do you really mean it?” He asked silently. When I looked confused at him, he held up the letter. “Do you really mean it?” he asked again, this time loud and clear and I swear if we hadn’t been the only two people left on the platform I would’ve probably tried to shush him. I looked at harry with a sheepish smile. “I do. Harry I’m really sorry about how I’ve treated you- I should’ve been honest with you, and myself as well-“ Next thing I know is Harry throwing himself at me, wrapping his arms tightly around my waist. I was taken by surprise and we almost stumbled to the ground. I could Harry quietly sob into my chest and the only thing I could think of at that moment was gently stroking his hair, trying my best to comfort him.
me?!” He yelled angrily. I lazily sat up and raised an eyebrow at him. “Do you honestly think that little of me?” I asked quietly, trying my best not to sound or look hurt. I had said and done things to Harry during his heat that I wouldn’t normally have, but I hadn’t raped him. Harry kept accusing me of rape until I finally got enough. “Shut up! Listen to me! I did
I laughed for good five minutes straight before finally composing myself enough to stop laughing and cleared my throat before speaking. “Uhm, yeah- Anyways, this is how things are. I’m dating Draco now-“ I said a bit flustered and looked at Draco for some backup of some sort, but all I got was a cheeky smile. I frowned at him and he just shrugged it off. “Gee, thanks for the support I guess-“ I said which made Draco chuckle. “Yeah no problem babe. Anytime.” He answered and placed a soft kiss on my forehead. I rolled my eyes at him and considered shoving him out of bed before I remembered that we were both naked underneath the covers. A faint blush spread on my cheeks and I cleared my throat. “uhm, guys, would you mind?” I asked and gestured to the pile of clothing at the bottom of my bed. Dean and Seamus hurried out of the dorm room while Ron stayed. “Relax mate, I’ll turn around-“ He said and rolled his eyes at us before turning around. I quickly grabbed my clothes and got dressed. Draco didn’t seem to be in that much of a hurry, but he got dressed as well.  Ron cleared his throat impatiently which made Draco snort slightly. “What’s the matter Weasley? Are you jealous?” he teased, and Ron turned around only to find Draco trying to snake his arm around my waist. Ron opened his mouth to say something but quickly shut it again when he couldn’t think of anything to say. Draco smirked satisfied with himself and turned his attention back to me, completely ignoring Ron. “So, what should we do now? We’ve already missed half a school day, so I don’t see the point in going to class at this point.” But before I could answer Draco’s question, Ron cut in. “Oh yeah, that reminds me- Professor Umbridge asked me to remind you that you have detention with her this afternoon.” Draco snorted and looked firmly at me. “You? Detention? Since when did you of all people receive detention?” I then remembered that I had forgotten to tell Draco about my first encounter with our new professor in Defense Against the Dark Arts, Dolores Umbridge, also known as secretary of the Minister of Magic Cornelius Fudge. I think Ron sensed the tension between us and left mumbling something about having to find Hermione to ask her for help with his homework. I awkwardly scratched my neck and looked up at Draco. “I guess I forgot to tell you. But I managed to piss Umbridge off during our first lesson with her.” Draco’s eyes softened and he looked curious. “Well, how did you do it?” he asked, and I couldn’t help but smile softly. “Remember last summer during the finale of the Triwizard cup where Cedric was murdered?” Draco nodded. “It was Lord Voldemort who murdered him. Or well, technically it was Peter Pettigrew who fired the spell, but it was on Voldemort’s command-“ I trailed off trying to fight the awful memory of Cedric’s lifeless body in front of me. I took a deep breath and continued. “Umbridge went on and on about how we didn’t need to learn how to cast counter spells and stuff like that- I might have mentioned that Voldemort was back and out there gathering his strength for a return to finish what he started 15 years ago.” I casually shrugged like it was the most natural thing in the entire world. Draco laughed and gave me a soft kiss. “This is one of the many reasons I like you Potter.” He said and took my hand before walking out of the dorm room.
They stared at us for what felt like forever and it was starting to get extremely uncomfortable to say the least. Crabbe was the first to break the awkward silence they had created when they entered the dorm room. “Malfoy? What the hell is Potter doing in here? And why the hell are neither of you dressed properly?!” he blurted out while Goyle just stood there. I think he was just as uncomfortable with this whole situation as I was. Draco snorted and looked over at him. “Oh, I don’t know Crabbe. Maybe because we just had sex? Have you ever considered that I might be gay?” he said sarcastically, and I couldn’t help but smile slightly at the look on Crabbe’s face. This time it was Goyle who opened his mouth to speak. “Wait, hold on- So you’re saying that you and Potter are a thing now? I thought you hated his guts?” he asked confused and looked back and forth between Draco and I in the bed and Crabbe who just kept staring at us, mouth wide open and eyes wide with confusion. Draco just shrugged. “Well I obviously don’t, not anymore anyways.” He said and snaked an arm around me to pull me closer to him. My cheeks were burning with embarrassment but fighting Draco would only result in the cover sliding off, which was not on my list of things that I wanted to happen. None of this was on that list apart from being in Draco’s arms.
When morning came it felt like I had barely slept at all. I had been tossing and turning most of the time. I glanced around the dormitory and noticed that I was the only person awake. At first I found it a bit strange until I remembered what day it was. I had completely lost track of the days when my rut had started. I sat up in my bed and stretched lightly while suppressing a small yawn. Since I was already awake, I figured that I might as well just go take a shower, maybe that would help me figure out a plan. I got out of bed and walked over to my wardrobe to grab two clean towels. I didn’t give a damn about the creaking sound my wardrobe made as I opened it. I didn’t give a damn if I woke the others up. I swung the towels over my shoulder and walked out to the showers. I hung up my towel and turned on the water before getting undressed. As I stepped under the water, I let out a loud sigh. The warm water felt nice against my skin. I allowed my thoughts to start wandering while I was standing under the warm water. They kept circling around the way Harry had looked at me after we had both come to ourselves again after our rut and heat. Just the thought was enough to bring the tears back. I quickly blinked to make them disappear again before they could run down my cheeks, even though no one would notice if I had been crying in the shower. After a few minutes of trying to keep the tears away I gave up and just let them run. I hated that harry could make me feel this weak and vulnerable, but at the same time I didn’t hate it.
I had never thought that my first time would be with a guy, and especially not Draco. But here we were, laying tangled up in each other on the blankets Draco had arranged for us in the study room. We were enjoying the after shutters from our climaxes. I slowly turned around in Draco’s arms to look at him. “That was- Amazing!” I beamed up at him and sent him a smile. I was exhausted and a bit sore, but it was totally worth it. Looking back, I can’t imagine my first time being more perfect than it was. Sure, it was awkward at the start, but I think it would’ve been just as awkward if I had been with a girl. And to be honest, I was glad that Draco had taken the lead, because I wouldn’t have known what to do. Draco lazily looked back at me and smiled back. “Glad you liked it Potter.” He mumbled and sleepily rested his head on top of mine. We stayed like this, tangled up in each other for quite some time.
rape you.” I could feel my patience slowly slipping but I had promised myself that I wouldn’t lose my temper. I took a deep breath to calm myself down before continuing. “I don’t expect you to be okay with any of this. Quite the opposite, you can be angry with me all you like. But we both know deep down that you and I are made for each other. Our bond confirms that whether you like it or not.” I paused for a few seconds to observe Harry. He still looked angry, but he had stopped shaking and had now wrapped himself in the covers to keep himself warm. After a few seconds I spoke again. “I completely understand if you don’t want to be around me anymore when you’re not in heat. I won’t bother you anymore-“ I turned my head away from Harry so he wouldn’t see the tears in my eyes and got up from the bed to find my clothes. I quickly found my clothes and got dressed, keeping my back turned towards Harry to hide the tears. The fact that this hurt me so much meant that I really loved Harry, but I wasn’t so sure it was mutual anymore. I had to get out of there before I was no longer able to hold back the tears. “I know you probably hate me. But my feelings for you haven’t changed. I love you, Harry.” I said as I left the cell.
Later that afternoon Draco walked me to Umbridge’s office and gave me a soft kiss on the forehead. “I’ll see you later. Try not to piss her further off.” He said right before leaving. I took a deep breath and knocked softly on the door in front of me. Umbridge’s voice sent shivers down my spine when she answered my knock. I took another deep breath and entered her office. She greeted med with her overly enthusiastic smile and high-pitched voice. “Harry my boy! Here, take a seat.” She gestured towards a one-person desk and chair in front of her own desk. There was a piece of blank paper on the table, so naturally I assumed that she would have me write sentences, so I sat down at the chair.  I noticed that there was no quill on the desk and reached into my backpack to get my own. Umbridge stopped me before I could take out my own quill. “Oh no deer, today you will be using a very special quill. And you won’t need ink.” She said and handed me a quill that I had never seen before. “Okay- What would you like me to write then?” I asked confused. She thought for a moment before answering. “I want you to write ‘I must not tell lies’.” Still confused I started writing on the paper and to my surprise the quill started writing even though I hadn’t dipped the tip in any sort of ink. After finishing the sentence there was a sharp shot of pain on the back of my hand. I noticed that the words “I must not tell lies” started to take form on my hand. It stung and I had to grit my teeth. “And how many times would you like me to write this?” I asked. A nasty grin spread on Umbridge’s face as she answered. “As many times as, it takes for the message to sink in.”
Harry’s reaction was priceless. At first he just stared confused at the scenery, but then he realized what was going on and the biggest and brightest smile I have ever seen in my life spread across Harry’s lips and he turned to look at me. “Did you do all of this just for me?” He asked with watery eyes and a shaky voice. I nodded and smiled back at him. “Yeah. Like I wrote in the letter I know I haven’t been very good at showing you how much you actually mean to me, so this is me trying to make it up to you-“ I slowly rubbed the back of my neck and looked at Harry. “So uhm- Do you uhm- Do you like it?” Harry stared at me like I had said something wrong and I felt my heart slowly sink in my chest. “Like it? Oh Draco- I love it!” Harry then said and I couldn’t believe my own ears. I pulled Harry in for a hug and held him close. Harry tilted his slightly and looked up at me. “Can I kiss you Draco?” he asked softly. I didn’t hesitate, not even for just a second. I gently grabbed Harry’s chin and lifted his head slightly before placing my lips on top of his. I seductively ran my tongue along Harry’s bottom and let a soft moan escape my lips. Harry opened his mouth slightly and invited me in. I deepened the kiss and slid a hand up under Harry’s shirt to feel his skin. A soft moan escaped Harry’s lips and I could feel his body shiver slightly with anticipation. I smirked softly and slowly circled my tongue around inside Harry’s mouth, claiming it as mine.
We traveled back to the manor in silence, not that I mined, some peace and quiet was just what I needed. I hurried inside the manor once we got there completely ignoring both my parents shouting at me, asking why I was in such a hurry. I knew I had to make it up to Harry, but how? I flopped down onto my bed and buried my face in my pillow before letting out a long, frustrated groan. My thoughts whirled around, and I couldn’t concentrate on anything but how on earth I was supposed to give Harry a proper apology and make it up to him.
I ran down the hallways and almost knocked over Professor McGonagall. “Mr. Potter! Where do you think you’re going in such a hurry?” She asked and looked at me with her familiar stern look. I nervously looked over my shoulder before answering. “I’m sorry Professor, it’s just- I-“ The tears came back and I broke down crying in front of Professor McGonagall. “What’s the matter Potter? Are you hurt?” She asked and I could tell her expression had softened up one she saw my tears. I didn’t know where to even start. I wanted to tell her everything, but at the same time I didn’t want anyone to know. Ron already knew that Draco had bitten me, but that was it. I didn’t want more people to know if I could avoid it. I shook my head and hid my bloody shoulder with my robe. There was a long silence before I finally spoke. “Professor, what is an Alpha and an Omega?” I asked and watched as all the color drained from her face. She cleared her throat and pulled me aside. “Those are special terms we use the describe our behaviors. It’s a special old kind of magic we inherited from our ancestors. It’s very powerful and can overrule the laws of physics. Why do you ask Potter?”  My cheeks flushed a bright pink color as I fiddled nervously with my hands. “Well- It’s just that I’ve been seeing this person for a while now, and they’ve turned out to be an Alpha about to start their first Rut- And they think I have somehow triggered it by being an Omega about to go into my first heat-“ I mumbled and looked at the floor, too embarrassed to look at McGonagall. I could tell by the way the atmosphere around us changed that she was surprised by the news. She cleared her throat once more before speaking. “Well, if that is the case Potter, we better get you somewhere safe. Alphas can be very brutal when they’re in Rut and if word gets out there is an Omega in heat running around freely, there is no guarantee that you will make it till the end of your heat. Omegas produce a very sweet scent when they’re in heat to attract Alphas to mate with. That scent has an intoxicating effect on the Alphas and they become unable to think straight. If you combine that with an Alpha in Rut- That could end catastrophic.” McGonagall said quietly and sent me a worried smile. “But Professor- I’ve never heard of this before- Is there nothing I can do to stop this from happening to me?” I asked quietly and looked up at her, eyes wet and puffy from the tears. She shook her head and sent me a sad smile. “I’m afraid not Potter. We don’t get a say in whether we want to be Alphas, Betas or Omegas.” I looked confused at her and raised an eyebrow. “What’s a Beta?” Professor McGonagall had to restrain herself from rolling her eyes at me before she answered. “For goodness sake Potter- Sometimes I forget how little you know about our world.” She muttered softly and gave my shoulder a soft squeeze. “Promise me you will come straight to me if you start to feel any changes in your body.” She said and left me there in the hallway. She seemed to have been very busy when I bumped into her. I shrugged it off and started walking again. I still didn’t know where I should go, but the common room was not an option for me, neither were the dungeons, not right now at least.
’ My stream of thoughts was quickly brought to an end when Draco started caressing my body. There was something different about Draco this time. He was more eager to get me out of my robes than usual. He seemed to be extremely turned on for some reason. I decided to tease him and started to deliberately oppose Draco’s attempt of getting me naked, a cheeky smile spreading across my lips as I could see the frustration on Draco’s face. His eyes were darkening, and I knew that I was playing with fire, but I couldn’t help myself. “Damn it Potter! Why are you opposing me?” he asked irritated and looked down at me with furrowed brows. My cheeky smile grew slightly as I answered. “Why not?” I asked and shrugged. Somewhere inside Draco a flip was switched, and his frustration turned into a smirk and his eyes flashed with lust. “Okay. You want to play, Potter? Then let’s play.” He said and grabbed my wrists with one hand before forcing them above my head. He then proceeded to take his belt off and before I knew it Draco had wrapped his belt around my hands with his free hand and tied my hands along with the belt to the bedpost. I could feel myself starting to harden and squirmed slightly underneath Draco. “Oh really now? Does being tied up turn you on, Potter?” Draco asked and smirked down at me. “N-no- What gives you that idea?” I asked tried my best not to show it. Draco’s eyebrow twitched. He slowly ran a hand up my chest, from there it gently moved along my throat, stopping at the front of my jaw before it grabbed me and forced my eyes to meet Draco’s. “Unfortunately for you, Potter, I didn’t give you permission to get hard.” Draco said as the smirk on his lips grew bigger. “I can’t help it- You’re just so hot.” I replied and innocently looked at Draco. I had a feeling about where this was going, and I would be lying if I said that’s not what I wanted. My entire body was screaming for Draco to touch me. Draco must’ve noticed as well, but he didn’t say nor do anything. He just watched me continuing to squirm underneath him. At this point I was as hard as a rock and Draco still hadn’t touched me apart from the hand on my jaw. Even though this wasn’t Draco hadn’t seen before I was still embarrassed, and I could feel the color rise in my cheeks. Draco slightly tightened his grip on my jaw. “Oh my, look at this. Did I tell you that you had permission to get this hard yet?” He asked silently and tilted his head slightly. “N-no-“ I whimpered and looked up at Draco. “What are you going to do about it? Punish me?” I asked silently, awaiting Draco’s response. Draco didn’t answer, in fact, he didn’t move at all. He just sat there, watching me squirm uncomfortably underneath him, a smirk curving on his lips. I tried shoving Draco off me by moving my legs, but instead I accidentally kneed him right in the groin. Draco groaned and bend slightly forward. “Damn it Potter, what was that for?” Draco panted and looked annoyed at me. Still a little surprised at what had just happened I let out a small laugh. “I’m sorry Draco, I didn’t mean to:” But it was too late for apologies. Draco untied my hands, yanked me around so that I was now on all four. He forced me closer to the bedpost and tied my hands up again. “Draco what are you-“ But before I could finish the sentence, Draco practically tore my pans off and I could hear the sound of fabric being ripped. I flinched at the feeling of something stiff and uncomfortably cold against my hole. “Draco- What is that?” I asked nervously, but Draco didn’t seem to be in the mood for talking right now. Instead he just shoved whatever it was right into my ass without a warning. I let out a small scream and tried to pull away from him, but he wouldn’t let me. “No. You are mine Potter. Mine to fuck, mine to love and mine to punish for acting like a little brat. Is that clear?” I yelped in pain and slowly nodded my head. I knew that if I opened my mouth to answer I would just start crying and ruin everything. I could hear Draco rustling around behind me to position himself better. Draco started moving whatever he had shoved into my ass and at first it was extremely painful, but it slowly started to feel good. I tried my best to stop my hips from pushing back towards Draco. Something was different about Draco, but I couldn’t put my finger on what it was. I had never seen him act like that before, but it was kind of hot, so I decided not to do anything about it. Draco must have gotten bored at some point, he pulled out whatever he had used on me and I heard the sound of pants unzipping. My entire body shivered with anticipation and I knew what was about to happen. I mentally braced myself for the pain I knew would occur when Draco would ram into me. Draco slowly and teasingly nudged his cock against my hole, and I let out a shaky breath. The teasing felt endless and I grew more and more impatient the longer Draco teased me. “Draco please- I-I’ll be a good boy I swear- I’m sorry for acting like a brat- Just- Just give it to me already!” I whimpered and rolled my hips against him, but Draco was persistent. Each time I rolled my hips against him he just moved out of the way. “I don’t believe you. You’ll have to more than just apologize.” Draco said and started teasing me again. “I’ll do anything- Just tell me what you want-“ Draco stopped nudging his cock against me to think. After about a minute he spoke again. “Anything you say? Alright. Blow me.” I tried to turn around to look at Draco, but the belt around my hands and the bedpost made it impossible. “Can you untie me then?” I asked, careful not to piss Draco off any more than he already seemed to be. He didn’t say anything but untied my hands but kept the belt around one of my wrists. As I turned around Draco grabbed me by the hair and practically forced me down to his cock. He was controlling the pace and how deep I went. I only had to make sure to watch out not to grace his cock with my teeth. It was clear that Draco was enjoying it, he was groaning quietly the entire time and I didn’t really have any other choice but to keep giving him the blowjob. I knew fighting was pointless, but I decided that I still wanted to tease him a bit. I blocked off his cock with my tongue to stop it from reaching all the way down inside of my throat. I could see the frustration grow in Draco’s face as he tried to force me further down. I sent him a cocky smile and deepthroated him a couple of times on my own, which made Draco let go of my hair. The second he let go I quickly removed my head and grinned up at Draco. “There, I blew you. What’s next?” I asked with the hint of a smirk curving on my lips. Draco glared at me with a look I had never seen before. It was lustful, hungry and angry at the same time. I barely even had time to react before Draco turned me around and forced my face into the bed. He had twisted both my arms behind my back, tied my hands together again and was holding on to the belt, lightly pulling on it. “Oh, I’ll show you what’s next.” Draco said behind me, ramming himself inside of me as he yanked the belt making me jolt backwards. I screamed in pleasurable pain and felt my entire body shutter. Draco yanked the belt again, this time with enough force to pull me upright. “Do you know why I’m being rough on you?” Draco asked, breathing against my neck. I nodded and felt my body shutter again at the feeling of Draco’s breath against my neck. “I-I was behaving like a brat- And this is my punishment- Ah!” I moaned as Draco thrusted into me. “That’s right. You’ve been a very bad boy.” I felt Draco’s breath on my neck again and next thing I Know is the feeling of teeth sinking softly into my neck. Draco had bitten me like I was his prey and growled deeply against my neck. “You’re mine Harry. Is that clear?” I nodded my head and bit my lip. Something inside Draco had changed, but I wasn’t sure what. Sure, he had taken the lead before, but never like this. He was being dominant on a whole other level than I had ever seen him before. It was almost scary, but also extremely hot at the same time. Draco was being a lot rougher than he usually was, but I didn’t mind. I had behaved badly, and this was my punishment. I moaned loudly when Draco thrusted deeply into me again. He was hitting my sweet spot right on, which sent shivers through my body. I was a moaning, panting and trembling mess. Draco seemed to be enjoying himself quite nicely behind me. He was breathing heavily against my neck as he kept thrusting into me. Draco bit into my neck again and this time I could feel his teeth piercing my skin. I whimpered in pain as I felt something warm and sticky run shoulder. Draco had bit my neck so hard it had started bleeding. At this point I didn’t care, I just wanted Draco to punish me. Draco seemed to notice as well, because he sped up his thrusts and yanked the belt, making me jolt backwards into his bite. A loud moan tore its way out of my throat, and I could feel my cheeks burn. Deep down I knew that my fellow Gryffindor students could hear everything, but I was too aroused to care at this point. The blood kept slowly streaming down my shoulder as Draco continued to thrust into, still hitting my sweet spot with each thrust he made. At this point there was nothing Draco couldn’t do to me that I wouldn’t find pleasurable. My entire body was shivering in pleasure and pain in a beautiful combination. Draco was growling and groaning behind me and I could tell that he was enjoying this as well. “Draco- I’m going to come- I-I can’t hold it in any longer-“ I moaned, but Draco growled at me in response. “No. You will come when I say you can and not a second before. Is that clear?” He snarled against my shoulder and suddenly, I felt the need to just obey him. I nodded and whimpered silently. Draco was thrusting as hard as fast as he possibly could and with a loud growl he came inside of me. I moaned loudly at the feeling of Draco filling me up and whimpered silently. It was getting quite uncomfortable. My cock was throbbing and aching. I wanted to come badly, but Draco had told me that I couldn’t until he said I could. Draco was panting and breathing heavily against my shoulder while shivering slightly with the after pleasure. After a few minutes he pulled away from my shoulder and I could feel his warm breath against my ear as he whispered. “You’ve been a good boy. You can come now, love.” As soon as Draco had finished his sentence my entire body shivered and a loud moan tore its way out of my throat as I came. My body gave in and I collapsed onto the bed panting and breathing heavily. As I was laying on the bed, face against the soft and cold mattress tears slowly started rolling down my cheeks. I was shaking heavily and clenched my fists around the sheets to hold back my tears. Even though it had felt amazing I was still scared of Draco. I had never seen him act like that before. I pulled myself away from him and curled up on the bed. Draco noticed instantly and was over me like a hawk. He tried to gently stroke my back, but that only made me move further away from him. “Don’t touch me-“ I whimpered and hid my face in the mattress. “I- I’m so sorry- I didn’t mean to hurt you- I don’t know what came over me-“ Draco trailed off when he noticed my tears. He was shocked to see that I was crying. “Harry I’m so sorry- I would
!” I growled and clenched my free fist so hard that my knuckles turned white and my fingernails dug their way in to the palm of my hand. “Draco, you’re hurting me-“ Harry said silently and I Quickly let go of his chin. “Sorry- I didn’t mean to.” I mumbled and stepped back. Harry rubbed his chin and shook his head. “I know, I’m not mad at you.” I sent him a quick smile before remembering what I had been angry about. “I’m going to make that weasel pay for what he did to you-“ I turned around and started heading towards the hospital wing. “No!” I heard Harry raise his voice behind me. “This is between me and Ron. Do
I spend the following week trying to avoid Draco at all costs. I didn’t want to have to face him. I was still mad at him for the way he had treated me. The bruises and bitemarks started to fade away after a few days, but my body still felt incredibly sore.
“Of course not! Pansy, I lo-“ I hesitated at first, which made Pansy raise her brows at me. “I love him, Pansy. I would
Signed DM. That’s what the note read. I looked up from the note and met Ron’s and Hermione’s curious looks. I shrugged and told them what the note said and crumbled it up and put it in my pocket. “Well? Who do you think it’s from?” Ron asked and looked over at Hermione who seemed just as excited that I had a secret admirer. I shrugged again and pushed my glasses back to their right place on my nose. “I don’t know, it could be anyone?” I lied. I knew exactly who the note was from. I recognized Draco’s handwriting as soon as I looked at it. This wasn’t the first time I had seen it, last semester he tried to taunt me before a big quidditch match by drawing me a picture of me getting smashed by the smasher. He even decided to animate it. I watched as Hermione’s expression changed from excitement to suspicion. “Are you going to meet up with them Harry?” she asked and looked at me with slightly narrowed eyes as if she was examining me to see if I was telling the truth. “I’m not sure. It could just be someone trying to pull a prank on me.” I answered and sent her a small smile to assure her that I wouldn’t do anything stupid and or reckless the day before the first trial began. I don’t think she bought it completely, but she left it at that. We spend the rest of the afternoon talking about everything and nothing, just like nothing had happened.
Draco was lazily playing with my messy hair, and I couldn’t help but smile softly at the feeling. I usually hated it when people touched my hair, but it was different with Draco. Everything felt different with Draco, especially after I had chosen to fully submit to him out of my heat. I knew Draco was feeling it too. It felt like our bond was so much stronger now. We could feel everything the other person felt.
you!” I watched Ron as he shrunk together. It almost seemed like Ron feared me. I could feel my blood boil as I continued to yell at him. Hermione tried to calm me down by saying that was okay since hadn’t actually hit her, but I didn’t care. Ron kept trying to apologize, but I was already too fed up with him at this point. “You tried to fucking
Draco looked like he could burst into more tears any second. This whole thing had taken harder on him than I had expected it to. “Look, I know you’re probably still angry with me and you have every right to be. I was being inconsiderate and rude. Of course, I don’t want you to just be my fuck toy or pet that I can play house with whenever I feel like it. And I’m sorry if that’s the impression I gave off, because that’s not what I want. I want to love and cherish you. I want to protect you. You are my Omega, and I am your Alpha. We will figure this out together-“ Before Draco could finish his sentence I cut him off. “Shut up and kiss me.” Draco stared confused at me. “I thought you wanted me to apologize. I don’t understand-“ I cut him off again. “I said, shut up and kiss me. So, shut up and kiss me you idiot.” I said as I stepped closer to Draco, grabbing his tie to pull him down towards me. Draco still stared confused at me. “What?” I couldn’t help but roll my eyes at Draco, now he was just being stupid. I pressed my lips impatiently against his and that’s when he finally realized that I was being serious. As soon as our lips touched again it felt like fireworks in my stomach. I didn’t know how much I had missed this feeling until I finally felt it again. I let go of Draco’s tie and wrapped both of my arms around Draco’s neck to pull myself closer to him. I felt Draco’s arms around my waist, holding me close and gently pressing me closer to him. Draco kissed me hungrily, and I could tell that he had been longing for me. I would be lying, not only to myself but also to Draco, if I said I hadn’t been longing for Draco as well. I let my tongue slowly brush against Draco’s lower lip, asking for permission to enter his mouth which Draco more than willingly gave me. A small moan escaped my lips as our tongues collided and I could feel my cheeks heat up, which made Draco smirk slightly into the kiss. That was the Draco I knew and loved, the Draco that smirked at my countless attempts at keeping quiet but failed. I could feel Draco’s hands wandering down my back towards my ass, but I didn’t mind. Before I knew it, Draco had swept me off my feet and had picked me up. With a surprised yelp I instinctively wrapped my legs around Draco’s hips so I wouldn’t fall anywhere.
Hours passed by and I hadn’t gotten any closer to figuring out how to make it up to Harry. I let out another frustrated groan into my pillow and decided that it was probably best if I just went to sleep. I got up from the bed and walked over to my wardrobe to find my sleepwear. ‘Maybe I’ll figure something out while I sleep-‘ I thought to myself and quickly changed into my sleepwear before crawling back into bed. I pulled the cover over me and let my head sink into the pillow as I tried to get comfortable. Nothing seemed to work, and I ended up staring at the ceiling for an awfully long time before finally drifting off to a restless slumber.
Draco was panting heavily against my neck as he gently laid down on top of me on the bed. I let go of Draco’s hips with my legs and let them fall onto the bed on each side of Draco. He still had his teeth sunk into my neck, but I didn’t mind. Even though I wasn’t in heat, the feeling of Draco’s teeth in my neck felt nice somehow. I found myself wondering if it was just the Omega inside of me talking or if I actually liked it. After a few minutes of just laying on the bed, catching our breaths again, Draco let go of my neck. I winced slightly when Draco pulled his teeth out of my neck, but the pain quickly went away. Draco used a healing spell on my neck to help ease the slight pain.
My mother practically threw herself at me and hugged me tightly once she saw me. “My darling Draco, oh Merlin how I’ve missed you!” she squeaked as I struggled to get out of her embrace. I glanced over at my father and he seemed to be just as unimpressed as he always was. “Draco my boy, it’s good to have you back.” He said in a stiff monotone voice that sent shivers down my spine. I knew that I would eventually have to tell them everything and I was dreading my father’s reaction the most. He had never really been fond of Harry, especially not after he tricked my father into accidentally freeing our house elf Dobby. I looked up at him and nodded. “It’s good to be back.”
Ron ends up not taking it very well and lashes out at Harry verbally. This may be triggering or offensive to some people
Draco came back to the bed with the widest smirk I had ever seen on his face. He crawled onto bed down from the foot end and stopped with one knee between my legs, gently pressing it against my crotch. I felt myself starting to harden and tried to muffle a soft moan. I wasn’t sure how it was possible, but the smirk on Draco’s lips grew bigger and he bent over me. He started placing tender kisses and soft bites on my neck. He firmly grabbed my chin and tilted my head to face the opposite direction. “I’m so fucking turned on Potter. I’m going to make you scream, do you understand? I want you to scream my name.” He breathed into my neck. His voice sent shivers down my spine and I nodded. Draco then pulled away from my neck and added a bit more pressure with his knee. I moaned softly and squirmed slightly. Draco looked me up and down before practically ripping my boxers off. I groaned slightly as the hem of my boxers brushed against my hardened cock. Draco was getting hard too, I tried reaching down to touch him but then I remembered that my hands were tied up. I whimpered slightly which Draco found highly amusing. “You’re being punished remember?” he said and slowly started kissing his way down my stomach, all the way down to my cock. I instinctively arched my hips upwards, trying to get closer to Draco’s soft lips against my skin. Draco grinned at me and gave my cock a slow lick all the way from base to top. I moaned loudly and felt my cock throb slightly. He firmly grabbed hold of my cock and started stroking it. I let my head fall back onto the pillow and gave in to the pleasure. And oh Merlin, waves of please rolled over me. Next thing I know is the felling of a finger slowly being pushed inside of me. “Ah- D-Draco-“ I moaned and rolled my hips against his finger. Draco smirked up at me and started moving his finger faster and deeper. Draco was being a lot rougher this time, but it felt good. I don’t know if it was because my hands were tied up or if it was the thought of being punished, but it felt like I was burning up with desire. “Fuck me Draco- I want you to fuck me like there is no tomorrow-“ I begged but Draco just shook his head and smirked at me again. “Not yet, the punishment isn’t over.” He said and teasingly slowed his finger down pulling almost all the way out before slowly pushing it back in. I moaned loudly and curled my toes. I had completely forgotten that the other Slytherin students in the common room could hear me. Draco grabbed hold of my hard cock with his free hand and started stroking it counterpart to his finger’s movement. I was a desperate moaning mess at this point and all I could think about was how badly I wanted to feel Draco inside of me. “Oh Merlin- Please Draco- I can’t take it anymore- Would you please just fuck me already?!” I desperately cried out and heard Draco make a strange noise. It sounded like a mix between a laugh and a moan. Draco pulled his finger out and let go of my cock before lifting my legs onto his shoulders and bent over me. “I like it when you beg Potter. Keep it up and I might just give you what you want.” he whispered into my ear and it sent shivers down my spine. “Please Draco- I want you to fuck me. I want to feel you inside of me. I want- Ah!” Draco teasingly nudged his cock against my hole. “Is this what you want Potter?” He teased. “Yes! I want you cock Draco- Please fuck me-“ I heard Draco groan before he harshly thrust himself inside of me. A brief wave of pain shot through me before the pleasure took over and I moaned loudly. “Ah! Y-yes. Right there-“ Draco and I were both panting heavily and Draco kept thrusting into me in deep and controlled movements. My whole body was trembling with pleasure each time Draco hit my sweet spot. I tried lifting my head up for a kiss, but the position Draco had my laying in made it extremely difficult. Draco made an extra hard thrust and I threw my head back into the pillow screaming Draco’s name in the wave of please it sent through me. Draco made a low growling sound. “Fuck- I’m going to come Potter-“ Draco panted. I could feel my own climax closing in as well. “M-me too-“ Draco groaned and made sure to hit my sweet spot with his last few thrusts before he came. “Ah- Fuck-“ He panted out and kept thrusting into me, still hitting my sweet spot with each thrust, until I came as well. “Fuck- Draco I’m coming!” I cried out and my whole body trembled as I came.
Once again Draco had possessively placed an arm around me. I don’t know why, but I felt proud of being held like that by Draco. He was mine and I was his. Suddenly it didn’t seem too overwhelming to face Ron at breakfast. I hated the idea of having to part ways with Draco, but I had to. Before I went to sit down at the Gryffindor table Draco leaned closer to my ear and whispered. “I’ll see you later Potter. Try not to miss me too much.” And sent me off by slapping my ass. I looked back over my shoulder and Draco sent me a wide grin before finding himself a seat at the Slytherin table.
the enemy Ron!” I yelled back and clenched my fists to dull the need to punch Ron in his stupid face. “Oh, so now you’re on first name terms with him? That’s just great! Brilliant! I suppose that means you expect us to fall to our knees and worship him whenever he walks by?!” Ron snarled back. Hermione stepped in between us and looked back and forth between us. “Stop it you two- This is ridiculous, you are best friends for Merlin’s sake!” She said. Ron snorted and folded his arms across his chest. “Ha, I’d rather suffer under the Cruciatus curse than be friends with this
I had promised myself that I would never allow myself to become the helpless mess I had been during my heat but thinking back, made me realize that maybe it hadn’t been as bad as I had thought it out to be in the first place, maybe I had even been exaggerating a bit. That being said, I was still pissed at Draco for the way he had been acting the days leading up to it all, but I was slowly starting to understand that he never meant to hurt me. His hormones were going crazy because of his upcoming rut, and so were mine because of my upcoming heat.
Draco picked me up and held me tight as he carried me into the Slytherin common room. I was too busy trying to stop the tears and snot from ruining Draco’s shirt to notice where he was staking me. It only occurred to me where we were when I felt the silky sheets under me. Draco had sat down next to me on the bed. He wasn’t touching me or looking at, he just sat there. I guess he was waiting for me to say something. “Draco- I-“ I started but didn’t know how to tell him. I wanted to tell him what had happened last night after I got back, but I just couldn’t get the words out. Draco turned his head to look at me, eyes full of worry. “Shh, it’s okay if you don’t want to talk about it.” He said and softly placed his index finger on my mouth to shush me. “I think I know what happened, I just need you to nod or shake your head, can you do that for me?” Draco asked softly and I nodded. Draco sent me a soft smile. “Did your friends get angry with you for making them worry?” I nodded. “And you had a fight?” I nodded again. The look on Draco’s face slowly changed as he asked the last question. “Let me guess, Ron freaked out and called you all sorts of things?” I nodded and sobbed silently. “Please don’t hurt him Draco- I’m sure he didn’t mean any of it-“ I trailed off and remembered the look on Ron’s face when he had called me a traitor. I was too upset to question why Draco suspected that it had been Ron. “Please make me forget. I don’t want to feel like this- Make the pain go away?” I begged and Draco looked at me with the gentlest eyes I had ever seen before he started kissing me and eventually made love to me. It was passionate, but gentle this time and by the time we were done, I had completely forgotten why I had been upset earlier
” I shouted back startling Draco and made him take a few steps back. “Why do you always push me way? Why do you keep avoiding the subject whenever I bring it up?! Have you ever stopped to consider that
shush me! I will not keep my voice down just because it makes you uncomfortable-” I trailed off as I noticed that Draco’s face had changed from confused and surprised to sad and hurt. I couldn’t look at him anymore, I needed to get out of there. I turned away and went straight for the door. “I can’t do this anymore Draco- I’m done.” And with those words I left the room with Draco standing there just staring after me. As soon as I was out of there, I started running back towards the Gryffindor common room. “Harry! Wait!” I heard Draco shouting after me as I ran down the hallways, but I didn’t care, and I didn’t stop to let him explain.
“Are you done?” I asked rhetorically and looked over at Harry who had been yelling at me for the past thirty minutes. Harry opened his mouth to say something but shut it again and just nodded his head when he couldn’t come up with anything else to say. I smirked and slowly moved closer to him. “Good. Because I do not appreciate that attitude of yours. I think I’ll have to punish you again.” I watched Harry’s facial expression change from angry to intrigued in a split second. I raised an eyebrow at him. “Not so fast Potter. I never said how I would punish you, did I?” I pinned him against the door frame and leaned in to whisper into his ear. “I’m going to make you work for it this time.” I could feel Harry shutter at my breath against his ear and I smirked. “No matter how many times you beg for me to touch you, kiss you, even fuck you I won’t give it to you.” I added and gently pulled away again. I met Harry’s eyes and he seemed distraught. “What does that even mean?” He whimpered and looked at me in confusion. “You’ll see soon enough. Have some patience Potter.” I said with a smirk and turned around before leaving. It wasn’t easy to ignore Harry’s desperate calls for me to come back, but I managed to compose myself long enough to get down to the dungeons and away from Harry when all I wanted to do was go back and fuck him against the door frame.
Over the next couple of days Harry kept sending me notes asking me to meet him various places. I kept politely turning him down. I wanted him to work for it this time, and he certainly did. After about a week I decided to give in and agreed to meet with him. I could tell from Harry’s notes that he was getting very desperate to see me, so I suggested that we skipped class and met up in the dungeons. Harry rejected the dungeon part and told me to meet me in front of the entrance to the Gryffindor common room. I was suspicious at first but agreed. Something seemed to be different about Harry.
After dinner we all sat back in the common room and continued talking until it was time to head to bed. We said goodnight and headed to our dorms. Ron kept nagging me about the note and it was honesty starting to make me angry. “Seriously Ron? Don’t you have anything better to do than nag me?” I snapped at him and realized immediately. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to snap at you..” I mumbled and changed into my pajamas before crawling into my bed. Ron just shrugged it off and apologized for nagging me and then we left at that. I could hear Ron’s breaths slow down and get heavy as he drifted off to sleep. I tossed and turned in my own bed, trying to decide whether to meet up with Draco at midnight or not. After tossing and turning for quite a while, I decided to meet up with Draco just to get this out of my system once and for all. I looked up at the clock on the wall in the dorm and the hands on the clock showed 11:45 pm, so I slowly and quietly crawled out of bed before getting dressed as quietly as I could, making sure not to wake anyone up as I left the dorm and the common room. I made my way downstairs and headed towards the courtyard. I could feel the butterflies flying around in my stomach. The closer to the tree I got, the wilder the butterflies got. I could just about see the giant clock from here and it showed 11:59 pm, which meant that Draco could be here any second now. I was so nervous, that I could feel my legs beneath me shaking. I took a deep breath and told myself that everything was okay and that I had nothing to be nervous about. And sure enough, just as the clock started to strike 12:00 am I saw a silhouette approaching the tree. His platinum blonde hair glistened in the moonlight and his eyes sparkled slightly in the dim light coming from the few lamps scattered around the courtyard. I noticed something different about him. His usual tough expression had changed into a softer and almost embarrassed look. It would almost seem as if he was flustered. I couldn’t help but smile a bit, this soft expression actually suited Draco. As soon as he got close enough for me to see his face properly my breath was taken away. His eyes glistened like stars and his lips were curved into a shy smile as he approached me. That was the first time Draco smiled at me and genuinely meant it. “So, you actually showed up? To be honest, I didn’t expect you to.” Draco said and moved closer ever so slowly. As Draco moved closer, I instinctively moved back towards the tree trunk to the point where I couldn’t move any further. My back was now pressed against the trunk. The shy smile on Draco’s lips had now changed to a more confident smirk. “What’s the matter Potter? Snake’s got your tongue?” he teased and leaned over placing one hand right next to me head on the tree trunk. I could feel my cheeks turning redder and redder as I was standing there with my back against the trunk. I opened my mouth to speak but the words just didn’t want to come out, so I quickly shut it again and just nodded awkwardly. “Ha, that’s cute. No annoying comeback? Well in that case let me do the ‘talking’ and you just listen like a good little boy, okay?” he said and leaned even closer before I could say or do anything. Once again, our faces were only inches apart. My eyes flickered slightly as I eagerly awaited what would happen next. I wasn’t fully prepared for what Draco had planned, because what happened next shocked me. He placed a knee between my legs and pressed his body against mine, pressing my body even further against the tree trunk and closed the few inches gab between our faces. He pressed his soft lips against mine and my eyes widened. Draco gently grabbed the collar of my pajamas shirt. My legs turned to jelly and at this point it was useless to fight it, Draco had me right where he wanted me. I closed my eyes and slowly brought a hand up to Draco’s hair and softly tangled my fingers in his hair. It was like nothing else in the world mattered in that moment, it was just the two of us under the moonlight. Draco’s tongue slowly brushed against my lower lip and gently parted my lips. It felt like fireworks exploded in my chest and I tried my best to muffle a small moan, but I’m not sure it was very successful at all.
I had no idea how long I had been gone or what time it was when I finally snuck back into the common room, but luckily Ron and Hermione had gone to bed. I sighed in relief and went to bed. I silently crawled into my bed and pulled the cover up above my head. I sincerely hoped that Draco had had a better night than me. I tossed and turned and couldn’t sleep. Ron’s words were running on repeat in my head and they hurt more and more each time.
Draco carefully carried me down the staircase and entered a small room at the foot of the stairs. Not even once on his way down the stairs did he pull away from the kiss. I had never noticed the room before, but I didn’t really care either. I had a rather good feeling about where this was going, and I wanted it badly. But at the same time, I also wanted Draco to understand that I had boundaries. Draco gently put me down on the bed that was conveniently placed in the room and I pulled away from the kiss. “Alright, I have a few things I would like to say before we go any further.” I said and looked up at Draco, who was already pouting. I tried my best to not roll my eyes at him and continued. ”I would like to be in control once in a while. My body is still sore from my heat. No more bitemarks, at least not until the ones I have now are healed. And last, but not least, you need to be gentler, I wasn’t able to sit down properly for two days.” I said the last one with a small smile. Draco didn’t look convinced that I still wanted him and this time I wasn’t able to stop myself from rolling my eyes at him. “Do you really need me to say the words out loud, Malfoy?” I teased with the hint of a small smirk curving on the corner of my mouth. Draco smirked slightly back and tilted his head slightly to the side while looking down at me. “That depends, which words?” He questioned and watched as my cheeks started heating up. “I can’t believe you’re making me say this-“ I mumbled and cleared my throat before continuing. “Please just fuck me already?”
I stayed in the shower for an awfully long time and when I finally got out the others had cleared out of the dorm. I grabbed one of the towels and wrapped it tightly around my waist before grabbing the other towel to dry off my hair. The shower hadn’t brought me closer to a solution to how I was going to make it up to Harry. I let out a deep sigh of frustration as I walked back to my bed and let myself fall onto the bed, landing on my back. I stared blankly up at the ceiling for a while before sitting back up. I had decided that I would give Harry some space and I would try my best to stay clear of him for at least a week. I promised myself that I wouldn’t try to talk to him, not even once, the following week. That turned out to be way easier than I thought it would be, Harry seemed to be having the same idea as me.
When I got back to the common room later that evening everyone was waiting for me to celebrate that I had completed the first trial without too many bruises and scratches. I couldn’t help but laugh when Fred and George picked me up and jumped up and down with me in their arms. We laughed and chatted for a few hours before people slowly started to retreat and go to bed. I stayed up after everybody else had gone to bed, trying to work out what to write in my note for Draco. I had to start over so many times that I started to question if I would ever get it right. I let out a deep and frustrated sigh, crumbled the last piece of paper up and threw them all into the fireplace to cover my tracks. I muffled a yawn and looked at the clock. “Guess I better go to bed.” I mumbled silently to myself and headed upstairs to the dorm. I quickly changed into my pajamas and crawled into my bed before pulling the covers over me. The moment I closed me eyes everything between Draco and I came back, but this time it hit differently. My body got all tingly and hot and all I could think about was how I wanted to feel Draco’s body pressed against mine again. I wanted to feel his hands gently caressing my body, I wanted to smell his cologne, I wanted to feel his lips pressing against mine. My mind wandered and soon I found myself thinking about what else could have happened between us. At some point I ended up imagining Draco pushing me onto a bed before he crawled on top of me. I quickly pushed those images out of my head and opened my eyes again. What the hell was wrong with me?
I had no idea how long it took me to finally fall asleep, but when I woke up the next day, I felt even worse than I did before I went to bed the night before. My body was hot, and I felt feverish, my heart was pounding in my chest and I could hear the blood rushing by in my ears. The musky scent from my cover seemed stronger and I had trouble thinking straight. It was a huge struggle to get dressed, but I managed. I still wasn’t hungry, so I decided to skip breakfast. McGonagall had told me to come straight to her if I noticed any changes with my body, but I decided to just wait it out. Only problem was that it didn’t seem to go away, it only got worse. I barely made it down to the Great Hall and getting to potions class seemed like an unbearable task right now. When I finally made it to the classroom the class had already begun. I hurried in and took a seat in the back, hoping no one would notice that I was late. I squirmed uncomfortably in my seat, the air was hot, and it felt sticky. No, it wasn’t the air, it was me. I was sticky and I was hard. I had gotten hard in class in front of my classmates. My face turned tomato red and I felt like all eyes were on me even though no one was looking at me. My heart was still pounding, and the feverish feeling became worse by the minute. When people finally got up to gather ingredients for today’s potion Hermione came down to me with a worried expression on her face. “Harry you don’t look so good. Are you okay?” She asked and gently placed a hand on my arm. The feeling of another person touching me made my entire body jolt and a small moan escaped my lips. My knees felt like jelly and I didn’t know whether I wanted to run away screaming or give in to the incredible feeling of getting touched. Hermione quickly removed her hand from my arm and stared at me as I whimpered softly at the loss of her touch. If I felt like everyone’s eyes were on me before, they were now. Many of them just looked surprised, but some of them looked hungry, like they were undressing me right here and now. Among the hungry I saw a familiar pair of grey eyes. I scrambled out of my chair and tried to exit the room, but I was stopped by a firm grip on my wrist. “Please- Leave me alone-“ I whimpered and tried to pull my wrist out of the grip, but I was too weak. I was pulled back and next thing I knew was a pair of strong arms around me. I could feel breathing against my neck and a hand moving towards my crotch which made me shiver. “You smell delicious. Can I have a taste?” A voice whispered into my ear. “That’s enough Mr. McMillan. I suggest you find your seat before I drag your ass to detention.” A familiar voice sounded across the room and the pair of strong arms around me disappeared. I didn’t dare to look up and suddenly I was being manhandled out of the classroom. “Please don’t hurt me-“ I whispered. “You stupid boy. What were you thinking?! You could’ve started a heat frenzy in there.” Snape’s voice sounded so far away, yet so close. I looked up and saw Snape dragging me up the stairs. I didn’t feel the same feeling when Snape touched me, Snape’s touch felt safe and warm. He dragged me to the hospital wing and demanded to speak to Madam Pomfrey at once. “I need your quarantine cell Madam Pomfrey. This boy is in heat.” Their conversation went straight over my head after that and before I knew it, I had been placed in a magically sealed cell. I sat quietly on the bed, not knowing what to do. When I was finally alone, I pulled off my pants. They were sticky with a weird substance I had never seen before. The sweet smell hit me instantly. It was almost sickeningly sweet. I couldn’t take it anymore. I pulled my boxers off as well and they were even more sticky than my pants. I could feel the sticky fluid run down my thighs and my cock made a hard throb. I moaned softly and started touching myself. But even that wasn’t enough to easy the burning. I needed something more. I needed to be filled. Just the thought was enough to make my cock throb again and I let out a whimper. Where was Draco when I needed him? No, he was the last person I wanted to see me like this. I collapsed on the bed and enjoyed the feeling of the cold sheets against my burning skin. “Harry my boy. Can you hear me?” A familiar voice sounded, and I jolted up from the bed, looking around to locate where the voice had come from. I noticed some sort of window in one of the walls and on the other side stood none other than Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall. I hid my face in my hands and quickly crossed my legs. I nodded my head weakly. How long had they been standing there? “It’s alright Harry, you have nothing to be ashamed of. This is natural.” Dumbledore said calmly and I could see a small smile on his lips. McGonagall was standing behind him still as a statue. “Harry, I know this a touchy subject, especially at your age, but in order to help you I need to know your sexual preference. Do you understand?” I weakly nodded my head again before answering. “Men- I prefer men.“ I muttered quietly. I saw Dumbledore nod to McGonagall, and she disappeared. It didn’t take long for her to return and with her she had none other than Draco. My heart sank in my chest and I looked away, too ashamed of myself to even look at any of them. The door to the cell opened and Draco was shoved inside.
As I entered the courtyard, I saw Draco leaning against the tree waiting for me to approach him. ‘How did he know I would come here? Has he just been standing there this whole time waiting for me?’ I thought to myself and prayed that Draco wouldn’t notice me if I just turned around and walked away. I turned on my heels and walked away as fast as I possibly could, but Draco had spotted me. “Harry Please! I need to talk to you!” He called after me and I could hear footsteps following me. I started running to get away from him as fast as I could. Tears were forming in my eyes and I just wanted to be left alone, but Draco was persistent. He was taller and faster than me, so he quickly caught up with me. “Would you please stop running and just listen to me?” He asked in between small pants. I knew I would have to at least give him a chance to explain and stopped running, I tried to stop the tears, but I couldn’t. At this point I think there were tears of confusion more than anything else. I folded my arms across my chest and looked coldly at Draco. “Alright, if you want to talk, then talk. And you better have a good apology planned if you want to keep me as whatever we were-“ I continued to look at Draco and watched as his expression turned even sadder. “Harry I really am sorry- I don’t know what came over me, I’ve never experienced anything like that before-“ Draco hesitated before continuing. “I can’t hide this from you anymore- I’m an Alpha Harry. I think the reason I reacted the way I did is because I’m about to go into Rut for the first time- Which means there is an Omega nearby who’s about to go into heat- Crap, this is bad-“ Draco trailed off when he noticed that I stared at him in a combination of disbelief and confusion. I had never in my life heard of this before now, I suppose it made sense considering that I was raised in the Muggle world. I rubbed my forehead and tried to comprehend what Draco had just told me. Draco opened his mouth to say something but quickly shut it again. He was interrupted by a soft breeze coming from behind me. I could see him inhaling and saw his eyes flash like they had done earlier. I instinctively took a step back to create a bit more space between us, just in case he got any ideas. “It’s you. You’re the Omega about to go into heat, that’s why I’ve been unable to think straight around you lately.” Draco stepped closer, completely ignoring the safe distance I had tried to create between us. He grabbed my wrist and pulled me closer to him, despite my countless attempts at fighting it. “Let go of me! Don’t touch me!” I yelled but Draco didn’t care. Instead of letting go of me, he bent down and buried his face in my neck. I froze and started to panic, I was trapped inside Draco’s arms and there was nothing I could do that would make him let go, I just wasn’t strong enough to break free. I tried to pull my wrist out of Draco’s grip, but that just made him hold on even tighter. “I said let go of me! Don’t touch- Ah-“ I was interrupted by the feeling of Draco’s tongue slowly running from the end of my collarbone and all the way up to my earlobe. My face turned red and my body shivered slightly. It had felt good. ‘No, what am I thinking?! Snap out of Harry!’ I gathered all my strength and pushed myself out of Draco’s arms and made a run for it. My body was shaking, and my mind was racing. I didn’t know where I was going, I just had to get away from Draco before he could force himself on me. My first thought was to run back to the common room, but Draco knew the password and that would probably be the first place he would look for me.
