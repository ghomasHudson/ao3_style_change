It was a ridiculous cliche in romance novels that measuring an inseam was in any way sexual. It was simply a measurement of someone’s leg — hardly an erotic body part. And if simply being in the proximity of someone’s genitals counted as an intimate moment, then Draco had shared more intimacy in the Quidditch changing rooms than he wanted to reflect on. There was
He glowered, wishing the weather would match his mood.
“Good for her,” Ron and Harry said in unison.
Outside, through the wide-open doors, the trees creaked as the wind picked up. Draco could feel a storm brewing, promising a break from the humid heat. Harry followed his gaze, frowning at the cloud-covered sky.
“Probably napping,” Harry said with a shrug. “I think old house-elves are a bit like cats, I keep finding him asleep in the airing cupboard.”
What were they talking about? He didn’t have a clue. He couldn’t look away from Malfoy.
,” Potter raged.
Harry laughed. “Yeah, just a bit. I don’t come in here very often. I mean, it’s a big house and there are plenty of nicer rooms.”
Had Malfoy always dressed so
waver.
The feeling wasn’t unfamiliar. For the last three months, random urges to see Draco had hit him periodically: to turn up at his shop, at his house. Sometimes he’d wanted to see Draco and then Draco had suddenly been right in front of him, like at the weird Muggle bar with Neville and Luna.
“Must have been a big problem to upstage the birth of your best friend’s first child,” Belinda said, and Harry laughed awkwardly.
Maybe he should take a holiday. Find a remote cabin in the Scottish Highlands, far enough away from civilization that he could fly every day and go for walks without bumping into anyone who expected anything from him… The words in his head sounded lovely but as he tried to picture it, the intoxicating allure of being
“I’m fine, Potter. Can you get to the point?”
The queue moved forward and they shuffled along with it.
As he rounded the edge of the tables, Harry broke off from his group and wandered over to meet him.
He sent an owl to Neville asking if he had any free time, suggesting they could meet up for some drinks in London, and received an invitation to go for a walk around some botanical gardens in Cornwall instead. He, Neville, and Hannah Abbott spent the morning meandering their way through the mixture of Muggle and wizarding plants, and Neville and Hannah made a game out of who could point out the most poisonous plants in each bed — with Harry being the judge of which was a worse death.
“Look on the bright side, you got to show off your fancy new spell, which had the bonus of making me feel bad.”
“Let’s go, or I’m going to end up eating the bedsheets.”
He raised an eyebrow. “It didn’t feel like I was being a bother to you during the fitting,” he challenged.

how Potter was always
A nearby upturned crate made for a good enough seat and, though it creaked, it held under his weight. He shrugged out of his jacket and examined the rip with pursed lips. Luckily, it would be easy enough to fix with
of dress robes?”
Draco watched the self-stitching needle sew up a seam on Potter’s dress robes as his mind wandered. It was Friday: nearly a full week since Harry had come to the manor in the middle of the night and Draco hadn’t been able to get the incident out of his mind. Everywhere he went, he looked over his shoulder to see if Potter was nearby, but he’d been notably absent after cropping up everywhere Draco didn’t expect. It was driving him mad. He desperately wanted to tell
“Thanks for the tea,” Ginny said.
“You’re up to something and I need to know what.”
Potter,
“No, you’re not. You’re—” She waved her hands wildly up and down his body. “You’re
Still, even with all the security measures and an assurance from a Muggle Protection Office that the shop complied with regulations, Maggie still insisted on never having both doors to the sewing room open. It sat in the middle of the shop and without all the wards, it would be technically possible for a Muggle standing in the dry-cleaners to look through the sewing room to the wizarding half of the shop.
“The Little House,” he said clearly, spinning on his heel.
he’s answering our questions, so clearly whoever this is isn’t completely humiliating, just scandalous…”
“Better, he commissioned some.”
Too late, he flipped his hand over, pulling his arm close to his side to mask the black serpentine lines marring his sallow skin. The woman stepped out of the queue toward the Aurors, pulling her child behind her robes.
“Uh.” Potter’s eyes flicked across the three different examples. Uncertainly, he pointed to the one on the end: black with velvet accents and lots of ruffles.
Harry’s jaw dropped, and he glanced towards the kitchen anxiously as he snapped it shut.
“Don’t act like you’re the victim in all this, I’m allowed to be angry.” Her steely tone cut through Harry’s anger, even though she wasn’t yelling. Yet.
She yawned again, just as the door to their room opened and a nurse poked her head in.
) unpack all that.
When exactly did life get so fucked, he wondered. At least when he was younger and saving the wizarding world, the choices made sense. He knew he was doing the right thing (most of the time, at least). But now, every decision was that impossible shade of grey and it came stapled to a mountain of paperwork that negated any of the
“I hate to say ‘I told you so’ but…”
He recounted his morning in great detail as Pansy ate her way down the baguette, making sympathetic noises at the appropriate moments. He couldn’t help but exaggerate some parts, but he kept the Potter reveal until the last moment.
“I could do the Taboo but not the summoning, and I’d rather
“Not just
Draco sniffed and slipped his wand back into his pocket. “I’m just cleaning it, not cursing it,” he said, and Harry wasn’t sure if it was a joke or not. He didn’t have a chance to find out because Malfoy was striding back into the Muggle shop.
have been that easy. She didn’t know what it was like, living under so many expectations with so many pairs of eyes on her. Not the same way that Harry knew.
“There’s a raid?” Harry asked dumbly.
“I put my entire hand in her vagina at one point, I don’t think it’s unreasonable that we’re on a first-name basis now.”
pick up a bit of knowledge.”
Hermione smiled at him, and Harry sighed and nodded at the vacated armchair. “Sit down,” he said, and Draco did as ordered. “Hold your arms out — no, not like that, you’d drop her. Like you’re holding a baby.”
Draco thought back to Madam Malkin, red-faced and sweating just from the effort of standing up, and how she seemed smaller every time Draco saw her, accompanied by a carer every hour of the day. The old woman was a realist and Draco had a feeling there was information she was downplaying for her granddaughter but it wasn’t the time to point that out to Maggie.
He rolled his eyes. “That we should report these attacks if they happen again.”
the paper, but the relief he sought didn’t come as the parchment went up in flames in his hand.
It took him another hour to fall asleep. He switched from his old records to the radio and listened to a dull interview with a woman who was opening an exhibition of enchanted sculptures in Warwick. He forced himself to listen to every word as the sculptor explained the influential witches who had inspired each of the statues, half of whom he’d never heard of and didn’t care to learn about but they helped to keep his mind off Potter for long enough to drift into an uneasy sleep.
“I have a job interview, and I really need this job,” she was saying, her eyes wet as she held out a cream coat to Draco that had an ugly smear of a sludgy brown-grey right across the middle. “I slipped over on the pavement — I think someone must have been changing their oil and I didn’t even notice until I landed on my arse and now it’s got this big stain on it… I tried scrubbing it under the sink but it just won’t come out and the interview’s in thirty minutes. I don’t have any other options, can you do anything?”
He wanted to run down the high street to Malkin’s Magical Tailoring, but he forced himself to slow and duck into a coffee shop where he bought a bag of crisps just so he could use the toilet. He splashed some cold water on his face and tried casting a Drying Charm on the sweat patches under his arms. There was little he could do about his hair except remove the elastic headband he’d shoved on to keep his hair out of his eyes that morning.
dedicating at least five column inches to what Potter’s hair looked like, he wished he didn’t have to
Harry shrugged. “There are good kinds of parties. With the right people.” An idea formed as he spoke and he raised his eyebrows at Draco speculatively. “Speaking of…”
Harry, Ron, and Hermione spent a long sunny Friday afternoon tackling the Horklumps in their garden as Rose napped in her pram in the shade. It was hard, physical work as the fleshy pink mushrooms clung to their ground with all their might, so each had to be stunned with a Knockback Jinx, then ripped from the ground and dumped into a bin bag before they came to their senses. Still, despite the putrid smell that clung to his hands afterwards, Harry finished the task with a deep sense of satisfaction and triple the number of bagged Horklumps than the others.
He sighed and dropped his quill back into the inkwell, scrunching up the parchment before it even dried. Black ink smeared across his palm. He
“Right, thanks. I’ll be right back,” he said to his friends, but no one paid him much attention. Pansy was still in deep discussion with Hermione about her daughter’s sleeping patterns, and Luna was explaining Rolf Scamander’s research into the Giant Squid to Blaise and Theo, who were telling her about the escapades they’d seen from the Slytherin Common Room. On his way back to the house, he spotted Greg stood with George and Ginny Weasley, who were watching him pour an assortment of spirits into a large jug with evident excitement.
Draco sniffed, ignoring the compliment, and began pulling the robes off the mannequin.

“Harry,” Ginny cut in sharply. “We’re good friends and all, but I don’t actually
“That’s probably against the Muggle Protection Act, you know,” he commented.
“Sorry,” she apologised, rubbing it across her face. “I keep stealing them from you.”
But instead of peppering him with questions like he expected, Maggie laid her head on his shoulder and said, “I’m glad you had someone with you.”
“Uh.”
“Neck, fifteen-point-eight,” he said, after a few calming breaths. His voice sounded normal enough but he still wandered over to the Quill to check the measurements it had recorded so far — though it had never been wrong before, it didn’t hurt to be careful, he reasoned.
“God, you look…” Harry said. He knelt back, admiring Draco just in the tight trousers and loose shirt. “I nearly lost my mind when you walked out,” he said.
“I won’t,” she said but he could feel her frown on his back as they walked to the dining room, where Ron was just putting down a cottage pie topped with a vibrantly (worryingly) orange mashed potato. He ignored her side eyes as he slid into the chair at the head of the table that he considered his seat.
“I’m your friend as well,” Maggie said. “This doesn’t seem healthy, that’s all.”
There was an owl waiting on the bannister at the stop of the porch stairs of Number 12. It glared at him with its piercing amber eyes and hooted indignantly at being made to wait outside.
“Not like that!” he added quickly. “Like urges to see you, I mean. The other night I was minding my business, going home, and next thing, I was at the Manor.”
The three Aurors frowned intently at his robes. Harry tugged on his shirt cuffs as everyone inspected him. He felt like he was back at school and McGonagall was about to dock a house point because his tie was too short.
There was another reason he was hesitant to step up onto that platform: the memory of Malfoy’s fingers on his throat flashed behind his eyes as it had every bloody day since he’d last been in Malkin’s Magical Tailoring. His pulse raced whenever he thought about it, and his muscles would tense like his body wanted to go into fight or flight except there was no threat, just Malfoy. It had been years since he’d considered Malfoy a genuine threat, but he didn’t know what else that tension might be.
His hands shook as he reached for his wand and
“Yes please. Is the carrot cake…” She pointed to the sweets cupboard and Harry nodded, even though she knew her way around the Grimmauld Place kitchen better than he did.
Potter cocked an eyebrow. “You’re thinking about me an awful lot,” he said, and Draco kicked viciously at his bare ankle.
He took a small step towards Draco and the moment ended.
restaurants to independent places. Draco honestly wasn’t quite sure what the difference between the two were except for the price of drinks.
He was just taking a large gulp of wine (it was the good stuff, clearly Pansy had raided her parents’ wine cellar) when Pansy called uncertainly, “Um, Draco? I don’t think it’s Theo.”
“How long…”
“Sure. Thanks, Greg,” he called back, slightly mollified.
Draco kept his mouth shut, glancing at Harry. He looked back at Draco with a small, fond smile.
“Grow up, Zabini,” Draco snapped, though he put little heat behind it.
“Should you be telling me patient names? Surely it’s confidential.”
He shook his head slightly, trying to rid himself of the bizarre thoughts. Malfoy was at work and there was nothing more to be read into it, no matter how intimate his touch felt.
. I can assure you, I see plenty of customers in their underwear, you’re nothing special.” But even as he said that, Harry thought he saw his eyes travel down and up Harry’s body. Harry gave up fighting for control of the curtain and covered his groin instead as Malfoy pointedly started handing him clothes. “Here, put those on first,” he said, giving him a pair of trousers.
A moment later, there was a knock at the door and someone calling, “Auror Potter?”
“Maybe you should be a gardener,” Ron suggested.
, reciprocated. The fabric of those trousers had been so thin, Draco could have counted the snitches on Potter’s pants: there was no way he could have missed that erection.
“You surely expected this?”
He walked over to the coffee. “Is this a fresh pot?”
“It’s kind of in the family,” he said to Harry, when he’d asked how Rolf had gotten into magizoology. “Obviously, my grandfather was Newt Scamander, so I grew up with all of this all around me. Lucky for me, I love it just as much as granddad so it was natural after Hogwarts to go into it.”
. This” — he pointed back and forth at the feet of empty air between them — “was all your idea.”
“Here, this would be good for you, it’s the sort of plant that’s happiest when it’s being neglected,” he said, pointing to an envelope of seeds with an illustration that looked suspiciously like plain tomatoes.
“Okay. Can I expect an update by Friday then?”
“Morning,” Harry grunted as he filled a glass with water and gulped it down, panting as he wiped away a few stray drops from the corner of his lips.
“You— you heavily implied it,” Draco stammered.
He straightened his robes, checking in the mirror by the door that he was presentable before marching out to the shop floor where Harry Potter stood. He had his hands in his pockets and rocking back and forth on his toes as he peered around the display robes in apparent interest. He’d come straight from work, judging by his Auror robes. Draco noted with a small flare of pride that they looked
“So, uh, speaking of Draco,” he coughed. “Is he here?”
at his back as he pushed by — no one challenged his queue jumping.
a love spell? Was it affecting both of them? He’d never heard of a love spell that impacted both parties at once — as far as he knew, they only targeted one person. And who would have bothered to put a love spell on Draco and Potter? It sounded more like the behaviour of a crazed Chosen One fan who wanted Potter and the Weaselette to get back together.
“You can’t!” Naismith spluttered and, foolishly, took a step toward Potter. He had his wand up before Draco could blink, his arm completely steady as he pointed it between Naismith’s eyes. He didn’t have to cast anything, just the threat of being at wandpoint caused Naismith to freeze and then give up, slumping against the wall, his empty hands balled into fists by his side.
Uncomfortable, he bounced his weight from side to side and asked, “So. How are you doing?”
Theo snorted. His cheeks had regained their colour and he appeared to be back to his usual form. “You were about to freeze.”
They discussed the state of Swedish national team, whether Ginny should get a cat or if it would get lonely in the apartment while she was at practice, and how the Horklump infestation in the Peak District had crept into Ron and Hermione’s garden. Ginny entertained them all with a story about a terrible date she’d been on, and Harry wanted to blurt “
Malfoy pinched the loose fabric at the seams of the waistcoat. He caught a bit of Harry’s skin, but with the waistcoat and shirt cushioning his grip, the pinch didn’t hurt. He still jerked away — just to prove a point.
“Ye-es,” he said, stretching the word into two syllables before trailing off. “I’m guessing they’re not ready?”
!” Pansy protested.
Draco leaned in, his thumb pinched painfully between his chest and the chair arm and he hissed, pulling back and shaking out his hand. Potter smiled self-consciously and ran a hand through his messy hair.
“It’s a shop front. The Leaky Cauldron’s on a Muggle street, are you going to raid that next?”
“What were you thinking of?” Harry asked, putting a hand on Draco’s dick. Draco saw his other hand move between his own legs and he stroked himself as he just held Draco.
, and
His stomach dropped, though he hadn’t moved. It took a moment for him to recognise the unpleasant feeling as
“No!”
Naked, he carefully hung his trousers and threw his shirt and underwear at the overflowing laundry hamper in the corner before picking his way through the mess to his bathroom. He ducked under the shower for a moment, the spray of cold water washing the drying sweat from his skin and cooling his core temperature down. It was the type of oppressive heat that refused to relinquish its hold; by the time he’d dried himself and walked over to his bed, he was sweating again.
He had a sinking feeling this was more than a
“…Suppose not. Is it a
The barista was apparently not as Muggle as Harry had first taken him to be. He gave Harry a curious up-and-down inspection and then gasped in recognition.
“Is that a bad thing?” Harry asked slowly.
. He sat back up and looked straight over at Draco blankly, then shook his head like a dog trying to clear water from its ears.
“Why do I get the impression that you don’t know what that means?” Draco snatched the invitation from Potter’s hands. So much for Seeker reflexes.
“Because they had to save face,” Blaise said. “If they’d found
to face your friends, Potter.”
Potter dug a piece of grime out from under his nail. “Pretty much what I said. I quit,” he said casually.
They’d left their wands in their pockets in the other room and watching Harry’s bare arse run from the room, hands cupping the front to provide the slightest modesty, gave Draco a moment of reprieve from the need that burned through his veins. However, as soon as he was back (dumping an armful of their clothes on the desk chair), their wands clutched in his hand, it returned stronger than ever.
The hippogriff had been an unexpected sign-off to his final shift before his rest days — turning what was meant to be a small bust of an illegal imported pixie ring into six hours of overtime as Harry had to fill out form after form about why their risk assessment hadn’t considered that the pixie dealers might have imprisoned a hippogriff in their broom cupboard. He needed to remember to write Hagrid a thank-you card for introducing thirteen-year-olds to incredibly dangerous animals; otherwise Harry would have come out of that encounter with a lot more than just shredded robes.
But really, what choice did he have? He always knew he would be Head Auror eventually.
The woman pulled the Auror uniform off the hanger and handed it to him. He shrugged on the robes and the woman came around the desk to adjust the buttons, pulling his arm up perpendicular and checking the sleeve length. Harry regarded himself in one of the many mirrors dotted around the shop floor.
was going to discuss the intricacies of childbirth with someone who was practically his sister.
, Draco thought, sitting back and crossing his arms. Someone pounded on the wizarding side-door, most likely signalling the arrival of yet another person who would get a lot of pleasure from Draco’s sexual proclivities.
“Well, yeah,” he admitted. “It doesn’t matter what kind of clothes you wear — it matters what kind of person you are.”
“With Harry Potter?” she asked.
“Is there any way you could do it by Thursday?”
Over her shoulder, Draco met Maggie’s damp eyes and started mouthing along to Madam Malkin’s well-worn speech. He heard it every time the woman dropped in. The corners of Maggie’s mouth trembled and she bit her lower lip in an attempt not to laugh as she turned back to her grandmother.
They frowned at each other.
Blaise was the first one to spot him. “
He ploughed on, fishing the ticket out of his wallet. “Because this turned green. I didn’t even think he was still working on my robes, to be honest, but if they’re done, then I didn’t want you to be out of pocket or anything.”
A bus drew to a stop next to him and a group of Muggle teenagers in uniforms disembarked, hiking up backpacks and screaming to each other. He retreated against the wall, trying not to get caught in the wave of schoolchildren, and saw Ginny further up the road, standing under an awning. There was a plastic bag on the ground between her feet and a book in her hand that she was lazily flicking through.
Draco wanted to run after Maggie, a desire born both from the need to check that his friend was okay and also wanting strongly to get out of the room, but he couldn’t leave Madam Malkin alone in the shop. The loathsome old woman would probably go hunting their accounts parchments to find yet more ammunition about why Maggie should give up.
“Okay, okay,” Potter sighed and Draco tried not to look outwardly triumphant.
Robards tapped the file in front of him.
“What do I do?” he asked helplessly. “He fucking
“Not the pretty blonde you work with?” Millie gasped.
He covered her hand with his and squeezed gently. “It’s okay. Your lack of brain cells is my favourite thing about you,” he said sincerely.
Narcissa would like Harry, Draco thought. She would have liked that he made Draco laugh, and that would have been enough for her.
Quidditch.
“I’m sure they don’t blame you,” he murmured. “It’s no one’s fault. She was a very old woman. A hundred and twelve years is nothing to be sniffed at.”
He trailed off, his chest heaving from the outburst. Just to have something to do, he reached for his tea and took a long slurp. Kingsley leant back, one hand cupped casually around the mug while he drummed his fingers on the tabletop. He exhaled — the sound caught between a sigh and a laugh and shook his head.
wheelbarrow and chucked Ron’s and Hermione’s on top. “Where am I taking them?” he asked.
“I quit,” Harry repeated, louder this time.
He slid onto the bench on the opposite side of the table. “What can I do for you, Minister?” he asked, cutting past the interminable small talk.
Well, when you put it like that, it was plain as day. Ginny ate her toast and watched him with more patience than he possibly deserved.
She finished the last of whiskey and wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. She glanced at the clock on the mantle, steadily ticking towards eleven.
“Oh.” Potter turned back to the robes but his gaze kept flickering back to Draco and he eventually shrugged. “I don’t really know, I don’t care about this kind of thing. Aren’t you a tailor? Can’t you” — he waved his hands helplessly in the air — “
“What? I never said that,” he protested. “You knew we were in the same year at Hogwarts.”
“Because it’s a formal affair?” Malfoy didn’t say ‘
“Well, they’re in the back,” Maggie said, then lowered her voice and said conspiratorially, “He told me if you ever came in that I should just bag them up and give them to you but he’s been in such a foul mood the last few weeks, I think it’d do him a bit of good to see you. He always used to be happier after you came to visit.”
“Well, from what I hear I’m not even going to have the most impressive job in the family for long. Is twenty-six the youngest Head Auror in history?”
That was the last piece of Ginny, taken out of his life so casually and suddenly. He tried to work out how he felt about it. Should he be sad? It was a definite, final nail in the coffin: the end of his first relationship, the first person he’d loved. But then the relationship had ended a long time ago and Harry didn’t love Ginny like that any more, so surely there was no need to be sad. He should be relieved. Maybe even happy?
At his desk, he grabbed a quill and a piece of blank Ministry parchment and scrawled a hasty resignation letter. There were more ink splatters than letters, but it was legible. He signed his name at the bottom and folded it, sending the memo flying to Robards office with a smug satisfaction. The last memo he’d ever have to see.
In reality, he’d heard about Maggie’s opening from Blaise’s mum’s friend who knew the Malkins and the next week, he’d packed his work into a suitcase like an artist’s portfolio and waited outside the door until Maggie let him in. He’d been so desperate for the job, he brought anything he thought might impress her: his fourth year robes he’d altered for fun that resulted in McGonagall docking ten house points; three identical fairisle jumpers he’d made when practicing his knitting charms under house arrest; cloaks he’d embroidered with shaking fingers in the dead of night when he couldn’t sleep, listening for any sound of Voldemort or Bellatrix in the hallways.
He turned away in disgust, ignoring the world and heading for his bedroom.
She looked at him with big, watery eyes and a trembling lip for a moment before bursting into tears again and flinging herself into his arms. It took him a moment to catch-up with what was happening and wrap her into a hug, trying to not look too panicked as her parents frowned at him.
Draco’s smile slid from his mouth, and he glared at Harry fiercely. “I just spent hundreds of hours sewing these stupid robes.
“It’s confidential,” he muttered.
Then again, what would he say to the Healer?
Ron sent him a look saying it was
“Uhh, sure,” Harry said, doing as he was told.
“Don’t you need to stay with your parents…” he asked as she pulled him away, glancing over his shoulder to see Mr and Mrs Malkin watching them with pursed lips.
to?” he asked, his voice plaintive.
While they’d been gone, everyone had gathered around the table. Parents with young children were relegated to the far end, where they were blowing on the first round of burgers and sausages. The other adults chatted amongst themselves as they served themselves potato salad and coleslaw. Mr. Weasley was still manning the barbecue that was now belching intermittent clouds of black smoke into the air; Mrs. Weasley hovering next to her husband nervously.
“Whatever.”
, until McGonagall nodded decisively.
“I have no ulterior motives,” he said loftily. “All I care about is your safety.”
“That’s sweet.”
Draco’s hand slid down and the moment of vulnerability came to an end.

Bill nodded slowly as Hermione succinctly explained their problem, stroking his beard absentmindedly. “How interesting. Harry — could you pop into the kitchen for a moment? I want to see it in action.”
for it to be over.”
The memory of Malfoy strutting out of the backroom in his stupidly fitted robes like he owned the place flashed before his eyes.
Maggie squealed. “Did you talk to him?”
won’t help your case.”
“Not much any more. It was worse after the war, before we started coming to Muggle bars.”
“It’s impossible to spend three years around you and Maggie and
, Draco thought, his lip curling. Bringing down the Dark Lord wasn’t enough for a lifetime, apparently — he just had to be responsible for stopping every dark wizard in Britain.
A tapping on the door broke him from his reprieve.
“A party full of Gryffindors?” Draco asked. His nose wrinkled.
The wizarding bell jingled happily and Draco rocked back on his chair to see who it was. Maggie lingered awkwardly on the threshold, one hand keeping the door ajar.
“I did and then I got stuck in the middle of some Auror raid — hence the baguette and the lateness.”
“Hey,” he said.
coming to that conclusion? Men! Hopeless.” The last bit was directed at Hermione, accompanied by an eye roll. She spotted Kreacher at the end of the table and said, “Oh, Kreacher, the third floor bath isn’t draining properly again.”
when he said it. Although he’d been burning with rage, he hadn’t spat those words like the others. When he’d said that, the anger had bled from his voice, replaced by a fatigued emptiness. Harry wasn’t sure if it was just the light reflecting from the street or whether there had actually been a sheen of wetness in his eyes.
“Yes,” Draco agreed shortly.
He summoned the twirling model from the wall and propped the plate up against his pencil case. Keeping his touch as light as possible, he sketched billowing robes that hung in their air, suspended in place as if they were weightless, floating in non-existent water. Beneath the light chiffon outer robes, he added a slim black robe that was more rigid and wouldn’t fly out in the wind.
He took a sip and winced as a tart, artificial sweetness flooded his mouth. “Urgh, no thanks,” he grimaced, passing it back.
Malfoy put down his tea. “The robes you dropped off,” — he looked at the clock on the wall behind him — “about twenty minutes ago?”
He squashed the thought back down, locking it away. He didn’t want to (
“And I won’t tell anyone.”
it,” he said with a laugh. “Didn’t even realise how much I hated it until I quit and suddenly there was just this weight lifted from my shoulders.”
“Remind me to give you the name of the company I used, Draco, they’re excellent; they could do wonders with the Manor when you… are ready for that.” He changed the words at the last moment but Draco heard, crystal clear, exactly what he’d meant to say:
It wasn’t until Ron and Hermione started yawning that he noticed the time and realised it was probably time to leave his friends be.
“I know but that doesn’t make it easy for me! You know people stare at
Draco ran his hand over his hair, checking that the gel was still keeping it in place, swooped back to the nape of his neck. It was longer than he liked it, but the thought of the cost of a haircut made his gut clench unpleasantly.
“Potter,” he greeted shortly.
Were they talking the same language? Draco could barely follow the convoluted logic Potter was spewing.
“Stop overthinking this. I’m very talented, remember? Witch Weekly dedicated two pages to my brilliance last year. I could build a business in Hogsmeade in a week,” Draco said, but then sneered. “I’m
He looked around the floor uncertainly, worried that Hermione’s giant ginger beast from Hogwarts was about to jump out from under a cushion and bite his ankles.
funeral memories,” she said, a bit of lightness seeping into her voice.
“Just the…” She struggled to find the words, her mouth opening and closing soundlessly a few times. “Your general aura lately.”
“I’ll take him to get his memory wiped.”
When Harry headed back to his office, he felt strangely deflated. That feeling hardened into something that burned like bile in the back of his throat when he saw a new memo printed on MLEP-headed paper that had slipped under his door while he’d been in the kitchen.
“The shop looks good,” he said. “I mean, last time I saw it was, uh.” He scratched his head awkwardly as he remembered Draco saying that he hadn’t told Maggie about Harry’s involvement in the raid. “I’m sorry about your grandma. She was a lovely woman. She sold me my first set of wizarding robes.”

She raised an eyebrow. “I’d have thought you of all people would know a raid when you see one,
of them,” he added quickly, probably in response to Harry opening his mouth, ready to tell Robards to
“They’re
“I tried that already…”
“Merlin, Harry!” Ginny eventually cried. “I’ve got try-outs tonight! I’ve only mentioned it a hundred times!”
“That was kind,” Harry said, ignoring the question.
“Yeah,” Harry agreed miserably, and his eyes darted back to Draco for a second.
“I just wanted to find out how the paperwork was going. Do you have any questions about any of it?” His tone was friendly but the crossed arms and frown suggested he had a very good idea of exactly how much non-case-related paperwork Harry had done so far.
“I was an awful boyfriend.”
Draco didn’t want to go back to the party with everyone else monopolising Harry’s attention — he selfishly wanted him to stay with Draco, just the two of them. But he couldn’t admit that aloud, and it

“You can’t be serious, Harry!”
“Would you like to hold her?”
so I told her, seeing as I’m paying for it and living there, that I was putting my foot down.”
Silence fell between them, broken only by the ticking of the clock on the wall and the occasional creaks and groans that made up the unrelenting orchestra of Grimmauld Place.
He had to swallow before he mustered the courage to say, “Hello, Professor.”
“I understand you’re frustrated, but you aren’t Head Auror yet, Potter. Watch your tone.”
“Then why are you rolling your eyes?”
“Right, yeah, thanks Hannah. I think that proves my point.”
The scene grew again and now Draco stood just behind Ron and George, a smug grin on his face and warmth spread from Harry’s cheeks to his toes.
“What are you doing?” Potter grunted. He was holding his wand — not pointing it at Draco, but the implication was still there.
The Healer was very interested in Harry and Draco’s predicament. He made them demonstrate it many times by sending Harry into a room across the hall and having Draco summon him time and time again while he made copious notes. By the time the Healer announced he’d seen enough, Harry felt nauseous and off-balance. He collapsed onto a bed and closed his eyes, taking slow, deep breaths as he tried not to vomit down his top.
“Really?” Harry replied, only half listening. There was a man a little further down the pavement before them with white blonde hair, pale skin, and good posture. He was leaning against the wall, looking out over the Thames so Harry couldn’t get a good look at his face.
“I won’t,” Harry said, affronted that Malfoy would think he

Harry didn’t ask why they were bothering to
“I don’t think you could

fashion.”
Eagerly, Harry dived back in, undoing Draco’s flies as he twisted out of the top. As he pulled off his trousers, Harry got to his feet to kick off with his boxers. Now, finally naked, he stared up at Harry, who was watching him with undisguised lust.
“The raid, of course.”
“Draco,” she said. “I’m worried about you.”
“Don’t be silly,” Maggie said. She held his hand as her parents sidled by to their chairs next to Maggie. They pointedly didn’t look at Draco, but her dad wrapped an arm around Maggie and gave her a quick kiss on the temple.
. He hadn’t cried in years.
“And we’ve changed a hell of a lot already,” Kingsley pointed out. “We’ll never get to the point where we can dust off our hands and say that we’ve finished reforming every bad law — but we can take things one at a time. You’ve made your point: Auror reform is now at the top of everyone’s priorities. But we need you back.”
” he moaned, come lubricating his hand as he continued to stroke himself through the last waves of his orgasm.
“Good, good,” Robards said and handed him the pile.
“It makes sense. He was cornered and was probably firing off any spell he could think of that might get him out of trouble. I doubt he knew what this spell would do, but if he was messing about with experimental dark magic, it wouldn’t be too hard to combine a Summoning Spell with a Taboo…” She hefted the books on one forearm and traced some patterns in the air with her empty hand. “The wand movements are quite similar. He might have even done it by accident.”
“Can’t believe you didn’t tell us immediately,” Belinda accused.
Draco tuned them out. The corridor seemed to stretch out in front of him for miles like in a nightmare, but he hadn’t even begun to compose himself before they were at the door and stepping out onto a patio.
. He brushed away a strand of hair that had flipped onto Harry’s forehead, murmuring, “You’re so good for me on your knees. Fuck, I’ve thought about this so many times… You’re so pretty, you look so good.”
times that I’m hopeless.”
don’t know either. That’s my point: I’m a good Auror, why change now? I’ve spent years working my way up, it’d be a waste to throw all that work away.”
Draco gritted his teeth and shrugged minutely, keeping his expression blank while internally he raged.
“This
“We’d hate to damage that,” Harry agreed, seriously, and Draco bit down on the inside of his lip so he didn’t smile.
“It’s routine,” he said bluntly. “Any collateral needs to get checked over — come on.”
Harry didn’t want to disrupt Rose, whose eyes were slowly falling shut as she fell asleep, so he didn’t turn around, just said, “The receptionist said I could stay.”
“Oh. Yeah. Sorry — here,” he pulled a fiver out and slapped it down. “Keep the change,” he said as he grabbed his shopping (an assortment of root vegetables for Ron’s ‘rustic vegetable soup’ recipe and a frozen pizza for when it inevitably turned out inedible) and ran out onto the street.
“You’ll spill your wine if you act like that,” Draco sniped.
“Cool,” Harry said.
had he not just left Draco alone? Draco’s expression during the raid had made it clear that he wanted Harry to die on the spot, and their conversation had only made those sentiments more obvious. But Harry couldn’t stay away.
“Okay,” Hermione soothed. “But surely you have an idea of what you want to do? Not in life even, just what do you want to do
“It’s not glass, Potter,” Malfoy snorted.
Overall, it was a fairly standard interaction between him and Ginny. She hadn’t left in tears like she used to, at least, and Harry hadn’t had to deal with an urge to break something. Since the break-up, another memory he tried not to dwell on, every conversation with her felt like a test in a dream where he hadn’t revised so kept failing it over and over.
it announced along with a photo of the man himself, holding an Azkaban slate in his claw-like hands. If it hadn’t been for the occasional blink, Draco would have thought it was a Muggle photo. Then, under the mugshot, a smaller subheading read
Not even a second later, Harry strode back into the room.
They got to Pansy’s house and he followed her in to use her fireplace rather than risk Apparating so far under the influence. He kissed her cheek and she said, rather ominously, “Next time,” as he stepped into the grate.
Draco had a problem.
“I’ll see you in September, Potter,” she said. “Term starts on the 1st. Remember, you’ll need to be at the platform to escort the First Years.”
He caught their wands with practiced ease and put them in his pocket, before locking the door with a wave of his own wand.
He held the tape measure on Potter’s shoulder and ran it down to his wrist, smoothing it down his arm’s length and trying to pretend to himself that he couldn’t feel the bulges of Potter’s biceps.
“Robards said to drop these off. Where do you want ‘em?”
“How long will it be?”
Draco looked at the floor, but the smile that stretched across his lips was probably still obvious from space.
“You looked like you wanted saving,” he muttered, and the gratitude Draco felt momentarily outweighed the general hatred when he looked at Potter’s face.
He didn’t know how long the ticket in his wallet had been green before he noticed it when he was fishing through his wallet for a Muggle pound coin amongst the Sickles. The small square of green paper was just peeking out behind his Tesco Clubcard and he froze.
They were hideous: forest green with red trim, like someone had challenged themselves to design the ugliest Christmas robes for a joke. Sadly, their owner — a stout man in his thirties — took them completely seriously. He dropped them off a week ago and asked Draco to alter them to fit after he’d put on a few pounds. Draco took them with the idea he could accidentally set fire to them instead because it went against all of his morals to let such a crime against fashion exist, but his professional code of conduct (and Maggie glaring daggers at his back) had so far stopped him. At least they were nearly finished and were being collected later today so Draco wouldn’t have to look at them any more.
“I’m going back to work if this is all done?” Greg directed the question at Potter who nodded.
. I’m just trying to help, you know — you could give me a bit of respect.”
Weasley pointed at Granger, who shook her head, then Potter, who mumbled, “Coffee.”
“How long is it meant to…” he began to ask, but he didn’t bother to finish the sentence as a creeping discomfort seeped from his stomach.
If Draco had been able to distance himself from the atrocities of the War, he would have done exactly the same as them. He couldn’t begrudge them forever.
Caught out, Pansy pursed her lips and said, “You arrived late,
Harry rolled his eyes. “So it’ll be in the morning
“Ha!” Draco barked, humorlessly. “As if.”

written on every pocket.”
“Hey mate,” Greg flipped a stained tea towel over his shoulder as he easily popped a beer bottle cap off against a bottle opener fixed to the counter in a practised movement, which he gave to a man on Draco’s left.
The litany of everything that didn’t work between them went on for what felt like hours, and yet even after he said all that, she’d just laughed like she wanted to cry and said, “
Potter crossed his arms. “That sounds extortionate?”
“I didn’t know it was a funeral,” Potter said.
His skin was tingling with anticipation as he sat next to Harry on the two-person sofa. The cushions’ stuffing was uneven and even though he sat by the arm, Draco slipped down towards the middle of the couch.
“No wait, let us guess,” Millie said eagerly, fluttering her hands in front of her like a butterfly stretching its wings. She began counting on her fingers. “Someone we know. He’s hot and Draco’s proud of it, but also a bit ashamed.
“Yes, sir.”
Pansy followed his lead, chucking the boxes in the bin on their way out. “Tell me now?”
“Good thing you’ve got Ron to be your gut instead, then,” he said with a smile. “And your parents. And his parents. And me. And Ginny.”
She nailed him with a ‘you’re-full-of-shit’ look that Draco was pretty sure she’d perfected after years watching him dole it out to others. “You’ve been staying late on Fridays. You always used to leave early to see your friends.”
want it, then you don’t have to do it.”
“That’ll be Theo,” Blaise said.
“For the case?” Ambrose asked hopefully. They were at a dead end in the mirror investigation.
“I would take that trade,” Harry said seriously, thinking about the piles and piles of mind-numbing reports waiting to be reviewed.
“I wasn’t lying — it
Draco had been too good at his job when he designed them. He’d chosen every seam, every stitch, with Potter’s body and tastes in mind. If he put someone else in the robes, they’d merely look okay, and Draco’s professional pride couldn’t handle that.
said anything
In his imagination, the scene changed rapidly, his mind providing a montage of all the ways Potter had infuriated him for the last week, except he allowed the scenarios to go further than he had before. Potter stumbled during the fitting and Draco caught him, but Potter didn’t pull away this time; instead, he wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders and pulled him closer, tilting his head and fitting his lips against Draco’s. The kiss was dirty and passionate and Draco tore at the robes, ripping them from Potter’s body so that his hands could stroke his back, his shoulders, his arms, his waist.
“No,” Harry said, trying to untangle the knots in his head. Something tried to tell him that this wasn’t normal, but it
“Makes me happy,” Pansy said. “It’s like the good old days when we were actually invited to galas.”
Maggie appeared from the floor behind the till where she had apparently been crouching, chattering away. “Sorry, sorry, I dropped a pot of pins and I’m trying to— Mr. Potter!”
“Draco?” Maggie said.
“I don’t get it,” Millie said.
“Yes, you did,” Harry butted in quickly, his voice a little frantic. “I helped you up at Underborough, remember? You were covered in pickles.”
ago. I didn’t have feelings for Draco back
“We’re adults, he’s being ridiculous—”
However, instead of leading them back downstairs, Harry took him up another flight of stairs and into yet another sitting room. This one was much more lived in. The furniture was modern and cosy rather than the traditional, austere style of the rest of the house. There was a large burgundy crocheted blanket thrown over the back of a loveseat that Harry sat down on. In his dress robes, he looked very out of place. He tugged at the collar, running a finger around his neck, and Draco’s heartbeat doubled in time.
“So.” Ginny’s glass clinked against the glass top of the coffee table. “Want to tell me about it?”
Granger and Weasley sat next to each other on the three-person sofa. Potter was in the armchair closest to the fireplace and he pointedly didn’t look up at Draco, his attention focused on the book in his lap. There was a baby lying on Granger’s chest, its face resting against her breast, and Draco remembered Pansy’s comments about the birth and felt his face heat.
Draco shook his head. “No, nearly was but, uh,” he laughed and the sound was scratchy in his blocked throat, “Harry Potter came at the last moment.”
Draco stood. Any closeness he’d felt between the two of them had disappeared with Potter’s arrival and the revelation that Granger was now
Draco swirled his wine again and held it up to the light, watching the legs run down the insides of the glass. “I’m a connoisseur of fine things, I can’t deny it,” he said loftily, raising an eyebrow at Blaise. “But I’d also choose someone I’d have a chance with.”
Harry blushed and tried not to allow that news to make him too happy.
.” He got to his feet and stood on his tiptoes to look at the bar. “
“The rest of the team will hold down the fort, don’t worry,” Robards rushed to placate him, once again missing the point of Harry’s question.
Maggie grinned. “This is fun. It’s like team bonding. Next one: Jacqueline Cordelia’s job. Six. I don’t have a clue who that is.”
“Here you go, good as new,” Harry heard him say brightly.
. The street was dark, so he could only get the indistinct outline of a group of people.
Robards didn’t look interested. “You don’t think they would hide any law-breaking from a famous Auror on the occasions he stopped by?”
“And they’re M

,” Potter said, and Theo’s nose jerked back into position in a way that looked incredibly uncomfortable.
“Of course not! I just want to be my own person and do what makes me happy,” Maggie said, her voice scratching over the denial. Her eyes were quickly filling with tears, clinging to her eyelashes like raindrops caught in a spider’s web.
Draco lingered and looked between his friends. “You don’t have to help,” he protested, but stopped when he received three identical looks of disbelief so settled on a muttered, “Thanks.”
“You… quit?” he asked and then shook his head sharply, scolding himself for focusing on probably the
“Slut,” he’d said. Draco had given him the finger.

“What are
“What’s going on?” Draco demanded.
He thought back to what he’d seen of Potter’s fashion sense; if his Muggle clothes in Hyde Park the other day were any indication of his wardrobe, he was basically a lost cause. “What’s the dress code? It’ll say on the invitation,” he added when Potter blinked gormlessly.
He nodded and they fell into an awkward silence as they sipped their drinks. She took a bite of carrot cake and hummed with pleasure. “This is good.”
“When did he go?” she asked.
“What was the raid?” Ron asked.
Ron shook his head and jerked his thumb over his shoulder towards the briefing room. Harry picked up his coffee from the table and followed him in. “I don’t know how women notice those kinds of things.
He dropped his eyes to the whiskey tumbler, his finger tracing along the pattern etched in the crystal. He swilled the amber liquid in a smooth movement and took a sip. Seamus’ whiskey was smooth — sweeter than the usual mid-shelf bottles that Harry usually bought.
Harry laughed, kneeling up so he could strip. Draco took the opportunity to lie back on the loveseat properly, wriggling one leg down along the back so Harry was kneeling between his thighs. Cloak off, Harry chucked it across the coffee table and got to work on the bowtie. Draco sat up and tried to help with the buttons on the waistcoat, but his fingers were clumsy and Harry kept distracting him with kisses pressed against his lips, on his cheeks, on his jaw…
He didn’t know whether it was the late hour or the post-orgasm fog rendering him stupid, but he didn’t even react when Potter put his hand on his shoulders and
Harry froze, his hand over the tie. He peered at Draco through his lashes.
“What are you doing?”
“I think it’s good you made a stand,” Hermione sniffed. “I’ve been telling you and Ron for years that the Aurors need reform.”
And he always did all of these movements while inwardly chanting,
bread,” she said.
“Do we know him?” Blaise asked, and when Draco grimaced, followed up with, “Who is it? Someone embarrassing?”
“Oh yes, Harry mentioned the funeral. Are you okay?”
It was anticlimactic at first. Feeling slightly stupid, he held the empty vial at his side as he waited for something to happen.
Draco’s brain ground to a halt. His face paled. “I did
“It’s being investigated,” Kingsley reassured him.

, he tried to command himself, shutting his eyes and concentrating on slowing his breathing, trying to trick his body into slumber. It didn’t work. His back broke out in phantom hives and he squirmed, rolling from side to back to side.
“Yes,” Draco said shortly. “But I didn’t tell her you were there the other night.”
“Uh, yeah, she’s— she’s good?” Despite stumbling over his words, Potter didn’t seem as surprised as Draco at this development.
“Draco.” For the first time, he noticed Malfoy’s purple haired colleague seated behind the till. Presumably she’d been there the whole time and it would probably worry some of Harry’s fellow Aurors that he’d completely failed to notice her. He’d also forgotten her name again. “Don’t worry, Mr. Potter, we’re still open so you didn’t keep us waiting.”
“Well enough,” Malfoy said, “but you can’t hold us accountable if they don’t meet some Ministry requirements that you didn’t specify.” His tone was icy.

“You would,” she agreed. “So, what happened?”
He sighed. “I
“Sure,” Draco said.
She still didn’t answer, but when he hailed a taxi, she slid into the passenger seat, folding her arms and glaring out the window until they arrived at Grimmauld Place. Ginny put the bag of books on the kitchen table, twisting the bag handles in her fingers as she hovered.
times to apologise. He was lucky he hadn’t cursed him the last time he’d knocked on the door.
“No, he was injured in Thorne’s capture on Saturday, actually. I had to take him to the Healers.”
“Not a peep. Had to basically sneak out the house this morning — I think she would have tried to come with me just to have something to do.”
He was always going to be a criminal; he knew that. But he’d thought that if he stayed out of trouble, then they would never have a reason to come find him. Apparently not. Not only would they continue to treat him like a Death Eater, they’d drag his friends and coworkers in as well. It was a nice touch that they involved Potter, too. Clearly, someone had thought that kicking Draco in the stomach wasn’t quite enough, so they spat on him while he was lying on the floor for good measure.
Pansy and Millie snickered; Blaise gave him the finger. “Where’s Theo? He’ll be on my side.”
you,” he hissed, lunging forward and trying to shove Potter right back. But Potter was stronger and faster than him, not to mention a trained Auror while Draco was a tailor, and he easily caught Draco’s hands and restrained him, pinning his hands against his sides. Potter’s eyes flicked down and up his barely clothed body. His forehead smoothed out, the frown replaced by a thoughtful expression.
“Fine. Honestly,” he added when she gave him a doubtful once-over. “I hadn’t mentioned it to you guys yet, but Robards had told me they were planning on promoting me to Head Auror at the end of the year and the whole thought of that was stressing me out, so I think it was only a matter of time before I cracked.”
“You... saw me and Pansy eating chicken wings, so now you think we’re hatching some Death Eater plot?” he clarified.
“That’s not hard,” he said and didn’t dodge out of the way quick enough when Pansy slapped him across the back of the head.
He held a file out. “Finished the write-up of the raid — thought you might want it?”
“Thanks Goyle,” Potter said. He gestured to Naismith and talked to the officers “That’s the man.”
. I thought you were just having sex with me for some kind of undercover investigation.”
“There are children, Pansy,” Draco interrupted sharply as a few catcalls broke out further down the table.
Malkin’s Magical Tailoring was an unassuming shop on an unassuming London high street, hidden amongst the plethora of Muggle nail salons, kebab takeaways, and charity shops filled with unwanted items. The road was too narrow for the volume of traffic that Muggles insisted on sending down it and conversations were often interrupted by the blare of horns as double-decker buses brought traffic to a standstill. Malkin’s Magical Tailoring masqueraded as a nameless independent dry-cleaner. On one side, it neighboured a real estate agent that displayed sun-bleached pictures of bedsits and house shares, and on the other, an empty alley. The nearest wizarding business was an old pub a ten-minute walk away, whose fireplace Draco used to commute.
The little bell above the door jangled loudly to announce his presence. The girl with the long purple hair stood adjusting the robes on a mannequin while talking to Malfoy, who was sitting behind the front desk, sipping a cup of tea. They both fell absolutely silent and stared at him as he burst in.
“Harry.”
“Fuck,
conditions?” he asked.
“Okay, okay,” Draco said, holding his hands up, “I get it, I forgive you.”
“Do you have the stuff for a Zombie?” Greg asked.
“Alright, alright,” he muttered, putting down his coffee and turning his attention to Potter’s robes.
“Don’t apologise.”
“His words, not mine, Mr. Malfoy,” McGonagall said.
Draco pointedly looked around the empty room. “There aren’t many people here to appreciate my talents,” he said, then ran his tongue over his lips. He took a deep breath. “Besides. There are certain things I want to do to you that’ll be pretty hard to do if you’re wearing clothes…”
Malfoy placed his palm flat on Harry’s sternum as he worked. Harry was acutely aware of his heart beating embarrassingly quickly and he prayed Malfoy couldn’t feel it through the few thin layers of fabric. He tried not to sigh audibly when the hand moved away.
Struck with a sudden urgency to get moving, Harry leapt out of his chair and grabbed his wand holster from the coat stand.
to come here tonight. I tried to argue with the Head Auror to get him to cancel the raid, but he wouldn’t.”
think about the way Potter’s chest felt under his fingers. Unwittingly, his eyes flicked up to see whether Potter was watching him; the other man was staring over the top of Draco’s head at the wall, but as if he felt Draco’s gaze on him, he looked down just as Draco was looking up and he found himself staring into those famous emerald eyes from only a foot way. He swallowed and jerked his attention back to the tape measure, staring at the numbers until he could make sense of them enough to tell the Quill.
“This is nice,” he said, looking out over the Lake. The Giant Squid was splashing some figures on the opposite shore.
work, but I guess I don’t have that excuse anymore so… Who knows, maybe I’ll be gone within the month.” He laughed. “Come on,” he said, “this room gives me the creeps.”
He gestured around at the foyer again. He briefly wondered how Potter had got past the wards, but then he remembered that one of the terms allowing him to stay in Malfoy Manor had been to grant the Auror department access to the house at all times.
So, weakly, he said, “Great.”
“I don’t know how you withstood the indignity,” Pansy said with a sardonic smile. “What Healer did you see?”
“Why do you care?”
Malfoy rolled his eyes and stepped closer to adjust the weird, upright collars. Harry blinked, not sure where to look as Malfoy fussed around his neck — no one had been that close to him since… Well, since Malfoy had measured him and before that it must have been months. When had he and Ginny ended it?
“Oof, poor you. I’ve avoided those questions so far.”
the news and I’d hear it.”
Harry was intimately familiar with all of Ginny’s pissed-off tones of voice and he winced. The chances of this ending up in a screaming match were high.
She left in the startled silence that followed. By the time Draco and Harry had processed what she’d said, her tartan robes had disappeared into the throng of people.
“You should try Confunding him next time. I hear that has a pretty good success rate,” Harry said, throwing a grin at Hermione, who stuck two fingers up at him.
“That wasn’t because of— that was
I have one final person to thank for this fic, and that's you. Thank you so much for sticking around until the end, and I hope you enjoyed reading it even half as much as I enjoyed writing it.
Blaise finally composed himself long enough to ask, “How did it happen?”
, Po-” He cut himself off before he could finish the name. “I might have been a good fuck but I wouldn’t give my cock enough credit to make you quit your job.”
Draco could feel his eyebrows disappear into his hairline. “Really?”
He considered it, weighing the pros and cons once more. A long pause stretched between them but before Potter could start fidgeting again, he decided.
A muffled knock interrupted Maggie before she could continue her interrogation. They glanced towards the source of the sound, where the indistinct silhouette of a waiting customer was visible through the frosted glass. They exchanged a surprised look. No one had
The kiss was tentative at first, but it didn’t stay chaste for long. Harry turned around to face Draco fully, allowing the sweet kiss to deepen into something more primal, urgent,
“Oh, you don’t have to rush out on my account,” Harry said quickly as he also stood. “I could make you another cup of tea…” A glance down told him that Kingsley’s mug was still half full.
“It’s that simple?” Harry asked, the disbelief clear.
Not that he directed any of those feelings at his friends. He was happy for their success and their happiness — he definitely
“We’re
being under a love spell.
And yet even amongst his gorgeous friends, Draco knew he stood out. Maggie had spent all week helping him tailor his outfit. It was technically a set of his father’s old robes that he’d bought and never worn that Draco had found at the back of his wardrobe, still in its bag. The cloak was navy blue and fell to his mid-calf. He’d added gold filigree growing like vines from the bottom hem and cuffs. He’d resisted Maggie’s plea for him to wear skintight leather trousers and had instead gone for a matching blue slim-fit trousers — high-waisted so his legs appeared to go for miles. Draco had left the musketeer-style shirt mostly unlaced, the deep V of the neckline plunging to show off his chest. When he’d met the others at Pansy’s, Blaise had looked right at his exposed skin and smirked.
“Don’t the Aurors have a uniform department who could just give you a new set?”
“It’s not a bad thing, Potter. I was merely curious as to why this job appeals to you. Your resume is very impressive, but it doesn’t explain
, and he succeeded. At first.
“Hello-oh, what in the shit happened in here?!”
Patronus summoning them,” he said.
but, well, he kind of
He glanced at the others, who were watching them with interest, and eventually shrugged. “It’d be a bit hypocritical for any of us to have a problem with that when we’re rubbing elbows with Muggles every weekend.”
“And I’m very glad you do,” Draco said, silently adding,
The man sucked his teeth and jotted down a few notes. “And do you often host parties of wizards in a Muggle shop?”
, Mum, tell
“Was he? I didn’t hear that,” Mrs. Weasley said, clearly distracted as everyone scrambled to make room in the centre of the table for the food. “Right, Arthur says the steak is well done on the red plate and rare on the blue plate. Luna, Hermione, I did the vegetarian ones on a separate grill, that’s the green plate, okay?”
Harry chewed his lip angrily, but couldn’t think of a retort. Robards nodded to himself.
“Good, sir.”
An Auror approached them, different to the woman from earlier, but still not Potter. Surely he was leading this charge. Was he hiding from Draco?
He’d hoped they’d be able to sneak back unnoticed, but the moment he stepped out onto the balcony with Harry, Greg yelled, “Draco, finally! There you are! I’m making Mai Tais, d’you want one?”
Ginny shrugged. “Maybe try apologising?”
“When are you next seeing them, Harry? We need to get a card and some flowers,” Ambrose said.
?” Pansy suggested, waggling her eyebrows.
“Sure,” Maggie said in a placating tone that clearly emphasised that she thought he’d lost his marbles. “Who was that?”
Harry tumbled onto his back, his chest heaving, and Draco rolled over, slotting under Harry’s arm and resting his head on his shoulder.
“What the
He shook his head, waving his hand. He felt a bit bad for making a big deal out of it. Clearly, Hermione wanted to talk to people with some knowledge of what she’d been through, and all Harry was doing was making her conflicted about talking to Parkinson while offering no suitable alternative. It wasn’t like
“Sorry, guess I’m tired.” he said, dropping his head into his hands, rubbing his palm against his forehead.
“I’d think so? If I were you, I’d get a curse-breaker to have a look, but I don’t think there’s any risk of killing you.”
“Yeah,” he grumbled.
The timer went off in the kitchen and Ron leapt to his feet with a war cry, charging off to check on dinner. His New Years’ Resolution had been to help more around the home and he approached cooking with the same fervour he showed when duelling Dark Wizards. Hermione followed at a more sedate pace and held her hands out for Rose.
She didn’t cry, like he feared she would. Instead she stared up at him with her little mouth open and her head tilted to one side — like she was trying to figure out a convoluted puzzle. Draco looked down at her face in abject terror, waiting for something to go wrong, but she just closed her eyes and appeared to go to sleep.
Thinking about his dire kitchen stock and his growling stomach, he grabbed Pansy’s hand as they stood to leave.
“Okay…” he said.
He fell quiet.
“I never said you weren’t!”
Hermione stood up, a giant tome in her arms. “It kicks in when Mal-
“I’ll walk you home,” he offered.
“For fuck’s sake, Potter, can’t you even dress yourself?”
His eyes flickered up to Harry’s face as he slid the waistcoat down his arms. Was there any reason he did it so
Hermione yawned widely as she curled up on the corner of the sofa next to the fireplace, clutching her cup of tea.
“Well, cheers,” he said with forced jauntiness before tipping it back in a smooth motion. Draco followed suit a moment later.
“I don’t know how much Potter’s told you…” he said, trying not to look over, but Potter lurched forward suddenly, the book falling from his hands and onto the carpet with a soft
And then, like the brave saviour of the wizarding world and Head Auror in training he was, he fled the room as fast as he could.
Sympathetically, Harry said, “I’m sure you know what you’re doing. I mean, you’ve read every parenting book under the sun.”
His mug had cat ears and a handle moulded into the shape of a tail. Swirling handwriting on the mug itself declared

“Millie’ll stay, I’m going to check outside,” Pansy said, getting up as well.
, sorry, says Harry’s name,” she said. “I was looking at Summoning Spells, but
Draco’s lip slipped from between his teeth as he snorted, his head dropping down as he laughed. Harry joined in and the next thing he knew, they were both in a slightly hysterical fit of giggles. Draco gasped and ran his hand across his face, digging his fingers into his eyes as he regained control of himself.
Madam Malkin continued as if her granddaughter hadn’t spoken. “And what happens when I die? Who’s going to take over my life’s work? Are you just going to leave it to the highest bidder?”
“Yes,” Draco agreed, “I’ll be having words with Hugo when he’s old enough about how arriving three weeks early is very rude. I spent ages on Ron’s dress robes just for him to weasel out of it.”
As Potter exhaled, Draco adjusted the measure and he did
“Well,” Rolf shrugged, a cheeky grin stretching across his wide mouth, “who could have predicted that?”
Rubbing his temples, Harry gave a rundown of the Underborough Market incident and Bill waved his wand in complicated shapes in the air, silvery lines hanging like mist behind the movements for a second before fading into nothingness.
Seriously,
“We’re idiots,” he said eventually.
So. It had clearly all been part of a ploy. Some kind of internal investigation that Potter had wanted the upper hand in — though what investigation involved a small tailor shop, he didn’t know. He had a horrible suspicion it wasn’t anything about Maggie’s shop, though, and had everything to do with
Harry took them and hurriedly pulled them on, eager to regain some modesty, then a shirt. That was about the number of layers Harry was used to. If he threw on a travelling cape, it was an ordinary outfit.
“Oh.” The Healer frowned and glanced over his shoulder and Harry knew what he was going to say before he got the words out. “I think he’s just left. He’s probably down the hall, if you want to run after him?”
“Is it going to take long?” Potter asked, looking at his dented wristwatch.
“That’s good,” Draco said and then cursed himself. He’d been to enough parties to be better at small talk than this. He cast around for a topic and settled on the baby in Potter’s arms: parents loved talking about their children. “How old is… she?” He was reasonably confident someone had used a girl’s name earlier.
“Can you

“Pfft.”
Draco whirled around to stare at him incredulously. “You can’t blame it on
He dumped Potter’s robes on a free table and checked on his other work. The ugly Christmas robes were hemmed, but the needle and thread had got bored in his absence and had started embroidering curse words in looping, flowery cursive.
Maggie shifted her weight next to him and pinched Draco’s thigh behind the desk. Draco sighed and drummed his fingers on the folded scraps of fabric.
“What do you think?” Malfoy asked. He sounded smug already, like he could guess what Harry was thinking.
The little red ticket in his wallet turned green at some point on Wednesday morning but Harry didn’t notice it until he was fishing around in his wallet for some Muggle money to buy a coffee on his way back from the gym.
It was a practical movement, he needed a looser measurement so he didn’t make the collar too tight for Potter to breathe, he’d done it a hundred times with his friends and other customers. There was no reason for it to feel any different, except that it was
“Okay.”
too?! The
It was definitely weird though; he couldn’t argue with that.
What had he said about MLEP? Something about not coming to help if it wasn’t Harry’s Patronus summoning them?
“Ah. Did you enjoy your rest days?”
But no one else arrived, so Harry helped him lower the coffin and said a few words and pretended that it wasn’t strange when Draco had sobbed on his shoulder; that it was normal for him to thread his arm around Draco’s waist and guide him back to the Manor, because he was shivering like a wet puppy in his drenched robes.
Weasley returned to the room, precariously balancing three cups and a plate of biscuits that looked suspiciously homemade. He set down a tea on the end table between Harry and Draco’s seats.
“Good morning, Madam Malkin,” he said politely.
“Well, yes, and no. The woman has now testified under oath that Madam Malkin paid her to put in the tip. Some family squabble, from what I understand.”
He reached for his wand, and the woman in front of him in the line gasped and pulled her child closer to her side. Her mouth hung open, stretching her face into a mask of horror as she stared at his forearm. It was mid-summer and Draco had rolled his shirt sleeves up before putting on his cloak, because he’d tailored his coat, like all his clothes, to fit tightly around his forearm.
, Harry thought grumpily as he looked at his desk, grateful for once that he couldn’t see without his glasses. At least this way he physically couldn’t read anything; it was a welcome, brief respite from responsibility.
“What about a friends and family one?” Potter asked with a small smile and it took Draco an unpleasant beat before he realised he was joking.
In Ginny’s head, if she didn’t want to do something, she didn’t have to do it.
,” the man dared. “Just give me a reason to hurt you before I kill Nott.” His attention was solely on Draco now, spit flying from his mouth onto the tile like a rabid dog, his lips curled back from his teeth. He was unhinged, no doubt about it, but he also easily stood in a practiced duelling stance as he continued his litany of death wishes. “Azkaban would be too good for you, you evil
Yeah, it was weird. Definitely a lot to spring on anyone out of nowhere, and even more inappropriate when it was his ex-girlfriend.
“Why would he care what
Potter’s eyes darted from side to side and Draco could practically see the cogs turning slowly (probably fighting against years of rust from not having to deal with a single thought).
“Hm. Maybe?”
“Wow,” he said sincerely. “They’re amazing.”
“…Holy fucking shit,” she screamed, and the three of them broke down into uncontrollable laughter once again.
Potter looked down at the proximity between them, and his pupils were blown out. He bit his lip and his warm breath fanned across Draco’s face.
office — it definitely wasn’t the cleaner’s responsibility to decide what was or wasn’t rubbish.
Ginny changed the topic. “So when’s your next shift?”
“I don’t like your tone, Margaret. Do you know how much others would pay to have my advice? I run the most successful robemakers in London, no one else even comes close. And I built that shop from the ground up, you’d do well to listen to my advice if you insist on this harebrained scheme!.”
“I thought the plan was to take Harry’s mind
Harry nodded and put his half-full glass on the table. “Yeah, yeah.”
“But…
“You alright down there?” a deep, male voice asked and Draco’s stomach dropped as his day got even worse.
“Come on, Draco,” she taunted. “What’re you afraid of?”
His heart hammered in his chest and clenched his free hand into a tight fist as he considered the possibility that some incantation had caused everything that had happened between them.
“Oh it is, it is. Nasty business. And you’ll of course have time to contribute where you can and you’ll be at all the briefings and meetings, but delegation is another important skill that you’ll need to practice so this will be a good opportunity.”
“Uh… Nothing really, just a bit of extra work he wants done. Oh, and an order to go to the War Recovery ball this year.”
“One for you,” she said and tossed a letter on his desk.
Potter frowned, but he didn’t reply. For the first time, Draco noticed the deep shadows under his eyes. He walked up to the counter and ordered a burger and some chips. Draco watched his back (

“This is just a quick diagnostic,” Bill explained as he drew more shimmering white lines in the air. “It shouldn’t hurt at all.”
“Going up the walls. Already finished half the books you brought round the other day.”
“Malfoy,” he said, shoving his hands into his pockets. “I didn’t expect to see you here.”
Draco released Potter’s shirt and snaked his hand up to grab a fistful of hair, pulling Potter’s head back a few inches so he could look into his eyes. He raised an eyebrow.
about work stuff... You know I told you about Potter— Oh, for
Compared to the uptight Auror who forced Draco to see a Healer that morning, Potter was unrecognisable. Gone was any hint of self-assured authority, replaced by a man who wouldn’t have looked out of place in a hippy commune. His top was several years old (judging by the holes in the hem and flaking letters), his jeans were ripped, and he was wearing a ridiculous elasticated headband to keep his shaggy hair from falling into his eyes.
He hated how soft and warm Draco’s hand was around his, and he hated himself even more for clinging to it like a drowning man to a raft. He couldn’t resist, though, knowing this might be the last time he would touch Draco. He tried to assume a casual air as he held the vial up to his lips. Draco did the same. Their eyes met, and Harry’s stomach jerked.
Someone knocked on the wizarding door. Draco and Millie exchanged a cautious look.
Draco imagined it. Falling asleep next to Harry and waking up beside him tomorrow. Criticising his choice of tea bags as Harry made him breakfast (Draco certainly wouldn’t do any of the cooking). Helping him pick out an outfit that actually had some thought behind it…
“Yeah, well, he’s gay, he doesn’t count…” Ron trailed off as Robards arrived, striding to the lectern at the front of the briefing room. Ambrose and Belinda followed behind him and slid into their seats, trading the usual comments about the weather and what they had done on their days off while they waited for the rest of the team to gather. Ron was getting most of the attention with the baby due any day now and Harry sat back, drifting in and out of the conversation as he scanned the boards behind the lectern.
“Can’t I meet you at St. Mungo’s once Granger’s looked you over?” he asked, uncomfortable at the thought of being alone with three Gryffindors.
“Well,” Ron said, clapping his hands together, “that’s good news. Thanks for coming over, mate.”

to Potter until the space between their bodies vanished. His heart stuttered and his cock stirred with renewed interest.
“And when this shop goes under because you didn’t listen to any of my advice—”
“I don’t think you have much to offer them. Unless you pulled out your wand.” He realised his mistake as soon as the words left his mouth and before Blaise had a chance to say something disgusting, he quickly added, “And don’t make a joke about your cock because I shared a dorm with you for seven years and can safely say
Draco grimaced. “How about—”
The only thing stopping him from living out his dream of being a successful robemaker was his own stupid pride.
Theo straightened and swallowed, then nodded and plastered on a smile. He handed the bloodied handkerchief back to Draco with a soft thanks. They paused as they exited the bathroom and saw Potter leaning against one of the walls, his arms crossed and watching the Muggles with vague interest.
“What’s stopping you?” Draco asked.
Draco spotted him immediately, standing at the top of the lawn with Ron and Hermione as well as Luna and George Weasley, and his mouth went dry.
doing here?” he asked suspiciously.
“Plus, he said it in front of Hagrid. So, you can imagine he got all teary about the thought of me taking over his job and he started talking about how good I’d be, because I was so good with Buckbeak” — Draco shuddered — ”and Aragog. And it just
Despite being described by the
“It’s all moot, anyway. He doesn’t like me. Quite understandable, really, given… Given everything…” His eyes fell on the black lines that were just peeking around his forearm. He swallowed and blinked angrily.
Draco snorted. “Yeah, right.”
He was looking at Draco with an expression that was both hopeful and wary.

flashed up at him as the MLEP memo disintegrated.
Pansy pounced. “Layla? Who’s
As he straightened the shirt, he murmured, “It might be difficult for you to believe, but I’ve changed since I was seventeen, Potter.”
“What do you think?” Draco asked without turning to look at the doorway, twisting his arm back and forth, watching the colours morph.
Harry lunged for him, pushing him back so his head landed on the arm of the loveseat, Harry’s hands bracketing his face. They kissed fiercely and Draco didn’t even try to keep quiet, moaning into Harry’s lips as he fisted one hand in the back of his hair, pulling him closer. He tried to wrap the other around Harry’s waist, but it quickly got tangled in the never-ending folds of his cape and he grunted in frustration, reaching up to the clasps at his breast.
“I thought you were going to Underborough to get
“I’m the dad. I need to look after Rose while Hermione sleeps,” he said defensively.
He wandered around the ground floor, opening doors at random and exploring what was behind them. Part of it, he told himself, was an interest in an ancient pureblood house; but the things that mostly drew his attention were banal, everyday objects like the Holyhead Harpies poster stuck to the back of the pantry door; a ratty Muggle band t-shirt thrown over the arm of a chair; the brand of tea bags on the counter.
“Alright, you four, line up against that wall over there,” an Auror ordered. She was tall, with sleek dirty blonde hair slicked back into a low ponytail. She gestured to the wall, looking bored by the ordeal as Draco, Pansy, Millie and Blaise followed her instructions.
He hadn’t told Maggie about Potter’s involvement in the raid on her shop. He’d decided that entirely to protect her feelings: she’d already been in floods of tears simply standing in the wreckage the next morning and Draco couldn’t bear to make it worse. Potter absolutely did not deserve Maggie’s worship, but if there was ever a correct moment to vilify a young woman’s idol, it wasn’t when she was trying to clean up the debris of her life’s work.
“Have you felt anything strange or unusual in the last few months? Since Harry started turning up everywhere?”
He quickly located the Snitch and tucked it into his pocket as he glided down to the edge of the woodland. He leant his broom against the fence, looking around the small graveyard with a grimace. It had been too long since he’d made the short trip. Like his mother’s flower beds, the plots were overgrown with an explosion of weeds.
“No?” Harry shook his head, a bit startled by all the attention.
“I’ll pay for them,” Harry said, affronted. “I don’t know where I’m going to wear them, though, seeing as I’m not being forced to go to that stupid ball anymore.”
His hands scrabbled with the hem of Potter’s top. He pulled back, their panting loud in the Manor's silence as he broke the kiss for a moment so he could pull the thin cotton shirt off. He threw it to the corner as Harry surged forward with enough force to slam him against the wall. Draco groaned loudly, dropping his head back as Potter kissed along his jawline and down to his neck. He tilted his head to the side, giving Potter more access to suck and nip, his eyes rolling back in his head as his tongue swiped across the sensitive skin.
She wrinkled her nose, grinning. “I suppose I’m quite lucky, aren’t I?”
He covered his face with his hands. When, exactly, had he become so pathetic?
“Hermione,” Harry interrupted. “Can we not do this right now? I don’t know if I can even think about next week, let alone life plans.”
A Muggle came out of the men’s as Draco approached, looking over his shoulder with a confused expression that immediately told him there was going to be trouble.
“It’s not on purpose, I promise,” Potter said coldly. “Next time you’re about to get hexed in front of me, I can assure you I won’t help.”
“What’s up with you?” Maggie asked.
What would happen if it got taken off and Potter went back to normal, but Draco was stuck with these stupid
,” Draco said under his breath and began to wonder whether the man was having a very public breakdown.
“Thank you,” Harry said, shifting on the uncomfortable chair as Robards meandered his way over to the point.
Harry turned back to Hermione who gave him a small, apologetic smile but didn’t contradict Parkinson, who was tapping her foot impatiently.
Draco tried to keep his smile from looking too predatory. “I’ll show you,” he said.
“I’m heading out, Draco,” Maggie said, belting up her floor-length grey coat.
“Just… How are you?” Harry asked. He was aware of exactly how lame the words were as they came out, but it was too late to think of a better question.
“Um? You alright?” the cashier asked.
She continued babbling and Draco, confident that he was forgiven, relaxed back into the couch cushions and let Millie’s story become a familiar background drone. He sipped his wine, it was smooth and rich, the liquid leaving long oily drips on the inside of the glass.
explained their problem to the star-struck receptionist, she personally escorted them to a private room immediately. Draco had the distinct impression that if he’d been there alone, they would have left him sitting in the waiting room with the other plebs for at least three hours.
The self-stitching needle had finished the seam and was in the middle of embroidering a ‘
He sneered. “Not me, either, Potter. Might have escaped your notice in your crusade against dark wizards, but I don’t actually own this shop. You’ve just fucked over a totally innocent witch.”
“Where’s the birthday boy?” Pansy asked, standing on her tiptoes and scanning the crowd.
Kingsley sighed. “You can probably guess,” he said. “The Aurors.”
“It still feels like I’m wearing a duvet,” he grumbled defensively.
“Nope, stop trying to distract us. What’s the face? What gossip have you got?”
Draco could
“Red wine, please.”
Perhaps Greg wanted to say something else, but whatever ember of courage he’d discovered had flickered out. “Alright,” he said and stopped fiddling with the apron string, tucking his hands into his pockets instead. “So, do you guys have any money?”
He strode back to Potter’s side, telling him, “Just three more — I’m going to take your inseam now,” as he would with any client he was measuring. “Stand up straight,” he ordered and then knelt.
“What the
hadn’t felt grey. That had been a burst of colour, so vivid it had blinded him momentarily.
Before Maggie could start on him again, he got up and left the room. She didn’t follow him, but he could feel her eyes on his back as he straightened the neckties. He pointedly kept his back away from her, fiddling with them even after they were perfectly aligned, until he heard her knitting needles clicking together once again. He didn’t go back into the sewing room.
“He got to act the hero
Potter’s brows twitched. “You work here?”
After that, Harry noticed someone would ‘just happen to be in the area’ if he didn’t show his face for over two days.
He leaned his hip against the desk and crossed his arms tightly across his chest. Harry hadn’t seen him wearing this outfit before and it was distinctly lower-effort than his normal style: just a plain button-up shirt in a sea-foam green that brought out hints of blue in his eyes and… were those
His dreams didn’t afford him the same respite.
Cherry wood shelves (repurposed bookshelves from the Malfoy library) sectioned his corner off from the rest of the shop, displaying shoes, ties, and cuff-links that sparkled under the warm light from the wall sconces. He kept the mannequins dressed in the most up-to-date styles he could get his hands on — he told Maggie it was for inspiring the customers but, if he was being honest, it was just as much for him. It felt high-end and expensive, and Draco revelled in the atmosphere.
“We had cause to investigate,” Robards said.

“Using my money.”
“She’s doing well, I think?” he said. He paid without a fuss and took a paper bag, already darkening at the bottom from the greasy chips.
“We— I’m worried about you,” Pansy continued.
“No, something else,” he said apologetically.
A couple of Muggles came in, laughing boisterously. When they noticed Theo and Draco at the sinks, quietly standing close to each other with Draco’s hand on Theo's shoulder, they gave each other pointed glances and then started sniggering.
“Potter, this is the man who reported it,” Greg said, pushing forward the Muggle who looked around at everyone with interest.
the Malfoys had a cemetery on their grounds) and seeing a solitary hunched figure in the distance, dressed all in black with his head bowed against the torrent.
Malfoy shuddered. “I dread to think what you consider dressing badly.”
“Right. Yeah. Um. I’ll go.”
“You’re late,” Malfoy snapped.
“Yes, sir.”
“We should go down,” Harry said with a sigh. “Before they come up.”
“If you’re going to stand around gormlessly, can you do it somewhere else?” Draco sniped, bringing Harry’s focus back to the situation at hand. He thought he heard him add, “Like maybe in front of a
Draco nodded slowly. “That was the first time I’d seen you since— in a few years,” he said.
The woman, Maggie, left the mannequin and approached the desk cautiously like Harry was a dog with an unpredictable temperament. “I’m sorry they’re not ready yet, Mr. Potter — I can ask Draco to prioritise them, but it will probably still be at least a day.”
wanted… What?
Draco froze, his hand clenched around his wallet. “What? Why?”
“You okay?” she asked softly, stilling in the middle of the room, robes piled in her arms.
,” he said, cleaning the come and drool off the two of them.
“I’m not
“We can both not be okay,” Maggie said and exhaled sharply.
With the music blaring and the birds chirping outside, he could almost forget the last fifteen years. He could pretend to be twelve again. If he rolled over and peered out the window, he would see his mum strolling in the garden with her friends, showing off the grounds. If he turned the dial up on his gramophone, no doubt his father would storm in and yell at him to
He didn’t notice that the speakers had finished until everyone got their feet around him. He stood up, a beat later than everyone else, taking Maggie’s hand as they watched the coffin get steadily lowered into the ground. There was a moment of silence, and Draco bowed his head and tried not to be impatient.
“Maggie, honestly,” he tried again, but she interrupted before he could get another word out.
it was Potter. Who else would it be?
There it was again: that feeling in his chest, the tightening that made it difficult to breathe.
Still, Harry had met a hundred MLEP officers in his time at the Aurors and they were pleasant people. He struggled to imagine them flat-out ignoring a report of someone getting assaulted, let alone when the incident took place in front of Muggles.
He listened to the
“Don’t bring it up, okay? I haven’t told anyone yet,” Harry asked as he and Ginny stood up.
Harry bristled. “There’s a ridiculous number of things in here,” he said defensively.
,” Ambrose said with a sad shake of his head. “You’ll see. I swear, I’d lost half my friends by the time I turned thirty.”
Draco barely said a word throughout the process except to summon Harry, not making any of the usual glib comments that Harry had become used to. Harry didn’t see why he was in such a foul mood given that he was getting everything he wanted: never seeing Harry ever again.
“Right, well, here you go,” he said.
“I— I wanted to talk to you,” he said with a helpless shrug.
He spluttered. “I— You— I was waiting for you to finish, not
“Get changed,” he ordered imperiously.
“It’s the other way around. Every time I
A far-away corner of his brain speculated on the logistics of being Splinched like that. You’d probably die, he mused. Someone would have to find you immediately if you were to have any hope of being stitched back up…
“Um,” Draco hesitated as he scanned the plastic-wrapped menu stuck to the bar, his eyes running up to the top of the page, looking for the smallest number. “Merlot?”
“That’s good,” Kingsley said.

Harry hummed, although he was increasingly feeling less like he’d made a moral stand against institutional corruption and more like he’d made an impulsive decision in the midst of a tantrum.

He gradually drifted higher. He was unused to flying for more than ten minutes — the maximum amount of time he and Ron could manage for a casual one-on-one in his garden before being distracted by wives or babies or work — and his body ached. He unclasped his hands from the handle and stretched his fingers out, massaging his knuckles roughly to get some blood flow back.
“Please call me Harry,” he said, feeling more and more ancient every time Maggie called him ‘Mister’.
Hermione rolled her eyes. “Those would be more helpful if they didn’t all say completely contradictory things. Then there’s Ron, just telling me to
“Wait,” Harry exclaimed, “What are you doing?”
He didn’t lose his cool like that this time. Though when Rose smiled up at him, her angelic face so innocent and pure, he couldn’t help the tear that fell onto the fleece blankets.
“You don’t
It took a moment for his vision to stop spinning, the foreign room slowly coming into focus. It was a living room with low ceilings, supported by sturdy timber beams that lanky Weasley surely hit his head on every day. A bookshelf that was filled to bursting lined an entire wall of the room: books on every subject imaginable crammed into any available space. Clearly, they had carefully designed the room to be homely and comforting. The deep blue armchairs and sofas were a matching set and complimented the slate grey tiles, which were mostly covered by a plush light grey rug. Draco carefully knocked the ash from his shoes as he stepped over the low grate.
Someone rapped their knuckles on the Muggle shop’s window and Draco jumped out of his skin, coming back to the present.
“What?” Draco asked.
“Thank you,” Draco said.
Harry clearly wasn’t one to follow instructions. He tried, half-heartedly, to do as he was told. But within minutes, he was writhing on the bed, bucking his hips and curling his toes and thrashing his head from side to side. He was almost incoherent with pleasure except for Draco’s name, which he repeated like a prayer. Every time he said it — his voice ragged — Draco felt himself get harder.
A memo shot through the crack at the bottom of his door and hovered above his desk before gently floating down. It came to a stop on top of the raid report. Harry’s heart lurched as he recognised the MLEP-headed paper and he picked up the paper.
“The customer service here is shit.”
, he turned on his heel and ran out the shop, eager to get away from everyone. Ginny called after him but didn’t immediately follow. He knew he
Draco’s mouth actually dropped open. “That was

“Yes?”
“Nah, you’re good. Go home. Have a big glass of wine.”
“I didn’t hang around long enough.”
“I said four.”
“It’s nothing bad!” Harry said quickly. “I just thought, in the spirit of us being” — he scrambled for an appropriate noun — “um, friends and talking to each other… I’m having a birthday party next weekend. Well, it’s a birthday party
been nearly a decade.”
Draco snorted. “Yes, I’m aware,” he said and then added in an off-hand tone, “It’s odd seeing you dressed well for once.”
Any Muggle who glanced at through the doorway would see a couple of desks and a few cheap sewing machines, rather than the self-sewing needles that were charmed to hem and embroider whilst hanging in the air. To Muggles, the pictures on the wall just looked like cut outs from magazines, not the wizarding photographs and illustrated fashion plates of models haughtily watching Draco and Maggie work in the most up-to-date styles of robes.
? He hadn’t even been promoted yet, but he was sounding more and more like Robards every day.
“Harry,” Kingsley said, but Harry cut him off.
” Draco mimicked in a shrill voice. “What’s your fucking problem, Potter?” he asked, scrunching the cloak in his fist as he spun to face Harry, his brows carved down and his teeth gritted. Harry’s temper flared, and his eyes narrowed.
He put the waistcoat carefully to one side and then came back to stand in front of Harry.
Draco didn’t want to pop her bubble. “Maybe,” he agreed. “I should do some actual work before I have to give Mr. Fitzherbert his robes back with ‘
Peri Peri chicken.
“Hmm…” She picked up the paper and inspected it closely. She was wearing the magnification spectacles that gave her big bug eyes and Draco snorted. “No, the ones I made had bias binding around the cuffs. They’re very similar though. Ooh, no one did the crossword.”
“If you ever need a reference for whatever new job you decide on, come to me.”
“How does
Kingsley had been right: if he spent more than a couple of days without talking to anyone, a weary apathy descended on him, and he found himself lost in a boundless melancholic sea. On those days, it quickly became impossible to get out of bed. They were endless moments where he was oddly aware of both the time slipping through his hands while also wishing that the day would end, begging the sun to set faster. He was wrung-out, like after one of his screaming matches with Ginny, when the anger finally died down and left him raw, empty, and exhausted.
“What did you mean earlier,” he asked out of the blue, “about quitting?”
“Oh, um,” Draco stuttered, momentarily taken aback. “Tea?”
“I want it,” he said, but his stomach knotted, and he found he couldn’t meet her gaze.
He restrained himself by chewing on his lip until it bled.
He was double-checking the measurements one last time when Maggie called his name from the shop front, her voice sounding oddly high-pitched and breathless.
“Briefly.”
but my gut is just saying
A knock at the door made him stop. Ron poked his head into the office.
He shook his head and cast a folding charm that stacked the robes into a neat pile which he pushed towards Potter. “You should go talk to your uniform suppliers.”
The problem was that the prospect of an organised gang of Dark Wizards behind the spread of cursed mirrors was complex and
when all Draco could manage was a whimper as he writhed on the sheets, desperately rocking down, trying to get
The shop floor was deserted. There wasn’t a sound from the other room, though the door stood open. Harry was alone with the rustling of fabric and his own heartbeat thrumming in his ears. His face burned and his cheeks must have been bright red (but that was okay because so long as the blood was rushing to his cheeks, it wouldn’t rush anywhere else).
He was less keen on the robes on display. They were the sort of clothes that were displayed without price tags that made Harry feel out of place.
Until that moment, Pansy had been listening in rapt attention, but as he said Potter’s name, her gaze drifted over Draco’s shoulder and her lips twisted. “That’s funny considering he also just appeared behind you,” she said.
“Easily the second one.”
“I just said
“No, but here — try this first.” Pansy pushed a crystal glass filled with a suspiciously pink liquid into his hand.
Draco finally caught sight of Potter speaking to the harsh woman with the low ponytail. He nodded seriously as she talked to him, but Draco could tell his attention was wandering. His eyes darted towards the line of Slytherins, and their eyes met for a moment. Draco imbued his stare with as much hatred as possible; Potter’s cheeks darkened, and he looked away.
Harry gaped at him, lost for words because of how unbelievably wrong Draco was. From his knees, he looked up at Harry, raising an eyebrow in a challenge. Their eyes met and Harry’s mind went blank: he’d known in an objective way that Malfoy was attractive. There was a certain magnetism that came from his unwavering confidence in school that always caught Harry’s attention, but that was normal.
“How are you?” he asked politely.
People started to take their seats around them and Maggie continued softly, “But it’s nice to see how many people cared about her too, you know? So many people loved her and she deserved to be loved.”
A car overtook a cyclist, swerving into the opposite lane and leading to a cacophony of screeching brakes, car horns, and unintelligible shouting from windows. Back in the present, Harry winced as Ginny covered her ears against the noise.
“You’ll stay here and get checked?” Potter asked.
Along with the uniform department, Harry had found himself on the cleaners’ bad sides — something to do with a small misunderstanding about whether a document was ‘
He smiled gratefully at her and pulled her into a tight hug. “I’ll see you on Monday. Curse free,” he promised.
A wave of vertigo hit him, so strong that it felt like he’d been clobbered on the back of the head by a mallet. His thoughts emptied from his brain, like a plug being pulled from a bath, and he slammed his hand against the glass divider separating the display of sandwiches from the public as he scrambled for support.
“Aw, it’s not so bad out here, don’t worry,” Harry murmured to Rose, rocking her gently.
A small bubble of hope rose in the back of his mind:
“It’s nothing,” he said. Ginny waited, taking a long sip of whiskey, watching him over the rim of the glass. He sighed. “I just wasn’t expecting it to be so soon. Being Head Auror… It’s a lot.”
“Oh, Malfoy. Hi.” Potter straightened, taking a hand out of his pocket to scratch the back of his neck.
“Yeah, yeah, you’re being a good Auror, you’re on the
“Sometimes I worry about what goes on in your head, you know.”
“I’m getting more sleep,” Harry said with a shrug. It was strictly true: Kingsley didn’t need to know that the sleep never happened for more than three hours at a time, so he stole it in many small increments throughout the day.
“I don’t know what’s going on,” he said.
The illustration in this chapter was created by
He liked the corner of the shop where Malfoy did the robe fittings, though. It had a different feel to the rest of the room: the dark wooden shelves soaked in the warm light from the wall sconces, creating a cosy atmosphere. The tall shelves acted like walls, blocking any prying eyes.
“It sounds like a love spell,” Draco said slowly.
“Draco?” Maggie called, her voice drifting through the doorway in the far corner.
He sprang back, his head jerking to where Ron stood in the doorway, holding Rose. He stared at them, dumbfounded. Rose’s small mouth was parted, and she was also looking at them with interest. Draco glared back defiantly.
Maggie’s face fell, clearly despairing. “You weren’t alone, were you?” she asked, heartbroken.
“We’ll continue this later,” she promised ominously as she went to open the door.
From the wall, the models in the illustrations and photos sneered at him and his lack of productivity.
With thirty minutes to go until midnight, the orchestra ditched the endless waltzes in favour of classic jigs and sing-a-longs to please the tipsy, twirling masses. The dinner tables covered in empty plates had long since been Vanished, leaving an open space in the middle of the room for dancing. Couples twirled at the centre of the floor, women’s skirts flaring and almost snarling around their partners’ legs, who deftly danced out of reach and then back. The other guests who weren’t brave or energetic enough mingled at the sides of the room and drank steadily.
who said ‘Potter’, not just me. Holy fuck!” he swore as Potter appeared at his elbow, still holding the baby.
Ron came back in and joined Hermione leaning against the bookshelves as Bill temporarily Vanished the coffee table, clearing a space for Harry and Draco in front of him. They trudged to the front like naughty school children being called in front of the Headteacher.
Seeing as he also refused to let anyone else help him finish the robes and would rather die than see Potter face-to-face, the only rational course of action he could think of was to finish the robes. When Potter came to pick them up, he’d simply hide in one of the Muggle washing machines.
Potter’s eyes narrowed. “So do I.”
In the Manor, Draco had accused Harry of following him and he
Draco hurriedly dropped the cloak and took a step back before anyone else noticed. Apparently the other Slytherins had grown bored with hovering by the escape route and decided to mingle. As he moved away from Harry, Pansy snorted and raised an eyebrow at him, clearly under the impression she was interrupting something lewd.
“Yeah?”
was perfectly happy to keep being whatever we were, but you clearly couldn’t
She stayed still for a long moment, watching him coolly. Eventually, she said, “Alright then.”
“Don’t be a pig, Blaise,” Pansy sneered.
The clock above the bed said it was nearly 5 o’clock. He hadn’t eaten since breakfast and his stomach was growling in protest. He folded his arms across his chest and pressed them into his belly, hoping it would stop the mutinous gurgles.
“Sure,” Harry said with a shrug.
A loud buzz rang through the shop as Draco pulled the heavy door open. Other than the small desk with an empty till and the floor-to-ceiling display of enormous metal boxes with circular glass doors, the shop was empty. He didn’t quite know how the metal boxes worked, but Maggie assured him they were what Muggles used to wash their clothes and were important for the guise of a Muggle dry cleaner.
There was a dandelion growing on his father’s grave. The flower had bloomed, leaving only the puff of feathery white seeds. Draco bent over to rip it from the ground and throw it over the fence. He didn’t worry about disturbing the body below: Azkaban hadn’t returned one, just a small urn.
“Well?” Draco asked sharply as the silence stretched into the next minute.
eager according to some) to forget the war and move on, Ginny refused to forget.
— “important.”
how he’s acting. I went years without seeing him face-to-face but now I’m walking into him every other day, it’s mental.”
“So, you won’t ambush me and tie me to Robard’s desk?”
a wonderful dream. Although the details had already slipped away, the warm contentment lingered, wrapping him in a tight embrace. He squeezed his eyes shut and forced his breathing to remain slow and steady, trying to trick his body back into the lull of sleep as he scoured his mind for any remnant of the dream.
And when he spent the next two weeks being shouted at by Ginny or judged by Mrs. Weasley, or called a lunatic by Ron, he just thought about how right it had felt to hold Draco in the rain.
Draco stiffened as Madam Malkin’s swivelled, her beady eyes flicking across his face.
“Why don’t you tell Robards you’re not ready?”
Any moment now, a letter would arrive from Pansy about her holiday in America, or from Theo about some luncheon or fete they were both going to. If he went to his desk, he’d find half-finished letters to Greg and Vincent about the new broom his father was going to buy him, how he’d leave Potter in the dust next year…
“Thanks,” he said.
we didn’t have any evidence, that the tips were bigoted nonsense.”
Something hardened in Potter’s eyes and he stood up straight, pushing away from the wall and marching up to Draco so there was barely an inch of space between them.
Dramatic arse.
“Sorry,” he mumbled.
?” he snarled.
“As long as no one else tries to talk to me for the rest of the evening,” Harry said darkly.
“Wow. I can’t even tell these were ripped,” he said sincerely. He strained to look over his shoulder and raise his eyebrows at Draco. “You did this?”
Potter unlocked the door and opened it a crack, checking who was there. “MLEP?” he asked and presumably received some kind of affirmative as he allowed two men dressed in Muggle clothes into the room.
saying my name?” Potter complained, taking a few steps back so there was some space between their bodies. “It’s uncomfortable.”
Kingsley paused, mulling over Harry’s words. “Why not?”
Harry shrugged as he bent over to tie the bag closed. “Dunno,” he said.
“Oh fuck. Do I
“I was going to ask if you wanted to lead the raid — I know you’ve been feeling chained to your desk with all the paperwork.”
“I don’t think we need to talk about it,” he said stiffly. “Everything can go back to normal.”
The alcohol thrummed in his veins, taking the hard edge off the world. Everything seemed a little fuzzier, and if he looked at anything for too long, it began to spin. He was clearly drunker than he’d realised.
“This is really nice, Ron,” Ginny said.
Curious.
Ginny groaned. “At this rate the England team’s going to be a little Gryffindor reunion.”
But he couldn’t do that. For once, this wasn’t about Potter, and Draco wouldn’t let him ruin Maggie’s final memories of her grandmother.
, look.”
She conjured two wine glasses and put them down on the coffee table. “Someone from your team owled to ask if you were with him because they’re worried that you’re having some kind of breakdown.”

sometimes, Harry,” she muttered loud enough that only Harry could hear.
“Not seeing each other,” Draco clarified, keeping his voice even as he stared at the poster.
“It’s okay. I’ve always been sad that I couldn’t give her a bigger funeral. She loved big parties, she would’ve wanted her funeral to be an extravagant event.”
“Have the cleaners officially given up in here?” he asked.
“Not even a glimpse?” she said, the disappointment clear.
ness but Potter didn’t budge. In fact, he had a blank expression like he wasn’t paying any attention to what Draco was saying. He blinked a couple of times and then shook his head.
In a prideful flourish, he signed his name in the bottom corner.
Carefully, like he was handling glass, he took the baby from Hermione’s arms. Rose grumbled at the movement, but she didn’t cry as he settled her into the crook of his arm, staring up at him silently with her little mouth partly open. As she settled, he remembered the first time he’d held Teddy. How he’d been so comfortable in Harry’s arms he’d fallen asleep, and Harry had been hit by a wave of grief that Remus and Tonks weren’t there that he’d started crying and couldn’t stop until Andromeda took her grandson back because Harry’s shoulders were shaking uncontrollably.
Draco glanced at the clock on the wall by the menus. Nearly one in the morning.
“I’ll get them at lunch,” Ambrose offered. “Everyone cough up some Sickles.”
“Great, thanks.” He glanced at the clock. 5 PM.
“Maybe he’ll mention us in one of his interviews — that would be amazing.”
He considered going to Ron and Hermione but it was late and he wouldn’t want to interrupt any of the precious little sleep they got. At least, that’s what he told himself as pulled the keys from his pocket. In reality, he wasn’t sure if he could face their adult married bliss, inadvertently pointing out all the ways Harry had failed. It wasn’t even that he hadn’t had the opportunity to do all those things: he could have married Ginny right after the war, or fought harder to keep her when things went sour. They could have had the kids and the house in the countryside, and he would have accepted this promotion because it would have provided the stability they needed. But at every opportunity, he chose the escape route.
“What were you saying?” he asked Draco, his voice pitched so low that Draco could feel it rumbling through his chest. He leaned in and pressed his lips to the shell of Draco’s ear. “Still think I’m having a crisis?”
“So, just to be clear, you don’t hate me?” he clarified.
“Well, I’m glad you’re
employee, that sounds terrible for business.”
“To get the bartender,” Draco repeated. Merlin, Muggles were
Potter winced, and Draco watched him take stock of the shop with fresh eyes. “Can I help?” he asked, gesturing towards the broom Millie had found.
“I watched you pour a potion all over a Muggle’s coat! I
“New robes, sir,” Harry said with an awkward smile.
Hot and disgruntled, he lay on top of the covers and stared up at the canopy of his four-poster bed. His father had ripped down the childish Quidditch posters years ago, but there were a few corners that had ripped and stayed stuck to the wood. Occasionally, remnants of the old Quidditch players would fly across that square and the blue sky would flash brown or gold.
With a grunt, he stopped for a moment and then continued, but at an erratic pace. Draco felt something warm splash against his thigh and he realised with a jolt that Potter had just come. He barely had time to think about how fucking hot it was before Harry began blowing him somehow even more enthusiastically before. He took Draco down his throat with apparent ease, his now-free hand gripping Draco’s thigh to keep himself steady.
As he left, he glanced at Draco, who was staring resolutely at the Apparition Safety posters, a glum look on his face. Harry ached to say something to him, but the words didn’t come and he could feel the Healer watching him waver. He shook the urge away and crossed the corridor to the other empty room they had been using to test the curse.
“I’m serious.” His eyes were steely and he stared at Draco.
“Nothing,” he snapped and then sighed. “I hooked up with someone.”
“I know,” Hermione sighed. “I need to find some time to go to the library.”
Harry grimaced. “I didn’t quit my job because of your magical dick powers, what’s wrong with you? I can’t believe you were just accusing
Harry wasn’t faring much better, but Draco heard him mumble, “I’m so close, Draco.”
Draco looked down as Harry reached up and rubbed his thumb across his stomach where Draco saw he hadn’t cleaned the come off himself. He blushed deeply. It had dried, leaving tacky white streaks on his skin.
“About?” he snapped.
What was the appropriate greeting for an ex who was still sort-of your best friend? A kiss on the cheek? A friendly arm slap? Nothing? Torn between the three choices, his hand hung in the air between them limply until Ginny looked concerned and he shoved it into his pocket.
today. Are we getting drunk or what?” Neville asked cheerfully, holding up his bottle of gin and everyone took the hint.
The door opened; the Healer marched in. He was a middle-aged man with a receding hairline and threads of grey in his beard, his green Healer’s robes swirling around his ankles.
“Does that sound familiar to
He shrugged. “I’ve had a change in priorities,” he said, and threw open the door. Feeling ten times lighter than he had when he entered, he strode back to his office, leaving Robards gaping at his back.
Maggie stood outside the gate to the graveyard. It was a beautiful day and the bright blue skies clashed with her puffy, bloodshot eyes and raw red nose. Like Draco, she was wearing traditional black funeral robes. It was the first time he’d seen her utterly devoid of colour (except for her lilac hair, but even there, her natural brunette colour was beginning to show at the roots). A little further into the graveyard, Draco could see a gathering of black-robed witches and wizards and a set of chairs laid out in rows on the other side of a large yew tree.
“Fuck, Draco,” Harry said, but not in a ‘
Malfoy scoffed.
He didn’t know whether Potter watched him, he didn’t dare look up.
Robards, but the man was incapable of asking Harry to do anything without Harry’s hackles raising in response.
“Sorry,” Malfoy said without a trace of remorse. He picked a pin out of the hovering pot and stuck it into the pinched fabric. “I didn’t say I judge people from their outfits.”
“I’ll tell Kreacher. He only made it because I mentioned I was going to see you, so he’ll be pleased.”
I’m going to have to make you an entire winter wardrobe that’ll keep you warm in
“I didn’t…” Potter didn’t or couldn’t finish whatever thought he was having. “I was looking for you.”
Around them, the dream’s scenery melted away like candle wax. Grass sprouted between the Entrance Hall’s flagstones and the walls crumbled, revealing the Great Lake. It was still sunny but warmer now, and Harry and Draco unfastened their fur-lined capes and spread them on the ground like picnic blankets. Draco reclined on the ground, his long legs stretching into the grass. Harry remained standing, blinking at the new surroundings.
“Well go on then, what are
“You said you and Harry Potter barely know each other!”
Draco sighed deeply. “How long is this going to take? It
“What? Harry was just
Harry didn’t speed up. Actually, he slowed down.
“No, she definitely won’t,” Harry said with a smile, thinking back to all the late nights at Ron and Hermione’s, listlessly listening to her lecture about brutish cast-first, think-later attitude of the Aurors. No wonder he’d fit in so well.
“I am
“So, if you could please hold hands…”
“I can’t believe you’ve drawn dicks on my dress robes.”
, I’ll eat my hat.”
Ron was happy enough to be distracted and he started telling Harry about the cursed mirrors and Harry put all his worries to the back of his mind for another day.
His eyebrows twitched upwards. “Oh. Why not?”
“Rolf’s going to search for yetis soon,” Luna said.
“Just wanted to say congrats. We heard about the promotion. Can’t wait to work under you,
you just
They scrubbed up well — even Greg. Draco surveyed his friends as they stood on the steps of 12 Grimmauld Place, the invitation with the address tucked into Draco’s pocket in case someone questioned their presence.
He was so wrapped up in the warmth of Harry’s body against his that he didn’t register the sound of footsteps until Ron started speaking to him.
“Oh, don’t be a baby — I’m not going to sell your nudes to the
yet. “You’ll need to show up to these kinds of events now — I’m not saying you have to go to
Harry scowled, but then had to replace it with a bright smile as Rose began to cry. He rocked her awkwardly, his elbows knocking against the overstuffed arms of Ron and Hermione’s cosy armchair. The pair sat opposite him on the couch, Hermione curled up in the corner with a steaming mug of tea and Ron lounging across the other two-thirds with his long limbs spread akimbo.
“Fuck,” Draco agreed weakly. “That was…” But he didn’t have words to say exactly what that was. Speechless, he kicked at the dressing gown until he saw his wand. “
But Harry didn’t immediately touch him like Draco expected. Instead, he hummed and laughed, a low, throaty chuckle. “Is
“Not sure that’s true,” Draco muttered but Pansy steamrolled over him.
“What the fuck?” Draco muttered, the apprehension draining from him like water down the drain. He dropped his wand and stalked to the door, yanking it open as Potter raised his fist to knock again. “What the fuck?” Draco repeated, louder.
“I still don’t see it,” he said, closing the door as he gestured at Harry.
They shook hands before Kinglsey Apparated straight from the kitchen, leaving Harry alone. The silence in the kitchen was unbearable and so he took Kinglsey’s advice and a handful of Floo Powder.
She shouldered her bag, and they did an awkward dance as they tried to settle on a farewell gesture, dancing from hug to cheek kiss to wave until they exchanged a weird thumbs-up crossed with a fist bump that was so awkward they both broke into hapless giggles.
“Are you making coffee?” Maggie asked apropos of nothing, looking up from her needlework. She was embroidering tiny flowers to the bottom of a white dress for a baby’s dousing ceremony; her work was beautifully delicate, which was surprising given the constant stream of curse words that had flowed from her lips for the past hour.
“Hm,” she huffed. “Well. One set of dress robes is a start, but I’ve had orders from at least twenty different wizards for the Recovery Ball.”
The anger had burned out, leaving Draco with a cold, empty space inside of him. “Go back to work. It’s clearly all you
“No, I’m fine,” he mumbled, ducking his head.
“I like Harry’s too. Especially the phalluses.”
He frowned at the set of robes in mismatching fabric (one of which looked suspiciously like a child’s princess bedsheets) and said dumbly, “We agreed on black?”
“Great,” Draco said sourly.
“Right,” Ron said, his voice faint. “Well. I’m going to put Rose down and. Um. Maybe have a lie down myself. Dad’s just finishing the burgers.”
They were harder to work with at first. Draco couldn’t ask the models to turn around to get an idea of how the material moved, or check how the back of a coat looked. There were no handy instructions on the back of the pages that listed the tailoring charms used. Instead, Draco found himself stealing ideas: the cut of a waistcoat, a high-waisted trouser, the length of an overcoat contrasted against a longer trouser leg, the flash of colour in a lining, the delicate lace trim on a cuff…
He kicked his door closed behind him and flopped into his chair, resting his elbows on the table and covering his face with his palms.
“What about the Muggles?”
As Draco took the coat from the woman, Harry noticed his collar was upturned and his hair was slightly rumpled from Harry’s desperate hands.
Parkinson turned to look at him fully and arched a brow. “Why?”
to do. So, I started thinking — making a list of all the things that made me happy. My friends helped, too...”
Robards’ forehead deepened into a frown, his eyes flicking from the file to Harry’s face.
“What the
She barely said hello to anyone in the room before barging over to Harry and sweeping Rose out of his arms, greeting the baby with a gentle murmur.
“Not that you gave them a choice when you failed all your OWLs and refused my job offer.”
“Shit.
On the new page in front of him, he began to sketch: a swooping, downward line, curving out into a sharp flared at the bottom — except, no, that wasn’t right. No one in their right mind would wear flared robes to a ball, they’d be the laughing stock of the party. He scribbled it out and started again.
“Am I doing all your hard work justice?” he asked cockily.
Draco snorted and shook his head. He was acting like a love-struck girl. What was wrong with him?
“Well, why then?”
want you to say, but as your friend… I’m glad to hear it.”
“What was what?”
gossip columns for months, and Maggie probably would have mentioned it. Was there a way Draco could bring it up without her reading
“What do you think they’re looking for?” she whispered.
“I wouldn’t have expected you to live in the city,” Draco said casually.
“I can imagine,” he said.
about you, there you are.”
They broke apart for a second, their panting breaths mingling in the inch of air between their mouths as they fumbled with the last of their clothes. Potter kicked off his trousers and those hideously kitsch Snitch underpants and Draco dropped to his knees in the middle of his work and took Potter’s cock into his mouth, slurping messily in his enthusiasm.
“Glad you liked them,” Harry said, smiling.
“I’ll go deal with that,” he volunteered.
Once she was gone, everyone slumped against the wall, the tension that had kept them upright seeping out. Draco couldn’t relax, though. He stalked to the wands and snatched them from the ground, clutching his so tightly he could feel the wood creaking.
“I didn’t notice the ticket had turned green,” he said apologetically as he walked up to the desk. There was a clothes rack behind the till and he could see what looked like Auror robes hanging up between the other garments. “Did you manage to fix them?”
?” Draco asked, outraged, as Potter grabbed his elbow and steered him towards a corner of the market that had been cleared for Healers to inspect the other unlucky bystanders.

“And I’m sorry about coming to the funeral so inappropriately.”
“Yeah, well, me neither, but I showed the woman the robes and she said she’d need to check with her colleague — then out walked Malfoy.”
“I’m sorry.”
Ron put his mug down on a coaster and headed over to the fireplace. “Doubt he’ll mind giving us his opinion at the very least,” he said as he took a pinch of Floo Powder and threw into the fire before sticking his head into the green flames. An awkward silence descended on the three of them as they waited for Ron to talk to Bill.
try to sell me out to Voldemort. Bit of a major detail,” Harry pointed out.
“Thanks,” Harry said.
“True, let’s clean this up and then get royally shitfaced,” Blaise said.
“Mum and Dad gave me the loan,” Maggie corrected.
“No funny business,” she warned before leaving the room.
He didn’t like to dwell on any of that. It led to him getting bogged down in introspection and sooner or later he wouldn’t be able to get out of bed. His old Mind Healer was all about Harry
“We made those robes in the first place so we had matching fabric
“What?” Harry snarled.
There was a bed in a corner and two cushioned chairs next to each other facing it. Potter snagged one as Draco stayed standing, inspecting the posters in the room that warned against the dangers of Apparition under the influence. It wasn’t particularly cheery reading for anyone unfortunate enough to be stuck in the hospital bed. Draco wrinkled his nose as he inspected a rather graphic diagram depicting a person pulled in half, straight down the middle.
“Hmm,” she muttered, clearly unconvinced, but she didn’t order him out. She stood to one side, holding the door open for Harry. “Call if you need anything, Hermione,” she said and shut the door before Harry could say goodbye.
They continued to face off, the silence stretching between them. Potter’s face was flushed and his hands were balled into fists as he shifted his weight from foot to foot. Draco resisted the urge to reach for his wand, keeping his head held high and his arms crossed over his chest. The indignation slowly began to trickle away and the silence became awkward but he refused to back down.
“Potter?” Draco said, looking over at the man in question. He could see the moment that his mind wandered, his head dipping an inch and then jerking back up like a person fighting sleep.
“Hogsmeade,” he said casually and took a long sip of coffee.
“I was just. Um. Coming to check on my robes.” He stuck his hands in his pockets and bounced a little on his tiptoes.
However, despite all of her many,
It was a rhetorical question — everyone knew the answer already. It was when he’d allowed himself to have an enormous error in judgement and develop a crush on Harry Potter.
Harry pulled a face. “It
there!”
“What do you want to do to me?” he asked, the words scratching his sore throat.
“Same,” the others agreed, yawning and gesturing to their drinks.
“Next
“And I have some good news,” Blaise announced. “They’ve finally finished the renovations at the Kensington flat, so I shall be moving in next month. Everyone keep the seventeenth of August free — we’ll have a little party.”
told Draco it was safe to move. Slowly he sat up, peeling cucumber slices off his Muggle jacket with a grimace. With dismay, he saw there was a long rip in the hem where it had gotten caught on a nail. He would need to go home to change. He glanced around the wreckage of the pickle stand and saw his focaccia had fallen out of its paper bag and was lying on the dirty cobbles.
Draco’s eyes fluttered closed and the image of Potter dropping to his knees came to the forefront again. “Fuck yes,” he sighed.
By the time it got to Neville’s McGonagall impersonation at his interview for a summer position as an assistant to Madam Sprout, Harry had finished half of Ginny’s bottle of wine and was feeling markedly more cheerful.
With his lips thinned in displeasure, Harry slipped the invite into the files on his lap and asked, “Is this everything, sir?”
Harry tilted his head down to inspect the stretch of embroidery in Draco’s hands.
He sighed and stabbed a pin into the hem of the shirt.
“Long week,” she said, yawning again. “But Mum and Dad are going to come stay with us this weekend, so it’ll be nice to have some extra pairs of hands to help with Rose. Ones that know what they’re doing.”
“Ugh, that’s a disgusting image. She’s over a hundred years old, have some respect for your elders.” She gave him a gentle shove.
“It’s an odd one but from what I can deduce, Harry’s name has somehow become some kind of Taboo for Draco so every time Draco says it, Harry has to go wherever he is.”
“I know you’re used to certain special treatment, but sometimes decisions don’t go your way and—”
Harry didn’t have the best memory of kisses. There was Cho in Fifth Year, of course. A memorable first kiss, but for all the wrong reasons. Otherwise, there was just Ginny. They’d had some pretty spectacular kisses during the war, but they quickly turned from passionate to perfunctory as the mundanity of adult life settled into every aspect of their relationship.
“No, that’s not— damn it, Draco, can you look at me?”
Harry left it. “Was this the first time you’ve seen him since the funeral?”
“Maybe you’re not a party person.”
“Well, it’s moot because I do want it.”
Draco dug his fingers into Harry’s waist, just above his hip bone where he was most ticklish. “Stop grousing, you aren’t having an
“Sure”
to that!”
“You’ll do.”
Other times, conscious of intruding on their private time, Harry would check his watch after dinner and make a comment about the late hour. He’d go back home and give his friends a moment of peace as he looked for similar odd jobs in his own house to keep him entertained. The problem was that small chores in the Little House turned out to be enormous projects in Grimmauld Place because of the years of neglect. He tried to clean out the blocked chimney but discovered a nest of baby birds that chirped angrily at him, so he gave up with that; he tried to clean the kitchen but quickly realised that the grimy layer wasn’t budging, even with the angriest cleaning spells thrown at it; he ventured up to Sirius’ room only to spend the afternoon sitting on the bed, tears streaming down his face, until Kreacher came to find him.
get rid of one but not the other. St. Mungo’s should be able to, though. Ask for a Healer who specialises in curses and an exvoco potion.”
“The normal response would be ‘Gosh, Draco, are you okay?’, not
“Give me just a moment, I might have something for this in the back,” Draco said, and Harry hurriedly retreated into the wizarding side of the shop. He still loitered close to the doorway so he could watch Draco as he closed the door behind him, hiding him from Muggle view. He went to a cabinet and retrieved a vial of purple liquid that he poured onto the stain, causing it to fade immediately.
“I’m not!” Potter said harshly, taking another step. They were basically inside the Manor at that point. The candles lit Potter’s face with their warm light.
She popped the olive into her mouth and smirked. “Good point. So, you were saying — Potter pulled you out of the vegetable stand like you were a damsel in distress?”
“Do you need something?” Harry asked. He was being rude, but he didn’t have the energy to care.
Robards chuckled. “Who else?”
,” she said.
“Hey, Harry. Come meet Rose.” She lifted the baby up slightly, readjusting the bundle delicately. From somewhere under the folds, something gurgled.
restaurant. No one had thought he would last more than a week, but (maybe because he and Vince had taken Muggle studies as a doss subject) he’d worked there for three months before becoming a bartender at the same place. Since then, he’d jumped from bar to bar — he explained he was working his way up from what the Muggles called
Sweaty and tired, Draco threw open the windows. The breeze curled around the room, rustling through the clothes. He left the window and the curtains open as he stripped off. It was too hot for modesty, and it wasn’t as if anyone would see.
“Yeah, sure,” she said and returned a moment later with one of the red-bound files that the Auror Department used for ongoing cases.
“Ah, can’t complain, I’ve certainly been worse.” He smiled. “I wouldn’t say no to a few hours more sleep, though. Thank you,” he said as Harry put the steaming cup in front of him.
The challenge shocked Harry. Lightning bolts of electricity shot from every point of contact between their bodies. Green met grey in the reflection again, and then Harry turned his head to look Malfoy in the eye. Their faces were millimetres apart: he stood on the pedestal behind Harry and they were the same height, he realised dimly. He could feel Malfoy's sweet, cool breath fanning across his lips as he exhaled.
Draco crossed his arms and pursed his lips. “You’re going to let months of my hard work go to waste?”
She pointed to the thin line of silver embroidery that ran around the hems and cuffs of the robes. Draco had let the self-stitching needle do the monotonous embroidery stem stitches with small leaf detailing, monitoring it to make sure it kept to the same pattern and didn’t add any swear words. He grabbed the lapel and pulled it (and, by extension, Harry) up to his face. Sure enough, what he’d thought were leaves were definitely miniature penises.
“I think it’s the eyes,” he said. The man had a certain spark of madness in his thousand-yard stare.
“Not for a few more years. I suppose I don’t feel particularly prepared.”
Shocked at the tone, he twisted so quickly that his neck twinged in protest. Pansy Parkinson stood in the doorway, arms folded over her nursing robes as she glared at him.
“I can’t remember, Maggie! He told me to get checked over by the Healers.”
Hermione opened her mouth, but the answer came from the doorway behind him, where Ginny was trotting down the steps.
It didn’t last long, and within a few seconds he’d schooled his face back into his usual holier-than-thou expression.
“I notice Draco didn’t defend himself.”
“What?” he asked.
“Alright?” Harry greeted with a wide smile.
He spotted the Snitch in under a minute, glittering in the sunlight behind the tallest of the hoops. With no one breathing down the back of his neck, it was almost too easy to chase it. He surged forward, his robes snapping in the wind behind him. He pulled his elbows closer to avoid knocking them on the metal hoop as he threaded the needle and caught the snitch.
“I hadn’t thought much about it to be honest,” he said.
“Can it be reversed?” Potter asked.
“And you thought of that, what? Two weeks
Draco mocked. “He’s always got to be righteous, doesn’t he?”
“Oh, we’re that boring, are we? Charming,” Pansy said.
“See you tomorrow,” he sighed as he cleaned up his desk with a quick cleaning spell.
He watched a man in the sewing room pull every garment from their hangers, shake them carelessly and then dump them onto the floor in a haphazard pile. Pins skittered across the floor, disappearing under furniture like frightened mice.
“Hello Rose,” Harry whispered, and had to blink rapidly to stem the pooling of tears. He reached out to stroke his index finger across her cheek: so small and soft as silk. “She’s beautiful,” he said, looking up at his friends, who were both staring at their daughter with beaming pride.
week for you to draft one letter.” She continued when Draco ignored her. “How about this: you do the accounts for me and I’ll write to Harry Potter for you?”
“No, it’s not, it’s something. You’re judging me.”
Theo was in the middle of telling the other Slytherins about the events in the bathroom when Draco returned. He took a large gulp of wine as Theo described Naismith being dragged away by MLEP.
Dressed and with several metres of space between them, they stared at each other. Potter’s lips were swollen and pink, and his hair was even messier than usual. Draco could feel the beard rash on his cheeks and knew there would be dark bruises on his neck and collarbone already. He watched Harry’s eyes track down the marks he’d left and definitely didn’t imagine the satisfaction in his eyes.
Despite the dearth of work, Maggie was still sewing when Draco packed up for the day — a testament to her poor timekeeping. As soon as the clock struck six, he stood and stretched — relief flooding through him after a long day of sitting. He waved goodbye and, for his personal amusement, lent Maggie his self-stitching needle that continued to develop an impressive vocabulary of swear words from somewhere.
Bill shrugged. “Glad to be of service. And it only took ten minutes — I can still get back in time for bedtime stories. Unless you need anything else?” He glanced at Harry and then Draco, both of whom shook their heads.
He tipped his head back and stared at the ceiling as he sucked his teeth.
Hermione shook her head. “Nothing.”
in the last two weeks, creating a superstition between the two of them that if they dared call it anything else, Potter would call up the shop and cancel the order.
“But the clothes you wear affect what kind of person people think you are,” Malfoy argued. “They’ll notice your old baggy robes and think less of you.”
happen again, you should report it.”
Ron patted his shoulder. “Sure thing, mate. Can someone hand me the entire pan of that hangover potion?”
Harry ran his hand through his hair, messing it up even further, and looked around Draco’s corner. His eyes lingered on the robes hanging on the dressmaker forms. He sighed and met Draco’s gaze, shaking his head in exasperation.
“No need to sound so surprised.”
Due to the patchy layout of public fireplaces connected to the Floo Network in London, he got to Hyde Park an hour later than their agreed time, sweaty and irritable after the long walk from the Leaky Cauldron. A picnic in the park had been Pansy’s idea. Draco had sulked about sunburn until she promised they could sit in the shade of a tree and told him to stop being a crybaby, at which point he relented for the sake of his pride.
had been a good job.
Harry’s mouth fell open, and he had to force it shut consciously, his lips thinning out into a tight frown as Ginny grabbed a handful of Floo Powder and gave him a jaunty, casual salute as she disappeared in a whirl of green flames. Kreacher retreated, muttering under his breath and leaving Harry alone in the living room, staring at the fire.
She blinked at him like he was a few brain cells short of sentient life. “The funeral? When you didn’t show up to our
“You have to tell me everything!” she said, pulling a chair from one of the other sewing tables and sitting on it backward, resting her elbows on the backrest and putting her chin in her hands.
“I think we were maybe a
“Come on,” Draco said. “There’s a pint with your name on.”
,” he said, looking up from his sewing needle, affronted. “Need I remind you of the time I saved you from that awful date by being the world’s most convincing jealous ex-boyfriend? I came up with that on the spot and you said yourself that I could have won a Witch Weekly award for acting. What was that guy’s name again?”
“No, it’s the fact you clearly put no effort into any of your outfits and have no style to speak of.”
Below, the Manor’s grounds spread out like a map. His mother’s gardens were almost unrecognisable: weeds had completely taken over the once-manicured flower beds and the lawns were waist-height, undulating beneath him like the sea. The paving stones that led from the Manor to the lower lawns were barely visible amongst the tall grass. Occasionally Draco caught glimpses of grey between the green, and he followed them like a connect-the-dots game down from the back door, past the pond which had been taken over by territorial geese that honked menacingly whenever he got within fifty feet, to the small fenced cemetery at the tree line.
She ignored him. “Is one of those for me?” she asked and clapped her hands gratefully as Draco handed her a coffee, as well as the paper he was carrying under his arm — carefully folded so Muggles on the street wouldn’t notice the moving photos.
“I don’t know, Malfoy! I’ve been awake for three minutes — I opened my eyes and it was like I was on autopilot and I Apparated here. Wherever
“Ah, yeah, it’s not too bad.” He ran his fingers over his cheeks, the day’s stubble catching on the calluses on his palms. He didn’t want to talk about work, but they were still on the fourth floor, so he latched onto another topic. “How’s Malfoy?”
“Shame he didn’t pick up any of her cleaning habits,” Hermione teased.
“I made the executive decision that you need to talk to someone.”
like a love spell. I’ve found a few mentions of curses that pull two people close to one another or cause serious pain if a couple isn’t touching, but they always affect both people in the same way. There’s an old love spell in wandlore that floods rooms when someone’s asleep until they admit their true feelings, but the theory just doesn’t match what Harry’s described. You haven’t experienced the same urge to find Harry, have you?”
“No problem. Um.” He didn’t leave, just lingered awkwardly and looked between Theo and Draco like he wasn’t sure what to say. “Malfoy, can we?” He jerked his head towards the door.
“Um, what the
“Thanks for the flowers. They were beautiful,” she said.
Plus, they hadn’t had a customer buy more than a set of shoelaces all week. Potter would be wearing these robes to the largest event of the summer season; the War Recovery Ball got
“Auror raid?” she said, her eyes lighting up in anticipation. “What happened?” she asked, leaning closer.
It had been quiet, even for a Wednesday. They hadn’t received any new orders in weeks, and without a steady flow of customers to see to, Draco listlessly sketched ideas for robes that he didn’t have the fabric to make as he watched the seconds tick away.
He crossed back over to his desk and the drafts of Potter’s robes, putting his coffee on a coaster. He didn’t sit, though; instead, he crossed his arms across his chest and said to Madam Malkin, “Shall I call the Knight Bus for you, or did you walk here?”
“You, McLaggen, and?” He trailed off into a question.
A massive fucking problem.
“Gerald’s been in the bog all afternoon,” Belinda clucked sympathetically as she buckled her leather arm bracers to her forearm — part of the standard raid uniform. Her wand holster was hanging from her belt. Following Harry’s line of attention, she asked, “You coming later? We’ll need someone to replace him at this rate and we’re already a man down with Ron on paternity leave.”
He panted, breathless with lust. Harry’s hands slipped from his wrists down to his forearm. Draco glanced up, arching his back to look at the pillow behind his head and saw his palm covering the long-dormant tattoo.
“No,” he snapped.
“I don’t even know where to start. Work is… I love it when there is work, but we hardly get any customers. I can’t imagine we’ll still be open by Christmas and then I don’t know what I’ll do. Maybe it’s a good thing. I should start looking for a proper job.”
“I walked into the room and you immediately started yelling at me!” Harry argued, his face reddening. “God, I just wanted to say that I miss you but never
Ambrose shrugged. “If you think so. We’re lucky that we have this job to fall back on, eh? Who needs children when you’ve got Auror work.”
Mercifully, Maggie didn’t know the extent of Draco’s involvement with Potter. She knew that they’d been at Hogwarts together and they knew of each other, but whereas Potter’s name was written in textbooks, Draco Malfoy was slowly fading into obscurity which was… fine.
Draco turned away angrily and pulled his wand from his pocket. “
“Your loss,” she said, taking a large swig of the concoction and humming happily.
Draco mimicked the movement with his finger and gasped, his toes curling into the sheets, the duvet ensnaring his feet. He kept his eyes closed and brought his hand to his mouth, licking broad strokes across his palm before wrapping his fingers around his cock. He squeezed gently and shuddered, biting his lip out of habit to muffle the cry before remembering he was alone and didn’t need to worry about being overheard.
Hannah chose a bush of purple flowers, swarming with butterflies. “A single petal would make your stomach rupture inside of you.”
“I’m good too. Thanks for asking,” he said as the silence stretched on. “I sent an enquiry to MLEP about what happened to Naismith — the guy from the bathroom.”
As she spoke, Ginny strode over to the drinks cabinet and rummaged through the rows of half-empty bottles that Harry only touched when he had guests over and pulled out a sealed bottle of whiskey Seamus had given him as a birthday gift last year.
Harry laughed. He’d meant to sound casual, but the sound came off as slightly strained. “Well, I’m the godfather, and I don’t mind spending time with Rose. Plus, I have lots of other friends who don’t have children.”
,” he cried, the word stretching into two syllables. He stopped holding back, his hips bucking up into the tight warmth of his fist.
“You’ve barely left this room for three weeks! You were here on Sunday. We don’t open on Sundays!”
“Bloody hell, we’ve walked into the Gryffindor common room,” Theo muttered.
“No, I didn’t touch him until—”
“That’s only because you see their faces in the
Harry shrugged. “Maybe sometimes, but I’m done with the rest of this shit.”
It was an excellent question and it was a shame that Harry didn’t have a satisfactory answer, or any answer for that matter. He cast around for any normal reason he could give that wasn’t ‘I’m having a minor mental breakdown.’ Malfoy frowned at him, his lip curling into his customary sneer.
Eventually, he said, “I’m obviously not following you.”
For once, the silence of the shop was a blessing. Draco was in no mood to deal with a customer at that moment.
She was wearing casual clothes: a loose light blue t-shirt and baggy grey jogging bottoms, her England kit bag slung over her shoulder and her hair tied into a ponytail. She’d clearly come straight from practice. Her cheeks were still pink, flushed from the chill wind in Yorkshire where the England team trained.

“Something the matter, sir?”
Bill’s head jerked up, and he flicked a strand of hair behind his ear with practised ease. Draco realised Bill was
“What’s this then? Some kind of breakdown because we almost got caught kissing?”
a love curse,” Draco said at the same time as Harry said, “It’s just a normal curse, actually.”
“Well, of course,” Draco said with a shrug. “That’s the only reason anyone goes to one of those types of events.”
“I was doing the right thing,” he said bluntly, and then Apparated away before Draco could get the last word in.
“But Draco, you managed to fix that wedding dress last year even though the skirt was half gone,” she pointed out.
“Come on,” she said, falling on the couch with the whiskey tucked under her arm and a glass in each hand. Harry followed reluctantly. He sat at the other end of the three-person sofa, his feet planted solidly on the floor. There was no curling up around each other like Ron and Hermione: the distance between them was respectful and insurmountable. Ginny poured a dram into each of the glasses and deftly pushed his glass so it skidded down the coffee table, coming to a stop in front of him.
preferred it when I didn’t have to look at your face, trust me.”
Draco held his gaze and deliberately spread his legs. He watched Harry’s Adam's apple bob in his throat as he swallowed.
They both blinked at her.
So, he let Potter lean into him, his hands roving across Draco’s body, and ignored the discomfort of the position and the breeze from the open front door. He widened his stance, dropping an inch so he was the same height as Harry, who was now firmly between his legs.
“Hello,” he said, waving awkwardly.
Harry hummed and wandered over to the window. “I don’t mind it here. It was convenient for work, you know? I could easily apparate. Plus, I know people in London.”
“Who needs those when you have cleaning
“Visiting hours are over,” said a strict, authoritative voice.
“You sound like Dumbledore.”
works but we can use any colour fabric so that doesn’t particularly matter. I was more looking for what styles you like.”
Potter glared at him. He’d changed outfits into casual clothes, a long-sleeved top and some Muggle jogging trousers. They didn’t fit him properly. The sleeves were too short and went halfway up his forearms when he crossed his arms, and-
He shrugged. “She thinks I’m funny.”
Potter’s jaw clenched, his eyes glittering with fury. “
behaviour?” Draco repeated, outraged, as Harry cackled.
Unfortunately, the garden was now devoid of weeds and there was nothing else Harry could think of doing. Except the one chore he’d been putting off for weeks: job hunting.
“Vigilante justice is illegal. There’s a system for a reason and that system said the men in this room are innocent, you don’t change that by assaulting them in public,” Potter said and then casually cast a Patronus, as if it was as simple as a Levitation Charm, and spoke to the great silver stag that burst from the tip of his wand.
He rolled his eyes and said, “I’m
When he glanced over his shoulder, he saw Harry’s glasses glint in the sun. He couldn’t tell if he was looking at Draco or if it was a trick of the light.
Kreacher was nowhere to be found, which Harry was grateful for. He didn’t want anyone fussing over him now. He didn’t bother warming up the leftover pizza from the fridge, just chucked it on a plate and then headed up to the living room. He lit a fire in the grate and flicked his wand at the gramophone so he wouldn’t be sitting in silence.
There were
He stormed to the front of the shop and checked that, yep, Maggie had definitely flicked the sign to
“Maybe he went to the bar?” he suggested. They all looked at the still mostly-full pint by his empty chair uneasily.
“I’ll take that as approval,” Malfoy whispered.
“Right, I’ve got what I need,” he said, flinging the tape measure back into the drawer as if it had personally wronged him. In a rush, he grabbed the parchment and said, “I’ll owl you the designs when I’m done. Goodbye Potter,” as he made a tactical retreat (
Draco cleared his throat. “Quite.”
He should probably owl Maggie and tell her what had happened, so that she had some warning instead of turning up tomorrow to see the wreckage of her pride and joy. His heart lurched as he imagined her reaction. She spent all her time and money on this little shop and now it was in tatters, because she’d hired the wrong person. Maybe she would fire him: it’d only be right, considering this was his fault.
He opened his eyes and found Harry staring at him, his green eyes boring into Draco’s with unconcealed lust. Their mouths collided, opening immediately as Harry’s tongue licked into his mouth. The moldings on the wall dug uncomfortably into Draco’s back, but he didn’t want to suggest they move anywhere else and risk breaking this fragile accord. The hallway was a liminal space. He didn’t know how Potter would react to being invited back into Draco’s bed, where this would turn from an impulse to a decision.
“Sure,” he said. She squeezed his hand.
It still took two days, but they were less frustrating days than the previous fourteen because now when Draco drew, he could
“Nothing wrong with looking,” Blaise said. “If it was a group of shirtless Muggle men, you’d all be leering as well.”
Kingsley laughed, the deep, rich sound putting Harry at ease. “No, I’ll leave you be. I might tell Robards I tried, though, just to calm him down.”
“Does he?” Ron said, frowning as he went to stand next to Belinda. Harry crossed his arms over his chest and shifted his weight from foot to foot, looking uncertainly between the two. Ron’s lip curled in bemusement, and he squinted at Harry. “Looks like he usually does to me.”
“An excuse,” Blaise muttered blackly from the end of the row. Draco glanced over and saw his expression matched his tone: he watched the Aurors work with undisguised disgust. He noticed Draco looking at him over Millie’s head and his face softened slightly into a pitying frown. “They’ll never leave us alone,” he said.
the come from his stomach? He hoped desperately that there weren’t any incriminating stains, though he probably wasn’t so lucky, as satin was a notoriously unforgiving fabric.
that it’s the pinnacle of wizarding formality. Come with me.” Draco led him over to the back corner of the shop which was a step higher than the rest of the floor where they kept their dress robes.
Taking the file with him, he marched over to Robards’ office, ignoring the wave of silence that swept over the others, watching him from the corner of their eyes as he barged into the Head Auror’s office without knocking.
“Don’t worry, you look like the same-old prat to me,” Ron said and Harry threw an empty inkwell at him. Ron dodged it easily. “What did Robards want?”
“One of your Death Eater friends?” the man sneered.
He looked up to see Potter approaching him, full Auror-mode, his red cape snapping behind him with definitive authority. He could tell the moment he recognised Draco lying amongst the vinegared vegetables; for a second, the professional façade disintegrated, leaving Potter looking a lot more like a twenty-six year old than an experienced Auror, but then he snapped back to the job at hand.
“About what?”
He wasn’t quite ready to talk about the Head Auror news with anyone else yet, especially not Ron. Not that he thought anyone would be particularly surprised. But, while it wasn’t a secret to anyone that Harry would be Head Auror one day, he wasn’t ready for the stories about how he was the youngest Head Auror in centuries and all the congratulations from his co-workers who had also fought in the war and had years of experience on him. And he was always wary sharing these kinds of things with Ron, even though his friend had assured him that Harry’s success didn’t bother him any more like it had when they were children.
Harry moaned around his dick, the vibrations making Draco’s toes curl against the cold marble tiles.
“I’ll tell you another time — it’s not a big deal, remember?”
“Everywhere I go,
“Understood, sir.”
“Sure. MLEP’ll contact you if they have follow up questions but I guess you can go—”
As he sat down, Blaise asked loudly, “Are you feeling okay, Draco? That was a very long bathroom break.”
, it seemed like a bit much of an oversimplification. Parkinson had the same casual attitude as Malfoy towards the fight, clearly in agreement that it was no big deal. He thought of Malfoy’s stormy eyes glittering with rage when he’d walked into the bathroom that night and wondered how he’d kept it under control, keeping his wand hidden in his pocket out of sight of Muggles. He suspected it was related to the resignation in his voice when Harry had confronted him afterwards.
“Maybe you can convince him to come to this thing next year instead of me.”
“Surely we have something to match the Ministry uniform?” She blinked at him innocently.
Had he seriously been

Draco glanced around the silent shop, thinking of the empty till, but didn’t say anything. They fell quiet for a while and Draco cast around for something, anything, to do and came up short. Maggie’s quill hovered above the newspaper, her forehead creased into a frown.
“Sure,” Harry ground out. “I should get back to my desk.”
side so it’s totally fine to follow orders without questioning them. Doesn’t mean that I give a shit,” he said.
Someone paused by the door, interrupting his train of thought. He watched their blurred shape through the glass, hovering with a hand raised, poised and ready to knock. They hesitated and lowered their hand. Annoyed, he marched over and yanked it open, causing a startled Ambrose to jump back.
“Are you okay? What hit you?” Potter asked. He was still holding onto Draco and he pulled him closer as he interrogated him, his eyes flicking all over Draco’s body for some sort of injury.
“I…” What was his point? The ticket was still in his hand and he held it up lamely. “I wanted to see the robes.”
Apparently not content with stalking Draco, Potter had also taken over his every waking thought. No matter what he tried to take his mind off the fitting, all he could feel under his fingers was Potter’s body; every time he blinked, he saw those intense emerald eyes staring back at him in a challenge. As an additional punishment, at frequent intervals, he would remember how Potter had literally fallen into Draco’s arms.

actually save us.”
Everyone leant forward to read their total and started digging around in their bags and pockets. Draco spun the receipt towards him, his stomach curling into an anxious knot, conscious of how light his wallet was.
“Come in,” he called. Belinda appeared with a stack of owl-delivered mail that the front desk had collected.
“Ambrose did too,” Harry pointed out.
From a drawer in his desk, he pulled out a stack of files that was so comically large that Harry was sure he was joking. But Robards didn’t join in with his small chuckle and the mirth quickly died. He took another look at the files with dread.
And that was a whole other issue to worry about: why on
“Yes,” he said, disgust laced through the word. His voice was so deep, Harry could almost feel it vibrating through the table. “I’m spearheading the campaign to find out how it was approved.”
“Pressing up against me in the middle of the night in an empty room?” he asked softly. “
“Harry,” she said slowly, “that is
Luna added, “Russia has granted The Quibbler permission to go to Siberia in two months to finish my research for my article about selkies in Lake Baikal and I need an assistant to help me with all the gear.

Draco snorted. “It’s been a weird day.”
that they could have pinned on you, they’d have arrested you on the spot, but clearly even the Aurors couldn’t think of a way you were using thimbles for some evil Death Eater plan.”
“It’s a pretty complex spell, but not very well put-together,” Bill said with a shrug. “You said the guy probably did it in a panic? It shows.”
Filled with a jittery, anxious energy that kept him from being able to sit for more than a minute, he grabbed his broomstick, Summoned his flying coat, gloves, and goggles, and headed out to the garden.
She didn’t take the immediate dismissal. “I’ll wait until Margaret comes back.”
“Okay…” Hermione said slowly, turning her back on him as she cracked two eggs into a sizzling pan. Harry took another slow sip of the hangover potion. It had a faint woody scent that was familiar, but he couldn’t place it. “Well, what about—”
“Maggie already sold you out. She said you’ve been sulking.”
Malfoy didn’t appear perturbed by their close contact. Harry supposed it was normal for him, given this was his job. After all, it wasn’t as if Harry freaked out when he was frisking a suspect. (Then again, his suspects tended to be murderers, not old school acquaintances.)
There were rambunctious cheers from the assembled squad as Harry came out of his office, shrugging into his outer cape and buckling up his arm bracers, pulling the strap tight with his teeth.
“To be fair to the man, you did order robes from him and you’ve gone to his shop every other week for a month,” Ron said.
performing a public service!”
“I’ve got work…” Draco muttered again, already knowing he would lose that fight — and it wasn’t one he particularly wanted to win.
“Maybe that’s a conversation for another night,” McGonagall said, her eyes twinkling. “I actually came over to talk about your application.”
,” the man gasped. “I was— It’s— Let me say, it’s an
“So, any progress with the case?” Ron asked as he picked up their plates and slapped great spoonfuls of pie onto each one.
“…Pardon?”
Ambrose waved his hand. “Oh, you know what I mean, when all your friends start having children and they prioritise early nights over pub trips.”
“Oh, hey, Ron,” Harry said. He hadn’t moved from the wall and didn’t appear to be particularly perturbed by the interruption.
“Yeah. Thanks, Potter.” Theo’s voice was nasal and his hand flew to his face to try and stem the steady flow of blood from his nose. Draco tossed him one of his spare handkerchiefs.
“Fuck,” Harry said, his voice hoarse.
He stood and pulled Harry against him, his arms wrapping around his shoulders as they kissed. His legs were weak, and it was only Harry’s hand on the small of his back that kept him upright.
George looked baffled.
“Oh, good, the peanut gallery’s here,” he said.
,” Draco defended.
“Yes,” Mr. Malkin said, his voice clipped with disapproval.
“What are you talking about, Margaret?” Madam Malkin snapped, and Maggie wilted further, dumping the robes onto a spare table. “That’s no way to treat your inventory,” Madam Malkin said.
Do you realise how much work that is?” It wasn’t actually that much work, given that Draco had started on the project the day after Harry had floated the idea of applying.
“You’re wasting your breath. I came to that conclusion two years ago,” she snorted.
“Okay.”
to leave.
Harry tensed. “What about them?”
of a plonker but I can’t do anything about the natural state of what I’m working with.”
“Obviously you look nice, you always do!” Millie hastened to add. “But you don’t want to look raggedy.” She wrinkled her nose.
“It’s nothing.”
It was blessedly cooler in Wiltshire and he peeled off his top, letting the sweat evaporate from his chest.
McGonagall levelled him with a steady stare, and the three of them stood silently for a long moment. The seconds ticked by and Draco counted,
“I believe so! Why don’t you just pop into the room across the hall again and we’ll check to see that it’s all back to normal.”
“Oh, oh, please can I tell him?” Millie asked as Pansy got up to let him in. Millie called after her, “Pans, don’t say anything yet!”
“The Little House. Try not to track ash onto the carpet, it always annoys them.”
“Like this?” Harry asked, sliding his hand to the base of Draco’s cock.
“Putting them in a bag so that you can take them and leave,” Draco said, summoning a paper bag with a large black ‘M’ printed on the front.
Hermione sighed. “It’s getting better, thank God. But there are still some nights where she just won’t settle.”
working — it was even stranger than finding him in the wreckage of Underborough Market.
“Oh,” Harry said. “Um, what did you think?”
“A Barbie — it’s a toy, girls have them,” he said, then sighed and shook his head. “It doesn’t matter, it’s a Muggle thing.”
At least he was finally feeling more like himself. When he’d come back from the last attempt at apologising to Draco, his head ached like he’d thrown it in a blender and he could hardly stand up because of the waves of dizziness that constantly crashed over him. Maybe it was the many Apparitions in such a brief space of time; Apparating often made his brain feel like it was going to fall out of his ears, and he’d done it four times in a row to talk to Draco.
Robards nodded. “Listen Harry,” he said in a fatherly way that made Harry want to hit something, “as Head Auror, sometimes you’ll have to lead on things that you’re not a hundred percent sure about but it’s important that you
In other words: a total waste of time.
Potter frowned, the wrinkles in his forehead so deep they appeared to be carved from granite.
“Dinner’ll be ready soon,” Harry agreed. “Unless it’s already happened.”
Maggie squeezed his hand, and he was back in the sunny graveyard.
So Draco didn’t think twice about that as he held the finished design out at arm’s length, running a critical eye over every line looking for a flaw, but finding none. They were so familiar to him now that he hardly even needed to look at the page. He was sure he could draw it again blindfolded.
“With respect, sir, don’t waste your breath. There’s nothing you can say that’ll change my mind.”
“Come on, let’s celebrate, Harry,” he murmured and walked towards the exit. And this time, Harry didn’t need a curse to follow him home.
He flew until his back throbbed and his hands were so sore and cold he could barely grip the handle. Then he turned back south and bent down close to the handle, flattening himself out, urging the broom forward — faster and faster.
He forced a smile, though, putting up the facade in which the Malfoys weren’t destitute and his current pauper lifestyle was a choice.
“Yeah but you definitely have some kind of history…” Maggie said and suddenly there was a suggestive grin playing at the corners of her lips. When Draco looked up at her, she waggled her eyebrows.
“There’s definitely something different about you today,” he said. “Are you wearing makeup?”
“Oh shit,” he swore loudly when he noticed the green bit of paper tucked into the empty driving license section of his wallet. The mum in front of him in the queue turned to glare at him.
