It was no surprise that Potter had been the one to teach Scorpius such disgusting manners, for a Malfoy trait it was not. Without so much as a second glance, Draco took hold of Scorpius’ waist lifting them both from the ground so that the child sat comfortably on his hip.
The scorching hot water burned his skin, as he ferociously scrubbed his hands. He didn’t care, they deserved to burn anyhow. Perhaps if he worked at it hard enough, the blood that stained his skin would wash right out.
Smith gave him a small smile, looking at the ground which apparently was of great interest to him. ‘I was wondering if… maybe… you’d want to dance?’ he stammered out shyly, ‘with me,’ he added as an afterthought.
He reverted his gaze back onto Scorpius who was now joyfully sucking his thumb and waiting for his next instruction.
Sighing, Draco picked up a napkin gently wiping away the boy’s tears. After he had calmed down, Draco gestured towards the untouched plate, ‘eat your food, Scorpius,’ he ordered him lightly.
A few minutes of caught up in his own head, and Draco decided that he needed to pick up the pace, he was going to be late for his class. He kept his head down, as he collided with something firm and tall. The impact sending him stomach-first to the ground, his books sprawled beneath him.
long have you been hiding this? If you father had ever found out that you’ve been putting it up since the age of…’
The atmosphere grew tenser if that were at all possible, as Potter put his wand back into his pocket. Draco sighed out a breath he hadn’t realised he’d been holding in.
No, Draco had replied, and by doing that he’d opened up a can of worms. Now, they’d had a conversation. A
‘Yes, yes Weasley the world is coming to an end,’ he mumbled out distractedly, ‘Granger,’ he sent a curt not her way.
Potter did make an appearance, he wouldn’t look twice at Draco. No, Potter was friends with everyone. He was charming, funny, accepting, and the world just gravitated towards him. Why on earth would he talk to Draco of
about it Malfoy. Soup is liquid based, so is cereal. Soup has many solid substances, so does cereal. You eat soup with a spoon, guess bloody what?’ he asked with a passion that Draco found disgustingly adorable.
would be. Because things just didn’t work like that. Potter was the Saviour of the Wizarding World, people bowed at his feet. He was all perfection and laughs, and Draco, well… he was nothing but a choice he had made long ago. He gulped as he pulled on his sleeve, covering the Dark Mark further.
Draco narrowed his eyes at him, like hell was he going to win this game. Draco had bloody created the damn game!
‘Follow me.’ He told the small boy. Draco turned and went about eight feet before he heard a small thud. Groaning inwardly, he turned around and saw that the boy had face planted. He brought a hand up to his nose, only to pull it away bloody. Draco, braced himself, expecting terrified screams. He had been absolutely petrified at the sight of blood when we were younger, he thought it mandatory for any young kid to be.
So, Draco was pretty happy to be alone. To not care all that much. Because caring… caring got you hurt.
‘You’ve had a whole bloody day to get used to it,’ he pointed his wand in between Draco’s eyes, ‘I’ve had one hour.
McGonagall collapsed on a chair that appeared with a small pop, ‘that means that…’ she trailed off looking green. ‘Great Merlin,’ she repeated breathlessly. ‘But… Mr Malfoy’s only eighteen now, so that must mean that…. No, it’s not possible.’
Stubborn little bugger! He rolled his eyes, but nodded his head nevertheless, ‘would you please show
‘You’re no fun.’ Potter whined as he started to wiggle out of his grip, Draco just held on tighter, ‘lemme go. I haft to go’ he slurred out.
He nodded, ‘you aft to pwomise that you’ll always be dere to wayke me up,’ he announced with assertion, and Draco knew that he couldn’t deny him.
‘What? You mean just like you do?’ he asked and Draco flushed. Did this mean that Potter knew his nightly plans?
Keeping silent for the majority of the journey was a bigger challenged than he’d expected it to be, this was primarily due to the fact that Potter breathed like an ogre.
What rolled from his tongue next were four words that he’d never imagined himself to say, ‘take me to him,’ he whispered confidently.
He allowed his gaze to flicker onto Potter, he was running a dazed hand through raven locks, blinking rapidly as if it were all but a dream. Potter looked down at the small boy, hesitantly extending a hand and running it through messy hair. Something within him snapped at the gesture and he turned to face the boy on the other end of Potter’s simple touch.
So, that was that. Draco x muggle appliances give me life! Also, Draco Lucius Malfoy is a petty queen and I'm here for it. I've been sick for the past two days, still am, so I apologise if this chapter isn't my best.
Blaise shrieked covering up his crotch, ‘fine, I relent, I relent,’ he sighed out dramatically. ‘But seriously Draco you’re an unbelievingly good-looking dude, why are you wasting all your time mooning over Potter?’ he asked honestly.
His heart sunk. And that is why any form of relationship wouldn’t work between the two of them. It was very simple really; Potter just didn’t get him. Draco was mean, he was snarky and sarcastic, and Potter didn’t understand that. Draco didn’t even think that he liked that.
‘Fine,’ he conceded and Scorpius looked extremely proud of himself. In fact, his grey eyes sparkled just as his once had whenever he’d gotten one over his father. ‘What do you want?’
. He’d originally carried out his task with pride, he thought that he was helping his father. Then the Dark Lord had threatened to kill his mother… it had all changed.
Deflecting many shocked and startled glares, Draco made way to the Gryffindor table, plonking Scorpius down carefully beside him. The Gryffindor’s all stared at him with open mouths, as if they couldn’t comprehend the fact that Draco Malfoy was sitting at their table. Well, that made two of them.
‘Ron told me that you’d stalked away a few moments ago.’ Potter took a deep breath, ‘the war’s over Malfoy, we don’t have to be rivals anymore. In fact, I think we could even be civil.’
Potter once again, gave Draco a frazzled look and he seriously debated whether to aim a discrete silencing charm at the child.
‘Goodnight Potter.’ He muttered softly, before taking one last fond look at the sleeping figure, then shutting the door with a small tap.
Draco sighed before turning to face beautiful green eyes, ‘It’s not so much that I hate than I find you profusely irritable.’ He told him honestly.
, you’re going, I’ve brought reinforcements,’ she gestured to the heap of what appeared to be muggle clothing resting in her grasp.
‘Wouldn’t you like to know,’ he spat out whilst cutting up a few pieces of bacon. He glared at Potter, ‘Do you want to explain why you didn’t get off your arse and help?’
special about Potter that everyone else could hardly compare? Why had Harry Potter stolen the key to his heart, that he’d kept so strongly hidden?
Dumbledore inclined his head slightly, ‘Fawkes,’ he told the jubilant bird, ‘would you please go and inform Professors Snape and McGonagall that they are needed in my office at once.’
The laughter carried on as Scorpius tangled his hand through Draco’s, turning to face him with wide eyes, ‘Papa?’ he asked hesitantly, and Draco nodded encouragingly, ‘will you be dere to wayke me up tomowwow?’
Luckily, the Fat Lady and himself hadn’t come to blows, as Potter had intervened with that pathetic Potterish charm that brought the wizarding world to its knees.
Feeling far from calm, Draco stood up, his eyes scanning the masses frantically. Scorpius was gone. He’d turned his head for just a single second, and the child was gone. Something must have happened to him. Someone
Draco glanced over at the many eighth years who had gathered round the fireplace in a circle. Shots of alcohol were sprawled between them, and they looked over to Potter and him expectantly.
Sentence unfinished Draco turned on his heel and made leeway to the one place where he could finally think.
Draco. He’d vowed that he would never set foot in a party-like scene as long as he was still in Hogwarts. But that had changed. Now, he was going to a party. He’d broken his rule for Potter.
Potter left. Draco sighed as he pushed himself off the ledge. All he wanted to do was curl up into bed with a good book. He’d tried to be Potter’s friend and he’d failed.
Draco gasped at the small act of defiance, as small as it was, it’s meaning was large. He crossed his arms over his chest in order to show Scorpius that he wasn’t playing around. The boy just nestled into Potter’s robes as a response.
Draco dwelled over the entire interaction for the rest of the day: playing different scenarios in his head over and over again in an endless loops. When Potter had said, ‘sorry Malfoy,’  he could’ve just nodded before continuing on his merry little way. A nod would’ve been
She beamed, ‘then that’s final, you’re coming.’ She informed him happily, and he sighed, there was no point in fighting a losing battle.
Dumbledore and McGonagall both nodded in agreement as Draco let out an indignant squeak. ‘B-but I can hardly look after a child. I have my NEWTs!’ He stammered.
The words hit Draco like a tonne of bricks, as he forced himself not to imagine a distraught Scorpius, tears staining his face, his nose running like it did whenever he was sad. Suddenly, feeling extremely guilty, he looked down on Potter with wide eyes.
‘MALFOY!’ a loud bang from the common room door interrupted their small moment, as they both sprung apart, ‘I KNOW THAT YOU’RE IN THERE,’ the voice hollered and Draco recognised it to be no other than Potter, because
Absently, he followed Pansy towards the drinks table, watching her mindlessly as she poured them a few shots. Would it be cowardly just to turn back now? To collapse into the safety of his bed and wish the world away?
Now Severus appeared to be worriedly bewildered. ‘Draco,’ he hissed, ‘you’ve never met this child, have you?’
All hope Draco had left quickly diminished at her words, a way out of this mess obviously looked grim.
Scorpius started to sniff as his nose became runny, ‘you don’t cawre abowt my Daddy. But you wuv Daddy!’ He cried out, hot, wet tears running freely down his cheeks.
stop’ he snarled bitterly. He knew exactly what she was doing, of what she was trying to get him to do. She made the same move each night.
When he was just about done, Scorpius stuck his fork into a particularly large piece of egg before shooting Draco a gleeful look, ‘I always win,’ he chirped as he brought the fork to his mouth.
Dumbledore clapped his hands gleefully. ‘It’s settled then, Draco, you will watch over Scorpius during his stay here at Hogwarts. He will sleep in the Slytherin dormitories with you as well, and if for whatever reason you can’t care for him, then you shall find a suitable regent for that period of time.’
‘No, it’s a fucking dog,’ he deadpanned as he went about cutting up a few sausages and bacon for Scorpius to eat. His eyes drifted back onto Millicent, ‘what does it
The room of requirement hadn’t changed much after the war, after all it had been exposed to, Draco was more than surprised. Draco shivered as he remembered the last time he’d been there, the day he’d watched his friend die.
Merlin help him! The boy was digging him an early grave. He could see it now, Draco Lucius Malfoy cause of death: a stubborn little bugger.
Except, Draco wouldn’t do that. He didn’t have Potter’s courage. No, he was currently grimacing at his reflection, his oldest and most worn robes clung to his skin. His hair was a mess upon his head, his smile non-existent.
Draco nodded absently, it not escaping his notice that many of the other eighth years were looking in their direction. He couldn’t blame them; they
Draco held his chin up high in defiance, ‘if not me, who?’ he challenged her, a frustrated edge to his tone.
Draco should just save himself the trouble, he should mumble a flimsy excuse to Pansy and be done with it. The heartache wasn’t worth it, he didn’t even think his heart could take it. He’d been stuck between caring too little and caring too much for a long time, and now…
‘I don’t know Draco. The rumours seem pretty feasible. I can imagine it now, one or two shots of firewhiskey too many. Music pumping in his hears, making him all hot and heavy. Who’s to say that a slut like Potter did fuck—
‘We won’t be seeing anymore of Scorpius for the time being,’ he told her absently, as he pulled his wand for his pocket. The long stick was thrust between his hands as he tried to avert his attention anywhere but Pansy’s burning gaze.
‘I’M DE KING OF DE WORWLD!’ He yelled and a few Muggles turned to coo at the besotted child. Draco couldn’t blame them, he had to admit, the child was somewhat cute. In an after he’s full of sweets kind of way.
Once he had deterred from his conscious mind, he returned his gaze back onto an infuriating Pansy, ‘last time I’d checked, Potter’s cock hasn’t been anywhere near my arse,’ he bit back maliciously.
Several moments later and he returned his attention back onto an amused Dumbledore. The old man ran a hand through the bowl smirking knowingly. ‘You can never go wrong with a sherbet lemon,’ he mused and by the joyful look on Scorpius face, Draco decided that he wasn’t wrong,
He couldn’t help but roll his eyes at the ignorant statement, ‘yes, yes Weasel, it's already been established that Potter and I have a kid.’
‘Papa, you know dat Daddy doesn’t wike it den you say bad words.’ He chastised as if he were of some sort of superiority.
He stared at him expectantly, the bastard, his lips were pouted and chapped -  Granger was right, he
‘Can’t we go with you?’ Pansy asked in an oddly excited tone, which confused him greatly. She couldn’t be- no, that wasn’t possible. He studied her carefully and sure enough her pupils were blow and her grin was wide. She was beaming at the small child. How typical.
This had been one of that main reasons he’d wanted to avoid the Gryffindor table in the first place, but as
Scorpius looked as if he was considering before he broke out into a broad smile, showing them the ring proudly. ‘Papa says tha’ only a vewy special pewson can wear this ring,’ he beamed shaking his hand happily.
He couldn’t help but smile at Potter’s innocence, before nodding. ‘Yes, you did,’ he assured him as the dorm came into sight.
‘Excuse me,’ Draco quickly interrupted, shooting Pansy a death glare, ‘I have to use the lavatory,’ he lied, leaving before Pansy made a bigger fool of him then he was probably doing already.
Blaise let out an amused chuckle and Draco became blatantly aware that they were still drowning under a sea of eyes. It was as if these people had never seen a child before.
As for him, Draco was content to keep quiet, but as always, Scorpius had other plans. ‘Now you says sowwy to uncle won,’ he told him pointedly.
Dumbledore smiled kindly down at the young boy sitting in front of him. If he were honest, this was not at all what he’d expected. A small, shy, Scorpius sat in a chair too big, feet barely dangling off the edge. His back was straight, his hands were folded neatly on his lap, and he looked around the room in complete awe, drinking in the magnificence that was the Headmaster’s office.
At long last, the wailing stopped as Scorpius finally noticed Draco standing there. ‘PAPA!’ He screamed happily as he ran across the room clumsily, burying his face in Draco’s robes.
‘I’m inclined to believe that Albus, Minerva, Severus, and myself will attempt to find a viable solution to your little problem.’ Her eyes darted between the boys in acute seriousness, ‘in the meantime, I suggest you both cater to the boy until further notice.’ She finished.
Draco had began running. He ran from the Dark Lord, he ran from his responsibilities, he bolted from his ghosts – from the person he used to be. He’d ran from it all.
Potter tutted, shaking his head defiantly, ‘Whatever you were going to say, you’re wrong,’ he declared proudly.
At that exact moment, Potter made his way towards him, crouching to his knees, so that himself and Scorpius were eye-level.
‘No. It may be a revelation to you Potter, but I find that my time is better spent without unseemly large quantities of alcohol.’
Draco rolled his eyes, ‘yes, it appears I do,’ he took yet another step towards the odd pair, ‘so, if you’d be so kind as to unhand him, that would be
‘I’m glad, sociopath wouldn’t be a good look on you,’ Potter told him before he sighed, ‘I’m going back in, are you coming with?’
This sudden surge of protectiveness over the child had him alarmed, he hadn’t the foggiest idea as to where it’d sprung from. It was impulsive. All he was certain of was that he didn’t want Potter anywhere near Scorpius.
Thus, Draco had ended up pressed into a crisp white shirt, smothered in tight black skinny jeans, his hair messy in a naturalistic kind of way, and a scowl plastered onto his lips. He looked good; he
happy about. Having to scoff down a few sandwiches with Snape and McGonagall was not his idea of a good time.
He was halfway towards the doors, when a deafening cry echoed throughout the room, halting him in his tracks. In a blink of an eye, two tiny arms had wrapped themselves around his legs, a tear streaked face buried into his robes.
ave to bwy me more sweets layter,’ the child reminded him and Draco wondered why he’d ever thought him to be anything but a Slytherin.
He sneaked a glance at the Gryffindor table where Potter was having a very hushed and somewhat frustrated conversation with Granger. The git looked restless as Granger held his hand down whispering furiously. All Draco took from the peculiar scene was that help wasn’t coming any time soon.
! The late-night exchanges they had, were nothing compared to this. Potter never remembered those. But this he would remember. He would look back on their small interaction and think… ‘Malfoy is a right jerk.’
it was – there was his answer. He didn’t spend his days mooning over Potter because he fancied him, nor because he was in love with him. No, he mooned over Potter because he was
The door swung open and Draco was met with a seething Harry Potter, red faced and wand in hand. He rolled his eyes, exiting the common room, entering the hallway, and shutting the door firmly behind him.
‘That may be. But your DNA is all over the towel.’ He tutted, as he walked even closer towards Weasley.
Before he could gather his bearings, Smith chucked what was left of his drink all over him, ‘You think you’re too good for me, huh?’ he spat angrily.
Scorpius smiled looking up with adoration, ‘me and Papa is gowing to ave a fwantaswic time! It’ll be wike when Daddy’s out fighting bad gwys and it’s just me and Papa left all alone.’ He said, before yawning widely.
Presently, Draco was sitting on the ledge of a raised window in the newly acquainted eighth year common room. He watched the wind dance in the nights sky softly as he waited. He was alone. He was
But in the autumn, you watch powerlessly as life slowly succumbs to an inevitable death. Draco hates it. The flowers falter, the grass turns grey, as the world preps for its eventual demise. At least in the winter, the worst is over, but in the autumn it’s yet to come. You’re trapped watching the life drain from the earths eyes, and there’s nothing one can do to prevent it.
Defeated, Draco collapsed onto the floor, doing nothing to stop the fresh tears that rolled down his cheeks.
Tomorrow he’d be attending a party. He hadn’t been to one of those since the war had ended. The Slytherin’s used to pull off huge blockbusters every Saturday, they still did as far as he knew. He’d always attend, he’d been the life of the party. Giggling, laughing drunkenly, kissing anything that moved. That used to be his life.
Severus looked how he felt, spluttering and muttering, completely baffled. The boy continued, completely unaware to the frazzled looks he was receiving, ‘yu is being silly Uncle Sevrus, yu know that m’ four, you was at my biwfday pawty,’
He supposed they looked quite the picture, Potter, Scorpius, and himself. Harry Potter crouching before a child of whom was locked onto Draco Malfoy’s legs, claiming to be their son. If he were an outsider looking in, he would’ve thought they looked
Potter took a step closer towards him, and Draco’s heart started to beat rapidly. ‘Are you suggesting that I do that also… with you?’
‘Is that a child?’ Millicent squeaked and Draco remembered that half the Slytherin’s hadn’t even been present last night.
‘Actually,’ Severus eyes Draco, who now had a sudden dreading feeling in his stomach, ‘considering that the boy claims to be your son, as well as having the appropriate evidence, I would say that you’re a
Draco looked down at his masterpiece. The bread was all different sizes, the butter barely coating each one. The ham and lettuce hardly fit between the two slabs. The tomato was sprawled out messily atop of the bread. And where the fuck was the cucumber? Some may call it a disaster, Draco called it progress.
Even now in an abandoned corridor, which what he considered to be his sanctuary, Potter still lived in Draco’s head.
Well, he’d had a good run, but it was hide time that he crawled into a whole and died. There would be no coming back from this, according to the toddler he was married, and had an active sex like with Harry bloody Potter. Father was most definitely rolling in his grave.
Draco sighed, as he threaded a calming hand through black curls, he knew exactly what to do. He always did. ‘You said that you wanted to go to your dorm’ Draco told the baffled boy gently.
Pansy followed suit, sprawling herself across that very sofa, resting her head in his lap. Draco brought a shaking hand out, threading it through her hair as he toyed with it mindlessly.
A loud clatter stopped him in his tracks as he set the knife down with a clank. He watched in delight as Weasley sauntered over to the sink and pulled out a paper towel. Then proceeding to scrub off all evidence that linked him to the scene of the crime.
, but it was fucking better than Pansy’s defiant glare. Plus, at least he wasn’t dreaming about Potter. The green-eyed Saviour had only made two appearances.
If Draco was in the Great Hall - Potter was there. If he was on the quidditch field - Potter made an appearance. If he was in the room of requirement - Potter was outside.
explanation,’ she gave him a pointed look which made him feel around three, ‘this whole ordeal is extremely peculiar. In all my years, I’ve never come across something
‘Papa and I aren’t fighting,’ he whispered at the trembling child. ‘Please don’t cry,’ he pleaded with him softly.
The lights were bright, he hadn’t even considered that the common room would be full – there was barely any room to navigate. The music was an incoherent beat, scarring his ears, he had half a mind to down a shot – or two.
Unwanted images of Draco’s sixth year filtered through his mind. It was the year where he had lost everything. His social standing, his innocence, his
‘If you put your clothes on, then I’ll buy you some sweets on Saturday,’ he promised, and the boy clapped his hands manically.
‘Shhhh,’ he whispered quietly, ‘don’t you want to play with the snakes?’ he asked pointing to the Slytherin table where Pansy and Blaise were shooting him looks of pity. Well, Pansy was, Blaise was just smirking in a karma is a bitch kind of way.
‘How in Salazar’s name did you find chicken this early into the morning?’ he incredulously asked the red head.
Without a second glance Draco heaved himself from the floor, he had to get him to Dumbledore immediately. This all could be potentially dangerous, who knew what kind of evil had orchestrated this.
She shook her head, giving him a wistful look, ‘no, Harry Potter being your baby daddy doesn’t surprise me at all,’ she announced honestly.
Scorpius squirmed in his grip, as his face started to flush wildly, ‘ooo yes, daddy ‘as twld me all bout hogwawts. Tis where you met,’ he declared happily as he snuggled into the crook of Draco’s neck.
‘Malfoy!’ a drunken voice called, stopping Draco in his tracks. He turned round to see Weasley smiling at him happily. ‘Come and play.’
Potter gave him a look that brought him a large deal of discomfort as he mentally reminded himself not to anger Potter to such an extent in the near future. ‘Your try dealing with a screaming child who wants nothing but his Papa.’
Draco’s lips curled into a victorious smile, ‘that’s exactly what I hoped you would say.’ He declared triumphantly.
Pansy shook her head carefully as she sighed, ‘maybe,’ she told him softly, ‘but that someone doesn’t have to be you.’
The boy stuck his tongue out at his friend, ‘Uncle Bwaise, you tis a lot meaner twoday dan usual,’ he chided and Draco snorted.
Then Potter had started following him. And Draco was ecstatic if not a small bit irritated. For some absurd reason he’d believed that Potter
child. Scrambling through his closet, Draco found a shirt that was far too small for him and dragged it over Scorpius’ head. It still reached the small boy’s feet, but Draco was certain that he’d at least be comfortable.
Draco recoiled from his touch, mentally reminding himself to put spiders in the gits bed later. He was more terrified of the nasty creatures than Ronald bloody Weasley, and
Draco could do nothing but squeeze his eyes tight and pray that no one had noticed. That it would all be over soon.
She carried on, ‘It’s disgustingly obvious that you want to fuck him, you drool at the mention of his name,’ she narrowed her eyes at him, ‘you’re
They continued to make their way through the store and Draco was fascinated by a small square. It was green, Slytherin green to be exact and it was fascinating. He clicked the little button and was amazed to see the little flame burst out. His hand just ached to reach out and…
He opened his eyes, his vision hazy, his pulse beating erratically. It may have hurt, but it was what he needed to hear. Draco
Once the words had left his mouth, he felt nothing but a shame. Forced to retort to nothing but apologies, to a Weasley nonetheless, by Granger and a four-year-old child. It had only been a day and he hardly recognised himself.
The Gryffindor gave him a sharp nod, and without another word led him to the tower where Draco was certain Scorpius was waiting.
The boy did nothing but snuggle deeper into Potter’s warmth, and just as Draco was about to pick the child up and drag him away, Potter let out a low cough.
Scorpius chuckled as he became particularly fixed on a very large watermelon. Draco payed him no mind in favour of selecting a few delectable green apples.
Draco cleared his throat, looking down defeatedly at the small hand, ‘it’s the Malfoy family ring,’ he answered, ‘it’s infused with magic so pure that only a Malfoy by blood or marriage would be able to bare it.’ he took a deep breath before carrying on, ‘The wearer can be no other than the first-born son of the current Lord Malfoy.’
Feeling guilty, Draco gave him a small nudge before taking a sweet from the bowl. He smiled, ‘would you like one?’
He’d heard all about this DNA a while back from Pansy. She had and still has this crazy obsession with this obscene element called science. Draco had promise not to utter a word about it to anyone. He
Draco laughed, almost manically, then raised his wand throwing the nastiest hex he could think of. As it hit Potter square in the chest, he flew backward and slammed into the opposite wall, his shoulders sagging slightly.
Scorpius beamed, nodding enthusiastically and Draco’s heart clenched so hard that he ignored the voice in his head urging him to ask Dumbledore’s permission first. He extended his arm, gesturing for Scorpius to take the sweet, which he did.
‘Malfoy?’ a hesitant voice asked, and Draco ignored them in favour of melancholically gazing out of the window.
Weasley carried on, ‘The muggle way of cleaning leaves no evidence, it’s good for covering up a chicken crime. And since I’m sure the house elves won’t be happy when they find out I’ve started on tomorrow’s dinner, I think this crime needs some muggle cleaning.’ He declared proudly.
outfit that many would preen over. His hair would be styled perfectly, a genuine smile upon his face. They’d all laugh and joke till the moon went down and the sun came up. And maybe,
They’d been screaming back and fourth at one another ever since Draco had demanded that the boy got ready. According to Scorpius he was tired and wanted to sleep more. Draco had scoffed at that, as if a four-year-old little menace were going to tell Draco Malfoy what to do. No, he’d been determined to stand his ground until the boy had relented.
The words were like ice daggers to his heart, and Draco found himself heaving from the bed, and standing on the hard floor. Without as much as a second glance, Draco headed towards the doors.
be around him. He had taunted him, spat at him, and laughed at him, but the only thing that had remained constant was his obsession over Harry Potter. Back then, his naïve self had passed it off as hatred, Draco knew better now.
him. He didn’t have friends. Well, except for Weasley and Granger but they hardly counted. No, Potter had followers. People didn’t talk to him because they wanted to be his friend, they spoke to him because he’d survived an AK at birth and killed a crazed maniac.
’ he howled out as his hand came down to rub his shin. He turned towards a glaring Scorpius, ‘what was that for?’
every time the two of them fought? If he were Potter, he would’ve kept his mouth shut, not putting him in a position of risk. He did
you do, you’ll zip it,’ she murmured murderously, ‘I’ve been needing a new necklace anyhow. And I think they’d do
He shook his had and bit his bottom lip as he clambered from the chair and ran clumsily over to Draco, folding his arms protectively over his legs.
Moments later, he heard the door open once more. Blaise leaned against the doorframe, an unreadable look dusting his features.
‘Don’t act like you don’t know Malfoy,’ he pulled an oval shaped badge from his robes pinning it onto his tie, ‘the Wizard’s Chicken Association,
Instead of telling them what for, which he so desperately wanted to do, he fixed his gaze onto Scorpius. He seemed to be in deep thought, and Draco just knew that he was planning something. The lightbulb above his head was practically blinding.
?’ Blaise choked out as he eyed the eating boy with a vengeance, ‘little bugger woke me up and seven in the bloody morning.’ He snapped.
Both his friends gave each other perplexed looks, acting just as Draco had the first time he’d laid eyes on it.
His reply was nothing except from throwing the apples that he’d previously chosen into the trolley, it didn’t matter that Potter’s statement was somewhat accurate, he’d eat every last one of those bitter apples.
‘Whether you’re going to be a good or terrible father isn’t the most pressing issue right now,’ she gave his hand as small squeeze, ‘right now, there’s a boy out there who’s probably scared shitless that his father isn’t with him. Whether he’s yours, Potter’s, or just a potion gone wrong, it’s up to you to make sure that Scorpius knows that he’s safe.’
Scorpius looked up at him with wide, hopeful eyes, ‘you said somefing abowt sweets?’ he questioned intently and Draco sighed. Fuck being a Gryffindor, this kid was a Slytherin through and through.
He ignored the small voice in his head telling him to turn back as he entered the room of requirement. Having a moral conscious was bothersome.
It seemed as though nothing could sway their decision, so at that, Draco bent down scooping Scorpius up in one move. The small child beamed, snuggling comfortably into his neck.
Potter rounded at him, glaring with a fierceness he’d never seen before, ‘are you being serious? All evidence suggests that he is your
‘Ahem.’ Dumbledore shook his head, gesturing to a sweet infused Scorpius, ‘I suggest that we refrain from unpleasantries for the time being.’
He was just about to scream abduction when his gaze landed on Scorpius standing by the doors of the Great Hall. Instead of flooding with relief, Draco’s  stomach filled with dread as Scorpius uttered a single word.
are you wearing?’ Pansy’s voice had startled him. She was leaning against the doorframe in his dorm, her eyes wide, her mouth agape.
Draco shook his head, clutching Scorpius’ hand in a protective manner, ‘there’s too much to see and far too little time,’ he defended as he stopped in front of the apples.
It was a wonder that he’d managed to kill the Dark Lord at all, you could hear him coming from a mile away. Potter still being alive was nothing short of a miracle.
He thought of Pansy. She was probably still with Weasley and Granger laughing about his affection for Potter. ‘He’s a lost cause,’ Pansy would say and they’d both nod in agreement. ‘The git never stood a chance,’ Weasley would tell them and Granger would admit that she’d lied, and Potter wasn’t out thinking about homework. ‘He’s fucking Smith as we speak, has been for weeks,’ she would say and they’d all chuckle and smile.
people, as if they’re not your minions any longer.’ He told him honestly and Draco tried not to be offended.
Draco was about to say something to Dumbledore about the only unpleasantry here being Potter when the door opened and both Snape and McGonagall strode in, each looking more livid than the next. ‘HARRY JAMES POTTER!’ McGonagall roared. Draco flinched looking at Snape, but Severus just stood there glaring at him. Did Potter seriously put up with this
‘You always says dat Papa ooks beauwtiful when he cwries,’ he gestured towards Draco, who then looked down locking his gaze onto Potter’s.
Draco may have been a right git when he was younger, but at least the people that spoke to him didn’t
sometimes he’d wonder what it would be like to be Harry Potter’s friend. Did Weasley ever joke into his ear: some being funny, some being ludicrous, and some being downright stupid. But maybe, just maybe Draco wished that he were the one to make Potter’s eyes light up, a colossal grin spreading across his face.
‘You do realise that you’re a wizard.’ Draco chimed in, figuring that he could no longer bare to watch this hideous display of idiocy.
The Great Hall was silent except from the large steps he was taking towards the disgruntled pair. Each step felt like one closer to death, and he was very aware of
Against his better judgement, he smiled at that as he remembered his early morning interaction with Weasley. If Draco were an idiot, then what the
His studies would never make him sad. His studies would listen, and only listen. His studies wouldn’t fight with or laugh at him. His studies wouldn’t fuck anything and everything that moved. His studies wouldn’t break his heart…
Pansy shook her head lightly before downing another shot, ‘no, you tricked yourself. I simply gave you a
autumn arrives with a buoyant lack of subtly. There are browns that come as a comforting quilt to the earth, yet the rest are the hues of volcanoes, of firework sparks and festival hoopla. Nature calls out to spring, and the trees can’t help but become as flowers, towering blossoms of flamed foliage to dance into the skies before tumbling as giant confetti to the sidewalks and verges.
As Potter rubbed his arm, Draco couldn’t help but smile, seeing Potter in pain just did things to him.
If Draco thought about dinner, then images of dessert would slither into his mind, next came the waft of treacle tart, and before he knew it Potter had made an appearance. If he saw a glimpse of Granger, he’d think about her absmayl potions skills, do you know who else has absmayl potion making skills? Potter.
So, he hadn’t forgotten, but he’d convinced himself that it was going to be alright. He was going to walk into the common room, his head held high, greet his peers, and sit down. He’d be wearing a drop-dead
Thankfully, they hadn’t run into any curious bystanders with the majority of students holed up in the Great Hall for breakfast. Alas, he’d bet his last galleon that they were the prime topic of many a conversation as of right now.
‘Mmm you smell nice,’ a tired voice murmured, as a large hand threaded through his perfectly styled hair and Draco tried not to become irritable. ‘
‘He shall stay here at Hogwarts.’ Dumbledore said simply. ‘I’m certain that he shall be happier here than anywhere else, whilst we explore the circumstances of his arrival. As for who he will stay with, I’m sure that Hagrid will be more than happy to watch Scorpius during the school day.’
Draco’s eyes darted towards the pair; they looked a perfect picture. Potter’s large hand threading through raven-locks, Scorpius nuzzling into the touch. The boy looked the epitome of
‘Am I the only one that thinks all this is barmy,’ Weasley exclaimed braking the long and awkward silence, he narrowed his eyes onto Scorpius, ‘I mean, Harry and Malfoy have a kid. Harry has a
Pansy growled, placing her hands on her hips in challenge, ‘all this still doesn’t explain why in Merlin’s name
Impulsively, Draco spun back around so that his eyes were locked onto furious green one. He put a hand to his hip as he snarled, ‘you said that you didn’t want to leave Scorpius in the hands of someone like me, this way you won’t have to.’ He gave Potter one last glare, not trusting himself to look at Scorpius’ sleeping figure.
He gave Draco the biggest smile he’d seen from him yet, as he held his hands up waiting for his top to be put on. ‘Why didn’t yu jus say dat in de firs place.’ He asked Draco happily, after his top was on. Slytherin. The boy was one hundred percent Slytherin.
Potter looked positively pale and Draco felt an ounce of sympathy for the Gryffindor, it had only been three measly days since Snape had screamed at him in a similar fashion.
But he’d wear Muggle attire again in a heartbeat if it meant that he could go to Tesco once more, he was certain that the place was run by wizards.
Draco could feel his head starting to spin, as he took a step back, in an attempt to gather himself.
As he stared at a guilt ridden Weasley, his mind drifted to the flock of Weasley’s that had graced Hogwarts halls, then back onto
did you know that?’ he accused him and Draco shuddered at the vein on his forehead that threatened to explode.
child, and I’ll be damned if I leave him alone with some loveless character like yourself,’ he bit back angrily.
Personally, Draco thought that Severus looked fabulous with purple hair, his godfather hadn’t agreed.
Draco ignored her in favour of cutting up a small piece of chicken and popping it carefully in his mouth. Merlin, it was good!
‘I don’t wan you to go, I wuv you Papa,’ he cried out and Draco could hear the fresh tears in his tone. Even for someone as cold as he, the sight was a tough pill to swallow. No one wanted to be the reason that a child was reduced to nothing but tears.
The trek to Dumbledore’s office suddenly seemed endless, and Draco wished to turn his head from inquisitive eyes. ‘At Hogwarts. It’s a school,’ he answered absently wondering just what had happened to the small boy. The fact that someone could’ve harmed an innocent left him feeling uncomfortable.
He didn’t see him, but he did happen upon a few raunchy teens and thought it a bit too much for an eighth-year common room party.
Draco crossed his arms firmly across his chest, ‘because I don’t want you there,’ he answered simply.
Dumbledore smiled down at a sniffling Scorpius who Draco couldn’t help but notice was transfixed onto the sherbet lemons on the desk.
Malfoy,’ he said with his whole chest and Draco glared. ‘If any more nosey bastards like yourself come poking in here, who do you think they’ll blame for the chicken crime if they pick up on my magical signature?’
Blaise smirked before turning to face Draco, ‘Good, good. That means that it’s of complete relevance when I tell you to get your head out of your arse.’
‘Good.’ He declared, and without another word picked Scorpius up, fastening him tightly onto his hip. He then quickly left the room, slamming the door forcefully behind him.
Draco sighed, attempting to rid his tone from any amusement, ‘I have no idea,’ he said honestly. ‘Apparently it’s what muggles have instead of a magical signature. But because merlin hates us, we have it to.’
‘I always thought you hated roleplay Harry,’ Thomas wiggled his eyebrows suggestively expecting a snappy answer, Potter on the other hand, simply shoved his reddened face into his hands. Coward.
was in Hogwarts! If that weren’t newsworthy then he didn’t know what was, Rita Skeeter would have a fucking field day.
Dazed, he looked around, Potter looked to be unconscious. For a terrified moment, Draco thought about running to Dumbledore and confessing what they’d done. Potter could be dead for all he bloody knew, something about that didn’t sit right with him. Just as Draco made way for the Headmaster’s office, a small cough stopped him in his tracks.
Soon enough, there was a loud bang as the common room door slammed open. Draco took a deep breath before climbing down from the ledge, what or who he’d been waiting for had arrived.
Well, if he wants to act like a petulant little baby, then Draco would let him. ‘You know what?’ he spat out, ‘I don’t need your shit!’ he announced with finality before stomping away.
No, it wasn’t hate, for the only emotion it could be was love. He wanted to hold hands with him as they walked the crowded halls. He wanted to utter a joke that made him laugh. He wanted to be the reason that Potter smiled. He wanted to be the last thing he thought about each night, and the first name on his lips every morning. He wanted to cuddle, kiss, and touch Potter. He wanted it
‘Catch,’ Weasley said as a green apple flew across the room and into his waiting hand. ‘I know they’re your favourite. I heard it from a… friend.’
we’re not going to Hogsmeade?’ he growled, absently aware that Scorpius was becoming heavy in his arms.
With on last flick, Draco stood up and made his way out of the dorm. ‘Nighty night,’ Potter’s sleepy voice whispered, and Draco couldn’t stop the grin that spread across his face.
‘I love your Daddy.’ He spat the words out and began to lift his head back when a tiny hand caught his.
‘Whatever do you mean?’ he asked her, feigning innocence, whilst secretly praying that she’d deem him a lost cause and permit him to slither out of their plans.
smart,’ he huffed out in annoyance. ‘Secondly, I knew you were a buffoon but I hadn’t realised it was to such an extent,’ he chastised.
Potter scoffed, ‘it’s your funeral Malfoy.’ He bent down, picking up Scorpius and fastening him onto his shoulders.
‘Well then, let’s go,’ he gestured towards the door, and Scorpius shook his head. Draco sighed, ‘what is it now?’
Draco wanted the world to swallow him whole at Pansy’s shriek. They’d spent so long hauled up in Dumbledore’s office that it was now well into the evening. They had even missed dinner. That was something that Draco was
Even worse, Draco and Scorpius had been spotted by at least several students, and he was certain that the news of their predicament would be widely known come tomorrow morning. Ignoring their stares and glares, he had brought Scorpius back to the Slytherin common room, only to be bombarded with yet more stares and questions.
that look. Before he had the chance to stop her she shouted, ‘Weasley, Granger!’ stalking determinedly towards them.
His friend hummed softly at the revelation, and Draco turned to face her completely baffled. He quirked a frustrated brow, ‘what? No, how the fuck is Harry Potter the father of your supposed child, or how could you be so stupid as to let Potter anywhere near your pert arse?’
of the story, he’d conveniently left out the whole potential father thing. He’d told them of the little surprise visit in the room of requirement, as well as responsibility for the child befalling onto Draco. He’d also warned them to stay away from Snape for at least a couple of days, the git had been
‘Really?’ she raised an amused brow, ‘because the drool on your chin and the boner in your lap says differently,’ Pansy declared triumphantly.
Draco felt his face heat up and Weasley’s eyes widened, as he quickly put a hand to Granger’s mouth. ‘Shhhh,’ he whispered frantically, his eyes darting around the room, ‘someone could be
Blaise put his hands up in surrender, ‘Okay, okay. All I’m saying is one magical night together and you’ll forget all—
‘I’m sure that Scorpius here will be more than happy to come to all of your classes,’ Severus told him and Scorpius nodded frantically. The little traitor.
Her speech was stopped when she felt a sharp jab at her legs. Somehow, Scorpius had shimmied out of Draco’s grasp in favour of giving her a piece of his mind.
‘When they too are so drunk they can barely stand?’ he uttered out, ‘they’re not in the right state of mind to protect him. They can’t keep him safe.’ He told her. The
He knew that she was right, there was no point trying to fight it any longer. For some absurd reason, the Room of Requirement ha bestowed a child upon him, one that clearly believed Draco to be his father. It would be cruel not to see this through to the end, he had to be there for Scorpius, whether he liked it or not.
They ended up back in the common room, huddled up in a corner by the fireplace, their legs entwined, as they lent on one another for support. Music was still playing and the eighth years were still dancing. If anything, they were drunker than he’d ever seen them.
A hard clamp landed on his shoulder and he turned to find a smirking Blaise. ‘Congratulations!’ the infuriating bastard announced, ‘you’re a father.’
He watched Potter lovingly yet again, thread a hand through raven locks, and it chided him just how accepting Potter was of this mess. They had a
He felt his heart constrict in his chest as he looked at the distressed child, what kind of father left his child unattended? Not him, that’s for certain. He was just about to object yet again when something shiny caught his eye.
many eyes had now been exposed to the whole ordeal. Their fiery gaze trailed him as if he were the main attraction of an act, as slowly the scene before him became close enough to touch.
Grades, assignments, and practical’s were rare, and even if they were assigned they seemed of unimportance. Still, Draco worked at it, spending endless nights in the library studying because we weren’t all Ravenclaws.
Dumbledore shook his head, ‘nothing is impossible when we are affronted with the laws of magic. Of course, we’ll have to check with Madam Pomfrey, but I am quite certain that this is Mr Malfoy’s child,’ he said with assertion.
He had known Weasley long enough to know that this was not his usual idiotic bafflement, no, Weasley was genuinely surprised to see him. Well, that made two of them.
‘No problem at all,’ he hissed. ‘Scorpius and I are going to Hogsmeade to buy him suitable attire, and before you ask, no you cannot come.’
Draco put a hand on his hip, lifting his chin in defiance, ‘your tears won’t work on me,’ he told the boy.
She shrugged, and Draco was certain that she seemed somewhat disappointed, ‘that’s hardly the point Draco.’
‘Blaise it’s a school day, rules say we have to be up and six.’ Draco countered, too worked up to stomach any food.
Instead on bursting into tears like Draco had predicted, the boy blinked a few times before clambering onto his lap, ignoring Draco’s puffs and protests. Draco was staring into sad eyes as a chubby hand reached out, wiping away a fallen tear from Draco’s cheek.
Draco nodded solemnly as a small chirper voice perked up, ‘Papa?’ Scorpius asked hesitantly and Draco begrudgingly turned towards him.
Draco took a deep breath, gently brushing a stubborn curl from Potter’s face as his thumb traced over his scar delicately. To many the scar represented victory and power, for Draco it symbolised all things Potter. Everything that was
Severus shot daggers at him, ‘I hardly think that you’re in a position to say anything, Mr Malfoy. I for one, think it an
Potter rolled his eyes, ‘for whatever craped up reason, he was completely devastated that you weren’t there when he’d woken up, he started bawling.’ He stood up a little straighter and sighed, ‘still is.’
Grey eyes never left green as he said, ‘I’m waiting Potter. Tell me, what do you really think you’re going to do?’
‘Unless you fancy burning yourself, I wouldn’t do that it I were you,’ Potter snapped as he snatched the device from Draco’s grasp.
The sudden outburst came from Scorpius, who jumped up onto his chair. He looked frightened, ‘I don’t know im! I don’ want Hagwid!’ Tears formed in the crests of his eyes and gently started to fall.
‘Scorpius wanted me…’ he choked out, not quite understanding why the knowledge pierced his heart so.
Even when he attempted to joke, he still came across as an idiot. Which was yet another reason why he and Potter were very much incompatible.
Draco was shocked at the action as the boy whispered, ‘Daddy tells me tha you ook bwautiful when you cwy, but I don’t wike it when you’re sad.’
The Gryffindor turned to shoot Draco a firm look, ‘we’re not going back to Hogwarts,’ he said. ‘We’re going to Grimmauld Place.’
Draco ignored him, swarming the kitchen in hopes of finding a late night, or should he say early morning snack. Tomatoes, cucumber, lettuce, and ham. Delicious! He grabbed a freakishly long knife and began.
‘AUNT PANSY?’ She rounded on Draco, and it was then where he knew that he’d messed up. ‘PAPA?!’ she shrilled incredulously.
A scrape of a bench echoed throughout the now silent hall, ‘say that one more time and I swear I’ll—
Draco shrugged, ‘call me imbecilic, but wouldn’t a cleaning charm be a far more efficient way to rid yourself from that unseemly grease?’ he asked.
The ring had been passed down through generations of Malfoys, he looked down to where the ring that sat on his fourth finger. It only being there because he was…
She took a deep breath before answering, ‘waiting here for Potter every night, as he comes back drunk off his face.’
Scorpius was still wrapped around Potter’s legs, showing no sign of letting go. His eyes were firmly glued shut, but if you were to look closer, which Draco did, you could see the hot tears dusting his cheeks. It were as if the child had spent years looking, and now finally salvation had found him.
‘Do you think that it’s soup?’ He questioned hesitantly. ‘Cereal, that is. Do you think that cereal is soup?’ he stammered out.
‘Sorry about that champ,’ Blaise ran his fingers through Scorpius’ hair, ‘why don’t you tell me all about your Daddy?’
‘Perhaps,’ she gave him a mischievous smirk, ‘but soon Potter’s pants will be yours’ she told him and Draco’s eyes widened. He
The breath from his lungs faded as green eyes bore into grey. He could briefly remember Scorpius mentioning the same line back in the room of requirement, he hadn’t played too much attention to it. He hadn’t thought it of significance, but now, as he looked into unreadable green, Draco had an inkling that one line was of a greater importance than he could ever imagine.
He crouched down so that he was eye level with the small boy, ‘Scorpius, please show Pansy and Blaise your hand,’ he asked him politely.
Potter’s mouth opened in disbelief as he shook his head profusely. ‘Are you stark mad, Malfoy?’ he asked, ‘that has to be the barmiest thing I’ve ever heard. You were always looking down on them, telling them to do crap for you. It was the worst during sixth year, don’t you remember?’
he looked good. But it didn’t all that much matter because no one would notice him. A bit like how one would notice a tree in passing, it was acknowledged, but no one stopped to touch it.
‘Scorpius, look the sign says fruit and vegetables,’ he gestured to the sign ahead, ‘let’s go buy some apples!’ He pulled the child along, not even checking to see if Potter was behind.
Draco didn’t say anything, as he felt a single tear escape from his grasp and roll innocently down his cheek.
When they’d reached the wing, Madam Pomfrey had looked at them gravely before simply stating that she’d been expecting them. She had then sat them down, and proceeded to cast the necessary spells, ones that had worn out Scorpius, sending him into a deep sleep.
! Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter had a child together. It was an occurrence worse than the Dark Lord himself.
He rolled his eyes, ready to berate his cocky friend when there was a loud crash from beside him. Panicked, Draco turned around, to find that there was nothing there except from a half-eaten plate.
Just as he’d predicted, the little kid started to brawl, big wet tears now staining his cheeks. ‘Are you okay?’ he asked concerned, slowly approaching the quivering figure. He crouched down next to him, tending to the blood that had already stained the floor.
‘That’s quite right, I’m certain that she’d want to be aware of your… predicament,’ he said amusedly, his blue eyes twinkling.
Granger rolled her eyes fondly, ‘I doubt that such a crime serves to be of any importance,’ she told him smugly.
Tracing the edges of his forearm nervously, his fingers grazing over the snake, he went about cutting through the crowd Pansy in tow, hoping for a glimpse of Potter.
couldn’t find Potter. Perhaps, this was the first night that Potter hadn’t gone out drinking. Maybe,
He no more than sprinted to the door as a large weight landed safely in his protective warmth. Draco felt his heart swell as he walked briskly, but carefully towards the dorms.
Weasley was the first to break the long, drawn out silence, ‘sorry,’ he muttered, his eyes fixed firmly on the ground below.
The picture had turned into one of him and Potter holding hands and smiling, it mirrored ever other picture that Draco had drawn up until he was eleven.
Draco shook his head before he turned to the small boy, ‘Scorpius, would you care to raise your had for everyone to see?’ he asked quietly.
has to live here.’ She narrowed her eyes at the small boy, ‘seriously Draco what the hell is wrong with—
He kept his mouth firmly shut. He couldn’t argue with that, it was the truth after all. Draco would be waiting for Potter. He would always wait for Potter. That thought scared him more than he’d like to admit.
He felt his heart swell and threaded his fingers through messy hair and rubbed a gentle hand on a small back.
They stood in an uncomfortable silence for several minutes before Potter spoke, ‘do you like cereal Malfoy?’ he asked eagerly
was that? If Draco were a braver man he would’ve said ‘yes.’ Potter would’ve either smiled or laughed in his face. But at least he’d done something. He would have given it his best shot, and if it all blew up in his face well… at least Draco would know.
‘Well, maybe Daddy doesn’t want to see you!’ He snapped out, immediately regretting his words as Scorpius started to wail louder than he’d ever heard him.
She tutted before walking towards him with determination, ‘your crap won’t work on me Draco,’ she told him firmly, as she started to pull at his robes.
Scorpius had screamed the whole way to the Great Hall, but Draco didn’t care, he’d given him a choice and the boy had refused. This was the alternative. Outsiders watched disapprovingly and Draco had to fight down the urge to tell them a thing or two. They acted as if they’d been there that morning, as if they
He feasted his gaze back onto Potter, the man looked as if he were in an internal battle of some capacity. After a few silent moments, Potter sighed and patted the young boy’s head tentatively.
She sent him a small smile, ‘Malfoy,’ she returned before snuggling deeper into Weasley’s warmth. ‘This one tells me that you helped him cover up a chicken crime.’
The Headmaster turned his attention to the blonde who sat much like Scorpius, except his posture was much less relaxed.
He glanced down at his Slytherin tie, only to be reminded that Potter was in fact a Gryffindor. And if he looked closely at the sliver strands and green swirls, he could see a hint of red and gold flickering within them. He sneaked a peak at his flamboyant robes to tell himself that he should really pull on something more comfortable, only to be reminded that Potter, too, wore robes.
maybe if given the chance, Draco would treat Potter like he was the only person in the room. He’d go to all his stupid quidditch matches, all big smiles and encouraging banners. He’d hold him close whenever he had a nightmare, mumbling gently that he was here and he’d wasn’t going anywhere. He’d try and fail to bake Potter his favourite dessert, but Potter wouldn’t mind no, he’d love Draco even more for trying.
‘And what do you propose I should’ve done?” He really didn’t know why he told her anything. She laughed at him every time.
Something about that declaration warmed Draco’s heart, and he quickly wished the warmness away. His eyes darted between his two amused friends as he sighed, ‘according to Snape I’m supposed to go to Hogsmeade with him on Saturday to buy him some new clothes. A whole day
‘What’s wrong Potter?’ Draco sneered, running a frustrated finger through tattered locks as he blindly shot hex after hex towards his school nemesis. ‘Seems as though Perfect Potter isn’t as
‘HOW MANY TIMES DO I HAVE TO TELL YOU? THIS OBSSESSION WITH MALFOY IS BORDERLINE STALKER-LIKE. IT IS NOT WORTH YOUR TIME AND IT MOST DEFINITELY IS NOT WORTH MINE. MAYBE IF YOU SPENT JUST A FRACTION OF THE TIME YOU SPEND LOOKING AT MALFOY ON YOUR STUDIES THEN PERHAPS YOU’D BE ACHIEVING HIGHER THAN AN A IN POTIONS.’ She glared at dumbledore after doing a brief sweep of the room. ‘Mr Malfoy,’ she snapped. ‘Something told me I’d be seeing you again.’
‘Where’s little Scorpius?’ she as him with more excitement than he’d ever seen on her, ‘I transfigured this
‘The boys will head out to buy Scorpius here some new clothes, of course,’ Dumbledore said simply. ‘I’m sure that you will all agree that what is best for the child is that we present a united front. Which is why, as of tonight, Mr Potter will be joining Mr Malfoy and little Scorpius in the Slytherin dorm.’
stupid,’ she chastised, ‘and then it’s decided. You’ll be coming to one of those stupid parties tomorrow.’
The next day, and Draco hadn’t slept a wink. Somehow, Pansy’s insistent words had taken refuge in his mind, seeping into his dreams. He said dreams – they were more like
Scorpius gave him a confused look, ‘but you alwedy know bout Daddy, yu saw him yeswerday,’ he turned towards Draco and his face broke into a stellar grin, ‘tis the best Daddy in de whole ‘ide world!’ he announced joyfully.
‘DRACONIUS LUCIUS MALFOY!’ Severus roared, and Draco jumped because never had he ever seen Snape so volatile. McGonagall just stood there, looking at him with resigned eyes. ‘I LEAVE YOU FOR FIVE SECONDS AND I COME BACK TO FIND THAT YOU’RE A FATHER, YOU IGNORANT STUPID FOOL. HOW LONG DID YOU THINK YOU COULD HIDE THIS FROM ME?’ Draco froze, normally Snape just hissed and spat, but he never yelled unless he was close to loosing it, and when he did, you ran. The above indicates that Snape had most definitely lost it, and the child beside him kept him firmly fixed in his seat. He was screwed.
The occurrence inside the room of requirement hadn’t left his mind since he’d feast eyes on the boy. The circumstances in which the kid had appeared unsettled him greatly. The Room was known for granting what one needed, and what if Draco needed…
Picking Scorpius up carefully, he pulled back the covers, and put him under snugly. The boy twitched slightly, and Draco absently reached out a hand, running it soothingly through black curls. They stayed like that for a few minutes before Draco pulled his hand back as if burned, finally conscious of what he was doing.
The words sprouting from the kids mouth were laughable. As if a Malfoy would willingly shack up with any of these ignoramus inbreds. It was unthinkable. He wasn’t going to tell the kid that though, he was finally quiet. No, silence was something to be savoured, especially since Dumbledore’s office was coming into view and he was certain to get an earful from a seething Head of House.
Scorpius clapped his hands happily, before threading a hand through Draco’s larger ones and pulling him towards the herd of lions waiting in the centre of the room. He forced Draco onto his bottom, then clambered onto his lap, turning to face the Gryffindor’s.
The winter is such crystalline joy, those brilliant rays that show the uniqueness of every snowflake. Where puddles become transient skating rinks, when the sunniest of days ignites a chill where one can see their breath rise as neat and pure vapour. It is the days of quiet poetry forming in souls as if it calls to the spring flowers that will soon blossom.
‘I don’t think those apples are ripe, Malfoy’ Potter said from behind him and Draco jumped dropping the apple at once.
The boy shook his head before smiling happily, ‘that dwsen’t mawwer, at least I ave Papa,’ he beamed and before Draco knew it, tiny arms were wrapping around his waist.
Draco growled as he persisted to drag the exhausted body through the room, ‘if you’d be so kind as to remove your grubby hands from my hair Potter, that would be
‘Perhaps, the three of you would benefit from a visit to Madam Pomfrey,’ Dumbledore’s chirper voice suggested, effectively breaking Draco from his gaze.
‘My father is dead,’ he began quietly, hit with a realisation so fierce he was certain that he’d fall, ‘I
They’d already gotten most of Scorpius’ clothes from these unseemly places called retail stores without much fuss. Potter had transfigured Draco’s robes into Muggle attire, stating quote on quote that he looked like a
Draco shook his leg in an attempt to pry the small child out of his death grip, ‘detach yourself from my body at once,’ he ordered fiercely, but Scorpius just held on tighter.
A small hand slammed onto his mouth and Draco let out a muffled shriek. He pulled away the hand, giving Scorpius a pointed look, ‘what was that for?’ he asked him.
He sighed, raising to his feet, it looked like he was going to deal with two children today. As he made his way towards the door Pansy called out, ‘say hi to Scorpius for me,’ he shot her a warning glare, before turning back to the door.
The boy looked down at his ring in admiration, before lifting up a small finger so that Draco could get a closer look. His long black eyelashes fluttered as he beamed proudly, ‘m’ don’t member, but you tells me to always kweep it on.’
He was about to retort back when his eyes stopped on Weasley’s plate. It looked monstrous, pilled with sausages, eggs, toast, and bacon. He had a bowl of fruit on his left, pumpkin cake to his right, and that wasn’t even mentioning the plate of chicken at his front.
He didn’t know. But what he did know was that, whenever he saw him nothing else mattered. If he spoke to him for even a moment, the world just
I'm not too sure about this chapter, but I wanted to post an update, honest opinions please. Also, next chapter there will be sweets, and a lil bit of angst...
The silence remained for several moments and Draco was certain that they’d left when the ledge suddenly became quite claustrophobic. He looked up to tell whoever it was to
In reply the child shook his head, and before Draco knew it, his face was wet, dripping onto his robes, as drool soaked his skin. He felt his cheeks heat up, as he brought a handkerchief to his face.
Begrudgingly, Draco lowered his head once more and ignored the rage monster that threatened to explode. He whispered the words so quietly that no one but Scorpius and himself could hear. ‘I love your Daddy very much,’ he said as authentically as he could.
Potter scowled, ‘Why d’you have to be such a git, Malfoy?’ he slurred, taking yet another swing from his glass.
‘Malfoy, what the fu—’ Potter glanced at an oblivious Scorpius before continuing, ‘fudge was that about?’
Draco sat miserably on the small ledge, by the familiar window. He looked out into the distance; his mind trapped in many a thoughts. He watched intently as a single leaf fell from its place on the tree, swishing and dancing before it landed on the cold ground with a loud
Scorpius nodded and Draco let out that deep breath, only to suck it right back in when Scorpius said, ‘If you won’t whispwer den you aft to shout it.’ he demanded, pushing his plate further away from him.
He and Potter would never click, and that was just fine. He’d come into this world alone; he’d exit it just the same.
There in the centre of the common room was Scorpius, wailing as if someone had taken away his favourite toy. Granger and Weasley sat next to him doing their best to calm the boy down but to no avail. To Draco’s displeasure, a hoard of nameless Gryffindor’s stood crowded around them, some intrigued, many cooing, a few looking distastefully at the child. Draco wanted to gut those small few.
‘I want you to admit dat you wuv my Daddy.’ He announced after several minutes and Draco sucked in a large breath. Anything. He’d do virtually anything but that. He had standards and announcing his love for a most likely imaginary character was not his idea of standards.
He opened his mouth to speak but was abruptly cut off, ‘No, no. It’s my turn to speak. You’ll have yours once you’ve earnt it.’ She told him smugly, and Draco could just strangle her.
At that point Draco realised that he was fighting a losing battle, so instead of carrying on, he ran a tired hand through his hair and sighed. ‘Fine,’ he told him as he bent his head down so that his breath was gently fanning a small ear.
Draco shook his head, fighting the overwhelming urge to run and never look back, ‘Malfoy’s aren’t cut out to be father’s, just look at mine,’ he whimpered out solemnly.
Severus began and Dumbledore waved his hand lazily, ‘yes Mr Potter began the argument, and I’m sure that Mr Malfoy finished it.’ he stated firmly and Severus nodded begrudgingly.
All had finally been well, until Draco had made way for the Slytherin table. According to Scorpius, the snakes weren’t good enough, no, he wanted to play with the lions. One lion in particular. In one quick motion, Scorpius had landed on his butt, arms crossed, face scrunched, demanding to be brought to his Daddy at once.
Frantically, Draco almost sprinted towards Potter and found his nemesis small and meek, breathing slowly but shallowly. He wasn’t in the best shape. His eyes were rolling into the backs of his head, his body was tired, his face bruised. ‘Potter?’ he choked out albeit hesitantly.
because you want to get into Potter’s pants and the way to do it is playing nicey nice with his best friends.’
Potter gave him a confused look, eyes wide as he shook his head slowly, ‘I don’t remember’ he said with a goofy grin. ‘Ah! I don’t remember. I
Weasley looked fearfully at the paper towel before shooting Draco a somewhat thankful nod. He shrugged before making his way towards the door, when a low cough stopped him in his tracks.
So, you see, Draco could never be the person that Potter wanted him to be. The person that Potter deserved. Because he was still a walking ghost of his past, a victim chained to the demons that lay restlessly in his head, and Potter was
. Immediately, he started to cough, as his throat started to burn, his stomach swimming with unease. What had he just done?
was uncalled for,’ he gave Draco another smile that he was so used to seeing, before he quirked a brow, ‘a simple
Well, it seemed as though Draco playing a game. A childish, mindless, idiotic, game. He took a deep breath; the night was
There was no way in hell he was doing this again. Frantically, he fell to his knees, putting his hands gently on Scorpius’ shoulders, desperate to calm the boy.
Draco was dismayed when Potter came to sit down next to them, he was hoping that he’d fallen down the stairs or something. Well, a fella could dream…
‘I wuv London!’ he squealed looking at Potter with wide eyes, ‘pwease can we go to Tesco?’ he asked hurriedly and Potter nodded. Baffled, Draco looked between the pair completely affronted.
Collecting himself, Draco gave Potter a sharp look, ‘you seem to have taken to parenthood quickly,’ he couldn’t help but comment.
that’s not barmy,’ Pansy said and Granger nodded. ‘Anyways, where’s Potter?’ she asked casually and Draco’s blood froze.
They both sounded like a broken record, or maybe a song that had already been sung. Three days ago, and Draco’s biggest concern had been Potter. Now, it was still Potter – but sweets, tantrums and drool had just so happened to have fallen into that mix. Tantrums were definitely his biggest challenge, in all his days, he’d never come across a more spoilt child. Merlin knows where he’d gotten that from, but if he had to wager galleons, his bet would be on Potter.
‘Because I couldn’t bloody well have told him I loved him,’ he snapped frustrated. ‘Excuse me Potter, I know I’ve been a complete git to you for years, but that was only because I loved you and your rejection broke me’
Pansy laughed shallowly, as she came to sit on the leather sofa beside him, ‘even without the Malfoy ring, anyone with
‘Now, now Severus, Minerva. Boys will be boys, what we need to focus on is what to do next,’ Dumbledore chuckled. ‘I believe that thirty points taken from both Slytherin and Gryffindor is sufficient punishment?’
Still, maybe a small part of him hated to see the boy so distressed. His eyes were puffy, and his chubby cheeks were stained. It wasn’t a happy sight. He pushed that feeling deep down as he entered the Great Hall.
‘Look who it is,’ Pansy gestured to Weasley and Granger sitting comfortably on the sofa, whilst a group of eighth years danced drunkenly around them. ‘Why don’t we go and greet them.’
Draco picked him up and settled him safely on his hip, stunned at how heavy the small boy was. He pulled out his wand, muttering a quick cleaning spell before proceeding out of the room.
He scoffed, him too now pulling out his wand, mimicking Potter’s gesture. ‘Is that the best you can do?’ He prepared his stance, ready to fire a gruesome hex at the Gryffindor when…
? He could say yes. It would be frustratingly easy to say yes. To forget all his worries and enjoy himself for once.
The curly haired menace smirked and him, wavering slightly. ‘Y’know what Malfoy, if being drunk means having a good time, then I guess I’m drunk,’ he declared quite happily.
That night Draco tried his best to not think about Potter. But if his dreams were full of curly black hair, and emerald green eyes, then that was nobody’s business but his own.
‘Couldn’t have been much more than I’ve been exposed to this past day,’ he replied absently, certain that he had bared the brunt of Scorpius’ wrath and tantrums.
Blaise smiled at the small boy, ‘of course, of course. Sometimes I forget that your Papa bats for the other team,’ he joked and Scorpius glared.
Defeated, Draco let his arms fall to his sides, as he sent Potter the deadliest glare that he could muster, ‘you know what? Fuck this shit.’ He spat out as he turned on his heel and stomped towards the open doors.
Jumping, Draco looked down. A little boy was tugging on his robes, thumb still glued to his mouth. He stared up at Draco, his grey-blue eyes wide, his messy black curls sprawled atop of his head. Draco never realised how beautiful blue eyes were until they were looking up at him with that burning curiosity that every child possess.
Scorpius was now currently face down into Draco’s robes, his small legs wrapped possessively round his hips.
. They’d joked; they’d spoken civilly, and now they were sitting peacefully enjoying each other’s company. Pansy would never believe this.
The walk to Gryffindor tower was a quiet one and apart from a few scattered looks, there wasn’t much attention on the pair. It was probably due to the fact that many of the younger years were still in classes, but honestly he didn’t care all that much.
Draco brushed past her in favour of sitting the main chair that he’d dubbed the throne, it carried an aura of prestige, one that no one was to bathe in but Draco. He had hoped to push this whole Scorpius ordeal far from his mind, he was Potter’s problem now.
Scorpius continued to hit her angrily, ‘Aunt Pans’ don’t talk to my Papa like that. Tis not nice.’ He told her simply.
Draco sat back in his seat as he watched his friend gobble down the remains of her food. He pushed his half-full plate to the side; he wasn’t all that hungry anymore.
He lay the books gently in Draco’s welcoming arms as he gave him a small smile, ‘did I see you last night?’ he asked. ‘I could’ve sworn we’d interacted.’
Then the war had happened. And with it came change, one Draco had adapted to. He could no longer be Draco Lucius Malfoy, Slytherin Prince no, he was
"Mine opens when I put my wand in the key hole," Draco said. Harmony felt around the door, after alohomora didn't work. She felt a small groove at one of the sides, and when she pushed it, and put her weight on the door, it opened. His room thankfully at least smelled like he bathed regularly. She put goo onto the ceiling of his four poster bed which Fred and George invented. it would spread and seep into the wood and during the night it made the sleeper have the strangest and trippiest nightmares. Harmony put mold in his room, and hexed all the mirrors to show a hideous image of the viewer at certain angles. Lastly, she spread lice eggs all over the carpets and curtains. She felt that Blaise would be able to appreciate her handy work if he knew.
"Bloody Hell," Harmony gripped her knees hard, "I'm not bent, Ron. Get over yourself that I'm friends with Draco."
As you have been aware, the Dark Lord is not in our favor since you have become a traitor to the cause. Your mother and I are doing everything we can to keep you safe, but I fear the worst is yet to come. Your mother can no longer leave the Manor, and she is being watched by the Dark Lord or one of his subjects at all times. I do not know why this is so, but I do hope that you will come to your senses. Hogwarts is no longer safe, and the Manor can no longer be your home. I think that there is still time for your act of betrayal to be reversed, but I do not think that the Dark Lord will forgive you without consequence. For now, stay where you are.
"Because you are the greatest thing that ever happened to me." She shook her head and a wistful smile graced her lips.
"Blaise, this is really strong." Draco commented, staring at the drink. He then noticed the three empty glasses next to him, where Harmony had sat.
Draco had once thought that Muggle Studies was beneath him, that nothing worth while could actually amount from those primitives. Five days in to their vacation, and still nothing impressed him. Airplanes looked dangerous and slow, the metro was a nightmare, and the muggles were ignorant and hostile brutes.
"Today's class," Snape began in a drawl, "we will review nonverbal and wandless spell work." Harmony was at least grateful that he didn't fling axes at their faces, though his eyes were probably doing that for him. Leighton had made sure that they knew the basics of nonverbal magic, so when class began, Snape frowned as most of the students had at least some inkling on nonverbal magic. He scanned the heads, looking for something in particular, and stopped when he met Harmony's eyes. "Even more difficult than nonverbal magic is wandless magic. And more still, combining the two takes years of rigorous training and a very skilled wizard. Black and Weasley why don't the two of you demonstrate for the class on both forms of magic."
"Now Potter, this potion will make you slumber for a whole 24 hours and you may feel a slight tingling as you are immobile." Snape's sneer tripled Harry's misgivings. Snape really did have a sadistic side, but Harry uncapped the potion and downed it with a grimace from the rancid taste. Snape definitely made it as inedible as possible, and he almost could feel the mélange of little chunks of miscellaneous animal parts. As the last of the potion slipped down his throat, his eyelids leaden with sleep and he blacked out from the world.
"Well, my father is in need of a certain dark arts book in the restricted section on the library, so I was wondering if you could, uh, help me acquire it." One of Snape's eyebrows raised a smidgen.
"It's too dangerous," Dobby said, and Harmony looked crestfallen, "but Dobby will try." Harmony beamed at the elf, hugging the small creature in her arms.
As soon as she left the room, there was a pause before a cushion hit the back of his head. He looked up to see Fred and George's glowering faces. "Bloody unbelievable," George said.
"He didn't tell you anything, then." Harmony couldn't even bring herself to be angry at the truth. A few minutes later they were walking with McGonagall, trailing blankets and pillows. When they pushed through the Great Hall's doors, Harmony saw that the Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs had already occupied separate corners. McGonagall lead them to the far right, and Harmony shivered as the draft made the hundreds of floating candles flicker. She set her blanket by the wall and sat atop her pillow. Ginny set up next to her, and they watched as their house mates huddled together like a bunch of patchwork squares in quilts.
They soon arrived at a bulky brown door, and stared at its fine wood surface. "So you going to go in or what?" Draco asked.
The numbing cold began to dissipate and pain began to radiate to her limbs. She wondered if this could be comparable to a wizard hangover. There was the forming headache, the confusion of what just happened, and the overall dread that she was screwed for life.
"Draco and Harry couldn't possibly be together," Ginny said as more students stopped to watch, "For one, Draco already has a girlfriend and second, Harry's not like that."
Had things really gotten that bad? Pansy had stopped talking to him, but he had though of that as a relief. She looked positively awful. Crabe and Goyle were the same mindless brutes, so not much of a change happened there. But he had noticed Theodore become even more withdrawn. His father had broken out of Azkaban, and Draco wondered if that had set off all of their acerbic countenances. He wouldn't have thought that the quidditch game had been won, and that all of them had celebrated. Things would get a lot worse for them all.
"You're wrong," Harmony continued to smirk as Voldemort sneered, "it is because you took my blood." Harmony removed the glasses from her face and threw them to the ground. "I guess it is only fair that you see what has brought your downfall." Harmony removed the magic from her face and a girl looked back at Voldemort. The response was instantaneous.
"Interesting," Trelawny muttered while taping her chin, "a dragon will light you on fire…haven't had that one in a while, but I suppose that—." Her bottom jar dropped and began to tremble. Her eyes rolled back, exposing white as if they were the glass orbs. Trelawny stood rigid and lifted her head to the ceiling.
Upon entering the class, Ron and Harmony only saw one last empty table waiting to be claimed, unfortunately it was the one right in front of the teachers desk. A look of misgiving passed through both of their faces. She then felt the Slytherin glares and wondered when the taunting would start. Tension hung on tight muscles. Many of the green and silver marked teens looked back at Draco Malfoy to take the lead. He looked bored and uninterested at his books.
He awoke to the sun setting and casting black arms around the room. He nearly chocked when he saw purple spots on his arms, it didn't matter that they didn't hurt any more. He hoped that Theodore had been true to his word and that the pain was only at the beginning. Well Theodore was entitled for a beating regardless. Yes, one that would cast him into a coma, no, not a coma, he needed to feel the deadly pain.
There was a knock to her door and Harmony shoved everything under her bed before transfiguring her face back to Harry. "One moment," she said and pushed everything else that was girly away.
"What, done already?" Mr. Malfoy jeered. The pain in her began to boil. He stopped to behold a cabinet with Sirius's mirror propped up. She could imagine Sirius watching the enchanted mirror all day, listening to her and Draco that very night. The dread began to throb against her, wanting to burst from her. Malfoy took from that cabinet a tiara, and the anguish began to escape her.
"Oh, Harry," she whispered. He felt bad for lying, but he would tell them when he had come to terms with it. He didn't particularly like her contact just then, especially with Ron practically having a heart attack from Hermione's affectionate gesture towards him.
"He's so dead," Ginny muttered. They looked at the cliff that they would have to scale and Harmony frowned. Did any of them even have the upper body strength that it would take to reach the top? He doubted it. But then again, representing the only boy entitled him to at least be able to make it the furthest. Luna joined them from the girls' changing room with her hair swinging in a pony tail.
"Harmony, that bear is real alright," Luna said, "let's split!" They went in opposite directions and the grizzly turned its head from side to side, and continued to growl. Its eyes locked onto Harmony before it began to lumber towards her. Harmony shot spell after spell, deciding then to stop shouting the spell names audibly.
"I don't know," Harmony said, "I forgot." The shoes were only a tad bit lose and Ginny easily shrunk them.
The night before her birthday, Harmony spent her time taking a steaming bubble bath. Her fingers massaged shampoo into her short hair. It was all too surreal, but looking at her body she was irrevocably a girl. Curves were developing, and finally she had an arse. It was so embarrassing having breasts, she couldn't even look at them without a bra on, and even then it looked wrong. She knew the little bastards were conspiring to grow without any regard to her wishes. She could practically fit her entire hand around one and she really wondered why guys were crazy over them. She missed her flat chest.
"Not if he is going to treat me like a child. Professor, I don't know who else to go to." Harmony looked to him, she was too naive. And he did not wish for her to change that.
