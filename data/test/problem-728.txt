“I have some idea,” Draco reminded him. But Harry shook his head and swayed forwards, his eyes fixed on Draco’s mouth. Draco’s lips tingled in anticipation.
Potter pushed himself off the doorframe and practically prowled towards Draco. “Do you know,” he said, “I’ve been craving a cup of Earl Grey all evening.”
“Don’t touch yourself,” Draco gasped. The connection between them was growing ever shakier as Draco’s control deteriorated. “Come like this.”
“Besides,” Harry says. He’s got a weird expression on his face. Maybe the beer is getting to him too. “A
Draco can barely feel his own face, but from the worry in Potter’s voice, Draco’s horror is evident. Potter’s eyes slide to the Daydream Charm box – to the incantation on the second scroll – to Draco’s disobedient wand.
“To be fair, she’s read a lot of books,” Harry said, and grinned again. “It is nonsense, though, I agree; I already trust you. But it might be nice to show Ron that you’re not an evil bastard trying to brainwash me. If one awkward conversation makes him shut up about you, I’ll put myself through that.” He paused. “Or would it get in the way of this tragic thing you have going on, drinking alone on a Tuesday night?”
“I also said he’s a wanker and a sneaky little shit,” I remind him. “I’m not about to steal him away, I promise. He’s not my type.” Though Merlin knows what my type actually is. Apart from “my friends” and “good arses”, I have no idea.
Harry doesn’t wait for him to finish. He leans forward and swallows Malfoy whole. Malfoy’s cock is swollen with blood, thick with it, and the proximity of it – inside Harry’s mouth, so, so close to his teeth – is torture. Malfoy lets out a low moan, digs his fingers into Harry’s hair. Harry struggles to be careful, for now – covers his teeth with his lips, concentrates on lavishing attention on Malfoy. His blood is so much richer when he’s worked up like this.
Wow, uh, ok. I’ve never gotten a formal apology over text before. Did it take you…8 hours to write that?
“Mmhm, I don’t know you after five years of this stupid bullshit, spending basically every weekend loitering around abandoned factories and garbage heaps...you
!” Harry bites back, sharper than he intended. “I mean—I’m sorry—but I feel like you’re sacrificing your own happiness for them. Again! I know you love them, but after everything they’ve put you through. Everything they asked of you. You deserve the chance to make your own choices and live your own life, Draco.”
But the woman never finished. The ground exploded in a fit of energy, throwing each of them to opposite sides.
Not that Draco didn’t think he wasn’t worthy of their admiration—honestly, he had harmonic features and an amazing body—but he couldn’t see what was so interesting about his own figure to grant him so many wide eyes.
The car took a wild—and potentially deadly—turn. Draco stole a terrified glance in Potter’s direction, who didn’t seem to mind or be worrying too much about his perilous driving.
But, despite Potter’s best intentions on helping Draco, their prior research proved unproductive. Potter wasn’t able to find a single thing on “Olhos de Demônio”, as he assured Draco was the Portuguese translation of one plant, and that the other was likely wrong because there wasn’t a single register about it. Draco was torn between believing the name was wrong or Potter’s translation was.
before he stared at the mass of a guilty and depressed man hanging onto him. “Merlin’s sake, Potter, forget it already,” Draco snapped, only because it seemed easier than to let them go down that road. It was too late for that now, it didn’t matter anymore who had hurt who. They had both changed, and they were both trying to be better. This was true for Draco, and he hoped it was true for Potter.
“In the beginning, night belonged to giant serpent Boiúna, that lived at the bottom of the river,” Saci started, and suddenly Draco knew that wasn’t the answer he was hoping for. But, after hearing so many of the tales Tainara had told him, all Draco could do was hope he could get something out of that. Also, he didn’t want to test his luck with the hat, if that was all Saci was willing to offer him. “Her daughter had just married and wanted to make love to her new husband, but she could not. Not without night.
. Somehow, Draco computed the exact moment the magic came out from the tip of his wand, purple energy crackling in the air, luring Jurupari to him.
His research, his trying to win the school over. It was all over. There was no turning back from this. Draco was even less welcomed here now. He had done it again. He had fucked everything up. And now he, Harry—and everyone else here—were paying for it.
“Salazar…” Draco said, eying the shot warily. He downed it at once, though, because there wasn’t really an excuse he could use to avoid the experience as Harry stared at him with those round, pleading eyes. How could he say no? Draco’s body wasn’t built to deny Potter anything.
Eyes trained on the small sprig sprouted, Draco closed his fingers around the seed he still held. He had never seen that black and red-dotted mushroom before, but he knew it was the one he needed for his almost abandoned research.
Potter drank his own, scowling all throughout it, to Draco’s gratification. He then faced Draco, cheeks pleasantly flushed and eyes glinting. “So, what did you do while I was away?”
Harry pulled him, fingers on Draco’s nape, intertwined with his now short hair. “Yeah. No one will miss us.”
The coconut was still in his possession, but some reservations prevented Draco from opening it. That was when he started hearing it. The indistinct noises coming from inside the thing. Low growls, he could swear, leaves rustling against the wind that sang through cracks he could not see on the surface of the thing. It was alive and cold, and it scared him more than anything else in that place.
Harry shoved the chair back, getting up in one jump. “Who would do that, Draco? You’re being paranoid!”
Potter—who was back to Potter now—levelled a smug grin at Draco. “You’re drooling,” he said, openly laughing at Draco’s first reaction to Castelobruxo.
“Not all of them believe in it, of course. It’s an indigenous ritual,” Tainara continued, as they picked up two coconut cups filled with something dark and thick from a table in the corner, “but it became tradition here in the school.”
The corners of his lips tipped down. Draco put his watch away, eyes still level with the clerk’s. He hadn’t even realised he was staring so intently at the woman’s impassive features—there was just
“Just stop. Listen…” Harry said softly, fingers lowering to touch Draco’s hand, leaving a warm trail on his skin. “Can you feel it?”
Potter barely acknowledged his student before grabbing Draco’s wrist and dragging him back to the car.
“Better. Thank you for bringing me back.” Draco pulled a chair and sat by Harry’s side. “Saci said I drank something called ayahuasca? I don’t know when, I don’t… If someone gave it to me, I don’t remember it.” Draco didn’t want to accuse anyone, but him being drugged like that didn’t sit right.
deeply, but the air, stale and bitter, didn’t reach his lungs. The magic buzzed around him, but it was dark and oppressive, and it was trying to hurt him so much it made little sense that he felt Potter in that magic.
by himself. It was too hard working those Muggle contraptions, and it didn’t have the same appeal when Harry wasn’t by his side to hear his opinions about the soap. Draco would make up an ending for the story in his mind and it would be perfect.
Harry laughed, shaking his head. “You know, I never pictured you to be the nature type.” His hand left a burning desire at Draco’s back when he went back to the car.
, Draco had asked. But no, Cuca, or rather Lua, was something different. She’d been around for centuries, Tainara couldn’t specify how long, and she was known by Brazilian folks to devour naughty children. Somehow Draco could picture that.
Comprehension took a second longer to dawn in Harry’s expression, but it did as soon as he caught sight of Draco’s glare. “Oh,” Potter sighed, and added abashedly, “I think… the school doesn’t want you reading what’s in there?”
“It was long ago, when two Indigenous people wished to have children,” she started, slowed by translating the text. Draco remained silent and patient. “They asked Tupã to make it possible. He’s the god that created the universe and light, and he lives in the sun. The sun is Guaraci, who gave the school and all Indigenous people fire and magic. You can call it Fire of Guaraci too, the one in front of the school.” Tainara glanced at him again and seemed satisfied to see Draco’s attentive expression. Draco didn’t want to call the fucking fire anything, really, but he didn’t point that out.
Draco had said nothing yet, but the woman simply knew where his reservations lay. He wondered if her midnight eyes could see inside his soul, or if just about anyone who came here behaved the same unquieting way.
But this—here, now—was a different kind of hurt. Because Harry had deliberately chosen his words to slice, even if he didn’t mean them. He had used them to purposefully hurt Draco, and he did.
Draco frowned, closing his eyes again, too drowsy to make out what she was talking about. “You mean Lua, the Potions master who hates me?”
Draco had never been one for outdoors, but flying was different. Flying was about control and release, about him and the broom; the surrounding air, the ground under his feet, the clouds, the canopy and the leaves he touched with the tip of his fingers when floating above the trees.
“Don’t worry,” she snorted, finally releasing his arm as they stepped to the edge of the forest. “That’s where I come in.”
!” he screamed. The pull of the forest protecting one of its own, resisting his spell, was almost too much and Draco finally felt, for a second, the connection of that place.
“What…” Draco started, his voice cracked. He tried again. “What can I do? How can we… There has to be something. Harry can’t be.”
Draco stumbled back, grey orbs on the hand still firmly tied to his forearm. Harry followed him, eyes closed, breathing Draco in, until Draco’s knees gave in to the couch behind him, his body falling on the padded surface with a soft thud.
Draco scowled at him, raising an eyebrow while climbing into the car with the utmost care so as not to wrinkle his robes. This entire trip didn’t seem as appealing to him anymore.
“I don’t… I don’t remember,” Harry started weakly, confusion in his features, eyes unfocused. “I was talking to Tai and then…”
Draco saw, then, the bright yellow tendrils of light coming out of his own chest, chasing something up high. His eyes went immediately to the end of the beautiful lines, unsure if they were really there or were just figments of his imagination.
It all sounded ominous somehow, and Draco decided it was best if he just remained silent. Maybe the boy, Curupira, wouldn’t even notice his presence.
“There are animals playing cards… This is it, I’m out of my mind,” Draco muttered. He was ready to turn around and be lost in the forest forever when his stalker-parrot flew from his shoulder, landing on the stranger in white instead. It was a good thing that the animal finally left him alone, but the pang of betrayal still stung.
Before, Draco would feel narked by his school nemesis’ cool demeanour, certain that Potter’s self-absorption meant nothing but arrogance and self-worth. He knew better now. He had known better right after the war.
He looked like a boy, though Draco remembered what Francisca had told him about not mistaking Saci’s appearance for true age. Saci had rich black skin, short, thick hair, and was wearing a red dungaree that only covered his lower part. Saci had only one leg and despite Draco’s command for him to stop, he kept bouncing on this leg as if he couldn’t stop himself from fidgeting. Saci wasn’t attacking him, so Draco figured that was as close as he would get to being obeyed.
“Some of them, yeah, every week, at least. They help me with classes when they feel like it. These creatures are a bunch of lazy sods.” A blithe chuckle escaped her lips as Francisca raised her head. “Ah, just one more thing.” She shoved a hand in her trouser’s pocket and pulled out a rustic tobacco pipe big enough to make Draco consider whether there was an expansion charm in the pocket. “I always keep one of those in hand, in case they decide to grace us with their presence. This here”—she twirled the pipe in her fingers, before handing it to Draco—“pleases most of them. Caipora, Curupira and Saci, at least. I’m never sure about the
Potter guided him through a spacious kitchen, a living room that would make his and Martin’s small flat envious, and at least four bedrooms, all while ignoring two closed doors. The place was beautiful, garnished in warm colours and simplistic fixtures. Some obvious attempts at decoration had been made, however unlikely it was that Potter had accomplished that rustic and comfortable composition on his own.
“That’s what we call Castelobruxo here.” At Draco’s silence—which, to be fair, was unusual—Potter continued, “The school was founded by indigenous people around the same time as Hogwarts. The Portuguese arrived only five hundred years later, so… there was no Portuguese language here before that. It means
“You are not,” she said after a long while. Her mouth moved with a bit of delay in the image, opposite from her voice. “You’ve been lost before, and you’ve been through worse before, Draco.”
“I’m so lost,” he said, throat dry, after talking for almost an hour non-stop, spilling his guts out in front of the hearth.
compete against each other in a giant (really, big, fucking, giant with giant cars and statues and hundreds of people in costumes dancing samba) parade during carnival every year in Rio de Janeiro.
Draco’s eyes found Harry’s, green again, albeit distant, full of sorrow and pain. It didn’t matter. Draco would help him heal. Draco would be by his side. He’d never leave Harry again. Or let Harry leave.
Just then, before any of them said anything else, Potter clapped his hands together. “Okay, Tai! We gotta get going before it gets dark. Draco’s staying at my place for the time being. He’ll stay as a visitor until he wins the school over. I believe I can count on you to help him, also, right? Do you need a ride back?”
His fingers tightened around the small coconut and Draco screamed, much like Harry had that first time in the forest. “You won’t scare me away!” He doubted his cry could cut through the walls of noise the intense wind provoked, but felt certain that whoever needed to hear that would. Draco was not someone to be scared away as easily as those creatures might believe. “I’m not going anywhere and I
“Will you just calm down and rest for a bit?” Draco proposed, eyes closed and protected from the blinding veil of the sunlight, Machado lazily perched on his shoulder.
“Stop thinking about it,” Malfoy insisted, his disapproval rolling over Harry in cinnamon-spiced waves.
Harry cocked his head, considering. Whenever he’d imagined what a Death Eater might look like, he hadn’t pictured anything like Healer Malfoy.
“I can’t wait,” Draco said with relish. “Which brings us back to my original question: Potter, it’s six o’clock on Friday December 22nd. I’m leaving this godforsaken place and not coming back until January. Are you coming or not? I want to wish Madam Tamsworth a merry Christmas on the way out, see if I can’t get one more of her mince pies. You know how I like her mince pies.”
“He’s right,” he says, getting to his feet. “One mouthful of this Grindylow piss is quite enough. You’ve got Floo powder with you, Weasley?”
Malfoy’s faux-innocence caused Harry’s tenuous control to break. He strode up to Malfoy and shoved the letter at his bare chest so forcefully that Malfoy almost fell backwards.
Harry doesn’t expect Draco’s mouth to twist into a triumphant smile. “Exactly,” he says, and looks at Harry expectantly. When Harry continues to gape, Draco rolls his eyes. “And here I thought you’d be less thick now you’re a professor.”
As the fact that he’d fallen asleep on the sofa last night proved, his attempts at boxing up his thoughts had been less than successful. He had tried, really, but it was so
And where had Malfoy learned how to cast that concealment spell, anyway? It was specific to the Auror department, one of the last things taught during the training programme. They were explicitly told to never share the incantation with anyone outside the department, not even with other Magical Law Enforcement employees.
Harry knew – he always knew – how many doors there were, but he looked around and counted again anyway.
But Harry couldn’t stop thinking about him. Hadn’t been able to stop thinking about him for weeks. Months. And now Malfoy had admitted to wanting Harry back – it seemed like the worst kind of punishment to not be able to have this, to not feel Malfoy pressed against him, to not have Malfoy’s long, graceful fingers twine with his own. There had to be a way of having that that didn’t put either of them at risk.
“I remember the houses, yeah,” Harry confirmed. He picked at the arm of the chair. “I remember what classes are taught and I can tell you what floors the common rooms are on. I just – I can’t picture any of it. I don’t know how to actually get anywhere. They took me to Hogwarts to see if it would trigger anything. I couldn’t even find my way to the Great Hall.”
To test whether his memory loss had affected his magic, Harry had had to cast a lot of minor charms in the last few months, levitating quills and lighting candles over and over like a first year trapped in a pre-exam stress dream. But he hadn’t done anything like this – this pure, instinctive rush, his eyes catching Malfoy’s slightest movement and cutting him off, their spells a rapid back-and-forth, their bodies completely in sync. It was such a new, joyful feeling that he couldn’t stop a shout of laughter escaping him.
I wish he would stop moving. He’s going to wake Harry up. And, more importantly, the feeling of his cock rubbing against me is making my insides squirm.
Bloody hell. I can’t stop my gaze from flicking back to Malfoy, re-evaluating him in light of this new information. Prissy, snotty little Draco, a freak in bed. Who would have guessed?
“Excellent.” Malfoy finished fiddling with his sleeves, straightened the front of his robes and stood in position across the room from Harry, his wand raised. He quirked an eyebrow. “Whenever you’re ready.”
Malfoy cleared his throat. “It’s not uncommon to consider a repeated Legilimency connection to be an intimate experience,” he said, visibly struggling to summon his usual professional manner.
I’m amused by my extremely correct interpretation of Malfoy’s drinking habits and I turn to share my hilarious observations with Harry, but he’s looking at me strangely. I raise an eyebrow and wipe my mouth in case I’ve got a moustache of beer foam.
Slightly panicked, Harry wove through umbrellas and shopping bags and teenagers gliding on wheeled trainers. He was following his gut rather than any specific memory or sense of direction, a move he knew Hermione and Malfoy both would be outraged at—and so he felt a savage shot of victory when the cafés, pubs and clothes shops gave way to a tree-lined street and a set of imposing metal gates.
God, but the withdrawal felt so good it was almost painful, and the first push back in sent new waves of pleasure crashing over him. Harry allowed himself several long, slow thrusts, closing his eyes, pressing his forehead against Malfoy’s leg, letting Malfoy’s quiet noises send shivers down his spine.
And, indeed, the threads of light that had been wrapped around their clasped hands had disappeared. In their place were two simple silver-and-gold rings: one on Harry’s third finger; one on Draco’s.
And yet, at this first sign that his libido might not be as absent as he’d thought, Harry found that his legs automatically parted. He didn’t need to think before his hand dipped into his underwear, wrapped around his cock and squeezed. He hissed at the contact – new, familiar, exciting. His other thumb hooked into the waistband of his pants and freed his dick from its confines. He bit his lip. His eyes fluttered closed.
“Fuck,” Harry said. He ran a finger through the spill, traced it around Malfoy’s hole, and pushed his finger inside. Malfoy whimpered, widened his legs. “Fuck.”
“How can I not be preoccupied with it? Nobody has ever recovered their memory after six months, Brisley said.”
“How kind of him!” Healer Brisley beamed. “I’m sure he’ll pop along for a quick visit later. Now, I’ll just give you a mo to get changed into something comfy, then we’ll get you all set up.” She wiggled her fingers and left.
Draco braces himself for one last hit. “Potter,” he says slowly, because Potter is an idiot who needs things spelling out. “I know it’s a struggle for you, but think it through. I literally thought you were a magical manifestation of my fantasies. Everything we did was something I wanted to do.”
He arrived to a Leaky Cauldron that was notably quieter than usual. The reason for this became obvious almost immediately. Malfoy – pale and bedraggled, but with twin splodges of red high on his pointy cheekbones – stood by the bar glaring defiantly at Tom, who glared right back.
By round four, Harry stopped trying to resist. He surrendered himself to cool Earl Grey memories and hot spiced fantasies. His arms and thighs and buttocks ached. His whole body dripped with sweat. He still couldn’t stop.
into Draco. Draco’s head reeled, and he held Harry’s gaze as he lowered himself again, taking Harry deeper, deeper, deeper
But, as Harry considered the issue while Ron and Hermione’s quarrel intensified, he found that he didn’t feel deterred from meeting Healer Malfoy again tomorrow. If anything, it was the opposite – he was almost excited to see what all the fuss was about.
Malfoy’s eyes were molten silver. Perhaps it was just the habit of having to maintain eye contact with him during their sessions, but Harry couldn’t look away. If he were to cast
you get here? I told you, you should have come with us, we could have shared a taxi. Honestly. Keep still.”
But no matter how many friends and family members with whom Harry exchanged presents, hugs and laughter over the Christmas holidays, he couldn’t help but resent the time away from work.
Malfoy licked his lips, but he said nothing. His neck was bared and his breath was coming in quiet, sharp bursts, but he wasn’t resisting. Even the book still lay in his hands, one finger loosely held in place to mark the page.
Despite his best efforts, Harry is swept away. He does what he can, fights to keep his body frozen, but he can’t stop himself from opening his mouth for more. Can’t stop himself from loosening one arm so his hand can rise to Malfoy’s waist, push up his shirt and rest – just rest, but trembling from the effort of it – against the soft skin of Malfoy’s hip.
Draco hadn’t realised that his pace had faltered, that his hips had stilled, but Potter is peering over his shoulder, checking that Draco is okay as if Draco is worth something. The half of his face that Draco can see is flushed. His fringe is sweaty, sticking to his head. He’s yanked off his glasses and his eyes are incredible – so vivid despite the swollen black of his pupils. For a moment, Draco can’t do anything but stare.
The library swirled away and resettled to form the familiar shape of the inside of the Leaky Cauldron. Harry was sitting next to Malfoy at a different table than usual, but could easily identify a few fellow regulars: the barman, a white-haired old witch who shook Harry’s hand enthusiastically every time she saw him, the two bald-headed warlocks who invariably sat huddled over the table in the far corner.
The trouble was, Draco had known two different Harry Potters. They were remarkably similar, given the circumstances, but still undeniably different people.
Harry is sitting on said four-poster, one leg against the navy sheets, bent at the knee. His jacket lies in a heap next to his discarded shoes. Malfoy stands next to him, still in his tailored grey robes and shiny black boots. Both of them look up as I emerge from the fire.
him. “Do you think I’d’ve gone along with it if I wasn’t into it? Now you’re the one not thinking it through. Do you know how many people try to jump me on a daily basis? If I let all of them fuck me, you’d have definitely heard about it.”
“Sorry.” She sniffed and pulled away, wiping her eyes. “You gave us such a fright. I’d forgotten what it was like, worrying about you.” At that, she hit him sharply on the arm.
Before Harry could process Luna’s bizarre words, she had ushered him through the front door. He found himself in a small but extremely grand foyer. The next set of doors were made from a rich wood with dark iron fixtures that reminded him jarringly of the sinister curlicues on the antique iron chest that held the marriage contract. On the other side of the doors, he could hear a low murmur of voices. For a second, he imagined himself walking through them and up the aisle as a bride would do, the guests standing as he walked in, and cold dread locked his limbs in place. But he and Malfoy had agreed—neither of them were doing that. They’d each take a side entrance and appear at the front. No aisle parade. No wedding march. No organ. It was hardly a win, but Harry would take whatever he could get.
The hot flame of Harry’s anger warped into something that felt suspiciously like hurt. Everyone had been so preoccupied with whether Harry could get along with Malfoy that it hadn’t occurred to him to wonder whether Malfoy was struggling to get along with him.
“Merlin, Potter.” Malfoy put down his quill and ran a hand through his hair. It fell easily back into place. “For a moment, I was impressed that losing your memory had taught you to use social pleasantries.”
“A comforting space.” Harry tried to think of the last time he felt comforted. Nothing sprang to mind.
Harry shook his head rapidly. “No, no, nothing like that.” He fought to appear casual. “I just – I meant to ask – Can I use the Pensieve?”
.” Harry’s hissed curse slid into a breathy laugh. “I can’t believe how much hearing you talk turns me on. I think I’ve developed a Healer kink.”
“You think I shouldn’t open it.” Harry wasn’t worried about not waking up – the rest would be quite nice, honestly – but he understood Malfoy’s hesitation. If their roles were reversed, Harry wouldn’t want Malfoy to turn back into a person who hated him, either.
Harry’s gut clenched. But clearly he hadn’t hidden his feelings particularly well if Draco had wrapped
Harry gazed around while he waited for Malfoy to finish. Although they were similar sizes, Malfoy’s office was significantly tidier than Healer Brisley’s, and a lot less friendly. All the furniture was made from the same dark, polished wood, not a stray folder – nor even a speck of dust – in sight. The large window, framed by deep blue curtains, looked out to the Muggle offices across the road from St Mungo’s. If Harry squinted, he could make out rows of desks, on which sat shiny computers and sad-looking plants.
“First rule of safewords, Potter: they have to be memorable.” Malfoy smirked, pale eyes glinting, then seemed to catch himself. He cleared his throat. “So. How did you get on with visualising a physical space in your mind?”
The image was easy to bring up, and the Malfoy in front of him vanished. He was replaced by a version of Malfoy standing next to Harry in the circular stone room inside Harry’s head. They had only introduced representations of themselves within their mental spaces three days before. It was still incredibly odd, seeing Malfoy in surroundings that Harry had dreamt up.
Hermione’s hand found Ron’s thigh again. “Draco,” she said warmly. “Harry has told us so much about your sessions with him; they sound fascinating. Please, do sit down.”
Malfoy’s expression was almost pained. “I meant it when I said that the memories that come to the forefront of one’s mind during exercises like this are not necessarily a reflection of one’s true feelings. But if you do have doubts about my suitability, I am not the right person for you to be working with. It’s not too late to explore other options. There are other people who could do this with you.”
It’s only the fine gold lettering on the back of the box that identifies its origin: a simple, elegant
—which gave Draco the crucial few minutes he needed. By the time Potter had dismissed the waiter with a charming smile that didn’t sit right on his face, Draco had managed to take a deep breath, straighten his back, and fix his expression into one of polite professionalism.
“Yeah, unfortunately.” Ron rubbed his chin. “Merlin’s tit. I haven’t seen him for about eight years. He’s a Healer now? I’d never have guessed that one.”
“Come for me, Malfoy,” Harry growled, and Malfoy let out a cry, tossed his head backwards and did just that, his legs tightening around Harry, his hips pushing upwards, his dick coming and coming and coming, thick strings of it landing over his chest, his stomach, coating Harry’s hand.
“God, no. But I doubt it’ll happen, anyway. There’s not really anybody we’d trust to not go blabbing to
Draco forces a smirk and allows himself another indulgence. “Will it make you feel better if I say I think you’re a self-important dickhead?”
Then he grabs Potter’s wrist, yanks it upwards, pins it above Potter’s head. Potter makes a small noise of surprised arousal that Draco is going to be thinking about for the rest of his life.
He trudged downstairs and made his own tea – a loose-leaf Earl Grey he’d picked up a fortnight ago – to the distant sound of Kreacher’s wails from one of the destroyed spare bedrooms. Harry winced. At least that apology would be easier – he’d learned on his first day that the way to Kreacher’s heart was the honour of a job that served the House of Black. Harry would get him to strengthen the protection charms around the fireplace or something. He’d be back to normal in no time.
“We’re not here to try to trigger your memory,” Malfoy reminded him. Harry tensed; he’d forgotten that Malfoy would be able to hear his thoughts when their minds were linked like this. “You’re in my mind so you can identify my mental presence to better know your own. Remember to take note of what you can feel.”
“I’m not starting anything without Malfoy,” Harry warned Ron and Hermione as he shrugged out of his robes. He didn’t miss the loaded glance they exchanged.
He doesn’t need to breathe, but he’s panting – an automatic, human response. He wants to drag his nails over Malfoy’s skin and watch the blood blossom to the surface. He wants to lift Malfoy – it’s so easy to lift him now, and Malfoy whimpers at every display of inhuman strength – and take him, fuck him, bite him, while Malfoy clings to him, not able to escape, not wanting to even if he could.
“Is there anything different than usual?” Malfoy asked. “Anything that you experienced in the library, or on the Quidditch pitch?”
It didn’t make sense. Malfoy had just said – he’d just said, hadn’t he, that he hadn’t done the raiding and the cursing. He hadn’t been a real Death Eater. Not a proper one. Not one that had – that had–
“I know,” Harry agreed fervently. “I never thought you would actually – It feels like I’ve been wanting it forever.”
Their most recent argument was still ongoing. Ginny had wanted to spend some time away from London, just the two of them. They had both earned a summer holiday, she said, how about they go somewhere nice? Someone on the team had told her about this great place with a beautiful lake almost as big as the one at Hogwarts. Wouldn’t it be nice to get away from the oppressive halls of Grimmauld Place?
Slowly, Malfoy pointed his wand at Harry. Despite his flushed cheeks and his shallow breathing, his hand was steady. “Are you sure?” he asked.
Harry took him in one final time – stretched out on the bed, cleaned and healed but visibly, undeniably fucked. Then he turned, grabbed some Floo powder and stepped into the flames.
The late hour and the rumbling in Harry’s stomach drove him to the kitchen. Kreacher had dinner ready – a slab of unspecified meat and cold mushy peas. Harry ate it without complaint, and made sure to mention how the protection charms on the fireplace could use refreshing. Kreacher’s snout-like nose twitched with interest, but he said nothing. Harry didn’t mind. He’d wear him down.
Harry wraps a hand around the base of his dick and aims it at my mouth, much more forcefully than before. “Suck it,” he demands. “Suck my cock, Ron.”
Harry lifted his head and looked downwards. Malfoy held his eyes as he slid his mouth all the way down, until Harry could feel the tightness of Malfoy’s throat swallowing around him.
“You remember—” Harry paused to bite Draco’s bottom lip, to suck it briefly into his mouth. “You remember last time, in your office? I said I’d Apparate us to my bedroom.”
Harry lifted his head from his hand and quickly replayed Hermione’s words in his head. “Yeah, definitely,” he said, nodding. “Much more promising.”
“I–” Ron glanced at Hermione, who continued to stare at her tea like it was silently imparting great wisdom. “Okay,” he said. “Yeah, you’re right. I will do.”
“No, no matter,” Draco said, as if he took Harry’s apology to be genuine. He pulled his hands from the sink and looked around for a towel to dry them on. When he seemed to be struggling, Harry levitated the one dangling from the doorknob over to him.
Potter raises himself with some difficulty, his arms trembling. He sits up and leans into Draco, resting his forehead on Draco’s cheek, soft and loose and affectionate. He wraps his hand around Draco’s and aims the wand at Draco’s palm. “
“But I–” Harry glanced at Parvati, who looked supremely unsurprised at the intrusion. “I wanted to talk. Our meeting yesterday evening was – really illuminative.”
Harry let his head fall back against the bedroom wall and groaned. God, what a mess. He needed to apologise to everyone – especially to Malfoy. He had to hope that if he grovelled enough, Malfoy would forgive him.
“‘Petty teenage rivalries’?” Harry repeated. “So … what? We weren’t pals with him in school? Was he better than you in the official Hogwarts chess rankings or something?”
It was another sleepless night for Harry. He was consumed by Malfoy. He was overwhelmed by him, by his fantasies, by the thought that
“This doesn’t feel real,” Harry murmured, still mesmerised by the movement of Draco’s cock in his fist. In and out. Twist. In and out. Twist. “Tell me it’s real.”
“You’re so hot,” he murmurs into my mouth. “So fucking big and hot. I want you to fuck me in a hundred different ways. I want you to—mmm—to pound into me so hard I can’t sit down for a week.”
“You know,” Potter says hesitantly, still not looking at him. “If I cast that charm, I’d probably see you, too.”
Potter is still frowning up at him – and is still very, unnervingly, solid. Fifty more minutes: imagine! He needs to make sure.
Draco swallowed and, in a desperate attempt to regain control over the conversation, launched into an inane anecdote about Jinky, the house-elf assigned to the fourth floor at St Mungo’s. Potter watched him in that same unnervingly intense way, then eventually offered a story about his own elf’s unhealthy attachment to a portrait of Draco’s Great-Aunt Walburga. Their collective repertoire of elf-related banter carried them through dessert. It had been—something chocolaty, maybe. No—there had been strawberries. Or—some kind of mousse, perhaps?
A heavy weight thunked onto his chest. Suddenly, instead of floating, he felt untethered, like the string tying him to reality had snapped in two.
“Malfoy,” Ron clarified. Harry’s head throbbed again. “He’s been here every night, but he left for work a few hours ago. He looked like shit, too. Clearly he’s not used to missing his beauty sleep.” Ron chuckled. Harry looked back at the ceiling.
“Fuck, I can’t – can’t balance,” Draco whined, tilting a bit too far backwards on Harry’s next inward thrust and having to right himself immediately.
Harry may have been able to – barely – keep his thoughts locked away, but found he had somewhat less control over his actions. He couldn’t stop his eyes from lingering, couldn’t stop the shiver of pleasure that crept over him when Malfoy slid into his head, couldn’t stop himself from making unthinkingly flirtatious remarks when Malfoy said something that Harry’s overworked brain interpreted as vaguely suggestive. Sometimes on those occasions, Malfoy would retort, smirking, his eyes dark and hot and full of promise. But then he’d remember himself, would clear his throat and lace his fingers together like a cage to keep Harry out, and continue with the session as if nothing had happened.
He’d meant to leave quickly, but something in Malfoy’s ashen face made him stay and explain. He told it all—the Three Brothers, the Hallows, the Wand. As he talked, Malfoy softened. Harry relaxed. They both leaned closer.
“I’m telling the truth,” he insisted. He tugged at the bindings around his wrists. “Why would I get involved in an Auror case? What motivation could I possibly… Hold on, what are you doing? You’re not leaving?” he said sharply.
The spells were only vaguely familiar to Harry. Perhaps it was that that made them so appealing. Perhaps it was the way they fell from Malfoy’s mouth, his clipped accent a contrast to his hoarse voice, his swollen lips. Perhaps it was simply what they implied: Malfoy was preparing himself for Harry to fuck him.
“Okay,” Malfoy repeated. “Now, hold the image steady and open your eyes. I’m going to cast as soon as you do.”
“I knew something was weird!” Potter scans the mess of clothes on the floor for his pants and tugs them on. Draco should get dressed too – he’s still standing there, naked and frozen – but he can’t – What has he done – He can’t breathe – How can all of that have been real – How can he have
It didn’t sound real. Then again, they were standing inside an imaginary room inside Harry’s head. Who was Harry to say that there hadn’t been another invisible door there the whole time?
Ron didn’t look up from the Detonator when Hermione sat next to him, but he turned his head to accept her kiss on the cheek.
“Right.” Harry gingerly lay back on the bed. Now he was getting used to it, the pain wasn’t so bad. It hurt, obviously – a white hot knife cleaving his forehead open – but he’d had worse. The aftermath of Oliver Wood’s aforementioned thirtieth birthday had felt pretty similar.
A safeword? I pull away from Draco’s mouth to ask what’s going on—but Harry answers me without words. His gentle finger hardens into a point and presses against Draco’s rim. There’s resistance, then I feel it give way, and Harry’s finger slips inside Draco. Slips alongside my cock.
“I want to share another theory with you.” The beam of sunlight that had filled the office had been swallowed by clouds. The flush from their kiss, from their duel, had faded from Malfoy’s skin. He was very white.
“Fuck him. I want you.” If the tightening of his grip was any indication, Malfoy caught the double meaning.
“That’s the flag of Switzerland, right?” Harry asked innocently. “Though the watch was a bit grubby.”
A warm, pleased feeling wrapped around him for a second, and Harry shivered; he didn’t think it had come from him. Strangely, the sensation of being able to feel someone else’s emotions was not as unnerving as it should have been.
Harry locked eyes with Malfoy, and could see no sign of Malfoy’s earlier impatience. When Malfoy cast the spell, his voice was calm, smooth. The cool spiced bergamot of his mind flowing into Harry’s was becoming more familiar by the day. How had Harry’s fifteen-year-old self thought having someone in his head was unpleasant?
“Malfoy,” Potter says weakly, his fingertips hardening to nails against Draco’s scalp, and the sound shoots through Draco, sends heat rushing down his spine. In one swift movement, Draco yanks down Potter’s underwear. Potter’s prick is thick and pink and hard – and hardens further under Draco’s greedy gaze.
“It’s a term Muggles used to use to mean potions,” Hermione said quietly, mindful of the curly-haired Muggle. She led the way through the unassuming iron gate. Harry glanced at the man and his soft-looking hair again before following. “The blurred line between what they call medicine and what we call potions is fascinating – especially in the past. Not so much now, of course.”
“Hm?” It took a moment for Hermione’s words to make sense. “Oh – no. We didn’t actually do any Mind Magic.”
“I’ve heard that, sometimes, a Legilimens doesn’t actually need to maintain eye contact.” Harry’s voice was a bit too casual, but Draco was too tired and satisfied to comment.
Messy and and unbeta'd, written in 15 mins. (Usually it takes me like 3 days to write a drabble? so)
I can’t move. I’m completely fucking stunned by it all—by the way it feels, by the fact that Draco is letting us, that I’m doing this with
The apology had obviously taken some effort. Harry looked at his friend’s stupid remorseful red face and something untangled deep inside him.
“I’d encourage you to keep a diary of similar thoughts and feelings you have,” Malfoy said, sitting back down and tapping his own notebook in demonstration. “It may be easier to thread together what inspires them when they’re seen as a group.” He glanced at Harry, then quickly looked away again. He laced his fingers together.
I still don’t know what Draco is asking, but triumph flares through me on his behalf—that is, until Harry gets off the bed, leaving my chest cold and my mouth empty.
” he said. “You’re not supposed to return them after you’ve used them once. In fact, it’s considered rather rude if you do.”
“I’ve wanted you for years,” Malfoy said with a gasp as Harry twisted his hand sharply. “I realised in eighth year, when you hexed that snotty Ravenclaw who insulted me. Do you remember?”
Harry thrust upwards again helplessly. The drag of his cock inside Draco’s slick, tight hole was incredible, but much better were the noises that Draco was making, the way he threw his head back and let his eyes slide closed, the way his cock bobbed and leaked onto Harry’s stomach.
Potter’s face breaks into a grin. “Well,” he says, reaching out a hand to Draco. Draco takes it. “Like I said, Terry and Anthony won’t be back ’till six. Why don’t you find out?”
) was completely unacceptable—so he ignored Potter entirely and summoned the waiter with a flick of his finger.
Together, with a lot of wincing and shuffling, and a few more cleaning charms, they eased Draco up. They collapsed back on the bed, side by side. Not touching.
He came stronger than he’d done in years, forcing his cock as deep into Malfoy’s arse as it would go. Malfoy was still twitching beneath him, gripping his shoulders, gasping filth and encouragement as Harry panted and swore. He was still seeing stars behind his eyelids when he collapsed, aching and exhausted, sprawled half on top of Malfoy. Malfoy’s bony chest made an uncomfortable mattress, but Harry was far too tired to care.
“There was a time in my youth when I needed to learn Occlumency as a matter of some urgency.” Malfoy said. “It required strong mental control. The space came from that. It’s part of the reason I got into Mind Magic in the first place.” His discomfort was palpable, settling around them like an invisible fog.
The first touch of Malfoy’s hole against him felt impossible. Harry had heard the spells, assumed they had prepared Malfoy, made him ready, but surely Harry would never be able to fit. But Malfoy whined and bore down on him, and Harry felt his cock push through the dense ring of muscle into a hot, unbelievable tightness.
It would be a lie to say he didn’t consider grabbing a handful of Floo powder and storming right over there to interrogate Malfoy in person. It was only the arrival of the
Malfoy’s face went blank – not in the usual careful way where he withdrew behind a veneer of polite professionalism. No, he looked as if all his emotions had been shocked out of him.
Brisley was beginning to look frazzled. Harry, who had been on the receiving end of Hermione’s intensity a lot over the last few months, sympathised.
“Very good,” Malfoy said when Harry hesitantly said all this. “I’m going to end the spell now. Ready?
“Why does it feel so good?” Harry murmurs, running his hand over Draco’s arm and watching the fine hairs stand up in his wake. Draco’s skin is unreasonably soft. Harry’s fingertips tingle.
“Focus on the feeling of me,” came Malfoy’s voice. The visuals followed: Harry still lying on the bed, his dick hard and pink and straining. An imaginary Malfoy knelt over him, his mouth inches from Harry’s erection, his fingers pushing into Harry’s hole, stretching him, getting him ready. Harry’s hips twitched, seeking Malfoy’s mouth. Malfoy smirked and licked a stripe up Harry’s cock, root to tip. With Legilimency, the image was so vivid – so much more vivid than normal – that Harry almost felt it.
“No, of course,” Harry said, but it was hard to deny that it was an exciting development. Hermione and Ron would be delighted. Maybe he should send an owl to Brisley to tell her about it, too.
“Good morning to you, too,” Harry muttered. He stretched, taking guilty stock of the ache in the back of his legs, the bruises on his shoulders and back.
Untethered from his routine, Harry had taken to drifting alone around Muggle London. It was good to be out and about – and it was good to make lots of shiny new memories to distract Malfoy with during their sessions. So far, he hadn’t asked Harry to open any of his four mental doors. Harry intended to keep it that way.
Malfoy looked pleased. His eyes were bright, his whole face pink. The shattered window made sparks of splintered light glint off his ruffled hair. Something sprang to life inside Harry. He took an unthinking step towards Malfoy, who stepped backwards just as instinctively.
! It’s your fault!” He pushed the one-legged man, making him stumble back. There was no satisfaction in knowing that mess wasn’t entirely Draco’s doing. There couldn’t be when Harry was the one suffering.
The tapir, seeming to just now notice what was happening, lifted its heavy head, eyes unfocused, staring at Rudá and Draco. It moaned something Rudá and his animal friends seemed to understand, and it ensued another roll of roaring growls and laughter.
Did she have the slightest idea of how many mushroom species existed? “From the way Caipora talked, I don’t believe the school will have one lying around for me. Also, you and Caipora
Draco seriously doubted that spending time with someone who talked as much as Tainara did could be considered fun, but he smiled and watched as she left.
“The fruit. It looks like eyes. It’s a very Brazilian fruit, it makes the famous soda. Haven’t you tried it?”
Draco himself wasn’t sure about what had happened, and if not for the sun shining bright above him and burning his sensitive skin, he would think everything he saw and did had been a product of his drugged mind.
Draco picked up his pace, crossing the grounds in a few long strides, until he finally reached the front of the palace, panting and covered in sweat.
Draco hummed in acknowledgment. It made sense, from what he had known about Potter. Draco had learned Potter didn’t quite thrive on attention, as he had so heartily believed throughout school.
, Tainara had explained in fewer words than she usually had when talking about her beloved tales, was a witch—
“Saci,” Draco offered promptly and rolled his eyes. “It looks ridiculous, doesn’t it? I have Fast Growing Potion at home, but I think I can brew some here if—”
Draco, too, was getting used to the bird and it barely even bothered him anymore when the creature would nibble at his ear, looking for attention. Still, he said, containing a grin, “To make him feel even more entitled? No, thank you.”
Draco reverted to bickering almost without noticing, the familiar hostility awoken by a flicker of those green eyes, like muscle memory.
The stranger had approached Draco carefully, took the object from its display and handed it to him. “It was restored recently and works like new.” At Draco’s raised eyebrow, he pointed at another man behind the counter, a much older one. “It’s my uncle’s shop. I’m Martin.”
“Wait… Does this mean…?” Draco started, but unable to finish, he let Francisca add the words he dreaded to say, “You’re Rudá’s child.”
And then Saci’s whirlwind appeared again, so strong it almost tripped Draco. He pressed his back against the tree behind him, fingers closing firmly on the seed, arms bracing for the impact, when Saci came lurching for him.
The Headteacher turned to them, lips tight with the effort she was making. “Hold the shield,” she requested.
The strange man-creature’s hand got lost in the pocket of his buttoned shirt, and when it appeared again, he was holding something round. It was too dark to make out exactly what it was—though Draco suspected he wouldn’t know even if they were bathed in sunlight—but he noticed the thing was small enough to fit in Rudá’s palm, dark and dry, like a coconut.
Potter’s laughter was filled with something Draco refused to acknowledge, but he followed the man regardless as he was dragged around the property.
“I’m not destroying anything,” Draco pouted, lowering his wand. He held the coconut in his palm for a second before shoving it in his pocket again. “I just needed to get your attention.” Machado had helped him a lot, positioning Draco closest to Saci, very far from Caipora or Curupira. He needed some kind of control back, and he was assured by Tainara that holding his cap wouldn’t hurt Saci, just compel him to obey, as long as the captor didn’t use it for foul deeds.
As always, Harry went to the storeroom to get the ingredients. Draco tried not to look at the alluring body of the "enemy". Unfortunately, his eyes fell on the attractive buttocks, which he wanted to touch, pat and caress at that moment. With hands or tongue ...
-"You're repeating yourself, Malfoy!" - The aristocrat's attention now caught the neck. He wanted to suck on it and make a few hickeys, but he held back and said in his mind:  "And that is your future last name, Pottah". Malfoy seized the opportunity to put his hand on Griffindor's and began to mix in the right direction. He came closer to him and grabbed his left cheek. His nine-inch bulge in his pants was taking its toll on him. He moved closer to the arsehole and began rubbing against its entrance.
The name coming out of the brunet's mouth was like honey on the ears. It had long been his dream that HIS Potter would not be able to walk after intercourse for another week. He wanted to drive him crazy. Then with all his strength he knocked the Griffindor on the right cheek.
The Pure-blood's member rubbed Scarhead's prostate with each subsequent move. In the classrom, you could hear bodies hitting each other, moans, and sometimes even screams of pleasure. The huge-cocked grip on his buttocks was making Golden Boy shiver.
- "Pottaahh!" - Draco tugged harder at his hair, fingers gripping the shoulders, and after a while warm liquid spilled inside the Green-eyed. The blonde fell over him, their breaths mingling. Nest-haired felt a nose run down his neck, and a smile formed on his face.
- '' More ... ahh '' - and got more. He could see the tears trickling down from the green-eyed brunet's face. Even then, he didn't want to come out of him with strong thrusts. Griffindor's back arched, and a loud scream came from his mouth. He took him hard and brutally.
- "What do you want, Malfoy?! Let go of me, it's after the curfew. I'm in a hurry. "- Potter's ability to think returned. He was afraid of what the blonde would do. They were alone in a dark room where it was easy to murder someone.
Malfoy hurried his movements, and Scarhead knew she was going to taste him soon. As a long growl escaped the pure-blood's mouth, Potter looked up hazy. He wanted to see the blonde's face when he came. There was a salty taste in his mouth that took hold of his palate. After a while, the blows stopped and the prick slipped from his mouth. His breathing was heavy and fast. Malfoy wiped his erection against Griffindor's cheek, leaving a few white patches on the pink blushed cheeks.
Malfoy decided to take off the chameleon spell and reveal his presence. He had a great urge to kiss the brunet. Scarhead got goosey.
-" I'm not going anywhere, "the Slytherin said confidently, and his voice showed no mockery or malice.
. - Potter thought and his eyes covered with lust. He took a piece of magic rag out of his pocket and ran towards the door before it began to close. As he got into, the door slammed.
Malfoy's enormous erection, standing ready, was sliding over the Slytherin's hand. Moans of satisfaction came from the lips of the blonde. This view for Harry was very addictive. Ferret was driving green-eyed mad. Harry covered his mouth and bit into the material to stop the panting and gasping.
- "No. It seems I avoided death again" - Harry chuckled and felt asleep on his back on the desk. Malfoy was sensing the scent of sperm and sweat. He always craved that smell to reach his nostrils and of course Harry lying beneath him. Draco made up his mind not to clean them up. He wished to make a mental note of that essence, connoting and evoking passion. Blond  pressed the side of the boy to him and placed his head on his chest. Malfoy nuzzled nose in his black mop and kissed her forehead briefly before turning in.
Since he knew that a very handsome Slytherin thought of him during such activities, he must like him.
- "Pull it out, Pottah" -  a heavy voice reached the ears of the nest-haired man, which does not accept any objections. Tense muscles and a heart pounding like a drum.
- "Are you okay, Draco? Maybe I'll take you to the infirmary." - Goyle put down his food, which is rare, and asked his housemate.
Harry then had an almost perfect view of Malfoy's prick, which hmm .... it was impossible to miss.. Potter felt his face blush terribly.
- "That's right, damn it" - Another snarl and a hard slap on the back of the throat - "You're so good at it, Potty." - Visually impaired boy, desperately, sucked hard, not letting himself stop. He wanted more ... He began to lick the dong, making his glasses slide off his nose all the time
Draco tasted good. Kissing such soft and confident lips made him dizzy. He could feel immense heat and butterflies in his stomach.
- "Stop giving me orders!" - At this point, Snape felt harm to the golden boy. He did not know that anyone could harass an innocent young man like this.
- ''Aaaahhh, ahh....'' - Harry's eyes darkened with the sensation. He wanted more. He started fucking on his fingers. His moans grew louder.
The desk creaked slightly, and a long sigh elicits a squeak from the table as Draco shoves in half. Potter whined wryly and arched his back so that he bashed himself against the desktop. Malfoy locked eyes with him and Griffindor's bulging dick brushing against their stomachs. The Chosen one biting his lower lip groaned with pain.
- "Take me now! Please. Fuck me.!" - Heir of Malfoy stroked it gently on the cheeks so that after a while its hardness split Scarhead.
-'' It is not polite to hang around in the corridors at night, Potter., as befits a Griffindor.'' - Harry recognized the voice immediately. For so many years, this mockery had been taunting him, expressing scorn of his existence.
- "Good morning, Draco. Severus informed me of your delusions and inventions. I would like to go with you ..." - He was not allowed to finish, because the son took his hand like Severus's one and dragged him to the fireplace. On the way he said:
- "Slytherin loses a hundred points for sick hallucinations and for assaulting and abducting a teacher to showcase his illusions." - Severus declared in a silky and dangerous tone and walked away from the godson waving his black robes. The surprised people were pretending not to see it, and Draco was shocked. Is Potter transmitting any blindness virus and everyone got infected except him? Finally, he shouted out into the entire corridor for Snape to hear in the distance:
- "Haven't your arses switched places with your brains and now you shit through your eyes and you can't see anything?" - Grey-eyed exclaimed. He felt he was going to go crazy. The divine body of the green-eyed man drives him mad, and no one sees his nakedness.
- "I will stop when you are called Malfoy. Now ride your daddy!" - Malfoy rested comfortably on his elbows, carefully scanning Griffindor's beautiful body and anticipating further movements. Potter directed his penis towards its entrance, after a while lowering himself down. He groaned, feeling nine inches inside him, and began jumping upward.
A hooded figure pushed him against the wall! What if it's a Death Eater? A familiar voice broke him out of his trance:
-"Potty, deeper .. I know you can!" - Harry felt Draco's hand pulling his hair. He grabbed the rest of the shaft in his hand and opened his mouth wider and wider and wanted to contain every inch of the enormous prick. He stopped controlling his reflexes. He sucked his cheeks hard and tried to make the Slytherin feel as much pleasure as possible. Potter wasn't pleased that the Slytherin wasn't moaning as loudly as when he was jerking off.
-'' Yes, exactly like that uhhh... ahhh...ohhhh .....'' - Draco's praise was to Harry like Snape giving him an outstanding at Potions. Then suddenly he felt a second hand grip his back of the head. Then he understood what the blonde wants to do. He's gonna fuck his mouth.
Draco didn't show up for dinner. He was afraid he would come across Scarhead and fuck his brain out of him in front of everyone. He went to the potions room where he had his stand with the damned Griffindor. He prepared his stuff for making potions and waited for it to commence.He didn't notice the gathering group of Slytherins and Griffindors.
Harry didn't know how to react. Meanwhile, Malfoy took up raising his hand and ran it over the green-eyed's chest. He placed his hands on his shoulders and lunged at Potter's mouth with animal passion.
- "Potter, how tight you are! Aahhh! I'm packing to the balls! Ahhh! "  - Potter thought he had another hole in the underside of his spine.
After some time, incomprehensible words escaped from the mouth of the huge-cocked boy as Harry stepped closer to understand their meaning. The Slytherin spoke the name, or rather the surname.
-"What is Potter! You feel me in your ass! That's what you're here for! In the future you will listen to me and not snarl! I'll make it impossible for you to shout at me!"
His hands were clenched around Malfoy's calves and his mouth stretched as far as he was standing. He heard the murmurs of satisfaction above his head and felt the pride melting over him and warming his heart
Potter was so exhausted that he did not register his "enemy" brutally devouring his mouth and biting his lips to blood. He started returning the kiss to suddenly feel that he was turned upstairs.
The grey-eyed boy hid his face in his hands. Blaise gave him a friendly touch on the shoulder and said:
A shiver went through Draco's body. The name sounded wonderful from the Griffindor's mouth. He wanted to hear them when the brunet would be moaning and begging.
- "Potter is all naked," - Heir Malfoy repeated, his eyes hazy. Zabini looked up from under his plate and frowned.
-Loosen up, Potty. It's only half of it. I'll give you more." - Griffindor squeezed his eyes shut and lifted his hips higher, hoping it would make him feel more. Blond's movements were very slow, which caused consternation to Harry. Nest-haired wanted to scream to make him move faster, but didn't know he was going to get the complete opposite.
- "Daphne! Doesn't a respected golden boy seem naked to you?" - The blonde looked at Harry. She scanned him and looked at Malfoy as if he were crazy and giggled. At the same time she pretended to cover her breasts with her hands and said:
As soon as the water was full and foam covered every possible surface, Grey-eyed sat on the edge of the tub. Griffindor suppressed a groan of discontent. However, moments later, the Prince of Slyterin took the imposing penis in his hand and started teasing it with his hand.
- "I won't do it" - Harry's mind crossed with thought it's just a mishearing until he made out a husky voice:
Aristocrat felt he couldn't take it. Not to think what he was doing pulled the teacher's hand and yanked and pulled out of his study.
- "I heard that your friends may have noticed the peculiarities in your behavior and health." - Draco felt disheartened by this statement
Well at Hogwarts there was a cool and rainy evening. Green-eyed size queen was about to come back to the Griffindor Tower after detention with Snape. Walking down the corridors he spotted a mop of blonde hair shuffling his feet forward. Tall blonde was heading towards the Prefects' Bathroom to take a calm bath after tiring day. After following and coming closer to the guy, Harry realized who was being tracked and felt thrill all over his spine when he noticed where Slytherin Prince stopped. Draco Malfoy waited a second and the huge door opened, letting him in.
- "Don't exaggerate. It's only two thirds." - Grey-eyed carried on, exhausted of maintaining self-control. Draco started thrusting indolently, allowing to get used to the feeling full and making Harry poking on Draco's cock.
Potter was shocked. He didn't know what to do. He felt really great and, to his surprise, kissed him back. Pure-blood pushed his tongue into Harry's mouth and examined its structure. He was slowly sliding off his robe. Harry opened his eyes and realized that he was staring at the huge bulge in the blond's pants. Blood pulsed through his veins and felt a strange heat throughout his body.
Malfoy decided he saw the most beautiful sight of his life. Potter leaping over him, moaning loudly filling his naked body, trembling with pleasure.
- ''What do you want, Potter?'' - Without waiting for a reply, he quickly turned him over. He caressed Griffindor's buttocks, which slowly turned crimson. Malfoy knelt and a cold finger made circles around his entrance. Sweat ran down Scarhead's temples. Without warning, Malfoy stuck it in and was searching for the magic point by every millimeter. Once he found it, he pressed on it with all his might, making the Griffindor muffled, inarticulate sound. Harry had a lot of thoughts at the same time.
A feeling of heaviness and a soft sigh from the Slytherin's mouth caused shivers of excitement. He wanted to look up, but a strong hand gripped his hair and pushed him downward, causing half of his penis to go down his throat. He inhaled sharply through his nose and rested his hands on the blonde's calves.
- ''Why the fuck did you stop? ''-he shouted excitedly to the limit. Potter moved even closer and parted his lips again and wrapped his lips around the blue head of the cold prick he sucked. Malfoy didn't think Potter's lips were so wonderful. He did not know that these lips gave such pleasure. He looked into those beautiful eyes and stroked green-eyed's cheek with his hand. Scarhead made circular movements of his tongue around the tip and the throbbing vein under the shaft. It made Malfoy groan uncontrollably and shudder with mounting excitement. Draco wanted to muffle the sounds because he knew the boy would suck harder then.
- "Ride me, Potter!" - Potter did not comprehend how you can still have strength after such an exhausting activity. The bouncing tip against his entry did not help.
- "Let's do it together, Pottyyy. " - Then Potter whimpered bitterly and cum gushed out of his cock, mucking their bellies. Draco simultaneously made three brutal thrust until coming off inside of Potter:
- ''Don't play a fool. I know what you were doing. Draaco'' - The visually impaired boy specially stretched the syllables in the name of blonde's to sound very seductive. At the end, Potter showed a grin.
The aristocrat grasped Scarhead's tongue with his teeth, which groaned in surprise, then sucked it hard with his lips.
- "What's going on again? His gorgeous broom? Stupid neighbor? Beautiful green eyes? Or hideous uneven glasses?" - Draco frowned at his father. Did the Potter spoil his father?
He stifled a groan of displeasure as Harry straightened and headed straight towards him. He stifled a groan of displeasure as Harry straightened and headed straight towards him. The rapist's dangerous smile appeared on Draco's face at once. Brunet did not notice the saliva that dripped on his chin.
The boys did a lot of quick numbers, switching positions, but Harry was always the one at the bottom.
Severus tightened the shaft of his wand to use it at the ready. The tall Slytherin's expression showed arousal. Potter was intimidated, but he didn't want to screw up the potion and let his hand be directed. Cold pureblood fingers brushed the chosen one's neck. Then Harry felt "reptile's" lips nibble at his ear and bites his lobe.
The green-eyed realized he was going in the wrong direction and wanted to turn in the opposite direction. However, an invisible force prevented him from doing so. Pressed against the wall. His body went still as he felt a warm breath against his left ear and cold spreading through his body.
The nest-haired boy decided to take matters into his own hands and struck up to undress. The undressed brunet quietly laid the clothes on the floor and from the other end slowly and silently entered the bathtub. Pleasant grunts reached his ears. The wrapped in cloak swam between Malfoy's legs and carefully approached his crotch. Malfoy felt his breath warm for a moment against his thigh and held his breath.
Except the next day, the Daily Prophet issued a spectacular article. Daphne choked on the porridge after reading it. She immediately put it under the Slytherin Prince's nose.
Visually impaired boy shifted his hand from the balls to the hard and thick shaft, then steered it straight into his greedy mouth. The first thing he hit was salty taste and coolness. He was right.
- "Idiot, can't you see that the golden boy is not wearing clothes? Look at him!" He turned to Nott, who was sitting to his right.
- "That's right. Because you know deep down you deserve to be punished. Don't you, Mr Potter? You may go." - For Harry, it was enough. He picked up his backpack and walked out of the classroom. While sprinting down the stairs, he almost passed out. Potter felt an enormous pain in his wrist after the detention at Umbridge. A scar that read "I must not tell lies" was visible to him as he looked down at his hand. His veins felt as if they were running with needles instead of blood. He was weakened and didn't seem to have the strength to wonder what direction he was going.
Draco decided that the theory of the infectious disease transmitted by Scarhead was correct and decided to bring in someone who had no contact with the green-eyed. Malfoy walked into the abandoned alcove, where there was a disused fireplace connected to Floo's network.
- "Uncle, please tell me that you saw Saint Potter in the Great Hall today?" he replied.  Snape hadn't expected such a question.
Potter had never felt such a strong fulfillment. The feeling of fullness overwhelmed Griffindor and thus made him come with a loud scream on his lips and drop onto the flat wooden table. He has never had such a strong orgasm. Even during intercourse with Ginny, in which he was dominated anyway, he did not feel such strong emotions.
- "Pull it out, Pottah" - he said in a voice hoarse with excitement - "I'm afraid you have to be given orders because you are doing nothing".
- "You don't see it either? BUT HE IS COMPLETELY UNCOVERED? SHOWS HIS BLOODY BRILLIANT CHEEKS ALL THE SCHOOL!" - Draco couldn't stand it.
The huge-cocked boy bit his lip hard to keep from groaning. His insanity deepened when the respected Mr. Potter decided to bend down for the rat's heart. The boy who was sticking out was not aware of what he was doing with his sworn enemy.
Harry closed his eyes for a moment and kept the monstrosity in front of his eyes. Long with many veins flowing along the shaft, it was as white as flour. With its sight, he pleaded to be taken deep in his mouth. Harry remembered when he touched the Slytherin's skin, he felt an immense cold. For a moment it crossed his mind whether his cock was also cold. Just like ice cream. Brunet had a sudden urge for ice cream with whipped cream. Malfoy's prick was about nine inches. Harry was haunted by thoughts of what would happen if this huge tool disappeared in his ass. Unknowingly, Griffindor licked his lips and put his hands under his pants and touched his bulge.
Potter tensed. He did not expect such a move from the enemy. But what happened next exceeded his expectations. The blonde took his hands in his and began to cut this crap into equal 2-centimeter strips.
- "You all knew it! And you didn't fucking tell me!" - Laughter spread among the fifth year Slytherins.
- "Are you all right? Potter eats the treacle as always and talks to his dudes" - Draco clenched his fists and his face turned the color of Weasley's hair.
- "Shut it! If you don't shag him before Christmas, don't even dare to go home" - The man went to Severus' office and asked to use the fireplace.
The feeling of fullness was wonderful. Harry felt like he was going to explode at any moment. His own cock was hard and throbbing painfully. Nest-haired realized that Draco loves him pleading with him. He didn't know where the need for it came from, but at all costs he wanted to show Malfoy what pleasure he was getting. He wanted to moan with all his might.
- ''Who's there ?'' - Grey-eyed exclaimed. Then Potter decided to make his presence known. And thus from the cloak through the blond one none other than the golden boy appeared. Malfoy froze.
Brunet felt like everything was going crazy in him. He was ruled by many extreme emotions. The nest-haired man wanted to continue this game.
- "Malfoy, get on with making the potion! You always do it!" - Golden Boy affirmed, and Slytherin just nodded and said a soft "hmmmm." Potter set the cauldron and began to boil water. Draco couldn't concentrate. His hands refused to obey him and his eyes turned involuntarily towards the "naked" boy next to him. For a moment his mind went back to work and commanded:
- "Do I seem naked to you, Draco?" - there was a loud laugh across the table of his house. The ferret started tearing its hair out and couldn't take her eyes off the tanned skin of the nest-haired boy.
With a quick movement, Malfoy grabbed the Golden Boy's wrist and pulled him into a nearby alcove. The blond cast a few spells to silence and close the room.
- '' Calm down, I have something better for you. You'll be begging me for more,no matter how strong the pain is. Innocent Potty .. " - Suddenly he felt something huge and hard slide into his inner, which resists. He felt a hard erection brutally breaking through all the barriers and it comes to the end. Harry cried out in pain and wasn't ready for something like that.
After the march, he found himself in an unknown corridor. He looked at his watch and realized that it was past the curfew.
- '' Because that's what you do, right? You offer yourself to me, and I am willing to take the offer. '' Harry groaned for a long time as he felt a hand on his left cheek. He felt his world spin before his eyes. Gryffindor's self-control went to fuck. He clenched his hands on the edge of the tub and thrust his buttocks as far away as possible towards the cool hands. The nest-haired man was gasping for air in his lungs. He wanted it like nothing more.
- "Yield to me." - grunts escaped from the mouth of the grey-haired boy. The Chosen One, not having the strength to speak, only nodded and devoted himself to blissful tenderness. The taller considered it as consent and kept at pleasuring his crotch.  And it was not long, the last items of the golden boy's wardrobe hit the ground, along with the boxers. Draco unbuckled his belt and took down his trousers just to hurl them away. Potters' half-open eyes glanced directly at Malfoy's white underwear with a perceptible outline. His sight came to Slytherin's attention and turned him more on. Grey-eyed leaned down to kiss the boy of his dreams. The Griffindor kissed back and began brushing their tongues together. This french kiss was far-fetched, not like the one with Cho. Suddenly blissful sense was replaced with a hoarse voice:
Draco could smell the faint scent of treacle tart and chocolate frog. The smell gave him strength and his excitement overwhelmed him again. He pulled the Golden Boy's hair towards his mouth.
The Potions Master screamed into the sky. Collin wouldn't be himself if he hadn't capture this moment. He took out his camera and a clap sound spread through the studio. Snape closed the door and cast Muffliato on it.
The fifteen-year-old did not care about his father's words, but decided to take him to a greenhouse where a "naked" brunet was supposed to have herbology. During a tour of the former school, Lucius's robes got crumpled and his hair was no longer straight.
Harry wanted to feel more. He did not know that something like this on earth was so enjoyable. He thought he was in heaven. Because what can be so nice on Earth.
It was better for Draco than his daily wet dreams starring Harry. He pleased not only himself, but also Potter, writhing on his stomach in front of him. After a series of moans, Harry felt a warm stream spread across his thighs. At that moment he heard the grey-eyed fingers tightening on his thighs, and behind Scarhead it seemed that he heard a loud, long, low groan behind his back.
Well, Harry's always had his cape with himself. He used it for spying on naked guys in bathroom. He's already admired bare bodies of Cedric Diggory, Blaise Zabini. Theodor Nott, Weasley Twinks and even Neville Longbottom. Naughty Harry. Using father's heritage for fulfilling his sexual fantasies? Unfortunately Scarhead was too shy to reveal his presence and ask for help with losing his virginity. Also he didn't enjoy the size of their ''friends''.  It wasn't decent enough for his standards.
The uncontrollable grunting from the Slytherin's mouth was heightened by Harry's already growing arousal. He realized he needed to try harder. He gripped his ass harder and finally the entire nine inches was down his esophagus. The pain piercing his mouth and larynx did not bother him. Only after a few moments was he able to move his head calmly. He suppressed all his retching reflexes and wouldn't even stop. He made faster and faster movements.
- "Dracooo, ohhh, ........ aaahhhhh, give it to me ....." - Draco's thrusts became more and more brutal. He got up from his knees and began to enter the brunet from above at a different angle. Tip registered that he was stabbing at his point. He began to push harder against him to make HIS chosen one feel more painful and more pleasant.
Harry just watched Draco take off his shirt. His body was lean, pale, and slightly chiseled. Griffindor could have sworn he saw his complexion glow in the darkness of the dungeon classroom. It blinded him with its glow, as did Malfoy.
- "Pull out what you've been staring at" - Scarhead, never taking his eyes off Draco, slipped his pants off him, and the two fifteen-year-olds showed a nine-inch penis trying to tear the fabric of the red boxers open. The green-eyed Griffindor reached down slowly and slid the fabric of the underpants that now hung loosely around his calves.
Come closer to Draco, his mouth went dry. He saw Potter with his back to him. He bit his lip as Harry tugged his hair back. A picture of those cheeks squeezing them appeared in his mind. Lucius noticed his descendant's dreamy gaze and spoke:
- "We don't have time to talk. It's more than life's at stake" - Lucius wondered if maybe Draco should rest. The Slytherin Prince pronounced the destination and he and his father found themselves in an abandoned alcove.
Suddenly, the nest-haired teen experienced severe pain in the area of his back. He felt as if he was undergoing the Crucio series. It caused terrible suffering and made it impossible to think straight. He did not control the work of his legs, which made him limp in an unknown direction.
And below it, a half-page photo of naked Potter lying on his back on a desk with a blond who was driving him insane.
He took a handful of floo powder and landed at Malfoy Manor. The boy immediately found himself in the living room of his family home. Lucius Malfoy was sitting in the armchair opposite with a letter.
- "But I need it" - He stuttered, but his hand was gone from his prick. He's not stupid enough to derive Malfoy now. If anyone saw him now, they would think he had rabies or he was turning into a werewolf.
At the same time, a tall blond Slytherin boy was marching down the hall to the Great Hall. Everything would be fine if his attention had not been drawn to a certain point. A few yards away on the other side of the corridor stood a handsome naked boy with no scrap of clothing.
It was a cool October morning at the Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Outside the window a gusty wind was raging and raindrops ran down the windows. A green-eyed Griffindor was heading towards the Great Hall for breakfast. Little did he know what was going to happen that day. When he stood at the threshold of the opened door, he ran to the table of his house to his friends.
Each hit produced beautiful moans that he could give anything for Draco. He struck fast, hard and decisively. He wanted to drive Potter crazy. He had been dreaming about it for three years. He wanted to bring him to the brink of fulfillment. To the very center of this pleasure.
-'' Fuck off, Malfoy! Let me pass." - Griffindor exclaimed. His scream could attract Filch. That's why the blonde covered her mouth with his hand and pressed his victim more to the concrete.
-- 'I'm taking it!' He said desperately.- He couldn't let this opportunity slip away from him. The scream echoed up the bathroom walls. The dark haired boy sounded like a pleading teen in need at the moment. He couldn't let the Slytherin go and leave him there. He felt himself getting hard and thought it would come from just looking. Then he placed a few kisses on the gray-eyed groin, right next to the protruding tool.
Draco put his hand on Harry's chest and felt his heart beating hard. He smiled that not only his was beating so quickly.
And that was it. Potter became Malfoy's boyfriend. Some of the inhabitants of the Slytherin house did not dare to comment on Draco's "hallucinations", for curses and charms reached anyone who dared.
-"Don't make me do it for you, Pottah!" Harry wanted to nod, but the large volume in his mouth made it impossible for him. His jaw ache was taking its toll, but he didn't care. He wanted to please the man he was kneeling behind. He squeezed his eyes shut tightly and his tongue ran over and around the tip. More salty taste and cold spread over his mouth. He felt slender fingers stroke his head.
The nest-haired brunet ran his thumb over the tip. He could feel the veins throbbing and he shifted his position in his lap and raised his other hand. The thought of having a heavy penis on his lips deprived him of his ability to think straight. He felt ashamed,because After all, he knew nothing about these things. Just what he read from Dumbledore's newspapers, which were always hidden under the Pensieve. There was nothing there to say that the partner was of such an unhealthy size. After all, it's probably not possible for him to fit in his mouth. What came over him to get in here?
His hands tightened around the edge of the tub and he felt his lower body burn. Some great power tore him apart from the inside as the prick began to move in shallow movements. He looked up to meet grey pupils that screamed pleasure and sweat beaded down his forehead. The sight added a wave of excitement.
Snape had never felt such an embarrassment in his life. He was very revealing about the mental health of the godson.
The Slytherin Prince grabbed his hips and retreated almost to the end, for a moment Visually impaired he thought the aristocrat would come out of him completely, but then the man pushed harder and a scream escaped from the brunet's mouth. He felt dizzy and shivered through his body, overwhelming him.
That same evening, Professor Snape went to his class with Collin Creevey to make up his detention for taking pictures of a teacher in an accident at work. Young Malfoy's hallucinations and complaints were unbearable. As he passed, he noticed that the door was ajar. He frowned and walked over to open them. He strained his hearing and a groan reached his ears. He supposed there was a fight in this room and someone was hurt.
The teacher surreptitiously looked at the Slytherin Prince in disgust. The huge nine-inch lump was way too noticeable from his perspective. Fortunately for him, everyone else was busy working in the classroom. The professor did not want to pay attention to the godson so as not to make him more "delusional".
- ''Yeahh,a aahh, Give me your big dick to me...ahhhah'' - Potter's screams bounced off the bathroom walls.
- "Draco, since I am worried about your psyche, I let you drag my majesty behind you, but explain to me what your trouble is" - Long-haired man had never seen such determination on his son's face.
He tilted his head back to see Draco bared his teeth like a predator to prey, gray irises completely obscured by pupils and arousal.
Harry James Potter, the Golden Boy, the Chosen one, who is famous of his scar. Through the years Potter has been haunted by lots of girls wanting him to make out. For their misfortune Harry wasn't interested in them. He was in possession of invisibility cloak. What a gift, right? It's many applications. After all, what a straight guy would not use it to spy on chicks in the bathroom being hidden under some cassock. Well Harry didn't.
The green-eyed world has just stopped. He understood what had happened and felt a burning sensation in the back of his body, but despite the pain he wanted more.
The body of the taller trembled with pleasure, and Griffindor felt a salty taste on his tongue. He closed his eyes and purred softly, trying to swallow everything. He sucked the penis in his mouth, and as he felt it soften, he let it out of his lips. He looked up and ran his tongue over his swollen lips. Malfoy stared at him with fire in his eyes and stroked his cheek tenderly.
-"You were a naughty boy. You deserve a dementor's kiss." - Harry froze. Dementor's kiss? He can't be serious.
Four-eyes instantly felt a cold hand hit his buttock. At one point he saw stars in the sky. He hadn't expected such a move, but he liked it very much. He stuck out closer to Malfoy.
The visually impaired boy groaned as he felt the tall blonde man speed up his movements. He ran his tongue over the crack at the tip of the prick, his fingertips caressing Draco's testicles, bringing out a lot of loud and dirty words from the heir of Malfoy.
-" Why? "- asked Scarhead uncertainly, afraid of the answer that never came. In one moment, Harry was pressed against the wall, their lips colliding in a greedy kiss. The eyeglass groaned against Draco's lips, feeling a flock of butterflies in his stomach and the tingling sensation wandering through his body. The blonde grabbed his robe and instead of gently taking it off, he jerked it so that it almost ripped it in half.
Malfoy saw Chosen One tilt his mop of hair back. He took his fist on his hair and clenched his fist and pulled it towards him. He brought his head close to Potter's ear and bit his lobe.
- "My FATHER WILL HEAR ABOUT THIS!" - The Potions Master stopped and looked at him. He rested his face on his hand and shook it in disbelief.
- "Harderr, deeper..." - Muttered with half-lidded eyes. - "I want everything more.."  -He groaned in his throat as a wave of pleasure passed through his body in another thrust. He was determined and without being over-controlled.
It was a rainy November evening. At Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, a tall, blonde Slytherin glance at his watch with impatience. Hour hand almost approached the twelve. Draco was looking forward to putting his plan into operation. That night his object of desire was going to be claimed by himself. He arranged everything with due diligence and made sure not to miss a trick.
Tears welled up under his eyelids as Malfoy made his sharp movements deeper and deeper into him. His knees and jaw ached, but he didn't care. Harry groaned as he felt Draco's hands tighten in his hair and hold his head so he couldn't move it. He couldn't wait to see Malfoy's expression on his orgasm.
Potter was shocked to feel his teeth against his tongue, but then there was a great feeling. Half-blood didn't know you could do it that way. Then his body felt a strong slap on his right cheek. Malfoy started to rub his long foot against Griffindor's calf, sending a shivering chill straight to his nine-inch monstrosity.
- ''Take it Harryy,, oohh......'' - snarls from the blonde's ears reached Harry's ears with difficulty.
“Yes, but when you factor in the year at Hogwarts, the three years of training at St Mungo’s, the year-long research project and the incredible unwillingness of the Wizarding population at large to have anything to do with someone with a”—he gestured to his left forearm—“well. It was quite a tight schedule. But I couldn’t think of anything else I was even remotely good at.”
Harry’s thoughts still jumped around, but he was getting better. It was easier now that Malfoy had unflinchingly heard every awful thing that Ron had said about him dozens of times. He’d also seen Harry suffer through several frustrating conversations with the Head Auror, had a tour of the cafés, pubs and restaurants that an abashed Hermione had taken them to after Harry had mentioned Malfoy’s opinion of their omnipresence at the Leaky Cauldron, and had watched Harry fumble his way through countless interactions with oblivious longtime acquaintances.
He slumped against it, heart pounding. “Oh my god,” he said loudly. “Fuck, I’m sorry, I thought you – Why would you invite me in?!” He thunked his head back against the door. He had been so
“I just wanted your professional opinion on whether it’s weird to be a bit turned on by you knowing your way around my house.”
“Four,” Malfoy repeated thoughtfully. “I see.” He felt so close, like he was standing right beside Harry. It was strange not to see him.
Hermione’s detailed instructions about the ritual seemed very far away in Harry’s mind, yet he knew exactly what to do. He drank from the bowl in one long gulp. In his peripheral vision, he saw Malfoy do the same.
“Oh.” Harry had been quite proud of the work he’d put in to making up this stupid room. He’d considered everything from cosy sitting rooms to rolling fields to rustic inns – but it was only when he’d become frustrated with the same four straight walls boxing him in and imagined this particular space that something had clicked. He had been surprised at how
“Yeah,” Draco breathes. He bats Harry’s hand away, sits back on Harry’s thighs and pulls out his cock. “You too,” he says. “Take it out, I want to— Fuck, come
“How on earth is your mind supposed to get stronger if you never give it new information?” Malfoy demanded.
“You know, you can buy those anywhere,” Malfoy says, nodding to the shirt. “It is much nicer than the rags you usually wear, but it’s hardly out of your price range. There’s no need to salivate over it like that.”
There were enough letters dotted around addressed to “Harry” that he felt confident that he was in Harry’s house, whoever “Harry” was. There were photographs on the mantelpiece – photographs of many people, but three who appeared most often: a tall, ginger man with a pale face, an easy grin and a heavy smattering of freckles; a darker-skinned woman who had an incredible amount of frizzy brown hair and a tendency to roll her eyes; and another man – messy-haired and bespectacled.
“That was absolutely nothing to do with me,” Draco said loudly to the two-way mirror. “I want that on record.”
“The best,” Harry said, and kissed Draco again, hard and deep. It wasn’t long before they were both panting, their bodies pressed together, their cocks rubbing through the cotton of Harry’s underwear.
An aborted jolt of unease pulsed through him – Malfoy’s feeling, not Harry’s. Harry widened his sightless eyes. “What? Is that a bad thing?”
“Don’t think of him, then,” Harry said, grinning against the mark of his teeth on Draco’s skin. It was beginning to sink in that Draco might want him back, that Harry might actually have a chance. He was giddy with it. “Think of me.”
“Er, yeah,” he said quickly, the wary sympathy (or was that, god forbid, pity?) in her smile setting him on edge. “Yeah, I’m fine. Thanks.”
Fuck. Harry really, really didn’t have time for this. His head gave a sharp pang of protest. “Can’t you, I dunno…go to an inn for the night? Until it blows over?”
“Well, I’ve been—I haven’t been at school, have I? I mean, I’m not a student. I’m casting the same spells over and over, not learning anything new, so… And I’m not looking over my shoulder for Death Eaters any more, either, so I’m not—not as alert…” But the excuses he’d been telling himself for months suddenly sounded much less reasonable when said aloud.
His hand drops to his own cock, and he palms himself roughly through his clothes. He shifts, pushing his hips into his hand. Malfoy makes a low noise of encouragement.
Harry waited, determinedly keeping his eyes away from Malfoy’s neckline, but Malfoy didn’t finish his sentence.
Harry bit Malfoy's thigh, which was still hoisted over Harry’s shoulder, and started jerking his hand in time with his thrusts.
“Again, I think so. And I suspect there will be risks associated with the attempt. But there’s no way of knowing until you try.”
The Shield Charm burst out of Harry instinctively, and Harry felt a very peculiar sensation of having his consciousness whoosh forwards while his body remained seated. It wasn’t like falling, or the constriction of Apparition. It was more personal than that. Like the anticipation of being held when being drawn into a hug.
He looked accusingly at whoever had spoken, ready to tell them he was busy, and was disconcerted to find himself glaring at a teenage girl. She couldn’t be more than seventeen – her large eyes were set in a round face dotted with freckles.
“Bedroom?” Harry repeated to himself, baffled. It was one thing for Draco to have got him a gift that he couldn’t have brought into work – it was quite another for it to be something he couldn’t even bring downstairs. Given what had prompted Draco’s memory yesterday, Harry had assumed he was to receive some embarrassingly posh robes, suitable for a snobby dinner at Lakewend’s. But maybe he was thinking too small. Maybe Draco was going to offload an entire wardrobe onto him.
He and Malfoy were in the Leaky Cauldron. They were, in fact, at the very table they were actually sitting at, the barman still scrubbing away ten feet to their right. Neither Harry nor Malfoy were doing anything – they just stared at each other. Again, Harry was confused. Was he living the present moment through Malfoy’s perception?
Harry waved a hand. “Yeah, I get that bit,” he said. “It’s what’s inside that’s not making sense. It’s a—a contract, you said?” He looked at Robards for confirmation.
Harry stiffened at the stranger’s voice. He straightened. Striding up to them was a tall, thin man with an impressive handlebar moustache. He was entirely unfamiliar and was beaming at Harry.
“Shit, Malfoy,” Potter says. He’s pulling his trousers on, fumbling with the buttons. He abandons the attempt with a huff and looks back to Draco. Draco flinches. Braces himself. “Shit,” Potter says again. “Malfoy – I’m so sorry.”
The thought caused Harry to falter, and his next spell hit Malfoy’s dead-on. The two jets of light bounced off each other – one hit Malfoy’s window, causing a spiderweb of cracks to frost over the glass; the other crashed into the wall, burning a large, dark scorch mark into the paint.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Please. I bought my way onto the Slytherin team and never won a single match against you. Besides, even if I were the most talented player in the history of Hogwarts, no team would take me on after the War.”
Potter is boneless, sprawling. He’s watching Draco through heavy eyes. There are pearly ropes of come all over him. His mouth curves into a soft smile.
“If he’s so busy, what sort of timeline should we expect going forwards?” Hermione was saying. “We’re over halfway to the six-month deadline. There have already been so many delays.”
“Puddlemere, then. They’ve really leaned into the ‘Wood’ branding, I’ve heard. Oliver’s quite good-looking. Very intense.”
“Oh, for fuck’s sake.” Harry was definitely supposed to hear that time. “Will you just get back in here?” There was a beat. “Unless you don’t want to?”
“Ever heard of an Air-freshening Charm?” Draco asks, appearing in the doorway and wrinkling his nose.
“Oh. I – er…” Tom looked from Harry to Malfoy and back again. “I didn’t realise you knew each other.”
Before he could change his mind, Harry nodded, called his owl (a tawny that, even after five years, he couldn’t bring himself to name) and sent it to the Leaky Cauldron.
Ron whirled on Hermione. “You’re letting this happen?” he demanded. “Legilimency therapy? Malfoy’s going to be – what? Forcing himself into Harry’s brain and rifling around? Like Snape did? We saw how much good that did, didn’t we? The little present You-Know-Who sent Harry at the end of fifth year?”
He’s still jerking with aftershocks when Draco slumps onto Harry’s chest, heedless of the mess. He settles himself on top of Harry as if he belongs there, rests his head on Harry’s shoulder, presses his nose into Harry’s neck. Harry’s magic tingles pleasantly at the contact, but the position is not particularly comfortable—Harry’s bunched-up shirt is digging into his chest and the waistband of his boxers is pressing insistently against his bollocks and there is come all over him. Their come.
Draco opens his eyes. Potter’s hips are twitching, his hand gripping his cock but not moving, like he’s waiting for Draco, like he wants to do this together.
The scene shifted. Harry’s eyes caught Malfoy immediately – how could they not – but it took him a moment to identify himself. He was dressed in Auror robes, and was shoving a smirking Malfoy against the wall of a bedroom he didn’t recognise. Malfoy lifted his chin imperiously and Harry growled and tore open Malfoy’s trousers. Malfoy jerked his hips and Harry dove his hand inside Malfoy’s underwear. Another growl, and Harry surged forwards, dipping his head to kiss and bite and suck at Malfoy’s neck. Malfoy moaned and tipped his head to the side. He dug his fingers into Harry’s hair, holding him in place.
“No way,” Harry breathed. He propped himself up on one elbow. “Are you having me on? That was the night I fell in love with you too! That’s why I picked it for the ribbons, you were amazing, I think about it all the – Why are you shaking your head?”
Draco let out a loud, desperate noise and leaned into Harry’s hands. He tipped his head back again and gave himself over to Harry’s thrusts. Judging by Draco’s shuddering reactions, Harry had found the right angle. His legs burned with the effort of hitting it each time.
Harry fumbled for Draco’s cock and tugged once, twice, and Draco was crying out, his stomach muscles tensing and his thighs tightening and his hole clenching and he was coming, shooting over Harry’s stomach, his chest. Harry kept his hand moving, kept fucking into him, holding himself back by sheer force of will until Draco’s eyes opened and he whimpered, then Harry grabbed his hips again, threw his head back and let the wave of pleasure crash over him. He was swearing and no doubt blurting more embarrassing truths but he couldn’t hear himself; his ears roared and his body seized and, god, he had never felt anything better in his whole life.
“Liar.” Draco pressed his nose into the juncture between Harry’s nostril and his cheek. He was breathless, but at least his voice didn’t betray the giddiness that bubbled inside him. He never thought he’d be allowed another chance to— “Your mental control is incredible, you knew exactly what you were doing.”
“No, but I want him to fuck me again and he won’t until he knows you’re okay with it,” Draco says petulantly. “Can we?”
“Fuck, you’re so big,” Draco said, voice strained. He sunk down another inch. “You – Harry, you’re inside me. God, you feel so good.”
“Fuck.” Harry’s head was reeling. Over the last few months, ruminating over his depleted magic, he’d suspected everything from the lingering effects of the Horcrux to nutritional damage from the summer he’d eaten nothing but grapefruit and birthday cake. He’d considered poisons, Dark creatures, cursed items of clothing. An unfulfilled marriage contract had not occurred to him.
“Fuck, if you don’t stop within the next five seconds,” Harry ground out, “I’m Apparating us straight to my bedroom.”
.” This was all happening so fast. Harry didn’t want to – didn’t want to hurt Malfoy – but it felt so good to let himself move. He tentatively allowed another push upwards – not much, not fast – and Malfoy nodded frantically, hair falling into his face again.
The praise seemed to have snapped Malfoy back to the present. “So,” he said, “do you want to keep discussing my long history of bad decisions, or shall we make a start?”
“We have Earl Grey, if you want it?” Hermione offered, standing on her tiptoes to reach the tea shelf. “I noticed you started drinking it.”
Harry imagined himself stranded in the middle of the Thames, the murky brown water replaced by silver memories. “That sounds hard,” he said.
By now, Harry was used to the constant stream of owls that pecked on his window like they were trying to
The floral smell mingled with the sharp tang of broom polish. Malfoy’s teammate elbowed him and sneered towards – was that Ron, standing next to Harry, looking rather green in the face? Harry’s stomach did an unhappy jolt at the sight; he’d been told he’d known Ron since their first day of school – but he couldn’t remember him looking any younger than twenty-seven.
Malfoy looked at him strangely. The smile slid off Harry’s face. Malfoy cleared his throat. “So,” he said, lacing his fingers together. “It’s been four months since the incident that caused your memory loss, correct?”
“Great.” It didn’t seem like asking for an explanation would bring any sort of enlightenment. “Great. Listen, it sounds like things are a little tense between the two of you, but could you go and find Hermione Granger and bring her here, please?” Kreacher’s face darkened, and he hastened to add, “It’s for the good of the House of Black.”
He laid out the two letters – the one he’d just written, and the one Malfoy had sent – side by side, comparing the tone. Words had never been his strong suit, but he thought he'd done rather well. Anyone reading them would see nothing more than a civil correspondence between former schoolmates.
The first touch of Draco’s hole was just that – a touch. Draco lifted himself immediately and shuffled forwards, seeking a better position, but Harry already felt dizzy from it, from the promise of being inside that clinging tightness that had been swallowing his fingers minutes before.
Potter’s legs are spread wide, his arse in the air. Draco is finger-fucking him, plunging in and out of his clenching hole – so why does Draco feel like he’s the one having his defences torn away, leaving him exposed?
Draco kisses him again, helplessly, and Potter yanks open Draco’s robes. Buttons ping off and patter over the floor, but Draco barely notices; Potter’s hands find his arse and jerk him closer still, and Draco can feel his rational thought slipping blissfully away with every slide of Potter’s tongue, every shift of his hips.
. Or rather, he hadn’t yet. Even as Harry settled into his new routine – pour his thoughts into the Pensieve, lock the lingering feelings away in his head, sit in the wingback chair, check the four doors were still firmly closed, finally make eye contact – it was getting more and more difficult to keep his feelings a secret.
He gazed at her. Her face was familiar from the photographs, but prompted no other memory. Her brown eyes were wide and worried. She took a step towards him. He stepped back instinctively.
“I know what you meant,” Malfoy said. “I just didn’t – Well. It’s fine. Thank you for apologising, but I understand you must have been shocked. I had assumed that your friends had already made you aware of the details. I should have made sure. It was my mistake.”
“And,” Hermione said loudly, ignoring Ron, “given that Draco is going to need Harry to trust him in order for this to have a chance of working, I think we should let Harry form his own opinions.” Ron opened his mouth, but Hermione carried on. “I would have thought that helping your best friend to regain almost three decades of lost memories would be more important than scoring points in petty teenage rivalries.”
“I used to have a regular meeting with a Mind Healer here, you see, but recently he’s been scheduling other people in my spot.”
“People will think we’ve been stood up,” I say, forcing a grin and nodding to the empty chairs. As attempts at humour go, it’s a weak one, but it’s the best I can do with a stomach full of dodgy beer and the world’s most inconvenient semi.
– hole, the head of his dick meeting clenching resistance then sliding forwards, inch by agonising inch.
Malfoy made a noise in the back of his throat. He didn’t look away. “I – I’m your Healer. It would be taking advantage.”
His cock is hard and pinker than the rest of him. A silver piercing glints in one of his nipples. I swallow and avert my eyes.
The drabble I ended up submitting for the July 2020 Drarry Discord Drabble Challenge. I really thought I was doing something clever with this one. 🙄
Malfoy snorted. “He’s practically smiling at you there. But, for now, direct your attention away from memory and try to focus on the feeling of me in your mind. Once you can identify a foreign presence, you’ll find it easier to learn your own mental boundaries and to control what you see.”
The thudding resolved unmistakably into the sound of a fist on wood. Specifically, a wooden door. A great wooden door that stood, thick and looming, in the back of Harry’s mind, quaking with each pounding knock.
His dismissal failed to get rid of her, but at least seemed to convince her he was sober—and somewhat sane. Harry was still frowning at the map—a complex puzzle of lines that no regular person could interpret, surely—but out of the corner of his eye, he saw her relax.
“So gross,” Harry agrees, licking the last sweet traces of Malfoy from his lips. “But this isn’t blood; it’s your potion.” He lets his voice slip into melodious encouragement. “Drink it.”
“I’m sorry,” he forces out, while the image of Potter is still here to hear it. “I’m so fucking sorry for everything, for all of it, it was all my fault–”
“God, I’m so late,” he panted once he’d splashed through the courtyard to reach her. “How fucked am I?”
“God,” Harry said between kisses that sent sparks straight to his dick. “God, you feel so – mmh – We have to – We have to stop.”
“Master,” he croaked, and bowed. “Do let Kreacher know if there is anything else he can do to serve.” Then, without waiting for a response, he snapped his fingers and disappeared.
Draco scuffed the toe of his boot against the floor. “She wanted me to be safe,” he said. “If me having the Saviour’s protection for the rest of my life brings her peace, then…” He shrugged.
“Merlin. I really hope you never regret that,” he’d breathed against Harry’s mouth, their foreheads resting together.
“Good.” Malfoy shot him an incredulous look and pulled out his wand. “Well then. Your mental space.”
of practising, under literal threat of death. You got a boner you were embarrassed about and figured it out overnight.”
The jittering of my restless legs is making the table shudder. The empty glasses twitch across the surface; if I’m not careful, they’ll end up on the floor. According to my watch, it’s only been three minutes, but it feels like thirty. If I wait any longer I’ll talk myself out of it.
“See? Harry’s comfortable with him already. Wait – really, Harry?” Ron pulled a face. “That’s fucked up – ow!” There was a scuffle on their side of the table. Hermione pulled her hand back and rested it primly in front of her.
Draco gave him a look that said he knew Harry was being an idiot on purpose but he wasn’t entirely sure why. “I’m positive it hasn’t escaped your notice that it’s the Friday before Christmas,” he said, sniffing. “Why have you chosen this moment to take an interest in paperwork when I have to bribe you with increasingly ridiculous incentives to get you to even glance at it the rest of the year?”
“Luckily, I’ve never cared the slightest bit what you think,” Malfoy says loftily, then swoops forwards and kisses him.
“You came.” His voice was soft. Harry narrowed his eyes and strode towards the bed, drawing his wand.
produced the weakest flickers of light, the dying sputter of a candle almost burned out. He was vaguely concerned that Grimmauld Place would kick him out, too—he was well aware of the Black family’s attitude towards Muggles and Squibs—but Kreacher assured him that
Harry allowed himself to be carried by the current of the magic until he found himself standing on a Quidditch pitch. A faint smell of flowers was carried by a cool wind that ruffled the hair on the back of his neck. Across from him stood seven students in red and gold robes. One of them had messy black hair and round-rimmed glasses.
“It’s there,” Malfoy clarified, pointing over Harry’s shoulder. “Please, do not hesitate to use it.”
“Well, it was such a shocking sound. It was like a person was pointedly expressing displeasure to a pretentious prick on patrol from the Magical Law Enforcement department.” He looked at Malfoy meaningfully. “So I suppose if I had to paint a specific picture, I’d say … it had the horrifying air of a cry of an Auror’s prostitute.”
Ron’s reaction was, admittedly, alarming; Ron was hardly shy about mocking people, but Harry had never heard him so outraged. How bad did someone have to be before laid-back Ron called them slimy and evil? And it wasn’t just Ron – there had been that tangible frostiness from Hermione, back in Brisley’s office. Who was Draco Malfoy? And what had he done to make Harry’s friends dislike him so much?
“You can’t know that. You don’t know me.” He cursed the way his voice sounded broken, cruelly honest.
She faced him. “We know they don’t like you already, so we take precaution. I’d say don’t let go of my hand, but I don’t trust them. So I’ll tie us up, okay? Still, try to hold my hand at all times.”
Yet, here he was, lost in the forest with a crazy man that had lured Draco there by convincing a bird—the only one from that forest that seemed to have accepted Draco—to drag him by the sleeve. It had to mean something, whatever Rudá wanted with him.
Draco’s nightmare, he realised, was being without Harry. Nightmares were coming to life, but he wouldn’t let it happen. “I can do that. You know it, otherwise you wouldn’t have come back. You’re such a coward.” Draco tsked, rolling his eyes.
“He’s a friend of mine,” Potter said, pointing to where Draco had taken a seat on a bench under a tree by the edge of the field. “From Hogwarts.”
Potter was already moving ahead of him, beckoning grandly for Draco to follow. “Come, now. You’ll love it. This is the Living Section,” Potter told him, pointing at the area to their right.
The noises of the party were muffled at that height, and the only things Draco heard, beside the leaves, were the singing of the birds, the deafening cicadas, and Harry’s voice encouraging him whenever his shoulders sagged a little or he sighed. “You’re doing great, love. We’re almost there. Keep going.”
healthy?” Draco nodded at her questioning glance. “Healthy boy. But Jurupari, God of Darkness, you remember about him, right? He was jealous of the boy and decided to kill him, when he was…” she seemed confused for a moment, “taking fruits in the forest.”
But the truth was: Potter trusted him too much, when Draco himself wasn’t sure he deserved that trust. Or that he trusted himself.
And that was also what might have caused the end of his engagement, if he was being honest. Draco said some nasty things to Martin in the end. His ex had believed half of them, but Draco knew that most of what he said wasn't true. He didn’t try to rectify himself when he shoved the ring into Martin’s chest, nor when he left England. There was no point in fixing a relationship he didn’t want anymore, and Martin was better off without him.
Draco was used to the weight of Nazaré’s body crumpling him down in the middle of the night by now, and he didn’t even wake up to her anymore. But
Draco sighed, resting his head against wood. “Not entirely. They can’t remember who they were before they were administered the potion and the obeying urges don’t vanish completely.” The other effects of the Moriaetem Potion had been treated using advanced counter-potions to Amortentia and Calming Draught, but the most important ones, the ones Draco couldn’t figure out, still affected those people on some level.
“Hey, Lua.” Potter approached her slowly, his smile wavering. She definitely gave the impression of someone to be feared, but Draco didn’t think he’d ever seen Potter waver in front of anyone. “I knew we could find you here. This is Dr—”
Draco huffed a breath. “Right. I’m moving back to the guest room, but I’m not leaving if that’s what you’re expecting. I’m going to fix this, and I’m doing it alone.”
The thought that he’d have trouble sleeping in an unfamiliar environment proved to be in vain. That first night, exhaustion crept into Draco’s body and claimed him for a restful slumber as soon as his head hit the pillow.
And, oh, Draco did remember the story about Jurupari, the only other wizard not to be accepted inside the school. The God of Darkness, or Demon of Dreams, Tainara had said. He had been the creature who had killed the boy that God Tupã had blessed in the story about the origin of the guarana, the plant Draco was so obsessed with. Now that it lay hot on his palm, all Draco wished was to destroy it.
Harry’s eyes held Draco’s entire world, the green from the forest surrounding them, golden strands around his irises glinting with every unspoken feeling, with every secret Draco
“It’s too late, Draco,” Tainara continued, her smirk turning impossibly larger. She shook her head and moved her hand up, throwing something she held up in the air, catching it, and then repeating the motion. “It’s too late.”
Draco didn’t let her finish, raising a placating hand. “I really appreciate your help, but I don’t think Homunin will be very pleased with me if I keep contradicting it. I need to get accepted by the ritual. There’s no other way.”
However, the school was numb. Even when the sun was up and bright, everything seemed quieter, as if all the secrets had been laid bare when the shadows were taken from them. There was no way of hiding now. Everything, and everyone, was exposed.
“Ye’re no fun,” Saci grumbled, but he was smiling—an occurrence that was becoming quite normal during the last few weeks.
Harry’s grin turned mischievous as he pressed a greenish fruit to Draco’s palm. It smelled sweet, something between a pineapple and melon, but so unlike both.
Instead, he took Draco to what seemed to be another one of the interminable cabins. Upon inspection, however, Draco soon realised it was not the same structure. The wooden pillars formed what looked like an open barn.
“There was a young Carajá indigenous boy who loved nature, and talking to animals and birds. He loved watching the stars before going to sleep. However, one night, the Carajá noticed the sky was empty, darkness stretching all around. He asked, ‘Why is the sky so empty?’ But the animals and birds pretended they didn’t hear, and so the Carajá repeated it. ‘Please, tell me,’ he pleaded.
Draco wasn’t sure that it should be called a car. It looked far too old and unstable for a task such as taking them places.
The darkness came to him, as if his and Saci’s magic were a magnet and Draco was the inter-mediating instrument. He fought it; the energy threatening his body, its control. He fought it with the only thing he was sure was real inside him; the love Draco felt for Harry. The certainty that the day would be over and things would be good and Harry would hold him again.
Three doors later, he stumbled upon a large study. A mahogany table stood by the window, accompanied by two upholstered armchairs in front of the hearth. Just like most of the other rooms, long panel windows covered the external walls from ceiling to floor. And where there were no windows, the walls were covered in shelves, spilling with hundreds of books. Draco smirked, perusing the stacks of tomes. Potter certainly had help in assembling that collection, he figured, smiling to himself.
“Fuck! Draco, what—” Harry tried to keep him at arm's length, but Draco kept pulling closer, leaning against the strong, warm chest. Machado had traded Draco’s shoulder for a branch on a tree nearby, and Draco tried not to think too much about how he
“That’s reassuring,” Draco muttered, fingers twitching with the need to break something. Potter’s neck would do, but he didn’t want to get too close.
Maybe it was his birthday weighing on him on top of the frustration that had been building inside of Draco since before his fight with Harry. Time hadn't stopped just because Draco seemed frozen in place. That he had to spend this day, of all others, alone when he had expected to have Harry by his side was even worse.
“I thought you said you would not help,” Draco growled, trying to command his stomach to stop turning around all the food he had eaten earlier that day.
Draco frowned, trying to suppress his own stubborn grin. “It’s fascinating the amount of bonding you people seem to do around here. Are you sure this is healthy, Potter? You seem a little off. I wouldn’t want the Saviour of Us All to feel discombobulated.”
Harry had said sometimes dreams came to life in Homunin, but that was… That was beyond anything Draco had ever imagined.
Francisca’s lips made an “oh” shape, and she reached a hand for it. Draco let her, easily slipping the object into the professor’s fingers.
The push was so strong Draco almost fell back. He planted his feet on the ground, grabbing the seed hidden in his pocket—still open, still empty, and powered his magic even more.
