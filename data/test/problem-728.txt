"Blaise Zabini," Draco said, dragging out the name as though he liked the sound of Zabini on his tongue.
But Draco was beyond caring. He'd spent last night getting off to thoughts of Harry's mouth, to the way his fingers would feel pressing into Draco's skin. He saw Harry's clothes and imagined removing them one at a time, stopping to dig his hands into the planes of Harry's chest, into his shoulders. If he could have the chance, he'd drag it out, push and press until he'd driven them both mad with the want. Until all they could think about was the next step and the one after, until there was nothing left of them but the deep building pleasure.
And yet, she still couldn’t shake it. The taste of blood in her mouth. The shattered purple eyes of the tiger-masked witch. A broken figure in the grass.
Draco kisses him again, as if to say, I do, too.
Draco was waiting at the foot of the stairwell when Harry entered the main hall. His nose was buried in some sort of Potions history book, and he didn’t look up until Harry joined him. Together, they started up the stairs, and Draco dropped the volume into his satchel, openly adorned with the squid pin.
Trying to cast a Patronus pushed Draco to his limit.
“I apologize for my offenses toward you in the past, Granger,” Malfoy said sincerely. “And that goes for you as well, Weasley.”
Luckily for the athletes, the freezing rain stopped just before school let out. Clouds still loomed overhead, but they were starting to break into innocent wisps. Students, mostly from Ravenclaw and Slytherin, trudged across the frosty grass to the Quidditch pitch. Harry, Ron, and Hermione spotted Luna and Ginny within the flow of people and jogged to meet them.
“It’ll be great, you’ll see,” Ginny singsonged.
“Yes. My father never cared about them, obviously. But I helped them on their way.” Draco couldn’t help but puff his chest a little; he was proud of what he’d done, how he’d found these girls better work.
meant some version of
Crimson flowers bloom on white tile. Harry doesn’t cry, doesn’t gasp, only stands open-mouthed over his own blood. His mind, leached of dopamine, carries him to such delirium that he laughs in surprise. Who knew kitchen knives could be that sharp?
One by one, the memories click by. An asinine argument over a group project that leaves both Harry and Malfoy nearly in tears. Malfoy’s shocked face, drawing Harry’s attention through a blur of rain as he holds Ginny close after a post-game kiss. A tense game of chess, tradition between the two Salisbury house presidents, that ends in a draw, and in a barrage of insults and accusations. Harry coming to blows with one of Malfoy’s male friends after a snide comment directed at Hermione, Malfoy hovering nearby, unwilling to stop them. The ruthless presidential campaigns, and the sinking dismay when Harry and Malfoy realized they’d both won. The first, and only, time Harry saw Malfoy cry, slumped against the lockers after one of his first weeks at a new school.
Her words painted such an accurate portrait of Draco, Harry was embarrassed that he hadn’t seen it sooner - that Draco would be much happier sweating over a cauldron than on the battlefield. Harry knew that in his heart of hearts, so why didn’t he connect the dots?
“Uh, yeah. I was sleeping. Am I late?” Harry noticed a gray feather clinging to Draco’s clothes, and he reached forward and plucked it off.
“Getting along is putting it lightly,” Harry said with a grin, catching Draco’s eye, and his pale cheeks flushed.
"You could say that again," Harry replied as Draco rubbed his thumb back and forth across Harry's hand as he held it. The movement was strangely comforting and familiar, and Harry found himself enjoying it. "You have soft hands," He told Draco.
In which Draco, Harry, and Joey carry on.
Padma rests her hands on the marbled, laminate countertop and meets her own eyes in the mirror. “Can she leave?” She asks, politely, without giving anything away.
When Harry has finished, Draco doesn’t speak for a long while. He looks out towards the town, facing away from Harry. For a moment, his image flickers, then returns to solidity.
The news reached Harry as he arrived from Quidditch practice - Ginny insisted on having a few friendly scrimmages before the end of the year, for the fun of it -, broom in hand, sweat drying on his forehead. Draco looked over his shoulder from the sofa and said, silver eyes alight, “There’s a ball next week.”
Harry could handle not having him around for a few days. It was the not knowing that he was okay, having no idea what the Room of Requirement was doing to him, unsure if Draco would even emerge. The worries woke Harry every following night, leaving him drenched in sweat and his ears searching the silence for a sign of Draco’s return. Between dodging his classmate’s blows and studying in the most secluded parts of the castle, Harry wandered the seventh-floor corridor, pacing, repeating every variation of
“Apparently.” Draco frowned as he watched Harry fiddle with his tie. “What are you doing?”
Cup in hand, Harry made his way back up to the top floor, jumping a little every time the thunder surprised him. So distracting was the howling wind and Ron’s snores that Harry almost didn’t hear the crying.
The silence that followed was dripping in awkwardness. Draco had cast his eyes to the ground again, flushed from ear to ear. Harry grappled with the words tumbling in his mind, trying to piece together the appropriate response. All he knew was that Draco had given him - Harry Potter! Of all people - extremely sensitive, personal information.
The idea for
“Probably think I’m a vampire,” He said amusedly, holding his hand to the light, and in fact, his skin was so pale in the brightness it was almost translucent.
Joey slipped out her wand and transfigured the croissant wrapper into a brown-feathered duck. It promptly jumped out of her hand, quacking gleefully as it noisily splashed into the river. “And if I leave? Where will I go?”
“They’ll die.” Joey looked at the dragon, at the dozen or so wizards, armed with God-knows-what, in the cramped space.
You have changed, though, haven’t you? Harry wonders as Draco’s hand, pale and warm, retreats from his. Brushing aside the whole changing-genders thing (a concept that Harry chooses to wrap his head around later), Draco seems freer, more open, his posture less rigid that it used to be, smile lines more defined. Harry hopes that, in turn, Draco will find him equally easier to get along with. Perhaps Harry can repay him, after all those years of heartache.
“I was twelve. I could have
A few moments of silence ensued. Hermione and Ron, sitting across from each other, gave Luna a glance; the blonde-haired girl was watching Draco with bright, curious eyes. Draco, who was trapped between Harry and the window, pointedly avoided her gaze. Harry could tell by the tension in Draco’s shoulders that he was uncomfortable, being the outsider in a tightly-knit group.
“Oh - showing affection in public, are we?” Draco snickers, ruffling Harry’s hair. “I’ll let it slide for now.” He kisses him on the cheek.
When they reached the door, Harry’s face fell slightly, and he started to let go of Draco’s hand. Draco tightened his hold.
Narcissa scoffed. “Lucius loves you, Draco.”
“And I’m glad someone actually appreciates me in this godforsaken place,” Marisa replied. With two firm sweeps of her wand, she shut the heavy door behind them and activated the locking mechanisms within. The metallic bolts clicked into place, mostly shutting out the roar of the never-ending storm. “Follow me.”
“Because we’re idiots,” Ron stated, and Hermione looked to the ground in shame. “And because we’re afraid of losing you.”
“That is correct, Mr. Potter.”
As Joey drew closer, the krasue snarled again, its sharp teeth grinding in frustration. “Cruel woman,” It snapped, “Vicious child, you won’t last much longer out here. I see evil in you. Let me have it. I’ll render it limb from limb.” It cackled, bloated tongue lolling, intestines squirming on their own.
“Apparently. Asked out Andreas yet?”
“We might run into Ginny,” Harry says slowly.
Draco only nodded, shoving his hands into his robe pockets, not something he did very often: a clear sign that he didn’t want to talk.
“From you, little boy,” The witch said disdainfully, “Nothing.”
“Stay,” Draco said immediately. “Please?”
“No!” Harry flung himself forward without thinking, and for a moment, he felt only a slight wrapping sensation around his chest as the spell connected…
“Not anymore!”
And her fingers hit the shape of a vial.
His throat seemed sticky, and he shook his head silently.
“Er…yeah, I suppose I could.”
“No!” Harry’s heart leaped into his throat.
“Pity.”
He could pretend. Instead, he refocused on reality and on the orange and blue streetlights outside. The late afternoon lull had disappeared, replaced with the busy thrum of nighttime.
The gnome took the opportunity to bite Draco with its razor-sharp teeth, and the wizard gave a cry, dropping the creature. “Son of a…” Draco inhaled sharply as crimson blood dripped from his hand onto the snow-covered ground. Shaking away the pain, he read the address on the letter, eyes widening in astonishment.
One person with pink fishnets and a black-and-white striped mane cried, “Hey!”
best friend? Ron, by all accounts, was not an unkind person, but he drew the line at Draco Malfoy.
“Call me Ollie,” Corrected one Hufflepuff boy, his grin full of lime-green braces and a ballpoint pen poking out from behind his ear, nearly covered by a mop of dark hair. Harry guessed he was Muggleborn. “Valdez, sixth year. Harry Potter, of course. And it’s Malfoy, right?” He spoke rapidly, sticking out a sun-dark hand for two hasty shakes from each young man.
Reluctant as he was to admit it, even to himself, Harry knew that his hands shook at the idea of sex because of uneasiness more than lust.
“Sort of,” Harry replied, shaking it.
“Hear what?” Draco’s words slur, and Harry glances at him, horrified, because he can see straight through him to the leather booth.
Draco looked at Harry and Joey to see how they were taking the news. Their faces were grim but set with acceptance.
As you can likely tell, I went in a decidedly different direction from previous chapters. I wanted to provide a glimpse into Draco's character and motivations. I know some of you were asking where Draco was in chapter eight, so here's your answer!
he didn’t say, but Joey knew he was thinking it.
“Yeah, but …it’s not over yet.”
The sound had alerted the two figures down the road. Both turned, muttering, metal flashing at their waists. Joey stepped into a lake of moonlight, her wand visible. The two men’s scowls were closer. She could count the bullets slung across their torsos. Warning sparks flew from the tip of her wand, and the soldiers raised their guns.
The smell of sickly, grandmotherly perfume and hand sanitizer greets Harry as he meanders into a waiting room, walls paneled with wood and lined with old, green chairs. A few people sit, faces lined with regret and despair, each holding a box, a pillowcase, or a garbage bag full of various items, from clothes to stuffed animals to trophies. Harry turns away from them to the receptionist’s desk at the end of the room. The receptionist, a young woman with long, wavy blond hair and a dreamy expression, holds a phone to her ear.
“I just find it hard to believe…” Ginny trailed off, too vexed to finish her sentence.
“More like a pet. Maybe the two experiences are similar.” Draco slurps down the rest of his milkshake, wincing slightly - brain freeze. “I wouldn’t know.”
The fear in Draco’s eyes was palpable. Pansy’s lip curled, and a fierce anger pierced through Harry, unbidden. “Shut it,” He growled, standing up.
An interruption swooped over them in the form of a flock of owls. A small, tawny one landed in front of Hermione. The
Joey shrugged. “As much as someone like him can.”
“Only if you like them, sweetheart.”
Hundreds of candles cast a glow over the surface, and Harry thought he spotted flashes of mermaid scales, and once, the massive, scarlet form of the giant squid. The boats floated in a crowded semicircle around the largest one, where Headmistress McGonagall and the four house heads stood, all dressed in black. Despite not being present for the battle, Professor Dahlia looked as solemn as the others, bowing her head as the students gathered.
“Urgh, I never want to work with those again,” Hermione groaned, combing through her thick mane for stray twigs.
“Um, I’m going to get another Chocolate Frog,” Harry stammered, leaping up from his seat.
“Joey,” He said stiffly.
“Well, I thought you might appreciate the symbolism.”
“Okay. See you later,” Harry replied, and she drifted off. “So…there’s a vigil?”
There was only one thing to do.
“How many?”
“All yours,” Draco called, and he let the creature free. Joey flicked her wrist, muttering a spell, and a bolt of energy slammed into its flesh, crackling loudly. The krasue hissed in pain, skull hitting a stone building with a sound like a gunshot.
But everything is different now, because this is a memory, and Harry remembers tenfold just how far he felt from being Draco’s, and how far he felt from belonging to himself. He drifts in a void, lost without love, indifference, nor hate. The limbo lends him no service.
He glanced at Harry, weighing the companionable distance between them and the way he had Harry's undivided attention. It was the most Harry had acknowledged anyone since he'd gotten to Parkinson Manor and everyone around them knew it.
Harry sent three more bouquets that week, each of them carrying more enchantments than the last. By the time the Greengrass dinner rolled around on Friday, Draco had received a bouquet that was enchanted to blow bubbles every time Draco walked past, a single rose that changed colour depending on the recipient's mood, and a bunch of lilies that changed shapes depending on how much sun they got. Every gift was unnecessary, expensive, and accompanied with a note that said, "these reminded me of you."
Draco seemed to consider the idea momentarily, and why shouldn't he? Harry knew that if ever married, the most logical choice would be to marry into the Weasley family. He already considered them family, already spent the holidays with them, already suppressed crushes on various members of the Weasley family. If he were looking to get married, he'd pick any Weasley who would have him. If he were Draco, he'd do the same.
He went down to breakfast feeling rather pleased with himself and was just digging into his eggs when Pansy Apparated into the library. It had to be Pansy because she was the only person besides Draco and their mother who was allowed through the wards without question. Narcissa, who was reading the daily Lady Red column, didn't even glance up as Draco stood from his chair. He offered his excuses and went out to meet Pansy.
"I thought that was you hiding in the corner," she said. "Running from the loud Bulstrode cousin or from your mother?"
They finally figure out the Azkaban situation at the beginning of October. Harry does a lot of running around trying to get departments to give up staff and Hermione and Ron do the same. In the end, they manage to scrape together enough people so that there's no need to ever consider the Dementors again. Bartholomew puts up a fight, and Harry has to remind himself that an outright duel with the man would just unnecessarily postpone the third meeting from hell.
"We can't leave you waiting, now can we?" Harry had said, shaking his head when Draco had laid out the plan for how events would go.
God, he still looked so good even as angry as he was, and Harry had to stop himself from reaching out. Draco stood before him, pale and shaking with barely concealed fury, and all Harry could think about was how much he still wanted him.
"I read about the Weasleys," Draco said. "And before you say anything, no, I am not above marrying a Weasley if it meant I'd made a good match."
And, okay, it's not exactly what Harry had in mind but he can't really complain, later, when he and Draco are lying in bed and he can still taste chocolate and berries on his tongue.
"Shut up," Draco says, throwing an arm around Harry to pull him into a kiss.
Eventually, the anger fell away from Pansy's face and all that was left in its wake was a long look of pity. "Oh, Draco," she said.
But all that mattered was that Harry closed the last of the space between them. All that mattered was that those hands pulled his hair back so that Draco had no choice but to go where Harry put him.
So as they stood on that bridge, the wind blowing over the lake, Draco's pupils blown wide with want, Harry knew it was time. He had to break their agreement before either of them did something they would later regret.
It has to be worth a shot, Harry thinks as he heads back to the kitchen. Draco's still standing by the stove, stirring something Harry can't see. He takes a moment to enjoy the way Draco knows where to find what he's looking for, how he fits in Harry's kitchen, in his flat.
"You bought me a cellphone," Draco says.
That much was obvious to Draco even across the room. Weasley had abandoned him to Elise Abbott of all people, and Draco had to wonder whether Weasley was attempting to punish Potter for some wrongdoing. Everyone knew that Elise Abbott was absolutely mad with jealousy over her niece's engagement to Neville Longbottom and that her new goal in life was to find her daughter an even richer and better-connected husband.
about five times over the course of his almost four-month relationship with Draco.
He tried to say something but Harry didn't let him. He made sure he had Draco's undivided attention as he lowered his voice.
And it's the mousse cake all over again as Harry gets lost in the overwhelming heat, in the way Draco twists under Harry as Harry gets his hand around Draco's throat, presses down just enough for Draco to feel it. It's so much easier to just focus on what they're doing, on that low whine in Draco's throat, how he gasps beneath Harry's hand and comes with Harry's name on his lips.
Still, it rankled that word was spreading throughout the room about Harry's obvious absence. He could see Elise with a group of mothers eyeing him from across the room. He'd already gotten and accepted two invitations to dance and had been asked twice when Harry would be arriving. Now, Draco leaned against the wall, playing with the necklace in his pocket, thinking about what he should and shouldn't do. He hadn't seen the Weasleys all evening either, and he was just starting to talk himself down from anger to worry, when he caught sight of Bill Weasley's long red hair.
- Lady Red's Society Papers, Volume 1, Ed. 10.
Harry had been drinking black tea with milk and sugar and Draco had jasmine green tea, no sugar, no milk. Harry had watched him, had pressed a little harder about steeped leaves and how unfortunate Draco's choices were. Draco had rolled his eyes and in the fading afternoon light, he'd seemed heartbreakingly beautiful.
The problem with owning Muggle technology and refusing to completely shut himself off from Muggle current events is that Draco spends a lot of his time at Harry's asking how everything works. Harry, in turn, spends a lot of the same time annoyed at the nonstop barrage of questions that make less sense the more Harry explains. The Internet is the biggest source of mystery and, therefore, what Draco asks about most often.
He could practically feel the interested looks from the group of mother's across the room. Mrs Weasly was among them, a contemplative look in her eyes as she looked from Harry to Charlie and back. It didn't matter that Charlie didn't want to get married. Mrs Weasley was on a hunt for decent matches for her children and there was little anyone could do to stop her.
He didn't want that level expression on Draco's face. He wanted a fight. He wanted Draco angry and biting, his sharp wit battling against Harry's unrepentant disregard for pureblood traditions. He wanted to push until Draco pushed back, until they stood so close Harry could count Draco's eyelashes, until he had to stop himself from closing the distance between them. He wanted those leather gloves on his bare arm, fingers digging in until they hurt, until Draco proved his point and Harry had to be the one to pull away before he did anything he might regret.
After the War, it had mattered more that he never lost sight of Ron and Hermione than it had mattered that he was safe and comfortable. He'd put up with the trials, with the interviews, with the awestruck gazes and the constant demand for his time. He'd only been able to sleep when he knew Ron and Hermione were in the room with him, when he'd been able to reach out and touch them.
He hears Draco sniff as he orders their food. But by the time Harry goes back into the living room, Draco's already sitting on the sofa, turning the cellphone on and off.
"You would rather die than marry me?" Draco asked, the first hint of sorrow in his voice.
Harry rolls his eyes. "Ron," he says by way of explanation.
"I never said there weren't," Harry answered.
"I saw her with it, was curious, and asked her. She was happy to lend it to me," Draco says.
Harry goes, close enough that Draco can put his hands in Harry's hair, but with enough space between them that Harry can still see Draco laid out beneath him. Harry wants to touch him everywhere, press into him until his presence in Draco's life is undeniable.
"Have a good day, McLaggen," Harry said, lifting his own bouquet in farewell as he turned towards the Manor.
Harry looked from the women to Cormac to Draco. He flexed and as he did, he saw Draco's mouth drop open just a bit. Harry did it again, passing off the move as him needing to roll up his sleeves further. He was gratified to see Draco's eyes following the flex of his muscles, how he didn't seem to notice the way he pressed the tip of his tongue to his lip.
"Right, so my poetry is limited to what I learned from Ginny, but here goes," Harry says, clearing his throat as he pulls out the small piece of parchment. "Your eyes are as grey as Earl Grey tea / Your hair is as light as a chickpea / I wish you were mine, you're really divine / the one man who I want to love me."
"My mother?" Draco asked.
What she was really looking for was a Weasley and if the woman had any sense, she'd be across the room trying to get into Mrs Weasley's good graces. But Draco supposed that not everyone could have common sense and that to Elise Abbott, nabbing Harry Potter would more than make up for Hannah Abbott's engagement announcement. And though the woman was insufferable as all hell, and rather too ambitious for her own good, she wasn't wrong. Potter was the most eligible bachelor in the room, by far the richest and most well-connected, despite his long absence.
He'd lay awake at night and think of Draco dressed in the latest fashions, how blue made him seem much paler than he was, how green suited him, how Harry had yet to see him look better than he did in black and gold. Even as they walked now, he couldn't help but focus on the heat of Draco at his side, how even though their skin didn't touch, Harry could feel the phantom press of Draco's arm against his.
It was Harry who demanded entry, but it was Draco who pulled Harry's thumb into his mouth and sucked. He was the one who made eye contact and kept it, his mouth hanging open at the look on Harry's face. He looked ruined, as though he was in pain and there was nothing he could do to stop it. They looked at each other for a moment, their bodies pressed together as Harry pushed down on Draco's tongue. And then Harry moved his hand to Draco's hair. Draco could feel the heat from Harry's mouth as Harry brought their foreheads together, his fingers tangling in Draco's hair and pulling.
Harry did know. He'd been gone for years, away from Wizarding society with nothing but the countryside and the little Muggle town with its single pub. He'd spent many nights there drinking and getting to know the people in the area. He wasn't Harry Potter, Wizarding Britain's Greatest War Hero, there. He was just another young man out to cause trouble.
All that's to say that Harry's not overlooking the miracle that's their schedules matching up and making this date night possible. Harry intends to use the atmosphere of the place and the overeagerness of the waitstaff to his full advantage. See, Harry James Potter—Wizarding Britain's Most Eligible Bachelor, six years running, Darling of the Ministry, and Future Head Auror—has a plan.
They haven't had a moment to themselves since the meeting with Kinglsey and the other Department Heads, a week since the restaurant. A week since Draco had laid Harry out in bed and licked chocolate and raspberries off him. He'd fucked Harry nice and slow and it had been worth the ruined attempt at telling Draco he loved him.
Amateurs, the lot of them. Pathetic creatures who didn't understand the most basic rule of highbred society. If one was to drape themselves in jewels and rich fabric, then one had to make sure they could carry it.
It was maddening, especially that day, weeks into their fake courtship, as they walked around the park, the clouds threatening rain above them. They were in plain view of many mothers and their children, so Harry moved a little closer to Draco, knowing that having so many eyes on them would keep them safe. They could do what they wanted in the presence of others because so long as someone was watching them, they had the excuse of propriety on their side. It was always what could happen when no one was watching that could ruin everything, things that Harry couldn't help thinking about in the darkness of his bedroom.
"Wait," he says. "What about the chocolate mousse cake?"
Harry blinked rapidly, his eyes finding Draco but not focusing. "What?" he asked.
"The gossip is rarely ever true, Pansy," Draco said, eyes still locked on Bulstrode.
"Ask me whatever you want," Harry says, watching as Draco slides open the phone screen over and over. "Today we can look at all the Muggle technology you want and I'll answer all your questions."
"So tell me again exactly what you did?" Hermione asks for the third time.
"How did you get Hermione to lend you that?" Harry asks, momentarily forgetting the last few minutes.
He felt their repressed emotions like a ball in his chest, something hard to swallow, as he surveyed the room. Everyone was so at home, safe in the knowledge of the unspoken rules of courting. Even the sharp-eyed mothers and the blank-faced chaperones moved as though they belonged among the masses. Harry could tell right away that he wouldn't fit in, and he couldn't imagine Ginny or Ron feeling at home in the overly decorated Parkinson ballroom or among the people dripping in jewels.
He can already see tomorrow's Prophet headline, a side shot of him and Draco at their table, leaning forward to talk to each other. Draco in his charcoal trousers and blazer, his black shirt buttoned to the top underneath. He's wearing a silver tie so he looks extra put together, though Harry had been counting on it when he'd asked Draco out today. He, himself, had put in a little extra effort, had worn his dark jeans and a deep green shirt that Hermione had given him on his last birthday. Everything tailored so that it looks expensive.
Draco raised an eyebrow and said nothing.
Draco nodded, keeping his eyes away from Alice's horrified expression. "It would be my pleasure," he said.
They ran into each other in the foyer.
Harry watches him go, helplessly. "Merlin knows why I love you," he says, shaking his head. "But I do."
"I didn't," Draco says, frowning. "Was it something important?"
He thinks of nights alone in this flat as he watches Mark knocking on Juliet's door. He'd been alone for a long time so he knows how to recognize the feeling of belonging. He knows that the certainty that Draco will be there in the morning is good and special and important.
He can feel the heat crawling up the back of his neck and he doesn't know why it's so hard to just say what he feels. Harry trusts Ron and Hermione, knows they won't laugh. If there's anywhere he should be able to speak openly, it's there with them.
Harry pulls out the piece of parchment that holds his only attempt at poetry and hands it to Ron. Hermione snatches the parchment away and turns back to Harry.
"So this proposition," Harry said.
"I see," Harry said, raising an eyebrow.
Not that Draco could put the blame solely on Potter. But it had been refreshing over the years to have someone to direct his anger towards. Someone who was not around to be hurt, but who could provide some release for the pent-up frustrations that came with being disgraced. He blamed Potter for how he had to shamelessly parade himself in front of potential suitors, hoping that one of them would be rich enough to guarantee his future.
He started pacing in the hall just past the entrance to Grimmauld Place. The house had been his godfather's and Harry used it on the rare occasions he'd snuck back to London. It was the last possession belonging to the Black family, aside from the stack of gold in Gringotts, and as Harry paced along the hallway, he started thinking of repairs, of the things he might need to do to make the place livable. It might be nice to be able to breathe life back into his godfather's last home because, despite the house's history, it was all Harry had left of Sirius.
For now, Harry just picks up the TV remote and restarts the movie.
For a moment, Draco wished that he could be the focus of that attention, that he might feel the full force of Harry Potter's attentions. But before he could give in and close the distance between them, he heard the clicking of his mother's shoes along the wooden floors. Harry heard it too, because he stood quickly, running his hands over his jacket to make it lie straight.
"Wouldn't dream of it," Harry said.
Everything else was a blur as Draco made it to the front door and out into the first garden section. He inhaled deeply, each breath dragging slowly, rasping against his throat. He tugged at the collar of his dress robes until it loosened enough to give him room to take a breath. He could still hear the music coming from the ballroom so he kept going, down the steps, past a second garden section.
The man was fit, dressed over-the-top but attractive, and as Harry started to point him out to Ron, the man turned and Harry saw that it was none other than Draco Malfoy. The white blond hair registered at once, the obvious display of wealth as Draco basically dripped with gold. He looked a hundred times better than he had at the trials, well-rested and groomed to perfection. Everything from his demeanour to the way he surveyed the room spoke to an ease that Harry envied.
The truth was that he'd have been wasting his time at any of the Zabini events before he and Harry had started their fake courtship. He'd known that the chances of him making a decent match had been low, and Blaise wasn't the type of friend to give anyone false hope. Which meant that if he was inviting Draco to events now, it meant that he thought Draco had a chance at making a good match.
“I dunno, Padma. Can you stop pretending like you know everything?”
“Did you know about this?” Harry demands.
“Merlin, Joey, I’m his husb- his boyfriend!” Harry clammed up, cheeks rosing, and meekly righted his chair as if he hadn’t been yelling a moment ago.
Draco smirked, but he said nothing.
After only five minutes of pages turning and quills scratching, Hermione let out another sigh. “Oh, Harry. You’re only on number four?”
Harry looked at the bodies, glassy-eyed on the stained sidewalk, and the blue-robed criminals, still close enough to apprehend. Something struggled in his wide green eyes. “But-”
Thankfully, Draco left for bed at some point during the night, so Harry was spared some explaining when Ron found him asleep in front of the window. “Dreams,” Harry said quickly, and Ron nodded knowingly.
“Away where?” Joey had known different houses, cities, and time zones for the past five years. Any place was “away.”
•  •  •
“Feel okay?” Harry glanced over at Draco as they ambled along the village’s main street.
A shard of ice seemed to imbed itself in Draco’s chest. “Are you sure he’d want to see me?”
“I’m fine, thank you, though.” Hermione sounded genuinely grateful, but Ron noticed the despondent undertone in her voice. She seemed a little sad these days, ever since their row with Harry. Well…
“Yeah, well, I wasn’t born into a family of Death Eaters.” As Harry spoke, he walked over to stand in front of Draco. Their eyes met, and from the emerald pair, a wordless proclamation was issued - a challenge. “You can change, Draco Malfoy. Prove to them,” His gesturing hand included all the world, “That you’re not as bad as they say you are. The Weasleys have seen it, Hermione and Ron and Ginny have seen it, Merlin knows Luna’s seen it. I know you’re a good person, somewhere in there. It’s time you knew it as well.”
"Yeah, well, it's not my fault you never taught me what fork to use for what course," Harry says. "I did wear the suit like you asked. I feel like that alone should've been enough."
Back then, there'd been nothing in his life that belonged to him alone. Everywhere he turned, he saw the influence of someone else. He'd been training to be an Auror because Ron was doing it, because of course, he had to be there if Ron was willing to continue the fight. He'd been dating Ginny because if he married her, he'd belong to the Weasley family permanently. Unequivocally.
"Won't your mother wonder where you've gone?" Harry asked.
Harry has to fix this but as he stares at Draco's increasingly suspicious expression, he can't think of anything except the truth. Then, Harry tries to wrap his head around explaining the days that he's spent failing to tell Draco that he loves him and it seems foolish. There's no reason for Draco to know yet. Not when Harry can't even figure out something as simple as, "I love you."
He stepped forward towards the gate and as Harry watched, the veil came back down, effectively blocking Cormac's entrance. Neither of them said anything a moment as Cormac stepped back. The veil lifted and when he made his way forward, it dropped down again. Harry's mouth twitched as he stepped under the veil and crossed the gate. Cormac glared at him, his hand tightening on his bouquet of flowers until one of the stems snapped.
"Just a tad over the top," Harry nodded, laying the flowers on his lap as he sat.
"Yes," Harry agreed.
Draco stepped forward again, his hands finding the sides of Harry's face as he pulled him in close. "Marry me," he said in between kisses. "Marry me and I promise to work every day of my life to make you happy."
His hands are hard on Harry's back, his legs wrapped around Harry's thighs. He feels good, warm and welcoming, the harsh sounds of his breaths letting Harry know that he's enjoying the slow drag of it. Outside, the day is cool, their open window blowing in the smells of early fall rain. September is a good month because it means that there's a lull in departmental investigations into Improper Use of Magic as students head back to Hogwarts. It means that Draco's here with Harry, asking him to go slower, to really make him feel it.
“I have a few more places I want to take you,” Draco said, giving him a mysterious smile. “But I’m not telling you where, yet. I like to see the look on your face when you realise where we are.”
“Ron told me what’s happened. I did think it was unusual that we hadn’t heard from him over the last couple of days but I assumed he was just busy,” she said, straightening up and digging a hand into the pocket of her robe. “Here’s the antidote. I got it from the Aurors first aid supplies.”
“I suppose it was very dark, was it? Like the Manor?” Draco asked.
my father to think we’re fighting.”
“Yes. Get your sketchpad out,” Draco replied, nodding as he reached for the pencil pot that they kept under the counter. “I’ll go and get the stock catalogue so we can see what’s available.”
Harry replied, exhaling loudly. “I don’t understand how they all found out!”
Harry laughed. “I have to hand it to you. I did enjoy this evening more than any of the dates I’ve been on in the last few weeks.”
Harry laughed too. “Good thinking. I’ll see you later. Tell Luna I was asking after her.”
“Well, if it’s company you want, I could always come with you,” Pansy said, raising one eyebrow. “But you’ve never asked me.”
“Not really,” Harry replied with a sigh. “But I will. I just don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“I doubt it,” Draco said, shaking his head. He picked the bucket up and carried it into the back room to pour the water out. “She might own this place, but she knows that
They lay quietly for a few moments, just enjoying each other’s company.
“Good. I’ll help you water the plants when we’re done. We deserve a bit of a break,” Draco said, nudging Harry back towards the counter where they could sit down.
“Oh yeah? Do you have a reason for wanting privacy while you’re reading?” Harry asked, raising an eyebrow.
“Of course,” Draco replied, giving Harry an incredulous look. “What do you take me for?”
“We wouldn’t have missed this for the world, Mother,” Draco replied with a smile. “Would we, Harry?”
“Well, you definitely did that,” Harry replied, leaning down to kiss Draco hungrily. He groaned into the kiss, pushing his hips down so that his erection brushed against Draco’s rapidly hardening cock. “I’ve been waiting all night for this, you bastard.”
“I would like to hold you to that,” Harry said, popping the last bit of the treacle tart into his mouth. “And if they do it warm, that would be even better.”
“Keep going down here, there’s bound to be one free,” Draco replied, gesturing towards the end of the main aisle between the stacks.
“Oh. No, that didn’t occur to me,” Draco said, shrugging. “I have brought literally everything I own with me.”
“I know you do, because you always tell me,” Draco replied, giving Harry a sly look. “Not that I think you’re repetitive.”
“As a matter of fact, I have,” Draco replied, mentally breathing a sigh of relief. It always made him a little bit uncomfortable when Pansy started talking about her sex life. “She came to see Harry in the shop the other day. How long do you think it’s been going on for?”
“I’m just wondering if you’re ever going to stop talking and kiss me,” Draco replied, his eyes widening slightly as the words left his mouth.
,” Pansy said.
“No,” Harry sighed. “It was a
“Excellent plan. It might be nice to walk home in the cold night air,” Draco replied. “Now that the snow is gone.”
“Hopefully that’s not easier said than done,” Harry said, putting his quill down. “What time is it?”
By the time Saturday came around, Harry was exhausted. “I swear, I think I might sleep all day tomorrow.”
“Is this treacle tart?” Harry asked, his eyes wide as he looked from the plate to Draco.
“Of course,” Harry nodded. “That’s a good idea. Should we, er, run this by your mum?”
“Of course. We were out tonight and we were talking and, well, I told him the truth,” Harry said. “He didn’t take it well.”
Draco nodded, pushing his sleeves up and taking a crate from the driver. He carried it across the room and put it onto the table that lined the wall where they would be able to check all of the bunches once they were done.
“Partly that, and partly because men will sell better than cakes,” Draco said, smirking.
Harry chuckled. “Yeah, of course I will. Although don’t hold your breath for anything happening soon.” He stood up to shake Charlie’s hand.
“Through work,” Charlie said, smiling at Arlo. “Arlo came to the reserve to drop off a couple of dragons for us, and then never left.”
with it,” Ron said, shaking his head. “I just didn’t expect it to be someone who sounds so… normal.”
“I can’t believe you remembered. I don’t even remember saying it!” Harry exclaimed, picking up the fork to take a bite.
“Tell me about it,” Draco replied, shaking his head. “Non-stop weddings. I would say I’m glad it’s the weekend, but of course, we’re open tomorrow. Hoping for a quieter day.”
“Harry! It’s about time you brought your… oh. Hello, Draco,” Molly said, stopping short as she realised who was standing at the door. “I thought you were bringing Adam, Harry?”
“I do, it’s really good,” Harry replied, nodding. “It’s better than anything I can make, I think.”
Charlie raised an eyebrow, but didn’t say anything which Harry took as a sign to continue.
everyone to think, but if you’d really hated him, you would have done a lot worse to him than you did,” Pansy said, waving her hand. “It was always interesting, watching the two of you.”
Harry grinned and they stood up, making their way back to their starting point.
“A new assistant at Hermione’s office, apparently,” Harry sighed. “She thinks I’ll get on well with them. But, honestly, I just can’t bring myself to trust her judgement anymore.”
“Why are they so desperate to arrange dates for you?” Draco asked, frowning.
The more he thought about it, the more he realised that he wanted to visit Bookworms and Brews again with Draco, and that could surely only happen on one of their fake dates. And so, it was with that thought in mind that Harry washed up his plate and headed upstairs to take a bath. He knew what he was going to do from here.
Ron’s eyes widened and he gave a low whistle. “Wow. Sorry I asked. Who needs that many roses?”
Harry flushed, feeling anger rising in him as the urge to respond to the barb appeared. Before he could speak, he felt a light tap on his shin and when he looked up, Draco was giving him a warning look. Making a face, he clamped his mouth shut.
“But you don’t want to choose. You said so yourself,” Draco pointed out. “Maybe you’re just not ready to be thinking about settling down?”
“Yes. Very slowly,” Harry said firmly. “I’m not interested in rushing into anything. But I am enjoying getting to know him.”
“I don’t mind at all,” Draco replied with a shrug. “I’m surprised we’ve never had this conversation before to be honest. I knew at school. Never acted on it, but I knew.”
“We’ll need that again later.”
“Thanks, Charlie,” Harry replied. “How’s Arlo?”
Draco nodded. “Exactly that. Because if we don’t have it now, I’m afraid we might never have it.”
“You do them alright,” Draco replied with a shake of his head. “Have
“Goodness me, you’re keen to read more of that book, aren’t you?” Draco asked, blinking in surprise as he found himself propelled towards the café.
Fifteen minutes later, Harry was on Draco’s doorstep, knocking lightly on the door.
Draco smiled and Harry leaned across to give him a kiss.
Harry smiled. “Thanks. It’s given me a bit of trouble, this one.”
Harry made a face. “You’re not a dog. Would he really have put it like that?”
“If you wouldn’t mind. I’ve got another one of these to do before I’m finished with this order,” Draco said, making a face.
“The birthday, I think,” Harry said. “I never get the baby ones right.”
“Oh yeah,” Ron nodded, laughing as he put another fork full of food into his mouth.
“Good. Where should we start?” Draco asked, looking around.
Not one to be outdone, Harry took his hand and brought it to his mouth. “I will,” He murmured, and lips moving against Draco’s pale knuckles, formed the words,
A pink-haired boy stands on the cold beach, watching the slate-colored waves melt against the shore.
“You always know how to make me feel better.”
“This isn’t something we should interrupt,” Draco said suddenly, stopping without warning and yanking at Harry’s robes to hold him back.
Though her friends probably could have stayed for a few more minutes to admire the poster’s finer details, the eagerness for the match spurred them towards the pitch. The five teens found a decent spot in the top half of the bleachers, high enough to see everything, but below the point where the autumn wind began to pick up.
Harry pressed the heel of his palm to his aching head. “What…happened?”
Joey had just unwrapped her plastic fork when a scuffle broke out not far down the street. Two people tumbled out onto the sidewalk, apparently thrown from the doorway of their home, and their attackers soon came into view. Robes, the color of fading night, were pulled up to the wizards’ faces, so only their bright and dangerous eyes were visible. One of them pulled up their sleeves, baring dark arms and a thin, ash-colored wand. The people on the ground, adults dressed in Muggle clothes, cowered.
“If we touch his stuff and put it back, he won’t mind,” Pansy decides, and promptly turns herself to land on the wooden floor. Her boots clomp as she strides to the shelf and begins flipping through the music. “Old, old, boring, old – ew, pop – derivative, boring, old…aha!” Pansy exclaims triumphantly, sliding out a white vinyl sleeve, stenciled with a horse. “That’s the ticket. Perhaps Harry’s music taste isn’t as godawful as I thought.”
“I’ve never seen hail in this part of the country before,” Hermione said worriedly as she and her friends made their way to the Defense Against the Dark Arts classroom. “What if it hails again during your match, Harry?”
, he realized and gulped down lemonade to calm himself. It wasn’t death he was afraid of; he’d already experienced it. Harry glanced across the kitchen counter at Draco, who stared off towards the garden, silver eyes lost in a daydream. No, death didn’t scare him. He was afraid of what would happen to the people he left behind.
up and all that. He seems to be heading west, so we’re taking our chances.”
It was a total guess, but to his surprise, Sprout smiled and nodded. “Ten points to Gryffindor.” Harry mouthed a silent
“It’d take too long to come up with a plan, anyway,” Harry remarked. “How about we take turns, spell per spell, and see what happens?”
Snape doesn’t answer. Nearby, Narcissa sobs silently into a handkerchief. It’s Bellatrix who answers, her high voice mocking, “Because your daddy can’t do his job properly!”
A beat of thoughtful silence. Hermione bit her lip, thinking, then tentatively raised her hand.
This was one of my favorite chapters to write and edit. I love writing scenes with Dahlia's class, and scenes that showcase Draco's potions abilities. The books didn't really talk about it much, but I believe he's got a real talent for it.
Harry thought as he settled into his seat, glancing at Hermione from across the room.
“What?” Harry peers around the kitchen opening to see a cassette tape by the door. It sits atop a thin, clipped-shut manila folder. He figures it must have gone through the mail slot and was unknowingly pushed aside when they came in. “No, I haven’t seen before.”
“What about me?”
Draco leaned over the counter to speak to one of the Honeydukes wizards. “Do these melt?” He asked, indicating the figurines.
“For this spell, yes.”
Draco looked down at his forearm, where the black snake’s coils had been marred with red, raised lines, parts of them crusted with dried blood. He’d done it out of pure spite, with the same razor he used to shave. It was mania and anger that poured out of the cuts and dripped onto the tiles that he’d had to clean thoroughly, lest Teddy see. Self-harm, though only half of it was self-hatred. The other half was a lead-heavy fear of the thing on his arm, feeling as if it was beginning to wrap around his soul.
“I’ve heard a lot about Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy at Cambridge,” Joey continued. “Some rumors seem outlandish. Others downright horrifying.” She paused. “I want to know exactly who I’m working with.”
One of my favorite visual chapters thus far, especially with the parallels between winter and spring - the death of a year juxtaposed with a new beginning.
“Erm…hello,” Harry says awkwardly, and Malfoy acknowledges him with a glance. “Need help?”
“Shouldn’t you be? After spending all of seventh year running around the country?”
“What’re you here for, then?” Pansy asks cheekily.
The pullout couch folds into a maroon leather booth. Music, soft and string-driven, plays overhead. Conversation and laughter from faceless couples surround them. Harry looks down, at a plate of half-eaten lasagna, a napkin in his lap and a glass of water in his hand.
Still, he made it to Draco’s tree without being noticed and faced the trunk, keeping himself hidden. “Draco?” Harry muttered, just above his breath. Hardly a moment had passed, and he was already considering raising his voice, but then…
“Same goes for you, Ron,” Harry said, clapping his friend’s shoulder, “You’re a lucky bloke.”
“Fuck,” Harry muttered under his breath, then pressed, “And this woman? What did she look like?”
“Because you’re our
The pair’s noses were nearly touching, and Harry was finding it difficult to think. He silently sifted through the information Malfoy had just given him, scrabbling for a label.
Ron nodded. “I do.”
Draco's gray eyes gazed softly into Harry's own, and the Chosen One realized he didn't mind the affection as much as he thought he would. The blond's face was close, almost
Draco nodded slowly. Luna smiled encouragingly. “I’m sorry,” He whispered. “I’m not ready, I can’t do it yet. I’m not brave like you.”
“Are you coming with me or not?” He asked.
“Well. I suppose that's useful. You’d empty yourself for me.” Dao’s eyes gleamed wickedly as if imagining harvesting the rest of Dahlia, but either Dahlia missed it or didn’t care. “I thank you. But you should know, I’ve found another right hand.”
Harry found Draco, bundled in his black overcoat, standing beneath his lemon tree. His cheeks and nose were already rosy with cold. He didn’t smile as Harry drew near, only watched with the impassiveness that Harry still hadn’t learned to read. Harry didn’t take Draco’s blank expression as anger or disappointment – he chose to show his moods whenever it suited him.
The void swirls with snowflakes. Harry cradles Draco close as they fall, wind whistling against their ears. Draco has stopped screaming, but he breathes rapidly, wide-eyed. The descent shows no sign of ending.
“No, I’m sorry, I wasn’t looking where I was going,” said Draco. “Are you all right?”
The third years looked queasy at this prospect, but they put on their brave faces and nodded.
“Yes,” Draco said, “It felt…strangling-ish.”
“Ties?” Draco cut in, and a couple of the students jumped, forgetting that the Slytherin had been there all along. “How does one tie in this…game?” Harry shot him a sideways glance, recognizing the strangled politeness in his voice. As much as he loved Draco, he knew he had a mean streak a kilometer wide. Sitting with five strangers, two of whom were children, wasn’t helping Draco keep his knee-jerk contempt in check.
Harry squinted through the glass at two fuzzy shapes he assumed to be McGonagall and Draco, but the fog made it nigh impossible to discern their hands, let alone their mouths. A breeze began to push through the mist - Harry could see it moving - but there was simply too much of it. He was deciding whether to leave under the guise of going to the loo when Professor Sprout called his name.
“Muggle fighting is so barbaric,” Draco said with a sniff - Harry was elated to see that his disdain was intact, if not his energy. “Can’t imagine why - mmph!”
As the three wizards vanished, Draco yanked off the Invisibility Cloak. Harry didn’t look at him for a moment, slowly sliding his wand back into his jeans and processing all that had happened.
“Mercy,” Dahlia pleaded.
Before long, rice bowls, topped with meat in Joey’s and Harry’s case, were handed out to the young Aurors. Charon declined nourishment, taking a swig from a flask within his dark robes, leaving behind the faint scent of amaretto.
“They’re going to get in trouble again,” Hermione says warningly, but she holds out her hand, and Harry obligingly pours her some of the rainbow-sprinkled chocolate discs.
•  •  •
“Well…” Draco looked around the room, his gaze falling on a rectangle of wallpaper that seemed darker than the rest of it. “There’s supposed to be a painting there. It’s in the attic, probably, with some other things.” His voice grew more confident, and he walked forward, turning thoughtfully. “Some of these things can go back in the attic, though. I think we should just clean the whole place first.”
Draco’s silver eyes shone with pride and excitement. Then, caught up in the euphoria of his success, he suddenly took Harry into his arms. “Thanks a lot for helping,” He said breathlessly.
“Why aren’t we Apparating, Mum?” Ginny asked as Ron stepped over the grate.
September was mostly a blur in Harry’s memory, but he could recall some parts of the first day. McGonagall had said something about… “Interhouse cooperation. Isn’t there…some sort of competition going on? Thanks,” He added as the waitress came back with their drinks.
“Read through those when you get the chance,” Dahlia told him. “Try to pick a department you want to work in before our next career session in four weeks. Your application will go faster if you know exactly what courses you’ll be taking.”
“Yes. I think I am, now.”
Grace had never come easily to Draco. But for Harry, he’d leastwise try.
use that word!” Someone shouted from outside, and Harry jumped awake. He and Draco scrambled to their feet as the door abruptly swung open. “Inside!” Professor Dahlia pointed sharply into the classroom, and ten students silently filed in. They all seemed mortified, in varying degrees. Ron’s lips were pressed into a thin line as he strode towards his friends.
Harry shook his head. “I mean, you’re his sister, and he loves you. As long as Luna makes you happy, it shouldn’t matter to him whether she’s a girl or not.”
Harry lay down on the bleachers, one leg propped up on a bench. His emerald eyes took in the pale void above, his mind drifting through the emptiness and the silence.
“Are you happy, my little dragon?”
“Same.”
“Stay there, Justin,” Padma says sharply over her shoulder, rummaging around in her bag. “Miss Lovegood, watch the monitor, please. If the activity starts to disappear, let me know.”
“Really,
The Slytherin lowered his voice. “I’m ready to address it.”
“Little bit of Dark magic?” Draco asked, unable to keep a jab of venom out of his voice.
Harry glanced at Hermione, then Draco. “We were just…er.” He trailed off.
“Why?”
A bit bemused, Hagrid looked back and forth between them a few times before breaking the silence. “Well…nice to see that yeh get along.”
“Who’s it by?” Harry asks with mild interest; he hasn’t listened to any of his records in a while. He sidles past Draco to the kitchen. “Want anything to drink?”
Weasley. Today was the first of April, George and Fred’s birthday. No wonder Ron seemed upset.
As the night wore on, the younger students began to trudge off to bed, shoes in their hands and smiles on their faces. Harry met up with more of the seventh years - Cassandra asked him to dance, as did Erin, Luna, and Ollie. Ron asked him as well, and they performed a rendition of a slow waltz as the Weird Sisters played a much faster rock song. Harry felt like a real teenager in those moments, joking and chatting with his friends, spinning in wild circles with Luna, joining Ginny’s chain of dancers, watching the others as he sipped punch with Hermione.
Hermione jovially waved her off. “I’m sure he’s looking forward to it!”
“He’s not backing down,” She mutters, and Justin perks up in concern. “Go, keep a close eye on him,” Padma instructs.
“Are you saying you don’t want to hear about it?” Pansy smirks.
Harry saw Draco’s silver eyes widen, and he mimicked him, feigning surprise. Ron’s eyebrows shot up into his red hair. Hermione, a smile growing across her face, was the first to say anything.
and chattering to each other as they headed for their respective offices. Joey spotted a crowd of gray uniforms near the golden fountain in the center and made a beeline for it, careful not to meet any strangers’ eyes.
In which Draco struggles to accept the scars the past has left him. Meanwhile, a pair of friends are united.
A blast of cold air whooshed wonderfully against Harry’s skin, already feverish from the brief moments in the sweltering Pacific sunshine. The three Aurors joined the mercifully short queue at the port’s customs office, waiting behind a few Muggles who presented their passports and spoke stiffly to the balding, stern-looking man behind a glass-bordered desk.
“In other words, yes. I’ll go out with you.”
“It’s only practice,” Dahlia reassured her. “I’m guessing you want to mention your undefeated season?”
“This is how you do it: You sit down at a keyboard and you put one word after another until its done. It’s that easy, and that hard.” - Neil Gaiman
“Confunded, I expect,” Hermione sighed after the trolley witch left.
“Thank you,” Harry replied, and he meant it, though his eyes were scanning the crowd spilling from the stands. Who he was looking for, he couldn’t be sure.
“Take a break,” Harry instructed, brow furrowing in concern. They were by the lake again, shoes sinking into the gravelly sand, the afternoon sky overcast.
He almost lied and said yes. “No. I have no idea if I can make it work. But it can’t hurt to try.”
“That’s all right.”
His heart dropped. The Mark was still there, plain as day, though its color had changed from a deep black to a light crimson.
This morning is part of one of those strange in-between days that come before spring, syrupy sunlight spilling between the low, gray clouds as if willfully ignoring their melancholy. The snow from Valentine’s still lingers in thin drifts on bushes and shaded alleys, runoff flowing in gleaming ribbons next to the sidewalk.
Harry Potter remains still; Padma thinks she must have imagined the furrow in his brow. She taps her foot nervously against the floorboards, clicking and typing away. A tussle at three in the damn morning, she thinks bitterly. Harry certainly isn’t making her job easy and fun.
•    •    •
“Wonder what’s up her arse,” Ron muttered, prompting a muted slap on the arm from his girlfriend.
“Stop.”
“Why?”
in peace.”
“Pretty night, pretty night,” Carraway murmured, looking up at the sliver of moon. “Not much visibility, hm. Better for him, or for us?” He turned away from the view, trundling in the direction of the town’s center.
“That’s kind of scary that you remember that, Malfoy…”
“The moment he recognized me,” Narcissa stated, without a hint of bitterness. “It was somewhat of an accident. But he was chained, so I wouldn’t get hurt.”
“I never know what to do with my arms,” he replied with an elegant shrug. “You go on if you want.”
“I will not hide the things I’ve done,” Joey said. “And neither will Draco. He
“Don’t get cocky,” Draco replied, raising his hand for Professor Slughorn’s attention. The potioneer lumbered over, plaid stretching over his stomach, thoughtfully brushing his walrus-like mustache.
“Oh, yeah, haven’t I mentioned? Dad told me, but he doesn’t know all of them or the details of what they do. I expect we can ask. Hermione, are you going to be an Auror, too?”
A warm brown gaze looks up, unsure, untrusting. The bedsprings whine, yet its occupants are near silent. Harry fucks her without feeling, without seeing. He tells himself he loves her.
The air crackled with energy and ozone, the walls trembling. Draco felt out of control, a magic that was not his own taking over. A bolt of lightning, fizzing with bright, pale violet, streaked down towards Harry, his green eyes widening. Draco couldn’t stop it, couldn’t do anything but watch helplessly.
“Luna came over. She’s still here.”
“We had, but we’ve heard a few interesting things about you lately and wanted to confirm,” Pansy said with a nasty smile. “Is it true your parents are going to Azkaban?”
Joey joined her colleagues a few minutes later, looking frazzled, bag slung over her shoulder. “Sorry, I was having trouble concealing the…” She hesitated, glancing over the railing for listeners.
“So, what did they want you for?”
“I guess… I’ll have a cappuccino. Thanks.”
“Too early for that,” he said amiably and took Harry’s arm. “Let’s go, then. I’ll teach you how to dance properly.”
“I should hope not. In addition,” Lucius indicates a much shorter list separate from the entries, “The names of those in which you may place your trust. Old families, respectable ones. I do not care if you garner a following; in fact, I encourage it. But you keep your true intentions within an inner circle. Do you understand?”
“Mine,” Ron replied.
“Excellent. Now spit in it.”
“That’s beautiful magic,” Hermione commended. “You two worked on this today?”
okay?”
He felt a warm breath against his ear. "Don't scream, Potter."
Harry couldn’t see Joey’s face, but he could tell by her hands, clasped tightly behind her back, that she was uncomfortable. “It’s on my passport, sir. I was born in Ilorin, Nigeria.”
” He pleaded, “
“Stop messing around!” Joey snapped, retaliating with a spell that should have cleaved Rabbit’s mask in two, but they calmly lifting their hands, protecting themself with an invisible shield. Before Joey could try again, Rabbit conjured three stone orbs, and they whistled like cannonballs as they shot towards her.
Exhaustion dragged at her eyes, and subsiding nausea still roiled in her stomach, but Joey turned in her seat to glare at him. “I’m leading. I say we start right away.”
“I believe you.”
“If it isn’t Molly Weasley!” A jovial voice came from above, and Lee Jordan fell out of nowhere in front of the students, making them jump back. He was dressed in the standard WWW uniform, complete with an orange-banded top hat that partially covered his neat dreadlocks. “Nice to see you all, Ginny, Ron, Harry, Hermione…” Lee paused for a split second, recognizing the pale, pointed face of a Malfoy, but his retail employee instincts took over, and he continued smoothly, “And Draco Malfoy as well, what a surprise. Looking for George, then?”
“Where’re you off to, Potter?” He asked, without lifting his head, as Harry passed by.
A thoughtful pause. “Come on, ‘Mione, we were just getting into our stride.” Harry grinned. Beneath the table, his hand curled affectionately over Draco’s knee. A moment later, Draco’s fingers closed over his. “One time, we traded insults for an hour.”
Harry knew Draco almost as well as he knew himself, knew what made him smile, knew how his face lit up at home or in the potions classroom, stirring up some bizarre concoction for someone else to take to the battlefield. Harry knew, too, what made him cry - the Dark Mark, the nightmares of running down a long Hogwarts corridor that slowly filled with dust and bodies. The adrenaline and danger of being an Auror reminded Harry of the war, but it gave him purpose, a reason to keep fighting for those who stood beside him and those who’d already fallen. But the feeling of chasing and being chased did Draco no favors. It only put him back in that corridor, sprinting for his life with no light, no way out. Harry should have realized that sooner.
Draco chuckled. “It was a tad overdramatic. But you meant well. I think next time,” He added, “I can stand up for myself.”
A particularly loud clap of thunder snapped Harry from sleep, and he woke with his heart pounding. On the other side of the room, Ron stirred, rolling over. Harry took a deep breath and reached for his glasses. The storm truly raged now, and another rumble of thunder made Harry realize how dry his mouth was. Rubbing the fatigue from his eyes, he walked all the way to the first floor for a drink.
Offhandedly, Draco wonders if he will return alive to hear that sound again.
“Both of you, calm down,” Hermione cut in. “Don’t have a row this late.”
“The Hogsmeade trip on Friday has been postponed,” Hermione sighed after a glance at the Slytherin house bulletin. “I guess we’ll have to wait a bit before we can go out to The Three Broomsticks, Ron.”
“Mrs. Weasley, you didn’t have to get us anything,” Hermione said, “That’s too kind of you, really, we’re too old for this.”
Draco thought wrong.
“This way.” Ray jerked his head towards a clearing through the trees, a narrow passage overgrown with roots and fallen leaves. The tension hadn’t left his shoulders, and though Draco could relate, anxious to get home, he wondered at Ray’s demeanor. Surely, he wasn’t expecting trouble here, wherever here was. “There are many Muggles in this area. Safer to travel on foot.”
“Come on, up you get,” Ginny said, shaking him awake, then gently did the same to Hermione. “You’ve got seven flights of stairs to climb.”
She was sitting at her desk, writing a letter to Latifah, when the sound of fluffing feathers at the window caught her attention. Joey turned, expecting the gray plumage of Harry’s and Draco’s owl, but this bird was only vaguely familiar. Its lamplike yellow eyes observed Joey as she plucked an envelope from its beak, and the owl didn’t fly away until she’d opened it.
Dr. Patil finally seems to notice him, and she looks about the room. “Yes, this looks about right. We’re in your most recent memories, I’d say.”
This is impossible.
Harry scanned their surroundings, finding the Ravenclaws at a booth near a window. They appeared to have just ordered butterbeer, white foam threatening to spill over the golden-hued sides.
The vinyl crackles for what feels to be the last time. Harry sits on the edge of his bed, tears streaming down his face. The soft piano, Billie Holiday’s gentle vocals, evokes memories of countless candlelit evenings, Draco’s arms around his neck, head resting on his shoulder.
“No harm…!” Harry took furious steps towards her. His hands were clenched so hard that his nails dug painfully into his palms. Gun or no, he was about ready to sock her in the face. “He could have died!”
Smoke and a wave of heat billowed through the trees, yet to Harry, it seemed to fade just as quickly. He saw Rabbit and Dao crumble to their knees, masks looking about wildly.
Harry had gone immediately to Dahlia’s side. She lay gasping in the mud, eyes fluttering in the rain. The skin on her throat had blackened, and not just from the burn. As Draco watched, darkness began to ooze into her veins, crawling up her neck.
“Fireless supremacists.”
Draco leaned in and waited until the couple was out of earshot. “Are you going to tell them?” He asked, lowering his voice.
Draco sighed, tamping down his frustration. Harry squeezed his hand reassuringly. “That was just one try. You can do this.”
“She’s okay. I just like having time alone with you.” Luna smiles, looking up adoringly at him. He wishes she’d sit up and kiss him, but she doesn’t. So, he leans over and kisses her instead.
Harry took a deep breath, hoping to high heaven that Draco was ready to retaliate if the witch did not like his answer. “No,” He said firmly. “I won’t go with people I don’t know. Especially if they attack the school I care about. A school that I still go to, by the way,” He added.
"Your Royal Highness," he responded, "may your hand never falter. I shall get the bank president for you."
the memories began to play notes were being made by the govenors which would be later turned into meetings many looking displeased with Umbridge's hands off approach to ling. Then to everyones horror scenes from her detentions began to play. scene after scene students being tortured by a bloodquill most prominatly Harry.
As he started to ask more questions they all heard a ruckus and some arguing.
IM NOT  GOING TO DO HARRY OR DRACO AS YOU WILL SEE THEIR  STUFF LATER
Alice getting ideas was also starting to make clothes so they wouldn't go back all the time. The freedom of being in the magical world got her creative juices flowing.
"Thanks I think" he said "sorry im still a little fuzzy."
As they climbed up the steps Bella turned to the Cullens, "So, I'm going to be straight. Goblins are weird looking. Don't stare, point, etc they take a huge offense." They all nodded and went inside.
“Forgive me madam but I am not familiar with you position nor you” Lord Burke stated
Together they all walked to the great hall,
"That's not," she paused to take a hurt breath to calm herself, "Thats not how this works. You know NOTHING about me. LITERALLY NOTHING. You haven't bothered to ask. I could tell you all at the least the basic facts about each of you but have you even asked me once who my parents are? No you haven't. Im supposed to mated or dating your son whatever you wanna FUCKING call it and you won't even.... talk to me about my family or anything else." Bella rants getting more upset.
“You’ll have to forgive the paintings,” Bella said, “the watercolors remind me of Avalon”
Harry who was extremely pale at that point nodded and quickly hurried after him. When they got to the house he locked his items in the cupboard and ran upstairs already knowing what was awaiting him. Vernon followed after him belt already in hand when suddenly he stopped his eyes lit up green and he turned around.
these are just pictures of all the outfits everyone got on the shopping trip. labled with who the outfit is for
"How long was i out," Harry asked looking at Lucius who was smirking
"Thats perfectly understandable madam minister" Harry told her
They made it in a good thirty minutes before the doors closed enough time for Lady Longbottom to find them and begin a conversation.
"madame Umbridge you are hereby charged of the aforementioned charges of Child abuse, Misuse of a magical object, Child endangerment, and Attempted Murder." Kingsley Shacklebolt called "You will now be judged before this commitiee. Abstaining votes from Chief Wugmump Dumbledore and Lord Potter Peverell Gryffindor"
“There was no trial” Sirius replied to the outrage of the Wizemgont
“You’re so optimistic.” Draco’s silver eyes were misty. “How can you be so optimistic?”
Luna plucked at the grass. “I really am sorry, Harry,” She said again. “I didn’t know you and Draco wanted to keep it a secret.”
Draco squeezed his hand reassuringly.
A twig snapped.
“I always do,” Harry said, and he and Draco exchanged a glance too subtle for Joey to interpret.
Draco huffed but allowed Harry to drape the garment over them both. “You’re utterly insufferable, you know that?”
“All right. See you.”
Separating Draco from his father was a gulf, salty, stinging drops hitting his face like a last, posthumous slap. And despite standing next to Draco, Harry felt as if he knew that gulf, too, standing on the shore as he watched his beloved flail and gasp just above the waves.
noise. “No. My magic is good enough.” Something warm settled on Harry’s shoulder, and he resisted the urge to turn. “Nervous?”
“Thank you, Mummy. Thank you,
But instead of turning to Draco and asking, Harry let his questions and worries float away with the giant squid.
He stands next to the round table in Dr. Padma Patil’s office. She looks up at him, apologetic.
“Not particularly. But he seems to have a problem with me.”
“With all due respect, Minister,” Hermione chimed in, “Are you sure you want to be telling us? Surely this is sensitive information.”
Henrietta nodded, twisting her hair nervously. After almost a full minute of concentration, she cried out, “
They recognized both masks from nearly four years ago. A fearsome boar, with carved tusks, stood slightly taller and more broad-shouldered than his companion. The other wizard’s mask was carved into a serene rabbit, its eyes glittering as black as midnight.
“Stop it!” Hermione reprimanded him, laying a firm hand on his arm as Harry balled his fists. “Harry…we saw what happened at dinner.”
Ron bent to unlace his trainers. Harry, already barefoot, silently rehearsed the speech he and Draco had come up with as he waited. He felt as if he was coming out again, with more at stake and a higher chance of rejection.
“We’ll do our best,” Harry promised.
Ginny saw him first, her eyes widening. She quickly pulled away from Luna. “Harry!” She said, guilt and surprise evident in her expression. “Were you spying?”
“Let’s go, Hermione,” Ron said quietly, taking his girlfriend’s hand. Hermione nodded, wiping her face, and she didn’t even bother to tug back the blanket before standing up. Ron Summoned his shoes, caught them in one hand, and didn’t look back at his best friend. The couple disappeared into the copse of trees, heading for the castle.
Draco pointed out, “I’ve taken the Tube a few times.”
“No worries, I know it’s always something with you Aurors,” Hermione replied with a good-natured smirk. “Ron often comes home with strange injuries. Oh, but it’s been too long! How’d your exams go?”
Draco nodded. Beneath his hand, Harry felt his muscles lose some of their tension. “
Ron cleared his throat, and his smile faded. He turned to his best friend, tugging at his own sleeves nervously. “Hey, um…I want to tell you something.”
“I like you, okay?” Harry stated bluntly. “I don’t know how it happened, or why, but somehow I have feelings for you,
“Also, if he’s that willing to cut you out, he’s probably not worth it in the first place,” Ron chimes in, towel in hand.
Luckily, Harry was able to locate the trolley witch and buy a Chocolate Frog before heading back to his compartment.
Luna and Ginny held up their poster and cheered loudly for Ravenclaw as Madam Hooch blew her whistle, and the players flew into action. The green- and blue-decorated spectators whooped and hollered as the game began, but Draco did not join in. Instead, he simply watched the pitch intently, eyes scouring the space. Harry recognized his movements immediately; the Slytherin was searching for the Snitch.
“I’m looking forward to demolishing the other houses in Quidditch and winning the Cup,” Ginny proclaimed.
“Did something trigger you?” The blond said quietly, and Harry glanced at him, surprised that he knew what he was experiencing.
“Well, he’s here, isn’t he?” Molly said. “Go on, open it.”
“Oh - I don’t dance.”
Seeing the distressed look on Harry’s face, Hermione began to hurry them along beside the train. “Er…we really should be going, or all the good seats will be taken.”
“You’re stronger than I am.”
“You’re taking this rather well.”
“Why didn’t you tell us right away?” Ron asked Harry, a bit hurt.
Harry laid a hand on his arm and exchanged a look with Hermione, who said, “Why don’t we go in?”
For years, Harry had held onto a dream, one that had faded nearly to tatters. In the English countryside, a cottage was filled with children tumbling through the garden, getting their new wands, and playing Quidditch in the backyard. Children that would have a childhood far better than his ever was. He would make sure of it.
Joey watched Harry stand back to let Draco go into the booth first and receive a smile in return. She figured that maybe returning to normalcy right away wasn’t pretending - just another way of healing.
Professor Dahlia’s reaction seemed to match; she slid it out of the pile, hands trembling, apprehension in her eyes. But instead of opening it, she placed it resolutely out of sight, in a drawer somewhere. Not a Howler, then, or else her desk would catch on fire.

“I never saw you buy that,” Harry said quietly to him, quite astonished.
“Thank you,” said Harry and Draco simultaneously, and Antigone smiled indulgently.
“I didn’t mean to keep you,” Draco said, almost apologetically as he stood quickly from the bed. In characteristic gestures, he began to smooth out his sweater and comb his hair back into place with his fingers, as if to erase the prior vulnerability from his figure.
“What?” Draco asked brashly, gripping his wand in his pocket.
“You’re giving twenty years of your life to repay your and your family’s crimes, Draco. That doesn’t seem like enough atonement to you?”
Six ruby-red silhouettes, joined by their Patronuses, circled Harry. Dao uttered a command, and slowly they began to back away, letting in another dementor.
Are you happy, my little dragon?
Suddenly, Potter swerves, diving after the discolored tiara he was so fixated on, and Draco’s grip tightens even more as he shrieks, “
“Anytime.” The Slytherin melted away into the shadows, footsteps echoing on the way back to the dormitory.
to be a good person. But… “That doesn’t change the fact I killed someone.”
“She never told me.” Ron looked utterly betrayed. “Why’d she tell you and not me?” He shook his head, looking at the ground before meeting his best friend’s gaze. Harry saw that Ron’s blue eyes had filled with tears. “It’s like…I don’t even know you anymore.”
A bit of a shorter chapter than usual...It does include transition scenes, after all. I find that scenes, where the characters move from one place to another, tend to be short and fast-paced. That is the nature of travel, after all.
of murder, Potter. You won’t believe me when I say it, but I’m a bad person.” Draco yanked his hands out of Harry’s grasp and struggled to his feet. “I shouldn’t even be here with you. I keep telling myself I want this, that I want you, and I do, but it’s selfish. Someone like me shouldn’t be with you.”
Out of the corner of his eye, Harry saw Draco reach into his pocket, then make a face. No wands; he must have forgotten.
“Merlin’s beard, I’m starving,” Draco sighed a few hours later, flinging himself upon a freshly cleaned, black leather sofa. “And thirsty.”
Sleeping Beauty. Rose-cheeked princess snoring softly on pillows stuffed with down. Harry can’t quite match the image to anyone he knows, but it reminds him of someone he loves, falling just out of his grasp.
“What do you want?” Harry murmured as he added a third finger, and Draco hissed in pleasure. “What do you want, Draco?” Pumping in and out, slowly, stretching him out, but Draco wanted…
“You can move,” Hermione offered, glancing appreciatively at him. “I’m not stopping you.”
Too late, Draco whirls around, to the bathroom, and Harry can hear clattering as he gathers his things. “Draco!” He rushes in, but the bathroom is completely empty. More movement and rustling from the kitchen - Draco’s there, instead, and Harry finds him, two jackets over his arm, a key in his hand.
Draco smirked and opened his mouth to reply, but a particularly loud scream from the common room made them both flinch. “I appreciate the sentiment, Potter, but you should hurry. It’s quite hazardous out there.” He placed a pale hand carefully on the doorknob, listening for any explosions on the other side.
, Harry. You have to.”
No one said anything. They knew all this already.
The woman hasn’t prayed in years, but she kneels, straight to the cool, damp stone, hand still clutching her partner’s. “Please…” She begs, head bowed, speaking to someone, anyone, that might be listening. And even if her pleas fall on deaf ears, at least she was doing something. At least she could make herself feel better. “
“We can wait for Dahlia,” Harry murmured sleepily, his head drooping onto Draco’s shoulder.
Joey looked back and forth between them as they sat, her expression a mixture of confusion and appraisal. “So…how long have you two been together?” She asked, her stiff demeanor temporarily disrupted by their blatant display of affection.
“That’s my girlfriend you’re talking about.” It’s the closest Justin has gotten to being angry tonight so far, but he rarely gets angry. His hazel glare above the monitor isn’t very threatening.
“I’m not pure of heart,” Harry mutters, but Draco doesn’t reply. He’s listening with his eyes closed.
“Let’s not test that theory,” Harry said hastily, holding his hands up for peace as Draco opened his mouth to retort. “So…
“Joey is…” Harry exchanged a look with Draco, unsure how to proceed.
The ship, sleek, white, and relatively small, looked speedy, but it would take its time weaving through the Pacific, giving its Muggle passengers all the time on the wide-open sea they needed. Draco dropped their bags, along with the extra supplies Henderson had lent them, in his and Harry’s tiny room. He then climbed to the top deck, wringing his hands nervously over the railing and watching for the vessel’s departure.
“Inside me…” Joey’s features twisted in disgust as she looked down at herself, and Draco felt a twinge of sympathy. He knew what it was like to have something alien lurking just beneath the skin, with no way to remove it.
“Can’t risk jostling that arm too much,” Madam Pomfrey, “Besides,” She added with a knowing smile, “You seemed so eager to help.”
Hermione looked between them but didn’t comment.
“Anyway,” Draco continued uncomfortably, “I sort of lashed out at him. And the…” He trailed off, suddenly seized with the helplessness of it all. How could he have lost control so easily? Harry was supposed to be the hot-headed one, yet here Draco sat, the Dark Mark hidden beneath his opaque white sleeve and beneath a glamour the night before.
The similarity jarred his focus, and Harry managed to hit him. Draco’s legs quavered like jelly, and he collapsed to his knees.
•    •    •
"No, I didn’t want to stay too long. Hermione and Ron wanted to do a study group with a few others later.” Potter leaned forward in his chair and met Draco’s gaze, making his heart skip a beat. Draco hated to admit it even to himself, but there was something equally gorgeous and irritating about the brunet’s emerald-bright eyes peering through his signature round glasses. “How are you feeling?”
“Nice one, Parvati…” Professor Dahlia said as she looked about the room, “Seamus, keep your wand more horizontal…Hermione, that’s great work, see if you can do it wordlessly now…”
Harry squeezed his shoulder in an affectionate reprimand. “I don’t care if I sound like I’m talking in Mermish. As long as you’re taking care of yourself.”
“There’s another quote I like,” Luna continues, restlessly kicking her foot. She’s wearing woolen socks, one orange, the other yellow. “More of a poem, actually. I’ve been thinking about it a lot, watching Harry fight back.”
The effect was immediate. Joey gasped, dropping the empty cup, and she stared at the ceiling, eyes rapidly becoming so bloodshot that the whites turned crimson. Veins along her arms and neck bulged as if about to burst.
But the first thing she noticed was the smell - dirt and rock, the natural scent of the underground, a hint of garlic, cooking meat, animal dung, and - was that…? Surely not…
But perhaps that was the first time he met Isabelle. Draco, he ran into on the beach, all pale lashes and blustery limbs, hair the color of squeezed limes. He was hardly recognizable.
“Good thing we’ve got Dahlia,” Harry remarked, “Since she used to be an Auror.”
“Mother, he’s going to remember I’m gay,” Draco said, his voice shaking.
“So don’t,” Harry replied, panting slightly. He sat cross-legged on the snow next to Draco, taking a minute to catch his breath before continuing. “Think about it, Malfoy. If the Death Eaters let you go, they probably don’t need you anymore. I doubt they’d suddenly decide to kidnap you in the middle of the holidays. Besides,” He moved slightly forward, “If they did, you know we’d all protect you.”
“Oh, don’t sound so worried,” Lucius says flippantly, “What other personal secrets could you possibly have? We already know that you’re a filthy faggot.”
The last part is garbled, and Harry slams his fist on the table in frustration. Something bigger is going on, out of reach, and Harry feels like it has something to do with him and Draco.
Pansy glances at her backpack, slumped on the floor in front of her. It carries only a fraction of the items she’d stolen, snagged from the Lockhart backroom. There were two black garbage bags full, neatly labeled with two names, one over the other: Harry Potter, Draco Malfoy.
Though she’s included in that statement, Narcissa keeps her head bowed and her mouth shut. Demure and submissive. The only kind of woman Lucius can respect.
“Malfoy….” Potter began, clasping his hands, “Do you want to talk? Things have been kind of weird with us lately. Weird and unfriendly. I get if you don’t want to tell me
“Excuse me,” Draco interrupted, grey eyes narrowing in confusion, “Did you say you’re not surprised?”
No trace of surprise showed on Harry’s face at the words.
“No,” She admitted point-blank. “Well, it might be. Who knows what the younger boys get up to? Anyway, they’ll be gone long enough for us to talk.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Since we were a part of a pureblood supremacy organization bent on murdering half the human population.”
Harry glances between them in confusion. “Wouldn’t what?”
“I’m surprised, I thought we’d be getting more attention,” Draco remarked as his hands wrapped around the warm mug in front of him.
“I see.” Draco tapped the table thoughtfully. “So, it went well, then?”
“Listen, Harry, I can help,” Joey assured him. “I talked to the Head Auror. I think I might have gotten through to her. Draco needs a trial. He’s never had one. I don’t think he really….” She made a slicing motion across her throat. “That girl. I’m sure you don’t, either.”

Severus and Lucius had been going out since Draco's third year, after Dumbledore had killed Narcissa in a failed raid during second year Lucius needed the time to mourn. While there was no romantic love between them they took the arranged marriage in stride and were friends. Severus and Lucius had been dating during their time at Hogwarts and had rekindled that love at the end of his son's third year. It was partly Lucius and Draco who had convinced Severus to listen to Sirius explain his side of the story and helped him escape when they found out the truth. However, Harry's bad luck had come when they realized that Dumbledore would not allow for Harry to live with his godfather and had been forced to return to the Dursleys.
 Bulstrode (D)
Harry was devastated as well as Draco whom he had been secretly seeing with the help of Ron and Hermione since their second year. Draco had been one of the few people to believe that he was not the one endangering the school and since then they had begun a fast spiral from friends to boyfriends. Harry was surprised when Ron and Hermione had agreed to help him, but they told him that they had some atonement to do for second year as well as they saw that even though they were young Harry and Draco clearly loved each other. That summer and all the summers after per Severus' and Remus' instruction Harry kept a diary as well as a memory case filled with all of the abuse the Dursleys had done to him. If they had enough evidence then the ministry would have no choice but to put harry into someone else's care, those someones being the people currently in Severus' room discussing the future.
"Very well Deloris Umbridge you will now be fixed with antimagic bracelets and sent to the fourth level of Azkaban for the rest of your days" Madame Bones said and she raised her wand to summon the Aurors.
suddenly Umbridge turned to Harry and turned an ugly shade of red
They all rush in, Jasper hedges around the room obviously cautious about getting near bella and risk her getting hurt.
"Madam Umbridge if you will please pass over the locket to Chief Wugmump Dumbledore so it may be returned to Hogwarts' Slytherin House" Bella said "Chief Dumbledore after this session if you may hand it to me to make sure she did not foul this artifact with anything and then it may be displayed in its rightful home"

Across the hallway was a magnificent library, stacked high with impressive volumes on almost any subject imaginable. Magic, nature, music, medicine, history, politics, and even cheap romance novels lined the shelves, all ordered according to their themes. The room was colored emerald-green, giving a calming sensation to readers who entered to peruse the shelves. Then the scents of tea, petrichor, and roses leaked around the room, making a person not want to leave. If they did wish to leave, next door was another beautiful oasis. The large nursery nurtured a variety of beautiful plants native to both the Fae and human worlds. Bella loved to relax and read while surrounded by all sorts of nature, and the petrichor scent that spread around this room as well seemed to indicate it was well-loved.
"Thats not a goblin," Ron said looking confused
"Now in second part,' Bella said "as holder of the high table and all previously listed titles I hereby expell Cornelius Fudge from his position as minister of magic for failure to complete the duties of his office. I place Amelia Bones as the new Minister of Magic and Rufus Scrimingor as new head of DMLE. Kingsly Shacklebolt witll take over his position as head Auror. So Mote it be"
"I found him walking here," Draco said breathlessly as Lucius helped him lay harry on the couch," he just came from a detention with Umbridge."
"Not any more" Lady Anissia Selwyn said "I was going to wait after the results of the trial to disown you however I find it best to do it now. Delores Jane Umbridge is now exiled and disowned from any part of the Selwyn line. Another thing is that pendant is not an heirloom from our family."
"We don't know": Dumbledore replied
"Master Black called for Kretcher"
The Sacred Twenty-Eight comprised the families of:
The other pairings are as follows
"May I," Bella asked knowing Draco would be on edge. With a quick glance to his godfather Draco turned back to her and nodded. Kneeling down by the couch she placed a hand on Harry's head and heart.

" Force of habit my Lady," severus said
They parked and climbed out.
Just as they entered the chamber door they hear a cry
“Well now that that is over we have much to discuss,” Amelia started “We will start with talking about the upcoming trial however after the trial concludes whether that be today, tomorrow, or a week from now we will glean answers as to the other crimes committed such as false imprisonment of a member of our community.”
The hours of the warm evening lazily ticked by. Hermione and Ron volunteered to do the dishes, leaving Harry to tuck a yawning but petulant Teddy into bed.
"It varies, actually," Professor Slughorn called to him from the safety of his desk. "But the drinker's personality does tend to change a bit."
Draco scoffs quietly. “Who would take me?”

It was only as the clouds cleared away, far from the dementors, that Draco dared to look at his arm. He pulled back his sleeve and what he saw sickened him.
,” Harry whispered, and waited for the spell to pass through the house. “Nothing. Someone could be hiding, though…”
“Harry, is something…Going on between you and Malfoy?” Ron said slowly.
“Laurent, would you show Malfoy how to extract the essence?” Professor Sprout asked. Gavin’s soft features wrinkled in reluctance, but he obligingly demonstrated. Plunging a hand into the dirt, he grasped a length of squirming root, made an incision with a copper dagger, and began to squeeze the lime-colored juices into a nearby clay bowl.
"Paying my respects, obviously." Harry could picture Draco Malfoy's snide face even though he was invisible. But Harry heard a hint of something else, too. Regret.

They found Joanne sitting alone, abandoned plates and napkins circling the linen. Her chin rested in one hand while the other moved beneath a floating steak knife, spinning it in midair; Harry couldn’t see a wand.
He writes, later, sitting on the steps of an abandoned beach house, a tattered journal in his lap.
In comparison to the first work of Fate’s Garden, I don’t feel that there’s much to say about
best friend. And that friendship had turned into something more, something which Ron believed to be a pretense orchestrated by Malfoy. In the days following Harry’s confession, Ron had wondered whether the disgust he felt was because of homophobia, but that wasn’t the case. He would be okay with Harry dating pretty much any age-appropriate bloke they knew - but
Harry laughed. “It does, actually.”
“But it’s like I said,” Luna continued, “The heart wants what it wants.”
“You have to tell Ron and Hermione,” Ginny said firmly. “They’re your best friends, they have a right to know.”
A shadow began to saunter, half-hidden behind a dust cloud. Fear pierced deep into Draco’s heart, uninvited. He exchanged a glance with Joey - she’d seen it, too.
“We will,” Harry promise, and the break in his voice caused tears to gather, unwanted, in Draco’s eyes. “We’ll show mercy, Dahlia.”
Harry thought fiercely,
Draco uncertainly grabbed a gnome from underneath the bushes and let it dangle by one foot.
Someone’s staring at him.
“I see. Maybe it’s schizophrenia?” Harry muttered to himself.
Draco, on the floor, breathes in gasping gulps, his heartbeat fierce with fear and betrayal. Lucius holds not an ounce of pity for either of them.
“Same for me. I’m excited to start training to be an Auror,” Harry declared, grinning. He’d had his heart set on the profession ever since the fifth year; under no circumstances would he give up on that dream.
“It’s been a pleasure watching you grow, class of 2002,” Danjuma began, clasping her hands. “I am impressed with your progress, as my colleagues are. I said this every year after the fall of Lord Voldemort,” a shudder went through the crowd, but Harry was proud to see that Draco did not react, “And I say it again today: Do not be complacent. You are the protectors of this nation, of the world we live in. Dark forces will always rise, but so will you. Take your responsibilities to heart, young ones. The fate of those you love and cherish depends on it. Now, that is enough from me,” Danjuma said, with a grandmotherly smile, “Allow your supervisors to praise you even more, and tell you who your partners will be for your first official mission.”
“I promise, Draco.” Harry expected the young man’s first name to feel strange on his tongue, but it felt as natural as Ron’s or Hermione’s.
“In fact, Malfoy, I have no idea what you’re talking about,” Harry replies, irked.

“Whatever. But we can’t-”
“Don’t discredit yourself,” Draco told him. “But yeah, you’re lucky to have me,” He added, smirking.
“’ Bye,” Ron shook his head at his brother as Hermione hustled them on to the train.
“Oh, yes,” Ginny gushed. “Just perfect. We have a solid shot at winning it all this year.”
“Stop that!” Lucius roars and slaps him. Draco’s head drops onto his chest, and he ceases struggling. Terror grips his limbs as Lucius presses his wand tip to Draco’s pale, pure forearm. “
, before you interrupted me,” Amélie shot back. “I’m quite envious of her if you must know. She partnered with Andreas during our exercises,” She grumbled.
“This one put up quite a fight,” Padma agrees.
"Anyway," Malfoy continued coolly, "You should've known I would be here."
“Ouch, Malfoy!” Harry exclaimed, and it was then that Draco’s crying ceased and he blearily opened his eyes.
Harry anticipated Draco coming up with a snappish remark to this command
“Yeah, but I need a break,” Harry replied; his neck ached from reading all those books. “I’m going to take a walk.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry watches as the man brings his mug under the table, dumping into it the caramel-colored contents of a tiny glass bottle. The stranger looks up, accidentally meets his eyes. He smirks and raises the mug of coffee in wordless cheers. Harry glances away.
on me.”
“You’re always doing this!” Padma wailed, and a few heads in the bar turned towards their table. Next to Harry, Draco froze like a deer in headlights. “You’re deflecting, Gavin, instead of actually dealing with the problem.”
“Do you even know her name?” Lucius asked, a deadly edge creeping into his voice. “The Mudblood girl you killed?”
“Trying to work with you. He’s just…wary of strangers.”
Phew, what an emotional rollercoaster! I like to think of this chapter as a sort of microcosm for the story in its entirety: conflict, reconciliation, found trust, and - hopefully! - a happy ending. Also, I've been writing from Draco's perspective more lately. Obviously, Harry's the main character here, but it's interesting to dive into a darker, more troubled psyche once in a while, especially when it comes to more emotionally vulnerable moments like these. Originally, I actually started writing this scene from Harry's point of view, but I like this version better. (I did save the original bit, which I have saved in a deleted scenes document that will be available at the end of the story.)
“So, I think to meself, ‘Ah, that’s just normal school rivalry, boys bein’ boys.’ An’ I guess it was, ter summat degree. I even heard about Harry and couple o’ other kids jinxin’ yeh a few times. But when You-Know-Who came back,” Hagrid sighed heavily into his cup, “That’s when everythin’ changed. I didn’t see you much meself, Malfoy, but teachers talk, you know. Sixth year was the worst for you. Yeh didn’t eat much, couldn’t focus. Harry here noticed somethin’ was off, too. Ron an’ Hermione told me how yeh wouldn’t stop talkin’ about Malfoy,” Hagrid addressed Harry, “What he could be up to, an’ yeh thought he was a Death Eater.”
The five storytellers turned to Draco, who tensed at the attention on him. “All his life, the poppy had known bitterness and discomfort.” He hesitated, and Harry nodded encouragingly. “But the rose whispered only sweetness to him, and slowly she made him happier.”
“I hated you last year, I’m not going to deny it. Ever since the day you rejected my friendship, I hated you, though all the while, I still wanted to be you. You had a perfect life.”
Harry picks up the script. “Maybe that’s a good thing?”
“No.”
I went pretty much scene by scene with the movie open in another desktop window. But about a quarterways through, I realized that I was just copying the movie. Draco and Harry’s characters had been smothered and made one-dimensional by my laziness. I abandoned the project altogether in favor of focusing on my longer fics.
“Why should you care?” Draco replied. “I don’t deserve your attention.”
have a serious question for you, though.” Ron sat up, looking sheepish. “How does one…shag?”
The shimmering air moved uncomfortably. Malfoy's outline was beginning to be more and more apparent. "Oh? And how do you know that?"
“No problem, Justikins,” Pansy simpers, ruffling his curls affectionately. Justin makes a face. “Anyway…since Luna’s coming, should I bring my boyfriend?”
“A classical orchestra?” Hermione asked, eyes shining.
“Good afternoon, what can I get for you?” Draco flashes a smile – Harry feels like he’s been punched in the stomach. Draco’s upbeat tone, his manufactured positivity, is a mask he wears at his job. But not with Harry. Never with Harry.
“Yeah, sure.” Harry grabbed a too-small knit sweater from inside his trunk and tossed it to his best friend.
Of course, I owe most of this story to the movie it’s based off of,
Fear, pure, unadulterated fear, shone in Lucius’s eyes. For a moment, Draco saw himself in his father’s face, and he faltered, the magical fire sputtering out. Panting, he let his arms fall to his sides.
“Anything to drink?” asked the waitress, whose name tag read
“The poppy was jealous of the beautiful rose and hated it. But…” Gavin paused, thinking. “The rose had never known hate, so she chose to be the poppy’s friend.”
“Comforting,” Harry finished, and he and Joey exchanged a glance that was, if not friendly, kindred.
Had Hermione been trying to get his attention? As the weeks passed, Hermione had seemed to focus on her schoolwork and her relationship with Ron. Harry thought she’d moved on. So why did she look at him like that, like she had something more to say?
The corners of Joey’s lips rose. “Yes. We have.” Then her face fell. “We might not be done yet. That explosion was not a coincidence. The person, maybe a mercenary, sent after me obviously has a lot of resources. Considering that, and the masked witch in Cambodia…” She trailed off.
Blue and red dots flicker on the surface of the helmet. Justin flicks on a few switches, then steps over the wires back to his monitor and keyboard. He types in a few commands, hits enter.
“After what we told her about the Death Eaters,” Draco said shakily, “I wouldn’t say that reaction was completely unjustified.”
Harry was the most emotionally perceptive person she had ever met, unfortunately for her intentions.
“And look how well it went,” Luna cut across him, in a very un-Luna-like way. “Draco, Harry, you can’t live in the dark like this.”
“Oh, right.” Padma laughed uncomfortably. “Well…Love comes from unlikely places.” She and Gavin exchanged a knowing glance.
“All right, all right. No need to fuss.” Harry tugged on the gloves, which were surprisingly soft on the inside.
Narcissa’s blue eyes twinkled for a moment. Then her face fell. “Yes. I suppose we ought to discuss something else.” She frowned. “You recall my letter. Your father and I will likely go to Azkaban.”
Draco made a
This chapter focuses more on the minutia rather than big-picture stuff, in comparison with the previous chapter. Now that the characters have settled back in the Burrow, along with Draco, I wanted to give a couple of snapshots of their interactions - which of course have changed with the appearance of an outsider.
It was hard for Draco to feel uneasy after eating a bowl of the most delicious soup he’d ever tasted. Warm, translucent broth flavored with hoisin sauce, crunchy basil and bean sprouts, and a dash of lime juice surrounded thin, translucent noodles. Draco knew he shouldn’t be letting his guard down, but beneath the fluorescent lights, the hum of the restaurant’s refrigerator, and a full stomach didn’t make him alert - he wanted to take a nap.
Harry Potter stood immediately from a sofa, eyes shining like emeralds, brows crinkled. His hair was messier than ever, his Muggle shirt wrinkled as if he’d slept in it. Draco had been planning to shout at him to get out, but the sight of him after weeks drew all the breath out of Draco’s lungs. He didn’t look helpless, nor desperate, but relieved. Draco suddenly remembered something Harry had once said to him in eighth year, about not needing him but wanting him more than anything. Harry did not depend on Draco for survival. Perhaps Draco had begun to learn that skill, too.
Harry wondered, hardly believing that a Malfoy, of all people, truly wanted to have a civil relationship with him.
Lucius’s head was bowed; he appeared to be sleeping. His pale hands and feet were bound to the wall by long chains; the more Draco looked at them, observing their length, the faster he realized why they were there.
“We should be there soon. I’ll drop you off.”
Joanne looked up sharply. The bright red of her dress set against smooth brown skin, the point of the knife hovering over her index finger, and the cautious but fierce look in her eyes struck a beautiful but intimidating tableau and Harry lost his voice for a moment. “Who are you?” She asked, then, “Oh…I recognize you,” She said, and the knife quivered, aiming at Draco.
Joey tentatively took the potion and draped it over her head. “Thank you.”
“It only happens when we don’t get to a proper end, but it
“Joanne,” Draco corrected.
“True.” Harry quit moving his hands and instead clenched them together in his lap, so tightly that the brown skin became several shades paler.
“Dishy, eh?” Ron says with a grin. “Bet she’ll be a heartbreaker.”
about coming.”
Draco nodded curtly, procured a mortar and pestle, and began to the eucalyptus leaves. Harry sliced the licorice root accordingly, careful not to cut himself on the dagger’s keen edge.
Harry scoffed. “Shall I shoot you in revenge, then?”
He thought. The cobblestones, the midday sun, the university students and churchgoers, the cafés, the wizarding pubs, the Academy with its polished hallways and lively student body... That’s where he wanted to go.
Between Here and the Stars will return on August 28th.
“I was being careful, Harry.” Joey at least had the decency to look flustered. “I apologize. But there was no harm done.”

Draco still hadn’t regained his composure, looking as if he was trying to magic himself into his chair. “Three years last February,” Harry replied, discreetly wiping his mouth with the back of his hand - the kiss had been sloppier than he would’ve liked.
Harry shook his head, a bit astonished at that fact himself. He’d never heard of such a precise, damage-inducing spell, let alone potion. And the fact that the invention had come from a student with only secondary education was frankly… “Impressive,” Harry said appreciatively, “That’s really great magic, Draco, I’ve never seen anything like it.”
Harry pauses to come up for air. “Do you like it?” He asks Draco. He must like it. The Potters are the best cooks in the world.
There’s a palpable sense of unease that fills the silence, broken only by the steady drip of seeping rainfall and the panting breath of two exhausted people. The angered cries from outside are utterly muffled by the twists and turns of stone; for now, the young wizards are safe.
“I don’t…” Then he remembered: Valentine’s Day. His least favorite holiday by far, and one he’d done absolutely nothing to celebrate when he was with Ginny, who disliked the overblown romanticism as well. Last year, Valentine’s had been spent traveling throughout the country, Ron, Hermione, and Harry constantly looking over their shoulders for Death Eaters and staying utterly concealed from the hundreds who hunted Undesirable No. 1. “Oh.”
“That was suspiciously easy,” Joey remarked as the culprit thrashed and cussed in French.
“Uh-huh.”
“A bad breakup, then, huh?” Luna continues, ignoring her.
“How do you think we got here?” Draco muttered, and Harry elbowed him.
“It feels like afternoon to me,” Luna said serenely. “Let’s go, then.” She glided in front, leading them into the dining hall.
For the rest of the day, Draco seemed to be determined not to be alone in the same room as Harry. The rest of the students invited him to participate in their various pastimes, and he accepted but was careful not to sit too close to Harry. And when Mrs. Weasley asked for help in the kitchen, Draco practically leaped to assist her, despite never cooking a meal by himself in his life.
A few beats of silence as the car turns, Harry’s hands flexing against the steering wheel. “Sorry if I was a little overbearing today,” Draco says.
“Pardon me,” A voice drawled from the doorway. “But your mum’s been shouting for the past five minutes that dinner’s ready. I thought you ought to know.”
“No, please…” Draco hesitated as Astoria ignored him and vanished the contents of the cauldron. “Oh, fine.” He flicked his wand, and his satchel flew into his hand. “You’re an angel, Greengrass!” Draco called over his shoulder as he headed out the back entrance.
“Normally, I’d just ignore people like him,” Joey said, fiddling with the handle of her cup. “Unfortunately, I can’t do that.”
Luna kisses Padma, and everything comes rushing back.
Harry and Draco sat far apart from each other, both filling out answers to Potions questions. Harry could barely concentrate, glancing up restlessly from his parchment every few seconds to check if the pair of fifth-years had gone yet. The two Slytherins sat on a leather couch, the girl in her lover’s lap as they talked and giggled quietly, utterly oblivious to the other two students.
“That’s what your name means, doesn’t it? In Latin?”
“Um...Yeah. Okay.”
“Seduce me?” Harry echoed. “
“I think…” He wets his lips, unsure. “Someone stole one of your dragons.”
“Oh, really? Weasley said that?” Draco scoffed.
thought I was taking the piss,” Pansy whirled on her, eyes flashing. “I guess you were wrong about him.”
The view out of the window flickers. It momentarily turns to night, and in the new darkness, Draco’s silver eyes become lucid, as they did before. He looks curiously at his absent limbs. “I thought you wanted this.”
“Yes.” As they set off down the hallway, shoulders brushing every other step, Harry ran a nervous hand through his own untidy hair, knowing full well that it would stick up all over the place anyway.
Harry held the letter up slightly so Draco could read it over his shoulder, and they both scanned it carefully.
“I thought…” Harry’s gaze touched upon every stranger in sight. They were all passive, lost in their daily trips and business and family. None had any time nor attention for a trio of backpacking students. “Nothing. It's nothing.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, and they turned a corner.
“That is not your decision to make.”
“Ron, that’s not funny,” Hermione scolded.
“All right, but surely some girl’s given you a…” Ron made an explicit gesture with his fist and widened his eyes knowingly. Harry clapped a hand to his forehead in embarrassment.
“Fine. I’ll leave you alone.”
Summer spread itself lazily across the Hogwarts grounds, breezes winding between the towers, carrying the fragrance of freshly blooming flowers. Sunshine beamed down warmly on a sauntering Saturday, and most students abandoned their robes for light Muggle clothes as they walked in groups to Hogsmeade.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Obviously. But look.” He polished the pin’s slightly dusty surface with his sleeve, then affixed it to one corner of his satchel. Then he stared at Harry expectantly.
Joey wasn’t sure how to respond, so she didn’t.
“Don’t you usually put your glasses on the nightstand?” Ron said, puzzled.
“What?” Harry looked at the apple and blinked. “Oh. Er… I’m not supposed to bring food. Ron gave it to me, you see, and I forgot I had it…”
“You deserve the truth,” they replied simply. “Your Ministry won’t give it.”
“Bloody hell,” Ron said grumpily, “No need to get all spooky like that…Oh. It’s you.”
“Make yourselves some pancakes if you like,” Mrs. Weasley said, sinking tiredly into the sofa. “The batter’s in the fridge.”
“Not often. I didn’t want to worry you.”
Harry considered. Though he didn’t dare to admit so in front of anyone, the idea of someone so loathsome wanting Draco to herself nearly sickened him.
“Oh.” Ron nodded. “Well, Hermione wanted to know if you wanted to work on the Herbology essay together. And I can ask Malfoy to join us, if he wants to. Unless you want to go to sleep now?”
Draco meandered to a rack of dress shirts, shoving his hands in his pockets to discourage the childish urge to run his hands over the cloth. As a kid, he used to do that, back when he thought all the world was in his grasp.
Before the witch could make a move, Ray lifted his hands and flicked his fingers. The door slammed, and the foyer was thrown back into hushed whispers, the noise of the street and people cut off completely.
“I dunno,” Draco sighs in mock concern, stripping off his gloves. His hands are as pale as his face. “You’ve been following me all day.”
with you.”
Harry hesitated for a moment, but one look inside the surety of those silver eyes, and he chose to trust. “I’ll see you later, okay?”
This fight, Harry quickly realized, would be markedly different from two-on-one sparring in a classroom - the enemies’ wandless casting was slower, but the gusts and crackles of magic without knowing what came next were hard to block. Harry found himself using one Shield Charm after another, managing only to get a few spells in edgewise, but the two wizards blocked for each other. The hiss and pops of magic ground loudly against Harry's ears. He gritted his teeth and swiftly dropped to his knees as another Stunning Spell whistled inches over his head and shot a thunderbolt at one wizard - it hit him square in the chest, and he collapsed to the dirt.
Back in the garden, Draco rolled up his sleeves before squatting down by the gnarled roots of an ancient oak tree, waving for Harry to join him. “Come here, Potter.”
Hermione laughed and nudged him in the arm. Ron caught Harry’s eye and mouthed,
A wave of dizziness, brought on by Apparation, overtook Harry. Fresh pain shot through his forehead, and he steadied himself against a tree trunk, gritting his teeth.
Ginny cleared her throat, pointedly. Luna piped up, “You know, Harry’s got a b-”
Three little brown birds, which Draco recognized as sparrows, swooped overhead, chirping and dancing circles around each other as they headed for the trees. The silhouette of their tiny figures against the bright expanse of the sky suddenly reminded him of something.
“Come in, it’s unlocked,” She called, and Harry and Draco walked in to find her sitting up in bed, a slim book in hand. Sunlight from the window illuminated the cabin, stark white linen and brown wooden accents empty and clean. Joey, in a T-shirt, her braids trailing over her shoulders, looked indifferent to see them. “What’s going on?”
The familiar voice pierced the quiet like a sword through ice. Draco, who seemed to be in a rush, came up to Harry, looking more animated than usual. A clinking sound came from his school bag, which hung heavily across one shoulder.
“Not like that, you’re not,” Draco said. He reached forward and tugged Harry gently into the firelight. His pale hands moved quickly as they looped the fabric into a neater shape.
Draco wrung his hands, gaze falling to the ground. “Pansy and I were betrothed.” The silence that followed was broken only by a flapping of tiny wings as the blue jay from earlier cautiously alighted upon a neighboring tree. Harry’s mouth fell open, and it took him a moment to come up with words to say.
“I don't think anyone’s seriously hurt,” Harry said, affirming Draco’s thoughts. Green eyes flitted over those who had begun to stand, muttering and crying in shock. He turned to Draco, one hand landing on his shoulder, the other holding up his wand. “Are you okay?”
Harry grinned through his tears. “Nope.”
It made all the sense in the world for the leader to lead the way, but envy bit through Harry without his permission as he followed Joey and Draco off the ship. He fiddled with the straps of his bag, tightening and loosening them to take his mind off her. How could Joey be on speaking terms with Draco after threatening to kill him?
“He might have,” Esther said grumpily, “If you hadn’t opened the door. I suppose you’re going to let them all in, then? Even the dangerous one?”
Draco snuggles closer, lilac hair peeking out from his green winter hat. “You’re so dramatic,” He says sleepily.
