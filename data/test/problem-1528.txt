Wanting to keep the good mood, Jason decided to let it go. While it was unnerving not to trust his mate completely, something in him sensed a lie.
“Oh, well I’m sure it’s fine.” Harry suddenly understood why she had called for Dean. He was certainly the only one amongst them whom even cared slightly about clothes. Hermione sighed and pulled the curtain back completely so he could see her.
So this chapter is one I have really looked forward too! I had to rewrite it a few times since I didn’t want to change the characters too much, but I still needed some sort of maturing tone.
“Oh Harry it’s a wonderful idea. Can I come as well? I never tried to have a snowball fight except with dad.”
Smirking encouragingly, Draco laid back down on the pillow, popped up so he could still see him. Harry took a deep breath, nervous, as he felt watched. Continuing to stroke it, he waited until more liquid had gathered before leaning in to lick the head. The taste wasn’t good, in any way, he hated salt, but licking the head a few times more, he knew he could get used to it. Tiny licks, turned bigger as Harry felt his way down. He mouthed the long string on the underside and couldn’t help but inhale the musky scent of sweat and Draco from the blond short hair surrounding the cock. As the member felt wet enough, Harry felt ready too.
“Jason? Better. Much better, actually. Madam Pomphrey says he should be out of bed after a few days’ rest.”
“Madam Pomphrey thinks it’s a matter of time.” Malfoy turned back to look at him. “I’m just glad you are okay now.”
As Zabini quickly went back to read for more information on the potion in their book, Jason took charge of the making.
“Knew? God, no.” Jason smirked almost angrily. “As far as I knew, my father was a squib. We were never very close to the wizarding world in Australia, except when I went to school. I think it was painful to him, never having experienced it, but he was happy in the muggle world so… we just stayed there.” He shrugged.
Their lips danced across each other before Draco pulled him back. Breathing elevated, Draco didn’t open his eyes as he leaned in and kissed the tan cheeks. Placing a single on each he whispered;
Theodore could no longer hold it in and as the staircase moved, he almost didn’t make it, laughing so hard. The others, even though smirking, had better control over their amusement. Blaise on the other hand had his fist and most likely his jaw, clenched. As Theodore continued to laugh the gang headed up to the third floor.
“Ah Harry, I see you brought young Mr. Malfoy along.” Dumbledore acknowledged their presence. “Come now,” he waved Harry closer to him and led him towards the dragon and Hagrid. Draco stayed behind and stood next to Professor Snape.
a safe topic for them to discuss. Harry believed Malfoy could go the next fifty years without ever mentioning Lord Voldemort’s name or the months he had spent in his presence. Instead of continuing to pick lint, Malfoy’s hand unconsciously pulled his left sleeve further down. Perhaps the fact that Harry mentioned the past would make Malfoy back off.
“He most certainly did. Was a rather violent one at that.” Professor Sprout said, sending a disapproving glare Snape’s way. The tall dark man simple ignored her as they continued up the last staircase.
“So where is your brother now?” Harry continued the conversation as he collected the snowballs in smaller piles around him.
But no matter how much he wanted to convince himself otherwise, Draco couldn’t ignore the hard-tell feeling of pure joy when he noticed the Gryffindor blushing madly under his stare.
“Please, let me finish.” He put his other hand on top of Harry’s once more. “Harry I was… horrified and ashamed when I realized how I had left things between us and left you to go back to the muggles. And what was even worse; I had done it once before.”
Draco took him by the hand and practically dragged him to a little corridor a few hallways from the great hall. As the loud voice of hundreds of student became a distant murmur, Harry wondered what Draco wanted. A tiny ray of hope wished that Draco was going to ask him to the dance. Harry was perfectly aware of how pathetic it was, having to wait for Draco to ask him instead of just asking himself, but he was terrified of Draco saying no. Finally, the blond teen stopped them and immediately dropped Harry’s hand. After standing in complete silence for a while, Harry asked what he wanted to talk about.
The teen refused to answer and closed the door behind him. Thankfully, he didn’t run into any other Professors or Filch. The fair lady gave him a rather scoffing look but let him in without further notion. Lying in bed, Harry went over tonight’s events.  He and Draco had gone further than ever before and it had been so amazing he felt like giggling. Snape had warned him about Draco and usually he had a good insight, but this time, Harry knew he was wrong. Draco cared for him, he knew it. Whilst he had been sceptic as well in the beginning, he had spent enough time around the Slytherin to know the truth. Draco liked him, just as much as Harry liked him. Snape was just being paranoid and how was that anything new?
Further down the table sat Professor Snape along with the Headmaster on one side and Professor Vector on the other. While both Vector and Snape was known to be more introvert than most of the teachers, the headmaster was certainly jolly enough for all three of them. In the end, it obviously became too much Christmas joy for the potion Professor and he gracefully got up and left with a billowing cloak behind him. Jason watched him as well and only few minutes after, he got up and followed Snape out. Thankfully, the students around them were too busy eating and chatting to even notice, if the two Slytherins had left in a rather suspicious short time after each other.
Hope it was good enough for you to continue reading this story. Please leave a review, it means so much to me!
The students walked back in silence. The fact that they had been caught and Professor Snape had deducted points, had left them feeling awkward around each other. Harry was still walking hand in hand with Draco and he squeezed it tightly.
The dragon stood strongly with outspread wings, looking bigger and more intimidating than Harry could ever have imagined him. Looking further ahead he could see the spider getting confused by the interference. Harry could only believe the spider saw the dragon as a mere rival to his bloody flesh and not so much as a protector. For a painful long minute, the spider seemed at odd what to do. Holding his breath, Harry wished for it to give up and leave.
“I don’t care about that!” Pansy paced. “You weren’t supposed to introduce him to your parents! You basically outed me in front of my family. My father is angry, okay? He doesn’t understand why you are all of a sudden is gay and worse is; why would you tell your parents?”
“Oh really?” Now the Ravenclaws looked less amused. The other boy reached slightly into his robe pocket, probably were his wand was hidden. Before he even had the chance to touch it, two of the Slytherins had pulled their owns, pointing it directly at him. Harry could only stand by as silent glaring battle began. Thankfully, it ended as quickly as it had begun, before Lesley shoved Harry’s shoulder and went past the Slytherins. Ravenclaws could be obnoxious but they were usually not stupid enough to mess with the Slytherin. Unless of course, they were certain Gryffindor was on their own side.
When they reached the Quidditch pitch gates, they were not only very early but the Slytherin had been having DADA with the Hufflepuffs and wouldn’t arrive for at least another five minutes. The Gryffindor group just sat down on the cold stone benches and chatted. Hermione had brought a book she enlarged after grabbing it from her inner robe pocket. While Luna asked many wonderous questions on Herbology – which usually only had something to do with plants no one had ever heard of - , the boys discussed the safe topic of Quidditch, compared to the muggle sport football.
“I hope I can wait that long, because seeing you in that suit, is making mine tighter.” As if the words weren’t more than enough to make his stomach knot in arousal, Draco pulled at his earlobe with his teeth for just a second.
Harry was strolling around the courtyard in his winter clothes. After his first class had ended with divination, he had felt the need for some fresh air. The rest of the class had headed for the great hall and probably the warm halls for recess. Harry didn’t really feel like staying inside. While most of the school had calmed down about the idea of him and Draco, the gatherings in the great hall was harder to ignore, considering the whispering voices travelled far.
The idea of sleeping with Draco for the first time was definitely a pleasing and exciting thought. He felt ready to have sex and right now Draco was the only person whom he could see this happening with.
“Argh, fine! If it means that much to Harry. But stay in Slytherin where you belong, Malfoy! Don’t even
After almost speaking for an hour without interfering, Harry proposed they started opening the presents.
Soon everything was back to a boring normal day. While writing notes, Blaise couldn’t help but discreetly glance at Weasley. He couldn’t really see his face as the ginger was sitting up front, but it wasn’t hard to see how the book-nosed girl beside him, was trying to calm him down and continuing to furiously scribble notes on the side. While he couldn’t hear what they were whispering about, he certainly noticed that the golden boy was missing from their clutches. Perhaps he had snuck out and run after Draco. It was as good an explanation as any. Blaise also wasn’t the only one who noticed a small paperbird flying back and forth between the gryffindorks whenever Flitwick was scrawling on the headboard.
“What? It doesn’t- A few Slytherins and Gryffindors.” Severus said, not wishing to go into further detail.
Standing there holding most of his books, Malfoy lent a hand to help him up. Giving him a smile, Harry took the outreached help. Back on his feet, Harry was about to say ‘thank you’ when a rather angry voice erupted.
Glowering beside him Theodore Knott gave him a rather weird look. The boy nodded his head to the side as if to show him the rest of the hall. Sending a bored look out amongst his peers, he realized most of the students were looking either at him or at Potter. A sinking feeling left Draco rather conflicted. Why were they all staring?
“Sounds fun.” Harry scratched the back of his head, continuing to fold his clothes. Somehow it seemed easier to talk if you didn’t actually had to look another man in the eyes. Especially when it considered ‘touchy’ subjects.
“Hey! I completely forgot. This week Fred and George are at the shop, should we stop by and say hello?”
His eye caught a rattling between two of his students. Ah, Mr. Melck and Zabini were at it again. How the tan boy had ever been put in Slytherin, he could only wonder. He was certainly intelligent enough, but he showed too much emotion from the huge smiles he sent to every person. One boy had certainly caught his affection, however unwanted it was.
Confused, Harry turned back to his history partner. Jason could obviously see the confusion on his face as he continued;
“Just a simple giraffe in natural colors and brown eyes. About this size.” He indicated. “If you could deliver it by owl to Hogwarts that would be perfect.” Discussing the few last details, Harry was certain it would be a perfect gift. He waved goodbye to the old man, and as he was about to leave the store, tiny puffs of smoke hit him in the chest. Searching for the source, he found a small red dragon made out of wood looking intensely at him. Chuckling at the tiny creature, he suddenly got another great idea for what to give Snape.
“Wow.” Harry uttered again. He couldn’t believe this. Jason was not only a veela, well partly, but also his mate was Blaise Zabini. Now, he could understand why Jason called it fate. It seemed rather impossible for it to be coincidental for a tourist from England to leap right into the arms of his mate half away across the earth.
“Yeah, we do have one thing for you.” George pulled out a small item from his inner pocket. Making sure, no one was watching he handed the tiny piece and placed it in Harry hand.
Yes, everything would be fine. His parents were off his case at least until spring, Pansy had promised not to tell on him and Potter would fall in love with him within the next few weeks. And hopefully on top of that, Draco would get to pound his ass a couple of times before the end of the year.
“Harry, where are you going? Class was cancelled, remember?” Hermione’s voice called after him as he went in the direction of the front door.
“It’s okay.” Harry assured him. He didn’t have to share personal details. He had his fair share of experiences of published his personal life and it never led to anything good.
“-And that was indeed the last time someone would bring a real ice breathing dragon to another Hogwarts event. Well, everyone please take your seats as dinner will be served shortly.”
Madam Pomphrey was convinced Jason could sense that Blaise was beside and while it made absolutely no sense why he would do that, Blaise stayed beside him. Hoping it wasn’t too late.
Pansy shrugged. “It’s not surprising you don’t believe me, but seriously, Draco is the one whom have been lying. He is a Slytherin.
“Uh is that an early present for our savior?” Seamus teased. The rest of his friends looked as well as Harry quickly moved the present out of Seamus’ reach.
“But he is alive; maybe he needs a little help?” Harry tried hopeful. Hagrid shook his head silently.
Draco should have known Blaise wasn’t trying to anger him but right now the angry green monster had eaten his way through his chest and unfortunately, Blaise stood in the way.
“Probably not.” Luna agreed. “Who knows? Maybe she hoped he felt the same as she did; That the risk was well worth the outcome. Perhaps he would see she had only done it out of love even if he didn’t agree with her plan.”
The door behind him closed and he stood alone in a freezing cold room. Without removing his glance from the stonewall, he took a step back. Then another and another, until he hit the other end of the room and slide down to the floor. So many emotions passed through him in just a few seconds. Sadness, betrayal and anger hit his body like a ranging train. So much pain…
“Yes!” his torso moved up from the water as he shot white ropes of come over the bubbles. He gently pulled out his fingers and almost fell back into the tub as his jelly-like legs gave out. Panting, he moved a hand over his face, removing the sweat that had gathered. Completely exhausted, he got up carefully, cleaned the tub and went back to the tower. It was without a doubt the hardest he had ever come in his life. If sex were any better than what had just happened, he would probably die.
Harry couldn’t help but wonder if it was because of him. It sounded like Malfoy was truly trying harder and the idea made him feel lightheaded, almost… fuzzy and warm inside. Trying to keep his friends from seeing him, he felt a smile spreading across his face. Looking discreetly towards the Slytherin table he searched for the blond boy. As he finally found him, Harry’s face split into a big smile and he tried his hardest to turn his gaze from the boy before anyone noticed. Malfoy seemed shocked at the smile he sent him and he didn’t recover before Harry had looked away again. He couldn’t believe Malfoy actually had stood up for his friends like that. It seemed so un-Malfoy-ish. But if he continued like this, Harry could see them becoming friends, or something more, faster than he expected.
Well things had already taken a dramatic turn this morning; Draco thought. But as it turned out, it could be weirder.
“You stole this.” Severus stated. “What if we had gotten caught?” he couldn’t imagine anything more horrifying than Mr. Malfoy having to get him out of jail with a muggleboy by his side over a cheap bottle of wine. Lauris simply shrugged.
“I know you think he is heartless, but he only dealt with a difficult situation.” He quickly hurried to continue as Harry snorted in disbelieve. “He did. I didn’t see it that way for many years, but I realized when I would have to see these people again, they would have eaten me alive. My father tried to toughen me up at a young age.”
He felt as though everyone around them had grown so mature. Had anyone asked him a year ago, if he could mention a single person from Slytherin whom he could at least ‘maybe’ see as a good conversationalist, the obvious answer would have been to laugh in whoever-asked’ face. However, after these months he was able to answer ‘plenty’. No, he might not be BFF’s with Jason nor Blaise but he could definitely see himself keeping in touch with Melck.
Feeling as if he were monitoring a private moment, Harry coughed slightly. “Professor Snape, perhaps we should…” he left the suggestion unspoken and while it was obvious Snape would rather stay by his son’s side, he seemed equally uncomfortable watching his son’s ex-lover cry.
Irritated by the mysterious notion, Draco finally left. He decided to skip the second class of DADA and wait for the lunchbreak.
Chuckling, Harry’s eyes eyes had finally adjusted to the light and he could see Malfoy’s teeth when he spoke. He could see the tiny reflection of light in them. They were way too white and pretty to be natural, but it was truly a nice smile. A more comfortable silence settled over them and however uneasy it had been before, was now slowly being replaced by a more urging one. Harry couldn’t help but realize how close they stood, merely a hand-length from each other. Almost too deliberately slow, Malfoy leaned towards him. Harry, whom had always been horrible at reading people, froze at the idea of kissing him. So far, Malfoy hadn’t initiated anything beside them hanging out and it was possible for future friends to hang out alone, right?
“Guys, I think I should buy a present for Draco but I’m not really sure what he would like. I mean, he has kind of a different taste-“
Finally, the headmaster stopped and turned to observe him. The blue eyes sparkled intelligently behind the round golden spectacles. He gently laid an old wrinkled hand on Harry’s shoulder, where it stayed warm and heavy, keeping him close.
“Once, when I was seven or eight, I think, I had this… stuffed animal. It was the only teddy I had ever gotten, because my grandmother gave it to me for my birthday. She died shortly after and my mother forbad my father to take it away.”
Draco couldn’t believe how well the plan had worked. Potter fell right into his trap and seemed ‘oh so grateful’ to him for saving the little trio. God, once again; how Gryffindors survived being so gullible, Draco had no clue.
Focusing his veela he flexed out his sharp nails and took a good swing in the bark of an oak tree. Inserting the other hand as well, he climbed up until he could see the teen from above his head. Going from tree branch to tree branch was quite more difficult than he had expected and he thanked Mother Nature for not placing the trees even further apart.
“Yes, I was already aware.” The professor laid down his quill and gave Harry his full attention. “And what in fact, am I supposed to do with this information?”
The second he remembered the night off the dance, his tears overflowed. Thick wet salty tears fell over his cheeks as he remembered their kisses and Draco saying he loved him… looking back he couldn’t believe he had actually fallen for it. Draco hadn’t changed, he never would. But who could blame him? How could Harry possibly had been stupid, so massively idiotic!- that actually thought
Somehow, Harry always felt slightly saddened whenever he saw a unicorn. Considering the first time he ever saw one, was as a witness to a horrible death of one being killed by Quirrell and Voldemort. Simply watching the creatures were so enticing, you could practically feel the magic radiating off them. Something so pure could only be killed by someone truly evil.
Well that would a person who was sweet, helpful, funny – if his father had anything to say – and charming. Well, Malfoy was definitely charming. He was funny sometimes. Mostly in a sarcastic way or at the expense of others. He could be sweet when he really tried. He was probably helpful for some of his friends… Okay, looking back over the years Harry had known Malfoy, he wouldn’t exactly be the right guy for him to introduce. Certainly not to the Weasleys. That would be even more of a disaster than back in third year with Ron’s old rat Peter Pettigrew and Crookshanks. So who would be a great example of a boyfriend? Harry ripped a small corner of the parchment from his schoolbag and grabbed a feather. Looking amongst the students, he gathered inspiration.
“Harry, please, I know-“ Harry struggled harder. “I KNOW I messed up, but it wasn’t fake. What happened at the dance, afterwards-“
“He loves you. Yes, I heard you the first time.” She rolled her eyes at his repeated declaration. “Did it ever occur to you that just because he didn’t support the Dark Lord he might not be a good guy? It doesn’t just have to be one or the other?”
“Yeah, I mean-“ Draco took a deep breath. “I’m not really the loving-type, but I suppose you make me happy and i can only conclude that I feel the same.” He smirked teasingly.
As he finished speaking the bloody-red turned to a purple and the ball became a weirdly timeglassed-shape. Laughing he put it down on the table.
One could only picture the suffering and investigation it would lead to. Hagrid had also been the teacher to introduce Buckbeak to Malfoy, if he was accused and declared the reason once again…
“Yeah, the hat actually wanted to place me in Slytherin but since I had only met you as a Slytherin so I begged the hat to place me anywhere else.”
Scanning the crowd he found the small cloaked boy of Harry beside his group of friends. Jason had only met the group a few times, one of them being for the snowball fight, but he was very well aware of the redhead’s distaste for him.
“Oh,” Blaise leaned against the bookcase, as Jason continued to search for whatever. “So, he told you.”
“Yeah, in most cases he would have, but we have a great reservation over there; “Polokwane Reptiles Reservation.” We have two females there right now a few years older than him. They will surely take good care of him.”
Seeing the hurt in Malfoy’s eyes Harry shifted and brought on the most sarcastic voice he could muster.
“He is a Gryffindor. I tell him what he wants to hear and he will be eating out of my palm. The problem will be how to get him away from the weasel and the mudblood.” Draco sneered.
But unfortunately, this was the second Mr. Malfoy noticed Harry’s presence in the room. His eye grew almost comically wide as he pointed his hidden wand cane at him.
Theodore were reading a book without a cover. It was a mystery why Theo was using concealing charms on his books and magazines but Draco believed it to be a habit he inherited from his mother who worked at the Ministry sector of Secrecy.
“Yeah, I think so. I saw one back when we met up for DA. It wasn’t very pompous or gallant but maybe it is still open?”
The next few days passed by quickly. The day after Christmas, a horrible snowstorm settled over the castle and the students had been required to stay inside. Since he couldn’t go out to visit Aodhan and Hagrid, Harry chose to focus on Jason. The boy had continued his moody behavior and was very quiet. Most of the time he stayed in the library reading or in the common room staring out the enchanted high window.
Amongst all the loud chatter, one voice suddenly cut through him. Malfoy was coming around the Slytherin table, talking to his friends. At the sight of the platinum hair, nausea invaded his body and before he knew it, he had left his seat and the great hall.
And it was. Using his front arm, he moved the tight branches from a shriveling bush and turned his face to the side to protect his eyes from twitches. He pulled Blaise in behind him, easing them through. Getting passed the plants, they moved into the sun once more as they arrived at a small pond. Letting go of Blaise’s hand, he let the olive skinned boy move closer to the frozen beauty.
“Yeah, you heard correct. My father was pregnant. Radiant and glowing as he was smiling in the picture. He was waving and touching his stomach proudly. There was no way he had just gained weight. God, how I wanted to believe the weight-gain theory!” Jason laughed painfully. “I wished so badly for the side of my father which I had never seen, to be gone.”
Laughing the pair kissed passionately, their tongues more likely fighting than dancing. Harry couldn’t help the long deep moan from escaping him as Draco pushed his erection against his still trapped one. He was so lost in the kiss that he barely noticed it when Draco started dragging off his pants. Soon, he was as naked as he was born, and this time he didn’t feel the need to hide. Pushing up with a hand on each side of his face, Draco took in the beautiful view. While Harry wasn’t as muscled as most boys his age, the Quidditch had done wonders for him over the years.
“Erhm, Professor,” He moved a bit closer in case anyone was listening. “Would it be okay if Draco came as well?”
“Listen, Draco-“ That was unexpected. “Things between us lately have been… strained. But honestly, I’m… happy this whole thing is over. Don’t get me wrong, I hate losing,” she gave a cocky smile. “but I’ve hated the way we have been fighting these last few months. I’ve missed you.”
Very short chapter, but so much happened! I know it was really sappy but this is two teens whom never really felt love before. I’m sure most of you can remember being a teen and in love. Your life really felt like it was ending when it was over! SO dramatic!
we even were welcome. I wanted another chance, when the da- when he was there, in my house. I realized how badly I wished for a second chance.” Malfoy started to pick the cold grass from the ground. Nervous habit perhaps?
“A… OH.” In Harry’s hand laid a tiny square pink package and Harry had certainly been shopping in enough muggle stores to know the items behind almost any counter in the supermarket.
And now, here he was. Many years later and the children were still the same dunderheads they had always been. Few showed promises of talent in potion making and even fewer showed the interest in learning.
The Professor carelessly waved a hand at his thank, but Remus was still smiling even when Jason rolled his eyes at his father. Remus picked up the goblet and hurried to drink the –probably still disgusting tasting- potion. By the irked grimace, Harry was certain he was right about the taste. The obsidian eyes from the other side of the table followed Remus’ moves and even though Harry could barely see the difference expressions, it seemed as though Snape was satisfied in the trust of Remus drinking the potion without question.
“Indeed and I think Mr. Malfoy was very aware of that.” As they waited for the staircase to join their floor, Dumbledore looked him straight in the eyes.
“Wha-ehm.” Harry shook his head trying to clear his mind. This was surrealistic. “My summer. Fine. Just fine, I guess.”
Every reason for him to never care for another person, had left him when he met Jason. And now he was once again completely alone.
“I’m sure she wants to spend Christmas with you. Who wouldn’t?” Jason laughed in embarrassment, but Harry continued.
“So Draco, how is our little project coming along? Ready to admit defeat?” Pansy taunted sitting down across.
“Sure.” Blaise said. “We will see you tomorrow.” The boy turned and Jason gave a slight wave before they left.
Draco tried to slow his beating heart, desperate to get out of the overly heated classroom. Snape suddenly handed him a scrunched up piece of paper. He couldn’t help but raise his eyebrows at the change of topic as he reached for the note. Opening it, he certainly hadn’t expected to see a list of names. Glancing through it, he caught on to the fact that his own name was on it as well.
“Hey Fang.” Harry pushed the dog down and continued to rub his giant head. The scaredy-cat muscle dog barked a few more times before heading back for the hole he had furiously been digging.
“Good for him!” She sneered. “But what about the rest of us? Do you have any idea what our parents will think? A stupid affair in school is one thing, but we are leaving Hogwarts soon. You honestly believe your father is going to approve of this match?!”
“Damn Medusa and the holy grail.” Seamus grumbled as his amused boyfriend took his hand, consoling him.
“But now, you are with him.” he said cheerfully. “Which means he must generally care for you. I’m sure whatever was in the past, is no more. Besides, it was a very different time all those years ago. Nowadays, people seem less worried about status, blood and such nonsense.”
Behind her, the younger girls started giggling. Even though Harry was three years older than them, he felt the warm indication on his face of a blush starting to expand.
“Ah young Harry, I am taking a guess that you already heard the rumours going around? Stories certainly travels fast around a school, indeed.” Harry wasn’t sure he was talking to him anymore or himself.
As they slowly let each other go, Draco cleaned them with his wand. After readjusting their clothes the slid down against the stone wall. They kissed one last time.   “That was… wow.” Draco chuckled at his moronic sentence.  “Hey, about that dance,”
“I see.” Knott seemed lost in thoughts before opening up. “While Granger mostly tend to the Scandinavian runes such as stories or myths, I prefer to translate the more graphic and mathematical terms from Greece and Italy-“
“Sorry.” Harry cleared his throat rather embarrassed. “It just seems kind of obvious something is going on between you.”
“Severus.” Lupin tried carefully as Severus put away his wand. “How have you been?” Snape decided to ignore him and simply stood; proclaiming he was only making sure that everything around the field was back to normal.
“I refuse-“ Harry started yelling. Even though he knew he should be keeping his temperament in check, it always infuriated him when the Malfoys’ brought up blood status.
Malfoy didn’t seem to have anything to say, which again was a huge surprise considering his favourite activity was to hear his own voice; Harry thought semi-amused.
“Anytime.” Jason shrugged sadly. “In theory. In reality? It’s a lot to ask a person to become your soulbound. For most folks, a schoolcrush isn’t exactly a person nor the time to settle down and become married.”
“Yes…. Merlin,” Draco started biting his neck, maybe feeling embarrassed by the sounds he was making.
Dread, fear and most of all anger, seethed inside him. For the first time in months, he truly saw the Draco Malfoy he had wished to avoid ever since they started seeing each other. That ignorant, selfish prat with that stupid smirk…. The feelings of hurt rushed over as if a giant wave crashed into him.
“Doesn’t matter anymore.” she looked away seemingly ashamed. “You should know, I was the one who told Potter about the bet and seeing how much it hurt you, I have felt terrible ever since. I never meant to cause you pain, Draco. I just wanted what I thought would make me happy.”
“Ah, I see. Sorry but he’s certainly not so far away. I know Blaise saw him afterwards so maybe he just fell asleep or something. I don’t think you need to worry.”
He could feel how heavy his breathing got, but he was the only one in the dorm so he didn’t bother to hold back. His finger continued to explore his soft walls and he fucked himself faster and deeper. It felt really good now and he couldn’t hold back anymore. He grabbed his cock even harder and rode his own finger.
“No, seriously, of course she will, I would.” He goofily smiled, before a brilliant idea hit him. It was almost so perfect, he imagined a lightbulb would pop up any moment and explode.
Fearing his voice had been lost, he gave a slight nod. But it was enough for Lauris who smiled and opened the heavy door. Inside they went straight into the living room which Severus found incredible odd. It was very modest. The walls were painted in a reddish brown, where the couch and low coffee table was in a creamed color. A few houseplants had snuck in and made their way around the room. Some on the worn bookcase, a couple on the mantle and a single lily stood out on the small table in the middle of the room.
How did Harry always forget how direct this girl was? He truly cared deeply about Luna, but it was already hard enough for him to speak to a woman. How was her completely cheery way of saying she had no friends, going to be answered? He truly sucked at understanding women. Perhaps it was actually for the best that he had turned out gay.
Thankfully, of all the things the professor was, he was certainly intelligent and while he couldn’t understand the exact reason for the tortured teen, he understood enough. With a final squeeze, Snape got up and headed for the door with firm steps.
“Jason,” Blaise sat up to lean on his elbows. “We have been going out for almost six months. I want you, I have for such a long time. I’m starting to worry…”
As he neared the drinkstable, he noticed Professor Snape standing by. The potion master was most likely supervising the party rather than participating in it like his colleges. At first glance you wouldn’t see any difference in the proffessor’s formal wear than from his casual robes but taking a second notice these robes were almost darker than the usual dusty black color. The buttons on the front were entirely made of silver and he wore tiny matching cufflinks.
Soon though, he felt Draco other hand slip down his stomach. His touch stopped at his zipper and Harry tensed up. While the bulge in his black pants were rather noticeable, no one had ever touched him so intimately before.
Feeling his eyes beginning to get misty, he hurried and blinked. He refused to sit and cry over a nightmare. Especially in front of all his dorm mates. The dream had seemed so real. He twisted the bedcovers in anger and confusion. Would his parents actually have hated him if they were alive? Would they have reacted the exact same way the mirror portrayed it? He always assumed the nicest things because of what everyone kept telling him, but in the muggle world, Harry knew how conservative certain parts of Britain was. His aunt and uncle, for instance. How many times hadn’t he heard the angry slurs at the TV, every time some progressionist or liberal had spoken at a conference or a peaceful protest?
The door opened and even before being invited, he hurried inside, happy to be out of the cold rain. He used his hands to dry away the lingering drops on his face and quickly cleaned his glasses. Behind him the door was getting closed and the heat from inside started warming him up. Once his eyes were free from raindrops, he noticed that Hagrid looked like his beard had caught fire. Once side was slightly shorter and the few parts left were somewhat dark even if Hagrid’s hair was already black.
Quickly his wand was back in his hand where it belonged, and he rose to his feet. His tiredness disappeared as dew under the sun, as his heart prepared him for battle. Even after Voldemort had been vanquished, death eaters and supporters were still out there, waiting for him at some point. Most of the time they remained hidden, knowing their lord was partly mold now, but sometimes a few of them would resurface and try to get back at him.
Oh, the name itself sent ice through his veins, but he kept up the appearance and clapped lightly, as he did not wish to draw attention. On the way back to the gathered students, Malfoy came closer to him than he had been since the breakup, passing him slowly they suddenly got eye contact.
“I’m guessing you miss… Australia?” ‘Nice going Potter’ Harry would have kicked himself in the head if he was able to.
In the seventh year’s dorm, the chaos was slightly more subtle. Harry had already changed into his dressrobes and were sitting in front of the mirror, trying to comb his crowsnest into something slightly tame. Seamus, Ron and Neville were only halfdressed as well and for some reason, Ron couldn’t find his only pair of black socks that didn’t have a hole in them.
“Merlin, we have to tell our parents.” Dragging a hand through his hair, he prepared himself for a scolding of a lifetime.
“My boy, I understand that the past can be a painful memory, but this is the time to make new ones. Every time a painful memory stores up, it only means it can be replaced by a happier one.”
Taken a smaller path to the right, Harry from side to side, hoping to see an interesting shop. This smaller street was less crowded than the main one. While Hogsmeade seemed tiny from the outside, magic had been induced into the village and smaller paths and routes could be taken around the main street. The shops had extended since Hogwarts became a regular client with over six visits a year. Therefore, many had sought out the idea of selling their nips and faction work.
“I know.” He mumbled. “I realize you must have been mad at me, and I actually didn’t want to face you. I’m sorry. It was cowardly done.”
loud crash and Jason Melck from Slytherin had practically tackled Malfoy to the ground. They ruined several pots and plants in the fall and Malfoy hit his head I think, because he was unconscious when- hey wait!”
Nodding, Blaise gratefully changed the subject. “I’ve got my speech ready and those horrible rings they picked out, so don’t worry about that.” Showing him his inner pocket lining along the chest.
Suddenly Potter practically jumped up from his seat and ran out the hall. He didn’t look upset, in fact quite the opposite. Draco wondered where on earth, the boy could be heading for so early in the morning.
The pretty dark-skinned girl looked up from the board in her hands. “Of course, Mr. Weasley, they are in the back room. I’ll go get them.” she tight skirt she wore flared slightly as she turned. “Hello, Harry.” She winked. He simply gave the older woman a shy wave back.
Harry hadn’t even come to realize that Jason only lived with one parent because they hadn’t been together. If Jason didn’t know his mother…
The first time Harry released a gasp of air, Draco pulled back and leaned against him. They kept their arms around each other as their breaths returned to normal.  “I feel I should apologies for the way I acted last time we spoke. And I do, feel sorry, you know.”  Well, it wasn’t the best apology Harry had ever gotten, but they were together and right now his head wasn’t really in control.
“-Is not a present!” Snape interrupted angrily. Harry feared for a second that Jason had overstepped his boundaries. Remus and he remained silent as the two very different Snapes’ discussed. A staring content began as the two tried to stare each other down. To Harry’s great surprise, Professor Snape was the one to back down, as he swiftly rose and exited the room, muttering something alike;
“Oh please, Potter, I barely care enough in the first place.” Blaise smirked. Even though it clearly was an insult, Harry was only amused.
“Yeah.” While it was difficult, Jason was able to lift a hand and caressed the dark one lying on his bed covers. “Well… I’m still disappointed and I really want to be angrier than I am, but nothing is worth this kind of pain. Even if you hurt me, I can’t live without you.”
“Remember, Severus-“ Knott looked both serious and  little envious as he spoke. “This may be your one chance. Do not waste it by showing our lord you can’t keep whatever he wrote between you.”
All right, he was wrong. Potter was without a doubt the most infuriating little bastard he had ever encountered. With as much willpower as he had ever presented, Draco didn’t raise to the bait and just continued to write notes.
“I think you mean pure breed.” Laughing, Harry flew around the couch as Draco’s fingers latched out after him.
Opening the tiny present, Harry was careful as he felt glass. In his hand was a small flask and Harry could recognize it the second he saw the color of the potion inside. The melted golden color was unmistakable.
“Harry, I’m really sorry about everything lately.” She pulled back to dry her cheeks. “I hate being caught of guard, but that is no excuse. I handled the situation horribly and shouldn’t have lashed out at you or Malfoy for that matter.”
“Yes, indeed.” Severus poured himself another glass, only doing so, because it was still considered alcohol despite the awful taste. “We must regard the subject of your behavior around school.”
Remaining at the top of the stairs, Harry discreetly peered around the hall, searching for a blond head of hair. At last he noticed the teen, standing with his back turned, already drinking what Harry assumed was champagne. He stood amongst his friends, chattering. Beside him, Pansy was twirling her hair around a finger, restlessly. Theodore looked rather calm, while the two oggers seemed rather out of sort as they pulled on their tight robes.
“I know, but I have to see Hagrid anyway.” He smiled and left the group of confused Gryffindors behind. At this time, they should all have been heading for Care of Magical Creatures but the bad weather – including the occasional thunder - had affected the plan of starting a big fire to study Fire Salamanders. Instead of feeling down because of the weather, Harry took advantage of the time to gather the last present that he needed for Christmas. Inside his schoolbag he had hidden a big vial and one of the metal cutters they used for difficult plants in Herbology.
Thankfully, as Harry became out of breath, it slowed down. Ending on a lone cliff painting it settled to watch him, rocking its head gently from side to side. Rising one arm, he carefully touched the painted horse and swore he could feel the creature move beneath his hand. Suddenly the unicorn moved and ran out of the frame again. Harry barely had time to wonder what could possibly have frightened it when a shadow appeared on the wall in front. Reaching for his wand, he registered a hand dragging him off. Almost slipping Harry hurried to follow the force.
The ordinary red ball turned a rather beautiful blue coloured star, too pointy to have been blown glass.
“Nasty business, Mr. Potter. It always is in these cases…” Madam Pomphrey whispered. “Haven’t been part of one since my internship…”
“Yeah, okay.” Harry slowly got under the covers as well. Whispering goodnight to each other, the boys were quiet. Harry couldn’t hear if Jason had fallen asleep but he himself spent a long time staring up at the ceiling of silver, wondering if Blaise had any idea how deeply the boy depended on him.
Not even when his grandfather – the only family who had truly cared for him – died right before him.
The sentence almost commenced such an enormous amount of doubt in Harry, that he almost stopped walking again. He had never measured the amount of talking and pushing of the idea that had been forced upon him. The constant mentioning of his father as an auror, the important work the order did, being around Kingsley and Tonks… while Malfoy Sr. had simply placed his own opinion on to his son, Harry had been surrounded by people’s constant presence and expectations.
“I am sorry…” Blaise couldn’t imagine Jason giving up on him. “I am!” Blaise almost fell forward as he crashed into the teen. Desperate hands clawed the strong muscled back as he buried his face into the warm neck. “I should have told you.” Crying now, Blaise kissed him. Planting butterfly kisses all over his neck and jaw, desperate for any signs of forgiveness.
“As his replacement I would like to welcome our newest teacher. One whom some of you have had the pleasure of having a few years ago. Please help me welcome our new Defense Against the Dark Arts Professor, Mr. Remus Lupin.”
Snape looked as he always did. Decisive and emotionless. He took a single look at Harry and demanded the boys to leave. The four tired boys looked ready to protest, but Snape barely had to send them a glare before they ushered each other out. Alone, Harry tried to look anywhere beside Snape. He had wished to speak to him, but now, it seemed almost silly to have brought the Professor out of bed just to chat. It could have waited until tomorrow. A fact, he was most certain Snape was fully aware of.
The Slytherin didn’t look very worried but Harry noticed him clenching his jaw. Trying to pass it off, Malfoy just smirked.
“Keep a close eye on Mr. Malfoy, my boy. I believe it’s rather wonderful news… for house unity, of course.” He gave a croak chuckle before leaving Harry.
“Thanks. But truly, I’m fine now. You know, You can either move on or stay behind in the memories. Dumbledore has shown me it’s best to move on and build new ones.” Harry smiled.
For a long time neither men said anything. Jason looked to the ground but Severus knew he had been heard. The boy clenched his fist for a moment before letting go, his shoulder slumping down.
“Yeah he saw you first, I guess.” Hagrid looked slightly disappointed but was obviously relieved the dragon had made it.  As Harry finally got the dragon to keep his claws in his clothes, it ringed its neck trying to mark itself against his neck and cheeks. The yellow eyes paused at his, as Harry gently moved his hands across the warm scales. A calming, almost sad noise escaped the dragon and Harry could feel its small moving chest and a strong heart pumping beneath it.
“Nhn!” Harry couldn’t hold back anymore. His erection shook and come was painted across both their stomachs. It was incredibly erotic to watch their stomachs as they pushed against one another. Harry loved knowing that all those pants and gasps was because of him. It was a completely different type of warmth spreading inside his stomach. But no matter how much he loved it, his body was getting tired now. He was already beginning to feel the burn of his used body.
Of the embarrassing few times Severus had actually had sex, this scenario was furthest away from any of them. They had been quick, rushed or needy. This? Seemed to be so much more.
“Merlin… Harry, please, love, just- I didn’t know-“ Obviously thrown off guard, Harry interrupted him. His voice was almost hysterical as he yelled;
“Your father told you…” He left off, not certain how to even begin such an emotional and difficult conversation.
“And perhaps a wonderful night.” Harry didn’t know what came over him, but the loving silver eyes, suddenly turning hungry was worth it. Leaning over him slightly, Draco leaned in to whisper;
“Students and teachers,” he addressed. “A wonderful first half of the year at Hogwarts, has gone by. As exciting and eventful this has been, let us wish for an even bigger surprise in the next.”
“How did y-“ Harry shook his head in wonderment. When would he learn to simply trust the blonde girl. She might be a bit off her rocks but for most of the times, she was a truly astounding witch. Deciding to ignore how she knew him so well, he shook his head.
“Jason?” Right then, Harry’s heart began to clench as well. Of course, breaking up would really suck. Anyone would be upset and he could barely comprehend how much Jason loved the dark-eyed boy but surely nothing else what happen besides having to leave each other?
“Oh. Oh, okay.” Gobsmacked, the olive-skinned boy leaned back in his chair. Eyes gazed far as Blaise tried to comprehend the entirety of their relationship with re-knewed information. “So… That is why we…?”
Draco gave a groan and Harry got goosebumps at the sound. He gently pulled Draco’s waist even closer and as soon as Draco realized what he wanted, he pushed his hips right into his most private parts. The incredible feelings of fire and electricity exploded behind his eyelids and he leaned forward to rest his head against the strong shoulder. The captured hardness behind his trousers matched Draco’s perfectly. They were lined up as Draco pulled back slightly, before once again pushed against him.
“To new friends- and relationships. In the darkest of night and the brightest of day, may they continue to blossom.” Blaise seemed to mellow at the beautiful words and shared a rare smile with his friends as they cheered and clinked glasses with their neighbors.
Zabini looked up and for a long time to pounder if Harry had any intensions with the newly established proposal. After what felt like an hour, he finally exhaled hard and answered as he turned back to his book.
“Wish me luck.” Jason tried to smile as he passed Hermione. The door closed and the group quickly tried to gather whatever information they could from Hermione.
“This!” He grabbed an old newspaper showing Draco the front page where he smiled along with his family and friends. “Bachelor Malfoy to be wed!” he threw the paper and hit Draco in the chest. “You had perfectly moved on while I was still in the darkness! Do you have any idea how I might have felt seeing your flashy perfect life in the paper?!” he sobbed angrily.
Turning back, he noticed Lauris coming around the counter. And before he could even start to appreciate the beautiful form even in uniform, Lauris had leaned up and kissed him. Surprised by the notion, he dropped the bag to the floor, hearing the crunched paper land. His hands immediately went to the flawless curly hair, finally after weeks of wondering and felt it between his fingers. It shouldn’t be possibly for hair to be this soft nor this glossy. The lips pressed against his matched the hair perfectly. Fuller than Severus’ own thin, they went slightly over the top. He used the hands to press him harder against him and as their stomachs met, Lauris let out a suggestive deep moan.
“No, Malfoy.” Harry raised his eyebrows at him and looked him straight in the eyes. “I don’t need you to buy me anything. I’m not buying because there is nothing interesting, okay?”
“I know who you are. Or who you were.” Jason mumbled. “I had barely been here one day before the others told me. They told me how you had been a double-crossed spy. Had helped Dumbledore but for years before that you had taken the mark. You willingly followed him, believing his pureblood nonsense, thinking all creatures were beneath you, of course
The horrible smell of pure alcohol reached his nostrils and he laughingly threw it back at the owner.
Snape stood up straight and intimidating as he waited for the last students to sit down. Finally, he waved his wand and chalked words began to appear on the blackboard.
The professor had never looked away from Harry during his monolog of rambling and questions. After waiting for a few seconds to see if Harry had anymore to add, he looked speculating out the window. A deafening silence stretched out and Harry wasn’t sure were to look anymore. It seemed awkward to continue staring at Professor Snape as he was looking elsewhere. Looking at the tiny black heater in the middle of their room Harry stared at the tiny flame dancing.
“Harry, I’m sorry. I’m so sorry for hurting you, lying to you for so long. I won’t be lying again and tell you I didn’t know what I was doing, because I did. And the first few months I didn’t care, but it truly changed. I don’t know exactly when, but it did.”
For a long time, they were both stuck in their own minds, contemplating what to do. Jason was still sleeping lifelessly, only his tiny shallow breathing made him seem alive. But Harry couldn’t let him die like this. Even if that stubborn git Zabini refused, Harry would kick his ass and drag him back up the stairs. Deciding that action was the best way to restore what could be saved, Harry determined rose.
“Everything will be explained soon enough. For now, I think you could use some help with this game.” Smiling teasingly, the older man pulled out his bent wand, flicking it in a complicated pattern. The second he began, the students could only watch with their jaws dropped as the snow around them began folding like clay. Tall walls, triangle buildings, staircases, tunnels underground and icy patches formed itself, creating a giant battlefield. Two giant piles of perfect snowballs were laid out on each side of the field.
But Ron had a quite different reaction than he had expected. Instead of marching towards them and start yelling, the red-faced teen turned to search the crowd of students. Most of them in front had heard the Gryffindor’s outburst and quickly separated as Ron stepped in between them. In fact, it reminded Harry of how Moses crossed the Red Sea.
Choosing a subject proved to be harder than expected. Not because there were limited options, oh no, in fact it was completely the opposite. Jason had so many ideas and insight that their assignment could take. Harry realized rather quickly that Jason had an easy time remembering History. He explained it usually glued to his brain the first time he heard a story, because it just felt like a long fairytale to him. Jason had finally giving up, trying to ask for Harry’s opinion. He had tried to explain to him the concept of the essay they would be doing for almost ten minutes before realizing Harry didn’t really care what they wrote about. Harry had let Jason take charge of the assignment, since his own grades in history were… less satisfying.
Suddenly Harry realized Snape looked rather uncomfortable. His fist and jaw looked terrible clenched and he was looking out the window as if something outside was disturbing him. Harry wondered if it had really bothered him so much to talk about his parents. Perhaps he should leave it alone for now and someday discuss this new information with Remus.
Late one night the pair was walking back to the Gryffindor tower – only a few minutes till curfew – after spending a half hour in the broomcloset. Granger had actually included him in the discussion for tonight, which was why the study session had gone quicker than usual. Topic: their career.
Realizing he wasn’t much help for now, Harry shifted his bored glance over the class. Most of the students sat concentrated and discussed their chosen topic while others, like him, decided on a small break by looking out the window.
Down in the great hall he found his friends eating away happily. Seamus noticed him as the first and he quickly swallowed and yelled;
“Mr. Zabini. I see you still haven’t left his side.” The headmaster calmly stood on the other side of the bed. Both he and the bird looked serenely at the sick teen.
Instead of answering, Harry removed his hand from the broad shoulder and to Draco’s confusion, loosened his tie. As he was able to reach underneath his shirt, he took out the pendant hanging around his neck. Draco gave him a sincere smile as gently turned the pendant over between his fingers.
Harry ran away before the boy could see him. Almost running straight into Hermione around the corner he quickly hit her and she huffed in mock anger before leaving the field.
Just as he was about to give up on the small street, a scratched old red sign, caught his eye. The ink from the scribbling was almost completely gone and Harry had to walk very close before he was able to read it.
“Are you okay?” Jason asked with a mouthful of bloodpoppers. Nodding and smiling tightly, they both got ready for Christmas breakfast and lazily sauntered towards the great hall. As always, the great hall was beautifully decorated with tinsel, giant Christmas trees, candles and ribbons everywhere.
“Alright, if everyone is done eating-“ Jason lifted his glass. “I would like to propose a toast.” The surrounding students matched his move.
There was probably nothing that could have prepared him for the lovely reception in the great hall the next morning. At first nothing had seemed changed. Neville waking up first of the five boys. Dean going to wake up Seamus with a kiss. Ron trying to stay in bed as long as possible. Everything was as it used to be. Except the awkward second, he and Ron’s eyes met. Harry quickly looked away. He wasn’t ready to be talking to either of them right now. Gathering his shoulder bag, he and the guys headed out for breakfast.
Oh god, by any indication of the heat on Severus face, he was, after who knew how many years; blushing. Glancing at the golden framed mirror and the right, he could see the tinted patches on his hollow cheeks. Quickly he handed the man the right amount of currency, grabbed the bag and left without another word. The hot air outside did nothing to spare his cheeks of the humiliating yet disgustingly warm feeling in his body from spreading.
Being completely caught unaware, he glanced at the Slytherin to see what he wanted. The snake looked rather amused and pointed a finger towards his hands.
Draco just ignored him. He couldn’t lose. Not only was the idea absurd, but none the less it was his future that depended on it. Supposedly, he could remember to be a bit more… humble.
“Yeah. Sounds fun.” Harry couldn’t keep the smile of his lips. He literally felt… giddy. No one said anything as the two boys just stared at each other, smiling. Harry felt himself almost pulled closer to Malfoy by invisible force and leaned in.
Harry too, gave his thanks as a young girl took his wet cloak, hoping sincerely she didn’t touch his snotty dripping sleeves.
“Ah!” Gasping and bucking wildly, Blaise came for him. The dark haired teen bucked up a few times ridding out the pleasure as Jason swallowed deeply around him, refusing to let any part of his mate go to waste. As Blaise came down from the euphoria, he relaxed and completely let go of himself. Cleaning him gently so as not to hurt his oversensitive cock afterwards, Jason tucked him back into his underwear and pulled up the pants as far as he could without moving him. The only sound to be heard around them, were they breathless deep gasps from Blaise. Looking at the tired lusty eyes and the sweat that had gathered on his face, Jason leaned up to kiss him. The smaller boy lazily kissed back.
The olive-skinned man almost laughed himself to tears as Severus practically coked on the strong drink and announced it ‘too damn bubbly’. He asked for a water, while his date drank the rest of his. Severus completely forgot the time as they sat outside and watched people walk by. He felt such at ease around Lauris. The laughter and positivity wasn’t a mood he was used to around dinnertime. They had to pay inside and Lauris insisted on paying since he was the one whom asked him out. As they waited for the waiter to bring back their change, Lauris suddenly grabbed his hand and got a rather desirous look on his face.
“No matter, Mr. Potter, I will advise you not to accept any kind of consumption from others tonight.”
Okay… he still had Harry, dislike or not, they were dating and if he had feelings for Harry then maybe he could use it to his advantage. He wanted his freedom, therefore; sleeping with Harry wouldn’t necessarily mean having to stop seeing him. He could still win the bet, get rid of Pansy and keep the wonder boy, afterwards! The boy didn’t have to hear about the bet at any point. Beside it didn’t
The blond just shook his head and Zabini smirked before walking away with Jason, following him like a puppy.
The man seemed very uncomfortable, hearing the need in Harry’s voice. “Actually, I’m only heading back to gather the rest of my stuff.”
“It’s a little party tricks for adults.” He smiled. “You turn it on and it float around in between people and show off their aura when you look at a certain person. Like lust, happiness, drunkness-“
Draco possibly looked sick, but he managed to nod. “If… if it means we can still be friends then yes.”
The second their lips met, it was as if two puzzle pieces had finally connected after far too long. Too long, where no one had believed the two pieces could possibly have matched. Malfoy’s lips were warmer than his, and perhaps a bit softer too, but the kiss itself was desperate. Malfoy smashed his lips against his, possibly trying to fill whatever part of them that were still not touching. Grabbing the first thing he came in contact with, which turned out to be Malfoy’s shoulder, he desperately hung on, practically clawed him as he tried to make their bodies meet.
As the group secured the cage and went back to their brooms, Hagrid loudly sobbed;  “Remember to give him some Breglin Worms... It’s his favorite!”
A painful surge rushed through him at the thought of Lupin working here again. The idea of once again, sharing his only known home with the wolf felt as tormenting now as it had done years ago.
“Headmaster Dumbledore.” The dragonologists started introducing themselves to the professors and the headmaster, but Harry didn’t really bother to listen. He continued stroking the soft scaly head as he gently spoke.
To hell with seeming collected. Harry honestly didn’t care how needy he sounded or looked. He moved his hips in harsh motion, hoping the fingers would go even deeper if he tried hard enough. This display of pleasure obviously pleased Draco as Harry could clearly hear how his breathing speed up.
Quickly letting go, Harry was almost more disappointed than embarrassed. This was the second time they had kissed and both times they had been cut off. The older matron at the end of his bed did not look amused.
The entire hall erupted in cheers as the students hurried everywhere. Some immediately ran to their families, others hugged eachother and Harry had to deal with a lot of crying girls as they tearfully said goodbye.
“Please, no. Homosexuality is quite common these days and there is actually a lot of species whom does it as well. Penguins for one. They are weird little fellars, swimming birds instead of flying…”
After eating so much dinner and squeezing down a bowl of chocolate mousse, the Gryffindor friends headed upstairs. On the way out from the Great Hall, they ran into Draco and his friends. Draco smiled at him as their eyes meet, but Harry felt the smile was forced. About to ask him what was wrong, he was silenced with a passionate kiss. The tingly feeling bubbling up through his stomach and heart stumped him from asking any sort of question before the Slytherins had left out front.
Harry smiled and nodded. The rest of the way to the gate, Harry walked in silence, listening to his friends chat about Christmas, present and the party. They were some of the last students at the meeting place and even though they were at least thirty students, Harry had no problem in locating his boyfriend who was standing a few rows ahead. Sinistra quickly looked at her watch, before reminding everyone of the same rules that applied every time they went to Hogsmeade, before she began to walk in front.
Draco and Jason both almost choked on their drinks to keep from laughing at the horrified expression on Blaise’s face. Harry knew how embarrassed Blaise must have felt and bit his lip from chuckling, hoping to seem like he hadn’t even heard what Luna said.
“Yeah, my father looks like he ate a lemon every time Professor Lupin is mentioned.”  Harry felt his eyes on him and he must have looked contemplating because Jason wondered why he asked.
As dinner began, Harry thankfully got his appetite back and dug into a big piece of shepherd’s pie. Looking up into the sky ceiling, he couldn’t help but notice how dark it was already. Winter was coming sooner than he realized. Even though it hadn’t even been Halloween yet, he pondered where to spent Christmas this year.
“Is there anything you would like to tell me?” Snape had by now, turned his own back to him and was getting ready for the next class, fiddling with his notes. Draco wasn’t certain what he expected of him. If it wasn’t concerning Potter, then what did he wish to discuss?
For the rest of the long trip the boys discussed their upcoming last year at Hogwarts. Now that Voldemort was gone for good, maybe this year, Harry would be able to focus on his studies and slowly getting through the grief of his godfather’s death. At some point, Hermione and Ron joined them, and since Hermione had been to France with her parents this summer -once again- she could mostly lead the conversation.
Nodding, the witch led them to the section of gloves lined up against the back wall. Most of the gloves was in leather and brown, while few could be found in metallic or dark red. The sales lady found a couple of pairs that Malfoy tried on, while Harry continued to look through the store. Once in a while, he could hear the blond complaining or sniff at a shown pair. Harry was watching a display on the difference between older broom polish and a new, when Malfoy called for him.
“Fine.” Snape was too pale even for his own standards and Harry concern must have shown as the head of house reassured him.
“DON’T! just don’t, okay?” Jason’s warm breath fluttered across his face like wildfire burning its way across his cheeks. He sounded so angry yet defeated. “This has nothing to do with Malfoy. That posh brat is always the way I imagined him. Selfish! Couldn’t ever have given less of a crap about anyone who couldn’t give him money or power. But
“Perhaps we can curse some of the snowballs to go after anyone whom moves?” Neville suggested uncertainly.
“Yes, we used to spend Christmas with James and Lily, sometimes even with James’ parents. When they had to go into hiding with you, we were devastated but obviously understanding of their choice. But that Christmas we decided to spend it together and I’m grateful we did. It was the last time we were all together.”
“Right.” The bushy girl blushed slightly at the mention of their little conversation that had taken place earlier this month. Trying to deny the obvious awkwardness between his best friend and him, Harry turned to Neville and asked him about holiday plans.
“Please, it is hardly fair for me to pass judgment on others when it comes to keeping up appearances as a teacher.”
Harry left the room with the two other teens, taking a quick glance and a brush against his shoulder as he passed Malfoy. He felt like he should be waiting for Malfoy to join them again, so he went to sit down in the same chair as before.
Jason didn’t answer him but finally, the contact between them was broken and Blaise stood and watched him leave.
“You look beautiful.” Draco glanced at his own sweater covering Harry’s body. It was slightly too big and the sleeves were falling down over his wrist. Smiling at the complement, he leaned up and kissed Draco one final time, firm and tender.
While the décor from fourth year was truly amazing, Hermione had told them that this year would be astonishing. Harry couldn’t wait for all the classes to be over. Draco had smiled at him at breakfast and it had given him butterflies, thinking about them dancing together tonight. Harry had admitted to himself that he was in love with the Slytherin. After everything they had been through and with the astounding change, he had seen in Draco, it was only a matter of time before he would blurt it out. He wasn’t entirely sure if Draco was in the same place as him but it didn’t really matter, right? He would hopefully come to it at some point.
A gentle cough separated the arguing pair and they turned to listen to their headmaster. “I believe it will be in everyone’s best interest – including… Aodhan’s – if we settle this in a calming manner back at my office. Severus, Minerva, have you both left your classes with a prefect?”
Saying nothing, Harry simply took in the shocking sight. Right there in his doorway stood the man he loved but whom he hadn’t seen in months. Even with dripping wet hair and tired eyes, Draco still looked as gorgeous as Harry remembered him. Finally tearing away his eyes from the haunting grey ones, he noticed the dripping suit Draco was wearing.
Although he wasn’t afraid of anything Lupin could do - he was after all much more powerful – he had learned to trust his gut, and right now, a nagging feeling wore on his stomach, telling him he should be prepared for something big.
Well that didn’t answer his question, but Harry was too tired and intimidated to argue with the professor.
While Snape was intelligent enough to realize why Mr. Melck had come to see him, his brain reacted as though in slow-motion. Turning back, he watched the scared teen still sitting at the couch, looking younger than he ever had. Scared of the rejection, as he himself was scared of the truth.
For a while the blond boy sat with his head in his hands, wondering what would happen. Wait, he almost jumped up. This didn’t really change anything. He only had to go out with Potter as long as his parents thought he wanted too. When he won the bet, Pansy would tell her parents
“But now for both good and some sad news. From next semester we will unfortunately have to say goodbye to Professor Bjorkfire, whom we have had the pleasure of being taught for a few months but he has decided to retire early and that is something we all – especially the older ones like me –accept and support.”
“I can see the confusion on your face. Yes, Mr. Potter, whilst the headmaster has asked me to, I disagree. I did not find myself ever caring for your godfather-“
Unfortunately, the spider seemed smart enough to realize his move and quickly moved its giant legs to the side. The second the spell had missed, it jump after him. Running behind the tree trunk, he once again tried the exploding charm, hoping it would hit something close to the giant creep. The spider, landing on the piece of wood, didn’t see the second charm fast enough and screeched with pain as one of the legs were blown to ashes.
It was the day before the Christmas dance and life around Hogwarts was ecstatic. Everyone seemed excited and Harry couldn’t help but feel the horrifying nostalgic moment when he watched girls move around in larger groups, giggling at any boy they saw. Harry was so grateful he didn’t have to worry about finding a date this time. Why on earth had he waited this long to find out he was gay? Dating a man was so much easier than finding a girl. All those confusing signals and mindgames… Merlin, he was glad that was all over with.
“Merlin sake!” the soft hands and sharp nail dug into his coated arm and Jason was certain it would have hurt if he weren’t slightly stronger now. He could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him but chose to ignore the spoiled brat.
Laughing Harry nodded before finding his friends sitting near the middle of the great hall. Hermione who’s face was stuck in a book, looked up at the sound of his laughter. Looking to the side of his head, Harry was sure she had seen Jason walk away from them.
Trying to gather whatever evidence he had and turn it around, was past him. If Potter had told him everything, there was only an apology left to convince the only man he had ever cared for that it wasn’t as simple as that. While he hadn’t exactly stopped Draco, he certainly hadn’t encouraged it either.
Remus looked intensely at him for a second. “Harry, I am a werewolf. We only bite people for two reason. To kill and…”
As his friend was busy laughing, Harry hurried to turn the ball into another shape, this time focusing on an angel.
Malfoy and he held hands the entire time, while they were talking. It turned out they had more than enough to discuss, so much they needed to learn about each other. When they arrived at the small crocket stone bridge, they were in a lively tale of how Harry actually managed to beat the troll in first year.
Glad that Remus brought him up, Harry shook his head. “No, he went back to his quarters, but he didn’t seem so good.”
“Do not cry for me, my friend.” Jason smiled tiredly. Harry couldn’t help but notice how much older and wiser the boy his own age, sounded. He tried and gave an awkward smile as he wiped away his own tears.
and he could break it off with Potter. He would be free of them both. Or, at least until his parents found another match, which could take a few years, waiting for the right girl to be introduced or turning seventeen.
Opening it, Snape was surprised to see Mr. Melck standing at his doorstep. Stepping aside he nodded for the young man to enter. Normally he would never have allowed a student to just wonder into his private quarters but Mr. Melck had already been there plenty of times now as it seemed too dangerous to let him have his fill of blood in his classroom where any student might feel the need to stop by.
Snape, whom was drinking something strong out of a crystal glass, wasn’t able to mask his surprise before he had clenched his jaw as Remus walked in.
His friend sat there, seemingly in incomprehension. “Okay Harry, I know you are hurting but Blaise wouldn’t be part of this. He wouldn’t lie to me.”
They took a big step forward in their relationship and I hope it was both romantic and hot for you readers.
As the other boys slowly turned in and the light went out, Harry still lay awake, thinking of the rather weird day. For the love of Godric, he couldn’t understand why Malfoy had been acting so weird. Then again, when had Harry ever understood what went through that guy’s head? Sending a silent prayer to Sirius, where ever he was, Harry finally went to sleep.
“Was that actually a compliment from THE Draco Malfoy?” Harry teased and raised his eyebrows dramatically high. Malfoy snorted.
Nodded with a full mouth of butterbeer, he elaborated; “Yes, I’m only missing one but I can get that at Hogwarts.” At Neville’s slightly worried look, he quickly explained he wasn’t planning on stealing anything, but it was more of a homemade gift. Believing him, the two friends turned back to the flourishing conversation.
Ron had clearly seen the two boys talking and assumed the worst, as the temperamental redhead always did. Before things got out of hand, Harry sent an exasperated look in Hermione’s direction and thankfully, the headstrong girl picked it up instantly. She hurried and tucked her hand into Ron’s and asked him to come along.
This was not good. If Snape got a whiff of their plan, he would do whatever it took to keep him away from Potter. For some reason Draco had never understood, Snape hated the golden boy more than anyone and at the same time kept him protected. He would have to think of something and fast. Why was he kissing Potter? Why indeed…
“Let’s go.” Draco led them back to their table where they had now been joined by Blaise and Jason. Jason did indeed seem to have a nice time chatting with Seamus and Dean, but Blaise did nothing to disguise his disapproval of their seating arrangement.
“I’m really sorry.” Harry placed a hand on the warm broad shoulder of his friend. “But I know… your country miss you a whole lot right now and I’m sure he would want you to celebrate.”
Sighing the boy went closer to the heating flames. Close enough he bent over faintly to see the content. Trying to keep from sounding shocked, he turned back to where Hagrid was steaming two giant cups of tea.
He refused to look at her after she clearly didn’t believe it was necessary to keep her voice down. Instead, he continued to write his notes, however limited they were.
“So, Mr. Potter, do I have to guess why you have decided to join me on my only free day off in the week?”
“We only wanted to say ‘hello’ and deliver you and Jason some presents.” He tried not to seem too desperate as he looked towards Jason for help.
“There is already some on the kettle. Take care.” Leaving, Hagrid slammed the door shut and the two teens were left to themselves.
The tense taller boy suddenly changed completely. Turning towards him, Jason sat up with a smile. Although the smile certainly wasn’t very convincing. He tousled Harry hair and asked him not to worry.
The blond must have felt watched because suddenly his steal grey eyes moved from his cock and locked onto Harry own. No, the lips were nothing compared to the raw lust he saw swarming through the eyes of his boyfriend. Only watching him, lying on the bed, ready to be fucked.
Seeing something platinum moving in the corner of his eye, Harry turned and saw Malfoy storming in. He was looking particularly annoyed and practically threw himself in his seat.
‘The nerve of the brat. Why did he have to be such a prudish golden boy? Was it simple impossible for him and his friends to unwind?’ Draco fumed. He tried to get the boiling heat in his chest under control as he watched Potter and the annoying mudblood, laughing. The poor excuse of a Slytherin should stay where he belonged, chasing after Blaise like a helpless puppy. Angrily, Draco tried to concentrate and write down a paragraph from the book, but the end of his quill broke under the pressure.
“I didn’t have to. You said enough.” Grabbing his colder hand in his own, the pair continued towards the tower. “By the way, please don’t mention anything to Ron. He still wants us to join the Aurors together.”
For another two sips they sat in silence. The harder Harry tried to scrub the tears away from his face, the more fell on his cheeks. It was so painful. How could you hate and love a person so much at the same time? Except he didn’t really hate him… which was even worse. How could you possibly love someone after what the blonde had done to him? Why wasn’t he angrier?
“Albus please, why have you come?” Severus patience had run out and he couldn’t stand the small talk any further.
“No, Lupin. There is not. What happened was a long time ago, it simply doesn’t matter now. Besides I have bigger things to worry about than you getting a job for a few months.” At these final words he boldly stormed off, feeling the heated glance from Lupin following him all the way to the gate. Trying to remain angry instead of letting other, very unwanted feelings take over, he focused on what he had told Lupin. Severus wasn’t lying when he had said, he had more important things to do. Such as educating his son and for once trying to keep him from getting into trouble.
“Whatever you may think of me, please know that, that night at the dance meant everything to me. I have never known it was possible to feel so connected to another human before and I felt so lucky it happened with you.”
Harry didn’t feel like telling his friends, but to be honest, he hadn’t really thought of Quidditch since last year when he had been kicked off the team. Thanks to that bitch; whom still had way too much power sitting on her throne next to that loser, Fudge. Perhaps it would be good for him to try out for the team and get some exercise. Right now though, it didn’t really feel so important to him.
“Oh.” Harry was unsure where to take the conversation from here. Christmas had become one of the greatest holidays in Harry life, well at least when he started at Hogwarts. Obviously seeing the other students return to their families once hurt a great deal, but now it was just another part of Christmas.
“Yes.” His father seemed very displeased. Gathering his cane, standing against the wall. He pointed it at Draco.
Relieving Snape of his discussion-duties he bid him goodnight and laid back down on his cloud soft pillow. Pulling the covers all the way up to his nose. Snape left him quietly and it didn’t take long for the four other boys to come back and go to bed. Harry didn’t even have time to apologies for all the commotion he had caused before he fell into a dreamless sleep.
The magical hotel room was indeed beautiful. Cherry flowers and white lilies were decorating the walls and vases, whilst a white tableclothed table was filled with small chocolates and chilled champagne. Both untouched.
Agreeing with him, didn’t really calm him down. Harry knew people like Draco could hold a grudge for god-knows-how-long. But refusing to overreact for the second time that day, he just gave a convincing smile to his friend and thanked him.
“It’s all about charm, my friend.” Seamus laughed cockily as they looked around the shop. Hermione looked suspiciously at new bottles of love potion, ‘New strength guarantied’.
As he blew a breath over his face, the heavy atmosphere was ruined when Blaise turned his face, chuckling.
Everyone’s eyes were now at the boy in the chair, whom still refused to look up from the floor. Knowing he would have to say something, he visible swallowed hard before answering;
“Maybe…” Harry didn’t really know how to answer that. It was true, he somehow seemed less excited than the others. Maybe it was because he didn’t have someone to go home too. But he never had to see the Dursleys again. That at least made him happy. Suddenly his eyes caught sight of a family of blondes and indeed the Malfoys were leaving the Hogwarts grounds with their son a few steps behind. He was looking around and Harry hated himself for hoping he was the one the blond boy was looking for.
As he munched on a piece of toast and some fruit, Draco observed the rest of the great hall. The hall was already filled with students, but it was incredible easy to pick out the boy who lived amongst them. The crow nest on his head was even more in disarray than usual, and it certainly didn’t help he kept scratching his head. Potter looked tired as well. He obviously tried to hide the fact that he was yawning, from his friends.
“Darling.” This was the first time since they had stepped out of the fireplace, Mrs. Malfoy had spoken. She quickly went across the room to kiss her son’s cheek, checking him over. Harry, whom still had his eyes set on Lucius, realized that even though he didn’t show the same concern as his wife, he showed true relief that his son was awake.
Hermione loved her boyfriend, so much was obvious, but at breakfast, it seemed she was determined to stare at her own plate through most of it.
Harry knew it would seem rude to disappear out of nowhere but the noise and rising heat from being stuffed in an overcrowded room became too much. He soon broke free and waving to Hermione and Ron as they stood with the Weasleys, Harry left through the door to freedom.
Seeing Harry crying was quite a shock for her. Hermione hadn’t really ever been present when Harry cried. Not without Mrs. Weasley or Remus present. For the first time she was the sole care whom would have to comfort him. Emotions weren’t the most practical subject and she had always been more comfortable around boys for that exact reason. They rarely showed too much beside anger or happiness. It was easier to deal with. Especially since her boyfriend had the same amount of emotions as a teaspoon. Hungry, happy or annoyed. There was no in-between. Reminding herself of the comfort she had gotten from her mother when she was a child, she laid a warm hand on the back of Harry’s neck and gently stroked it.
“Nothing.” Blaise shrugged with faked innocent. “I simply heard no one had asked him yet and apparently that was enough discouragement for him to stay away.”
Both smiling like lunatics they waited for their breath to return to normal. Looking into the silver eyes, Harry realized how close they were sitting. Their forehead shared the warmth of their bodies and their fingers were gently pulling them closer. Harry was painfully aware of how close Malfoy’s mouth was to his own. His warm breath spread across his cold lips and kept them from drying out.
“Professor!” Blaise loudly called, quickly drying his face for any evidence. Both Potter and Professor Snape ran in through the door, probably expecting the worst. But seeing the smile on his face must have reassured them, because Professor Snape seemed incredibly relieved. Well, as much as Snape had ever allowed himself to show emotion of any kind.
If Snape was truly concerned someone might try and poison him, it could only be some seriously troubling ingredients the stranger had gathered. Harry nodded in understanding and set aside his glass for good measure. Hoping to change the subject to something slightly less… deathly, Harry coughed.
“Come on.” Draco gentle took the book from his lap and threw it on top of the stake next to Blaise. Gathering Potter, he headed for their dorm room staircase. Potter didn’t question his decision but merely let Draco guide him.
As his glance moved across the student bodies, he glanced back to see how Malfoy was doing. Expecting to see the Slytherin indulged in the paper, he was pleasantly surprised to see him watching Zabini. From the front of the class, Harry couldn’t see what they were doing, but the tiny gesture of Malfoy’s hand on his friend’s arm, told him all he needed to know. Malfoy wasn’t perfect – far from it- but he was trying to change, and Harry was certainly going to help him if he wanted.
And the greatest part was he would never have the nightmare of telling his parents why he wouldn’t marry the witch that had been driving him crazy the last few months.
Remembering the big group behind him, Harry gently pulled back, hurrying to remove any tearstains of his face. He shallowed visibly and took a deep breath, smiling. As if realizing their private moment was over, the students behind them approached.
“In a way.” The girl tensed. “-Pansy, I want us to be friends again, but you have to understand, Potter is staying.”
Drawing back, Harry had completely forgotten about the professors. Letting go of Malfoy’s hand he sat back in the chair next to the bed.
Well the boys have a plan and it’s about to get some action! Should we expect everything to work out the way they intent it?
As Snape looked to his wristwatch – who knew he had one? – The tintinnabulation of a light bell called.
“Thank you.” Harry swung his arms around him in gratefulness. Draco awkwardly patted him on the back. He was still not completely used to getting hugged. The two boys stood embracing for another minute before pulling back.  “Thank you, Draco. Really.” Harry leaned up and gave ham a gentle kiss on the lips. When their lips disconnected Harry was still able to feel the warmth of it on his own.
“I see.” Smiling the older man asked him to walk him some of the way to his office. Harry quickly fell in rhythm with his steps as the headmaster walked slower than he. Harry also realized he was the same height as Dumbledore now. He would have liked to think he had grown but it was more likely Dumbledore who had started crouching in his older days.
It took a mere second before the room changed. The colors became lighter and cream-colored. As the walls and ceiling gained crown moldings and a golden chandelier, Harry was reminded of a historic French picture he had once seen on a classtrip to the museum. A vintage velvet green couch appeared and in front, a glass table with two glasses and a champagne bottle.
This morning Draco had sat down alone at the Slytherin table. Slowly chewing on the last mouthful of yogurt parfait, he considered last night’s event. Convincing Potter to join him had been easier than he had comprehended. Digging up the last blueberry from his bowl, he pushed it aside to think. Potter weren’t exactly a player or even very popular amongst the students so Draco wouldn’t really have much competition. Although he had no idea wither or not Potter had ever considered himself gay at all. But Draco was certain of the signs he had shown. Potter was attracted to him, that was for sure. Having never heard any kind of rumors of the golden boy being gay, Draco assumed he was still in the closet or at least just getting out. Potter was clearly new to boys-kissing-boys, so Draco would probably have to do the firsts of many. Such as inviting him on a date. He could barely contain a shiver of disgust at the idea.
“The Ringtailed Dragonfly.” She obviously didn’t think he needed more context than that, because she simply smiled at him with a dreamy glance and continued to walk beside him. “They are quite beautiful. They are some of the biggest flies that exist, which is why they are named after dragons. Another very big winged creature.”
Down the crypt hallway, a single set of footsteps sounded. Looking at his old watch it was still a bit early to arrive for the class, which was probably why it was just a single person. At last the person rounded the corner and to Harry’s undeniable luck, it was Malfoy.
Harry went a bit forward and caught the eyes of Remus whom was desperately trying to turn down Hagrid’s generous offer of mere mead in his golden cup. Hagrid had apparently had a few as his large face had gotten pretty flushed and his already booming voice had risen to another level. Nodding discreetly to the Professor, Harry left to gather his presents for tonight. Jason’s and his plan had to be put into action and they would need to be on their best behaviour if they should have any chance of getting the two adults in the same room. Remus wouldn’t be a problem, but Snape would definitely refuse to corporate without causing an uproar. Hopefully, Jason’s presence there and his wish to spend Christmas with his father would mellow the older man. At least for tonight.
“I believe the anger is related more to Snape than you.” Harry couldn’t help but chuckle as he watched Malfoy being dragged off with Fay Dunbar, positively the most Scottish girl they had in the school. The two boys walked towards a unicorn that had not been chosen yet. Moving carefully, Harry gently raised a hand for the animal to sniff him. Practically holding his breath as he felt the warm air on his hand, inhaling and exhaling, slowly.
Malfoy gave a curling smirk. “Not much to think about. I will work with my dad at a higher position in the Magical law department.”
For a long time, they mockingly argued about Harry’s true place in Hogwarts. Harry wasn’t sure how long they insulted and annoyed each other but at some point he gave up and basically attacked the snooty ass and kissed him.  Draco obviously hadn’t seen it coming and he grunted in slight pain as they fell against the stone cold wall. Gasping Harry held on to him as Draco pushed him the other way around. Standing in between the wall and Draco, he pushed his chest and stomach out, trying to get as much contact as possible. His mouth and airway was already on fire. Their tongues danced and stroked each other, while their hands explored.  In the end it wasn’t enough touching, Harry needed more. He slid his hands downward and tightened them around a perfectly shaped round globe in each.
Chuckling slightly the man leaned closer to look Severus straight in the eyes, his icy blue owns twinkling with booth sadness and warmth.
While Draco refused to see this as a selfless hero act on Potter’s part, a small warm feeling of surprise and gratitude spread across his chest. He snatched his hand away from the Gryffindor’s clutches and harry managed to look upset before Draco laid his hand upon his cheek.  He would have to convince Potter that everything was all right. If Potter continued to have doubts about their… ‘Relationship’ it would only take Draco so much longer to make him crumble.
As the two boys stood line, Jason couldn’t help but reach out and touch him every now and then. Tucking away a stray hair, giving his hand a tighter squeeze or carefully kissing him on the top of his head. After what felt like an hour, they were finally able to get inside. Blaise wandered around scanning the aisles as Jason gathered sweets here and there. At the counter Blaise placed three blocks of premium dark chocolate and before he had paid, Jason threw two packs of sour worms and a bag of bloodpops in. Rolling his eyes, Blaise paid for everything and left Jason to take the brown bag from the older lady behind the counter.
Michael chuckled and gave him two thumbs up, while Astoria sent him a completely escalated eye roll. He just gave her another blinding smile and sought out the smaller teen who held his heart in an ironclad fist. Blaise and his friends hadn’t truly started walking but were just changing poses while talking.
When Harry finally started the conversation again, it took almost twenty minutes for Blaise to regard any subject with an opinion beside the weather. Harry truly realized how intelligent the teen was. He took almost as many classes as Hermione with the exception of Muggle Studies. But Blaise could already pinpoint a few aspects of Jason and Harry’s chosen topic and he actually gave him good advice on which book – beside their usual – could help on the matter.
The three students walked in silence for the remaining way. The library had started filling out as the last class of the day had ended. Continuing further into the library they finally spotted the corner table in which Potter and Blaise had occupied. Both absorbed in their work, they didn’t even look up before the others were almost at the table. When they were just steps away, Potter heard them. Gaining eye contact with the golden boy, Draco tried to smile sincerely.
Thankfully, Lauris beat him to it. He gave a careful smile before leaning in to give him a warm yet gentle kiss. This kiss was different from the first they had shared. Not passionate or hard, nor excited, simply just a touch of two people. They didn’t prolong it or deepen it. Right there in the warm summer night, they embraced and simply touched each other.
“Parkinson?” Potter obviously hadn’t even noticed her. The girl simply chose to ignore him in favor of talking to Blaise.
Mr. Melck looked down at his feet whilst his fingers nervously removed invisible lint from his pants.
“I know, Harry told me.” He still refused to look at him and Blaise wasn’t used to fight for his attention. Normally he only had to walk into a room before the teen would be sucked to him like an octopus.
“Okay, we should let you get some sleep.” Hermione got up. Taking Ron by the hand, the two Gryffindors left the hospital wing. As Harry’s eyes followed their movement, he realized another person was lying in a bed further down the wing. He recognized the long brown hair and suddenly he remembered. The unicorn hadn’t only attacked him. She had actually been heading for Jason. Now seeing him again, Harry saw how badly she had injured him. Bandages were wrapped around his head multiple times and his left arm had scratches that were covered in a green paste. Beside him, very closely, Zabini was sitting silently. He was carefully stroking Jason’s other shoulder and arm. The olive-skinned boy looked rather tired and had a constant worrying look on his face.
“I-“ Harry stared into his cup as his sight once more became blurry. He felt so embarrassed crying in front of his professor but it goddamn hurt. Taking a shaking breath, he simply said yes.
Draco was happily getting in to it, not at all seeming embarrassed by the loud groans he emitted. After some time, Harry felt his jaw become slightly numb so he slowed down until he pulled off.
Shrugging, Harry just answered he was fighting with Draco, but it wasn’t something he was interested in discussing. Nodding understandingly, Hagrid changed the topic.
Neither boy said anything before Blaise was finished with the exposed chest and neck. Blaise was ready to begin on the cracked face, which still looked frightening. Unsure wither Jason would allow the contact, Blaise leaned the cloth forward towards him, waiting to see if Jason had any deviation. A slight nod was all he got. Truly studying the wounds now, Blaise could no longer keep quiet.
“It’s understandable. You couldn’t possibly understand unless you’ve tried it. You see… the reason for my sudden change wasn’t an emotional response to my father, it was fate. As I introduced myself to Blaise, I had absolutely no idea how my life was starting to change… the day I met Blaise, and I came back home I looked in a mirror and saw my eyes.” He emphasized by pulling his brown curls away from his eyes.
“Hey,” Harry bumped a shoulder against him. “I had to be quick, because a certain princess wasn’t in the mood to wait.”
“No offense Malfoy, but I most certainly do not need your opinion regarding my future career.” Potter retorted, turning his head to the window, clearly wanting to escape from the Slytherins’ staring.
Thankfully, Harry didn’t have the time to answer because multiple students chatter echoed down the hall towards the two boys. Malfoy got up gracefully and stood up against the opposite wall with a few feet between them. The hallway was soon filled with sixth-year students and no one seemed to find it suspicious that Malfoy and Harry had been the first to arrive.
“Oh, I hadn’t really thought of that…” A rather tiny ray of self-doubt and nervousness entered his stomach.
Smiling, Harry tried to plead the man. “Are you sure you couldn’t give it a try? I will pay handsomely. It’s just… it’s the only gift a can think of that he would actually like.”
Guilt was truly what Blaise felt right now. No, he wasn’t the one to trick potter but over the coarse of the year he had noticed how close his boyfriend and the golden boy had become. It had bothered him, but not ‘once’ had he imagined how it would affect anyone but himself. Having to go through all that trouble of playing nice with Potter… it had seemed like punishment enough. Never once had he imagined; realized it would bother Jason.
“Well, it happened rather quickly. You see Professor Bjorkfire and I had discussed his retirement at the end of last year, but at that time he was certain he could handle one more year. Unfortunately, his energy has decreased rapidly, and he simply cannot keep up. Therefor I suddenly had to find another teacher this late into the year. Thankfully, Remus had just finished his last mission and was ready to get back to teaching.”
Thank you to MorninCoffee, Harripotter, whateverr05, witchseeker1133 and Mery_Berry for the reviews! <3
“If you do it and is sincere, then yes, I will.” Harry tried to keep the butterflies from leaving his stomach.
“Potter, I want you to know I didn’t mean to upset you the other day… I just-“ Malfoy sighed. “This isn’t very easy for me. This whole change.”
Slowly wakening, he turned his head trying to fall asleep again. He kept his eyes closed but still he sensed it was in the middle of night. The room had turned slightly colder as the sunrays had left the room. About to tuck his arms under the covers a small hand touched his shoulder, shaking him. Drowsily he opened his eyes and had to blink to get used to the darkness. As his eyes adjusted, a small figure appeared beside his bed. It was hard to see but the neon colored clothes was hard to miss.
The tiny bird still flicked its petite wings. Harry recognized the origami bird instantly. He had gotten the same message bird back in third year. Barely turning around he could see the blonde head at the corner of his eye. Without opening the letter, he flicked his wand at it and whispered ‘Incendio’.
To others it must have appeared rather strange but for Harry it mattered greatly. One of his most important friends had accepted a person who was starting to become important, at least just a little bit. He knew this did not indicate they were about to be friends, not even close, but they would leave each other alone from now on, at least for Harry sake. Turning back the three companions watched the quiet redhead standing a few feet away.
No, this couldn’t be happening. Potter was simply a pawn in this chess of life. The Mercutio in his play. As soon as his usefulness had outlived its purpose, he would be disposed. Yes, Draco would have to keep focus on what was important.
Coughing slightly Blaise tried again. “Erhm, I don’t know if you heard but Potter and Draco have been having a fight I guess-“
They walked for a while in comfortable silence. Harry was waiting for Dumbledore to speak, since he had never once asked him to ‘just walk’ with him. Harry knew the headmaster had in his best interest; he just wasn’t so sure Dumbledore actually knew what was best for him anymore.
Harry had finally agreed to leave the books behind and have a date. Even though they couldn’t leave the castle, Draco simply wanted to talk to him alone and perhaps cob a field.
Jason smirked. “Not really. It’s complicated. Blaise is amazing and has so many qualities I admire, but a flaw he carries is the opinion of others that cost him. I know he cares for me in his own way but I am not always certain how deep those feelings go.”
And what a view. The light from the streets and the inner city was lighting up the otherwise dark water and the waves as they crashed in over the beach in calming patterns. The completely white beach had turned yellow under the lights but he and his date were hidden in the darkness by the stonewall they sat up against.
On the bedside table beside them, stood, not just a single, but almost a dozen different bottles of lube. Different sizes and colors, just ready to be opened.
Although this year had been rather quiet so far, as his parents had moved to France, staying at the summerhouse. In France, his father had better opportunities for restarting his business. While Draco never doubted his father revelation after the Dark Lord’s fall, his intention never sought further away than his money could carry him. His father had never hid the fact that it matter little, wither it was light or darkness he followed as long as his powerful position at the Ministry remained intact and his wallet was full.
“The warm-sensing charm won’t work when we are already colder than normal.” Draco disregarded his idea calmly. Once again, Harry mentally sent Draco a thank you kiss as he had kept from making fun of Neville in any way.
“I don’t believe for a second, you wouldn’t enjoy the chance to dance.” Harry smirked into his drink.
“I believe you, Mr. Melck.” Dumbledore carefully laid a hand on the sitting boy’s shoulder. For the first time since entering the office, Jason looked up at the Headmaster, probably wondering about his continuing fate at Hogwarts.
“It’s time.” Professor Snape declared as the group looked towards the night sky. Six wizards arrived on brooms with a giant metal cage attached in the middle between them. As they landed a few feet away, Aodhan grew weary. He started tiptoeing around as if not fully understanding why the strangers were here.  Five men and two women, all dressed in leather landed and dismounted their brooms.
“No, Okay? Just no.” The tall teen got up from his seat and almost laughed hysterically. “He wouldn’t do this. He may be a little rough sometimes, but we talk about everything, he knows we are friends. Dad, come on?” He stared at his father in hope of support. When he found none, the denying smile turned to despair.
Realization hit him as a train, and he smiled thankfully at his godfather. A real smile for what felt like the first time in months. Without another word he ran through the back door, smacking it against the wall. Running far enough from the venue, he whipped out his wand and Dissapparated from sight.
Behind him stood Severus Snape. His hollow cheeks and pale skin hadn’t gotten any better this summer, but Harry couldn’t imagine Snape being a sunbathing person anyway. The tall dark Professor didn’t seem to care for his response before turning on his black heels and strolling towards the door.
The second the word left his mouth, he thought he was screwed. The narrow pink lips on his classmate tightened even further as she obviously tried to keep her temper in check.
It was only do to his so many years of spying that Snape was able to mask his surprise and suspicion. The year ‘79 was both the greatest and worst part of his youth.
The emotions that overcame him was devastating. He barely heard Dumbledore tell them to leave and continued their day as if nothing had happened. Harry had to teach and Harry had lessons to get to. The pair of grieving friends left the office together.
Much earlier in the Slytherin’s commonroom, Draco slouched down on the couch after following Potter back. It hadn’t been as horrible as he had predicted, but god! How could Gryffindors be so gullible? It was a wonder they hadn’t become extinct. Better yet, how was it possible for Potter to give him the finger and only a few hours later act as though they were actually friends? Gullible beyond comprehension.
“Thank you, sir.” Their hands entwined in a strong hold for a mere second. “Perhaps I shall invite you over once I get my own place.”
“Easy. It’s just me.” Hermione sat down beside him. “Where were you last night? You never came back to the tower.”
Lost in thoughts, Harry realized he had been starring at the closed door for Merlin knows how long. Turning back, he noticed both of the boys had left the task of folding to watch for a reaction. Giving them a reassuring smile, he went back to folding.
“It doesn’t matter! You couldn’t have kept this between you two? Why the hell would you go to Hogsmeade?” Pansy had moved closer to him each second her voice got louder, until she stood so close, he could smell her perfume.
Getting eye contact with Potter as the rest of the class left for second period, he tried to give a discreet assuring smile. Potter seemed to believe it as he quickly left with the rest of the gryffindorks.
“And then I just landed on his neck, it was kind of like sitting on a horse. Except a horse probably wouldn’t look so stupid since it would actually know I was there.”
“Maybe I’m not the only one who should consider what they actually want.” Malfoy teased and smiled down at him.
“The second I saw it, accepted it, everything seemed to make sense. My body changing, my meeting with Blaise, my father’s possible pregnancy…”
“So instead of having a father and a mother, you had… another father here in the UK?” Harry inquired, trying his best to understand all this new information.
since the day I told you who I was! You never talk to me unless it’s about school or to point out how unhappy you are with me!”
“It still makes you look like a Mormon.” Dean said lying down on top of the mess that had gathered on his bed. Or the clothes Harry called ‘no-go’.
“Thanks.” He smiled gently at her in the mirror. Once again Harry was reminded how thankful he was to have the bright witch in his life.
“No, sorry sir,” Harry distracted himself by getting more comfortable in his seat. “I was simply wondering how you’ve been. It’s been a while since we have spoken, beside in class, of course.”
Closing the distance between them, Harry sobbed as he was captured. Feeling the wet, yet warmth arms around him, he clung to Draco, simply taking in the scent of the man he loved. Draco moved his arms around him, feeling his back, arms and neck. Simply familiarizing himself again with the body he thought he had lost. They cried silently together, before Draco pulled slightly away. Enough for him to stroke Harry cheeks and whisper;
This thought hit him a few times a day now and it was getting quite exhausting having to hide his erection in class and at dinner every so often.
“Come, Aodhan.” The dragon was already getting tired and his head gently shook from side to side. It took a few tries before he started walking but otherwise the transfer to the cage went rather smoothly. The dragon gave a huge yawn, showing off his mighty sharp teeth before lying down. He opened his eyes a few times to stare at Harry before finally closing his eyes completely.  As Harry stood up against the now closed cage, he wondered if he would ever see his friend again. A strong hand landed on his shoulder and the leader of the group smiled sympathetically. His dark brown eyes gave Harry a sense of calm as he glanced at the muscular man.
After a long wonderful dinner, the headmaster wished them all back and reminded the first years of the different rules for their return. Finally, the tired boys dragged their feet up to the dorm room and almost immediately got ready for bed.
Harry thought for what felt like hours in the small livingroom. He watched as Draco stood there, vulnerable, waiting for his answer. If all the pain had let to this one moment, he knew this was the time to take revenge. Here, right now, he could crush Draco’s entire will to live. He could tell him how much better he was doing without him. How happy he was with another man. A man who was smart and kind and nothing like him. Make Draco know how unwanted he was in comparison to Harry life outside of Hogwarts.
“I’m not surprised. He’s one of the smartest in Slytherin.” Jason tried to kiss the top of the boy’s head but was harshly rejected.
“Potter,” Snape sat down behind his desk, suddenly sounding very tired. “While I usually don’t find myself caring what pre-maturing adolescents achieve in their spare time, I will NOT have you breaking rules around my school, understood?”  Harry nodded.  “More so, of all the people you could have chosen to get involved with, why must you choose the most difficult of them all? Potter, are you even aware of Mr. Malfoy’ reputation in Slytherin?”
“I know you don’t believe me when I say this; thinking it’s as how a school-crush state their love, but I ‘literally’ can’t live without you.”
“We don’t need to bring up such painful memories. No matter how it went, I still abandoned him and his father. Why should I wish to discuss such difficulties? No, we will focus on the present where I will help him become a spectacular wizard.”
“Why?” he replaced the last book, he was holding back on the shelf. “I thought this was what he wanted.”
The compartment was deadly silence as Draco friends waited in anticipation for his answer. Pansy seemed at ease, but Draco could see her fingers picking at her nail roots. A horrible nervous habit she had had since childhood.
Standing in front of the giant stone-wall operating as an entrance, Harry came up with every word he believed could be a possibility.
Unfortunately, Aodhan didn’t think he was quick enough to provide or simply didn’t care because the next second a large ripping sound was heard, and the treats fell to the floor. The dragon – upon seeing the treasure – let go of the offending piece of cloth and started gathering.
Without any further question, Severus went to him and stood straight in front of him. Looking down at the beautiful and kind person, he felt slightly embarrassed when he realized he had placed his crotch at eyelevel with Lauris. Although looking down, the man didn’t seem to mind. Instead he raised his hands and slid them up across his chest, fiddling with his shirt. In the end he settled for a handful of it and dragged Severus down with him, lying back on the bed.
“That’s fine. We will do the paper together.” Jason assured him, continuing to sketch a brainstorm for the essay.
He ran across the room, right past Madam Pomphrey whom looked ready to argue for her patient’s safety. Looking at the boy lying on the bed, Harry couldn’t help but feel a sinking hole dropping in his stomach. Malfoy looked completely beaten up. His head was wrapped in a bandages and his eyebrow was a weird purple paste smeared across it, probably healing it.
“Oh no, please don’t! The ferret, really?” Ron whined. “No. no, I veto this one! Anybody else, ANYBODY.”
The boy stopped smiling and gave him a darkened look. It was very rare to see such calm yet angry emotion flicking across the boy’s face, but it wouldn’t surprise if the boy possessed a few other of his traits, such as temper.
“Cute teddy by the way.” Neville teased him. Looking down he noticed the giraffe had fallen beside him and Harry’s heart began racing. He hadn’t found Draco yet and the train was almost here! He hurried to magically wrap the giraffe in green colors and a giant red ribbon before running out of the room. He felt sorry not to wait for Neville but he had to find Draco before he left. Getting to the entrance hall, he looked around the tons of students whom were already leaving. Seeing Dean, he breathlessly asked if he had seen the blond. Shaking his head, Dean told him the Slytherin usually left as the first ones, to get good seats.
“It’s morning. Look.” Jason was already sitting up and his hair looked even more in disarray than usual. Harry’s own hair probably matched very well. As he stretched his body, he had accidently kicked something from the end of his bed to the floor. A lightly colored packages with a small green ribbon laid there, waiting to be opened. After getting the present up, he noticed a rather big pile lying on the bed. Looking to his right he could see Jason was already opening his own but consistently smaller pile.
Turning around he saw his future bride standing in a beautiful wedding dress. She was truly breathtaking and had he been in love, Draco was certain he would be pleased at the thought of how envious all the men would be downstairs, looking at the woman beside him. Her hair was done in a neat bun with a feather stuck between two pearls on the side.
It was almost euphorically. Potter had uttered his name in passion. Not just his name, but his first name.
The letter was short, had no reasons or arguments as to why, but it simply stated he had a more important task to deal with back in England as new information had arrived and the Dark Lord wanted him to find out more.
It certainly helped when Malfoy and Harry took the stage and instantly attracted some of the attention. Speaking of which…
Laughing, Draco played along. “Well Mr. Potter, Long time, no see.” He let go of the hand to reach into his pocket. Pulling it back out he reached out for Harry again, dropping the silver necklace into the outreached hand.
“As the headmaster of this school I will tell you, it never gets any easier to witness so many students graduating. As we, the faculty and I, are just as proud and excited as you are, we will also feel a loss.” – Harry could practically hear Snape snort.”- Seeing you enter the doors as timid children and watch you each grow with confidence and strength is a true joy I never tire of.”
“It’s fine.” Jason looked at his watch. “Since class is almost over, how about we meet this Wednesday at 7?”
“Good to hear.” He tried to follow up. “Hermione says you are very good in Ancient Runes and you two almost always tie in the pop-quiz.” At least that was what she said back in third year. Harry crossed his fingers in desperate hope that Knott was still taking the class.
Looking up startled, Harry realized he had forgotten to finish his breakfast and now Hermione and Ron were about ready to get to class. Quickly pocketing the note and stuffing his mouth with the rest of his toast, he hurried after them.
Standing in the receiving line along the others, all he needed now was his diploma. The students of the seventh year at Hogwarts were standing in their black robes, waiting for their ending as well as their new beginning. The sun was beaming through the great hall’s windows, leaving the students and faculty members slightly sweaty. The entire great hall had been expanded and families were gathered on benches in the back, excitingly chattering amongst each other as everyone waited for the ceremony to begin.
of how this would affect us, your family! Our heritage rest completely on your shoulder, depending on your marriage and heir. The Malfoys’ have always stood strong even when the dark lord fell, before we were forced into hiding our obvious wealth and pureblood became an almost defiled word.” Lucius rambled.
“If I find out you have used it in Quidditch or for your exam I will make your life a living hell, Mr. Potter.”
No matter how badly he wished to believe Blaise was merely shy, sometimes his reactions to Jason’s public affection created the tinniest black hole of doubt inside him. Every time he pulled away, walked away from or told Jason to leave him alone… a small part of his human side told him to let go, while his veela side screamed for him to hold on even harder.
Thankfully, the wolf heard him and Remus turned around to see him stumbling down the hill. Close enough, Harry stopped and desperately tried to catch his breath. His pulse was drumming in his ears.
“What are you doing?!” Severus almost screamed as they ran. He could still hear the waiter yelling behind them.
“You know, I’m not so sure anymore. I always thought it was what was the right thing for me… I guess I never considered other options.” Harry shrugged.
His friends had so far kept quiet about the small amount of work he got done, but apparently decided to intervene as Draco broke yet another quill.
Looking back, he noticed her brother right away. The two siblings had the same chestnut colored curls and their small statures was remarkably similar.
Chuckling the round man looked a few lines down, finally pulling out a black suit. Harry instantly loved it.
Harry only smiled greatly and thanked him for the gift. He knew the Professor was serious in his threat but had also come to understand how much easier it was to mask his insecurity with sarcasm.  It had obviously mattered to him that Harry had liked the gift.
Severus gave the smallest sign of gratefulness for his friend, but Malfoy chose to ignore him. He was obviously still bothered that Severus the halfblood, had gotten a letter and he the pureblood, hadn’t. The black haired man hurried to hide the message inside his robe and didn’t bring it out before he was certain he was alone in their room. Opening the letter was easy, nor spell or curses had been placed but as he opened it, he was suddenly filled with an uneasy and dreadful emotion. It felt unnatural and Severus imagined it to a strong repellent charm with a touch of dark magic.
“You’ve changed…” She took a steading breath. “Both you and Blaise. I used to respect you. Your ideas, ambitions. Why would you throw that away, just for…” she left off, shaking her head, denying the truth.
“Harry…” Draco cried. “I know I made a mistake, a huge one, but I can’t give you up like that. I want you in my life-“
“Merlin Potter, you should see yourself right now.” he hissed. “Lying so ready for me. Ready, just for me. God, if I had known you had such a perfect ass, I would have pushed you against a corridor and taken you the second you agreed to date.”
Knott had given him an older looking book on vexillology and heraldic in the magic world. Not exactly, a fun present but it would be rather useful in History of Magic. Especially, to catch a few cheap extra points in their assignments. Blaise had bought him a few new shirts from the muggle brand Ralph Lauren, Goyle and Crabbe had both bought him sweets he didn’t like –probably hoping he would take it back to Hogwarts so they could eat it themselves.
So, Remus and Severus have a past, at last a past that isn’t just school related. Christmas is over and we are approaching the second half of the year.
your family and losing a member of the family takes its toll on us. It is human nature. I have lost as well in the war and I do not believe it is clever to ignore the facts of the matter.”
“Brave as lionheart.” He repeated the password twice before the older woman finally swung open. Before he had entered the smaller entrance hall, he heard the whispering of voices and the kittling fire.
Realizing he was still inspecting the couple, Blaise shook his head and moved his attention. Smiling forcefully, the smaller Slytherin twirled them around.
The Black-haired girl looked amused but Draco wasn’t fooled. He had known Pansy for most of his life and he could recognize the smaller signs that she was feeling annoyed. Her mouth twitched ever so slightly and her eyes were getting stingy.
“I think you should give him a chance. For all you know, he’s really trying. It’s seems easy for us to comprehend why we, as a community are equal, but for a Malfoy it’s a whole new beginning.”
“And while I find it very noble of you to tell me of which I already know, I don’t believe you being a guest at the grounds gives you permission to allow the students to break rules.” Snape’s voice could cut glass as he glared at Remus. “Now all students who does not feel like having detention for an entire week with Mr. Filch, get going. 10 points from each of you for breaking in.”
Underneath his foot was a crumbled torn piece of parchment. Realizing, one of the boys must have dropped it, he quickly read the note. Considering the awful handwriting, it must have been Potter’s. As he read it, Severus couldn’t comprehend the meaning behind the note. It was nothing but a scribble of boy names. Although it was rather peculiar that not only one, but three of the names belonged to Slytherins from the same year as Potter. His godson’s name stood out like an eyesore and after the little incident right now, Severus would have to speak to his godson before he himself got involved in some troubling teenage drama. Pocketing the note, he stormed into his classroom to teach the two very subjects of his constant headache.
Snape didn’t give him any regard except a short nod. Deeming himself ready Harry moved his focus to the pale face of his friend.
Twirling around to face him, her hair flowed to her back and he as able to see short sleeves being see-through off-arm, lying softly right beneath her shoulders. She seemed rather surprised by his honesty. To make matters even more uncomfortable, her eyes started getting misty. She blinked furiously before suddenly stepping forward to hug him tightly.
Harry was about to answer but suddenly realized where they were going. They had left the bigger and more crowded part of Hogsmeade and Malfoy had dragged them towards the train station. It looked giant when the other students weren’t gathered to go home for Christmas. The onewayed track was lightly colored from the frost. Malfoy gently pulled him further until they reached the first of the smaller benches, before the actual stone walled train station began.
Laughing, Harry simply said; “A muggle tradition.” And that seemed to be the end of Draco’s curiosity. Instead he leaned in and gave Harry a gentle kiss on the lips.
“No, Malfoy.” Harry stopped them and forced the paler boy to face him. “Do you WANT to work there? At that job? Beside your father?”
“No, I hear that often. I never really cared where I ended up, I just wanted to be near my twin brother. When he quickly went to the Slytherin house at the ceremony, I begged the hat to place me with him. I would probably had ended up in Hufflepuff but thankfully the hat listened to me.” she told him.
A bark right above them had them jump away from each other. Looking up they saw a rather large dog starring them down. In perfect sync the pushed up against the wall, hoping the owners wouldn’t see them. they held their breath as they listened for the owner’s reaction. Thankfully, the older lady – by the sound of it – pulled on the leash and shushed the dog. They listened in silence as their footsteps disappeared.
The student population had thinned out and slowly turned into groups of sixth or more walking together. The six Slytherins had stayed together walking alone and quickly, trying to escape the many loud children. Finally arriving at the carriages, Draco noticed something move in front of it. Looking beside it before entering, he saw damn Potter petting the empty air.
“I just think it is weird, okay? A new guy very keen on befriending the boy who lived? What do you even know about him?”
Arriving home, the gang went to their dorm room to put their stuff away. Harry directly went to the bathroom to get ready for bed. His new robes were hanging on the wall, clean and pressed by the elves. Brushing thoroughly he wondered about tomorrow night. Fred and George had obviously been teasing him, but there was some truth to it. Many couples expected balls or proms to be the night where the magic happened. Was Draco anticipating this as well? Did Harry?
“Professor, I’m sorry for having forced you to come up here in the middle of the night.” Harry began. “I… had a nightmare.”
Looking at the teachers table he noticed most of the adults looked genuinely excited, only one kept his face from looking like he swallowed a lemon whole. Snape seemed angrier than usual and looking back to their new Dark Arts professor, Harry had a feeling it had nothing to do with the Christmas ball.
It wasn’t possible for humans to bond with dragons in such fashion – he had checked with Hagrid – but it didn’t matter. He just knew Aodhan missed him as much as Harry did him. Perhaps it was because of the heartbreaking cries when he left the last time? Maybe it had some sort of power to possess you to feel sorry for them?
“Okay, one beater from each team had already been banned from the field after only one hour. It was SO intense. My fa- people thought the reason for the roughened game were more political than the actual game.”
Nodding uninterested, Draco grabbed his dragonhide gloves. Mimicking his behaviour Melck started by digging up the dirt around the plant as Draco began to pluck the dead leaves. They stood in utter silence, each concentration on their own task. This suited him just perfectly, as he wanted to talk to Melck as little as possible. He was a complete embarrassment to their house if not only for his unfortunate blood status but his annoyingly cheerful disposition as well.  Speaking of which, Draco tried to calm himself with a deep breath as Melck started humming a jovial tune.
“Yes. Of course.” Without looking back, Harry settled in line behind the pair, although he couldn’t ignore the way the hairs on his neck stood up feeling Malfoy’s stare at the back of his head.
Fawkes sat quite still on top of the sleeping man, and Blaise wished the stupid bird would hurry up and do something beside sitting there and staring at him.
“Don’t push it, Potter.” Malfoy smirked and looked back at him. This was nice. It had been awhile since Harry remembered he could talk to people whom, like him, had been placed in a situation they didn’t ask for. Malfoy had been trapped like he, just on the other side of the line. Harry could only imagine the fear of losing his parents, as he feared losing the Weasleys.
“You’re right, sorry.” He took another sip of wine in defeat. Turning his attention to him, Draco looked at him before smiling coyly.
“The big one is for my uncle, the twins get the same pair of quillsets – wait where is their card?” Seamus was mostly busy organizing the mess he had created and placing the right cards on them, while Harry was stuck actually wrapping.
“Severus!” Remus interrupted his frantic. “I doubt Jason will go any further without telling Mr. Zabini the truth, how else will he possibly explain the sudden downfall?”
“No. Well not them, but Ginny asked about Harry…” Without Hermione to back him up, even Ron didn’t seem convinced anymore. Served him right. It only took a second before Dean and Seamus practically attacked him.
Reaching out a hand, Harry hurried to take it in a firm grip. As they shook hands, a deep chuckle from behind Harry, reached them. Turning, he saw Draco Malfoy, leaning casually against the wall. Finally grabbing their attention, he slowly approached the trio.
Pansy looked madder than Draco had ever seen her before. “You have humiliated me in front of everyone who is someone in our circle! Not only does it look like you completely ditched me for a MAN! No, you left your house for the golden boy’s ass!” She sneered, her mouth crunched up as if she had eaten something disgusting.
“Blaise didn’t look very assured, but he probably sensed his friend’s discomfort and let it go for now.
“Well, Potter, since my date for some reason see the ‘fun’ in sitting with Gryffindors- which I fail to by the way- and the fact my so-called best friend abandoned me, I saw no other option than to join this side of the floor.” Blaise huffed.
Right before lunch, Harry had a free period. He decided to use it to visit Hagrid, as this would be one of the few last possibilities before their graduation. This was the only period on his entire timetable he was alone so he might as well spent it getting some fresh air before Hermione or Draco caught him not studying.
How dare they have the audacity to insinuate he could possibly have any kind of feelings except annoyment for the Gryffindork?  He wanted his freedom, nothing less! And certainly, no more from the golden boy. Besides being at least decent to look at from some angles, what did he have to offer him? Draco was already rich, handsome, intelligent and had a great reputation. Not as good, as it used to, but still better than any mudbloods and so many pureblood families.
The teen, a year younger than Harry, was now taller than him and it annoyed him to no end as he was once more reminded of his low stature. But where the child used to resemble to a following puppy, now stood a quite handsome teen with a huge set of white teeth. Beside the turned-handsome teen stood another Hufflepuff, Harry couldn’t recognize.
Blaise almost followed as the hand fell from his cheek. Shaking his head like a petulant toddler, he kept trying to grab Jason’s hands again.
“Run!” he laughed and then he started running as quickly as he could between the chairs, pulling Severus along. The waiter behind took a moment before realizing what they had done.
Harry found himself missing the dragon in an odd fashion. He imagined this was how dog-people felt when they had been on vacation without their pets. He just constantly wished to see Aodhan. Watch him fly, play and eat. He loved every small detail of his scaly face and eyes. The way he pushed against Harry’s hand to get petted or a treat. Harry had saved a few of Hedwig’s owl protein stones in his pocket. He would count that as a present since it would be impossible to buy anything dragon related in Hogsmeade without raising suspicion.
“I’m glad.” Harry smiled before turning quiet. The boys agreed their break had lasted long enough and went back to work.
“Better than this chaos.” Seamus muttered and decisively sat out to troth through the snow. The group continued their search and Hermione, being the one whom remembered the shop, walked ahead of them. Her curly head of hair swept through the wind as she turned from left to right, searching.
“Oh, erhm… the first one sound interesting.” Harry tried to input but even to him it sounded pretty pathetic.
Harry slid his hand across the unicorn and sent it flying off into the next frame. He smiled as it ran alongside off him, gracefully following downstairs. As the moving case finally came to a holt, Harry continued following it into the hall on the second floor, instead of taking the next pair of stairs. The unicorn apparently found it amusing and ran faster and faster until Harry had to run as well to keep up.
Snape paced back and forth, scattering his brain for examples. The veela was too distraught and he would have to be prepared for an emergency spell, in case Jason lost control.
“Erhm, maybe.” Unsure wither he would be able to go or if the ban had already become effective. “Are you all getting new ones?”
“You know Harry, most people don’t believe it is a good idea to be dating interhousing but I believe it could work very well between you and Draco.”
“Melck asked me to bring you this.” He handed him a long rolled up parchment. Unfolding the paper, Harry was surprised to find a smaller note inside.
He turned to see if Jason was anywhere still sleeping, but the room was empty besides him. He couldn’t remember when he had fallen asleep. He was still incredibly tired, but it was rather obvious since he hadn’t slept until late in the night. What time was it now?
“I don’t.” Seeing the look the Malfoy gave him, he rephrased; “Okay, I do but I’m trying to understand, okay?”
The change was immediate. The girls’ giggling and whispering stopped as they stared at him in surprise. The bold girl’s attitude shook as she quickly stepped to the side, letting him pass. They all followed through and hurried out of his way.
Lunch was almost over but the seventh years were trying to stretch their break as far as possible. Next period was History of Magic. No matter how much they had wished for it, Professor Binns still refused to retire – or just become a Hogwarts ghost at least – and therefore, it was still the class everyone dreaded. The Ravenclaws tried their hardest to keep awake during his ramping on the great goblin war in 1337, but even they had to give up half way through.
“Yeah. I didn’t really ask my father – not since I was little, anyway – why I didn’t have a mother. It was very clear it hurt my father to speak about it and he never had others around. I didn’t even know he was gay.” Once again, a glooming look haunted his face.
Calmly saying he would be back in a minute – mostly to keep Pansy from taking his favorite spot- he went upstairs into their room. Throwing his stuff onto their shared table, Blaise could almost have screamed when something in the darkened room, moved. Before he could have the time to embarrass himself, he noticed the blond head sticking out beneath the covers on the bed.
“Fine. It is always harder the first week, getting used to the new beds, sharing a room with so many people and generally be in another country again.” Malfoy explained. “You?”
“I’ve only been here once before.” He explained. “I found it by accident, looking for the haunted house and I took a wrong turn. It wasn’t frozen the last time I was here. A few birds had gathered and was swimming around.”
Walking into the town, Malfoy asked what he wanted to do. Looking around, Harry could see the line in Zonkos’ was short so he hurried to drag Malfoy with him.
Nodding the boy had almost closed the door when Harry called for him once again. The slightly annoyed boy stared at him, waiting for his bidding. Smiling gently, Harry wished him a merry Christmas. Blaise seemed surprised before smirking.
Accepting- and opening it, Draco was confused as to what he was looking at. It was just an address to somewhere in London. Did Severus have an apartment there? But as he completely unfolded the handwritten note, something heavy fell out and landed in his hand.
The kiss they shared went slow at first but was soon getting overheated, making both men moan and pant for air. Step by step, their clothes disappeared, leaving their flesh plastered up against each other. Severus hadn’t been saying anything for the entire time but Lauris didn’t seem to mind. He did indeed speak enough for both of them, and for each time he begged for him to hurry, Severus felt himself getting closer. Finally, after an eternity he pushed into the tightened body underneath him. The sweaty and panting man pushed back against him, making them closer than ever. Severus felt so many emotions at this point and the pleasure rose for every second Lauris begged him to ‘take him harder’ and ‘faster’.
“I am definitely getting new ones. Maybe with some real gold cufflinks to match.” Dean smiled charmingly.  Seamus shoved him teasingly. “Show off.”  The group of friends laughed and continued their day.
“Rodd, we should probably get going now. We won’t be back before sunset.” A female voice intervened from behind them.
His heart was pounding, his cheeks felt hot and he couldn’t help but smile as Harry turned around to glance at him.
“Oh. Well, that was probably just wishful thinking.” Harry tried to swallow the lump gathering in his throat. “Besides, they were kids, that can’t really be taken seriously, right?”
Hermione was walking in front with her nose buried in their potion book. Probably reading ahead on next week’s topic. Harry had already read the two chapters for today and they were most certainly not in the middle of the book, where Hermione was reading now.
Right now, the seventh-year boys’ room was in complete disarray. Luna and Hermione were sitting on Ron‘s bed chatting amused as they watched the boys run around, looking for all their clothes. Ron was randomly searching through his trunk, throwing underwear and shirts all around. Dean was helping Seamus look for his favorite sweater that Seamus kept insisting
“And nothing else. We met in Australia, he told me he was going to Hogwarts. That is it.” Blaise said sounding very uninterested.
It seemed unreal, wanting to leave his first and only home, but the chaos was undeniably not worth it anymore. No matter what, his friends were still with him and he wouldn’t be able to heal without getting away from the blonde man who broke his heart. Wither he wanted to or not, he was forced to see Malfoy every single day and his heart still burned with anger and betrayal. He did not wish to acknowledge it but deep underneath the pain, something akin to love was still lying.
Dean finally exited their bathroom and was obviously completely done. Even with his polished black shoes neatly tied. The brownish suit he had chosen looked much better on him now than in the store. The oliveskinned boy dusted off his clean shoulders and looked up smiling confidently.
“I see.” Neville’s retort sent the boys around him into giggles as the watched Harry Potter blush quite clearly.
The two gorillaz by the door laughed so loud Draco swore the window shook. Even Blaise couldn’t help but give a small smirk. Pansy on the other hand looked like she tried to stop herself from shooting ‘Crucio’ out through her eyes right now. In the end, she just huffed.
Harry had been staring at the roaring fire for almost forty minutes now without moving an inch. Hermione had already been after him twice since he hadn’t opened his book to get any studying done. But right now, he knew it wouldn’t matter. Even if he opened his textbook, he wouldn’t be able to concentrate on anything. All he wanted was to be with Hagrid and Aodhan. Or at least with Draco. He wouldn’t be able to leave the Gryffindor tower for another thirty minutes and he was getting restless.  The worst part was he couldn’t even tell his friends why he was so upset since no one was allowed to know of Aodhan’s existence.  Eventually the last of his housemates had gone to bed and he fished out his cloak from beneath the sofa cushion where he had hidden it.
“Yes, you said so, already.” Harry crossed his arms in a defensive manner. While Pansy wasn’t a… horrible person, they certainly wasn’t friends.
‘Merlin Lauris, how I wish you were here with me now.’ How long had it been since he had truly missed the beautiful man? He missed his company every so often, but it had been years since he truly felt the impact Lauris had had on his life. The aching in his heart had increased since he had learned of his son’s existence.
Slowly, murmurs started drifting in and out. Some became almost too close, it hurt his head, and others’ were a low frequents.
While Harry had been remotely curious how Jason’s father had been, he also felt like he violated Severus trust as he ended up telling the story of how they met. Jason deserved to know how they were together, but Harry had no excuse to be standing out in the hallway, listening under his invisibility cloak.
“Oh merlin! Did you try to bite Snape?!” Harry interrupted. Remus only lifted a hand to silence him.
The next and last person was also someone Harry had thought a lot about, as he was considering their goodbye. Harry was in no way surprised when Snape was as dismissive and indifferent as he always were when it came to large crowds. He was never one to show emotions where others easily could witness.
Snape nodded without interjection. He simply sipped from his own mug as they sat in awkward silence.
The portrait which had stared at him suspiciously, suddenly swung open and Harry thanked his timeless luck.
Harry wasn’t sure what suddenly tipped him off. Perhaps it was the intense way Luna stared at Jason. Maybe it was the fact that she was already talking about magical creatures. Or because- like Harry- Jason tensed as if he had been tossed into a pile of snow.
“Thank you, headmaster,” Snape answered, even though his face looked anything but pleased at the idea of drinking whiskey with an emotional Hagrid. “But I do believe I have other matters to attend before tomorrow.”
An idea popped up. If he waited in the Slytherin common room, Draco was bound to come back eventually.
As the dragon frequently cast a shadow down on him, Harry closed his eyes and enjoyed the slightly warmth from the sun. Aodhan broke a few branches here and there and they fell all around him hitting the ground and bushes. Apparently, a few had landed just behind him before he could hear the sound of something against the ground. But they moved? Weird. Opening his eyes Harry heard a strange clicking sound from behind. Turning around he almost screamed. Behind him, looking rather ready for a light snack, stood a huge Acromantula. Bigger than any dog, it snapped its long pointy fangs towards him.
Jason looked completely struck as he quickly thanked the headmaster for his kindness. Jason hurried and gave Zabini a giant relieved hug. Harry watched as Snape finally let go with a shaking breath and massaged his aching temple from worry.
“Shh…” Harry continued to stroke him.  “It’s okay, boy.” Hagrid clapped him on the back between his wings.
Then they began exchanging the gift. Harry quickly threw his present to Jason as the older boy caught it and ‘
“Things just changed this summer, I guess. He said he was trying to get a second chance and I didn’t really believe it at first, but I think he is trying. Doesn’t everyone deserve to get one?”
“But Harry is coming too, Ron. He has class with us, remember? Harry are you coming?” she asked loudly. Clearly expecting him to follow her lead.
As they finished, the boys got ready for bed and Harry couldn’t help but envy how Seamus and Dean got to share a bed, be so open and comfortable sleeping beside one another.
That evening around six, Severus took off from their late meeting without telling anyone. He was so fretful and worried someone had followed him, he took two different off-roads to get there. When he finally arrived at the store, Lauris was closing up.
It was truly incredible, yet disturbing that a creature could have such an influence on him. He had of course always been a fan of animals, such as Hedwig and Buckbeak, but even with those two, he had never felt so awful, leaving.
At the possessive pronouncement, Jason bit his own cheek from growling and hurried to keep his mouth busy. Underneath him, Blaise was getting squirmier and it only brought him pleasure, seeing his mate blush in such a fashion. Looking back, Jason might have realized that Blaise was a teenage boy and didn’t have as much experience in keeping it calm. The smaller teen pushed up against him and even though Jason knew they both had an erection it took their relationship a huge step further, feeling each other for the first time. Before Jason could stop him, Blaise was urgently moving them against each other, moaning.
A barely given grunt coming from behind Ron’s curtains was all he got in response and Harry imagined it probably wouldn’t matter if they didn’t even notice he was gone. Quickly out the door with his invisibility cloak and his map, he checked the common room for people. But no one was nearby, probably having been exhausted from the long journey.
It almost felt unnatural directing it towards a Gryffindor, but he would have to start somewhere. At least this way, Potter couldn’t say anything stupid to piss him off as usual.
“I see.” Snape once again answered. “Mr. Malfoy, until further notice from your parents on the wedding planning, I would strongly advise you to stay away from Potter. While it may seem like an
“No! That is bloody messed up! Harry, tell him!” Ron pointed at Malfoy as if he were tattle tailing on him. Harry could have laughed if it was anybody else’s situation. Their entire conversation must have appeared comedic to by passers.
“No, I don’t think so.” Dean shock his head. “He was just as annoying as always, just… a little more quiet, I think.”
Both boys had been caught up in their little chat and apparently hadn’t seen the professor approaching. Taking a few steps back, Potter quickly explained how they were on their way. His godson did not seem worried the least and made no attempt to back up the story or even improvise his own.
“I see.” Snape drawled. “And since you seem to be ‘in love’ have you by any chance explained your current platonic relationship status with Miss Parkinson, to Potter?”
But hoping everything was just as always was clearly too much to ask for. Harry had barely stepped away from the staircase before the common room became deadly silent. A few gryffindor-girls gave him encouraging smiles, while most gave him looks of an odd combination between pity and curiosity. Although a rare few only could be described as… disgust.
“No, my aunt thinks it will be too hard for both of us and she has arranged to come here and pick me up in London. I don’t know her very well yet but it just isn’t the Christmas I was hoping for. Ever. I don’t even think she wants to come, she just doesn’t want to seem selfish.”
“Okay, I’m seriously glad you are good, mate, but can we please discuss why the hell the ferret decided to join in?” Ron practically spluttered.
“Zabini, did you have a nice summer?” The question was undeniably random, but it was the most neutral question that popped into his head at the moment.
“Oh, Draco, you would think after seven years you had finally learned a little about the gryffindorks.”
The professor sat down in his chair behind his desk and gestured for Harry to sit down as well. For some time Harry squirmed in his seat, as the black eyes stared him into the soul. Snape seemed… uncertain, for a change.
“Suit yourself,” the teen quickly tossed his head back and drank, while his friends all cheered mockingly.
“Zabini, just shut up!” Harry interrupted furiously. “You need to come with me.” Grabbing a sleek sleeve Harry dragged Zabini towards the stairs. The forceful method didn’t work for very long, as Zabini was quite a bit stronger than him.
“No offense, my love, but you haven’t exactly proved me wrong.” Jason emphasized by giving the smaller boy a squeeze. Blaise merely huffed in response. The rest of the trip was mostly silenced, but it was comfortable. While he sometimes missed the more carefree personality Blaise had had on his vacation back in Australia, Jason was certain it would return once they were done with school. If they ever got to that…
Laughing again, Harry clenched his hands, trying to keep from losing his temper. Suddenly steps sounded from behind him.
As the group was finally gathered, Ron and Hermione led the group out of the tower and towards the great hall. As they slowly approached the halls surrounding the great hall’s stairway, groups of students appeared more often. This was always how Harry had imagined the parties at a real high school. He couldn’t help but envy Dudley whenever the fat teen would brag about the fun parties they had at Smither’s private school. How he would invite his friends over beforehand, hear loud music, be drinking and laughing.
Well, today had definitely sucked. People had been whispering and teasing him most of the day. While Seamus and Dean had been very nice to keep him away from most of it, he couldn’t ignore the laughing and teasing students making kissy faces at him. It seemed rather stupid how divided the male and female students were. The girls were actually the worst. He could deal with the teasing and mocking from the boys, that was standard at least once a year. But the girls? God, the giggling and blushing, every time they looked at him. It was as if they saw him in a new light. As if the fact that he was gay, now turned him from, well attractive, to… cute. One girl had even had the audacity to ask him what he thought of A-line skirts. What in the world was an A-line skirt?
“I’ll give it to him.” Both Jason and Harry must have looked shocked because Blaise accusingly asked them what was wrong. Not wishing to piss his temperamental boyfriend off, the tall boy kissed his cheek, acknowledging what a good idea that was.
Various types of agrees arose and Hermione suddenly seemed very interested in going. When asked why she was in such a rush, the strong headgirl replied; “I’m curious to see if they have gotten any new products we should be aware off.”
Yes, it was true, he did love the golden boy. Yes, it was an incredible night, but for Merlin sake; he was a Slytherin. He had pride. He had a reputation to uphold! So what of it was the first time he had ever made love instead of just thrusting into a body…
“Are you sure? I mean, it looks like your parents are already planning the wedding so why not just go with it?” Pansy mocked him in a sweetened voice as the others laughed. Clearly, they had forgotten whom they were speaking too.
Harry couldn’t help but envy the feeling of completement, Jason described. To feel like you belong with someone forever and looking like pieces of a two-pieced puzzle. It was one of the things, Harry secretly wished for. He had never experienced love in the form of another person like that. He once believed himself in love with Ginny, but he couldn’t force it to become anything more than a casual fling or perhaps even just brotherly. He certainly had had a big crush on Cho Chang, but it ended so quickly, he never got to feel like he missed her.
“Well, I didn’t see much. But someone screamed as the unicorn bolted. You were lying on the ground unconscious as Melck tried to get to you. She continued to strike after him and she hit him before practically running over him and headed for the forest. By the time Hagrid had come over, you were both bleeding.”
The almost-smile on Malfoy’s face quickly turned to a cruel smirk. Harry could feel the cringe creeping up on him, knowing whatever Malfoy was about to say only could make things worse.
“What?!” four Gryffindors almost jumped to the ceiling as a booming voice cut through the masses. Turning around they saw Ron standing right behind them, looking as red as his hair. An enraged expression clouded his face.
“Right and he just happened to kiss you because that is customary in Australia.” Draco snorted sarcastically, when he noticed the look on Blaise’s face. His eyes had dropped to his empty piece of paper and Draco didn’t dare actually think they were lightly glistening. Finally, Draco placed a cool hand on his friend’s arm.
“Right and I just wanted to say.; That I wouldn’t mind doing it again, sometime. Together.” Well that was… nice. Harry thought.
For a minute, Harry felt his anger start to melt, but he stubbornly held on to it. He wouldn’t let Draco get off so easily.
Draco had already read the chapter on ‘Ashwinder eggs’ and written notes. So instead of listening to Snape repeat their potion book, he decided to think about the next few steps with Potter. He realized it might be easier to get close to Potter if he was
Finally, the professor stopped to open the potionroom’s door. Big self-stirring cauldrons had already been placed on the tables, but Harry couldn’t recognize the greenish potion, bubbling.
“I should have… I… “Frantically the Slytherin searched his brain. “If I had lost the bet, we wouldn’t have been able to be together anyway! I would have had to marry someone else! My parents-“
“Yeah, sorry.” Harry gave a forced smile. “Just a little overwhelmed after the entire castle being so quiet during the entire week.” Well, that wasn’t completely a lie.
Who was he kidding? The almost silent apartment screamed loneliness and it truly felt cold inside and out. Looking at the grandfather clock, Harry felt the air in his lung turn icy. The burn continued down his body and collected in his empty stomach. Seeing the time reminded him on the giant painful thought that had haunted him all day.
As he tried to casually glance in their direction, he watched the pair of Slytherins discussing quietly.
“At first I believed my father had been fooling around with dark magic. It takes a lot of rather bloody and rare ingredients to make such a potion – and most of the ways are horrifying to gather. Even if you are capable of making such, the chance of surviving the birth is even harder for the child than the father.”
Harry wasn’t sure how long they sat there in silence, simply comforting each other, but in the end, they broke apart and Harry discreetly dried his cheeks. Even though he knew it was okay – especially in front of Remus – he still felt weirdly awkward crying in front of others.
Approaching the group, Harry worried slightly as he noticed Ron and Hermione was following the blonde girl.
Looking at her in the mirror was Hermione wearing a satin blue dress hugging her waist and bosom gently. The skirt was completely blue as well, but the fabric was ombre with ocean blue glitter. It had been a long time since Harry had seen her look so grown up and still so uncomfortable as she waited for his reaction.
Sometimes on rare occasions, Blaise and Melck decided to join them outside. While Draco certainly wasn’t a huge fan of the tall boy, he couldn’t deny how annoyingly nice it was to see Harry at ease around some of his housemates. Too bad, it had to Melck.
“Wow.” Harry couldn’t help but stare all around them. It seemed as though the great hall had become ten times bigger. The floor had taken a cold colored marble pattern in grey and white, while each and every wall was covered in mirrors. Making the already dancing couples appear thrice around. The windows had remained but Harry quickly looked up on the enchanted ceiling where there too, was a giant mirror. Harry could see him and Draco appear right on top in tiny dots of black and blond. Just as back in fourth year, a giant icecastle had been placed where the teachers table usually was, let out different kinds of drinks and in all variations and colors. Larger round tables were placed on the sides in the front and back, where up to twelve students could sit together. The tablecloth seemed as though it was made of pure snow, as the sides of it let tiny snowflakes fall to the floor as people touched them. In the middle of each table were an ice sculpture carved into a magical creature.
“It was just a joke…” he cried. “Don’t know why… it was just because I was the first walking by…. And everyone knows now!” He wasn’t sure if Snape even understood anything he tried to say. He wasn’t even sure what he was getting at. Everything seemed to fall apart. So many powerful memories fell to the ground and how the hell was he supposed to pick them up again?
“I won’t hurt you, I promise.” Draco laid down beside him and swiftly pulled Harry along, on top of him. “Why don’t you start?” ever the evil serpent, he grinned as Harry seemed even more nervous now. Lying down on top of the blond, Harry scooched down until he was a few inches from his crotch.
Draco could already sense the nervous asking for what it truly was. Should Harry go through with it and become a healer? The Gryffindor wasn’t lacking the initiative or the care, but maybe he would care a little too much?
“I still don’t get what she sees in him.” following his head’s direction Harry realized he was talking about Hermione and Ron.
Ancient Runes couldn’t have been more boring even if their teacher was Professor Binns. But it had never been up for discussion how many classes Draco had to take. Beside the ‘useless’ classes as Divination, Care for Magical Creature and Muggle Studies, his father demanded his absolute best regarding schoolwork. Each year Potter’s mudblood friend scored the highest rank amongst the students and each year his father reminded him to ‘
Blaise continued to caress his hand, waiting impatiently for him to wake. It must have been about ten painful minutes before tired eyes gently opened.
“Nope, Potter ‘sorry’ isn’t going to cut it today.” Grabbing the lightly freckled hand, Draco pulled them towards the boys’ bathroom.
“I guess…” Harry thought for a while in silence. Draco had been acting very strange… and it only happened after he had given Harry his sweater. Perhaps some of his friends had said something? Normally his friends seemed… a little cold, but he had gotten the feeling they simply didn’t care whom Draco was dating.
But it wasn’t so much the fright of seeing his friend on the floor, that had Harry barely moving; It was the horrifying state of his face.
He had done many worthnamemy-stuff for the Dark Lord! He had even been directly spoken to, a few times in the Malfoy manor. By this rate, he wouldn’t gain any true power or trust in the Dark Lord before his late forties, how pathetic!
“That is the bathroom and in here…” He opened the second door down the small hall. “-is my bedroom.” He gave a shy smile and entered; leaving Severus to stand in the doorway. The tan man sat down on his bed and faced him.
“And don’t worry, they are VERY sour. I could barely close my mouth around it.” Harry laughed as Jason started unpacking the box. Harry opened his own and to surprise, Jason had gotten him two books on Quidditch he had never seen; ‘
“It’s okay.” Harry tried to smile but it felt rather forced. He knew Draco should spend time with his friends but he couldn’t help the disappointment from overshadowing the fact that he wouldn’t see Draco again before after Christmas.
About to retort, Draco got distracted by Potter’s head becoming visible again behind the annoying girl. The golden trio had all gotten up from their seats and was heading for class. Without answering her, Draco got up and nodded at his two companions for them to follow him. This had better be worth it.
I have been looking forward so much to write this chapter! I really hope it turns out as great as I hoped.
