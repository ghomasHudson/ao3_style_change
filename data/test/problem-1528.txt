“Of you, Scarhead? Never.” Malfoy selected a broom and kicked off into the air, zipping to the goalpost and back. Every line of his body was bent on flight, and he laughed wildly as he flew.
“Oi, Harry!” Ron waved at Harry, catching his eye across the crowded room.
Apparently the Sorting had finished while Harry had been brooding. Headmistress McGonagall cleared her throat loudly, and Harry wrenched his attention back to the front of the hall.
is so important to you that she takes precedence over your mate--”
He plopped back down at the table, seemingly stumped. “We sat at the table and drank the tea and ate the biscuits--”
* * *
Ron rolled his eyes and gulped down some tea. “Give it a rest, mate. It’s weird that you know that, and it’s too ruddy early in the morning to talk about Malfoy. Ugh.”
“How dare you…” Draco turned to face him. Grey eyes glinted impishly at Harry, and a tidal wave of water careened toward his face. So began the first water fight Malfoy Manor had ever seen. Somewhere between splashing all the water out of the soapy tub, huddling together in absurdly fluffy towels, and tumbling into Draco’s four-poster bed, Harry fell in love. He would chuckle later to think that it was all because of one incorrigibly romantic house.
I make no promises. But if you must know, I rather fancy you too. See you tonight.
Draco regarded Harry with a wolfish grin, tracing the side of his face gently. “Yes, you’re all mine.”
Malfoy snarled, grey eyes popping unsettlingly. “It’s not as though I’m unaware of customer preferences! I did market research and tested the product with a select focus group. We offer a variety of sizes, and six different seasonings!” Malfoy ran a hand through his artfully coiffed hair and started cursing under his breath. “Fucking Golden Boy asks me if it’s a bloody
“She seems nice. Er, if you have a house elf, why did you answer your own door?” Harry blurted out. Invisible hands deposited a large tea tray onto the table between them as the words were still leaving Harry’s mouth.
Harry figured. The hand soon returned, sneaking higher up Harry’s thigh with each breath.
On Friday, Harry combed his hair extra carefully (not that it made any difference) and picked out his least holey pair of jeans. He even half-strangled himself with a necktie. The house would want to see he’d made an effort, after all. He Apparated to the right spot this time, just outside the gates of Malfoy Manor. They gave easily at his touch again, practically wriggling with delight like an overexcited puppy. The walk up the avenue seemed shorter this time, and the trees bent practically in half to shade his way. Harry chuckled to himself. This house liked his presence much better than most of them did.
“Pardon? You know how to bake?” Malfoy asked, staring at Harry as though he’d just asked him to chug poison or drop by Azkaban for a gala.
“Ugh. You absolute git, ‘difficult’ isn’t descriptive at all. I don’t want to be your dragon mate or whatever, but I don’t want you to die or anything either.”
. Or I could set that damnable Muggle machine ablaze; that sounds rather satisfactory.”
Harry was entranced. Before he knew it, he was across the room and reaching out for the leg with hungry, trembling hands. The leg was displeased by this, and kicked Harry solidly in the shin.
“Good, I think. I s’pose he can be, y’know, rather sweet,” Harry mumbled. “We’re kind of going on a date tomorrow?”
Luckily the room was deserted when Harry returned. He didn’t want Ron asking what had happened until he’d had a chance to figure it out himself. He stared at himself in the mirror, yanking at his open shirt collar to finger the lurid purple marks blooming on his neck. Were those teeth marks?
Harry went cold.
Yes, very funny. Taking advantage of what my five-year-old said to get one over on me? I hate when people say things they don’t mean. Fuck you.
P.S. Stop calling me Draco.
Harry sighed heavily. “Well, fuck. I thought I’d finally have a normal year for once.”
“Well, isn’t this a pleasant surprise!” Harry chuckled and stepped the rest of the way through.
“A Malfoy always avenges wrongs. A Malfoy always defends his family. Above all, a Malfoy always protects his mate,” Malfoy finished. “That’s you, Harry. You’re my mate. I didn’t know until June, when everything changed. I knew my mate was out in the world somewhere, and that I’d meet them at Hogwarts. I had no idea it would be you. But I am glad it’s you. I think we’ve always been drawn to each other, for good or for bad.
Malfoy straightened up from his exaggerated pose and smirked gleefully. “Of course not, Potter. I wouldn’t dream of it.”
Which was largely a wasted trip, but at least Hermione was pleased with Harry’s newfound dedication to studying. (She was somewhat dismayed when Harry’s enthusiasm didn’t extend to any other subject.) To Harry’s disappointment, sentient houses seemed to exist more in the realm of fantasy than fact: everyone agreed they existed, but couldn’t concur on anything else. So Harry sought knowledge on his own, sending away for out-of-print books and drawing up extensive notes for himself.
For his own part, Harry was quite glad Malfoy had apologized. As irritating as Malfoy tended to be, he was right: they had been only children. Harry resolved to take Malfoy at his word and genuinely try to fulfill their truce. He was quite sure Ron and Hermione would never like Draco Malfoy, but they began giving him small nods and not berating his presence whenever he appeared.
“Oi, Luna! You want some flowers?” Harry hollered as he saw their friend enter. She smiled and loped toward their table.
“Right. Er, I dunno what your plans are, but I figured I should tell you I’m staying at Hogwarts over the break.”
"Yes, love. Although I suppose that would be true of whoever happened to waltz in, but I know what you meant." Draco closed the portrait hole and stepped closer, dropping his bag carelessly on the floor and tracing Harry’s face with his fingertips. Surely he’d become even more handsome since he’d left; he seemed to glow, even in the dim light of the common room. Harry nodded fervently and pulled him onto his lap, traveling cloak and all.
“Hello, Mother,” Draco said, leaning down to brush a kiss across Narcissa’s knuckles. “You look lovely today: ‘beauty truly blent,’ indeed.”
Harry grinned as he sat down at their usual booth. “Hey Ron, ‘Mione. How’s your new initiative going?”
Malfoy took a swig of his butterbeer, allowing Harry to subtly admire the long, pale column of his throat. “I see. Is that why you returned to Hogwarts? So that you can achieve the proper NEWTS qualifications?”
A softly glowing orb rested lightly on his desk, accompanied by a folded scrap of parchment. Another note! And a gift, apparently, though nothing Harry recognized. He reached out for the parchment and unfolded it slowly. In contrast to Malfoy’s earlier flowery language, this note was brief.
As the music died down, Potter stalked over to Draco and straddled his lap, capturing his lips in a kiss.
The frog purse is real, and it's fantastic. Check out https://www.vam.ac.uk/articles/about-the-bags-inside-out-exhibition to see some really amazing bags.
Malfoy carded one hand through Harry’s messy hair and let his hand rest at the nape of Harry’s neck. It was delightfully warm and heavy. “Or it could be just you and I. Wouldn’t that be pleasant? Hogsmeade is charming at this time of year, and I heard there’s a new café opening next to Zonko’s. I’ll buy you a drink,” he coaxed, with a cheeky wink.
“Right, yeah. So, how long has the house been sentient?” A loud pop in the fireplace startled Harry, and the floorboards creaked ominously.
Harry nodded and cautiously opened the golden door. Instead of offering a glimpse into the room beyond, the doorway was obscured with a shimmering film, like the inside of a soap bubble. After casting a few spells to determine any danger, Harry carefully stuck his head through...only to find an enormous Quidditch pitch. Empty stands surrounded a vast blue sky and the most luxuriant lawn imaginable. Pristine brooms shone in a rack next to a rattling trunk that Harry surmised contained the full set of Quidditch balls. A tiny golden Snitch glinted in the sun where it hovered near the goalposts.
“You berk. After that ludicrous display, I fear I don’t have much choice.” Draco smirked. “Since you think I’m so heartbreakingly sexy, and most of my things are there anyway.” Pansy laughed. Ron gagged.
Harry groaned in frustration and chucked another rock into the lake. It was an idyllic Saturday, probably one of the last they’d have that year, and the giant squid was playing fetch with some third years a few hundred yards away. They were levitating large sticks into the water, and colossal suckered tentacles were gently tossing them back onto shore.
“Oh!” Apparently they hadn’t been alone after all. Harry’s head whirled around to notice Hermione reclining in the window seat, admiring the snow falling thickly onto the Hogwarts grounds. At least, she had been, until the two of them bumbled in and started necking. He laughed nervously. “Er, I was getting around to that. Happy Christmas, ‘Mione.”
“Oh, I forgot you could see it. It’s mine, but really I just remember there being a brill food cart around here,” Harry explained, craning his neck around the square to see if the sausage man was there.
“Whoever do you think you’re calling a
* * *
Not wanting to draw any more attention to himself, Harry tried to get to his feet. But Hermione was faster than him and pinned his shoulders down. Merlin, she was much stronger than he’d expected. She ran a few diagnostic spells and seemed pleased with the results, finally letting him up. “Harry’s perfectly fine, he just needs to eat. The feast should be starting any minute, so he’ll be alright.”
Harry’s mind supplied) were not.
His fumbling hands quickly removed each layer of clothing and kicked it into a pile in the corner. Harry walked down the shallow steps into the water’s embrace. He felt odd and tingly, as if there were something in the foam that made every nerve in his body stand on end and bask in its warmth. His toes left the marble bottom of the pool, and he felt utterly weightless. The carpet of glossy bubbles made it easy to float along just like one of them, changing Harry into a gossamer, incandescent being too. For once, Harry couldn’t overthink what was happening. For once, he decided to let go.
“I would like to welcome each of you back to Hogwarts,” announced McGonagall, her spectacles flashing in the candlelight. “We will be making some significant changes this year. First, in an effort to foster inter house unity, our returning eighth years will be sharing a common room and dorms of their own. Professor Vector will be our eighth year head, so please address any questions or concerns with her.” Professor Vector, a tall woman in an even taller hat, waved her hand briefly before McGonagall continued.
would also be appropriate, though I’m quite sure you wouldn’t know culture if it bit you in the arse.”
Harry took a hesitant step back. Malfoy followed him, a growl tearing from his lips.
Ron smacked the table hard, ratting the silverware horribly. Hermione winced. “Brace yourself, mate. So, the Malfoys were all acquitted at their trials, right? And the parents buggered straight off to France, but Malfoy’s just been camped out in the manor ever since, keeping things running and redoing the place. So he’s just trying to get back to normal life, right? But, get this: at a party he had last month, someone was rude to Malfoy so the house launched him out a window!”
Draco shot him a sly smile. “As did I.”
He crossed the street after they’d left to get a better look, but only so he and Ron and Hermione could laugh about it later. Unfortunately, Malfoy stepped out his door at the same time.
Harry groaned inwardly, staring at the towering pile of fabric. He begrudginly shucked off his many layers and got to it.
about? Harry groaned loudly, pushing away the flowers and shoving the note at Hermione.
Harry was almost disappointed on Saturday when no ostentatious gift revealed itself at breakfast. Or at lunch, or at dinner. Could this mean Malfoy had given up on courting him?
The old Muggle cliche seemed to be coming true: speak of the devil, and he appears.
Harry thought, shooting him a dark scowl.
But Harry was a bit more concerned by what was directly in front of them. Sacks of flour and sugar, a lump of creamy yellow butter, and a Muggle stand mixer sparkled on the kitchen’s center island.
“Just one more, Harry. And he’d never give you a dragon, McGonagall wouldn’t allow that.”
A colorful advertisement caught Harry’s eye. If Draco had never tried something as simple as a sausage roll, what else hadn’t he been exposed to? “Draco? We can still go shopping today, as much as you want. But let’s do some other fun stuff, too, alright? Muggle stuff.”
hard not to come when Draco moved down his body and undid his trousers with his teeth. He looked up at Harry with challenging eyes as he slid the zipper down with his tongue.
friend. Harry couldn’t recall Malfoy ever touching anyone else voluntarily, but he was always brushing against Harry’s side or tousling his hair and complaining about how it looked. He even tried to dress Harry sometimes, Malfoy stripping off his jumper for Harry if he felt cold, or wrapping a Slytherin scarf around his neck before they went out to fly. It was awfully strange, but it genuinely seemed to make Malfoy happy, so Harry figured it was fine.
Harry went to run a frustrated hand through his hair, until he remembered the delicate flower crown. “Weird. What could it possibly want us to do? The room’s bloody empty.”
The oak doors creaked open to reveal a wintry vision. Harry could hardly believe the Great Hall had been a battleground only months before. Magicked snowflakes fell from the ceiling above, catching and shining in dancers’ hair. Wreaths of waxy holly and ivy ringed the room, and brilliant fairy lights winked from every nook and cranny. Wooden trestle tables thrust against the walls groaned with bounty: towers of pastries, tureens of fragrant soup, and platters of roasted poultry and beef. Smaller tables dotted one side of the hall, intended for nibbles and resting one’s tired feet.
“Have you quite finished running away now?” Malfoy asked in a low voice. “I know you’re afraid, but I won’t hurt you.” Wickedness tinged his voice. “Unless you ask me to do so, of course.”
you look amazing,” Draco breathed. “I’m torching your old clothes when we return: all that ruddy flannel and old denim needs to go. I want you to dress like this always, but only for my view, or else the whole world will want to get their hands on you.”
But all Harry and Ron could do was stare. “Malfoy? This is your place?” Harry finally managed.
.” Harry practically snarled, feeling the harsh burn of anger in his throat. He wheeled about and headed for the castle’s exit, barely caring at all if Malfoy followed. He was Harry Potter: he’d killed bloody Voldemort, and wasn’t about to be pushed around by some poncy eighth-year student, no matter how fit he was.
Third, Malfoy had called him his mate. Mate, hmm…what was that supposed to mean? Judging by all the aggressive snogging, Malfoy definitely didn’t mean it in the same way Ron did, like one brother talking to another. Was it supposed to be something romantic? Or had his whole friendship with Malfoy been some elaborate scheme, some way to hurt or trick Harry?
“Probably couldn’t even get through the gate,” Harry muttered.
“They must not get many visitors,” Harry muttered as the gates snapped sharply shut behind him. Graceful trees bowed along a gravel path that crunched under Harry’s feet. He must have walked for at least twenty minutes before the house finally became visible through the trees.
“You could still always come to the Burrow,” Ron muttered, tossing a stack of unlaundered robes into the trunk.
He was dead set on brooding in his rented flat for a few days before setting out again (maybe to France this time, even though the language made no ruddy sense coming from his mouth), but a visit to Ron and Hermione changed his plans entirely.
(See the end of the chapter for
Yes, the consummate perfection of Draco Malfoy is a thorn in Harry’s side.
Thank you to everyone who posted such lovely and encouraging comments. You made me want to make something beautiful for you, so I hope you liked it. Thank you so much for reading!
Neville’s blush had now spread all the way down his neck. He quickly grabbed the nearest book and hid his glowing face with it, not caring that he was reading
“Morning, Malfoy. Congrats on the shop.”
“So, a dance, then?” Harry wondered.
Harry thought.
“Hush, Draco, he'll think you don't like his little beard," Parkinson pretended to whisper. She cut her eyes at Malfoy before turning her attention to Ron. He was pleasantly surprised to realize that she was even smiling.
bit to do with Ron and Hermione’s new problem. Quite frankly, spending time with Ron and Hermione had become unbearable in a completely different way than it had been before. Harry wasn’t quite sure what was going on, but saying the slightest wrong word to either of them would have them  arguing like cats and dogs. Harry couldn’t even go into his own room these days, as he tried one morning and heard his two best friends arguing for the umpteenth time.
Ah-ha, they were in luck! Harry spotted the garish orange cart a few yards away and trotted over to buy some breakfast. The man traded Harry a flaky pastry for a few coins, and Harry sighed in satisfaction as they walked away. Just as he unfolded the wrapper to take his first ravenous bite, an aristocratically unimpressed voice interrupted.
Malfoy smirked, as though he had a tantalizing secret. “Me too.”
” Ron exploded. “It’s bloody Malfoy the Death Eater! Of course they’re not soul mates, that’s not even a thing! Only in Ginny’s silly romance novels...”
“If you’re absolutely certain. Be safe,
, you feel good,” Draco moaned low as he pushed in all the way. “Of course the Golden Boy has a golden arse.” He waited for Harry to adjust to the intrusion, holding himself still with what seemed to be an iron will. When Harry nodded for him to continue, he started off with shallow rocking, before working his way up to full, effortlessly thorough thrusts. Harry moaned unabashedly as waves of pleasure hit him.
“Oh really?” Zabini’s eyes darkened. “Will he be spending the night with
He finally shared his hunch with Ron and Hermione after a few weeks of dubiously ordinary behavior.
He was mostly right. Harry squeaked by with passable NEWTS scores and packed his trunk right away. After Hogwarts, he explored abandoned wizarding castles in Ireland, debated the possibilities of sentient houseboats in Norway, and almost died investigating a ferocious villa in Spain. (The problem turned out to be a bloodthirsty ghost, rather than the house having gained consciousness. Harry was very glad to leave that case in someone else’s more capable hands.)
Malfoy nodded sulkily. “It made me clean up after it, too.” The curl of his lip indicated this was
“I believe it would be best for me to walk you out, Potter. Let’s be on our way before the manor has another brilliant idea.”
“Hey! Stop, I’m too empty for that. And you’re the tosser,” Harry protested.
“Oops,” Harry pulled a face. “Sorry. I really don’t know how to dance at all.”
Despite the compliments at the end, his boyfriend was still such a prick. Harry
But he didn’t have much time to think more about it, as McGonagall arranged them into rows and reviewed the steps of the waltz with them. Poor Neville was absolutely hopeless, but after they’d slogged through the box step what felt like a million times, most of the other students were at least passable waltzers.
Hermione’s face looked exactly as amused as she was trying not to be. “It was on the ground floor, to be fair. Nobody was injured. But Helena in my office was there, and she told me all about it. The man had the nerve to try to grope Malfoy--”
“Have you ever considered that I may not
Instead of responding with some snooty barb, Malfoy smiled cordially and poured them each a cup of tea. “Since you find it so imperative to ask after the help, Bitsy is unusually shy. Requiring her to answer the door would result in the need for a lengthy lie-down each time, which would drastically decrease my supply of baked goods. One can’t have that.” His mouth quirked up at the corners just before he took a miniscule sip of tea. Harry blinked in disbelief. Had Malfoy just tried to make a joke?
that. Correct it
Harry scoffed, crossing his arms. “Fat chance, Malfoy. But we can try to be friends, I s’pose, if we don’t kill each other trying.”
“Pansy, I haven’t seen Draco in days. We had a--a fight, and I’m worried. Do you know where he is?”
“Dammit, Draco, it
His mind made up, Harry grinned and took Malfoy’s hand. “Please.”
Draco groaned and reached for his wand, his hands slipping a bit on the smooth wood. With a clumsy wave, he opened the window just enough for the owl and the letter it carried to slip through. The little thing flapped its wings about a bit more than before (perhaps it didn’t like the lemon bath oil Draco had chosen, but he was not about to vanish the perfumed steam for the sake of a bird).
“Yes, fine, my prat. Still a prat, though.”
So began the longest summer of Draco Malfoy’s life. He occupied himself with outfitting a luxurious new wardrobe (since he’d completely outgrown the old one), plotting how to restore the grandeur of the Malfoy family name, and practicing glamours to hide his creature markings. It seemed like years later that Draco swept into the Great Hall as he usually had, head held high and cronies close behind. As he always did now upon entering a room, he sifted through the scents around him. The scents of other creatures stood out from the rest, but the scent that meant
“Perhaps you should reply,
Harry Potter is perfectly able to take care of himself, thanks ever so. He eats what he needs to power his body, and rarely a chocolate frog more, despite Mrs. Weasley’s coaxing. Harry sleeps fitfully, but sufficiently, and exercises regularly. He orders Kreacher to clean Grimmauld Place, which the house elf mostly does, albeit with grousing and grinding of teeth. Harry tries not to snap at the customers in his store who are there just to buy yarn from
“You haven’t seen anything yet, Harry,” Draco promised.
Luckily, he had a perfect view of Draco’s bedroom door from where he sat on the hard chair. Harry squirmed a bit, wishing his boyfriend had purchased more comfortable furniture, but he hadn’t too long to think about it.
His neck was bent at an impossible angle, but Neville quickly came back down to earth. “What? Oh, yeah...I was busy looking at the ivy up on the walls. Did you know it’s poisonous to consume? So, er, don’t eat any.”
You are no doubt wondering why you are the one chosen to receive this piece of electronic mail. It is only natural to wonder; we haven’t spoken in years, and I am blessed with the widest and most dazzling circle of acquaintances the wizarding world has ever seen. However, you are the only person with whom I am acquainted who could reasonably possess an electronic mailbox.
Draco thought, tapping his foot and staring at yet another portrait of assorted colorful blobs. But, observing how Potter was drinking in an oddly geometric painting with obvious adoration, Draco was wise enough to keep his thoughts to himself.
“Just
Harry decided he was much too tired to trust his own brain at the moment, changed quickly, and hurried to Draco’s bed before he could think anymore.
She shot him a dark look. “Fair point, but that’s not what I meant, Finnegan. The singing is perfectly adequate; it’s the song selection that is lacking. Except for Weasley, who can’t sing at all--"
Harry stuffed the map back into his trunk and threw all his other belongings back on top. He toyed with the idea of conjuring something satisfyingly delicate to break, but settled for kicking the post of his four-poster bed until his foot hurt too much to continue. Draco was just doing this to get his attention; he’d come back eventually and start vying for Harry’s attention again. In all the worst ways, of course.
“You may.”
The common room was deserted in the half-light of dusk, so Hermione must have still been in her room. Boldness struck Harry, along with a wonderful idea.
"So, now I'm back to study homes here in England. You know, if their owners will let me," Harry joked.
Once Ron had safely apparated away (presumably to the Leaky, to settle his nerves with a pint), Harry turned his attention back to Malfoy. Who was beginning to twitch slightly. “So, Malfoy...is this a real business? It’s not, like some kind of joke or prank or something?” Harry was praying he would say yes, would say
“Alright, mate?” Ron asked, nudging his shoulder and shaking Harry out of his reverie. He and Hermione had made up to the point where they could sit on either side of Harry again, even if they still weren’t speaking.
“Fascinating,” Harry breathed.
At least they were if Draco would ever let them leave. The way he was fussing about reminded Harry a bit too much of Mrs. Weasley sending her brood off to Hogwarts. A fervent pat here, an indulgent smile there: it was all a bit Too Much.
Luna nodded sagely (at least, as sagely as she could in her sunset orange robes and matching fascinator). “That’s how it keeps evil spirits away. Not quite as well as marigolds, you know, but they’re out of season. Maybe next year.”
Malfoy half-sighed and half-laughed, a weary, relieved sound. “It is.” He looked so soft and open, more vulnerable than Harry had ever seen. Between one breath and the next, Harry leaned forward and kissed him.
“Mmm, my pretty, pretty mate,” Draco hummed, nuzzling into Harry’s neck for all his drunk self was worth. “I can smell my scent on you. S’nice.”
I just love Hermione so much
Hermione sighed. “Yes, exactly, Harry. More wine?”
“Why Potter, I’m flattered.” Malfoy teased, striking a pose and fluttering his lashes dramatically.
Harry,
Draco pressed a soft kiss to the pulse point on Harry’s neck. Harry, rigid with nerves, nudged Draco’s face nearer his own and met his lips. They were irresistibly soft. Harry wondered idly if he’d used a charm of some kind, but only sighed as he found himself yielding more and more. They snogged until Harry was breathless and panting, Draco eventually pulling away.
Draco smirked at him playfully over one shoulder, warm and brilliant. “Who said you weren’t allowed to touch?"
Malfoy folded his arms and pursed his lips in displeasure. “The special sauce is a
Rod only grinned vacantly and waved. “Hiya!”
Harry thought.
Blaise smirked. “You know, Potter hasn’t sung yet.” Hermione whacked him on the knee, but said nothing to stop him.
“Hey, it’s Pig!” Ron mumbled through a mouthful of scrambled eggs. “Must be Mum writing back.” Pigwidgeon landed near Ron and held out his letter, but there was another one attached to it. This one had Harry’s name written on it, in Mr. Weasley’s cramped handwriting.
Isn't the image of Draco and Harry making out in the foamy prefect's bathroom a lovely one? Now I'm dying to take a bath, even though my tub is nowhere near as nice. Let's be honest, no tub ever has been as nice as in the prefect's bathroom.
Hiding his horror beneath a mask of idleness, Draco glanced in the Gryffindork direction. Granger’s bushy braid, Weasley’s unsightly red mop, Potter’s halcyon of seemingly untameable hair… Well, at least someone had gone out and bought him clothes that fit for once. Horrible Muggle jeans, but still. Potter had been such an eyesore in previous years that Draco had never noticed what a nice arse he had. And...were those muscles straining at the seams of his tight sweater as he waved one hand about, gesturing at Finnegan? Had Potter always had those?
“I can’t believe you’re back. Didn’t your mum mind?”
“What--no! Just friends, normal friends!” Harry spluttered.
Malfoy’s face paled, but his words remained as posh and smooth as ever as he agreed, “I believe it is. Shall we adjourn to the library?” The room was now the size of a small automobile.
“Git. Close your eyes so I can get in.”
“Are you absolutely certain?” Harry smirked and closed the distance between them.
but the sheer sensation of Draco Malfoy resting against him in the most luxurious bubble bath ever drawn was far better than Harry could ever articulate.
Eight strides across the floor, one hop to avoid the creaky floorboard near the door, and eight strides back. After a few hours of pacing, Harry’s head still spun in tangled circles, but he’d decided on three things.
Malfoy’s head jerked up and his eyes widened in alarm. “Perhaps I could point you to the garden instead? The broderie around the back of the property is said to be
“Are your robes on fire, Weasley?” Malfoy drawled. “Or just your face? It’s traditionally considered polite to knock. However, since you’ve already barged in, the analysis is in my outbox there. You may have to brush by Pansy to get it, but I’m sure she won’t mind.”
Harry thought.
Instead, Potter grinned, quick and sharp. “Maybe. Anything to make you treat me like a friend instead of a client, Malfoy.”
The already enormous room must have been magically enlarged to fit everyone, as Harry couldn’t even glimpse the other end. Though the night was young, the dance floor was already dizzying with couples whirling about, in far brighter colors than the usual Hogwarts black. Most of the students were unfamiliar (Merlin, Hogwarts had changed), but Harry picked out a few recognizable faces in the crowd. Zabini twirled Parkinson and the heavy, sequined train of her dress effortlessly about the room, while a buttoned-up Goyle cringed as Millicent Bulstrode trod on his toes for what was surely the umpteenth time. Seamus was leading Dean in an exaggerated tango on the edge of the room, and Dean was laughing himself silly.
Harry decided to come back later. His two best friends were obviously, er, working through something, and he didn’t care to be dragged into it.
When the leg was satisfied that Harry was exactly where he ought to be, it disappeared behind the door again. Harry shivered with anticipation, ready for whatever was to come next. He loosened his shirt collar; surely it was warmer than it had been a few minutes ago.
“And to you, Potter,” Malfoy said, nodding at Harry’s Snitch & Stitch. “I’ve heard your establishment has become very popular.”
If asked later, Harry could never have said how long the two of them strolled together. Time seemed to melt into nothingness, marked only by measured steps and the crinkles around Draco’s eyes when he laughed. Harry still felt rather dreamy and drifting by the time he made it back inside. It was time for dinner, but he wanted to warm himself by the fire and talk to his best friends first.
To our most Sainted and Speccy Saviour,
The owl took flight again, and Harry followed its path to see it land at the Slytherin table. Malfoy gave the owl a treat and waved cheekily at Harry. He scowled back and roughly yanked the attached note out of the bouquet.
Unfortunately, Harry’s luck inevitably ran out. Just as Harry clattered out of the Charms classroom one day, already tugging the wadded fabric of his invisibility cloak from his school bag, someone yanked the cloak from his hand.
“Yes, of course. This week, Alfie learned the hard way why we cover the case of moonstones before locking up each night...”
Green eyes met grey as Potter weighed his options. Draco simply raised one arrogant eyebrow and took a long sip of his wine.
They continued turning in very small circles. Harry tried to follow the wall back to the other students, but he was a bit distracted. Malfoy’s white blond hair flashed bright in the afternoon sun, stealing Harry’s attention as he spun Parkinson in wide circles about the room. Rather than the stilted steps the other students were making, each of Malfoy’s movements were strong and sure. He was all grace and beauty, somehow making even Parkinson look good. As he waltzed about the room, Harry thought that he looked happy.
Draco rolled his eyes but kept sucking, reaching up one hand to play with Harry’s balls. Harry gave in, and white heat roiled through his body as he came down Draco’s throat. He swallowed it all and pulled off with a slight pop, looking ridiculously smug.

” Marta nodded, completed the transaction, and shoved the paper cup of soda in the witch’s hand as she edged toward the door.
“Lying doesn’t become you, Harry. Stop running away from me.”
"--and Draco, who tried to arouse some mysterious dark man who’s not even here, you’re all serenading each other anyway. Let’s make it a little more interesting,” she grinned, summoning an empty butterbeer bottle from the bin in the corner.
“So have I,” Malfoy whispered.
Merlin, his lips were soft. Their kiss felt like a blessing. Malfoy melted into him, and Harry’s hands pulled him closer. Strong arms, a ticklish spot at his side, even the particular crook of his shoulder blade...he loved it all. Malfoy sighed into his mouth, and something Harry hadn’t known he was missing clicked into place deep inside. He no longer felt the itch to study, the hunger to learn more. Maybe he had finally explored enough.
Harry stalked further into the Forbidden Forest, where the scent of loam and decay hung heavy in the air and strange creatures skittered at the edges of his field of vision. He knew Draco was behind him only by the sleek sound of his shoes in the damp grass. He judged they had walked far enough when the din of the party was only faintly audible, carried on the spring breeze.
? What was that about?
Harry dreamt about Malfoy almost every night now. They weren’t anything extraordinary; nothing like the dreams of choking on Fiendfyre and sooty, grasping arms that had haunted Harry shortly after the war. No, these dreams were horribly, wonderfully mundane: picking out quills at Scrivenshaft’s, or eating bacon butties and bickering about Quidditch.
,” Draco drawled, straightening his precious trousers and taking his seat again on a velvet cushion. Ignoring Harry’s amusement, he primly patted the corners of his mouth with a lace-edged napkin.
Finally Harry’s words began to sink in. Draco’s eyes widened and his handsome features hung ghastly with panic. “What?! Harry, I’m sorry, I can change, I just didn’t realize how strongly you felt about this--”
Harry rested his head carefully against the nook behind Malfoy’s ear and hummed, "You know, I think I could study your house for weeks. Months. Years, even."
Harry cringed at the mysterious brown goop inside, but covered it with a smile. “Nah, I’m stuffed. Thanks, Draco.”
Draco declared. “Follow me, love."
“Oh, that’s good. I’d hate to have to wait,” Harry said cheerfully, biting into an apple.
. You’ve heard of that one, right? Unfortunately, most retellings leave out the bloodthirsty bits, which are always the best parts in fairy tales. I’d recommend reading the real version some time.
Creating a home is a very specific kind of magic. Even for Muggles, each home has a certain feel, a particular mood. Some homes are warm and cozy, some squalid in a rather charming way, and others seem to be doing their best to defy categorization altogether, never remaining the same one day to the next.
Harry thought grimly as he stumbled on the winding path.
Harry shrugged and tugged his knit beanie down tighter on his unruly hair. “It’s fine, I’ll get something there. Lots of street food in London, it’ll be great.” Draco’s face was skepticism incarnate, but he offered Harry his arm regardless. Harry spun on his heel, and the two of them apparated to London. The square directly across from Grimmauld Place, specifically.
“Nah. See you ‘round.” Harry pulled again at his cloak, but couldn’t extract it from the other boy’s firm grasp. He settled for a cold glare instead.
Draco turned and held out one stiff hand. “Congratulations, Potter, this evening was not as torturous as I had anticipated. Owl me the time for our next rendezvous, and I’ll pencil you in. Good night.”
Harry bent down obediently and gentle hands placed the honeysuckle in his hair. Malfoy deftly arranged the blossoms around tufts of Harry’s unruly hair, winding the two together until he was satisfied.
His face, which had been so animated during his tale, fell slightly. “Regardless, I would like to apologize for my behavior. The emotions of an unmated dragon can be extraordinarily volatile. It’s not an excuse, only an explanation.” Malfoy waited for a response, but after a few moments, he prompted him. “Harry?”
Harry,” Malfoy snarled, latching on to Harry’s neck and sucking a dark love bite into the skin just below his jaw. “No one else’s.” A sound that couldn’t possibly have been a whimper fell from his lips, and Malfoy hummed quietly in appreciation. He dug his teeth into Harry’s neck on the next bite, and the razor-thin line between pleasure and pain was far too much to handle silently.
“Here, I have a list for you! One minute.” Hermione jumped up from the table and went to have a look, eventually finding it at the very bottom of her handbag. The list was short, barely six or seven names. Two in Cornwall, one in Surrey...and the very last residence happened to be Malfoy Manor.
Ron pretended to gag into his pint. “Mate. Can we please stop talking about Malfoy having sex? It’s putting me off, and I already ordered more chips.”
A bell chimed as they entered and a horribly familiar voice called out. "Hello, welcome to--Potter? Weasley?! Finally, someone who appreciates good food!" Draco Malfoy flew out from the back end of the restaurant, practically vaulting the counter in his enthusiasm to greet his new customers. He pumped each of their hands vigorously, grinning widely at each of them.
Hermione was snapped from her reverie by the temptation of a question to be answered. “It’s a type of biscuit. Go ahead, I think you’ll like it.” Harry lifted the lid of the box to reveal a rainbow of pastel-colored sandwich biscuits on a bed of rose-colored satin. He carefully bit into a cream-colored one, enjoying how the airy shell cracked beneath his teeth. Vanilla, with raspberry jam in the middle.
“Don’t lie to me, Potter. I know that you can’t stop thinking about it. Perhaps we should do something about that. ‘The very essence of romance is uncertainty,’ is it not?”
Harry was still stewing while closing up one night when the bell at the door chimed. “Sorry, we’re closed,” he called out.
To be fair, it’s not even Malfoy himself that vexes Harry; Malfoy had been a git in school, but he’d seemed alright in the years since. It’s just the way he lives, seemingly bragging about himself and his boy toys and his irritatingly flawless face with everything he does. It’s been happening for years now, but the trouble really started when Malfoy opened a boutique in Diagon Alley.
“Love, you’re going to kill me if you keep backing it up and I’m not allowed to touch,” Harry panted.
Harry shook his head, fighting back the sudden wetness in his eyes, and went back to pacing. Fuck Malfoy and his--his suprise snog! He’d figure this out if it was the last thing he ever did.
“Anything for Harry Potter!” The tiny elf squeaked. She carefully took the lavish vase and disappeared with a loud
Harry remained silent. God, those fuzzy little spider legs were hard to get down without puking. He’d already drained the tiny water cup dry, but he didn’t want to interrupt Malfoy to get more.
Tu me manqueras toujours: I will miss you always
Harry rolled his eyes and stood slightly more straight in front of the enormous three-paned mirror.
“Alright. To begin, I don’t think he’s been calling you his
“Merlin, ‘Mione, pull yourself together. It’s just a cloak, it’s not like he sacrificed his first born or did blood magic or anything!”
“Fine then, you try it! You’ll learn very quickly that I do not jest. Sit down and try a piping hot order of fried spidey, you’ll love it.” Before Harry could protest, Malfoy had shoved him into a shiny plastic booth and stalked over to the kitchen, ordering them to whip him up a deep-fried tarantula.
if they were printing these sorts of stories. When Potter’s tale ended, he began another, this one about dragon fang smugglers and a misplaced toe. To his great surprise, Draco’s boredom eased as Potter regaled him with stories about his latest exposé. It wasn’t until his second story had ended that Draco noticed their food had vanished, the check was waiting patiently on the table, and the server was waiting impatiently near the bar. Where had the time gone?
Ron Weasley turned faintly green, obviously wondering if Harry had actually seen Draco naked. He had no clue the lyrics were only about to get worse.
interested. Where are they?”
Please don’t worry about Scorp’s behavior. You must’ve read by now that I like both blokes and birds myself; the
After a few more confusing moves. Harry was spinning and spinning and spinning. Everything around him blurred, until suddenly Malfoy twined Harry’s arm about his neck and they were face to face. Harry’s breath hitched as Malfoy’s breath ghosted over his lips. He had never before noticed that ring of blue around each of Malfoy’s pupils, or the intensity of Malfoy’s expression as they stared at each other. Were there other things he’d failed to notice? All at once Harry’s body was curved in a delicate dip, and the dance was over.
He was awfully pretty, too...hmm.
“It’s the apron, isn’t it?” Malfoy asked, scowling at the floral print and beribboned sash.
I didn’t know you’d become a dad. Congratulations to you and your wife. How old is your son? Also, do you know what dad jokes are? Here’s one for you: why do bees have sticky hair? Because they use a honeycomb. Tell Scorpius, I bet he’d like it. (He can explain if you’re too thick to get it.)
Potter stuffed a forkful of shepherd’s pie into his trap and chewed thoughtfully. “I did try becoming an Auror. Everyone expected it of me, and I wasn’t sure what else to do. I made it through training, but I had to quit after my first raid.”
He heard Ron’s voice first. “Look, you know how I feel about...well, you, and about things. We’re done at Hogwarts in just a few months. I’m not saying we have to start a family right away, but maybe we should get married and see what happens? Mum always says--”
Malfoy's eyes practically popped out of his head. “Mal!” he bellowed. “What in the name of Salazar himself do you think you’re doing? Return the doors this very instant!”
He was encouraged by the house’s inviting appearance. Perhaps it would like him, even if Malfoy didn’t. Harry screwed up his courage and rapped on the door of Malfoy Manor.
Hermione gasped. “Harry, that’s a courting gift! You can’t just pass them off to anyone who walks by!”
markings). Surely his mother would have risen by now, and they had much to discuss.
Harry shrugged. “Might as well.” He wasn’t at all looking forward to the long walk back to Hogwarts and could use a rest.
The countless owls from Malfoy did not. The first owl brought an achingly polite note:
Everything seemed peaceful the following day. No Potters storming through his door and no fluffy, grumpy owls clattering at the window. But when Draco left the shop the following night, Potter was waiting for him under the streetlight across the way. He was swathed in such a heavy cloak that he seemed more wool than man. Despite the thick cloth, Draco picked up the familiar scent of his mate.
“Oh, right. I guess the spectators couldn’t see much anyway. Well, in the Triwizard Tournament, I met them during the second task…”
“Oh, thank Merlin,” Neville sighed in relief, setting down the book. Yet Seamus kept talking.
Harry still didn’t quite understand why he’d fled from Malfoy again, but he didn’t allow himself to think about it. Time passed slowly. Harry had time to knit a long cashmere scarf in palest grey, a jumper for Hermione, and several jewel-toned dragons for a shop display. Really, it was only a week or two, but he had a lot of frustration to work through. Knitting helped.
Harry barely recognized his own voice when he spoke, strangled as it was. The blond man turned, and fierce grey eyes met Harry’s. Of course it was his long-lost dragon mate
upside down.
He’d have to figure out how to explain those, too.
Harry had never been more grateful for the Marauder’s Map. Just as he had used it to observe Malfoy in sixth year, he used it to avoid him now. He barged into each class just as each professor began instruction, and sat sandwiched between Ron and Hermione. As each class ended, he ran out the door and down the hall as fast as he could. Food was swiped from the kitchens (though it wasn’t swiping so much as regularly enjoying tea with the house elves), and all owls or other attempts at communication were thoroughly ignored. Harry felt practically invincible! Enveloped in invisibility as he always was, there was no possible way for Malfoy to catch him.
Hot fury flashed through Harry’s core. He batted Draco’s finger away from his mouth and glared. “Fine, if you say so. But you don’t want me to see my friends. I know you’re sensitive to the smell of anyone else on me, but it’s not like I’m not going to see them. Ron and Hermione are like family to me, and I love all of my other friends too.”
“Happy Christmas, Hermione,” a quiet voice insinuated.
He looked unearthly and beautiful in the half-light of the closed store as he slowly approached Harry.
Twining brick walkways were far too complicated for Harry to recall, but Malfoy led them with sure steps. They came to a shaded lea, where the rocks were covered with verdant moss and a perfectly stereotypical picnic waited in stasis. Malfoy gestured broadly before them, and waited for Harry’s answering smile. A breath later, a warm hand was at Harry’s cheek, and he leaned into the thumb following the line of his cheekbone. Malfoy pulled Harry close, and Harry allowed himself to be led. Malfoy’s lips brushed whisper-soft against his own. He tasted of honey and man, and Harry’s heart broke just a little. Despite how lovely this was, despite his longing to stay in a walled garden with a sunny, yielding Malfoy forever, none of this was real. Real Malfoy was moody and clingy and would scorn blissful refuge, away from the world. And Real Malfoy would never permit any wrinkles to darken his doorway, much less his shirt.
“Oh...drunk.” Harry groaned, slumping against the doorjamb. He’d run away
“About Malfoy? I don’t know, Harry, but I suppose we can talk about it.” Hermione signed her name with a flourish at the bottom of an excessively long essay and finally gave Harry her full attention. “So. What do you want to do?”
Ron nodded, reached past Parkinson to scoop up the tidy file, and collided with the doorjamb on his way out the door. He straightened up and tried again, making it successfully out the door and doing his best to ignore the giggling behind him. Once he was safely back in his office, he threw the file on the desk and inspected the soup stain from earlier. Dammit, he still smelled of cream of broccoli. He’d have to change before tonight.
“Indeed,” Malfoy hummed sleepily. “Pass me a strawberry, will you? Since the manor went to all this trouble.” Harry took a chocolate-covered strawberry and held it to Malfoy’s parted lips. He bit into it with a satisfied sigh, one that Harry longed to hear again. Juice trickled down Harry’s hand, and he licked it off, chasing each drop. He swirled his hand in the water to disperse the stickiness and stroked Malfoy’s thigh along the way. Accidentally, of course.
. You’re not allowed to let anyone else touch you, only me.”
He waggled his eyebrows suggestively. “How did you know?” The tension broke, and Pansy couldn’t help giggling.
“Yeah...er, how many more days of this are there again? These just keep getting bigger and more expensive. I’m a bit worried he’s going to try to give me an actual dragon,” Harry said, fishing around in the bag and finally locating an ornate golden stand. He desperately hoped it wasn’t actual gold, but inside he knew better.
Harry raked one hand through his shaggy hair. “So, just to sleep?”
“You tosser,” Harry teased. “Guess you don’t get your flowers after all.”
Hermione smiled ruefully. “No. They’re dragons.” She splayed out the large book in front of them, pointing to faded illustrations of a blond woman and an imposing black dragon standing beside each other. Age had yellowed and faded the parchment, but Harry could still see the obvious care with which they regarded each other. A village wreathed in flame was on the facing page. The Malfoy crest was embossed in the corner of the parchment.
Dean Thomas was next, with a respectable rendition of “Bust a Move”. When had he learned to twerk? But then Granger derailed everything, staring directly at Blaise as she warbled something about kisses and hiking. Ugh. Pansy had counted on Blaise to get the evening back on track, but no, he had to perform “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” for Granger. She hoped the original singer was rolling in his grave. It had been a colossal mistake to show Blaise 10 Things I Hate About You last week, he was barely a Slytherin anymore.
“Do you like it? I thought jasmine and lemon would be nice.”
* * *
Harry stood behind Pansy’s entourage and waited for them to notice him. “Pansy, can I have a word? Outside, please.”
Draco considered this carefully before conceding, “Well...not usually.”
Harry was wrenched from his thoughts when Ron elbowed him getting up from the table. Oh! The feast had ended, and Harry was the only one left seated at Gryffindor table. He clumsily got up and followed the other students out of the Great Hall. He was about to follow the other Gryffindors up to the tower when he realized he had no idea where the eighth year dorm was located. Luckily, Professor Vector was waiting at the bottom of the staircase with the other eighth years.
Draco laughed breathlessly from his squashed position against Harry’s broad chest. “My, if I had known this would be my welcome, I’d have returned much sooner. Did you miss me that much already?”
that.” He huffed in frustration, clenching his fist. “I have to be so
“You’ll let me know when you need more, yeah?” Rosmerta asked, beaming at Harry and completely ignoring Draco.
“Have some porridge, Harry,” Hermione suggested, ladling a large dollop into a bowl and placing it before him. “Porridge always helps.” Harry grunted again and stuck a spoon in the thick porridge, but didn’t eat. He wasn’t hungry.
“Call it research,” Harry said, rolling up his sleeves. “But I’m definitely intrigued. I think we should go see what it wants. I mean, a house that composes poetry? I’ve never heard of anything like that! Your house is bonkers, Malfoy.”
As the winter hols grew closer, Draco and Harry spent more and more time together. It felt so natural, just how it had been before the whole
every time I’ve seen you. You have no idea how frustrated I’ve been. So I am going to take my time with you. Lay back and enjoy it.”
Malfoy chuckled a little and nudged Harry back. “Unexpectedly, I’m not quite sure. It is a true luxury to be able to plan ahead, to dream. It’s one I never thought I’d have again. If anyone had told me this time last year that I’d be sitting here with you, discussing our future, I’d have thought them absolutely barmy. But to answer your question: I enjoy Potions, and my family owns a variety of enterprises, but I’m waiting to hear about something else before I make any decisions. It’s very important, but I can’t make any other choices until I hear about it.”
“What! Let me taste it,” Hermione said, taking the sloshing goblet from his hand and sipping it hesitantly. “Oh! I was going to object, but that’s quite good.”
He turned to face Draco. Even in the velvet half-darkness of the forest, he stood broad and tall. His features were clearly visible in the moonlight, radiating bewilderment.
"Awww,” Luna cooed from her spot on the large floor pillow.
“The library is this way,” Malfoy murmured shakily. He led Harry back through the blue hallway, over a transparent bridge that Harry didn’t trust not to shatter, and into a dark wood-paneled wing of the house. The door he opened next revealed a cozy library, full of books and squashy sofas and a crackling fireplace.
“I know, Potter. I can read, you know,” an irritatingly posh voice drawled.
. He was fast, too. Harry tried to reach for his wand, but it was trapped in his tight jeans pocket. The school seemed to be empty, as all of its other residents hid from the bitter cold. No one was able to rescue Harry, but at least no one saw him being lugged about like a sack of potatoes.
"Of course, Potter. Quality attracts quality. I am the epitome of grace and luxury myself, why should I accept anything less? Come, I’ll show you to the back room."
“Well, I didn’t
“I guess. I mean, sometimes I want to--he is
“Oi! Glad you two finally decided to show up. Get caught up in adjusting your cufflinks, did you?” Ron grinned, punching Harry’s shoulder in a friendly way. The charcoal gray dress robes he wore looked much better than his previous horribly lacy set, but Harry figured Ron would always look vaguely uncomfortable in fancy clothes.
Harry’s jaw dropped. Was Draco actually singing about his cock? It was probably for the best that he hadn’t sung this at karaoke, or Harry would have dragged him offstage and fucked him against the wall in the bathroom like the caveman he felt himself becoming. Fast and dirty, while Draco begged for more…. Dammit. Singing that other song in those bloody leather trousers had been bad enough. At least they were alone this time.
“Why the bloody hell--”
“...Right. Good on you, Luna. Hey, d’you see McGonagall?” Ron snickered, pulling at his tight necktie. “What’s going on over there? I think Dean spiked the punch.”
Eventually, Harry noticed the ball was beginning to wind down. Crumpled napkins and abandoned punch goblets littered the tables, and the last few couples on the dance floor hung heavy from each other’s shoulders.
The next room was bright, bright, bright. It took Harry’s eyes a moment to adjust, but he was enchanted by what he saw. Early autumn sunlight slanted through the crystalline glass walls of a conservatory, illuminating beds overflowing with white blossoms. Perfume-heavy roses in blushing shades of pink and cream preened near the center of the garden, where an elaborate tea set shone on a small marble table.
* * *
Draco took a deep breath, and the marks around his eyes slowly faded. He was once again just a boy, if an outlandishly attractive one. “I see. I am disappointed, of course, but I will do my best to keep you. After all, I have to demonstrate how wonderful holidays at the manor can be.” Cinnamon and sugared plums seemed to scent the air as Draco extolled the many virtues of a Malfoy Christmas. “You haven’t truly celebrated Yule until you’ve tried the Malfoy version of
One chapter left! Thank you for reading.
“Harry, your face is awfully red. Are you alright? What did you want to talk about?” Hermione asked, concern evident in her eyes.
Draco nipped off a microscopic piece of roll and chewed consideringly. “Oh. That is surprisingly edible.”
Harry half-laughed, but there was no joy in it. “Sounds harsh, but yeah. At least not how you are now.” His face grew solemn again. “I’m sorry, Draco, but we’re not good for each other.”
“Not really.” The other students were beginning to stare, so Harry hastily whispered. “Come on, I’ll tell you back in our room.”
* * *
. “Yeah, why are you here? The table for slimy gits is on the other side of the hall.”
Harry halted at the end of the library corridor, in front of a surprisingly graphic tapestry of Ceridwen’s Cauldron. He really had no idea where to go next. He wandered around the castle for a few hours, and eventually ended up back in the eighth-year common room with Hermione.
“What’s th--
* * *
“What!” he sputtered, tightening his hold on the blond in his lap. “Where are you going?”
Harry wilted onto the bed behind him. “So that wasn’t just some pureblood thing? Or a spell gone wrong?”
Ron knelt down next to Harry, who was very embarrassed to discover himself splayed on the floor of the Great Hall and
“I mean it, Pans,” Draco insisted, his eyes oddly serious. “It’s most important to be happy.”
. He remembered there was something he had to talk to Draco about, but couldn’t remember….oh yes, that’s what it was.
Potter reached out and took hold of his sleeve. “Wait, Malfoy! I hate to do this, but…you owe me a life debt.” He hesitated. “I wish to ask a boon in exchange, which you are required to grant me.”
Harry flushed. He’d said that so conversationally, almost the way friends spoke to each other, and Harry was only further confused. “I don’t. Speak it, that is. Fleur--er, Bill Weasley’s wife--just slips into it every once in a while. I know a few words, that’s all.”
“It just won’t go away! Vanishing spells, Owls, even the Muggle mail, nothing works!” Harry had complained to Hermione at their last pub night. She’d stopped picking at her chips, pushed her intricate braids away from her face, and fixed him with an exasperated look.
Do you like it? It’s not exactly the Slytherin common room, but I did borrow their view. Isn’t it entrancing?”
“It’s laughing,” Malfoy explained with a wry smile.
Malfoy smiled. “I know precisely what you mean. It was much the same for me when I decided to return.”
“You’re a good dancer,” Harry slurred. “Wan’ come home wi’ me? There’s no one else there.”
In the blink of an eye, Harry was laden with silk and leather and wool. Draco shoved him into a dressing room and told him to “change quickly, we’ve a lot to get through.”
Harry, torn as he was between an exasperated sigh and a laugh, expressed himself with another sharp thrust. "Of course you did. Well, you do know
“Do you like it?” Potter whispered, low in his ear. Having forgotten the man was so close, Draco flinched a bit. He usually didn’t permit anyone to remain in his personal space; how had he so easily forgotten that Potter was there?
he told himself,
His mouth pulled and tugged at Harry’s own, biting his lower lip so harshly that it made him gasp. A foreign tongue took advantage of that and thrust inside Harry’s mouth, hot and demanding. He tasted iron and blood and lemon. His head spun with befuddlement, but it still felt far better than any other kiss he’d ever had.
“I thank you, Draco. But that’s precisely how you praised me two weeks ago,” she replied, her eyes twinkling.
about? Had someone slipped him a lust potion or something? Maybe Smith had fired a spell when Harry wasn’t looking, something that would make Malfoy instantly lose his mind. Harry frantically cast his eyes about the room, searching for alternate exits or clues or for anything that would help turn things right side up again.
Harry laid his head on the bed. It was spinning again. This had been happening a lot lately. “Oh no. Do you think we were ever really friends?”
“‘Mione, what should I
Harry
Harry Potter
All of their school-day competitiveness rose to Harry’s mind, and he went after the Snitch with a vengeance. But this time there was a playful edge to it, a blunted edge to the knife-like thrill. They played two games of seeker’s Quidditch, each winning one and lording it over the other. After the second game, Malfoy spotted a door hidden in an odd little nook behind a hedge. They landed, left their brooms on the pitch, and cautiously passed through the door.
Harry rolled his eyes and stalked over to the brooms, selecting a vintage Firebolt. He kicked off the ground and hovered in the air.
“Why aren’t you surprised?” Harry asked suspiciously.
“Oh no. Guess he’s serious after all.”
Harry shook his head. “No, not this year. Hogwarts is my home, I want to spend one last Christmas here.”
“What do you think you’re doing?” Malfoy asked sharply.
Pansy smirked, pretending to toast him with her drink. “Give the man a prize. I’ve only been trying to get Draco to admit it for a month, but I know it’s been longer than that.”
“Actually, some wixen have debated that it was Harry’s natural charisma--” Luna began before Hermione cut her off.
The biscuits they’d made together had followed them through the door and arranged themselves in pretty heaps on a tiered tray. Wedges of perfectly ripe peaches bobbed in a luxuriant tray of sugared cream, and a warm teapot smelled deliciously fragrant.
With all the time you’re spending at the library, what else have you learned how to do on the computer? There’s lots of recipes, the Muggle news, social media, etc.
Harry finally gave him a reluctant response. “I’ll think about it. But no promises.”
* * *
“Spread your legs, Potter.” Malfoy ordered.
. Now hush...you asked for this, so just listen.” He cleared his throat and began to sing, low and sultry.
Harry shook his head. Even Dream-Malfoy was charmingly capricious. "Lead the way, then."
They followed the professor’s pointy red hat down a long hallway behind the stairs until they reached a painting of a dark-haired witch with limpid eyes. She perked up when she saw them, smiling gently from her perch on a stone bench before a pond of magenta and lavender blossoms. Harry immediately liked her very much.
“Oh...it’s you.”
Hermione turned another page of the dusty tome she was perusing. “Yes, I think I will. It is our last year as students here, after all.”
“Good afternoon, Potter,” he drawled. “I heard you may have an answer for me.” Malfoy was trying to be patient, and his face was as smooth and expressionless as ever, but his leg jittered awkwardly. Having finally made a decision, Harry felt oddly calm.
Harry hummed noncommittally, trying not to think about how warm Malfoy’s hands felt. He failed when Malfoy’s hands settled on his hips, measuring them slowly and carefully. One thumb carefully brushed his hip bone under the guise of straightening the tape. Harry gulped as he felt himself growing hard.
Please take your seat.” His mother indicated the chair across from hers with an elegant gesture, practiced over long years of presiding over the manor.
It may have been just the power of suggestion, but even Pansy had to admit that Potter looked rather sexy as he sang. His blue shirt had been half-unbuttoned all night, and the tan chest beneath glistened with a light sheen of sweat. Rather than staring at the back wall, a silly smile was creeping across his face as he tapped one foot to the beat.
“Good effort, Louis. But I believe I instructed you to pronounce it spee-eye-dees. You know, just like those Muggles on the interwebs.”
A frustrated Harry raked one hand through his unruly hair. Stupid Malfoy, ruining everything! The halls would be full of students rushing to lunch shortly. He knew he couldn’t avoid this conversation with his former friend forever. But if he was forced to have it, it certainly wouldn’t take place in front of the entire student body. “Fine. Outside, now.”
“That didn’t feel like Legilimency,” he muttered. “That was accidental. But who…?” As Draco tried to slow his heartbeat, to assess his symptoms, he felt a longing he hadn’t noticed before. A slight pull to the southwest, perhaps?
Their Christmas Eve was a very quiet one, spent together in front of the common room fire. Rather than sitting through a silent Christmas feast with the few others who had stayed over the holidays, they asked the house elves to bring up a selection of the foods they liked best: fluffy dinner rolls with plenty of jam; bacon-dressed sprouts (since Hermione had insisted on at least one veg); wedges of sweet golden oranges; thick ham sandwiches, slathered with spicy mustard; and, of course, a tray of mini treacle tarts.
Cold grey eyes inexplicably smiled, becoming liquid and warm. “You’re different too, Potter. I suppose we’ve all changed."
“No. I adore Mother, but we each prefer having our own space. And living in London is much more convenient for working at the shop.”

have asked the Ministry’s Department of Unusual Magic Phenomena to continue to fund your studies here in England, and they tripped all over themselves saying yes. They gave me the list of sentient homes and agreed to pay for whatever you need, as long as you publish the results of what you find.”
I promise you won’t regret it.”
“No.”
Without another word, Draco hastily entered his home, shut the door behind him, and leaned back against it. His mate had desired a kiss. He hadn’t wanted to risk it, but the dragon within him had been delighted. Draco would never admit it to another soul, but he had almost said yes.
“Draco, just fuck me already.”
(Photo description: Harry is doing bicep curls in front of a mirror at the gym and staring at the mirror with smoldering eyes. His arms are about as big around as Draco’s head, and his shoulder-to-waist ratio is insane. Everything not encased in tight leggings is bronzed and buff and gleaming. Draco moans a bit just looking at it.)
The Three Broomsticks was quiet. It wasn’t a Hogsmeade weekend for the younger students, so tables were dotted with an older couple here, a traveler there.
Draco peered up at the foreboding building. “Why have we come to the old Black residence?”
"Guess this one’s for you then, Malfoy.”
illuminated the mirror before him, and he recoiled in shock. The man in the mirror before him was not Draco Malfoy.
Ron smiled, following his lead. “Oh, Pansy says hi,” he said, wiping the foam from his mouth.
Malfoy’s mouth twitched, and his eyes gleamed with amusement. Harry tried to think what he had done to cause that expression, but he’d only asked a perfectly normal question. “Yes, that’s exactly what it means. I wasn’t aware you spoke French, Potter. Pick up a new language over the summer hols?”
“It says abstract art is supposed to look at ‘non-objective artistic elements’ and ‘encourage imagination,’” Potter had explained when he had complained, peering closely at one of the plaques on the wall.
When Harry returned a few hours later (staying out rather longer than he would have liked on the frigid Quidditch pitch, but it was worth it to avoid an irate Hermione), he peeked through the cracked door to see if it was safe to return. Luckily, the dust seemed to have cleared. Hermione was studying in Harry’s desk chair as Ron packed his trunk to go home for the holidays.
Malfoy grasped his bouquet tightly, and they stepped through the door into an empty room. Honey-colored wood floors glowed, and the crystal chandelier above threw handfuls of rainbows through the room. Oddly enough, the sunbaked view visible through the room’s many windows was definitely nowhere near Wiltshire. Gnarled olive trees guarded stands of lavender, and a craggy cliff fell to a blue, blue sea.
“Won’t your parents miss you?” Harry wondered.
Yes, I knew that Muggles have libraries. I didn’t go very often as a kid, but I always liked how quiet they were. And the librarians always shushed my cousin. That’s why we stopped going, but still.
“Doubt Ron’ll be very excited about it, but yes. Thanks, ‘Mione!” Harry practically ran into Ron as he barreled through the door, but narrowly avoided collision and shot him a cheeky grin.
“It’ll be okay, ‘Mione. Things can only get better, right? Cheers, Ron,” Harry said, taking a deep draught of his ale.
“About what?” Harry asked, really only half-paying attention as he dug through his bag.
He waited, idly stroking Rod’s back. Only needy whines escaped the man as he tried to rock against the hard table, but Malfoy held him firmly in place. He sighed. “I see. You’re too far gone. I suppose I’ll take mercy on you this one time.”
Harry furrowed his brow. Why was Malfoy being so mysterious? Maybe it was some kind of pureblood arranged marriage thing. That thought sent a pang through Harry’s heart, and he hurried to rearrange his face before Malfoy could notice..  “Hmm. Do you know when you’ll hear about the something else?”
“Oh. Well, I did some poking around, and I found some places you might want to study here. If you’re interested,” Hermione said, peeking coyly at him beneath her lashes.
“I suppose so,” Malfoy replied, leveling a bemused stare at the biscuits. “And nothing was incinerated. Congratulations, Potter.” A puff of floury, vanilla-scented air rushed through the kitchen, causing much coughing and eye watering. When the two men had recovered, a green baize door had appeared, tucked into a little cranny behind the gleaming range.
Harry sat up. He hadn’t made that last sound. An intimidating eagle owl had dropped a heavy, fluted glass vase next to his head. Overwhelmingly heady scents wafted from the coal black lilies and twining white flowers within. A rolled scroll was attached to the nodding head of the largest lily.
“Yes, ma’am,” Harry chuckled as he pulled a sputtering Draco to the dance floor.
, literally the only person in the world meant to make me happy.”
Cold sweat slicked every inch of Harry’s body when he woke, strangled by his sheets. He had to find Draco. He’d put this off as a last resort, but he knew just who to ask. She was terrifying, but Harry needed answers.
Harry scoffed, willing his palms not to sweat. “Course not. Are you?”
Draco Malfoy, putting the romance in Romance languages since 1980.
A bead of sweat rolled down Harry’s forehead. Merlin, had it always been so hot in their room? Harry cast a dirty look at the blazing fire and waved his wand to extinguish it. Yet he was still burning up from Malfoy’s touch, so he ripped off his thick woolen jumper and tossed it on the bed. He had to
“No. Potter’s your mystery man, isn’t he?”
I could take you shopping for a mobile if you like. What if you bought the wrong kind? I think you need a guide. We could eat at mine after. I’m not much of a cook, but there’s a great Indian takeaway nearby.
“Then it must be worth repeating.”
That night, Harry again dreamed of Malfoy in a walled garden. Where once had been light and life, he only saw desiccation and ruin. Bitter fear wormed into his heart. He jogged through the garden’s winding paths, skidding against dusty bricks and tripping over arid vines. He knew he was searching for Draco.
“Oh, the manor makes you a Quidditch pitch once and I’m stuck with you?” He laughed, and it was round and warm against Harry’s chest. “I
“Ugh, he really loves silk. I bet he even buys silk pants,” Harry muttered to himself, holding up the robes to himself in the long mirror.
Malfoy held out one hand. “I do hope you’ll allow me to lead.” Harry’s stomach flipped as it registered the hope on Malfoy’s handsome face. Perhaps he’d planned all of this as some twisted way to woo or mock Harry?
“Mate, are you dating the ferret?” Ron sputtered. Hermione rolled her eyes.
Potter narrowed his eyes, inspecting Draco closely. “You don’t like this conversation, though. Why?”
“Remove your shirt,
Harry fiddled with the frayed sleeve of his sweater, half-turning to face his boyfriend. "I mean, there’s always next year? I love Hogwarts over the holidays, and I don't want to leave Hermione alone."
Now, after touring that Muggle museum, Potter was attempting to talk him to death. In public, where he couldn’t escape. Draco knew several spells that would have similar effects and didn’t understand why Potter would be prolonging his torture. Why would Potter insist on updating him on the activities of each Weasley over the past seven years? Had he never been on a second date before? And had there always been this many Weasleys? Salazar, they multiplied like rabbits; no wonder they had dubbed their home the
"All right then." Harry shared the meandering tale of how he’d come to study sentient houses. He had intended to share a summarized version, but Malfoy was a surprisingly good listener, laughing or gasping in all the right places. Unfortunately, Harry eventually came to the end.
“What a welcome home,” Harry chuckled, relaxing into the sofa’s plush cushions. It was awfully pleasant there in the library, with the cheery fire and sunlight streaming through a large picture window. The light glancing off his feathery eyelashes and finely molded cheekbones made Malfoy resemble a prince in a children’s picture book. Had he posed in the light like that on purpose? Harry winced at his own fancifulness and turned his attention away from Malfoy’s pointy face, back to their conversation.
Something silvery shimmered in the corner of his eye. Harry scowled. Of course the dragon bracelet was back. Even seven years later, no matter how often Harry tried sending it back to the Malfoys, it reappeared. Hiding it in cupboards or wedging it under his mattress didn’t work; it always dug itself out, sparkly as ever, as if it wanted to be noticed. (Six minutes was the current record.) Harry had gotten lazy and had tried to owl it this time, but the tawny owl had returned, confused and empty-taloned, after the bracelet had presumably vanished halfway through its flight. He’d even drop-kicked it over the bloody gate of Malfoy Manor once, but of course the bloody thing had been waiting for him on his dresser, shiny and perfect as ever, by the time he got home.
“Oi, keep that to yourself, eh? We’re in public, Draco,” Harry whispered softly into Draco’s ear before batting his hand away. His head was down on the table,
Harry was so entranced by Draco’s pert and perfect cheeks that he barely heard him call out, “Now, come and eat something. Have you ever had prosciutto with melon? It’s delightful, you’ll love it...”
, Draco!” Harry yelled as he finally reached his peak. Blinding stars streaked across his mind, leaving only the palest remnants of stardust in his thoroughly sated body.  Draco’s thrusts became erratic and jerky before he cried out a moment later, something wordless and feral. He pulled out of Harry quietly, sank back against his many pillows, and cast a wandless cleaning charm over them both with the flick of one precise wrist. Harry rolled over and gathered his lover close, covering them in rumpled linen sheets.
Harry waved a hand absentmindedly in Ron’s direction. “Oh, the toast is for Parkinson. But Malfoy’s definitely suspicious. Look how shifty he looks--”
“Draco, no,” Harry hissed into Draco’s ear. Sharp disappointment flared in Harry’s chest as he pushed Draco’s hand away again and scooted to the other side of the booth, but he quickly tamped it down. He was drunk, after all. It wasn’t Draco’s fault that he couldn’t bloody listen.
Instead of reacting to his host’s sneer, Harry frowned. “Merlin, what happened to your hair?”
“Not my fault your pajamas have too many buttons. Nothing wrong with a tee.” Harry shoved the pajama sleeves up to his elbows and clambered into bed. He arranged himself around his boyfriend’s body and curled up so he could sleep in the crook of Draco’s neck, his head on Draco’s shoulder.
Malfoy’s expression did not change, but his ears slowly blossomed a bright pink. “I think not. It’s painful enough for me to carouse around with your pack of drunken monkeys; I wouldn’t subject him to such torture.”
He thought it his own voice for a moment, until he recalled that Professor Slughorn had always acted ambivalently toward him. And a
“Mate, your mortal enemy just leaped over a fucking table to check you were alright. Something’s definitely off,” Ron said, shaking his head as he helped Harry up.
Draco was practically vibrating with excitement, far too much to sit. “Mother. I have a mate after all. I’ve gone through the inheritance, finally; there could be no mistaking that.” He grimaced, recalling the pain of transformation, before he went on. “But why would this be happening now?”
“Oh. Er, I guess it wouldn’t hurt to at least look for the door, right?”
“Malfoy.
Hermione chuckled and batted him over the head with the sock she was knitting. “Ronald, don’t act so surprised. You were the one flouncing around in that flashy cloak and eating the leftover macarons, you knew this was a possibility.”
Harry could feel bile rising in his throat. “Yuck.”
Smith scoffed, then gifted Harry with a smarmy smile, as if to say,
“He doesn’t even like toast,” Harry murmured. At least he managed to take a bite of muffin this time.
Yet there was one thing more surprising than Malfoy’s constant appearance in Harry’s presence: Harry had decided he rather liked being Draco Malfoy’s friend. Apparently Slytherin house, seemingly full of snobby purebloods bent on achieving greatness, also highly valued the trait of loyalty. Malfoy soon became a firm friend to Harry. He always had an extra quill if Harry needed one, and offered to help him study for Potions.
readers expect him to be. Harry doesn’t talk much about being gay, and he especially doesn’t discuss his strong preference for bottoming. It’s a part of him, but not something that defines him. Unfortunately, it does seem to be how Malfoy defines himself, and he and his Hunk of the Week seem bent on shoving it in everyone’s faces.
was as surprised as he’d been.
“Really? But Ron learned. He opened the Chamber, remember?”
After an hour or so, Harry watched as his body lurched away from the bar. Apparently he was drunk and lonely enough to brave the dance floor after all. Harry’s body stumbled through the crowd, finding an open space in one corner. Green light flashed overhead as Harry’s arms rose and his hips swayed to the thumping bass. It felt so good to let go, to let his mind float free, even if he had to dance alone.
A large velvet pouch waited at the Gryffindor table the following morning. A heavy silver cord secured a parchment scroll to the bag, and of course it had Harry’s name on it.
The walk had been very warm, so Harry stopped to catch his breath and admire the house. Rather than being dark and imposing, the whole place seemed to exude light. Cream-colored walls welcomed Harry in, and rounded towers that begged him to come up and explore.
The vein in Ron’s forehead was still throbbing, but his mouth had dropped open and showed no sign of closing any time soon. Hermione had the good grace to keep her mouth closed, but she was gnawing on her lower lip as though it were a sugar quill, her eyes fixed on Malfoy across the hall.
“No, I’m
“Oh, nothing really. Maintaining our family businesses, avoiding the press and certain unsavory suitors, a bit of redecorating…the hedge maze in particular required severe restoration.” Malfoy seemed very pleased to have been asked about himself and was clearly warming to his topic, but he was interrupted by a large portrait of a ship falling from the wall.
His first feeling was one of uncomfortable warmth. Intense irritation quickly followed. Having already kicked off the covers, he stripped off his pajama top and lay back across the open bed.
Before he could decide if Malfoy was taking the piss or not, a mountain of a man emerged from the door behind Malfoy. Harry really tried not to gawk, but this man looked like he could snap someone in half like a bowtruckle without a second thought.
The library computers won’t access Instagram? It’s not depraved, but that’s probably for the best. I’ll attach a photo from the account I mentioned, but you really should get your own Internet access. Maybe a mobile phone. You could take your own pictures, or even call me sometime. No magic or library access required.
Harry’s blood ran cold. His trust in Draco was still new and fragile, and he prayed the other boy wouldn’t do anything to destroy it again. “Really.”
The Malfoy conservatory was Narcissa Malfoy’s territory, a kingdom over which she alone held utter sway. Even her lord and husband had only ever been a guest within its walls and under its boughs. Narcissa had taken possession of it upon her marriage into the family and made it a dangerous paradise. She had spent so many hours in the conservatory that its walls were imbued with her presence. Each plant, from the greenest blossom to the thickest vine, whispered of her magic.
No one had ever mentioned sentient houses to Harry Potter until his eighth year at Hogwarts. He always thought he’d only imagined Grimmauld Place growing more damp and dark with each visit, or the Burrow’s teetering stories multiplying every few years. To learn otherwise...well, Harry was hooked. Unfortunately, the topic was only a footnote to a throwaway remark in a long Charms lecture. Flitwick was not at all prepared to answer Harry’s barrage of questions and even glanced to Hermione for help. His wrinkled brow began to sweat, and he conjured a blanket-sized paisley handkerchief to dab at it.
Draco would never talk back to his mother, but he would grit his teeth in subtle frustration as he summoned a quill and ink. He quickly penned a cold response and tied it to the fluffy owl. He desperately hoped to never see it again.
“Alright, forget I asked. You can go back to counting now.”
Fair warning, Ron's going to seem like a real jerk for a bit. Sorry about it.
“Touché,
Glancing at the man next to her, Pansy knew Draco’s face was pinking delicately. Apparently she hadn’t been the only one to know about his fondness for skirts and lace.
“Er, yes. I can’t promise I’ll be your mate,” Harry said slowly. “But I guess we could give this--us--a try.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“You’ve finally noticed. How magnanimous of you, Potter. You know, I think I’ll do you for free.” Malfoy cocked his head, smirking at the stunned look on Harry’s face. “Your robes, of course. The Git Who Lived wearing my clothes is the best publicity one could desire.”
Louis sighed. “Welcome to Spee-eye-dees, how can I help you?”
I was going to wait until Friday, but I had this chapter ready to go and couldn't wait any longer. Thank you for reading!
“Are you sure? It’s quite cold--”
“Right.” A long blond curl had fallen in front of Malfoy’s face, dangling like so many silken threads before Harry’s eyes.
Hermione had sat back after reading the letter, her hands clasped together and an uncharacteristically dreamy look on her face. “Oh, the Dordogne...I’ve always wanted to go there.” Hermione mused, a wistful look in her eye. “Nice was lovely, but the
The years had been gentle to Narcissa Malfoy. She glanced up at her son as he entered, and a smile ghosted across her features. (It would never dare stay longer, for fear of wrinkles tarnishing her magnificent face.) The celadon green robes she wore brought out the roses in her pale cheeks, and her eyes were as sharp and striking as ever. Draco was always excessively complimentary to his mother: how could he not be, when praise leaped so easily to his tongue? For her, at least. Today was no different.
, what’s wrong?” someone asked. They sounded worried.
After he left Malfoy Manor, Harry had intended to do a lot of things. He’d intended to organize his notes about the house, and write up his reflections for the Ministry on the other houses he’d visited, and finally purchase clothes that fit (which he should have done years ago, according to Hermione. She didn’t “understand how anyone takes you seriously as a magical theorist, Harry, when all your trainers have holes and you don’t own any proper trousers”).
Ron’s head rolled loosely on his neck as he goggled at Harry.
Harry slumped back onto the table, narrowly avoiding a platter of toast. “Fine, I’ll just wait for them to die then.”
“Mmm, alright.” After Harry’s face was practically cracked in half by a large yawn, Draco easily steered a sleep-woozy Harry to his dormitory. Other than the silver and emerald splashed on every surface, it was the same as Harry’s room.
It was all Potter’s fault. On the day of their second meeting, Potter had insisted they tour some Muggle art museum where none of the paintings made any sense, and all the sculptures were amorphous blobs. None of the portraits moved, of course, which was strange enough. Where were the paintings of aristocratic forebears, the statues of heroes slaying dragons? Draco wasn’t interested in artfully nude sculptures, but surely there ought to be some of them around as well. He had long ago given up the anti-Muggle prejudices he had been taught, but wizarding art was obviously superior.
His eyes slid again to Draco Malfoy’s face on the other side of the hall. Instead of hope, it burned with fierce intensity. Gray eyes pretended to watch the Sorting, but Harry could tell his attention was really focused elsewhere. The war had ended, the fallen mourned and buried, but could Malfoy still be up to something?
“You’re still wearing your flower crown.” He’d closed his eyes, and opened them to see Malfoy staring inscrutably at him.
of course I can’t share the ingredients with just anyone. And yes, deep-frying and salting any foodstuff can be a health hazard. But! It’s exactly what the Muggles do, and you’re not harassing them!”
“Oh, they are glorious though,” Luna smiled. “Maybe a house elf could take them up to your dorm?”
Hermione tutted, patting one springy lock of her hair back into place. With her upswept hair and wasp-waisted crimson dress, she looked a bit like a Muggle film star. “Yes, yes, get all of that out of the way now. At least Neville isn’t participating.”
Let author know if you liked the smut, please and thank you :)
Ugh. Where did Malfoy get off calling him
“Scared, Malfoy?” Harry saw the hesitation on Malfoy’s face. Perhaps Malfoy hadn’t been on a broom since they’d escaped the hell of Fiendfyre during the last battle. Maybe Harry could convince the room to let them out without Malfoy getting on a broom? Just as Harry was beginning to weigh his options, Malfoy grinned.
of Spideys.
“I bloody
“You misunderstand me, Harry. I speak of nothing as tawdry as money,” Malfoy said in a low voice. “There are far more tantalizing things I could offer you. Myself, for example.”
Ron looked aghast. Apparently a relationship without sex was appalling, a fate worse than death. He gulped before continuing. “That’s rough. If you ever need help getting used to it, to, er, being touched or whatever, we can practice.”
“The prefect’s bathroom, of course. After traveling, I need to bathe.” Draco waved away imaginary fumes with one hand before fixing Harry with a sultry look. “Care to join me?”
Harry finally opened his eyes, blinking at the worried eyes above him. A crowd had gathered, but the eye’s closest to him were Malfoy’s. Perfectly normal grey eyes, that were definitely not dazzling silver. “Er, what? Malfoy? M’fine, but why’re you over here?”
Moving sounded like a bit too much work for Harry (even coming downstairs had made his head swim unpleasantly), so he stayed where he was in front of the common room fireplace. Sleep overtook him, until a rustle roused him a few hours later. The fire had burned low, and the dim light it threw off detailed a tall figure stepping through the portrait hole. Harry considered going back to sleep, figuring it was just another eighth year returning early, but then a shaft of firelight illuminated shining white-blond hair.
,” Ron shrugged, shoveling eggs into his mouth.
Harry chose to ignore that last aside, just as he was ignoring the breadth of Malfoy’s shoulders in that damn suit. His eyes widened. “Wait, focus group? Who was in your focus group?”
or whatever to him? Who did bloody Draco Malfoy think he was, anyway? Bloody git…
“Shirt. Off.” Malfoy said as he lifted a Quick-Quotes Quill, parchment, and a measuring tape from the table.
The music started, something slow and lush. Draco prowled out of his bedroom slowly, gracefully, like a big cat stalking its prey. And prey Harry was to be. Little had he known that the stockings were only the beginning. The lace kept going, up and up, until it ended in a delicate garter at the top of each thigh. Each garter was adorned with a tiny bow, one that begged Harry to rip it off with his teeth. Above the lace was a tight pair of high-waisted silk knickers. They hugged every mouth-watering curve of Draco’s body in a way that was surely illegal. The entire ensemble was capped off with a swirling emerald green robe, one that settled in satiny satisfaction around Draco’s body as he posed in the doorway.
Honestly, Harry didn’t mind at all. Out of all the houses he’d ever studied, none of them were quite as active or playful as this one. It seemed to be telling the story of itself with Malfoy, with the lights growing brighter at the bits it liked, and the whole room shaking when he told the story of the bloke being pitched out the window.
had asked out
The next letter at least sounded a bit more like the Malfoy Harry remembered.
Ron reached out one hand and pet the cloak too, cooing appreciatively “that’s quality, mate. And you are cold all the time, it’s kind of nice.” Rather than touching the cloak, Hermione was now waving her wand over it in increasingly complicated patterns.
“What the fuck,” he muttered. “I don’t even own purple parchment, much less anything vanilla-scented.”
“Indeed,” Malfoy said, taking a dainty bite of an egg and cress sandwich. “Forgive me for asking, but what do you plan to do with yourself after Hogwarts, Potter? Other than becoming the heartthrob of the entire wizarding world. I’d imagine you have unlimited options.”
Harry stepped carefully away from Malfoy’s body. “Er, thanks. Shall we, then?”
“Thank you,
.” A muscle jumped in Draco’s clenched jaw. He stopped pacing and stared down Harry with piercing grey eyes. “You mean you don’t want me.”
He summoned it from the broom shed and kicked off hard from the ground. Nervous energy thrummed through him, so he rocketed around the Quidditch pitch to try to burn it off. Harry caught himself looking over his shoulder multiple times: not for danger, but for a companion. He swore at himself each time and pushed away the niggling thought that something was missing. After careening toward the ground countless times grew stale, he flew in long, leisurely loops over the Forbidden Forest, watching the thestrals and centaurs gallop below. The sun beat down warm on his back, but the icy cold twining about his heart greeted him like an old enemy.
Malfoy stared down at his polished leather shoes and took a deep breath. “I...I’m afraid I need to come clean, somewhat. I would like to sincerely apologize for my home’s actions. The manor isn’t usually this bizarre, nor are its machinations usually so intimate. It may have indicated something after your last visit about desiring you to stay and acting accordingly. I did not disabuse the manor of that notion, for which I am dreadfully sorry.”
“Are you quite warm enough out here,
A hot flush of desire ran through Harry’s body before he could remind himself that he was being held by
Flames flickered low in the fireplace of the deserted eighth year common room that evening, throwing more shadows than light. Harry was tucked between Draco’s legs on one of the low couches, doing his best to just feel and not think. The hard planes of Draco’s chest against his own, the familiar spicy scent of cedar and lemon, the muffled growls Draco made as he did his level best to snog Harry senseless… Harry’s only thought was
“Oi Harry, over here!” Seamus called out as Harry entered the library. Madam Pince glowered imperiously in their direction, but Seamus tossed a flirtatious wink right back. Harry half-thought he saw her blush, but her face disappeared so quickly behind a teetering stack of books that he couldn’t be sure.
Here’s another joke for you, since your son liked the last one so much. When does a joke become a dad joke? When it becomes apparent.
Malfoy huffed out a laugh. “All of Hogwarts learned that fourth year, Potter. I doubted you’d improved in the interim, particularly with your newfound academic interests. Come, I’ll help you. Just follow me.” He counted down again, and Harry let himself be swayed in Malfoy’s arms. Each step was fumbling and odd, but Harry grew more used to the motion. Soon Malfoy was guiding them about the room in wide, gentle circles. They danced through rainbows and sunlight and warm rays of Malfoy’s smile, and Harry wondered if he’d ever been this happy. Yet too quickly for his liking, the instruments slowed, and the song ended with one resolved chord that hummed through his bones. And a small click, as a grey marble door appeared in the far wall.
“Harry, I know you hate Malfoy, but that was rather lovely,” she said breathily, a glazed look in her eyes. The other girls in the class seemed to agree with her. Hannah Abbott was staring dreamily at Harry and sighing. Parvati and Padma were whispering animatedly to each other, casting speculative looks in his direction, and Su Li was doing the same with Mandy Brocklehurst. Pansy Parkinson was tugging furiously at Malfoy’s sleeve, but he was refusing to look at her. Harry half-thought Malfoy was blushing, but figured it was just a trick of the light. Malfoy never blushed; it wasn’t a very Slytherin thing to do.
Draco was irritated again. This time, it was because the next emotion to arise within him was boredom. A sludgy, inescapable swamp of tedium, one that mired any passers-by in rank mud and lured them to their death. He hadn’t felt anything for seven years, why would it only be the most banal emotions returning to him?!
Draco would probably have laughed in anyone else’s face, but he restricted himself to a slight moue of amusement. “Yes, but you must allow me to lead.
“I only have the best, Harry. Hence, my bed is always bigger. Stop arguing. Bed.
Harry snickered. “You are snooty, but sometimes I like it. You say what you think every day, even when you know people won’t like it--remember when you called Smith a spineless, dickless wonder last week for what he said to that third-year? I
until we compromised and agreed to burn them.”
“Give it here, then,” Draco ordered, holding out one hand for the letter. “I don’t wish to extend your visit for any longer than you do.” The owl complied, and Draco held another letter with Potter’s familiar spiky handwriting.
Hermione shook her head insistently. “Harry, I’m serious. There are plenty of legends about their family. Dragons are on their family crest, which they’ve used for centuries. ‘Draco’ is a family name for a reason. Think about it, normal wizards don’t spit sparks or have markings around their eyes. Do you remember how Seamus and Eloise came into their creature inheritances this year? I think Malfoy did too.”
“Come on, I’ll tell you about it while we eat,” Ron said, half-shoving Harry into the kitchen. “You like shepherd’s pie, right? This recipe has paprika in it, I think it’ll be good.”
Harry snorted. “Not like I’d want to dance with anyone else anyway.”
“Merlin, you’re going to kill me. You’re too fuckin’ pretty for your own good,” Harry complained.
At its master’s admission, the marble door creaked open, revealing a perfectly normal hallway through its perfectly normal frame.
Malfoy cared for Harry so gently in his dreams. It wasn’t a real relationship, so Harry felt no fear of being hurt or abandoned. Dream-Malfoy was lovely, but he made it so difficult for Harry to wake and go about his real life, where Malfoy did not care for him at all.
Harry dropped his best smile and settled for a sheepish one. “Er. Yeah. Sorry about that, didn’t want people fussing or acting weird. But I am really here from the Ministry to study your house. Can I come in?”
Harry rolled his eyes, but complied. It was such a small request to keep his temperamental dragon happy.
happy.
Draco scoffed and flicked one delicate hand into a very rude gesture. "Don't be daft, of course we are, it's like the artist formerly known as Prince. Anyway--"
“Mmm. Good.”
Malfoy began unbuckling his trousers. The man seemed to enjoy the sound; he shivered in anticipation. Harry inched forward, needing to see, and the creak of a floorboard betrayed his position. Malfoy couldn’t see Harry from where he stood, but his head snapped toward the doorway. He stared at the door with dark and dangerous eyes, resembling an avenging angel.
“This is nice,” Harry said. Obviously, it was much more than
Draco had to admit it made sense. Of course the Boy Who Wouldn’t Die was his mate. He experienced an odd mélange of irritation and tranquility, but overall, he felt glad that it was Potter. He was strong, and smart, and had always driven Draco mad in the way only he could. And surely the Saviour of the wizarding world would be a very fitting trophy for a Malfoy’s arm. Yes, indeed, Draco could get used to that. But Draco could only relish the idea of Potter and his gorgeous eyes being his forever for a moment before Potter collapsed.
Here Potter’s eyes became unbearably tender as he gazed straight at Draco. It was almost enough to make one believe in love again. But then Pansy banished that ridiculously Hufflepuff thought. How absurd.
“Never. I was born for this.” He raised his stupid posh voice a tad and said, “We’re ready, Headmistress.”
Harry elbowed him in the ribs. “Not you, like...I dunno, like the
Harry frowned. Flitwick was indeed developing a pronounced eye twitch, and his wand hand looked a bit shaky. Relief washed over his face as soon as Harry lowered his hand. But Harry wasn’t finished. As soon as class ended, he made a beeline for the library.
Saviour who May Occasionally Produce a Good Idea,
Ron, on the other hand, was not puking or mocking at all, but seemed somewhat mollified. “Least it’s not as corny as the last one,” he shrugged, eying a happy Hermione contemplatively.
Malfoy growled through unnaturally sharp teeth and switched languages flawlessly. “You are
Malfoy’s voice behind him was clearly anguished, or at least as anguished as that stupid posh drawl could ever be. "No, I just know not what else to offer you! I possess wealth and good looks, but not much else. I just want
“You are a client. And we are not friends,” Draco hissed.
. Seriously, Harry? With the way he looks at you? It’s like you’re some kind of prize that only he is allowed to have! Of course he’s always been intense, but it’s very possessive for friendship. Obviously I couldn’t ask Malfoy himself about it, so I did the next best thing.
Exactly one week after Harry’s revelatory conversation with Malfoy, an untidy scraggle of feathers winged awkwardly toward the Gryffindor table.
, you feel good, Malfoy,” Harry grunted. He could feel the hard length of Draco’s cock against his leg and felt inordinately proud. He thrust against it, loving the agonizing tingle that spread through his body. He did it again and again, until he thought he could come by rutting alone, but Draco took his face in his hands to stop him.
“Yes, only sleeping. I need to feel close to you. Please?” It was unfair that such a mercurial, pompous man could summon such devastatingly pleading eyes. Absolutely unlawful.
"Oh how lovely! We can have Christmas crackers, and maybe some mulled wine, and even start studying for our NEWTS…" Hermione should not have been nearly so starry-eyed at the thought of spending the holidays studying some moldering old books. But Harry knew his friend well, and warmed at the excitement on her face.
The lights winked and turned down low, but the display case obediently faded into the wall and was replaced by the door.
McGonagall, apple-cheeked and giggly, toasted them from where she was speaking with a surprisingly well-dressed Professor Vector. Judging by the twinkle in Vector’s eyes, they were discussing something decidedly more salacious than marking papers.
Ron nodded. “Yeah, that’s right out.”
“You’ve been planning this all night, you chaotic bint,” Draco realized, an intrigued look on his face.
“‘M fine,” Harry grunted, not breaking his surly stare at the Slytherin table. “It’s just weird that Draco’s not around. It’s odd, right?”
Pansy Parkinson was holding court at the Slytherin table when Harry made it down to breakfast. Greg was piling her plate with the finest pastries on display (even snatching one off a first year’s plate), Millicent Bulstrode was braiding her hair, and Zabini smirked sardonically at her jokes. Apparently Slytherin had a new queen now that Draco had vanished.
Thank you for dinner last night. I would like to apologize for my son’s behavior. I recently explained to Scorpius that I enjoy the company of both men and women in an intimate way, but I had thought he would be more circumspect than to blurt it out in front of you. He and I shall have to have a talk about discretion. Although with you telling him about the time Teddy perfectly replicated a pig’s face, I am sure we will have many other topics to discuss as well.
“Nope. I’m
Harry shuffled over and sagged into one of the chairs. After two games of Quidditch and watching Malfoy try to bake for over an hour, he could certainly use a rest.
Harry groaned aloud. Ugh, what a pretentious name. Must be owned by a pureblood. He sighed, but went in anyway.
Hermione lay back on the couch, rubbing her eyes. Even as drunk as he was, Harry could see that she was seriously troubled. “No clue. But I think having a family is what Ron wants to do with his life, so he very much sees that as the next step. And I don’t.”
Draco stalked down the grand staircase and into the manor’s conservatory, his dressing gown billowing about him. He strode past the belladonna and took a right at the black lilies to find the center of the botanical maze. He would have usually stopped to admire the graceful, delicate lines of each stand of flowers, but he had neither the time nor the inclination to do so today. Narcissa Malfoy was waiting for him, resting with perfect posture at a glass table laid with all of her son’s favorites. She had grown more relaxed and less wan since the war; now she looked patrician rather than pinched. Robin’s egg blue robes swished about her as she rose to embrace her son.
fine. Edible, even. The carefully coiffed white-blond hair adorning the man’s head glimmered in a way that was oddly familiar...too familiar. An icy chill rippled down Harry’s spine.
“Of course, darling. I couldn’t be anything but.”
Harry was actually pleasantly surprised to discover Malfoy had purchased Twilfitt & Tattings after Mrs. Twilfitt’s retirement. It was just across the way from his store, Snitch & Stitch, and he had been worried that the next owner would worship him as others did. Malfoy would never do that (he’d prefer to quietly irritate his old rival), so Harry considered himself in the clear.
“Will you--will you consider it? Please,” Malfoy asked.
Harry didn’t have time to think about the letter again until late that night, when Ron had been given a calming draught and immediately conked out on his bed. He thought of Teddy, the tiny, chubby baby who was technically his godson. Merlin, he was adorable, especially the way his fuzzy baby hair flashed from brown to blue and blurred through the whole rainbow when he was happy. Andromeda Tonks was caring for Teddy while Harry finished school, but maybe after that--maybe Harry could have his own family again. For keeps this time. Maybe it would not be so awful to hope, just this once. If Malfoy wanted to be a part of that...that might be alright. If he stopped being such a git and actually respected Harry’s boundaries.
“Oh, yes,” Luna said dreamily. “You’ve been obsessed with each other since you met. You can’t stop thinking about him, nor he about you. How did you think things would end?” She nodded, as if that were all that needed to be said about the matter, and plopped down at the Gryffindor table to enjoy her scones and tea.
He picked up the bracelet again, turning it in his hand to catch the light. Long-buried feelings still prickled when he thought of the man who had given it to him. They hadn’t seen each other in years, not since Malfoy had left Hogwarts. He hadn’t appeared in the papers at all, either. Where was Draco Malfoy now? Their relationship had been overwhelming for Harry at the time, but now that he’d gained some distance, he knew he would’ve handled it differently. Yes, Malfoy the dragon had been grasping and possessive, even downright rude to Harry’s friends. He’d been so unpredictable that he’d frightened Harry at times. But Draco had been sweet and a good listener and bitingly funny.
Harry let out a strangled scream. “Ron! Look at this!” He passed Ron the letter and began thudding his head against the solid Gryffindor table.
“Tickety-boo,” Malfoy said breathlessly. “We’ll look forward to your visit.”
Ron guffawed. “If anything, it’s a ferret!”
“What was your favorite part of today?” Harry asked, linking his fingers with Draco’s.
Ron couldn’t seem to scrape together enough words for a reply, so Harry continued. “Yeah...I mean, it’s just dinner at Hogwarts, but I think he has something special in mind.”
“Harry, are you alright? You look a bit strange,” Hermione asked, looking him over with obvious concern. Harry grimaced; he’d tried to glamour the marks on his neck, but he knew his concealment charms weren’t quite up to snuff.
They stood, paid the check (Draco wanted to split the bill, but Potter was too quick), and made their apologies to the server on their way out of the restaurant.
had breathlessly gossiped about Harry for weeks, until Harry had threatened legal action. Most people had then lost interest. But while everyone knew he was gay, only a very discreet few knew that the Boy Who Lived was now the Man Who Likes to Get Fucked. Harry likes to be filled, to be dominated, rather than being the conquering hero in bed that all the
“Oh.”
Potter seemed unfazed and only snuggled deeper into his thick jacket and woolly scarf. He followed as Draco began to stroll toward his flat. “I know. You don’t live at the manor anymore then?”
“Have you got a minute? I need to talk to you. Both of you.”
“Yes,
“Harry, I’m sorry! Are you all right? Oh no...”Seamus practically tripped over himself to apologize for burning Harry, but Harry quickly healed the burn and apologized for getting so close to Seamus’s markings. Most of the other students went uneasily back to pretending to listen to Professor Binns (who hadn’t noticed anything had happened at all), but Harry could hear muffled snickering behind him. He whipped around to see Malfoy, face uncomfortably red, as he tried to stifle his laughter.
* * *
“What in blazes is that monstrosity?”
“--yeah, that’s my least favorite part--” Ron interjected with a sigh.
Would you perhaps like to join me at the Manor for dinner on Wednesday? Scorpius shall be with his mother, but I do owe you a meal. A Malfoy always pays his debts.
When he wasn’t trying to poison or curse anyone, Malfoy had a very dark, biting sense of humor. He would always surprise Harry with a snarky comment on one of his origami birds during a boring lesson, or drop a slightly mean (yet gut-bustingly funny) anecdote into conversation. (Ron only ever rolled his eyes, but Harry noticed that Hermione’s cheeks always pinked with suppressed laughter.)
Malfoy gritted his teeth. “As difficult as that would be for me, I truly meant what I said. I just want you...Harry.”
Harry finally interrupted when Draco started running out of steam. “See, that’s a much better response, you numpty. It looks like you completely forgot the Yule ball, too. There’s that to look forward to, and then you’ll be back at school before you know it.”
“No?” Potter asked, shooting him a quick grin. “Come stand here in the middle and look up. Yes, right on the circle. Now, what do you see?” Draco allowed Potter to prod him into position and gazed up as instructed. He stared for a moment, not recognizing what the thin lines of silver and gold were meant to be. After a moment, it clicked. Draco realized he was staring up at a rendering of the night sky. Each piece of fabric that had seemed so whimsically arranged coalesced to form the stars and constellations of the northern hemisphere. He located Ursa Major, Ursa Minor, Hercules, and even the constellation after which he was named. It was surprisingly lovely.
When he had yelled himself hoarse and thrice broken a stupidly large vase, Draco cast a quick cooling charm and made himself decent again (including a glamour for those
A puzzled Harry flushed crimson, right up to his hairline. “Oh. Er, that’s your ‘ulterior motive?’”
“What if I never want to shag you? What then?”
“Indeed. You are lucky I’m charming enough for the both of us,” Draco winked.
In the meantime, Harry had swiped a quill and ink from a table in the common room and run pell-mell up to the Owlery. He scrawled a quick note and attached it to the owl he could coax down the fastest.
“One cannot shop with an unhappy stomach! Have you really not eaten yet?” Draco stared at Harry in disbelief. It seemed to physically pain him that Harry had skipped breakfast.
He watched with interest as workmen made the shop a blank slate and as the new sign was hung: Luxe.
Draco cut him off by placing one slender finger on his lips. “You’re wrong, Harry. It’s not that I don’t see your flaws. I see them, but I accept you exactly as you are. That’s what mates are meant to do.”
Harry nodded and followed Malfoy down a long hallway. The room they entered was part workroom, part fitting room. Harry looked down to see a lush silken carpet embracing his feet as he walked. Bolts of jewel-toned cloth lined the wall behind a stately work table, but Malfoy steered Harry toward an ornate mirror in the corner.
Gazing at him was as ruinous as trying to stare at the sun. It burned Harry to look, but it would harm him even more to look away.
The look with which Malfoy regarded Harry reminded him of a snake sizing up its prey. “Before the school year is out, I think. Yes, that sounds about right.”
“Don’t be silly, Draco,” Harry scoffed, turning to press a chaste kiss to his cheek. “I’ll just see you before you leave tomorrow.”
again. Irritation washed through him and rankled under his skin, like an itch he couldn’t scratch. Not that Malfoys ever scratched, of course; it was unbecoming. Draco crumpled the letter and threw it aside.
hot,” Harry groaned.
Harry stalked to the edge of the lake again, cursing Malfoy and dragons and the whole damned world under his breath. Hesitant footsteps approached him. He tensed, expecting an unwelcome arm around his shoulder or a hand at the small of his back, but Malfoy just waited.
Macarons were different from any other biscuits he’d ever had, but they were fascinating in their strangeness. Harry was pleasantly surprised that a few of the macarons were treacle tart flavored. Perhaps Malfoy knew him better than he’d care to admit.
“ Calm your tits, Malfoy. We’re just talking. Anyway, Harry--”
Harry groaned loudly and reached for the large white box that had been delivered with the letter. He untied the dark green velvet bow and lifted the lid to reveal a sea of soft blue. Something that would keep him warm...was it a cloak? He pulled it from the box and held it before him, fingering the elegant silver fastening as he did so. The deep blue fabric of the cloak slid through his hands as easily as water, but the hand touching it was tangibly warmer.
"Weasley, are you coming tonight? It’s just that little Korean karaoke place off Diagon, you can’t miss it. Their soju is divine.” Her dark eyes seemed to linger appreciatively on him, but she might also just be noticing the soup stain from his spilled lunch. He thought he’d spelled it away, but she’d always had sharp eyes.
"You have? What for?"
“No.”
Right. Moving on. Second, Malfoy had somehow burned Smith without using his wand at all. Maybe he’d just become really good at wandless magic?
But then he saw Malfoy’s waiting face, his wringing hands. He just looked so expectant, so
“Bloody Draco Malfoy,” Harry grumbled.
Malfoy sprang up from his chair and whipped the door open. Harry followed, and Malfoy slammed the door shut just as the room they had occupied folded up into nothingness.
“Hmm...you smell like baking and, y’know, lightning. Like the sky just before a storm. And then my smell is more fresh and woodsy and deep. The two scents together...well, it’s
Draco regarded Potter coolly. Did he actually care about the answer? Draco was so bored that he chose to be honest with his response. “Potter, this is small talk. Idle conversation about acquaintances. Pleasantries are something in which I have been trained, but I do not enjoy them. Small talk feels to me like slowly dying, one word at a time.”
Yet to Harry’s dismay, observing Malfoy made him feel better than he had in months: less itchy, less agitated, less cold. More like himself. He told himself it was just the additional exercise and pushed any other explanations to the very back of his mind. Nothing
,” he said, nodding genially at Harry and waiting for a response. As if they hadn’t been rivals for the last eight years at all. Harry was sufficiently thrown off his game to nod back.
“Are you ready?”
“You look absolutely knackered, Potter. Is this not the kind of thing one usually does when studying sentient homes?” Malfoy asked, pouring them each a cup of tea. He’d remembered how Harry liked it, and he gulped down his tea gratefully.
“Spideys? You don’t think it’s really…” Ron shuddered in disgust after reading the sign, his freckled face going pale.
As Malfoy’s pointy face reddened, he decided the chances of that happening were fairly slim.
Harry tilted his head to the side, utterly confused. "Which prince?"
It’s Malfoy the Dragon,
, and he sees his friends often enough.
Harry rubbed the back of his neck. “Thanks. Not sure how many people come for yarn and how many come for me, but I like running the store.” He paused, an awkward bubble swelling between them. “I’m sure yours will do well. You’re always so well-dressed, people like that.”
Glancing up at Malfoy’s face, he looked positively feral with rage. Gone was the posh and pristine boy Harry thought he knew; before him stood a wild man, with the silver eyes that Harry thought he had hallucinated. He was almost completely unrecognizable. A furious beast seemed to struggle beneath his skin, clamoring to escape and capture its quarry. Strings of furious French poured from his mouth, but Harry didn’t catch any of it.
When they were stuffed to the gills, they had broken into the mulled wine. Forty-five minutes of drinking later, Hermione was now waxing poetic on what seemed to be her new favorite topic: Ron and his many faults. Harry would usually shut her down, would usually try to defend his best mate, but she made quite a few good points. And she was on her third glass of wine, so it was rather hard to get a word in edgewise. Harry took another resigned swig of his drink and let Hermione ramble on.
sexy,” Draco slurred, waggling his eyebrows suggestively. His eyes were closed, which rather detracted from the intended effect.
Harry flopped down on his bed too. Seemed like a good way to avoid eye contact. “Oh. I mean, dating doesn’t always mean s-sex.”
Everywhere else Harry looked was soft: thick rugs spilled over the floor, and overstuffed cushions practically begged one to flop onto them and roll around. There was even a fucking chaise in one corner, gilded and gaudy. Draco was the pointiest thing in the room, but Harry’s heart warmed at the sight of him. In the odd wavering light of the lake, he looked positively ethereal, intangible, as if he could disappear at any moment.
overwhelmed them all. Was it...was it coming from the Gryffindor table?
Worse, the more obsessed Harry became, the more present Malfoy seemed to be. Malfoy brought him coffee on a bleak, chilly Saturday. Malfoy dropped by Snitch & Stitch and invited him to lunch, looked oddly miffed when Harry begged off. He even brought his mother to buy a skein of lace-weight silk, smirking at Harry all the while.
Draco frowned, but finally stopped, settling Harry’s back against his chest and holding him close. “As my mate demands. What did you wish to discuss?”
“It’s a wand holster. Come, I’ll show you how to wear it.”
Malfoy smirked. “I assure you, it’s not what you’d think. Come, Potter. I need to tell you a story.” Malfoy transformed a tree branch abandoned on the ground into a short but serviceable wooden bench. Harry grudgingly followed him as he sat down with a flourish of robes. He loathed receiving any help from Malfoy, but he would rather not get his robes wet.
Harry was breathless. The brutal competition and the outright glee on Malfoy’s face in the sunshine (was it real? Created by the room? Harry didn’t care) had stolen it away from him.
Draco thrust a set of clothes into Harry’s arms and bundled him to the ensuite to change. Harry began disrobing, letting his clothes fall where they may. The emerald silk pajamas he’d been given smelled like Draco, clean and woodsy.
Harry waited, but the house obviously didn’t want to cooperate. “Oh, fine. Here,” Harry said, pulling a clumsy bunch of white flowers from behind his back and thrusting them into Malfoy’s waiting hands. He’d clipped them with his wand and bound them together with his necktie; hopefully the gorgeous, intoxicating smell of them would convince the house they were a worthwhile gift.
His nerves only intensified as Harry tripped out the portrait hole, practically fell off one of the moving staircases, and skidded to a halt in front of the tapestry of Barnabas the Barmy. He paced three times in the corridor, and the Room of Requirement revealed itself. Harry pushed open the heavy door to see that instead of the usual golden candlelight, shades of dappled green drenched the room. He glanced beyond the various sofas and poufs and saw the far wall had become an enormous pane of glass holding back the icy waters of the lake. A copy of it, anyway: the Room of Requirement was on the seventh floor, after all.
“Nothing,” Harry hurried to say, turning to check the oven.
“Please, just go dance already. No need to argue about it for half an hour,” Hermione teased, toasting them with Ron’s stolen drink.
“No, I didn’t! Fine, I s’pose he’s good at it, but he’s
Harry nodded, his mind made up, and strode across the street to Luxe. The shop was dark, but the door was unlocked. Once he pushed it open, Harry could see a light on in the back room.
A very confused Harry wandered outside, to the edge of the lake. He took a seat under a gnarled old oak and began to read.
“Sure, whatever that is. Let’s go!”
She inspected her lacquered nails when she languidly replied, “Yes, I do.”
The Monday after he and Malfoy had agreed on a tentative friendship, Harry, Ron, and Hermione stumbled sleepily down the stairs to the Great Hall to find Malfoy seated at the Gryffindor table, near their usual spot. Perfect posture, perfectly straight Slytherin tie, and a perfectly serious look on his perfectly handsome face. Seamus was glaring intensely in Malfoy’s direction and muttering under his breath to Dean beside him, while Neville only clutched his favorite potted plant (a sickly moly he’d named Edwin) close to his chest. The Great Hall was rather quieter than usual, as everyone’s eyes were trained on the wayward Slytherin. Ron puffed up his chest indignantly and made a beeline for Malfoy as Harry was still rubbing the sleep from his eyes.
“What if I’d like to be?” Potter asked, cocking his head to the side. He seemed calm, and genuinely interested in Draco’s answer. But Draco knew that it was years too late. He was a broken man, one who could not stand to be shattered again.
No, that wouldn’t do.
Draco shook his head, still looking vaguely nauseated.
“Er--
, or I will not hesitate to remove it for you.” Malfoy’s voice was harsh and low, practically a snarl.
“He’s so bloody
“Here, try a bite.”
Malfoy, looking somewhat dazed (the smile was sometimes a bit much), lifted one aristocratic eyebrow and looked back at Harry down his nose. “Pardon? I received a missive from the Ministry telling me about a magical theorist studying ancestral wizarding homes, but your name was not mentioned.”
Harry shook his head. “Of course you don’t,” Malfoy drawled. “Just move your feet in a box and I’ll make us look good.”
Draco smiled. “See, that is far more entertaining than how the Weasley clan has been multiplying. What sort of stories are you working on now?”
Seamus cackled. “No, not at all. Actually, we were thinking you might have questions for us.”
Harry tried very hard not to listen, but he still heard far more than he liked as he made a break for the library door. “Shame, I had such a good story about lube too. Mistakes are no joke: walked funny for a week, I did. Remember when…” Seamus’s voice finally dwindled into the distance as the heavy library door closed, but Harry couldn’t forget what he’d heard. He had known Seamus and Dean were together, but he’d never thought about it much. At least they had been subtle, unlike Ron and Hermione (ugh).
I was correct about the debauchery, by the by. Absolutely shocking.
?” Harry tried to turn around, to see his face, but implacable arms held him close.
“Er, thanks. Um...it’s kind of nice out, want to go for a walk?”
the posh arsehole.” Harry muttered, ripping apart a scone and imagining all the satisfying ways a particular white-blond head could be detached from its body.
Harry wondered.
P.S. Why don’t crabs give to charity? Because they’re shellfish.
“You know I don’t need that,” Harry huffed. “You might be stupidly rich, but I have more than enough money. I don’t need you.”
Draco’s voice was low and mocking in his ear. "You're remaining at
It started small: the two of them holding hands as they walked to class, or Hermione throwing her legs over Ron’s lap as they chatted in the eighth year common room. Ron would “help” Hermione find books in the library, before they returned twenty minutes later with red faces and suspiciously mussed hair. They once disappeared to Hogsmeade for an entire day, coming back with swollen lips and a sack of sweets from Honeydukes to compensate for their absence. As happy as Harry was for his best friends, he was growing very tired of Ron’s silencing charms failing. Nobody wanted to hear that many smacking and licking sounds from the bed next to theirs. And after Hermione had groped his leg by mistake right in the middle of Charms, Harry decided to switch seats. Permanently.
Malfoy, whose voice was determinedly polite. But his hands (
“Very good, Potter. Now just stand still while I record your measurements.” Malfoy aligned himself against Harry’s back. He was still a hair’s breadth away, but Harry could feel tendrils of heat swirling from the man’s body. He moved away slightly and drew the measuring tape tight about Harry’s chest. The Quick-Quotes Quill scritched against the parchment, but Harry could barely hear it over the sound of his elevated heartbeat.
“Hello to you too, Potter. I don’t wish to discuss it," Malfoy scowled, reaching up to tuck his hair behind his ear before he remembered it was no longer there. Instead, he thrust his hands into the pockets of his fitted grey trousers and glared at the floor.
(See the end of the chapter for
ignores a Malfoy.”
“It reminded me too much of the war, and I didn’t want that for the rest of my life. So I started doing investigative reporting for
Obviously the song hadn’t been written by a wizard, and Potter tripped a bit over the changed lyrics. Hermione clapped encouragingly, elbowing Blaise into helping.
Harry huffed in frustration and watched his warm breath turn to frost in the air before him. Of course Malfoy had to come and complicate everything again, just when Harry had thought he’d had a normal year. And of course he had to be a pushy, insatiable dragon, insisting on mating with the most touch-starved and socially awkward orphan at Hogwarts.
“Look, there’s the squid,” Malfoy said, pointing out a handful of pale tentacles on the other side of the lake.
Unfortunately, the moonstones had absorbed too much energy from the moon during the weekend. Upon entering the shop later, Alfie had been overcome by their soothing properties and had passed out cold. Narcissa was delighted that Alfie had learned his lesson, and Draco was only mildly miffed by having to quarantine the moonstones in a dark box for the rest of the week. They were involved in a long and fascinating discussion about the magical properties of moonstone when a distinct clicking sound pervaded their conversation. A tiny puffball of a creature was flapping around in erratic loops and tapping at the skylight above.
If you dare touch or even
“How dare you ask me if my business is a
at him. “Potter, I’ve never been happier to hear you say ‘um.’ Do have another bite, you enjoyed the first one so much!”
His wand flew from across the room as Draco summoned it and used it to produce lube. It smelled pleasantly of orange blossoms and honeysuckle as he coated his fingers with it and found Harry’s arse. One finger pressed slowly within, and Harry welcomed the slight pain of the intrusion. It spread and became a delightful burn as Draco worked Harry open. Another finger joined the first, but everything was going far too slowly for Harry’s taste. He could already feel himself growing hard again.
Unfortunately, the evening continued swiftly downhill, and Pansy soon felt more single than ever as Neville and Hannah performed a sickeningly sweet duet. Seamus’ Irish accent made “Come a Little Bit Closer'' almost entirely unintelligible, but he did demonstrate some impressive dance moves. Draco practically seduced everyone in the room with the hip-swaying rockabilly song he’d chosen--the leather trousers he’d selected had been the last straw, even Potter’s tongue was practically hanging out of his mouth--but then Ron had drunkenly fumbled through “One Week” and killed the mood.
Lost as he was in thought, it took Harry a moment to notice another blond was now invading his personal space. Zacharias Smith was now stooping over the two boys, one hand leaned against the stone wall beside Harry’s head. “‘Lo, Potter. I’m here to steal you away from the big bad Slytherin,” he taunted, tossing a wash of dirty blond hair out of his eyes.
“Who even carries a bloody handkerchief these days?” Harry muttered to himself. He got to his feet and grabbed his broom, ready to go fly laps around the Quidditch pitch. Flying was just about the only thing these days that would get Malfoy out of his mind, so he intended to do a lot of it. Unfortunately, a familiarly pointy face chose that very moment to peek around the corner of the broom shed. Malfoy sauntered toward Harry, hands in his designer pockets, as though he had all the time in the world.
Harry thought.
Harry began to grow concerned. “Malfoy, I don’t speak French,” Harry complained. “If you’re mad at me or got cursed or something, you have to tell me in English! Or we have to go find ‘Mione, but she doesn’t speak that much French either, I think she only knows how to order food--”
“It’s the beard, isn’t it?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Hmmm...no, not really. Don’t know why I came back, it was just the only thing that felt right.”
“Yes, I had a particular request to make.” Harry’s heart stopped as Draco shuffled closer and knelt down on one knee, taking Harry’s cold, cold hand. “Would you do me the honor of attending the Yule Ball with me?”
That sounded much more like the relationship Potter and Draco usually had, Pansy thought with a smirk. They’d always been obsessed with each other, so it rather did make sense for Potter to be Draco’s new mystery boyfriend.
“No,” Malfoy scoffed, taking a half-step forward.
“The Internet? Mr. Malfoy, they were Russian, I think that was just their accent--”
Apparently, it wasn’t difficult to become an expert on a subject no one else studied. By the time he returned to London a year or so later, Harry Potter had unwittingly become England’s resident expert on sentient houses. (Anyone else would probably have been pleased, but Harry was upset there wasn’t anyone else he could learn from.)
“Yeah, go ahead Ron,” Harry said. Really, it was a miracle he'd stuck around for so long.
Malfoy’s pained voice broke through his reverie as he reached the last button. “Potter, wait!”
Ron was right behind her, wiping his hands on a tea towel. “Welcome back, mate!” He grinned and bundled Harry into a hug as soon as Hermione was done.
“...what owls?”
Harry nodded as the conversation moved on, but he couldn’t stop his thoughts lingering on Malfoy. He wasn’t talking about walking in on him like it was nothing; to Harry, it was

could’ve told him that. Know anything about the meaning? Maybe the meaning is it’s all a joke,” Harry grumbled.
It was a sight that should have had Harry in stitches, but he was far too busy brooding. The last few weeks of stalking observing Malfoy had been absolutely fruitless. It seemed that over the summer, Draco Malfoy had abandoned his wicked ways and become a normal Hogwarts student. He wasn’t skulking about the corridors or slipping off to the Room of Requirement to do anything nefarious. His group of friends no longer bullied the younger children or hexed the Gryffindors in the corridors. Malfoy was excelling in each of his classes, and had won an inordinate amount of house points in Charms class last week, despite Flitwick being no fan of his. Harry had even seen Malfoy help up a crying first year who had tripped and give her his handkerchief. When she had stopped crying, he had taken her book bag and escorted her to class, smiling all the way. Suffice it to say, Harry was stumped.
How dare Malfoy move onto his street and date perfectly nice gits and swan about like a bloody faerie prince?! Malfoy was so annoying and cared too much about his hair. It was probably good that Harry was a bottom too; he didn’t want to date Malfoy, or anyone else, anyway. Entirely out of the question.
again.”
Harry turned. Was he offended? “You said you were just teasing. I figured we were done and I should leave.”
“Oh, all right,” she laughed, shooing away a disgruntled Ron. Harry sighed with relief and guided them into a wobbly waltz. He didn’t quite understand how leading worked, and somehow they ended up in a far-off corner of the Great Hall. Circles were harder than they looked. But he’d only stepped on Hermione’s feet twice, so he considered it a win.
Harry was surprised when Draco didn’t come down for breakfast the next morning. Yes, they’d fought, but he still had to eat. And it was sausage day: Draco’s favorite. Maybe he’d just gone to the kitchens instead?
Yet one night, the dream was different. Harry came to himself in a walled garden. Sunlight spilled over crumbling stone walls and tripped over beds of carefully wrought flowers and vines. Harry followed the sound of a trickling fountain and found Malfoy waiting at the end of a long colonnade, drenched with climbing roses. He was dressed casually, broad shoulders stretching under rumpled white linen. His usually pallid skin was tanned, and he glowed with good humor and good health, though his eyes seemed too tranquil, too dim. He must have stayed in the garden for a long time.
“The manor did it,” Malfoy murmured, his cheeks aflame. It was unattractive, blotchy and red as it was against his white skin, but endearing all the same.
what I like."
? Had they even really been friends, or had Malfoy just been trying to use him somehow? Had their whole truce been some kind of slimy, low-down ruse, meant to humiliate him or break his heart? If what had just happened wasn’t because of a curse or a potion...could he ever trust Malfoy again?
Unfortunately, since Ron has been seeing Pansy Parkinson for a few months now, Harry has to hear far more about his old school rival than he’d ever wanted. The parties he gives, the luxurious robes he buys, the countless trips to exotic climes with different handsome paramours each time…
Harry could hear the smug satisfaction in Malfoy’s voice, and he loathed it. He jerked away from Malfoy’s warm embrace, and turned to glare at him. “I don’t know what you’re talking about. Shut up, Malfoy.”
The Slytherin didn’t react at all, but kept running through halls and up moving staircases until they reached an abandoned classroom. One flick of his wand locked the door, and another silenced the room to anyone who might dare to listen. He finally let Harry down from his shoulder, only to force him back against the wall. Intricate silver markings flared around Malfoy’s eyes as he crowded into Harry’s space. Shaking hands gripped Harry’s wrists, holding him firmly in place against the rough stone at his back.
“I’d rather not. Good night, Potter,” Draco replied, pulling out his wand and preparing to Apparate.
Malfoy sighed dramatically and draped one arm across his long-suffering face. Theatrical bastard. “Pity. Do tell me if you change your mind.” He did look awfully nice in the afternoon sunlight (the man’s hair practically glowed, and surely it was illegal for robes to fit that well), but if that was what he wanted, there was no way Harry would give in so easily. Surely he would never seriously want to date another man anyway: Draco Malfoy was indubitably straight.

charms on this cloak. Multiple protective charms, a whole suite of warming charms, even a few laundering charms to keep it fresh. It must have taken Malfoy hours.” Harry watched in horror as Hermione began to sniffle. “It’s...I can’t believe I’m saying this, but it’s really sweet.”
“Good to see you,” Harry beamed at his old friends. “It’s been a while. What’ve I missed?”
Ron guffawed and toasted Harry with his butterbeer. “I guess you just have to get Malfoy to let you in. Good luck with that, mate.”
Harry of course bought that outfit, and a dozen more. After their busy day, both boys were yawning. A quick apparition brought them to the outskirts of Hogsmeade. Just after another jaw-cracking yawn, Draco said, “You know, the night is young. Shall we stop for a nightcap?”
“It’s bloody
Potter’s eyes hardened. “No. You have to make a real effort.”
Scorp is of course invited; I’m curious to see what he’s like, and what you're like as a dad. I’ll meet you in the park across from Grimmauld Place at four o’clock Saturday, all right?
Everything changed on his eighteenth birthday. Yes, technically everything had changed during the Battle of Hogwarts, but despite the hope that day provided to the wizarding world, Draco still felt empty inside. Even when his father was led away by the Aurors after the battle, even during his and his mother’s hearings with the Ministry, Draco felt only grey. Rather than his life being suffused with evil, it had become nothingness. But as dawn broke on the morning of his birthday, Draco
“Honestly, you know I love Ron, but there’s just not a romantic bone in his body. I don’t think he’ll even propose properly; he’ll just buy a ring and announce we’re getting married in a month.” Hermione rolled her eyes before her face grew unbearably sad. She sniffled a bit as she added, “ugh...there’s so much I want to do with my life, and I think getting married and having children can wait.”
“Dunno. Some of the letters were nice, but he sounded too bloody sure of himself in everything he sent me this week. Makes me want to knock him down a peg,” Harry grunted, clenching his fists in the fluffy blanket swathing his shoulders.
Harry wondered, and jealousy coiled about his heart. He thrust back, and his cock brushed against Malfoy’s. Even through all their layers of clothing, Harry could tell that Malfoy was big. His cock was probably gorgeous too, the bastard. It made his mouth water, imagining taking it all the way into his mouth, until he started to choke.
“Please. I hope you’ve been well, Draco. Do tell me about the shop.”
Oddly enough, Draco was staring back at him in much the same way. “You are utterly beguiling,
Harry nudged Malfoy’s shoulder with his own, surprised by the sudden tingle that ran through his body. “What about you, then? What does the great Draco Malfoy want to do with his life?”
He reluctantly reached inside the bag. The enormous gem he lifted out of the pouch was similar in size to a Quaffle, yet far more captivating in its complexity. Shimmering flames in every shade of orange and crimson licked at the gem’s center, but the outside was as cool and slippery as could be.
And of course the cherry on top of Harry’s realizations was that he was again becoming unhealthily obsessed with Draco Malfoy. He furtively peeked out his shop window to catch glimpses of white-blond hair, started every time the bell over his door dinged, and combed the papers frantically for any news of his old rival. Perhaps Harry’s schoolboy obsession with Malfoy had never died, but his fixation was now worse than ever.
“Now, where were we? C’mere, Malfoy,” Harry teased, plopping down on the couch and pulling Draco’s lean body down on top of him.
“Leave out a few, okay? Judging by the ingredients, I think we’re supposed to bake something to move on.”
“It’s,” Marta sighed heavily for a moment before screwing that smile back on. “It’s still an order of our famous chips, which comes with a cup of our delicious special sauce. Muggle style just means triple-salted. Would you like to try it?”
“No, Harry,” Hermione explained. “Malfoy’s a dragon. According to their family lore, each dragon has a fated mate. And it’s you.”
Draco frowned. That had been unexpected. Obviously something still wasn’t working, but he had no clue. Perhaps it was the marketing that needed to be changed? Yes, that was certainly the problem this time!
“I suppose that will do,” McGonagall said resignedly. “Find a partner and practice the waltz, please.” She strode to the phonograph and started it up again. Harry panicked at the thought of perhaps having to dance with Malfoy a second time, and hurriedly reached out for Hermione’s wrist.
“Snobby?” Harry teased.
Ron stared at Harry in exhausted disbelief. “Can I spit sparks, Harry? Please tell me you would’ve noticed that.”
that--” Ron began, and Harry decided to interrupt before they could get into another row.
Pansy batted her lashes in just the way men usually liked. “Whatever do you mean, Draco darling? I was only inviting an old school chum to join the rest of our friends for an amicable gathering. If he happens to find me devastatingly attractive, then so be it.”
A week later, Draco was rather disappointed by the lackluster reception Spideys had received. Perhaps it was the location? The end of Diagon Alley was certainly less-traveled, but Draco knew that wouldn’t stop an eager diner. And, well, it was rather too late to switch locations now.
Overwhelming, instinctual need clawed at Harry’s chest. Draco couldn’t
Harry shrugged. “I’d probably fuck up any fancy pastries, but Molly Weasley’s a dab hand at biscuits and some of it rubbed off. So biscuits it is. Pass me the butter, yeah?”
I know your hair is consistently ridiculous, but how does it always manage to look like you’ve just been thoroughly shagged? Also, what is a thirst trap?
Unfortunately, Harry’s slight pleasure was quashed when the third letter arrived. It was the most sickly sweet letter Harry had ever read in his life.
Harry shrugged and started unbuttoning his shirt. The house seemed to have a specific agenda in mind, to which he really wasn’t opposed. Malfoy was nice now, and tried to make jokes, and was charmingly hopeless at baking, and the way he looked at Harry was so sharp and tender. Anything that Malfoy was okay with, Harry was okay with too.
Stupid Potter,
For the first time in months, Harry felt warm. It was delightful. Strong arms held him close, and he could smell something woodsy and fresh, cedar and lemon perhaps? More than feeling warm, he felt more whole than he had since before the war. In a word, Harry felt
Harry scoffed. “It’s the most stressed I’ve been in years. But I like the outcome.”
“You know, there are some other delicacies you simply
“Hold off, mate,” Ron whispered to Harry after he’d raised his hand for the fifth time. “He’s starting to twitch. ‘S not a good sign.”
? You do realize you’re of age now, don’t you? You can leave whenever you like, rather than haunting the halls like one of those gormless ghosts that are always moping about. You ought to reconsider: I had rather hoped you would spend the holidays with Mother and I at the manor."
Harry only stared at Hermione in stunned silence, but Ron’s face grew steadily redder.
He also felt rather itchy and over-exposed. Unwilling to close his heavy bed curtains to trap heat inside, the boy waved his wand and coaxed his blankets into a soft ring. He’d often made a nest as a child; perhaps this would help him feel better.
Malfoy rolled his eyes and muttered as he stalked away, “Maybe I’d be the murderer, you don’t know.”
around the three and sliced open the letter, reading it aloud.
Hermione nodded and cast a quick charm to finish winding the yarn into a perfectly spherical ball. Ron looked at his suddenly empty hands with befuddlement, but they soon followed Harry up the stairs and back to his dorm room.
unless he had to. What a disturbing mental image.
Or at least, not Draco as he had been. Former Draco had been willowy, almost delicate-looking. He had taken pride in his pale, elegant features, and hexed anyone who insinuated otherwise. (Blaise had taken to calling him a twink, but Draco did him the courtesy of pretending not to hear.) This Draco had gained at least a stone in long, lean muscles. He flexed one thick arm, feeling the new power coiled within it. That at least was a welcome change. Draco was also significantly taller, by at least six inches. The lines of his jaw and cheekbones were more pronounced than ever. But rather than looking skeletal, he looked dangerous. Predatory. Most shocking of all, his previously grey eyes blazed a terrifying silver, as did the markings surrounding them.
Harry realized. He made a sound halfway between a grunt and a squeak and whirled back to face his friends.
Your congratulations are very kind. I would tell my wife, but we separated quietly a few years ago. Once Astoria and I had produced an heir, there was no love lost between us and we went our separate ways. However, she is still an excellent mother to Scorpius, who is five years old.
,” spilled out of Harry. In Parseltongue, thank Godric, or else he would definitely have detention. He shot up out of his seat and shook his fringe until the small flame went out, but it had singed his forehead a bit.
rare wizarding delicacy, Potter. I’m not surprised that some people'' he cut his eyes at the door, obviously thinking of Ron “are simply too uncultured to appreciate it. But I suppose it’s simply not one’s fault if one isn’t properly exposed to culture. I do adore fried spideys.” Malfoy glanced away for a moment, almost giving Harry an opportunity to spit the wad of chewed-up spider into his napkin, but he looked back too quickly.
“Well, Luna’s calmed down a bit since Hogwarts, but she’s still held on to some of the more grounded conspiracy theories. She had me look into the Rotfang Conspiracy, which turned out to be false, but it turned out that the Ministry wasn’t providing dental care to anyone who’d been hired in the ‘90s because they contractually didn’t have to back then.”
Pansy scoffed. “About as much as you want the giant squid, Draco.”
Ron sat across from her, mumbling the lyrics under his breath as he drummed out the beat on his thighs. “Sweet little unforgettable...hmm.” He was obviously aware he’d missed something, but she was sure it would take some time for him to figure it out. And him an Auror and everything. With such a fantastic start to the night, what could possibly go wrong?
Harry worried his bottom lip between his teeth. “It’s quite the story. Er...assuming that you’re right and I am your mate, what happens if I reject you? What if I don’t want to be your mate?”
The week of strange gifts continued, but they took a more serious turn after the enchanted cloak. On the fourth day, no package accompanied the letter when the owl dropped it at the Gryffindor table. Harry decided to open it anyway. Out of mere curiosity, of course.
Draco’s eyes had flared silver as he tensed at Harry’s alarm, but he quickly relaxed back onto Harry’s lap. “Most decent people don’t hang about in dark corners, that’s for
Harry scowled. Almost as if he’d felt it, Malfoy’s silvery eyes flickered in his direction. He graced Harry with a charming smile, then raised his wine glass with a courtly nod.
Draco smirked. “Speechless, the desired effect. Excellent.” He held out one arm for Harry to grasp. “Shall we? The evening awaits.”
Winter had come to Hogwarts. November held the school and its students in her icy grip, and everyone was bundled up in woolly layers of sweaters and cloaks. Peeves had taken to swooping about the castle with buckets of frigid water, threatening to dump them on unsuspecting students, and only a severe scolding from an irate McGonagall had stopped him making good on his threat.
“Stuck-up?”
Seamus waggled his eyebrows suggestively and Dean elbowed him in the side. “Shut it, Seamus. Anyway, Harry, when two men love each other very much…”
So it was no wonder he had to try
These were someone else’s thoughts.
Once Draco had been dragged to the dance floor, he didn’t seem to want to leave. Harry felt confident enough when a waltz started up, but as the music morphed, Draco led him through a dizzying array of different dances. Firm hands and strong arms corrected his every misstep. Harry even started enjoying himself a few songs in, buoyed by the happiness sharpening Draco’s every move. He laughed out loud once, his face blithe and carefree. Harry adored him.
“An order of chips and a couple of pints, please,” Harry called out to Madam Rosmerta behind the bar. She nodded and bustled back to the kitchen, honey-colored curls bobbing along. Mere moments later, two sweating glass mugs and a plate of chips with the perfect amount of vinegar clattered onto the worn wooden table.
“S’fine,” Ron grunted, his eyes trained on Hermione. “Nothing yet, but I’m sure ‘Mione’ll find something eventually. Why’s Malfoy giving us a sodding letter in front of the whole bleeding school if it’s not supposed to blow up in our faces or curse us with horns?”
A few more experimental strokes later, Harry fell into a rhythm. But apparently he was going too slow for Draco’s liking. Strong arms lifted him and in the blink of an eye, Harry was straddling Draco’s warm lap. And
Ambling down Diagon Alley on a sunny day was one of Harry’s favorite things to do. Particularly mid-morning, when the shops were quiet and Diagon’s normal throngs were thin. He paused to admire the new Firebolt in the window of Quality Quidditch Supplies and licked thoughtfully at his half-gone mint chocolate chip ice cream. He’d stopped at Fortescue’s for a cone, and the cheery witch behind the counter had recommended a jewelry store down the street. But Harry was certainly in no hurry.
thing, except sometimes Draco would stare at Harry in a way that made his heart skip a beat. And then he would swoop in for a kiss, until Harry would protest, and someone walking by would inevitably say something rude. Draco would hex them or verbally eviscerate them, and the cycle would begin all over again.
“My, Potter, you certainly have filled out since school. I suppose puberty finally caught up with you. You’re going to need many more items of clothing. Perhaps a whole new wardrobe.” One hand drifted over Harry’s nipple as Malfoy slipped the measuring tape to his waist and again drew it tight.
Harry remembered.
The shepherd’s pie was delicious, as was the butterbeer and the airy pavlova Ron had made for dessert. The three of them demolished all of it, swapping stories about Ron’s work at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes and Harry’s studies and Hermione’s research into reversing obliviation. When all the food was gone, Harry sat back and sighed happily. The urge to travel still niggled at him uncomfortably, but spending such an evening with his best friends was almost enough to make it go away, if only for the night.
Malfoy the Ferret,
Harry resolved not to ask about Hermione’s parents anymore: a crying Hermione was the only thing more terrifying than an angry one. "Anything would be better than last Christmas, right? But yeah, same here: I'm staying over too."
No response, except the man holding Harry even tighter. But as the song ended, he finally spoke. “Fancy meeting you here, Potter.” The posh tone was vexingly familiar.
“Oh! You’re staying?” Harry asked, shucking off his thick cloak and burrowing under his bedcovers.
” Draco’s face had been melancholy indeed as he brushed a kiss across Harry’s knuckles and boarded the Hogwarts Express.
what Molly thinks, Ron? Which is more important to you, what I think or what your mum thinks?”
“N-no.”
Harry had suffered from insomnia since fifth year, so he often woke during the night. Malfoy also had problems sleeping, so he and Harry made a habit of sneaking to the kitchen under the invisibility cloak to raid it for snacks. Ron would still be snoring away in their room, while Harry and Malfoy sprawled cozily in front of the common room fire, sharing a treacle tart and swapping stories. Yes, Draco Malfoy had become a surprisingly good friend, despite their shared history.
, whatever you are willing to give me. Only you."
“I see. Would it really be so difficult to mate with me?” Malfoy asked, his voice carefully smooth. He had moved slightly closer to Harry as he told his story, and the warmth emanating from his body was ridiculously enticing. “I could make it very worth your while. A dragon is a very honored creature, and to be a dragon’s mate is considered a rare and glorious privilege. You could live like a king, wanting for nothing. We could travel the world in each other’s company. Adoration, luxury, power: these could all be yours.”
Much to Harry’s surprise (and Hermione’s obvious dismay), Malfoy was the only one who raised his hand. “It traditionally means purity, enlightenment, or rebirth,” he said.
But Potter nodded.
Part of Pansy was thrilled that her prickly best friend supported her lusting after a Weasley, but the rest wondered if he’d been cursed somehow. “Where did this Hufflepuff optimism come from? Are you absolutely sure you’re Draco Malfoy?”
“Really? Do...do you want to be friends, then? What’s the word… My
“Er, maybe?” Harry offered sheepishly.
Much as he wanted to stay, Harry knew too well how creative Malfoy could be with hexes, even when he was otherwise occupied. Harry slipped out of Luxe, unable to fathom what he’d seen.
He swam to the far side of the bath and sat beside Draco, pressing his trembling thigh to Draco’s muscled one. He reached out under the water to find Draco’s hand, but found something else entirely. Something much harder and warmer and more enticing. A sharp hiss issued from Draco’s lips, and Harry almost jerked away, but on his next breath Draco said, “You can touch me, if you want.”
Yet just as he teetered on the edge of sleep, an oddly familiar voice padded into Draco’s mind.
Draco’s face grew serious. “I will ensure that you don’t.”
“Fried spideys are a
I was hoping you would. Fuck me, I mean. And hopefully not just the one time, either.
Yet death did not come. Draco still felt unbearably hot, but the pain soon faded. He scrambled out of bed and to his full-length mirror, anxious to check for any broken bones or gaping wounds. Surely his body would show some sign of trauma. A quick
Merlin’s
Dean smirked as the Headmistress stood to welcome the first years. “No, McGonagall wouldn’t be here if this were a dream.”
...ah, shit,” Harry gasped, and Malfoy growled quietly at him again.
. Yes, Malfoy had provoked him, but not enough to make him flee. What had happened to him?
He ignored the man before him and walked down the street, head held high. Rough footsteps clattered behind him as Potter followed. Draco sauntered on, even slowing to look in a shop window or two, until he had reached the isolated end of Diagon Alley. He’d expected Potter to give up by now, and it irked him that the man had persisted. Draco turned, folded his arms across his chest, and summoned his best scowl.
“And how does that feel?”
One corner of Draco’s long robe slid from his shoulder as he padded to the center of the room and turned his back to his audience. Harry could already feel himself getting hard. Draco knew exactly what those stockings would do to him. Tease. Harry settled back in his chair, determined to enjoy it.
Malfoy nodded jerkily and stalked back toward the Slytherin table, glaring at everyone in his path. The crowd around Harry began to disperse.
Even just stepping inside the Three Broomsticks that evening helped Harry breathe more easily. He’d always associate the pub with warm memories of Hogwarts, and the additional freedom he experienced as an adult made it one of his favorite places. It was bustling tonight, redolent of sweet butterbeer and British pub standards. Steak and kidney pie, fish and chips, Welsh rarebit...Harry’s stomach rumbled and he suddenly felt far more motivated to search for his friends and order.
their cocks were touching. Instinct told Harry to roll his hips, so he did, gasping at the sensation of the two of them sliding together. He glanced up and drank in feral adoration from Draco’s face as he thrust back.
