“I honestly don’t remember.” Neville frowns at the page.
in his home. Godric’s sake, how could you bear to set foot in his house, let alone sit down for dinner with him?”
Hermione’s sobs have slowed and she pulls out of Harry’s arms, looking helplessly down at Ron’s glowing body.
“All right, enough of this Gryffindor sentiment,” he huffs, getting to his feet.
“You’re sure? What colour?”
“Well, the second time you said you were meeting Pans when I know she’s currently in Paris, I started to wonder what was going on. The third time you did it, I thought I’d see what you were up to. I have to say, I’m disappointed. I was hoping for an illicit affair. This is much too wholesome.”
Harry feels his neck heat.
Luna arrives, wearing a gorgeous pale green gown and a matching leafy brooch. “Can’t be too careful,” she murmurs, tucking another small handful of leaves into one of Harry’s pockets. Ron stations two Aurors at the Floo to cast the diagnostic traces, and she demonstrates to them exactly what they’re looking for. Harry shows the Minister and the other Aurors to the library to wait, checking that Kreacher is under strict instructions to ensure they’re well-fed.
Draco blinked at that, his mind trying to take in that new piece of information, but the man kept at it.
He swallowed dryly, a feeling of dread creeping in his veins as he watched Draco nod to his boyfriend with a forced smile and leaned into a kiss.
He figured Potter had one more round in him to go through. And that was when Draco stopped abruptly, right as Potter was leaning his head back on the pillows, and Draco just knew he was so close.
He was unimpressed with the decor on the far wall when he felt a presence behind him.
Malfoy opened his eyes from where he was starting to layout again, floating on the water as Harry floated beside him. His grey eyes found him immediately, staring at Harry in clear contemplation as if he was mulling something over in his head.
Damn him.
terrible at flirting that it takes you longer than three days in a row to try to pull someone? Here I was, putting more faith in you.” He looked between Roddy and Malfoy with raised eyebrows, frustration at the man sitting across from him oozing through him.
They had agreed minutes prior that a walk sounded nice. They had been in the middle of a conversation that Draco had been desperately pushing back for quite a while, but Harry couldn't wait anymore, it seemed." Harry couldn’t wait anymore; it seemed. But it had escalated to a tipping point, and Draco was seconds from hyperventilating or throwing something at his boyfriend’s head.
Harry gritted his teeth in response.
Harry came down in the same way he always did, holding onto Draco tightly, rubbing his stubbled jaw over Draco’s shaven one, keening still from Draco still pounding inside him.
Harry found these nights more comforting than he thought he would, as he roamed around the silent corridors. It was gratifying - the peace was most beneficial for how overactive his mind was as of late.
He knew at some point tomorrow; he would laugh at her and tease her for always choosing the Weaselette look-a-likes every time they went out.
“Potter? You...have one of those, don’t you?”
“I am going to need two things from you before proceeding tonight.” His hand tightened minutely in his dark hair. “One, I need you to speak. I need you to moan and whimper and cry out as loud as you can.”
He even took a few notes in his head and a few things he did that Harry might have to try.
He blinked and grabbed his new drink from Seamus.
Harry hit him upside the head with a pillow.
“Well, I never did apologize-” Malfoy uttered, taking a long drink of his wine right as the food appeared before them. Harry watched as Malfoy thanked the waiter and took a bite out of his dish, humming in approval.
"You wanna come on my cock?” Malfoy asked, his voice raspy and full of tension, and even in his delirious state of mind, Harry knew Malfoy wasn’t far off from finishing himself.
But Harry paid them no mind at all at this point; in fact, he was pretty confident that if Voldemort rose from the dead and Apparated into their presence, demanding a duel to the death, he still wouldn’t look away from Malfoy’s - erm, everything.
Standing up from the table, Harry wanted nothing more than to go to his room and replay the songs he’d been sent over and over and leave his friend’s curious glances. “I just can’t overthink it. That won’t help me in the slightest anyway. Just have to trust my instinct with this.”
Harry was immensely grateful for the fact that he had started up his morning runs in the past year, as Malfoy’s hands rubbed up against his defined abdominals, hissing in relief as the aloe hit an incredibly burnt spot near his hip bone, and Malfoy added a bit more of the aloe to really layer it on there.
"Fuck Potter, the things you do to me. You have no idea.” Malfoy decided to hell with the plug as he gently took it out, throwing it somewhere in the middle of the room behind him, and began fingering his arse with two of his own. Harry pushed up into the feeling even more, not caring in the slightest how it made him look, his hands still above him, tied by Malfoy's magical force.
“What in Merlin’s name is going on?!” the blond narrowed his eyes at the space between himself and Justin, hands still rubbing his lips.
A few seconds passed as Draco observed Potter. Any sign that he wasn’t into this scene and the ropes would immediately be cut down, no question. But then a spark of something passed through Harry’s green eyes, almost like a challenge, and Draco smirked triumphantly.
“Mistakes
“Eager, are we?”
, he thought indignantly.
“This isn’t good for your health, Harry. You can’t be working yourself dry and not taking time for yourself. Just the other day, Rose asked me what was wrong with Uncle Harry.”
Harry managed a shaky smile as Ron handed him the glass of water, and Harry gratefully took a small sip before placing it down on the ground, a bit of water dripping down the sides of the glass from his unsteady hands.
These next two weeks might not be too bad after all, he mused, drifting off into a tipsy, mid-morning nap.
“I mean bloody hell Malfoy. I gave you a dildo last year, for fucks sake!”
– Draco led his boyfriend out back to meet the rest of the Weasley clan.
about them.
Malfoy’s eyes then glinted as he stared at Harry’s predicament, a certain gleam in his eyes that caused him to swallow dryly.
Harry smiled down at his notes, sighing as Draco pressed firmly into the balls of his feet with steady hands. He knew all of Harry’s pressure points by now and could render him speechless within seconds of touching him because of it.
Even though Harry wasn’t all that mad about it at the time, himself not being all that sober either.  He wasn’t too drunk either, as he could still feel the ghost of Malfoy’s lips from that night.
Harry visibly sighed against the couch beside the Slytherin. “Yeah. Okay.”
Harry nodded slowly, feeling a blush on his face.
Draco downed some more of his gin, desperately raking his brain for a swift exit.
Harry pursed his lips. “Yes. That.”
Draco cursed himself for the amount of time he was spending thinking about Potter’s half-witted, irresponsible, thoughtless partner and downed the rest of his gin.
He wasn’t sure he had it in him to look at his partner in the face after what transpired.
“Come on, let’s get you some water. Some with...perhaps a little less salt?” Rodrick offered him a hand, and Harry begrudgingly took it, making sure to drop it as soon as he stood up, trying to hide the shake in his legs.
Minutes passed, though it could have very well been hours; Harry wasn’t entirely sure. But he finally came to and was met with Malfoy beside him; arms wrapped protectively around him, Harry smiled softly into the hold.
Harry enjoyed basking in the sun, wondering if he would get more freckles, but then decided to hell with it either way and forewent any sunscreen.
Draco Malfoy.
“You can call me Harry, you know.”
Harry wanted to both laugh and cry at Ron's uncanny ability to swap his positions just because of one look from his wife.
Malfoy then opened his mouth, breathing hotly, and licked his bottom lip, catching the water droplets as they cascaded down from the shower.
“I - I - uhhh. Fuck!!”
Having an ample opportunity for embarrassment and possible blackmailing of the git would have made Harry over the moon with excitement. He might have even taken photos of the event,
He reached a hand down to steady himself, his right hand grasping the outside of the toy while his left hand stayed put to center himself on the wall.
“Yes, I’m fine. Just needed some air is all.”
He knew about the secret passage to Hogsmeade already, obviously, so he skipped over that one. He did remember Fred and George once explaining to him where a few others were hidden away, even a few that didn’t show up on the map, so he spent his first few weeks exploring those.
He barely noticed Professor McGonagall staring at him oddly from her perch as he swept the floor, witlessly scanning the room for the person he needed to find in that very moment.
It was hooked to some sort of black plastic piece with a suction cup stuck to the shower wall.
Draco thought, as he stood outside the tattered old building on the outskirts of Knockturn Alley, where the coordinates in the said letter had led him. He glanced left and right before raising the hood of his robes and slowly opening the nondescript door, which creaked with age.
Harry knew that was a test, and he wasn’t planning on failing it.
Draco only raised an imperious eyebrow at that and watched as Potter’s eyes left his own to drag down the rest of him, obviously stopping at his crotch level. Draco almost put a hand in front to cover himself, worried about the stain that might be there from earlier.
“Hold that beautiful thought, gotta use the loo, be back shortly.” Smith leaned in and kissed his cheek, to Harry’s surprise and slight disgust. He gave a manly squeak in response, but Smith had already left for the restrooms.
“That answers that question.” Harry felt rather than saw the smirk on Malfoy as he nibbled up his neck before pushing him further down onto the soft coverlet, stopping his thrusting and putting his hands on his chest. He stared down at him, eyeing him like he was his meal for the evening and he hadn't eaten in days.
“Erm -” Harry ignored the cracking in his voice, “Yeah, ‘course.” He gestured to the stone next to him and moved over slightly to give the taller man room.
Malfoy was, in truth, having a wank right there in front of him.
Not that he forgave him.
Harry leaned back and moaned, whining as Draco grabbed his cock and circled it around his entrance, not entirely entering him.
“I don’t embarrass,” Harry answered easily, pulling Draco closer until they were inches apart, one hand grazing the back of his head while the other held the man’s hand rather tightly, his actions not fitting with his words.
"I don't think I have any choice, do I?"
He brought a hand up, stroking slowly up and down the length, getting a proper feel at first. He watched, mesmerized at the precum that was inching down his length, dripping onto Harry’s fingers. Harry immediately brought his hand to his mouth and sucked, eyeing Draco the whole time, and smirked as his eyes darkened incredibly so at that.
Harry suddenly found it quite difficult to breathe as he watched Malfoy begin to move in an exceedingly specific
Harry took another deep breath, but instead of saying the words Draco feared above all others, or even slapping him across the face (which the latter would have been much preferable of the two), Harry smiled shyly up at him.
As his orgasm crested and trickled away, leaving only the familiar feelings of elation and serotonin, his eyes focused enough ahead of him to see the source of his outburst: Saint Potter. But this time, instead of his back toward him, he had turned around in his seat.
Harry couldn’t find a verbal response, his mind whirling with the knowledge that Malfoy was up in his room, hovering over him as he lay in his
Then again, Harry barely noticed anything besides the way Draco looked utterly sated above him and the wet spot in his pants from coming untouched in the process.
Potter threw his head back in a raucous laugh, and Draco had stared, as he usually did when Potter was so uninhibited after a few drinks.
It wasn’t that Harry hadn’t tried telling Draco how he felt about him.
Harry had to bite his lip before an ineloquent snort came out.
Yeah, Christmas spirit my arse, Harry thought dryly, as Kreacher Apparated into the living room.
Guess cleaning time was over.
"We'll get this sorted in time for Christmas," Hermione agreed.
“Huh?” he answered eloquently, the scent still pervading his senses. He wrenched himself back from the cauldron in an attempt to clear his head and forget about the unmistakable aroma that was finally evaporating away.
Harry raised an eyebrow of his own at that. “Noted...and I don’t particularly care for vodka.”
Draco was in Potions class when it happened. It had been a typical, dull day at Hogwarts. The type of day Draco had come to expect.
Hermione’s gaze went past Harry for a split second, before looking back at him in the next second. He despised the pitying expression on her face.
Harry didn’t care to watch when it occurred, but he couldn’t help himself. It was disconcerting that his friend just

?” Harry questioned him, nipping low at his jaw.
Caught unaware, Harry blinked once, and the side of Malfoy’s mouth tilted up as if he was trying not to smirk before he caught himself and turned around in his seat.
“Well. That was certainly something.”
“Not sure about the fourteen-year-old girl bit, but you do look a tad worse for wear, Potter. What’s got your knickers in a twist?”
Draco and Justin.
Thankfully, there was a lovely, large fireplace in their suite’s sitting room, and Harry had all his notes prepared as he watched the clock tick down, sitting in front of the fireplace and waiting for Kingsley to give him the all-clear to join in.
That should not be as hot as it was, but with Malfoy standing behind him, literally a few inches taller than him, looking down as his cock fucks his own fleshlight, was enough to finish Harry off.
Harry opened his mouth to argue when Malfoy took a few steps closer; his hand reached out and grabbed the handle of the shower, opening it right up, steam hitting his face and reminded Harry of some Greek God that came to save him from his tragedy currently unfolding.
The bloody toy had a clear hold of him and wasn’t letting go.
Draco’s eye twitched at the idea of Potter and the other git sharing a flat together but said nothing, wanting Potter to finish, his thumb rubbing against the fabric of his robe’s collar.
His head, which was thrown back, straightened back up as he walked under the showerhead and turned the water on, soaking the lace panties obscenely.
His eyebrows lifted in hilarity at Harry’s expression. “I assure you, I didn’t poison it. This time.”
“Fuck Harry - I always knew you’d be a slut for it. Just look at you.” He then forced the head of his cock against the back of Harry’s throat, and Harry whined at the feeling.
He had a feeling that whoever Typhon was, he was angry with Harry for something. Or he was bored with him.
Fists clenching, Harry turned abruptly, practically ramming into Malfoy, who had followed closely behind him. “I don’t know what has gotten into you. We were getting along just fine, and suddenly I smell that bloody potion, and you have a fucking mind meld! Just admit you are obsessed with me, and we can move past this like adults.”
After what seemed like an hour passed by, and Harry had to swallow his groan of annoyance when his eyes caught the time in the corner where Smith had kept a Tempus charm running to count the minutes of the meeting conveying it had only been fifteen minutes that had passed.
Letting out a long breath of satisfaction as the water hit his face and washed the lingering shampoo from his hair, Harry opened his eyes, and his mouth fell open at once, causing him to almost choke on a heavy stream of water.
Draco mused, as he sauntered back into the room, and
Draco bit his lip, already hating himself immensely for this.
As he handed his outer robes to the gangly younger man by the front door, his heart stopped in his chest at the trio who walked in, almost dropping them in the process.
"Is something wrong with –"
It didn’t even matter that Harry was shit at Legilimency; he could still read Draco like an open book.
“Do you want me to touch you?”
Harry played for a while but then made some excuse to get some peace and quiet and sat on the steps outside the door.
The urge to come back down later hit Harry, if only he knew the other man’s schedule when he got off from work. It had been a while since he had pulled anyone, and he wouldn’t mind some extra company tonight.
But no, that wasn’t it, Draco realized with a pang of realization.
Harry spent the rest of his day in his room in proper form, moping about until sleep finally got him.
At a certain point, Harry realized that he might have miscalculated the time before Draco would dump him by a bit.
And a sinking, sick feeling he knew exactly what was in that book she had been pushing up his arse to read all year suddenly made itself known. It added up together in his head all at once, and he desperately wanted to vomit. Or pass out.
“One of these…
“Maybe it’s time to be really honest with each other,” he says. “Because I think the truth is you’re embarrassed. I know, because I am.”
But of course, his grandfather is still there in the morning, discreetly looking in the other direction as Harry wanders into the living area without getting dressed, fumbling the air-conditioner on and longing for the spacious cool stone of the Grimmauld kitchen.
At this, Harry shifts uneasily, his face heating up. “Not exactly—”
“Speed is going to be key,” Hermione reiterates.
She slides a spreadsheet across the desk to him.
“I think we can cope with

a Pensieve. Harry sucks in a sharp breath as he sees them all in the kitchens, crouched by the door.
Harry finds himself swivelling to look at actual-Malfoy, who now just looks uncomfortable. Malfoy refuses to meet his eye.
The slimy, bulbous feel of it is almost more than Harry can bear, but the sooner they get out of this place the better. He clutches the rope and dives.
This sounded like fun a week ago in the dying days of summer in Cornwall. A lark to set up their last months at school the right way. Make them the legends of seventh year. But now, the reality of lying to his mother about a study group and sneaking off on this harebrained scheme with his friends is quickly losing its appeal. Robert curses as a branch snaps back from Carl’s hand, scratching his arm.
“Master Malfoy Senior, sir,” Holber replies, not stumbling at all over the cascade of titles.
Malfoy is already surreptitiously tapping his wand to the lock as Harry jogs up, opening the door.
“Well, even a ten year old managed to work that out,” Harry says with a shrug. “I didn’t need a Curse Breaker to tell me I needed to do the tasks.” He did, of course, need a ten year old, but he doesn’t need to tell Malfoy that.
Harry wrinkles his nose at the idea of having to describe his recent run of disasters to Malfoy. Maybe Sato will help him instead. She seems nice, although Harry can’t actually recall seeing her
As the guests start to arrive he finds himself drifting back and forth between the Floo and the garden, watching as his friends and family arrive. If anyone is puzzled about being scanned by Aurors, they don’t seem to show it. Even Dawlish barely blinks at the standard trace before striding out to the garden. He snatches up a flute of champagne and downs it quickly, but doesn’t otherwise seem particularly on his guard.
It’s a bit hard to describe that he’s being thwarted by a series of unconnected mishaps involving blocked Floos, broken decorations, and a sinister advent calendar, so Harry just shrugs.
He flushes, thinking about their last encounter and her parting words.
He shakes his head to clear it, carries their glasses to the kitchen leaving them in the sink, and heads home.
Prompt Ten:
Draco turns the tumbler around and around in his hand. “And I’m sorry. For so many things. I’m not sure what your friends have told you about what I’m doing here, but I would like the opportunity to make amends. If you’re willing.”
Ron’s eyes narrow: he’s considering the idea, even though he clearly doesn’t like it.
Harry Potter? How the fuck do you teach them anything new? I just needed you to fly one simple manoeuvre, but even that’s too much if it means assisting me—is that it?”
. “Apparently when you told Dawlish you were going to go public with your relationship with Malfoy at your birthday party, they decided to set this whole thing in motion. Two birds with one stone, really. They’d get to stop their war hero’s relationship with someone they revile, and they’d get a political puppet to advance their agenda. Disgusting.”
"Green
and his
Harry takes a beat too long to answer, and Malfoy’s expression starts to shutter again.
They each roll their clothes and shrink them, adding them to their packs, and then seal the packs tightly with layers of waterproofing charms.
“Look, you told Ron you were with Zabini all evening, but that’s not true. I saw you in the East Wing.”
“Look, mate,” Harry presses on. “You know I know the rules. I’m not going to stick my nose in or make your life difficult. I’m just going to sit there and listen, and then I can tell her that nothing untoward is going on. Better me than some toff advocate who’ll just get under your feet.”
It’s the first of December, he thinks, as he hangs the calendar on an empty wall beside the hearth and opens the door labelled “1”.  Rather than being completely empty, the back wall of the little wooden space is decorated with a drawing of a wreath hanging on a door. Surprised, Harry opens a few others, but they’re all plain and unadorned as if for some reason it's unfinished. Confused, he leaves the first door standing open. He can buy some trinkets to hide in the other tiny cupboards for Rose and Hugo to find.
Robards is just a petty-minded bureaucrat. And Harry will find a way to get them a office that isn’t about one-third occupied by rattling steam pipes eventually. Besides, no one really

Granger gets to her feet.
At half-time, the team look so distressed, Harry wants to put them all out of their misery. They could call it quits now and all be home resting in their beds before the game is even scheduled to end.
Draco feels so very vulnerable. Like he wants to cover his face with his hands. Potter downs his drink again. Draco wants to make some sort of snide remark about the quality of the single malt that he’s throwing back like it’s crappy shots of Ogden’s but he manages to refrain.
Carl is staring at them both, eyes wide, clutching at the strap of the camera bag strung over his shoulder. It holds his father’s wizarding camera, so they can prove they’ve been inside. His knuckles are white where he grips the dark leather.
“Stable. But no better.” He straightens up, and wands Belle’s chart to the foot of the bed. Harry can almost feel his armour slot back into place, unwilling to show any weakness, as he strides out of the room without another word.
He’s aware of all the places his body aches — the way he feels a kind of bone-deep exhaustion, like after a day of duelling training or a particularly tough raid. But he feels cocooned and warm. A pillow is soft under his face and he’s wrapped in luxurious sheets. He blinks slowly, feeling his eyes swim a little as they try to adjust.
“It’s going to take me a little longer,” he concedes one evening, as Harry and Draco levitate the children up the stairs to Teddy’s bedroom. The pair of them had fallen asleep in front of a movie that they’d sworn they were absolutely not too tired to watch.
Harry gets to the Ministry just as the main entrance hall is starting to fill with employees starting their days. The Welcome Witch gives him a smile and a wave, so he decides to chance it in Archives and Records. He’s not actually sure what he is and isn’t allowed to do while suspended, but there’s only one way to find out.
Harry sits down on the edge of his own narrow bed. Harry’s chest feels too tight. He needs all of them to be okay. To get through this and to find Ron and to get back outside to Neville.
“What? I… yes. Yes, I am,” he says with as much conviction as he can muster as he takes a slug of his old fashioned.
wants. He kisses with passion and urgency, tugging Harry down on top of him. Harry feels lost in the heat of him through the thin covers, the cool touch of his fingertips sliding under Harry’s shirt and along his lower back.
Prompt Twenty:
Only when every single new decoration is hung can Hermione finally convince Rose to put her coat back on so they can go and look after Hugo and let Ron get to the pub.
Harry’s mouth falls open in horror. He’s about to leap to his feet and take matters into his own hands, but Lucius beats him to it, standing abruptly and swaying under the influence of all the wine he’s consumed.
t-shirt she’s wearing.
“My mother obviously wasn’t the only one in her situation. Once I was sure it had worked, I offered to help the families of other Death Eaters. Those Kissed deserved everything they got and more. But often they’d left behind wives and children who were powerless to stop them in their ascendancy, and powerless to provide for themselves now their husbands were gone.
“And where is your young man?” Molly has a twinkle in her eye that looks positively mischievous. Harry feels his face heat.
“So what are we going to do?” Regardless of Malfoy’s motivations, the reality is that they still have a dysfunctional team and no ability to work together. Harry’s not sure there’s any sensible way to change that.
Malfoy disappears into the ensuite with a snort that sounds disbelieving and suspiciously smug.
“That’s it,” she murmurs.
be suggesting we start allowing players to blow things up. If we wanted to play Quodpot we’d move to the New World.”
“Come on,” he says, grabbing her arm with a smile as they head to the Floos. “Let’s get cleaned up and get a drink.”
“Thank you,” he’d said, reaching for words of apology he wasn’t sure how to pull together.
With the scarf, carrot nose, and some coals for eyes, the snowman looks—if not exactly picturesque—passably like the one in the calendar. Inside by the sitting room fire, Harry’s relieved to find the calendar agrees. Not only is the fifteenth door glowing happily, but the room feels warm, and Harry’s pile of Christmas crackers—cheap and tacky when he’d bought them from the corner store—seem to have transformed. There’s now three times as many of them, more than enough for the whole family, decorated with holly and tied at each end with red ribbons.
“Was Malfoy with you?”
The second part of the ritual begins and the four of them now have to bring their spells into alignment. Draco’s magic knits neatly together with his own, closing the circle far more cleanly than Theo’s ever did during their rehearsals. Harry has to force himself to focus so that he doesn’t get distracted by the intimate clasp of it, as all-encompassing as the feeling of Draco’s arms around him the night before.
“You’re always telling me
He’ll deal with Ron’s ire later. Right now, he has to find Draco.
“But how does that—”
“Don’t what?”
It’s suddenly very quiet in the garden. He can hear the fire under the grill crackle and pop.
Neville takes his empty response at face value. “And the party, how was that?”
Hermione returns promptly, Gibbens lolling around her heels like an overeager puppy.
He holds out his hand for Harry to grasp.
He feels terrible then. He has more Galleons than he knows what to do with, a house of his own, and almost anyone in the wizarding world would hire him. Draco’s the last person he should be moaning to.

It will be fine.
Most people have the
It’s far too cold to just keep standing there, shifting his weight from one foot to another. There’s a warm-looking pub across the street, and Harry very much wants to suggest a drink, but Draco’s headed on duty and how would Harry even ask, anyway? Draco’s only going to say no, and it’s going to be cutting and dismissive, and probably in French.
“All the more reason for him to do
He expects to see that familiar flicker of annoyance or confusion, but Harry just smiles more broadly.
“I can’t stand England,” she hisses at Malfoy as she leaves. “Never forget that I’m doing this for you.”
“Mother retires early,” Draco says, which is about as good an answer as Harry could want for, particularly given the way Draco’s cheeks look pink and his expression is pleased, though he seems to be trying to hide it behind his mug.
but would secretly love.
“Between 11pm — when you left after the argument,” Ron says, “and midnight. No later than that the Medi-Aurors think.”
“Draco, that’s part of the fun,” Luna chides, as Malfoy comes up to the desk beside them, opening a folder and proceed to start filling out a form in cramped, neat script.
On Thursday, a package is delivered to the Ministry’s Muggle entrance, clearly addressed to Harry, containing a pair of extremely expensive leather gloves and no explanation. He uses the Muggle phonebox nearby to call the retailer to ask about the mix-up and how to send them back and gets an extremely snooty response from the owner saying that there are
Draco coughs until his back aches, and Lovegood hands him a yellow lace handkerchief as he realises his nose is bleeding.
“No, honestly, I live around the corner.” Which isn’t exactly true of course, but around the corner he can hide the tree behind a pub and Apparate with it directly back to his sitting room.
“And you told Narcissa this? Did she reply? ”
. “But you don’t seem…surprised to see me here?”
“I’ll see you for breakfast in the morning,” he assures her, giving her a hug as he heads outside.
“There’s no filthy little elf to whisk you away this time, Mudblood,” Bellatrix laughs. “I’ll
, he hears Luna’s voice in his head.
“I slept in the girl’s dorm last night because I snore quite loudly. When I went to find everyone just now...something’s gone wrong.”
“I’m right here,” says Harry. “And, no, I didn’t kill him, but you see what we’ve done, right?”
Harry hugs them both and promises he will call on them if needed. The paths in the park have been cleared, and as he walks back towards the house, looking at the lamps start to light against the winter afternoon gloom, Harry thinks that his impulsiveness will turn out fine. It’s just a meal after all, and he’s got a whole month to plan it. A tree. A few decorations. He’s pretty sure there’s even a box of them among all the stuff he’s stored in the attic. That seems like a sensible enough place to start.
Draco mumbles something that might be words. He feels Harry push his hair back from his forehead and leave a glancing kiss against his skin. He’s asleep before he hears the door close.
take Harry,” Draco says crouching in front of the furious little boy, as Potter comes down the stairs, looking about as sullen as Teddy. “Your godfather’s always been pants on a broom. Maybe you can teach him something. I certainly never could.”
“No.”
“Look ’Mione, unlike you, I don’t have much idea how any of this works,” Ron replies. “However, we’ve had a couple of non-magical crimes lately, and this team from the Met has been brilliant. They come in. We use a mild Confundus Charm so they think we’re something called ‘Special Branch’. They do their thing. And if we’re lucky, they find some of that
“I don’t know what you’re being smug about,” Parkinson snaps at him. “A traitorous piece of work you turned out to be.”
Harry tensed when he felt Malfoy twitch beside him.
“Well, it was all
Harry didn’t think much of the news, having more important things to occupy his mind this year, with his classes, and studying for the inevitable N.E.W.T.S, which honestly began to be more than a bit of a bore after the first month of being back.
There just always seemed to be something in the way, every time.
Then he remembered that Typhon had sent him a new song, so he rushed to pull out his mobile, casting a soft
Groaning pitifully, he desperately prayed that Malfoy doesn’t find the flogger he packed with him. But another part of him painfully hoped that Malfoy
Harry shuddered pleasantly, feeling slightly damp in his pants.
Harry felt a warmth flow through him, and he immediately pushed himself further into his mattress; a familiar stirring of arousal pulsing through him just from the words of the song alone.
Draco made a strangled sound above him and thrust hard a few more times before pulling out quickly, and Harry gasped, watching as Draco shattered.
Draco exhaled shakily, watching as Potter’s chest heaved with his heavy breathing intermingled with moans and grunts as Draco grazed his prostate with each thrust. Then, Draco wanted to melt into the floor as Potter started begging, “There! Yes, oh god, don’t stop!”
His eyes found the slender man at one of the front tables in class, as he was meticulously chopping his ingredients, the knife shining against the low light of the classroom, his fingers delicately moving the chopped ingredients into neat piles.
When he walked in, he was surprised that the outside of the establishment did not match the inside. He was greeted by a chandelier hanging from the ceiling and circular tables lined with white tablecloths.
Draco Malfoy coming with his name on his lips.
The gorgeous prat was wearing nothing but a delicious Gryffindor red silk robe that ended right under his arse. His hair looked deliciously disarrayed on his head, looking as if he had just gotten laid.
- his inner voice reminded him, as it had all week, as he paced his dining room floor in agony over whether or not he should show up.
Harry huffed in amusement before a particular thrust had him melting into the bed, “Fuck Draco! No offense, but I don’t particularly want to think about any Weasley while in bed with you, ah, pounding my arse.”
Speaking of Hermione, when she wasn’t in the library studying or breathing down Harry’s neck, her and Ron,
I suppose that’s the Gryffindor in you. Come on, let’s stop and get take-out before they close for the night. Thai sound good?”
Harry brooded into his own beer, playing with the condensation on the side instead of drinking it as he mulled over his and his friend’s past hour-long conversation.
Knowing Malfoy put in extra magical work in his free time to pleasure himself in this way had Harry’s hips moving forward on instinct. He felt the need to come approaching already; the fact that Malfoy had been speaking to him and staring at him like he was some tasty morsel he was about to consume was more than enough to encourage his erection back to full hardness.
Malfoy’s eyes caught Harry’s as soon as his “date” wrapped an arm around him in his seat possessively as he sat down. Harry immediately flinched away, feeling somewhat resentful towards Smith for ruining what could have been a moment.
Graciously opening his mouth wider to accommodate him, Harry moaned again, the feeling of the man’s cock grazing the back of his throat. He wanted to plead with him to go further, deeper, and to pull back and let him breathe all at the same time.
Pliant under his boyfriend’s touch, Draco took this as a sign to slip one finger inside him, and Harry’s mouth went dry.
That night of the dance was a one-time thing and could never happen again.
And Justin being so far up Draco’s arse.
“Oh, quite splendid Potter. Now, are we going to continue this pointless drivel, or are we going to announce the elephant in the room?”
Two months passed since the incident in Knockturn Alley, but seeing Potter in the flesh, dressed to the nines as he smiled softly at something Weasley said next to him, brought all those memories back in one swoop.
But just like that, Draco stopped, the pressure gone, and Potter cried out beautifully.
Rather than holding out on himself, Harry thought it’d be best if tonight he wanked this time with Malfoy. Not like it would hurt anyone or anything for that matter.
Potter’s expression had thoroughly gone from the calm and collected version on top of his game with Kingsley. To now, where he looked a mix between utterly nauseous and a nervous wreck. His eyes darted from Weasley to Granger, obviously trying to convey to them something or another to them silently.
Draco flinched and stood from his undignified crouch from behind the doorman’s table, swiftly nodding before following another couple back into the main area, ensuring he was at least a few feet behind the golden trio.
“You know - you could just send them a song back,” Dean offered as he played his turn in Exploding Snap back in the common room later that evening.
He eyed the elaborate cock ring still wrapped around Potter’s perfect cock, and hated it. Thinking about all the things he could do with it without the metal contraption on him had his mind whirling.
Like a bludger to the head, Harry stopped, realizing that he was in love with this mystery person cutting him open.
“But we soon realized that this was real for him. The songs, and all that heartfelt rubbish. Ridiculously Hufflepuff if you ask me.” She faked gagging, and Bulstrode sniggered.
Or that he couldn’t look away from that ridiculous swim cap of his. Apparently, the chlorine in Muggle pools had him worried for its safety, which Harry found incredibly amusing.
Like earlier, when Malfoy grabbed his arm and pulled him back right as a green stream of light, almost nicked him, ripping his robes in the process, but also saving his life.
really to get his point across to the oblivious man.
Snatching his hand back quickly as if it were burned, his eyes widened comically as the realization hit him upside the head like a bludger bat.
So Harry slunk around the secret hallways that he never could venture to before, finding a strange delight in it.
Harry had to bite his bottom lip to hold back any arguments. He frankly wasn’t in the mood to rile the other man up or vice versa. But he couldn’t help but notice the way Malfoy’s eyes were watching his mouth, enraptured as if he was waiting for an explosion to indeed happen.
“And I guess the first idea that popped into my mind was…”
It made Harry want to button up the few buttons he left open in the front of his shirt.
Draco couldn’t manage to finish his sentence, as the familiar warmth of his second orgasm shuttered through him just from fucking into Harry alone and watching him come undone underneath him.
Instead of his usual response to Seamus ogling other men and commenting on them, Dean only nodded along with his boyfriend, both men’s gazes glued to Malfoy’s swaying arse as if their lives depended on it.
He came with long stripes all over his chest, his mouth open in a low groan as his orgasm ripped through him.
After about two minutes of this, Harry growled out, “Malfoy, are you
He held both hands to his mouth in an effort to hide any unwelcome sounds and also partially hide any debauched expressions that his face might give away.
Harry’s hands sweated as he glanced over the album sleeve, where there was a clear view of a man’s jean covered crotch in the center. “Erm - they had quite the artistic expression?”
“It looks like I’m not the one that sentiment applies to at the moment.” Malfoy drawled, his left foot almost touching the wet floor of the shower as he took yet another step closer.
Harry felt his whole body heat up; the shots must have just hit him in one fell swoop. His vision wavered as the bright lights illuminated Malfoy’s figure from the stage.
“I come here every few months to escape life.”
Even though he had been getting them on the regular every day for the past month, his chest hurt as he considered the possibility that maybe Typhon was tired of him.
“Yeah erm,
It was becoming abundantly clear that Harry should have been less concerned about Luna and more worried about Hermione going on and on; as she started her statement for the planned meeting. Harry hadn’t realized how long he had blanked out during it until Ron sneezed, bringing back into the present.
Draco nodded, first finishing the remainder of his drink and vanishing the glass, not bothering to place it back on the bar.
“Rotten luck.” Neville shook his head, “Maybe I should offer them dancing lessons?”
As a matter of fact, Draco would hardly mention Justin at all around Harry. And it became somewhat of an odd subject when anyone brought him up around Harry.
A whimper came from Malfoy then, and Harry knew he was seconds from coming as he watched, entranced, as his classmate’s hand then suddenly halted, as his cock twitched and he was suddenly coming, his head thrown back and his mouth open with a breathy gasp.
“Let me know if you need
His hands lightly ran over the small stack of thin, colorful packages.
He watched as Harry’s wrists sagged against the ropes that were still tying him up, head turned to the side.
Harry’s eyes followed the other man’s form as he got dressed, toweling through his damp hair, and walked out.
Harry’s heart hammered in his chest as Malfoy’s lips began to upturn in a small smile -
Harry jumped a foot in the air before turning around to the sight of Malfoy standing there, dressed to the nines and looking like he would rather be anywhere but here, acting as if he wasn’t the one to invite him out to begin with!
He figured it was for the best all-around; he didn’t want to deal with a drunk Seamus trying to snog everyone like last year.
When the last hour was up, he slammed the previous book shut and turned back to his music, clearly offending Madam Pince.
“Potter.” Malfoy’s shocked face transformed quickly into a look of complete rage, his knuckles white from his grip on his microphone. “Stop -”
One of Iain’s eye twitched but nodded shortly and went off before Harry could ask for anything, apologize for the Slytherin's behavior, or desperately explain to his only hope of getting laid in the next week and a half that Malfoy wasn’t his boyfriend and that they weren't...like that.
If anything, it would be a funny story to tell Pansy later. If only he could figure out what it was that Potter was whispering about.
“Tessie’s. Yeah.” Ron looked as though he was about to cry into his breakfast, and Harry patted his back as Ginny laughed raucously across the table at her brother’s unfortunate expense.
A few more seconds passed of the awkward staring contest between them, and Draco gritted his teeth, not able to stand this ridiculousness any longer.
Harry’s eyes practically rolled to the back of his head in response to the praise, his speed increasing as Draco’s thrusts became a tad faster and more aggressive, Harry’s eyes watering from being used in such a way.
, allowing it to happen, with no complaints whatsoever.
“Erm - sorry?”
Harry raised an eyebrow of his own in retaliation, knowing full and well it wasn’t as articulately and gracefully done as Malfoy himself.
He could feel the wetness pooling in his trousers and wondered if it would stain with pants to catch it.  But the worry went flying out the window when the muttering got a decibel louder, and Draco bit back a whimper, nonchalantly moving his left hand down to his lap, lightly rubbing at himself through his trousers.
“What is your damn middle name anyway? No, no, it doesn’t matter, and I don’t care! Just get your ruddy arse down from there right now. We need to speak. Now!”
A few minutes later, or it could have been hours, Draco wasn’t sure; he took his hand away, and Harry grumbled something under his breath, and Draco tutted.
Harry had to remember how to breathe again.
A faint blush swept across Malfoy’s neck that the Slytherin hastened to cover up with his robes as he hopped back onto the bed, picking up his quill to quietly work again, less demanding than before. Harry looked down at his work to hide his smile.
“Yes, Harry.” The feeling of spelling out that name, foreign as it was, on his tongue was indescribable, and he needed more. “Harry, Harry, look at you. Merlin, just for me. No one else, but for me. Look at me; it’s okay.”
“Even though he tells us all about it anyway, unasked even,” Theo muttered miserably.
"You should listen to your elf, Harry. He has served this family for generations and knows this house much better than you.”
The Sectumsempra scars were visible, barely, through the water, and Harry didn’t think the man could have looked any more delectable at that moment. He leaned in closer, suddenly needing the feel of his hands on him, desperately, when a loud clearing of a throat had him freezing up.
for that matter.
But a week passed, and he knew there was no way in hell he could ever forget. He ruminated the possibility of
Every morning, he would wake up to a new song from the same person, using the moniker
“You’re being wilfully obtuse.”
“If you’ll excuse me, Harry,” he says, every inch the polite, calm professional they were both trained to be, but only one of them ever actually was. “I’ll need you to leave the room now until we’ve established what’s happened.”
house, in
Harry wishes the marble would open up below his feet and swallow him. He’s an incredibly capable and successful law enforcement officer when Malfoy’s not around. There’s just something about this unbelievably buttoned-up blond that unravels all of Harry’s composure.
“First time for everything, ‘spose.”
“I want the truth, Mr Potter,” she replies, and certainly seems to mean it. She shakes his hand and then hurries away.
,” Hannah explains, pulling out a sack of shrunken fruit and returning it to full size. “The kitchen needs something to do.” She hands out the apples and oranges. “On the count of three, throw them onto the bench.”
“Hello, Melinda!” Harry’s delighted to have solved that particular social conundrum without having to ask.
Harry’s anger blows itself out, and he sags back against a locker. He glances up at Draco, who has fallen quiet.
. But he knows Blaise actually understands. Draco needs certainty in his life. He needs to know the people around him are people he can count on. People he can trust. People who will stay.
“I was an idiot, Hermione. He’d written all of you those letters and—”
Potter looks around the bar, taking it in. “I guess it must be nice to be somewhere long enough to have a local.” He says
“Oh, don’t worry. Wizards haven’t hunted real animals for generations,” Neville assures her quickly.
what it means, Potter. Hexes are now one of the tools available to this team, legitimately, under the rules of the game. Not using them is akin to flying with your hands tied behind your back.”
grounds?”
Luna nods, blowing the steam over her cup.
“Seriously, Malfoy — I don’t mind our... arrangement, but this is really fucked up. I have no idea why you’ve brought any of us here or put any of us in this situation and if you think sex will make any of it better…”
Potter snorts.
Draco waits. The silence in the kitchen becomes thick.
“We should sleep,” he manages finally, wishing his voice didn’t sound quite so hoarse, forcing himself to get into bed and face the other direction.
. I want to do something that
Here is this story's
All the breath leaves Harry in a huffed laugh.
He exhales heavily, slumping back in relief, adrenaline still coursing through his veins. He puts the wand down and raises a trembling hand to cast the diagnostics.
“You’re not really going to do this, are you?” Hermione seems to be mid-rant as Harry joins them at their table. There’s no sign of Malfoy.
Harry walks back to the Leaky and extends his booking for a week. He knows that if he mentioned it, Andromeda would insist on him staying at Grimmauld Place, but the thought of it has Harry feeling trapped. Claustrophobic. His in-and-out flying visit is slipping out of his control. What would he even say to Hermione if he saw her now?
Hermione hums in a noncommittal way.
“Broke the case on Thorfinn Rowle single handedly,” confided Cho, when Malfoy first turned up at the Ministry.
“I expect Parkinson made them both a package deal. The goblins don’t care about much if they’re going to get paid. You’re really sure there’s no way out of this for me?”
bond. Its magic feels untethered. Unbalanced. Unstable. Like half of something is missing that it needs to be whole. The magic of the ring reaches out constantly, and unable to find its match, teeters. Like a seesaw.
“So, you’re assuming she snuck over, waited until I finished arguing with my father, and then… what? Let herself into his study, cast a spell so no one would hear her, and murdered him?”
“Let’s eat,” Lovegood suggests. “I brought a radish and nettle soup Rolf made last night that’s delicious.”
make lists.
Draco looks shell-shocked. Harry feels more like he’s been expecting this disappointment—or something like it—all along.
Draco opens his mouth to object, but then closes it again. He looks around at the courtyard.
is going to pay you to sit there, the least you could do is stand up for him.”
Malfoy’s raspy voice in his ear had Harry shaking; he wasn’t sure if he would be able to hold his legs up at this rate.
Harry’s grin widened when he felt Draco’s chest move in small titters. “Yes. I suppose that is what it means.”
“I left my wand at home,” Harry admitted, setting his water down as gently as he could, trying to ignore his magic thrumming inside of him, just wanting to be unleashed. Malfoy always made him feel this way, and Harry hated it.
Draco reached up towards Harry’s face; Harry expected a light caress but instead was rewarded with a pinch to his cheek. “Aw look at you Potter - er,
Harry grabbed the wine glass from the pale man and sat it on a side table before diving back into the kiss, straddling Draco’s hips this time, wanting to plaster himself entirely to the other man.
“Ah yes, Master Black. Even the other day as I was sweeping the floors upstairs, minding my own business, mind you, Master Potter came trudging through the living room completely in the nude, of all things –”
Harry kept finding his eyes drifting between his mates, who were complaining about Gryffindor’s quidditch team, to Malfoy and his lot across the bar. Harry took in Malfoy’s unusually pleasing demeanor as his expression broke into a wry grin at whatever it was Zabini was going on about.
Harry bit back a surprised curse as the elf appeared out of nowhere again, glaring down at Kreacher. But Kreacher ignored Harry and instead stared up at Malfoy with wide eyes as if he himself hung up the moon.
Draco and himself had gone on their long-planned trip to Switzerland with the Weasley-Parkinson clan, and Harry was damned if he had to change the dates for any ridiculous work reason. So taking a meeting during vacation was the only option he had.
After Hogwarts, the two of them hit it off incredibly so at the academy, much to the surprise of everyone around them. And now, here he was, showering in Malfoy’s expensive and specifically sexy shower.
The man in question huffed out an ugly laugh, “This happens to be my scene, and that -” he pointed to Potter like he was yesterday’s trash and Draco growled, “- just happens to be my boyfriend. But you already knew that, didn’t you. I did invite you, not my request, I can assure you of that.” Jakob then eyed his boyfriend with distrust before his eyes glinted back to Draco.
please. You can do whatever you want to me, whatever you want at all. Just please...please, please-”
A small clearing of a throat had Harry opening his eyes to a slightly sheepish Draco standing a few feet away. “Mind if I join you?”
He was too far away for Harry to see clearly, but he could tell he had to be well-seasoned if the muscles along his back were anything to go by.
Unless Ron was right, and this person truly had him on.
Harry went ahead and paid for his drinks; there was no way in hell he was staying here. He figured he could make his excuses to go to the loo once his “date” got back and scram from there.
He figured it might make things easier if he attempted to hold a conversation with the bastard, so Harry finished filling up his glass and began to make his way to the couple he had been eyeing most of the night.
“Potter? Do you care to explain what your department could do to help with Granger’s proposal?”
Glancing around frantically at the table, he spotted a shot of Ogden’s that Seamus hadn’t taken yet and snatched it up, to the complaints of his friend. He downed it in one go and jumped from the table, made his way back towards the stage where Malfoy was standing there in all his glory, singing
Even if she had tried, the girl in question couldn’t have seemed more thrilled that Harry had even looked at her, let alone spoken words directed to her in particular.
Somewhere deep down inside himself, he knew he was going to look again.
"I don't think this is house-elf magic. It's more likely an ancient curse placed on the house by Sirius's ancestors. You will need to contact a professional curse breaker to lift it."
"Indeed it would, Master Black," said Kreacher, then turned to Harry. "The Mistress' and Master's portraits would also appreciate it if you ceased walking the halls without any clo–"
He pushed inside a few inches before pulling out and pushed back a few more before pulling out again. And kept the process up until he was fully snug inside Harry.
“Are you ready?”
He grabbed the newest toy, lightly touched the velvet feel of it before shutting the drawers, and he heard Harry’s intake of breath at that. Like he was waiting on pins and needles for his return.
"Harry, do you have any objections?"
Harry clenched his teeth so hard he felt his jaw creak. He could tell that Smith was clearly blowing smoke from his pasted-on sneer.
Harry closed his eyes, images instantly filled his head; he groaned and opened his eyes, biting his lip in a desperate attempt to think of
A few moments of pure bliss later, Harry wriggled a bit under him,
Draco sucked and licked Harry’s arsehole as if it was one of his favorite ice creams from Fortescue’s. Harry bit his tongue so hard to keep it from erupting in pure wanton moans; he could taste the blood in his mouth.
“I would never have imagined that Weaselbee had the bollocks to dance in front of others,” he noted under his breath so just Harry could hear, watching as Harry took an experimental sniff, eyeing the drink with unease.
Malfoy took out his wand and wordlessly cleaned up the mess and mended his quill.
It was probably close to the sixth time Slughorn had caught him listening to his music; the fourth time, he was sent to McGonagall and only received one of the strongest eye-rolls he had ever witnessed, along with a biscuit.
"I think putting the rug back in order would go a long way of showing the house that you respect it and its ancestors."
and began walking, past a few more doors lining down the walls of the barren hallway before him.
Harry bit the inside of his cheek as he pondered what song he could possibly send, his heart doing its stupid fluttering in his chest again. It had been doing that far too often for Harry’s liking as of recent.
Just to think, that morning, he had woken up to one of the most beautiful songs he had ever heard.
Harry groaned in approval as he sucked ever harder around the man, desperate for whatever he could give him.
“Are you ready, sir?”
Harry frowned though; instead of feeling his joggers that had adorned his lower-half, now he felt the air hit his bare legs.
Harry didn’t particularly want to remember Luna’s last Christmas party, Malfoy drunk off his arse, and jumping Harry under the mistletoe.
That’s what made Justin so interesting to Harry, having made it past Draco’s usual two-week cut he always kept to.
Harry felt suddenly irrationally angry at his friends for talking about him, but the feeling vanished as soon as it arrived. “Er - yeah. I’ve had no one - I mean nothing to do. Besides work. So yeah.”
“Uh - Malfoy, please give it to me.”
Harry chalked the last one all up to him, listening to Typhon’s songs on repeat to the point of hearing them in his subconscious.
Malfoy straightened in the water, eyes staying stuck to Harry as he moved even closer, and Harry didn’t realize how close to the edge of the pool they were until his back hit the concrete wall.
Usually, Harry would have thrown a massive fit at how Malfoy was treating his stuff, throwing his clothes and other items around the room as he searched, but watching the man closely inspect all the sexual items he brought ignited a new flame within him.
But Harry still felt rigid in his hold.
that he had never mentioned before to Harry. Only the standard thank you occurred, not even a blush to his cheeks or stammering of questioning after the fact as he stuffed it back into the box, surely to use at a later date.
Because it was hot outside.
The action alone had his cock plump up even further in his pants, and he wanted nothing more than to reach down to touch himself. But something about this current moment they were in made him want to give all his attention to the man before him.
He considered dragging Potter to the nearest loo to finish this off properly. Still, the feeling of standing on the side of a busy club, lights flickering in and out, sweaty bodies writhing around them, was almost enough to finish him off.
Ron only snickered, and Harry turned the sound off its speaker setting.
But then again, this might be the first year where he can have a good time, and be outrageous and fun, and a little immature for the first time in his life.
They were, after all, both handsome blokes. What’s wrong with appreciating beauty when it appears in front of you?
“Just imagine what an ‘I’m so sorry, Harry, for all the torment I put you through the years’ could get you.” Potter rubbed his hips against Draco’s deliciously, and he almost lost his mind at the obvious arousal he was feeling from the other man.
“Malfoy?”
“Scratch that, let’s send Hermione that new prototype. I’m sure she’ll appreciate it.”
“Oh, this? Yeah, I uh...am really quite intrigued by the uh - Romans. And the Greeks. And their history.”
Obendiately, Harry sucked his finger into his mouth, and Draco grabbed his erection through his pants to relieve some tension. Harry will be the death of him; he was sure of it.
The Slytherin threw his head back, baring his pale neck as he came all over the man on the ground in front of him.
Draco sighed again as the snow crunched under his feet. He saw Harry glance at him from the corner of his eye and felt his hand tighten around his.
“Of course! Any friend of Draco is a friend of mine.”
working with Malfoy after his little incident in his bed a few weeks prior, but he has felt... tense.
If there had been any doubt from the last time, there was no mistaking it this time; Malfoy’s gaze was directed solely at him.
Seeing as Draco had Justin in his life, well, that made things a tad more complicated. Every time he asked him to come over and hang out for a bit, the blond always had some flimsy excuse that always included his boyfriend.
Harry breathed in deeply and counted to five. He wasn’t sure if he was currently up to dealing with Malfoy if he was in a teasing mood. “Erm - nothing. Just some things I need to sort out before I completely lose it.”
Doomed, hopeless...now those were words he could heavily relate to as he eyed Zacharias Smith, sitting across from him taking shot after shot on a “date” he asked him for earlier, on a wild whim before their Charms class.
But here, it was just Malfoy and Harry. No one else to intrude or stare.
A few times, he came so close to sending Malfoy something in response, just to try to wrangle another response from him, but when he cornered and asked Parkinson if that would be a good idea, she had just cackled.
“Answer me,” Draco brought down a hand and squeezed it around the base of Potter’s cock, groaning at the feeling of wetness on his hand from where he had been leaking the whole time.
But Potter’s expression was far too sly for his liking under the lights of the club, his green eyes knowing.
“Two, I need a safe-word.”
Moving more quickly than he would have typically done for their first time (and the fact that he has ideas for times after this should have given Draco pause), he backed Harry up into a wall, a tremor of excitement ran through him at the sight of Potter willingly being pushed and handled.
“He’s the one hosting the party, Potter. No need to be so like that about it.” Malfoy answered, with a smirk etched on his face, still facing the ceiling, but running a thumb over Harry’s side, “And he’s a friend who gives me free alcohol on occasion.”
And he wasn’t about to send a Patronus to Malfoy, that’s for damned sure.
Potter kept his steadfast and thoughtful gaze on him and took a step closer away from the club’s wall. He looked as though he had made up his mind about something, nodding to himself.
All the heat and frustration left Harry’s body in one quick swoop as he watched Malfoy’s shaking hands. He knew there was no physical altercation in their future; his grip on his wand slackened as he took his hand from his robes.
“Because you tend to be a bit possessive over him,” Hermione stated once when Harry had asked the others why Draco left one afternoon.
“Remind me to send Hermione flowers.”
Instead, he stirred himself and watched Malfoy’s pointy face as he meticulously poured the last of the powdered moonstone into their potion.
Harry blearily looked up to see both Malfoy and Rodrick gazing down at him with looks stuck between amusement and pity.
Harry only watched as the conversation moved in a different direction as Draco went on, speaking on the new law the Ministry just enacted with an air of distaste as he read from the
Harry knew from the first night that he wouldn’t have the strength to sit through another show of Malfoy wanking himself without some sort of other stimulation, he went ahead and drew out his already half-hard cock from his trousers with shaking hands.
But those nights got repetitive and quite boring, if he was honest.
Harry pursed his lips, eyeing the floating paper as if it was seconds away from exploding into everyone's faces. “What is it?”
He didn’t know why he said it, and Harry immediately regretted it as soon as he saw Malfoy’s expression of disbelief marring his face. He smoothed it out quickly into one of indifference. But he twisted until he faced Harry on the bed.
“I could ask you the same question,
They were all standing by the (unfortunately untouched) punch bowl (thanks to McGonagall) staring at each other and laughing at all the awkward fourth years. Some of the boys seemed to be failing at asking the girls to dance if their up-turned noses were anything to go by.
But tonight, Draco was on a mission to keep his distance from a certain bespeckled man.
Harry grimaced as his mind was whirling with all the possibilities of Malfoy’s bed partners, when he saw the man start to slowly strip the robe off his shoulders, allowing it to fall to the ground of the lavatories.
Nodding, he followed Iain, and they both took a see-through elevator up into the hotel.
Like after a heavy rainstorm, the smell of trees assaulted his senses, along with the familiar scent of the delicate sweetness of treacle tart.
They haven’t shown up yet or any of the years prior, so Harry assumed it was something only she was privy to. Which honestly suited him just fine.
He then visualized himself lying in his bed later that night, stroking himself off to visuals of Malfoy in the shower, and that almost made him come right then and there, just knowing that in an hour or so, he would be able to satisfy his need.
The autumn wind was blowing rather chilly in his face as the lyrics seeped into his bones in the same cold way, different from the other songs preceding it.
With one last lingering look around, Harry shook his head, feeling a sudden loss in his chest, a morose feeling overtaking him too quickly. It almost had him seeing double.
When Seamus split his abhorrently tight trousers in his attempt at the splits, Zabini decided to join in and cleaned the floor with them, much to Seamus’s anguish.
He managed to get his mind off of the task at hand and those talented hands on his back for a little bit, thinking about the latest Quidditch scores right as Malfoy’s hands reached down into the dip of his back.
Harry rubbed at the back of his head, moving back from the wall to take a deep breath, the exhilaration at the prospect of a new adventure from seconds ago gone, and the feeling replaced with a different kind of excitement.
But he left it be and walked further down, eyeing the meticulously knotted ropes crisscrossing his thighs.
looked to be a little less than a foot long in length and transparent in color, where someone could see right through it. It seemed almost squishy on the inside and hard and smooth on the outside.
The smells of the soaps Malfoy used were also incredible. It immediately made Harry want to snuggle up with the man with a hot cup of cocoa by the common room fire, inhaling his spicy and fruity aroma.
Harry could spot the little details of Malfoy’s long lashes even through the small opening, his wet blond hair plastered to his forehead. Even the pink blushes scattered across his pale skin, not only across his cheeks, making him look even more alive.
He desperately needed to get this project for Slughorn completed so he could devote all his attention to finding out who Typhon was and so he could get on with his life. And forget about Malfoy and his teasing and those fiery looks he was frequently giving him.
They had got past all that pettiness long ago, yet Harry noticed it slipped out sometimes when Draco was irritated with him,  and it made his blood boil.
He wasn’t sure if he wanted Malfoy to slap him again or call him more indecent names; he wasn’t sure of anything except the need to get Draco inside him sooner rather than later.
Harry grinned timidly back, “You think so, eh? Well, I-“
He could feel himself growing harder, and the need to come hit him like a bludger to the stomach, except much more enjoyable.
As the lyrics continued playing, he scanned the room, his whole body circling and his heart beating loud enough to almost drown out the chorus.
“As much as I would love to continue whatever I am sure is a riveting conversation, I must, regrettably, change the subject.”
He thought back to the raid from earlier, nitpicking each step they both took and what could have prevented what could have been a particularly gruesome disaster, and rolled his eyes at the mistakes he made himself. He shouldn’t have just barged in there like a first-year recruit.
Harry opened his mouth to answer when Malfoy’s hand came up to stop him.
Ron and Hermione exchanged a quick glance before nodding to him, synchronized.
“Muggle.”
Draco stood his ground and looked down at the shorter man in great displeasure.
He moaned, unable to contain himself. Potter was so tight around his cock. He expected him to be loose from the other rounds, but the enveloping heat was tight as a vice.
When Hermione gave him another one of her side-eyes, he realized it looked a bit off.  “Harry, do you need some Pepper-Up? You’re looking a bit peaked.”
Was that eyeliner on his top lid?
Blaise Zabini, who Harry knew was relatively close to Malfoy, hadn’t lifted his stern gaze from Harry the entire time.
"Master Black is wise. Kreacher tried to tell Master Potter but he wouldn't listen to Kreacher."
The Minister nodded, and O’Brien continued with his concerns on the subject matter of the meeting. That matter being - well, Harry now couldn’t tell you if someone asked him at wand point. The last five minutes of this blasted meeting had gone thoroughly over his head thanks to his boyfriend’s sinful antics.
Harry remembered earlier that day in Potions, and he’d made a passing comment to Hermione about how he looked a lot less pale than he had in previous years.
He realized then that he had just stuck his dick in a magical sex toy and wanted to laugh at the absurdity of the whole thing if he wasn’t so hard and practically already close to coming.
“It’s alright; it’s for the best anyway. After all, he wasn’t that good in bed either.”
, currently moving one of his clever hands down his chest, getting closer to the waist of his swim trunks.
“Yes, Ronald. Because he hasn’t taken a single bloody day off for
A carnal, desperate sound erupted from Potter; the thrashing against the bonds tripled in intensity, squeezing Draco inside of his hole, impossibly deeper. Draco watched as Potter’s still contained cock leaked pre-come, and he wanted nothing more than to lean down and lick it off.
Malfoy opened his mouth to reply, but Harry wasn’t waiting around to listen to any more of what Malfoy had to say. He fled the classroom, careful not to slam the door on his way out.
Malfoy leaned down further and kissed him deeply, but instead of continuing what he started, he only laid his head down on Harry’s chest, sighing in content.
Later that night they had all had their mobiles out, recording Seamus singing Dean a Celestina Warbeck classic.
Ron looked back and forth between his mates with a growing look of exasperation. “What are you two going on about? Do you -” He looked straight at Harry, a bit green around the gills when he asked,
Before Harry could acknowledge that with any response or breath in for that matter, the blond was up and out of the pool in a flash, pulling a towel over his body, and Harry followed him, tumbling over the side of the pool to rights again and followed him up to the condo.
Thankfully, Harry could see the whole space of the stall as Malfoy made his round. At one point, he waved his prick around with a smirk like it was something to behold.
Yet, he was as red in the face as his Gryffindor robes, his green eyes, usually so bright and clear -- now glazed over and cloudy, as if he had been watching for longer than Draco had even realized. Watching him fall apart over
A light flickered outside, and Draco realized it was coming from Harry, and he reached across the table to take hold of his fist, which was currently radiating with uncontrolled magic.
had been the last one to touch those lips before him, and all of a sudden, all Harry wanted to do was erase all bits of Justin from Draco completely.
"What's that supposed to mean?"
Harry watched as the man’s right hand quickened over his wet cock, his eyes closed in pure pleasure.
Harry clenched hard around their fingers, and Malfoy slapped him on the arse. “Brat,” Malfoy called him almost affectionately.
Oh, for fucks sake.
He blamed his boyfriend, who took it upon himself to cuddle up to him as they made their way through the snow towards their house, for that one.
Harry found himself sighing in relief even before his body hit the hot water of the shower. Today’s mission was supposed to be nothing more than a break-in where they had the hostage confiscated, but it turned out to be all lies, the owner of the shop had been in on it too.
An indigent shout from the other man and a vice-like grip on Harry’s hand had him trying to hold back a wave of laughter. Malfoy’s expression went from relaxed to vengeful in half a second.
But then Potter had to go and ruin it, as he does
Draco eyed him with another look, this time one of pure bafflement. “Oh, come off it, Potter, we haven't had a proper conversation in, well...ever. Maybe this is the universe telling us to get over our petty Hogwarts days.”
Once they were seated, Draco couldn’t help but be drawn to Harry’s aura, even though he was trying his damnedest to stay a bit away from him. As hard as Draco tried to build up his walls, his boyfriend always had an uncanny ability to see through him, even from the get-go of their relationship.
Here he was; in the middle of the night, kneeling on a dirty floor, and staring at Malfoy’s nude arse through a peephole like a bloody perv.
The Muggle Studies professor was over the moon about this development.
He could have sworn he heard Ron muttering under his breath to Hermione about oblivious wankers, but wasn’t sure, as Harry was still watching Malfoy out of the corner of his eye as he stirred the potion.
By the fifth time in a row of this, Harry swallowed heavily, opting to walk to the pool bar for a drink to cool off.
He watched as Potter’s eyes darkened at that, his tongue poking out to lick his lips, and Draco had to hold himself back from jumping him, literally.
“So what was it exactly you wanted to show me, Potter?”
His mind wouldn’t stop whirling with the sudden possibilities of who this could be.
Malfoy started on a long, drawn-out spiel about how lovely of a gentleman the man who he had been helping was. “Those legs of his are sculpted so perfectly. But I suppose they have to be, right, Roddy?”
Too many nights of Harry going home early from a workday and getting comfortable on the couch, his favorite take out on the table and a lager in his hand.
as he did, plugging in his headphones and tucking in to listen.
Brooding, Harry eyed Roddy for a few seconds and shrugged. “I’ll survive. Thanks for asking, though.”
Harry just laughed, feeling entirely at ease for the first time in a long while, even as Malfoy pummeled him with pillow after pillow.
Any time he could see his best mate smile, for whatever reason, it always managed to cheer Harry up out of whatever slump he found himself in.
Potter interrupted him, “Say my name,
Potter grunted once, then the words came back, and Draco swallowed dryly.
“You’re speaking that - that sodding snake language! That you spoke in second-year!” Draco remembered that day well, considering it was around the time he realized he liked boys instead of girls.
Harry shook his head, oblivious to Draco’s question, and finished off his beer with a swig. “Nah, it’s fine. Just trying to wrangle something out of you to know what to get you this Christmas is all.”
Harry nodded vigorously, face-down in the pillows, with his arse propped up once again, slightly swaying back and forth, and Draco chuckled under his breath, “Of course you are. You’re always ready for me, aren’t you.”
Draco reached up and grasped his hands to Potter’s flushed face, and kissed him deeply, their bodies flush together.
, in the nude…
“Oh? Is that so— ?” He couldn’t even get out the rest of his retort before Potter attacked his mouth with more enthusiasm than Draco can remember seeing the man direct towards anything else  in his life before. His lips were chapped, but he made up for it by sneaking his tongue inside his mouth, and Draco sucked in a breath as the kiss deepened quicker than he anticipated.
“You and your partner will work together to create the perfect Amortentia potion. Once complete, you will turn it in, and it will prove to be half of your N.E.W.T. score.”
— whatever this is.
To his frustration and relief, Malfoy walked over with the same sex toy from the other day. The one that practically called to him when it rolled over to Malfoy the first day he came over to Harry’s room.
Especially since Malfoy has been going for a good few minutes before Harry even grabbed his prick, the wanker.
is that it then?” Harry scoffed deprecatingly. “Is that why you invited me to your dormitory? You wanted some quality time with me and how I smell?”
Hermione had mentioned to him that this particular resort is the only one located on the entire beach, making it very desirable to everyone.
Potter blinked once but didn’t respond. He almost looked like a lost crup.
“Hmmm…” Luna blinked and nodded once, her eyes hazy with thoughts Harry was glad he wasn’t privy to. “Well, whatever you say, Harry.”
Draco looked his boyfriend’s way with a look of desperation, and Justin, the poor sod, just nodded, giving his consent for it to happen.
As if Draco could read his mind, there was an instantaneous, hot, wet tongue prodding at his furled entrance, and Harry squeaked aloud.
Except for this time the gaze was filled with less cruel intentions and more curiosity.
Harry then clenched tightly around Draco’s cock inside him, and he could imagine him groaning in the back of his throat like he always does when he’s too tight. He deserves it, at the very least.
He shook his head and reached out to grab at Draco’s arm, who jumped from the contact, and Harry immediately pulled his hand back. “Erm, sorry. Just - I know you don’t want to erm, kiss me. Just feel like we should just bite the bullet, so to speak, and -”
They then went down memory lane of fourth year and laughed at how terrible of a dancer Harry had been, but in that exact moment, he couldn’t care less as he recognized the song that just started to play.
He chanced a glance at Draco; and found him staring back, unblinkingly. Then he opened his mouth.
Harry unwillingly would then stash his phone away, feeling the warmth of it through the pocket of his robe, his hands itching to grab it again and hide under the table to check for any new messages.
Harry mewled softly into Draco’s neck, his hips becoming erratic against his like his own voice was turning him on almost as much as it was Draco.
Stretching his arms up, he breathed in the salty air and turned back towards the dry sand, heading up to where a bar was located, about 100 feet off the water.
His heart was pounding in his chest, but Harry clenched his fists to hide how hard he was shaking as he leaned his face down, right above the potion, the fumes hitting him all at once like he remembered.
A few seconds too late, he moved his other hand over his mouth to stifle any more pleasing sounds as his view was still firmly on Malfoy’s form in the peephole.
Perhaps that was why he closed up anytime conversations veered into the territory of their pasts. A small part of Draco was deathly afraid that bringing up old demons buried deep between the two of them could ruin things for good.
the song! My da’ loves it, says it got ‘im, and my mum together.”
But he relented, figuring maybe Typhon would be there and see him.
“What did you just say?”
Finally, he shook his head and chuckled under his breath. “Only Malfoy…” he muttered, as he turned back around and reached for the conditioners next, picking out one that smelled softly of lemons.
Having Harry’s pleasure, only to him, was such a treasure, and Draco never let Harry down, always giving him what he needed. Harry may think Draco was ‘in charge,’ but Draco knew better than that.
There was a loud whooshing sound and a tinkling of glass. Lots of glass. Harry shot up from the rug to take in his living room. The tree was upright with all its decorations repaired and back on its branches. The broken Chinese vases, the cracked portraits and figurines from the mantelpiece – all that had previously resisted all Reparo Charms was now fixed and in their rightful places. Harry couldn't believe his eyes but even Aunt Walburga's portrait had returned and hung - SILENTLY - on the wall.
“What is it with everyone suddenly fancying you anyway?” She huffed. “You don’t have that much going for you. You still wear those old ruddy glasses, are clearly oblivious to anything going on, and have hardly grown much muscle from the past decade! What is there to be so obsessed about?!”
Damn his tight trousers.
Hermione would be having a field day if she knew.
“Potter? Potter!”
Harry looked down at his lap; he blamed the heat from the fireplace for feeling so hot all of a sudden, “Yeah, I think I have.”
The first time Harry met Justin, he knew the man wasn’t his cup of tea.
“Erm, what exactly are you planning on doing?”
Couples, in general, just make him feel a tad sick. Nauseous. Especially this time of the year.
charm. It was just now midnight, not as late as he originally thought.
And the drinks kept coming, mainly thanks to Seamus, who was apparently on a mission to get them just as pissed tonight as he had been last night.
have freckles, Potter. You take that back at once.”
“Hmmm,” Harry sighed blissfully and snuggled closer into the tight hold, “That must’ve been what Hermione was talking about, magical outbursts and all of that…”
“I don’t know. The only problem with that is, well, I wasn’t brought up around Muggle music. I wouldn’t know where to begin.”
Harry sank into the water to his shoulders, observing the other man. “You must not know me well at all then.”
Harry felt as if someone had petrified him right there and then, as he watched Malfoy’s now lace-covered arse as Malfoy reached down to pick up the robe, before folding it very neatly on the same bench as before.
“Does the Ministry
His cheeks were deliciously pink as he bit his bottom lip, his hips thrusting back and forth through his loose fist, water catching on his cock beautifully as it traveled down his length to his balls.
He must have decided to start masturbating in the few seconds that it took Harry to look away and then back again into the peephole.
Harry only raised an eyebrow in response.
Harry couldn’t hold back his inelegant snort. “Mind running that one by me again?”
Harry sang to Malfoy earnestly, smiling shakily as he walked one step closer to him, surprised his legs hadn’t entirely given out on him yet.
He wouldn’t even be surprised if some of them tried to send him some virtual Amortentia as well.
The anger and frustration left him in a rush, and he relaxed further into his chair, feeling morose and rather lonely all of a sudden.
_____________________________
Draco must have taken his stumble as approval to continue, as he could most certainly hear the proceedings from the other side of the Floo, and ran his devilish hands further up his legs, rubbing right under his arse.
He figured it would be for the best, so he wouldn’t have to shuffle back to the common rooms with a stiffy like he had the previous night. He practically had to waddle around like a bloody penguin.
Harry turned and saw it was Iain and wanted to laugh.
“Fuck, you beg so beautifully. Listen to yourself.” Malfoy pushed all the way inside, licking a stripe up his neck at that before biting down; Harry begged again only louder.
Eventually, Harry did make it out of bed and down to the shin-dig after a few more minutes of moping, thanks to Ginny’s incessant yelling at him through the door to put some pants on and join the party. He decided on a plain long-sleeved black shirt and some dark blue trousers.
“Because I wanted my hands on you. I have wanted my hands on you for so long but after last Christmas...I needed to feel you again.”
Ever.
And ready for the day to be over, so he could chase down his same spot from the night before.
“Yes, considering you’ve met all the Weasley’s.” Draco retorted back, causing Harry to laugh even louder at that.
He could still
Harry must have seen something in his expression, though, as he trudged up closer to where Draco stepped away. “Hey, look at me. Please?”
Draco had been coming with Pansy to this club almost every Saturday for the past four years since the War. And not once has he seen Potter wandering this particular venue.
“Yeah, but,” Harry swallowed and took a deep breath in before continuing. He knew this was the moment, a moment that needed to happen between them. And whatever happened from it, well, at least he can finally tell Ron and Pansy that he tried.
Potter smiled at him.
Draco just huffed and rolled his eyes at the display before going back to his readings on the proper way to brew Alihotsy Draught when he heard it.
“Cheers, mates.”
“I’m not a fool Draco, I know we both have our fair share of issues. Past and present.” Harry’s side of his mouth upturned at that, “But I have never forgiven myself for cursing you that night.”
“Alright then, Potter. I’m sure whatever your point is will be mind-blowing.” The blond smirked at him and seemed to relax a little at that, nodding his head for Harry to continue.
As Harry felt one of Draco’s hands reach up and caress his arm, he wanted nothing more than to make the most of this short moment and reached with his other hand to grab at Draco’s long sleeve, pulling him a tad bit closer, when real life came back with a metaphorical punch to his face.
Hiding a smirk, he grasped his wand from his holster and cleaned them both with a quick wave of his wand.
pretty well.” Harry didn’t mean for the statement to come out as petulantly as it did, but there was no taking it back now.
Draco blinked again, coming to the realization and a devilish smirk appeared on his still satisfied face. “Is that all it takes for you? A cock fucking your throat?”
He figured there had to be other things to do besides lounge by the beach and get as drunk as the fishes, but for some reason, something kept pulling at him to go down to the sand.
His legs working once more, Harry sat up and rubbed at his knees, his legs still shaking from his otherworldly orgasm Draco wrung from him.
need to earn its respect. There is no point in me giving Kreacher the orders. It needs to come from you if you want these attacks on your attempts at
“Isn’t he a Seer anyway? Can’t those types see the future and all that bollocks? He should know you two are
He muttered a quick spell, and Harry let out a shaky breath as he felt lube running down his legs, suddenly much more relaxed than before as well. “Relax Potter, you need this badly, don’t you?”
Draco looked up from where he counted the snowflakes on the ground and into those vivid green eyes. For the first time, he could finally see the love and trust he always wanted to give to the man echoed right back to himself, and he wouldn’t have been able to stop the smile from creeping up his face if he tried.
“No, never apologize.
Harry cleared his throat, “So - erm….I was wondering if you, uh- ever played around with that music-”
Harry smiled over at her, but he knew it was no use. Once Luna made up her mind about something, there was no convincing her otherwise.
“Language, mate,” Ron chides, nodding in the direction of Teddy and Rose, who are sitting with Luna stripping twigs off long spindly branches to make good toasting sticks.
“Wait,” Harry says, as the older elf gets to his feet and moves to leave. “What does the engagement have to do with their fights?”
Over the years, Draco, Ron, and Hermione have often commiserated about how much work it is to keep primary-aged children occupied when they’re not at school over the holidays. Draco’s very proud of himself for never once saying “that’s what house-elves are for,” and really, seeing the happy, confident little boy that Teddy’s become, he wouldn’t trade his upbringing for the kind of stiff formal life he’d lived at the Manor anyway. But every time half-term rolls around, he’s freshly reminded just how exhausting it is.
Black, wrought-iron gates close in front of him, sealing off a lush, dark-looking garden surrounded by high brick walls. The wrought iron has the Malfoy family crest mounted in enamel and on either side a set of elaborate iron skulls. Harry would be amused by this melodramatic touch, but instead he just feels uneasy. The place feels … off. There’s something wrong here — something dangerous and ugly.
Both Harry and Ron glance back and forth between the two of them in confusion, as Malfoy and Hermione seem to have a silent conversation with one another.
Draco was determined to get through the morning without crying, but now he’s not so sure he’s going to make it.
to enjoy yourself for a minute too,” he teases, reaching out for Harry, as if he’s going to draw him into a hug, or something more. Harry smacks his hand away abruptly. Draco’s expression falls.
Parkinson seems unfazed. “Right then, you might as well come too,” she says to the pair of Aurors. “Let’s get all the cards on the table at once.
Bulstrode rolls her eyes. “No, of course not. But it does seem like everyone is a bloody sight better off with him gone, doesn’t it?”
“I think I’ll let them be by themselves,” Harry replies. “I know they think of me as family, but this seems… different. Private. I’ll visit Molly once we know more about Ginny’s situation.”
to break some bad news.” She looks him up and down, and her panic is replaced with confusion. “What’s going on? Why are you here?”
“I’m going to miss you,” he says, as he pulls alongside her, reaching across the space between their brooms for a hug—something that would have been unthinkable to him only a couple of months ago.
you. I thought maybe that was something we shared.”
“Well, no one was more affected than they would have been after a few wines. The chef was very good. He’s from Oregon, in America, where it’s been decriminalised. The early dishes were much stronger, so that the effects started to set in toward the end of the meal. It was a very cerebral experience, Harry. You would have enjoyed it.”
The Catapults’ owner—Greathill, Harry thinks his name is—starts to sputter in outrage. “This is ridiculous. The rules of Quidditch have remained unchanged—”
Harry thinks about how terrifying it must have been, to be all alone.
“Right. Of course. Now that Ron’s okay, we need to get out of here. Nev’s right.”
Something flickers across Malfoy’s expression for just a moment, some split-second of recognition or acknowledgement, but then it’s gone, his stare cold again.
Hannah keeps calling to her, a constant stream of encouragement. “You can do this, Luna. Remember, just like Hermione did.
“Thank you,” Harry sighs, offloading his purchases onto the long kitchen table.
Harry feels a wave of discomfort at that. He refuses to glance at Malfoy.
Luna, as is often the case, doesn’t even appear to be listening. He feels bad for dragging her all this way, when the most the team is likely to suffer is a mild sprain, but she seems to be genuinely enjoying the trip.
“He’s a licensed permit holder, Harry. He qualified in France, and had his registration transferred here to Britain a month before he arrived. Whatever ingredients he has here, he’s legally entitled to hold.”
“I know you think we were being a bit hard on him before,” she says. “If Luna does wind up marrying him, of course we’ll … make it work.”
done about it. Other than putting up with the fact that Harry seems determined to be around more than ever. Going with Teddy to Quidditch games and leaving grocery lists pinned to the pantry at Grimmauld Place. And apparently, taking on a full-time job in Hogsmeade. Neville is ecstatic when Harry agrees to accept the role running the integration school. The pair of them gather a small group of witches and wizards who agree to have their children be part of the foundation class. All that’s left is for Draco and Minerva to find the Muggle-born children to join them.
Harry watches emotions flicker over Draco’s face as his mother speaks — pity, frustration, love. He appears about to say something himself, struggling for words, when the quiet of the room is suddenly interrupted by a charmed sound from somewhere to Harry’s right.
“You can’t break into someone’s car!” Harry hisses.
Finally, Draco slowly pressed into the man, wanting to savor this moment since he was sure it would be the only time he could ever touch Potter like this. He bit the inside of his cheek, the feeling of Potter’s tightness overwhelming, better than he imagined it could ever be.
“Hmm...we’ll see about that.” Harry laughed, dragging him even closer, steadfastly ignoring the hooping and hollering from the group of Gryffindors from the other table.
“Potter. Don’t be a prat.”
Zacharias made his loud return back to the table, complaining about the lack of hygiene in the bathroom, which Harry found hilarious with how he had just been scarfing down three-day-old cheese fries and getting it everywhere in the process.
. Harry mulled the different possible meanings in his head, his eyes closed, lying on his bed one morning before breakfast, listening intently.
Malfoy moaned aloud, “Oh...oh fuck-”
Eagerly, Harry leaned ever closer to the hole to peek through to see and solve the mystery.
“You should have seen him on his fourth day here. Bloody travesty - ugly red splotches all over. Couldn’t handle the sun. Poor love had to have me rub Aloe Vera all over him.”
No, Draco has decided to let things be and play out on their own time: not causing any trouble with anyone this year and getting through his Eighth Year as quickly and painlessly as he could.
“It’s called Parseltongue.” Potter licked the shell of his ear before continuing,
He immediately set into action, grabbing at his most private collection of toys that he had brought with him, throwing them back into his luggage, and desperately praying to the gods and Merlin that Malfoy hadn’t been paying attention.
“Are you ready?” Draco asked, already knowing the answer.
“Color?”
“We really should get that mistletoe up soon, especially before everyone gets here tomorrow.”
Even the portraits didn’t seem to mind his sleuthing around; he did manage to keep his Lumos pretty low just in case he woke up some of the old sleeping sods.
“Sorry...sorry I shouldn’t have lost control like that, I just don’t want you to think that way, blame yourself for
Harry wasn't sure if the so-called 'category' Roddy was talking about was for him or Malfoy but he wasn't about to find out anytime soon. He opened his mouth to fire back when he heard Malfoy sniggering beside him and he turned to him instead, brows furrowed in frustration."
Saturday, Draco wakes to an owl from Teddy asking if they can go flying. It’s certainly a gorgeous day for it. Clear and crisp, with Muggle planes leaving contrails across the blue sky far overhead.
“Why on earth would you want something like that? And from
“Bollocks,” he says firmly. “We knew the wards protecting the grounds were strong. That’s why we’re going under them.”
Ron seems philosophical. “Up to you, isn’t it mate? You haven’t let anything hold you back these last few years. You don’t need to let Malfoy goad you into anything you don’t want to do.”
“Let’s go to Grimmauld,” he says quickly. “I haven’t opened the door for today, and I don’t want the calendar to backslide.”
Harry scowls, toeing at the gravel of the driveway and trying not to give Zabini the satisfaction of reacting.
“No,” says Draco quietly. “I didn’t.”
Malfoy’s mouth opens and closes, as if he’s about to say something cutting and then decides better of it.
The silence stretches between them for a moment too long, and Malfoy’s good humour vanishes.
Draco nods, smiling. “We have a lot to discuss.”
They make their way along the crowded street, Harry tugging Draco close with a hand in the crook of his arm.
Then a very unexpected thing happens. Draco laughs. A gentle, genuine sound that Harry’s not sure he’s ever heard before and very much wants to hear again.
There’s another little pop, and more of a hiss this time, and the entire beautiful stag above them sputters into darkness.
here.”
Harry picks up the packet of photos again. The top one is a picture of him and Malfoy, their backs against the stone balustrade of a bridge overlooking a river. They’re smiling at whoever they asked to take the photo, and the wind has whipped Malfoy’s hair to one side. Harry stares at it, wishing it was a wizarding picture and he could see them move. See their smiles. See Malfoy tuck his hair back in frustration. He feels like he’s getting a glimpse into another life, one he’s staggered to find he wants very much.
Draco pulls the velvet bag from his pocket in triumph.
The only contact he’s had from Draco himself in the months since he left was an invoice sent from his accountant for his work on the rings. Harry, clearly suffering a rush of blood to the head, thought he’d be amusing and sent the payment back with a note saying “You forgot our first
Still, Harry bends over him, checking for a pulse. His skin is already quite cold.
“Draco hasn’t been out,” she answers, picking her quill up again and continuing to write.
Harry backs away from the now largely-naked spruce, eyeing it with suspicion, but he only gets a few feet before there’s another unbelievably loud crash behind him. The decorations falling from this second tree seem to be made of some sort of delicate porcelain and shatter in absolutely all directions.
“No one is asking either of
“I need you both. Half of those daft old bastards only listened to me today because you were standing at my side and they’re forced to respect you. I need you for your name, your dedication, and the way you will get up in front of the press and vouch for the new League.”
“You have an alarm in the shape of a Snitch.”
He stumbles to the changing room, at a loss as to what he’s going to do or say.
Draco looks around. They’re in a field with houses nearby. A small rural village. He racks his brains. This isn’t where Potter grew up — he knows that much from the endless tell-alls in the press.
careful.”
“He’s—”
Ron gives an exaggerated nod, as if this is something he’s said himself more than once, and helps her stack her notes and slide them into her satchel.
He meets Elsa at Tom’s Restaurant, their standby diner, for cheap sandwiches and egg creams.
“I’m not arguing with you,” Ron says. “Malfoy is a complete prick, and if it were up to me, we’d never see his smarmy Death Eater face again, but—”
Neville is holding a charmed icepack to his forehead. “Catildeweed would work for that,” he muses. “It’s a sort of universal anti-psychotic. But I didn’t pack any.”
“It’s a risk worth taking —”
Luna moves around the room greeting everyone warmly. Malfoy takes up a spot beside Zabini at the bar, and when Harry glances around again, he is clinking his glass against Zabini’s in greeting with a grim expression, looking for all the world like someone who has had their death sentence handed down or is being sent off to war.
They look at each other, a little disheartened. Somehow Harry imagined that there would be a miraculous restoration. That there’d be light and fresh air and the sound of children’s voices ringing through the halls. The reality seems more confusing.
It’s a hold notice from the library at the London School of Economics, letting Draco Malfoy - Student ID number 9437894 - know that his copy of
Zabini gives a negligent shrug. “I’m glad he’s dead. Feel free to write that down in your little notebook. He was a terrible man, and he made Draco’s life impossible. We’re all better off.”
He expects Draco to be a bit pissed off that Ron and the kids are joining them, but he seems too focussed on his Omnioculars, saying not much more than a passing greeting and then concentrating fully on the game.
Harry’s delighted. “Of course, of course. Any time! When are you thinking?”
Ron looks at Cassie for reassurance, but she just shrugs. “Nothing about this case has been by the book, Ron. I’m not sure why you’d start to worry about that now.”
"See you tomorrow, Harry!" he hears Neville call behind him, but he doesn't risk pausing.
“Then I’m not Malfoy’s alibi,” Harry shrugs, aiming for nonchalant but falling a little short.
“I’m not going to teach players to fly upside down and fling hexes at one another,” he protests mulishly. “You may have bound me to coach for a season, but all you’ll be getting out of me is a team that’s good at traditional Quidditch with strong broomwork.”
“You scared us there. Thank Merlin for Hannah.”
Harry takes both their plates to the sink and casts a spell to set them washing. He’s using magic more often, Draco’s noticed. For small things.
“I can’t see how—” says Ron, but Draco motions for him to be quiet.
It doesn’t even make any sense that she’s here at all, really. They last parted company on poor terms. He’s had enough disagreements with her over the years to know she’s not here to get him to treat her. And she’s on her own, so she’s not here to arrest him.
He’s almost closed the front door when he hears her call from the foot of the stairs.
. I couldn’t understand why he was so furious. I just loved the way the scales changed colours. My mother bought it for me and I had to keep it hidden up here.”
He knows exactly the sort of person the goblins will have hired. Some number-cruncher who understands as much about Quidditch as a Muggle and cares even less. Someone who started wearing shiny suits straight after the war and was one of the first to get a mobile phone, as if by enthusiastically adopting all things non-wizarding they could pretend the whole conflict had never happened.
now, apparently — see him in his underwear, but still.
Ron claps both Harry and Draco on the back. “Glad it’s not me yet,” he shrugs sympathetically. “I’ll buy you both pints on Friday.” And then he takes Rose’s hand and Apparates away.
“Yes, Mr
Harry frowns at him. “We can go tomorrow.”
“Where are you?” he calls out as he steps through their Floo.
“Could you charm these for me?” Harry asks without turning around. “I’m rubbish at ironing.”
Harry’s train of thought gets derailed. Hermione’s right, of course. They only trusted Theo because he was assigned to them by the Ministry. Malfoy’s primary motivation has always been his own self-interest. And right now, his self-interest lines up squarely with what they’re here to achieve. Harry doesn’t need to make friends with him. He doesn’t even really need to be polite, so long as Malfoy does what he’s told.
“Let’s both of us make the most of it then, shall we?”
Neville smooths his sweater and takes a deep breath before sitting down. “Well, this is a horrible bit of business, isn’t it?”
. He lets Draco hurry him out of the Room before he bends double in the corridor, retching and coughing.

“So what happens now?”
She’s sitting up in bed, her hair tied back and colour returned to her face. The change is remarkable, and Harry feels like a weight comes off his shoulders at the sight.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” he asks, sadly. “I might have been able to do something.”
“We did it,” Harry says, leaning a little closer to press his arm against Draco’s, feeling the warmth of him through their shirtsleeves.
“I don’t think I ever saw anyone in as much pain,” he says, “as Ginny, tonight.”
“Well, at least we know which of them was the top,” Blaise winks.
Eventually, when the food is gone, the plates put away to wash themselves, and the kids tucked up in their room, Harry runs out of reasons not to talk about it.
“Draco and I will be fine. We’re both grown ups.”
“Well, this magic is prohibited. Highly illegal. For obvious reasons. Mass memory modification is bad enough, but the suggestibility component makes this a capital offence. And it’s very old. I’ve been studying and practicing wizarding law for a decade now. Nothing like this has been attempted in hundreds of years.”
Teddy hovers about three feet off the ground and flies briskly away. Draco puts his sunglasses on against the glare of the day.
“What is it?” Hermione asks.
“Why won’t your mother tell them what happened?” he asks, ignoring Malfoy’s question.
“It wasn’t a

of them is a little strange.
It feels like being back at Grimmauld Place all over again. Hannah finds and shrinks a chalkboard on wheels in an empty classroom and is able to resize it inside the common room. Luna writes out the elements of the ritual in her neat, flowing handwriting, and Draco and Hermione immediately set to dismantling it, covering the board in coloured chalk arrows, crossing outs, smudged erasings, and cramped notes with new suggestions.
“Every avenue of inquiry that leads to you getting to throw Draco in a cell,” Parkinson bites out.
“Want another?” Maybe-Parkinson asks, waving a wine bottle over Malfoy’s empty glass.
“Of course I’m not fucking jealous,” Harry snaps back. “But I won’t let you drag Luna down to your—”
Harry frowns. “Meaning?”

“I don’t remember a chicken playing a big role in the Christmas story,” Harry muses.
“I’m not lurking,” he protests. “I’m just
“Thank you. For speaking up yesterday.”
“You should call him Harry, Draco. It’s weird to use his last name. Okay, now that creep’s gone, let me show you how fast I am,” Teddy calls over his shoulder, shooting away again on his broom.
“I couldn’t have people just turning up here anymore,” he says apologetically. “So I moved the memorial sign to the graveyard.”
“Did you get one of these?” she demands, flapping a similar card at him, and Harry nods, getting up to let her come through. Neither she nor Ron knows anything about Harry’s tendency to fall into bed with Malfoy, and he’s certainly not about to tell her now. There’s no way she’d understand. Merlin knows, Harry doesn’t really understand it himself.

The team look a little startled by Harry’s apparent change of heart, exchanging curious looks with one another.
“Right, this is it. Last chance to go over everything and ask any questions.”
Malfoy gives a curt nod and gathers his jacket, stuffing his arms back into the sleeves.
“What other ones can we do?”
Teddy’s face lights up, and Harry loses himself in the rhythmic action of rolling out the rounds of dough, chattering to the little boy about his job.
“The Puddlemere semi, of course,” Draco says slowly.
do things that are more complex, things we’ve learned more recently. Harry’s Auror spells; Draco’s fire.”
Harry shakes his head. “No. Now we wait.”
“I’ll be back in a minute,” he says, straightening his jacket and thinking about what he needs to say. “I just need to see Robards.”
Suddenly it’s just him and Draco in this oddly empty waiting room, the noise of the hospital receding around them.
“Draco was sure that if Maxwell
Ron pushes a folder across the desk toward Harry, who reaches for it, feeling conflicted. Perhaps none of them should be investigating this, but he wants to help his friend, who looks pretty lost.

His neighbours could feed Cassie, he reasons. It’s only going to take him a day or two at most to Portkey back to London and sort this out. And Elsa won’t miss him. They’re doing lesson planning at the moment, mostly, and the next intake doesn’t start until March. He

is a remarkably charitable way to describe it.
Harry blinks a little at the flash of several cameras. He never gives interviews after Arrows games, and he supposes it’s a while since the press has been interested in capturing him out and about in public. He’d forgotten how uncomfortable this makes him feel and tugs awkwardly at his collar.

queer. And very sweet. And much more well-read than I’d given him credit for.
“They’re Muggle crackers,” Luna explains sagely, handing Harry a paper cup of something that might be mulled wine. “They have jokes and funny little toys inside.”
It’s preposterous. He needs a second opinion. Luna’s always been a bit daffy, she’s clearly made some sort of mistake. Some trace of Potter’s diagnostics is tainting the results of his own tests.

that?” Hannah breathes, sitting down on the floor and taking a water bottle out of her pack.
Draco hitches a breath. How very different both he and Harry would have been with an education like this.
Granger gets up from the window seat and comes and crouches beside Draco’s side of the bed. He feels like he should sit up, but everything hurts and he’s honestly not sure he’s strong enough.
“Goodness me, the Chosen One, all grown up, and in touch with his feelings.”
“I was referring to matters larger than your stomach, Harry.” Draco rolls his eyes with a smile. “I’m afraid it’s much too early for food, but if you go down to the Blue Room, the elves will probably have coffee out. You could bring me one back.”
“What are you doing?” she asks.
The water is as unsettling and dark as it was the day before, and the feeling of the Gillyweed just as awful. The wetsuits help, though, and as they paddle around each other to get into position, Harry feels the familiar surge of adrenaline he always got on an Auror raid: waiting in the dark, holding position, getting ready to move. That was always the part he liked best. Free to do what he was good at, without all the politics and the paperwork.
Masterson looks apoplectic, turning on his heel and stomping out of the room with a speed Harry hadn’t thought the little man capable of.
Better to know now, he thinks. Better to find out right away if this is something he can get his hopes up about. Before he gets used to the idea of Draco in his boxer shorts and Harry’s robe, sipping coffee at his kitchen table.
"He's keeping you safe,” Harry says around a mouthful of apple. Draco is no less appalled by the way he eats now than he was fifteen years ago. “I can tell you, it's a lot less exciting diving from that height when you've fallen off your broom!"
Or rather, the spaces where the windows should be.
Harry marvels at the way she’s able to say that, as if

“You fixed them? Their rings?”
They each duck under the low beam and into the dark space, steeling themselves for the sound of the door to click behind them.
He tells Nigel and Thomas all about it over their next brunch. It’s usually a standing monthly engagement, and Harry feels guilty about having been away for so long. Nigel reassures him with a playful swat on the arm that he has nothing to worry about unless he met someone cute without telling them. Turning away before Nigel sees his face, Harry decides it’s the perfect time to set the table.
“Yes.”
Later, he convinces Draco to at least join him for coffee, trying to explain as they descend the stairs that breakfast is likely to be an unwelcome surprise. Turns out, Harry’s the one in for a surprise. The kitchen table is set properly for two. Kreacher hums contentedly at the stove cooking eggs, and in front of them is a platter of perfectly crisp bacon and pile of golden, buttered toast. Draco quirks an eyebrow at Harry as he sits, helping himself to the steaming pot of coffee.
Harry can’t really argue with that, and it’s not as if he has a true love to worry about, so he stuffs a couple of the raspberry-flavoured chocolate hearts into his mouth as he follows Luna into the front room. Neville is sitting on the couch cradling Hugo, slightly awkwardly for someone who has grown into an absolute tree-trunk of a man. The baby practically fits in one of his palms. “Good to see you, Harry,” he says, shrugging a little as if to indicate that he’d get up or offer a hand to shake if it wasn’t currently full of tiny Granger-Weasley.
Narcissa Malfoy shakes her head. “No. I refuse to say anything further without an advocate present, as is my right.”
Hermione seems pleased to see them both, setting Rose up with some parchment to write a story about her morning.
Malfoy finishes eating and lays his cutlery neatly on the plate. “Very well, and then we’ll face down the carolling horror.”
“We’re all very proud of you,” Molly says as she gets up to go to the kitchen, patting him on the shoulder as she passes. “Achieving everything you’ve ever wanted.”
“No, something you normally use while not plugged in, like a … mobile phone. Merlin I’ve clearly had too much wine. My mind feels positively sluggish.”
He steps through Ron and Hermione’s Floo, startling Hugo tottering towards a pile of blocks on the floor. The toddler sits down abruptly and starts to wail, so Harry scoops him up on his good hip, alternately making silly faces and soothing noises at him as he heads into the kitchen.
Malfoy flicks his wand and puts it back down on his desk. “Not cursed,” he concludes, picking up his pen and going back to his notes.
“This is a mess,” Harry sighs heavily, sitting wearily on the floor, leaving Hannah and Luna the small settee. Hermione takes Pince’s chair. Malfoy paces. “We can’t contact Ron to see if he’s okay. We don’t even have all our supplies.”
Harry tries to picture it and can’t. His interactions with Malfoy so far have been forced and brittle. The idea of Draco owling his heart out seems laughable.
vessel, unworthy of the time the Dark Lord spent within you.” Ginny whitens, her skin so pale every freckle stands out in sharp relief across her skin.
Bill nods and shakes his hand.
Bill probably thinks this is an olive branch. A way for Harry to ease himself back in by catching up with one of his oldest friends one-on-one. It only goes to show that he doesn’t really know Hermione at all. Although, to be fair, Harry supposes

Potter lingers, saying goodbye to the Quodpot player, while Draco gives some final instructions.
“You’re not the same person who took that Mark—terrified for your family, scared for your life.”
“No, he has a house. Grimmauld Place.”
“You’re saying I should have kept the Manor?”
“Anyway. There’s a calendar in my flat. And whoever’s doing all of this thought it would be dreadfully amusing to write
Prompt Ten:

“Anyway,” Malfoy says abruptly, standing up and picking an invisible piece of lint off his waistcoat, his cheeks pink as if he’s embarrassed. “That stick in a bucket is a disgrace.”
“Don’t.” Draco shakes his head, swallowing hard. “
"Don't get me wrong Harry, I think it's dead lovely, but why this sudden need to assist Draco Malfoy?"
“We say that there’s heightened security. Because of the election. And so we have to cast a brief trace on each person that arrives.”
Malfoy fixes Harry with a blank, even stare.
“Those aren’t trade-offs we should be making,” Harry snaps, yanking too hard on a canvas strap so that it cuts uncomfortably into his hand. “We should use the Portkey. I thought you of all people would be delighted to get out of here.”

There’s a rap at the window and Harry shoves it up in its aging frame to let in his owl. It’s a copy of the
“Like what?”
Harry looks over his shoulder, and then closes his eyes briefly as he tries to remember the scene accurately. “Smaller. The size of a shoebox.”
Harry realises he’s right, not least because finally he’s no longer here on his own.
Neville shrugs. “It didn’t make any sense to me when I heard you were running. You definitely had no interest in any of that before I left.”
“Miss Weasley?” Cassie asks, when Ginny still hasn’t moved her hands. “Could you show us your palms, please?”
They’re left with Hermione. “Why would you…” Ron trails off, as if he can’t think what he wants to ask Hermione.
Harry has no doubt that there’s an absolute litany running through Malfoy’s mind of all the ways in which Harry is failing the Ministry’s high standards, the Aurors’ dress code, and the basic decency of all professional people, but unbelievably Malfoy holds his tongue.
Harry doesn’t like the idea that Hogwarts might see them as a threat.
“You know that story, about the wizard who goes to the underworld to rescue his daughter? But he’s not allowed to look back, or he’ll lose her.”
Harry clutches at the chain around his neck, beginning to comprehend Fleamont’s meaning. All of the conversations he had with Draco about the rings and house magic, and he never made this connection. The cool touch of his mother’s ring feels just as comforting as the embrace of the building around him. He puts a hand against the stone of the mantle and casts the spell Draco taught him.
“This is a nightmare,” Nott groans. “It’s the last thing any of us needs.”
“He’s really talented,” Nev enthuses to Harry one evening, over pints.
“Um, the same I guess,” Harry says, and gets an eyeroll in return. Harry sits up a little straighter, trying to feel more like an Auror and less like his sixteen-year-old self with a crush.
Draco turns the novel over, studying it carefully.
“Even if it’s you.”
you.” Her voice is barely a whisper. “How could anyone so… wonderful… also be so very terribly wrong?”
Harry pushes the feeling of discomfort away. The whole thing is overstated anyway. Those who escaped imprisonment mostly fled the country. They’ve been living the high life, probably, completely unaffected. There’s no reason why they should be allowed to come back now. Kingsley’s had his day, is all. It’s time for someone with a clearer vision of the future to take the lead.
, I mean—helped me with it yesterday. It seems happy enough.”
Malfoy glances up with a start, giving Harry a long once-over.
“It’s amazing, Harry. You should be really proud.”
“Shall we?” she asks, looking back at their little group.
She eyes Harry, seated in the corner, and passes her wand to Cassie when asked without acknowledging her at all.
All of a sudden, the unicorn bursts through some shrubbery to Harry’s left, leaping over a small stream, and pausing. Harry’s pretty sure a spectral animal doesn’t need to rest, but the creature behaves so naturally, dipping its head and looking around, appearing to breathe heavily. Harry draws his wand but is too struck by how beautiful the mirage is to bother to do anything with it.
If the extremely intense way Draco kisses him straight into one last Apparition is anything to go by, he very much agrees.
“Malfoy, you must see how this looks. Your father dies. One of your kitchen elves has a rash from handling a known poison and won’t answer questions about it. And that elf shows me this place,” Harry gestures at the garden with an expression of disgust, “and then goes running to you when I ask him about it…”
He’s clearly been working far too hard. Once this election is behind him he’ll need to rediscover a social life, that’s for sure.

“We’re going to rebalance the ritual,” Harry says confidently, hoping that this is a thing that can in fact be done.
. Let’s begin.”
He lifts his wand. What’s the healing spell Pomfrey uses on the Quidditch sidelines? He tries to remember. He has to remember, he has to help Draco.
He stuffs the contents back into the boxes and stacks them back against the wall.
“You never struck me as an outdoorsman,” he says with an unkind smirk.
“Well, if you’re planning on reading her a bodice ripper, the selection is almost limitless. Based on the title alone, Highlands romance

has noticed, that’s pretty embarrassing. “Did Parkinson leak this nonsense?”
“You’ve done the cards,” Rose explains patiently, pointing to where Kreacher has chosen to leave the Christmas cards above the fireplace that had forced their way in the previous morning. “And I’ve done the decorations on the tree. But, you haven’t done the others. Day one was a wreath, Harry! That was a week ago!”
“If you’re so good at making spells, why not do it legitimately? Why all the secrecy? Nott has a job. Parkinson, Zabini.”
“Malfoy, I—”
be broken in some undefinable way, but at least now he knows that trying to date women definitely doesn’t help matters.
“But robins don’t have anything to do with Christmas for Muggles.”
“What would it mean?”
“Coffee,” Harry blurts quickly, before the invitation can be rescinded.
“It’s not Draco,” he says with conviction.
“Oh, give over,” Ron snorts. “You’re not as subtle as you think you are, you know. I mean, Hermione noticed first, obviously. But with the way you’re always muttering about his
Now that Harry’s not keeping his practicing with Leila to himself, he has her come to the club. They work together in the afternoons, once the team has moved inside to the gym. The days shorten with winter fast approaching, and increasingly by the time they finish, they’ve had to turn the stadium spotlights on to be able to even see each other from opposite ends of the pitch.
It should be exactly what he needs. The guy is hot; fit without being muscle-bound. Tall, and with a possessive hand on the back of Harry’s neck that telegraphs he can give Harry exactly what he’s chasing. A chance to forget. He leans in, his mouth pressed to Harry’s neck, and Harry desperately wants to lose himself in the sensation. But everything about it is wrong. The bar is wrong: too crowded, too hot, too loud. The guy is wrong: wrong hair colour, wrong height, wrong cologne. He thought he could scratch this itch the way he used to, but instead, he finds himself shaking his head apologetically and fighting his way back through the bar to the street, desperate for a lungful of air.
“Only a week to go,” she muses.
It’s a brilliant autumn day at Hogwarts, and the air is crisp and clear. The sort of day Draco always liked best, right at the start of the school year when everything felt full of potential and nothing had gone wrong yet.
paperwork and covering
Later, after the bad news has been delivered and Parkinson’s left to wherever hags curl up at night, Neville convinces Harry to come with him and Luna to the local pub. Harry’s almost afraid they’ll find some of their now-former colleagues there drowning their sorrows, but the little bar is mostly empty. His first pint barely touches the sides.
Outside the castle, a serious snowstorm is settling in. Even at midday, the sun stands little chance of penetrating the thick blanket of grey cloud, and the Great Hall is lit with a thousand charmed candles floating over the tables as if it were night. Harry stares up at the candles above the staff tables, bright red for the Christmas season, and absently wonders where the wax goes so that it doesn’t drip on all their heads.
“And even if we
The next day, that’s the only part of the dream Harry remembers.
Luna is wearing a short strand of tiny Christmas lights as a necklace and has holly leaves and berries poking out of her hair where it’s fastened up in a bun. She adds another couple of files to Magda’s stack, oblivious to the venomous glare fired in her direction.
So Blaise brought him an intricately carved wooden box, inlaid with a single ruby. “Greyback and co,” he muttered, as if that explained everything, showing Draco where the wood had been smashed and repaired. “It holds some jewellery that’s precious to my mother, but neither of us can open it anymore.”
“He did lie to cover for Parkinson’s whereabouts,” Cassie points out, and Harry expects Draco to get defensive about that, but he just nods and writes another little note beside Zabini’s name.
” Hannah yells over the noise as they all raise their wands.
surprise.”
Ron fairly jumps at that, shouldering his pack quickly. “We should go then. No need to hang around here.”
The back of his neck feels hot and he gets frustrated with himself. He stuffs a set of formal robes and his usual weekend clothes into the bag, hitting his boots and toiletries with a shrinking charm and zipping the whole thing closed with a huff. It’s not like he cares what Draco Malfoy thinks of his appearance.
“Can I look at the scene?” he asks them both. “Fresh pair of eyes, and all that.”
And Draco found that he hadn’t wanted to.
“Maybe Parkinson’s right,” Ron muses, poking at his knitting needles again, which stumble briefly and then right themselves. “A few changes might be good overall? Dean talks about those unsanctioned games all the time. Reckons they’re dead exciting. He’s made money off them too.”
Harry feels his face heat even more, this time with embarrassment rather than exertion. He’d known this wouldn’t stay a secret forever, but he’d naively hoped it would last a little longer.
“I believe, when you first told me about these rings, I called them
He feels for the edges of his own magic, lost in the torrent of power surrounding him. If he can just —
Brightly-coloured bunting hangs across the window frames and a giant
And sure enough, it’s a very grim sight that greets them both in the Arrows’ changing rooms the next day. The team look like spectres: pale and tired and very weak. Oliver Wood does an amazing job of trying to muster up an enthusiastic speech, but a few minutes into his retelling of the Spattergroit bout that hit the English team in 2001, Iyer wretches and makes another run for the door.
The door appears just as it had, and Harry exhales in relief when they let themselves in to find they’re in the right place. The fire is still burning happily in the grate, a feat of magic he has no way of understanding, and it casts warm shadows on the bare walls. He looks up at the Hogwarts crest above the stone mantel and hopes with all his might that they can achieve what they’ve come here to do.
Hermione shakes her head, flipping open a beige folder in the centre of her desk. “Belle Russell. Twenty two years old. Born in Surrey to magical parents, both of whom were killed in the war. No siblings.”
“He confessed!” Harry objects. He feels awkward being the only one still standing and drags over a wrought-iron chair to sit on. It scrapes loudly on the slate tile. Pansy scowls at him.
“Maybe you can get her to change her mind now,” Harry suggests. “You’re not a suspect anymore. There’s no need for her to continue this if it’s all a charade.”
Nothing. Not even the weak silvery wisps he’d managed when he first tried the spell. Ron stares at him in horror. They each try and fail, including Malfoy. Harry wonders absently who taught him the spell and when. Probably Malfoy’s happy memory involves something ridiculous, like unicorns attending his fifth birthday party. Harry can’t dwell on it though. Now they have a blocked exit and no communication with the outside world.
“You look very smart, lad,” Fleamont Potter says approvingly from above the mantle, as Teddy laces up his shiny new black shoes. “You’re a credit to the family.”
“You’ve never forgiven her. You don’t believe people can change.” And now it feels like they’re talking about something other than whether or not Pansy Parkinson is a liar. Harry glances down at the tightly fastened cuffs of Draco’s shirt sleeves and tries not to think about what they hide.
“Don’t tell me how to do my job, Harry,” Ron says, turning on him abruptly. “You gave up the right to do that when you left.”
Harry doesn’t really know what to say to that.
He has a fruitless argument with Kreacher about it, who snaps at him that if he wants things moved around he can hire a house elf to work during the week. “Kreacher is old and enjoying the peace and quiet now you’re on your own,” he says, disappearing back to Hogwarts with a pop.
“In spirit,” she says to appease him, patting at his arm distractedly while she straightens the map. Harry catches a slightly wounded expression flit across Ron’s features, but it’s gone before he can focus on it clearly.

The second half is even closer, with the Tornadoes beginning to adjust to the Arrows’ style, but having no answer for the rapid-fire hexes that keep catching them in their blindspots. When the final whistle blows, the Arrows have it, by a mere ten points.

“Come on then,” he says to Harry, tapping at his watch as if Harry hasn’t been waiting on
“Hermione?” Harry wishes he didn’t sound so questioning, but suddenly all the secrecy surrounding this trip is taking on a new and much more sinister meaning.
— for all these years.
“And extremely illegal,” Malfoy agrees.
“Who do I have to thank for taking pity on me about the calendar?”
Draco twitches his wand at a training mat, which slides obediently over to them.
“It’s been a decade, mate. You can’t tell me he’s the same git he was in school. None of us are.”
“Well, not really,” Luna disagrees mildly, but Harry can see she’s not happy with the whole situation. “It’s very upsetting that Draco is coming under this scrutiny. He didn’t kill his father.”
Harry shoves him gently with his free hand.
He takes a swig of the wine and opens the letter.
It takes Harry a second to catch up.
“Hermione, come on,” Harry calls over his shoulder. “We’ll try again.”
,” Parkinson curses, slapping a palm on the desk loudly. Her rage is the most emotion Harry’s ever seen her express, and it’s pretty intimidating. “Listen to the pair of you. If this restructuring fails, I will be fine. I will return to my very nice apartment in a brownstone on the Upper West Side. I will enjoy excellent Mexican food delivered to me any hour of any day. I will walk in Central Park on the weekends and attend the opening of Broadway shows and sleep with the extremely attractive pitcher for the Yankees who has been texting me for months. You on the other hand,” she points at Malfoy, “will be forced back to Europe and a life in grey areas, gambling with your winnings and your continued ability to play. And you,” she turns her beady eyes on Harry. “What exactly is it you think you will do? A man with no qualifications whose only career has literally left him behind?”
Nothing happens.
The Mariner is unusually crowded for a Thursday night, but Pansy and Blaise have managed to snag a table in a back corner near the fireplace.
Harry has no idea what to do with the odd reaction. Or rather
“He can live any life he damn pleases.”
Draco prefers to work from the inside out, strengthening himself rather than erecting a barrier between him and the danger. The spells draw heavily on his magical core and are extremely tiring, meaning he needs to take regular breaks. But he once had a ring literally implode in his hand and all that happened was a slight surface burn on his palm, so he’s confident this is the better approach.
Kreacher sniffs a little at the utilitarian pub glassware, but seems pleased that at least they now have enough. He’s somehow managed to extend the dining table in the formal room Harry never uses, and it looks positively regal, covered in crisp white linen embroidered with little ivy leaves.
“A winning team, apparently. Look—I’ve literally just come from an International Portkey. I’m tired. All I know is that she wants me to take a bunch of professional losers and teach them to play properly. She didn’t tell me you’d be in the mix.” He lets out a humourless chuckle. “But somehow that seems completely unsurprising.”
He spins around to find a short, sandy-haired workman in coveralls by the back of small truck.
That turns into a whole other thing, of course. The elves fuss about until they find a picnic basket and then — brooking no objections — fill it with thick cut slices of country-style bread, fresh churned butter, hard-boiled eggs, slices of crumbling Cheshire cheese, cool rounds of cucumber, and tiny sweet cherry tomatoes, freshly picked that day. There are two bottles of Butterbeer, and a thermos of piping hot coffee to round it off.
“That’ll be them now.”
Harry feels his face heat for no plausible reason and backs quickly out of the room, dashing up the stairs to his bathroom and stripping out of his damp exercise clothes. Under the water, he tips his face back and tries to calm his thoughts. His brain seems to be stuck in an endless loop of incredulity.
“And that’s why you’ve been coming to dinner. Because you want to help with the Trust? That’s the only reason?”
will.
“We’re ready,” Harry tries to reassure her. “We’ve gone over every contingency. We’ve planned for every terrible thing that might happen. Hermione, the Ministry trusts you to do this and with good reason. No one understands the castle better than you. And we’ll be right by your side. Ready to do exactly what we’re told.” He winks at her, trying to get her to smile. And the edges of her mouth do soften a little. But she’s still wound tight, and Harry expects she will remain that way right up until they succeed.
She seems stumped by the question.
“I didn’t know that,” Malfoy murmurs. His voice sounds strained, probably from a long night of casting.
“I’ll need to take a look to confirm, of course. But I’m happy to take the job on. I estimate it will take about six weeks, at my usual rate.” Awkwardness with Potter be damned. This job is spectacular, and there’s no way he’s going to turn it down.
“Oh good, you too,” Malfoy snaps at Harry as he enters the room.
Ron just shakes his head and sinks back against the pillows.
She’s still crying, but he sees her lean forward and pat the ground around her, looking for her wand.
“I thought I’d make chips for when Teddy gets here. Homemade are nicer than the frozen kind.”
She doesn’t mean anything by it, but the comment still makes Harry wince. Luna is a talented Healer and so curious about the way the body works. She’s an invaluable part of the squad—he’s acutely aware she could be earning much more working for almost any other team, and very grateful for her loyalty to the Arrows.
Harry scowls at her.
to find the hotel only because these windy little streets all look a bit the same, and also because he’s not sure what colour door the hotel has, because who even looks at the outside of your hotel door as you’re leaving in the morning? Was he supposed to have done that? No one told him he should—
Draco leads them back to the library, and Harry takes a moment to feel warm and slightly uncomfortable at how at home he seems in Harry’s house. As if it’s an everyday sort of occurrence that they have their friends over for toast and eggs and a spot of light research. He busies himself cleaning up the kitchen, and wonders where the hell Kreacher has gotten to.
“I went to one of the dinners a few weeks back,” he mumbles. “And then I met Jack. He’s the builder who’s restoring Draco’s place. He’s been teaching me how to do things.”
And Hermione’s never quite been able to grasp that that’s
“No point,” Harry shrugs, straightening up. “I’ll be gone in a couple of weeks. They can write whatever they like.”
“You’re sure you don’t want to marry her?” Harry asks.
“Well, no...but —”
Harry laughs. “No, of course not.”
“Well? Am I wrong? He ran away to America after school, and as far as I can see, he has never stopped running. He doesn’t own a house, a car, or even a fucking pair of socks. He hasn’t held down a job or a relationship, with friends
“Jim Cranswick buys the cheapest season ticket we have for sale every year!”
Harry opens his mouth to protest, but receives a sharp poke in the ribs from his partner.
The other players are already resetting themselves in position, but Wood continues to glare at Malfoy.
“Malfoy?!”
He takes Dreamless Sleep when he gets back to his hotel room, and refuses to feel bad about it.
But then he looks at the Arctic Monkeys t-shirt again, fitting perfectly across Malfoy’s broad chest. His morose expression. There’s nothing about him that seems pleased to have unsettled Harry or glad that his scheme is succeeding.
Harry’s mouth drops open in horror. “At
It’s such a small step, but he feels much lighter on his feet as he heads back to the Leaky.
Flying with Potter again takes Draco right back to when they were young. He has a power and a recklessness on a broom that Draco has never been able to imitate, even without a child clutching the handle in front of him. It’s as if the broom is an extension of Potter, who throws himself around the sky like he owns it. Teddy squeals and laughs as they dodge and feint, whipping past each other. They race each other up, then plummet alongside one another on the way down. It’s exhilarating.
dangerous for both the players and the crowd. An almighty cheer goes up when a hex goes wide, catching a spectator in the hand and causing him to drop his drink. But he looks excited, waving his briefly-injured hand wildly and hollering, as if he’d just caught a tennis ball off a serve at Wimbledon.
, not this again.”
“Not exactly, Harry, no. Our nanny has spattergroit, which neither of the children have had yet. And I am not one of these witches that subscribes to that awful pureblood tradition of encouraging them to catch it. Merlin, did you know Parvati had a
The elf looks stricken, as if she’s done something terrible by admitting to mere exhaustion. Holber gives her shoulder a pat.
“Sorry, work,” Harry hastens to explain, shooing the Patronus away and dashing up the stairs to join her.
“To Kings Cross?” he asks softly. Harry’s never talked about it. Draco’s never asked.
“Harry,” she whispers, awed. “It’s beautiful.”
!” he yells, and he feels the breeze start up on the back of his neck. Hermione tries to make a break for it, so he catches her around the waist, holding her struggling form against his chest and hoping like hell this works.
“’Course, mate.”
Ron thanks Neville for his help. Harry says he’ll come with him and leaves Ron and Cassie to wrap up their day together.
The Medi-Auror report is in the standard format Harry’s seen countless times before. He scans the results of the diagnostic spells. Just as they’d determined in their initial examination, they’ve concluded formally that no traces of magic have been detected. The cause of death is listed as “asphyxiation”.
Luna nods. “I think we might still have a party, though, when all this sadness is behind us. It would be a shame to waste all those lovely plans.”
“Where’s mine?” he yelps in Kreacher’s general direction, as the rebellious elf vanishes into the pantry and refuses to answer.
“You can’t use a calendar that’s almost a decade old!”
Harry takes a seat on an overstuffed sofa, and Holber sits down opposite him.
It makes his temples throb.
Harry’s eyes prickle a little and he blinks them rapidly. Luna seems not to notice.
“A fucking graveyard,” Potter seethes, breath making a cloud in front of him. “We’ve been through enough without…” He falls silent again, but his foot kicks out in frustration, sending a pebble clattering across the alley. Anger rolls off him in waves, and Draco isn’t sure if he’s even aware of the magical energy that pulses from him like a physical presence. He’s not really sure Potter’s even aware of Draco beside him.
to try, shouldn’t I,” he asks rhetorically.
It’s not much of a kiss, not much more than a peck, but it steals all of Harry’s breath away anyway. He looks into Malfoy’s eyes, so impossibly close, and Malfoy seems just as taken aback. Harry reaches up slowly, sliding one hand into his hair, and kisses him again, properly.
,” the Trainee hisses in a whisper.
Certainly the conversation with Theodore Nott seems to support that theory. He’s just as uncooperative and brusque as Bulstrode had been, venturing absolutely nothing other than direct answers to increasingly specific questions.
Luna looks at him enigmatically, her head tilted to one side. “We all want the chance to be better, Harry.”
Hermione looks at Ron, who gives a nod, even though he seems as confused about what they’re doing here as Harry feels.
Harry nods. His neck feels tight and there’s the beginnings of a headache starting that feels increasingly familiar. He’ll talk to Chen another day.
“The witch in Shropshire?” Padma calls after him, confused.
“Figures of eight, then, off you go.”
, you’re not shackled to the past. You found a way to live.”
Narcissa turns to Ron and Cassie. “I confess. I am the one who took my husband’s life.”
Draco watches as he bends to scoop up a copy of the
“Are you drunk?”
“There you two are,” Robards announces, giving off a cloud of firewhisky fumes as he claps Harry on the back. Draco seems to get impossibly paler.
“Borrowed from…?”
Harry sucks in a breath, head snapping around to look at the others. Hermione is similarly wide-eyed, her wand shaking. Unlike ghosts, these visions of the founders are in vivid colour, magic fairly pouring off them in all directions. Salazar Slytherin’s white beard spills down over his bright green robes. Helga Hufflepuff’s hair falls in rich auburn ringlets on the shoulders of her yellow dress. Behind Harry, wearing a ruby-encrusted scabbard and kind smile, is Godric Gryffindor.
was founded,” Luna corrects. “I was just reading about this in Rowena’s diary.”
“Actually, they used to call their mailmen ‘redbreasts’ ‘cause of their jackets. And they bring all the Christmas letters and parcels. It’s a metaphor.”
. You owe me, Harry.”
They’ll do this. It will work.
A muted repeat of the toast follows around the table, and Harry takes a solid slug of his wine. It tastes sour on his tongue.
Hermione looks up from her desk, and arches one sharp eyebrow. “Excuse me?”
“There’s no way this works.”
Confarreatio
Luna looks more concerned than frightened, but her wand is out.
“I don’t know. That’s why I’m—”
“It isn’t too late, you know,” Draco continues gently. “McGonagall would chew off a limb to have you teach at Hogwarts, I’m sure. If you’re not enjoying being an Auror.”
“I’m not—” but then his eye catches on something over Neville’s shoulder and his heart stops.
So he eats breakfast: a poached egg balanced on half a grapefruit for some unfathomable reason. And then he wraps his Christmas presents, which requires more Spellotape than should be strictly necessary and leaves even the ones in plain square boxes looking like misshapen lumps. Finally he throws open the doors to his wardrobe and actually
“Did you really not know?” That’s what Hermione asked.
Which is infuriating to Harry because Pansy Parkinson’s made his life a living hell, but this was her idea and if it’s a success they should say so. And also Allsop can get bent.
Hermione’s knee knocks against Draco’s.
They choose to go home.
“But while the Keystone Cops here were sorting this out, they discovered that Potter had seen me in the East Wing that night.”
Harry would almost be able to enjoy the looks of horrified shock on the owners’ faces, but he suspects his own expression mirrors theirs.
It’s both a fair point and a terrible reminder that no one has been here since those final fateful days. Harry thinks about McGonagall ordering the Slytherins to the dungeons. How terrified some of the younger children must have been. He shakes his head and gets to his feet. It’s as good a plan as any. Not that he’s going to tell Malfoy that.
“Bloody waste of time,” Ron mutters, tossing down his pen. “They’re all going to be like this, you know. They hated him, you can see that, but they’re not going to give us an ounce of help just on principle.”
There are only two explanations and neither of them make any sense: that Harry can somehow have seen him in this suit or that Draco himself is now contributing to the fabric of these dreams.
“Something wrong?”
Draco is up, wrapped in his robe and sitting by the French doors. He looks amused at the scene, Harry entering, the little elf bearing a majestic breakfast before him.
The old elf makes absolutely no effort to hurry, trailing into the room dragging a washing basket behind him. He looks extremely irritated to find Harry has guests.
“I've played Quidditch for over twenty years and that's the best half-time pep talk I've ever had.” Wood laughs sarcastically, picking up his broom and rolling his eyes at them both as he leaves.
“You’ll work it out, you know,” she says, reassuringly. “The prickliest ones are the most worth it. Just ask Luna.”
. The diagnostic threads are ragged and frayed, and Bill was right. The pulsing teal-coloured feedback looks similar to the results of a consanguinal curse, the worst kind of dark blood magic.
Harry laughs, and agrees. “We’ll keep the press conference very short, I promise.”
They all crowd around, laughing and hugging and patting Ron on the back. Harry’s so grateful to see him that he doesn’t even realise Draco’s hung back a step until he reaches behind for him with his hand, interlocking their fingers again.
This morning, Harry feels positively overflowing with Christmas spirit. Grimmauld Place is practically glowing: laden with decorations and ready to welcome the family the following day. He’s even pretty sure he hears Kreacher whistling, but he stops long before Harry gets to the kitchen.
rings, Harry. They have incredible power. They’re tied to your ancestral magic, and to your family home.”
He’s leaning against the wall, arms crossed. Harry’s unreasonably annoyed that he never seems to stand on his own two feet like a normal person. He’s always propping himself up against doorways and leaning over guardrails, and draping his long legs over the arms of chairs.
Ron nods, his bluster from a few minutes ago leaving him in the face of a clearly grieving widow.
She looks glum for a second, and then resolute, vanishing the inedible mess.
Harry, on the other hand—the most action his bedroom has seen recently is Kreacher deciding all his bed linen should be changed out for festive sheets bearing giant snowflakes and reindeer. Harry’s suspicious. The sheets look a lot less like Black family heirloom linen and a lot more like something he saw in the Winter Wonderland window display at John Lewis.
Hermione seems surprised but returns to her armchair, notebook on her lap. “Do you want to go over your parts of the spells again?”
He hears slightly heated conversation muffled through the heavy wooden doors, but after a few minutes Cambie reappears with a much older elf at her side.
Ron looks like he might be about to try again, but Cassie puts a cautioning hand on his shoulder, and he comes back to himself.
“You need to take the cap off, moron,” Pete sighs, reaching for him. Carl goes to bat his hand away and Robert’s about to intervene, but before he can even think, there’s a sudden
Instead, Draco seems just as exhausted as he is. Jittery in a way that speaks of the same lack of sleep. The same tightly-wound anxiety that claws up inside at inopportune moments and threatens to lash out of him, a magical incarnation of his own monstrous failure. Draco doesn’t seem inclined to convince Harry of anything, really.
Harry feels exhausted. Draco sending back the rings has exposed a raw nerve, and every part of Harry feels abraded and sore. The last thing he needs is his senile grandfather giving him grief.
“Not one, but two
He thinks again about mentioning Parkinson, but decides that will only make things worse in the current circumstances.
“Are you sure of that?” Harry asks, thinking about Malfoy outside in the garden, about his absolute certainty that his father hadn’t been poisoned. “Lucius’ death has certainly made the problems with the entail vanish for good.”
“Put your hand out, Harry,” Alicia instructs, and he does as she asks.  She dangles the angel over his upturned palm, and whispers an incantation at the same time. Nothing happens for a second, and Harry’s about to make a joke, when all of a sudden the metal wings of the angel fall clean off.
this would be it.
Neville manages a rock-cutting spell he used renovating the garden at Grimmauld Place a few years back, and cuts some footholds into the wall. But no sooner than he manages to haul himself up out of the water, the rock crumbles away, dumping him unceremoniously back with a splash.
But the Arrows are running out of steam, tired and sick, and suddenly facing the full onslaught of the Harpies defence firing hexes and flying interference. And the clock is running out, Harry realises with a start, glancing up to see only three minutes left.
“Oh, well, Malfoy ancestral rules are complicated, and pretty old-fashioned,” Luna says with a shrug that Harry knows will wind Hermione up. She hates when anyone skips over the details. Sure enough—
Draco nods.
. The whiskey burns at his throat.
to play, if I wanted to.”
Malfoy clearly doesn’t feel the same way.
“I can hear you,” he replies. “Is your mother okay?”
of more. And Harry had missed that completely. He'd spent two years shagging this man and never taken the time to see who he really was, or to reflect deeply, or think at all, about what sex with Draco Malfoy might mean to anyone other than himself. And Harry knows why. Because he had never wanted to think about what it meant to him.
“The thing about breaking curses, Auror Potter, is that it is often delicate work. You’d do well to perhaps not careen into people’s workspaces like the clodhopper you are, unless you’d like to add an ancient Roman fertility curse to your list of woes?”
Harry unwraps Victoire’s decoration and hangs the brightly-painted uneven clay letter from one of the branches.
“Have you seen her? The woman who came in with me?”
“My lad was supposed to be here at nine, but I swear that boy hasn’t been on time in his life. I just need to get these joists inside.”
There’s a blast of cold air as she leaves the café and the door swings closed behind her. Harry remains sitting for a second, but his mind is still racing. Hermione will need to go in for the morning briefing, collect Gibbens, and then Apparate to the Manor.
