“I thought I’d surprise you,” Hermione says, her voice warming like it does when she feels vulnerable and seen at the same time.
“I don’t understand,” Harry says, his mind spinning, his hands clenched in fists. “You want me to choose whether I lose my father, or I lose you?”
“Eighth Years, thank you for returning to Hogwarts after so recent a tragedy. I know how difficult this must be, when we have all lost someone dear to us within these walls. When I look amongst you, I cannot help but see where others should be, who are now lost to us.”
She knew then that Draco and Harry had crashed and burned, finally, a collision of light and dark, day and night, pale cheeks and ink black curls, just like she knew they would.
Draco cursed to himself silently, and looked pointedly at the floor. He was not going to wander off alone in search of
He jumps onto the Third Floor landing with his lungs burning, but he doesn’t pause, instead sprinting down the hall and around the corner to where Draco was just minutes ago. He raises his wand and casts a brighter Lumos, looking around.
Hermione watches younger Harry curiously. “Do you know of a potion,” Harry says lightly, “called the Sad Nightingale?”
They quietly make their way through the castle, much like they did that one night, except everything is entirely different now. The weight in Harry’s hand is solid and warm, but so unlike any other hand he’s held. Ginny’s and Hermione’s were more delicate, smaller, almost softer. Even Ron’s hand was different, plump and relaxed and large, always warm and usually a little bit sweaty.
Earlier this morning, after a night no less passionate than others, Harry had woken up beside Draco who was sitting up, back flush against the headboard.
Draco doesn’t know why Harry feels any boredom, what with being the Chosen One. And if he knew everything in store for him...well, Draco guesses Harry would wish for his boredom back. But maybe not. Draco doesn’t know him that well, clearly.
“Well thank Merlin I’m a wizard.” Malfoy gazed at him under lowered eyelids. “Suppose I might’ve been better off a muggle.” Malfoy eyes his cigarette thoughtfully.
Draco holds his breath, then releases it when the door closes behind him. He reaches out his hand but it falls through empty air.
With a shuddering breath Pansy lifts her hips up to meet Blaise’s warm, tender mouth, sparks of pleasure lighting up like matches, like silent fireworks that ripple inside, hot and fiery and wild. As her arms splay out beside her, gripping the sheets with an uncontrollable strength, her shoulder blades digging into the mattress, and Blaise’s fingers moving in an intoxicating, steady rhythm that matches the beat of her heart, Pansy knows she is absolutely fucked.
Draco likes to walk in Muggle neighborhoods, browse local bookstores and flower shops and cafes, smile and wave at the ever so ordinary people that walk past. He likes the fact that no one knows him here. That no one hates him here before he can speak a single word.
Draco looks away to hide the tears that well up in his eyes. He looks at the clock above the couch, and gasps.
There’s not many, but it will have to do. She makes a note to investigate the matter later in her Pensieve.
“Wait!” Ron hurries after them, leaving a startled and hurt Lavender without the least bit of remorse.
“I won’t try to change your mind,” Hermione says, “but it’s clear that both of you want to be together again, to try and heal from the past. So what happened?”
Draco grins, clearly relieved to be changing the subject. He wraps an arm around Pansy, an uncharacteristically affectionate gesture, probably one he picked up from Harry. “Unfortunately, those subjects are not taught at Hogwarts, though I’m sure if you tried hard enough Snape would raise your grade by a letter.”
him, Harry.” Ginny takes Harry’s hand in hers. It’s weight is comfortable and yet heavy, like the shape of prison bars that are so familiar that gripping them is as grounding as it is burdensome. “The war has changed everyone. You know that more than anyone.”
A small cauldron is whisked onto a hook that protrudes over the furnace. Lucy drops in a sprinkle of what smells like lavender, stirring clockwise. Harry hoists himself up onto the edge of the counter.
They’d brought Cyril, of course, and since then Helena the Xbox and Gaston the laptop had been added to their collection. Above the fireplace hung wizarding photographs – Crabbe and Goyle and Rahim on the day he became theirs; Ron and Pansy grinning at each other on their wedding day; Harry, Ron and Hermione from a day at the Burrow as kids; Narcissa and Lucius laughing at a party when they were young; Lily and James spinning around a courtyard; one completely still one of Shacklebolt from a newspaper clipping that was technically a wizarding photo, but that never moved at all and Malfoy found hilarious.
“Hey,” said Malfoy, suddenly gentle and in his ear. “I’m right here. I’m all right. We’re both all right.”
Malfoy slammed the trunk closed and locked it with a spell. He held the trunk handle with one hand and picked up the salt shaker with the other.
“Why, would you rather we go for a run and avoid any unmanly conversation about feelings?” Malfoy asked, but his heart wasn’t in it either.
Draco felt his shoulders raise against the barrage of questions at his back as though he could fend them off. He took a breath, then leaned heavily against the bell.
He and Malfoy both woke up in the Auror’s makeshift camp in Scotland near where the kidnappers were suspected to be. Harry woke on a cold cot with Malfoy groggily coming to on the second cot in the burlap tent. Turns out the man had planned to let Harry take him back to their headquarters “Which is why we work as a team, Mr Potter,” Shacklebolt had reminded him.
Harry stiffened. “I’ve already told you that you don’t get a say in my private life,” he growled as politely as he could.
Malfoy quickly crossed the small distance in the tent and put his hands in Harry’s hair as though to pet it in a soothing way. Instead his hand got stuck in the tangles and he looked down at Harry in betrayal as though Malfoy didn’t know perfectly well what Harry’s hair was like.
It didn’t matter. Not a lot mattered, actually. Voldemort was gone, nurseries could be put in other rooms, the world could have kept passing Harry by…
The dining table sat all their friends, and the bedroom didn’t have a single flower. Harry loved their place almost as much as he loved Malfoy.
Harry held his breath, poking at his meal as though he was still eating and this was the most off hand conversation he'd ever had.  Not important.  It was of no consequence one way or the other if he actually bought Malfoy Manor...
Draco smiled a bit, just a bit, and nodded his head.  “I do appreciate that.  I want you to know that if it was the Ministry's money and I was asking for more I would understand you needing to know what it's for.”
Harry stayed quiet for a few moments, listening to the clink of his friend's silverware against the plates as he thought.  Then, as casually as he could, he raised his head to look at Hermione.   "Maybe I'll buy it."
Draco was chuckling by the time Harry paused in his rambling, nudging the other boy again.  "Not too bitter, are you."
He leaned over and opened the desk drawer that was full of the letters he'd written to Harry but never sent.  He raised his eyes to the other man's, tipping his head towards the drawer.  "These letters.  The one that got to you accidentally wasn't the first.  I've been writing you letters since just after the war."
Harry didn't think twice, he pushed the door open and dragged Draco inside, slamming it behind them so it would disappear from view to the outside world.
Draco thought Kreacher might keel over and die from sheer joy at that moment.  He had to work hard not to laugh as he watched the tiny House Elf try and drag BOTH full bags towards the basement door, despite them weighing at least twice what he did.
Time passed un-noticed to Draco as he was lost in memory and eventually his head lolled against the back of the couch as he dropped into sleep.  Full dark came, chasing every last scrap of light out of the apartment, but he was comfortable there and not even noise from the street through the open window roused him.
"Just be careful."  Harry turned onto his side, facing Draco and smiling at him.  "So Show-Stopper tomorrow.  What is it you're doing..?"
"They wouldn't let me sit in the living room with them to watch the news.  If I laid in the garden outside the window I could hear the tv.  I was listening to hear if anything weird had happened that might be attributed to Voldemort."
It was on the tip of his tongue to say yes, not wanting to admit that he had, actually, forgotten.  But he didn't want to lie to Harry, not about this or anything really.  So he shook his head a bit, smiling slightly.  "No...  I remember the general idea.  I remember how badly I wanted to send it to you.  It drove me nuts wanting to make sure you got it, I just never found the courage.  Why?"
“He can't be that far then...  I haven't a clue where we are here but if you found him and got a reply back already, he must be close..”
"I got a letter from the Ministry a few months ago saying they were looking into his case again."  Narcissa looked down then, looking at her hands folded in her lap.  "It explained that given how Voldemort had been using you as a pawn, and had basically set up within our home in such a way that we could not say no without being killed, they were reviewing Lucius' case.  They felt his actions might have been in defence, not because he truly wanted to act as he did."
"I'll get an owl as quickly as I can."  Harry said with a nod.  "And I'll find out how to safeguard the letter to your mother."
Draco shifted, getting to his feet.  He reached out and touched the door handle, then pulled his hand back again.  "Why?"
He turned the folded parchment over and picked up his quill again, sketching out their own made up version of the Slytherin crest for good measure.  He wasn't sure Theodore would recognize his handwriting now, but if his memories were the same, he might remember the crest and would be more willing to open the letter.
Harry smiled a bit and shrugged his shoulders, something about his eyes a little darker than normal.  "I feel oddly disconnected like this.  I wish I could be more involved again."
"Some of it wouldn't matter much or be proof to Voldemort.  But if you can remember a few things to tell him... if you have SAFE opportunity to tell him.."  Harry leaned his head in a bit, taking the end of Draco's school tie and giving it a small tug for emphasis.  "Tell him that Dumbledore showed me the Gaunt house.  That I know his mother wore Salazar Slytherin's locket.  That the ring with the black stone, with the Peverell coat of arms engraved on it, was once on Marvolo's hand, but now it's sitting in Dumbledore's office."  Harry paused for a moment, letting out a soft breath before continuing even more quietly.  "And tell him that in a box in his wardrobe he had a harmonica, a silver thimble, and a red yo-yo."
“Do you think that's what he still wants me to do?”  Draco said, looking up at Harry now he was more composed.  “I suppose he didn't say not to.”
"That's true..." Draco nodded, then got to his feet.  "Let's take another look through the house and see if there's anything else that needs my help."
“Come off it, Potter.” Draco said quietly, darkly and rather dangerously. His lips close enough to Harry’s that they almost caught together as he spoke. “You know what happens if you fight it.”
“From a mile away with most people.  Like someone closing a book in slow motion, you have time to step away and out of their mind before they shut it.  But you just... One second I could see that the next I was jolted back here.”
"I'll be right back, calm down."  Harry said.  "Honestly, what do you expect of me?  That I'd immobilize you, maybe break your nose then leave you to whatever came next?"
"Professor Snape...  I need to speak with you."  Harry said, working to keep the grudging and hateful tone out of his voice.
“Well it is perfectly safe in here, but you don't have to be in imminent danger to have a panic attack.  It could come from something we were talking about.  You giving up your wand or Neville or the war..”
Draco folded his arms again, glaring at the other man.  Harry, to his credit, looked slightly taken aback rather than angry at being spoken to in such a way.
“No.”  Draco said the one word reflexively.  He didn't need to think about it, really, his brain always leapt to that for him.
It was a risk, and he knew it.  But if it didn't work he could try something else.  And if that didn't work.. Well Harry and the Ministry were no worse off than they currently were if that was what happened.
Harry did think for a moment, he wanted to make sure he made the right decision.  It was far easier to make fast choices when it was for himself, but making a decision for someone else who was in danger was much harder.  Eventually, he nodded his head, meeting Dumbledore's eyes again.
"Finally we'll have someone decent to teach us Defence Against the Dark Arts."  Malfoy said while Crabbe and Goyle grunted their agreement.  "Not that Umbridge was bad, exactly but..."
Draco's hands curled in the thick black strands of Harry's hair, one leg instinctively curling around his hips as Harry's hands slid over his back, feeling him out and making him shiver hard, his skin prickling to the point of aching as everything in him seemed to come alive.
Draco hesitated, raising his eyes to meet Harry’s, looking into them for a long few moments, searching them rather deeply before he reached to take out the wand he was currently using.  He raised it and Harry could see a slight shake in his hand that steadied after a moment before he flicked his wrist and all but whispered
A few hours later he was getting ready for bed when he heard an owl tapping against the glass of his bedroom.  He let it in and took the letter from it, sitting down on the edge of his bed to read it.
He didn't want Harry to know any of that conversation.  And the more he thought about it, the more poured back that he'd spoken to Neville about and shared with him.  Things he never wanted to own up to to anyone that had just come tumbling out of him.
"Oh I hope that rumour starts circulating wildly...  Honestly, I'll flirt my pants off with an old lady.  But I can only be so polite towards actual 'eligible' girls."
“I don't see the point in informing other people when it happens, but yes, I did.” Draco tried not to look angry, but he was.  He truly did not understand why everyone felt the need to share his issues freely.  They were not part of this whole security thing.  They were his, they had been his for years.  They had nothing to do with Harry or Neville or anyone else.
"What nefarious deed is Draco supposedly up to now?"  Snape asked in a lazy tone and a slight smirk, making it clear that he was quite aware of Harry's probing and demands that Draco be investigated before he found him in Myrtle's bathroom.
Harry is having trouble getting to the Room of Requirement so he and Draco meet outside.  Draco has talked to Snape, they need to do some planning, things are getting more complicated.  There has to be a way out of this and Harry won't stop until he finds it.
Harry shook his head, smiling up at Draco.  "Nah.  I don't really buy much in terms of clothing.  I wear whatever I have until Mrs Weasley starts commenting on how bad everything fits me, then I get new things.  All the Gryffindor stuff and Quidditch themed stuff she's made though.  Your mom doesn't make you anything?"
Draco shook his head, letting it rest back against the couch.  “So was that it?  He just made you feel bad about yourself and sent you on your way?”
Snape grit his teeth, his lips working slightly as though he was holding back biting remarks.  When he did speak, it was a carefully neutral measure.  "You're helping Draco Malfoy."
Once Harry had sat at the Slytherin table for breakfast, and had just begun winning over the people around him when Snape unceremoniously ordered him back to Gryffindor.  Which was a bummer, it had been fun having Harry sit next to him.
"Draco I swear to every god there is and some that don't even exist that if you don't open this door I will break it down."
“Last night.  You threw the Dark Lord's family back in his face trying to defend me.  You didn't need to do that, especially to HIM...”
“Whoa...”  He turned on the spot to look around him, only stopping when he realized Draco had stopped as well and was fidgeting worriedly next to him.  “Sorry.. It's just never ever looked like this for me.  Why is this what you need from it?”
Harry felt realization hit him as Draco spoke,  understanding what the other boy was trying to say.  "Oh my god...  You might be right..."
Draco roused from his own thoughts, looked from the owl over at Harry and then shook his head.  “Not a word since you handed me the owl, Potter.”  He smirked, then raised one shoulder at the immensely disgusted look Harry gave him.  “Just being honest.”
But after a startling revelation about who one of the Aurors is, and a very awkward conversation, Draco finds himself in the one position he never EVER wanted to be in.
--Along with Inktober, it is Fictober! Following a prompt list from Tumblr I'm going to write short fics based around those prompts. A friend doing the same is titling each fic with the prompt so I'm totally copying that. ;)
Harry laughed, shaking his head.  "No no...  Sorry.  Alright so..  I have a bit of a confession..."  He raked his teeth over his lower lip, holding the balled socks in both hands.  "When I went into Borgin's after you left to find out what it is you wanted from there, Borgin sold me something.  Something he claimed was what you REALLY should have been asking about to help you.  It was a ring and I took it and I wore it all summer...  But somewhere along the way I lost it.  I didn't even realize it was gone until after we... had our last conversation."  Harry raised both eyebrows rather meaningfully as he spoke just in case Draco had somehow forgotten what their last conversation was.
"Did he give you a time limit?"  Harry eventually asked quietly, his fingers tightening around Draco's almost protectively.  A bones deep reflex that he didn't even know existed in him, but now surged through him possessively and powerfully.
“I'm sorry...  Electronics?”  Harry's brow furrowed as he watched Draco, his look clearly seeming to say he didn't know what to make of ANY of this.
When Draco's disappearance filtered to Harry, he caused more than one scene over it.  In Diagon Alley, at the Ministry, in front of his best friends...
Harry's voice broke the silence and Draco thumped his head back against the door, his eyes actually pricking a bit as he chewed harder against his lower lip.
"No kidding."  Harry said, reaching for a handful of carrot sticks.  "I was going to write back and explain but I figured it didn't really matter.  I couldn't undo the article being printed, and even if it was an accident, it still happened."
"I think it sounds delightful."  Prue said with a smile and a wink to Draco.  "Certainly ambitious as a signature bake.  I can't wait to see what you do, Draco."
This was the final notice he'd ever get.  This notice named Harry as Lord Proper of Malfoy Manor.  Owner.  Recognized and accepted by the house.
“Sorry!!  Sorry sorry...  Merlin, I'm really not doing well, am I.”  Neville laughed awkwardly, rubbing a hand against the back of his neck.  “Alright just... Bear with me.  Before I came to your protection team permanently, I was helping some of the others settle in.  Most of them DID use their wands for everything, so I just assumed...”  Neville shook his head, sighing and smiling a little more sheepishly.  “I shouldn't assume.  I'll teach you about the cooking things, but you'll need to come over here.”
“They're nice enough.  But most of them are a lot busier than this.  We wanted to scatter people around as much as possible which meant beggars couldn't be choosers when it came to location.  This was definitely the nicest.”
"Sure."  Harry said, lightly touching his fingers to the back of Draco's hip.  "Everything, every part of my life, is just lining me up to fight Voldemort once and for all.  Every year the fight has just gotten bigger and bigger.  I've been called everything from "The Boy Who Lived" to "The Boy Who Lies" to a hero, to an attention seeker to..." He gestured towards Draco's mirror where 'The Chosen One?'  flashed at him.  "I can't even start to count the number of times I've wanted to just grab my broom and fly away."
Draco’s body responded instantly, a rush of heat tearing through his core as though Potter had internalized the fiendfyre that day instead. When Potter’s mouth opened, Draco thought Potter’s tongue might burn him.
Obviously it was insanity to want something with Draco Malfoy, childhood bully, and Slytherin pest. That’s why Harry’d hid it from his friends. Insanity.
Slowly Harry’s tension unfurled, and he allowed himself to go loose in Malfoy’s arms. They stood that way for quite a while. The medic hadn’t returned.
Draco nodded. He took Potter’s offered hand and stepped into the house, away from the press and the past, away from the excuses.
“Go back, Potter,” Draco told him, raising his voice over the rain. “You deserve today,” he said, sure about that if nothing else.
Apparently there was enough of Harry’s hair to comb through after all, because Malfoy’s fingers were moving at the base of Harry’s neck. “It’s okay now,” Malfoy said.
“Well, that might be news to Potter,” Malfoy said, shooting Harry a stern look, “but I do happen to remember that.”
,” Harry protested, biting out the words. The restaurant was busy enough so that his words didn’t carry, but he was still a little horrified that he’d had to say them at all.
Harry sent his cot crashing into the back of the tent, which had clearly been reinforced by magic. The cot crumpled like the cheap tin it was with a satisfying sound. Shacklebolt had just left, and the medic who’d just been coming through the flap to check on them beat a hasty retreat.
Harry closed his mouth over Draco’s. Draco’s fists gripped the front of his robes and pulled him maddeningly close. Harry pushed Draco’s lips apart with his tongue, and willed Draco to make that sound again.
“No,” said Draco, taking another breath. Just this once. Just this once don’t be a coward. “I came here to tell you that I want to be anyway.”
Malfoy had whipped the mud out of the girl’s hands, and put it near his face. “Num, num, num,” he said happily. “Some of your best work yet, Victoire! Let’s see if you can make it just as good gluten-free.”
“See you around, Malfoy,” Harry said, but Draco had already turned away, so Harry’s final glimpse before he apparated was of blue robes trailing away.
“Why are you calling me that again?” Harry snapped. “Isn’t having my dick in your mouth enough to warrant a first name?”
Ron leaned back on his chair. “Yeah, if you add it against your four loses last month, you might be a knut or two ahead.”
“They don’t like being set free,” Draco continued. “And besides, where would it go? Should I offer it a living wage instead? Room and board in exchange for housework? Four weeks vacation? This isn’t the Ministry.”
Harry came around the desk and jumped up to sit where Draco’s book had been a minute ago. “Yeah,” he said casually, “I want to know if this has meant anything to you.”
Malfoy leaned in, tilting his head up to meet Harry. There wasn’t time for hesitation, but that’s exactly what they did. Their lips brushed over each others’ like they weren’t sure how to proceed. It was slow and chaste and agonizing. Harry slipped off the bed until he was on his knees with Malfoy, both clutching each other and forgetting how to kiss at all.
“Maybe I like torturing you,” Harry murmured before he could stop himself. Draco was right. He needed to stop wavering.
Draco had only gone to the Hogwarts reunion for the Lost Class – those who weren’t able to graduate because of the war – because his mother insisted enough time had passed for the Malfoys to begin making their way into society again. Obviously Lucius would remain at home, but Draco reluctantly took his mother’s arm and allowed her to apparate them to Hogsmeade.
Shacklebolt cleared his throat. “Unfortunately you’re my best Aurors,” he said, composing himself. “And I’m under pressure to separate you. It’s above my head. With your arrest records and awards, the Minister wants you to train others. Not new recruits like the disaster with your last trainee,” he added, “but seasoned Aurors who can still use professional development.”
the job like he did before. Before he and Malfoy had entwined their lives so fully, the weekends had dragged on for so long, but for the last few years, Harry and Malfoy had actually spent their days off away from the office. They’d even done two weeks in Japan a few years back, seeing the sights and exploring Tokyo’s wizarding district without a case looming over them. Harry could see them working with a different Auror force in the future, maybe Ireland’s, which had been trying to recruit them both for a while, but if they quit today, Harry didn’t think they’d have trouble filling a few months with each other.
Draco’s rejection seemed to bring Harry back to his senses. It’s not like they were going to fuck again this morning when Harry was trying to say goodbye. But Draco didn’t want a goodbye.
“Bite me,” Harry said, or tried to. Malfoy’s hand covered his mouth very quickly, and it came out unintelligible.
Ron looked incredulous. “Well, I’m not going to yell at you, if that’s what you’re waiting for,” he said.
But still, now that Harry could spend the night – and the night after that – without thinking twice, it became more real somehow. When Draco planted a kiss on Harry’s shoulder before rolling over to sleep, Harry didn’t need to tell himself this was just a mistake. When Harry tasted Draco’s trembling lips as he begged for it, Harry didn’t need to remind himself it was just temporary.
Potter. He just thought about the Potter he thought he knew, who was probably actually pretty far off from the actual person.
“And I thought you hated me,” Harry returned, working his way through the buttons on Draco’s shirt. He grinned. “Things change.”
The water had begun to run in the other room. Harry did consider letting himself out. He couldn’t stand another quiet breakfast in the conservatory where he and Draco tried to pretend there wasn’t a Death Eater dining with his wife in the other room. Saying nothing of the fact a house elf had made it for them.
bed. Never thought he’d see his own horror at their separation reflected identically on Malfoy’s face. Despite the assignment, Harry was still so desperately glad to have what he did.
Harry leaned back in his chair, relaxed now that there were no tiny humans about. “I didn’t need classes to know how to fight,” he said.
“And you mustn’t forget to water the plants, Potter,” Malfoy was saying. “I know they’re spelled to get water themselves, but I find they need a little extra care, don’t you? Especially Sierra, she’s not meant for this horrible English climate.”
There were photos of Harry and Malfoy as well: Harry scowling and blushing as Malfoy exuberantly kissed his cheek; Harry throwing back his head laughing and Malfoy looking pleased with himself; one picture that Blaise Zabini himself had actually snapped through a window once – he had an eye for beauty, he’d explained in the unexpected letter with accompanying photo neither of them had known he’d been taking – it was at a Muggle coffee shop. Malfoy had been adding sugar to his coffee as Harry leaned against the milk and sugar stand next to him. Harry remembered the day. It had been early in their relationship. They’d been chatting but not really looking at each other until Malfoy finished and looked up from his coffee. He’d smiled at Harry, and Harry had been caught offguard by the expression on Malfoy’s face – startled and content and
Denmark had been years in the past, but Draco was so surprised Potter knew that that he failed to say anything else for a moment.
Eventually Seamus and Neville got the hint and left for the pub early with Ron promising to meet them there.
“It’s because you only paid attention to the part in Auror’s training where they taught us how to fight,” Malfoy had said to him. “I’m sure the mandatory classes on human interaction were beneath you. Twerp,” he added affectionately.
The first time it had just been drinks and a vague idea of moving past childhood grudges in light of everything the Malfoys had done in the war. Well, in light of Narcissa Malfoy, but Draco had at least … vaguely tried to hide Harry’s identity from Death Eaters. It counted. Harry was ready to move past it all.
He stumbled through the halls, familiar and foreign at the same time, pushing forward to an exit as fast as he could. He stumbled out into the courtyard and into the chilly August rain.
He was soaked almost instantly, and chilled to the bone, but the downpour stopped his near-panic attack, and he heaved breaths of air, leaning against the stone wall, listening to the roar of rain around him.
“Well, I don’t have time,” Malfoy said. “My portkey leaves in an hour.” At Harry’s shocked expression he added, “Come home and help me pack?”
The medic popped into the tent, his voice cheerful. “Glad to see you’re up, chaps! Er,” he added when he saw how Harry and Malfoy were looking at each other. “Er, maybe I’ll come back.”
Hermione was telling a story about work a month later. Seamus was there with his new girlfriend, Hermione’s fingers grasped a tea cup in one hand, and entwined with Ron’s with the other as she spoke. Ginny’s practice was probably over by now, but she’d told Harry she had a date after, and that conversation was almost not weird.
Harry slid his hand up into Draco’s silky blonde hair, rubbing into the strands for a few moments as his eyes roamed over the other boy’s face.  This news seemed to have taken ten years off his life, he couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen him without a crease between his eyes.  The dark circles under them were still there and likely would be for awhile, if not always, but the stress was gone from his face.  He leaned forward, pulling Draco’s head in so he could kiss him again, making a low noise as their mouths slid together in practiced unison to fit together perfectly.
Harry shook his head, making a face.  "Not yet.  Not that it matters.  I could spend ten hours writing the essay to absolute perfection, but Snape would still give me the same grade as if I spent an hour just writing "chocolate frog" over and over again and handed it in."
And he left, which left Draco and Narcissa alone in the sitting room, neither of them speaking for a very long time.
"You can't ever have something just for yourself.  Are you REALLY like that or is just an act?" Draco asked,  his expression more curious and open than it ever was when faced with Harry Potter.
“I did it..”  Harry said, a short laugh pushing out of his chest as he looked at Draco.  “I actually did it and it was so easy...”
The deed went into his vault at Gringott's.  The key he pocketed and carried around for several more weeks before he did anything with it.
“Don't start anything.” Ginny muttered in his ear before turning to hustle the children towards the train doors.  She misinterpreted the stare Harry was giving his old enemy as one of hate rather than one of fierce curiosity.
Panic was rising in him now properly.  He could retrace his steps, he was pretty sure he knew which way he'd come, but what if something was tracking him by them?  What if something was already following right to where he was??
"I have no idea what you're talking about."  Draco responded icily, keeping his hands in his coat pockets.  It was really damn cold out.
Harry let out a noise of surprise as Draco leaned in and kissed him again, bruising and hard.  His teeth caught Harry's lower lip, biting into it roughly and giving it a tug before he let it go with a slick noise.  "I can shut you up if I need to do so."
Harry left first, looking at the map that Draco now knew everything about to make sure it was clear before he slipped out the door.  Once he was gone Draco let out a breath he didn't realize he was holding.  Now alone he went over to the mirror where the Daily Prophet clipping was and took it from the mirror. He had forgotten it was there until Harry had made reference to it that day, otherwise he would have removed it the first time they were there.  It spoke a little too loudly about something he wasn't ready to say anything about.
“It is true.” Draco said sharply, not particularly liking to have to admit it more than once in a conversation, but unable to tell a lie about it either.  “And he knew these things long before you were a teacher here.  I wasn’t to know you’d change profession.”
“This was all I needed.”  Draco said, flapping the note at Harry as he walked into the living room to locate the 'flat black rectangle that sort of looked like a picture frame with nothing in it'.  He patted the television in triumph, having seen it when he first arrived but had no idea what it was.
It took every ounce of willpower Harry had not to take a swing at Snape.  How could he and Draco trust him to help, to REALLY help when he was so petty and dismissive?
The tingling edges of panic that had started to grab at him slowly ebbed away.  He was grateful for that, though he knew that sometimes forcing all of that down came back to bite him in the ass later.
“Maybe not directly.” Harry said, shaking his head.  “But I don’t know what he knows about before.  About the war.  About what happened...”
"I was intense about my male friends.  She commented once or twice about that...  'You're so intense with your friends, Draco.  They'll get the wrong idea...'" He paused and chuckled, folding his arms in his lap.   "She said it once and I just looked at her.  Just silently met her eyes and held her gaze...  She never said it again.  So I think that was enough to either tell her what she needed to know, or give her an inkling that she didn't WANT to know and to leave it be."
“Fashionable...”  Draco said, the word coming out a little breathlessly as he still worked to breath properly and his heart came back to it's normal rhythm.
“I TOLD YOU NOT TO TALK TO THE AURORS!” He shouted, pushing both hands through his hair and turning like he wanted to kick something.  “Merlin.  FUCK.  I should have expected dealing with you...  I should have been prepared for the absolute AUDACITY that could only come from a Malfoy!”
But not without Draco taking full advantage of having Harry at his mercy to pry into some of the more private places of his mind.
I'm sorry for that.  I'm so unreliable.  But at least I -have- actually been eventually returning here to spend some more time writing.  At this pace maybe I'll be finished in a mere decade!  ;)
Harry pushed the smaller boy back, walking him backwards through the water to the very farthest corner of the tub.  His hands slid down Draco's back and over his ass to the backs of his thighs, pulling them upwards and on either side of his hips as he kneeled on the ledge under water, keeping Draco astride him.
"I can't leave my mother alone with him."  Draco shook his head, not even considering it for a moment, not even letting the idea sink in.  Not even dwelling on the idea of staying here, with Harry, which was an option he had not considered.
"Normally there isn't this much but whoever is behind this is bulking it out with the deliberate intention of making it confusing.  This is half, Kingsley has the other half.  We're both working on retracing the steps backwards and then forwards again to try and find the actual and real trail."
"Oh..." Draco realized then what Harry was talking about and he chuckled a bit, embarrassed.  "You went into the Prefect's bathroom once, right?" When Harry nodded he continued, feeling a little silly.  "There's too many faucets, I counted wrong and.." He shrugged again rather helplessly, smiling when Harry laughed.
He couldn't help but smile ever so slightly at the note of frustration in Harry's voice.  Some things, like wanting to taunt the ever loving fuck out of him, never went away.  No matter what the situation and no matter that he hadn't set out to antagonize him.
He slid down off the counter and followed Tom into the living room, but as he stepped into it, it changed to a wide, dark panelled and richly furnished room that Harry could now place as part of Malfoy Manor.  In the centre of the room, slightly floating above a pointed pedestal was a Pensieve.
Draco hesitated for a moment, warring the old instinct to keep everything to himself.  But he knew that in the grand scheme of things it no longer mattered.  He was likely dead one way or another at this point.
"No. No, I was just remembering what happened. I forgot all about it until I saw the desk.  Mrs Weasley had come up here to take care of it.  It was the same day I'd had that horrible trial about whether I'd even be allowed back into Hogwarts after using a Patronus in front of my cousin.."
"Difficult place to be in."  Draco said, nodding a couple of times, toying with a biscuit on his plate.  "Although I have to admit I'm a little angry that they're treating you that way."
Draco nodded as he sat down at the table, then got up again to go to the sink and wash his hands, speaking as he scrubbed.  "Very much so.  Malfoys have lived in it for as far back as any of us know.  Scorpius will take it over either when he gets married or when I just don't want to live there and be in his hair anymore."
Harry's eyebrows raised and Draco smiled at him, honestly kind of enjoying the surprise.  "Strange he'd go that far, isn't it?"
Harry didn't seem too moved by it either and Draco was rather pleased at that.  The dark haired man sat next to him relaxed with a small and completely benign smile on his face.
Harry paused, shaking his head a bit and Draco heard him let out a soft sigh.  Instinctively he reached over, touching the side of Harry's knee without looking at him.  A small gesture and connection of solidarity.  That he understood... Because he really did.
Suddenly Ron remembers his conversation with Harry. “That reminds me. I wanted to tell you what Harry told me the other day.”
“Yes, Blaise?” Draco asks tensely, looking at where Harry must be, even though the space where he just was is now completely empty. “I just woke up.”
“It’s hard to say, though probably someone not too keen on the Ministry getting in,” Draco murmurs, taking out his wand and gently casting a wordless spell on the spot where the floor plan has been tampered with. A shimmer of red hovers briefly over the paper, before winking away. “Dark magic, but nothing complicated. I’m sure I can restore it.”
Draco gasps, like his words were a sword that speared his chest, straight through the heart. He feels like crying. “How dare you—”
Lucy just sighs and continues brewing. She knows Harry’s stubbornness well, and won’t push it anymore. After a few minutes in silence, she stops stirring, and procures a small glass vial from her pocket. She uses a ladle to pour the dark violet liquid into the vial, then stoppering it before handing it to Harry, who takes it with a grateful smile.
“I wouldn’t call it fun,” Ron mumbles. “Pansy kept showing off and I couldn’t let a Slytherin look better than me.”
He sighs and picks it up, then drops it into the laundry basket. Hermione raises a brow at him, before taking her own shirt off and throwing it into the basket as well.
“Harry, we need to talk to you,” she says firmly, not bothering to sound caring as she has in the past. “It’s important.”
Draco tries to stand up and follow after Harry, but he sways the moment he’s on his feet, and Harry rushes over to hold him steady. “Thank you,” Draco says quietly, but he looks dejected.
The comment surprises Hermione, and she stops ruffling through the papers to look at Draco. She doesn’t quite know what to say. Has the thought passed her mind? Well, yes. But to actually
Just then Madam Pince walks resolutely past, a woman on a mission. They both look up distractedly at her soft heels clicking on the wood.
Suddenly it’s as if all the oxygen has returned to the room. Draco can breathe, though he does blush intensely at her observation. “I’m afraid I am rather not inclined towards…”
Harry cannot think—his body spasms—Pansy stiffens around him—Draco cries out—Harry moans as his hips jerk forward with his release, his fingertips pressing into Pansy’s soft skin.
” He walks forward, captivating Draco with his stare alone, that primal intensity that slithers underneath his skin. Draco can’t look away.
Would his father accept him? Would he warn him against it? Would he cast him out further than he already has?
When he’s with Draco, even like this, laying beside him while he rests, wishing they could be normal and sneak into each other’s dorms without risking everything, Harry can almost fly, can almost feel eternity rushing past him like the blur of the night sky as he rides on his broomstick, a vision of stars falling like rain.
“But don’t stand there, Hermione. Introduce me,” Harry says, and with a grimace Hermione walks back into the kitchen and Harry follows behind her.
“You know me, Draco. Better than anyone,” Harry murmurs, coming to a stop right in front of Draco, less than an arm’s length away. Draco holds his breath; he can see the black of Harry’s pupils widening, drowning out the green. There’s a shade of a day's stubble on his jaw.
“Do you ever wonder what we would be if I chose Slytherin?” Harry asks quietly, looking into Draco’s eyes. His eyes scan Draco’s face intently.
Leaning casually against the wall, head tilted back, cigarette visibly dangling between his lips, was none other than Draco Malfoy.
Harry looks up at him from the section of the kitchen counter that is not being used by his potions equipment. He’s smiling, but the dark circles under his eyes and the way his curls stick up from one side suggest he didn’t sleep that well.
Malfoy frowns, but his eyes glitter. “You heard me. We need to stay close, like this.” He drops his arm and turns to stand beside Harry. The backs of their hands brush, and Harry holds back a shiver.
With the conclusion of her speech, the conversation livens again, and the clattering of silverware and the chatter of young voices fills the hall. The proper rejoices at seeing old friends again are made and the usual gossip mill starts up, as good as new. Mr Thomas and Mr Finnigan laugh boisterously with Weasley. There is already talk of a Welcome Ball the following weekend, and many wonder if the Slytherins should be invited.
“That is very noble of you,” Miss Weasley says, nearly mocking. She is perhaps the only person Harry is comfortable with teasing him about this.
Harry cuts an unreadable glance to his father’s grave. “What if I don’t have a choice? What if I have to do it alone?”
Harry’s breath caught. His eyes fixated on Draco’s pale chest, traveling from the tattoo he saw earlier which was indeed the wing of a black sparrow arched across his chest. But there were more. Way more.
“Oi, eighth years, come over here!” Seamus yelled, enthusiastically waving his arm. Dean collapsed onto his side giggling.
“Dreams?” The word floats in Draco’s mind sluggishly, like a leaf slowly drowning in a current. Harry reaches up with his other hand, lightly tracing Draco’s cheek. Draco holds his breath.
“Whatever,” Draco said, flushed. He wasn’t going to beg, Harry knew well. His pride was already hurting. “Do what you want. But don’t pretend that this is real.”
“He’s your father,” Lucy begins, but stops and shakes her head, knowing her argument is futile. They have had this discussion many times before.
He lays back down on the blanket, and is about to close his eyes when a loud pop erupts in the room, and Harry almost shouts, sitting up straight like a lightning bolt. Harry looks around wildly, then sees Lucy peek out from the pantry door. When she sees Harry alone, she walks out, watching him with that childlike curiosity so distinct in House Elves.
Dumbledore calls him to his office, though he can’t imagine what for anymore. More memories? Harry knows more than he’d ever like about Tom Riddle. More detentions? Snape already gave him enough to last the rest of the year. He’s banned from Quidditch, too. But none of that matters as much as Draco, and the certainty that he will never see him the same way again. That it’s over.
“He hates me Draco, you know that.” Harry hears the steps getting louder. He looks at Draco, and there’s an edge of disappointment in Draco’s frown. “I’m sorry.”
“Look, Harry,” Ginny says gently, looking into Harry’s eyes. He stares at Ginny like he’s torn between apprehensiveness and indifference. “You don’t need to approve of all of Dumbledore’s choices. It would be dangerous to believe him a perfect being. But you need to trust him.”
Draco nods dumbly, and let’s Harry lead him up the stairs and into his bedroom. The moment Draco’s head hits the pillow, he falls asleep, silently as Harry remembers, and with a small frown between his brows. Harry allows himself one last look before going back downstairs to sleep on the couch.
Harry avoids Malfoy’s carefully blank expression, instead exchanging greetings with Shacklebolt and hugging Hermione as he makes his way to her side of the desk.
“I mean, if it’s what she wants, shouldn’t I be happy for her?” Harry replies, with his unfailing logic that always makes Hermione annoyed because it seems to miss the point entirely.
She awkwardly leaves him looking forlorn by the entrance to the boy’s dormitory, intending to pass the Golden Trio like she did the other night without a word. Just as she gets past the couch, however, Hermione calls her name. She stops reluctantly, turning around and looking at Hermione.
Draco half smiles. “I like when you get all passionate.” Then he leans in and kisses Harry, as if that were the most natural thing to do right then.
The elastic of his briefs was pulled down, and Harry shivered. Draco traced a finger up his inner thigh, followed by his tongue.
“About what?” Harry asks innocently, taking the cup, but he already knows the answer before Hermione gives it with a roll of her eyes.
“I hadn’t expected this, is all,” Draco says, following Harry over to the couch. They sit down and Draco cuts himself a slice of Manchego.
The first thought that crosses Hermione’s mind is that he is lying, playing a prank on her, or something equally as insensitive. But her second thought is more of a question...what if?
Outside the sky twinkled with stars, and the moon shined bright and round. There was a slight breeze, hints of a harsh winter to come. Harry and Draco walked side by side, down the cobblestone street until they were alone.
“Well I really can’t stay long,” Ginny say before Ron can speak. They both turn with identical confused and demanding faces.
He shakes his head slowly, his head spinning as it always does when Luna’s words can mean one thing and another at the same time, and Luna’s gentle smile gives nothing away.
“I will send you my address tomorrow night when you can come by,” Harry says at the door, already pulling his hood up over his head, shrouding his face in darkness. For a moment, Draco sees another face beneath the hood with that same smirk, and he goes very still.
“Oh, right...” Hermione trails off, looking at Ginny and Dean, and how enviously perfect they seem to be together. But maybe they aren’t perfect at all. Hermione remembers her talk with Ginny, and how flippant she had been about Dean.
The tip of his wand flickers with light, then sputters out, like the flame of a candle in the wind. He clenches his jaw and swings his arm as if he might will his magic to work, saying the spell again through gritted teeth. The light flickers again, then suddenly a blinding light explodes from his wand and fills the entire room, waking everyone with shouts and curses.
He had known for a long time. Then again, he did not know and he was utterly helpless. But none of it mattered if they did not survive tomorrow.
“Pansy, would you get more wine from the kitchen?” Draco asked in a drawl which he used when he wanted someone to pamper him.
They were discussing who to send in the closet with him. Seven minutes in heaven. He hoped they sent Pansy. She was the only person he would be comfortable kissing, given that they knew they were totally incompatible. Knowing his friends, though, they would send someone to embarrass him. Maybe Granger, who annoyed the crap out of him. Or Greengrass, a kind, sweet girl, but so simple minded sometimes that Draco got bored listening to her.
Suddenly the door opens again, and this time it is Professor Slughorn, bustling in with an anxious smile, sweating slightly, and muttering apologies as he walks up the aisle to the front of the classroom. He pats his forehead with his handkerchief.
After composing himself, he faces his father with Fate’s hand on his shoulder, and says with dooming finality, “Tell me about the mission.”
“But you don’t need it?” Harry finishes for him, smirking. “Snape is a two-faced liar, trust me, I know, so he probably doesn’t want to help you anyway.”
“We’ve always been more than friends, Harry,” Draco says softly, as if it has always been this way, and maybe it has. He inches closer, and his hand settles on Harry’s waist again. His fingers creep underneath the hem of his shirt, cool against the hot skin of his stomach, which turns over excitedly when Draco’s hand runs flat across it.
Ron nods, his eyes wide. “I trust you.” Her heart warms at the words, and she holds out her hand. He takes it with a small smile, and they fall headfirst into the memory.
“No!” Harry backs away violently, shaking his head. “Draco, this is bad. This is bad. You’ll regret it tomorrow, I know it.”
“Why?” Harry asks, though he could probably hazard a guess. Even the thought of Draco doing such a thing makes his stomach twist nauseatingly. “Tell me what’s going on.”
The cool air of the London night gusts across his face when he steps out of the bar, his eyes adjusting to the bright lights of the street lamps as he rounds the corner into the alleyway, his body humming with the warmth of a few drinks. He fishes a cigarette out of his pocket and with a quick glance around to make sure no one is looking, lights the end with a quick snap of his fingers.
Blaise smirks. “He’s been best friends with you and yet he’s never made a move? Impossible. He had to be gay. You’re too irresistible, not to mention funny.” Blaise pauses to kiss her lips slowly before pulling away and murmuring, “And smart.” He kisses the hollow of her neck, and she muffles a nervous laugh. “Ambitious.” Pansy turns onto her back as Blaise kisses a path down her stomach. “Honest, even if it hurts.” His mouth travels past her navel, his tongue darting expertly as one hand settles on her inner thigh, shifting her legs over his shoulders, the other easing a finger inside her. “And, of course, loving.”
“That’s enough, now,” Hermione interrupts, placing a finger on his mouth. Her gaze strays over Ron’s shoulder to where Harry and Malfoy were just moments ago. “Where are Harry and Draco?”
But he didn’t say that. He simply watched the storm wreck everything he ever loved. It was easier, to let the pain sink into his skin like small daggers of glass.
“I—I can’t—he’s—I—” his eyes dart around and she shushes him gently, a finger on his lips, brushing softly.
“Why would he never tell us?” Ron asks out loud, then shakes his head. “You know what, it doesn’t matter. I’m sure he had a reason.” He scratches at his stubble. “If he loved someone, why did he date Ginny?”
“And I’m serious, too,” Harry says in a low voice. “I know you have been sneaking around the castle at night. I know you are up to something. I just don’t know what and you won’t tell me.”
But now Hermione sees that there was something between them that she had overlooked. Something she had always missed, something she cannot name without the rest of the sentence, without the rest of the story.
Draco weaves seamlessly through the crowds of students milling about Hogsmeade, his grey robes inconspicuous in the dreary weather, and if anyone notices him, they quickly get out of his way. It takes Harry more effort to pass people, as many call his name and want to strike up a conversation.
“Really, you didn’t have to,” Draco says quietly, glancing at the romantic set up. It’s a nice gesture, but it only makes Draco’s chest pang painfully, knowing that it all means nothing beyond that closed door.
"I'm gonna–just..." Draco jerked his thumb in some direction, never good at acting discreet. Pansy barely paid attention to him, and said goodbye half heartedly. Blaise, on the other hand, watched Draco go with sharp eyes, and a little too much clarity.
“You and Ginny, of course,” Hermione says, though seeing Harry visibly relax as if in relief makes her sound the opposite of confident in her intuition. “You know, the other day, we saw her kissing Dean. I had said more to hurt Ron than anything else that she was dating him now.”
Harry slides Draco’s briefs down, and Draco’s cock springs free, hardening under Harry’s touch. Harry kisses the tip, then takes it all in his mouth, his cheeks hollowing. He looks at Draco from underneath his lashes, and it takes all of Draco’s self restraint not to lift his hips and fuck Harry’s mouth, those reddened lips that slide up and down his shaft.
Ron raises an eyebrow at her, but she ignores him. Harry doesn’t listen to flattery and charm; he automatically weeds out those attempts of conversation, used to a life of fame and superficial adoration. No, this time Hermione has decided to get straight to the point, and will waste no time trying to cater to Harry’s feelings when he never appreciates it.
Looking at Harry in so much pain and knowing he’s part of it, that his memories of Draco will always be tinged by darkness and death, make Draco wish he could comfort him, make it right, kiss him until Harry can’t remember why he’d ever hated the sight of him.
“Well, yes.” Draco’s brows furrow, noticing Pansy’s anger. “But only because she asked how you were doing.”
When Draco saw the flash of recognition in Harry’s eyes, he knew the rejection would come. And when that Weasley boy told Draco off, he also saw the flicker of surprise and respect that briefly made itself known on Harry’s face—too fast for anyone less shrewd than Draco—and he looked at Ron as if he were someone totally different, before schooling his features into a slight disdain towards Draco.
“Why should I?” Harry asks harshly, raising his wand. “You’re my enemy now, aren’t you? If I know the danger you threaten my family with, I should do anything to prevent it.”
“She’s good. Our trips have been amazing because of her. I always hated traveling, you know, for the longest time. As the youngest in a big family it was awful, never any peace, always chaos. But Luna slows me down.” Ginny smiles to herself. “Makes me stop and look up at the stars.”
“Draco…” Hermione hesitates, eyes averted to the ground, then sighs. “Well, she’s not exactly your type, is she?”
Harry hates him, suddenly, with such intensity that only when he realizes he's kissing Draco with as much strength as he can muster does he realize that he only hates how much he loves him anyway. Beneath his lips Draco moans in delighted surprise, wrapping his arms around Harry’s neck. Harry pushes away all the doubts, all the worries, that he is walking a line too thin to hold his weight, to keep afloat the heavy darkness in his soul, and plies Draco’s mouth open with his tongue.
Then Harry liked Draco. Maybe he liked him from the moment Draco walked in the pub that first night he called out to him on the street, those grey eyes wary, the delicate blonde hair tousled in curly waves. It was a curious feeling, a warmth and a sharpness, like an ache in his chest.
They had sex on the sectional by the window on the first day of Harry’s suspension, and they’d won Auror’s of the Year the year after that, so what did it matter?
Still angry, Harry exhaled in a rush and turned back to the track again – it was good to keep walking for a bit after a run anyway.
The wards surrounding the Manor only allowed outgoing apparation and apparation within the building itself, so Harry appeared at the road and glanced around to see if any Muggles had been passing by. He needn’t have bothered. The closest village was thirty kilometres, and Muggles weren’t overly enchanted by the view of the near-barren landscape.
Harry pulled back, not a lot, just far enough to look at Malfoy, to marvel in the fact that he was still here, in his arms, in front of him, looking only at Harry.
“Don’t want to hear your meandering bullshit.” Draco yanked a navy set of robes over his head. “You do this every time. Either go or stay, but stop torturing everyone with your endless qualms.”
Potter didn’t kill him, but his eyes turned wary in an instant. Still, Draco wasn’t missing the opportunity to help Potter, a crazy life debt that could not be repaid by a near-drowning conversation, but Draco was still going to try.
Ginny wasn’t there as Harry came home to change. One of the many benefits of being an Auror and working odd hours was that an affair was incredibly easy to fashion. Combined with the fact that Ginny’s Quidditch season kept her extremely busy for nine months of the year.
A wave of fellow feeling went through Harry, only Rahim would forget in a while, he’d go home tonight with his favourite people in the world, and even the Firebolt 2.0 prototype Ron procured for a delighted Rahim and his horrified parents wouldn’t make Harry feel any better.
Potter’s blinking face appeared as the door opened. He was wearing a Muggle t-shirt and soft-looking jeans. Draco hadn’t thought about it a week ago at Hogwarts, but Harry Potter’s face in the faint sunlight of the morning was the most beautiful thing he’d ever seen. Blaise was right: Draco had been obsessed for years. But that didn’t mean he knew Potter, or
“Yeah?” asked Draco, not sure where Potter was going with this, but blown away by his name in Potter’s mouth.
The affair itself was hideous. Draco took one step into the great hall before he realized he could never go back in that room again.
The walk back to the disapparation zones outside the gates was long and colder than he’d ever felt. Although even days after, he could still feel the heat of Potter’s lips on his.
“You did,” said Draco, “but that’s not why I’m here. I was right, too: you do deserve the world. You deserve–” Draco exhaled, frustrated. He shoved his hands into his pockets and tried to pretend like his biggest problem was the stupid amount of money he’d spent on the rose and his embarrassment covering tomorrow’s papers. He thought of a thousand reasons to walk away right then.
Harry blinked and the room was pitch black. He heard Draco breathing, the bed shifting under their weight. Harry wondered what Draco was thinking, if he listened to Harry’s breath too, if he could feel every slight movement he made. Maybe he was already asleep.
Harry doesn’t reply. He sits up, though, and crosses his arms over his knees, hugging them to his chest. Ron can’t tell if he cares or not.
“As we stand here today, and over the course of the next year, we all have a choice, as the late Professor Dumbledore always said, to choose what is right, or what is easy. As the eldest year, you lead by example, and as honored heroes of the war, the responsibility is, to say the least, significant. While you are all here first and foremost for an education, I must remind each and every one of you that this class year represents something much greater, a symbol of unity after years of destruction and fragmentation.
“You did...”  Harry said, turning his head slightly and keeping his hand out.  “You signed the waiver when the Ministry officials were at your house.”
He thumped down the pile of books he was carrying, picking up the one off the top before he sat down across the table from Ron and Hermione.
"Most of it is a variation on what was in the letter I did get from you accidentally.  But you should read this part again." He put a hand against Draco's as he started to unfold it to read right there.  "Maybe later.  When you get home."
“Shut it.  It was you, your testimony.  There was no other way we would have been pardoned.  No other way they would have truly believed that we hadn’t been in on the master plan when.. he.. came back.”
"You can't help who you are."  Draco said quietly, keeping his hand where it was with the small warm touch of Harry's finger against his.
The woods were silent again except for the sound of their breathing, fast and hard to start with, but slowing as minutes trickled by.
"I know.  That's why I think we should start on that now.  We don't know if we'll need to talk to her, but if we do, we want to have a plan in place beforehand so we aren't in a rush if and when the time comes."  Harry brushed his thumb once more against Draco's cheek then lowered his hand.  Immediately he found he missed the warm softness of the other boy's skin.
Without thinking too much, which would have likely caused him to change his mind, Draco got up and went to change.  With fresh clothes, his hair combed and teeth brushed he went out, going down the stairs and out into the street.
Hermione looked unconvinced, but even she brightened a bit as she, then Ron, then Harry passed through Filtch's screening with absolutely no issue.
Draco smiled at him tightly, already starting to put together his mind so he could resume being his 'normal' self outside the door of this refuge.
But, he had to admit, that wasn't surprising.  Harry, for all his good qualities, (and even Draco had to admit that he had a lot of those) tended towards tunnel vision.  His focus wasn't on anything other that Draco getting Theodore to agree to come under Ministry care.  Everything that happened around that was superfluous.
The latter raised both eyebrows as he looked at the cake and then to Draco.  "Well, it looks neat.  Good presentation.  I like your colour palette.  But how does it taste..."
"Dementors in my Muggle neighbourhood.  And they're coming for us..  One's got Dudley and is leeching off his energy so hard and fast...  I was terrified.  I cast the Patronus without thinking twice because what else could I do?  I sent them away, I got Dudley up and we limped home...  But not before finding out one of my neighbours that I'd known my whole life there was a witch.  That was baffling, but not quite as much as the Dementors."
The walls were an off cream colour, scuffed and chipping in more places than they were intact.  The carpet was dark brown, shag, and looked like it would be sticky if he touched it.  The whole place gave off a wheezing wispy odour of malt vinegar.
The phrase circled his head again and he reached out one hand to place on Draco's shoulder.  The pale boy flinched but didn't pull away.  "I don't care anymore.  What you've been up to.  What you've done.  I heard what you said."
"Mm hmm."  Harry nodded, already chewing on a chip from his box as he led the way down the street.  He swallowed and then continued.  "It's called Take Away."
It was, it had to be said, kind of amazing.  Proper, perfect and always impeccably outfitted Draco had a room that looked rather typical for a teenager.
He waited, not moving to touch the door, not even taking another step closer to it, hoping that he would maybe get some sort of sign.
It turned out, luckily, it didn't.  He had the name of what he was making and he had the ingredients in front of him.  Somehow, no matter HOW simplified and pointless Harry had devised a pretend technical exercise, the ingredients all knew exactly what they were supposed to do.
“Was his influence that strong?” Draco’s tone wavered slightly, almost with a tinge of hope to it that made Harry furrow his brow.
Hard enough that Draco jumped a bit in front of him and took a step back.  A slow smile spread across his face as he looked at Harry, his eyes brightening from grey to near silver.  “You did it..”
Draco turned away again and fell into step with Neville as they walked at a relaxed pace down the street.  He was imagining what it would be like to turn Malfoy Manor into flats.  How it would be divided up.  How it would look when it didn't just belong to him.
He said that he and his mother had saved him.  He knew what his mother had done, how she had lied to Voldemort once confirming that Draco was still alive.  That with her lie it had given Harry the cover needed for the last leg of what had to be done.  But had he, himself, saved Harry?  He didn't think so.  Harry thought so, but he didn't think he had.
"You could tell what he was doing, right?"  Draco asked, rubbing his hand over his arm again once the fabric covered it.  "I heard him screaming about it, angry that no one had figured that out before."
Half of him wanted the other man to just forget all of this, to claim it wasn't actually true, that it was just like he'd said... A stressful time, not thinking clearly...  And half of him was angry that Harry would even suggest that when he knew those feelings were
He couldn't jump too fast into talking about the Ministry stuff.  Not knowing what he did about Theodore and his family.  Which meant, he couldn't explain where he was and why he was there, which made things complicated.  Especially since Theodore had asked him straight out.
there was a Vanishing Cabinet at Hogwarts where as they were supposed to be operating under they idea there 'must' be, not for sure....
Harry went silent again for a few moments, seeming to debate within himself before he got up and went to a desk in the corner of the room.  He looked through what was obviously the pages of the letter Draco had sent, picking up one and bringing it back over to him.
Harry twitched his wand toward Draco again and released the bindings.  Draco groaned as he shifted to sit up, rolling his shoulders and his head with a sigh.  "You could have just secured the house against me without me knowing once I got here.  Then told me I had to stay."
Draco made a strangled noise, startled by the words.  He jumped to his feet, reading them again, and then again as if he expected them to change.
The warm places were making the cold retreat.  They were making his ribs relax, and he could gulp in anxious and needy breaths of air.
"Why we split up?"  Draco asked, raising his eyebrows a bit, smiling when Harry nodded.  "It was a few things, really..."
