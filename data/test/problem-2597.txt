Harry went over and picked out a mat from the storage room. He came back out and rolled it out parallel to Oceania’s.
A small snort from behind him jolted Harry around. Jane was looking at him sceptically, if a dragon could be sceptical. Harry glared at her.
In the end, it was just this – Harry’s morning breath on his cheek before work, buying dinner ingredients together, learning each other’s grooming routines (if Harry called that grooming). In the end, it was Draco on Harry’s lap as they watched TV and Harry’s eyes on Draco’s as his fingers twisted inside him and the dawning realisation that the future for them stretched out of sight. It wasn’t a loud ending, because of course, endings don’t really exist. There were no explosions, no affairs, only a few fights that calmed down quicker than either of them expected.
“You live together?” asks Draco, despite herself.
Malfoy blinked and then turned and began to climb up the mountain ridge. “See you around Potter,” he murmured, and then he was gone, up, up into the rocks.
Malfoy’s brows went up, in surprise instead of scepticism for once. He looked just like he had when Harry had first tried to discuss the thematic context of Jane Eyre with him.
He hated drugs. He hated them.
Tom nodded. “That makes sense.”
“It’s the praying type,” Hayden said eventually. They didn’t look pleased at the admission, and even though it didn’t make any sense to Harry, it seemed to mean quite a lot to Oceania.
kind of the same, prick or no prick.
He had expected to get the letter. He hadn’t thought there would be a problem with the letter. But now the letter was here, and Harry was leaving it on a hotel floor and stepping around it every morning. Harry was avoiding his room more than usual because of it. Harry was running, at every opportunity, around the perimeter of Gay Dragon Village, and he was always running away from it.
“Okay.” He said after a long moment, and folded his arms.
Harry looked back to the view of the mountains. For a few wide moments, the silence was as encompassing as the sky.
Harry stared at him. He took in a shaky breath. “No,” he said. “No, I’m – I’m not going back.”
With a horrible sense of foreboding, Draco opens her mouth under Harry and kisses her back. Harry’s hot tongue is everywhere, and oh, how Draco has missed her, how Draco has loved her – and then her hot hands are everywhere too, gripping her hips, pressing her in closer, reaching to unbutton her shirt – and Draco turns her head to the side and gasps.
“I didn’t know you needed glasses.” She says softly.
“Okay.” He answered.
He was teasing. Harry looked at him for a long moment, and then looked away, out, out past Jane and over all the mountains, the jagged edges and snow tipped peaks, the clear, ripe blue sky.
“Harry,” said Oceania, looking at him. “Would like to help me finish the ceiling?”
“Oh, yeah, of course.” Harry got to his feet. Jane snorted a little from behind him.
“You would, Luna darling.” Zambini rested a polished elbow on the table. “But to answer your question, Harry: why yes, I like to think of myself as one. And to answer yours, madam: it has been going the way it always goes, which is to say it has been ebbing and flowing, some days spilling forth from me like a monsoon rain, and other days breaking from me in stubborn little increments, not unlike chipped ice. But you know what they say –” and here he swivelled to direct a lazy look at Harry, “the water does not flow until the faucet is turned on.”
Harry flung himself back onto the grass hill. “I hate you both.” He couldn’t believe he was getting excluded by Malfoy and a fucking dragon.
“Harry,” said Draco, looking up again into his eyes. “You don’t have to do this because we are friends.”
“Right,” said Harry. “I’ll see you next week.”
“What the fuck are you laughing for?” Draco scowled, even as his hand returned to Harry’s chest, dragging it down over Harry’s happy trail. Not like someone who had just professed their unrequited love at all.
dress like a girl. And…it was confusing. This village was confusing. The whole world was pretty damn confusing.
It was already dark outside. He closed his eyes, letting his back hit the mattress.
Harry turned to look at Malfoy, finally breaking off. But Malfoy was just looking at him, and his eyes had deepened in the way that they did sometimes, when Harry got talking.
Hayden raised a thin brow. “What I say,” they said, and then leaned forward on the counter, mimicking Harry. “He won’t use it.”
“I don’t know what your friends are thinking, that I’m not your type,” Draco said much later, all conversational as he hung up his leather jacket and various knitwear. It was a week after they'd first gone to the pub together; they'd just come back from the second time. It had involved rather more pints, and few comments from Ron that had caused Hermione to kick him under the table - case in point.“I’m everyone’s type. I appeal to the universal conceptualisation of walking sex appeal.”
“Harry Potter,” he said, and Harry’s stomach jolted. “You have no idea what you’ve gotten yourself into.”
But when Malfoy’s hands find their way under Harry’s shirt, rubbing against all that hot hot skin, her fingers smooth over it in reverence, like worship. Harry can’t breathe, and all of her is aching so wonderfully.
“All the time,” he said, almost unthinkingly. “Can I ask you something?”
“No,” Harry said immediately. “No, I – it’s just. It’s good to hear your voice. I – how’s the new dragon? How’s Jane? How’s Mayo?”
“I mean,” she said. “Is it even possible to know yourself? What is identity? Everything is fluid, always changing. All you ever get is close. Close or far. Distance is the only variable.”
But he still hated them. Harry Potter was rolling over in front of him and muttering things, his dazed eyes fixing on him. Draco didn’t think he should be here for this. He shouldn’t have come. Why had he come?
He could feel Malfoy’s eyes on him, but when he looked over Malfoy was swirling patterns onto the table-top again. Perhaps he didn’t know what to say. Harry rarely did, when he had people over.
Malfoy appeared closer with a glass of water. His lips moved strangely, plumping up in the middle and then flattening out at the sides. A smirk, Harry realised. He stared.
“I didn’t know that. She never mentions you.”
Harry held up two diagrams and looked at Jane for a moment.
At the word “guns”, two arrows were printed facing up, presumably towards where Harry’s biceps were supposed to be. He closed his eyes calmly and made himself think about purple-coloured mesh.
he said. “Reading is
Something was going to happen. He was sure of it.
“Nothing.” Malfoy looked away quickly. He was sitting up very straight in his seat.
“That’s good,” said Charlie.
He forced himself to move. He sat down on the edge of his bed and looked down at the letter. He ran his finger over his name.
“Harry,” gasped Draco. His gaze raked over Harry’s, his hand sliding up the nape of Harry’s neck and into Harry’s hair. Harry could feel the places where it tugged, the places where fingertips probed. The eroticism of it caught him off guard, and his hips rose again. Draco leaned in, and for a moment it looked as if he was going to rest his cheek along Harry’s collarbone, and then perhaps they would both calm down until they could stand up again and go about their own business normally.
Harry hopped onto one of the red-cushioned stools and ordered before turning to Charlie.
“I know you love me, Charlie,” Malfoy told him clearly, and he relented, leaning to rest his forehead on Oceania’s hair.
“Yes,” said Hayden and relaxed a little, leaning back on the counter. “Oceania’s like that. More so with Draco, though.”
And Potter leads her to the right bedroom and presses her into the mattress, and kisses her some more, and climbs on top of her, and every part of Malfoy that can pulse pulses.
Harry grinned as they continued to run.
He met Harry’s gaze and then his mouth turned up again, not quite a smile, but not quite a smirk either.
She turns over, and Harry blinks her eyes open. Her cheek is folded into the white material, her lashes short and stubby, almost slanting downward into her waterline. Her lips are still chapped.
“Draco,” Harry said, eventually. His voice was hoarse. Draco’s breath hitched.
“Right,” says Potter all of a sudden, her cup coming down to meet the counter loudly. Draco starts, and clutches at her own cup.
Harry had to swallow down his laughter. For a moment, they both enjoyed the simple pleasure of the empty cafeteria combined with the soothing clacking sounds of a tea cosy in the process of production.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry leans back and grazes her fingers against Draco’s chin, turning her head to look at her.
There was a pause.
He finally forced himself to look over at Malfoy.
Harry glances over at him as bunches the poor shirt in his hands and smiles with all of his teeth.
The place Zambini recommended was the same place Luna and Harry had gone to the other day. Harry had been so surprised that when Zambini had told him the name he had blurted out, without thinking: “That’s where Luna and I went the other day.”
Part 2:
“No.” He wanted to believe it. People made things difficult because they couldn’t be honest with themselves but being with someone was really just – an agreement. All someone had to do was ask, and all the other person had to do was say yes. Like – “I live close by,” and then – “Alright, Harry.”
Everything was quiet around them. It was just Malfoy and him, here in his little hotel room, trying to find something. Harry realised he was leaning forward, and he didn’t move back.
It had been quite a while since he’d been down to the actual village of Tengboche. Harry found the absence of dragon-taming pens a little strange, and then immediately had to fight the urge to laugh at himself. He was starting to see the world like Charlie.
“You’ll want to be hydrated.” She said, nodding at the cup.
Downstairs, someone was talking on the phone. There weren’t any noises coming from upstairs. He wondered if there was even anyone else staying in the whole hotel.
Malfoy’s voice sounded so different than it had a few minutes ago that it surprised Harry into looking up. His face was strange, vulnerable in a way that Harry hadn’t seen before. Vulnerable wasn’t the word. It was strained, fiercely hurt. It was more painful to look at than it had been to listen to his voice when he had said Harry’s name earlier.
“I know.” Draco sounded tired instead of pleased, like Harry had thought he would be.
He wasn’t normally up early enough to see it.
“Thank you,” said Harry, as Hermione pressed a hot cup of tea into his hands. He was sitting on one of the sofas in the lounge. The sunlight illuminated the wafts of heat swirling up from the tea cup.
Harry closed his eyes. Everything inside him was rising up. He felt it swell beneath his skin, a tidal wave on the peak of cresting. Craving, desperately, the switch from potential to kinetic energy.
Malfoy puts down the cups and walks over, her eyes darting over Potter’s neck, shoulders, chest. When they’re face to face, Potter reaches out and draws her in with a hand guiding each arm, easing them back, back, around Potter. She can feel Potter’s breath on her cheek. She can feel Potter’s nose brushing her nose.
It was one of those days.
“Mmhmm.” Charlie looked like he was trying to appear understanding, but his lips were pressed in a white line. “And uh…how did that come about?”
“Malfoy,” Harry laughed, pulling at his wrists. “God, sorry. It’s not a big – come on, it’s just me, it’s not like I’m judging you.”
“Osh,” he said. “Could you get Draco?”
Malfoy smirked wider and crossed his arms. He looked like he was enjoying himself entirely too much.
“Stop worrying about that. Just get over here.”
Charlie was the only one not laughing. But when Harry turned to him, he blinked slowly, his gaze rather unfocused, and simply mumbled, “T’was performance art, that.”
When he finally got to the cafeteria, all the tables and chairs were gone. He blinked, the space in front of the few dusty shops stayed empty. He blinked again, and then went and got some bao zi from the kitchen.
“All packed then, are you?”
“Come on,” said Oceania. “I think we have enough to finally figure out the conundrum of the cows.”
“You’re a piece of shit,” she says against Malfoy’s chest. “Good for nothing.”
And there was this:
“Where else?” said Tom, and then nodded at Malfoy. “Come and at least sit down Draco, your anxiety is off-putting.”
“That’s right,” Malfoy had said, nodding. “It gives his dragon the chance to go and have a smoke with the other dragons. Catch up on all the goss. Complain about the clingy parents behind their backs.”
He looked back over at her. She had moved onto the blue wool now.
“It’s four in the afternoon.”
Sometimes though, it did hit Draco, the weight of getting something he had wanted so badly. Being with Harry was like walking into a world where love really did win everything and rain became pretty. Draco would stop where he was when he felt it rise up inside him and grow a little off-kilter, find it a little difficult to breathe.
“You needn't look so surprised.” says Harry, amused. “I read.”
“Should we…?”
Hermione reached out and put a hand over his. It was so much like what she’d done right before he’d left that for a moment Harry felt dizzy.
“Thank you,” he told her. She smiled.
Harry liked the way he pronounced
Draco hitched up his hip, and then one of his eyebrows. He looked – he looked positively deplorable.
“You can have this one.” she whispers. “It’s not going anywhere.”
Harry turned to face it, but he didn’t miss Malfoy smiling to himself. Whatever. He wouldn’t be able to smile for much longer.
“S’pose not,” said Charlie, “Except, what else is worth surviving a war for?”
“Oceania,” said Malfoy, turning to her, his voice warm. “How’s the persimmon, love?”
“Yes.” He looked back to her. “Sorry.”
“Am I making you?” asked Draco, but he didn’t really sound like he meant it.
Malfoy was standing there, still looking at him. He looked shocked.
“Charlie!” said Harry.
He also liked this.
Malfoy seemed to accept that and loosened his stance, but stopped when Harry continued speaking.
“Come off it, it’s just me. You can have a seat, you know.”
Malfoy’s eyes flickered up to meet his, weighted under his lashes. They were soaked in sunlight, in a way that reminded Harry of honey on toast.
“What?” Draco turns over and stares at her.
“Am I doing something wrong?” he asked.
“You have to forgive yourself you know.” Malfoy lifted his head from where he’d been fiddling with his fingers, pressing the knuckles together. “You have to – you have to
“No,” said Harry. “It’s kind of refreshing, actually.”
The smell of burning juniper was rich in the air. Harry breathed in deeply, as if meditating. He exhaled, slow.
Pansy didn’t stop, but it was like she slowed, if only marginally. For a moment, Harry thought she wasn’t going to say anything.
“Oh for god’s sake,” said Draco. “It is already established: I am a stupid Caucasian. Forgive me of my sins, etc, etc, I’m sorry that I didn't do my washing earlier in the week. Can we go now? We're going to be fucking late.”
“Do you want to go die in a hole?” asked Oceania. Harry was taken aback by her vitriol. Drunk Oceania was
“Malfoy!” says Potter. “What a lovely shirt you have on! I’ve always liked blue.”
“What about you?” Harry asked. Malfoy tilted his neck to look at him.
Malfoy swallowed. It looked different in his throat, long and white like a lily. His gaze fluttered down.
“I’ve got a reservation?” he tried, and the blonde woman sighed and pulled out a clipboard.
“Harry Potter,” he said, and Harry could hear the grin in his voice. “I am going to fucking kill you.”
Both she and Hermione cast him looks of disgust.
There were past the door, and then past the empty reception desk, and then there were spiralling up the stairs, until they were back in the room. Harry let Malfoy in first, and then spent a long time getting the door to close properly, fiddling with all the strange locks. He could feel Malfoy looking around, his gaze sweeping the dingy sleeping quarters for a letter that was worth the way that Harry had said it. I got a
All the blood rushed back into Draco’s face. “What?”
“Of course,” echoed Luna faintly. Harry could hear the smile in her voice. “Very obtuse of me.”
Harry looked up, surprised. “Thank you,” he managed, after a pause.
They had stopped.
“I’ve actually been here before,” said Harry.
When he’d finished, he lied flat on his back on the mat, breathing hard. The sun was starting to come out. Corpse pose.
“Oh, hush.” She waved a hand in his direction. “Come over here and do some yoga with me.”
Harry wriggled closer. “To build a life for myself. Get better. Get happy. Be brave about it, like you said.”
“Well,” said Charlie.  He sounded hesitant. “We could get you a new dragon. If that’s what you wanted. It’s not really – it’s difficult work if you don’t know what you’re doing.”
The brow arched even higher. “Aren’t you going to ask how I clean them?”
“C’mon,” he managed after a few more minutes. “Can you at least tell me what it means?”
“Charlie doesn’t wear them.”
“Alright,” said Harry.
“Hm.” Draco makes a noise in the back of his throat. “You should probably take your shirt off.”
, Potty?”
“The first thing we’ll need to work on, it seems,” he said, stopping right in front of Harry, “Is attitude.”
“Well, now you’ve blown it,” said Oceania. She grinned with all her teeth. “I’m an undercover auror, and I’m putting you under arrest, sonny boy.”
“I want you,” says Harry. “I want you.”
Harry wouldn’t be surprised if all the photos ended up with singed holes where Malfoy’s eyes were supposed to be. When there were enough, he crossed back over and unbuckled the gag. It was wet.
“You know I will,” Draco said softly.
“Are you implying that you have perverted tendencies?”
Draco exhaled and walked into the kitchen. He rinsed and dried his cup, counting to ten in his head, and then counting to twenty. Then he walked back into the kitchen.
“I don’t think surface differences matter,” Oceania was saying. “But I think, when it comes to core values, most couples have the same beliefs. The soul has to recognise itself. Maybe.”
Once they’d collected themselves, Harry brushed his teeth as Draco went to the bedroom to change. Harry took a moment to imagine what Draco’s bedroom must look like. Before Gay Dragon Village, he would have easily imagined an extravagant four-poster bed, and maybe the heads of various house elves propped up on the walls, all complete with a stuffed toy snake to cuddle up to. Now, after coming here, he found that he was picturing things a lot more along the lines of a waterbed, and maybe a trampoline.
“What?” snapped Harry, “Don’t you have somewhere else to be?”
Harry passed it to him. Then he leaned over on the dusty wall, his hands in his pockets. “Why are you organising them like that?”
Harry looked out the window. The view was mostly obscured by the surrounding forest, but in the distance one could see the faint tracings of the mountain line. A few birds fluttered by, calling out to one another.
“Are you?”
“He needs a name?” Harry resisted the urge to retreat as the dragon clambered out of the cage and unfurled its sleek wings.
“Urm,” said Harry.  He felt very aware of Malfoy’s discomfort.
“Harry, you depraved alcoholic.” Malfoy flung a hand out dramatically. “I can’t abide the sight of you and your type. You represent the scum of society.”
But he wasn’t in Scotland. He was here.
Harry nodded.
In the dream, it happened like this. Draco was in a lake in the Himalayas and the moon was above him. It was a perfect setting. He took off his clothes and went into the lake. It was almost a perfect memory.
Their words were just noises, rushing over him like a bubbling brook. Harry Potter opened his eyes, and reached for the pole.
“Jane flew off after the connection?” Draco was frowning even deeper now. “But shouldn’t she feel
The muscles in Malfoy’s back bunched even tighter. “I should never have come here.”
“That’s good.” Oceania tilted her head to the side as if she was trying to read something that was a strange angle. “I thought you would.”
Harry answered honestly anyway. “No. You’re right; I was curious about you.”
“Fuck yeah,” said Harry.
“You told me not to be late.”
“Doesn’t that surprise you?”
– fucking good all the time, how are you so fucking
“You can’t tell Mum about this,” said Charlie wrapping the bandage around Harry’s arm. Oceania sighed and pushed him out the way, wrapping it much more firmly.
Harry had never sat down and thought to herself: I might not be straight. Of course she was straight. Because straight didn’t mean liking boys – it meant normal. And Harry had had her fair share of abnormality, thank you very much. So she was straight.
Malfoy’s eyes opened. They were sharp. “That’s not all I like. Harry, I –”
He closed his eyes for one quick moment. “I,” he said, and cleared his throat, “He said that this was… “Gay Dragon Village”.”
“Well then,” he said happily. “In that case, I’d like to apologise for all my unfortunate missteps from my childhood, and to ask you to get drinks with me.”
“How are you?”
“It’s more okay to be drunk,” Oceania muttered darkly.
“Preparing.” The other side of Hayden’s mouth quirked up. “Did you forget?”
Now Draco really looked pained. He was looking away again, the tendons in his neck sharply strained.
“I know you read.” Draco says, turning away and pretending to peruse the next shelf. “I just didn't know you liked love stories.”
“Thanks.” He handed the bottle back to Malfoy, who scrolled on the lid with one hand. His face was still bent towards the view, open like a sunflower.
“Can I open my eyes yet?”
“Perfect,” said Harry. “I hope it catches my head at just the right angle to trigger irrecoverable memory loss.”
She thinks that maybe life is just like this for everyone, no matter how far they go – that maybe there is this inevitable loneliness waiting for every person at the end of each road, at the end of every stone path they walk down – that although they can make it as pretty as they like, they are always alone. And then she thinks that maybe it’s just her, just a flaw in her system, in her choices, in her mind where something went wrong, something did or didn’t connect to something crucial – and then she thinks that maybe this is it, that maybe, her biggest flaw has just turned out to be her need for love.
Harry raised his brows. “Are you all involved?”
Zambini didn’t look perturbed. “Ah, well,” he said, smoothing down the lapels of his lovely suit. “It was worth a try. Do send Granger my good wishes if you’re still in contact with her; I always did secretly admire her. And I’ll let Draco know that you’re looking well.”
Blaise Zambini looked politely taken aback. “Don’t you remember me from school?” he asked.
“Not eyeballs, then.” Ginny smirked wider.
He supposed – he supposed some of it was that he had never really imagined anything for his future beyond Voldemort. Beyond the war. He was constantly coming back to his past in order to path his future – constantly coming back to Godric’s Hollow, to Privet Drive, to Hogwarts – even now. What if he didn’t want to go back anymore? What if he wanted to move forward?
“Maybe it was crude phrasing,” said Luna. “I do like your company, too.”
This chapter's song is Take U There by Missy Elliott, Jack U, and a fuckton of other people. If you enjoyed, please leave a comment! It means a lot. And as always, thanks for reading :*
“No,” said Harry. Hayden kept looking at him.
“Hi, Harry,” she said, not looking up. “How’s it rolling?”
Harry scrambled with the diagrams for a moment, then promptly dropped them all on the floor. Malfoy and Jane rolled their eyes in unison.
Harry leans back against the kitchen table as Malfoy brings out two cocktail glasses and an ice box. The apartment is surprisingly simple, clean, modern – not quite how she imagined Malfoy living. Then again, nothing here is how she imagined it would be.
Really, it was only a matter of time.
“I did not,” Malfoy shot back, “Don’t push this onto me, you filthy initiator.”
After a few more moments, Oceania held the tea cosy up again. She pressed her lips together pensively.
“Hello,” said Luna, pleasantly. “Are you mid-yoga?”
But everything was ready. It was time to go.
Malfoy shrugged, one pointy dip of his shoulders, the mesh sliding down on one of them. His skin gleamed under the electric lighting.
“Yes, daddy,” he said sweetly.
“You can call me Gao,” said Gao, with only a faint Chinese accent tinging her words. She was a short woman, and a cardigan with professional looking squares on it. She smiled politely at him – as easy as if they were two strangers passing amiably in the street.
There was a pregnant pause. Harry though he could hear his own heartbeat.
Harry tilted his head to the side, considering. Malfoy had taken out a martini glass and was examining it under the moonlight.
“Thanks,” said the barista carefully. She had been eyeing him cautiously ever since his third. He felt like he was about to shake out of his skin.
He was so fucking beautiful.
“Do you want to?”
“Harry.” Charlie sat down next to Harry and put his hand on his knee. He was using his low, “soothing” voice. “I heard you had a fight with Draco.”
Malfoy turned his head to the side, listening. “I’ve never had one,” he said carelessly.
“Hullo,” said Blaise Zambini pleasantly once he was within hearing distance. “It’s Harry Potter.”
“Speaking of which.” Malfoy ignored him in favour of selecting a flogger with a glass dildo as a handle. “This is one of my personal favourites. Good for when you’re lonely.”
Malfoy shoots her an incredulous look. “It’s a not particularly heart-throbbing story,” she says. “I just looked at some tits one day and thought: “Fuck, I want those in my face.”” She frowns. “That, and six packs were about as appealing as a loaf of bread.”
Sometime later, Malfoy came back down. He looked very surprised to see Harry in the kitchen.
“Come on,” she said when she reached them, grabbing their wrists. “Let’s go put up the paperchains.”
“Yeah,” he said. “I was really just, like, listening to my gut, you know. Artistically. It was drawing me towards a certain vision.”
That was mostly alright with him. Being busy helped keep the blueness smaller, as Luna had put it. And at least he was engaging. He was ok with just being ok. God knows there were a lot worse things to be.
“Yes?”
“It’s more like he had a fight with me.”
“Loving isn’t a form of giving. It’s just love. I love to love, because it’s the best thing about life. Love isn’t the same thing as taking care of someone, although there is often overlap. Love is just there. I’m not sacrificing my time or energy when I feel love for you, Harry.”
The sound of crunching gravel broke their camaraderie. Harry turned to see Charlie approaching, looking weary. Harry supposed a night of drinking in the undergrowth could do that to you.
“Mm,” said Gao. “Maybe expand on that for me.”
“Hmm.” Oceania looked up from her notebook, where it looked like she was drawing up plans for either more tea cosies, or possibly a castle. She followed his gaze to where he was staring at one of the cafeteria chefs, who was blond, square-jawed, and inexplicably dressed in a skin-tight shirt that had rips around his biceps. “Oh, sure. That’s Johnny. He’s tender.”
– like a chemical reaction. Harry’s feet jerked. He leaned back.
“It’s not a house,” says Draco. “It’s a cottage.”
Harry clenched his fist, tucking his chin back into his shoulder.
“Ah, yes.” Draco rolled his eyes, which was a feat truly worth of notice. “Fucking is the apex of where I want to feel most respected.”
“Harry,” said Hermione, frowning again, “I’m not sure that’s better.”
Malfoy was engaged in a severe eye duel with Hayden. They were both spectacularly dignified.
Life was ever widening.
“I told you you didn't need that extra jacket.”
Ron takes a relieved sip of his drink. Harry waits for him to finish.
It wasn’t like the first time he got high. Maybe it was because he’d done it before or because he was in a – relatively – better mental place, but this time it wasn’t so overwhelming. He let the calm contentment roll through him and wondered what it would be like to be able to feel this way without drugs helping him.
The fear was coming to a head in Harry’s throat. “Tell me you have experience with this,” he said to Draco.
“Even if you were,” Oceania continued, oblivious to the state of paralysis that was taking over Harry’s body. “Why would it be a bad thing to love you? I love plenty of difficult things. Mustard. Knitting. Draco.”
“No way,” said Harry, more amused than irritated. “You can’t be serious.”
Several boat tours sail past them as they walk, all lit up with fairylights and camera flashes as fuzzy French voices filter through megaphones, and behind them the black water of the seine cuts unto undulating ripples that flutter long after the disturbances have passed. Harry is kissing Draco’s neck, and Draco thinks that he is a ripple, too.
“Harry.” Luna’s melodic voice floated into his periphery. He turned to find her standing there in a watery dress that fell to the ground, her pale hair pinned back over her ears. “I didn’t see you arrive.”
“It’s okay,” he said suddenly, before Malfoy could panic. “It’s okay, I’ve got you. It’s good for me too.” He rolled his hips again, almost like a kindness. “Do you feel how hard I am?” he said gently. “That’s all for you, Draco.”
“Okay,” said Draco. He waited.
“We connected,” she told them all, mysteriously and with great significance. Harry blinked over the edge of his cider, but no one noticed.
“Jane Eyre,” said Harry, surprised. He looked at Malfoy again, more deeply.  “Is – are you –“
There was the loch. It looked different in daylight. And Malfoy wasn’t there. But it was still wide and endless, its reflective surface as secretive as it was beautiful. He fell to his knees and dipped his fingers in. The ripples were delicate as they lapped around his skin.
He was thinking about it now.
The moment between Draco’s soft, wondrous,
Harry frowned. He unlocked the handcuffs. Malfoy didn’t wait for him to take them off fully – he was already up, putting space between them. There were red indentations at the corners of his mouth. He’d been biting down.
The view was wonderful up here. It was lower than the clearing they’d been too, but still impressive. You could see over the trees, right over to the undulations of the mountains, the sun splayed over the entirety of it. Everywhere you looked, there was nature, bounding and blooming and brilliant.
“Wow,” said Ron once they’d got him some water and settled down again. “What a life.”
“Yeah?” Ron rubbed at his jaw, like this was perfectly acceptable answer. “Well…we missed you.”
,” said Oceania. “All of them.”
Harry felt himself flush and look away. The sound of someone else’s noisy dragon echoed from the village below. White ice lined the mountainous silhouette.
Malfoy seemed to be struggling. He was gnawing one slim lip, his cheeks hollowed in.
“Okay,” he said after a moment.
“Well, what the bloody fuck are you into?” Harry blurted out. “Fucking…chest hair? Noses? I’m pretty sure I’m the least kinky out of all of you.”
“I still don’t entirely understand why this is necessary,” said Harry. He was sitting on the edge of the hill, and Jane was out of her cage and only secured by a chain lead, a fact he was stanchly not thinking about. Malfoy was sprawled out a few meters away, wearing sunglasses and scribbling in his notebook again.
Draco knew he was in love, but he didn’t think this was any exaggeration. It couldn’t be. Surely, it wasn’t Draco making Harry glow like that – surely, surely, his skin was really golden, his soul was really flickering, a candle in the dark room. Maybe it was the temple that made it more intense – maybe it was having him next to Tom. Tom, who was lovely, Tom who was important to Draco – but who he could hardly see next to some stupid Gryffindor boy that he had never befriended, that he had never kissed, that he had never made love to or shared secrets with.
Harry held his gaze.
“Oh, Charlie!” Malfoy slapped a hand on the table. He looked delighted, if not a little manic. “Why did you deny us so? Look at me! My blood sugar levels are perfectly low!”
“My redemption arc?” Malfoy finished for him.
If one was aware of everything that was hurting all time, it would be impossible to survive it. Pain was everywhere. It lived in the trunks of every dying tree, sprouted in the crush of every crinkled leaf. It was in the soil and in the air, in the mountains and in the sea. It was in every living thing, because to be living was also to be dying. It was everywhere, and if one was aware of it all the time, it would be impossible to survive it. It would be impossible to want to.
There was more silence. Harry picked at a loose thread on the sofa. There was a patch of sunlight warming the side of his thigh through his jeans.
Harry shook his head, soft and slow. “I already know,” he said, very calmly. Malfoy froze, and then he was facing Harry, leaning against the other counter, one cup in his hand.
Harry leaned back into his chair, staring at where the purple edges of the sun were just starting to bleed into the clouds. Charlie’s words rushed over him like a tender lullaby.
“It’s just so –“ Harry abruptly sits up, the sheets pooling at her hips. She gnaws on her lips as she thinks it through. “It’s so quaint. It’s just so…nice.”
“Yes,” he said, “Are you?”
Draco’s eyes went imperceptibly wider. He swallowed, and swallowed again. “If you must,” he said faintly.
“Well,” said Hayden, and sucked another bite of fried rice of their chopsticks rather lasciviously, “That seems like an answer only you have.” But their expression seemed to rather indicate that they had an answer too.
“When have I ever said that?” said Harry, and now he sounded annoyed, and god, that really was a thousand times worse than all the other things. It made something in Draco crumple in on himself. He stood taller and tried not to show it.
So he did. Because the blue was part of him, but he shouldn’t let it decide for him. Not anymore.
Harry rubbed his eyes furiously. The hurt in his stomach was only sharpening.
“Did you fuck?” asked Hayden. They were grinning like a Cheshire cat. Tom raised his brows at them in dry amusement, which was one of the few traits he shared with them.
“Ah.” Hermione’s face relaxed. “Good. That’s good then.”
There is a part 2 coming soon! Thank you so much for the support so far! The song for this chapter is Lost In The World by Kanye West and Bon Iver. During the flight scene with Jane, I always imagined Life of The Bird by the Cinematic Orchestra however, if anyone is curious.
One of the monks laughed from across the room. Harry felt the rest of him light up too.
Charlie gave a hearty laugh. “Can you imagine? Mum would throw a hissy fit if I managed to lose you in the Himalayas on the first day. Or any day. Don’t get lost Harry, ay?”
She breaks up with Ginny too, in that time – a quick conversation, the kind that only occurs when you’ve both been broken up for a while already – “I’m sorry,” say Harry. “No you’re not,” says Ginny, looking at his glass of orange juice. “And that’s okay. I’m sorry, too.” – he’s traveling now, exploring the world on a professional broom.
“So I’ll be the last one to see you here.”
Harry Potter was by no means a stranger to being brave. But he had told Draco once, when he was drunk, that the bravery he had had during the war didn’t belong to him, and in many ways, this was true. That was the thing about bravery. It was so often squeezed out of you, a product of circumstance rather than any particular singularity of character.
There was something intrinsic about Oceania’s strangeness that made it seem as though she’d been born into it, perhaps like Luna Lovegood. The thought that she had had to fight for it, that she had had to
“You’re hotter,” Ron offered. Harry turned back to look at him.
“Quel est le problème?” Draco says, turning to the cashier, and she explains to him that it’s 2 for 3 on the ham, and that there’s a discount on the cereal. Once they’re outside, Draco finds Harry staring at him.
“Oh,” said Harry, passionately.
Harry is more honest with Malfoy than she ever is with anybody. She is most honest when is laid back and twisted, when her hands are behind her back and Malfoy’s riding her waist, or holding her head against her pussy – she’s most honest when she’s begging for it, or screaming, or crying until she can’t think.
“Yes,” said Malfoy. He sounded amused. “Well observed of you.”
“You did?” Draco looked shocked.
“I’m sorry,” he said, “I do want to. I’m just –”
“You can say no,” said Harry, speaking more softly now. “It’s alright if you do. I just wanted to know.”
“Are you leaving?” Draco asked. His voice was soft.
The first question read:
Malfoy flushed as he put the paint palette down. “Oh,” he said, not looking at Harry. “I don’t know love. Why don’t you name the first one?”
Harry rolled his eyes. “Are you going to let me in?”
Draco Malfoy stepped out of the woods.
“Now and again.” says Harry.
“Charlie!”
He took off his shoes in the porch. There were three sets already, in a neat row pressed along the wall. There were jackets on the hooks. A few hats on a shelf. Draco had taken off his satchel – it was slung along the jackets.
“Merlin.” Malfoy was still rubbing his face. “Christ. What a fucking question, Harry.
“Okay,” said Malfoy.
“Of course I do. Do I look like I have anything better to do with my time?”
She leads Draco into the bathroom, which has been tidied since Thursday, and presses her gently into the wall.
“Are you enjoying yourself?”
“Shhh,” said the girl, and then straightened up and pointed at the mat, “Come here.”
“Urm,” said Harry. “I thought you could stay with me. Unless that’s not what you want.”
It wasn’t all that easy, in truth, to cast a patronus with the sickening crack of Harry Potter’s body playing background, but Draco was good at his job. Very good. So when his patronus emerged, it was no surprise to see its full form.
“I’m Harry. It’s nice to meet you.”
So Harry was staring. The woman with the huge nose piercing and a shawl with winged potatoes on it stared right back. Harry touched his hair self-consciously.
“It’s not just like that!” Harry yelled. He was on his feet as well.
Harry turned back to Pansy, but he wasn’t looking at her. He was looking out the window just over her shoulder. He said, quite deliberately: “Do you really think I haven’t heard that sort of advice before?”
Besides, Ron and Hermione had had each other. And here was another awful truth: even though he had loved them – been beyond grateful that they were alive – sometimes it felt like they weren’t enough. Not for the brimming inside of him.
“Is that strange?” she asked, after a moment.
“I can pray for him,” said Oceania.
“You make me do awful things,” said Malfoy, ignoring him. “Things I would never do otherwise.”
And he was so young.
“Hm.” says Draco, once they’ve both finished off their ice creams. “I kind of want a crepe now.”
Draco set the glass down. His face was remarkably sober. “Can I do that?”
Malfoy’s laugh suddenly became background noise as Harry took another bite. God. He had never had such a good brownie, not in his life. This was better than treacle pie. This was, God. So chocolate it was beyond chocolate.
“Oh,” she said through her mouthful. “It doesn’t matter to us.” She swallowed. “See, I’ve always thought that celebrities are just like the rest of us once you meet them. Everything that’s magical about them is in your head.”
Oceania chided, but Charlie didn’t look perturbed. Harry admired his inner strength. Perhaps there was something to be said for caring more about dragons that people.
There was something in the water, thought Draco. And then he thought: no, no, that’s wrong. I got confused. That’s just the moon.
So now Harry was at the pub with Draco Malfoy, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, and Luna Lovegood.
“God,” said Harry. “Gross.”
“Turn over.” She says.
“You think I’m weak,” he said, and it didn’t sound sharp, like an accusation. But it didn’t sound soft, either.
thought Harry. What came out was, “Who gets to decide that?”
“You know, it’s perfectly alright to want it.” Malfoy wraps one lean calf around Harry’s hip, almost lazily. Only Malfoy could make even sex seem languid. She flexes her ankle at the small of Harry’s back. “It’s perfectly alright to want tits, to want to lay it on me like I’m just a slut, just a fuck, to want to own it like a piece of meat.”
He could tell. He could always tell. He noticed everything when he wasn’t constraining himself – every detail, every tiny gesture. It wasn’t even a stereotypically Slytherin thirst for knowledge or whatever – just pure ambition, just an innocent consumption of the world around him. He was grateful to be alive, was what it was probably.
“Draco,” says Harry again, looking alarmed, a hand on her shoulder. “Draco, please, tell me what’s wrong, why are you crying, why are you like this-“
“Do you want tea?” he asked, wheeling Draco’s suitcase over to the lounge. “Or like something to eat? Did you have food on the plane?”
“Why do you ask?” Harry let himself lean forward, too.
“Okay.” Harry smiled. The wind tumbled over the tufts of his ridiculous, wonderful hair. Draco could tell where his eyes would crinkle when he got older.
“Draco,” she breathes, leaning in to lick the tears off Draco’s cheek. “Darling, I’m here. I’m not going to leave. Draco, I promise.”
“He uses it to cover up his fear of intimacy,” Oceania said casually.
Harry laughed. Malfoy lit up.
He still thought about Jane sometimes. He thought about her being free, and didn’t regret it. He wondered if Draco ever saw her, and that was why he’d written it. He wondered if Draco ever saw her, and thought about him.
“Mmm, yes, but you can’t have done at first. How did you get here-“
“Do it.”
“I thought you went running all the time,” he said quietly.
Unbidden, the thought of white limbs and snarky jokes and the smell of roses flittered inside him. He inhaled sharply and shrugged, awkward.
Harry turned back around. “Why are you acting like this?” he said, looking at Malfoy. This close, he could tell that Malfoy was wearing makeup.
“There you are,” Charlie said, grinning and giving a thumbs-up to the smiling monk. “Making friends with the locals already are you?”
“Yeah.” Charlie scratched his head. “Thing is, well, she’s not quite right. I don’t really know how to put it. Sounds a bit stupid out loud.”
SweatyBetty was in town. Harry tried to comb his hair, and promptly gave up, as per his morning routine. He put on the black trench coat. He put on some boots. He went out.
This room was too small.
“I’m going to kill Charlie,” said Harry, “How the fuck does this shit always happen to me?”
Charlie’s voice was shrill. “I knew I shouldn’t have left him alone with the gays!”
He couldn’t stand it. He rolled over, his head falling down heavily on the crumpled duvet. Draco Malfoy was still standing in the door frame, tall and white. He was looking at Harry. There was another truth in that look too, but Harry didn’t want it. He shook his head, left to right. The image moved slowly, exposed too long. Malfoy’s blurry white body filled the doorframe, then the room.
“Fifteen ten, well isn’t that just impressive? And to think, this is what is just sitting on hand for you. Now one thinks it rather would be worth a trip to the pantry.”
“Hey,” he said, the light flickering in those green fucking eyes. The corner of his mouth tilted up, ever so slightly. “Wanna come over?”
“Well,” said Hayden. “It was once too many.”
“Oh, urm.” He took a step back, glancing cursively at the rack. “I, urm, don’t have strong feelings.”
Outside, the landscape was only marginally more colourful. He rubbed his nose.
Draco smiled, and then as casually as passing salt, pushed Harry right in the middle of the chest. Harry startled and fell backwards, helplessly. He landed softly. When he opened his eyes, he was in a cocooned world of roses.
“Good.” Ron clapped him one more time on his shoulder and then let go. “I mean, it would be fine if you were. Whatever makes you happy, man.”
Tom was still looking at him. Harry had to look away. He felt like he was being told a secret, like he was being exposed to something private, even though Malfoy had already said something along those lines. Was Tom betraying Malfoy? Surely, they had some sort of understanding. It certainly looked that way.
“Right – ” said Malfoy.
“Erm. Yes?” He couldn’t remember Malfoy asking him to leave.
like being hit,” Harry mused.
“What?” Harry huffed and looked up at the ceiling of winding branches tattooed across the blue. “I’m the easiest to understand.”
If it had been any other time, he wouldn’t have done this. If it had felt any easier, even just a little, he would not have let himself do this. But it wasn’t another time, and it wasn’t any easier. It was only this.
“Right,” said Harry.
“Oh, look,” said Harry, “A meadow.”
What did Draco Malfoy want?
Harry pointed. “I made you tea.”
He looked over. There was a low, cold wind today but they were still holding hands. Draco could feel the familiar warmth of it. Harry looked dashing in his new trench coat.
When Malfoy was unsure he got awfully polite. Harry didn’t know why he was asking this.
“Don’t swear in front of Luna, love,” murmured Blaise.
“Harry Potter,” he said.
“Like…” Harry racked his brain. “I’ve gone diving in Majorca. I learnt how to make pearls. I’ve shaved my head bald. I’ve built a chair from scratch. I’ve made a soufflé. I’ve visited every Starbucks in Glasgow.”
“Good, I think,” she said introspectively, after a moment. “A lot of different things have been happening for me. Good things and bad. For example, I bought my own house. However, it is a modern muggle house, and I haven’t quite managed to get the central heating working.”
“Yes,” said Hayden, “Might as well get used to it. Merlin knows you’re outnumbered.”
Harry frowned again, but Malfoy couldn’t see it.
“Shacklebolt sends his wishes,” Draco had said in the ward, stepping forward only to pass Harry some of the papers he had been working on since the incident. He had kept his eyes trained down on the carefully drawn diagrams. “I figured you might want these, considering your dysfunctional relationship with inactivity.”
Harry let his eyes drift across the now blurry room in confusion. “I’m…cleaning my glasses?”
The air between them grew very thick. Harry was remembering it, and he knew Malfoy was too – knew he had made Malfoy think of it, that he had put it in his mind. He could count the spaces between them, the steps it would take to – one, cross into Malfoy’s space – two, take a hold of his hip through his coat – three, roll him over onto his belly – four, bend him at the hips – five, wrap his other hand around the front of Malfoy’s throat – six, move his first to pin Malfoy’s wrists onto the table-top.
“No,” said Harry. “No, it’s – manageable.”
Draco was indeed pushing some of the books over to the other end of a sofa, making room to sit. It was almost funny, how neat everything else was – all the furniture and the decorations – in direct contrast to the books. It served nicely as a metaphor for the duplicity of its owner, Harry thought.
“I might tear my arm off in your
Harry took it, his fingers overlapping Malfoy’s long white ones. There was a moment where he stared at that too, but then Malfoy’s fingers were gone and a brownie was being shoved in his face.
Harry had felt fear many, many times. Perhaps overexposure ought to have desensitised him to it. But there were many types of fear, and it was just as strong each time.
Another time, Potter comes when Draco is outside doing the weeds. Draco normally tries not to go outside too much, but realised just the other day that the walk down from the path would be so much prettier if there were less weeds. She’s even considering planting some flowers.
he said, breaking character, and then looked at him more closely. “Is it that good?”
The non-road faded into a red dirt path, which abruptly steepened before straightening out again. As they came around the last large boulder, the camp came into view and Harry sucked in his breath.
“I’m thinking about you.”
different?” he exclaimed. “Have you met yourself?”
“Right. Um.” Harry racked his brains. “Jane?”
“Do you normally bootycall your friends?” Draco sneered, then felt himself blanch.
“What are you getting?” she asked, checking her watch.
Oceania was grinning too. “Yes, Harry,” she said, and brushed his back as she went.
For some reason this made the heat churn up into Harry’s neck, his face. He could feel it under his beard.
He reached out. “Malfoy,” he mumbled, “Malfoy.”
“Sometimes I don’t know I want things until they’re right in front of me. Before that, it’s…too far away.”
Draco couldn’t remember the question. Harry’s hands were solid on Draco’s knees, and he couldn’t remember the question. Harry was stepping closer, and he was every answer.
The pointed friendliness gave Harry the sudden horrific mental image of Draco reporting back to everyone in Gay Dragon Village the events of the Loch. But just as suddenly as it arrived, it faded. He found, to his surprise, that he trusted Draco Malfoy.
He brought his arms to the sky, and into prayer position over his heart. The sun had risen, and it was right there, balancing on the line of the horizon like an orange yoyo teetering on its string.
Everything outside Harry froze up too. It was strange, the sudden flexibility of the moment, as it happened over and over again, like an echo, and Harry’s mind tried to bend it into a shape that would make sense to him. Something was happening, and it was somehow both larger and smaller than Harry ever thought it could be.
“I like that he writes,” said Luna. “I don’t necessarily like all of his writing. But I like that he writes, in general.”
“Fine,” said Hayden, stepping forward to drop the so abhorrent blue cheese into the trolley. “I’ll cry at home, alone, with my blue cheese beside me.”
“That’s good,” said Oceania, and she said it softly. The room was filled with so many colours. “That makes you human.”
“Done a good job tidying up the place. She and Neville spent the whole of yesterday painting and lifting.”
“No,” says Harry. “I didn’t think you cared at all.”
“Alright.” Harry ended the recording on his phone. “Very funny.”
Back in the plaza, he unrolled it slowly, making sure it was flat. Then he took off his jumper, and started doing yoga.
“Go make a mess in the shower.” He says, reaching over for his lotions.
He didn’t know when it had come to this. When he had transitioned from the Harry Potter that could feel pain in a way that was still okay, to a Harry Potter that couldn’t feel okay at all. He didn’t recognise himself.
She glanced at Harry. Then gasped comically.
“Well,” Says Malfoy, leaning back after a long moment and sighing, cleavage heaving ridiculously. “If you’re just going to gape at me, I’d best be going. See you around, Potter.” Slinking past Harry, she’s out the door before Harry’s fists have even fully clenched.
“I’m trying.”
A tendon in Malfoy’s jaw flickered. His face turned towards Harry, but his gaze stayed sovereignly on the ground.
Pansy shot him another, final incredulous look. “Yeah,” she said. “We're friends. The point is kind of
To Harry’s dismay, Malfoy was actually quite good with dragons. There was clearly something he was doing right, although Harry couldn’t pinpoint what it was. But Jane was now letting him stroke her, which was a far cry from previous encounters, to say the least.
A sharp laugh echoing from the bathroom indicated that any timing precautions taken had been futile. Oceania just quirked an amused brow at him.
he settled back into the chair and opened his mouth.
“I don’t think you have to put your hand on my knee to tell me that,” said Harry.
They were empty right now, but were clearly used. Draco passed them without paying them much of his attention. He clearly familiar with the route.
At first, Harry didn’t think it was kicking in. The room was the same – the colours just as solid, the air just as clear. He’d swallowed, tapping his fingers against the mattress. What if it didn’t work? What if his brain kept him here?
Harry was having trouble looking at Malfoy’s face. Maybe it was because the letter was just sitting there, in his lap, one of the corners resting in the cradle of his thumb, the other digging into one of huge blossoming flowers across his thigh.
There was a speech bubble coming out of the muscular man’s mouth.
Harry laughed again. “Draco,” he said, and it came out more fondly perhaps it should’ve, but he was too exhilarated to care. “Get up here.”
“I’m sorry?”
Oceania ran a hand up and down his back. He leaned into the touch. “Of course I did,” she murmured. “Of course I did. Loving people is always the same. People are people. Everyone’s damaged, Harry.”
“Yes,” said Harry, once he’d gotten a hold of himself. “Yes, you’re right. I did. Thank you.”
“Thanks,” said Harry, and paused. “I like your top.”
Malfoy casts Harry a look. “Potter,” she says. “I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but you’ve been verging dangerously into stereotype territory since you put that first tender digit in me.”
“Draco’s really lovely,” said Oceania, “And very funny.”
The counsellor themselves was private and ungodly dear, but the thing about private therapy was that you didn’t have sign up for a fuck off long waiting list – and Harry reasoned, since he had money to throw at things, why not throw it at something which might actually fucking matter?
“No offense,” said Ron, “But I’d say they were a bit more than wrong, mate. Parkinson tried to hand you over to Old Voldey, remember?”
“Does one?” Harry smiled and crossed his arms. Draco didn’t appreciate what it did for his biceps. “Well, be my guest. You’re free to roam.”
“Is it?”
Draco puts down her brush, very quietly.
“See, thing is,” Harry said, “Not so sure I am. Earlier today I thought I saw Draco Malfoy.”
“It's not,” Draco had said. “It smells like piss.”
Pansy raised a brow. “Save your flirting for Draco.”
“He didn’t die in the war.”
“Thank you,” said Oceania, looking pleased and settled, which is how Harry liked her best. “I’m happy too.”
“Hey,” he said, after Malfoy’s finger came away for the fourth time. “Can I open my eyes yet?”
The eyebrow came back down and indented itself unnervingly above Malfoy’s long nose. There was a pause where Malfoy was clearly unsure of what to say.
Or maybe it was just Oceania had always reminded him of her. When he thought of Oceania, his heart clenched acutely in his chest. When would he see her again?
“Harry,” she begins to say, trying to push back with her hands on Harry’s shoulders, but Harry just drops her mouth to Draco’s now exposed shoulder, dragged wet flesh across Draco’s dry skin.
“No, her other dragon tamer – yes, you. Can’t you see the rest of us are busy?”
“Oh!” Oceania clapped her hands together. “Did you? Oh, he’s lovely, isn’t he?”
“Okay,” he said. His voice was rough, as if he hadn’t spoken for a long time.
“Absolutely. It reminded me of you. Perhaps I should lend you some.”
Hayden sat up straighter and wiped their sexually ambiguous mouth on a napkin. “Surely,” they began. “If you were mad, you wouldn’t want to know. I wouldn’t.”
Harry looked up. “What?”
He looked over at the fragile light illuminating the person beside him. Draco was looking out at the green too, the sunlight like dew in his lashes, and he was so beautiful just then that Harry had to stop. They were on an idle Sunday walk in early December, and you could taste Christmas in the air.
“Malfoy!” says Potter when she looks up, and Draco just stands there, her mouth tightly closed.
he’s philosophical,” he said. “Wise words, Potter, indeed.”
Harry was probably going to have meditated anyway. It helped, sometimes, when that dull bruised feeling settled itself in his stomach, stubborn and disabling. He sat down cross-legged on the floor, and gestured for Malfoy to do the same.
Malfoy opens her eyes, and Potter sways back. Her hand wraps around Malfoy’s wrist.
Luna had bought a lot of seeds for flowers. Harry was not a particularly experienced gardener. For a moment, he and the pile of seeds merely regarded one another.
It hurt too much to stand still.
Harry, refusing to let Malfoy see his arms shake, held the meat up through the cage. There was a pause, in which Harry could hear his blood pound in his ears. For Merlin’s sake, he thought, he’d escaped a Hungarian Horntail. He’d broken out of Gringotts on the back of a Ukrainian Ironbelly.
But his flat looked the same. Exactly how it had looked in his memory, exactly how he had expected it to. He had thought that it would be jarring, but it was so exact that, instinctually, he felt that he’d never been away.
Outside, the sun was colourless. It dripped in through the gap in the curtains, a thin line of white cutting through the grey. Harry stared at it for a few minutes, and then got out of bed.
Harry opened his eyes. The world looked the same, but bluer.
It didn’t bother him, like he might’ve expected. Instead, he felt more relaxed around Tom than anyone else.
“You know…” Malfoy began, and cleared his throat. “You’re not exactly what I expected you to be, either.”
“Draco’s a complicated person,” she told him. “If you really want to understand him, you should ask him yourself.”
Malfoy shot a disbelieving look at Harry, suddenly looking more like himself.
Harry glanced down at the grass. He felt over spilt.
Harry swallowed. There was so many words for
Harry took a step towards him.
“Urm, okay.” Harry shuffled, still in the crouch.
“If you want that,” said Harry, and it was like he knew, like he knew already.
“As you always tell me.” Malfoy took the mats in her arms and added them to the top of his pile, before turning on his heel and heading towards the temple.
“I hope you choke on your cheese,” said Oceania, and then pushed the trolley towards the conveyer belt.
“Merlin.” Draco turns around and tries to keep walking. Harry’s laughing as he catches up again.
“I’ll make sure to wear it next time! Just for you!” Malfoy yelled back, but Harry was already stepping into the street and apparating.
“Mm.” Malfoy’s gaze flickered past Harry’s shoulder and then back to his face. “I mean. You ran up to me and grabbed me.”
“You can come back up now,” said Oceania, and Harry watched their collective bodies rise like a wave. “We’re going to do our lotus pose.”
Then, ever so slightly, she nudged at his hand. Just a little. Barely enough to feel it. But he did. Her scales were smooth under his skin.
“This calls for celebration,” said Tom, and produced a bottle of champagne from seemingly nowhere.
He felt a wave of gratitude roll through him.
Harry looks over at Malfoy.
Just me, wildly changing the entire tone in the 6k smut scene. That's what happens when you put on lofi in the background.
Harry relaxed his shoulders. The truth was, he had been entirely unprepared for the possibility of Draco Malfoy’s depth. But here he was, one foot in, suddenly aware of the entire loch before him, and the unknown beneath him. The wind was still tracing its fingers over the pale surface.
“In,” said Harry, “And out.”
Potter blinks and blinks, and then Draco opens the door, and realisation dawns on Potter’s face. “Ah, okay.” she says, and forces a smile. “I’ll be going then.” She walks down that stone path and Draco closes the door. Takes a deep breath. Reaches for her tea.
“I think she’s already started.” Harry turned to look at her. “You move quite quickly through things, you know that?”
Harry leaned back in his chair, just a little. The pub wasn’t so busy that it was stifling, but it was busy enough to make the air feel alive. He opened and closed his mouth.
For now, he would have to pretend. Harry said, “Let your thoughts pass over you, but don’t engage.” He was at once outside and inside Malfoy. Thinking and unthinking.
Harry breathed in. He breathed out.
He put the card back in his pocket.
“Sunday is writing day,” said Hayden, “But you should still go. I’m told it’s “fun”.”
“How does it feel?” He heard himself ask, into their little bubble.
Harry smiled back. Was Hayden a girl’s name or a boy’s name?
Harry nodded. He pressed the edge of the glass to his forehead, feeling the condensation mix with his sweat.
“Who are you to talk?” Harry snarled back. Sharp, present, cruel. “As if you’re some beacon of wisdom or purity or whatever. As if you’ve never run away. Have you forgotten who you are
Harry had never thought he would have felt a profound understanding with Pansy Parkinson, but here he was and it was happening. There was nothing to be done. They looked at each other, and then, by mutual agreement, turned and kept walking, lapsing back into silence. The apparition point was not too far after that.
Harry looked up at him. “I already know why,” he said, feeling warm and cold. “You’re right, I didn’t need to ask.”
Oceania made herself tea, and then leaned back on the opposite counter. She regarded him over the top of her cup and smiled, just a little.
“I don’t think that’s out-of-character,” said Harry. “I’ve done plenty of things you don’t know about.”
There were a lot of my favourite scenes in this one. The song for this chapter is Desire - Gryffin Remix by Years and Years, although One Minute Man by Missy Elliot was a close contender, and was definitely playing in the club scene.
“We need to,” Harry spit water out of his mouth, “Get you out.”
Draco closed his eyes and smiled. Then he turned his head in the direction of Harry’s voice.
“Alright.” Malfoy swallowed, flared his nostrils. Harry understood, more fully now, that he really didn’t know Draco Malfoy at all.  “Let’s go for a walk.”
“Is it?”
After a good couple minutes, Draco decides to close the door and Potter looks back at her. It seems to take her a second to focus on Draco, and then she looks over the rest of her, her lean frame, her muggle clothes.
“And you’re here now,” Ron chipped in after a moment. He slapped Harry on the shoulder lightly. It was more of a touch than a slap.
Hermione, to her credit, only widened her eyes a little as she took a sip from her beer. Ron, to his, didn’t
“But I uhhh.” Draco swirled the coffee at the bottom of his cup heatedly. “Fucking hate that Harry Potter is here. In the Himalayas. Where I am. Where I live. Where I lived
This chapter's song is not, as you might expect, Womaniser by Britney Spears. It is Babylon by Lady Gaga. Or The Edge of Glory. Probably Babylon.
The sun was hiding behind the clouds. Harry took the long walk up to the plaza with the temple, and ignoring the cold.
“Now?” Draco says faintly.
“Or bisexual,” Hermione adds, looking at Ron again.
“The second rule is that you don’t tell anyone about queer club,” said Oceania, in the same low voice.
Malfoy pushed himself up from his palm. His eyes were embers.
“Not really, no,” he blurted.
It wasn’t like meditating. There was silence, but the wrong kind.
“No,” whispered Malfoy. “You’re not.”
“I’m sorry,” he called out, and then Draco was turned back and strolling towards him. He was long and thin and brazen. He said, “You should be,” very matter of fact, and raised a provocative eyebrow. He didn’t stop walking once he had reached Harry. Harry’s breath caught.
Draco ‘s legs begin to shake, and she steps aside.
“How are your parents? Where’ve they gone?”
Hermione and Ron had been the only ones who ever found out. It was when he cut off all his hair, and they found him six hours later, sitting alone in a circle of his own black hair, that they had finally realised something wasn’t right.
“Come on,” says Malfoy, laughing breathlessly. “Did you really come here to argue with a dirty little Death Eater like me?” She grabs Harry’s hand and pulls her into the middle of the dance floor, ignoring her sharp intake of breath.
Harry frowned. “The one you do for your work.”
SweatyBetty is a real shop.
Or perhaps it was because Draco was there. Harry looked over at him, at the lines of sweat climbing his neck like veins. As he watched, he unrolled the cap on the water bottle and brought it his mouth. The shape of his neck rolled as he swallowed.
“Yes, Potter.” Malfoy was nodding quite seriously. “With little lace stockings. They have bows.”
“In general or in watch-talk?” she asked, holding it up, inexplicably, to the crappy light.
They ate in amiable silence for a while, and Harry kept glancing at the other person, trying to figure it out.
“Basically,” Malfoy had said, “Every second Thursday of the month –
“Are we?” she said breathlessly. “Oh, wow.”
“I think you’re honest. More honest than most people. More honest than me.”
“Do you want a drink?” asks Malfoy as she stalks down the hallway. “Or just a fuck?”
“Oh, god,” said Malfoy, screwing his eyes shut.
“Okay then,” he said quietly.
There was a damp spot near the bottom of Harry’s jumper. He stiffened, surprised.
“Harry.” Oceania leaned in close. “I’m saying that because you’re a virgin.”
It wasn’t that Harry had never done the mechanics of this before. But he had never felt it like this.
it, made Harry’s heart swell.
Harry was a little charmed.
Malfoy breathed in, and this it was less shuddery. Harry could see his eyes moving under his lids.
He was close now.
“It’s...” he said, and had to take a breath. “It’s just, um, hard to explain. It’s just…it’s the…I think of it as the blue.”
Harry looked up. Oceania was gesturing to the orange fruit in her hand.
Harry bit at his mouth and smiled.
“What?” says Harry.
all of this already – he still was.
Whatever Malfoy said next was muffled by more lasagne, which unfortunately reminded Harry of last week, when Malfoy had been trying to talk through the gag. He shifted in his seat.
“The camp’s really spread out,” Charlie said as they left the cafeteria area and began the ascending path up a small hill. “Needs to be, s’just the nature of dragon training. So the actual training sites are all around here.” He waved vaguely at the surrounding mountains, and Harry looked up, taking in the black and white of the peaks, the jagged edges that seemed to spread out endlessly before them.
His life became stagnant. Everything stopped growing.
“Well, that’s sorted.” Hayden leaned back and stretched. “Don’t argue with her. She’ll start telling you uncomfortable truths about yourself.”
“Harry,” she says, and when she looks up, Harry is staring at her, frowning, her eyes so confused. “Harry,” she says. “I can’t do it anymore.”
She comes to, panting, sweat clinging to her breasts and stomach and neck, and she watches as Harry pulls off her jeans and pants and begins to ride Draco’s thigh, thrusting onto the pale of her skin, and Draco can feel her, can
Harry felt his heart in his throat, behind his voice box, under his chin. He felt it in every bone behind his face.
Now, Draco reaches up to pinch her lip between her fingers, rubbing the flesh back and forth like her cotton pyjama top. Above her, the sky is blue – a distinct blue, like dragon eggs and forget-me-nots and rain-water. The clouds are whiter than the sheep coats.
“Uh. Cosy?”
Harry laughed, more because he was pleased than anything else. “Come on,” he said, gesturing with his hand. Jane blew air out of her nose loudly.
Harry let go of the sleeve. Malfoy glanced down and brought his now-freed hand up to his chest, massaging the elbow with his fingers.
reads the front in big, quirky lettering. Draco gives Harry a pointed look, and squeezes his hand.
Potter opens hers to keep going and then seems to catch herself, and frowns.
“Maybe.”
“We’ll get a ladder,” said Draco. “Obviously.”
Harry sat down. The smell of the prayer mats and the incense were so familiar that sometimes he even dreamed about them now.
“What did I say?” Draco murmured. He had to remember.
Luna tipped her head to the side. “Haven’t you always been?” she asked curiously. Blaise snickered.
“Harry!” Someone called out, and when he looked over he saw Seamus and Neville, waving him over. He glanced back at Malfoy, but he had already slid away into the crowd. Harry went.
It also reminded him of Hermione. It made his heart pang, in both directions.
She did what she had to do. She survived the war. She survived the trials. She survived it when they came for father, and she survived it when mother left, and she made a life for herself, she made a comfortable, easy, simple life.
Life was so strange. Harry leaned over to Malfoy.
You named her after a nineteenth-century classic.”
It stops raining. It doesn’t rain for the rest of the week, and Draco spends half of Thursday sitting under the shower, cold beads pelting into her hair, sluicing down her back, waiting under the water that isn’t green, or blue.
“Merlin,” said Harry.
Malfoy was looking at Harry curiously.
Oceania arrived with Pansy and Blaise.
“My name wasn’t Tom before I came here,” he said slowly. Each word was very carefully laid down. “Sometimes people can tell, still. I chose my name, Harry. It wasn’t a comfortable choice. But the truth was liberating.”
“Well?” she said. “Aren’t you going to take it?”
Draco stopped rolling his neck to look at him. His eyes were light, easy – amused wasn’t quite the right word, but it was close enough.
Malfoy looked at him then. His expression was equal parts fathoming and unfathomable.
Pansy put her hands on her hips. Besides her, Blaise was smirking and somehow leaning in mid-air, an already lit cigar in his right hand.
He was still smiling once the ink had dried. His heart was racing. He wasn’t going to send it.
“Don’t doubt me, babe,” he said, and then downed the rest.
“Alright,” said Harry, grinning, and he went to sleep.
,” said Harry, still chuckling.
He softened after a moment. “You really didn’t know?” It was tender in a way a parent was to a child. Harry could barely stand it.
Harry smirked down at the sheets. “Be careful,” he managed.
“Hey, Malfoy,” said Harry after a while, “How come you were never gay in Hogwarts?”
“And does your soul recognise Luna Lovegood’s?” asked Ron meaningfully.
“Harry,” said Malfoy, and his gaze dropped away. “Yes.”
“Stand up,” said Malfoy.
Osh just smiled. Harry loved that smile, and how wise she always seemed to him. “No,” she said simply.
Harry peered over at the tea. “Why is that pink?” he asked.
“When you were helping me with Jane,” said Harry.
God, he was so fucking grateful.
“We’re gay women, Harry, not gay men.”
“God,” said Malfoy, and ran his hands through his hair again. “
Still biting his lip, he went over to the table and got out a quill and some parchment. He stared at it forcefully for a few moments, before realising that it didn’t matter what he wrote, since he wasn’t going to send it.
He hadn’t told them. Today, he ran until stars sparked at his vision and he had to put his head between his knees to stop throwing up.
He took a moment to stop and just watch it all. Everything was so spread open, rich and lush in its muchness. The sight of the mountains, simultaneously huge and small beneath him, did strange things to Harry’s chest. This far up, they stopped looking like individual mountains and instead started looking like one continuous set of folds in the earth’s crust.
“Hmm?” Draco came closer, standing above him with one hand perched on his hip. “Know what?”
“Potter-“ she begins.
Harry hadn’t been out to enough pubs with people to know if this was customary behaviour or not. Knowing Luna, it was more likely that she just liked the olives.
“Urm,” said Draco, staring at Harry liked he was a bit thick. “I think you’re pronouncing it wrong.”
Delia nodded, looking thoughtful. “That makes sense.”
“You don’t,” he said, pushing the words out, “have to do things I like. Simply because…”
Oceania disappeared into the courtyard and Malfoy and Harry were left looking at each other.
“You’re up to something,” she gasps. “You hate muggles.”
“Right,” replied Malfoy, in his hoity toity-est voice. “And I just have an “appreciation” of cock. Perhaps that’s how I should have phrased it to my mother.
Or maybe it’s just the ink, or just the paper, or just a conversation, or the room to grow. After all, words are just words, and letters are just letters, and at the end of the day, it just depends on what you’re trying to say.
“I don’t have anything to do,” said Malfoy, and when Harry moved his gaze to his face, it was drawn down, like he was looking at the hipbone too.
“Look,” said Harry. He licked his lips. “We can talk about this later.”
“Oh god,” says Harry, from where she is lying naked on Malfoy’s bed, heart still racing from her last orgasm. “Really?”
And then she smiles.
He put the pyjamas on. The top was bit tight on him, and the trousers were too long. He stared at himself in the mirror for a few minutes, and tried very hard not to be overwhelmed.
“The Mac one.”
“Have you come here before?” asked Harry. Malfoy looked caught off guard.
?” Oceania had her conspiracy voice on. “
“Excuse me?”
He lowered his head to Malfoy’s shoulder. “If this was my cock, I’d get my come all over your face. I’d rub it into your red mouth. I’d get it in your eyelashes.”
“Harry,” she yawned. Then she blinked – and being clever, always so clever – took him in again. Adjusted her expression.
“Yes,” said Harry. “Would you mind if I kissed you now?”
“You forgot them?”
“He’s not just a dominatrix,” Bolson Torris, assistant manager of TV “journalism” channel Vise, was spitting at him. The toothpick that inhabited the left corner of his mouth wobbled dangerously for emphasis. “He’s a drag queen dominatrix.  She. Whatever. Make sure you hone in on that.”
At this, Malfoy abruptly upturned the vegetarian friendly bowl of water all over Harry’s head. Harry jumped and pushed at Malfoy’s hip, but the other man only stumbled back a few steps, grinning all the while at Harry’s drenched form.
Did keeping all that down, Harry wondered, do any damage to you?
Luna quirked her head to the side to regard him. “Why wouldn’t it be?” she asked, genuinely curious.
His heart swelled up. “I like the beanie,” he told him.
“What isn’t?” asked Harry.
“I know,” said Harry, because he did.
Potter doesn’t come that day.
“I tried really hard, you know,” Harry whispered. It was still dark out – but it had to be almost morning. They had fallen asleep on the sofa, still almost sitting up. Outside, he could hear birds singing.
“Is that right?” Malfoy is saying. “Isn’t that right, you moaning little bitch. You’re like a whore, a whore the way you’re taking it. I only have two fingers in – did you know?”
Malfoy pulled out a wide flat box instead and flipped open the lid. Inside were rows of coloured circles. Malfoy reached dipped his middle finger into the lightest one, that glittered a shade of orange-white when the light hit it right, and rubbed it back and forth. When he pulled back, his finger was covered in it. He reached for Harry, and then hesitated.
Harry’s skin felt very hot. “I met Draco Malfoy again,” he said, and he wasn’t quite sure why he was saying it, or if he should be.
“Can I come in?” says Harry.
The next day, Harry went for a run. He got his trainers and his water bottle and set off, at six in the morning. He decided to go down by the trees at the back of The Green Hotel.
Hayden was pulling out a lighter, flicking the end of it. “Surely you’ve done muggle drugs? It’s kinda like that, but better.” The lit theirs, and then handed it to Harry. “Ready?”
“I see,” said Malfoy. “Your boss wasn’t satisfied with our little shoot.”
“You look like a man with his mind made up,” she said softly.
“But did you fuck in that nice little pub at the bottom? There’s always one, you know.”
“Do you still feel the connection?” Draco asked after a while.
Out here, the grounds were so far out that they almost looked wild. The lake was something organic, pure and still and so pretty. He had stumbled upon it once during his walks and thought: here’s a lovely place to read. You could hardly see the Manor from here.
Jane huffed, more loudly. She shuffled on the ground in a way that looked a lot like annoyance to Harry.
They all came and looked. Charlie stood there, breathing heavily and looking quite proud.
“It works,” Oceania murmured.
“Oh,” he said. He didn’t move.
“Well, what’s the point of time if you can’t fill it?” pointed out Harry. Zambini smirked wider.
Harry’s hand came up to rub his back, slowly, slowly. It was warm through his shirt, and Harry turned his head then so he could nose at Draco’s neck, making soft hushing sounds. Draco’s face was red through his skin. He didn’t understand how Harry could be so easy about this, like it was obvious, like it could go unquestioned.
“Stacking mats? Slightly longer than I’ve been talking to the idiot blocking the doorway.”
“Yeah,” said Malfoy. “But that’s
“I mean,” he said. “I feel a bit like we misjudged them. Back in Hogwarts. Like, they’re still people, even if they were wrong.”
“A blind snail with a brick attached to it and a broken heart would approach faster than you,” said Draco.
“And Hayden transfigured the dining table.”
Harry went and sat down on the sofa that Draco had been sitting on before they’d got up. Draco took a great deal of time putting his tumbler down. Then he walked over, stopping before Harry.
“Tears don’t make it less gay.” says Ron solemnly.
Harry had always thought this. He didn’t know, until now, just how much he had always thought this.
Here he was, twenty-one years old. He had never thought he would even make it to twenty-one. In his head, it still sounded so old. But here he was, and even after all this time, he was still so naïve. And it was deep, furtive, and somehow
He was. Malfoy had been pink-cheeked before – but not like this. Now, Malfoy’s entire face had lit up like a stunning charm, his pale skin no match for the brilliant crimson of his embarrassment.
I really hope you enjoyed, and if you did, please drop a comment!! They encourage me to update faster and feel really good, so. I love them! I love you!
Then, at the bottom of the path, Draco stopped. Harry turned to look at him. He was smirking, and Harry’s gaze was hopelessly drawn to the dainty curl of the side of his lips.
He couldn’t see Malfoy. Maybe he was in the bathroom. He dug the edge of the glass further into his skull.
“No,” says Ron. “No, she doesn’t count, because Harry did not like her.”
Harry blinked. “Because,” he said after a moment. “The reviews are interesting.”
Pansy quirked a brow. “You don’t have to be artsy to appreciate art,” she said. “In fact, anyone should be able to appreciate it. It’s one of my staple features in anybody I spend my time with.”
“She’s a walking trophy. Don’t give me those congenial platitudes.” Malfoy knocked back another glass. “I could marry her right now.”
“What do you mean?”
“No,” said Draco.
“Hm.” Harry looked back up. Hayden was still watching him.
“I know how to cut my own food,” he said once Harry had leaned back, but there wasn’t any real bite to it. He piled up his fork and put it in his mouth. Harry watched him chew and swallow, waiting.
wheezed the bathroom.
“Please,” he said, and as he said it, he realised that he was all of a sudden crying.
“Here,” said Draco, and then he moved back, and Harry’s glasses were being placed carefully atop the frame of his face. He blinked, and everything came into sharp focus.
He was ready to just take a shower and collapse, but the blonde receptionist stopped him as he made for the stairs.
The dances had begun with cymbals. The masked dancers walked around and generally made a huge racket, which Harry secretly loved. So many religions he had encountered up to this point seemed to be about quietness and tidiness to him. This felt like a real celebration.
“I always took you for a romantic,” Draco drawled, just for something to do. Merlin, there was Harry Potter’s torso.
“And why should I do that?” Malfoy asked. His voice was almost wary. Harry shrugged.
“I suppose it’s just a bit…” Harry rubbed his jaw, reaching down to fiddle with the hem of the mat he was sitting on. “A bit useless, you know? Cus’ I’m not really very good at all this.”
“Yay!” Oceania leaped off the sofa and scurried off to the bedroom. “Let me put my socks on.”
If Jane had eyebrows, he swore she would have lifted one.
“Here.” Harry looked up as Malfoy handed him the water bottle. He was wiping his mouth with the back of his hand.
His empty, functional hotel room. He found that he was breathing quite hard.
Harry drank the coffee again. By now it was cool.
As he was washing his hands, he caught his reflection’s eye in the mirror. The man there was bloodshot, his brown skin tinged grey with the lighting and restlessness. His lips were visibly dry. His facial hair was growing out, giving him a bit of a stubbly beard. Harry had never really grown it out before. He rubbed his fingers over his jaw and decided not to shave.
“Luna.” Harry swallowed. “Hi. I just didn’t expect to see you here.”
It would have been easy not to follow through with it. Starting always seemed like a near impossible feat, and there was too much time, too much space at Harry’s disposal. It would have been easy to feel directionless, to let himself be an island in the midst of everything.
Now Draco looked at him properly. It was a look that completely undid the way he had looked at Harry when he was angry at him.
“Because,” said Harry, and had to think about it for a moment. “I…it keeps me up. I can’t stop thinking about it.”
Malfoy’s fingers hovered where they were about to close over the glass. “Shall we sit down?” he asked, glancing out towards the unlit living room.
Harry stepped out into the sun.
He didn’t understand why Harry couldn’t feel it too. Sometimes when Harry strode too close to things like this, he had to leave, and he felt like it always made him seem uncooperative. But the truth wasn’t that at all. He was water-logged with feeling, and sometimes it spilt right out.
“Oh,” said Harry, “Are you – going to go back?”
“That’s good,” said Draco, almost like he was speaking to himself. “You like that.”
Harry grinned. “Who’s to say crocodiles can’t smile?’
Malfoy’s eyes were wide and astonished. “No
“I am a woman,” says Harry, staring at the curve of Draco’s heel. “How could I think that?”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Never gonna understand slytherins, are we?” he mumbled, and raised a glass to that.
“So what?” Harry was laughing, but moaned on his next movement too. “So what, Draco?”
“Are you ready?” they said, looking at Malfoy, “You can come too, if you want, Harry.”
Harry pointed. “Did you make those?” They were distinctly hand-made.
“I’m sorry,” he said, still looking ahead. “I don’t think that you don’t like the truth.”
“Get fucked up,” said Harry. He felt himself give a wry smile.
“Harry, I –” he whispered, and Harry Potter kissed him.
He swallowed, breaking it off. Harry’s hands tightened in the coat. “Say it.”
Later, it turned out that Malfoy wanted to do yoga. They were on the plaza again, Harry watching as Malfoy pushed himself up into bridge posture, his back arching to form an effortless curve. He had attached a silver bracelet around his ankle, and the light danced off it, glinting this way and that.
Harry’s tongue is warm, and slips against Malfoy’s lips, heavy on the seam of her lower one, pressing and pushing into her mouth, and Malfoy feels herself inhale sharply, and Harry’s tongue just keeps on going, pressing, pushing against the inside of her cheek, against her teeth, the roof of her mouth – her own tongue, darting out to meet Harry’s, slipping and pressing and pushing against, and then Potter moans quietly, and presses the heel of her palm into the back of my Malfoy’s head, and pushes her head back slightly to kiss her deeper. Malfoy’s hand grips Potter’s shoulder, hanging on, and then Potter’s other hand slips down and rubs over Malfoy’s ass, squeezing through the jeans, and Malfoy gasps loudly, almost tugging away, but held in place by Harry’s hand, and Harry’s mouth, and the length of her reaching out over her – all that Harry Potter against her, touching her – and then Harry pushes off her own robes and puts both hands on Malfoy’s hips.
“I’ve just finished,” said Oceania. “It’s free now.”
Stupidly, idiotically, Harry lifted the hand with the Frappuccino and gave the most pathetic wave of his life. Perhaps, he thought, this was what dying felt like. In the back of his mind, he realised that he had started grinning some time ago.
“I am having sex with her, though.”
“What is?”
His heart skipped a bit again. He had
He closed his eyes.
“Notice what?” Hayden had appeared with a tall glass of water with what appeared to be pieces of frozen yam floating in it. Harry tried not to let his shoulders jump again.
Almost. He unrolled his mat. Stretched everything nicely out.
“Alright,” said Harry, “Draco, do you still want to teach me?”
“I’ll let you get back to –” He waved his hand vaguely, backing out towards the front door.
“Well, it’s not officially a gay club.” Malfoy licked at his lip again. “There’s a lot of straight people who come here too. But it’s also where all the gays come to hang out.”
Harry was watching Malfoy, the way he was leaning quietly against the tree, his expression too far away to accurately determine. Oceania’s hand came up to his shoulder.
Malfoy closed the door. Then he opened it. Then he closed it again.
Draco lolled his head to the side. He looked like he’d just been sleeping. “Won’t you come in?” he asked softly.
“Harry,” she said. “You have to concentrate.”
Malfoy smiled, despite himself. “Yes, Lovegood. I meant men.”
“You can,” said Harry. “You can touch me. I just want to be close.”
Draco squinted. “I think it’s more of a field.”
“They’re not for you,” Draco said. He had a knowing gleam in his eyes, as if he’d deliberately presented them the way he had in order to get a reaction from Harry.
“They’re not mine.”
He managed to collect himself a bit as he put Draco’s suitcase in the boot. When he had sat down and told the taxi driver his address he looked over and asked, “How was the flight?”
The song for this chapter is Pretty Boy by TAEMIN, which is absolutely Draco's theme song, so every time he enters a scene please feel free to go ahead and press play for the full Depressed Gay Dragon ExperienceTM. Also, thank you to everyone who has left comments thus far!! I go back and reread all of them when I feel sad, and also when I feel happy.
Harry grinned. Then he spotted the cleaning cloth in Draco’s hand. He frowned.
But his chin tipped at the last second and his mouth latched onto Harry’s neck. He felt the sensation of it before he registered what it was. The warm opening flesh, the jagged row of teeth. The pulling at his skin, the pulling of him in, the beckoning – the feeling of being wanted, of being wanted so much he was being taken in, he was being willingly enclosed around in the mouth, the mouth – it was a seduction, all of it. Harry tilted his head back and felt the seducing happen inside him, as easy as going to sleep.
He hummed. “No Goblin stuff, but will Elf do? I could have a look in the pantry. God knows what’s down there.”
He stood up. “Where are they?”
Malfoy was quiet. Harry frowned and tried again.
The first thing Harry did when he got back was make a cup of coffee.
“I know,” said Draco quickly, “I know.”
There was another silence. When Harry looked over again, Tom was looking out towards the mountains. The light skittered off his high nose, his square jaw, and Harry tried to imagine, even though he knew he couldn’t, what it must have been like to open yourself up like that.
Potter leans back onto the counter. She picks up a cup and looks at it, whistling. Draco shuts the door, and frowns.
Draco drinks her tea. She drinks all of it before Potter’s even a quarter through.
“Yes.” Harry swallowed. “You shouldn’t apologise if you meant them. If you…you should speak what you think. I wouldn’t want you to avoid telling me things because you didn’t want me to…to get angry or something.”
Oceania threw the purple mesh towards Malfoy. Malfoy winked at Harry, and then pulled his shirt off right there.
When they did it with the other leg, Oceania caught him looking.
were at an all-time high in terms of oddness.
“Ha ha.” Harry reached into her peppermint ball in retaliation. She let him, because she liked him back, really.
About an hour later Oceania leaned into Harry’s chest and fell asleep. When she woke up, she blinked into the dark haze that had now settled around the group. Someone had put lit a fire a while ago and it crackled now, flickering a vibrant red and orange between them.
Harry’s mouth opened and then closed.  “I thought…” he said, and then shook his head. He looked up. Hayden was watching him closely.
Harry swallowed. The kettle went off. He turned back and finished making the tea.
– Dr. Ernest Drake, Dragonology.
Harry shrugged. “Yeah,” he said, and cleaned his glasses on his jumper. All it really did was move the smudges on the lenses around, but this was just how Harry lived.
When he was in Scotland, he had loved running. Loved wasn’t the right word. He had needed it. There was something about it, about the pounding of the ground against the soles of his feet, about the ache in thighs and the sweat on his skin and the wheezing, suffocating feeling in his lungs that made things seem easier. He liked to run until it hurt, until the sweat bled into his eyes and his glasses fogged up and he sort of felt like maybe he was dying, except he couldn’t be, because he knew what that felt like. But there was strange sort of peace that came with it, this aching liberation, and it was only when he collapsed on the ground and felt the hole in his chest seal up a little that he could feel. Could feel it.
Maybe it was ridiculous – but the times he had done yoga so far helped him feel good. Although it was all physical, he thought that if he started with his body, it might be easier to deal with his mind.
“I don’t recall you being fond of petticoats.”
“We have a stable too,” said the receptionist drily, poking him in the shins with her broom. “You can sleep there, if you like. Thirty percent discount if you’re preggars.”
In his defence, the altitude was different here. All crazy. It wasn’t his fault he’d forgotten to breathe.
Harry had always thought that sunsets were the most beautiful thing nature had to offer, but this was good too.
Harry wriggled on the sofa. Draco watched him wriggle. “You know.”
“Oceania exists on another level to the rest of us,” Malfoy decided, to Harry’s right. “A better level. A purer one, perhaps. One where twerking in a tutu on a stage in a gay bar seems like simply a pleasant thing to do.”
Harry wrapped his arms around her and kissed her on the forehead. “I’m going to miss you too,” he told her, trying not to sound as fragile as he felt. “You’ve all been really – good to me.”
Harry looked up. “I’m going to get better,” he said quietly, and met her eyes. They were shining and wonderfully bright. She nodded.
“Ooh!” Oceania gasped. “Are you straight Harry?”
The books were not like the ones in Hayden’s house in any aspect other than their magnitude.  There were three entire bookshelves: but the shelves did not contain them. They were spilled across the entire room, on the floor and table and sofas, a cup overflowing.
“Yes,” he said. “Fine.”
“Yeah?”
He smirked, bright eyed and bushy tailed. To Harry he said, “Is that what you’re wearing?”
He didn’t look unhappy now. He didn’t look like anything Harry could have imagined.
He blinked. “Where did you get persimmons from?”
“He was the strangest of all,” blurted Harry, and it made her laugh.
“Wow,” said Harry. “You wouldn’t let me get away with that.”
“There’s no rules. S’just no rules. I keep expecting… I keep thinking. There’s got to be rules, you know? And there aren’t. There’s just… things. That happen. An’ they don’t make sense.”
Harry sat down. He looked her dead in the eye. “I am,” he told her.
“Yes, it is.” Malfoy lifted the cup to his thin lips and downed it in one, his throat working. His hands were trembling a little, Harry noticed.
His mind wasn’t here, so he was left with his body. He felt it twist and turn under her command, under his, and a landscape began to come together in his imagination. He felt the muscles in his back tense and give, the ache in his thighs and glutes, the small knot of pain particularly in between his shoulder blades. He had never been the type to really pay attention to his body before, so it was all new. Oceania got them to press back into downward dog, and he thought, madly, that he’d never really seen his knees before.
Malfoy flushed, from raspberry pink to strawberry, but didn’t back down. “Yes. And –” Here his voice turned familiarly sly. “There’s the other meaning.”
Malfoy was wearing floral leggings. Harry closed his eyes.
“Oh. Oh!” says Potter. “It’s very nice.”
“I’m sorry,” he said. “For how I acted when I first came here. I don’t want you to think that I’m…that I’m – some kind of homophobe.”
“Ah,” he said. “You’re…”
His words were muffled, but Harry heard them. He sat there for a beat. Then he pushed Malfoy off.
Harry suddenly couldn’t stand it. He dipped down, catching Draco’s cheek in his hand. Draco jumped.
“Well.” Malfoy gestured to the mirror on the adjacent wall. “Aren’t you going to take a look at yourself?”
“You do this every day?” he asked, shuffling forward onto his knees. Oceania stretched her arms, scratching her ear against her shoulder.
“Would you?” Harry shot back, and then looked away. His gaze unfocused, and the image of the letter rose up again. Then it refocused and fell on a floating light. It was only then that he really noticed Hayden’s house.
There were more prints in here, mostly of pin up girls. Over the fireplace was what looked like another Gene Bilbrew, this one showing a muscular man who was being restrained and  whipped. There were a lot of glossy black sculptures on the bookshelves to match the patent leather sofas. In the middle of the room was a coffee table carved to look like a man on all fours, and on top sat a vase of black orchids.
“I don’t know why you keep thinking I’m not,” he said.
Harry reaches over his shoulders and pulls off his shirt in one go. His brown skin gleams under the yellow sunlight, and his hair gets ruffled even messier. The bridge of his glasses is slipping down his nose.
There was a knitted rug with indecipherable patterning on it, as if the knitter couldn’t make up their mind about they wanted to depict. Also a sparkly glass light fixture. Also a gay flag hanging behind the bed. Also shelves for more books. Also a dressing table.
Did she think she was okay, making tea every morning, in the same cup, in the same kitchen, in the same cottage on the same island, boiling water in a pot? Did she really think that this was fine, that she could live like this – because she could, she could go through the rest of her pathetic existence making tea in a cottage and staring out of the window, comfortable, always staying dry when it rained – but did that ever mean it was
Harry shrugged. “I crochet.”
“Baby,” said Osh, and finally put a hand on his shoulder. Her eyes were glossy and reassuring. “You’re making this a thing.”
“Just…do whatever you think would suit,” he told him, already feeling like an idiot. What was he thinking? He didn’t look like Malfoy. Malfoy, who wasn’t a girl, but was certainly closer to it than Harry himself. Harry, with his broad shoulders and brown skin and thick brows. Harry, who was undoubtedly a man, from any angle.
He was finished with his yoga practice. The darkness of the night was being rapidly dissolved, eaten up with the inevitably of morning.
Oceania looked over at him and grinned. Then her eyes fell to his body, and she made an “O” with her forefinger and thumb and kissed the tip of it.
“I shouldn’t have…said some of the things I said. It wasn’t my place.”
“I didn’t know you could speak French.” He says.
“Unfortunately for you,” he said eventually, “I quite like it here.”
“You thought we were freaks at first,” he began.
“Oh my god,” he said, raising his voice. “You know the word chakra? Harry, do you, like, do yoga or something?”
Somehow, even Harry’s wrist was hot underneath Draco’s fingers. “You know,” he said, and let go. “The meditating.”
Inside of Draco.
“I’m a journalist,” she said, after a beat.
“Okay.”
“Harry,” says Draco, and her voice breaks.
He looked up at Draco, trying to project a general air of exasperation. The other man’s lips were curved up into a sharp line.
“Well,” said Malfoy, drawing the word out. “That’s new.”
Hayden raised a brow at him. “Well, we would make straight jokes too. If, you know, being straight was considered a punchline.”
Potter stops smiling and licks her upper lip. Her tongue is red.
Harry obligingly took a sip. It tasted like bananas. He wrinkled his nose.
He had thought that for a long time, if he was being honest with himself. How could something like that have been real? The Draco Malfoy in the loch didn’t seem like something that could co-exist with the Draco Malfoy in the floral leggings, the Draco Malfoy who wore make up, the Draco Malfoy who tipped his head to the sky when he laughed and made vulgar jokes about his own queerness.
Harry didn’t look away. He thought about rolling his eyes. Instead, he said what he’d been thinking for a while.
“Harry?” Charlie had started up again, his head raising from Oceania’s hair. “Come here.”
“Why do you say my name like that?” Draco snapped, and then instantly stopped rolling and straightened back up. The tense line of his back looked to Harry like the rigid stem of a flower in a rain storm.
So he chose Oceania. She did offer first, after all.
He went for a walk. Not a run. Around him, everything was fervent and green and in motion, but to him it all seemed very still somehow. He envied the way that the forest kept growing.
Oceania sat down next to him. When he opened his eyes, she was smiling, radiant. When Oceania smiled it was a natural thing too, a simple expression of complete happiness. Simple looked good on Oceania. When Oceania was happy, it was like she was giving you something, instead of taking.
He broke off.
“Eat this,” said Malfoy, “Trust me. It’s so much better high.”
“And illegal,” added Ron.
Harry was suddenly immensely grateful that she had asked him to come gardening with her today. She was right – it was better like this. It didn’t go away, but it was better. Became…less immediate.
“Honestly,” he said, “I don’t think it matters. I don’t think whether or not cows have feelings should affect how I treat them.”
“She just means that, mate, you’re still going to be depressed with the dragons.”
Malfoy lifted his head.
It felt more like they were taming him.
“Uh,” said Harry. “Sure.”
“Alright, you fucking beast, no need to throw a hissy fit. I’m only checking your goddam wing, I swear, you’d be entirely useless without me –”
“Anyway, it’s mostly about men,” says Draco says, taking another bite. “Everything is.”
“Can we just get started?”
Harry stopped, but it wasn’t very dramatically notable when you were in an art exhibition. “I thought he took it okay,” he said quietly.
His head dropped back down, and the sharp sound of glee was muffled by his sleeve. When he came back up, he reached out a hand and flicked at Harry’s knee.
Potter comes over and sits down on a sofa. She crosses her legs and clasps her hands on one knee. “Malfoy,” she says again, voice so low it almost scrapes the floor. “It’s been a while.”
“I think of you highly as well,” he got out in a rush, after he’d taken a moment. “You – I mean, well, I never really had any expectations for you in the first place –”
“Well,” says Harry, leaning his hip against an overused table. “I can't help it if my rugged tastes occasionally tend that way.”
“And these,” Malfoy dropped something dark after a long moment of eye-duelling, and Harry automatically reached out to catch it. It was a pair of leather jeans.
“Urm,” said Harry. “You should know that I can’t paint. Like, at all.”
“Alright,” said Harry. “You lost me a little, in the last half.”
They drank it on the sofa. Harry kept looking at the long line of Draco’s throat, and the places where the frayed collar of his jumper brushed against his skin. When he’d finished drinking, Draco put the tea cup down and said, “I’m not staying, you know.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but are you a writer?”
Her fingers were curled around his knuckles. He swallowed again.
“Hey!” Oceania threw down her knitted bag on the table, beaming down at them. “Look who I ran into!”
, “And out.”
Oceania blinked, and then she began to laugh. It was loud, real laugh, and it filled up the whole room. It made Harry blink and laugh too.
“What do you do when you want to control someone?”
.” Malfoy scowled – and there he was, the boy from Hogwarts Harry had once hated more than anything. When he thought about it nowadays, Harry mostly wondered if Malfoy had already started wearing dresses then. “I read the newspaper.”
“And the bisexuals,” Harry murmured. Malfoy raised a whetted brow.
Harry stopped teasing.
“I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but unless my eyes betray me, that is indeed a bow tie upon thy neck.”
Or possibly it was the yoga. Probably it was the yoga. Regardless, Harry was overcome with a deep, deep love for her.
Draco writing down the word “fucking” in his long, elegant handwriting delighted Harry to no end. As was usual for him, he was sitting down in the corner of his lounge in the comfiest crook of the sofa, next to the window. There was good lighting here – it was where he read all of Draco’s letters.
“We were just discussing plans for the Mani Rimdu festival. It’s coming up soon,” she explained.
“I love your spirituality,” said Hayden, smirking as they sat down, “Oceania, you keep me going.”
Draco stopped spreading marmalade on his toast and straightened up. “We’ve met.”
“Say something,” said Harry.
Malfoy lifted his chin, just a little. The light settled into the lift of his mouth and the dip underneath.
He reached out and put a careful hand on Malfoy’s back. The mesh was soft, and as they moved, he could feel the damp skin through the material’s gaps in places. Against the flesh beneath his thumb, and the pads of his middle and index finger.
“He’s very rich,” Malfoy assured him.
He bit down on his lip suddenly, staring out at the open doorway. That had been a stupid thing to say. He didn’t know why he’d said it.
Malfoy’s eyes found him, gibbous and bright. “You
None of those things happened, although they could have. Instead she kept watching him. A long, drawn-out moment passed where Harry felt the sweat gather under his armpits. He couldn’t look away.
Harry tilted his head to the side. He smiled a little. “Urm,” he said, not bothering to keep the confusion out of his tone. “Okay.”
Everything was a matter of time.
“Just try,” she said gently, “As far as you can. The first time is hardest.”
Was it possible to be simultaneously uncomfortable and comfortable in your own skin? Harry glanced over at Malfoy. He was leaning back against where the glass of the shower door curved out, the bag still clutched in one hand and his jaw tilted up. His eyes were liquid.
“Hi,” he said to Draco, strangely, nonsensically. He realised he was smiling, almost painfully. Dear god, every muscle in his body ached.
“But it’s nice,” said Harry. His heart was still racing in his chest.
“Oh, do you think?” said Hayden drily. “Well, maybe we should get two then.”
Charlie turned back to him. “She needs a name.”
Malfoy was arched over the sink, pressed dangerously close to the mirror. He had a black pencil in his hand. Harry said, “Did you buy her that shirt?”
he said, and a set of purple sparks were released. The metal band broke open.
“You get lonely?” asked Harry.
“Right,” he said faintly. “Of course you do. I’ve just got to the discovery of Bertha.”
“That’s
“Isn’t that why you came here?” She asked, and it echoed in Harry’s skull. “To feel safe?”
Malfoy blinked. Licked his lips. After a long moment, said: “I thought I was alone.”
Harry bit his lip. “Can I help?”
“She’ll come back,” said Charlie, sounding sure about it. “If the connection is good, she’ll come back. In her own time.”
Harry nodded once and then hesitated. “I don’t…” he said. “I’m not like Tom.”
“What else did you think of?” He asked, almost as a distraction.
He leaned in. “I want this,” he murmured lowly. “Do you want it too?”
“I…” he tried.
“Yup,” she said eventually around a mouthful of apple sauce, looking very pleased with herself. “You’ve never been to a gay bar.”
Hayden’s eyes flattened, and then they stood up and topped their cup up. Something about the line of their back looked disappointed, but maybe Harry was imagining it.
Draco wakes up, and she makes tea. She likes to make tea. It might be the best part of the day. She makes her tea, and she sits down by the window, and when all that’s done and it’s dark again, she gets ready for bed. There are too many bedrooms, but that’s okay. There are too many empty bottles labelled dreamless sleep on the bedside table, but that’s okay. There’s too much rain here, on this island, but that’s okay, it’s all okay, because the rain feeds the green outside the window, and the green reminds Draco of water, of flashing light, and of eyes.
Harry let go of the door handle and turned to face the room. His back was pressed up against the wood.
Jane huffed.
Malfoy raised his brows. “You know Victoria’s Secret?”
“Good, good,” said Gao, as if this was a perfectly acceptable answer. “And what brings you here today?”
“Then tell me,” he said, quite simply.
After, they sat there panting, very close together. Harry’s come was drying between them, and it had stopped raining. Draco seemed unable to move. His forehead was back on Harry’s shoulder, and Harry could hear him breathing.
“Thanks Osh,” Malfoy said dryly.
Harry couldn’t see his face. He wanted to, but he would have to pull back to do so. “If you knew I wouldn’t leave you alone once you told me, then why did you?”
He hadn’t understood it, so he had ignored it. He wondered what kind of person that made it him. Perhaps most of the wrong doings in the world could be explained away by that specific human flaw.
Harry inhaled. His skin felt hot. He pressed his cheek against the cold glass of the window, and felt that he could live in this moment forever.
After he moved to the Himalayas, it was like all he did was think. There was so much
How had he gotten there? Had he had a bad dream? Had he been running too?
“I don’t even have a tea pot,” said Harry desperately.
“I was going to go on a run.” Harry straightened up and brushed as his trousers. “I thought that you should come with me.”
“Yes.” Oceania blinked heavily, and then opened her eyes again. She was smiling knowingly, just a little.
“Really?” said Charlie, looking up from his noodles, “Like what?”
“Mm. Not really. Bit far out for most folk. We’ve got, what, six trained on camp right now? You’ll see.”
“I want to look at you,” Malfoy whispered, but he closed his eyes.
“Why are they heartbroken?” he managed.
“You work for a Muggle show.”
Harry supposed he deserved that. He inhaled, feeling his blood pound.
Hayden bit their lip and eyed Harry up, before taking pity on him. “It’s not really anything. Just –” They grinned quickly and tamped it back down. “We’ve got a lot of queers here, that’s all.”
“Oh,” said Oceania. “Okay. That’s fair.”
Bolson spat out the toothpick and tucked it behind his ear. “What did you say?”
“You have already hurt him,” Pansy continued, probably fully aware of what she was doing to him. “And you will continue to unless you think carefully about what the hell you’re doing.”
Pansy took a deep inhale of the whiskey. “Job is fine. Reading is boring. I wish I could say so in so many words, but Apple-Tits would have mine fucking cut off.”
“Not strange,” said Harry, fiddling with his fingers. “Just – I don’t know how.”
“Alright. You’re right, let’s talk about this.”
“It’s strange to describe love as a wound.”
“Come back to Scotland,” Harry told him.
Blaise was taking his time taking a sip of water.
“I felt like it,” said Harry, stuffed a roll into his mouth, chewing. “What did you think I was?”
“Hmm,” says Hermione, watching Harry choke on her butterbeer.
He didn’t know why he had done this. He could have kept quiet about it, and not gone around telling people about letters and feelings and real things, strange things,
“This is excellent news,” he declared frivolously, his cheeks pink. “Finally, our very own bisexual. I’ve been wanting to add one to my collection.”
There was nothing remotely easy, thought Harry later, about the basics of dragon training.
Harry let his back fall awkwardly into the space between his knees and behind him. The sun was shining hot on his face.
“Hello,” he said.
So now they were going bowling. Harry had never been bowling. Right now, he was in his hotel room with Oceania, helping her change the time on Charlie’s watch.
Harry let go, took a drink to cover himself. Malfoy was quiet beside him. The show was finishing, the blonde Queen doing her final soliloquy.
Besides, Harry thought, grinning to himself. The smirk
But at least she wasn’t setting him on fire. That was always a plus.
“Malfoy,” she says looking up, and then her eyes go rounder, and her brows drop lower. “Malfoy,” she says again. “Can I – come in?”
Draco raised his brows. He was really very good at that.
“Oh, I don’t know.” Malfoy held Harry’s gaze, his eyes bright. “I don’t have any specific ideas.”
He managed to catch his breath, wiping his hands over his face. And then, with his eyes still closed, chuckling, he whispered, “The coke is still two-fifty,” and lost it again.
“Probably.” He didn’t move. Malfoy was wearing earrings, he saw now. Little pearl things, the kind of earrings a real woman might wear to work, or dinner.
“What are you actually reading?” he asked again, once Malfoy had made it mostly through his own persimmon. Malfoy looked at him and held up his book, showing Harry the cover.
Harry was careful with his next words. He remembered the shade of red that had tinged Malfoy’s cheeks up on the mountain. “Where have you got to?” he asked.
He opened his eyes. His gaze ran along the trails of soil in front of him, embedded with grasses and twigs, clambering over to where Malfoy’s pale knuckles waited a few inches away.
Malfoy reached a hand out, brushing a finger along the bottom of one of the statues. His fingerprint came away with dust. “I was thinking you could show him your meditation, Tom,” he said. “You know, that thing you do.”
Malfoy turned around and his face whitened. And then he began to smirk.
He turned to Draco. Draco was staring at the broken chain, the empty space where Jane had just spontaneously disappeared. As Harry watched, he took a long, slow blink, and then turned to meet Harry’s gaze.
Malfoy swallowed. He had the kind of slim frame that made his Adam’s apple rather distinctive. He was wearing a new jumper today, a charcoal one that Harry hadn’t seen before.
“I’ll make you a firewhiskey sour,” he said finally. “If you like.”
“Be honest with me,” said Harry, and Draco was looking at him. His eyes were so fiercely green – maybe it was the backdrop here, Draco swore they hadn’t seemed so green when he was younger – and his skin was dark and warm-looking. There was that determined look about his brow that was so very characteristic of him. He had looked so much like this during the war. Draco had forgotten –
“Malfoy,” says Harry that night, twirling a lock of white hair between two fingers. They’re splayed across each other, the leftover lumos from Harry’s wand illuminating the sweat glistening over their skin. “Draco,”
“Tell me,” demands Draco. “Tell me you’ve never felt this way about a man.”
Besides, his teapot was fucking cute.
She does see Malfoy around. In fact, the next time she sees her is at another pub – a gay pub. Well. A lesbian pub.
“Malfoy.”
“No.” A pause. “You’re obsessive. Curious. I didn’t think you would have left me alone, had you known.”
Suddenly, the trees thinned and ended, and he was bursting out into a clearance. There was a small loch in front of him, almost too small to be a loch, the water rippling peacefully, black folding into itself, the moon shining above, the air, a hovering shade of blue –
“I know you’re a man, Draco.” Harry raised a brow at him as he began to walk out of the kitchen. His eyes were glinting. “Besides, I would’ve thought you were more progressive than that.”
Malfoy moved like most people moved, and it made his body move the way most dancing bodies moved. Which was to say, desirably.
“Oh,” said Harry. He sat down on a stool, rather heavily.
Pansy’s heavily lined eyes were searing. “No,” she said, very precisely. “You shouldn’t have.”
Hayden tilted their head to the side. There was something amused by the set of their mouth, Harry thought. He went over and leaned somewhat awkwardly against the counter.
“I don’t know,” said Zambini. “I haven’t read any of his stuff.”
“What?”
“Draco,” she says. “What’s wrong with you?”
Harry slowed down. “Do you not like running?”
“She’s good,” he said to Harry’s shoulder, earnest. “I thought the change could help.”
Harry shrugged ruefully. “Couldn’t sleep. I didn’t mean to disturb you.”
“Yeah, I think I’m about to throw up in my mouth actually,” said Malfoy, and abruptly collapsed. He groaned and rolled over. “Where’s the soup? Tell me you brought the soup.”
Malfoy bit his lip. It was the worst thing that had ever happened to Harry.
And Potter smiles underneath her, and lets go of her waist to clasp Draco Malfoy’s face and kiss her back.
Harry nodded.
He had moved closer. Someone bumped into Harry on his right side. The crowd had knitted itself around them, stretching and tightening in time with the rhythm. It was easy to move closer. Harry was struck by how much he wanted easy, for once.
“You can come back to yourself now, if you want,” Harry murmured. “Take your time.”
“How’s the training going?” asked Oceania.
“In,” said Harry, and he was right
too much, and he could hardly take what he had already. And then Draco Malfoy was leaving, and the length of his back was so pale, and
Tom smiled benignly at Malfoy. “Well,” he said, once Malfoy was done glaring, “You didn’t bring him just to meet me, did you?”
“Or is it just…a job?”
The loose stones ground under his feet as he walked. His mind felt fuzzy, occupied, like there wasn’t enough room left in it for himself. He swallowed and scratched at his head. The trees were looming.
well read.”
They’re all silent for a moment, taking long sips from their butterbeers.
He reached up and began to paint on top of Harry’s work. He had stopped shaking, but still smelt like coffee. As he painted, the cardigan he was wearing brushed against Harry’s shoulder.
He had had to leave. Staying would have killed him.
Harry swallowed and began to bend, feeling vaguely silly. Feeling more something else – curiosity? Surprise? Whatever it was, it was as faint and simple as the sun this morning.
“Why did you buy blue cheese?” He said, wrinkling his nose. Hayden levelled him a look.
He looked down again. Her eyes were open, and they were dark, but it was a good kind of dark. A dark that grounded you.
Hayden’s eyes went very wide. “What?”
They threw a party for him. Harry wasn’t sure how to feel about it.
Draco got off the chair. Then he picked up the beer and tipped half of it over himself, before nodding at Harry.
“Theoretically,” Harry added.
“Potter.” She says, running her fingertip over the salted rim of the glass nonchalantly. “Pleasant surprise.” Her voice is still that long, grating drawl.
“I suppose,” said Harry.
“Welcome to la gay paree,” Harry declares, his voice a half-whisper, and kisses Draco’s nose as he straightens them back up – and Draco wants to say something clever like, “You’re accent is criminal Potter,” or “You’re not even French,” but he’s just so, so simply and wonderfully happy, that there just isn’t any room for mind with all this heart.
“And what about you?” she says, taking Draco in her hands. Her voice is as warm as butterbeer. “Are you going anywhere?”

Thanks for reading :)
when you realise you’re not specia-”
He chucked one of the lubes at her. It missed, knocking over an empty coffee cup and landing securely in one of the dying office plants.
He didn’t know how.
“Oh, sure. Your friend stole your phone. God, you’d think it was like the global food shortage crisis, but instead…dick shortage.”
Harry’s leg wouldn’t extend. He looked over at Oceania and saw that her leg was completely straight, her forehead on her knee. He looked back at his bent knee. There was no way his body could do that.
“Yeah,” said Harry, distracted.
“Wow,” he said, drawing out the “ow.” “I see I really
They rocked against each other for a long minute before Hermione stood up again. “Just let me –” she said, and pulled at the hem of her sweater. “Go and get the sugar.”
“Why do you even have that on you?” he asked. “It’s not like you wear glasses.”
It was Harry’s turn to laugh. Finally, Malfoy turned to look at him.
“She’s a little feisty, that one.”
Draco dips his fingers briefly under the collar at the back of Harry's shirt, before straightening back up.
Harry raised a brow. “And the slytherin way is eating sushi?”
“What?”
“You bring other people?” Harry teased over the rim of his glass. “Do you use the same line and everything?”
“I’m not sure,” said Malfoy. His eyes, inexplicably, darted towards Harry.
Harry looked down at the diagram.
Harry hadn’t really known what to do with that, so he had just taken the vitamins Hermione had given him.
“You cannot tell me you saw that coming,” Ron bellowed from the bedroom. “ ‘Mione, you cannot tell me you actually predicted Harry –
Afterwards, Oceania got them to sit cross-legged and “bring their hands to their hearts.” Harry bent his head to his hands and then got up quickly. Malfoy was still on his mat, hands in prayer position. Harry started to roll up his mat.
“Bullshit,” he said. “I saw you teach all those kids in that D.A. crap. No one in slytherin could fucking keep up.”
Harry felt more aware of his body, of the way it moved. He let Draco take the lead – after all, he still knew more. He watched the arc of his body as he turned over into flipped dog; the gentle incline of his pale stomach, the sculpted jut as his hips pushed up. He watched and he followed. Felt it in himself.
“You kind of have to be,” said Oceania, “When you’re stuck on a mountain with four other mages.”
“You’re right.”
“You were enemies.” Delia took this in. “Are you sure?”
Malfoy sighed and stepped away. He bent down and rummaged through the backpack he’d brought. “Just put the trousers on,” he called over his shoulder, “You’re only amusing up to a point.”
“Hey,” he murmured.
Harry pushes down her bra and kisses the rise of her breast, the curve underneath, sucking the dusky nipples between her teeth. Malfoy is moaning so loud it could wake up the whole street.
There was a pregnant pause. Then Draco turned to her and broke out into a brilliant grin.
Draco sighed, and then he began to take off the coveralls casually. Harry knew he shouldn’t be looking – but he couldn’t help himself. The entirety of Draco’s long slim body was covered in green stains, but Harry didn’t know how that was possible.
Potter frowns and her eyes go unfocused for a moment. Then she blinks at Draco. “Right.” she says, and clears her throat. “Well, I’ll be going. Have a good day Malfoy.” she turns around and walks out the door, and down the stone path, away into the distance. The door swings open behind her, letting the sea breeze all into the room. Draco shuts it. It’s much bigger than the window.
Malfoy was singing along. Benjamin blew a kiss at the beefcake that was the bouncer.
“Oh.” Harry blinked at him, and then closed his eyes. It was incredibly disconcerting, not being able to see at all.
Malfoy shrugged and looked away.
Zambini turned back. He didn’t even bother to look surprised, the bastard. “
Harry grinned. Draco grinned back. They were both covered in dust and sweat and destroyed paperchains.
Harry blinked. He didn’t know why he had thought that.
“Right,” said Harry. And then because he couldn’t help it – “I’m sorry.”
Malfoy was staring at him again. He looked unmistakably defeated.
“Not Draco,” said Harry, too quickly. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw her smirk and then bite down on it.
“Uh,” said the girl, “Thanks. I guess.”
“It would be really helpful if you could tell me anything about him,” Potter continues, leaning forward, her eyes glistening as green as newly unfurled leaves. “If you could tell me anything at all.”
“It’s not,” said Harry. His face felt very tight. “It was wrong of me, to go like that. I – I should have got back to you.”
“Just,” he repeated softly, after a moment. Harry exhaled.
“Maybe,” says Draco eventually, her voice cool as she brushes her hair. “You’re just straight.”
“I mean, yeah, definitely,” she answered, looking way too cheerful, “Don’t let it put you off.”
Malfoy flicked his eyes heavenward, muttering. “Forget it.”
“You would,” said Malfoy. “You want to.”
“No,” said Harry. He watched as Malfoy popped the sweet into his mouth.
“Sorry for wanting to keep my figure,” Draco retorted. He was tapping his index and middle finger alternately against the top of the table in quick succession. “I need to keep this body trim. Trim and slim. Slim and trim.”
Harry gasps and arches her back into Malfoy, grasping onto the bonds so she can wrap her legs around her waist.
Luna wasn’t in sight when he entered the studio. The lights were white, and they beamed down onto a blond head that was facing away from Harry. Harry’s heart skipped a beat, the way it had when he had first discovered magic and the previously impossible had become possible.
“Urm,” said Harry. He was too thrown off to think properly. “I, urm…think he’s quite…okay.”
“And because they’re all ugly as shit,” continued Draco. “Could you imagine subjecting yourself to a lover who was entirely slimy and had weird sticky outy things?”
,  and it’s so so good.
“Are you okay?” asked Harry.
“Yes,” said Malfoy, and straightened up. “Yes. Alright. Alright. Yep. Osh-saving time. Yes.”
“Draco,” says Harry.
Oceania was quiet beside him. He set down the glass and looked at her. A piece of her hair was stuck down to her cheek, but she wasn’t wiping it off.
“What was that?” he asked, quite seriously.
Keep in motion, he thought to himself. Keep moving. That’s what Hermione had told him.
“What?”
at Malfoy – you watched him, the same way you watched a play or a movie. He was always, if nothing else, entertaining.
“Okay,” said Tom, once they were all settled. “Have you ever meditated before, Harry?”
“You’ve got mail,” she drawled, without looking up from her newspaper. Harry blinked.
“You’re a virgin?” asked Hayden, frowning over their spoonful of apple sauce.
“No,” he said, and swallowed again. “But…also yes.”
Harry stayed where he was.
“We’re not just here to peruse,” he announced. “Start filming.”
“Sshh,” said Oceania. She leaned in closer, and started humming, rotating the beads. “I am.”
“They have feelings, Osh,” said Hayden, eyes wide in earnest, “Feelings, okay?
Malfoy looks down.
“Oh,” they said, “You don’t want that. That’s last night’s dinner. Here, take some of my bao zi.”
Malfoy was still staring. As if Harry’s job was really the scandalous plot twist here.
“Thanks,” said Harry. He pinched a bao zi between his fingers.
“Cool,” said Tom, which struck Harry as weird for a monk (but what even was weird anymore? Weird stopped existing without a relative point of comparison) and beckoned for Harry to sit down. Harry startled.
He had to look away, just for a moment; just to catch his bearings. He knew Harry knew he cared, but he didn’t think that he really caught onto
“Collect souvenirs of your adventures. A volcanic rock here, a limpet shell there, a fridge magnet to top it all off. You must see some worldly sights. Whatever did happen with the men on Mount Earnest?”
“Do you like it long and slow?”
“You know,” Harry gestured to his legs. “Your – your ones with all the flowers and everything.”
“Where’s Oceania anyway?” Malfoy asked after a while. He glanced around the counter like she might be sitting on it.
to try,” he told him again, “You just have to decide. Decide to try.”
Harry pulls back after a couple moments and flops onto her back. Her hand wanders down, brushing Draco’s nipples, spanning her waist absentmindedly, as if the task doesn’t require her full attention. Draco arches her back.
“Harry,” she said happily. “Are you getting changed?”
There was a knock on the door. Harry rolled off the bed and went to open it. He hoped it wasn’t the receptionist – whose name he really ought to have learned by now – here to half-heartedly throw his duvet around under the pretence of ‘room service’. He wondered what on earth it was she did during the day. He wondered if there was anyone else running this hotel.
Draco opened his eyes. “I don’t suppose you have any Goblin distilled Cognac, do you?”
“Hmm?” She made a loop and threaded the needle through it with practiced ease. “What day?”
“Ta.” Malfoy’s waved a hand. “And maybe that’s because it’s a well-established fact that you hate me.”
Harry grumbled and let go of the tree. It wasn’t easy. He had liked the way it had supported all of his weight without berating him for getting drunk the night before a religious festival.
“Free isn’t quite the right word,” Harry went on. His voice was soft, almost indistinct in the small space. “But he made me feel…better. Healthy. Like…being in the sun.”
“I suppose it depends what you mean, Harry. Is it wrong to rely on other people entirely, to the point where your life revolves solely around them? I think so. But do people need other people? I think so, too. It’s part of being human, don’t you agree?”
“Don’t like girls, do you,” breathes Malfoy from above her, and she’s got her against the wall, got that long silvery body right where she wants it. “I hope you know I’m not hiding a dick underneath all this.”
“I normally spend the mornings with Mayo,” Draco told him. “You come here on your own?”
“I don’t want to escape myself,” said Harry.
“I fucking hate you, Potter. I hate you so goddamn much, I hate you I hate you I hate – ”
“Are you okay?” Malfoy was standing there, amongst the trees. He had phrased the words in his mouth very carefully. Harry could hear it in the way he had spoken. His fingers dug into the bark a little tighter, and he forced himself to breathe deeper.
He came back over. “Open up.”
“Did you want to have another session today?” asked Tom.
The smirk in Malfoy’s eyes dropped. A crease appeared between his brows.
He sat down, his back against the trunk. His trousers scraped against the shrubs and made little green smears across the material. He looked up and the sky was so blue beyond the trees, so blue, so blue and so far away.
Oceania looked at him for a long moment in that way of hers. “Harry,” she said eventually. “If you reached for him. He would meet you. Every time.”
“Urm,” said Harry. “Okay. When?”
To be fair, no one had asked for the knee and elbow pads, but, as Harry reasoned, the more leather he had on, the longer he could procrastinate taking it off. Maybe they’d get bored before he finished, or, possibly, an earthquake would occur.
Once of Oceania’s many gifts, Harry thought, was her ability to refrain from judgement. There was nothing condescending about the way she spoke. Maybe it was because she was so strange herself; or perhaps it was something else, something related more closely to kindness and decency and the kind of morals Harry had always half-heartedly wanted to adopt in the back of his head but somehow never got around to actually attaining himself. Whatever it was, it was why he had come to her.
“Yeah,” said Harry. “I know it’s not – well, I thought you just might want to know. Since it’s partly because of you.” He realised how that sounded.  “I mean, I’ve been thinking a lot about what you said.”
Draco laughed again, and then he looked at the Frappuccino. “Is that for me?” he asked.
Harry pointed. “That’s inappropriate.”
And then, there was Tom. Tom with his kind eyes and steady gaze, Tom with his temple and soft hands and strong thighs. Fuck, Draco had loved those thighs. The past was in the past, and he didn’t love Tom anymore (or ever?), but he had loved being sat up on those thighs, his back arched, neck tilted to the sky – for the first time in his life, getting something
So he told her. About the blue and the pain in his chest and the restlessness – and about the need to escape, that had taken him all the way to the Himalayas. And she nodded a lot and told him that his symptoms were normal and then asked, very calmly: “And tell me Harry, did you feel like you had escaped once you got to the Himalayas?”
“Sure,” Charlie was saying. “Yeah, take your time. S’not urgent.”
Harry raised his eyebrows.
So now Harry was at the pub with Luna Lovegood and Blaise Zambini.
“They’ll be worried about you.” Charlie’s voice was soft. “You know they worry about you.”
Harry swallowed. There were actually two plants in the office he noticed; one small succulent was sitting in a tiny pot on the grey cabinets stacked just behind Gao’s desk.
“I didn’t disturb you, did I?” Malfoy was being polite again – but that wasn’t quite it. There was something strange in his tone, a mixture of awkwardness and comfort, a flagrant familiarity that immediately had Harry feeling like he was outside of something. But perhaps it was just the temple – everything was intimate here.
He dreamt. In the dream, he was running, but it played in fast forward, and his mind sliced through the mass of forest and rock like it was butter. He was at the loch. Everything had been so colourful as he ran, but now he was here, it was like everything melted into the blue. He was looking down. This was what it came to; and it was always blue, always and always and always –
Ron stared at him. “Are you having me on?”
“And the hotel,” added Draco.
Malfoy took them to a sex shop.
“Potter,” says Draco.
Harry blinked, jerking back. Malfoy stared at him, and then seemed to realise he’d crossed some sort of line, and withdrew, dropping his gaze to the ground.
“Thank you,” said Malfoy, breaking the silence. He was still seated on the floor, looking up at Harry. The angle made his eyes seem bigger. Harry didn’t look at him long enough to read his expression.
“You know,” he said, after a moment. “We should bring a camera. Then Oceania can paint it.”
“Unless you’re Charlie,” Hayden pointed out, “And don’t need to communicate with people of your own species.”
Then he went mad with reading. All of Jane Austen. Pride and Prejudice on its own, at least four times (although he could never decide which of them was Darcy and which one Lizzie). A godforsaken amount of poetry. Sonnets, especially, until he decided the feeling was more lyrical. A lot of Walt Whitman (Merlin, the
Harry looked up at her. She was meeting his gaze.
“I don’t read books for their high morals,” he said, quite honestly, and Malfoy bit at his mouth.  Began to smile.
There was no escaping anything. He pressed the heels of his palms into his eyes and pushed. The tears ran down his wrists, trailing into his mouth. He felt the sob building up inside him, and bit down. It wrecked through him anyway.
Tom made another considering noise. Another few moments passed where he just rotated the beads. This wasn’t unusual. Harry watched at where the incense had burnt down to a few short inches in places.
“No.”
“Hmm?”
Malfoy was uncharacteristically quiet beside him. Harry glanced at him. His gaze was slanted down, the shadows under his eyes and the sharp cut of his jaw somehow more prominent in the fertile flaxen of the sunlight. The delicate skin of his eyelids reminded Harry of a “closed” sign in a shop door.
Harry switched on the two lamps windlessly, which he had thrifted with Luna in Greece. They flooded the room with a warm, orange glow, an almost obnoxious contrast to the spotlight over the island.
It was a long time before he left the loch. He went back to his hotel room. He looked at his suitcase for a long time, before re-packing it so everything fit. Then he went to sleep. It was a restless sleep, and he woke three hours later.
Potter shrugs. “You know how the economy can be.”
“He’s one of the monks,” said Hayden. “He’s the only wizard though, so that’s why he stays up here. But he visits the others regularly. Gives us good connections.”
“Well I certainly have sugertits,” said Draco as he hopped up to sit on the surface. He caught Harry’s eye and winked at him.
“It’s no matter,” said Malfoy. He got very polite when he was nervous. “Thank you for coming."
“Hah,” Harry said again. His eyes found Malfoy again, who was already looking at him.
Harry looked over his shoulder. The sun was catching his eyes, but it fucking always was. “Are you coming?”
“How’ve you been?” he asked when he came back, pushing one of the drinks across the table to her. Luna appeared to be thinking about it.
“It’s mould,” Draco was saying. “Mould. Literally mould in cheese. How could you want such a thing?”
“I’m in love with you,” said Malfoy.
Now Draco was really looking at him. His eyes were very clear. Harry felt like he could see everything inside him.
It took him a few moments to catch his breath. “Merlin,” he said. “Sorry, I…”
Harry thought of Malfoy’s eyes, of the afternoon sunlight flooding his fine, artisan features. They were inbred; too long, too narrow in places, the proportions just odd enough to push themselves outside the stark lines of conventional beauty. His lipstick made him even less conventional, the tiny heart of his red mouth making his eyes appear too big, like he was always surprised. He had looked surprised outside the shop, but it had been a surprise that had been carefully reigned in, held close until it stilled, staring and not moving.
“Fuck you.” Draco walks back into the room, but before he can bend over to retrieve his four body lotions, Harry leans over and curls an arm around his waist. Draco grabs his hair as the other boy rubs his face into Draco’s belly.
Pansy screwed up her nose, just a bit. “I wouldn’t call journalism writing,” she said. “Or if it is, I wouldn’t call what Blaise does
He was good. You couldn’t get that good without practising at all. Harry had seen him wear it often. He thought about Malfoy, up in wherever it was he lived, applying makeup like it was just another part of his morning routine. Like a girl.
Malfoy rolled his eyes. “Are you here to tame a dragon? Or to talk my ear off?”
“Give Jane the meat.”
Harry sucked in a breath. He thought, strangely, of the few swimming lessons he’d managed to get thrown into with Dudley, of the chlorine blue and the viscous water of the deep end churning under his peddling feet.
A brief scuffle ensued, in which Harry attempted to prise Malfoy’s fingers from his effulgent complexion and Malfoy succeeded in elbowing Harry in the ribs. Harry was laughing, and as they slid a few inches in the grass and Malfoy grabbed onto the ground for support, he glimpsed a neighbouring smile trying to tuck itself away in the corners of Malfoy’s mouth.
“Yeah,” said Malfoy. “So does a crocodile.”
Outside, they go and get ice cream and sit in silence in the green and gold park as ducks quack and children drip ice cream all over their chubby fists. Draco licks his 99p with raspberry sauce and two flake sticks solemnly.
Pansy blinked blankly at him. Then she looked down at her octopus, digging into it with her chopsticks.
“Different kind of balls,” Harry muttered, refusing to dignify Malfoy by looking over. In his peripheral vision, Malfoy raised a brow and lowered his head.
Malfoy blinked, and then softened fractionally.
“Don’t do that,” said Harry, and without thinking leveraged Malfoy’s face to keep looking at him. Malfoy’s eyes burned hot.
“That’s pretty cool,” he said after a moment.
But he sat back against the counter, and found that he enjoyed it anyway.
The brimming got worse. It solidified into a desire, an urge, a need so great he couldn’t ignore it. He was mad with wanting. He was mad with staying.
“Malfoy –” Harry began.
It turned out, when they got there, that their destination was not in fact a burlesque show, as Harry had reasonably assumed from Pansy’s outfit, and was instead an art exhibition. Harry did not understand why this had required him to change from a grey t-shirt and pyjama bottoms into all black, but there wasn’t much that he understood.
Pink blossomed in Draco’s cheeks. Harry hadn’t realised how much he’d missed it. Strange that it could feel like so long since Harry had had him pressed up against the island, on the edge of orgasm. Draco fumbled, fingers curling into Harry’s t-shirt. Harry pulled it off.
Malfoy was still bent over in disbelief. His eyebrows twitched incredulously.
“You didn’t know much of anything.” says Malfoy coolly. “Besides, I had long hair and wore red lipstick – you can’t be blamed.”
Malfoy’s gaze slid away from his face and down to Harry’s camera bag, clutched in his right hand.
“Fuck,” said Harry, inexplicably turned on by this. He grabbed the back of Draco’s neck, this time for support. Draco came up at the contact, leaned in close.
“From you?”
He grinned at the memory.
“Why Potter,” he drawled. “What secret depths lurk under the still waters of your tracksuit bottoms?”
Then he opened his eyes. Malfoy was indeed on his side. He couldn’t say the words to him, so instead he said them to the tops of the trees, just in his frame of vision.
Harry had first met the blue in Scotland. It had been a few months after the war.
The fucking turns into a routine. Harry turns up on that doorstep, over and over again during the course of the next few months – before breakfast, at lunchbreak, midnight, after drinks with Ron and Hermione – and every time is just as vicious. Sometimes Harry wonders if there’s something wrong with her, wrong with her for liking this – for enjoying the feel of hard wood crashing into her back, of finger nails ripping into her skin, for getting off on the nasty words the gush out of Malfoy’s mouth as they do it. They do it on the living room floor, on stairs, on the table, on the sofa, on a kitchen chair – sex is like a conversation with Malfoy. An argument, just like how it was back in school, except here each insult is a kick, a bite, a lick, a press and a gasp and a moan and it’s all sweat and skin – sex is a language, and Malfoy has a wide vocabulary.
Harry felt some of his playfulness drop. “I thought you weren’t mad at me anymore,” he said lowly, suddenly very aware of Oceania and Hayden watching.
“It's romantic.” Harry had said before they left.
He rolled onto his side, stared up at the fuzzy white of the moon, obscured through the cotton curtains. He’d tossed over so many times that no part of the sheets was still cold.
“What shirt? The vagitarian one?”
“I don’t hate you,” said Harry, when they were alone again.
“I am a queer,” Hayden clarified, “But I’m not gay, specifically.”
“What do you mean you didn’t get video footage?”
“You wield the truth like a sword, love,” he told her, and then plucked an olive from the pot.
“Fuck.” Harry let go first, his hands dropping to his knees. “Fucking hell.”
“Water,” he said eventually, and then nodded.
It was empty. Harry licked his lips, and then crossed the archway and went into the storeroom. He took one of the mats.
It was Harry’s turn to shuffle. The “For Dummies” copy jabbed uncomfortably into his ass. “Urm,” he said. “Not really.”
Malfoy looked at him. He blinked, pressed his lips together unconsciously. Kept looking at him.
“Did she?” Harry’s brows went up. He imagined her, a smaller Oceania, dressed in something ridiculous like neon tights and a dress made entirely out of laminated petrol station coupons, cutting everything else loose and hopping on a plane on her own, with nothing but her hair and her sketchbook. It made him smile.
Malfoy cracked the flogger against his palm. The smack rang through the small shop.
“I don’t dislike Blaise,” Harry admitted quietly. “Or Pansy. I…shouldn’t have said some of the things I did the other night.”
“What
“Don’t talk about my ass,” said Draco, but he blinked and got up there anyway.
His body was tenser than it had been for a while – perhaps because he hadn’t slept well. At three o’clock, he had opened his eyes and looked at the moon – it was almost full, almost old. Soon it would be new. Harry had stared at it as if it would swell to completion in the short time he was watching.
“Hibernating.” Benjamin picked up the Merlot and drank directly from it. Malfoy stole a stool from a table occupied by a couple who had gone out for a smoke. They both settled in and ordered more wine.
Harry didn’t know. “Draco,” he tried. Malfoy’s face shuttered.
He was wearing a stripy jumper and skinny jeans. He was also wearing a beanie. In Harry’s imagination, for some reason, he had been dressed completely different. In the blue jumper perhaps. Definitely still with the leggings. In real life, he was wearing a beanie. Harry had never seen him with a beanie before.
“The real question is,” said Hayden, “Is why on earth you would want to summon persimmons when you could have apples. Why, Osh? Why not apples?”
