“Yes, I’m sure now,” Ron says. “He’s not real. Hermione, can you please find a way to get our Harry back?”
Love you,
“What is?” Remus asks with a frown on his face.
Only Fawkes had another plan. He had landed next to us and was pushing Draco away from me. Draco fought it at first and then he was gone. Only his hand stayed entwined with mine. He said everything was going to be okay and I believed him. The pain was leaving me and I could open my eyes again. The world was coming back into focus and I could see Draco sitting next to me, a smile on his face. Fawkes had his head still on my arm and a pearly patch of tears was shining all around my wound, only there was no wound anymore. And then headmaster Dumbledore’s words came back to me, phoenix tears have healing powers. I wasn’t going to die. I was so happy that I leapt at Draco and found his lips again and this time I kissed him back with all my strength. We laughed and kissed and it was perfect. We were both going to be okay and Voldemort and the Basilisks were death.
Harry nods into James' chest and then slumps into the embrace. They are silent and listen to the noises that Neville and Lily make. They laugh and Harry looks up. Their faces and arms are covered in dirt and they seem to have fun. Harry wants to have fun again. If he only knew how. Why can’t he be more like Neville? He seems to take the fact that Ginny might never want him much better than Harry takes his rejection. “Do you know that Neville fancies Ginny?” Harry asks James.
Harry swallows and plays with the whisk. "Yeah, he's…" Harry wavers, the word that just popped into his head scares him. The last time Harry saw a depressed Draco was when Draco was fighting his potion addiction.
When James looks back at Harry, he knows he needs to say it. Not for his dad, or anyone else, but for himself. He knows this is him and that it’s never going to change. It’s time to stop hiding it and pretending he might one day fall for a girl.
“Don’t be so surprised, Mr Potter,” Mrs Prince says. “Mr Malfoy has been in this library almost daily for the last two years. It didn’t take long before I realised he can’t hear it when I speak to him. He never complains that I found another way to tell him it’s closing time.”
“Thank you,” Harry signs. “But I’m not ready for you to die.”
The door opens and Draco steps through it. He’s got some cups in his hands and puts them down in the sink. Harry sits up straight and his mum lets her arm drop. Lily gets up and continues packing away the leftovers. Draco sits down next to Harry and pulls his parchment and quill from his pocket.
“You will do what I tell you to,” Lucius shouts. He stands up and his lips tremble.
The air rushes past Harry as he pulls his wand out of his sleeve. He has no idea what kind of spell he should use. He tries Wingardium Leviosa, in the hope he can make himself float. Of course, it doesn’t work. Tears well up in Harry’s eyes. He doesn’t want to die. Not like this. Not when he’s just figured out that he wants Draco to be his boyfriend. That he wants to take him out on a proper date. And maybe even take him home to his parents.
“Promise me we’ll still be together after graduation,” Harry whispers in Draco’s ear as his hands roam over Draco’s sides.
Harry James Potter.
Dobby was excited to see us Said he’d been hoping to see us and that now we were visiting him. He is working at Hogwarts now, told us how Headmaster Dumbledore was kind enough to hire him and pay him for his services. Draco wanted to know all that Dobby had done since he was set free and Dobby told us all while we had some tea. It turns out that Dobby has only been at Hogwarts for a week. He’d been travelling the country for two years trying to find a job, but nobody would hire him because he wanted to get paid.
And the first so-called dangerous creatures he showed us were Cornish pixies. There is nothing dangerous about them, they’re just annoying. And they proved that when professor Lockhart set them free. They seized Neville and hong him on an iron chandelier until the chandelier gave way and Neville almost fell on top of Professor Lockhart, who had tried to stop the pixies from making a mess with some spell that did absolutely nothing. And worst of all, Hermione, Ron, Neville and I had to go and round them all up after class had already ended. It’s clear that the professor has no clue of what he’s doing. I just wished Hermione would see that as well, she just thinks he’s amazing.
Harry raises his wand and shouts Stupefy. Red light flies through the room. Pettigrew jumps out of the way and escapes the spell by inches. Draco looks up from his book. He pushes his chair back which falls to the floor with a loud bang. Pettigrew is on the move. He sprints to the table. He and Draco both reach for Draco’s wand at the same time.
“It’s Hermione, and I was reading that,” Hermione says.
“There is something else that I can tell you,” James says with a grin on his face. “Your mum and I decided you need some cheering up, so we don’t want you to wait until your birthday.”
And then Hermione gave us quite the scare. She screamed and almost dropped the milk. It turned out that Scabbers, Ron’s rat was hiding in the milk jug she just took from the cabinet. The rat looked dreadful. He was thinner than we’d ever seen it and it writhed in Hermione’s hands as though it was desperate to free himself.
Dobby turned towards Draco and gazed up at him and said: ‘Draco Malfoy freed Dobby! Draco Malfoy set Dobby free!’ Draco nodded at the elf, knelt down and embraced the smiling elf, telling him it was the least he could do. Dobby told Draco that he was a good man and that he was greater by far than Dobby knew. Then Dobby said his farewells and disappeared with a final loud crack.
Not that it’s romantic anymore. The test said that Draco is fertile at the moment, so they have to. It’s an automatic act by now. The liquid turns blue; let's have sex. The liquid stays red, no sex needed tonight. Draco doesn’t feel like it at all, but he wants Harry to believe they can still have a child. So he’ll pretend and play his role. And then, tomorrow he’ll cry, when Harry is off to work, knowing it was all for nothing again.
“Neville, translate because this will be too hard for me still,” Hermione says.
“And what if it still doesn’t happen? Are there any other options?” Harry asks. He still sounds so hopeful, so determent to make this happen. Draco doesn’t have that hope now that it’s clear that this is all his fault, just like he thought. He doesn’t believe there is anything left to say. He wants to go home and crawl back into his bed and forget this conversation ever happened. At least then he could still pretend that this wasn’t his fault. Now he knows for sure. Not that he will ever tell Harry. He can’t stand the thought of losing him too.
I’ll try to get some sleep now.
“He’s fine,” she tells James. “I’ll have the house-elves bring him some dinner and then he can go back to his dorm. No need for him to stay here all night. I’m sure his friends want to hear all about his fall from the sky.”
This must have been the worst Christmas holiday I’ve ever had. Even the silence and deep layer of snow on the grounds haven’t been able to cheer me up. It wasn’t like last year, when the Weasleys were here and I got to spend a lot of time with them, no this year I had to look over my shoulder all the time, making sure Nott or Crabbe left me alone. I feel that the only reason they stayed at the castle is to make my life a misery.
I took off the hat and walked towards the Slytherin table with shaking legs. Draco Malfoy, the nasty boy is in Slytherin. Most people at the Slytherin table were clapping, but Malfoy just looked at me with a piercing look. I set down next to Theo Nott, who was also sorted in Slytherin. Malfoy said I better start behaving like a real Slytherin if I wanted to survive my first year.
“We need to get Longbottom to the hospital wing,” Professor Snape says. Harry looks to the side and sees that Snape sits next to Neville. “It’s nothing serious, just a powerful Stunning Spell. He’ll have a nice headache for a couple of days.”
Malfoy reaches out and takes hold of Harry’s hands. He shakes his head and then let's go again.
“The bottles,” Harry stammers. He waves his hand towards the bathroom. He needs to know where Draco got them from. He will hunt the person down and murder them.
Andromeda holds up her hand and stops him. “It’s okay, Harry. You two need to take care of each other right now, and once you’re both up to it, you can start taking care of Teddy again. I’ve managed for three years before you two started to help out more than the occasional day. I think I’ll survive an extra weekend with Teddy.”
The ministry is almost empty when Harry steps into the hallway. It’s still early. Harry likes to arrive before everyone else. Before the reporters come in to try to get a glimpse of there saviour. And today Harry doesn’t need them at all. He needs to be focused on his task. If he gets sidetracked he will chicken out again.
Harry takes Draco’s hand in his. “I love you, and I think it’s what we both need this year. Just some time together,” he says, skipping over Teddy’s intrusion like it never happened.
“Please, I need to know,” Draco begs.
Draco taps Harry’s shoulder to make Harry look at him again. “Tell me,” Draco signs.
“You looking at her,” the man said. His hand pointed to the bones on the floor and Draco understood. The potion had killed her, leaving nothing but her bones behind.
“I can’t do this,” Harry says. He puts his quill down and stares out the window again.
“I think you’re right,” Remus says. “How are you feeling?” he signs.
When I woke up again I was in the hospital wing and headmaster Dumbledore was sitting next to my bed. I freaked out a little and told him that Quirrell had the stone. But he told me to relax and that everything was fine. I looked around then and saw that the table next to me was piled high with what looked like half the candy shop. The headmaster said they were tokens from my friends and admirers since the entire school seems to know what happened in the dungeons, even though it’s a complete secret.
Neville looks at Hermione with widened eyes. Harry’s belly flutters and his mouth falls open. “You’re learning signs?” he asks.
“Not everyone is doomed like you,” Neville says. He stops in front of another trap and checks it. It’s also empty. Neville places another charm in its place. One that will detect if something tries to pass the little hole in the castle wall. “You’re doing better, aren’t you?” he asks as he stands up.
And you will never believe what I found under my sheets. Neatly folded with a note on it saying: just in case. It was my invisibility cloak. I was so happy to have it back. That and the fact that Draco is talking to me again make everything just a little easier. We are still scared about Voldemort coming back and I’m still going crazy from all the studying, but Draco is helping me again. He also noticed that Nott was hitting me again and he now makes sure I’m never alone in the dormitory. We study together almost all the time. Hermione said she misses me, so I told Draco I’ll have to go study with her tomorrow. But for now, we are just hanging on Draco’s bed trying to remember the names of Jupiter’s moon and all the other stuff we need to know for our exams. They will start in two weeks, so I probably won’t write again until after.
This morning I sat by myself for breakfast before my classmates came down to the great hall. Afterwards, I tried to find my way to our first lesson. Everyone was whispering around me and trying to get a look at me. I don’t like it at all. It’s very annoying. It’s hard enough to find my way around the castle. There are so many staircases, tricky doors and fake doors. And I think they move around, just like the people in the portraits.
Draco was sure he could do it. He made his way to his father's dungeon and studied his notes all summer long. He would brew one of the fast killing potions to end Dumbledore’s life. The only thing to do was to find out how to make Dumbledore drink it.
I had a cold the beginning of October, that was quickly resolved because of Madam Pomfrey’s Pepperup Potion. It works instantly, only I had smoke coming from my ears for several hours afterwards. Hermione said it looked funny. Ron said Ginny also took some and that it looked like her whole head was on fire because of her vivid red hair. The rest of the month was kind of boring. It rained a lot and I went to my classes, did homework with Hermione in the library and tried not to think of how close Draco and Pansy seem to be these days.
“You’re talking gibberish with your hands,” Neville tells him.
Viktor nodded his head and then changed the subject. He told me that I was a really good flier, that he watched me during the first tasks, and that he would love to fly against me one day. I told him I saw him at the Quidditch World Cup and that I wasn’t near as good as him. He disagreed and we made a deal that after the last tasks we would find time to set up a little Quidditch match with some of his friends and my Quidditch playing friends. Miles and Adrian are all up for it and already started to think who they should put on the team. I think they even approached Fred and George to asks if they would be the beaters.
“To be honest, it means that we have no idea why you haven’t conceived again,” Burke answers.
Andromeda’s cottage is small, with just two bedrooms, a bathroom and an open living area. But it’s all they need, as Andromeda likes to put it. She’s in the kitchen, putting the final touches on a massive cake.
Love you,
Hermione wanted to talk to us about Rita Seeker. She had figured out how she got around the school and knew so much about everything. It turns out that Rita is an unregistered Animagus and can turn into a beetle. And Hermione had her captured in a jar. Hermione set her free when we got to London. She made Rita promise not to write another story for an entire year. If she does, Hermione will spill the beans on Rita.
Harry leans into his dad a little more. “I hate that he doesn’t know that I miss him,” he says.
Harry lays down next to Draco and rests his head on Draco’s chest. Draco twists his hand in Harry’s hair and plays with the strands.
Headmaster Dumbledore asked me if there was anything I wanted to tell him, and for a moment I thought about telling him about the voice I had heard saying it wanted to kill. But I remember that Hermione had said that hearing voices no one else can hear isn’t a good sign, so I decided not to tell him. And maybe I should have asked him if he knew if I was somehow related to Salazar Slytherin. Or told him that the children and even some professors at the school are consciously avoiding me, afraid I’ll go after them next. But I said that there was nothing and after that, I was allowed to leave.
“The Quidditch World Cup,” James and Harry say in unison.
The Sorting Hat sings a silly song. Harry doesn’t pay it much attention. “Do you think she will be in Gryffindor?” Neville asks.
I also need to tell you about our last lesson of Care of Magical Creatures before the holiday. Hagrid has shown us these funny little creatures named Nifflers. They have a flurry black fur and their paws look like spades. They are a big fan of things that sparkle. So they loved Daphne’s nails that she had painted with purple sparkling nail polish. And one almost bit Pansy when it went for her watch. We all had fun about that.
Remus has a point. Harry will admit that. But it’s all so unfair. Malfoy is smart. And nobody gets to see it. Just because his father doesn’t want him to be deaf.
“And you should tell your parents,” Remus says. “They would want to know that you’re out now. James was a big help when Sirius and I went public. He will want to support you with this.”
“I brought Chinese,” Harry says when he walks into the room, a white plastic bag in his hand, a smile on his face and an excited Teddy right behind him. Draco gets up from the sofa without returning the smile. He doesn’t say a word when he walks towards the kitchen, unsure if he can keep his composure. Harry stops him with a soft hand on his shoulder. He leans in and places a peck on Draco’s cheek. “Are you okay?” Harry asks.
“You ever going to do anything about that crush of yours?” Hermione asks from his side. She puts some ingredients in their potion. Harry has no idea what it is that they are brewing today. It’s hard to concentrate when Malfoy is around.
“Leave him,” Neville tells her.
And then we pulled into platform nine and three-quarters at King’s Cross Station. All our friends got off the train until it was just me and Draco left. He said he was going to miss me and then he kissed me on my cheek, just before he walked out of the compartment. I just sat there for a while. My hand went to my left cheek where Draco had just kissed it. What did it mean? It made my stomach flutter and my heart pound. Is that what it feels like when you love someone? I should have asked Hermione how she knows that she loves Ron back at school.
* * *
But back to the leaving feast. The only decoration in the hall were black drapes behind the teacher table. The headmaster's speech was also different from other years. He said a kind word about Cedric and we all raised our glass in his honour. And then the headmaster told the entire hall that Cedric was killed by Lord Voldemort. This caused some commotion among the students. Draco took my hand in his at that moment as a support, as lots of students looked my way, dying to ask me questions about what had happened and how I had gotten out alive.
“No clue.” Harry lifts his shoulders and takes the fabric from Hermione. It’s softer than the fabric of Harry’s robes, still new and shiny. Harry puts the fabric in his pocket and returns his focus to his breakfast. He’ll throw it away later, just like he’s done with all the other little tokens he’s received all summer for saving the world.
People in the castle are afraid. Everyone looks worried and tense all the time. Draco hates it that his father is responsible for getting rid of Dumbledore. That the headmaster might be crazy, but that he was not at fold for the attacks and that it had been stupid to sack him. I know Draco doesn’t really like the headmaster, and he hates going against his father, so hearing him say that his father had made a mistake for dismissing headmaster Dumbledore was a big thing.
The staring started after our fourth flying lesson. I was just spinning around on my broom, it was good fun. I teased Hermione a little, who still struggles to stay upright in the air. I don’t think she likes flying that much. She’s much better in charms and transfiguration. Oh and she’s brilliant when it comes to history of magic, she seems to know all the names and dates and she really is a big help with my essays. It’s a shame the others have started teasing her as well. It’s not as bad as with me, but they keep asking her if she likes being the poof’s girlfriend. And with the poof they mean me. And the Gryffindor’s aren’t much better. Ron just glares at her every time she knows the right answers in class or when she’s the first one to master a spell or charm. She’s the best in every class, except for potions, where Malfoy beats her every time.
We didn’t waste any time with showers that morning, or hair braiding, or breakfast. We pulled on the first clothes we could find and started to make our way out of the castle. Only to get stopped by Professor Snape. He took one look at the Firebolt and demanded to know where we had gotten it. We told him it was sent to me for Christmas. Snape took the Firebolt from me and examined it carefully from handle to twig-ends. He wanted to know from who it was and when we couldn’t tell him because there had been no card or message with it, Professor Snape decided to confiscate it so it could be checked for jinxes. He said something about Madam Hooch and Professor Flitwick stripping it down and I think my heart stopped right there. Draco uttered something and Snape just said it was necessary and that it would only take a couple of weeks. He was sure I would have the broom back in time for the next Quidditch match. And with that, he walked away with my beautiful new broom.
“Yes, that’s what happens when your co-parent decides to drop off your son at six in the morning without any warning. I’m glad Andromeda was willing to babysit. I love Astoria, she’s a great friend. And what she did for me after the war. Well, I owe her. But it would be nice if she would remember that I have a job.”
* * *
Draco lifts his shoulders. “Don’t know. Mother used to tell me how I would make toys fly back to me when my father had confiscated them. But I don’t think I was as in control of my magic as Teddy is.”
“Oh, isn’t it always,” James says. He smirks and Harry wants to hit him.
“You think he’s?” Neville asks from the side. Harry nods. Malfoy has to be. Harry doesn’t know why he never noticed before. There is a completely different reason why Malfoy never speaks. It’s not because the boy is a pure-blood git who thinks he’s better than everyone. He probably doesn’t have a clue what others have said and just doesn’t know what to answer. If Harry is right, Malfoy can’t hear a single sound around him.
Harry shakes his head. “There are more important things than Ron’s never-ending need to stuff food in his mouth,” he says.
“I prefer to just listen.” Harry turns his head and kisses Draco on the top of his head. Draco sits up straight and places his own hands on the piano.
Dear mom and dad,
“He doesn’t like me,” Draco signs when the others stare at him in disbelief.
And now all I have to do is wait for the 1
It was worst between Marcus and Wood, the captain of the Gryffindor team. They throw hexes at each other every time they saw each other. At one moment Wood treated to hurt me or Draco and ever since then Marcus made sure there were always people protection us. It made it hard to show up to classes on time.
I can’t believe it’s only two more nights before I go back to Hogwarts for my third year. It’s the first time since starting that I’m really looking forward to it. I just know it’s going to be a good year. Draco and I are dating and I will join the Quidditch team. I’m going to be an athlete. Who would ever think that? Dad, did you play Quidditch? I wish I knew or knew someone who could tell me. At least this last month of the summer holiday has been good. Mr and Mrs Tonks already promised me that they would chat with headmaster Dumbledore if there is a way for me to spend more of my holidays with them. Draco’s mom and they both agree it’s unhealthy for me to stay with the Dursleys for long periods of time.
“Okay, we’re off,” Harry pipes in. “Before Molly realises we were here from the start. I want to stay in her good books.”
“No, you wouldn’t,” James says. “But did it really have to be someone from Slytherin?”
“Shut up, Hermione,” Harry sneers. “We need to do this. And if you’re not going to help us, then stay out of it.”
I had to clean the kitchen and uncle Vernon promised to flay me when the Masons had left and I had hoped it wouldn’t get any worse than this, but it did. Only an owl came to deliver a letter from the improper use of magic office of the ministry of magic. It turned out that Mrs Mason is mortally afraid of birds and the Masons left, making uncle Vernon lose the deal he wanted to make with Mr Mason. Uncle Vernon then locked me in my room with a mad gleam dancing in his eyes. He laughed about that I was never going back to Hogwarts, and that I would get expelled if I would try to magic myself out of my room.
And now it’s morning, Draco has just finished his shower and we’re about to go down for some breakfast. I’m scared mom and dad. What if Voldemort is really coming back? Will he come after me?
The Dark Lord smiles. “That is good news,” he says. His eyes find Draco again. “There is only one thing that needs to be done before we can siege control. One more enemy that needs to be eliminated.”
Ron showed Scabbers to the witch at the counter while we looked at the owls. When he was busy a huge orange cat jumped on his head and then propelled itself, spitting madly, at Scabbers. Scabbers took off, fleeing out of the door and Ron and Neville chased after it. Hermione squealed and went to take a better look at the cat the witch had called Crookshanks. It was like she fell in love right there. Safe to say, she bought the cat and not an owl and of course that upset Ron. Ron called it a monster when they caught up with us again. And Hermione told him to shut up, said that Crookshanks was gorgeous. She was glowing and Draco and I had to suppress our laughter. Ron was replaced by a big orange cat that hates his rat.
It’s really cool to learn about magic, even though I’m not always that good at everything. Flying is the only thing that comes naturally and I really enjoy it. It’s a shame the lessons will end when Christmas break starts. I will miss sweeping through the air.
“He killed my parents,” Neville says. “He betrayed them.”
Love you both,
Midnight is still about two hours away, and Harry knows Draco won’t leave until after. It would be rude towards Blaise and Ginny he would say. But seeing him sitting by himself, inflicting physical pain to get through the evening, it breaks Harry’s heart. He can’t watch it any longer. He gets up and walks out of the room, to the kitchen to get himself another beer. Maybe it will be easier if he’s drunk.
“What do you mean?” Harry asks. “Why wouldn’t he?”
Neville fumes, but does sit down. “He’s here,” he says.
I’d also written a letter to Sirius about it all. He wasn’t very impressed with me, taking off with Viktor in the middle of the night. I had to return him a promise that I won’t go wandering around at night and that I make sure I keep myself safe. He told me again that my name didn’t get into the Goblet of Fire by accident and that the person responsible is on their last chance of attacking me. He told me to go and practice stunning and disarming spells. And maybe some hexes. His message was clear, focus on the third task and forget all the crazy business with Mr Crouch. He told me again to trust Dumbledore and Professor Moody, and asked me please to not break any more school rules and to keep myself safe.
“He betrayed all of us, Neville,” James says. His voice is small and Harry spots moisture in his eyes. Harry can’t look away from them. He’s never seen his father like this. He’s always the brave one, never scared of anything. But today, he looks frightened.
The toaster pings and Harry looks back at his stale bread. Now toasted and warm. He almost burns his fingers while he drops them on his plate. He picks up his knife and looks at the butter. The fancy stuff, not the cheap butter Harry prefers. A small reminder that he’s not supposed to be here alone.
Harry shows him the movement Draco came up with. Neville repeats it. “Similar to dragon, smart,” he says.
“We’re really sorry, Harry,” Ron says. “I should have been more careful with my words around my mother.”
“We’ll tell Uncle Remus,” Harry says. He’s still got Neville’s arm in his hand. “We’ll hand him the map so they can keep an eye on Pettigrew while the proper people get here to arrest him,” Harry says.
“No, I’ll be fine,” Draco tells them. He just needs to get out of here. It would have been better if the Aurors would come to arrest Draco. Then he wouldn’t have to face the Dark Lord in a couple of days and hope his occlumency holds up. Draco walks out of the Great Hall and lets his feet guide him up the stairs. One foot in front of the other. Silently. On his way to the spot that was once theirs. The place where he and Harry could share their hopes and fears. Where Draco could just be himself.
Harry closes his eyes as he pictures Draco cutting stems in at the kitchen counter, placing the flowers with care into the vase. Harry had watched him do that a million times and it never bored him. It was one of their routines that helped Harry to stay calm, to forget all the horrors they had gone through.
They left after a while, leaving me tied to the tree. I struggled to get lose, but nothing worked. My eyes were watery and that hurt, because the tears started to freeze a little. After a while I just let my head hang and hoped it would all be over soon. I must have passed out at some point because the next thing I know I woke up in the hospital wing with some warm blankets on top of me. Madam Pomfrey made me stay there for three whole days, only releasing me in time to go celebrate New Year’s Eve. Not that I had anyone to celebrate it with. I stayed up together with Myrtle, looking at the fireworks through her bathroom window.
“We have a quiz this afternoon in our common room,” Iris says. “So, I’m going to look up some facts about Hogwarts with Johanna this morning.”
“I’ve got you,” Harry whispers in Draco’s ear. “We’ll get through this, I promise. You are so strong and brave. I love you.”
“I couldn’t hold on to him. He slipped out of my hands, Harry. Greg should hate me. I should have held on longer,” Draco starts. “I killed Vincent. I was supposed to be his friend, and I killed him. Just as I killed our baby.”
I told Sirius what Hermione was up to and he wrote back to wish her good luck with trying to accomplish the impossible. I also wrote to him about Moody and his mistreatment of Draco. I know Sirius doesn’t really like the fact that Draco and I are together, but he said that I should tell him when Moody goes too far. And that he would write Moody to ask him to tone it down a little, to not think that my friends are the same as their parents. It’s nice to see Sirius look out for me and Draco. I’d never known how good it is to have an adult that will always be on my side, no matter what happens. So thank you for making him my godfather and making sure I’d have someone now that both of you are gone.
Draco is glad they are back on speaking terms. Apologising to her was the hardest thing Draco had to do when he was crawling out of his depression. He was sure he’d lost his best friend, only to discover that she hardly blamed him for anything. Draco was only in the house for five minutes before Pansy told him she wanted him to be the godfather of her little boy. And of course, Draco had accepted.
“You two are crazy,” Lily says and then she walks towards the house. “I’ll start dinner and try to forget that you two are useless.”
Harry doesn’t know how long it takes for Malfoy to calm down, and he doesn’t care either. He just holds Malfoy in his arms and lets him cry. It’s the least he can do for the boy now that Harry understands him a little better.
“Let them,” Harry says before he puts the last of his eggs into his mouth.
Harry looks over the lake and shrugs. “I can’t help it, Neville,” he says. “He’d made studying fun, somehow. And now it’s just painful.”
Before we got a chance to lift off, something happened to Neville. I think he lifted up too soon and he started rising higher and higher above the ground. Neville was as white as a ghost and started to slip off his broom. He fell down and broke his wrist. If Neville continues like this, he’ll be a regular at the hospital wing before the first month of school is over. Madam Hooch took him to the hospital wing and threatened us that we would be expelled if we would fly on our brooms.
“Fuck, you crazy idiot. What were you thinking going after the snitch like that? You could have died,” Adrian shouts. Draco doesn’t respond. He has no idea what to say. Everything is messed up right now. And it’s all so unfair. Harry was the good one. The person that would defeat the Dark Lord and make this world a better place. Draco should have been the one that fell, not Harry. Who will lay dead and broken on the ground by now.
It’s night when the Dark Lord comes to Draco’s rooms. Most of the Death Eaters have gone home, or wherever it is they go to spend the night. Draco puts down his book and strengthens the shields around his mind. The true battle is about to start. The Dark Lord doesn’t like to be kept in the dark. But there is no way that Draco will show him any of his precious memories about Harry. The Dark Lord won’t taint them with his hatred, Draco won’t let him. Harry was pure and good. He was the only person in this world who saw Draco for who he really is and loved him for it. And Draco won’t have anyone take that away from him.
A tear falls from Harry’s eye as he raises his wand. It’s the only way. Harry has tried everything else. Even two bottles of whiskey hadn’t been enough. It’s time to take drastic measures.
Hermione hugged me and then we both went our separate ways. Hermione up the west tower and me down to the dungeon. All my roommates were already asleep when I got there and I went to bed quickly. It wasn’t until the next morning that the Slytherins heard about the attack on Mrs Norris and that I had been in the middle of it all. I got asked if I had lost us any points and when I guaranteed them I hadn’t most of them let it go, except of course Nott and Crabbe. They keep joking that I will go after the Mudbloods next, me the great Harry Potter, the heir of Slytherin.
“Even if that means never having children of our own,” Harry says.
Ron kept talking, saying that all students will be sent home the next day and that the end of Hogwarts had come. He continued with saying that he couldn’t believe that the professors were just giving up. That nobody was going to try to find the Chamber and save Draco. It was wrong. So they had come looking for me, to go on a mission to find this Chamber and rescue Draco. I couldn’t believe what I was hearing. Ron, the boy that had dumped Hermione for hanging out with me, who had been sure I was pure evil for most of the year and who hated all things Malfoy had come looking for me so we could go safe Draco.
“I know, and I don’t care. It’s a new year, and I’ve got myself a job at Gringotts as a curse breaker.”
Harry laughs. ‘Hermione tries, but she’s a horrible teacher.’
“So you won’t be alone?” Harry signs.
And then Harry says Draco’s name. Draco has to swallow away a lump in his throat and then nods. He sits down in the chair next to Hermione’s bed and takes little Rose from her arms. Her eyes are brown, the same colour as Hermione. Some small tufts of red hair sit on her head, and she looks so peaceful. All sounds around Draco seem to disappear while he watches the tiny baby in his hands. Draco’s vision starts to blur, and he thinks his arms begin to shake. It isn’t until a large tear falls onto Rose and she gives a single cry that Draco notices he’s crying.
Love you,
Once everyone was in the hall we had to get in line in pairs and follow Professor McGonagall into the hall. We were supposed to sit at the top table and on our way there I longed to just be able to sit down with our friends. Greg, Daphne, Blaise, Luna, Ron and his date (I think Parvati is her name), Neville and Ginny, who all shared one of the smaller tables. But we had no other choice than to sit down with the other champions on the head table, who housed Headmaster Dumbledore, Madame Maxime, Karkaroff, Ludo Bagman and one of Ron’s older brothers. I was just glad that Draco and I could sit next to Hermione and Krum. It was fun getting to know Krum better. He told us that his school was also in a castle, but that it wasn’t as big as Hogwarts. Karkaroff wasn’t too happy with Viktor sharing all this information with us and told him to stop interacting with the disgrace of Hogwarts. Viktor shook his head and told us that he doesn’t care that Draco and I are a couple. He said we were very brave to be open about it. It turns out he’d never met anyone who is gay, that if anyone would be at his school they would get expelled as soon as they would act on it. After that, we turned the conversation towards Quidditch. Cedric, Cho and Roger all joined in and we had a great dinner together.
Harry blinks the last tears away, glad for the change of subject as he doesn’t want to think about how he’s hurt Draco by falling in love with him. “I still don’t get how she can get to all her classes,” he says.
This weekend we’ve spent a lot of time on guessing who will become the Champion for Hogwarts. I’ve heard that Cedric, the captain of the Hufflepuff Quidditch team is going to try for champion. Just like Adrian and Miles, our Quidditch teammates. But I think if it’s going to be a Slytherin champion it will be Warrington. He’s in seventh year, handsome and I think he has pretty good grades in all his classes. Professor Snape is fond of him and that is saying something.
“Oh, Ron, stop acting like a jealous bitch,” Hermione says.
Harry James Potter.
Oh, and something is up with Draco. He seems very disturbed about what happened to Mrs Norris. And that’s just weird because Draco hates cats. He has kept to himself all day, hiding away in his bed, writing in this little notebook he has. He even told Nott to get the hell away from him. I wish I knew what was going on with him. I hate seeing him like this. He looks paler than usual and he didn’t even bother to style his hair today. I think something is bothering him. But I’ll probably never learn what it is since mister “I pretend you don’t exist Harry” won’t speak to me.
“Where have you been?” Ron asks when Harry sits down next to him.
“I don’t want to die,” Potter said when the screams of the Mudblood had stopped. Aunt Bella had laughed and we’d had known, she was dead and gone.
Draco shakes his head, afraid to open his mouth and puke all over his husband. That will ruin this Saturday morning, and Draco doesn’t want this morning to be ruined.
Draco shakes his head. “A great friend he was. He is one of the Dark Lord’s followers.”
Harry raises his shoulders. He doesn’t care what Neville and Ron think about this all. Aren’t they curious about Malfoy? Why doesn’t he want any help? Did Harry do something to him, and is that why he doesn’t want to be seen with them? Is it because they are in Gryffindor and he’s a Slytherin? Harry just needs to know. He needs to find out why Malfoy’s grey eyes are like thunder clouds when he spots Harry looking at him.
The kitchen is next. Harry vanishes Draco’s favourite mugs, his special tea that helps him sleep. The plates Draco had made for them for their wedding. The pictures on the wall disappear, just like the pile of Muggle newspapers Draco liked to read. It all has to go. Harry doesn’t want to question a single thing in his home when he’s done. It needs to be Draco free. Everything he left behind needs to go.
Dear mom and dad,
“You still don’t have to, if you don’t want to,” James says. “You can take all the time you need.”
I also received a card from Greg. His family didn’t go on holiday, says they haven’t for years. Not since his brother died anyway. I still need to ask him about that and tell him I’m sorry. My trying to kill myself brought back a lot of nasty memories for him. He told me he’s been to visit Draco once this holiday and that Draco looks to be doing okay. He only talks about me all the time now I’m not around him. Greg begged me to tell him to stop obsessing about me so they can talk about Quidditch and stuff.
“Why not?” Harry asks.
“What, that you dragged me into a toy shop when you saw this hideous thing in the window. Or how I had to stop you from buying up the entire store,” Draco teases him.
In slow motion, he walks up the stairs. He turns into the bedroom and looks at the bed. The sheets are made of silk. Normal cotton wouldn’t do for Draco. Harry pulls them off the bed and throws them in the corner. He’ll get some simple cotton bedding this afternoon. Once that don’t remind him of the emptiness of the house. The emptiness in his heart.
“Well, maybe now you understand how your parents felt when you decided to trick around on a broom during a thunderstorm,” Madam Pomfrey says. And that is interesting. Harry doesn’t know about any almost-dead experiences his dad had because of Quidditch. He should ask about it one day. Now he has more important things to discuss with his dad.
Lily smiles at Harry. “He just got here. And we are a lot to take in. It’s busy and chaotic. His own home is probably quite different, as he’s an only child.”
When I was back at my own dormitory I had to take out the invisibility cloak and try it again. I still can’t believe it had been yours, dad. And it made me feel so free. I can go wherever I want with this cloak, hide from Nott, Crabbe and Goyle when they want to beat me up again. And Filch won’t be able to see me. I went out that night, wandering the dark corridors. And I know mom, I shouldn’t break the rules, but it was fun. First I just wandered and then it came to me. I could go to the restricted section in the library to see if I could find Flamel in one of the books there.
“Yeah, I get that,” Harry says. “Did you tell them to eat some chocolate?”
I was released from the hospital wing on a Wednesday when everyone was still in class. Professor Snape escorted me to the dormitory and told me I was expected to attend classes again the next day and that I should come to him if I was struggling with any of them because of my injuries.
Harry nods. “Yes, I’ve never seen him cast anything,” he says, glad his uncle knows what Harry was on about. “But I’ve seen him practising the movements of the charms we are working on. I think that’s why he doesn’t want to go to your classes. Because you always make us use magic.”
Well, things just got worse after that. Ron got a howler during breakfast from his mother with her screaming how disappointed she was in Ron and she didn’t forget to include my name in there somewhere. But the worse was that Mr Weasley is facing an inquiry at work because of us. That just makes me feel bad, they had been so nice and supportive of me during the summer.
“I thought you would be sad to have him be away so much,” Draco confesses.
Harry nods. It’s okay. As long as Draco doesn’t run again, it is fine. Sure he won’t run away again, won’t he? If only Harry knew why Draco rejected him before.
I like the idea that Malfoy sees it as a possibility for me to come to visit him during the summer break. I think it means we are really friends now. He’s sitting next to me on my bed now, working on an essay. He asked me what I write in this notebook if it was some sort of dairy. So I told him, that I write to you, and he thinks that is cool, and a bit sad. He said he was sorry that you are dead and that I don’t have any living relatives I can write to. He writes to his mother once a month, to tell her how he’s doing. And that the best part is receiving a letter back, which I never will.
The only downside was that sometimes people would look at us, see how close we were and that we were holding hands, and then would say nasty things. Sirius had warned me that not all wizards and witches are okay with people being bent, and I know that there are kids at school who also think its wrong, but it still hurts a little when they show their hatred of people like us.
Draco let the words and gestures comfort him. He still doesn’t believe he’s worth saving. He still thinks he doesn’t deserve Harry’s love. But he will try, he will see a mind healer, and he will give up on the idea that he needs to get pregnant to keep Harry. It’s not what keeps him with Draco. Harry stays for the same reason why Draco could never leave. Because he loves Harry, no matter what. And somehow, Draco will find a way to get back on his feet, now that he knows that Harry will always stay with him.
“I didn’t drool,” Harry says. He points a finger at Ginny and pinches her arm. “And I just came out, you’re not supposed to laugh at me.”
This Tuesday we went over to the family Tonks so we could take a very early Port-key to the Quidditch World Cup. Sirius had gotten tickets from the Ministry for his wrongful imprisonment. We were all very excited to go. We had six tickets and we went together with Draco, Tonks, Remus and Mr Tonks. Mrs Tonks made us an amazing dinner the night before and promised to wake us all up in time. It felt like she woke us up way too early. Draco was even cranky, and he’s the morning person of both of us. I was just glad she didn’t say anything about the fact that Draco hadn’t slept in the bed she made for him but instead had again crawled into mine.
Harry shakes his hands. He’s not an attention addict. And even if he is, that is not what this is about. It’s about Malfoy.
“Did they catch him?” Neville asks.
Monday 17 October 1994
What Draco didn’t know was that Moaning Myrtle had another friend, one she told all about Draco. Draco would only learn about that a year later when Potter and his friends would be dragged into the Manor.
And I need to tell you still why we hardly hang out with the other Gryffindors anymore. Well, it’s really simple. Hermione and Ron are fighting again. I don’t even know what’s about this time. But they don’t talk and avoid each other like the plague. So Ron and his friends don’t hang out with us anymore. Draco isn’t too worried about it. Said it’s easier when he doesn’t have to give Neville evil looks all the time because he’s staring at me. I don’t think Neville stares that much, but Draco is convinced that Neville has the hots for me. Blaise is a bit more disappointed by it all, he liked hanging out with Seamus. He says it’s one of the few people in this school he can gossip with about girls. And of course Greg was all bother by this and Blaise just told him it’s no fun with to talk girl with him because he can only talk of that one girl he likes.
“You can teach them to me,” Harry says. “Your traditions. I would love for you to explain them. And I might not understand it all, I will try. I’ll help you protect the wizarding way of life. If you promise me that you will also try to see that not everything muggle is bad or wrong.”
“I’m sorry, Oliver,” Harry shouts as he turns and starts to run. He can handle an upset Oliver. He can’t handle an angry father and a crying mother, because Harry didn’t stop Neville from getting himself killed.
Draco told me he was worried when I started to stare out of the window of the common room all the time we were there. He would take my hand and tell me we would find a way. Greg thought it was funny that I was obsessed with the lake all of a sudden until Draco told him to shut up if he wanted to live another day. This was around the time I also struggled to concentrate in class and stopped eating if it wasn’t for Draco pushing food on my plate during dinners. I also think I didn’t smile that much. This because Draco said he was glad to see me smiling again during our last Care of Magical creatures lesson. Hagrid had managed to capture two unicorn foals who were pure gold. Draco loves the animals and for the first time, he really enjoyed the lessons. These young unicorns don’t mind boys that much and Draco volunteered to pet them all by himself. It made me smile to see Draco enjoy the animals and forget his fear of magical creatures for a moment.
“Yeah, we really are.”
“He’s dead, mother,” Draco says as he sits up a little straighter. He reaches for his wand and closes the door. The silencing wards go up and then the wand drops to the floor. Draco watches it roll against the bedside table. The dark wood almost invisible on the wooden floor.
I promise I will write again soon and I’m sure everything will be better by than. It has to be. I hate school like this. I hate my life if it’s always going to be like this.
I’m sure you can guess what Bagman offered me again. His help. He wanted me to break the rules again. He said it was because he wanted a Hogwarts victory, so I told him to go offer Cedric his help. But Bagman said he had taken a liking to me because of my amazing flying when facing the dragon. I told him I was making good progress with the egg, even though at that point I still had no clue.
“Maybe,” Harry says. He hopes it will be. “You won’t mind if I fall in love with a Slytherin boy?”
Harry looks away from Draco and grins at his dad. “I was just going after the Snitch,” he says. “Not my fault the Dementors came too close.”
“Oh, and he will be proud. You’ve just made it into his inner circle. We always knew you would rise in the ranks quickly,” Greg says. The others laugh and Draco forces himself to laugh with them. His laugh sounds off, faked, but nobody seems to notice. Draco knows that if he wants to survive now he’ll have to pretend to still be on board with the Dark Lord’s plan. He’ll have to go back to being the good son, the proud heir of the Malfoy name, the in-crowd of the Dark Lord. All the things he slowly discovered weren’t the things he wanted to be. He would give anything to take back the last hour so he could go back to being insecure and compassionate. So he could still be proud of the fact that he competes with Hermione for the top of class position every year, not caring that she’s a Muggle-born. Draco’s mind drifts back to the day he told Harry how much respect he has for Hermione and her skills. Harry had been grinning at him for days afterwards. How nobody realised they had become friends and slowly turned into even more than that, is still a mystery to Draco. It must have been written on their faces these last couple of weeks. And mostly today, just before the game started. Draco hadn’t been able not to smile and search out Harry on the field. He wanted to kiss him again. Feel his lips connect with Harry’s and forget the entire world.
“Fine, I’ll go make breakfast. Strawberry pancakes with syrup?” Harry gets up and moves towards the kitchen.
Ron also has a younger sister, named Ginny. She seems to have a crush on me. Every time she sees me she turns red turns around and walks out of the room. Or she knocks things over whenever I enter a room. It’s kind of cute. Ron said she had been talking about me all summer. Fred is surprised she hasn’t asked for my autograph jet.
I couldn’t believe my ears. Draco had been the one to do all that. And he had let the entire school believe that it was me. Why hadn’t he ever said anything?
The lead investigator is brought in. They only searched the magical records. Shacklebolt orders them to look to the Muggle records. And when they come back they hold a piece of paper stating that Harry James Potter married Draco Lucius Malfoy twelve years, four months and six days ago. Three years after they ran from the magical world when they didn’t believe that Draco wasn’t a Death Eater. On the day they had been together for exactly six years. Eighteen years ago, when Harry hadn’t though and just reached out and kissed Draco. And all it had taken was Draco saying he didn’t believe that the Dark Lord was the great saviour everyone thought he was.
But first, he needs to finish this Potions essay while Draco is still around. Harry looks in his book again and reads the passage about Chizpurfle carapace. He doesn’t get why it’s so hard to open them and the way you should handle them, so Harry pats Draco on his shoulder. Draco looks up from his parchment and signs: “What’s wrong?”
“Fuck,” Neville says. Harry looks at the library on the map and his breathing stops. There is one other name in the library. He sits in his usual spot. A spot Harry used to share with him. Draco’s name is clear on the map. Harry can’t think. Draco is in danger.
Today we had our second flying lesson and I finally made it into the sky. When I kicked off and was floating in the sky, only a meter from the ground I knew I was going to love this. We aren’t allowed to go any higher yet, but I can’t wait to feel the air rush through my hair when I’m allowed to fly more. I’m sure I’ll be smiling just like Malfoy had when he was racing through the sky. It all feels so natural to be on a broom, to hover above the ground. I don’t think I need to get taught how to fly, it’s easy and wonderful. And maybe I’ll be able to prove myself to the other boy’s when I’m finally good at something. Maybe it will make them treat me as a person worthy of their time.
We had to undergo all kind of silly test the weekend after the task. Some people of the Ministry came to oversee them. And Sirius and Draco’s mom were there. I think that was the first time they’ve seen each other in years. They first didn’t know how to interact with each other. Draco’s mom was extremely polite, just like Draco was in the beginning with Sirius. I made Draco laugh. I love it when he laughs. He’s so beautiful, mom. I want to look at him for the rest of my life. And now that we know about our soul bond, I think I will. I know I will never love anyone the way I love him. And yes, I know we’re only fourteen. But there is no denying it anymore, we’re made for each other.
Harry pushes his hand through his hair and turns around. “I don’t need you to defend me,” he spits out as he stands up. “And Hermione, we are not all nerds like you. I don’t need top grades. I just need to get Acceptable to pass, and I will.”
Harry stares at his plate and the breakfast he dished himself. He doesn’t want to eat it. Only his stomach growls. Harry takes his knife and cuts into the sausages as the conversation around him continues.
“Yes, I think he is,” Harry says. “That’s why Neville came to get you. You can help him, can’t you?” Harry takes another look at the unconscious Malfoy. “He was upset when we ran into him. He attacked me and then just cried. I asked Hermione to get some parchment so he can explain what is wrong. I’m sure she will be back soon.”
Harry takes Draco’s hand in his as soon as they sit down in Burke’s office. Draco doesn’t look at him. He’s focused on healer Burke who sits down in front of them. She takes out their file and Draco looks down at it. Only Burke doesn’t open the file. She just places her hand’s on top of it and looks at Draco.
Harry thinks about it. What would it be like to never hear a single thing? Yes, sounds can be distracting. But then, there are sounds Harry wouldn’t want to live without. The sound of his mother’s singing is one of them.
“No,” Draco signs. “I wasn’t quick enough.”
Harry takes the necklace from the box and places it around Draco’s neck. “Just remember that I will never stop loving you,” Harry says, and then he kisses Draco. It’s sweet, and Draco wants Harry to stop because he doesn’t deserve this kind of love and kindness. And at the same time he never wants it to end, never wants his heart to break in a million piece when Harry finally leaves him.
“I know it’s stupid, okay. And impossible. And never going to happen. So you don’t have to worry about anything,” Harry snaps. He knew Ron would never understand.
Draco carefully points at his chest and then shows a thumbs up. “What’s going on?” he signs.
“She can, but doesn’t like it,” Harry signs back.
“You’re disgusting, Ron,” Hermione tells him.
A tear slides over Harry’s cheek. He can see Neville in the corner of his eye. He hasn’t moved since Harry spotted him on the floor. Harry’s chest is heavy and he opens his mouth to breathe, only air doesn’t seem to make it to his lungs. Why did he run to the library? He should have got help. Draco wasn’t in danger until Harry showed up. Pettigrew would have left him alone. And then maybe, Neville would still be alive now. And Draco’s wand wouldn’t be pointed towards Harry.
After some time, Harry helps Draco pull on his trousers, and they walk back out into the exam room. Draco sits back down on the exam table. Harry takes the space beside him. The healer sits in front of them and holds out some tissues.
When Draco finally made it back to the dormitory I was already in bed. I asked him why he had detention, but he didn’t want to tell me. I think the others had said something about me being a champion and with nobody there to stop Draco he most have finally lost it and attacked them. He’s been upset about it all for days now. And he snaps at people as soon as they open their mouth to say anything nasty about me.
Draco had promised to take me clothing shopping last summer, so I would look amazing all year long, and not only in winter when I could wear the sweater that I’ve now lost. I’m very happy that I’ve gotten a new sweater of Mrs Weasley this year with Christmas. I hadn’t expected it since I don’t hang out with Ron anymore. I’ve sent her a thank you note saying I’m very grateful. I never thought about sending Mr and Mrs Weasley any present. I should have, they took me in during the summer holiday and made me feel at home, even after they found out I was bent.
None of us spoke when we changed into our robes. I was glad when Draco sat down next to me on one of the benches and grabbed my hand. He looked paler than usual. And when Marcus told us it was time, Draco gave me a soft kiss before we left the locker rooms.
“But still, I don’t want her to think I’m not happy for them,” Draco says. He can’t help it. He feels guilty for not celebrating with them. No matter how much they understand, it’s wrong and impolite.
Hermione, Ron, Neville, Blaise, Draco and I all shared a compartment in the Hogwarts Express. We talked and laughed and eat so much candy. It was a lot of fun. Draco said he would ask his parents if we could have a birthday party for me at his house this summer and promised to owl all of us as soon as he had tricked them into saying yes. Blaise was off to Spain for the summer with his mother; Ron would stay home and enjoy the countryside with his brothers; Neville was going home to his gran and Hermione said she was going to help her parents in their dentist practice. She had to explain to the others what a dentist is. I was glad the conversation turned to muggle health care after that, so I didn’t have to tell them that I was going to spend my summer feeling miserable at my aunt and uncle’s place.
Harry turns so he can look at the Shrieking Shack. “No, I don’t think they ever considered that friends could do something like that,” he says. Wormtail used to join them on the nights Remus needed his friends. He was one of them. He was supposed to fight on their side and help keep Neville and Harry safe. Harry will never understand what could have made Pettigrew betray all his friends and side with Voldemort. Nothing is more important than friends and family.
But back to the maze. The TriWizard Cup will be placed in the centre of the maze and whoever gets there first will receive full marks. And of course, the maze will be filled with obstacles, like creatures and spells. Cedric is allowed to go in first, together with me, as we have the most points at this moment. Viktor will follow ten minutes later and finally, Fleur will be allowed to enter. I’ve told Hermione and Draco about the tasks and they’ve made this impressive list of jinxes, curses, spells and charms I should learn to get through the maze. I don’t think I can learn them all in time, but Draco is positive and keeps telling me that he’ll help me and will reward me for every spell I master. And I can say, I love the rewards he gives me late at night when our roommates are asleep.
‘I want to,’ Harry pens down. ‘The weekend after the game we can go out to the field and I’ll show you what it feels like to fly.’
Wednesday was a little better. I woke up early again and went outside to fly my broom a little. It was nice to fly, even though it makes me miss Draco even more than I already do. It’s weird to see his drapes open at night, his bed perfectly made up. I miss the sounds he makes at night. I even miss his crying. Isn’t that pathetic of me? He doesn’t want to do anything to do with me and I still miss him now that he’s not here. After I was done flying around I landed on the other side of the lake and just sat there looking at the frozen water. I don’t know how long I sat there, but I was freezing when I made my way back to the castle. When I got to the dungeon Nott and Crabbe were nowhere to be seen, so I changed a quick shower to warm up. That was a big mistake. They came back while I was under the shower and they stole my clothes and my towel from the bathroom and had to walk back to our dormitory naked. Pansy thought it was very funny. I don’t know what they did with my clothes, I haven’t gotten them back or found them anywhere and that makes me sad because it was the sweater Mrs Weasley had made for me last year. It was so comfy and Draco also liked it. He said it looked good on me. Probably because it was one of the only clothes I possess that fit me. All my other clothes are old clothes of Dudley and they are too big for me.
Thursday was okay. We only had three classes, because flying lessons will only start in two weeks. First, we had charms and I partnered with Hermione. She’s really good and made her feather fly. Next, we had Transfiguration with Professor McGonagall. She’s very strict and I think Malfoy is afraid to pull anything in her class. After lunch, we had Defence against the dark arts and again we didn’t really learn anything. Hermione and I finished our homework quickly in the library and went for a walk around the lake afterwards. She told me about her parents, they are dentists, and about how surprised she was when she got her letter for Hogwarts. She said she was sorry that my parents are dead and asked me where I lived. I told her I lived with my aunt and uncle, but I didn’t tell her they bullied me just as much as Malfoy and Nott. It was a fun afternoon.
Another week went by without Hagrid. Hermione and I even got into a small fight because of it all. She said something about how good the Care for Magical Creatures lessons are now and I just lost it. Draco tells me I should control my anger better, that it’s not Hermione’s fault and that I shouldn’t blame her. And I know he’s right, so the next day I apologised to Hermione. She also said that she should have been more considered and all is good between us again.
“Don’t think that will stop them,” Harry says. “Lavender is still trying to hit on me, even now, when she knows I’m gay.”
“But he killed” Neville starts. Tears fall from his eyes as he takes in some quick breaths.
“Because it’s my birthday,” Teddy tells Draco. “I’m four now, and on Monday I’m going to school together with uncle Harry.”
Hermione laughs and leans against Harry for a moment. “You won’t,” she says. Harry feels she’s holding something back, but that’s fine. It’s not like Hermione is going to tell Ron she likes him. She’s chickened out a million times already, and she will do the same now.
We both got new ropes at Madam Malkin’s, standing next to each other while she fitted us. We had to laugh about how that is where we first met and how we both got the wrong idea about who the other is. Draco’s mom made sure that I got the same quality robes as Draco, they are way better than the ones I had last year. Not itchy at all. Draco’s mom also ordered some basic clothes for me at Madam Malkin’s, and she promised to send them to Hogwarts as soon as they are finished. Draco says I’m finally going to look sharp.
“Why did you excepted all the tokens if you didn’t want them?” Zabini asks.
“Sorry, I shouldn’t have brought up the Hogsmeade weekends,” Neville says.
“I don’t want to kiss you,” Harry almost shouts. The idea is insane. Ron and Hermione are like his brother and sister. He has no intention of ever kissing any one of them.
“Maybe, but I won’t let you live if you hurt any of them,” Neville says. “And you know you can’t win. You’ll have to choose. Kill me, or kill Draco? You won’t have time to kill us both.”
“He’s deaf,” Neville says.
“You have your own sweaters,” Harry once complained.
“Oh, that’s okay, Molly. I was wondering if you had made any lemonade. I would love two glasses if so,” Draco says.
Professor Lupin his limbs began to shake and Black and Snape told us to run towards the castle. Only I couldn’t, because Lupin was chained to Pettigrew, just as Draco. Draco would be stuck with a werewolf and I couldn’t leave him alone. I pushed Ron in Neville’s arms and I think they both made it to the castle alright. I didn’t see them again till the next morning. I watched as Lupin shifted into a werewolf. Black also transformed into his dog form and as soon as Lupin got free from the chain that linked him to Pettigrew, Black seized him around the neck and pulled Lupin away from us. Lupin’s wand had fallen to the ground, both Snape and Draco reached for it, but Pettigrew was faster. There was a loud bang and the next thing I know was that Draco was on the ground, his eyes closed and not moving. I believe I screamed like a little girl if I’m to believe professor Snape. Hermione won’t confirm or deny it, so I’m afraid it’s probably true.
“The git thinks he’s funny, remembering me off all the awful encounters I had with him,” Harry says. He walks out of the library and back towards the great hall. When he gets there he walks straight to Malfoy who is still sipping his tea. His eyes widen when Harry stops right in front of him.
I’m also a little scared because Nott, Crabbe and Pansy are staying here for Christmas. What if they decided to go after me? I know they think I’m some dark lord that has released a dangers monster on the school. But I’m sure they remember how easy it was to almost hex and beat me to death last year. What if the fear of me being a dark lord doesn’t stop them and I end up in the hospital wing again? Or worse, death? Well, I don’t really think that will be worse. Nothing can be worse than this, being avoided and looked at with fear. I’m tired of people skirting around me in the corridors and all the muttering, pointing and hissing as I pass. I’m tired of it all, I just want to be with you, mom and dad. I just want to be somewhere where I can be happy and don’t feel so alone all the time.
“You will. Now you can find someone who can give you the family you always wanted.”
Harry laughs. “Of course you would. It’s a bit much, isn’t it.”
‘He was your friend,’ Harry writes.
“Uncle Draco, how many presents did you bring?” Teddy shouts as Harry puts him down. Andromeda laughs next to Draco and gives him a quick kiss on the cheek before she lets go of him and continues with the birthday cake.
“I’ll go back to classes tomorrow,” Harry says. “And I’ll write mum and dad today, I promise. But now, I want to be alone.”
Your Harry James Potter.
“I’ll tell Pansy you're not feeling well. Not that she will believe me. You haven’t spoken to her in months. She’s your best friend, for Merlin’s sake. You can’t ignore her forever.” Harry gets up and grabs his jacket.
Draco was the one that made it better. And the idea that the next time Harry breaks down he won’t be here to help Harry pick up the pieces is paralysing.
“It’s okay,” Draco signs. “Dobby hated being at our house. He’s free. He always wanted to be free. I just miss him. He was my only friend at home.”
“I don’t care,” Neville says. “You don’t know what it’s like. I have to. I can’t just let him run free. He…” Neville swallows. Harry reaches out and takes Neville’s hand in his.
Harry and Neville grin at Ron and a plan starts to form. Together they go over the different spells and traps they can set for Pettigrew. They will find the idiot before the exams start. And then they will be the heroes of the school. And everyone will forget about Harry being gay and his misfortune with Draco. Everything will get back to normal once they capture Pettigrew.
Saturday 1 Augustus 1992
Dear mom and dad,
The words make no sense. Draco closes his eyes and tries to push away the tears. Harry’s hand squeezes his. Draco can’t look at him. He can’t look anywhere.
“Forget about him,” Ron says. “He’s in Slytherin. I’m sure his housemates will look after him.” Ron looks at the doors and then at the empty plates in front of them. “Do you think it will be long before the first years are here? I’m hungry.”
Would Harry be disappointed in Draco? Draco should have never lied about what happened in the sky that day. He should have shown his tears and pain for the entire world to see. But instead, Draco took the cowards way out, and let everyone believe he killed Harry on purpose. He made sure he stayed alive. But for what? To live a life of misery? To watch his mother suffer for every little mistake he will make. Each time he will anger the Dark Lord. The Dark Lord had noticed how the torture of Narcissa had shut Draco up, had put him back into his place. He won’t forget that. He will use it whenever he deems it necessary to teach Draco a lesson.
Harry smacks Neville on the back of his head. “Are you insane,” he says. “Just because he’s in Slytherin doesn’t make him evil incarnate.”
‘Did we lose?’ Harry writes after some time of silence.
“You’re staying here?” Hermione asks. Neville signs the words before Draco has to turn to Harry again.
After they lay on the floor in the living room, their hands linked and one of the blankets that never leaves the sofa on top of them to make sure they stay warm.
When Draco and his father had left and Mr Borgin had returned to the back room I slipped out of the cabinet and the shop. I had ended up in an alleyway that seemed to be made up entirely of shops devoted to the Dark Arts. And people were staring at me. It was creepy, so I started off in hopefully the right direction. I just wanted to get out of the alley and find Draco, hopefully without his father, so I could talk to him.
* * *
“That’s his name, isn’t it? What was the sign again?” Neville asks.
He walks to his fireplace and takes a hand of flu powder. He takes a deep breath and then steps into the green flames.
I can tell you that there is no way anyone is ever going to control me by the Imperius Curse. Professor Moody put it on me four times during lessons to show others how to fight it. It was really weird, being under the Imperius Curse. It was like all my worries and thoughts floated away and left in place a vague, untraceable happiness. I wasn’t really aware anymore of the people around me and then Moody told me to jump on a desk. And I just thought that was stupid, why would I jump on a desk? There was no reason for it. So I kind of jumped and tried to stop from jumping at the same time and smashed headlong into the desk. I could feel it in my knees for the rest of that day.
After dinner, it was time for the first dance and when Headmaster Dumbledore moved all the tables to the sides of the room I got nervous. Draco took my hand and whispered in my ear that all will be fine, that I just had to follow his lead. And that is what I did, I let Draco guide me over the dance floor and just focused only on him. Blaise later told us we looked amazing and so in love that it was disgusting. Daphne and Luna both told him to shut up, saying it was the cutest thing they’ve ever seen. I didn’t even realise when the first song had ended and others had come onto the dance floor. I was just enjoying myself in Draco’s arms. At some point, Professor Snape passed us and muttered the word distance. We both laughed and took a small step apart. Somehow during our dancing, we had moved closer to each other and were getting a bit to close apparently.
“Would you say that this was a wedding ring?” Shacklebolt asks.
When Lucius reaches them, he doesn’t greet any of them. He just grabs Draco by his arm and starts to pull him away. Draco looks at Harry and he lifts his free hand to his chest and circles it over his heart and then points at Harry. Harry repeats the movement with dread in his heart. He knew Draco’s father wouldn't approve of their relationship, but having to say goodbye like this for the entire summer is hard.
The forest was dark and silent. We didn’t talk and kept our eyes on the ground and every now and then the moonlight would light up a spot of unicorn blood. While we were walking we could hear something slithering over dead leaves nearby. We stopped and I tried to spot whatever was making that noise. Draco looked at me with frightened eyes. After a few seconds, the sound faded and we started walking again, a little closer together and a little slower. I had the feeling we were being watched, it was really scary.
I’m not completely sure what happened next. I think Black made a move to grab Scabbers, Ron screamed in pain and professor Lupin was dragging Black away from Ron yelling that they first had to make us understand. The rat was squealing like a piglet, scratching Ron’s face. Black, Lupin, Ron and Hermione fought back and forth about if Scrabbers could be Peter Pettigrew and I just stood there. It all made no sense. Black had killed Pettigrew twelve years ago, only days after he made sure you died. And I had missed my chance to revenge you because of Draco, and professor Lupin was in on it all and I was certain we were all going to die that night.
I’ve been really busy with studying with Hermione. I’m trying to remember the ingredients of complicated potions, learn all the charms and spells by heart and memorize the dates of magical discoveries and goblin rebellions. It’s a lot and it helped keep my mind of how miserable I was without Draco around.
(See the end of the chapter for
Neville stares at Harry as if he'd grown another head. Harry grins his teeth together and spits out: “What?”
After our free period, we had a double lesson of potions and everyone kept staring at me. At a certain moment, Professor Snape asked us what was going on. Blaise told him we had Divination this morning and that w were reading tea leaves. Professor Snape interrupted Blaise and asked us who would be dying this year. Draco looked at him and said my name, his voice sounded so scared I couldn’t not grab his hand under the table. And for ones Professor Snape didn’t say a word about it. And then he explained that Professor Trelawney predicts the death of one student a year since she arrived at the school and that none of them has died yet so that there was nothing to worry about. I really hope he’s right. I don’t want to die. Not now when life is just getting better and better.
“I’m sure he’ll be there,” James says. He doesn’t need to be told why Harry’s mood changed and Harry loves him for it. “The Malfoys have made sure they have tickets for a private box,” James says.
Harry laughs. “No, and I won’t now,” he says.
So this is goodbye form this side of the world. I’ll be with you soon.
“Nothing,” Neville says. “What are you up to today?” he asks Iris to distract her. Harry will have to remember to thank him later.
The park is almost empty when they reach it. It’s small. Just a couple of trees, a small playground and a couple of benches. Harry and Draco find a spot in the shade of an oak tree. Harry pulls a blanket from the picnic basket, takes his wand and spreads it over the grass. Draco sits down and lets his hand slide over the blanket. Harry sits down next to him and leans his head against Draco’s shoulder. Draco places his arm around Harry and they just sit. Harry’s heart is beating fast. This is different from the times they sat together at school. Draco is more open, less scared to show that he’s in love with Harry.
“He’s hiding in plain view,” Harry says. “He’s a rat.”
“Stay away from us,” Harry begs as the Dementor lets his hand slide just above Draco’s head. Harry cries out as the screams in his head become louder by the second. He needs to concentrate. Get your wand out of your pocket, he orders himself. Only his hands shake and his fingers won’t cooperate. And his mother keeps screaming. Harry’s wand won’t come out of his back pocket. He can’t stop the Dementor.
“What does that mean?” Harry asks.
He led me to the Beauxbatons carriage. I wanted to ask what was going on, but Hagrid shhh’ed me. Then he went on a stroll with Madame Maxime. She also didn’t know where Hagrid was taking her. He told her not to tell anyone he showed her because she wasn’t supposed to know. It irritated me not knowing where we were going and having to run after Hagrid and Madam Maxime. And I almost turned around and went back to the dungeon to crawl into bed with Draco when I could hear men shouting up ahead. We walked around a clump of trees and then stopped. For a split second, I thought I was looking at bonfires, and men darting around them, and then my mouth fell open. Because the men were darting around four fully grown, enormous, vicious-looking dragons. Draco made me describe them both when I got back. He says it sounds like they have a Hungarian Horntail, a Common Welsh Green, a Swedish Short-Snout and a Chinese Fireball.
And I’m sure you will also be glad to hear that I’m not in trouble for all that happened with Aunt Marge. I’m not getting expelled or have to go to jail. The day after I ran away, an owl from the Ministry came to Malfoy Manor. The Minister had written it personally to tell me that they had dealt with the unfortunate blowing-up of Aunt Marge. Two members of the Accidental Magic Reversal Squad had punctured her and modified her memory. It also said I could go back to live with my Aunt and Uncle next summer, as long as I stayed at Hogwarts for Christmas and Easter holiday. Not that I ever go back for those holidays, but who cares. I’ll have to go back next year. Even Mrs Tonks says it is better for me to stay with family. Right now I don’t really care, I’m not expelled and I have three Dursley-free weeks before school starts.
He does the same with the blanket on the couch, the vase on the window still with dead flowers. Maybe Harry should have just thrown away the flowers and kept the vase. It was a present from Hermione when she and Ron moved out, something to remember them by. Draco always made sure it wasn’t empty from the first day he’d set foot in this house.
Harry looks down at his own hands. Of course Blaise is worried, Draco hasn’t answered his calls for some time now. Just like he ignores all Pansy’s attempts to restore their friendship. Harry has no idea how to get Draco to care again, or how any of their friends can help. But he still tells Ginny that he will let them know if they can.
Draco hates how Harry points the blame to himself. Like he could be at fault for all this. He’s perfect, why would he be the reason Draco can’t get pregnant. It’s so mixed up. Draco wants to open his mouth and tell Harry that he could never be at fault. He sacrificed himself to save everyone else. Why would he be punished for that? He’s not like Draco, who helped that mad man, who let Death Eaters into Hogwarts, who tortured others to save his own life. So many people died because of Draco’s cowardly actions. If anyone is at fault, it is him, not Harry.
“The gifts, the small little tokens Draco has been sending you. Fuck, you really don’t know, do you?” Zabini shakes his head again. “Didn’t any of your house-mates explain to you what was going on?”
He should get a new name tag. The one next to the door still says Harry Potter & Draco Malfoy. It will be just Harry Potter from now on. That was clear when Harry had come home last night from his week-long training in Scotland. When he’d found the house empty, all Draco’s possessions gone. He didn’t even leave a note. Just disappeared from Harry’s life like the last couple of years didn’t matter at all.
“What did he say?” Ginny asks.
Draco looks at Hermione as if she’s crazy. Harry puts his hand on Draco’s arm. “Leave it,” he says while shaking his head. Then he grabs Draco quill. ‘Hermione doesn’t believe in maximum lengths to essays. We’ve tried to explain, but she doesn’t believe it,’ he writes.
“He didn’t get far now, did he?” Neville says. “Stopped by just a little baby.”
The next morning an owl came to deliver a newspaper before we left for London to get all my school stuff. We took a train because Hagrid wasn’t allowed to do magic now he found me. I had to help him with the muggle money. Hagrid was knitting the whole way to London on something that looked like a canary-yellow circus tent. It looked really funny. And then in London, we went to the Leaky Cauldron. It was very weird. Everyone seemed to know who I am and wanted to shake my hand. I also met one of my professors. Professor Quirrell, he is the defence against the dark arts professor. He was very nervous. It had something to do with meeting vampires, I don’t really remember.
Remus doesn’t say anything. Harry knows Remus still feels guilty for not being there that night. Not that anyone ever blamed him. He was at St Mungo's to support his husband. It was a bad time. And Lily and James survived, Lestrange got caught and Harry wasn’t harmed. It could have been so much worse. Harry could have become an orphan just like Neville. But now that the Dementor is gone Harry can appreciate how amazing his life has been up to now. He’s a lucky boy and he will never forget it again.
“My brother. The ‘Boy Who Lived’. Have you seen him?” Harry says with narrowed eyes. How can they not know who Neville is? The entire school knows Neville. He’s a celebrity. A dead celebrity if Harry doesn’t find him soon.
So I need to study a lot to get my head around all the theory of magic and the wand movements and everything. And Ron said I should stop being afraid of my wand. He thinks that’s the main reason I’m struggling with it all. Hermione agrees with him on that one (it’s a miracle!) but also thinks I just need to study harder. Studying harder is her answer to all our problems. I wish life was that simple, but I know studying won’t solve everything.
“I know,” he says instead. “About all that. It isn’t like you said. I don’t do like boys and girls. It’s just boys. Only boys,” Harry stammers.
Saturday 16 July 1993
I felt like a bad friend at that moment, because I was happy that Draco didn’t get hurt. That Ron’s wand had backfired and that Draco was okay. Isn’t that just stupid? Why would I care more about that bastard that used me last year and now even insulted my best friend? Why do I care so much about him, mom? And what do I do to make it stop?
Draco stands up, and Harry rushes over to him. Together they walk after healer Burke to the now-familiar room. Draco sits down on the bed, and Harry sits down on a stool, just like healer Burke.
“I love you too, Teddy,” Draco tells him. “I’ll take Teddy-bear tonight. And then I’ll feel better tomorrow, I promise. Now let us get you back into bed.”
We had lessons all day and I couldn’t wait for it to be over so we could go check on Hagrid. We knocked on his door and a window for over ten minutes, only Hagrid wouldn’t open the door. I know he was there, we could hear Fang’s barks, but he wouldn’t open for us. Hagrid didn’t show himself for the entire week and on Saturday, Draco and I were back at his door, begging him to open up. We screamed that we didn’t care. But it was all for nothing.
“But there are ways? For him to learn?” Harry asks. He shoots to the edge of his seat. This is good news. Malfoy will be able to get better grades and his father won’t be so upset with him anymore.
Draco turned ash white then and said that we really needed to see him, that it was important. And then we told her that someone was going to try to steal the Sorcerer’s Stone. Professor McGonagall was shocked that we knew about it, but she told us that the stone was too well protected to get stolen and suggested we all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine.
Draco is glad for the out. He can’t go and see Pansy and her new baby boy. She’s better off without him anyway. The only thing Draco is good for is hurting others. First by choice, and now because it’s all he’s good for. If only Harry could see that. He should leave and take Teddy with him. Draco will only be able to damage their boy. And Teddy will hate him for it in the end, Draco is sure of it.
“And stare at Malfoy some more,” Neville jokes.
“Bloody hell, Harry. Don’t tell me you’ve been staring at Cedric and Cho all evening. I’m sorry, mate, but I don’t think your evil eye is going to make them split up,” Ron says.
Malfoy glances at the note. He makes a fist with his thumb on top and nods it.
‘I don’t need your friendship,’ Malfoy writes.
Malfoy stands up and Harry’s coffee floats to the desk. Two hands grab his cheeks and then Malfoy’s lips are placed on his. Harry smiles into the kiss which doesn’t last long enough if you ask Harry.
Dear mom and dad,
“He used to be my mother’s best friend,” Harry tells Draco. “They are still friends, but they aren’t as close as they used to be. Uncle Sirius says he loves my mum and hates me because she chooses James instead of him.”
Uncle Remus pretends as if Malfoy hasn’t missed multiple lessons. He just gives Malfoy a note that he wants to talk to him at the end of class. Harry helps Malfoy with the assignment of the day. Malfoy can’t cast, but he practises the movement and that is good enough for now. Harry waits for him after class and they walk to the library together. Malfoy explains that he has to do some extra work to catch up on the subjects he missed. Harry helps him with the work and before they know it, they are extremely late for dinner and Harry has to run to not be late for his Quidditch practice.
“Mum, let go,” Harry says. He looks to the side to see the sneaky smile on Draco’s face. He must be glad his parents aren’t this embarrassing around all their friends.
Draco raises his eyebrows. Does he mean Sirius Black? And why is he important? Harry told Draco about his godfather, during one of their nights alone on the Astronomy tower.
‘Why are you here?’ the note says.
“Didn’t you like the view? Ron has a very nice butt,” Hermione pitches in. She opens the fridge and takes out two bottles of champagne.
“You tell him, Ron,” Fred shouts.
Malfoy stands up, pulls his blanket tighter around his body. “I thought you were a Gryffindor, but turns out you’re an even bigger coward than me,” he says before he turns and walks away.
“I’m pregnant,” he whispers. His eyes fixed on the vial. His hand that holds the instructions shakes a little. In the distance, he hears the front door open and close again. He hears the excited cheer of Teddy and the stumbled steps of the little boy up the stairs.
Draco closes his eyes and bites away the sobs that threaten to leave him. “I’m sorry,” he stutters again. “I’m sorry for pushing you out, for believing you don’t want me if I can’t give you any children. For believing you would leave me because of everything I’ve done. For thinking I have to give you children to make you stay. I’m sorry for all of it. The miscarriage, all the times I hurt you, for following my father and fighting on the wrong side of the war. For almost killing Ron, for being one of the reasons why Sirius is dead, why Teddy has to grow up without his parents. For not holding on to Vincent’s hand. For the potions, now and back then. I wanted to take them today. I wanted it all to stop. I want the pain to stop. It won’t stop, Harry. Please make it stop.”
Draco was proud of me for not bringing it up. We talked a little about it, how it would be like if one of your friends would betray you like that. What if Hermione or Blaise would do that to us? I would be so hurt. So I think I won’t bother Professor Lupin with it, it’s obvious he’s still hurting because of it.
“You didn’t, fuck Draco. You did not kill Vincent. And you did not kill our baby. We lost our baby, and I know it hurts. It hurts me too. But you need to start listening to the healers and me. You did nothing that caused us to lose our baby.”
“Not likely to happen. In all the times we’ve been up against each other, it was always you chasing after me.”
Draco was fine. Madam Pomfrey mended the cut in about a second and gave him some potion to calm down. Hagrid was really sorry and we told him not to worry about it. It was just an accident, we both know that Buckbeak didn’t mend to hurt us. Madam Pomfrey then told Hagrid to go and talk to the Headmaster and made sure Draco and I got some dinner before she sent us back to our own common room.
Once Professor Moody was seated Headmaster Dumbledore continued to explain why there won’t be a Quidditch Cup this year. It seems that our school is hosting the TriWizard Tournament this year. Students of Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will join us this year for this tournament. It’s a competition between the three schools that was stopped when the death toll mounted too high. Each school gets one champion to represent them. Don’t worry, I won’t be able to try (not that I want too) or Draco either (who’s still kind of keen on it) because there is an age limitation. You need to be off age to compete. Adrian and Miles both are going to try to get in.
“I think she’s off on one of her cruises again. I’ll pop by the Manor tomorrow when Teddy is at the nursery and see if she’s there,” Andromeda says.
“No, why would you even send me them? Do you think I enjoy remembering all the awful stuff that happened to me in the last seven years?”
Sunday 8 September 1991
“But you didn’t give up when she first rejected you?” Harry asks.
“You don’t mind. Tomorrow everyone will know about this. It will be in the papers,” Harry stutters.
It was only when Black returned to us that I learnt that Pettigrew had also stunned Snape and had escaped. It seems that Professor Trelawney her prediction came true. The servant is on his way back to the Dark Lord.
The classroom door opens and Malfoy stands up from the floor. He goes inside. Harry, Neville and Hermione follow him. As usual, Malfoy finds a spot at the back of the class. He sits down and pulls his history textbook out of his bag.
Harry smiles at him. He can always count on Ron to help in situations like this. It’s bad enough that everyone is staring at Neville again, as if he somehow is involved with Pettigrew’s escape from Azkaban. Don’t they understand that Neville would be the last person that wants that man on the loose? If it hadn’t been for Pettigrew switching sides and giving away the Longbottom’s location, his parents might not have died.
I’ll write again when Draco is here and tell you all about my party and the Quidditch World Cup.
“Well, as you’ve conceived before, and you’re both still young, we recommend to keep trying to conceive the natural way. Looking at the numbers, it’s still your best chance to get pregnant.”
I love you both,
Remus is an amazing teacher. Much better than all of the Defence teachers Harry’s had so far. But it’s also strange. To him, the professor at the front of the class is just his Uncle Remus. The husband of Harry’s godfather. Harry used to come over to their place for sleepovers and adventures and still loves hanging out at their place when he’s sick of his family and needs a break.
But we didn’t leave straight away and I told Hermione and Draco that I thought that Snape would try to steal the stone tonight, that the letter from the Ministry of Magic was a fake to get Dumbledore out of the way. Hermione was asking what we could do when Snape turned up. He told us to go outside before we’d lose any more points for Slytherin, that it was bad enough we were in the last place for the house cup because of me. And then he said something that proved to us that he was going down the trapdoor that night. He said: ‘Be warned, Potter, any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled.’
-x-x-x-x-x-
“Fine,” Harry says. He motions for Draco to follow him and they walk upstairs.
“Not the way I want him to,” Pansy says. She looks away, out of the dark window. Harry places his arm around her shoulders. He knows this, has known it ever since Draco told him that Pansy had the hots for him in school. Pansy might try to cover it up by saying she never wants a man, or ever wanted children. Harry hasn’t missed the longing looks she gives Draco still from time to time.
“He didn’t fall, he was pushed,” Greg says. “This newspaper is a joke.” He pushes a piece of bacon into his mouth and shakes his head. Pansy looks at him with disapproval, but she doesn’t say a word. She must have given up on trying to teach Greg and Vincent some decent table manners.
This made me wonder, would Professor Snape still be one of his followers? So I asked him about it the next morning when Draco and I went to collect my egg. Professor Snape looked sad when he told us he wasn’t the smartest boy when he was younger, and that he’d made mistakes in his life he would never forgive himself for, but that I needed to worry, that he would do everything in his power to keep me safe. That didn’t stop him from still giving us detention. We had to clean cauldrons for hours on our Saturday off. Even after I told Professor Snape that we were out of bed because we needed to be to figure out the clue of the egg. Professor Snape shook his head and told us we could have worked it out during the day and that we still deserved punishment for being out of bed.
Well, maybe they have a chance this year. Harry was stupid enough to fly into a massive rain cloud to catch that Snitch and almost die in the process, allowing Zabini to win the game. Wood won’t shut up about it. It’s not that Harry planned to be cornered by Dementors and fall off his broom and almost die. Fuck, he only flew so high to catch the Snitch. Wood shouldn’t complain. He should be proud that Harry risked his life to win the game. It’s not his fault that Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw will be easy victories. Cho is good, but her team is lousy. She needs to catch the Snitch before they fall too far behind in points, and Harry will make sure that won’t happen. And Harry only ever lets the games against Hufflepuff go on longer than necessary so he can enjoy the view of Digory on a broom. And no lady, or gay man, would be sad about that. The guy is fit. Not as beautiful as Draco, but still hot as hell. The only issue is that Slytherin will also be able to beat them with ease. Even with Zabini as their Seeker. Draco will be happy about it. His house will win this year if Digory can’t get his team to beat Slytherin.
Draco. He’s still here. Still alive. And still held firmly by Pettigrew. Pettigrew has his wand pointed towards Harry now. Harry looks at him. He’s going to die. He wishes Draco could see him now. That Harry could at least sign that Harry loves him.
“I can’t help it that my dad won’t leave her alone,” Ron answers and then he’s gone to the next carriage. Neville and Harry follow him.
“You don’t get it. I yelled at our eight-month-old baby for no reason. He just tried to grab my cup with tea. He doesn’t know it’s dangerous. And I yelled at him like he murdered someone,” Draco yelled. “I can’t do this. I’m not even halfway and I’m already losing my shit. I can’t do this, Harry.” Big tears streamed down his cheek and Harry pulled him into his arm.
Viktor promised to look after him while I got the headmaster. I ran back to the castle and up the stairs towards the headmaster's office. And just when I reached the stone gargoyle it opened and professor Snape stepped out. He wanted to know what I was doing there and I told him all about how Viktor and I found Mr Crouch in the forest and that he looked mad and wanted to talk to the headmaster. Professor Snape told me to calm down and explain myself clearly. So I took a deep breath and told Snape all about Mr Crouch. And just when Professor Snape said we should get headmaster Dumbledore the gargoyle moved again. The headmaster stepped out and as soon as Professor Snape told him I found Mr Crouch we all set off towards the forest.
