." He said, touching Draco's hand lightly with his wand. Draco regained the feeling in is hand and tightly closed it into a fist a couple of times.
The thing was... Harry was anything but happy at the moment and everyone seemed to be able to see this.
"What do I do?" Harry said, holding it between his thumb and forefinger lightly. Draco rolled his eyes and put the butt of his own cigarette to his lips. Harry watched him take a deep breath, hold it and exhale.
"No Harry, it's not." Draco said with a sigh, turnign away and running one hand through his hair. He was always complaining how messy his hair was but Draco's hair wasn't any better at the moment. "Are you positive you didn't have too much to drink?" Draco said, getting Harry to refocus on their discussion and not on the way Draco's hair fell against his forehead in this soft, curling way.
"Of course." Draco said. "I've even invented a little game we could play." Harry's nose wrinkled as Draco stood from the table.
"Jerk." Harry grumbled. Draco snickered, pulling out a quill and a sheet of parchment. Harry watched him scratch his name out on the top before twirling the quill between his fingers. Harry wasn't lying when he said Draco and him would often come to the library. Sometimes they just sat next to each other and did homework. It was a weird ritual they had acquired for Wednesdays. "Do your friends hate me?" Harry said. Draco looked over at Harry, eyebrow arched.
"Go to bed Harry. I'll see you in the morning at breakfast." Harry thanked her and said goodbye before slowly climbing the stairs up to the boys wing. When he got back to his room, he climbed into his bed and stared up at the ceiling until morning came.
"I... I really do go somewhere to get some... Space but... Someone is usually there with me." Ron pushed his covers off his legs and Harry chewed the inside of his cheek nervously as his friend stood. He didn't want to stand around talking to Ron. He wanted to go see Draco. This was cutting into their time together.
"It was a joke Ron. You know what a joke is right?" Ginny said, winking at Harry who blushed slightly.
"My whole life was pretty sad up until I turned ten." Harry said. Draco took the bottle of firewhiskey back from him and took a drink, staring at Harry the whole time.
His hair in a constant state of fluidity. Sometimes it would be slicked back across his forehead, and other times it looked like Draco had rolled out of bed and right into the classroom. That wasn't the weirdest thing about Draco though. The weirdest thing was that Draco seemed to be purposefully ignoring Harry and it was kind of bugging him.
"Would you prefer if I was a girl?" Draco asked, licking his lips as he pulled back slightly. Harry gave him a funny look.
"An annoyance." Draco said.Harry frowned and Draco smirked before sighing and stepping closer to the messy haired boy. "Alright, if you don't think it was the alcohol, kiss me again."
"Oh whatever." Pansy said, letting go of Harry and wiping at a stray tear under her eye. She breathed in deeply and smirked. There was the Pansy Harry knows. "Now, what the fuck did you do to him?" Pansy said, shoving his shoulder. Harry stumbled.
"You really want me to get off?" Harry said, rocking his hips a little. Draco's expression remained stony but Harry could tell that Draco liked this.
"That and you've got a nice ass." Draco said, watching Harry turn bright red. Draco laughed and stood, gathering his things. "Come on Chosen One, lets head to the Great Hall, I'm starving."
"Will you go out with me?" Harry said, unable to stop himself from blurting it out. Draco pulled away looking stunned.
"Nice. Let's make out in dark corners all the time." Harry said. Draco scoffed and half shoved Harry.
"I'll walk with you. You're rubbish at defense spells." Harry said, squaring off his shoulders. Draco narrowed his eyes at Harry.
"I... Dumbledore was there. You don't have to believe me but it's true. Or at least... It was my mind trying to reconcile everything." Harry said slowly. "I can't be sure." Draco blew smoke out, the lemon scent washing over Harry.
"Yeah, it is getting a bit long Draco." Harry said, reaching out and touching it lightly. Draco couldn't help himself. He leaned in and kissed Harry who tasted just like the lemon cigarette. Harry kissed him back, careful to hold the lit cigarette away from the two of them.
us Potter. I dare you." There was venom in her voice, fire in her eyes. Harry felt a little sick as images of Draco bloody and crying on the bathroom floor filled his mind. Draco tugged on Pansy's sleeve and she slid her gaze from Harry to him. Draco's jaw was clenched tightly. He was pissed at her for brining it up but it had to be done. Together, the unholy trinity moved out of the tower, out the door and disappeared with a slamming of the door. Harry could hear Hermione saying something to him but he couldn't register the words in his mind.
"Yes Harry." Draco said. Harry leaned down and kissed Draco, still grinding down on top of him. Draco resisted against Harry's hands, trying to bring them up off the bed so he could guide Harry's movements. Harry was a little sloppy but his confidence in what he was doing made up for that. "Ah fuck." Draco hissed out. "
"I mean... I'm not sure but I think I remember him making a joke about it once..." Neville thought for a moment and shrugged. "Can't be sure honestly."
"Fuck it." He grumbled under his breath and in two steps Draco closed the distance between him and Harry and kissed him, cupping Harry's face in his hands. Draco could feel Harry's hands running down his chest and towards his waist and then suddenly Harry was yanking on Draco's belt loops and pulling their bodies closer to one another. Draco was completely breathless.
"So you forfeit then? You'll leave the tower?" Draco said nothing. "We could share it too, you know." Draco snorted.
Not even a week after his and Draco's walk through the Forbidden Forest, Harry had started to notice things about Draco. Like how easy it was to make him blush or how he has a tiny dimple on his left cheek. Draco also always seemed to need a place to put his hands as if he was unsure why he had them. They were always either shoved into his pockets or holding a cigarette or his wand or a quill or something that Draco could distract himself with. He could never just leave his hands empty. Harry had also noticed how Draco reacted around him. He never held Harry's gaze for long and always seemed slightly tense or on edge whenever Harry got too close. Harry wasn't sure why he was testing his boundaries with Draco but it always gave him this rush of adrenaline when he got close to him. Was it just residual feelings from when they would get up in each others faces and yell at one another, challenge one another to a duel? Or was it something more?
"It's no more silly than all the rubbish that comes out of your mouth." Harry said with a laugh. "Don't lie, you love that I'm an idiot."
"How much longer you think I have then?" Harry said. Draco shrugged, putting the lemon cigarette to his lips, still holding the pack out out Ron.
with the rest of us. None of them fought for this school! McGonagall shouldn't have let them back in here!" Ron's voice echoed off the stone walls and Harry's gaze slid to Luna not far to his right. Her mouth was set in a hard line. Harry looked back at his friend.
"Have you been... Talking to Malfoy?" Hermione asked slowly at dinner. Everyone looked to Harry who shrugged lightly.
"How are you not freaking out!" Harry snapped at him, stepping away from Draco as if he was diseased. Draco felt like he was about to cry.
"Always. Don't act like you don't." Draco said. He was right of course. Harry had been keeping tabs, that's why he knew that Draco sometimes left the castle late at night. Harry had seen him once, roaming the halls and at first he thought Draco was heading towards the tower but then he veered sharply to the left and before Harry could catch up to him, Draco had exited the castle and was heading towards the Forbidden Forest. Harry wanted to ask Draco about it but he didn't know how to without sounding accusatory.
"Oh don't pout. She's my friend. 'Mione has a jumper of mine too that she took one winter back in fifth year." Harry said, kissing Draco's cheek.
"Then what are you doing out here Draco?" Harry demanded, stepping closer to him. "Why are you going into the Forbidden Forest?"
"I don't want to hear it!" Ron shouted, drawing attention from the rest of the Gryffindor house down the table. Ginny started to laugh.
"I'm sorry I did this to you." Harry whispered, his hand on Draco's chest, right over his fast beating heart.
"You can but there's got to be a reason. All last week you were frightful and now you're little miss sunshine." Pansy said with an air of distaste.
inside that castle okay! Is that a good enough fuckin' answer?" Draco's face was red with anger and Harry felt a weird moment of déjà vu. This was the Draco that Harry recognized.
about it though. Just trying to imagine something like that... It hurt me too much and I knew I couldn't... I mean I knew I didn't want to live with the fear,
"Well let's hope nothing bad happens." Harry said, because knowing his luck, trouble is always right around the corner.
"Shut up I'm talking about you. Although, they do think you're a girl." Harry said. Draco's heart skipped a beat and his cheeks flushed pink. He had hoped Harry was talking about him but he had prepared his heart for the worst. Maybe this was a regular thing for the Chosen One, snogging people in different areas of Hogwarts.
"I... Yeah I think so. I haven't exactly encountered a snake in a while or anything but I'm sure it's all still there." Harry said, tapping his temple lightly.
be my curse? I thought Snape reversed it." That's why that spell sounded so familiar. Harry could often hear Snape chanting it in the back of his mind in his nightmares about hurting Draco.
"I'll think about it." Harry said and before Pansy could call him a prat, he slipped out of the room.
"Raincheck on the biting thing then." Harry said with a wink that made Draco's heart flutter. Harry headed for the towers stairs. "You coming?" He said, glancing back at Draco who hadn't moved from his spot.
"Fine. Whatever." Harry said under his breath. Draco saw Harry look away out of the corner of his eye and part if him wanted to say he was sorry but the other part wanted to tell him to fuck off. Draco has never apologized to Harry for anything he did but then again... Neither has Harry. Draco wasn't sure why Harry wanting to be friends with him felt like a bad idea but it did. Maybe it was because of who he was. Maybe it was because of what he'd done to Harry, Hermione and Ron. Or maybe it was because... Draco just couldn't picture them as friends.
"I'm sorry but I can't stay. Let's do this again though okay?" Harry said, cupping Draco's face in his hands and kissing him. Draco kissed him back hard and nearly grabbed onto Harry's cloak to pull him back into bed. Harry laughed and puled back. "I'll see you soon babe. Bye."
"Do you always disappear after spending the night with someone?" A voice asked behind Harry. Draco glanced back at the tall blond boy behind him. Draco had one hand in the pocket of his pants, the other was holding a small stack of books.
Harry didn't know he was looking for Draco Malfoy as his eyes scanned the Great Hall, but he found himself pausing when he spotted Pansy Parkinson and Blaise Zabini. They were easy enough to see amongst the seventh years, everyone seemed to be giving them a wide berth. To Harry, it didn't seem like it was out of fear but probably more along the lines of respect. Harry stared at them for longer than necessary, unsure why he was confused by what he was seeing until it hit him.
. When Draco was satisfied with how Harry said it, then he showed him the appropriate hand gesture needed to complete the spell. "Almost like a swish and flick but with a longer flourish." Draco said, demonstrating.
"You don't have to apologize. Nothings wrong with being angry." Harry said. "But I'm still going to talk to him and hangout with him. There's nothing wrong with getting to know him." Ron scoffed.
"Why won't you just let me touch you. Nobody's going to see." Harry said. Draco laughed as he felt Harry's warm hands touch his lower abdomen.
"Yes mum." Harry said. Hermione laughed a little and Harry was glad to see her smile. Dean, Seamus and Neville came back to the room not long after and each of them fell asleep easily. Harry on the other hand, was a different issue. So with his mind racing and his feet itching to move, Harry began to head to the North Tower.
be late Potter." Malfoy said, moving down the hall swiftly. Harry watched how the sea of kids would part for Draco, as if they didn't want to be anywhere near him. They all looked at Harry like he was a fucking lunatic for being so close to him.
"Not until you say you're sorry." Draco said defiantly, pushing some of his hair out of his face with one hand. Harry chuckled a little.
?" Harry was unsure what to say. "If I was you... I would've just..." Draco made an evaporating sort of motion with his hand.
The two boys instead had been studying more in the library and sometimes sneaking out for smoke breaks in some abandoned or un-frequently used corners of the castle. On one of these particular occasions, Harry had been putting the blueberry cigarette to his lips, listening to Draco talk and laughing about some of the sarcastic shit he was saying. Harry had been standing probably a bit too close to the blonde boy but he didn't particularly care and neither did Draco. Nobody had caught them yet.
"Yes." Pansy said firmly. Harry knew she wasn't messing with him right now. "And believe me, I was so shocked I nearly threw up but..." Pansy paused. "Draco wears his heart on his sleeve. It may not be obvious to you but it's obvious to me. That's why he's so... Why he's so fragile now. The stitching is coming undone, the stuffing is coming out and.."
"Wow, look at you. Didn't know you were into the whole bad girl vibe. She's got you smoking and soon you'll be wearing leather jackets and slicking back your hair." Harry laughed lightly, shaking his head.
"Well at least you can laugh at me if I do." Harry said with a smirk. Draco seemed to think on this for a moment before he nodded.
"Uh-oh, that doesn't sound good." Draco said, leaning back in his chair before pulling out his wand and magicking the tea kettle full of water before casting a warming spell over it.
"Draco, one of the last things Harry said to us was that he wanted to walk into the Forbidden Forest and wait for something to kill him. Would he go there?" As soon as Hermione said this, Draco's eyes lit up and he stood. Hermione and Ron scrambled to stand with him.
." Harry said with a scowl, eyebrows arched down angrily. Pansy arched an eyebrow at him. "Sixth year. A dark curse. Any of that ring a fuckin bell?" Pansy's eyes lit up.
Harry. He grabbed up his cloak, mouth dry. "Harry don't leave." Draco said, surging forward and grabbing his arm. Harry tensed, clenching his jaw.
"Fuck you, you prat. Just because you're the Chosen One doesn't mean that everyone is in love with you and-"
Draco could feel Harry tugging the rest of his shirt out of his pants where it had been tucked in and finish undoing the buttons that he had left behind in favor of running his hands through Harry's hair. Harry pushed the fabric down his shoulders and Draco slipped it off. Just as Draco was about to demand that Harry remove his shirt, Draco felt a sharp pain on his chest that made him hiss and pull away from Harry completely. Not now. God why did it have to happen right now?
. We're leaving." Harry said. Hermione looked shocked beyond belief. Pansy was still struggling to escape Blaise's grip.
believe in and she believed in this place a hell of a lot more than I did unfortunately." Harry was surprised to see Pansy a little misty-eyed. "Don't you dare erase her death. She
understand unless you bloody talk to him." Pansy snapped at Harry, taking her handkerchief back and stuffing it into the pocket of her robe. "You need to go talk to him, apologize, and shag him. Not necessarily in that order." Harry rolled his eyes, scrunching up his nose at her in slight disgust. He didn't like hearing Pansy talk about him and Draco like that. She made it sound... Dirty.
"W-what?" Harry said. Draco always thought Harry looked kind of cute with that stupid confused look he always wears. Draco held his hand out to Harry. Harry took it and stepped a little closer to Draco, squeezing his hand lightly.
"There was also that time you let slip to Neville that Luna liked him." Seamus said. Neville blushed red. Him and Luna had been dating now for the better part of the year. Everyone thought they made a really cute couple.
"You're right, it looks even worse than I imagined." Draco said throwing one hand in the air and scowling lightly before running that same hand through his white blond hair. "How did you mess up a simple drought?" Draco demanded.
"Good." Draco said, plopping down onto the blanket, continuing to pull way too many things out of the backpack that surely couldn't all fit in there. "You probably just recognize it from all the other times you ran around stupidly through here." Draco said. Harry half smirked and sat in front of Draco, crossing his legs.
"I'm pretty sure he does." Draco said, refusing to look at them. Ron nudged Hermione and she sighed.
strawberries." Draco said, pulling the cigarette pack out of the pocket of his robe. It was mostly full of strawberry cigarettes. Draco and Harry weren't particularly fond of that flavor and always smoked them once the other two were gone.
"If none of it's true why does it matter to you if I'm being loud?" Pansy demanded, crossing her arms over her chest.
"You're positive that's what he said?" Draco asked. It looked like Hermione had put a little life into him.
"They didn't though." Harry said with a smirk. "Did you used to do this with those other guys?" Harry said. Draco swallowed hard and rolled his eyes but eventually shook his head. Nobody else he had ever been with tried to push him up against a wall in such a public place.
"I just mean that... I've known for at least a year or two now." Blaise said. Draco was stunned. Pansy was too so Draco knew she hadn't said anything.
Potter." Draco said in a low whisper as he glared at Harry. Harry just smirked and removed his hand from Draco's thigh. Since they were seated at the back of the room, with only two real possible witnesses to what they were doing sitting opposite them, Harry thought it wouldn't be such a bad idea to touch Draco. He obviously thought otherwise. It had been another whole week since Harry and Draco had decided they liked kissing one another, though they hadn't really established what they were yet, and Draco was quickly realizing that Harry was a touchy prick. He was always teasingly putting his arm around Draco or touching his hand or leg whenever they sat next to one another. It was horrible. Draco
"Really? Then why are you wearing your signature worried expression." Harry said. Draco frowned at him. Harry hadn't even looked up.
"You never know Harry, maybe I finally poisoned one this time. This could be the last blueberry cigarette you ever have." Draco said. Harry started to laugh and that really confused Ron. Usually Harry would retort with something else. Instead, he was laughing.
"How much did you steal exactly?" There was enough rolls and sandwiches for almost a dozen people. There was five different kinds of fruit, some leftover roast from last night, jars of jelly, peanut butter, a tossed salad, what looked like a thermos of soup and Draco was just now pulling out some custard and several slices of pie.
"That's my point." Ginny said. "Malfoy basically dismissed your presence and it's not bugging you at all. That shit used to get on your nerves. I would know. You would complain about it constantly." Ginny said as she and Luna giggled.
"Ron, stop. It's done okay." Harry said through his teeth, pulling Ron away from the three Slytherins.
"Well it wasn't Penelope." Harry said, shaking his head and eating his mashed potatoes. His friends were quiet, waiting for him to confess who it was but Harry wouldn't. Couldn't. How could he tell them that he just snogged Draco in the North Tower? How could he tell them that he's sort of been thinking of doing
"Really? Dating her is what has completely confirmed for me that I'm into girls." Blaise said. Draco started to laugh loudly and soon, Blaise joined in as Pansy started to punch both of them in the chest.
"God this is a bore." Ron said with a groan. The trio were currently sitting in the Gryffindor Common Room. Hermione was reading a book and Harry was sitting on the floor, doing some homework on the coffee table. Ron on the other hand was just watching them, bored out of his mind.
"That's what made it fun. Besides, didn't you love my christmas present." Harry said. Draco just stared at him.
Not physically, but in life. He felt as if he had lost all direction, all purpose after Voldemort was defeated. What is the Chosen One supposed to do after they defeat their enemy? Open up a bake shop? Harry was rubbish at baking. He was rubbish at everything else too. Why did he feel like a washed up hero? A broken record? Shouldn't he be happy that things could finally be normal for him?
"Why the fuck should I?" Harry demanded. He had never been more pissed off in his entire life. He had stewed in his anger all weekend, hoping it might blow over but it didn't and he was burning more holes in clothes, the carpet, the curtains than he had all year. Usually, his fights with Draco wouldn't upset him this bad but... This was different after all.
"Oh whatever, he knows what I mean." Ginny said with a shrug. "I'm not entirely sure about the whole, Draco fought for our side since I didn't see it myself..." Ginny said.
"Oh, I told Hermione that I was bisexual." Harry said with a laugh. "She said she knew because of how I acted around Cedric apparently." Harry said with a shrug. Draco pursed his lips and leaned in so he could kiss Harry's temple lightly.
"Sorry Professor, please continue." Harry said with an easygoing smile, leaning his arms onto the table in front of him, pretending to be interested. Draco tried not to roll his eyes. When their potions teacher turned back around though, Draco muttered under his breath,
"Too busy to see your friends? Fuck you too." Ginny said. Harry just grinned. "What have you been up to? How's the teaching thing going? They actually going to let you back into Hogwarts as a Professor?" Ginny demanded.
"Yeah, why not." He said, rolling his eyes and completely oblivious to what he just said. Draco on the other hand was not oblivious and instantly reddened. Harry continued to talk as if nothing was wrong. "I just don't get... I mean we told him a short list of people who were in Slytherin and weren't bad people but he wasn't convinced." Draco shrugged.
"How about all those times you would shout at me across the entire hall to insult something about my appearance?" Harry said.
"Well if he's not gonna say it I will!" Ron said indignantly. "They're plotting something. Just look at them." Blaise seemed to be reading an excerpt from his book, not paying attention to his two friends and Pansy was teasingly swatting at the strands of hair in Draco's face. He was smirking down at her. Harry really wished he could just walk across the way and kiss Draco full on the mouth but he restrained himself.
"Ginny and I decided together that we should break up. She's the one that spoke the most because... Honestly I was worried about upsetting your mum or something." Harry said, rolling onto his side on his makeshift bed on the floor.
"I didn't ask you to fucking save me. I'm asking you to stay and talk to me." Draco said. Harry threw his hands up.
"It's just... Well Ron is still pissed. I told my friends we hang out and that you're sort of my friend now and they..."
"Most things you do are my business since, you know, we live together." Harry said. Draco smiled broadly. For the past month, Harry had been unable to stop bringing up the fact that the two of them lived together. He was always slipping this fact into every conversation they had together and every conversation with their friends. It drove everyone except Draco absolutely nuts. Hearing Harry say that they live together comforted Draco. It was something he had always fantasized about, a plain, boring, domestic relationship with Harry Potter.
"Holt shit." Harry said, unsure of what to do. One second he's kissing Draco, wondering what's going to happen next and suddenly, Draco is wincing, pulling away and suddenly has several small cuts on his chest, all of them seeping blood. Harry fumbled for his wand on Draco's nightstand behind him as Draco grabbed his own on his bed. "Are you okay? What happened? Let me see." Harry touched Draco's bare chest lightly and normally, Draco would've been thrilled but he didn't want to have to explain this to Harry. He didn't want him to know what this was.
"Just come here." Draco said, nodding to the left of him as he sat on his bed. Harry swallowed hard and sat next to him. Draco huffed over the fact that Harry left space between them. "Prude." Draco said. Harry scoffed and kissed him, making Draco smirk lightly as he slid closer to his boyfriend and slipped his tongue into his mouth. Draco remembered the first time he did that and how Harry practically melted against him. Harry's hands fumbled for the buttons on Draco's shirt. "God Harry, have you ever taken someone's shirt off before?" Draco demanded, pulling back and undoing the buttons himself. Harry didn't say anything. He couldn't even believe this was happening.
"Undo the spell." Draco said. Harry sighed. "Undo it so we can go somewhere else twat. We're not talking about this here." Harry set his jaw.
"Liar." Draco said with a grin. Harry shrugged and just kissed him again. He wanted to ask Draco something but he wasn't sure how the Slytherin boy would handle it.
"Why?" Harry whispered back, pulling away and pressing their foreheads together, his hand on the back of Draco's neck. "I've hurt you both physically and emotionally now." Draco laughed a little bitterly.
"Well, while we appreciate you coming out to us, Harry." Seamus said. "I still want to know who it is that you're snogging behind closed doors."
"Yes." Hermione said. "He was being serious. I've never seen him so..." Hermione swallowed hard, shaking her head. She had been holding back tears for so long now, her head hurt.
"Stop being so dramatic, all of you. Draco is... Fit and I like him and we've technically been dating for about two months."
"Didn't seem important really." Blaise said before standing slowly. "Anyways, I have homework to do." He said, moving off slowly.
"Harry." Hermione whispered again but Harry didn't pay attention to her. He simply walked towards Draco who was now standing with his arms crossed, staring pointedly at Harry.
"I've never just gone for a walk in the forest before." Harry said, as he slowly walked bak and forth on the fallen log in front of him. Draco watched his movements, having half a mind to use a spell to knock Harry to the ground but he decided Harry looked better like this, balancing up above him. He had always liked taller boys but... Harry being shorter than him was something that made Draco's heart skip a beat for some odd reason. He was only shorter by about an inch but, that was enough for Draco.
"You've met my family right? They're all going to have something to say about this." Harry sighed again.
"She did it because she loves you." Harry said. Draco looked up at him like he was an idiot but Harry's eyes were so soft and warm that the tension in Draco's shoulders fell away. "It's the same thing my mum did." Draco scoffed.
"You're way too happy for someone who has stayed up a couple extra hours just to be alone with their thoughts." Blaise said, crossing his arms over his chest.
"Much better." He said, heading for the exit, walking past Harry quickly. "Have a nice night." With that, Draco pulled open the door to the tower and closed it quickly behind himself. Harry could still smell the lemon smoke in the air.
Out on the hill overlooking Hagrid's house, the Forbidden Forest and the rest of the valley, Harry told his friends what had happened. Ron was the most displeased by the news, arms crossed over his chest as he scowled. "Oh wow, one good deed. Should I give him a medal?" Ron asked.
Every brick seemed to be filled with painful memories for Harry and all of them flashed before his eyes as he walked along. It was as if his feet were torturing him by taking him down the halls he had dreaded seeing now that he was back. Harry almost wished he could wipe his memory, forget any of this happened. He wished he could see Hogwarts with fresh eyes. Those 12 year old eyes that had first seen Hogwarts. He wished he could go back then.
"Prat." Harry said. Draco shook his head, handing Harry a teacup. He sat up and took the cup from Draco, their hands touching briefly. "I used to call Ginny Cutie pie. She liked it."
"Well you've chosen the wrong guy to be your first one." Draco said with a small chuckle. Harry exhaled slowly, and wrapped his arm tighter around his boyfriend.
"I... I don't like to think about it." Harry said softly, touching one of the small scars, his thumb running over the bumpy ridge.
"I don't know what to say to you." Harry said, refusing to turn around. Draco slowly let go of Harry's arm.
Harry had been standing outside Draco's bedroom door for close to five minutes now. He kept raising his hand under his cloak to knock on the door but then, ultimately, would pull his hand back and bite his lip, trying to work up the courage to knock by shaking out his shoulders and hyping himself up in his head.  He knew exactly what Draco had meant early that day when he told Harry to come to his room tonight and while he was excited, he was also very, very nervous. He and Draco had barely done more than make out. Sometimes Draco was a bit handsy but other than that... Not much else happened other than that time when Harry sat on top of Draco. He could still barely believe he had been bold enough to do that but it just... It felt right. It felt like something he wanted to do. So why the fuck couldn't he knock on Draco's door?
"I love you too Harry." Draco said against his lips. "I've loved you for a long time." Harry pulled back a little, breathing hard.
"Ron, we're not defending what Pansy said. We all hate what she said too." Hermione said, touching his shoulder lightly. "But you can't just say... All Slytherins are bad because that's not true. It's not like... All Gryffindors are good or all Ravenclaws love school. Those are just stereotypes."
"I... I didn't know." Harry said. He was breathing hard and Draco ground his teeth. He didn't like the way Harry was looking at him.
"Harry snap out of it, please." Hermione begged. The present rushed back to Harry and punched him in the gut. Ron was crying.
"Sorry we're a snore." Harry said, continuing to scratch away at the parchment with his quill. Honestly, he wished he could just use regular pens and paper. What was so wrong with a ballpoint pen and a spiral notebook? Ron left the two of them alone and Harry tried to act as nonchalant as possible now that they were alone. He kept giving side glanced to the other Gryffindors around the room, wondering if they might try to listen in to them but nobody seemed to be paying attention. Harry took a deep breath.
"I think so... At least McGonagall thinks it's a good idea. I have to take a couple classes but I think it's a done deal."
"I'm mostly just speaking it into the universe. Sometimes when I tell myself I won't have nightmares then... The nightmares don't come." Harry said. Draco swallowed hard. How incredibly optimistic and cute.
"It's not like you have to listen." Draco said. "Now do you want a smoke or not? My arm is getting tired." Draco said. Harry thought Ron might cuss them out a little and then walk away but miraculously... Ron slowly reached for a cigarette.
"I feel like I recognize this place." Harry said, looking around as Draco pulled a blanket out of his backpack.
Harry felt incredibly giddy and he was smiling from ear to ear like some sort of fool. When he saw the looks on his friends faces though, that's when he became anxious. Ron's mouth was open so wide, Harry thought his jaw might disconnect and hit the floor. Ginny still had her hand over her mouth in shock and Hermione didn't look like she was breathing. Harry cleared his throat slowly as he sat down, his friends watching him.
"Get off me, you're heavy." Harry said even though Draco wasn't really putting any of his weight on him.
"It doesn't concern them." Draco said. That's when he had frowned, both of their good moods slightly soured now.
"Anyways, I'm not bothered by it if that's what you're wondering." Blaise said, opening his book up again. Draco said nothing for a bit.
"Harry please stay after class a while, please." Draco whispered to the dark haired boy next to him.
"You're done for." Draco shot forward and Harry laughed as Draco pinned Harry's arms to the ground, sitting on his stomach. "Nobody can hear you scream up here Potter. I could kill you easily." But Harry was laughing so loudly the owls in the next tower over could probably hear him.
"And nothing. That's all I was thinking about." Draco said. Harry looked up at Draco over the rim of his glasses.
"Harry took him here I would bet." Ron said. "Isn't this the same place..." Hermione nodded and took his hand.
"But he still went to their side." Neville interjected. "When his parents called, he went. Voldemort bloody congratulated him." Neville said with a frown.
"Yeah! Bisexual!" Ginny exclaimed, finding her voice. "Not that you were shagging your arch-nemesis!" Hermione hushed Ginny who was red in the face with... Embarrassment? Confusion? Harry couldn't tell.
"Fuck you Ron! Fuck you and everyone like you who laughed and booed and said horrible fucking shit to us at twelve years old just because we were placed in this House!" Harry took a step away from her. Ron stood his ground. "I was proud to be Slytherin like my father, my mother and you all
"Bollocks." Seamus grumbled. Harry slowly turned back around in his seat and hated to admit that he felt nothing but... Relief.
"Well you're happy for some damn reason and I want to know what it is Draco." Pansy said, crossing her arms over her chest as she frowned. "So tell us who you're shagging."
"Why come back then? You still haven't answered that." Draco finally looked over at Harry. His green eyes shone in the moonlight and his mouth was set into a hard, thin line.
"I'm bisexual." Harry said and as soon as the words left his mouth he felt a lot better. What surprised him though was how Hermione just looked back down at her book and said,
"Honestly Ronald, you're starting to sound like Harry." Hermione said. Harry snickered, eyeing Draco across the quad where he stood with Blaise and Pansy. His hands were shoved into his pockets, blonde hair still messed up from their earlier make out session. It was falling over into his eyes in messy strands that Draco hadn't bothered to push back. Harry chewed on the inside of his cheek. Damnit he was cute. Pansy looked to be teasing Draco about his hair.
"Bastard." Draco said as Harry stepped back and pulled up the hood of the cloak, disappearing. Harry watched Draco fall back down into his pillows and wondered if the blond boy realized he was leaving or not. Maybe Draco thought he was dreaming. Harry half smiled to himself as he snuck out of the Slytherin dorms.
Harry wasn't sure he had ever heard Draco Malfoy say thank you to anyone, let alone to Harry Potter. Harry hadn't realized he had made it to the dining hall until he was sitting himself down next to Hermione, across from Ron. Hermione poked him in the ribs. "Ow." Harry mumbled.
"Every week. She... Worries." Draco said. Harry nodded, squeezed Draco's hand one last time and took up another sandwich.
"Draco." A voice said with a half laugh. Draco looked behind him, startled. There, three steps above him was Harry Potter, grinning like a fool. His green eyes were fucking sparkling. Draco swallowed hard. "You walked right past me."
"Shut up." Draco was blushing red all the way to his ears as he drank his tea. Harry kissed his cheek and Draco flipped him off. Harry just grinned, setting his cup down before heading to the kitchen to get a towel and clean up the spilled tea. Draco tried not to admire Harry's ass in his jeans but it was kind of hard.
"Are you insane?" Draco said, wondering why he was getting so worked up over three little words. "Me? Do you know who you're talking to?"
"I... I didn't know what you would like." Draco said. Harry was surprised to see how hard Draco was blushing. He smiled widely and reached out to brush some of Draco's hair out of his eyes. Draco looked up at him nervously.
"I've always pitied you Potter." Harry rolled his eyes and slowly took a sip from the bottle. He didn't exactly want to be drunk, that was Draco's idea, Harry actually wanted to remember this night if Draco was saying sorry to him. "I think it's your turn." Draco said. "And don't say something sad. Sad shit and firewhiskey don't mix." Harry tried to think of something funny, running one hand through his hair and messing it up even more. "Quit that. You already look disastrous."
"But it's ours. Right?" Harry shrugged. "Don't do that. Just answer me. Just tell me if you still want this." Draco said.
... I'll hex you so badly, your grandchildren will feel it." She threatened before walking away to go find Blaise. Hermione and Ron said nothing, just stared at Draco as he continued to sit up against the wall. Hermione eventually sighed and sat down in front of him, crossing her legs. Ron grudgingly sat next to her.
Harry ran one hand through his dark, messy hair and then pinched the bridge of his nose where his glasses sat. The tip of his wand illuminated the stone floor as he walked, unsure of his exact direction. There really was no purpose to this midnight stroll. Harry just couldn't sleep. The Gryffindor eighth year floor was one that had been closed over for several years now, no longer part of the regular dorms because there simply weren't that many students traipsing through the castle walls. It had been re-opened and housed only those who had returned to finish off their schooling at Hogwarts. The boys had one part of the dorms, the girls the other. There was only about twenty of them altogether, most of them boys and for some reason, Dean's snoring and Ron's quiet mumblings in his sleep bothered Harry. He just needed to get out of there.
"Twat." Draco fired back. Harry was still laughing and Draco was straining, fighting the urge to lean in and kiss the stupid boy beneath him.
"Could've fooled me." He grumbled. "Last time we were there, Ronald glared at me the whole night and your first and last girlfriend bombarded me with questions and accusations and..."
"Oh stop it. That's not what Harry and I wanted to say." Ginny interrupted before the conversation could escalate further. She took a deep breath and shook her head. "It's quite the opposite actually... Harry and I are breaking up and we wanted to tell you all at once." Ginny looked to Harry, telling him it was his cue to say something. "We thought this might be better than telling everyone individually or only telling... Some of you and having you pass it around." More silence. "Any questions."
"Okay." Harry said, walking down the two steps, leaving just enough room between them. "But it's me." Harry said. Draco just stared up at Harry and his stupid grin.
"What?" He said. Draco knew that he wanted to leave this place but he couldn't imagine Blaise leaving for America.
"All the Eighth years will be there. It will be like one big class reunion for us and hey... There'll be alcohol. I know how much you love Firewhiskey."
"This is our new normal. We have to all get used to being around one another." Harry said as Hermione greeted Blaise and Pansy maybe a bit too enthusiastically. Harry waved at the pair of Slytherins as they stepped into the room.
"Yeah, you can help me by showing yourselves to the door." Ron said, pointing at it behind him. The chatter and laughter around the room quickly died down as everyone began to stare at the Golden Trio and the Unholy Trinity.
"Because I said so." Draco shouted at him, whirling around to look at him. Harry wore a solemn expression while Draco was scowling something awful.
person." Draco blushed red. "And I'm so fucking sorry." It felt good to hear Harry say it. Draco never thought he would hear those words come out of Harry's mouth. "We always fought Draco but I never meant to try and kill you. I didn't even know... I didn't really know what the spell did until I saw the damage. I'm so sorry."
"Well it's the polite thing to do isn't it? Didn't your..." The sentence died in Draco's throat. He had almost asked,
"I thought we agreed that tonight was my night Potter." Draco said, hearing the door behind him creak open. Draco didn't dare look back at him. He probably had bed head or would be wearing those same ridiculous Gryffindor pajamas under his robe again.
"Don't make me hex you boy. Eat your food and say nothing." Mrs. Weasley said. Hermione nudged her boyfriend as everyone laughed and slowly began to shift the conversation. Ginny poked Harry's arm lightly. He glanced over at her.
"Typical Potter." He grumbled. "Next time you shag one of your enemies, just tell me Draco." Blaise said before disappearing into the crowd.
"Who said anything about an experiment?" Harry said. Draco huffed and crossed his arms over his chest. "It's not like I'm going to go around kissing other guys to see if I like this or not. I
"Honestly Harry, you're so oblivious sometimes. Penelope is the girl with the big eyes and dark hair. She's a Ravenclaw." Harry vaguely recalled a small girl with a shy smile and frowned at himself for not knowing her name. He'd known her since year two.
"Blimey you're dramatic." Harry said glancing down at his shoes. Draco grabbed the collar of Harry's robe and pulled him closer. Harry's heart thumped wildly in his chest and he could hear several people shout at them to not fight as well as people shouting out their bets about who would
"Wow, a compliment. Thanks Ron." Ginny said with a smirk. Harry smiled and Ginny winked at him. "I call dibs on hearing their name first though." Ginny said.
"Exactly!" Ron exclaimed. "Come on Harry. It'll be fun. I swear and if it's not..." Ron paused, thinking. "If it's not I'll take a walk in the Forbidden Forest."
Draco was humming as he strolled back to the Slytherin eighth year portion of the castle. It was a secret door down from the main Slytherin dorms and common room. It was a part of the Slytherin House where a lot of overflow students would go and right now, overflow consisted of the handful of Slytherins who had returned to finish their final year. Despite what Ron and the others thought, a couple of Slytherins had actually stayed behind to help fight against Voldemort. The ones who survived were now trudging through their final year with deep mental and emotional scars weighing on them. Draco entered the room he shared with Blaise and was surprised to find his friend still awake and staring at him.
"Shut up." He said again. Harry said nothing, just looked down at the ground as Draco shakily took a long drag on his cigarette. It had almost died out in his hand.
"You... You've never told me that." Pansy said. She had stopped pacing and as much as Draco was surprised by Blaise's admission, hearing how betrayed Pansy sounded was different. He had noticed that they had gotten closer this past year but... He didn't think anything of it until now. Were his two friends...
"Fine." Draco said, noticing the slight shift in Harry's facial expression. He was thinking about something and Draco wanted this moment to end. He was still pinning Harry's arms to the ground. He should've let go ages ago. Before Draco could move to get off of Harry, he closed the leftover distance between them and kissed Draco full on the mouth. Draco kissed him back easily before his brain processed through all the information and his body recoiled backwards like a rubber band.
"What'd you do?" Harry said. He was still holding the arm of a salamander and a spring of mint. Draco took the mint from him and dropped it in. The mixture began to smell like toothpaste.
"You two are happy. You don't need me. I don't want to be the cause of one or both of your deaths." Harry said. Hermione let out a small sob.
"Why would I show you how to use the one thing I'm better at than you?" Draco said. Harry cocked his head, confused.
"Ronald." Hermione hissed in a low voice. Harry tried not to cringe. It had been a week. An entire week of refusing to talk to Draco, refusing to read his magical notes. Harry had even convinced Professor Potswell that he and Draco shouldn't be potions partners anymore. Harry thinks she only made this change because Harry had broken down crying over it. It was the first time he had cried in a long time. Not even updates from Andromeda about Teddy could cheer him up. He was just... Sad.
"Sh-shut up." Draco said, trying and failing to act normal. He was blushing red all the way to his ears. It was cute. Harry laughed silently and Draco huffed, shaking his head as he set his teacup down and undid the spell on Harry. The tower immediately filled with his laughter.
"Look... I... Your guess is as good as mine as to why... Why Draco thinks you're still worth something even though you tried to kill him."
"Isn't that a good thing." Ron said as everyone focused back in on each other. "At least you two won't be at each other's throats Harry." But Harry frowned a little. Was it weird to say he kind of wanted to fight with Malfoy?
"Because you see me through fucking rose colored glasses Draco. I'm not a bloody hero. I'm not your savior. You should hate me for what I did to you! I still hate me." Harry said, voice echoing off the stone. Draco was grinding his teeth.
Before Harry could raise his hand in an attempt to knock, the door opened and there stood a slightly agitated Draco. "Oh stop it and just come in side." Draco said. Harry's eyebrows shot up in surprise and he slowly pushed back his hood.
"Just give me a lemon one." Draco glanced over at him. "Do you still have those?" Draco slowly took the packet out of his pocket. When Harry opened it, all that was in there was lemon cigarettes. Draco tried not to stare at him as Harry lit his cigarette. Harry had always liked kissing Draco after he had smoked a lemon cigarette. He always thought Draco was just like a lemon. Sometimes sour. Sometimes sweet. Always delicious. Harry blew the smoke out slowly.
." Draco said again. Harry looked up at him. "Don't just play with the cigarette Harry." He held his wand out and Harry sighed, putting the blue cigarette too his lips. Draco lit the end and Harry could immediately smell blueberries.
"Shit, glad I don't go there anymore. It would be horrible to have your Ex as your teacher. That's a rubbish storyline just waiting to happen." Harry grinned. "And what about you Draco? Still haven't decided?"
"Took you long enough." Draco said as Harry dropped the hood of his cloak and hung it on the old, tarnished hook on the back of the wooden door. Harry shrugged apologetically.
"Andromeda Tonks was a Slytherin." Harry said softly. He had just received a letter from her recently with a picture of Teddy who was squealing in the photo, hair changing from blue to pink and back again. Harry had the picture in his sweater pocket right now.
"I... What?" Harry asked. Harry had sort of thought Draco as his boyfriend but he didn't dare say it out loud in case Draco didn't feel the same way. Draco looked embarrassed.
Harry and Ginny hadn't exactly discussed when they were going to announce their breakup to the family. Harry had half suspected that it would be at the end of the dinner, not when Ginny was passing him a bowl of white rice. "Harry and I have something to say." Ginny said, startling Harry so badly he nearly dropped the entire bowl of rice on his lap. The dinner table immediately became deathly silent.
"I'm going to get it wrong Draco and then you're just going to get mad at me for guessing all the wrong things and then..." Draco held up his hand.
"I'm thinking of selling Harry's stuff on the blackmarket. Everyone wants a piece of the Chosen One." Draco said. Ginny started to laugh as Harry hit his boyfriends arm.
"Ah look what the snake dragged in." Ginny called out. "My ex and his boyfriend." Harry laughed as he hugged her. "How've you been Chosen One. I never see you anymore."
"I'm real." He said. Draco wanted so badly to lean in and kiss him but he didn't want Harry to push him away. That would be worse than him disappearing. "Can I have a smoke?" Harry said. Draco clenched his jaw, looking away as he handed the cigarette to Harry.
"Malfoy." Harry whispered again, poking the boy in the arm. Charms class had ended three minutes ago and Draco Malfoy was passed out in his seat, head in his arms on his desk. Professor Laurel didn't seem to mind or care that one of his students had fallen asleep. In fact, he was busy looking over some parchment work as the rest of the students continued to file out of the room slowly and head for lunch. Harry poked Draco's arm again. Nothing happened. As Harry was debating whether or not to charm some water to fall on top of him, Pansy marched into the Charms room, saw Draco and Harry and scowled. Harry pulled back from Draco as Pansy came forward. Pansy simply placed her hand on top of Draco's head and the blond boy sat up groggily. Harry didn't realize he was staring at Draco's sleepy face until the older boy started to frown slightly.
"Is it Fanny from Hufflepuff?" Neville asked. Everyone looked to him. He had been quiet as Dean, Seamus, and Ron threw out the names of girls from different houses. Neville blushed when he saw that everyone was staring at him. "Sorry Harry. You don't have to tell us." He said with a sheepish grin.
"You don't have to say it just because I did." Harry said, pausing in what he was doing. He looks so sad and hurt, like a kicked puppy. Draco wanted to kiss every inch of his face.
"All I'm saying is... If Draco says he's different, then I believe him. I don't think he's the enemy anymore and we should recognize that." Luna said. Ginny laughed a bit sarcastically, looking to Harry.
"It's not even a girl for Christ's sake." Harry finally let slip out. Ginny gasped loudly and dramatically. The table became deathly quiet and Harry blushed red. "I mean..."
"Oh." Harry said. Draco shook his head. "Well... Sorry for thinking otherwise then." Harry smiled sheepishly and Draco grabbed him by the collar of his shirt and pulled him closer.
"If we don't stop..." Draco said through his teeth, loving the feeling of their bodies pressed up against each other. "
me. He should want to hurt me as badly as I hurt him but he doesn't because all of you still see me as some kind of fucking hero." Harry shook his head at himself. "He said he didn't care. He said he forgave me a long time ago but he was lying. I think part of him died that day I used that curse on him." Harry started to walk away.
"I think we're sure Harry. " Harry sighed. He knew Ginny was right. Everything felt a little... Weird between them ever since Harry had died, came back to life and had to deal with the repercussions of the war. He had spent the entire summer at the Weasley house, trying not to think too hard about Fred or Remus or Tonks or any of the number of other people who had died not just in the war, but over the course of the last eighteen years of his life. The only thing that kept him from spiraling into darkness was a small bouncing baby boy whose hair was often a bright blue and Ginny who always smiled so warmly at him no matter how she was feeling.
"Both... Maybe." Harry sighed. "He was a good guy. I miss him. A lot." Harry said softly. Hermione touched his arm lightly.
"Umm.. I told them I was going to be with you." Harry said. Draco stiffened slightly but they kept walking. "Well, I told them I'd be with the person I've been... Sneaking around with." Harry said with a shrug. "What about you? Where do Pansy and Blaise think you are?"
"I talked to other people that weren't Slytherin you know." Draco said. Harry didn't really know. Draco sighed. "Whatever. I told Reginald not to invite us. He did. I went to keep Pansy in line. If Ron hadn't tried to..." Draco paused. He knew blaming Ron wouldn't be a smart thing to say to his best friend who was now half glaring at him. "It doesn't matter though. Ron probably hates us even more now."
"We've had too much to drink." Draco said finally, his brain coming up with a million excuses for this situation.
Draco had hoped that by coming back and telling Harry to leave him alone, that he was done fighting the Chosen One, that Harry would leave him alone and eventually this aching need in his chest to be around him and his stupidly pretty eyes would subside. Harry would become some old crush that Draco would eventually move on from. It was a simple plan really but... Draco could feel Harry's eyes boring into his skull from across an entire room. The boy hardly paid attention in class, preferring above all else to just stare at Draco almost unblinkingly and it unnerved him.
but he comes out after only a month? I'm sure the rest will be the same. None of them will get the punishment they deserve and they deserve to suffer." Harry sighed. At one point he might have agreed with Ron but now... He was like Draco.
"Are you real?" Draco breathed out. Harry walked over and kneeled down next to Draco, pushing Draco's hair back lightly.
"Someone outside of our house then?" Ron said. "It has to be Penelope. She's been in love with you since first year."
"We haven't shagged yet." Harry said and as Dean choked on his food, Harry suddenly realized what he said. "I mean! Wait..." Harry said, wracking his brain.
Before, when Draco could pretend that he didn't like Harry, that he just liked making him angry, liked watched him scowl and narrow those emerald green eyes of his, it had been easy for him to ignore the underlying feelings of his that wrapped around the one and only Harry Potter. Harry didn't like him. This was a known fact for Draco. Draco had long given up any fantasies of him and the Chosen One being together. It was a stupid dream anyways. The thought of seeing Harry again this year was almost enough to make Draco never want to set foot in Hogwarts again but... Draco wanted to graduate. He wanted some sort of normalcy in his life and most of all, he wanted to get away from Malfoy Manor.
If ya'll don't like that... #Leave. I do really like all the actors that were cast for the movie though. But for the sake of this story, just a reminder that I'm imagining Harry and Hermione with dark skin and Harry with a large scar on his forehead.
"You had a lot more confidence the first time you were in my room." Draco said, shaking his head a little.
"You're both giving me fuckin' anxiety." Ron muttered, taking out his wand so he could light the cigarette. Harry smiled lightly at his best friend as strawberry smoke began to drift around them. "What are you too even doing out here. Don't you have class?" Ron demanded.
"That's when I said..."Seamus was saying before getting interrupted by the Great Hall doors being blown open dramatically, possibly by a spell. As they opened, everyone turned to look at the figure silhouetted in the morning light.
"I know." Hermione whispered. "I... This summer he seemed fine and..." Hermione took a deep breath and Harry could tell she was fighting back tears as well.
"It all happened pretty fast. Harry came back, Draco ran, the fighting started. Draco fought for our side though. I was next to him at one point. We were firing hexes at several Death Eaters." Luna paused. "His parents were among them. I think he hit them both with
"It was funny." Harry said with a snicker. "Come on babe, lets go hang out with our friends please. Invite Blaise and Pansy." Draco scoffed.
"Can I call you babe?" Harry said Draco's eye widened and he blushed hard which made Harry chuckle lightly. Draco swallowed hard and looked away.
"I heard from one of the other Ravenclaws that you two were doing... Unspeakable things. I beat the shit out of them for it and told them not to spread fucking rumors but it did get me thinking about you." Blaise said with a shrug. "You certainly don't look queer but... things started to make sense when I thought that you might be. Like why you would dump Pansy." Blaise said, gesturing to her. Pansy blushed red.
"Why don't you spell it down? Or use some damn gel like the rest of us." Draco said, rolling his eyes so hard Harry thought they might get stuck.
"I... What!" Harry shouted. "You're just being loud! I don't want people to hear." He said, gesturing towards the door.
"When you didn't show up last year. You, Weasley, and Granger... I knew you were up to no good. Voldemort was frantic when he realized you were trying to find those Horcruxs he thought were so cleverly hidden. He knew that he had left one here, in the Room of..." The name died in Draco's throat as he tried not to think about the growing wall of flames he thought would be the death of him.
"Lover boy? Hot stuff? Pumpkin? Darling?" Harry would have continued on for ages but Draco waved his wand at him and Harry suddenly found he couldn't speak. Was this another one of those American spells Draco had learned. Harry frowned at Draco whose teacup shook slightly in his hands.
"I just don't fancy the idea of my DNA being in someone who I don't care for." Harry started to laugh so hard Draco turned red. "It's not funny Harry! I'm being serious."
"And if it's something anyone would do, then why are you mad that that's what Draco did?" Ginny pointed out. "Would you have rather have him just walk on past her?" Ron scowled.
His parents were smothering him, his mother especially. She wrote a letter to Draco nearly every day asking him how he was and Draco couldn't reply fast enough. He had begun to wonder if his mother had taken to owling some of his friends or maybe the Headmistress herself to see if Draco was doing alright. He wouldn't put it past her. his mother had been especially troubled after he has so blatantly abandoned the Death Eaters in favor of Hogwarts and Harry.
"Rita wanted me to know. I think it was her way of saying that you'll basically be spying on us all the time now." Harry said. Pansy flipped her hair back.
. I want you all to myself. My father doesn't even know about me. Though... He'll probably know soon." Draco said, shaking his head. "He's still got dreams of little blond kids running around that look like me."
Harry was just about to throw on his invisibility cloak when Ron sat up in bed, scaring him half to death as he said, "Where are you going?"
"Yes, it would be funny. Now repeat after me." For the next minute, Draco and Harry mimicked one another in the pronunciation of
"But I saw.. Well I heard... Your parents were calling for you. Your mother was crying. Even if I wasn't dead why come back and fight for Hogwarts?" Harry said.
" Draco groaned, lightly pushing back on Harry's shoulder. Harry gave him a quizzical look before slipping off of Draco's lap. Draco sat up, refusing to look at Harry
. Everyone includes you Potter. I don't want to be up here with you talking about... Nonsense like this. I'd rather choke on-" Draco said.
"Prat." Blaise fired back with a wicked smile before exiting the room, closing the door behind him. Draco huffed and flopped onto his back on his bed.
"I wish you could meet them." Harry said. Draco felt like that was the sweetest thing the Chosen One could ever say to him. Draco cleared his throat and looked away from Harry's emerald green eyes.
"Yeah, sure." He said, rolling his eyes. "Hi." Harry said, his hands itching to touch Draco in some fashion. Draco's own hands were clenched into fists to prevent him from pushing Harry's hair out of his face. God he really wanted to run his fingers through it.
"No. I'm not leaving. These god damn Slytherins should. Just because they're eighth years like us doesn't mean they get to
"All he wants to do is bloody talk to you! It's all he can think about! You're going to make him fail seventh year, again." Harry was pretty positive he was going to fail as well. "Now will you just fucking talk to him." Harry swallowed hard and began to head out of the room. "Harry!" Pansy shouted, stamping her foot.
"She was pissed at me for running off with you two. But she understood why I had to do it." Harry paused. "When we came back, when everything was said and done... I thought we could just go back to normal again but... We can't. Everything just feels so much different now." Harry said softly.
