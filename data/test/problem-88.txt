Draco's lips turned into a scowl. Where was it Potter's business if he was hurt or not ? But He still gave a full body twirl, saying, "It hurts nowhere. I am fine"
" Oh . Wait , You can sense the people around you ? How ?"
"NO! I WASN'T! I FAINTED!"
Hedwig dropped six letters down in the bed as it landed on Harry's shoulder . He kindly brushed his palm over its feather before offering some treats as a payment and some more as a generous reward for the loyal beast's hard-work.
"Nothing ! Nothing at all ! Are your ears ringing or something ?", Harry's face furrowed with seeming worry.
The lessons were very valuable and precious. He was not only taught defence but also offence in both magical and physical sense. His views took a large turn after meeting Eloise and seeing some things he experienced and the illusion tests Eloise had him take broadened his views further.
In this chapter, we will see
Stunned ,he said ," Harry ! What are you doing here so late ? And what happened to Mr. Malfoy ?"
" This oldman in called Luar,  third son of the 5th generation of Malfoy Family" ;Luar replied.
" To interrogate your wife "
"Right now, Professor Snape and Madame Pomfrey are still tending to him. The best time to break in would be at midnight but Professor Snape might still be there. The Dinner might be next best. We could cover up for you.", Her voice was serious and reply accurate to Harry's need.
Harry's eyes widened before he swiftly reined in the surprise. His eyes turned more grim, more dark now.
" You.. you don't understand ! I…I told him !! I told him !! But ...he...I don't know….." Draco seemed agonised, tortured with the sneer and frown marring his pale face. The reluctance was clear in his pained eyes. He was unwilling but had no other option. The chains of fate were binding him. Now his only hope was the green-eyed allied acquaintance yet unknown stranger. But Draco was rapidly losing much faith in this rescue.
Draco was well aware of the impending near future. He didn't have much time to make further elaborate and foolproof plan. This was his only chance. He had to get the dark mark out.
Hope you like it !
It was then that his magic felt the familiar presence come closer.
He dusted his clothes while standing up, "I had thought that you atleast had a little bit of intelligence inside that donkey brain! But no! You don't even have that! Look where you got us now!"
"I do have a want. But, it is not a want to take from you but to give. I wish to give you my knowledge. I have been searching for centuries for a person willing and able to pass my knowledge to, but found none. Today is the first time I see someone so suitable, in both character and strength to be my successor. So tell me, child. Do you wish to accept this blessing that I send ? I do not wish to haste you. But remember, even if this gives you a power few could imagine, it's not a path of weak. If you have even an ounce of hesitation, then leave. I won't stop you even if you are the last person that could be my successor. I see that you have a need that cannot be given by this room. You need power, don't you ? To kill your enemies, To protect your near and dear. Power always follows effort. So do you wish ?"
Neville didn't know what happened but he saw Blaise's eyes soften. The eyes scanned his face slowly before the wand was in his palm again.
The small globes moved quickly and quietly making their way to every corner of the room. Minutes passed and Harry counted in his head ,
A silence sang before the wise grunt of an old king rang out. " Draco , You are no assassin "
Hermione hugged the round shoulders in her arm, pulling the girl outside. Stopping at the threshold, Hermione looked back at Harry, her gaze shining weird but mischievously teasing, "The moon is asleep and the night thieves his soft touches, isn't it, Harry?"
After taking a moment to ready himself , Draco spoke quietly in a barely heard mumble. But Harry heard it loud and clear.
How is it going  ? Here is the 15th chapter!
Behind them Ron said , " Bleeding , he didn't get enough money for it , Is it ? "
" Sir , I trust him "
With a jerk , he came back to himself. Gripping Harry's wrist , he said in a desperate voice ," wait "
Dumbledore's raised wand flew out of his hand to collide with the nearby wall, making a crisp sound.
Hermione's response was prompt as barriers after barriers rose into the air around them, trapping them in a protective dome.
. Why was his reaction so different for Malfoy ? What did he have to make Harry behave in such an abnormal way ? Why was Harry's own body defying his will for Malfoy ? First was the incident in the girl's lavatory and now this . What was wrong with Harry ? No . What was wrong with Malfoy ?
" Hmm…. How is his health now ?"
Draco looked at the two chatting idlers and his cute Theo trapped between them. A sense of danger rose in his heart. It almost felt like seeing his own sweet child being wooed away by disgusting boys. Suddenly, the Weasley twins seemed much less pleasant than before.
Giving them a very rare and small smile  , Draco placated them ," I am fine . It's nothing a nap cannot cure.  Just found some very interesting books yesterday and spent the night reading them ."
Soon, the warm red blood flowed from his hand and landed on the egg who eagerly absorbed it .
Crimson rose in Draco's cheeks and ears and a scowl rose on his lips out of habit,
" LIKE NOTHING ! YOU SHAMELESS IMBECILE !"
Harry followed immediately saying, " Blaise and Neville will be the ones staying behind "
A cunning light flashed in her eyes. She slowly looked towards the dumbstruck Pansy.
In the camp, Draco had completed what he was doing and realised that more than 20 minutes had passed but Pansy didn't return.
And did you guys catch the para above the T/N note ? How many inneudos did you guys find ????
The slender neck was an enchantment in its own . A thirsty mouth instantly opened wide , going for the salty elixir dripping down that jade-like neck . Harry licked , kissed and bit the fair skin .
They ran , tumbling into the block one after the other. A spell flew towards the unsuspecting Hermione and Pansy who was beside her acted quickly and covered her with her entire body. " Ahhh ! " A pained shout rang out.
But when Draco tried to pull back his hand, Harry gripped it tight and looked into his eyes, saying.
Just as he was about to sit up, a voice said, "You woke up?"
Setting himself in the darkness , he moved forward in the blackness. It was then that a swift wind passed by him.
" And who is Draco ? "
Draco silently closed his eyes and waited for the next instruction when he felt a foreign entity entering his body and mind , mixing in his blood and seeping in his magic . He felt searing pain in his body . His brow frowned and mouth pressed in a straight line . He could feel his brain burning from the inside and his magic stirring endlessly . He bit his tongue in an effort to not let any scream escape his throat and soundless whimpered.
No ! Neville didn't know ! What was his worst nightmare personified doing here ?!
Below the scene, Harry sighed with relief as he lowered his wand. The wand tip was still heated and glowing orange like melting iron. Even if the relief was clear in his eyes, the vengeance was as well. The eyes as sharp as a two-sided sword gazed at the quickly retreating figures as one of them cast the grey clouds to shape into a skull and the slim tall man with wide eyes and a confused face. The confusion and guilt was seen on his wan face . Maybe for the requested killing of his mentor. Or maybe for the death of a tragic and helpless innocent, a student, a child. A young man whose only fault was that he was born to his own mother and father.
His gaze returned to the glowing moon hiding behind towering trees surrounding them,
Alas, Even if Pansy was right. Hermione was Harry's friend and sister, not Draco's like Pansy was. This is the difference between both of them. If this relationship went wrong, the one to be trapped would be Draco, so Pansy opposed this relationship. While if this relationship didn't start, Harry will be the one who sinks into the darkness and insanity, so Hermione supported this.
Harry lost the last of his strength as the snake coiled around his body, choking and crushing him. His breath was slowly suffocating and his sight was turning black.
Draco was looking around when he heard the precise tapping of boots and at once he froze. His body tightening, getting ready to flee at the slightest hint of danger.
The shopkeeper squinted her eyes, "Hmm. Let's see. This is one of the best items I have got. So, how about 10 galleons ?"
Touching Harry's nose , he asked guiltily ," Did it hurt when I hit you ? Does it still hurt ?"
She is such a despicable person. She knows that no one in this world is an angel. Even she isn't such a pure saint.
Harry got up from the bed and the warm body it nestled and reluctantly walked away to open the windows. As soon as the glass opened, an owl flew inside carrying several letters.
At this, Draco wasn't surprised about her being right. It was Christmas eve afterall. It was logical for her to make such a guess. But what made him frown was the obvious surety in her tone. She seemed awfully obnoxious to him but at least she respected manners.
Harry got up as well, " Should we go to check ? Are you sure ? What if she didn't finish and just needed more time ?"
During this period, Harry was in constant contact with all the six people in their circle and things were going according to his plan.
Pansy lifted her eyes to look at him and said respectfully, " Dolohov and Ralph "
His father stepped back while holding his arm , as if his mother's frail arms broke his bones  .
Harry: "..."
In this chapter we will see,
As if fate, His gaze landed on a black and white picture. It was a picture of two young men, one tall and the other slightly taller. Draco quickly realized that the taller boy was the one Harry asked Ms. Bagshot about. his gaze travelled to the bottom of the picture where it read-
" Ah - yes . Don't worry . I am fine . " ; Draco said , blinking out from his daze .
He was losing all his hope as his vision was slowly fading. Draco was going to die , he knew it. Well, at least he tried.
Harry opened the door and entered .
"They -....", Neville wanted to deny but abruptly stopped when he saw how Blaise's eyes darkened with gloom. He looked down and softly continued, "Some of them call me names. But they never tried to hurt me. They just say some... things. That's all. Such things won't affect me"
"Understood ?"
But Pansy had enough , saying with a scowl and gritted teeth , " He won't listen like this "
No, this wasn't euphoric pleasure . It was euphoria itself. It was purely mind numbing euphoria , Draco learnt.
" Child, Are you sure ? That too so suddenly ?"
Soon a pair of very drunk men were singing heartbreak songs . Harry was lazily resting in the background enjoying the skit.
- Dursley move out .
Harry's throaty voice alight with the promise of danger and threat , asked , "Have you seen this before?"
Ron :  ( 0 ∆ 0 )
He tremblingly moved to turn around but froze when he felt a cold breath on his back. His mouth opened to scream. But before he could , his body was forcibly pushed down and a spell hit him. He very clearly felt the sting on his nape as his limbs spread apart like a stick figure and bound in place. It was a body-binding spell.
And this is when in the land of the dead , an old blond lady was looking into a wide mirror to see a young blond boy . Hearing him , she exclaimed ," This boy !!! Grew up to be such an unfilial brat ! Bribing his own dead grandmother ! He must have learn it from that idiot father of his ! I am going to curse Lucius from here ! He spoiled my good grandson !!! That good for nothing show-off son of mine ! He and his father , both the same !!! My dear Draco was such a sweet boy ~ grew to be such a gremlin ! HMPH !!! "
"AHHHHHHHHHH!", A childish shrill cry interrupted Harry and Draco as a slimy hand slapped Draco on his forearm.
The oldman was rambling far and fast. Eloise had a favourable impression of Draco from the start. The reason for this is still unknown to him but something in him stirs at the sight of that boy's pale skin and blond hair. They seem so dear to him but still so strange.
A wide eyed and open mouthed Hermione said dumly , " I am not stupid"
At this point, Draco was sure that there was something wrong with the lady's head. Either way, out of curiosity, he still opened the small box handed by the shopkeeper. Inside the small box, lay four grey opal beads. All of them were strikingly similar. The only difference was the colorful wisps inside them.
Draco silently ignores . There were no sticks here . It must be his illusion.
The position of Draco had increased unanimously since the revelations back at the Grimmuald place. He was now even more preferably towards Draco, more so than Harry who was his actual master.
The old hag looked at the frame, stilling for a second before pointing towards the stairs, beckoning him to follow.
" Are you going to read my mind again?"
George who was standing in front, answered, "when someone tries to hide their hunger"
Hello, Readers,
Pansy continued till she was satisfied , saying after, "How can a Lady wander around with a tear streaked face and snot dripping down her nose ? Huh ? I don't know what you did till now, Granger, but now that you are with us , such behaviour and display of weakness should stop. It's unsightly. Ladies do not cry, no matter what. We remain graceful and poised even in the face of death"
Harry gave a deep amd amused chuckle , " It has been getting worse now a days, you know "
Draco turned around as the woman hurriedly took out a small box from the drawers below the desk and handed it to him. He curiously looked at the box and then at the lady.
"Yes "
Draco again looked at the man to see him looking at Draco with adoration in his eyes . And he stilled for a second . When was the last time someone looked at him like that ? When was the last time someone looked at him with the gaze of an elder looking at the child of his family ? Then he remembered . It was probably in third year . So long ago .At this time , Draco realised truly how lonely he was , how he was forced to  grow up sooner , how many responsibilities were on his tender shoulders . But , then again , it wasn't just him . It was all of them . Potter , Granger , Weasley , Blaise , Pansy , everyone . They were children of war.  Here , they either grow up or die . It was the truth and Draco understood that .
As they soon entered and queues for the ….toilet ….. Ron's head swirled and eyes twitched from thinking about how they were supposed to aparate.
Harry smiled, this time genuinely as he said ," How can that be? You still have to prepare the dowry for the wedding, won't you? Also, I am sure the next generation of Potters would like to see their great-grandfather."
Fortunately, the wound wasn't deep enough to show bones or else moving forward with him would have been impossible.
And how many ? I was actually thinking 3 including eggie . Please answer in the comments !!!
No ! Obviously , it isn't !
How could he lie to Neville like this ?! Did he think that Neville was a fool enough to believe such an obvious lie ?
Even if Harry knew that this was a journey which will inevitably wear Draco out, it was necessary. Harry was still not 17 then and still had the ministry's tracing charm on him. Using any magic would have directly alerted their enemies and given out their location . While Harry was able to use magic in Potter manor because of its protective charms and barriers , he could not do the same outside. Fortunately, Draco and the other six were all above 17 already and he completed the 16th year of his life as soon as the clock struck eleven tonight, which was the time of his birth.
" We need to talk " ; Harry said in a resolut tone ,leaving no space for refusal .
– [ Hogward's School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, Scotland ]
In the middle, Draco was trying his best to gauge the situation of eggie and at the same time forcibly stopping Nagini's poison from spreading in Harry's body.
"I don't know the future but I will take it back for now " , answered Malfoy in a troubled tone .
"Yes"
Such effects are rarely caused due to spells and curses and are mostly due to poisons and potions as well as diseases.
" Come in "; Hagrid said , opening the door wide to invite the pair of students and a professor.
And let him tell you, this is no simple thing! This magical phenomena, namely,
Seeing that Harry was staring at his father , his mother said in an angry voice while hitting him  ," James , What did you do ? Why did my baby cry ?"
Draco's struggles increased. At this point, he wildly flailed his arms and legs around, hitting harry, shouting insults at him, doing anything that could help get him free. But all of this could not even budge his captor.
He had never seen this kind of jewellery before . Was it men's or was it women's ? Maybe it was a hair ribbon ?
After Ron left , Harry's attention went  back to the delectable body on his bed , wrapped in his blankets. Wandlessly , He switched the clothes Draco wore with his shirt and shorts . Neatly folding the uniform dropped on the ground and keeping it on his desk before changing his own clothes .
" That's all fine. But , Mate , I think we should not let him go . What if something like this happens again and someone attacks him ?! "
Pansy looked in horror as a shameless hooligan unhesitatingly slipped under the covers with Draco.
His magic nervously covered her entire body. He soon found a trace of magic stuck in her chest, a spell. He quickly raised his wand to spell the counter-spell and the tip of his wand touched her forehead.
" Hmm. They were probably aiming for Potter , having guessed that since you were there he might be as well. Good , that fortune was on our side this once " ; Draco acknowledged.
" Good night "
Draco lay on the wet bathroom floor, the water pooling around him. His own blood seeping out of his burns and mixing in the water beneath. The skin which was moments ago as pale and smooth as jade, now looked red and black with cripples on it like wrinkled cotton. His ragged breath echoed in the enclosed space, serving as a witness to his pain and life seeping away. For an instant, something like relief shone in his eyes.
Harry promptly raised his wand, ready to apparat himself. When suddenly -
" Yes , all the other rooms in the mansion are dirty and untidy. This elf didn't know that Master Harry would be coming back so this elf didn't clean. Please punish this elf !!" The shrill voice hurriedly said and a good natured smile graced Harry's face, totally antonymous from the glare a minute ago .
As the rhythmic beat in the hallway grew near , Harry's steps grew heavier. Enter the hall, he was met with the sight of a group of about 70-100 people robotically …. stapling magazines ? The way they moved was mechanical , stiff and regular , precisely in sync. They seemed like someone cursed them with a dark , forbidden curse. And maybe they did.
Ron refused to meet Harry's gaze . He didn't need such a friend who hurt him .  Understanding Ron's refusal , Harry still continued ," When I hurt you tell me who tried his best to stop me even if it meant he could possibly get the same treatment ?"
Harry looked down at the small body in  Draco's arms, "She's already asleep."
"Merlin… What will I do with you, Potter ?", He sighed with exasperation. These over-dramatics are really giving him a headache. "Let's go. Where do you want to visit first ?"
" Good ,  it has been a long tradition in The Pheonix Warriors  . My master had me take it . I will have you take it . This test is made to push your limits in the most overwhelming way . It may be your deepest desire or your greatest fear or all of it together . I do not have tricks or clues to give you , kid. This is all about you . The only piece of advice I give you is -  no matter what , Do Not Give Up . Keep going even if you feel you can't anymore . "
Hermione was defeated, "Just be careful. The night shouldn't wrong his moon. Lest he loses him forever."
- Last but not the least , Ron being dumb .
Determined , Draco spoke drawing the man's attention towards himself again ," respected ancestor , why don't you come with me ? Maybe the one you are waiting for is trapped somewhere and is unable to come ? You should leave this place and find him !"
" Finete Incantatem . Okay "
As if remembering something , Ro quickly stopped short , pulling Mary to stand still with him as well and said hurriedly moved , " Mary , go home and get the kids. I'll come to you. We need to get out of the continent "
Hi , Folks !
Something was wrong.
" Yes. That is precisely the topic I was going to talk about "
Ignoring the reaction, Pansy leaned forward , pressing her entire front on Hermione's back.
(Your father's eggs*- another stupid slang .)
literally written on his forehead. Harry made a weird sight for his friends and students around him and it was even weirder when they noticed that this gaze was directed towards Draco who was scowling back like he is gonna chew him whole. The students around looked from Harry to Draco and then again to Harry. They kept looking back and forth as if watching a tennis match .
" There are many idiots in this world. Stupid people who trust blindly and suffer terribly. And we are in no hurry to join their team. Don't you agree ?"
Draco stared at Harry, processing what he heard. Not believing that Harry would take it upon himself to interrogate him and even more so after hearing his question. He could not make the head or tail of Harry's question but it was the answer that made his heart squeeze all over again. Seconds passed and Draco eventually said, "What is it to you, Potter? Looking for another chance to show off your heroism?", He said in an equally monotone voice, all the while struggling to get out of bed. To get away from the question, away from Harry.
The bus was already still. They hurriedly got up and made their way out before it departed again.
-Dr. Shipper.
The cupid's arrow pierced cleanly through a beating heart, flowing beautiful scarlet blood.
Interjecting between their conversation, Draco said," Wait , you can't really be thinking of going alone ."
" Sorry … you just don't look the same as yourself anymore ”
" Well , I do but it is rather unsuitable for you ."
A fulfilling family was what he yearned for. But he was grateful that he was never granted this wish and instead achieved a family thousand times better. He had a family who loved him unconditionally , not because he was their own blood or because they shared the same surname , but because they loved him. The family he had now was solely there because of unconditionally love and loyalty mingled with pride and happiness shared between them.
" It's nothing, dad . I just missed you so much ."
He rapidly wrote long letters, including each and every warning he could remember in both the parchments while making Neville's a little longer. Afterall, while Blaise was an acquaintance and newly formed ally l, Neville was someone Harry instinctively protected and looked after. He was the small shy little brother of the entire Gryffindor tower and Harry inherently saw him as the same. Finishing them and keeping them aside, Harry got up with the intention to sleep as well.
Unknowingly , a tear had slipped from his eyes .
Hermione silently sat beside an asleep Pansy. The girl had come distraught to her tent in the middle of the night after finding that Draco had disappeared.
"It means that I am not fucking married to you ! Only a married couple are supposed to-"
Blaise looked at the soft face. The eyes looking at him were terrified and flew wide. Something in them had Blaise softening, relaxing. It had him backing down.
Giving his papa a satisfied grin and getting one in return as well , he moved on the next task .
The man then flushed and Ron was grateful that his toilet seemed to be unused to anything other than aparating.
Ron silently lifted his wand. Coincidentally, his eyes caught the gaze of his elder brother, George . George was rapidly making his way towards Ron with Fred at his side. His face frowning and lips shouting something that couldn't be heard in the ruckus around, as if he knew what Ron was going to do. And probably , Ron thought, he might actually know.
Ron sat on the old chair in front of the grand dusty piano as Hermione sat beside him. She watched as he crudely played the tune of
Entering the Headmaster's office , Harry saw the elder sitting behind his desk. Hearing his entrance , Headmaster Dumbledore looked up to see his dear pupil .
"How is it ?" ; Ron silently whispered, afraid to startle him.
"Ah, that. Well, you touched one of my inscribes and teleported here through the array below it. But, unfortunately, the array is quite old and rusty, also the installment of a bigger array around the section caused it to become unstable and take a toll on your body. But do not worry, little one. I am already trying my best healing you. Though I am slower as I am a soul,  I can still heal you well."
The death eaters were here.
With a burning glare, Draco answered, " Feeding it "
"Mom , I have to go ."
Neville's eyes flew towards the familiar voice. Blaise stood behind the death eaters, drawing their attention with a smile on his face as if making regular conversations about weather.
" ahhh…. yeah . It was nice to meet you " and ran as fast as he could.
" STAND DOWN " , a chilling voice boomed .
" Master Harry !"
" How did you do that ?" ; Voice only a hushed whisper , Potter asked .
Option A : Kiss her some more
The smile on Umbridge's face slowly disappeared , replacing itself with a disgusted sneer .
"Offerings?"
In this chapter, we will see ,
. He knew that it might not actually taste like this but this what he imagined and he did admit that it tasted a bit like Mrs. Weasley's , since she was his only inspiration for the taste of a mother's hand.
Harry thought and a rush of joy filled him as well.
"No . But that woman was a veela . I saw scars on her back. Her wings were ripped out and considering the wounds on her body , she must have been tortured ." ; Draco presented his analysis .
" Thankyou "
But after some time, Draco noticed that eggie wasn't absorbing his blood anymore and it was trailing down the white shell freely.
Breaking the silence, Draco said , " I am glad that all of you have your arms and legs and are not overly furry ."
With a delight , he called ," Oh! Harry ! What brings you----" But was stunned into silence when a saw who was hiding behind Harry.
Laying him down, Harry sat beside him, cradling him. It was then that he sensed that another presence was beside Draco. Looking up, he saw an elderly blond soul sporting a worried frown. The man took one of the potions kept aside and poured it into Draco's mouth and lifted his chin up to force it down his throat.
She watched as her parents' eyes turned unfocused and dazed as they went into a stupor while her wand hungrily ate their memories of her.
Draco gave a sigh and said , " Theo , don't think. Just say it "
His eyes held years of exhaustion but also shone an euphoric satisfaction. He slowly closed his eyes, ready to leave behind this materialistic world to ascend in the kingdom of souls.
Blaise, who was utterly shocked at the display of such rare rage, looked at the stumbling boy. His brain was stuck but instincts weren't. He quickly pulled Neville back on the bed and tightly held him as he tried to struggle away.
Making up his mind, Harry walked in and almost fell back with shock.
, his fingers unused to being soft and gentle.
" What about it ?" Came back a confused answer.
The environment again fell silent. Harry stood up with Malfoy in a princess carry to walk out after saying," We should get him somewhere to rest. Both of you should hide"
In this air of infectious joy, the one walking beside him looked so lonely. His green eyes dulled by sorrow and longing.
(See the end of the chapter for
" I was assigned a mission…. an assassination…. of Headmaster Dumbledore."
Draco listened to the far-away song, the voices of young and old, men and women mixing together.
As they again turned on the way, the old hag had travelled a few dozen steps ahead of them. Draco and Harry quickly made a joint effort to keep up. Soon, they found themselves entering an old and depleted cottage. The inside was messy with dust and mud everywhere. It seemed impossible to imagine that someone lived here had they not seen the old hag. The inside was dark, no candles or lights were lit, and an unpleasant stench penetrated every knock and crevice.
"ISN'T IT OBVI-"
Every step he took away from them felt like walking through fire , every breath felt like he was infaling the same fire which was burning his skin  . He was hurting from inside-out .
" No effect "
Draco slumped back in his chair. When can he finally make sense of that idiot's word ? That man has been putting his brain in tangles since he was eleven and now, even more so .
Before leaving, Draco quickly took out eggie from his portable ring to give him his share of breakfast . As he watched his warm blood fulfilled the appetite of this small being he cherished. He had come to care of eggie quite too much. Who wouldn't  love this Ball of pure cuteness ?! Even Draco wasn't resilient to eggie's charm.
Harry was confused, "But didn't you say that you could ?"
A herbal scent floated through the haze and he remembered the silver hair and scorching eyes.
he thought as he continued to search for something suitable for Harry.
Harry carefully picked up Draco and laid him down on the bed . It was then that he saw the wet patch in his trousers. A shuddering breath passed through Harry's dry throat into his chest cooling his hot blood mystically boiling there.
" Did I do everything intentionally to get you free ? Yes. Yes , I did. Being nice or good to you wasn't something I could ever do if I wanted you to live. I could only be cruel , crueler or the cruelest. I chose to be cruel so that one of the few genuine faces I remembered from my childhood wasn't dead before my eyes. What I didn't expect was for Potter to get my task done so fast "
Neville was confused but eager to be the source of warmth for the boy….no, the man in front of him. The task to comfort a man who has suffered the world and the society is almost impossible for Neville. So he used the tactic Blaise had used minutes ago to comfort him.
"Eggie", both of them said at once.
Blaise was the first to look away as he gave a shallow cough. His gaze travelled to look at where his hand still loosely gripped Neville's waist.
The next morning, Draco woke up nice and warm in his covers . Looking around, he noticed that it was barely dawn but Harry's bed was empty . He was still dreamy and confused when Harry came in through the door carrying a tray of fulfilling breakfast .
A strong hand supported his waist as he rested his back on broad reliant shoulders.
As more and more of the poison was sucked out, the pain in Harry's body resided and his condition stabled.
"Now , put your magic into it to claim ownership. "
" Well - yes . Potter said that you might need some assistance since you probably will not be in the right state of mind after ….. what you...just had to do and all"
Harry looked with worry and solemnly said, "Something is wrong. You should leave first."
Questions jumbled in his head. Why was Draco crying? What happened? What was he himself feeling? It was as if the arrows were shot but without an aim.
"I...yes. Sorry, I inconvenienced you earlier "
Days have been going fairly good for Draco but a stale smell still lingered in the air . It was the feel of incoming doom that hovered over Hogwarts . Everyone was walking on eggshells these days , their instincts warning them about the wrong winds .
This confused Harry as he screwed his brows together and asked," Dowry?"
-Harry reveals his hooligan side.
" Am I healed ?"
The moment Eggie landed in Draco's arms, Nagini lunged towards Harry, aiming with a deadly strike. It's agile body moving fast. The sight of the egg distracted Harry as his eyes moved away from the snake. Nagini took this chance and lunged !
It was as if a bucket of ice water was poured on Draco's head.
He hugged her one last time and looked at his dad to see him looking at Harry with the same sad smile as his mother .
" Why did you become a death Eater  ?" This was the question that had been up in Harry's head for a long time , it had been there like a poison , slowly flowing through his blood , spreading across his body , as it maddened him more and more everyday .
" What do you mean ?" Asked a breathless but equally confused and still angry Draco.
Suggestions and tips are appreciated as well as in dept reviews. You can write as long and big as you want !!!  I live for your words guys !
Also, Did you agree upon Harry's POV where he was grateful that Draco is a Malfoy because of which people couldn't take advantage of his beauty and dare not lust after him. As the author of the book and as a woman of this generation, I feel that it is actually very right in true world as well. People will inevitable try to take advantage of a beautiful person, male or female, if they get a chance. That's why, according to me, a beauty without poison to protect themselves is the same as a beauty ruined and dirtied.
Slughorn jumped with a startled shout before looking behind to spot Harry with an unconscious Draco .
Hermione was first to speak, " Everything happened as planned . Now, a atmosphere of fear and terror is in the school as well as everyone positively believes that Draco and Headmaster are dead "
Seconds later , the sound of the toiled being flushed and Harry and Ron flushing in it like stinking shit rang out from adjacent stalls .
" I knew it was dark . But something this dark , this evil . I did not expect it. " Dumbledore said suddenly.
Draco rolled his eyes and dropped 10 galleons on the desk, "Since I really liked these pieces of rock, then 10 galleons it is." With that Draco turned to leave.
Did he really cry on Harry? Was yesterday really not an absurd dream? Before Draco was sure that it was a dream, but now met with such a gaze, he wavered and doubted himself. At this moment Draco really wanted to crack Harry's brain open and see what's inside. Maybe even slip poison in his food to ensure the matter hushed once and for all. His doubtful gaze looked at Harry squinting like a cat. He searched for any abnormal signs but found none. Seeing this Draco relaxed slightly , thinking that his pureblood young master, the Malfoy heir and the perfect Slytherin pride was still intact and he did not cry like a princess in the hero's arms in reality. Just thinking that he dreamt this was shameful enough that he could feel his ears burn, the horror of it being reality was too much for Draco to handle, so much so that he would leave the nose-less devil to rot and find ways to strangle Harry and bury his body.
" Oh ! Harry ! "
Harry was still confused, "No?"
In the following days, Draco had tried his best to treat and help the comastat headmaster to no effect. Days were going busy and lonely for Draco . Everyday he used to practice his potion making skills , then read books and then practice dueling.He was striving to achieve his goal . To fulfill the promise he made to himself . He was going to become stronger , stronger than Harry . So that when he will be standing beside Harry, he won't feel that he was unworthy.
Draco was on his own on the edge of forbidden forest trying remedy spells on small injured and infected animals .
Draco's nose rose even higher, "As you should be."
Draco walked closer and this time Harry did not stop him but stood in place keeping his eyes on the woman for any movement . He knelt beside her and lightly felt her pulse and found a thin and very weak pulse . He couldn't have noticed if not for his recent practice on different species of creatures . She was still alive but only barely . Looking again at her , he noticed that she had two slanted wounds in her shoulder bone . Her bone was clearly visible and looked like a piece of it was ripped out .
Harry realised that Draco's insults - no , Draco himself was like a flower of poppy to Harry. He was irresistibly drawn to him , still longed for him even if he knew that having any more of him will trap Harry in those deadly eyes.
Harry stood up as well, "So, we can set off tomorrow evening?"
" Ahhh ! " Ron shouted before shutting himself up.
"What should we do ?" Harry asked .
From beside him, the vicious and poisonous giggle of Umbridge echoed , settling the fear deeper into the heart of the audience.
"Right , before that ,  Let's go over the rules . Let me get the father-feeling as well !"
His voice croaked and stretched, " M~undungus. Mundungus Fletcher "
Hello readers,
In his heart Draco felt incredibly smug ,
and Ron stood there stumped.
After a fierce battle that he won, Draco's body and brain finally gave out, collapsing completely.
" Any clue to what it is ?" Draco asked.
As the elf dwelled in his chaotic thoughts , he didn't notice that Harry was still waiting for his answer .
And Draco slowly willed his body up and down, all the while trying to keep the sobs in. His body trembled and withered as he repeatedly impaled himself on the huge girth. His heart felt as if it was ripped out and stepped on. He had never thought that he would be humiliated like this, used like this. He wanted to die. Dying was better than this but how could he when he knew what Harry would do to his mother, to Blaise and Pansy if he died. What had his life become? When had death become a luxury?
The plate was soon emptied. And Draco, who was trying hard to stay awake and keep vigil with Harry, felt the heavy weight of slumber ruthlessly pressing on his lids. Not even several minutes passed, when Draco lost the battle and fell asleep entirely.
The blood red lips moved to leisurely utter," Ahh. Look what we have here "  The sound of her voice made chills pass through one's spine. It was apparent that the sight of Headmaster Dumbledore weak and at the door of death pleased her sick heart immensely.
With slow and unhurried words, Blaise spoke, "I didn't lie. I have no paramours or lovers. Never had any, in fact. But that doesn't mean that what those people say is false. What you say just now is an illusion I made. I often trick these extremely persistent ‘paramours’ like this to make them feel that they have visited my bed. But I- I never actually touched any of them….."
Harry solemnly nodded, "Yes. Voldemort wanted something from this man. He was torturing him for it. But the man didn't have it and was murdered by voldemort."
Draco was shocked at first and then thankful . In a time like this , every comfort was a privilege . He could not physically feel the touch but he could feel a cool sensation , like a summer breeze brushing his skin . He understood that it was the man's magic . He could feel it comforting him as he was completely enveloped in it .
(See the end of the chapter for
Ron's face shifted and returned to his original one as the woman kissing him let go . Her eyes confused and wide.
Harry thought as Draco , unable to realise the hellish turmoil he was wrecking in Harry's brain , looked up to him with glassy blushing eyes and blinked, fluttering his curly wet tresses. His lips parted to display a small red tongue resting there, as if a sweet sensual fruit soaked in flowery wine to create an aphrodisiac for every sense - sight, touch, taste, smell and sound,  just waiting to be consumed with delight.
" Well..…. Looks like we need to hurry even more " , Harry said , gears already wheeling in his head.
But before anyone could do anything ,the first spell was shot , " Stupefy ! " The spell accurately fit Umbridge , making her freeze.
Draco: "..."
Standing before the four-posture bed , Harry slowly parted the curtains . Inside lay Draco deep in his sleep , buried under the covers and a large white egg tucked under his arm . The sight unknowingly brought him a deep solace .
His brows scrunched as he thought . Who? Who? It was on the tip of his tongue when the image of bronze skin and evil mischievous eyes flashed in his head.
" I don't know. It was fine before this. ", Draco answered similarly wary but more trusting because of it's company through the months. He knew that it was different and might be dangerous but also knew that it was more like a pitiful lost child .
Harry forcefully jerked his own hand and took on the cold and hard mask he had when in the company of others.
" Draco , we know that a lot is going on and you are trying but please don't make yourself sick . We as well as you cannot afford it ." Blaise followed practically .
"Where ? Are you going to Ron ?"
Name      - Draco Lucius Malfoy
" Why did you hit me ?!"
Draco was sitting on his bed . A book was floating in front of him but his eyes looked empty . He did not seem to realise Harry's presence even after he took off the cloak .
" Found him unconscious in the forest, sir . He was attacked by something and lost consciousness. Wanted to take him to Hagrid's to rest "
" And the ring ?"
" What does this have to do with removing the dark mark ?" ; Losing his temper , Draco hissed angrily . If not for his roommates sleeping just beyond the covers , he would have shouted it out .
A deep breath blew Draco's worry out , "That's a relief "
also included below it. HAHAHA !!! It would be hilarious , wouldn't it ?
Bathing and getting ready , Harry made his way to the great hall with Ron and Hermione in tow .
Hermione's mouth opened to let out a quivering breath, with a whispered voice she tried to say ,
With the reassurance , Neville again buried his head against the soft cloth and began to drift away. As he was about to fall asleep again, the same voice whispered again with a giggle, " Were you tired all   day?"
A month has easily gone by . In this time, Draco has been actively improving his skills and knowledge by practice and experimentation.
" Okay . Okay " ,Ron said , before taking hesitant and unnoticeable shivering steps towards the sound of rain.
At this Draco opened his eyes and scanned Harry's handsome face before again shutting his lids to say
Draco was startled at the voice but an unknown something did not let him panic. It was like someone had fed him a calming potion to stabilize all his emotions. Extreme fear and anger were impossible, a struggle even more so. As Draco relaxed and regained some of his rationality, he immediately started a round of rapid fire nearly enabling his captor, as he believed, from catching up.
Then, Draco gently opened his mouth to place it on the wound and cautiously started to suck.
Such moments were the ones that kept him up all these years. It wasn't food that nourished him or medicine that healed him, it was all this. These moments he had with people around him. Let it be the frequent scolding from professor McGonagall or the cheer from his quidditch team. All of this was what kept him alive, kept him as Harry and not the saviour.
Draco opened his eyes to see the face of a panicked Harry. His eyes darting up and down Draco's form, repeatedly chanting the reverse spell to no effect. Draco's blood was still flowing freely. He did not have much time. He was dying. He wanted to tell Harry about his newfound revelation before leaving him forever.
"WHY WERE YOU ASLEEP?!", Draco returned seething.
Hedwig relaxed and nestled on the foot of Harry's bed and Harry decided to let the bird rest before his next journey tomorrow morning .
Draco very lucidly knew that you can object when someone asks a question or suggestion. But even persuading someone who is simply informing you of a simple fact is not possible.
" Oh ! I would be delighted !~"
Harry watched as Draco's whole body convulsed . The warmth at his arms length, twitching at the slightest brush of his magic , felt incredibly enticing to him. It was as if Draco's magic, soul and body was calling to him. Just like how the scent of wine drew a drunkard , Draco was drawing him. All he wanted was to encase Draco in more of his magic and more of himself.  So that's what he did.
Ensuring that she was alright, Draco lifted his gaze from where he was kneeling, "Who did this to her ?"
The reluctant croak sounded , " it was here..... in this house "
Soft hiccups and panting breaths were the only indication of his turmoil and agony midst of this luxury provided to him. He was adorned by red robes and tended with the most expensive oils and scented soaps. But midst these, there shined a stunning gold on his body , gold binding his wrists and ankles. These gold cuffs which were embedded with rubies and emeralds and craves with charms were a constant reminder. A reminder that he did not belong to himself anymore . That he was nothing more than a property, a medal decorating another.
Draco sat in an elaborate and beautifully carved bed in the Potter Mansion. His being clad in silk robe and surrounded by soft fur . His hair splayed freely over his shoulders and back .
Hermione could hear the urgency and anxiety in his voice. Her brows frowned at the sudden worry she sensed for Draco in the voice. But Hermione was a smart girl, she knew when to step ahead and when to step back.
Pansy made her way towards the shocked still Hermione. Her brows frowned as her lips repeatedly moved to utter words one after another. And it was as if Hermione's brain had shut down. She didn't hear or understand anything. She stood there, body still but eyes following the beauty, just like a sunflower stupidly following the sun.
Harry still gave him a very careful look before he believed that Draco was truly well. And Finally, the breath painfully stuffed in his burning chest escaped, cooling the mind and heart as well.
Draco still remembered how he used to gaze at Harry in potions class. The situation had defied him the wish to befriend him, to have a chance to gain his trust and love, to be a trusted one to him like Ron Weasley was. But what could he have done? He could either be a pureblood death Eater or a torture experiment sample for other death eaters.
" But it's mine !" , The defiance and sulk in Neville's voice was heard loudly.
Draco speculated if he should tell Harry or not. Then thought , Fuck it ! He already made a mutual blood pact with Harry. He can't do anything to harm Draco.
Your mother's eggs* !!! He saw !!! What to do now ??!!
As they say, a single careless thought from the king can cause war and a beautiful nonchalant glance from the queen can make the whole kingdom fall.
Getting out of his self inflicted hell , Harry looked at the four figures , two if wizards and two if witches, lying on the dirty floor, said , " Have all of you got your potions ?"
" You know it's inevitable "; with a monotone voice Harry lists .
The next morning Harry woke up with newfound determination to break Slughorn's defences. Getting up and getting ready, he made his way to the great hall.
he hissed as his scar started throbbing.
The witch seemed satisfied with his answer as she slowly pointed her finger towards the side. Harry's gaze subconsciously followed to where she pointed.
Seeing such innocence, an inscrutable jumble rose in Blaise's eyes. He hesitated for a minute before slowly uttering, "About the several paramours….. It's not true. So you don't need to worry about it."
With humorous eyes, Harry followed behind Headmaster. Behind the bookshelf, Harry's hand was tightly gripped by an overwhelmed elder, saying," Harry ! My boy , How can you talk about the memory pensive In front of Mr. Malfoy ?"
Harry twisted the knob to open the door while taking a last look at his parents . He gave them a bittersweet smile to see them return it back to him . He turned back  , closed his eyes and stepped through .
" Obliviate the thief and send him back from where he came , would you ? And remember to not leave any clue about us as well as yourself "
Hermione's eyes still held the distrust but still softened considerably compared to  before, " Thank you, Parkinson "
"Ahh !" Harry shouted. "Why did you bite me ?! Eggie's not even here !"
Like this, the conversation abruptly ended. Harry and Draco were very clear about the importance of each other . They were aware that they were in this together . So each of them were unconditionally and persistently honest and truthful, not hiding even a small useless detail from the other.
After quickly finishing his part, Harry looked up and said, "Does anyone know who Gregorwitch might be?"
" Now , now . Let's not escalate to such heart wrenching profanities. It does not suit that pretty mouth of yours "
Beady eyes hesitantly peered up as his body was half hidden behind the old mahogany table, " A-ah-it's master Regulus's locket..."
Smiling, Dumbledore replied," Hello to you as well, my child. How are you ? Fine, I suppose "
-Blaise revealing a secret.
Draco lowered his head and said ," Father doesn't but mother does . She is all I have . "
In the next tent, Draco scanned Harry's body with his magic again and again but couldn't find any reason as to why Harry was having these visions of Voldemort.
Everyone curiously stretched their necks to see. But Pansy was weak so she couldn't go there to inspect the symbol with everyone but instead sat quietly looking at the excitement.
"Someone attacked us. But the house sensed the intruder, recognising my Black blood and aparated us to the current Lord Black, you"
- Ron leaving from the burrows
"Yes, little one" the man said and Draco's head took up its job of producing a million questions per second.
Neville looked up at Blaise and said with a choking voice, "I am not a toy! I don't want to be your toy! I don't like how everyone looks at me! I don't like how they give me disgusted and pitying glances! It feels disgusting! I hate it!"
Anyone seeing this scene will inevitably want to tattoo it into their memories so as to remember that the strong and powerful Lords that they will become in the future were once these young men, scared but brave, suffering but together, weak but becoming stronger with every breath.
" Are. You. An. Idiot !?!?! " ; He said, punctuating each word with pushing and pulling Draco's cheeks back and forth.
The gears in his heads turned as he knew that Draco will never stop loving and caring for his snakes.
In all this , Harry did not forget what was going outside of his personal bubble . He did not forget that he had a knife hanging above his head which could fall at any time. Looks like he had to speed things up. But that was not a problem.  Harry had always been fast .
"And we still need to announce that we have a tiny new member joining our camp."
Not noticing anything unusual , Draco replied while scanning the books again .
Seeing the anger and fear mixed in Harry's eyes, Draco paused and gazed deep into them. Harry was angry. He was angry because of Draco. He was angry thinking that something would happen to Draco. The discovery calmed his irritated heart in the single flutter of his tresses.
Draco didn't answer. His gaze locked at the furniture on the other side of the room, refusing to look at him.
" What ? How dare yo-"
Kreacher's eyes glazed over as he reminisced the memory like a haunted dream , " He came...i~n the night….he took...many things... including the locket "
She cautiously and unconsciously bent down, lifting the tresses in her fingers to her nose.
A curt answer was immediately heard,  "Mr. Malfoy is in his room. Should I show Master Harry the way ?"
Hearing thisz the thin hand holding the vial slowly drew inside. Draco, now satisfied, instructed, "Drink half of it and feed half of it to Dobby"
His mother came forward and tenderly hugged him . Her frail arms could not even entirely wrap his shoulders as she whispered in a lovingly melody .
Looking up , he imagined his late , blond , stiff but awesome-when-she-scared-father grandmother and prayed ,
- Harry's thoughts towards the order of Pheonix.
Draco sneered, "I will decide what I should or shouldn't, Potter. You don't need to bother with it."
" Master Draco , did you - "
" I want to know "
As soon as Ron heard Pansy, he was up with wide awake eyes. Getting up and pulling a startled Neville outside. Without looking back he said ," Why are you walking so slow ? Hurry ! What if we are late ?!"
The cloning spell was an illegal dark spell used to grow a true lifeless body of a person. The body formed will be of true flesh and blood , retaining the human physiology to absolute perfection but without life. It was made illegal as to perform this spell the human body parts such as fingernails, blood or hair was needed from the person to be replicated.
Draco hurriedly soothed her back , saying," Don't speak if it hurts . Just lie down ."
"Okay, Master Harry"
" If you don't do this right now, Professor , you will dishonor her memory in the worst way. Then she died for nothing, isn't it ? Please, professor . You made a mistake, didn't you ? This is your chance to correct it . Be brave, Professor. Be brave like her "
" Would you like a firewhisky Slughorn ?" Hagrid asked in the meantime.
-Harry gives Draco the first hint of the feelings he holds. in short, he hits on Draco for the first time.
- change in Draco's view about Dumbledore.
Draco weakly lifted his fingers and lightly tapped Harry between his brows to silently draw his attention.
" You are not alone . There are others" Dumbledore said with a very slight hint of surprise. His words were fast and precise in an attempt to extract as much information as possible before the death eaters arrive .
Hello readers ,
Harry didn't even realise when his eyes took on the gloomy green of a deep sea. The obsession in his eyes was scary but well hidden behind the clarity. His eyes only held Draco, they only reflected Harry's love , his infatuation and his lust for his beloved.
" Also , Blaise and pansy will be staying back in the Slytherin common room guarding . Ron and Hermione will be staying in the gryffindor common room as well . Theo and Neville look out for the death eater and make sure that the passage from the room of requirements to the astronomy tower is empty . As well as try to inform the teacher's if possible  " Harry commanded .
Looking back up again , Harry said ," Hey Eloise . "
" Let the events take their course . All we ask you is to keep an eye out for the younger students. Keep them safe and mostly let the teacher's take the action" Harry continued.
" Would you mind sharing a room with the others for tonight ?"
Frowning , Draco nodded and continued . He agreed with Luar . Then though about Potter being natural at , let's say , everything that could attract a harem of top notch beauties and gave a scowl-pout-sneer hybrid which looked positively cute and negatively weird .
How is it going ? It going fine for me .
He started from the ankle, slowly massaging it with a comfortable and easing pressure. Leisurely moving down to hold the pink tinted sole in his hands to move his fingers along the depression in the sole and the heel. He didn't forget the twin mounds of soft flesh just beneath the valleys of his toes . His fingers gradually slipped inside the sensitive junction between the toes as a small sigh escaped Draco's throat.
If one thing that Draco is sure of is that the dark mark is not as simple as it seems. He saw with his own eyes how his once reasonable father gradually started to get sick in the mind.  How his craze got up to the point where he wouldn't even care if his family died for the cause of victory of Voldemort. He would happily accept that they died as martyrs. The same goes for other followers of Voldemort. They don't  care if their children lived or died . They all were already crazy , making their children more or less orphans. Only some of them still have their senses like his mother and Snape , but even they  are not completely unaffected. The longer the mark stays, the more they go crazy. Therefore, the filthy mark on his arm has to go. So that he can get my mother and the Slytherins in  Hogward's out of here because these are the last people he considers family. With these thoughts, the pair of silver eyes shone even brighter in the same silver rays with a decisiveness clear in them. Draco gently lay on his bed and pulled up the covers, silently waiting for everyone to drift into their dream worlds so that he could easily make his way to his destination.
Anyway, How was the chapter ? in this chapter, I solely focused on the tacit understanding between Harry and Draco and how they compliment each other. Also, from here the plot will start thickening. I also tried to depict more sides of Draco and Harry and their true emotions.
Taking the vial out of his breast pocket, he opened the cork under the eyes of his trusted ones . Drinking it in one go , he lowered the vial. His body didn't feel any different. What felt different was his mind. He felt lighter , easier and more in control than ever.
" At least let me see ."
At a point it completely stopped as did the woman's thrashing . Draco slowly backed away . Still dazed from the suddenness of all of this . The egg was still there . He looked at it and remembered the woman's words
Silence reigned for some shocked as tongue tied seconds.
" He said that he will never marry me! Can you believe it ! He said that. How could he !?! And do you know what he said when I asked him why ? He said that he didn't want anyone, that he already had what he needed ! " Now, her eyes were growing frantic and so was her smile.
Harry took eggie from her arms and carefully nuzzled it beside Draco.
The shock was evident in Draco's eyes as he looked around. He didn't know this place nor did he have even the slightest tinkling of where it might be. It was the snake corpse which gave him the actual clue.
Harry did not understand what had both Draco and Dumbledore so frightened . Horcruxes , was it ? All he thought after seeing the memory was how to find all the pieces and work on destroying them . The fact that Voldemort had Horcruxes was nothing more than a clue , a piece of inside information . But obviously , it meant much more and deeper for the silver haired young and elderly before him.
Hermione's purse lay at his feet and he picked it up and spelled, "Accio Dittany!"
Some time had gone by till Draco felt his consciousness come back. At the same time he felt his tired and heavy body. His eyelids refused to open and his limbs felt as heavy as rocks. Finally coming to himself, Draco remembered what happened and inevitably started to panic.
" Sure" Came a chuckled answer.
" Go on "
Draco wasn't shocked at this discovery.
" The other room was not ready to use "
Growing solemnly , Draco said in a decided tone ," No , I don't have time for this . I need to do so much . This will only delay things , it won't make  anything better ."
" Sure did . A good choice to be an ally if you ask me . Even fed you healing potions before he went . He at least cares about you by the looks of it ."
"Ahh!", The tender and chubby face gave a precious toothless smile as big and her vibrant green eyes narrowed with glee.
Harry looked at the cheeks reddened ripe , before because of the tears and now further because of the rubbing. Right now Harry felt like he was literally drowned in a huge pot of sweetness. Seeing Draco like this , so close, felt like lying on a bed of nails and rolling around in white clouds at the same time. It felt like drinking liquid crucio flavoured with honey.
" Harry , Why are you crying ? Harry ? Baby? "
He lifted his arms while cautiously taking the baby from Harry's brace and bringing her into his own.
And our Ron here , chose option D .
" The slave marks are embedded in your magic , removing them will feel like removing a parasite stuck on your skin . We have to cut away the chunk of magic it is stuck on , so that not even a bit of it remains within . And at that time your magic will start slipping away , it will bleed . Doing it with such a condition will kill you . " ; Voice still calm , Luar said .
He effortlessly slipped off the outer coat from Draco's body, making sure of his comfort before drawing up the covers.
Hermione's hazel eyes scrunched in worry and guilt as she looked at the petite girl who was laying in front of her. Her hand came forward as if wanting to soothe her brows which were frowning due to discomfort. But soon stopped just a hair's breadth away from the pale cheeks.
In that moment, the barrier around them faltered and the bricks and ruins of the room were thrown towards them by the still thrashing snake tail.
Harry found himself softly saying to it, " Don't worry . He's just asleep "
The day went as always even with the helpful inputs from Luar every now and then . Draco had been somewhat absent these days , thinking about the information he read , his condition and the dark mark . This did not go unnoticed by Blaise and Pansy , who silently approached him in the potions classroom .
And Harry thought,
Silence .
" Who punched me knowing full well that he might be offending a necessary ally which could indirectly cost him his life ?"
- Dr. Shipper.
"Yes" Harry smiled, "Truthfully, I was ready for something like a dragon or maybe a phoenix, even a mermaid seemed as a possibility but - but never this."
"Ah ! Wat ar ya daing !?! Lave me tis istace !!!! " ; Draco said with his cheeks still squashed. Pulling Harry's hands to no avail.
Neville turned his head to see Blaise coming towards him to gently help. Sitting up, Neville shrugged off the hands on his shoulders.
" Bu-"
Pointing his wand, Harry drew out the house elf , saying with clear disdain and disgust , " You've been spying on us , haven't you ?"
Green eyes narrowed casting a dark shadow on his eyes , making the green more gloomy . The voice grew darker and more dangerous as well ,
Ron , not able to take anymore nausea, directly said, " You are a thief , Fletcher. Everyone knows it "
Draco's words bought a much needed relaxation as everyone calmed down from their tensed and overly vigilant state they were in. Small and grateful smiles were sent his way as Draco reassuringly smiled back, answering their unsaid query that he was well and alright.
"Have you heard of The Golden Warrior? Eloise Herewósa, The Great Golden Warrior ! That who I am.", The voice boasts with a prideful and awe-inspiring tone.
" Yes "
Neville stayed quiet ,refusing to answer, as he glared at the man without fear.
Madam Pomfrey walked to him with a brand new uniform and with her eyes checking for any discomfort on his body and said, "You are already healed and can attend your classes, Mr. Malfoy. But remember to not tire yourself and take care of your health. In addition, take this once a day before sleep to regain the lost energy."
" Talk like that once again and I am going to slap your face "
" Tell me little one  . You went through something horrible , didn't you ? The aura of death is so thick on you but it is not your . It was left by someone close to you . You are hurt inside out , aren't you ?"
She was clutching her stomach while laughing loudly, the red veins in the white of her eyes were clearly visible. She had lost it. Draco did not flinch nor did he move . He was in the same place , like a statue . Why would he be afraid of her when he was more or less the same ?
Draco: ( ಠ︵ಠ )     ........(╬☉д⊙)⊰⊹ฺ
-Draco follows harry to the Godric's Valley.
Draco sat beside Ron as his blue magic worked to completely heal the wound on Ron's shoulder. To his side sat Harry and Hermione while Pansy and Theo waited outside of the tent. He didn't hide his healing magic. He and Harry had clearly told them early on their abilities but refrained to explain in detail. While all of them were curious and earger to know, Harry had squashed all their inent with his stone cold and emotionless " No questions "
As if struck by thunder, Blaise was stumped. He hurriedly started to wipe the tears and asked, " Merlin ! W-what did i do? Why are you crying, Longbottom?"
"THAT'S WHAT I'M ASKING YOU, YOU TWAT! WHAT DID YOU DO?!"
" Hmm " came the curt and sharp reply .
Hermione : "…"
She elegantly stood up , muttering something like " well , I wouldn't mind the wine " before fading away and another soul taking her place in front of the mirror resulting in it changing the picture reflected .
It was Pansy Parkinson. Hermione stared at her in a daze as the said girl made her way to her.
Looks like Malfoy did not like being touched . Finding such a good opportunity for years of revenge !!! How could he let it go so easily ?!?!
" Yes. But destroying it is more than a simple task "
A gentle smile graced Hermione's lip and she said with a tint of humour, "Actually , I was considering the pavement under a bridge , cool and cosy , isn't it?"
A speculative silence spread and everyone thought seriously. But, no one could remember the name Gregorwitch being heard or read anywhere. After several minutes, Hermione, who remembered something as well, quickly got up to enter one of the tents.
A million sudden but kind changes were always better than a gradual but vile  change.
The green hue and arched lips ,as if casting a spell , had Draco relax bit by bit .  Calmer than before, He looked up with worried eyes and said with an urgent voice, " Potter, you remember what I told you right ? This will only result in the worst."
Pained moans and cracks echoed in the space which quietened down after some tough minutes.
- Draco plans to bring Kreacher on this side.
" No " Snape said as he calmly stepped inside the room. All the faces in the room moved to him. Some of them were relieved, so surprised and some calmly waiting for his next action.
" But then how did we get here ? "
Pulling back her mind from a haze of Pansy's unconscious seduction, Hermione sighed and ruthlessly told, "It's all too late. He's already too far gone."
Soon she maniacally started laughing, loud and shrill.
Hermione looked at him with a ridiculing gaze before standing up to leave as well.
Harry: "....."
The insides and organs scattered here and there rotting and flies and insects feeding on them. He could clearly see the intestines piled on the floor like huge spaghetti, blackening blood on them like sauce.
Did the sun rise from the west ? Or was it the east ? Is Blue of Sea it's own color or was it a reflection of the sky above ? Draco's head was in a tangle . It was so tangled that it could be called a messy ball of wool rather than a brain.
A hand, as graceful and as fair as snow, slowly brushed away specks of white stuck on his lashes. The hand was so delicate and white that for a second, Harry thought that it was made of the moonlight itself.
In this commotion, Ron was entirely forgotten and he himself was lost in his thoughts. He seemed to have seen the symbol Hermione showed them somewhere. He was sure that he saw it somewhere but he just couldn't remember. The memory was on the tip of his mind. Entangled in these thoughts, he didn't notice any of the happenings around.
The snake didn't even take a minute to recover and came to strike again as Harry was speaking to Draco.
Draco tightened his hold on the pillar while resting his back on it . He looked as Luar turned into a swirling ball of light and rushed into the brooch on this new necktie as Draco was pushed back by the force and firmly planted against the pillar . When it ended , the silence prevailed again . The once kind-of-full room , now completely empty . Draco walked towards an array drawn on the ground , stood in the center and said the words he read on the shelf . With this , a bright light shone and the remaining occupant disappeared as well , leaving the room with only dirt .
Harry squinted his eyes, "Shhh~, Parkinson. You'll wake Draco up."
Finally done, Draco opened his eyes and made his way into the restricted section, not alarming any barrier and activating any array. Everything was as it was before, silently asleep in the dead of night.
Afterall, they now had another Master !! It was a very happy occasion ! Their Lord has found himself a sweetheart ! And Master Draco is such a cultured gentleman! And beautiful as well !!! He will surely make Master Harry very happy !!
"You are a healer , aren't you ? You can teach me the basics , right ? "
A stuttering gasp echoed Hermione's fear as Ron hurriedly said from her side, " I-it was me. I-i unknowingly called his name"
" You know, Malfoy , sometimes I wonder if you really are a Slytherin.  You never learn, making the same mistake again and again. It's hilarious if you ask me"
The small heeled boots tapped and the deadly enchantress stepped closer to Draco, whispering in his ear like a snake's hiss, " Well done, Draco " The bloodied lips moved to disgustingly place themselves in the abnormally pale cheeks.
It was the locket !
" I know you need this . But - but I can't do this ", he said bowing his head , his voice a mere whisper.
Harry silently made his way to the infirmary. With the invisibility cloak sneaking out was as easy as breathing.
Draco looked down to see a huge egg wriggling in his blanketed lap. It was just wriggling into his lap as if snuggling into him.
Outside the train, huge wisps of dark smoke speed up to reach the front of the train.
_______
Draco was in a desperate state. Air was so sparse that no words were spoken.
Harry wondered .
" What you did was good and well-thought with a quick response. But -" He paused before continuing with more emphasis and dominance, "- something like this should never occur again. There's too much on line, now. We can't afford failure "
London was damp and cold today. The clouds overcast as of a reminder of all the misfortunes in their life.
" What have I done wrong ? What could have I done for him to be happy ?" He mused.
Harry ,who was beside him, reached out rough fingers to gently caress the pale face. In the black night, a small whisper was heard, "I love you so much that a little cruelty and blood on my hands seems like a normality if it keeps you smiling”
Harry took out the locket of Slytherin from where it was against his neck, saying , "We have to deal with this soon"
Draco mused with a concentrated expression and scrunched brows as he again undid the whole wrapping to do it all over again.
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry could not move his eyes off Draco, scared that one second will be enough for him to disappear . He did not want to see Malfoy disappear. He didn't want to one day look beside him and realise that Malfoy wasn't there sneering at him . That he couldn't hear those sweet insults anymore.
A gasp escaped Draco's lips . His eyes trained on The Headmaster's hand. The skin there was extremely wrinkled and sticking to the bone . Blackened by the effects of evil and dark magic . If it was someone else , they might not realise but Draco did. It was corrupting him and rotting his magic . Headmaster was dying and if they did not do anything soon , the day will come even faster.
"Thank you", he said, turning towards Pansy.
A death eaters among them decisively stood in front of the train, compulsing it to stop.
Their conversation, no matter how simple and polite it looked, sent chills down the backs of the people around. Most of them thought they were initially talking about Neville being a lion in the snake pit but as more words were spoken , they got inevitably confused. But the Slytherins, who were used to such talks since infancy, and the Ravenclaws, with their sharp brains and vast knowledge, understood every well. They knew that in the whole conversation, Neville was referred with only a single word,
________________________________________________
Draco took out the locket from his pocket holding it out in clear sight. As soon as the elf caught the golden locked donning the styled and curved ‘S’ , his eyes widened with fright and he swiftly lowered his head refusing to look at the object as if even looking at it can curse you.
Harry peered here and there . Maybe if he flipped the lid , he would automatically aparate .
As Harry was about to leave , Draco hurriedly said , " And remember that it should be something small yet able to supply enough energy , like sandwiches . If available, take some of those water bottles we saw yesterday. They are easy to handle and cheap as well, perfect for travel "
These people thought of themselves as experienced and learned in fighting the dark side , but have any of them ever had any encounter with Voldemort, with active death eaters ? Do they know the complexity and intensity of the situation ? While some of them might , most of them do not. Their plans not only disregard perfection and foolproof steps but also human life.
Harry's eyes gleamed darkly, daring Draco to continue. He really wanted to see how amusingly cute Draco can be when he was furious.
Kreacher continued, " Mundungus Fletcher! "
His mouth filled with the metallic yet sweet blood carrying a hint of bitter poison in it. Mouthful after mouthful, Draco sucked out the poisoned blood before spitting it out.
A flash of green passed by the corner of her eyes. In the next second, a tall figure stood in front of the unconscious Neville.
Harry was looking at the egg as well and he could hear a faint heartbeat from it . He was sure that something was inside it . Casting a lumos , he put the wand tip on the egg . The inside of the egg became somewhat visible . The egg had a translucent yellow substance inside it with a dense irregular shape in the center with red branches coming from it to spread in the egg .
From the corridor behind the couple, Hermione appeared. Her eyes held indecision, confusion, as if she was reluctant about a certain task but was compelled to do it either way.
George more calmly but just as angrily continued, "You just suddenly disappeared and we shouldn't even try to find you ?!"
His voice powerfully boomed, "Who's there ?! Come out!"
Draco lowered his head as his eyes turned dark and hazy , lost at the bottom of an ocean of memories , dark , isolated and cold . He  did not have any care for his pureblood image anymore . All he wanted was to get out , get away .
"WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHY I WAS ASLEEP?! WEREN'T YOU ASLEEP AS WELL?!"
- Dr. Shipper
Pansy and Hermione stepped out, their eyes were dazzled by the scene in front. Their eyes grew wide from wonder and astonishment and their hearts stumped.
When Draco looked up again the man had disappeared . He did not know how much time had passed by , so he made the conclusion that the soul had other tasks to do . After all , Malfoys are never idle . Then , he thought about what was written in the books . The dark mark was a kind of mark that is called ' the Slave marks' . The marks of this kind are center oriented . In other words , they are beneficial to the caster but typically harmful to the bearer . It complies the bearer to obey the caster's every command and disables the bearer to harm the caster in any form . It literally brands the bearer as a slave . Fortunately , the dark mark is the most weak kind of slave mark . It is only half a slave mark and not a complete one . These marks are cast by embedding the caster's magic into the bearer's nerves and skin . Thus , if the bearer's magic subconsciously  tries to remove the mark ,  it will harm the nerves of the bearer and immediately kill them .
With a slight chuckle, Harry answered," Ah! So this is the reason for the sneaky behaviour . You don't need to worry . It isn't that Dumbledore is evil. It's just that he is naive. No matter how old and revered he looks, he is still very foolish"
As he reached deeper in the forest to find a secluded but safe place , he noticed the dead trail of plants. Realising it was the same trail he and Harry followed months ago, he didn't stop but continued. It must have become like this because of the effect of the purple poison.
Draco didn't bother with her flattery, "How much is it ?"
A frown made his way to Draco's face. Eggie usually drank much more than this. Is he already full ?
Understanding him , Luar continued ," Over that is the anomaly of your soulbonds which makes it worse . If you go like this , the consequences will be bad . It can even handicap your magic , making you a squib . We should first treat this before our next step ."
He looked at Hermione's downcast and somewhat fearful eyes, " We encountered them while making our way here. At that time, we were tired and hungry and stopped for a short rest in a desert cafe. They came in dressed as manual repair workers and started to throw curses as soon as they saw us "
With this , Draco realised that it was indeed his responsibility as the descendant of Malfoys to help his own ancestor . Also , respected ancestor had helped him so much . The least he could do was to free the soul of his ancestor to join his beloved in the netherworld . And if they truly were in love then the soul of the beloved might be trapped somewhere as well . Maybe he could find it so that both of them could fulfill their last wish and depart to the land of souls together .
Draco weakly resisted the hold , his eyes alight with terror but his mouth not uttering a word or even a cry. He will not give Harry the pleasure to see his pain.
Panting, he stood there in the silence with his back against the tapestry . Sliding down, he silently pulled up his knees to bury his head in them.
Harry sensed the disarmed emotions in Draco and tightly grasped his shoulder.
And don't forget to leave more kudos,  comments, bookmarks as well (I am greedy~ Will you blame me~?)
Draco's voice was tired and weary when asked Harry, "We haven't been paying much attention to him, have we?"
Hello readers,
- Pansy almost dying but getting saved at the last moment.
When Draco came back to Harry again, he clearly was very tired but still sat down beside him to repeatedly check and renew the surrounding barriers.
" I figured so much. I know that this is a puzzling task I have asked of you. But do understand, Harry, you are the only one with a leverage big enough to get it done. " ; Dumbledore humbly explained.
Harry watched as Malfoy wrapped the egg in thick blankets as he moved to again settle it on his lap . Waiting silently , Harry looked on .
A hot rush of blood enveloped his entire being and Blaise thought,
Harry's eyes turned a horrifying green and his magic reached out to blow them away from Draco and pull him close to him . But before anything could happen , Draco stood up , firmly and calmly saying ," Wands down "
Walking around in the space, she replied," love to, Albus. But I fear , we are in a bit of tight schedule "
" Do not jest , Potter . There is no one alive who will not use a leverage in the time of peril . If you do not have a reason now then what about when you do ?" ; Malfoy said with a giggle in his voice like a fleeting mirth . He was still looking ahead , avoiding Harry's gaze .
" Malfoy " uttered a deep and hoarse voice.
OR, for the more courageous and bold ones,  -
Kreacher acutely sensed his thoughts and said in a mellowed voice and lowered head , showing that he didn't mean harm , " Kreacher….. is a Black house elf and…... wants to serve….. the Black family. Kreacher…. doesn't have bad thoughts "
" Can I accompany you ? If it isn't a bother, that is " Draco questioned with a hopeful tone.
Like putting water on a burning fire, Draco's anger was instantly gone. " Hmmph. But don't do it again" And paused for a thoughtful second before adding ," unless they absolutely deserved it. Then it's fine"
Fuck decency and manners ! He was going for it !
" Balliski venom, huh ? That makes a tremendous amount of sense"
" Ron only understands fist and pain. Words do not work on him "
Draco was still half asleep when he felt a gentle caress on his head. Groggily opening his eyes, Draco saw the blurry picture of a dark and defined face.  Squinting his eyes further , his vision cleared to spot Harry sitting beside him, gently stroking his head.
Harry said nothing only sighed. The things that are supposed to happen will always happen no matter what.
Draco almost banged his head on the headboard behind him due to the mental shock. Looking again, the egg was still there, merrily swinging. In its playful fun, it had knocked many things down and the room was a disaster. It was still playing when Draco saw the tumbling trunk just above the egg, about to smash it into an omelet any second. Without a second thought, Draco pulled the egg out of the ring .
Dumbledore's face shone with happiness even as a glassy look overtook his eyes.
At that moment Harry's voice sounded with a husky tone. Like the deafening roar of wind during a storm or like the low gruff and throaty sound made by a lion to warn another of its limit .
Pansy cautiously rose from the forest floor and let out a relieved sigh. She quickly and efficiently ticked the leaves scattered around on the piece of ground she just used.
He turned to look at Harry before saying, "Come with me for a second, won't you?"
The ignorant victim did not know that what made him feel so sticky wasn't even his own sweat but someone's saliva.
Little did she know that it wasn't Draco who was the Golden boy , the chosen one and the boy-who-lived.
She stealthily stood behind Hermione, almost touching her back. And as if feeling the burning warmth of her magic , Hermione flinched, jerking her hands back a little.
Harry stood still, his entire body stuck in place. He stood watching in a daze as Draco hugged the baby in his arms, as Draco's eyes lit with joy, as Draco called out to him.
The moonlight filled the room as Draco slowly sat up from bed. Checking that his roommates were still deep asleep, he got out of bed. Silently draped his school robes over himself, took his wand and made his way out of the dormitory towards the library.
" Potter !"
A single tear slid down those bloodied cheeks.
Draco even though a drop or two might leak from his eyes.
But Harry still has a doubt, so he silently questioned, "Why did you ask me to come with you? You didn't even need me"
" Run ! I'll manage them ? " Harry said as he defended and protected them.
Before he could say anymore , a pearly hand clamped on his mouth.
He again opened his eyes to find himself back at his dorm , in his bed . His invisibility cloak still at the table . It was like nothing happened and it was all a dream if not for the presence he now felt in his consciousness . He somehow knew it was that oldman . It was like a ball of light , tightly snuggling in a corner . He tried knocking on it . To his surprise , the ball of light took the shape of a human , a man . Harry observed that the man looked like in his early forties and wore something like a wizarding robe but shorter with the front closed , better fitted and tight sleeves as well as without the hood . He looked like a rough and wild man , untamed and unmannered . Just like him .
Silently walking through the wide corridor , Harry had an inkling that something was coming . Which proved correct as the next moment Snape made his way across them . He hurriedly pulled Malfoy behind a statue as he vigilantly eyed Snape's moments .
echoed through the living room. The silent , gentle but somewhat prideful and stern melody swirled and rippled in the air around.
Harry solemnly nodded as the voice faded . In his heart , he already accepted the Oldman as his master* . Up till now he has given Harry no reason to not believe him and has also taken the vow . This shows where his interests lay clearly .
-Our first side couple , Neville and Blaise, having a heart warming moment.
" ; a feeble sound came from behind Draco drawing their attention .
The doors closed and Harry had a new understanding of anxiety . Taking stiff steps towards ….. somewhere.
" Finished ?" Harry asked , turning towards him.
"What are you chatting there for?! You useless gryffindorks, come here and help me! And while you're at it, call Kreacher out to help as well."
The waist was not thin like that of a woman but of ample diameter. Even through the dress shirt, Blaise could still feel the soft and flexible skin underneath. When he gripped this part not long ago, his fingers had dug into the plump flesh there, probably leaving a red handprint on them.
In his anger Draco didn't realise the change of address and continued.
Finally tasting the dishes , Harry could feel his eyes burning.
-Pansy and Hermione's reaction to Harry's romantic and obsessive feeling towards Draco.
" He fed me healing potions ?" ; Now this truly astonishedd Harry . He did not expect Malfoy to actually care about him as such . It was a novel feeling .
Silently entering the cave , they already had their wands pointing ahead . Reaching deeper in the cave a bizarre sight made its way into their eyes .
It must be. Otherwise, who else knew about this other than him ? Even the headmaster himself didn't know. An intense jolt of happiness ran down Draco's body. A small smile lighted his face as his silver-blue eyes shone gratefulness and relief.
The crowd : "..."
[ Cynn* - Family, Clan, Household,etc ]
Everyone was in mayhem . No one realised what happened and who went where.
"Pansy, why don't we wait outside? Let Malfoy and Harry rest.", She said, gently yet forcefully guiding Pansy out.
All five hands were raised in a second . While Ron still remained motionless. Harry saw but chose to remain silent. With a sigh , Draco spoke , albeit softly , "Weasley , Do you agree ? "
This wasn't the first time she came here but this was the first time she hit Draco and not just verbally abused him. Draco's location was not a secret in the Wizarding society. It was an open secret that Draco Malfoy was captured by Harry Potter. The fact that he wasn't tortured but instead raped was known to few.
The sudden change panicked Draco and Harry as they tried to find what was wrong . Draco kept giving his magic as it kept bouncing back and her pulse kept growing weaker.
" I am sure , sir . I trust him with my life "
Taking out several potions he ideally made , he fed Harry a potion to replenish his health and another nutrient potion . Finally done , he stood up and looked down at the unconscious Potter . Now that Potter was asleep , it was the perfect time to slip out  and avoid disclosing anymore than he already did . He did not care from where Potter learnt to perform wandless magic . For all he cared , it was the best as long as he did not interface with Draco's life .
As he said this, the ones who will be out going on a journey are obvious. Draco, sensing the troubled emotions on their faces , said , " If you have any doubt , any fear , then leave now . Do not step ahead if you're not ready to sacrifice a limb or an eye "  His eyes were absolutely serious and solemn.
Student 2 :
From the lack of acknowledgment , Ron as well as Hermione's silence and the look in Harry's eyes , people understood that it was better to stay away from him today .
Theo who
Harry's eyes grew cold in a seething anger, "Where were you hurt ?"
________
" Come inside the cloak " ; Harry said as he put the cloak over his head , beckoning him to step closer .
" Sleeping " came the whimpering answer.
In the silent night, a small whisper was heard by the walls, "Just wait, Malfoy. Just wait "
Scrunching his brow , Draco's mood went down. He really didn't want to wait here. And he didn't trust Dumbledore. Who knows what the scheming old fool will do ?
Suddenly , the voice grew serious as it said in a grave voice .
" He did . A vitality increasing potion and a nutrient potion . "
" I found him unconscious in the forest . He wasn't injured. Probably collapsed due to shock after encountering a beast. I wouldn't want to take him back like this. Heard from moaning myrtle that he cries near her due to matters with his family, it seems. " Harry explained.
Harry's tongue was flexible in woving fairytales and much more flexible in woving pleasure on a certain someone's pale skin.
When did their golden boy, their saviour, their beacon of light, their eternal hero turn into an absolute hooligan? Is this still their Saint Gryffindor? Has the end of time come so early ?
" That's why you have been travelling for the past months , isn't it sir ?"
With a complicated expression, Harry said, "Good , good . The students must have already started departing for home , haven't they ?"
" Okay , okay "
Hearing the door shut, Draco lay there unmoving, still and lifeless. His eyes held no light, no emotions, no pain, no misery. There was nothing. But still the tears did not stop flowing. His whole body had resigned but his heart did not, a small corner of his shattered heart still hoped. For what ? Even Draco did not know. Sometimes he thought that it was another glance , or a small smile, a lingering touch, or maybe a barely gentle caress.
Harry looked at the silver head , something unpredictable swirling in his eyes . Slightly letting loose the grip on Draco's wrist .
Ignoring them, Harry remembered Draco's condition last night and asked, "How is Draco? Is he fine?"
Harry finally understood what Draco meant. He didn't want to carry out the assassination but he also didn't want to look weak so he went around in circles around the topic.
Hermione : "...."
Draco did not know how much time passed when a house elf came in. He gasped at the sight of Draco but did not utter a word and started gently cleaning him. His eyes were filled with pity and helplessness as he softly tended to Draco. He was their lord's prized possession, he was supposed to be handled as gently as the thinnest and most fragile porcelain.
Understanding his doubts, he transmitted his isolated voice to Draco's ear , saying," It's Slughorn's memory . Apparently, Voldemort was his prized student "
As they say , for doing something only a reason is enough but for avoiding something a thousand excuses are listed .
With that, Draco swiftly turned around and carefully made his way a dozen steps behind the old hag, slowly and cautiously following her. Harry sighed helplessly and kept his pace firm beside Draco, not even falling a step ahead or behind. In case something really happened, Harry is fully prepared to protect Draco.
George muttered to silently excep the reconciliation, " Through the Family charms. When your life got threatened, the charms were activated and sent your location to the burrows. When the alarm rang, only two of us were there. The others have already hidden away"
An inquiring eyebrow rose and Draco continued, " Luar Malfoy, the soul you saw in the cave when you saved me ?"
(See the end of the chapter for
After some time,
It was then that he remembered that he hadn't seen Luar since the ritual. Wanting to speak, he rubbed his neck brooch but instead of Luar's voice, a small note came out.
"Wait here while I fetch something " ; Harry commanded as he made his way to the school leaving him to stand there . He was not worried about Malfoy running away . He was smart enough to understand what he should and shouldn't do. Soon retrieving the invisibility cloak , he made his way back.
Harry hummed in approval as his expression slowly grew softer. The long pale eyelashes above Draco's closed eyes fluttered, teasing Harry's heart.
Harry had found out the note inside the locket at the Potter mansion. Soon, the news was relayed to the rest through the letters so as to let them keep a lookout for it as well. But never had they predicted that it would be Theo coming with the important piece of insight. Anyway, the slightly simplistic but proud look in Draco's eyes had told much of what he thinks about it.
In the messy and dusty living room of the Black Manor sat the three pairs of youthful figures. Their faces showing serious and conflicting colors.
As soon as Draco caught the sight of her, he turned around with a swish and made his way towards the tower. He still had a task to complete.
" Already here ?"
Hermione : ( 0 ∆ 0 )
As soon as Draco realised that Luar had found the dark magic, he forcefully suppressed his own body and magic, suppressing the dark magic with it as well. This did not affect Luar as he was not dependent on Draco.
Unknown to him, on the other side of the world, a pair of emerald green eyes were weaving a painting of his pale skin and making plans to return to his side once again.
Draco, who sighted Harry while setting the plates aside, soon came to him, asking, "Are Granger and Weasley already asleep?"
Reaching his bed , he plopped in it . Arms and legs spread wide like the stick figure babies drew .
The first thing he has to do was to find a way to get rid of the dark mark. The library back at the mansion barely had anything. With this option gone , the other option he had was the school library. The book Draco needed was probably in the restricted section but to get there he needed the permission from a professor, which was nearly impossible. He cannot go to his godfather even if he knew that Snape would never do anything to harm him, still the risk was too great. So, the only other way was to make another professor give him permission.
Swift nods from both the women answered his words.
It was then that he heard a chuckle from beside him that he remembered that he wasn't alone . Glaring at Harry , he squinted his eyes as he tucked the egg even closer , making it completely disappear in his robes , leaving only and big bump on his torso . He thought
The man smiled and said ," Anything you want , son ."
Finally, he slumped back down , " Bleeding, give it away , didn't I ? There I was flogging my way in Diagon alley and then some ministry aid comes up and asked to see my license. Said she wanna lock me up . But I've got children at home , I said . So she made it die with the locket "
" Very well"
Harry : "…."
Still groggy and in pain, Harry shakily answered, "Yes. He is searching for something. Searching so desperately as if his life depended on it. Something that a man named Gregorwitch had but was stolen from him"
" Avada Kadabra ! " , Came the shout from behind them and Theo's eyes lit in terror.
Still wide-eyed and open-mouthed , Draco took a deep breath and slowly closed his eyes and then his mouth and gulped as if swallowing the leftover shock . If he really did somehow swallow the shock , then Merlin's sure that Draco Malfoy's death certificate will go something like this :-
- Dr. Shipper
" It was dying ! And blood was the only thing that it consumed "
Pansy's face frowned in obvious worry and disbelief, "Mosquitoes ? Such savage bites. Are you sure it isn't an infection ? It might be the bite of some poisonous insect. Afterall, we are in a forest"
Tubelights started lighting in Harry's head,
Her voice was doubtful and inquiring. Pansy sensed the disbelief and distrust in it and said scathingly, angry and sneering, " Potter told me as well as asked me to accompany you after I leave my house"
Harry now is more dark. He does not just blindly follow. He seeks and hides his true thoughts. Harry now is protective over his people and not as softhearted as before. He will punish the people who hurt him and ignore who don't. He is on the path to greatness even bigger that in the novel and will soon become the Magical Overlord. He is someone to fear as well as respect. Fear for what he can do and respect for what he has done.
Harry cradled Draco's feet in his hand like a treasure, careful and delicate. He slowly bent down to tenderly press his lips to the translucent skin of Draco's ankle. His green eyes filled with adoration and love as he looked at the slumbering beauty.
" Old , young man. Hundreds of centuries old. " , Luar said with a nostalgic look while peeking a look towards Eloise.
The headmaster was still unconscious but the breath was weak. His condition was getting worse by the uneven beat of his pulse. With this, he also noticed the blackened corner of his lips and unnaturally greying skin.
Blaise eyes narrowed as he gave a chuckle as if the man made a joke, "How can a lion even enter the snake pit, Mr. Macnair ? It's just that a viper likes to break and poison its prey before eating it clean"
Draco silently exclaimed in his heart.
Pansy is recovering from a dangerous spell and is somewhat weak. She needs to eat healthy and fully. So Draco is personally going to make a portion for her and Theo ….and maybe a little for Harry, since he is Draco's patient as well. And he needs something to splash blood and relieve his anger anyway !
" What I mean is that you shouldn't tickle a sleeping beast , Malfoy . Don't let my gentleness fool you, I can me much more cruel when I want to "
Heading out , Draco held the egg in both his arms . The egg was as big as a person's torso and was hard and smooth shelled . It gave off a peculiar warmth . It was a soft and gentle warmth . The kind newborn babies give off. Well , it was a newborn baby just with a shell over it .
Seeing his face , Draco melted like butter and said gently ," It's fine . I apologise for all the past grievances between us . And I really value you . You do have great skills . The literal definition of gryffindor. I will be honoured to have you as an ally "
With a tap in Harry's shoulder, he said, "I'll meet you in the graveyard. You go on."
Closing his eyes , Kreacher popped away.
Reading through all six , Harry felt a sense of urgency in his veins. Actually, everything was alright and proceeding as planned but the unknown gut feeling in the pit of his stomach was nerve wracking. He wanted to write back as a warning to pay extra attention but couldn't as all of them are already out and on the road. For sometime Harry sat still in a dazed stupor, lost in his own thoughts, before coming back.
The huge doors opened to reveal Harry, dressed in expensive coats and shirts. He had come back from the cabinet meeting of ministers. Harry had gained an immortal power above the Wizarding world . He had risen to power and trapped the ministers in obeying his every word. Such a great scheme and siege he had laid. Like a crouching tiger he had been silently hiding to wait for his chance and to kill in one deadly strike. Now, he was the greatest power in the wizarding world. He had grown from the savior and the beacon of righteousness to the unspoken lord of the wizarding world, from a student at the Hogward's to the man owning the entire institution . When had he become like this? When had he become so different from the boy Draco had admired and looked up so much to ? When had he become so dark ?
Hearing this, Harry immediately grew serious, "Let's first go to the graveyard. I want to pay a visit to my parents."
Time passed and as Draco was about to finish the last of his breakfast, when Harry said, "How have you been?"
Pansy: " Are you done ?"
He scathingly continued, " My office is still raining and it's been two days , now"
Student 3 : "Definitely real. Just the flower rain is missing and it will be a perfect fairy tale."
Hermione's eyes widened and her breath caught still.
The soul sighed and looked at Draco pitifully as he sat down and began replenishing his magic .
And with that, he didn't even wait for a reply and ran back. Harry shouted behind him but was ruthlessly ignored. Seeing that it was useless, Harry gave a worried look at the slender back but still made his way to the graveyard according to Draco's words.
Harry didn't reply but only let out a sigh filled with worry and scolding tenderness for the person in front of him. He truly didn't know whether to laugh or cry. He wanted to be angry at Draco's so deficient trust in him but when looking at the honest and clear eyes, he couldn't do it.
Harry did not make much of this . He knew how stubborn Draco was. The house elf had no chance of making Draco listen to him. So Harry easily threw a reassurance that it wasn't the elf's fault before dismissing him. Afterall , he is here now, it's obvious that Harry will personally look after his precious darling.
Like soldiers obeying their Emperor , both the sides took a step back while lowering their hands.
Baby: "Ah!"
The gems lay side by side, one black and the other white, both of them possessing a mystical gleam with various colors shining in them like wisps of smoke above a bright flame. Draco couldn't feel any obvious magic from them. They were probably non-magical gems. Even though they were absolutely useless, something about them made Draco feel that they were made for him. With this, Draco's decision was made. Either way, he thought that the black opal particularly suited Harry.
"Oh…. Thank you then."
Soon Draco's robes were ripped apart and his legs forcefully spread. Without even a warning or any preparation, his entrance penetrated.  Draco did not struggle any more because he had already given up. He remembered how he was taken the first time. It was forcefully, cruel, messy, filthy. It was pure animalistic behaviour. There was no love, no feeling , just lust. It was the day he was captured and his virginity that he had guarded through the years was brutally taken. It hurt . It hurt so much. He had cried , begged , pleaded to only see the lust increase with every sound. After that he never begged, never answered his provocation again.
. Their heart chilled with what they heard and understood.
" Corrosives? I never thought about that. And What are the most toxic corrosives you know ?"
" HOW ?! "
" Okay " Ron said , as Pansy pushed him out and Ron felt that he was being pushed in the eighteenth layer of hell.
Suddenly remembering he said, " Why don't you go down and pack some snacks for the way ? It's going to be a long journey and I still don't advise using magic yet. "
Entering , Harry called," Hello Headmaster"
Sometime went by like this. When Ron came back after collecting some stray sticks for fire, what he saw was Harry's various attempts at coaxing a very angry Draco.
In a room on the first storey , Harry silently sat beside Draco in the couch , relaxing for sometime before another problem comes to knock on their door.
Draco looked back at Harry and from the look in Harry's eyes he knew that it was something important. He nodded tersely. Putting several silencing charms on the tent so as not to disturb the two's sleep, he walked out.
Saying this, he again flicked his fingers and some books flew over . Each of them wide enough for at least a thousand pages . Draco looked at them and then looked up with doubt but still some gratitude and worship in his eyes . Even if he demanded a price for the favor , it was fine as long as he  helps even a little bit . As soon as those books landed in his arms , he sat down and started to browse through the books . The books were very elaborate on the topics . It did not have specific information on the mark but each topic had several paragraphs on it  . The information was totally scattered . Draco kept his attention on the books and did not notice the look out of appreciation and approval in the man's eyes as he looked at Draco trying to understand something way above his ability . Even if Draco did not understand , he was , at the minimum , trying .
"I- ", Harry's hand quickly rose to cover Draco's lips.
Draco frowned with curiosity and wondered,
" So we just let him die ?"
"I don't understand many things in here , like what does embedding the magic into the skin and nerve means ? Also there is no specific information or way to remove the mark ."
It was a stunning picture. Draco with his pale cheeks resting in Harry's palms, his pale fingers splayed over Harry's much darker, larger and rugged hands. So precious. So precious that Harry wanted to pick him up, lock him in an unbreakable glass box and carry him everywhere. Showing him off to everyone but letting no one even think of touching him.
Harry sat on the bed beside Draco and looked at his figure lying there as if a salted fish wringed dry of it's blood. They had walked for an entire evening before finally renting this room at the same inn they had dinner at. It was actually a light dinner meant to ease the stomach but not uncomfort the body.
Draco continued to wander through the house. As he passed a closed door, a stale and disgusting stench assaulted his nose. His throat gagged and food in his stomach came up. Forcefully suppressing the vomit, Draco walked to the door and curiously opened just a slit to see what it was that could give such a bad smell. What he saw inside made his entire back numb.
Harry only hummed quietly, not answering as both of them knew that a little neglect to eggie was inevitable in such times. Giving eggie one last caress, Draco again put him back into his ring.
Harry realised with a start and said calmly," Don't move, Malfoy. It's following you. If you stay put then it will as well"
The emerald eyes gleamed and a mouth latched on the pale nape as if a starving beast on a table full of tender meat.
Ron: " what?"
What did they have to lose ? They only have each other left . If they are going to die, then let's do it together. If they are going to live, then let's do it together as well.
- the fourth side couples small and almost invisible entry. ( Geuss who ?)
So readers ,
" Don't sit up . You're still weak. You fainted due to excessive exposure to magic " Harry informed seamlessly omitting half the fact. If Draco did not remember then it was better not to remind him. Afterall, given Draco's pride , hearing this he would probably spit blood and then proceed to choke on it and die .
Harry slid the heavy bag on his shoulders to drop it on the wooden table. When he came up after paying for their rented room and dinner, Draco was already shallowly asleep on one of the twin beds in the hotel room. He had been tired and exhausted tonight. The travel from one end of the city to another on foot and the additional burden on their shoulders had been too much for him. While Harry wasn't that tired due to grace from the physical training he got from Oldman Eloise for the past few months.
" Probably because of the egg by her protectiveness over it . Also did you notice the purple hue on the trees making a trail to her ?",  Harry further questioned trying to ultimately estimate Malfoy's knowledge and worth .
Pansy was completely unconscious and heaving desperately. Her mouth fell open to take shallow gasps and wheezes. Her face already had the unnatural tint of purple and blue due to the lack of oxygen in her blood. She was barely at the edge of either death or coma.
Malfoy forgot that Harry had enough strength to turn the tables against him , in political situations as well as public image . Harry's word was enough to destroy him . He did not need leverage over Malfoy . He forgot that no matter how brave or good or righteous Harry was , power is an inevitable lure , especially in the form of control over his arch-nemesis , over someone like Draco Malfoy ,
" Hmph. Then you must listen to me in the future."
Every young face in the enclosed space held a determination , a hope . They were all aware that this might not turn out as they wished but what did they have to lose? Let it be the orphaned Harry, or the abused Draco , the muggle Hermione or  pansy who was disdained by her own family , in one way or another , all of them were alone . The only people they had that remained truly faithful were the ones with them right.
" Then there were bodies ? But- how ? Wait don't tell me-"
The veins in Draco's neck were clearly visible now. His breath was ragged and struggling but he still kept upright, still suppressing his own magic.
Harry started laughing while wiping his eyes . Seeing him laugh , his parents relaxed and hugged him while his father kept a soothing hand on this head .
Everyone understood her peril . She ,as a muggle, was in as much danger as Harry himself. She deserved some moments of calm and happiness before the storm , all of them did.
" How ?" He asked , wanting to know what can breach the secure and unbreakable wall he has built around Hogwarts.
Registering how he looked and remembering the situation last night, Hermione worriedly asked, "Where were you Harry? We searched for you all around. Are you okay? You are not hurt, are you ?"
Stepping out of the compartment , Harry looked ahead and the scene ahead stunned him to no end . Ahead of him were the two figures which were the only ones he saw in the mirror of Irsed .
The question wasn't clear but Hermione vaguely heard the subtext -
Ron : "..."
Ron : " !!! "
- Dr. Shipper
Harry stared at the Draco. His eyes were blank and his thoughts had the picture of Draco crying before he made his appearance. He stumbled back with a jolt as his body was pushed backwards and Snape ran to Draco. His eyes panicked before changing to anger as he looked at Harry, scornfully saying, " Have you done enough damage? If so, please leave, Mr. Potter, and return to your dormitory." The words were spat out by Snape as his whole being exuded furious anger. He would have hexed Harry if not for the barely breathing Draco.
How did Potter do this ? Draco knew about this phenomenon . But using wandless magic like this was nothing more that a fairytale in this age . He was able to do it because of Luar's help . How did Potter know this ?
A slight smirk overtook his face and he hurriedly shortened down the stretch of his lips into a straight, small, pink line . With a quick unnoticed flick of his wand , he muttered a spell to shrink the pill into the size of a dust grain and sneakily levitated it into Harry's pumpkin juice before it came back to its original size .
Gasps were heard all around . And Hermione stutteringly called out ," H-harry"   But instantly shut up with a single glare.
Tsk ! Such a coward ! I would've chosen A. No one hates a nice pair of juicy plum lips belonging to a pretty woman …..unless you're gay. Then kiss her husband , instead. And if somehow you already have a partner ….. happy breakup !!! Now back to the story.
A content sigh escaped Harry as the warmth of slumber shrouded them. Soon, two even and deep breaths entangled with each other. A larger body protectively curled around the smaller and slimmer body in his arms.
As the elf again lost himself in his optimistic thoughts, Harry frowned thinking,' This elf surely is very skittish and unfocused '
Draco hesitated for a minute before putting forward his thoughts.
"I will heed your advice then."
After letting Draco reassure and calm their nerves , Harry said , " The time is short. Tell us what happened "
Option C : Say " I am sorry I kissed your wife but it was only an accident "
, as they like to call themselves, make their way to their first class. With Blaise on his left and Pansy on his right,  Draco walked the corridor as if it was a ramp. His lithe body moving like how a leopard had its leisure walks.
Then the death eater's eyes flew towards Neville for a brief second, as he said mockingly, " Truly, Heir Zabini, I didn't expect for a lion to hide in the snake pit. I guess stopping the instincts to protect one's own kind is a moral torture, is it ?"
A middle aged couple languidly sat in their house. Relaxed and pliant on their couch as they streamed through the photo album of their one and only daughter.
The professor looked at the Slytherin boy and suddenly laughed loudly, "Ahaha! Oh, I am sorry to damage your toy, Heir Zabini. I wasn't aware that you still haven't played enough. I didn't expect you to still bother after playing with your toy almost every night"
Blaise was awakened of his stupor when a fair hand led his own bronze one from the plum waist to rest on rosy cheeks.
Finally, unable to keep his eyes open  without blinking anymore, he called, " Potter ?"
As the man tried to rise from the chair he had been cornered in two wands pressed on his skin. One belonging to Kreacher pressed his stomach while the other belonging to Pansy pointed to the forehead. Telling which one was more fatal was impossible but his gut told him that both were dangerous.
" What happened to him ? "
Hearing this, Harry turned to walk forward , clearly dismissing the suggestion. Seeing him walking away, Slughorn was indecisive but still followed after him while continuously calling his name.
Breakfast was pleasant . As soon as they finished, Draco started getting ready and packing up while Harry went to the reception to check out of their room.
Ahh....Such a sweet pain he was enduring right now. Should he thank fate or curse fate ? Pray tell.
Draco silently walked inside the next tent. Pansy and Theo were deep asleep. This day had considerably tired them out. They were more used to a war of words than a war of spells. Their physic was not as active as the gryffindors next door.
The egg which was eagerly happy and celebrating his nurturer's return by rolling around was abruptly pulled to fall down straight into his dear nurturer's arm. He was so happy. His nurturer felt so warm and good and his magic felt so yummy.
So, I decided to make it a little spicy and comedy and as well as mixture  of original elements and characters. Now the story will not just be limited to Hogward's but would go all over the Europe for the search of horcruxes and on gain many advantages.
Looking at the hand covering an open mouth and pitiful wide eyes, Draco sighed helplessly, "Okay okay. Remind me to teach you the wonderful art of theatrics after all of this is over."
"Look at me when I tell you to ", Harry said darkly while grabbing his face to make Draco look towards him.
- the assassination attempt on Hermione and others .
" Oh "
Struggling to lift herself up , she moved and squirmed . Seeing her difficulty , Harry gently lifted her to sit up and let her back rest on the stone wall behind her .
Both of Neville's hands softly intertwined his forearm sticking to his chest as Blaise's hand rested on his cheek.
"Apparate !"
Harry's eyes swept across the room filled with a triad of gryffindors and a triad of slytherins. Meeting Draco's gaze , he slowly started , " All of us are well aware of the situation right now . And we reckon , after much discussion , that a mutually beneficial alliance is the best of the choice."
Dear readers,
Draco's knee lightly brushed on a certain hard wood and Harry drew a sharp breath in. The wood grew even taller , such a top quality and rapidly growing wood it was ! Surely,  the durability will be unrealistically long and the sap would be sticky and nourishing ! Draco would definitely enjoy it to tears while panting and moaning in delight !
Draco's eyes narrowed, "Really? You aren't lying? Because I seemed to hear something that particularly makes me want to castrate Dumb Golden Boys."
Eyes widened , and Harry uttered , " I was trying to aparate actually "
Draco frowned, "What is it ?"
" Hmmm"
Hearing the last one , Draco asked ," what ? Why ?"
, Harry thought .
" You are up ? Good . Now that you woke up . It is time for you to leave ."
In front of them, Draco was on his knees before Harry. His brows frowned in worry before flashing hesitation. But they soon turned into determination.
Harry was curious as to why he was asking after the two. Afterall, he wasn't all that familiar with them. But Harry still replied, "Yes"
Draco has been feeling eyes on him for some time now . Given his hypersensitivity to a certain Savior-slash-golden boy-turned-stalker , he knew exactly to whom these eyes belonged . This had Draco sighing in exaggeration .He knew how Harry saw him and of his guard against Draco . Putting it bluntly , he knew why Harry did all of this . And this did nothing other than Luar demanding to curse the supposed saviour to save his son from a perverse stalker who , according to him , was going to corner Draco and then dirty his precious body and ruin his prestige by ravaging him . OH!!!! Such a tragedy ! Though certain people would definitely rejoice that . As to who , you and I both know that , don't we ?
Harry looked at Umbridge and then at Yaxley before roughly pushing Ron in front of him .
"......"
With a smile, Harry took the question as  accepting his apology and replied, " I made the killing curse hit an invisible creature instead of Dumbledore and simultaneously pushed both of you down "
His hands swiftly retreating and Draco's worried gaze roamed about Harry, "You were fine just now. What happened so suddenly?!"
- the next plans regarding the horcruxes .
Rubbing his aching nose, Draco hissed," Can you not touch me ? Is touching just anyone common to you? "
Draco shrugged his hand off and turned around to face him . His eyes were glowing as if containing silver embers . Mouth set in a scowl and muscles all over his body tight as he said ," keep your hand to yourself , Potter . They won't be attached to your body the next time " ; His voice low and tight .
On the other hand,  with the slight upturn of lips, the bright eyes and an impossibly smug face looked like when a husband who had won a fight against his wife and wore it on his face with-
" You make a good team. "
Afterall , who wouldn't be happy to leave their mark on their beloved ? He was happy that Draco didn't heal or conceal his hickeys.
The professor was obviously a death eater. For the past few days, he had found various ways to torture the students, making their life more of a hell that the actual one. While the Slytherin suffered less than Gryffindors, they still weren't in a good condition.
Harry's eyes widened suddenly-
As soon as the shallow whisper was heard, Draco hurried to sit beside and quickly supplied support to Harry's body.
Malfoy winced again and silently regretted his decisions . Why was he such a fool ? Now he not only got himself exposed to Potter but also threatened . He was a shame to Slytherins , wasn't he ?
" Potter ? What happened to me ? "
An abnormal joy and excitement flooded Draco's entire body. The feeling was so intense that it made his skin tingle.
An electric shriek rang out as ,instead of one, two bodies were thrown off the tower. And a hurried , "Draco !!!" was shouted by the female voice.
It was becoming a habit for Draco to learn from Luar's books and then try the cures  on the small animals that so needed it . There was not a shortage of them in the school gardens or at the edge of forbidden forest . Draco did not go in there , better to be safe as it was a delicate time . Days passed as Luar's personal library was falling short on Draco's progress and now Draco scanned the Hogward's library as well. Him and Luar had noticed that every time they wandered by him , Harry's eyes always followed them till out of sight . It was up to the point that it was starting to get creepy and harder to ignore. He chose to ignore it as Potter did not do anything else other than stare . Confronting Potter right now will be making an enemy out of the whole wizarding world . Potter had an unparalleled importance in this time . Draco cannot afford to offend him . Maintaining his distance is the only option and safe retreat .
" Bound ?! What do you mean by bound ? And what companions ? Don't talk nonsense, Potter "
And this , people , was how Draco unknowingly picked up not only an ancient monster but literally a god to be his father .
is this possible ?
But before the quivering lips could utter  anything, a fourth voice sounded.
Harry narrowed his eyes again . His disbelief was clear . Eloise did it once.  So , Why not again ?
This was his revenge, revenge for defying his words. With tears still in his eyes, Draco uttered the first words in months, "Please, No. Not this"
"How can I lie to you ?! How can you doubt me like this ?!" Harry gasped and said with horror, not at all afraid of death or the loss of his terrible weapon of procreation.
In front of Harry lay a boy, the one his eyes always followed, the one whose scowl was buried deeply into his eye, the one whose name made his whole muscles tighten in awareness, the one who with just one word drew his focus,  attention, eyes and thoughts to himself.
" Not with family . Always remember, you are a Malfoy to the world , but you are just Draco to another Malfoy . You are family ."
" Did you somehow offend him? ", Ron asked.
The following days went by slowly. Everyone acted as usual. The day came nearer and the fear in Draco's heart increased as well.
Big Boss? Big Boss ?!? BIG BOSS ?! MY ASS !!!
Below the school, two people dropped in an abandoned chamber with a thud. Opening their eyes the first sight they saw was the enormous corpse of a huge snake. The body was laying there, rotting and smelly, possibly dead for years.
How was the Neville/Blaise ? I plan to make Neville a small fluffy cotton candy who is just absolute cuteness to everybody.
As soon as Draco heard him , a thunderous look rose in his eyes . He stood up with a calm and resolute manner and turned to Harry.
, is also highly reccomendable.
Draco's head turned to the side with a jerk.
. The thought satisfied him to an extent that even he was unaware of.
Harry looked at the wrinkled face and a sense of unease coursed his body.
Neville's fiery gaze aimed sharp arrows at the slytherin in front, "Zabini ! Aren't you already enough of a scum?! Do I look stupid enough for you to lie such a shameless lie?! "
Suddenly, the image of his teeth sinking in that neck and leaving their mark flashed across his eyes, deepening them to form a dark endless well . His little brother twitched in under the thick cloth of his jeans and Harry barely resisted the involuntary action of his own body . His palm fisted the bedsheet beneath in an effort to ground himself.
Harry looked at the person in front of him and then at his own hand.  He was confused .
As Kreacher set Dobby down , Draco quickly walked forward to kneel beside him to tear the frail blood stained cloth on the elf's small chest , taking out the modified dittany he made himself from his purse to sprinkle it on the elf's wound. Dobby who was already unconscious didn't even flinch. The wound slowly started to close as new and tender skin grew. As the blood stopped and wounds closed completely , Draco gave a huff of relief.
Hearing her name being called, the small eyes opened and sleepily looked up at both their faces, "Ahh?"
He remembered how Draco's single touch calmed his down some time ago. And he realised that Draco's place in his life is somewhere so high that he himself can't see it.
" Very well " Harry said before nonchalantly adding , "and from now on, call him Master Draco . Understood?"
Tears were flowing across his cheeks to land on the sheets below. His eyes blushed red but face grew paler by the minute. Harry was moving frantically and maniacally, wanting to finish quickly, afterall he still had an evening meal with Ginny planned ahead . But the fast thrusts slowed when Draco refused to look at him. The flame of anger burned in his eyes and a sick emotion overtook his eyes.
From the first storey window , Harry watched a jerky and scared man haphazardly putting suitcases in his car . He looked left and right , checking for any dangerous presence . As he confirmed that there was no one watching him , he gave one last look to the house behind before driving away .
Draco took a long breath, patting his chest and reassuring himself that it was a false alarm. By now meeting Harry at unknown locations and basically being kidnapped by him was no groundbreaking disaster to Draco. Turning his eyes up again, he saw Potter waiting patiently. Harry sat down beside Draco. His body only inches from Draco's. And Draco felt  invisible chains bind him in place as Harry slowly approached closer .
Harry opened the book and realised it was on legilimency and occlumency . Surprisingly , it was handwritten . The book itself was only imaginary . He could not take it out of his mind.
Draco gave a resigned sigh and remained quiet . Was fate playing with him ? First giving him a disaster and then a fortune but not letting him do anything . It was ridiculous . Utterly ridiculous , How his whole life has come to be .
-Neville experiencing kinda- not exactly - somewhat - slut shaming. ( Pls don't get angry !)
Harry sharply turned to face him, silently asking the cause of his fear. Their eyes met in the air and Draco said, " Death Eaters. More precisely, Death Eaters who were in Azkaban till yesterday "
The words still cut deep even if he has heard worse before . He wondered if he will ever get used to them.
After a long time and probably breaking a dozen Guinness World records, Harry let a wheezing Draco go.
Answer in the comments and leave kudos !!!
"But......." Draco frowned , Harry was right but somehow it didn't feel…. appropriate. It felt as if a smelly pervert peeking at a  pretty young maiden bathing.
" What happened ?! ", Draco asked frantically. He was fine just now, how could anything happen to him so suddenly ?
Harry wand swiftly flicked, " Expecto patronus ! "
He wanted to know the answer from Malfoy himself. But he knew that he will never let these words out of his mouth. They will always be buried deep into his heart . Like a secret message bottle floating in the vast ocean never to be found, never to be read, never to be answered.
Her gaze looking at Pansy gleamed as if seeping despair,
Draco smiled and nodded his head . Even if he never experienced it with his family , he somehow understood . It was how the Slytherins were amongst other houses but to a milder extent .
Seeing that the opportunity was right, Harry firmly informed, "I am going to visit Godric's Valley"
" You should thank me for my mercy. Afterall, No matter how many nights he spends with you, you are nothing but a plaything, only a toy for his boredom. While I am the future Lady Potter. Don't let me find out about this another time. A slap won't quench my anger then." She said while waving her assistant to cast a healing charm on Draco's cheek, leaving no traces of her visit, she never did.
Draco gently shook their shoulders. Pansy got up fairly quickly but Theo , who was still in his headspace , sat up groggily.
What was she doing here ? Who gave her the address ? And why ?
Opening his eyes again, Harry found himself standing on a floor similar as where he was standing seconds ago. Draco's slender back facing him as he paced back and forth. Without a second of hesitation, Harry came forward with a great force to grip Draco's forearm, drawing him into his body. His hands and eyes restlessly wandered Draco's lithe form.
, thought Draco.
He did know what the future holds but he knows that this boy is destined for a difficult and deadly but great and powerful path .
Harry and Draco watched the egg with quizzical surprise. It's behaviour seemed almost similar to a baby. The more they looked the more baffling it was.
" Do what ?"
Of death - choking on his own shock
Getting ready, he made his way to the dining hall and seated himself in one of the chairs.
Harry has a curious gaze towards the egg under his hand and as if understanding him , the egg slightly brushes against him. A smile overtook Harry's face . Let it be . If it was a dragon, a mermaid or an ancient beast , it was still their cute snuggly eggie .
Ultimately confused and finding no answer , Draco called the soul ," Umm…. Respected ancestor , are you there ? "
" Well , you can't do anything about it ." He said smugly.
-Draco revealing his in-charge of the house side.
As he was about to lay on his own bed , an egg suddenly popped up and went up flying . With it's sight , Harry's eyes grew impossibly wide and his magic subconsciously caught the egg.
He was silently talking with Hermione when suddenly his scare throbbed and started hurting. Pain spread across his forehead as he let out a pained groan and lowered himself to the ground.
- The pensive is read .
Harry and Draco stood up at once . Harry's cold voice commanded ," Stand down "
His hand lay on Malfoy's throat as he gently curled his fingers over it to cover the delicately translucent skin .
"I told you that it would be worse than a slap next time, didn't I ? Then why did you do it ? WHY DID YOU STEAL HARRY?!? WHY?!?! "
A piece of brick heavily flew over to Draco, who was helpless of his voice or magic and only able to use his body as a shield. Even then, some pieces still flew in the direction of a fragile shell-covered being as a dreadful sound echoed in his ear.
Hearing the sly and clever words suggesting and insulting him at the same time while also implying that Draco's effort was wasted on Harry. Harry looked at Pansy in amusement, chuckling under his breath, "Slytherins..."
" Go find Potter and tell him to come here instead of returning to the manor. It's not safe anymore "
Others looked after her curiously, several moments passed and Hermione came out again with a book in her hands.
So , he did .
Draco was shocked , " what ? Muggle transport ? Why?"
Walking forward , something silently slipped out of his hand to soundlessly drop on the carpeted floor.
Getting closer, Harry asked again, " Why? "
Now that he mentioned it, Draco does remember a third presence other than Harry and Luar that time in the cave. He was partially conscious that time. The presence also was the one who saved him at the last bend of the ritual.
" Apologize " Harry's voice sounded. He looked at Ron as if looking at a stranger.
-Draco treats Harry and removes Nagini's poison.
and with a single thought the butterfly got stuck on the dewy web.
" What about the herbs ? Where can we get them ?"
Putting on a pitiful and innocent act he said , " I am a acquirer , prayer of wondrous objects "
" That window is still open ! " , Hermione shouted.
It is true when philosophers say that sometimes simple instincts are more accurate and useful than a genius brain.
His eyes first widened and then narrowed. His half lidded pupils darkly looked at Draco. In a second , an astounded Draco was beneath Harry's body . His eyes shining a shade of verdant green displayed an unspeakable danger, hiding deep evil. He slowly leaned down his lips brushing against soft lobes of Draco's ears.
A nod answered Harry's question .
This time the old witch didn't reply.
This chapter is Draco's POV with little Harry's POV. Draco feels that what happened that night in infirmary was a dream and is quite sure of it and dismisses it just like that but harry remembers and now he views Draco as innocent but is not entirely sure what Draco really is. All he knows is that Draco does not want to do what he is doing. On the other hand Draco tries his best to find ways to remove dark mark for his mother and other Slytherins in Hogward's whom he considers his sworn siblings, whose parents no longer care if they lived or died. Draco feels this is his responsibility as these people have seen him as their leader consciously or unconsciously for years and now that they have no one to rely on and no political support or guarantee of life, Draco will not leave them alone for the ministry to catch and blame. They are his people, his snakes, after all.
Minutes passed but neither gave up. Draco could feel his muscles weaken due to his lack of energy, could feel Harry's grip bruising his arms. His eyes burned but, he did not know if it was from anger or pain at his situation. It was as if years of emotions which were choked up in his heart, all threatened to break free. They were clogging up his throat and pooling in his eyes. The dam he had built around his emotions was starting to overflow. With its opening shut tight, refusing to let even a drop escape, the dam was filled to the brim, threatening to shatter completely. As the first crack appeared, the first drop slid down the sickly pale cheeks. More cracks appeared as more drops fell. Soon a part of the dam fell and a strangled voice echoed the infirmary. As the dam shattered completely, so did the struggles .
" We don't know yet . All we know is that they will be entering through the room of requirements and going to the astronomy tower " answered Harry, omitting half the truth .
" Potter ?" Came a sleepy and hoarse whisper.
Even if she didn't speak, her eyes shone hidden curiosity and happiness as she slowly ate. She wasn't very comfortable moving her body so when Hermione helped her with the fish, she happily ate it. But what made her even more happy was that Hermione noticed such a small detail about her and that she personally helped her. She secretly felt ecstatic in her heart.
The man looked at them with an expression as if planning to play with his favorite toys and said, "Well, well. Looks like my efforts in disciplining you wretched brats finally bore fruit."
Hermione looked down at the curvy yet charming beauty who was eagerly looking up at her. She was so close, her plum chest only a hair's breadth away from Hermione's own. The heat she radiated as if scorched Hermione. A rush of electric and tingling buzz travelled down her entire body and embarrassment flooded her. She hurriedly averted her gaze.
And with this , the man turned around and left by the same steps he came.
As he glanced around, a door at the back opened and a middle aged witch stepped out.
A deep look appeared on Luar's face . He did not tell Draco that there were no connections at all as he did not want to panic the boy . But now hearing what Draco said , he fell into all the possibilities that can happen and realised that most of them indicated a problem with Draco's mother's character and intentions . Staying away is the most suitable now for Draco .
Getting up he made his way towards the horde . Harry watched sitting at the side . Draco carefully healed Ron as all of them silently obeyed him and helped him. This was why he did what he did.
Moving back to stand straight, Harry caught the sight of Draco innocently rubbing his eyes, tears gathering at the end of his silky lashes.
His face frowned in worry. Getting up, he swiftly walked to Harry, saying, "Pansy had gone to the washroom half and hour ago and still hasn't returned"
Taking the last sip, Harry could feel the satisfaction and contentment in the air around Draco.
"Nagini", Harry said in a tight voice.
It was then that Harry realised that his disguise had worn off . As soon as they got off the lift , shouts rang out , " Harry Potter ! That's Harry Potter! "
The soft morning light shone through the fluttering white curtains, casting an enchanting hue of soft white on the bed.
Trailing down , a panting mouth moved across the rising and falling chest as a rough hand slowly slid past the waist belt and on the small tent there . Very lightly resting on top of it and feeling the small twitch .
He came here to do and find out what he couldn't yesterday. But looking at this sight all his will dissipated as if warm steam into air . Sighing , he pulled the covers further up , as he looked at Draco as he fell in deeper sleep .
" Master Draco is so nice to Kreacher but why was Master Draco never nice to Dobby ? Dobby only begs Master Draco to tell him this " the elf's head lowered as if waiting for a strike to land in his face .
Sitting down , they closed their eyes as she said ," We are thankful to you , mother , for giving us the food on our table , air to breath , water to drink , people to cherish and magic to protect ."
" Good morning to you as well . Had a good sleep ?"
Something about Draco just drew his whole body in. He was just so attractive. Even in a crowd of millions, Harry was sure that his eyes would automatically find Draco . It won't even take him a second. It was as if Draco was glowing.
Pansy's frown deepened. She swiftly moved , frantically opening her travelling purse to find something. Sometime went by and when she didn't find what she wanted , Pansy again lifted her chin up. Gripping her own sleeve ending in her own finger , she lifted her arm high to carefully wipe Hermione's cheeks.
Under more than a hundred eyes , Harry walked out with swag , displaying his pot belly proudly.
Harry soon noticed the smooth reddened manhood standing erect near his own buried in Draco's hole. Haah ! Such a whore !
Luar , who was troubled by Draco's words , sounded ," You don't understand , Draco . Let alone defend yourself , you won't even be able to survive removing that slave mark !! "
"Not flattering, telling facts."
Rin made his way to stand beside his wife , laying his hand on her shoulder as a form of support.
"Anyway let bygones be bygones and let the dead be dead. So, let's look at you now. Hmm~ Harry Potter, is it ? Parents are dead, giving a difficult childhood, bought to Hogward's at eleven. Strong magic, stable body, Sharp mind.  Hmm~ Hmm~  Interesting, very interesting. Child, you sure are a once in a century genius. Such power, such mind but unfortunately not much of control. But that can be fixed and in no time you will be my first student, carrying on my great legac--"
"It's okay. You believe me, don't you?"
Someone broke in the house .
Harry still kept his gaze vigilant on the old witch as she slowly turned around, "I don't exactly know. And that's the problem."
, was the only thought in Draco's head as a bright light enveloped him. And the next second, he disappeared. The books Draco was reading slowly rose by themselves and took their given places in the shelves, even his robes disappeared.
-Draco buys Harry a gift.
" Death eaters ? But how ?" Asked Pansy .
" Ahm ...ahm" came an inquiring sound from the Headmaster's throat.
The words in his heart that he wanted to convey so much but didn't know how were restlessly blooming in his heart , melting in his blood , mixing with the air in his lungs at every exhale and eventually seeping into the body pressed against his.
"WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE?!"
The sensation of a small wet paw resting on his forearm was too clear and distinguished. Draco didn't dare look down.
Before the man could reply , he very quickly added ," That is , if you don't mind ."
In this chapter ,
Another death eater smiled in satisfaction, happy to see a youth with the same likes as their own, saying, " You surely know your game, Heir Zabini. It's rare to find such a cultivated gentleman with superior hobbies as you now-a-days. The ranks aren't too far for you"
" Yes ,let's go . I have made all your favourites . Meat pie , baked chicken and your favorite chocolate cake and much more. "
Walking towards the great hall, Draco thought over and over about what he must do and what his future held . If he stayed with the dark lord , death is the cloud floating above him at every moment . He is like an animal trapped in a cage like a pet, having comfort but not having control over his own life and death . If he chose to side with the light , then sacrifice is the price paid. Both of these will take everything he has . So he has to take the only option left.
Horcrux , one of the most evil magics to exist , was known and used by The dark Lord. That explains why he did not die .
" In case of danger , only fight if there is no option left . Keep in contact with the perfects of all the houses . Somehow convince them to keep changing their dormitory passwords frequently " Draco informed .
Stepping up , Pansy, Hermione, Theo and Ron revealed. Soon all of them were sitting down on the floor. Pansy spoke first, " Do we all absolutely agree on the coalition?"
With start ,Draco , now with dry and clear eyes,  asked as well, "Is everyone alright ? Are all my snakes alright ?"
A single eyebrow raised as a smirk took on Harry's face. Draco's mouth fell open.
He watched as the pill colourlessly dissolved before anyone could see it . Draco sighted with glee as Harry ignorantly picked up the glass to sip and soon emptied it . Now Draco only has to wait a day before knowing the result .
Harry had always thought Draco as someone vile and crafty, someone who will grovel at the feet of Voldemort just for power, someone without morals. But what he saw that night had inevitably planted a seed of doubt. He speculated what made Draco do all this. What forced him? His own life? His family? Surely, it might be his mother. Draco was not a self sacrificing person. Harry could not tell what it ultimately was. So he decided to observe Draco for now. See if his speculations were true or not.
He closed his eyes and focused on the melody and a smile as beautiful as a nightly blooming flower , incomparably breathtaking but shrouded in shadows ,  missed by all and noticed by none.
how are you guys ? I hope everything is going fine in your life and if its not, the I hope that this chapter atleast gives you a bit of a smile. Everything is going fine for me. I am kinda under stress but i hope it will turn out all right in the future.
Yaxley stood up in alarm and Umbridge said in surprise , " What on earth are you doing , Albert ?"
Harry maintained his calm and stepped out. Thin strands of sweat dropped down Hermione's forehead. Harry stepped forward without a look back .
Giving up , he asked ," Is there no other way ? Anyway to do it faster ?"
"Draco? What Draco?! Leave Draco! Look there! What is that?!"
Draco sat up as he endearingly looked at them, wordlessly wondering about the missing member between them. He was terribly worried about Blaise, but his trust in Blaise and his abilities was far more than pointless worry.
"Why won't you leave?"
Truly terrible.
"That eggie would look like this?"
A furious hand angrily dashed forward to wrap around the stupid offending stick.
Strong fingers held Draco's chin, forcing him to look up at Harry, "Where does it hurt?"
The slender arms were around him, hugging him like a koala clung to its tree.Harry's warm eyes soon darkened and became hot. His boiling blood from last night still didn't completely cool down. It didn't take much to set it bubbling again. In fact, the sight of Draco's face and memories from yesterday were enough.
He opened his eyes to look in the enlarged eyes of Draco Malfoy. A whispered voice asked ," why ?"
" I have to go now . You know I can't stay here ." This alerted his parents as a look of shock and worry passing through their eyes .
Their banter went back and forth as Ron thought,
" Stop ! How-how can you say it like that? It sounds- it sound like --"
" OHH, Malfoy ,is it ?"; Eloise beamed, excited at finding a fellow ancient soul .
The perfect and clear sound of
Ron who was crushed in between the two grimaced as the wound on his shoulder throbbed with pain due to the pressure.
And Hermione sucked all her saddness and reluctance inside and said strongly, "Yes"
" They are still trusted ones . Just much more suitable for direct and simple missions ",  was the reply he got .
" Eggie is very hungry . I can feel it . Only my blood won't fill it's stomach so I bit you as well . He is a growing egg , afterall !"
--------------------------------------------------------
As he fell , A pan flew from Kreacher's hand to his head in a vicious attack. Kreacher walked to dutifully closed the opened door , saying all the while , " As requested, Kreacher has returned with the thief "
" Don't worry , I won't . "
His dad said ," What happened , son ?"
He just sat there, his body motionless other than the tremble in his round shoulders. Head bowed to hide those molten silver eyes.
"Hmmm, it has herbs and by the smell they are of the top quality. I don't know what kind of potion it is but it isn't a life threatening one. It smells like a vitality potion to some extent but not entirely. Something is a bit different. You should drink it. It's probably a highly effective healing potion. It has all the healing agents but minimum impurities. That boy is surely a genius to make this. He seems to be meaning well for you. And so humble as to do it unknowingly ! Perhaps he's scared of your reaction. You have been at each other's neck for so long. He surely is insecure, thus chose to care for you secretly. "
Questions swirled in her head but her eyes were stuck on the pale figure.
Draco did as told and found that he could see the inside of the ring. The space was as big as his dorm and had the shelves placed properly in it . Just to experiment , he tried to pull an object with his magic and found it immediately in his hand .
" And how is that going to happen ?"
Time passed and the pain continued to mount . He could not feel his body . The pain numbed everything . Unable to hold on anymore , Draco swayed slightly .
" Oh… when did you get a master ?" Draco asked, surprised and bewildered.
He looked at Harry following Draco around like a miserable servant and then at Draco doing this and that while absolutely ignoring a particular green-eyed molester.
Ending their discussion, Harry and Draco moved to leave when a sudden sentence stopped them in their tracks .
With surprised eyes, Draco examined the pensive in Headmaster's hand as he slowly poured the smoky memory in the palette of insights . The substance seamlessly dissolved and disappeared in the clear liquid.
Slughorn sat silent looking at Harry searching his face for something negative. Lowering his head again , he said ,"Please don't hate me ."
" Tell me , Ron . Who ? "
Everyone : "..."
------------------------------------
" Shut up ! Stop ! Don't say it like that !"
Last summer he searched through the whole library in Malfoy mansion, wanting to know anything and everything that could help. The pro was that everyone thought that he was doing it to spend the summer away and no one suspected anything. Con was that it took too much time.
" Courting is with the intention to marry, isn't it? I myself have never done so but I do know the proper customs. If you tell me at the start of your courting then I will be having sufficient time to collect a wealthy dowry till the wedding" ; Dumbledore rambled on with a happy expression.
Here comes the second chapter ! So our first bout of smut is here. It my first time writing smut ever ( excluding the non-con from ' I wish I had never met you' )
Even if Pansy was thin , her weight was something considerable , though not much for Hermione , only enough to make her slightly bend forward. Hermione felt the soft mounds of an ample chest and a warm body slightly more curvy than herself on her back. The warmth burned her as if ignited hot coal.
Draco's bony and slender palms  overlapped Harry's own much larger ones. Draco's hands were so pale that the veins inside seemed like rivers of blue flowing through misty valleys. The nails pink and small, the fingers long and defined. These hands were the ones who punched Harry's face and ripped his clothes at various occasions. How can they still look so delicate ?
She walked to him. Her hand slowly lifted to caress the pale cheeks.
Outside the infirmary, two figures stood with their heads down. The taller on holding onto the more petite one as she muffled her cries in his shirt. They were both overwhelmed by the scene. Ron and Hermione had left the dinner early to warn Harry about Professor McGonagall requesting all the professors for an urgent meeting and witnessed this scene after getting here. They were first shocked and then grieving for someone they never thought they would. The figures soon left as it was getting hard to just be there hearing their enemy's hoarse cries as he wept on their best friend's chest.
Draco restrained himself from looking down as he ignored whatever it was again.
" You're a genius. Draco, once I knew a boy....who made all the wrong choices. Please , let me help you -"
"Hold on a little longer . Do not give up . " A stern but worried voice sounded in his ear .
Harry sighed. How is he going to survive not touching him? His existence is like an aphrodisiac made especially for Harry.
" What is happening to him?!", He asked in a fearful tone.
Harry had trapped him there. Albeit for his own protection . But still, he had locked Draco in a place where only Harry could be able to see him.
-The appereance of Nagini.
Standing up, Harry grasped Draco's elbow and pulled him to stand in front of Ron.
Hello Readers,
Without further ado, Draco fled towards Harry. He knew very clearly that offensive duels and such deadly fights weren't something he was proficient in. So, listening to Harry was his best chance to survive rather than playing on his own. He trusted Harry enough to get both of them unscathed out of here.
A slight tilt was felt beneath his hand.
The Slytherins were filled with worry and unwillingness. But the Gryffindors beside them were entirely stuffed with dread and impending doom.
Four small bottles lifted up and as Harry gave his final nod . All of them emptied at once .
Ron stood in the huge and cheerful crowd, watching as his elder brother and new sister-in-law danced in graceful twirlls and circles . It bought him a solace to see the smile on their faces and the unconditional love in their eyes. He was happy that they got their share of heaven before hell descended.
Drawing out his wand , Harry made a sharp cut on his palm . Looking ahead , he found Draco doing the same. With their hands lifted high, Harry slowly pressed their hands closer , he let their bloods mingle and mix together .
All of them. Each and every one of them.
*Heaven's golden son - an extremely fortunate person who brings good luck to himself as well as people around him.
Looking into his eyes, Draco tsked with a sneer and cold fury in his eyes. He refused to answer and let Harry get what he wants.
Draco's eyes grew wide with horror and the nausea overtook his body. He ran to a distance before bending over and vomiting everything over the carpeted floor. Face scrunched with horror and fear, Draco sprinted to the stairs Harry took minutes ago. He opened the door with a bang and saw Harry on the floor, a huge snake wrapped around him, throttling him.
