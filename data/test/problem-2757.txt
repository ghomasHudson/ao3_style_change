Potter takes another after-dinner mint, which is rude as there were only two in the first place. “I think you should call me Harry,” he says around a mouthful of what was rightfully Draco’s.
Potter’s nose scrunched up as he smiled, and Draco realized that it would be hard to get one up on him, but that wouldn’t stop him from trying.
“Is that what upsets you? Did he react badly?”
“Who cares what she said. The waltz is outdated, we aren’t 80-year-old wizards who do nothing but sip on Elfish wine and berate the younger generation while they gossip about the days when they could prostrate around and pretend they were Merlin incarnate.”
Choosing his own beliefs was something he was already doing. Perhaps not as quickly as others, but it was a personal battle—one that Draco was taking to heart. At the very least, Regulus had shaped the decision to choose for himself.
Harry snorts. “You’re so up yourself. I’ll make sure I don’t wear any leather around you in case it makes you hot and bothered.”
, I would probably start by asserting some kind of control over my partner.” Draco brushes his fingers against the nape of Harry’s neck, pleased to feel him shiver at the touch. “I would tell him to strip for me, perhaps, or have him on his knees for a while. He could take me in his mouth to get me hard.” Draco glances at Harry’s hand on his thigh, his fingers flexing against the thick denim of his jeans as Draco talks. “I’m quite fond of traditional methods too, as it happens. I would definitely ask my hypothetical partner to get his fingers and his cock well-lubed, so he could spend a lot of time fucking me. Ideally, he wouldn’t be allowed to come unless I said so. I want a top with a submissive streak that can take instruction
The date 1 July for the first Magical Persons Pride Parade was chosen as it is the date of the first London Pride. The date of that Pride was selected as the nearest Saturday to the anniversary of the Stonewall Riots.
“Stockings, suspenders…” Harry’s breath hitches and he laughs quietly.
“Why should I?” Draco demanded, comfortable enough to glare again.
As Umbridge began a lecture on whether the Dark Lord had returned or not, Draco kept his eyes on Potter. Each word she spoke resonated with Potter, negatively.
“I’m always right.”
Draco held on tighter, unsure of what to say to make any of it alright.
“Do you know the person?”
“Draco, about time you got here.” Neville’s eyes were doing an odd wide and then recede motion that Draco assumed was supposed to mean something—but it wasn’t as if he was knowledgeable on silent cues of the desperate.
“I’ll see you around, Malfoy.”
Draco stood up, trying not to be disappointed.
Granger walked to a section that Draco would have bet fifty galleons he had
“I said you looked snooty and annoying, nobody said anything about drooling.”
“Thanks.” Harry knocks back the shot, giving Draco a light shrug that says
“Your lack of words are far more comforting than if you had made something up. I can feel your honesty.”
Fill my box, put some nougat in it
Draco had to bite his lip to stop from snorting.
spreading gossip, nor was she students that disagreed with him. Umbridge had the power to back up her words. She was more of a threat than people realized, and Potter was playing right into her hands.
“Can we—” Draco cut off as he shook his head.
“Diggory brought
“Do your relatives—are they—” Draco was cut off by a raised hand.
“Warrick has informed me that you hexed Zabini earlier.”
“Now who’s the prick?” Draco questioned before walking away, the sound of Potter’s laughter trailing after him.
“Only strangers?” Harry murmurs, his eyes tracing Draco's lips like a caress.
Draco changes the topic of conversation from his business and pushes all further thoughts of Potter’s appearance to one side.
“If you think they can’t spot a muggleborn, then you aren’t as smart as I thought.”
“No, I don’t. That’s not what I’m asking.” Draco’s sweating because he doesn’t think he’s ever been so unflinchingly honest with anyone, before. He’s never really been in a position that necessitated this kind of conversation.
“What do you mean?” Granger asked, a curious glint to her tone.
.” Draco pushes back with a groan, his body almost shaking with want. Harry nudges Draco over, letting him take the weight off his hands and knees. He murmurs a charm to lift Draco’s backside a little as if there’s a cushion beneath it, and he slides two fingers back inside Draco. His fingers are covered with lube, sweat and come and it’s such a messy, filthy moment, it’s all Draco can do not to ask Harry to start fucking him all over again.
Potter swore before he turned to the side and effectively shutting her out of the group.
Then why did he care? Draco didn’t understand the point of the discussion. If Potter wasn’t going to remain expelled, then what was the point?
“I don’t like to share my things,” Draco says, honestly.
“I’ve been to Dean Street before,” Draco replies. He glances at Harry and can tell his mind is whirring. “I knew I couldn't cast protective spells on Muggles without breaking the law and one more misdemeanor and they would have thrown me in Akaban and chucked away the key. My father's preferred Healer wouldn't entertain the possibility of sex with Muggles, let alone other men. St Mungo's didn't give me any information besides what I knew already, but I always just put that down to being a Malfoy. I stopped trusting Healers after a while.”
They stared at each other, emotions Draco hoped weren’t in his eyes shown in Potter’s.
one who can demonstrate a bit of stamina and force when he’s topping. You would be amazed how hard they are to find.”
getting to him.”
“Si—Snuffles!”
Draco nodded as the last student left and closed the door.
The thought sends a shiver of pleasure through Draco and he makes a mental note to test that theory. He rather likes the thought of texting Harry on his Muggle mobile or Fire Calling him, demanding he come over immediately and attend to Draco’s needs.
. As much as he might have worked on improving himself over the years since the war, in this, at least, Draco knows he is just as he ever was. He simply does not like to share.
“I keep a lot of things quiet.” Potter shrugs.
“I reckon you both used up all your dramatics. Who says you have any left?”
“We’d all like it if you did.” Greg stares at his hands. “Was difficult for a bit there, after the war.”
“Thank you, Malfoy. You can be a good guy. When you want to be.”
“I think he was telling the truth,” Draco whispered, eyes still on the ground. He wasn’t sure what kind of answer his father was expecting. “Diggory’s death was no accident.”
Neville smiled brightly as he flopped on the ground more firmly.
He managed to turn around, but before he could walk forward, an arm wrapped around his waist and another around his neck.
As Draco left the classroom, an owl’s hoot had him looking up in time to see the bird drop an envelope on his head.
He bit his lip as he thought over the letter one last time. Regulus had said the next generation could be their salvation or damnation.
Potter leaned forward and whispered, “I’d like that. The ball can be a night for ourselves.”
sign casts peculiar shadows on his face, lifting his cheekbones and making his teeth glow strangely in the light as he opens his mouth and closes it again. Draco is acutely aware of how close they are; pressed into the small space behind the curtain. Harry’s breath is ragged and loud in the quiet box of a room. He reaches for Draco and clutches his arm as he struggles to control the jagged huffs of breath that hiss from between his lips.
“None of this is what I wanted.”
“Why?”
“Honestly?” Draco smirks at Harry, as if he, Draco Malfoy, is the paragon of truth-telling.
“I’ll always support you,” he whispered. “Even if you wanna commit murder.”
Neville’s voice was the relief Draco needed. He smiled gratefully as he got up. He’d rather eat in the kitchens than eat with the rest of his house. Perhaps Dobby would have some free time to talk.
Draco shrugged once, unsure of why he felt like he was missing an inside joke.
Neville’s smile grew wider. “Then I’ll see it for you.”
“I just have to keep practicing.”
and Draco knows what the public think of the fact the Malfoys retained a significant portion of their wealth after the war. He doesn’t want to pull at that thread when he and Potter seem to have reached a tentative truce of sorts. Draco can’t help the niggling feeling that any attempt to explain the impact the post-war years had on the Malfoy family would amount to defending the indefensible.
“Mister Malfoy,” Pomfrey started with a sigh. “The school rules require any hospital wing visit to be notified back to the parents. I am sorry, but your father
“You disappoint me.”
“Right. I’m going to pretend I was never here. You are going to pretend I was never here, and we’ll all just move on.”
“And the Aurors questioned her sanity.”
“Obviously, Potter.” Draco hooks Harry’s legs over his arms and then lifts himself up a little to position himself properly. “Okay?” Draco isn’t usually an
Green light exploded outward as it lit up the clearing briefly. The colour had Draco nervous and he hoped his father wouldn’t kill the Muggles.
The little street is a cosy, winding space with dappled cobbles and weather-beaten brickwork which stretches up on either side of the narrow path. The shop fronts are dark and dusty, paint peels on the signage outside bars nestled alongside one another and outside a pub called the Joiner's Arms a lone rainbow flag waves in the breeze. It's the only part of the dusty street that looks well-maintained, as if it's been positioned to welcome new visitors to Little Compton Street. Unlike Diagon Alley the street is entirely covered by a cavernous arch, yet despite the extensive brickwork there’s an airiness to the space which suggests the roof is little more than an illusion. Whatever the magic involved, it gives the sense of being underground but without the damp darkness that reminds Draco of the Malfoy cellars or the Slytherin rooms deep in the belly of Hogwarts. The brickwork is dotted with candles which cast an inviting orangey light into the space, reminding Draco of the sun-burnished streets of London on a summer’s afternoon. Brightly coloured silk ribbons flutter and twist, and upside-down umbrellas in a wide variety of colours hang suspended in the air.
“We summoned the short thread.”
“Practices?”
“I’m sure he’ll be delighted to hear you acquired an illegal piece of Muggle technology from me.”
“I don’t know anything about what you
“Dumbledore is going to teach me Occlumency instead. Snape decided it would be better off in the hands of someone less biased.”
The dog didn’t calm down, but that wasn’t a surprise, Draco didn’t hold faith in his calming abilities—that was Neville’s area of expertise.
Neville smiled softly. “In that case, you are welcome.”
“Wrong?” Dobby whispered as his hands retreated slightly but were still in touching range.
“Are you looking for something?” Granger asked as she gestured to the books Draco had haphazardly put back.
“Is that so?” Severus looked to Draco and he tried to jerk his head towards the fireplace in a way that would suggest the Potter had gone through, but he was never good at reading Severus.
, Draco tells himself.
“The Ministry assigned you to me. That doesn’t mean you can slack off! You’re a sentenced Death Eater at work, not a high-society pureblood on a pleasure cruise! So stop standing around and… Get. To. Work!”
Potter looks distrustful but after a moment he stops fishing around for his wallet. He picks up his fork and tugs the plate back towards him. He could do with a decent meal, in Draco’s opinion. His jumper is bigger than usual, and his eyes are framed by dark shadows. He points his fork at Draco. “Not another word.”
“It’s been nearly thirty-six hours. I think that’s pretty good, considering there was a time we couldn’t do thirty-six minutes.” Harry hands Draco his clothes, which have been freshly washed and folded with cleaning charms. He must have done that when Draco was asleep. “Do you want to change?”
“You going to turn me in?” Neville smiled innocently, something Draco would
“Thanks ever so.”
“You know what,” Weasley whispered, voice awed. “I just thought of something. Sirius’ brother was Death Eater, wasn’t he?”
That would make sense if it was truly a letter from Regulus, which he had begun to think it might have been.
“However, I will not overlook your only heir besmirching your good standing by parading around with Potter. You have promised me his servitude, and I aim to collect.”
They both looked at him, brows arched but said nothing.
“Harry!” Elder Weasley called, drawing the attention of several people. Draco never could remember his name. Periwinkle? Parcel? Preston? Something with a P. “I’ve saved you a seat.”
Draco frowned as he fully woke up. He wasn’t sure why he was awake—it had taken ages for the rest of the dorm to stop gossiping about the Triwizard Tournament and actually go to bed.
“I wasn’t expecting that,” she remarked a bit hesitantly. “But it changes nothing.”
“A secret for a secret, Potter,” Draco says. “That’s how it works.” They didn’t sort him into Slytherin for nothing.
“Fine.” Draco rolls his eyes and returns to his paper. He takes a glance at Potter wolfing down his breakfast down as if he hasn’t eaten a proper meal in days. A kernel of curiosity niggles at him. Have things really gone so disastrously wrong for Potter that he has nowhere to go for decent food anymore? Draco forces himself to make a show of reading his paper, even though the sentences blur together, and he can’t focus on much more than the clink and scrape of cutlery against china and the whispered conversation between Potter and the waiter that is slightly too quiet for Draco to catch.
“It’s a good thing he likes you as you are, then.” Neville waggled his brows, and for the millionth time in his life, Draco was eternally grateful to have Neville at all.
Neville grinned widely as he extended his bent arm and allowed Draco to loop his own. “Come on, let’s go find some trouble to get into while we wait for your champion to get back.”
“I like him, too.” The words barely whispered and far too vulnerable.
Potter grins at Draco. “No, it’s a dinosaur. I got it when I was in New York.”
“Which
“Where’s this flat of yours?”
Harry seems relieved, even though Draco’s quite sure he’s been naked in a flash with other people who have come back to the flat. It doesn’t cause the same tug of jealousy as it might, because it makes Draco glad that they’re not just getting straight to the fucking in an attempt to ignore the need for a proper conversation at some stage. He doesn’t have any interest in being one of Harry Potter’s one-night stands.
They turned around suddenly with narrowed eyes.
“Very fancy,” Draco observes. He goes through the cupboards until he finds the coffee, switching the machine on and leaning against the counter with his arms folded as he watches Harry. “Do you want one before you shower?”
my ancestral home treating you?”
“Tell me what you like most in bed.” Harry’s voice is a peculiar combination of rough and breathless.
“Oi, hold your tongue.”
“Are you stupid? That’s not going to be big enough. Too confined.”
“Oh, my dad is recovering from an attack, but he’s alright.”
“He is fifteen, Fred.
“I’m proud of who I am, proud of who my father was, even if he made mistakes—he loved me, I know he did. His actions shouldn’t be taken out on me, nor should I be held accountable. I just wish Snape could see that. If he wants to blame someone, then why can’t it be my father? Why should I be the conduit for his grudges?”
“Do I need a reason to talk to you?”
Draco frowned as he folded the latest letter and put it away. In the beginning, he thought that they might have been more informative than anything, but now he wasn't sure what Regulus' intentions were. It honestly appeared as if Regulus just needed someone to talk to.
Draco shook his head and burrowed closer when strong arms tightened.
“James, I’m guessing.” Harry gives Draco a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. “My dad.”
Draco can practically feel Potter looking at him and he shakes his head. He’s not entirely sure what
Harry whispers Draco’s name as he closes the distance between them. The kiss is as unexpected as it is inevitable, because even in this Harry manages to be full of contradictions. The kiss that starts with a slow, tentative pressure quickly becomes something else entirely. The force of Harry’s body pins Draco against the wall, his hand gripping Draco’s waist and the other sliding to cup Draco’s jaw. The silver band of the ring he always wears is cool against Draco’s skin where everything else is hot.
“The baby?” Regulus questioned, his nose turned upward and his lips downcast in a frown. “A baby got rid of the Dark Lord?”
“You always have before,” Draco pointed out, tone light but curious.
“So you and Lovegood, huh?”
“Pleased to meet you.” Draco shakes Aisha’s hand. “I’ll do what I can.”
“Some,” Draco said with a shrug. “But not enough.”
“Yes, well.” Draco shakes his head and doesn’t look at Harry. “Not tonight. I don’t want to talk about that tonight.”
With the hall empty, Draco wasted no time in tearing it open.
“Only if you let them,” Draco argued. “If you allow those voices the power to sway your opinion of yourself, then those who are drowning won’t ever make a difference. Why silence those who wish to help? Doing so only raises the negativity.”
“I’m versatile, if that was your question.” Draco makes it sound casual, as if he’s not sitting unthinkably close to Potter, talking about sexual preferences.
“Who said you would be the one asking?”
Arousal pulses through Draco at that, because for some fortuitous, inexplicable reason, Harry has hit on what Draco likes. The idea of putting Harry—fit as fuck Harry—to
“Potter,” he nodded his head in greeting, a small quirk of his lips formed when Potter reached forward to grab his hand.
“Sure,” Potter said easily as if Draco hadn’t made an odd comment, and he might have fallen just a little bit more for Potter in that moment.
.” The slap of Draco’s hand against his cock and the sound of Harry fingering his lube-slick body is maddening. Harry’s breath is hot against his skin, his words driving Draco to distraction.
The laugh left him when he saw the headline of the article underneath the announcement of a new Minister.
“You’re having me on, aren’t you?”
Moody cleared his throat before placing the spider back inside the glass, eyes wide but not remorseful. Draco hated him—hated everything about the lesson.
A picture of Potter on his knees for the handsome young waiter flashes through Draco’s mind and he curls his fingers into a fist, trying his damnedest to banish any further images. “Once you found out it was me, why did you come back?”
“Just don’t lose sight of what you want.”
“Want to do everything with you.” Harry’s voice is gruff, his lips damp against Draco’s. “I’ve wanted this for such a long time.”
“She knows we are friends, and while she’s not thrilled with the idea, she noticed how good you are for me, and you
Draco runs his tongue over his lips, his voice rough. “I’ve fucked you a thousand times in my dreams.”
“No, I don’t mind.” Draco slips off his coat and looks for somewhere to hang it, eventually setting for a chair. There’s a sparseness to Harry’s flat, with its exposed brickwork, timber and highly-polished kitchen. The open-plan area contains none of the trinkets or signs of family and friends that Draco would expect Harry to have in his house. He can only assume that all of those things stayed in Godric’s Hollow with Ginny or moved to Grimmauld Place after the

Harry blinked. "Really?"
"Look, we can work this out," she said reasonably. Oh Goddess, she'd known this would be difficult. She tried to calm herself as she put down the bowl she was washing and dried her hands. He just had to be made to see her side. He had to see that she was tired of doing things his way, had been putting off London for years, and it wasn't fair to her career to be stuck here in Dublin forever.

"Right, then." Harry accio'd the bottle and Draco accio'd glasses, and Harry motioned over to the small couch in the room.
He swallowed as the image of Draco cried and drew in on himself, shivering and angry with himself for his weakness, for his failure, for disappointing Lucius.

"So did you teach him how?" Flint asked, and Draco looked at him questioningly. "Potter. Did you teach him how to suck you?"
This is a DVD Extra for scrtkpr, nimue, My Secret Pleasure, and a few others who asked for "Boys! Getting a clue and getting back together!"
Draco only remembers the cool soothing feel of Harry underneath him, the brightness of his climax, the brief respite from hurt.
"Yeah, all right."
"They're Weasley twins," Fred shot back.
"Yes, he is - not here right now, he's at the Muggle entrance, picking up Ben's mother."
"Why not?"
"How?"

Harry ran a hand through his hair, frustrated. "Yeah. Adds a whole new set of troubles when it's a mostly Muggle building, doesn't it?" He blew out his breath. "This wouldn't be a problem if he was living with me, you know," he muttered irritably.
"You're awake," murmured Draco, settling into the chair next to him and holding out a tray with two teas and a plate of biscuits. Harry automatically took it, feeling almost awake.
"What?" Draco asked, squinting at his Shrivelfig and trying to decide whether he needed to order more.
"No, of course not, but I do wonder if maybe she put something in there to try to get us information. Maybe turn spy, or ask us to go get her."

son."
"Now look at the date," Draco pointed to the tastefully discreet "Chef's Special" display near their table.
Draco thought a moment. "Erm. Seven. Theo Nott, and five Muggles. And you."
"No, Harry, it was not," he said quietly. "If you were still simply classmates, this would merely be yet another example of your mutual hostility, and you would no doubt have earned yourselves several detentions and loss of points or privileges." He paused, his blue eyes deadly serious. "You are spouses. You broke bones and damaged school property. If you hadn't been stopped, you would have hexed one another. This is serious."
If he could just get a full night's good sleep, maybe tomorrow he would be able to face all of that. Maybe he would also be able to help Alec enjoy Ben's visit. And not wish that Draco had also stayed the night.

A bit, but it was just a fight. We'd done worse to each other before being bonded. The only reason it was a serious problem was that because of the bond, the teachers couldn't just take away House points and give us each a dozen detentions.

It wasn't that difficult a spell, thought Harry as he and Bill and Draco went over the words and practiced the incantation. Just tedious. And niggly. It didn't help that they had to be particularly careful that their magic didn't spill over and cause havoc to the Muggle parts of Draco's flat. Or that, from the frequent whines floating down the hall, it was evident that Kara's attempts to keep Ben and Alec cheerful and busy with the Wheezes toy wasn't going well at all.

What the... oh. He chuckled at the long scarf, in Slytherin green and grey, that Molly had begun knitting for Ben, and allowed him to take home when he wheedled her into it. She'd evidently charmed the needles to put on more rolls of yarn when they ran out, because the scarf was now probably long enough to keep most of Slytherin House cosy, with a few Ravenclaws thrown in as well.
"Right, Weasley, let's go," Parkinson says, and Ron spares one last glance at Harry, Hermione and Ginny before donning Harry's cloak and following Parkinson out of the hospital wing.
"Not generally a good idea to cast the more complex charms on a place that's your own, or as good as," said Bill. "They're too familiar to you; you're less likely to think of them as an attacker would. Besides, it's a bit difficult when you're trying to ward two places with the same people allowed into both of them; it's too easy to get mixed up with the barakas of the aural exceptions and end up casting a reflection shield that's too wide or has a primary/primal threshold energy that never mind," he broke off with a laugh at Draco's pained look. "Sorry, turned into Percy there for a moment. Anyway, trust me, Cursebreaker Credo: never ward your own place if you can help it. Or two places with the same people in them."
. “It’s busy here, tonight.”
That was the movement the Wizarding world needed. Draco wasn’t sure how to achieve that or how to achieve the first step in moving it forward, but it
As far as predictions went, Neville wasn’t wrong. Of course that was aided by Umbridge’s twenty-seventh decree, in which declared any student found in possession of the
“It’s not fair,” whispered Potter, tone both hard and quiet. “If he’s going to hate me, then I want it to be because of something I did, not something that happened before I was born.”
“I know what people think I am, and I know what some people expect me to be. But myself? I don’t know if I want to know.”
“You’re always getting hard for saving people,” Draco murmurs.
So, Regulus did the only thing he could. He wrote it all out and made sure that the next Malfoy heir would get a complete story, one that wasn’t biased, one that wasn’t shrouded in darkness aimed at being an infallible truth.
Draco leaned forward as a small smirk formed. “As long as you remain my elf, he can’t order you to speak of my secrets?”
“I love you, too, you dramatic dork.”
Draco leaves some cash on the table and grabs his coat. “Come on, then. Show me this pub of yours.”
, Malfoy?”
“Dobby learned from Draco.”
the right choice.
“Does it matter?” asked Potter incredulously. “Sirius needs our help!”
“Piss off.”
Why would Regulus suggest that the Dark Lord would come back? Or was Draco looking too deep into it? Was Regulus implying the war would have continued onward? It wasn’t as if Regulus could predict the future, perhaps things at the time seemed endless.
“Maybe with other people,” Draco teased. “But if it’s you, then no.”
“You’ve kind of shaped me too,” he whispered, eyes searching for
Draco stood up, gathering his bag as a few students joined him. When Neville didn’t stand, Draco looked to him in concern.
Draco looked up in time to see Potter shake his head. They locked eyes and Draco wished he could say that the pleased glint was something he resented.
“They
“But nothing Kreacher did worked!” Kreacher wailed, large tears forming in his eyes. “Master Regulus ordered Kreacher to get rid of it, but Kreacher couldn’t. Kreacher has failed Master Regulus.”
“Why do you care?”
Potter shrugs. “You specifically? At one time, perhaps. Not just you. Everything you were part of.”
“Lie to yourself, and even to your friends, but don’t lie to me,” Granger lifted her nose in the air haughtily and Draco had to restrain the urge to hex her.
“I’ll do my best.”
“I don’t like her the way I like you, Potter.”
One of the twins—Draco wasn’t sure who—cupped their chin while the other twin hummed thoughtfully.
Regulus congratulated Narcissa as soon as the news was confirmed. He smiled as warmly as he possibly could as a wave of nausea hit him hard.
“You can buy one another day, Potter,” Draco hisses. He yanks Harry away from the toys because thinking of
“Goodness.” The woman turns around and gives Harry a smile, her eyes flaring with momentary surprise as she notices Draco. “Fancy seeing you two here.”
“Fine.” Harry shrugs. “I’ve got nothing to hide.”
“Do not lecture on what you don’t understand.”
Harry slides his hand over Draco’s cock as he takes him, over and over. He murmurs another spell which skitters, twists and fizzes over Draco’s skin. Every press of Harry’s fingers against Draco’s over-sensitised body sends blissful sparks of pleasure through him. It’s only the two of them in this quiet flat, where the noise from London’s busy streets doesn’t even filter through the window. The breeze brings the scent of rainy London nights into the space and the cool air slides over Draco’s skin, chilly where Harry’s body is so, so hot. Harry works his slick hand over Draco’s cock, taking him to his climax with primal instinct, chasing their pleasure with every push of his cock deep inside Draco’s body, and every twist of his hand around Draco.
Potter glared down at Snuffles—horrible name, Draco felt bad for the poor dog.
Regulus’ head tilted back slightly as he continued to regard Draco closely.
Dobby looked to the ground as his ears fell. Draco knew he was going soft if pleading eyes could melt his ire.
Dobby flung forward, wrapping his arms around Draco’s neck. Draco held on tightly as he wondered if this would be the last time they saw each other.
“You could say that.”
The sound of bickering distracted Draco from the urge to vomit. He tore his eyes away from where the group of Death Eaters were levitating a muggle family.
“I thought I was supposed to be the bleeding heart?”
The sheets rustle again, and Draco can just about make out the slap of skin against skin. He can’t believe this is their second time having sex of a sort, and he still hasn’t had a close-up of what felt like a very pleasing part of Harry’s body.
Harry rubs his hand over his jaw and meets Draco’s smile with one of his own. “Go on, then. Do your worst.” His brow furrows. “Just nothing about my Mind Healer. Not tonight.”
As if their normal actions were enjoyable.
“I’m open to it.” Harry’s brow furrows. “I’ve always been open to it—sometimes I’m really into the idea of it—but it’s not quite been as good as I thought it would be when I was,” Harry makes a crude gesturing motion with his hand, “you know.”
Draco spluttered as he felt his cheeks heat up. The offer didn’t seem genuine, but it wasn’t the first time they had flirted with him. Before he could say something, a hand smacked the back of possibly George’s head.
“Done what?”
The Howler multiplied into three and they all began smoking. In Draco’s panic, he threw them on the floor and sent a bombarda at them.
“You will do better. I will be getting reports during your upcoming year and if there isn’t an improvement, then we will have another discussion—only one not as pleasant as this.”
“I’m not like you,” Draco whispered before he amended his statement. “I’m not like any of you. I didn’t choose a side like you did, Black. I didn’t think to question things, I never stopped to wonder whether or not my father’s teachings were right. I didn’t have a moral compass and part of that is my own fault. I never made an effort to try. At least not until the letters.
Draco sighs. Harry is such a nosy fucker. “I’m sure you’ll get them out of me at some point.” He realises he’s being rather selfish and slides his arm from his face, turning to Potter. “You haven’t come yet.”
Yule ball. Draco was positive it was a horrible idea. What did dancing matter in the scheme of the tournament? Seemed like an excuse to dress up and act like school unity existed.
Because Potter made Draco’s unfair life bearable as well.
Dumbledore clapped once in an attempt to draw everyone’s attention.
Draco isn’t sure that Harry gets it, but he seems to as he works his fingers into Draco, his voice ragged.
“Malfoy?”
there, then who cares if it’s a ploy as long as we can save him?” Harry said with pinched brows as his fingers jerked against his robes in a jittery manner.
A crack could be heard as they disappeared into a burst of glitter.
“No.” Potter shakes his head, his confusion clearing. “I don’t really do that.”
“We should have a name,” Harry exclaimed, his eyes bright.
“Fancy telling me the other nine?”
“No one is looking as closely as I am,” Draco admitted reluctantly.
oOoOo
of all people. Where was the belief in the boy who they placed on a pedestal all those years ago?
“Somewhere different for a change,” Potter agrees. He orders a beer instead of his usual tea and takes a long swig straight from the bottle when it arrives. “Good weekend?”
If someone as evil as the Dark Lord could use power to change the mindset of some, then surely, there was someone who could counter that. There had to be a way to change the minds of those with bigoted opinions.
He watched Potter move to his other side and had to wonder why Dobby had asked in the first place. It wasn’t until Dobby winked at him that he realized there wasn’t a reason at all. Merlin, he loved Dobby.
Draco didn’t care that Regulus thought his death wasn’t worth remembering, because to Draco it was. To him, it would be something he could never forget.
“I’m not sure I’m up for another one.” Harry rubs his jaw. Draco doesn’t believe it for a minute. Harry Potter will always be fighting for something, whether he wants to or not.
Lupin didn’t say anything until Draco looked up. There was a small frown marring his features, but he wasn’t overly kind.
“The same.” Draco struggles with trying to phrase the thoughts racing through his mind in a way that doesn’t send Potter running for the hills. “People think the places I went to were so seedy, but I never thought of them like that. I enjoyed it.”
“No one asked you. I see you don’t have a date. Did Parkinson say no? She would be the only one who would want to go with
“He sure did.”
“No,” Draco shook his head as he held up his hands, stalling whatever Potter might take back.
Draco wasn’t sure what to say. Warning Potter was the extent of his help—he didn’t want to do much else.
Dobby raised a hand and shook it slightly, indicating he was close.
When Draco peered up, Dobby was smiling warmly at him, and it had the tension evaporating.
“Are you alright?”
“Excuse you,” Potter said with a laugh. “How is that a fault? Shouldn’t that be a good thing?”
“I need you to make sure this letter has no spells hidden within.”
“It makes more sense to say nothing,” Draco continued, ignoring Potter’s question. “Cover it up and no one knows I was an idiot. But to seek justice for a farce? Draw attention to the cruel retribution? To harm those not responsible? What’s the point, Potter?”
Draco rolled his eyes as he took a step forward and whispered in Potter’s ears. “Have a bit of faith, will you?”
“I really liked tonight,” Potter whispered as they stopped near an ostentatious fountain that Draco’s father definitely would buy for no other reason than to put in the guest bathroom. “Being with you, I mean.”
“Do you do that?”
Draco slammed his hand against the table, and he ignored the way they all startled.
Draco still hadn’t decided what he wanted to do. Maybe something in Potions? Or perhaps teaching? He wasn’t sure he had the patience to teach others, but maybe it could be something learned. There were a lot of options open for him, he just had to really think about it.
“I think you left out the heir of bad taste.” Potter teased, grinning when Draco scowled.
“Just us.” Harry’s eyes drop to Draco’s lips, dark with a flash of desire. It’s always been
Instead he smoothed down the front of his hot pink blazer and fussed with the silver chains and powder-blue neckerchief for the umpteenth time. Turning side-on, Harry took a moment to admire the way the snug trousers hugged his arse, before turning back again and admiring his form: the extra breadth provided by the shoulder pads, and the crisp, sleek lines across his chest to the vee where the jacket fronts met just above his navel. It really was quite dramatic. He picked another piece of fluff off the smooth black t-shirt under the blazer before winking at his reflection and deciding that he really didn't mind this
“Now, I want to talk about your grades.”
“Be good, Harry. I’ll be in touch.”
Draco noticed familiar green eyes and that had him relaxing, at least until he was shoved up against the wall.
“We’ve been up all night, Potter. Obviously, I’m tired.” Draco could sink into the comfort of Harry’s sofa and fall asleep right here, with Harry working his fingers into Draco’s feet as if he’s just cast
“You were right. People do surprise you.”
“Your guess is as good as mine,” Draco said with a laugh and a fond smile. “It wouldn’t surprise me if Lovegood was the wisest one out of all of us.”
“All we know is that Voldemort has the potential to send things to Harry. For all we know it’s a ploy to get you there.”
“You should meet up with him,” Harry suggests, quiet and tentative. “I think he might like to see you. Ron said he’s always talking about you.”
he had seen this character. "Oh
“Very.” Harry’s mind seems to be in the same place, his expression sombre. “I think it’s time.”
Draco knew an order when it was said.
“I thought I did.” Harry leans against the kitchen counter, looking at the table as if he’s imagining the same things Draco is. “I spent a long time thinking maybe I wouldn’t be complete without children of my own.”
It was clear by many of the students’ faces that they weren’t taking it seriously. Some looked to Potter, while others just frowned. Were they reconsidering their belief of his words? Realizing that Potter’s stance coupled with the Sorting hat made more of a promising statement? Or were they wondering if it was separate? Was it a human thing to never notice what was right there? Or just stupidity?
When Moody announced that he would perform the Imperius curse on them, Draco shook his head. That wasn’t happening.
McGonagall looked back up at the wizard, puzzled.
In the dark house, the pregnant lady tried running to the door to reach her husband. Instead, her body fell to the floor as she let out a scream in pain. Every yell echoed across the house, yet no one heard her screams.
It wasn't until she heard the door knob rattle that her hopes went up. A tall, old man walked in and was accompanied by a woman. The wise woman quickly got on her knees and helped give the birth of the baby.
"It's just too much like the day Ginny died," Fred said flatly, and George's eyes filled with tears as Fred finally spoke what they'd all been trying to avoid thinking. "Part of why Bill and Percy didn't want to be here. Too much déjà vu. Not that Harry won't be thinking it anyway." Malfoy nodded, gazing at Harry, and Hermione could almost feel his need to go to him. "Fuck," said Fred, shaking his head, "it's just like that day-" he stopped as the treatment area door opened, and Hermione's heart skipped a beat. It had opened several times in the last half hour, and although it was comforting to note that the relatives and friends the Healers talked to had almost all seemed relieved, and some had left smiling, the tension was getting higher as the crowd thinned around them.
A few seconds pass before Harry pulls the comforter over Draco and leans on his shoulder. Meow jumps off of Harry’s lap and scurries inside the house through the cat-door.
Seeing through the lie, Draco kicks the duvet off of them.
Harry’s eyes widen. “I’m so sorry, Draco, I didn’t mean to wake you-”
“No,” Harry lies.
Harry is woken by the sudden coldness of the bed. He half-opens his eyes, just to see his boyfriend-of-four-years leave the room.
Draco stirs when Harry carefully lays himself next to him, and wraps himself around Draco.
He glances down at his lover, who is still resting on Harry’s chest, like he had been when they first went to bed. The duvet rests on the both of them, and Harry realizes why he had woken up.
Growing concerned, Harry sleepily sits up in the bed, and steps out, the cold wood floors sending shivers throughout his whole body. He lifts the comforter from the bed, and wraps it around himself.
For a few minutes, they stay silent, and they both have their eyes closed, but neither of them fall asleep.
Neither of them even had to say it, they both knew that the other loved them.
Draco comes back.
Anne spluttered, livid fury making her colour rise even higher. "You have no right!" she shrieked at him. "No bloody right!"
The healing circles gathered around Draco and Potter, who lay unconscious in the middle of the room. Lucius took his place in the outer circle, between the bushy-haired Muggle-born and the threadbare werewolf, facing - and about to be partnered with - one of Arthur Weasley's numerous vacant-eyed offspring.
"They're just stupid words, that's all," said Harry, and flicked his wand at the curtains.
"I just - I wasn't looking forward to the hols without any of our friends, but... I have to admit, this isn't bad."
"Ginny would've been proud of him," Draco said.
"No. Funny, the literature actually helped."
Granger hadn't said anything about dirty talk at the dinner table, but what she didn't know wouldn't hurt her.
"Kids? No."
2: Transfigurations (Slytherin/Ravenclaw)
Harry smiled and pushed him onto his back, drawing closer and resting his head on Draco's chest, one arm thrown over him and one leg between Draco's. Draco closed his eyes, inhaling deeply, warm and sated and... content. So strange, that the scent of this room, this bed, should be so soothing. A comforting mix of skin and sweat and honeyed oil and sex. Of two people lounging in bed, skin on skin, for hours, becoming so much a part of one another that it was almost impossible to tell where one ended and the other began.
Harry was still shocked, Draco realized with amusement as his own breathing slowed down. Lying there half-disbelieving that Draco had just done what he'd done. That he'd felt such intense bliss over something so simple.
Harry laughed. "No, I was just wondering. Weddings are usually a big deal in the wizarding world, aren't they? Like in the Muggle world?"
Cornfoot blinked at him for a moment. "Seriously?"
"I believe you."
"I don't know, your flat's really not... it's a bit compact."
"You don't have to," said Ron.
The old guys remember when the water ran clear.

Later. Not right now. Right now was a good time to drink in the relaxed atmosphere, enjoy his Magret de Canard, and appreciate the way that Harry's initial nervousness had melted with the wine and the Braised Veal. Enjoy the way he blushed slightly at Draco's sotto voce suggestions for after-dinner activities, which Draco kept dropping at carefully calculated intervals in their otherwise perfectly socially acceptable conversation.
There was a pause.
"I love that you did this for me," Harry said shyly.
And down
It still wasn't something he wanted to see, so he concentrated on his own worst memory of pain in order to blot it out. Felt the burn of the Mark going onto his skin and heard again his own cries at the agony that had overwhelmed him. Forced himself to relive the experience instead of pushing it away automatically, as he had done every time the memory welled up in the last twenty years. Felt vindictive pleasure as Weasley flinched at that as well.
The poor children crying and fe dee din de,
"Why? It's just sexual attraction. Don't tell me you've never felt that before."
"You won't. You won't, he'll be fine," murmured Malfoy.

"I'm sorry to tell you daughter what your mother never knew.
They were silent for a few minutes, each lost in his thoughts, Harry's hand slowly caressing Draco's chest.
"She was in a hurry."
"S-sorry," Harry stammered, "I, erm-"
Draco paused. "He'll be all right. His hearing, I mean."
He should really see about finding a wizarding electronics store. Arthur or George might know of one. Or perhaps Hermione.
"Maybe not to you."
It had just come out. He'd never thought it, never let himself think about it - it was part of a little box labeled "do not open," because they were just seeing how it went, and seeing where things led them, and seeing where they ended up, and a million euphemisms for Not Serious Yet and yet here he was and he'd said it and it had to be true, and the first time he'd said it - or even thought it - it was in a room for of hostile, suspicious strangers.
"Different this year. You've been in the news."
Harry's pretty sure he knows what Draco thinks and feels about all of the above. But he's never asked, and probably never will. Some things don't get better when you talk about them, some memories are best left unremembered, and some wounds can only be healed by time.
"I was a b-bit pissed at you at first," George admitted. "It p-passed." There was a pause. "So, how's it g-going? Living together?"
Azkaban??
"I said, fancy a shag sometime," Cornfoot said, his very casual voice covering a bit of tension.
The bathroom door opened, and Fred moved towards it. Draco put out his hand. "You know," he said conversationally as Fred turned to look at him, "Your sister's portrait is on our night table. Every morning when I wake up, I see her. I sleep with her widower and I'm raising her son, and I know they both lost her because of the man I chose to follow. Harry loves me, but he'll never stop missing her. My son has a mother, but Alec doesn't, and there's nothing we can do to fill the hole that's left in his life. There were consequences to what we did, I know that. I see them every day. I don't need to be reminded."

Draco's scowl deepened. This was to be about a mutual exchange of favours; it certainly did not need to be complicated with intrusions into his personal thoughts and feelings.
"My son."
"You broke it!" Ben's indignant voice floated down the hallway.
He was a lot like Alec, actually. Gentle, and sweet, and needing so much more protection than Fred could possibly give him. Although at least all Robbie had to be protected from so far was his older sister, and occasionally his parent's fights. Not bloody
"You enjoy that?"
"Never seen one," said Harry, and gave Bill a dark look which Bill returned blandly.
"All right, then," Draco waved her over. "We're going to get out of here and go flying together. And then we're going to bed."
Hold on to the good things, he reminded himself.
This recording is also my choir in performance. It's a bit raggedy, because we had only received the music right before the performance. We sang it as a surprise wedding present for one of our altos, whose favourite song it was and who was getting married that week. The recording doesn't do justice to the real thing, as usual. It was at the end of a concert on a very grey day, with a fairly small audience lost in a very large church. It came out sounding just glorious and our tiny audience was thrilled. As was our alto bride-to-be :)

"Mum?" Michelle's voice was frightened as she spoke from outside the kitchen door.
"You showed more bravery than any of those people thought you could. That's why they changed their minds about you. It has nothing to do with whether or not you were directly responsible for saving anybody's life."
Fred gave him a hard stare, then went into the washroom.
"We'll see," Harry says, starting to get annoyed, and Ron shakes his head at Malfoy.

A few minutes later, Draco had ripped his signet ring off again, and Harry and Draco both remember the flash of wandless magic that shattered the ring and sent white-hot pieces of it flying in every direction. They both remember one of Madam Pomfrey's bedsheets bursting into flame on contact. But Draco doesn't remember that it was both of them who cast the spell. Harry does.

composer's notes on this piece, talking about the many links between Nova Scotia and Brittany, Celtic musical influences, and a side note about how Kerry and Cork, Ireland champion the polka (?). The main point, though, is this: the text is (mostly) by Stephen Hatfield, a Canadian composer, and celebrates the link between Canadian Maritimers and the sea, though it laments the loss of the Maritime way of life. The tunes are all borrowed, from the Irish folk melody "What Will We Do?", two mazurkas from Bretagne, and Greensleeves.
This kid needs a ransom,
Draco laughed again. "What, right now?"
There was a silence. "That didn't go so badly," said Harry tentatively.
Draco cleared his throat. "This is... not the way I'd hoped to ever move in with anybody," he said quietly, and Harry winced in sympathy.
"And why did you no' want them to do that?"
Alec adored this song, with its wistful longing for a return of what had been. Another song of a failed battle, though this one was Scottish, not Irish. Maybe that was why he'd felt at home in Ireland; it was a land that had lost, and lost rather spectacularly, but not been bowed down.
"Thank you, that'll be fine. Harry?"
This was simple, uncomplicated. Not likely to lead to anything. Recreational sex for sheer tension-release.

Sensible didn't mean easy, though. And while Malfoy seemed fine, Harry was devastated. Hermione hurt for him even as she reminded herself that this was for the best.

"What about the interrogation?" asked Flint, and Garritt glanced up at him absently.
"Oh, Flint, strict prisoner transfer protocol," said Garritt, popping his head back into the room, and Flint waved his wand. Cuffs appeared around Draco's wrists, and shackles on his ankles.
"Maybe you're happy stuck in this backwater-"
Draco opened his eyes, meeting Auror One's gaze.
"Go back to sleep," Draco murmured impatiently and stood up, leaned over Alec and touched Harry's shoulder to gently push him back down.
"Fair enough. Now, let's go, before we get Neville in trouble." They hurried towards the edge of the castle grounds.
Michelle blinked, looked around at the grim adult faces surrounding her, pressed her lips together and stomped into the house.
"He won't," Draco said quietly. Harry looked at him questioningly. "He... he said maybe we were better off together. If I'd left you because of - well, because of people like him."
at inappropriate times, he was going to have sex with Draco Malfoy eventually. The only thing he had any control over was when it happened and how, and he was shortly going to lose even that.
Harry chuckled. "You're in no shape to right now. Later?"
Alec trotted over to Ben's daybed and plopped down next to him. "Your daddy's not so worried," he said, reaching over to pat Ben comfortingly and only just missed accidentally hitting him when Harry hastily caught his hand.
Now a prison ship lies waiting in the bay."
"Yeah, I know what you sound like, Finnigan," Malfoy says, still in Seamus' accent, totally deadpan. "Probably as well as your own Mam does. Now go on with you."

Draco and Potter, sleeping in each other's arms, Potter nestled into the curve of Draco's neck, Draco's white hair contrasting with Potter's black, who knew where that image came from. Lucius turned away in distaste at the peace and contentment the image showed.
"Twice," he said, and had to clear his throat. Damn, how long since he'd spoken? "He smiled at me. Asked for Draco."
"Wondering what the fuck I'm still doing with you, as a matter of fact. Missing the Twins' pranks alone sounds heavenly."
We're standing here in our order,
Ron opened his mouth and Harry put up a hand. "Ron. Don't." He took a deep breath. "Maybe we should just not talk about this anymore. There's been enough bad feeling over it to keep us all arguing forever otherwise." And he firmly closed his mouth and started to head indoors.
"Neither were you."

Anne's eyes widened slightly in real pain, and as she opened her mouth for a furious retort Fred brought himself up short.
"To... to
"Very well," she said, and gave Draco a flirtatious look from beneath lowered eyelashes as she cleared their dinner plates and served their desserts. "Will there be anything else? More wine, perhaps?"
He swallowed hard.
Harry nodded again, his breath in gulping gasps.
"No, nor did I," Draco said. "God, what an idiot!"
He felt his heart stop as the room fell into stunned silence again, and a rushing, sick feeling spread through him like a flash flood.
A what? Harry tried to catch his breath, trying to figure out why they'd stopped. He - they weren't in their room, they were in the Gryffindor dorm - wait, was

In some ways this was one of the better Christmas holidays he'd had, Draco thought as he gently bit Harry's earlobe and Harry gave a small moan and they abandoned their latest study session. Yes, sometimes it was a little boring, and lonely, and he missed his family and friends and the Manor. And he supposed Harry missed the Weasel-den too. But not being obliged to go to class - or even leave their room, for that matter - had its advantages. Namely, sex pretty much whenever and however they wanted. It was like so far he was spending the entire holiday in a heady state of sexual bliss.
"With you?"
"No, she's not," Draco said flatly, re-reading the simple message. "She wishes to congratulate us on our first year of marriage."

"You did it right."
"Still blurry. And he... he didn't seem to hear everything I said," Harry said nervously.
She frowned, puzzled. "Why? Ravenclaw would be deadly dull, don't you think? Too much reading, not enough fun. Much rather be here. Though it might've been nice to be in Gryffindor. Best Quidditch team, my mum says."
Malfoy shook his head. "He's with the Healers. He's got spell damage, from the spells that were supposed to be holding up the walls of the stadium. The Healers are optimistic, though." He looked at Harry. "For both of them."
"Oh come on, don't stop now!" the girl next to him muttered, but the professor and the elf appeared to be involved in a deep discussion. The girl blew out her breath and glanced back at Laurence. "Ravenclaw," she said to Ben. "Wonder what his Howler will say tomorrow."

He shook himself mentally. No, that wasn't the right attitude. His life, god help him, included Weasleys now, and he'd best get used to them. It wasn't that hard. Ron and Hermione - they'd even progressed to first names, and not just because calling Ron "Weasley" would be confusing - were at his place about once a week, so far with no casualties, and Harry's parents-in-law were fairly inoffensive. The other Weasleys, he could do without. Bill and George were friendly enough, but he still couldn't look at Bill's scars without a humbling sense of shame. And there were far too many unpleasant memories attached to George Weasley, the very least of which was the beating Draco had endured from him in his fifth year. The glasses and the stammer always made Draco think of his own father's crimes, and they weren't pleasant thoughts.

"Which spell?"
"Spell," Draco said dully. "
"That's good," she said, smiling. "How's his eyesight?"
"What? Oh, that. Yeah, we'll probably finish that later. Just get him booked and locked up for now." He started back out the door. "Don't forget to put an extra guard on him, yeah?"
"That and he'll be out of the hospital in two more days," Draco said, and was pleased to note that his voice didn't betray his wistful anticipation of the date... much. The Trio had been gone for three weeks before coming back from their latest foray, and Draco had been eagerly looking forward to having Harry to himself again. But Weasley had been injured and Harry had insisted that Granger stay at their place until Weasley was better. And it wasn't that Granger was all that tiresome these days, but he was very much looking forward to having her out from underfoot for at least a few days before they all had to take off again.

Fred shook his head angrily even as he admired her fire and spirit. Anne was beautiful when she got like this; like fireworks, but far more dangerous and unpredictable. Not for the first time, he briefly wondered what life would've been like if he'd chosen a wife like George's, someone who could be counted on to bring serenity and reason into difficult situations, instead of Anne, who continually forced him into the role of rational peacemaker. Not exactly his forte.
