Moony rose high within Remus, offering his strength and anger and sheer will, and he pulled away from the temptation.
"…you for giving your speech.   I know we haven’t always been on best terms, but hopefully we can move past that."  Minister Scrimgeour dropped his hand and went to address the gathering people.  Harry stood there dumb, watching after the retreating man.
"Harry," Draco said, and Harry smiled at hearing his name.  "We haven't got much time…" Draco's words were stalled by a finger over his lips.
His cock thrummed against the constriction of his cotton pants and his eyes snapped open to look at the body next to him.
The air about Harry gathered thick like a storm; even the animals had grown silent.  "Excuse me?" Ron asked, certain he'd misinterpreted even worse the second time.
In a flash Snape's sword, glittering sliver in the bright light of the room, came down across one man's raised wand arm, cutting clean through it.  Then he turned to cut down the next and Harry, stunned, marveled at such skill he didn't notice another man to the side aiming his wand at him and Draco.
The shock of it arrested any protestation, not that he would have protested.  The taste of blood was what first jerked Harry back into the present, along with Draco's soft and gentle lips.  A low noise rumbled in the back of Draco's throat, and his arms tightened around Harry.  He kissed back, swiping his tongue along Draco's lips, requesting and receiving entrance.  It was soft and tender and filled him with joy.
!" he continued to cry, to cajole and promise and plead as Draco faded, leaving them alone to the buzzing bees.
For a moment, Draco thinks that Harry will melt into that touch.  There is a softening to that impenetrable line of defense he'd built up, but then he recovers from his moment of weakness and shakes off Terry Boot's hand, turns away, and then he notices Draco.
Harry knew he was no Ron when it came to chess, and honestly, he wasn't a Draco, either.  A fifth year student off the street could probably beat him at chess, so he had to devise another plan to drag this game out as long as magically possible.  Now magic, on the other hand, Harry excelled at.  He quickly set about conjuring a plan to thwart Draco's quick annihilation of him on the board.
Harry didn't know how he felt about that. He once blindly ignored that darkness within him, the urge to punish, the thrill in knowing he was one of the most powerful wizards alive. Then as his Auror career came to a close, he realised it had started to become an issue. It was one of the reasons he hadn't so much regretted leaving. It was a shallow recompense. Standing there in the core with his friends and fallen foe, a soft breeze blew through the room and all he was certain of was that power was addictive and the only thing that had stopped him from completely giving in to it was Draco.
"Damn it, Potter.  Make a little more noise next time," he grumbled and was surprised when Potter said, "Okay, Draco."
Harry gripped Draco's arm and gently tugged the other man towards him, holding him tight as Draco's sorrows drained out.
Draco rolled his eyes and groaned.  He had to ditch this circus and fast.  While he had the utmost respect for Pansy, the rest were all a bunch of badly trained monkeys.  He'd return when the pack of crazies left.
He stared at the blossom.  It was more pink than purple and the blue was so deep it looked black.  There were five petals, a magical number, and in the middle were five stamens with their anthers perched on the ends and the swollen pistil in the centre.
"You probably just derailed that man's date, you know?"  The sun has begun painting the sea; the mosquitoes arrive for their evening meal.  Draco slaps at his arm.
"You can't test it on my sidekick!"  Draco would protect what was his.  He sent a beseeching look to Granger, who was busy arguing quietly with her left hand again.
A light rain still sprinkled over their valley, leaving concentric circles blooming over the surface of the lake.  The tall grass had been stomped flat by the storm.  He took a few steps away from the cabin and surveyed the roof.  There were thin patches in the thatch that would need to be repaired.  He thought of Snape's wand and shook his head.  He wished he'd had his wand to make short work of the patching, but he'd lost it to the Death Eaters a lifetime ago.
A smile flashed across Draco's face, relieving some of the pointiness to his features.  Something in those eyes boiled with anticipation, and Harry's heart lurched.  Those grey eyes opened a fraction wider and then he leaned down and kissed Harry.
"Go back to sleep," Draco said and cast a cleaning charm over them before wrapping his arms around Harry's shoulders and pulling him against his chest.  "We've got a long day tomorrow."
"That woman I met here last night—dark hair, green eyes, couldn't miss her—how often does she come in?"
"Thank you for such a deep and thoughtful compliment.  Come with me; I shall show you where you will be staying."
"Good morning!" Harry greeted, laying out the plate of sausages and toast next to a jar of strawberry preserves.
Draco scanned the crowd teeming around the table stuffed in the back of Garish's, a local tapas bar that this motley group had been frequenting for the past few years.  Piled high with drinks and food, the table practically creaked as the people leaned on it, reaching and grabbing for the dishes, reminding Draco of bees swarming over an exceptionally tasty magnolia bush.  Plates of pan fesco and
"Yes, don't you remember, Harry?  The grant she got to study them for Hogwarts?"  A moment of silence passed between the two.  "Harry, are you even listening to me?"  She jabbed him in the ribs with her elbow.  He
Draco wished he could say something like "It started with a kiss," that it began with roses and Draco portraying the dashing and gorgeous Prince of the story, but unfortunately it actually started with a collision and Harry coming to
He watched as Draco climbed out of the giant tub and very much liked what he saw.  Draco dried his body off, all lean and edgy.  Whatever he'd been doing for the last year had certainly been good for his physique.  When Draco finished drying, he got dressed and then it was only Harry who was naked, well furred, but still naked, and so he quickly tugged on his shorts.
He was trying to distract himself.  October 31st was fast approaching.  They would cast their spell and see Draco for one day, assuming he had remained at the cabin and saw the magical circle.  They would tell Draco that they were lovers and gauge his reaction; Severus thought it would be positive.  Harry hoped it would be.
“Hey there,” Harry greeted as he closed the door behind them. Draco didn’t answer, instead shooting him a glare but still allowing himself to be pulled in by waist, flush against Harry’s front where the other boy’s half chub was evident. Draco felt blood rush to his dick as he felt the outline of Harry’s cock against his hip.
deep within them. Draco pulled back from the kiss to gasp words, interrupted by Harry pressing him back against his lips over and over. “Clothes,”
He huffed. Harry was very much into getting Draco to beg for his cock, would make him say the most demeaning things before he fucked him. But Draco was so needy for that thick bulge to be inside him he honestly didn’t care anymore.
“Really? Because your dick seems to like me just fine,” He pulled on the slytherin’s hips until he was grinding against Harry’s own hard on. Letting out a groan, he looked back up into Draco’s eyes. “Come on, pretty boy, let me finish what you started. Promise I’ll make you feel good,” The almost sweet words contradicted Harry’s hungry tone.
“Yes, just... can you finger me?” His voice came out much more unsteady than he had anticipated but Draco’s request made Harry groan lowly, the hand squeezing his left cheek and pulling it aside before retreating up to Harry’s own mouth. He started to suck on his fingers, coating them in saliva and confirming Draco’s suspicion that if Harry had never fingered another guy before he had at least had experience with himself. After Harry deemed his fingers wet enough, the steady pace of his fist on Draco’s cock never stuttering, he positioned them in between Draco’s cheeks and decidedly rubbed circles into the blonde’s rim.
“That’s between me and Malfoy,” Harry laughed dismissively in his way that infuriated Draco to the extreme because it always allowed him to get away with things. Smug bastard. As expected, people seemed to accept this explanation except Ron who gave Harry a nudge to the side. “I’ll tell you later” Draco caught him mouthing and he could feel his face going red because if Harry actually told Ron the types if things going on between them he wouldn’t be able to look the ginger in his freckled face ever again.
“Ohhh, I think I know what this is about...” Harry lowered his hands, an almost mocking smirk breaking onto his lips. “Don’t worry, you have a very nice looking dick, Malfoy,” He cooed, teasing, leaning forward on the divider to get a better look at the other’s expression.
Draco came with a strangled moan of Harry’s name, gripping Harry in a vice-like hold as he shot ribbons of white that made a mess of both their stomachs. The way Draco’s hole clenched down, as if milking Harry’s cock, had him following suit a few seconds later, pumping out his release and making Draco’s dick twitch pathetically in its sensitive, post-orgasm state. Harry bit down on the blonde’s collar bone as he rode out his orgasm, gripping Draco’s hips hard enough to bruise and keeping himself balls deep inside. It wasnt until Harry had let go of his hips, both of them panting as they relaxed onto the bed that Draco spoke.
,” Harry let his head drop back against the divider he was leaning on, eyes closed in ecstasy. Draco’s sinfully good mouth was a wet, warm heaven around his dick, sliding back and forth over sensitive skin. Draco smiled inwardly as a gasp was forced out of Harry when he pulled back the foreskin and swirled his tongue around the head. The pleasure became more intense as he worked more of the length into his mouth until Harry’s cock was brushing up against the back of Draco’s throat. He gagged as he tried to take it down further, once, twice until he retreated to come up for air.
“You saw mine, I get to see yours, it’s only fair,” He stated, moving towards Harry in quick stomps. “Just let me see it and we’ll be even and we can leave this room never having to think about it again,” That was a lie. Draco knew he would never be able to forget the image of Harry’s cock and that it would only serve to make his little
you are, Malfoy?” The demeaning tone was accompanied by Harry’s hand closing fully around Draco’s length, beginning a controlled pace up and down. He didn’t vocally answer the question put the way Draco hiked a long leg up to wrap around Harry’s waste, pulling him in closer, told him all he needed to know.
Harry hissed at the new intensity, hips twitching up into the moist heat. It was Draco swallowing greedily around his cock, feeling the constriction of his beautifully sinful throat, that pushed Harry over the edge with a hurried “Cu- I’m cumming!”. He whined and let his head drop back against the divider in ecstasy as Draco diligently gulped down his release, eyes closes blissfully.
“I’ve been looking forward to this all week,” Harry said in a low tone, a hand coming up to play with the hair on the back of Draco’s head. Draco placed a hand on the Gryffindor’s chest, giving a slight push to allow himself to walk Harry backwards towards the bed.
"We'll just grab the thing…" kiss to the forehead, right over Harry's crossed scars "…and disarm it… somehow…" kiss over the right eye "…and then we'll find Remus, should be easy enough…" kiss over the left eye "…and then hook up with Ron…" kiss on the nose "…and find our missing Aurors and get the hell out." Long, slow kiss on the lips, which Harry eagerly returned, gripping Draco as firmly as he held Harry in his own arms.
Luna remembers those last moments before everything flipped arse up and Lord Voldemort took over.  She and Pansy worked together for
"Nobody did."  Kingsley leaned back in his chair, steepling his fingers in front of his face, staring deeply at Harry.  "Harry, Dumbledore was the only one who knew and understood Snape.  To this day, I have no idea what it was that connected those two.  Why the Headmaster trusted Snape so thoroughly.  Why he let Snape kill him.  But he got us valuable information—if he’d ever been outed as a spy, we wouldn’t have won as cleanly as we did, if at all.  He was too important.  Perhaps he was even more crucial than you."
"How in Merlin's name…?"  Neville asked in awe, patting Harry's shoulders, holding him out at arm's length to get a look at him.  "I thought…"  He looked beyond Harry to his wife and Luna smirked as she continued to scan the menu.  "Where have you been?"
But he reached and reached, and Draco looked over at him trapped in a pertification curse, unable to reach back, only able to scream his goodbye with his eyes as Harry slowly slipped from existence.
The potency of the moment is cemented by the desperation painted there with sweat and spit, and then Draco sinks into Harry, his nerve endings sparking with life and passion and
Draco lets his gaze wash over the congregation of reporters.  He called the press conference because he felt it was time that someone stand up and say something.  Harry Potter's violent actions.  The Ministry's reactionary tactics.  None of it good for the betterment of the British wizarding people.  Peace and prosperity, that's all Draco wants.
"Harry.  You know I don't really like… talking about it.  You of all people must understand that I don't want to be seen as anything different than anyone else."
He ran up to his room and grabbed an Extendable Ear, adding a boost of his own magical strength to it.  His shoulder ached in response.  Then he sent the ear down the stairs to the laboratory door for his own reconnaissance, so sensitive it even picked up some mice below the floorboards.  He just hoped he didn't earn an earful of something he most certainly
"I think," he stopped and roamed his eyes around to everyone at the table, even Hermione's left hand, and as the room quieted down, he finished with, "it was a bomb."
notice.  You just shagged me to get me to drop the charges.  Admit it, felon," Draco said, surreptitiously rubbing his cock against the deliciously soft material.
Snape entered from the outside, brushing off a dusting of snow as he stomped his shoes on the woven mat.  He scrutinized the two boys sitting inches away from the fire on the worn, wool rug.  Greyback's wand slowly dimmed until it went dark, leaving the fire as their only light source.
"You're late!"  Hermione pointed out, already three sheets and a duvet to the wind.  She threw her arms around Harry and Draco, squeezing them with more might than her modest frame would suggest possible.  Draco looked to the others for help, but they ignored Harry and him for the more interesting subject of food and drink.
Harry finally seemed to have shaken himself fully awake; his features sharpening from the slack-jawed-yokel look to that of astute Auror once again. "You're right. We can't leave yet, but we
Draco inhaled, nodded, and give his friend an apologetic frown.  "It’s important, Greg.  We didn’t want to follow one Dark Lord to his end; I certainly don’t want to follow another.  We need more information.  Perhaps it is nothing, but I just don’t think it is.  Too much activity.”
Riley stood and slammed his hand to his desk, suddenly exploding in anger.  "That's uncalled for Potter, and you know it."
The huge wizard looked down at Harry, eyes narrowing as they saw the man who could crack walls with a slip of his temper.  "Mr. Potter," he said in his deep voice, adding a slight nod.
Remus looked up just as the most unexpected visitor entered room 421.  The blond aristocrat strutted in, and Remus wondered just how long he had stood outside the hospital room before he found the balls to enter.  The scent of nervous apprehension seeped off the young man, causing the wolf within to rise in feral delight.
Harry looked at Peeves, and Peeves pouted even harder, his pale face scrunched up like an annoyed toddler.  Did Peeves somehow tell Snape what Harry was about to do?  That couldn't be, because Peeves would have been proud of Harry's little prank.
Millicent barks some indignant noise at Draco.  "Draco, do you think I'd side with those who are killing all the magical people?  Come on, you dumbshit."  Her voice is mocking.  "I'm fighting the Ministry that
"Yes," he said with a thankful smile. Harry only nodded and they walked down the street. Draco wasn't sure of the last time he offered so much thanks in such a short span of time.
,” I say. I half-cringe because I know it came out as a whimpering beg, but all I need at this moment is to get him
After the feast, all the Eights (a surprisingly well-meshed group at this late time in the year) gradually found their way up to the Room. The party itself was lovely, if I’m perfectly honest. The drinks were warm and comforting or crisp and sweet, both favourites of mine, and seeing my drunk classmates play cliche games was entertainment of the best sort. They’d decided to play spin-the-bottle. I watched mindlessly as the bottle spun, bodies crossed to the middle for the kiss (some chaste and sweet, some more feisty which only ramped up when the rest of the group urged the pairs on with heckling and praise).
“Harry. Please, I… I’m-” he begins, his worried silver eyes burning into me, and swallows hard before continuing: “sorry. I’m sorry. I didn’t mean it, you know I didn’t.”
“Draco,” I say for the third time in the last five minutes, bringing his hand to my mouth and pressing a few gentle kisses to his fair-toned, soft-skinned knuckles. “Of course I’ll stay. And, obviously, I love you too, you daft prat.”
I roll my eyes as I wiggle out of the crimson Auror robes. I drape them over the sofa. Draco eyes the move with judgmental eyes but chooses not to comment. “Can we just get going, please?” I plead.
me by my neck and waist and pulled me to him in a quick, strong movement that made me gasp. His grip was strong but he was impossibly gentle as he leaned in and just barely brushed his lips against mine, a quick tease before pressing more firmly. He slipped his warm, velvety soft tongue against my bottom lip and I gasped again. He took the advantage, in this game we always seem to play (though in decidedly different circumstances this time), and stuck his tongue
I gave the parchment to Sela with a light caress of her neck and she took off through my open window. I took another swig. She returned in less than a minute.
“I s’pose we’ve kind of arsed up the order, yeah?” He chuckles, actually chuckles, while his continued patient strokes further take me apart. “But… y’know… would you? Like, at a Hogsmeade weekend? We could get a pint, or if you wanted somewhere else-” I cut him off easily by pressing my lips to his, moaning loudly into his mouth before pulling away.
I knew everyone was watching me before I looked. The bottle was pointing towards me. I hadn’t even paid attention to who had spun it. I looked around in alarm, trying to deduce who it was, when Potter crept towards the center of the circle, those jungle-green eyes blazing intensely into mine. I recall a sudden feeling of immense heat building in my chest and settling in my groin as I instinctually mirrored his actions, even though my mind was in a blank panic.
“Don’t go. Please. I just…” he trails off. Somewhat bitterly, I find myself impressed. Draco’s not exactly best at apologies, admitting feelings, or really being vulnerable in any way at all. “You know I just care about you.” He finishes quietly, looking finally into my eyes.
He pulls out slowly, dragging every vein of his cock against every soft, sweet, secret spot of my inner walls. My nerves
“Draco,” I say. My voice comes out low and warning, something that typically intimidates others but somehow never fails to rile Draco Malfoy right up.
“Funny way of showing it,” I say. He’s still standing resolutely in front of the Floo. I cross my arms, irritably breaking eye contact to stare at the floor. “Draco…” I sigh wearily. “Look... I’ll just come by tomorrow.” I try to reach past him for some powder.
“Draco…” he tries again, but it breaks off into a groan as I roll my hips more insistently up into his. “What… what do you want to do?” he asks again. Really sticks with the point, this one.
from my mouth. Good thing for that Silencing Charm. He picks up a brutal rhythm, pounding into me relentlessly. “God, Malfoy, I’ve wanted you for so long,” he grunts out, pausing his speech to moan. “You’re so perfect. Look at you, taking it so beautifully, so well,” he purrs, and my chest fills with warmth at his words. “I think I’ve always wanted you,” he continues, somehow able to still put together sentences while I lie down here with my entire world pounding apart, one thrust at a time. “It’s only ever been
I stand from my desk with a heavy sigh. Stretching my stiff limbs, I wince when I see the time: I’m already an hour late for meeting Draco at his flat. I can already hear him complaining. Loudly and dramatically. My head pounds in response and I wince again.
from my lips. I try to glare at him when he somehow smirks around my prick, but then he starts whirling his tongue around the tip, poking the tip of his tongue into the slit, before taking me further. He hollows his cheeks and sucks, and
Our foreheads rest against one another while we catch our breaths and come down from the high. Harry gains the ability to remember to pull out of me and, while I’m whimpering at the loss of that wonderfully full feeling, rolls over me onto his side, facing me, eyeing me with a look so sappy I blush and have to look away. I tangle my legs into his.
And riled, he is. “You know, as I’ve been sitting here just waiting around, I’ve been thinking.” Here comes the drama.
We stand there for another moment or two, just holding each other and smiling stupidly, until Draco finally pulls away. “You’ve still got to feed me. And for fuck’s sake, do please at some point learn the proper use of a
I sat at my desk, and wrote a letter to Potter, who I’d noticed left the party shortly before me. With a grand swig of that dastardly lovely Ogden’s, I took my favourite Eagle Owl quill and began:
"You're disgusting," she said, but as she started to work up and down his dick with her breasts, how much did that judgment really mean? She was completely powerless against the pressures of his worst attentions, her body guided up and down his shaft in obedient gestures making all too clear what her body was ready to do, given the chance. Her eyes drifted toward his lap, and for all the disgust she was supposed to be bound by, all she could do was stare at Harry's impressive cock, almost drooling in the face of such ravenous temptation and passion. She'd never felt anything like this, and certainly never felt any attraction toward Harry, but there she was, falling desperately, dizzily deeper into the fascination and panic of letting this push her limits, and she could do nothing about it.
"Why won't you call me by my name?" Darcy asked, even while handing the vial of troll dust over to her. "I didn't choose this, Pansy. I know you don't want to be with a girl, but we can still be friends, can't we?" This was mortifying to Darcy, an isolating experience leaving her perpetually unsure what was happening or how she was supposed to deal with this, let alone come back from the insane pressures upon her. "Please, talk to me."
"Holy shit," Harry groaned, not having seen that coming but finding himself all the more eager to lean into this pleasure as she worked for his attention. "You're getting into it. That feels so good." He grabbed her head and pushed the blonde down a bit more. "Can you taste yourself on me?" He couldn't resist gloating, but with Darcy looking up so meekly at him and clearly opening herself up to the sweeping pressure and panic of these ecstasies, could Harry really be blamed for that? He beheld the sweet, hopeless wreck of a girl compeltely lost to her own desires, fumbling deeper into the obedient reverence of magical submission.
There was no reason Draco's eyes should have drifted to his cock, to the way it so aggressively strained against his jeans. It intimidated her, but she didn't feel like she had the strength to do anything about it, suddenly robbed of the strength she needed and the power she should have had. "Potter?" she asked, voice not meant to sound as meek as it did.
It was the first time someone had actually called her that in hours, and that alone made her break down. Her jaw trembled as she stood before Harry, a hopeless wreck completely powerless now. "Potter," she replied, before hitting her knees, sobbing openly and loudly.
Harry didn't know what the hell this was, but he didn't have a choice here. "Are you going to just talk?" he asked, dismissive and bitter as he stared Draco down from his spot. "You're the one who wanted this duel, now you're stalling."
"I'm not enjoying this," Darcy hissed, trying to save face and avoid deepening her acceptance of these weird pressures, squirming in place and seeking to do something, anything, to help herself. The more she got fixated on Harry's cock, the more concerned she became about what was happening to her, and with each forward, it felt stranger and messier, pulling her into a bizarre state of confusion and heat, worried and fraying at the seams. She was giving up to this all with such intensity, a haste sweeping through her body that felt like it was demanding more and more from her by the second, and all Darcy could do was let it take her.
Darcy trembled in the bed, shaking under the sounds of her father's voice slamming against the walls of the room and bouncing back onto her. Nobody liked receiving howlers in the Great Hall in front of their families, but even for as much as the room echoed, there was so much other sound and so many other people that it what echo there was promised a cavernous effect. Inside the dorm room, it sounded different. Her father's voice sounded more intimately furious, the blistering anger of a father scolding their child in their own bedroom, making it feel all too real, too miserable. Tears began to run down her face, but the letter continued.
This was pure insanity. Harry had left Darcy to collect herself over a few nights, not in any hurry to gloat about it for a while, but now, before his eyes, Darcy was breaking down, and that was the one thing Harry was prepared for the least. Even the gender transformation and railing Darcy every which way was easier to swallow than the sight of the blonde crying on her knees, having screamed at a painting for him and now completely lost to her own emotions. Far be it from Harry to want to feel any sort of sympathy for Malfoy, but what was he supposed to do in a situation like this? He felt a weird sense of emotional panic, unable to deny that there was something to the sight of her sobbing that made him put aside every petty ugliness in their past to step forward and ask the one thing it seemed Darcy really needed someone to ask.
Two contrasting reactions hit Darcy without her active thought. One was starting to give up to him faster, working her tits along his cock with hastier gestures in the hopes of avoiding this trouble. The other was a clench of her thighs down together, making her shudder under the panicked guilt of knowing that the mere mention and idea of being dominated like this inspired deep, lustful aches inside of her. It didn't do her dignity any favours, didn't help Darcy feel any better about the shameful throb and pulse of what hit her. She was powerless here, wishing she understood how to contain herself while staring down at his aching cock. It glistened with her juices, and the mere sight of it left her dizzy.
Smacks across her round ass and sharp pulls on her hair brought on sweeps of a dizzy panic that Darcy felty hopeless against, thrown into a state of delirium and chaos that held her tightly. Uncontrollable lust burned hotter through her body, and every ache of these senseless passion felt stranger, fiercer, making this turn into something so bizarre and ferocious that she didn't understand how to handle any of it. But her body did. Her hips slammed back without control or sense, meeting Harry's hard strokes and surrendering deeper and hotter to passions she couldn't deal with. This was too much, and she found herself aflame with panics too steep to contain, growing needier and hungrier, want throbbing through her body with brutal fever growing more bizarre and chaotic with each shove forward.
"Crabbe and Goyle totally want to fuck Potter's Used Goods," Pansy said. "Pretty sad, too. I bet it's because those two can't get any better girls, so they don't care if they have to pound gutter trash."
The indignant noises that Draco made didn't actually mean much when she started to undo her suddenly tighter pants. They didn't fit her well anymore, with longer legs, soft thighs, and round hips suddenly stuffing pants that once fit much better. Reluctantly, she shed her jeans and the underwear beneath, exposing to Harry and to herself for the first time her bare, glistening pussy, with a pair of plump lips awaiting attention and begging to be spread out. "Pervert," she hissed. "The second I get a vagina, you think you own me? What kind of a 'hero' are you supposed to be?" She was furious, but it was all empty. She would have odne the same to Harry given the chance, after all.
This wasn't just her body rebelling, but a deep desire inside of her, one that she struggled harder with by the second, demanding that she succumb to the ravenous and reckless sweeps of a pleasure she was powerless to fight. This felt too good, and Darcy trembled her way through shoving her round ass back against Harry's lap in hopeless offering, giving up deeper to pleasures and desires more reckless than she could possibly deal with, and the ugly truth was, she didn't want to deal with them. She wanted to be consumed by them, and everything in the way of that simply had to go. This was an amazing pulse of relentless joy, a chaos coming on stronger and messier, demanding a pulse of pleasure she just couldn't handle any longer.
Even worse than that, his load sealed the curse. Her womb was full of the cum of her new master, guaranteeing that she was eternally a girl and eternally his. Darcy didn't realize how deep this all ran, how much the strange madness upon her was her complete undoing. she just lay there breathless, her tits being toyed with more and more by Harry's hands, and she felt there was simply nothing to do but accept it.
Darcy was waiting for something else, too. When her door opened again, she was hopeful, wide-eyed, expecting. "Is it here?"
Hogwarts kept a stock of second-hand uniforms for poor students, or students whose clothes were damaged by some sort of magical mishap. Darcy focused on the poor part as the uniform of some equally buxom Slytherin from ten years ago's uniform became her own. It wasn't something she was proud of in the least, but pride wasn't something Darcy got to deal with anymore. She couldn't deal with Crabbe or Goyle anymore. Not even Blaise. All three of them were the absolute worst to her now, being sexist pigs non-stop.
There was no good way to deal with this reality. Draco felt the tense, clenching panic and worry of sweeping despair hit her, leaving her unsure how to contain her panics. Harry's cock continued plundering away at her mouth, making her drool down onto her newly grown tits and struggling to fathom how any of this was supposed to work. She felt lost here, and the only direction that she felt like she had was to throw herself right into Harry's arms. It wasn’t what she wanted in the least. But there she was, growing desperate and panicked. The wetness between her legs didn't even really make sense to her; this newly grown pussy was something she had no frame of reference for how to experience, but she didn't have anything resembling a choice here. The growing chaos hit her head-on, and she was powerless against it.
The spell they wanted Draco to use was an old and depraved one. The loser was turned by force into a girl to be taken as a prize by the victor, with the victor feeling an intense compulsion to make the loser their bitch. A single load of cum filling the newly grown womb would make the situation permanent, and the intense compulsion to dominate would grow easier but still always be there as a hard greed for domination. Draco hadn't known any of this in its specifics, and she was about to learn the hard way.
"I'm not a lezzie," was all she said, bitter and furious. TO Pansy, Draco turning into Darcy reflected badly on her even in hindsight. She wanted nothing to do with Darcy, who was simply a hanger-on to her group of girls now. They were once king and queen of Slytherin, and her position as such was one informed fully by the fact she was Draco's girlfriend, a, otherwise completely unspectacular girl with few redeeming qualities thrust into a position of power. She now used that power against the one who got her there. "Daphne, why don't you tell the tramp what the problem is?"
"Nobody respects me now," Darcy muttered, isolated in her dorm room, wrapped in blankets to help cover up her new body, scowling her way through eating the plate of breakfast someone had brought her down. She hadn't shown her face for days, buried deep in horrible embarrassment and the pointed certainty that more problems would arise from it. As few people knew about her duel failures as she could get away with, for fear of mockery and exposure. But hiding down here wasn't only a means of preserving her dignity; Darcy knew that leaving the Slytherin dorms would get her back in the line of fire for whatever depravity Harry wanted from her.
Draco didn't want this duel. The thought made him wince. He was compelled to do it. By his father, by the other Death Eaters, by the desire to do something to prove he was worthy and that he and he alone could remove Harry Potter as a threat. Success here would silence everybody and solidify himself as a success story, as someone who Voldemort would want in his service. "You don't want me to stop talking, because once this duel begins, you will be a slave to the Malfoy family." Draco didn't understand this ritual much himself. The stakes and the circumstances behind this obscure ceremony left him completely unsure of what would even happen. From what he'd been told, the loser would become instantly bound under the heel of the winner, subjugated and beholden to every command. There was a cold cell waiting for Harry, and he'd step into it and never see the light of day again.
From this position, with his hips crashing against her ass, Harry held even more power and leverage over Darcy, and he took firm advantage of all of it, pounding away at her snug hole without a shred of restraint, relishing in the satisfaction and greed he found in using her so harshly. Darcy had to take the fullest brunt of Harry's lusts, making it impossible to resist what she felt pushing her, growing more panicked and more ferocious by the second. It was amazing, searing its way through her body and sending her plunging into a state of warming, wanton joy, a delirium so sweeping and demanding in its nature that it didn't seem real to her.
Once every drop was spent in her mouth, Harry drew his hips back, cock smacking across her cheek, and his smile seemed unbreakable, bearing down with fiery intent upon Draco. "How'd my cock taste?"
"You're a brute," Darcy spat. "A Pig. You took advantage of mem treated my body like it was your property."
Darcy was red in the face, screaming at the painting of the Fat Lady while demanding entry into Gryffindor Tower. Her body trembled with rage and with panic. She wanted to cry, but all of her sorrow manifested as blistering anger. That was all Darcy was really ever equipped to feel. She was furious with this, but she didn't care. She stomped around, slamming against the wall, threatening the painting and looking like an absolute embarrassment in trying to do so, having no diea what else she could do in the face of this all. Things had been humiliating enough for her already, but she wasn't getting better, and this obstacle now to her even beign able to rest was infuriating.
Harry had no intention of engaging in any real duel with Draco. He moved to catch him off guard with a single spell, sidestepping a sudden shot of magic from Draco and casting his disarming charm. It was the 'safe' method. The easy method. Draco didn't see it coming, so locked into his violent mindset that he never considered defense, let alone defense against a non-attack. Not until his wand left his hand and was soaring across the room. Draco couldn't do a damn thing about it, watching the wand go and yelling out in panic. The duel was over in mere seconds, and embarrassment would surely follow.
Gagging on Harry's cock was the last thing Draco wanted to do right now, but the tight grip pulled her down, made her throat his shaft and struggle harder under the deluge of chaos and wicked heat that drove her mad. She felt completely unable to hold herself together, hands fumbling against his lap, attempting to shove him back but being met with absolute resistance and a chaos growing more fitful by the second. She felt weak though, unable to muster up any real opposition to pressures growing wilder out of control. Her mouth remained obediently wrapped around his cock, no strength to be found in trying to hold back, while the one person who she hated most fucked her mouth as a victory lap. This was madness, and she was stuck trying to cope with all of it, siding deeper into disarray and panic with each overbearing stroke forward.
"But it did," Harry said. "You can accept that, or you can keep fighting, but either way..." Harry drew away from her, pulling out of her pussy and watching ash is load began to ooze out of her well fucked hole. "You're going to sit up and give me a titfuck." Shamelessly loving every second of the control he held over this situation, Harry craved more attention and more sinful indulgence in Darcy's body. She was beholden to his every word, left with no choice but to perform and submit, and the power that gave him over her was tremendous. Shuffling up to her feet, all Darcy could do was grab hold of her breasts and wrap them around Harry's cock, offering herself up fully to the pressures and the madness of something that felt utterly inevitable, that made her body shudder through the hopeless hunger and heat of this moment.
"S-stop calling me that," she whined, twisting on the floor like a petulant child, all while her oversized tits, which were definitely those of a child, continued to be kneaded in his strong hands. The weakness and the bizarre sense of complete panic that held heavy over her kept Darcy from knowing what to make of this, her body simply too hopeless now to do a damn thing about it. "This wasn't supposed to go like this."
With the protection of the Malfoy family no longer protecting Darcy--and the whole of the house could hear from outside the room--everything was about to change for Darcy. She was a joke before. Now? Nobody even had to pretend to still respect her. That night, Crabbe and Goyle sat in their beds and masturbated, cocks out, trying to get Darcy to look at their dicks, not quite forcing themselves onto her but leaving a clear path to do so when they got bored. And maybe that wasn't even going to be the worst of these insanities.
"You make such a pretty girl," Harry teased. "And those tits are huge. Guess you'll need a new uniform for all that." Pounding harder and rougher forward, harry worked toward his selfish pleasure with an almost deranged sense of need, growing more fitful and desperate with each passing moment. He needed this. he very specifically, utterly needed this pleasure, and nothing else made a whole lot of sense to him. He worked to dominate Draco, to reap the benefits of his twisted victory, making her gag along on his cock and struggle through the most senseless of surrenders, a passion burning up brighter and fiercer with each second ticking away.
Darcy was sure Harry was done now. She needed him to be, feeling the dizzy ache and the delirium of having been completely overwhelmed, taken to the limit by Harry and his absolute worst efforts. "Okay," she said, drawing away, wiping some cum off of her face. "That was--never speak of this again, Potter, or I will make sure your life is destroyed."
"For now," Harry said. "Fucking you four times was enough. You can go run back to your dorm room and explain to everyone that you lost so hard you turned into a girl."
Harry's reply was a sharp and incisive, "It is." The absolute worst of the spell's influence was gone, but he remained harsh, staring down at her with the full certainty he owned her, and the desire to keep dominating her. "This was your spell, Darcy."
Where once the snide and vain boy lay, now lay a girl whose platinum blonde hair suddenly ran long, reaching down past her shoulders. Her face took on sharper features, softer and fuller lips looking perfect for pursing while sending catty comments about classmates sailing across the room. But those weren't the things Harry noticed first. What he noticed first were the outrageously plump tits that had torn Draco's button-down shirt wide open, forcing to apart and leaving them shamelessly exposed. There was no way Harry could have paid notice to anything else in the sudden surprise of the moment, his eyes tightening their focus on her chest.
Draco snarled, but she stared up at him with a hopeless, vulnerable panic, wishing she was stronger and harsher while being pounded into complete submission and doing nothing to save herself. Her virgin pussy was slammed into and claimed fully, the pleasure hitting her with ferocious passion and a throbbing, bucking need and hunger that hit her stronger and messier. She didn't know how to handle any of it, burning deeper into the chaos and the heat she needed most. This all burned hotly, pulsating and throbbing harder through her body, imposing its absolute worst demands on her.
The squirming, bitter refusal on Darcy's part to conceded how badly she wanted it felt less and less convincing by the second. She was caught in the bizarre spiral of panic and worry, wondering how to stand up for herself while inching ever closer to conceding to Harry that she liked it. The taste of her pussy was indeed all over his cock, but somehow the tart flavour didn't bother her. As a boy, eating pussy had been awful and Draco had gone to every length possible not to eat Pansy out. But here, slathered around Harry's cock, it tasted oddly enticing, hitting her in a way that still didn't make a lot of sense, but in the place of sense came something more satisfying and ravenous, a passion growing fiercer with each shove forward, demanding so much and leaving no sense of control to spare these growing panics. It just kept building.
Tightening his grip in her hair, Harry plunged forward with a joy that hit him hard. "I think I like you better this way," he teased, hips pumping more eagerly forward, opening Draco up to the panic and the chaos of sudden surrender. Deep strokes forward left no time for her to deal with all these spikes of sensation and heat, pulses of worry and panic all wearing quickly at her thoughts. Her mouth was stuck serving him, the tension and clenched-up heat of suddenly giving in to this leaving her baffled and terrified, wondering what to make of how harshly these thrusts into her mouth were wearing at her now. She wanted to pull back from this, trying to lean away from Harry while feeling the harsh pulls only drag her in tighter, forcing her to confront the weird passion and confusion of a pleasure that ripped with guilty fever through her body.
So she sat and she stewed, seeing the dirty looks she got, brought the work she missed in class while insisting she'd come down with 'sickness'. Madame Pomfrey had been down to examine her and agreed that until there was a solution found, missing class was ideal, but Darcy knew there wasn't any good way out of this. She’d read up on the ritual--there wasn't a damn thing else to do--and discoverer that once the loser was cummed inside of, the spell was permanent, with no known wizard ever managing to break it once a couple had mated to completion. She was bound to Harry now, and would be for the rest of her life, by all accounts.
Harry fell to his knees in front of Darcy, he put his arms around her, and he buried her face into his neck. And Darcy wanted so badly to push him away, slap him, and tell him she didn't want his pity, that she wanted him to put her through every grueling humiliation she deserved. But instead, she put her arms around him, she cried, and she accepted the warmth of the only person in this world who seemed willing to treat her like she was one too.
"I guess the spell only makes you submit, but it doesn't get rid of your attitude. You lost, Malfoy. Do you want to take something with grace for the first time in your life, or should I fuck it out of you?" The spell kept nudging him toward harshness in turn, but it felt rewarding, every vulgar response to Darcy making his cock ache harder, making his head spin with throbbing excitement and a focused delirium. Mounting pressures and demands grew fiercer by the second. "Or maybe I should grab your tits and fuck them myself."
"You wanted this duel, you lost. Now it's time to pay up." Harry didn't care about any of that, his aching cock pressing against her face, throbbing with excitement while lusts more primal than Harry had ever felt before took hold of him. He was vicious and forward and ready to be a brutal mess, a monster. The burning pressures upon him forced him into a state of greed and heat too relentless to control, and he didn't try to fight it. Harry felt those burning passions pulling him in deep. Relentless fascination held onto him tightly, and without a shred of sense in his head, Harry guided his cock toward Draco's lips and forced it into her mouth.
Harry knew it was paper-thin, but he didn't bother with it, heaving down upon her and grabbing hold of her soft thighs. They came apart readily. "You're all talk," he said, forcing himself between her legs and slamming down so abruptly into her that Draco didn't have even a second to deal with the sharp, harsh aggression behind his brutal thrusts. He pinned her to the floor, hands immediately going for her oversized chest. "But these are nice. I never thought about what you'd look like as a girl, but I would have guessed you would look like your mom. Uptight, twiggy. No tits, no ass. But here you are, having so much to hold onto. Maybe the spell is meant to turn you into the perfect fucktoy."
But there was no choice. "Your cock isn't even that impressive, you're just a smug jock," Draco hissed, all while her hands squeezed at his body and she fell ever deeper into the confused surrender that she loathed so much. Harry's thrusts were merciless, plunging Draco deeper into this confused sense of pure panic. He filled her so much, pushed her body to surrender to the twisting passions and the greeds of something she felt totally powerless against now, but the pleasure burning up through her was something she felt bound to give up to, simply not strong enough to handle the burning thrills of surrendering. The sensation of beign fucked so deep and so hard rattled Draco, left her baffled by the frustration and the pressures of being used so hard, and all she could do was suffer through it.
Harry took his time in approaching, unsure of what was about to happen and what he was in for. The Fat Lady gasped as someone coming in from behind gently nudged her aside, and Harry stepped out. "Darcy?" he asked.
Darcy's hand reached out from her wrapping of blankets, and her hand snapped out toward it, a scowl spread across her face. "Leave," she said, clutching the letter tightly, burning up in raw shame as she tried to compose herself enough to open it up. Crabbe and Goyle used to be ready to do anything for her. Now, they were too busy laughing like jackals about the idea she had breasts. It was a fall greater and more infuriating than Darcy knew how to deal with, but she remained ultimately powerless here.
"You were going to turn me into a girl and fuck me," Harry scowled, his hand going for his jeans, posture shifting as he pulled his zipper down and opened himself up to the sudden chaos of his strangest wants. "It failed, Malfoy. You're the girl now. You're my girl now." Something came over him that he didn't fully understand, driven by the spell itself and compelling him forward with a harsh spike of greed and want.
"I don't know the password, and I don't fucking care, you painted bint! I need to get in there. I'm not sleeping out here in the hall way, and as long as I need to stand here screaming at you, I can make sure you won't be fucking sleeping, either! I need to see Potter!"
"Like you care!" she shouted. She bared her teeth to him, still angry and territorial even when it seemed like an absolute embarrassment to be putting on airs like this. It was a pose, and not a particularly convincing once. "You turned me into this, used me, threw me away to run back. For you, I'm sure it was unf. Get your dick wet, humiliate me. Say lots of things to make yourself feel like a big man. But me? I had to run back to my family telling them I failed, and now my father has disowned me. My two closest friends are likely to rape me if I'm alone with them again, and the girl I loved won't even call me by my name because she's afraid talking to me will make people think she's gay! I've lost the respect of everybody in the Slytherin house and failed in the only thing I had to do to prove to the Dark Lord that I was worthy!"
Darcy wished she had it in her to take a swing at Harry, that his attitude was one she could somehow shut up and stomp all over. But she felt powerless here, and instead limply stumbled off, completely unable to mount nay good argument against these pressures. Shuffling off with his cum leaking out of her, Darcy knew that with every step she took, she wasn't getting any closer to normalcy. She was bound for her dorm, bound for the insane conversations she'd need to have what would surely do nothing to help her find her dignity again. She was trapped in this insane position now of simply having to give in completely to whatever madness Harry had in mind for her. Permanently.
It felt good. it felt so good. She hated that fact more than anything, thrashing under the guilty ache and worry of these pressures, but the reality was, this all felt amazing. Searing ecstasy took her down low, left her a twisting wreck struggling to deal with how senselessly all these pleasures could wear at her. Draco couldn't help but burn for more of this, her hips rising off of the floor, moans struggling to try and escape from her lips in a desperate show of passion and heat, of a fire burning brighter through her, and she just didn't have a prayer of stopping it now. It was too much, and every part of her body ached and burned with a focused sense of dismay.
"Like filth and disappointment," Draco spat back, refusing to give Harry any satisfaction here, if only as a matter of stubborn pride. "You can go now. You proved your point: you're a pig who forces yourself onto girls. It's good to see your true colours."
Harry remained level and tense. "You challenged me to this duel, and you lost. You can be as mad as you want, but you would have done the same to me. Now get your pants off." Harry stood gleefully over Draco. "Come on, Malfoy. Show me your pussy. Let's see if all of you is female now."
"D-Darcy?" She wanted to be furious, wanted to his and curse and spit up a storm in anger, but for some reason, her cheeks went bright red and a sense of sweet, coy joy washed over her. Darcy. It sounded like a nice name, and partly because of the compromising mental pressures that demanded she obey Harry, she found herself taking a liking to it. "I--that's not--you don't get to name me, Potter!"
"Duel me," Harry shot back. Simple. Direct. He held his wand out and prepared himself, and Draco took up his own duelling stance. The candle flames flickered powerfully before flaring up brighter and turning a sickly blue. The fight was on.
Then Harry came, and everything plunged even deeper. Darcy's arms threw themselves around him as he slammed balls deep into her snug pussy, his cock pulsating and pumping hot shots of sticky cum deep into her. He was strong and dominant and everything she didn't realize she so desperately wanted from him until she felt it all take her, her new female form utterly ripe for the taking and powerless against the ecstasy of being cummed inside of. Her body thrashed about, the life-changing joys of giving up to this leaving her a hopeless and frayed sort of mess, powerless against the pressures that took their worst toll on her. She felt clueless, baffled, and compeltely spent.
Harry stood over her, and Darcy flung forward. buried her face against his stomach, pounding her fists down against his chest. This was all his fault. Darcy believed it and Harry knew she did, so he let her work her anger out, let her slam her hands down against his chest and struggle her way through the volatile emotions taking her.
The climax ripping through Darcy so much hotter and stronger. She trembled in the wild aftermath of all these crushing joys, loving every second of what hit her and needing desperate to slide deeper into it. It was joy, an overbearing ecstasy she craved more than anything, head rolling bacvk, crushing ecstasy hitting her with overbearing delight and a guilty rush of pure satisfaction. This was everything she needed it to be, even if she wasn't sure she wanted it to be. But she moaned, "Cum in me," with a certain fire and intensity that definitely felt like it was real. All of it. All real and maddening and plunging her into a state of chaos that she wasn't sure she would ever come out from.
"You aren't welcome here. No loser tramps in this place," Pansy said. "I'm not putting up with rumours about being a lezzie because you're in here. Go sleep in the common room." Pansy was defensive and furious about the mere possibility people might think this somehow would lead to people thinking she was gay, a petulant teenager steeped in the most bizarrely self-conscious stupidity, but for that reason alone, Darcy wasn't even going to be able to call the Slytherin dorms her home. The girls of her year had completely demented ideas of what changing into a girl meant for Darcy, while the boys in her year were liable to force themselves on her in her sleep. But her parents weren't going to take her. Nobody would take her.
Said tits were due for a blasting with cum, as Harry groaned out, "So close," in warning. Darcy lingered around his cock a bit longer, sucking steadily away in a fit of passion and frustration, opening herself up to the writhing chaos of pushing onward, unable to resist these sinfully potent thrills, pleasures and passions taking her harder by the second, opening her up to the wild fever of a world she was horribly unprepared to be facing. She drew her head back and received the prize awaiting her, Harry's cock erupting all over her face and her chest, making her shiver under the wild pressures and fever of giving up so steeply.  Darcy took it all, trying to hold back the desire to moan as she received it. The pleasure and the chaos of this made for something so ferocious and baffling for her, and she wished she was able to resist these strange pressures.
'Embarrassment' did not begin to cover what began to brew. The candles' flames dulled, but turned a sudden, wavering violet colour. A violet that began to blow from Draco's body in turn, Harry stumbling his way back in shock while the light turned blinding, consuming the Slytherin's form and casting the whole room in its strange purple glow. Fierce and overbearing light cast its strange, sickly glow over the room. It kept harry from seeing nay of what was happening, but in his panic, he flung himself forward. He didn't like Malfoy. Not even a little bit. But his first thought, even if he couldn't see, was that something was happening to him, and he moved to pull his robes off, fearing he'd have to smother out some magical flames. Draco let out wild, hellish shrieks, his voice rising in pitch in ways that grated at Harry's ears, made this seem all the more insane to him as he threw himself forward to try and help him back from this writhing panic. He needed to do something, he reasoned, but as he finally reached Draco across the room, the light was already fading, there were bigger problems now to handle.
That was the emptiest thread Harry could have ever imagined, but he stood there amused at first, taking in the sight of her trying to act all high and mighty. it brought hi the sort of depraved and twisted excitement he knew could only get better. Letting it linger a moment he soaked it all in, even let her get up to her feet, and let Darcy sink into a false sense of security. It just made it more fun to get her complacent before he seized her long blonde locks and forced her over at the hip, bending her into place and slamming from behind up her twat with a vindictive fever, ready to go at it again, and even harder now. "I think I'd rather watch you leave with more cum leaking out."
The mewling shame of being pushed to these drastic sweeps of heat and panic all took a weirder toll on Darcy, who struggled with how good her body felt, with the sensation and joy of being filled with Harry's cock and subjected to these abrupt pressures. It was better than she felt she could have possibly braced for, with every throb of her body bringing her closer to oblivion. It felt good in all the ways she didn't want things to feel good here. The choice wasn't hers, though, as much as she wanted it to be, and with hopeless throbs of passion and joy, her body unraveled, giving in to the spectacle and chaos of letting these passions consume her.
"Are you ready to lose everything now, Potter?" Draco hissed, standing with his wand drawn, the candles flickering with a sickly green glow unlike anything Harry had ever seen before. On the floor lay a chain that somehow tied into this ritual. A ritual that Harry didn't understand in the least, but Draco had challenged him to a duel under rules that demanded his acceptance or suffer deep consequences to his magic. "When I win this duel, you will be done for. You will have to submit, and you will stand aside."
"We're running messages for you, why don’t you flash us your tits?" Crabbe laughed along with it all.
Darcy whimpered her way through surrendering to this chaos, his grip turning her hair into a handle and all sense of control melting out of her in a hasty rush of sloppy chaos and worry. She couldn't believe this was all happening to her, and she was utterly indignant, furious with this treatment and with the way he took to so shamelessly using her, pounding without restraint into her pussy and showing her no mercy. It was exactly what Darcy should have expected, but the panic and her shrieks showed off just how helpless she was, caught off guard and left to struggle and flail her way through receiving these wild, chaotic sweeps. She felt lost here, struggling for sense and for focus while each deep slam forward rattled her, induced a sense of complete obedience within her. She didn't have a choice but to give in, and she knew it.
