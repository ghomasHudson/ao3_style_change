Oh, just
“You never told me.”
care about each other. Fucking hell, Draco,
Harry can’t. He ca’t, but he wants.
After a while, he moved his hand from under Harry’s.
“Head...phones?”
I apologise for waiting by the back door in the hopes of catching a glimpse of you. It wasn’t very polite, or straightforward, especially after you’d asked me to leave you alone. I won’t come again, unless you’re fine with it.
Potter?”
Draco lets his head drop against the back of the sofa. “It’s over.” He sighs, a trembling exhale. “You’re the one who saw it first. You’re the one who said it. ‘This is a nightmare. This is fucking
—? Hope beating in his throat, hands squeezed into fists to quell the trembling, Draco swallowed.
Harry leaned in so Draco could hear him better. He was starting to suspect Harry enjoyed being close to him. The thought sent a little jolt to his gut, and humiliatingly, he felt his cock twitch in his pants at the contact of Harry’s breath on the side of his neck.
“Next steps, Scorpius, what are the next steps?” Harry had asked, trying to keep the desperate edge out of his voice. Eventually, Harry, with the help of Balzac gently nuzzling Scorpius’ side, had managed to get Scorpius back on a semblance of a routine; they’d all walked upstairs after Harry had Accio’d some bread and cheese for a quick snack for Scorpius — he’d doubted anyone was in the mood to eat a proper dinner, let alone cook it. Up on the first floor, he’d helped Scorpius get undressed. The boy had refused to even touch water. Harry had cast a mild Scourgify on Scorpius' face and hands, vanishing the grime and dried blood there. A proper bath would be a battle for another day. Then the three of them had moved to Scorpius’ bedroom. Harry had tucked the sheets around Scorpius, the way Draco had told him he always did. The boy’s magic had felt like an immobile dark mass tonight, like Harry was standing on the shore of Hogwarts’ Great Lake, wondering when the giant squid would burst out of the water. Balzac had jumped on the bed, curling at Scorpius’ feet, his big brown eyes blinking at his little master, and Harry’s heart had felt threateningly full.
I broke you. Didn’t I?
He’d hoped he might be able to take his time with Malfoy too. Savour it. And with Malfoy gone, he wonders if it’s all been a strange fever dream, a passing fantasy, a fad. Harry second-guesses himself some nights. Maybe he doesn’t like blokes after all. Maybe he was just gay for Malfoy, which doesn’t seem completely implausible — who in their right minds wouldn’t?
“Fuck me,” Malfoy let an admiring breath out.
“Oh, but I think we do.”
he cries out once more. Auror Boyle’s mouth twist into a pained grimace, and her diverted attention seems to break one of the spells — the one holding Balzac down. Without the Aurors noticing, the dog scrambles to his feet, runs and pounces on the nearest Auror with a snarl and a bark.
for your own good, Harry. The fact that you don’t even see that makes you even more special. I envied you so much for it — Merlin, I still do. I wish I was as good as you.”
“My wife left because I
The charity ball tonight is in support of some noble cause or another — the specifics have already fled Harry’s brain. Wizards Without Frontiers? The Wishing Well Foundation? Tea Towels For All Elves? More likely something to do with trade, given the setting. The Chamber of Commerce is a magnificent building, and tonight it sparkles brighter than ever, fairy lights hanging from every moulding, the jaunty tunes of the band ringing through every hallway. Harry has been here many evenings before. The ostentatious splendour of the place never fails to fill him with awe while simultaneously giving him a pounding headache. Sprawling marble floors and sculpted staircases at every turn, and those ridiculous ceilings on which painted winged cherubs chase skimpily dressed maidens.
With a roll of his eyes—the git was
With a nod, Draco pulled his satchel into his lap and took a small, round object out. Luna, face bright with curiosity, leaned in to look at the thing nestled in Draco’s palm. “Oooh, what’s that?” she asked excitedly.
For a fraction of second, Draco’s eyes travel down his face, down his neck. When he looks back up to meet Harry’s eyes, it’s shockingly intense.
Draco barks, his cold composure finally cracking. “I told you not to say it! Not when this can’t be real!”
“To your second point,” Ron adds almost apologetically, “we have a way to get you started with Malfoy that we hope looks natural and unsuspicious.”
Retracing his steps up until the — again, metaphorical — fall is a bit easier to approach. Harry focuses on rational, reasonable questions.
Harry snorted.
Daddy smiled and smiled.
“Scorp—” Harry calls. Malfoy hasn’t come back from the kitchen. He’s supposed to stay with Scorpius.
He won’t get out of it unless he closes it, however; and that means he has to prove Malfoy is clean, not by showing there is no proof of guilt, but by showing proof of innocence.
“Well…” Hermione starts.
And without another look at Harry, Draco strode out of the kitchen.
an opportunity to have you working under him.”
Yeah, you know, I kinda sussed that out by myself :)
Harry gulps.It’s late. He’s had too much to drink. He’s reading too much into things.
“Every. Time.”
“Yes,” Harry whined, pushing his arse back.
“Definitely. So many magical species were on the brink of extinction—the ones Voldemort and his followers didn’t deem useful or important enough, at least. The public didn’t know about that. Or maybe they didn’t think it was a priority.” She looked down at her hands, clasped in her lap. She smiled ruefully. “It’s funny, isn’t it? How people like to prioritise good causes by order of...
“Hey, mate,” Ron greets him. He stands as Kingsley and Harry walk in, his freckled face crinkling with a cautious smile. “Nice seeing you again.”
Indeed, Narcissa and Andromeda were sitting with their heads leaned close together. Draco couldn’t hear the content of their conversation, but he could tell by the rapid-fire words and the conspiratorial looks that the two sisters were taking great pleasure in catching up.
“Yeah, but you’d love to measure your own skill against that, wouldn’t you?”
you.” He seemed to reconsider his words, and cast a wary glance at Harry. “Forget I said anything. It’s just a stupid theory, anyway.”
“You don't need me at all, do you?” Harry asks, flatly.
“Help me get out of the assignment,” Draco interrupted, his slow, measured words carefully masking the thunderous beat of his blood inside him. “Show me how to get out of the assignment, and I’ll give you this invaluable ring.”
he’d said.
Harry must take Draco’s silence for reproach — wariness. He turns his gaze back at him. His eyes are wistful, like he knows something Draco doesn’t.
Draco faltered, but he was going too fast. He had already started to spin. There was a split-second of mortifying realisation, then he felt himself fall. The tips of his blades caught in the ice and he landed inelegantly, his elbow hitting the cold hard surface.
Draco’s eyes are shining when he looks at him.
Draco’s face shutters again.
Draco bent down and set the golden top on the floor. It started to spin faster with a faint buzzing sound. Amongst the luxurious vegetation, it could have easily been mistaken for a bumblebee foraging from flower to flower.
He stands, picks up the clothes he’s dropped in a bundle near the bed. Draco hasn’t stirred yet. His closed eyelids and peaceful face are begging to be kissed. Would Draco object to being woken up for a round of slow morning sex? Not wanting to try his luck so early in the day, Harry decides to come back with a cup of coffee as enticement — shower, fresh clothes, then coffee. He pads out of Draco’s bedroom as quietly as he can. Rushing up the stairs naked, he’s suddenly more grateful than ever that Draco’s room is just a floor below his. At least there’s no risk of running into an unsuspecting child or house-elf in his state of love-bite-covered undress.
I feel like an arse.
Scorpius coming, Mistor Potter. Ernestina would not miss him for anything.” She smiles at the thought of her charge, and her whole expression changes from wary to fond.
feel that way anymore. I hope the good I’ve done since the war surpasses and outlasts my past actions. I might never apologise enough for them, but I’m also sick of apologising for them, you know? There’s a delicate balance between fruitless remorse and indulgent self-satisfaction, but I need elements of both. Remorse keeps me on the right track. Pride in who I’ve become gives me a reason to keep going.
Ron’s eyebrows disappear under his fringe, and even Hermione carefully drops the toys she's holding into the toy box before straightening up, gazing at Harry with that pointed, knowing look.
“Sorry, we didn’t mean to interrupt. Has the interview started?”
The most glorious thing is when Harry kisses him back with a desperate sound.
“Then if you do,” Draco casts his eyes down, “can you just please pretend?”
“Personal quill-fetcher, remember?”
“I— I wasn’t lying,” Harry says, eyes locked on Malfoy’s. He can hear the chatter of guests getting louder down the corridor, and he doesn’t want to draw attention. Especially not here, now, having his conversation with Draco Malfoy, of all people. He doesn’t even know if Malfoy was rightfully invited here, or if he’s just sneaking around on one of his stealing missions. He keeps his voice low. “It’s all so new to me. I’m not… ready.”
“Shhh!!” Draco pushed the Niffler off his boot, looking left and right. “I’m not supposed to know you!”
was pulsing inside. It was how he always felt around Harry these days.
Harry makes the decision for him. He strokes Draco’s hair out of his face, tucks it behind his ear with warm, featherlight knuckles. There’s a raw, reverent tenderness in the way he touches Draco, and Draco is helpless and unreserved in his hands. Harry’s fingers trail along the collar of Draco’s shirt. They stop against his pulse point, a question.
Draco stroked Harry’s prick—still hard, still gleaming with Draco’s saliva—and leaned in to suck it into his mouth again. He wanted to smile at Harry’s garbled moan but his lips were stretched too tight. He closed his eyes and let the sensation wash over him, Harry filling his mouth with tiny jerky movements, his thighs trembling with need, his arsehole fluttering under the soft pads of Draco’s fingers—
They break for air, just an inch of space between their lips, foreheads pressed together — Draco’s already panting, desperate, Harry’s hot breath bathing his face.
As McGonagall walked down the stairs briskly a few paces ahead of them, Draco pulled Harry by the sleeve and brought him to a halt.
They are starting the next stage of their lives.
“Yeah. You put them in your ears to listen to music,” Harry explained. A curious sense of relief washed over Draco at the normality of their conversation. He noticed Harry had relaxed as well: he was thumbing one of the headphones, bringing it close to his face. “It’s a Muggle invention,” he continued. “I don’t think there’s a wizarding equivalent... at least not yet.”
“Half of the people you love are still here.”
Harry has thought about it. But he’s also read Kingsley’s reactions to his memos, each one of them proving that Draco’s main activities are working for Caduceus, going for his daily run and spending time with his son — as well as his occasional conversations with Harry, but Harry never mentions them. It’s been more than four months now, and Kingsley keeps asking Harry for more of his time, more information, more details. Harry reads between the lines and knows that the Minister is still not convinced of Draco’s innocence. He’ll probably never be. Yet as long as Harry’s there, learning as much as he can about Draco and sharing information with the Ministry and the DMLE, he knows Draco’s safer than with any other agent of the Ministry.
“So what? I changed sides for you when I was seventeen.”
“And I always put my heart into things too,” Hermione adds.
Sometimes I wish she had. It would clarify the definition of what constitutes ‘hurting you’. Get the words out there. Now, I live in constant fear of upsetting you and finding myself in the trajectory of her mean right hook.
“What do you mean…?”
Ron nods, as Hermione wraps her arms around him in a hug.
That’s it. You know everything. Nothing exciting, I told you.
Harry chuckles softly. “I haven’t even touched you yet.”
“Yes,” Malfoy says, his eyes cold. “You are.”
“I tried to be an Auror. It just… wasn’t for me.” Harry picks at a stray grain of rice, gathering his own things off the table. “Maybe it was too close to the end of the war. Maybe I had too much to deal with on my own. I couldn’t get into the discipline that Auror training required of me. I didn’t pay attention in class; my mind drifted constantly. I was late almost every single day. Sleeping through my alarms—”
in this chapter. You can listen to one of my favorite versions of this piece
Ron’s jaw works as if he’s about to say something, but he stays quiet.
too late.”
“And the Minister?”
When Harry pushes the door open, Draco is sitting on his bed, fully dressed, hands between his knees and head hanging forward.
“You think you’re stronger than me, do you?” Draco pushes harder. He’s smiling, too. It looks slightly strained, though, a bit dangerous, and Harry can detect something like resentment underneath. “Just because you’re a big, bad, burly bodyguard?”
Just when they’re walking back up from the kitchen, the front door opens and closes, a flutter of footsteps, gentle murmurs and Balzac’s soft, happy barks.
“I think I do quite all right on my own, Potter,” he says. Harry’s name in Malfoy’s posh accent sounds like it’s always done, the short, contemptuous ‘Pottah’ that signals Malfoy’s status as much as his dislike of Harry. Harry’s longing for an anonymous walk through London by night morphs into melancholy for the old times, his early Hogwarts years where he hated Malfoy, Malfoy hated him, and everything was simple and magic and wonderful.
” Kingsley concedes.
A snowstorm was coming.
But Harry is not the bane of his existence anymore.
“You'd switch sides... for me?”
“I don’t think there’s anything like that,” Harry says at last, so quietly that Draco almost misses it. “It’s only what we do with the cards we were dealt, you know?” He turns his earnest green eyes to Draco, which has the same heart-speeding, breath-stealing effect as always. “And you… you were either dealt a wonderful hand, or a terrible one, depending on how you choose to look at it. I think… when you were younger, you thought you had it brilliant. And then you realised it wasn’t as it seemed, and you worked to change it.” Eyes still fixed on Draco, he lifts his chin as if challenging him to disagree. “Am I wrong?”
“Who—who’s there?”
my family today.”
to go the way the day is going. Harry steps closer, Balzac moving aside to make room for him next to Scorpius’ seat. “And it doesn’t make me uncomfortable at all. So you don’t have to worry about it.”
Scorpius plays a (simplified) version of Chopin's
“Malfoy—wait,” he said, pushing up. Malfoy’s fingers slipped out of his arse and they both heaved a disappointed sigh. Harry shook himself into action. “There’s something here… Look.”
Draco shifts his eyes away. “Yes.” His throat feels tight. He wants Harry to take him in his arms again. To take him, and make him forget. “Just… promise me.”
Not anymore, anyway.
“It was your last day,” Draco reminds him. “You could have left already.”
“Do you really need to be doing this here and now?” Weasley asked, gesturing with his fork, threatening to drip grease from the slice of bacon that was dangling from it. Granger swatted his hand away.
“I’m getting there,” he said. His other hand holding Harry’s trembling thigh, he gave his cock a pump, then licked the leaking slit, getting his first taste. It was salty-sweet and earthy, but far from unpleasant. Harry whined a little at the teasing contact.
to touch him. Make him see. “You listen to me. This is me apologising. This is me promising you, I’ll never hurt you again. Ever.”
“Draco.”
Draco paused and gazed briefly at his wedding band, remembering that
“Why would anything be going on between me and Malfoy?”
“Someone like Zacharias Smith,” Draco all but spits.
“Hmm. I might have availability in the near future.”
Draco shouldn’t be enjoying Harry’s proximity as much as he does. He shouldn’t be.
Harry’d cringed. “That was an unexpected surprise.” He’d taken the Disillusioned bag hidden behind him on the bed. “But I still have a gift for you.” The spell had faded away instantly, and he’d handed it to Draco. “Here.”
“What makes them different, besides being indecently wealthy?”
“As soon as you can move in,” Malfoy says. “The whole upper floor of the house will be yours for the duration of your employment.”
Draco's breath hitched when the door creaked open. From behind it, Luna Lovegood’s heart-shaped face appeared. She smiled at him.
Malfoy swallows, his Adam’s apple rising and falling along his long, pale neck. “How recently?” he asks. His voice comes out soft and strained.
Ernestina pops her head around the corner of the corridor.
“Very well, Mr Potter. I shall,” she tells him with a sharp smile that doesn’t bode well for Harry. “In fact, I’m looking forward to it.”
“True. How many plant-based emergencies can one have in a day?”
The calm shatters. Harry whips around. Malfoy is leaning against the doorframe of the bedroom, a small smile on his lips. He’s wearing one of those Muggle suits of his, his white-blond hair catching the sunlight pouring into the room and gleaming, clean and soft-looking. Harry feels his face heating and he has no idea why: Malfoy should be the one who’s embarrassed, coming to Harry’s room uninvited.
Kingsley turns to Ron, who clears his throat.
“Not a problem, Draco,” he felt the Niffler move closer, “I know what it’s like to be a young man in the prime of life. Well obviously, I don’t, but I’ve been around long enough for your impromptu morning activities not to shock my sensibilities.”
“Fine,” Ginny rolled her eyes fondly. “We give him a week, see how it goes. If he behaves, he stays.”
“Fuck,” Draco hisses into his arm. Harry’s panting behind him. Draco’s still bent over the desk, arse in the air. He feels the hot trickle of Harry’s come on his balls, the inside of his thigh, and wonders what a debauched spectacle he must make for Harry. His cock twitches again at the thought. He moves just a few inches back and away from the desk, enough room to wrap his fist around his own straining cock. He gives it a meaningful jerk, turns to look at Harry over his shoulder. “I’m not
“Even better,” Draco growls, pumping his fist in time with Harry’s fingers sliding in and out of his arse, Harry’s come leaking out of him as his orgasm mounts. He writhes against the desk, overstimulated, chasing relief.  “I’m about to come, Harry, I’m—” he warns, not knowing why he does, and Harry wraps his other arm around Draco’s chest, lifts him off the desk. Held upright by Harry’s arm, Harry’s fingers still pumping inside him, Draco’s body goes taut. His orgasm hits him like that, and he comes with a strangled cry, his come splashing over his belly, Harry’s arm, his desk. He drops his head back against Harry’s shoulder and lets out a strangled sob as his fist works his spent cock, shivering with the last waves of his orgasm.
Hope you enjoy! 💚
No to spoil, but... we're now getting to my favorite part of this story. I thought about writing
All the leggings’ fault.
-Draco
“You may be right about everything you told me yesterday, but you’re wrong about — about Draco.” Harry rubs his jaw, turning the words that come next over in his head before saying them. “He’s still the same in so many ways — all sharp edges and dry wit — but he’s changed. He’s genuinely made amends. He’s trying to be the best person he can. If you saw him with his little boy… With his employees… you wouldn’t believe your eyes at first. Still… when we talk, Hermione, it’s so easy. It’s like the walls drop between us. And the mix of the old Draco Malfoy, who used to drive me round the bend just by existing, and the new one, who’s clever and good and who’s my friend… it’s making me crazy for him. I want to be with him. I want him. I know it might jeopardise this case. Possibly my whole future. I feel so… laughable.” He lifts his eyes to his friend, almost in apology. “Do you think I am?”
Potter took a swig of his champagne. “Still. ‘S nice to be asked sometimes,” he muttered into his glass. The words were petulant, but Draco thought he could hear something else under them. Something vulnerable. His Potter-sense stood to attention.
Life in the years after the war served to clear Draco’s head of any remaining fantasies of green eyes, lean, compact bodies and strong fingers twined in Draco’s hair; for which he was neither thankful nor resentful. He just didn’t think about Potter anymore, not in the obsessive, bitter way he used to.

Scorpius’ hands stop abruptly on the keys. His eyebrows still drawn, his eyes still fixed on the keyboard. He taps his fingers to the keys, a soundless
When he reaches the door to Draco’s study, his breath catches.
Even in the dim light, Harry can see Draco turn a shade paler.
This—this isn’t about
Luna chose to ignore his cowering. She laughed, but not unkindly.
They’d fucked again that morning, after they’d heard Harry’s roommates leave the room. And one more exhausted time after that, when Draco had come dryly with Harry’s right hand around his cock and his left thumb pressing into his arsehole. He’d felt his muscles clamp down around Harry’s finger. Harry’s eyes had gone wide with surprise. He’d wondered with a thrill what it would feel like, having more of Harry inside him, giving himself over completely, letting Harry take him. And then Harry’d come on his stomach, three brief spurts of come after several consecutive orgasms, and Draco had fallen back against the mattress with Harry in his arms and filed this new fantasy for later discussion.
“I need you to not be there when I get home.” Draco’s words have an unarguable finality to them. Harry’s stomach sinks.
“Draco –” Harry's voice comes out strangled, pleading. His black hair is sticking to his sweaty forehead, and Draco feels incredibly sexy, powerful, wanted. He pushes up into Harry’s fist and gasps.
“Yes,” Draco says, running the flat of his palm down Harry’s back. His skin is still damp, shivering in the wake of Draco’s touch.
Tell Draco Malfoy what, though?
for the use of a slur against an autistic character.
Jesus, how he
“I’m not even sure you need to apologise to anyone, really,” Harry continued. “Tell you the truth, Hermione would probably be terribly disconcerted by a formal apology. And Neville would be terrified. Still,” he said thoughtfully, “I think if you did, they would appreciate it.”
“I think Ron would like this one,” Harry said, sticking his nose to the shop’s window like a little child. “He left his favourite chess set at Hogwarts at the end of Sixth Year. He says it’s lost now.”
Why he’d fallen so easily into Malfoy’s open arms — metaphorically speaking — is too big a question.
“Do you think he might feel the same about you?”
“Mistor promise Ernestina he will not make rash decisions?” she asks, her hand coming up to cover the one resting on her shoulder.
to tell me. If it’s going to help your case at all… Tell me. What is the link?”
“It’s not the only reason why I frequent the rich and the famous.”
Despite the gravity of their situation, Harry burst out laughing. He grabbed Malfoy’s hand and pulled.
“Ah—wait. Your formula works for
Harry's had this done to him before. Ginny had wanted to try, and then a few of the girls he’d been with in the short-lived string of hookups he’d had in the wake of his breakup with Ginny.
“You’ve seen my main study already. Let me show you the rest of the floor, and then there’s the kitchen and wine cellar in the basement.”
Draco takes a breath, then starts talking again.
“Mistor Draco has a schedule.” Ernestina sniffs, the unspoken
“Oh, you should see Arthur whenever I bring it to their house,” she says. “It’s the height of technology, honestly.”
He very well knew it wasn’t fear that made him shake. He refused to acknowledge that particular thought. Now was not the time.
“You know, I always thought you were terribly obnoxious when we were kids.” Draco doesn’t know where the desire to confess this comes from. They’re standing near the water, watching Scorpius and Balzac observe the ducks paddling across the pond.
“I don’t mind,” Draco told him. “I’ve... I’ve no problem with people knowing I’m with you. But I could understand if you did.”
“Oh good, you've found her. She's probably sleeping.”
“Merlin,” Ginny murmured, rubbing her neck where the collar of her jumper met her freckled skin. When she looked at them, her eyes were shining with moisture. “Do you think all our Christmases will be like this?
Draco is going to come in his pants like a bloody teenager, like his fourteen-year-old self… and he’s fine with that, he’s more than fine with that, it’s like coming full circle, all the shame and loneliness and fear he felt back then, touching himself to thoughts of Potter, finally making sense. The final proof he needed—shared, irrepressible desire. Harry’s hand wraps more firmly around him and he lets go — feels his cock twitch, feels the stupefied relief of orgasm wash over him as Harry kisses the corner of his mouth, the ring in his eyebrow, the side of his neck, murmuring almost unintelligible encouragements
His fists clench. Most days, he likes the job he’s chosen for himself. He likes the freedom, he likes the feeling of working towards something good, something bigger than him. He likes following in the footsteps of the people who shaped his view of the world, back when he was just a kid.
Draco shook his head and pushed the thoughts away. He reached the end of the rink, gathered speed and successfully spun himself around. Lucifer, it felt so good. How could he have let other people dictate what he should or shouldn’t enjoy for so long? Who cared, really, if something was unfit of a Malfoy? Who cared if demons weren’t supposed to have this sort of easy fun? Nobody was watching Draco now, so why did it matter?
There was something cold and metallic under him.
Oh? And who’s that celebrity wizard you’re referring to? Should I be jealous?
Dear Drake,
“Muggles have such a vivid imagination,” he murmured. “I mean, I guess you’d have to, to come up with these lyrics. Do they really believe they could put a man on the moon?”
Ernestina looks like she’s trying very hard not to scowl. Reluctantly, she sets towards Draco’s study.
I can’t believe that
** Mephisto's formal demonic greeting is a quote from
“I’ve no idea what I’m doing. I don’t want to hurt you,” Harry whispers, and Malfoy’s answer is a fond roll of the eyes.
He looks like he’d want nothing more than to murder Harry.
Instead, he forced his own desire down and closed his right fist around the base of Harry’s cock. He’d touched Harry already. Yet this was something filthier, sexier,
Harry had a good feeling about Malfoy’s house when he came in for his interview. And ten minutes after moving in that Monday are enough to confirm that he actually likes the place quite a lot.
Harry falls forward, his legs still bracketing Draco’s, one hand braced next to Draco’s face, his cock hard and heavy as it hangs between his legs. He takes it in his hand and starts fisting it. His frantic breath hits Draco’s face, a soft whine on each exhale. He’s not holding back anymore, and he’s so fucking hot, Draco almost regrets coming first as he lies there, surrounded by Harry, mad with the feel of him, waiting for Harry’s orgasm to mark his body again. He turns his head, nuzzles Harry’s hand next to him. Licks the soft skin between thumb and forefinger, touches his lips to Harry’s thumb, sucks it into his mouth. Harry gasps, the strength of this breath hitting Draco’s cheek, and then his entire body goes still and he comes, the heat of it splashing across Draco’s soft cock and heaving chest, his slick fist moving over his prick for a few long seconds. Draco drinks him in, the sounds escaping Harry’s mouth, the look on his face, the tension in his shoulders just before it releases, the pumps of Harry’s hand still enclosing his spent cock. When he feels like he can move again, Draco reaches up. Wraps his arms around Harry’s shoulders and brings him down against him, Harry’s trembling body covering his.
“Oh. What then?”
“I thought they’d hate me,” Draco mumbled, overwhelmed by Harry’s words, by his warm presence, by the heavy scent of the wool coats surrounding them. “I thought they’d hate me until she hugged me.”
Scorpius eventually looks up from his intense duck-watching and frowns when he sees his dad laughing with Harry. As the boy walks over to them, followed by his dog, Draco’s heart leaps when he catches Harry’s expression, a warm, almost fond smile playing on the corner of his mouth.
“It isn’t! Not on my terms!”
give a shite.”
the little voice in his head nags him.
It was the most amazing, exhilarating, toe-curling, stars-bursting-behind-his-eyes blowjob he’s ever had.
“No,” Draco tells him, feeling a little faint. It’s cold, and the low winter sun seems to turn the world hazy and weird, narrowing it down to Harry’s bright emerald gaze and the lip he’s worrying between his teeth, waiting for Draco’s response. “No, that’s exactly what happened,” he admits.
“You never answered my question,” Harry retorts.
“Then maybe you
“And you’re fine with working… for me?” Malfoy asks, looking uninterested and aloof but for the slight hesitation at the end of his question.
“And this is Scorpius,” Malfoy drawls, and Harry doesn’t miss the note of pride in his voice. “Scorpius, this is Harry Potter.”
Draco paled.
“But you do so much more!” Hermione sits straighter, an earnestness on her face that reminded Harry of her most determined library moments at Hogwarts. “Before
Draco walks around a gaggle of brightly-dressed tourists stationed on the pavement across from Westminster. The abbey is beautifully illuminated for the night, its tall roof poking out of sheets of rain. Draco’s heart squeezes in his chest. Maybe a walk wasn’t a good idea; the beauty of his city is almost too much to bear in his current state of dejection. He’s terrified for his son, for Ernestina, for what will happen tomorrow when the press gets the first whiff of his arrest. The scandal they’ll no doubt construct based on a blurry photograph and a bland, ‘no comment’ statement from the Aurors. He feels lonely and helpless, surrounded by crowds of people walking down the same streets as him, his own distress completely out of their reach. Thousands of thoughts race through his mind. He’s unable to stop them and equally unable to settle on one and dissect it. There are two thoughts he’s avoided since the Aurors bound him and took him to the Ministry, and he only allows himself to go back to them when the silhouette of Buckingham Palace is behind him and the trees of Eaton Square Gardens come into view.
“Surely defeating a madman who's tried to kill you since you were born would do that to someone,” Draco muttered, unsettled by the direction the conversation was taking.
Narcissa walks closer to him and pats his cheek. “I know, darling. I can’t help it. I’m your mother… I’m just looking out for you.”
They all take seats around the table — Harry ends up between Draco and his mother. From across the table, Blaise lifts an eyebrow as if to say,
Harry eyes him through rain-soaked hair falling in his eyes, hoping Draco will say more. But Draco simply smiles, a small, crooked smile that makes his cool eyes sparkle, and takes Harry by the shoulder.
sang Matilda.
“Because I believe you,” Harry says out loud, “but I don’t have concrete proof yet. And if I drop out of the investigation now, they will replace me with someone else. Someone who’ll likely be less scrupulous, and likely resort to any means to please the Minister.”
Harry nods, too, moved by the tale of the elf’s loyalty and Malfoy’s perceptiveness. He clears his throat, a thousand pressing questions in his mind.
“Well?” Harry asked him. He looked almost shy. “Besides learning a newsworthy piece of information—and I’m not talking about my sexual preferences—” he smiled, and Draco squirmed on the sofa, “what did you think of the song?”
Draco shakes his head, stepping out of the phone box at the entrance of the Ministry and into the London night. It’s past ten o’clock on a cool, rainy Wednesday night in July, but the streets of Charing Cross are still bustling with life. Draco shoves his hands in his trouser pockets and sets off at a brisk pace, his head lowered against the drizzle. A group of young Muggles walk by, laughing raucously and taking much of the space on the pavement. One of the boys pulls one of the girls by the shoulder and in for a kiss on the cheek. The girl squeals, giggles, cuts herself short when she catches Draco’s eyes. “Sorry, mate,” the young bloke says, making room for Draco to pass.
Harry had just shrugged. “I wanted to buy you something French.” Draco had huffed a laugh at that. “It’s true! And it’s also something you didn’t already have. I checked.”
turned up towards him, as patient and hungry as something lurking in the woods. He can’t… yet he sees the same want he feels, reflected in Malfoy’s eyes. A mirror to Harry’s desire, blending with something akin to awe. To fear.
“I do.” Draco had met his eyes through the mirror. “I haven’t asked you about it.”
Ron shakes his head. “Harry, Kingsley has a lot more faith in you than in Smith. In the end… I think he’ll listen to what you have to say.”
“Let me guess,” Draco had heard Blaise’s voice in the distance of their Parisian flat, “The most ridiculous man on earth?”
Fighting down an amused smile, Draco interrupted. “Thank you. That’s not it.”
And that was the story of how Draco had ended up standing by the drinks section of the buffet that took up the full length of the Great Hall of Hogwarts, watching Blaise and Pansy mingle and laugh with a bunch of people he’d been perfectly fine not thinking about for the past ten years, and downing his second glass of champagne as if it were a vodka shot. Merlin, he
of course.”
“Because you would have, in my place?” Harry asks him, amused.
Like Daddy said.
“You mean, the people who almost locked me up seven years ago for war crimes, and would gladly lock me up today for theft and burglary?”
“Hello, love. How’s the interview going? Is Malfoy being nice?” Longbottom took the proffered cup of tea from Luna’s hands and kissed the top of her head. Draco felt an odd pang of fondness and sadness at the casual display. Standing in the kitchen’s threshold, Harry wore a similarly wistful expression.
“You are?” Harry’s eyes were bright and earnest. Draco didn’t deserve him. But then again, perhaps no one else did. Who cared, then? He was the one Harry had chosen.
To his surprise, Malfoy didn’t push him back or insult him copiously for almost knocking him over.
But Potter doesn’t look like he’s extending a challenge. Potter doesn’t look like he’s thinking of anything at all. With a blank look and a short nod in Draco’s direction, he all but runs for the door, receipt file tucked under his arm, Auror cape flying, the tips of his ears pink.
“Will you
Because I’m getting to know you. Because I’m starting to like you. Because my instincts scream at me that you’re innocent, and my instincts have almost never been wrong.
He stops, giving Harry a meaningful look that sends him back to Hogwarts — to sixth year, and a seemingly broken Vanishing Cabinet that Draco had managed to repair against all odds. “I didn’t know, back then, that it would also help me get my life in check and back on track…” He runs his hand through his hair, pushes a damp lock behind his ear. “Ernestina needed money to start the business she had dreamt of. And she needed a human to embody her project. Obviously, it was impossible for a house elf to start a Muggle business: she would have had to meet with the entire production chain — patent authorities, suppliers, production sites, shops, advertising agencies — and you can imagine how things would have gone if she’d shown up at a meeting with non-magical folk. I was the original investor in Nesting — I gave Ernestina the little money I had left, convinced Pansy, Blaise, Astoria to invest as well — and I became the company’s spokesperson. And when the business launched… Merlin, Harry. It was an overnight success. I knew Ernestina had had a brilliant idea, and our designs were solid, but I never expected it to…
Harry wakes up every morning at six. He gets up, showers, gets dressed for the day based on Draco’s instructions from the day before — suit and tie if they’re going to the Caduceus offices; a casual jeans-and-jumper outfit on the days when Harry brings Scorpius to his therapy appointments, or when Draco plans to work from home. Then he quietly goes downstairs to the kitchen and fixes himself a cuppa and a quick bacon sandwich, which he eats standing, hip propped against the kitchen counter. By the time he’s done, he can hear Draco coming out of his bedroom and down the stairs to go wake up his son.
Inside, standing close to the door, Harry counts two Aurors — Auror Corie Boyle, her Senior Auror golden shoulder pads gleaming in the dim light, and a young man Harry’s never seen before. They both have their wands drawn and pointed towards the back of the room. In front of them, a tall figure dressed in a nondescript suit is pacing, and Harry contains an outraged growl when he recognises Zacharias Smith. He’s going restlessly back and forth the width of the room, his hands behind his back, his face red, a disturbed glee shining on his features.
“Why? Because I’m incapable of good taste on my own?”
Harry nearly chokes on his saliva. He coughs gracelessly, and Malfoy laughs. “I’d be happy to oblige.”
“Now that you mention it, you do look a bit grey in the face.” Harry pats him on the back, pulling him away from the Petersons. Hermione abandons her targets with a resentful sigh and her mouth open and ready to chide Ron and Harry, but then a waiter swoops in with a bottle of white wine. Ron nearly throws himself at the man in relief, and Hermione laughs and cooes at her boyfriend.
The song Harry and Draco listen to in this chapter is
is it?”
Draco clutches his chest, mock-offended. “You wound me, Pansy. Here I was, thinking you’d traveled from Paris for my pretty face and winning personality.”
“They’re not going to notice you’re not returning their memos?”
What he knows is that his own breath is stuck in his throat.
He looks well-shagged and happy, even when he frowns.
Narcissa stands and waves gracefully goodbye after taking a miniscule bite of cake and drinking verbena tea from a dainty golden teacup.
“But...it would mean
“What makes you think I’m hiding something?”
“Daddy?” Scorpius asks, pulling at Malfoy’s trousers fabric. Malfoy turns to look at him and the boy meets his father’s eyes briefly before looking at his shoes. “Why do you not call him Harry?”

...I sure would have missed that gorgeous arse of yours if you had.
“Do you wanna…” Harry asks, trailing off. His eyes are so green and so desperate from this close. His breath is coming out ragged and rushed. And yes. Draco
And he pushes the door open.
Here it is. If you were to make a badge about me now, what would it say?
You’re impossible.
That wasn’t good. Wasn’t good at all. He pulled on his collar.
“Do you want me?” Draco breathed against his lips.
“I— I don’t need that from you—”
Harry thinks with an odd twist in his gut when he sees the inviting queen-sized bed sitting in the middle of the room, flanked by two bedside tables and a round Muggle lamp that looks vintage. Across the room, there’s a beautiful carved pine wardrobe and a chest of drawers topped with a vase containing—
“I’m starting to see it,” Draco said. His heart was thudding. Merlin, how did humans ever get used to that bloody thing bolting in their chests at the slightest emotion?
“This is a fucking nightmare,” he whispers, half-hoping Draco won’t hear him. He clutches Draco’s back tighter, and Draco holds him, one hand cupping the back of his head. “Draco… it's fucking impossible.”
They didn’t move. They
Irrationally, Draco wanted to speak before Harry had time to say another word. Something he should have done, perhaps, months ago.
“That’ll be a first, Potter.”
Hey Draco,
I’m sorry you felt that way.
Harry wishes he could say,
“Potter.”
Well, fine. They’d see. He would go to his class’s tenth year graduation anniversary kicking and screaming—metaphorically speaking, of course. Draco did no such things as kicking or screaming.
He held the tip of the quill just above the parchment, as though hesitating to write the next line.
Malfoy sounds incredulous. "I thought you were rich.”
“Yes. Draco. God, you make me feel so
“In the huge cocks area?” Harry smiles at the sound of Malfoy’s chuckle. He feels silly, making dick jokes in this very moment, but the fact that he made Malfoy laugh lifts some of the tension, and he manages to shuffle into position without too much self-consciousness.
Harry startles so hard he practically falls from his seat. He knows that voice. His breath catches in his throat.

“Oh, Malfoy,
“Enough with the righteous Saviour act, Potter. You know as well as I do that this mistake will mark me forever.”
“Psst!”
Harry burst out laughing.
“Maybe… we can give you gentlemen five minutes?” Penelope’s voice brings him back. She’s already standing, beckoning the girls to follow her.
“Erm. Here’s a question for you.”
Wow, I didn’t anticipate the epic proportions this would take on.
Frankly, Draco didn’t want to think about his next life. He’d grown quite attached to his current one. Leaving it again—soon, so soon—wasn’t something he looked forward to.
Which Harry knows really means
There was a faint line between Harry’s eyebrows, as if saying that pained him. The sight of it rankled.
He decides to ask.
Leaning against the doorframe, Draco smiles faintly. Ernestina has cooked all day and the kitchen is filled with containers of Greg’s favourite foods. Greg always jokes about how Ernestina’s cooking would be the thing he misses the most about working for Draco.
Draco's head snaps around to look at him over his shoulder. His eyes are cool, gleaming in the pale light of a Lumos floating above them. He raises an eyebrow in response to the closed door.
You’re worrying me, here. What is it?”
Well. Just speaking from experience, here. I hate to generalise, but I haven’t met many straight men who spend the amount of time and care you obviously put into your grooming (I am not complaining, mind you)
see—and it was the end of the story.
for a Slytherin.’
The Prothimioscope was buzzing at the foot of Luna’s armchair. Quiet and innocuous like the glossy black beetle that was attempting to scale the potted Asphodel nearby, the golden device anchored Draco in the moment. A mundane, reassuring reminder that this was just another day at Draco’s job, even though it felt like anything but. He didn’t regret coming up with the idea of the
“Mistor!” Ernestina cries. Her arms are bound to her body with thick, magical rope. Her left eye is purple and swollen, her nose is bleeding over her neat, pretty blouse. Harry gapes at her in horror.
“Eh,” Draco shrugged. “I’ve been turned into a ferret before. Being a toad would definitely be an improvement, if you ask me.”
“That is all very lovely, Mistor Draco and Mistor Potter, sirs. But Ernestina sees all the food is gone. Shall Ernestina brings Mistor his birthday cake?”
When he goes downstairs to the kitchen, he finds the Golden Snitch returned, gleaming faintly on the table.
And yet. Harry’s never been more curious about a case in his life.
“Did the

I’ve seen that name so many times before. It’s on all the kid paraphernalia I see, all over London. Hell, even Hermione raves about her Nesting pushchair...  How did I not see it before?” He drops his hand, and the parchment falls to the ground. “This has got something to do with you. Doesn’t it?” When Draco doesn’t reply, Harry lets out a frustrated exhale. “Draco… You’ve
“Just making it extra pretty for you,” Draco lifted his eyebrow. He licked a teasing stripe up the tip, this time with more intent. Harry’s head fell forward with a moan.
“My pleasure,” Harry says before he realises how it sounds and feels his cheeks go hot.
Without breaking eye contact, Draco leaned to the side and grabbed the object of Jeff’s longing glances. The Niffler’s face fell slightly as he did.
Harry slides his fingers around Malfoy’s jaw, turns his face so that Malfoy has no choice but to look. “This is important to me, Malfoy.”
“Fine.” Draco had given his tie one last tug. Walking up to Harry, he’d slid a hand around Harry’s chin, lifting his head up for a possessive kiss. “Let’s go have dinner.”
Malfoy is standing by a window, his back turned to Harry. The window is cracked open an inch, and Harry notes the smell of cigarette, the red burning tip of it dangling from Malfoy’s fingers. It turns incandescent when Malfoy brings it to his lips and inhales.

“Don’t listen to her, mate,” Ron tells Draco. He’s got a mouthful of green beans and doesn’t seem to notice Narcissa’s slight scowl. “Anything to get you to say yes. She’s talked my ears off about this project.”
That’s the logo.”
Now that I’m an adult, I have no excuse not to do as I please, and perhaps going to the theatre would be one of those things I’d be into if only I had gotten into the habit at a younger age. As it is, it’s not something I ever think about. I never think about going to see a play as an option for a fun night out. I never even know what’s playing at the West End.
Because…. Well, it’s only been a week, but Harry knows that Draco has nothing to hide. He feels it in his bones. He knows the Ministry has identified Draco as a suspect — and wouldn’t it be nice if he was, Harry thinks ruefully. What a nice pack of Galleons the Ministry could confiscate to add some extra padding to its vaults — and from an ex Death Eater, no less. But Harry also has enough experience in the field to trust his instincts. And his instincts are screaming to him that the Ministry is wasting everyone’s time with this case.
“The Ministry sent me.” The words fall from his mouth, inexorable. Draco stills, eyes fixed on him, and it’s too late to take it back. “I don’t work for the Ministry… not really. I’m hired as an external consultant.”
“Good evening, gentlemen,” she gestured at the two seats across from her. Two tea cups popped on the desk in front of them, wafting the smoky scent of Lapsang Souchong towards them. “I daresay you know why I have called you in tonight?”
“Oh, for sure. But aren’t there things that you would
“Is it something we’re supposed to learn in books like
Harry’s booted foot sank in a frozen puddle, and he cursed under his breath. The cold was starting to seep through the stitching of the leather
“Harry,” Draco whispered. “What on earth—? Why on earth—?
Draco had taken Harry’s wrist and guided his hand between his legs, all the while watching Harry with eyes dark with lust, and Harry had let him. He’d known, instinctively, to let Draco take charge of it. Draco had spread his legs further, fingers on Harry’s pulse point, until the tip of Harry’s middle finger had grazed the slicked skin of his rim. He’d taken a hissing inhale, and Harry had pressed inside, feeling Draco flutter and open around him.
“And…?”
Draco’s head snaps up. Harry can tell he’s trying to school his features into his usual prickly sneer and failing miserably.
“Draco...” Harry tapped his fingers to his lips, his eyes wide and full of mirth. “It was. It was a truly terrible thing. We just defiled our dear friend’s kitchen.”
The memory is always with him, lancing and bittersweet. He goes to a few fundraisers and galas, hoping to find Malfoy picking the pockets of champagne-drinking crowds or stealing wallets from unsupervised cloakrooms. He returns empty-handed from his search every time. Event after Malfoy-less event, Harry’s already-low enthusiasm wanes, so much that Ron and Hermione notice.
How does that sound?

Harry can't argue that fact. “I am. I’m a
of snow unlike anything Harry had ever experienced, even in the coldest months of his Hogwarts years. He felt a hand close around his shoulder and Malfoy pushed him inside, slamming the door shut behind them.
Harry clutches his chest and deadpans. “Wow, thank you. What a heartwarming compliment.”
Draco puts his hands to Harry’s chest, ready to push him back. He doesn’t, though. “Because you said I’m your friend?”
“So, Mr Potter,” continues Mr Peterson, unaware of Ron’s distress, “which breed of Acromantula do you have a soft spot for? You probably have a favourite, we all do!”
Someone clears their throat in the doorway, and all heads snap to Ernestina, her hands crossed in front of her neatly pressed pink blouse.
He’s playing a classical piano piece that sounds vaguely familiar… It’s soft, sad, and hauntingly tender. Melancholy in a way that shuts the air inside Harry’s lungs, keeps his next exhale trapped in his throat.
He could do this. He could be friendly and fun. Couldn’t he?
But being naked together with Malfoy’s fingers up his arse and Malfoy’s hard prick sliding against his own was decidedly

it, though, so he pushed him back with a kick of his elbow. “Gerroff me, Malfoy!”
“You said you trusted that I was innocent,” Draco says, quiet. Wounded.

Malfoy laughs, low and tremulous. “If you don’t get your cock in me right this minute, Potter, I might kill you. Hold it in your hand.” Harry takes his cock, then pulls Malfoy’s arse cheeks apart with his other hand, breath quickening at the sigh of Malfoy’s lube-shiny, quivering hole. “Yes,” Malfoy encourages him, “that’s it, Harry. Now, push it gently in…” Malfoy’s voice catches as Harry presses the tip of his cock in, his left thumb still holding him open. Harry wishes he could see Malfoy’s face in this moment, though he understands that Malfoy picked a position that would be easier for Harry’s first time. Malfoy pushes back an inch, and Harry’s thoughts snap to the here and now. “Fuck, Potter,” he says, panting slightly, “even the head of your cock is big. Now, keep pushing in slooowly…” Malfoy’s word fades in a long, guttural moan as Harry thrusts in carefully. He’s not sure if the instruction to go slow is for Malfoy’s benefit, or purely for his pleasure, but it doesn’t matter. There’s a moment where he doesn’t think Malfoy will take him any deeper, but then Malfoy’s body yields to him with a soft gasp, and Harry slides in all the way through. He watches, fascinated, as the length of his cock disappears inside Malfoy’s arse, the way Malfoy stretches around Harry’s girth. Taking him in. Letting him share his body. And when Harry’s sheathed to the hilt, he places both hands on Malfoy’s hips and slowly pulls back.
“Thank you, Pans,” he whispered.
It might be the weekend, but Harry's still supposed to be presentable. It won’t do to be late just because he can’t keep his prick in check.
His gaze followed Harry on the rink, his winter cloak billowing behind him as he effortlessly sprinted Dean Thomas across the ice. Weasley, Granger and Finnigan were cheering and skating along. They all looked like normal teenagers enjoying an afternoon off school, their faces flushed and unworried as though none of them had lived through loss and destruction. Envy burned in Draco’s throat. It would never be like this for him, would it? He would never have this easy camaraderie, this uncomplicated bond with Harry. Easy and uncomplicated simply wasn’t Draco’s style.
She lifted an eyebrow. Her thoughts on such childish behaviour were plainly written on the disapproving frown on her face.
Except in that issue, unlike the one where Hermione was on the cover, they added a question mark next to the title,

“It would be that I—I’m not so much into girls either.”
“But...”
Neville threw himself between Pansy and the snowman with a look of playful disbelief. “Not fitter than me, love?”
“Are you actually invited to this thing?” he asks, voice low.
“Sorry to ruin the best line of your dramatic villain monologue, Smith,” Harry says, protectively pushing Scorpius behind him as he does. The Aurors round on him, their wand hands twitching when they realise who he is. “But this is the opposite of abandoning ship. What the

Hermione beams at him. “And when I read that Draco’s company had started training its research teams in Muggle medicine and pharmacology… I just had to talk to him. Imagine putting the Unspeakables magical knowledge and Caduceus’ expertise into developing the future of wizarding and Muggle cures!”

“Uh oh,” she says.
“All right. You win, Potter.”
Malfoy is standing in the doorway. How long has he been listening, Harry doesn’t know. They look into each other’s eyes for a long moment, and Harry is about to say something, to explain.
Draco lifts his head abruptly. His eyes are harsh, piercing.
“Who asked you to make amends, Potter?” Draco’s eyes flash, and he takes a step closer, teeth clenched. “Listen to me.

The knock at the door is heavy but hesitant, and Draco looks up from the stacks of papers on his desk.
, their table was a perfectly safe, quiet corner.
“Yes, yes, we did fuck a lot, Malfoy,” Harry rolled his eyes to mask his embarrassment—and the utterly unprofessional fact that, deep down, he’d rather spend another 24 hours stuck here with Malfoy than resume their investigation. “Yes, you ran to the bathroom and cleaned up right after

kind of money. The Malfoy vaults were entirely confiscated after their trials, along with the rest of their properties. Even the Manor was taken once Narcissa and Draco Malfoy finished their three-year house arrest. There was only a small vault left that guaranteed just enough income for Narcissa and her son to live for a few years until they both put their lives back together. Draco Malfoy should have had nothing to start a business with, let alone three million Galleons.”
Harry regards him, catching his breath, his expression softening.
“It’s Harry.”Harry stands still, careful to keep his tone neutral. He pats his pocket once more and closes his jacket over it, just to be safe.
Half past eleven, three days after St Mungo’s, was the time slot Jemima has suggested per Draco’s request, based on his work schedule and Scorpius’ recovering sleep cycles. It was supposed to give Draco enough time to go on his morning run, give him one last opportunity to work out his feelings before meeting with Harry again.
“Sure. Yes. Thanks.”
“I wouldn’t count him as a

He never realised the way he approached sex wasn’t the way most of his classmates did, perhaps because, unlike his classmates, he
“Thank you. I wish I could say it was my idea, but I’ve read about it in a book. Mind you, it was a footnote, but—”
“Wait, so you’re not going to tell me who you saw here?” Harry tries, but the Petersons come back with another couple in tow, and Hermione’s eyes light up like it’s Christmas.
-Ron Weasley
“You’re right, Potter. Becoming a high-class thief wasn’t my childhood dream. I secretly wanted to be an Auror. The operative word being ‘secretly.’ My father would have gagged on his neckerchief had he known.”
Harry lifts his head up, panting. He wipes the back of his hand across his mouth, throat working. His face is red and shiny. There’s something thrilling in his eyes — feral yet contained — and Draco reaches for his hand, pulls.

“What I was saying, gentlemen,” Smith was droning on, “is that the families are grateful for your work on this case. There will be a ceremony to celebrate the safe return of magic and Muggle fugitives alike. Of course, the ones who wish to remain in the caves of Ben MacDui will be able to do so, as long as they reside there in safer conditions than they previously did. Authorities will know to check in on them regularly and make sure they have provisions and water, at the very least. And all concealing magic that exists around the various entrances to the mountain, such as the one you’ve discovered in the refuge, will be cleared by our best team of Curse-Breakers.”
“It’s fine, Malfoy,” Harry says, waving a placatory hand at Malfoy. Malfoy shrugs.

all the time.) (An auspicious breakfast. An auspicious smile. An auspicious piano practice. An auspicious walk with Balzac.) I wonder why he’d say that. He was always so happy when Harry was around, from the beginning. He smiled a lot. I don't remember him smiling so much before. (Except in the photograph). Once (last year), before Harry came to work for us, I asked him if it was different when Mummy was alive. His face did a weird twisty thing, like Nestine’s does when she tries not to cry in front of me. He told me it was different. But it didn't matter, because he was happy and good with the way things were now, too.
“Oh,” Malfoy just says.
Like he’s taking action.
“Least of all with Draco Malfoy, huh?”
“Make me come first,” Draco says, and now he sounds like he’s begging too, “Please.
“Your girlfriend’s words, Weasley, not mine,” Draco deadpanned.
Not like so many elves working in wizarding families all over Britain. And even then… By law, she’s not allowed to make money out of anything not related to house-keeping. If the Ministry found out about Nesting, about the profits it still makes… She could be arrested for it.”
“Gentlemen, I apologise for keeping you overtime when you’re obviously in need of a rest. I’d like to give you the next three days off as a thank you—and as an opportunity for you to catch up on much needed sleep.”
“Tell you what?”
“I’m a grown man, and this is ridiculous.”
I can’t help it when you’re sitting here looking all proper and professional, with your glasses and your notes and your rugged good looks.
Okay…
Harry stumbles inside beside him, bewildered but laughing along. It’s one of those rare evenings when Draco’d chosen not to work and instead let Ernestina watch Scorpius. He and Harry had gone to the pub together. It wasn’t anything anyone would ever consider exciting, but it’s not like Draco’d ever made a habit of it before Harry. After all, he was a single father and, in the words of Harry, grinning and poking his side,
Easy for Hermione to say. She and Ron had been together for ten years, and happily married for three. They had brilliant careers at the Ministry. They were well-adjusted, functional adults. Getting to that point after everything they’d been through seemed like an impossible feat to Harry. Because Harry… well, Harry was nothing of the sort. He had a brilliant career, all right.
Regards,
Draco froze when he looked down at what Harry was pointing at. Jeff was wearing something indeed. A large emerald-and-Goblin-silver ring, its former engraved ‘M’ polished away, was dangling from his neck by a red ribbon—one of the ribbons that the Eighth Years had tied and used to hang baubles on the Christmas tree. Caught, the Niffler grimaced apologetically at Draco.
“Like that, do you?” he whispers against Harry’s neck, nipping at his earlobe. Harry nods frantically into his shoulder.
“Piss off,” Malfoy says, but his ears are pink, and Harry feels bold enough to push him.
When they were fully dressed, albeit in clothes that wouldn’t pass the high standards of Auror uniforms for cleanliness if they were to be inspected, they approached the trapdoor again. Harry moved to pull the handle.
He sets the quill in its case just as he hears movement in the cupboard. He puts a hand on his desk, lets the cool glass steady him. Then he looks up, and finds Harry on the threshold of the room, standing still, watching Draco.
“It's like a toy shop exploded in here,” Harry muses, looking around as he steps over an overthrown box of puzzle pieces and avoids losing balance, his left arm still held tight against his chest with a splint.
“Thanks,” Draco said.
Harry’s gaze met his across the pitch, and he smiled, brightly, openly, a smile that Draco knew was meant just for him.
“Yes,” he murmured, his gaze wandering out the window to the snow-white back garden. “Even me.”
Everybody freezes.
So it must be something that had happened after that. They’d been talking, and Harry had been all relaxed and sleepy. He’d said something, hadn’t he? And then Malfoy’s tone had shifted to cold, distant, and he’d turned away from Harry…
“Yes, you gorgeous prick.” Harry squeezed, relishing the drip of precome that rewarded him. “Yes.”
“I didn’t realise we were supposed to
He cleared his throat.
That’s when Harry sees it.
“Harry?” Hermione calls from the top of the stairs.
“Nice of you to give my queerness your blessing, oh Chosen One,” Draco deadpans, but his heart isn't in it. Potter ignores his jab and takes a step in his direction. Draco leans more heavily against the door.
And also… undeniably fitting.
He pulled it out with an soft
Potter. That Quidditch game could turn out humiliating in more ways than one…
“Like a portable Wireless with a Privacy charm,” Draco mused.
Draco put his face in his hands. “Oh, for Hell’s sake.”
“The showers…” Malfoy mused. “Nice.”
Abashed, Draco thought of the abundant fun he’d made of Neville Longbottom precisely for his love of Herbology, a subject matter his younger self didn’t deem worthy of his time and ambition.
live. I need to survive. Don’t you know it’s tough out there? Life’s a bitch and then you die. Well,” Malfoy adds after a pause, “most of us do, anyway.”
It’s nearly half past eleven now, judging by the hands on the grandfather clock in Draco’s study. It’s raining in earnest outside, the fresh, bracing scent of wet vegetation drifting inside. Harry closes the doors to the garden before puddles start forming on the hardwood floors.
“Got her, chief,” the Auror announces brightly. He takes in the state of the study before muttering: “She was almost feistier than her boss.”
“The secret to a successful ‘snap’,” Draco speaks up, spinning around slowly as his colleagues stop to listen once again, “is to maintain the advantage a pretty ‘bend’ will give to your bum. When you bend, you push your arse up and out — make sure it stays slightly out when you snap back up. Like this— “ Draco bends again, denim-clad arse in the air, and, just when the door bursts open, lifts back up in a sharp move, hips to the side, arse popped back, jeans tight across his rear—
“It’s not the same because we were the bad guys, weren’t we? We
Harry leaned back. “You're awfully concerned about this. You know we can take time to figure things out, even change our minds as we go along, right? Nothing is going to actually happen to us if we don’t pick one professional path now and stick to it forever.”
(willingness) and
The lift doors ding open on the top floor. Draco pushes off Harry with a goofy grin. He does a little bow.
The Auror turns his wand on the dog with a yelp and fires a loud,
“You are. You’re the best man, Draco—”
“Good morning, darling.”
“I don’t need apologies from you. I’m well over it.”
promised.”
but I’m the one conducting this interview. So tell me, Potter. What’s in it for you? Why would
The thought is terrifying, but not as much as waiting for the ballet to end, for the lights to come back on, for Harry to walk back home, bleary-eyed and hopelessly alone.
“...get something for him.”
“Oh, so I’m not a despicable prick?”
he thinks —
Harry craves Draco like he’s never craved anyone else, and they’re not even together. They’re so far from being anything close to
“Ladies, I despair of your manners. What do we say to knocking on doors before barging in?”
Dear Granger,
his mind provides, unhelpfully, as Harry locks eyes with Draco.
Harry moaned, instinctively canting his hips to give Malfoy better access.
“Of course, Mistor!”
“Mate, I don’t mind what you do,” Ron laughed and lifted his hands, leaning away from him. Draco smirked. “You do whatever you want as long as you keep Harry happy and his heart in one piece.”
it. Demons’ flair for the dramatic got tedious after a while. Yet the tree was a part of him, almost comforting. He approached it carefully. He laid his hand on the gnarled trunk. The rough bark was warm. Draco had often wondered if it was blood, not sap, that was coursing underneath it. He waited another quiet moment, the sound of his breathing his only company. He wished he could be back in the Library, pretending to study for his Potions homework like the rest of his Eighth year classmates on a normal Tuesday night of December. He liked sitting next to his friends, listening to the comforting scratching of quill on parchment. He liked the chance to feel Harry’s gaze on him—Harry, who kept meeting Draco’s gaze across rooms and smiling at him. Since they’d returned for their Eighth Year, he didn’t even bother being surreptitious about it.
Draco shifted on his feet. Being in the same room as Harry reawakened the silent yearning he’d felt for years. If he remained in this room any longer, it might stay with him indefinitely, an indelible longing he’d have to carry around in his chest forever.
Draco rolled his eyes. “Harry, one thing I’ve noticed over the years, besides your disastrous hairstyle, is how utterly useless you are at Potions. It’s almost as though you’re
-Millie
and Draco stops, hands fisted in his shirt, panting lightly. He looks at Harry, eyes suddenly wide — then lets go of him and takes a step back. “Merlin,” he says, rubbing his jaw. “Sorry. I don’t know what got into me. I’m — out of line, sorry—”
“One hardly needs to change when one is already perfect, does one?”
They both stood hurriedly, their eyes trained on the trapdoor as if it could disappear if they so much as blinked.
Malfoy’s fingers still felt amazing inside his slightly sore hole, and Harry didn’t overthink it. Hoping to give Malfoy better access, to allow his fingers in deeper, he rolled on his stomach—and froze.
Harry and I sorted our issues.”
It would be insincere of me to tell you I didn’t expect
Draco knew he’d always remain a little bit in love with both of them, and that was fine, too. Potter was seared in his brain back then, and there was nothing he could do.
Harry seemed to snap out of it, too.
Draco shook his head. Twisting his wrist, holding Harry’s chin more firmly, he forced Harry to make eye contact with him.
demon,
Harry thinks it’s ironic that Draco Malfoy, of all people, would call Harry out on privilege and the difficulties of life. But then again, he has to admit that their situations got flipped on their heads by the end of the war. Although Harry can hardly resent that, he still feels a twinge of sympathy for Malfoy.
Draco laughed. “I know you’re technically right, Potter. Yet I can’t help but feel like I
Draco clenched his fists in frustration. “Why did you?” He rose to his full height. “Don’t you see? This isn’t about

“Is it a fucking competition? All the choices I’ve made in my life… I turned them on their head for you.”
to think about Potter, really. Potter is literally with him everywhere he goes; even if he
“Oh, cut the crap,” Harry rolled his eyes. “I know for a fact that you don’t suffer from a lack of suitors, Draco.”
Harry pushed open the door to their Hogsmeade cottage and scanned around. Draco followed suit, looking around the living room suspiciously, eyes still narrow slits.
There’s a second of hesitation in Malfoy’s eyes, but his expression sets to neutral too fast for Harry to read into it. He backs away, hands lifted in apology, a rueful smile on his kiss-pinked lips. “The pleasure’s all mine, Potter. You don’t owe me anything.”
Harry drops back against the pillows, weak with exhaustion and relief. “Thank God.”
Draco had been less talkative with Hermione. He’d given her the big picture — arrested by the Aurors, Hermione’s lawyer friend sitting with him during the interrogation, the slight change of plans in the face of unexpected events — but hadn’t got into details. He couldn’t say it. He couldn’t talk about Ernestina’s bruised face, about Balzac lying in an unconscious heap on the floor, about Scorpius’ screams, about Harry’s desperate eyes and his last second Protego that had shielded Draco’s son from further harm once again. Not with the DMLE as his witnesses.
That’s the trouble with Harry. That’s been the trouble since the beginning: he doesn’t look like someone who could be
Matilda Vance, formerly known as Matthew (Penelope had bought the biggest champagne bottle she could find when the Ministry had finally let Matilda change her name).
It’s been three weeks, and Harry still gets distracted by hot flashes of memories. Malfoy sinking to his knees. Malfoy’s lips stretched around the girth of Harry’s cock. His vibrating moans as Harry fucked his mouth. The mounting, overwhelming, mind-blowing pleasure that had blotted out the world around Harry.
Draco leans back in his chair and shakes his fringe out of his eyes, arms crossed and rings shining against his white shirt, which is still unbuttoned at the neck. He returns Harry’s disconcerting stare, defiant, challenging. Let Potter think of him whatever he pleases.
“I'm not that much into girls.”
Harry’s expression softens some more. “I mean it, Draco.”
Harry folds his arms over his chest. He’s said no already. He wishes he could be as convinced as he sounded a minute ago. He glances down at his folded arms, his right hand resting on top. After all these years, the scar remains stark and white against his olive skin.
He looks like… he’s glowing.
Mr Potter,” Pansy drawls, her dark eyes flicking up and down Harry’s body. He’s worn dress trousers and a crisp white shirt for the occasion. He supposes Pansy’s sharp fashion sense approves of his outfit, if the appreciative tilt of her head is anything to go by. There is no trace of contrition in her tone or posture. It’s as if her last words in Harry’s presence hadn’t been to hand him over to Voldemort. She holds out a red-nailed hand. “Delighted to meet you again. And for our dear Draco’s birthday, no less.”
Harry feels like someone has lit a Lumos in his chest.
These first days breeze by, busy with learning to think of Draco as a real person rather than an abstract concept. Malfoy has been a distant memory for so long. As much as his presence used to drive Harry off the wall back at Hogwarts, Draco’s nastiness had quickly faded away in the face of Voldemort’s pure evil. Then… he’d covered for Harry at the Manor, a pivotal moment of truth — grey eyes, defeated and scared, boring into Harry's — and Harry had altogether stopped thinking of Draco as a thorn in his side.
Harry stands there, dumbstruck, as Malfoy rummages into the pockets of someone else’s coat. Harry watches as Malfoy pulls his closed fist out of the pocket, checks the contents of his palm, and with the swift sureness of a job well done, transfers them into his own pocket and moves on to the next coat on the rack.
for telling me, but... I think I knew.”
I have one last question.
“Of course,” Harry said, looking up as Draco slid in the seat next to him. The atmosphere in Slughorn’s classroom was already stuffy and overheated. The air smelled of candied fruit and hot chocolate. It wasn’t a bad smell in itself—it’s just that it fit Madam Puddifoot’s tea parlor better than it did a Potions classroom. Draco located the source of the smell after one quick scan of the room: small cups of steaming hot chocolate, two on each table, were waiting for them. Inside, marshmallows charmed to look like snowmen floated on the dark liquid. All that was missing to turn the room into a Hufflepuff winter wonderland was merry carols chiming in the background. The empty portrait on the wall behind Slughorn’s desk was proof enough: Severus Snape disapproved so much he refused to visit his own portrait, likely preferring to dwell in the one hanging in McGonagall’s office.
“Yes, Harry, yes,” Malfoy was mumbling against the side of his neck, “I can feel you, oh, you’re going to feel so tight around my cock, I—”
he spits, and Harry’s blood goes cold. “You won’t even tell me what you’ve been up to the last few days, when you were no doubt sucking up to your dear Minister and his auditor cronies.” He shakes his head, the same disparaging half smile on his face. “Don’t forget
Draco had ended up telling the Aurors the truth, eventually. All these days spent strategising with Harry and Hermione, and it had all come down to this. Burst in, shake Draco’s world upside down, and watch all of Draco’s secrets spill out.
Harry took a step back. Sentimental was good… wasn’t it?
“Really?” The tiny flicker in Harry’s eyes was gone, elusive like a Snitch, and Draco felt heat flare in his gut. He took a step closer, moving into Harry’s space. “Why is that, Harry? Why don’t you give a shite? Why was it that I never heard from you after—” His hands were itching to grab Harry’s collar. He let out a shaky breath. “All you wanted back then was to get fucked, was that it? One night with me, no strings attached, just the thrill of getting defiled by me, of getting your arse plowed by dirty, tainted Draco Malfoy? I bet it felt good, Harry. I bet it felt
Malfoy’s voice wavers slightly and he swallows, brow creasing. “Have you never been with a man… before me?”
“You’d blackmail shady businessmen and reformed-not-reformed Death Eaters?”
Harry had no scientific meteorological knowledge, but his instinct rarely lied. And now his instinct was screaming at him to find a place to hide from the upcoming downpour, or face the risk of being turned into a very dead, very Harry-Potter-shaped icicle within minutes.
This was where Draco had sought refuge that year, when Snape's harsh support wasn’t enough to keep the nightmares at bay, when he was so scared to die that the mere thought of falling asleep gave him panic attacks: Pansy’s bed. She was so patient with him, and so was Blaise, his dark eyes glinting in the darkness of the closed drapes around Pansy’s four-poster bed. Pressed between the bodies of his lovers, Draco could forget about the rest of his life for a few moments. The cabinet that refused to be fixed; that room,
Harry narrowed his eyes back at his boyfriend. “Nope.”
“I thought truth was your
“I haven’t seen him come out since lunch…” Jemima’s golden earrings clink when she turns to check the security camera screens behind her desk. “... but it doesn’t look like he’s in there, either.”
He shakes his head at the anger flaring at the thought.
Draco’d flashed him a look, but had peered inside the bag nonetheless. He’d stopped still for a speechless moment, then pulled the old vinyl from inside.
him train day in and day out, I will be supremely unimpressed, Potter.”
“You’d make a very disappointing Bond villain,” Harry mutters.
“Are you allowed to say the F-word?” Harry looks at Scorpius in alarm. Draco’s son is about thirty feet away and there’s no way he could have heard Draco, but Harry doesn’t seem to care about technicalities such as sound-traveling distance and the fact that an autistic child absorbed in an activity will be deaf to the rest of the world. And it makes Draco want to lean in and hug Harry for it; he stops himself at the last moment, unsettled by the impulse.
Draco playfully pushed Harry and strode forward.
“I, er—might need your help,” Draco told her.
Ron nods. “Between ‘Mione working with Malfoy to save the world, and you falling for him… I suppose our suspicions were misplaced.” He gives Harry a little smile that doesn’t reach his eyes. “Our turn to be prejudiced pricks, eh?
Hermione," Harry says. “Very funny.” She snickers at his disgruntled expression but he hugs her anyway. “The birthday boy is already entertaining his other guests in his study. I was merely fetching you.”
Watching Draco — cool, collected, intimidatingly gorgeous Draco — respond to his touch was intoxicating.
So loved.
This interdepartmental memo is to inform you that—
“I bet you ten Galleons they’re talking about us,” Harry said. From where he was sitting on the rug, the nearby fire cast dark shadows over his bright green eyes and wicked smile. He looked like a Christmas present waiting to be unwrapped.
For a moment, Jeff looked as though pride was battling with greed inside his tiny head. Then, wringing his paws, he grimaced. “Yes! Yes, I do!”
They walk down the stairs. “The second floor is mine,” Malfoy continues. “The layout is fairly similar to your own quarters, except that this one has a guest room across the landing.” At Harry’s questioning look, Malfoy rolls his eyes, “My ‘guests’ are no one to worry about, Potter. More often than not, it’s just my mother visiting from France.”
painfully alternating between hopeful and hopeless. They only have the beginning of a solution, he and Draco — and Hermione, actually, as she jumped headfirst into their plans as soon as they gave her the opportunity. She often visited Caduceus’ laboratories these days; her and her small team of Unspeakables were there to evaluate the possibility that Caduceus premises could host the new branch of research Hermione and Draco had agreed on. A week before, as they were taking off their lab robes and goggles after a round of the labs, she’d snapped at Draco for being all jittery.
“Come on, Harry,” Ron pokes, his voice softer than before. “What do you say?”
to believe him. And now he has to choose whether to keep Harry around or not.
Draco glances at the grandfather clock tucked between two bookcases in a corner of his office. His eyes widen when he realises it’s almost quarter to ten.
“You–you
“Oh, Draco. Darling. If something really happened with Potter... you must be over the moon. You’ve wished for it for long enough.”
“Most house-elves in England are owned, sir,” she explains with a sigh. “But not where Ernestina comes from, no. Ernestina is an employee of Mistor Draco, sir, just like Mistor Potter.”
“I’ve wanted you for a long time,” he confesses, soft, almost to himself.
“What if I'm not?”
“And if you want to try, you can even look at my scar,” Harry says, pushing his hair away from his forehead. “I’ve this very cool scar, see? It’s close to my eyes.” Scorpius’s soft brown eyes lift to his forehead and Harry grins. “You can try it on me, and I’ll tell you if it works, yeah?” Scorpius nods, eyes trained on Harry’s lightning scar, and Harry adds, “But only if you want to. You don’t have to look at me at all, and I promise you it won’t bother me at all.”
career plans, if you’re as anxious as you say to get started.”
future.”
He stops. There’s only a foot of distance between them. When Draco releases the breath stuck in his lungs, it kicks back in quicker, faster, like he’s been running instead of standing there, watching Potter close the distance between them.
Draco turns to look at him.
Oh, I still stink, do I?
like a job, and every look, every word, every little change in Draco’s mercurial moods hits Harry in a very real, very personal manner. Maybe he’s overthinking this. Maybe he’s just on edge after reading Kingsley’s and Ron’s notes. Maybe he feels like he’s failing them — he’s failing
“Well. I suppose we ought to get going as well,” he says. Then, flashing a smile at Draco and Harry, “Best leave Draco alone with his new conquest.”
Harry shrugs. “Your words, not mine.”
“Oh please, Blaise, tell us again about how you’re spending Christmas on the
“Yes.”
“That’s Slytherin versus Gryffindor for you.” Ron shrugs. “I know which one I like best.”
“Yeah. My own place never feels this... warm.”
“I think—” Potter lifts his hand, reaches for Draco’s face. He hesitates. Asks, “Can I?” Draco gives a minute nod. Harry slides his fingers in Draco’s fringe, tucks his hair behind his ear. Draco stands motionless, breathless, as Potter’s thumb lingers on the ring at the top of his ear, stills on his cheekbone.
The folder contains several pages covered with columns of numbers. Financial statements, Harry guesses. Corporate information about a potions company whose name vaguely rings a bell. Everywhere the same ominous logo: a silver snake wrapped around a wand shooting sparks. Everywhere the same tagline in silver-lettered, pretentious Latin.

In size and location, Ernestina’s room is the same as the guest room above. Other than that, it has nothing of the blank, hotel-like quality of its second-floor counterpart. It can only be described as… well, a
He took a step back. “I don’t know if you show up at your friends’ when I’m interviewing them by coincidence or to keep an eye on me, because Merlin forbid I’ve become trustworthy. I don’t know if you’re here to rile me up, or to tease me endlessly with something I’ll never have.”
“Well, here’s the thing, Malfoy.” Harry met his eye. His were simmering with anger, and something pained and weary that Draco couldn’t place. “You’re right when you say this isn’t about you. This is, however, about
So he said: “Yes. I know. I’m deeply ashamed of the way I behaved toward you and your friends in the past. I think I’ve made it clear to you multiple times. But I realise I’ve never properly apologised to Granger, Weasley, Longbottom and so many other of my classmates. I'll make a point to do it next time the occasion arises.” He gave Harry a rueful glance. “I’m really not the best person, as you may know, Harry.”
Draco had sighed. “Precisely.”
“Yeah,” Harry says. “It’s not just the house preventing me from doing my job, no matter what you say, Hermione. I’ve had this gut feeling about Draco since I started on the case. And the fact that I’ve—” He swallows, slides his eyes away. He knows he’s blushing. “—that I’ve fallen for him doesn’t change that.”
Yours,
With one last pat on Harry’s arm, Narcissa left the room. Harry turned to Draco with a bright, cocky smile. Draco hid his face in his hands and peered at him from between his fingers.
“You’re still doing the interviews, I see.”
he’d said flatly.
“Alright,” he said with his usual reckless Gryffindor self-assurance.
Split up with my girlfriend from school (are we going to pretend you don’t know who we’re talking about? I just—
Drao gives him an incredulous look.“The company is under Ernestina’s name, for one. If I talk about it, she gets arrested. And secondly… I’m supposed to be a Potions master, remember? I’m supposed to represent Caduceus. I’m not… supposed to be the person who helped to create a cute, gadget-y pushchair that started a long-lasting fad. It’s a matter of company image for Caduceus… and I’ve worked
“What did you do to these people?” Harry demands, jerking his chin towards the seated guests.
“If you want to join us,” Malfoy speaks, at length, “tea’s ready. And…” He hesitates, just a fraction of a second. Harry sees the moment he changes his mind in his eyes. “...you’re welcome to it.”
“Glad you like it,” Malfoy answers from behind him.
“Indeed I did, Draco, but first—” He raised a hand and recited: “All hail Lucifer, the Adversary, Destroyer of Kings, Angel of the Bottomless Pit, Prince of The World, Father of Lies, Spawn of Satan, and Lord of Darkness.”
“They won’t find out from me, Potter.”
Malfoy’s eyes flew open.
he told me.
With his eyes closed, all Draco can do is feel. He holds Harry’s face between his hands and kisses him, fiercely. He kisses him open-mouthed and hungry, the slide of Harry’s lips opening under his like a lightning bolt down his spine. He licks the inside of Harry’s bottom lip, holds his tongue there, waits.
And maybe Draco’s right, and that’s exactly what Harry is. But he undresses Draco still, his hands slow, deliberate, reverent, until Draco is shivering, naked across the sheets. And maybe Draco won’t allow him to say it with words, but Harry will make love to him all the same. Trailing kisses down his neck, down his chest, his hot breath lingering over each of Draco’s scars. Feeling Draco’s body arch into him in a wordless
Harry staggers back, and all the words leave him. All the fight. He stares at Draco, and Draco stares back, chest rising and falling, the glimmering lights of the London night highlighting the dramatic planes of his face. Harry wants to hurt him — the way Draco can’t seem to stop hurting him, by holding back, by keeping his feelings so close to his chest, when Harry’s love for him only wants to spill and spill.
he reminds himself.
Harry fusses with the kettle and mugs while Hermione takes a seat at the table, pulls Hugo out of his pushchair and just folds the thing in two clicks and a pull of her hand. Harry whistles.
The protective wards chime as they yield and let Harry pass.
were going to conduct my interview, I said yes.”
Harry stares at it for a long moment, unable to tear his eyes away.
Draco had looked down at the album cover with a crooked smile. The blush on his cheekbones was all the validation Harry’d needed.  “And it’s
The shower Harry takes does nothing to remove the nagging presence of Draco in his mind — images of him, exquisitely dishevelled, eyes rolling back as he rode Harry’s cock in a slow, teasing rhythm; his long fingers smearing his own come across his lean, scarred belly. Harry considers having a wank right then and there, but in the end cuts that train of thought short with a spray of freezing water and a quick shaving charm to his face.
“What the
He had expected to burst into flames. To explode. To evaporate in a mist of purple smoke. To die, whatever form death could take for a demon.
it. We were—
Harry latched his lips to the side of Malfoy’s neck and pushed Malfoy’s trousers and pants down in a gesture that left no room for interpretation. He felt Malfoy wiggle his clothes as far down his legs as he could, and then Harry’s cock slipped between his bare thighs.
“Then I’d better go,” Draco said.
and it’d been a long time since Harry had done this—and finally, finally, when Harry thought he never would, Malfoy bottomed out inside him.
Hermione had once remarked when Harry had confessed these events bored him to death.
“So we’re agreed, then?” Jeff said, holding out a paw in Draco’s direction. “You agree to my terms, and I agree to yours?”
Harry looks from one friend’s concerned, expectant face to the other. His shoulders slump. “Yes.”
Draco stared at Harry with his mouth open. For all their talk about personality tests, he had not seen this coming.
I already know everyone who’s going to be at that reunion. I was their classmate for seven years! If mysterious sex forces had destined me to fuck one of them, wouldn’t that have happened ten years ago?”
“Hope is a foolish thing to cling to in times of war, isn’t it? I soon realised it was eating me alive. More than the fear. More than the curses. More than the torture and the pain I was made to inflict and witness.
“It's old Wizarding English
“I don’t fucking know, okay? It just — it’s an important part of you, and I wish I’d known about it before I touched you.”
Harry opens his mouth to speak, but Narcissa raises a pale, long-fingered hand and continues as if he hadn’t moved. “I love my son more than anything and anyone in this world. You, of all people, know how much. We are both intelligent adults. I suppose I don’t need to specify all the ways I could make the Dark Lord’s curses feel like a sweet summer breeze to you if you ever hurt Draco.”
“That makes two of us,” Harry said, running his thumb across Malfoy’s wet lips. “Gits like you shouldn’t be allowed to be this hot.”
“My bitterness? I’m not bitter. You’re the one who’s begging for attention. I thought you got more of that than any human alive, but I was wrong, apparently.”
“Yes, I can see that, thank you,” Draco hissed.
Draco’d stalked away, shaking his head and smiling, only stopping before he’d reached the threshold. He’d turned to study Harry, an impish glint in his eyes.
Pushing thoughts of Malfoy’s
All the people Draco is supposed to be are mixed and jumbled in Harry’s head, and he can’t tell which one he’s supposed to hate and which one he’s supposed to like anymore.
“It’s not my place to tell, Mrs Malfoy. Draco is the most likely to give you an objective evaluation of my performance.”
“When we were expecting Scorpius…” Malfoy lets his eyes fall away from Harry’s. “It changes things, knowing you’re going to have a child. It changes your perspective. I apologise if it sounds awfully cliché. You realise things are not going to be about you anymore. That’s how Astoria and I felt. Even after living in Paris for years, we still felt very English. We wanted to raise our child in our home country. And… I don’t know. Having a child brought back all sorts of values I didn’t know I cared about anymore. I wanted to be real, for him. No more hiding behind the seemingly enchanted life I had built, away from my roots, away from who I really was.”
“Pay up the ten Galleons, love.”
“Not often. Not every day.”
There’s something… careful in Malfoy’s tone. Harry doesn’t know what to say to that.
There had been a heavy emotional moment when they’d all sat around the table. The unfamiliar configuration of Tonkses, Malfoys and Potters emphasized the absence of family members—husbands, daughters, fathers—from all sides. It had hit Draco more bluntly than ever before: for all that he’d loved this life more than all the others, the people around the table were
Ernestina’s face falls a bit. There’s something flinty gleaming under her steady gaze.
He lifts the heavy door knocker — a golden snake, for fuck’s sake, and he rolls his eyes at the cliché — then he steps back and waits. A few seconds go by, and he’s about to knock again when the door creaks open as though of its own accord.
“That’s what I thought,” Draco smirked. “Come on, Potter, don’t stand there gaping like a Flobberworm. It’s really not very attractive, and I might reconsider. We wouldn’t want that, would we?”
“Fuck,” Malfoy gasps in his arms. “God, that was
I don’t know, Ron. If he hasn’t realised yet, it seems cruel.
Potter is rooted to the spot, his red Auror robes still swishing around him. His jaw is slack and his throat is working — and his eyes. His eyes are fixed on Draco’s arse.
Draco recovers from his obvious shock in an instant, standing straight and brushing a crease on his t-shirt as he walks into the dining room.
he had, the annoying swot. But Malfoy’s exceptionally early graduation had been brought on by a specific achievement. He had invented Juvence, a medical potion that subtly slowed signs of aging. Many a witch and wizard had tried to create anti-aging potions, always with limited, if not disastrous outcomes. Malfoy's potion was both a feat of inventiveness and skill. It was also a tremendous commercial hit. Juvence was the first product launched by Caduceus Corporation. According to the reports provided by Zacharias Smith’s team, Juvence remained the company’s bestseller and primary cash-cow years later.
Draco bursts out laughing. “Fuck off, Potter. You’ve spent too much time listening to Ministry gossip about me.”
“Well. I was
Needless to say, he felt rather safe as to the latter. In his first ninety nine lives, he’d never loved anyone and no one had loved him in return. In the hundredth, the loveless status quo, sadly, remained. If Draco had recently started feeling something that wasn’t rage or frustration for a certain Gryffindor prat... well, no one needed to know.
If he was perfectly honest, Harry had been just a tiny bit thrilled when Head Auror Smith had announced their assignment. A chance to stealthily stare at his ex-nemesis-turned-reluctant-Auror-partner’s fit body might not present itself for another five years, so he took it.
Malfoy fidgets as he settles into his seat. Harry chances a glance at him. He’s watching the ballet, hands in his lap. He’s wearing a smart, well-cut Muggle suit, the jacket open over a crisp white shirt. Malfoy forgot to button the top, and the collar is open and loose, revealing the dip of Malfoy’s throat, a hint of collarbone. Harry’s never seen anything as appealing.
He exhales in an attempt to relax. His leg is jiggling and he makes a conscious effort to keep still, his fingers clasped tightly in his lap. God, he’s nervous. This is a first for him. He hasn’t felt nervous at the start of a job since his first case for the Ministry, when he’d wiretapped a Floo network connected to Death Eaters’ safehouses. Back then, he was barely a few months over twenty one.
Still smiling, Harry put his chin in his hand, elbow resting on the back of the sofa. Draco meticulously placed his books on the floor next to the sofa, wondering if somewhere in Harry's open, friendly attitude, there was a cue for him to leave. He came up short. Harry was giving no indication of wanting to be alone, so Draco stayed there, hands clasped in his lap, watching the fire. his mind was frantically wiring for something to say, for something to justify his presence here, so late at night.
Everything goes very quiet, except for the loud rush of Harry’s heart in his ears. Malfoy’s gone very still, Harry’s hips pinning him in place against the table. He seems to have stopped breathing altogether.
“Oh, we didn’t. We became close during his last year there. Then he graduated and left to pursue an Herbology scholarship in Sao Paulo. We met again, years later, when I managed to locate the last
“Don’t!” Jeff lifted his paws in supplication. “You’re right, he doesn’t know I’m here. I just... wanted to take a look at this 13th century marvel of a ring, that’s all. What Mephisto doesn’t know can’t hurt me, I mean
“What project?” Pansy asks.
Behind him, he can hear Draco tidying the mess they’ve made. He sounds distracted when he asks, “What?”
“When Harry started working here…" Hermione hesitates, then says, "I read more on Caduceus’ activities. Until then, I mainly knew Draco’s company for its biggest hit, shall we say...”
“An astute observation, Malfoy.”
“We can walk around a bit more if you’d like.”
“I never said— ‘experiment,’” Harry manages through clenched teeth. Jesus, what if he comes from this — just from Malfoy’s hand on his cock — and then Malfoy leaves, and the night is over? “You’re the one who used that word.”
Harry feels like laughing. Like crying. “You are, you ridiculous wanker. Stop pushing me away.”

the light from the massive windows hitting his eyes, the overcast London sky altogether blinding despite the late afternoon hour.
Half-lying on the floor, they looked at the place on the floor where Harry was pointing at.
“I don’t know,” Harry says in a strangled whisper. “I guess I don’t care. I like Tchaikovsky. His music just makes me…
WHAT’S TAKING YOU SO LONG??
“Seeing something that interests you?” Draco quirked an eyebrow. “Did you really hope to have me believe you were here out of genuine concern for me?” He opened his hand, keeping its content inches away from Jeff’s reach. Inside lay his signet ring, the one his father had given him on Platform 9 ¾, minutes before his first boarding of the Hogwarts express eight years ago. The ring shone mutely in the dim light filtering through the four-poster’s curtains, the silver circle embossed with snakes and dragons. The emerald engraved with the ‘M’ of ‘Malfoy’ at its centre gave off a dull gleam, like light filtering through pond water. The twitch of Jeff’s nose intensified and he took a step closer before Draco closed his fist around the ring again. “You want this, don’t you?”
“Are we going to argue about semantics now?”
And then there was Draco, who had been kicked out of the Manor and the family vaults after Lucius ran into him, tie undone and Marcus Flint balls deep inside his arse, in the cloakroom of the Wizarding National Gallery gala.
And if he wants this so much… more than he’s ever wanted any other sexual experience… then it means he’s definitely not straight, right?
supposed to be doing anything?” He shook his head. “It’s fine, Potter. It’s not as though I would have expected coffee and a date after last night. Let’s get back to work.”
“Goodbye, Greg.” Draco smiles. “Best of luck on your Australian adventures.”
“Aww, who let you in, Mister?” Pansy, who was passing by, ruffled the little First Year’s hair. He flinched away. Pansy could not be anything but terrifying even if she tried.
Harry frowns. “Why wouldn't he?”
and not like something you’d both come to regret.”
He remembers how he used to wonder about Draco, back then. What did he do when no one was looking? Who were the first people he talked to in the morning? What would it be like to be his friend? What was the meaning of the emptiness Harry’d felt in sixth year, when Malfoy had stopped paying Harry the kind of unrelenting attention he’d given him since they’d met? Harry sometimes wondered if he’d ever been the focus of someone’s attention the way he’d been for Malfoy all those years. He wondered
Harry huffs a derisive snort. “Is that what you call it?”
Draco scoffed. “Nice word, Potter. What am I, the heroine of a nineteenth century novel?”
those were things I could hold on to, something real I could anchor myself with.”
“Here we are, Potter,” he says. “It’s every man for himself now.” And he sets off at a faster pace.
When Harry moves to the sink to wash his own cutlery, Malfoy steps back. With a flash of hurt, Harry remembers how this whole thing started: with him going out for a jog just because he couldn’t get over Malfoy turning him down at the Royal Ballet House. It doesn’t stop him from grudgingly regretting the lost proximity.
Draco,
He wouldn’t last long. There was something about Malfoy that made him want to bend him over the nearest desk, Head Auror be damned.
Ella DiCara had sat with Draco while he told the Aurors about Nesting
He was
“I seriously doubt it.”
Harry feels more than sees the hand working his flies open, pushing the waistband of his boxers down. The warm air of the opera box feels cool on the heated skin of his aching cock.
Harry reached the cabin first and flung himself against the door. Malfoy’s body slammed into his a second later with so much force it pinned Harry against the heavy wood.
“I disagree,” he says with a shrug. “One can still meet people and have
Draco opened one of the books just to have an excuse to peel his eyes away from Harry. “The options are countless, apparently. There’s too much choice, and nothing to guide us through the various alternatives.” He pointed at a decision diagram that started with the question, ‘Do you enjoy riding Hippogriffs?’. “I'm starting to think McGonagall is as clueless about this as we are.”
but you still need to get some sleep!”
“I haven’t met anyone,” he says, trying hard to unclench his teeth and fists. “That’s not what it is.”
“Do I?” Draco grins into Harry’s hair. Their movements are more purposeful now, Harry’s body perfectly slotted against his, his own legs wrapped around Harry’s thighs, their dripping pricks trapped between their bellies. Draco’s wanking fantasies flash blurily in his mind as Harry slides a lubed hand between their bodies and takes both their cocks into his fist. Draco lets out a moan so loud and wanton he’d be embarrassed by it, if Harry’s gaze wasn’t on his all this time, glasses a little fogged up, eyes glazed with desire, mouth open in a silent gasp. Draco smiles and lifts his hand to Harry’s face, takes off his spectacles, lets them drop on the floor on top of their clothes.
Dear Drake,

“Not for me.”
“... for the best supply of Valkyrie hair, the meticulous witch or wizard should travel to the forests of Bavaria, where quality raw material can be found...”
Harry huffed a laugh. “Yeah, walked right into that one.” He looked at Draco, his green eyes gleaming in the torchlight of the corridor. “Having everything planned and laid out in front of me scares me. I do think of the future of course. Just not into that much detail.”
When he comes out in the foyer, Harry Potter is, indeed, waiting for him. Balzac beat Draco to it: he’s sitting at Harry’s feet, a big doggy grin on his face, and Merlin… Draco is not ready for it. Might never be ready for it. His damned dog is not helping him hate Harry, either. Once more, he wishes he’d had time to go for that morning run — sweat out all the nervous energy, all the adrenaline, and meet Harry when he’s feeling peaceful and strong.
Draco blushed.
frightening
“Yes, Headmistress,” Draco and Harry said in unison. Draco caught Harry’s eye before he turned his head firmly ahead. The corner of Harry’s mouth twitched with a smile.
“Stealth and nosiness, huh? You’re right, Malfoy. Those are definitely not qualities required of an Auror.”
“Oh, you’re enjoying yourself, are you?” He muttered.
“Yes, I do have days where it’s harder to shut the memories out. Yes, I still have nightmares. Yes, sometimes I wish I didn’t have to live through what I’ve lived through. It’s made me who I am. But it’s only
“Just last week! Last week! You were telling me quite graphically—” Hannah says.
“Have you been here long?” Malfoy asks.
He walks closer.
“Hello, kids,” Ginny Weasley called. Hand in hand with a pink-nosed, ski-goggle-wearing Luna Lovegood, they approached the small group huddled around the six-foot-tall snowman they had built. Ginny whistled appreciatively. “Blimey. I see you’ve been busy.”

“Well... yeah. That’s what people do when you come to their houses.”
Ron placed his sandwich in its paper plate, wiped his mouth, and shrugged.
Harry scoffed. “You
Ever since that first sighting at the Ministry cafeteria, Harry keeps noticing Malfoy around the Ministry. It’s uncanny, how Harry can walk into a room and know that Malfoy is there before he even sets eyes on him. He will step out of the Floo and into the Atrium and the back of his neck will prickle, and Malfoy will be there, passing by the tall fountain, chatting with one of his DLF colleagues while carrying boxes of ownerless magical objects. He’ll be washing his hands in the men’s loos and
He takes a breath, and the pages of sheet music flip back to the beginning, as if on their own accord. Then Scorpius starts playing again.
And Malfoy kissed him back with an eagerness that mirrored his own.

Hermione thinks he’s coming down with a new bout of depression. She and Ron take on popping by Harry’s flat three times a week. Hermione brings curry and chicken soup, Ron brings crisps and beer. Harry is touched by his friends’ solicitude, yet he can’t tell them the truth.
You know what? YOUR turn to suck it.
“Shut up,” Harry hides his flaming face into his hands and groans.
“It wouldn’t be the first time everybody thought I was wrong when I was right, Malfoy.”
“She won’t bother you too much. You can get on with your writing. She sleeps a lot right now. You’ll just need to feed her a bucket of brandy mixed with chicken blood every half hour—”
a family. And we’re all going to be together on Christmas.” She fingered her girlfriend’s long, radish-shaped earrings fondly. “You gotta stop saying things like that. You’re bumming everyone out.”
Harry’s heart squeezes in his chest, but he smiles and winks in response. “I doubt that Draco can hurt me. He might be a clever bastard, but I’m still stronger than him.”
“It's not switching sides when I'm only vindicating an innocent man.”
The door opens with a slow creak. The lumbering frame of Greg Goyle appears, silhouetted in the light coming from the parlour. He seems to dither in the doorway, eyebrows drawn down against the relative darkness of Draco’s study, lit only by the fire crackling in the hearth and the small Muggle lamp on Draco’s desk.
“Yes… It’s your birthday, isn’t it?”
“Oh,” Draco said, exhaling through his mouth. He kissed Harry’s forehead, his lips pressed to the now-familiar ridges of his scar. “Okay. I’m—I’m glad I’m here, too.”
“Besides, he’s only a suspect on paper. Because Kingsley and Smith said so. He’s not… I think he’s innocent.”
“So you haven’t looked at potential careers yet? Only ways to decide which general areas might fit you better?”
and didn’t actually enjoy watching Draco blush and stutter.
Yes; I do still feel that way...and I don’t. I know it’s a coward’s answer.
Harry’s head snapped up. Malfoy’s eyes were fixed on him, intent and hungry. He licked his lips, exposing a row of glinting white teeth, and Harry’s brain short-circuited.
“You rejected me, Malfoy.” Harry despises the hurt he hears in his own voice. “Explain to me why you did it, or leave me alone.”
She leans back in her chair, looking relieved.
Greg laughs again. “Better go, then. She can be fearsome when she’s miffed.”
Instead of stepping away in disgust, Harry grinned. “That’s okay. The ‘not best person’ part, I mean. You’re no angel, Draco, but neither am I. No matter what the newspapers may say about me.” Dumbfounded, Draco couldn’t do anything but stare. Harry had no way of knowing about his true nature, of course,but him admitting he wasn’t perfect—when he was the
“Yeah, you can tell it’s nearly Christmas,” Ron gave the Seventh Year girls an annoyed look before moving one of his knights. “All of you waltzing in our common room as you please.”
“Shut up, Malfoy. You loved it.”
Not that Harry thinks about Draco Malfoy
“You thought she was nothing but a house-elf, didn’t you?” Draco lifts an eyebrow, and it’s not a kind expression. “Most people do. They fail to remember house-elves have magic we humans can’t fathom or detect. Ernestina’s never entirely trusted you, and she convinced me I should do a little investigating of my own.”
The remaining guests shuffle back to the study, glasses in hand, the remainder of their bottle of red floating behind them with Pansy’s skilled Leviosa. The doors to the garden have been left open; the night is cool and fragrant, the solitary note of a nocturnal bird trilling in the hedges. Hermione conjures a blanket and lays it down on the dewy grass. The rest of their little group follows, except for Pansy who finds Draco’s newest vinyl record on his desk.
they’re the first that came to mind.
His chest swells with almost unbearable affection. There’s also guilt in there, hidden in the shadows. He ignores it.
Fiendfyre, and the sound of their name on the lips of their one true love.
“My Floo address,” Draco says without stopping what he’s doing. A stubborn strand of blond hair keeps falling on his forehead. He dips the comb under the tap and runs it in his hair again, leaving a wet trail in it. He looks like an ad for some sexy cologne, and Harry tells him so. Draco laughs at that, and catches Harry’s eyes in the mirror. “Thank you. And now you know how to reach me.”
Until the beginning of Eighth Year, that was.
Thank you.
Darkness or not, Harry could recognise Malfoy’s long-suffering sigh anywhere. “I can’t believe you ever received a letter from Hogwarts, Potter, let alone graduated from the same school as me.” A pause so thick Harry could have cut it with a
The thing was... Draco had always known he had a preference for humans who came in a shape similar to his. He had heard there were demons out there who specialized in mongering hate against people who did.
“It’s a pleasure,” Luna smiled contentedly. “As always, when Draco is involved.”
clash with the tone of the series a tad.”
Hello Weasley,
“He’s really into you, mate,” Ron said. He eyed his sister and shrugged sheepishly. “Sorry, Gin.”
“What?”
If we really only had an hour left to live.” He lifted what he hoped was a nonchalant shoulder. “Why not, you know?”
“I need to look after my son. The Healers say it’s going to take weeks for his magic to recover.” He glances at Harry. “And I need… I need time to recover, myself. I need time to ponder my options. I don’t know what to make of your honesty, Potter.”
“Ah. I’m not sure I remember who that is,” Harry says, relieved that he’s making contact with the child and unable to pinpoint why.
“Ah.” Malfoy glances at Harry. Malfoy under a little child’s thumb is just too good a sight. Harry has no intention of helping him out in the least.
Harry, wait—
He takes a flute of champagne from the tray proffered by a waiter at the end of the foyer. He wanders from room to room. Hermione was right: the event is small and tasteful, with the exception of the decorations. The organizers removed all the chandeliers of the house and replaced them with giant paper mâché spiders. Harry supposes it all makes sense, given the theme. He’s not sure how Ron will handle it, though. The other guests notice him, move towards him as if to start a conversation. Harry nods, polite but distant, and ends all attempts at socialization by stalking off to a different direction. He’d rather look at the art and the exhibits of the museum than make small talk with wizards he barely knows. That’s Hermione’s strong suit, after all. She’s here to network. Harry’s just here because it got his friend the invitation she desperately wanted.
“You could still be… that,” Harry says. “You could still be an Auror. And probably a damn brilliant one at that.”
Today's chapter is the one (of

slowly inside.
Walking into the cloakroom feels like wading into a warm current after swimming in a winter lake. Where the hallway is high-ceilinged and airy, the cloakroom is dark, stuffy, intimate. The air smells of wool and the mingled, lingering odour of perfume and oft-worn clothes. Racks and racks of coats, furs, and wizarding outer robes and cloaks muffle the noise of the ball, absorbing even the sound of Harry’s footsteps.
And, yes, it was uncomfortably hot, okay? It’s my best friend we’re talking about. It’s like watching family kiss. But hotter.
The crowd parted just enough for Harry to finally see the bottles glimmering on the table.
“Hey. Hey, Draco—” Harry interrupts him with a lifted hand. “Draco… It’s okay.”
“What happens now?” Harry asks. “Is Zacharias Smith the only one left on the case?”
“—and when she gets a bit bigger, she can eat rats and mice, which she’ll catch herself.”
“So, remember, if Tamara starts nipping you, just stand your ground and tell her no, okay?”
is all she’s been talking about for weeks,” Ron tells Harry.
He leaned closer. “And are those my platinum cufflinks?” Tamara was peering up at Draco now with obvious interest. He smiled weakly at her.
“What are these?”
is important.” Andromeda lifted Teddy off Draco’s lap, cradling him in her arms. “You can go. I’m going to put my grandson to bed now. Goodnight, boys.”
Alone in the quiet kitchen, Draco and Harry shared a look.
“Well,” Draco shrugs and inspects his nail polish — dark grey today. “That seems an awful lot like
“Nope,” Draco says, stressing the ‘p’. He lifts his chin proudly.
God, what a mess.
And Harry Potter was making his way towards him.

Malfoy must see a frown on Harry’s face, because he rolls his eyes with a sigh. “Don’t look at me like that, Potter. Cigarettes after sex are my only sin nowadays.”
“I would buy myself a cone at Fortescue’s,” he said after thinking about it. “The extra large one, remember those? The ones coated with chocolate? With three scoops of cookies-and-cream and two of treacle tart ice cream. And melted chocolate on top.” He smiled at the thought. “You?”
Dear Bulstrode,
They hastily bent their heads over their parchments, pretending to take notes. This earned them a stern look from Granger.
“No, Harry, that was a joke.” At Harry’s blank expression, Malfoy gives his head an amused shake. “Look at you. I never imagined you as the high-strung type. You can ask me personal questions sometimes. I don’t bite.”
His half-smile widens to a sharp grin.
Blaise and Ginny had booked a large cottage for their engagement party weekend. All their friends had slept over, including him and Harry. Although, perhaps, they had slept slightly less than the others.
Then his cock nestles against Malfoy’s arse, his cheeks parting around Harry as he rocks forward, and they both gasp in shock and pleasure.
The red flash hits Smith square in the chest, cutting him off and sending him stumbling backwards, limp body falling against the ravaged grand piano.
“You’re reformed.”
“Okay,” Harry says, undeterred. “What did you want to do when you were at Hogwarts?”
Taken aback, Draco looked down at his question cards. As expected, he couldn’t find an answer to his predicament there. “All right. So the war encouraged you on your path to become Britain’s leading Magizoologist, which makes a lot of people consider you—quite justly, I might add—a prominent figure of the post-Second Wizarding War generation.”
He didn’t think of anyone in a remotely sexual way for years. After yet another polite, but very obvious offer for sex he’d received and rejected — a golden-haired young man met in a Parisian jazz club, who’d eyed him all evening and had asked Draco if he’d like to come to his flat for a drink — Draco finally realised that maybe… he wasn’t wired like everyone else.
Potter stepped closer. Maybe in an attempt to threaten Draco with the size of his biceps, the chiseled lines of which were visible even under his shirt. If so, he’d failed entirely. Far from being intimidated, Draco felt…er…
“It’s your job…” Draco repeats. Almost a question. The way he’s gazing at Harry… like something isn’t quite right, like he wants Harry to tell him something, like maybe he knows…
“That’s Caduceus’ slogan.”
“Wanker.”
“If I was hiding a
Leaning his body against Harry's, Draco gently guided them toward the bed. He ran his tongue along Harry’s upper lip and whispered. “I’m gonna use my tongue and fingers to get you so ready and begging for me."
Granger signed the order form with a triumphant slash of her quill.
The irony isn’t lost on him.
In the middle of the wreckage, when everybody else had left, Harry had cast a gentle Renervate on Balzac, helping the poor dog up on his feet. Balzac’s limp had been worse than before, and Harry had worried about a broken limb before he’d realised Balzac had a long splinter of wood stuck in the paw of his hind leg.
and his long legs like a second skin; and the most stylish combat-style boots Harry’d ever seen.
it makes sense.”
Before he could stop himself, Harry burst out laughing. “Are you being serious?”
Harry eyed the Prothimioscope. “Wait...was everything we just did
“Friends,” Draco says, to no one in particular, over Harry’s shoulder.
“God,” Harry says, running a hand through his hair. “It’s getting late. Look — you’re welcome to stay if you want. I can get the guest room ready… I mean, only if you want to. It’s been a rough evening. You might not want to be alone.” Harry’s stammering now, and Malfoy’s eyebrows go up, his expression half-embarrassed, half-amused. Harry finishes with a little cough: “It’s, er… up to you. Stay here or go home. I… don’t mind.”
“Don’t forget the Prothimioscope,” she said. She smiled fondly when Draco placed the device on the carpet and it turned upright and started to spin around. Its low, characteristic buzz soothed Draco a bit. He snapped his fingers and the Quick-Quotes Quill sprang to life, tip on the parchment and ready for his next notes.
He smirks when Harry meets his eyes, but Harry thinks it’s just for show this time. Malfoy reaches out and wraps his fingers around Harry’s cock, and Harry lies back with a sigh. Malfoy moves closer, hand pumping. Harry can feel Malfoy’s erection slide along his hip, hot and wet at the tip.
Harry screwed up his face. “Did I say dog?”
then I have to agree,” Harry smiled at him.
“Hey,” Harry said.
You think I’m sorry? Nah. I hate those lifts with a passion. Just standing in one makes me shut down like I’m having a panic attack. Releasing some
Draco lifts his chin.
Draco lowers his eyelids, touches the tips of his ring-clad, green-nail polished fingers to his lips. He’s the picture of guilelessness — not that anyone here will be fooled. They’ve been out with him at the clubs. Vogue Fabrics. Heaven. Ku. They know Draco attracts them like a magnet. All of them, like Seekers after the Golden Snitch. Girls, boys, and everyone in between.
Nerves spiked Draco’s belly, but he set his face to ‘casual indifference’ and held out his hands, only trembling slightly. Harry transferred Tamara to him, the little creature squirming mid air until she was safely in his grip. He was surprised how warm she was to the touch.
“Fine. I didn’t. You have too many of them! I asked Scorpius. He seems to know them all.”
Anyway! Should we ignore our previous letters then? Start from the top?
-Draco
“Your coat, sir?” A butler, an honest-to-god butler, pops out of nowhere. Harry catches the spark of recognition in the man’s eyes when he turns to answer. But the butler is professional to a fault. Instead of groveling, he simply holds out a hand, a gentle reminder of his earlier question.
Grimacing, he casts cleaning and drying charms on both their crotches. Harry watches the swirl of magic, eyes crinkled with a playful grin. “If I’d known you’d be bestowing gay wisdom on me when I came here, I’d have brought my school supplies.”
No. Of course he can’t tell Ron that.
“G’night, Draco,” he’d said, before disappearing behind the door.
Regretfully. I mean, we were friendly acquaintances for years, but...I didn't quite know how to approach you. See, I had the biggest, most embarrassing crush on you.
“That’s the kettle calling the pot black.”
They watched the waves crash on the shore. The waters were dark and green.
When he recovers, Draco drops a light kiss on Harry’s damp nape. “I’ll let you fix your clothing now,” he murmurs. And adds, as Harry tenses under him, “I’m just stepping away. I’m not…
Draco caught sight of something shiny in his slipper. “Harry, is that— Is that my Rolex?”
Draco casts a weary glance at him. “Your single-mindedness wins.” He sighs.
“What was that about?” He hissed.
(to see). A magical device. Indicates that a person’s speech is free, uncoerced and willing.
Ron scratches his cheek. “When you put it like that, it sounds almost sweet.”
Blood rushing in his ears, Draco nodded.
“Draco is going to hate me.” Pansy sniffs.
I came to see
He was burning to tell Harry, but something held him back. He looked back at the fire, unable to maintain eye contact.
“Those pesky things,” muttered Malfoy as he slid his glasses in the pocket of his trousers.
Harry walked up to him, bag in hand, cloak thrown over his shoulder. He placed his hand on Draco’s shoulder for him to follow.
Draco laughs louder now, throwing his head back, baring his teeth. It sounds almost deranged, because there’s nothing funny about the situation at all. Then he shuts his mouth and the laughing stops. He stands and closes the gap with Harry’s bed, and it’s all Harry can do not to cower. Draco’s towering over him, and Harry’s hand itches for his wand.
Dewey has known Harry for years now, but he still calls him by his last name when the rest of the wizarding world thinks it’s perfectly okay to call him ‘Harry’ as though he’s their friend. Their family. Their Saviour.
“I can,” he says.
This seemed to shut Harry down. Draco’s mouth was dry. He’d have to come up with a plan for the future. He gave his head a shake.
“And that's definitely my grandfather’s gold clasp.” Draco jabbed his finger towards the slipper but recoiled when Tamara bared her tiny pointy teeth with a high-pitched growl.
“What the fuck do
“That’s not it, though, is it?” She touches Harry’s elbow with gentle fingers. “Is there anything you’re not telling us, Harry?”
“I wasn’t the only one involved. Why was it

He doesn’t want Malfoy to go.
-Hermione
There was a pondering pause around the table.
He looks like he belongs here, with Draco. For all the times in his life when Draco’s wanted to run away from people looking at him like that, in the fond, heated way Harry’s looking at him now, he’s never once wanted to reciprocate so badly.
right? He must have known the effect his little stunt would have on Draco. The proximity, the physicality of exhaling his breath into Draco’s mouth, of Draco inhaling Harry’s breath into his lungs. The slow slide of Harry’s fingers along his jaw, his cheek, into his hair. The look he’d given him just before blowing smoke into his mouth—a little mischievous, a little cocky, but also... soft, fond, trustworthy.
to remind me, didn’t you?
in the back of his throat, blankly eyeing the t-shirt in his hands. His throat is working and he looks like he’s about to say something. Draco picks another t-shirt from a shelf and quickly pulls it on, hiding his scarred chest and stomach from view. He gets a pair of joggers and trainers for Harry. When he looks back at Harry, the man is still staring. Draco snaps his fingers in front of him.
Harry
(Daddy casts them over my bed every night, still.) (They warn him when I get up.) (Daddy used to be worried. The tension around his eyes even when he smiled. Dr Dawson said it wasn't my fault. But if I wasn't there, Daddy wouldn't worry. Now I only cancel the charms when I don't want to wake him up.) (Today it's fine if he sleeps in.)
Want. The driving force behind these encounters with Draco Malfoy. He wants, with a force that takes his breath away.
conversation?” Draco rolled his eyes. “McGonagall strikes me as the type who values punctuality.”
the storm has passed. Whatever shall we do now, Potter?” He pressed a kiss on Harry’s shoulder. The hair at the back of Harry’s neck stood to attention and he instinctively pushed his arse against Malfoy’s groin. The answer was a light bite of Malfoy’s teeth and a twitch of Malfoy’s cock against the small of his back. “Mmh, you’re insatiable,” Malfoy murmured in his ear. His hand slid from Harry’s side down to his soft prick, which plumped immediately in his palm.
moments. “Tell me,” he probed again with a mock-lascivious smile, “and I might let you have a closer look.”

“Oi!” Ginny threw a dessert spoon at her brother from across the table with the skilful aim of a Chaser. It hit Ron square on the forehead. Draco could finally admit he’d always found her a bit intimidating. “Harry didn’t
