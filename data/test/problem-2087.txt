Weasley. Your business enterprise has branched out into adult entertainment. And I think I’m going to become a regular shopper if he keeps giving me free and useful stuff.”
A conversation with this man was nowhere on Harry’s agenda. But it did seem like a good idea to do what Michael suggested. They were only going to talk. Harry should listen to what Michael wanted to say. Harry didn’t need to judge on past mistakes. He should forgive and forget. And Harry needed to make amends for the nasty, unwarranted thing that he had done to Michael.
“I know I’ve said this before, Harry, but you don’t need to avoid the whole family because of one person. They love you and they only want to make sure you’re all right.”
“I think you want to ask me something,” she said as she fiddled with the fizzing sparkler in her glass of purple… liquid. Harry cringed, feeling guilty about being so apparently transparent. “Don’t worry, Harry. If you hadn’t contacted me today, then I was going to come tell you anyway. Or ask you, I suppose. And I think now would be a good time, when Draco’s on his way to the little boy’s room. It’s always strangely busy in there compared to the girl’s bathroom. He might be a while.”
“Yes.” Draco’s grin was addictive. But Harry had already known that. “I’ll pick out a bunch that I think you’ll like and bring them over.”
Considering the ridiculousness of both his life and this conversation, Harry decided to take Malfoy’s word for it.
Whatever the outcome, his opponent wasn’t long in following Harry’s lead. The rocking ceased, Draco groaned into Harry’s mouth, and Draco’s body tensed as Harry felt more warmth spurt over both their groins to mingle with Harry’s climax.
A particular feather caught Harry’s attention and he removed it from the drawer to have a better look. It was strangely red for a peacock feather. Not that he knew a lot about peacocks or their plumage, but it seemed odd.
Another wave from Harry, but this one was followed by silence. Harry knew the charm was gone though.
Remembering the stressful events at the Manor on Saturday, Harry lightly stroked the fur, earning him an adorable squeak.
hostile, Harry knew that much. Through the lengthy sorting of everything within the Manor, he’d learned that hostile or dangerously cursed objects displayed a sort of… stuttering of the magic around them. A displacement of air, perhaps. Harry struggled to accurately describe it. Luna declared that displacement to be an aura, but Harry wasn’t buying into the mystical concept of auras. Oddly, both Luna and Draco insisted that

“You can apologise profusely after you’ve thrown something heavy at me. And until then, only when you’ve actually done something wrong.”
Fidgeting awkwardly, Harry felt like he was stalling on Draco’s behalf. He knew that Draco had destroyed the other portrait of Lucius, but he understood why Draco couldn’t take this final step himself. This was the only remaining active link to the man that Lucius had been. Although Harry was more than willing to follow through with his promise, removing the last trace of Draco’s father was no insignificant act.
“Oh, yes. I could really feel the love. And yet he didn’t seem to understand why I left. I hate this house. I’ll be relieved when it’s sold.”
“Your face was tripping you. Like it does every night. And if you don’t want to be out here, then why did you come with me?”
Tension abruptly returning in force, all three of them sat in silence. Ron stared down at his boots, Draco glared at Ron’s face, and Harry flicked his gaze between the two, feeling a tinge of helplessness.
He turned back to Draco, enjoying one more kiss. Maybe they could delay long enough for a teeny bit of tongue. Perhaps more…
Draco angled his head to the side, as if he was examining something intriguing. “It’ll be with you, right?”
The response from Potter when he spotted the small bottle in Draco’s grip was not positive. Potter wrenched himself off the mattress in a heartbeat, almost tripping on the hems of his lowered clothing as his feet landed on the floor.

“No,” Draco snapped. He took a visibly deep breath. “No,” he said again, quieter this time. “Seeing him… seeing the

But knowing that didn’t help Harry feel less of a failure. Harry’s instincts still informed him at any opportunity of all the many ways that he was lacking as a person. The guilt didn’t go away, because Harry

As Harry repeated the instructed exercise, it gradually became easier. His head was beginning to clear a little. Keep his eyes closed and breathe; that’s all he needed to do.
There were clubs, Harry knew. Places he could visit to find sexually compatible men. But the thought of anonymous sex left him cold. He didn't want to have sex with people he didn't know. Harry was looking for more of a connection, even if it was on a casual basis. What he needed was -

looked at him. Worried, Harry moved his head in small motions to each side, tracking the flickering eyes, but each time he thought he could catch Draco’s gaze, it evaded him, sliding away.
Soon standing outside, he panted slightly. Malfoy’s grip felt strong, and Harry liked his wrist exactly where it was.
Harry didn’t move while he tried to clarify his words. He’d learned that Malfoy liked him to hold his given position without restraints, when possible. “I understand that I don’t deserve lubricant. That the lack of it will teach me my place.”

information about whatever was bothering him. Frustrated at himself, he amended his answer. “Yes, I do.”
“I was down at the joke shop from Hell, so I thought I’d come get you before you got distracted with more wand stuff. I have use for you at home, Harry.”
Harry thought about that and slowly shook his head. “No… nope. Not hating you. It’s been… a bit rubbish, though.”
Unable to think of an answer which wouldn’t incriminate him, Draco left the room before he could worsen his situation.
“Perhaps I would,” whispered Draco, the bump moving faster. “If I want to ensure that the task is expertly done.”
As the speed increased, Harry thought Malfoy wouldn’t need much more. The hold around Harry’s wrists strengthened to a bruising grip… a lovely imprisonment as Draco took what he needed in this moment. What Harry wanted to give him. Harry’s legs clung on Malfoy’s moving hips and Harry used them to give himself more leverage to meet each of Malfoys downward thrusts, eager to keep up with the onslaught.
powerful. He didn’t need a wand anymore. Or a voice. There was nothing Malfoy could do to him that Harry couldn’t prevent or stop. And Malfoy knew that.
“Do you want to talk about it?” Draco asked. Harry speculated how many times Draco had felt that question was required since the beginning of their relationship.
“That would’ve been chivalrous of you, Harry. But I’m quite capable,” she said as she rested the pile on the counter.

in his office, Harry eagerly looked forward to this interesting turn of events. When Malfoy reached him and slightly loosened his grip, deliberately letting Harry view what he held, Harry could see that it wasn’t small; even its narrow neck looked wider than Malfoy’s cock. Harry shivered with delight, still needing badly to come and hoping that this might somehow earn him that privilege.
Okay. Get it done. For Draco. Harry turned his attention from Draco to the portrait, but he kept a close watch on Draco within his peripheral vision, looking carefully for any signs of reluctance or protest. He saw none but remained alert as he concentrated on the fabric-covered frame and its contents. Harry needed this gone from the world as well because
Harry did. He hadn’t realised how much his sight had been tunnelling before, but now that he’d regained the full extent of his normal peripheral vision, it was like the world around him had opened up.
Harry reckoned it would only take about three more thrusts for himself but didn’t bother to count as he let his own arousal tip over into Draco’s arse.
Right. But with Harry’s bonkers magic and his impressive historical score of unfortunate, improbable, or downright
“Yeah,” replied Harry as he walked from behind the counter. When he reached Draco, he pecked a kiss on soft lips before he headed for the door to flip the sign and lock up.

“He hasn’t ranted about that since school, Hermione.” She nodded in acknowledgement of that. “So, now we have more than five minutes to talk to each other… what’re you up to nowadays?” asked Harry.
But Malfoy always heard everything, and a sharply hissed inhalation from above confirmed that the awful word hadn’t been missed. Harry listened to Malfoy’s increasingly loud breaths and prayed that Malfoy would continue on regardless.
“Don’t speak. This is a pitiful performance. Close your eyes, you don’t deserve to look at me.” Harry wanted to cry at that evaluation. He closed his eyes and gulped back his distress. “And you still haven’t completed your task. I will allow you twenty more seconds to satisfy me. Don’t disappoint me any further.”
Pulling back from Draco, Harry felt a small pang of guilt as he regarded Molly’s pleased smile. This action might cost him the Weasleys, but he hoped they’d forgive him. If they knew why, he was sure that they would. Not that Harry intended to tell them why.
them yet.” Harry raised his eyebrows and waited for more. “Preparations were underway to intervene with Corner and Weasley’s state of employment, but you dealt with that fine by yourself. At least, with Corner’s. And I must admit, you used a sneakier and more foolproof plan than I had. That was kind of awesome.”
Harry didn’t quite believe that though, even now. No-one worked in the Ministry for three years because they thought Harry was… what, attractive? Utter nonsense. Harry had learned that there was no point disputing it with Draco though.
A soft rustle of sheets emanated from the bed as Draco stretched, roused, and yawned. And now he’d woken up Draco again. He watched in dismay as Draco sat up and swung his legs over the side of the mattress, but Draco didn’t stand.
“No, not the Wizengamot. The other folk. It was the Wizengamot who pressured me into running for election and tried to force me to stay in office, but it was
“I’m…” Draco’s blinks were becoming more rapid as his eyes filled with moisture. “I…” Appearing to give up on speech, Draco lowered his head and buried his face into Harry’s shoulder.
Harry threw the file back onto the desk and turned to look for a clean robe from the rack. The one he was wearing had coffee down the front of it from the mug that his magic had disintegrated into powder with his frustration. That cheeky, smug delegate should think himself lucky that it hadn’t been his head. At least the man had the decency to look alarmed by the fate of Harry’s ceramics. It hadn’t shut him up for long though.
break your contract, you won’t suffer any magical or legal ramifications. It could ruin your reputation though. Or increase your godliness within certain circles. But I suspect that the Ministry would want to keep the reason for your dismissal quiet, considering. Or as quiet as they could in the circumstances.”
When he was certain that Draco was immersed in the caress of their tongues, the nipping of Harry’s teeth, he shifted his hands up to where Draco had rested his palms on Harry’s hips. Harry curled his fingers around Draco’s wrists and plucked them away from his body, down to the sheet on either side of Draco’s head, pressing them firmly onto the mattress in exactly the way that Draco had done to him on countless occasions.
Potter grinned, lounging on Draco’s bed as if he belonged there. “You were in just as much of a rush as I was.”
of it’s your fault. So, there’ll be none of that self-flagellation crap that you like to do. I won’t
It did sound like something Harry would enjoy. Bent forward over the plush felt rectangular section upon the slanted surface, which Harry presumed was at the perfect angle for writing snotty letters, he felt Malfoy's hands explore the denim covering his arse, over the curve and down the central seam. Harry was relishing a lovely sense of swelling cock and anticipation when Malfoy hummed pensively and said, “Or maybe I'll do something different with my whore today.” Harry's interest was piqued. “Instead of the manner in which I’d usually make use of you, I think I’ll experiment.” That sentence didn’t help to clarify Malfoy’s intentions. But the next one unfortunately began to. “In honour of my dear father, I think it’s time for you to at least
“Well, you were bouncing on my lap with my cock up your arse. Sometimes multi-tasking can only go so far. And you’d earned the spanking by that point, anyway. I just thought it might be better for both of us if there was a limited number to work with. It’s not like I’ve had much spanking practice before.” With heat glowing from his bum, Harry was having a hard time believing that. “But you do have impressive self-control with proper motivation. You’ve no idea how much effort it took to hold on as long as I did. I nearly came about three times.”
. If they wanted to see how well the Minister for Magic could obey, then Harry would oblige. Harry would give the people in this building such an outrageous show of his utterly perfect and
Draco tugged him slightly, effectively performing the shuffle which Harry had been tempted to do. Harry moaned as their erections finally rubbed together. When Draco’s hands resumed their previous positions at Harry’s back and neck, and their chests were flush again, Harry ensured his grip was secure around Draco, and Draco began the game.
The sunroom delighted Harry. He liked the open space created by the huge windows and colourful foliage which overshadowed his own conservatory at home with both intricate beauty and design. And there were many nooks and crannies built into the space where a seemingly endless assortment of wonderful small objects had been deliberately hidden to be discovered. But he wanted to see Draco happily flicking through piles of books, so he chose the library.
that it was true. But he’d rather not have his bits on display to scare any innocent passers-by. Harry may love submitting, but there had to be
Harry didn’t care much for the idea of moving right now, but Draco nudged at the side of Harry’s rump in quiet insistence.
“I didn’t want to seem presumptuous,” Draco replied as he retrieved the Puff, examining her intently.
Ah. Yes, they should probably deal with that. Gingerly, Harry rolled his body to his right until he was face down on the bed again. He felt Draco’s fingers as they moved to find purchase around the glass ball, and the vibrations ceased.

?” That’d been one of Draco’s poorest efforts at speaking a sentence, but he hoped Potter would comprehend his meaning.
The issue of failing to be silent became more urgent as the length began to move in and out of Harry’s channel, buggering him in smooth, shallow, vibrating thrusts. That was bad enough… or awesome… but then he felt the angle conspicuously alter inside him and press its weight onto his prostate.
“I didn’t understand at first. I mean, intentionally Marking someone against their will was no help to the cause,” Draco shrugged. “It’d only create a disloyal Death Eater. But I think the bastard did it simply because he
Several hours later, Harry was standing in the Manor beside Ron in front of Lucius’ desk in the study, trying for what felt like the umpteenth time that day to prevent a calamity. The room had been mostly cleared out. Previously book-laden wooden shelves were empty, and the ornate desk now only played host to five small boxes carved out of different materials. Near the desk was an ugly padded brown leather, thin-legged ottoman upon a large, nauseatingly purple monstrosity of a rug which had been moved from one of the bedrooms. The type of plush decorative item which Aunt Petunia would’ve referred to as a shag rug, much to Harry’s youthful amusement.
A second later, Michael reacted to the danger and raised his wand. The wood was already on fire when Michael pointed it at Harry.
There was no answer Harry could offer that would satisfy Draco on that count, so he didn’t reply. He laid his head on Draco’s nearby shoulder for some brief respite before he straightened and brought his attention back to the letter.
dry. The tips of Harry’s fingers felt distinctly slippery with water where he’d touched it, but there was no sign of moisture on his skin.
“I understand how tempting death can be,” Potter whispered, then continued on in a clear volume as if he’d said nothing of relevance, “But things will be better for you… you’ll have a good future.”
The vibrations had abandoned their steady rhythm and started to pulse in more random intervals, making it that much harder to resist when Harry didn’t know when the next one would hit. In addition, the thrusts lengthened to such an extent that Harry marvelled that the toy hadn’t fell from his hole. It felt like the shaft was leaving only an inch inside with every outwards movement before it slammed back fully into him, relocated his prostate and repeated. And repeated and repeated, and… and… if Draco didn’t return soon, Harry was becoming tempted to just let go and face the ramifications.
what I like!” Even though Potter hadn’t moved, Draco could see him retreating from the hostility, so Draco lowered his voice as he continued. “It only matters what I’m allowed to have.” And that most definitely didn’t include Potter. “I’ve learned that it’s futile to try anything that I might
. Harry’s cock made use of the lengthy interim to slowly thicken within the confines of his trousers. This is why Harry needed to relocate Malfoy to another country, not invite him home. It wasn’t the first time that his penis had experienced an inappropriate reaction to the words that spouted from Malfoy’s mouth. Humiliation and arousal were steadily combining to become perfectly complimentary for Harry, but that was a nightmare within the context of this terrible conversation. He wanted to crawl into a corner and hide. He wanted to cry. He wanted to wank himself raw while Malfoy berated his pathetic existence. Harry had admitted his frustration to the worse possible audience and given Malfoy ammunition to make his life a living hell. He expected the contempt to begin shortly. And the twisted side of him actually wanted it.
Over the next few days, Draco missed the stalking. It was a strangely lonely experience striding through the corridors of Hogwarts without Potter. The removal of Potter’s one-sided chatter allowed Draco too much time to notice everything else. Some students glared as he passed, others deliberately blocked his progress, causing him either to engage or to veer widely away from their vicinity. Draco preferred to veer, since he couldn’t risk unpleasant confrontations. It was odd that with Potter by his side, Draco’s way had always been clear.
The inflection which Harry had emphasised was no accident, and he hoped that Draco would understand his meaning. Harry didn’t usually ask Draco for oral sex. While he loved to suck Draco’s cock, the same act performed on

Malfoy seemed very indecisive about that pillow, Harry thought when it was again yanked away from him. Now completely flat on his back though, Harry could appreciate the advantages as Malfoy firmly grabbed his wrists and pressed them down on the mattress on either side of Harry’s head.
“I’m very disappointed by your disobedience. But what else can I expect from a worthless whore?” Harry wasn’t stupid enough to reply. “Open your eyes. Get off me. Kneel on the floor. You don’t warrant the comfort of a mattress.”
“Okay,” Potter murmured, peeling his body from Draco’s back, hopefully to burrow into the covers a safe distance away. Which couldn’t be very far, considering the narrow width of the bed. Even as he resented the invasion, Draco caught himself angling his neck to appear amenable to future tongue administrations and it occurred to him that sharing his bed with Potter may have unsettling connotations.

“I’m not sure what answer you want me to give.” Potter rose and sat back on his heels, looking more confused. Draco’s cock felt the loss with great sorrow. “I thought you wanted this.”
Although there had already been many moments in Draco’s life which had shocked him into speechlessness, this was the worst. The sense of devastating loss as Draco watched Potter flee up the hill towards the castle was surely inconsistent with what he was losing, but all Draco could think was one word:
“Morning,” chirped Potter when he reached Draco, the brightness of his smile not echoed on the face of the accompanying Weasley.
“It’s freezing.” Potter shivered slightly, his wayward hair already drooping with the weight of water, but he offered no further complaint as they began to walk in tandem away from the castle. “And by who?”
, Harry became aware of an ominous creaking noise coming from directly beneath him. Delayed by the ecstasy of his orgasm, it was just beginning to dawn on him what it was and he was hastily debating the ramifications of moving without permission in the circumstances when the wood split apart.
afraid, even though he clearly was. But Malfoy had always been able to do that to him. All it had ever taken was a single, predictable taunt to rile Harry up and make him forget everything else. It worked every time. But Harry wasn’t eleven years old anymore, Malfoy couldn’t simply accuse him of being

to be that. But there was something about Malfoy that had always been able to break Harry’s shields. But Harry wasn’t what he was meant to be, wasn’t the steadfast hero, wasn’t the unshakable leader, wasn’t the reliable strength that the world had required, wasn’t the assertive lover, wasn’t
Harry was shocked by the strength of an anomalous urge… something that he didn’t normally enjoy, that he wouldn’t even
“I’m… not sure,” Harry admitted. “I thought… that it might be nice. Should I move?” he asked, concerned that he’d overstepped.
When Harry collapsed limply back into the mattress and Malfoy eventually released him, reality started to seep back. Harry was in
“No weirder than the rest of ours. I have some truly bonkers ideas floating about in my brain. Genius notions, of course… but bonkers.”
Harry’s fingers started to tremble again as he obeyed, the tremors continuing when he had Malfoy’s cock in his hand, feeling gratified that Malfoy was as hard as he was. Task completed, he relinquished the heated flesh and returned his hands to his thighs. Harry wanted to do only as directed and hoped that his restraint would be appreciated.
Draco obliged, snapping his hips faster as Harry dug his heels possessively into Draco’s buttocks. Harder, harder, bloody
In the past, Harry had always thought of this process as a series of technical stages. It was the only way he knew how to approach the task.
“All right,” Draco said with a nod. “So… less clothes? But hey… up to you. And I should probably also mention that I’m not terribly… submissive.”
“There’s my stubborn Potter,” Malfoy smirked. Harry’s hand was claimed in a comforting grip before Malfoy gently tugged him towards one of several doors around the foyer. “Prepare yourself to view many hideous artefacts that will emphasise the stupidity of my family line. Thank god I’m the last one.”
Yes, he did. He needed to get a grip. He needed to pull himself together. He needed to go back to being a functioning human who didn’t stare out of a bedroom window in the middle of the night. A person who could walk outside without checking over his shoulder every few minutes in case someone was intending to cast
But Harry hadn’t explained his past properly to Draco. He’d simply told Malfoy that he didn’t like topping and left it at that. Hadn’t given details, didn’t want to think about any of it, let alone talk about it. Especially
Predicting an awkward conversation, Draco plucked up his wand and cancelled the silencing charm which had still been in place. As he replaced his wand on the nightstand, Draco deeply regretted being too aroused by Potter’s wiles to cast a magical barrier.
Malfoy hummed and Harry was so close that could feel the vibrations through his throat as he spoke. “So, freshly-escaped former Minister for Magic, what would you like to do now that you’re a man of leisure?”
Shortly, Harry heard rummaging coming from the direction of Malfoy’s office before Malfoy’s voice came from the direction of the interconnecting door. “Look at me.”
Harry was rewarded by a beaming smile. He was so stunned to have prompted such an obvious expression of joy that he felt himself beaming back, happy to have pleased. As he smiled, Harry’s awkwardness regarding the situation started to diminish.
“Maybe you could use your left hand, Harry. And… perhaps a cleaning charm before you come out of here,” suggested Ron.
Faced with the contrasting mix of Harry’s words and expression, Lucius didn’t seem to know how to react. The oil paints that represented his face were darkening in colour as he glared at Harry.

The corner of Harry’s mouth curved up as he moved his hips slowly forwards and his cock into warmth, watching as Draco’s eyelids fluttered with the pleasure of being stretched and filled.
Draco stood, disturbed that he’d indulged in such an inappropriate display of concern. He was determined to smack Potter out of his personal space and
always affect me, but letting it fester isn’t making things better. I should give people a chance. And I want to try to be happy with you.” Harry groaned at his own words as he looked down at their clasped fingers and stroked Draco’s hand with his thumb. “Uck, that sounded less cheesy in my head.”
Draco sighed. “I’m not going to push you into anything you’re not ready for. But I do think it’d good for you. Just think about it.”
Draco panted, wanting Potter back, but he clenched his wayward hands by his sides and stood firm. “Do you really think everything’s that simple?” Draco said. “Like and dislike? Nothing’s that straightforward.”
it. Harry wondered where that person had gone. Maybe that man had never existed. Another thing Harry had been pretending to be.
Harry dipped his head and his eyes fluttered closed as he nuzzled and mouthed at the skin of Draco’s neck, the scratchings of stubble at his jaw. He continued to move his hand along the stiffening length, varying pressure and speed, changing the angle of his wrist and the placement of his fingers, listening to Draco’s breathing and the quiet, humming moans which were steadily growing in volume. Pleased with the rigidity of the cock within his grip, Harry took cues to be bolder when his actions began to encourage louder, full-throated groans.
“No,” Draco admitted, dropping to sit on the edge of the bed. He vaguely wondered why they hadn’t been disturbed by more Gryffindors, but supposed that Weasley had possibly kept them at bay. It wasn’t important. “I… don’t think you’d do that.”
be sticking your finger into!” Harry shouted as the tip of Ron’s index finger neared the rim of the wood.
Harry picked up a quill, dipped it in ink and attempted to write something relevant to his task. Fat chance, really. The subject that so often overwhelmed his thoughts had only been exacerbated by the events of the previous evening.
A blur of pink and green fur rolled off the bedside table, signalling Jemima fleeing from Harry’s peculiar conduct.
Harry complied, surprised when Malfoy carefully folded the shirt and set it on the couch beside him.
. Draco’s gaze followed the line of Potter’s throat, down his collarbone, his nipples, flat stomach, and beyond.
Oh. It seemed that Malfoy might’ve been giving Harry time to overcome his internal struggle and sink into submission.
As the reality of the aftermath gradually settled, Harry reflected on the things he could’ve done better. After all, this was stage four: the time for Harry’s shortcomings to be pointed out to him by his lovers. It was best to be prepared.
Ron seated himself in Arthur’s favourite armchair, clearly intending to give Harry and Draco space as he gestured that they should both sit on the couch. Harry lowered himself onto the right side of the couch, closest to Ron. Draco stood in front of the left side but didn’t sit until Harry lightly tugged on the cuff of his sleeve. Draco had not camouflaged any of his scepticism about Ron’s innocence. Harry was prepared to wait and see.
The Slytherins’ glares intensified, fingers twitching menacingly around clenched wands, promising violence towards Draco at the first opportunity. Random Ravenclaws developed the audacity to approach Draco, offering congratulations regarding his quick reflexes. And young Hufflepuffs gazed up at him with round eyes full of fearful awe. Admittedly, the awe wasn’t so bad. But the Gryffindors had begun to smile awkwardly at him in the common room and classes, leaving Draco floundering to determine the best way to respond. A space between Potter and Weasley was always kept open for him at the Gryffindor table, and Potter was the only one who didn’t seem pleased to have Draco sit in it.
“Bloody hell, Potter. You scared the shi -” was all that Draco managed to speak before Harry walked forward and wrapped his arms around Draco’s shoulders.
The faint tut from above him should’ve altered him to the possibility that Malfoy would take action to ensure his compliance. With both horror and delight, he felt the legs shift together beneath him, effectively sandwiching Harry’s cock between the firm muscles of Malfoy’s thighs.
Taking stock of their current location and recent activities, Draco wondered if he’d been played all along. Potter’s persistence to engage Draco at the beginning of the school year niggled at him… perhaps Draco’s plan to use Potter sexually had actually been subtly orchestrated from the other side.
“Oh, don’t worry, Granger,” Draco reassured with obvious falsity. “Staring into space like a moron is a fine occupation for Potter. It’s perfectly at his level of expertise where productivity is concerned.”
That could’ve gone better, Harry considered. Over the next while, Harry tried to ignore Lucius and concentrate on moving books as per Draco’s system, but he wasn’t as adept at dismissing Lucius as Draco was.
before. If he was able to pick up on stuff like that, surely everyone could. Harry wasn’t particularly magically talented.
That was a lot to absorb. Harry searched for a response. Thankfully, Malfoy seemed to have developed a patient side.
“Yup. Pygmy Puff porn is not a thing I’d like to experiment with,” confirmed Harry, twisting his arm back to blindly gather up the ball of fluff since Draco was too busy playing with Harry’s hair and trying not to laugh. Harry placed her on Draco’s chest beside his head where she sat and purred in contentment. “If Jemima's not at least offering me a scone, then she’s not following the current established precedent for female sexual advances.”
Another of Malfoy’s oversimplified solutions. “It’s hardly the world.” Just Britain, and that was bad enough.
Draco tutted. “I don’t think you’re ready for this yet,” he said, indicating the object he was holding.
Draco took a huge chance with his next words, aware of how badly it could backfire. “Do you think it’d help if you talked to me?”
And the same experience was what Harry had steeled himself for today. But, wanting to face up to his fear, he’d refused to allow Draco to deal with the boggart and had come in here alone.
Harry didn’t usually let people steer him into bed and tuck him in like a child, but he was willing to make an exception just this once and soon found himself nicely installed back under the recovered duvet, magically cleaned and looking forward to whatever amount of sleep he could still achieve.
“My father held me down,” Draco blurted, not entirely understanding his need to say it. But he ventured on regardless. “When I received… my Mark. Because the Dark Lord was angry with him, and my father wanted to prove his loyalty. He didn’t…”
“But that’s not what… it did get me thinking though, about what I might want to do now. I was busy being respectably employed for a while, as you remember. Then I had the family estate to sort and sell, and now…” Draco shrugged. “I don’t think rich layabout will suit me.”
Potter cautiously crawled forward on hands and knees, taking heed of Draco’s silent direction to lie down as Draco rolled onto his side. Soon Potter was installed in front of Draco, back to chest, bum to groin, just where Draco wanted him to be. Feeling emboldened, Draco dipped his fingers under Potter’s waistband and slowly tugged until the elastic rested in the groove below round buttocks.
“I know,” Ron sighed. “I’d meant to. I did want to talk to you, a lot over the last few years. But somehow it… never happened. I was angry with you at first, Harry. I thought you’d ruined the chance for you and Michael to be together. And I wasn’t interested in hearing any of your excuses for hurting him.”
Harry landed on a kneeling Draco’s lap. But Draco didn’t stop there; Harry felt Draco’s body turn and his legs shift and straighten until Draco was lying on his back with Harry straddling his thighs, just how Harry had positioned himself back in the Manor.
“Weasley’s withdrawn his application. Proper adult responsibility is clearly beyond him. So, now it’s that creepy partner of his and two other Aurors still in the running.”
Harry swallowed again. “It’s… his. Michael’s,” Harry added at Draco’s nod. “But… he wrote that if I’d… been
Draco came back into Harry’s full field of vision as he bent to briefly stroke his hand tenderly over Harry’s hair before he straightened and stepped back with a low chuckle.
Abandoning the gradual build up to this moment which he’d usually utilise, Harry moved his hips with a well-practiced swivel. When the head of his erection stroked Draco’s prostate, Harry felt the shudder from Draco all the way down his embedded cock.
for that. I could fuck your face until you can barely breathe. Maybe we’d attract a crowd. People lingering outside your door, watching you swallow my cock and helping me to berate your worthless existence.”
easier to take him into custody. He was a sitting duck. I know how well he can duel against large groups and wasn’t looking forward to a fight that he might win.”
The resulting awkward silence was broken when Draco said, “Weasley, I think I need to buy you a cake.”
Potter looked back up at Draco, his lips quirking into a small smile. “I was enjoying it. I do want to.” The smile vanished. “But if you… weren’t, then I won’t.”
. As their relationship progressed, Harry often felt confident enough to be marginally brazen within his submission. But sometimes that worked out better than others.
And although Harry didn’t want to play at being a Dark Wizard, he could get on board with the handcuffs. But then
him. “I don’t want to bring any of this up with him. I know that might show you how weak I am, but I -”
This was insanity. Harry was leaving himself wide open for ridicule and judgment. Harry didn’t want that between him and Draco. He removed his fingers and cradled his wet hand to his chest.
“That’s not why it isn’t here. Your blood family was already gone. Like you’ve said so many times… this was all just material
Harry breathed a muffled warning of imminent climax into Malfoy’s mouth and Malfoy increased his speed, silently demanding that Harry come. Not about to disagree on such an
“And tales of your continuing unnatural behaviour have been recently discussed around a few frames I’ve visited,” Lucius continued. “Although I’m less… tolerant of your latest choice of bedfellow. Polluting my family line is not acceptable.”
Hearing the news that Michael was no longer a threat, Harry had a faint sense that he should be relieved. But the reality wasn’t fully sinking in yet.
“You said it yourself, we’re not a couple. We don’t need to do hugs and stuff.” Draco did not partake in meaningless affectionate gestures.
hard to force himself to come when imbedded in another man's arse. There had once been an incident when he couldn’t bring himself to even try… he didn’t want to relive the event which had followed that failure. And it was far too fresh in his mind after Lucius’ comments.
Harry’s incredulous look must have conveyed his thoughts, because Malfoy rose from his seat and extended a hand to help Harry stand up.
“Please don’t take the piss,” whispered Harry, the remaining traces of his confidence dwindling to be replaced by mortification again. “Just tell me what else I did wrong. I’ll try to fix it.”
Unfortunately, Harry’s cock was starting to show keen interest in Malfoy’s plan; it did have a certain level of preposterous appeal.
Harry wrapped his arms around his torso, trying to hide from the cold draft in the room. Not that he deserved any comfort. He hunched his shoulders, picked a spot on the floor between his knees to stare at, and attempted to breathe.
“Would you like to burn my father’s portrait when we’re at the Manor in the morning?” Draco suggested. “That might cheer you up.”
“No. There was another, but that one hacked me off. There was an unfortunate accident with turpentine.”
“It was…” Potter halted beside him and hesitated to complete his sentence, no doubt searching for a banal reply of reassurance. Draco wasn’t happy to be right when Potter predictably announced, “I was… fine.”
“I’m not moping.” Still that vacant stare. Draco wondered if Potter actually saw something fascinating in that middle distance.
to have been there already, but it wasn’t visible.” With the nature of Malfoy’s impeccable efficiency and ridiculous attention to tiny details, Harry didn’t believe for a moment that Malfoy would’ve missed it. And there was the matter of Harry not being aware of it either; he’d read the whole contract over three times before he’d signed. And so had Hermione. “A hidden contingency plan, maybe? Something that would only magically reveal itself if you tried to bail on them? I can’t think of anything else. But however they did it, this was evidently intended to trap you. Hmm, maybe you should’ve become Chief Warlock when they asked you to.”
“Oh?” Harry asked, aiming to portray an expression of wide-eyed hapless Gryffindor as he silently worked to make his goal a reality. This would give his magic a safe, productive outlet and it might sate some of Harry's anger and anxiety at the same time. “What have you heard?” enquired Harry, slightly louder to mask the quiet crackle of his magic tracing the outer edges of the elaborate golden frame.
There was no mistaking Potter’s ‘wand’ nudging Draco’s arse. And the cause of a wet trail which slid along Draco’s neck, teasing his hairline, was also fairly clear. Potter’s tongue probed messily behind Draco’s ear, happening upon a distractingly sensitive spot and breaking Draco’s train of thought. Perhaps the intrusion wasn’t so intolerable, not that Draco would be rash enough to admit it.
There had been no application of lubricant. The luxury had been withheld ostensibly as Harry’s overdue ‘punishment’; however, Draco was aware of how happy Harry was to be fucked dry. And Harry knew that Draco similarly enjoyed it on occasion, or he wouldn’t partake in it. The controlled pain heightened their arousal to a different, aching, dirtier level of
Harry pulled in a lungful of air to compose himself; he didn’t like intentionally using his magic for destruction, it made him feel like a bad person. But experience had taught him to accept that it was sometimes necessary.
“Clearly, it does,” tutted Malfoy as he set his glass in front of him on Harry’s coffee table. “Or you’d be off with Wood to a Quidditch match at the weekend as the happy couple. I know you like him, so something else is wrong.”
Immersed in dreading the possible contents, Draco jumped slightly when the scroll slid up and off the nightstand and travelled through the air. Tracking its progress, Draco gaped when he realised that it was held in Potter’s fist. And something rather relevant was held in Potter’s other hand.
But Harry was confused. “Why do you suppose it wouldn’t respond to you, Draco? I mean… if it was created to extract bad memories. Everyone has those.”
Grey eyes flicked to the right, to the left, once again focussing on anywhere but Harry’s face. Harry was not reassured. He raised his right hand to brush over Draco’s cheek, then further back to sink his fingers into soft hair.
“Then Michael said that I should ask you to recommend him for Head of MLE. He said it was the least I could do, since I’d withdrawn my own application. I’d thought he’d be
“Yup. They informed me that I was committed to a magically binding contract which can’t be dissolved without serving the remainder of my term in Azkaban. And
Potter’s finger moved up to trace the curve of the snake. “A lot of things haven’t met my expectations.”
“What’s that?” Potter asked, pointing to the painstakingly written study plan which lay beside Draco’s bag.
He wasn’t alone. Ignoring the waiting owl, Harry raised his right hand, tugged the latch, and closed the window. Harry turned and walked to the bedroom door, made his way sluggishly along the short hallway, down the stairs to the ground floor, down another hallway which led to the back of the house, and found Draco sitting on the padded bench in the conservatory reading a book.
That was correct; Harry was not a fan of it. In fact, standing in a foyer that he recalled being previously
Confused by Potter’s sudden change of demeanour, Draco let his gaze follow the line of Potter’s stare. The design was plainly visible through the transparent fabric of Draco’s sodden shirt.
Craning his neck around, Harry watched as Draco raised the object, holding it horizontally near Harry’s bent lower body, almost as if he were comparing the length and visualising whether it would fit. Teasing, taunting, ruddy
“I might be able to help you with that.” Harry had done okayish with international relations. Sort of. “I know about International Diplomacy.” Harry wanted to feel useful to Draco but even as he spoke, his confidence was dwindling slightly. It might’ve been presumptuous to offer assistance. Draco wasn’t exactly helpless. “I know a little bit, anyway.”
. He wants you to work with him because you’re talented and knowledgeable. I had no idea what even half of the stuff that came out of the Manor was until you told me.”
, that was definitely four. Harry also began to feel what he was sure was Malfoy’s fist moving up and down against his side as Malfoy gripped his renewed erection with his other hand. Malfoy seemed to halt his inward progress at a shallow penetration, but Harry understood that; Malfoy was probably hesitant to force his hand in up to the knuckle with four since they hadn’t done this before. Not that Harry would’ve stopped him. But the lack of depth didn’t make it any less fantastic. Harry’s breaths sped up with excitement.
Harry was worried about Draco… Draco was worried about Harry… that could go around in circles for a while.
help. Nothing would sink Michael’s bid for this promotion deeper than Harry’s support of it. That thought was calming as Harry began to mentally compose a letter of fervent recommendation.

“Not at all. It’s all about coverage. Making sure that the entire surface from base to tip is liberally lubricated and snugly encased. And commitment to rigorous… buffing will be required for truly

is required anymore. But yours must be a boring existence if you’re reduced to eavesdropping and idle gossip.”
Harry still felt guilty about that. Although Harry had insisted that he needed to abide by the promise he’d made to assist Draco with selling his family estate, Draco had encouraged him to accept Luna’s offer of employment if he wanted it.
Lucius began to rant and rave above him, the predicament no doubt sinking in. Not paying much attention, Harry walked closer and took the time to admire the piece of furniture directly below the hanging portrait.
“And it doesn’t need to be. I would have suggested an establishment of a higher… calibre, however I expect you in
Malfoy puffed breaths of exertion above Harry for what seemed like long minutes before he moved away. Despite the denial of an orgasm, Harry was surprised at how satisfied he was. Once again, he waited, lids fluttering in contentment as he smiled and breathed deeply in the aftermath.
As they moved closer to the living room, Ron and George sounded like they were teaming up to fend off an enthusiastically affectionate Pygmy Puff. Harry smiled. It was probably just as well that Draco couldn’t knock him up, the family Harry already had was enough of a handful.
Draco couldn’t remember clearly anymore what his plan had been. As he descended the stairs towards the busy common room, he wasn’t convinced that he had improved the Potter situation, but Draco had certainly increased his own fears.
Now, as Harry further curved his spine away from Malfoy’s torso, only a strong grip on his hips kept Harry on Malfoy’s lap. If either of Malfoy’s hands slipped, Harry would end up on the floor. Although Harry’s tiptoes were connected enough with the tiles on either side of the kitchen chair to give him leverage to move his hips, the angle wouldn’t provide enough balance to prevent a backwards fall to the tiles.
Harry barked with laughter. Bloody hell, Harry loved him. Although he couldn’t say the words, it was no less true.
And his desperate condition ramped up another impossible notch when Malfoy’s other hand encased Harry’s balls. Rolling, teasing squeezing, lightly tugging on the hairs covering his sac.
He faltered again. Harry’s instincts were telling him not to speak of this, but he was determined to tell it and let Draco decide if he wanted to walk away once he understood how weak Harry was. So, Harry tried to push it all out in a rush, just wanting to get
“Potter, are you… under the impression that you’re my boyfriend now?” he rushed out the end of the sentence in a whoosh of unsteady breath, mortified to even be asking.
Harry didn’t bother to get off the bed. He unfastened his jeans and quickly rid himself of all lower garments which he kicked in a heap onto the floor. Draco was proceeding with his own undressing in a more leisurely manner. Keen to get hastily beyond this point, Harry yanked his t-shirt over his head and threw it in Draco’s direction.
Harry turned to face an equally naked Draco on the bed. Draco was up, certainly. If would be easy enough to slide back onto the mattress and take advantage of the perkiness of that lovely body, but the propect of the missive had mostly killed Harry’s amorous mood.
Harry waited for Luna to say more but she didn’t expand further. He’d been expecting follow-up questions and had been trying to determine how best to answer them.
A nudge to the left side of Draco’s ribs brought him out of his musings to notice that his breath was fogging Potter’s glasses.
The pause before Draco spoke was filled with Draco’s evident awkwardness and Harry’s forced patience. Eventually, Draco mumbled, “I felt… awkward about it. If people are only making offers to me because of you, it’s not very… flattering.”
Draco's laugh burst out before he could censor it. The action seemed to break the tension within him. Fine, let them try to be… something, and when it all went hideously wrong, at least Draco would be able to tell Potter that he’d been right. Draco did enjoy that type of thing.
“I know.” Malfoy smirked and shrugged. “But it’s a workable plan. Think about it. Alternatively, if you’re really going to pass up on the opportunity for office sex, you could go for a simpler approach. Don’t come into the office anymore. Don’t attend any meetings or conferences or any of the rest. Don’t
“Get back in bed,” Draco whispered before his throat became too dry for speech, scarcely managing not to tag, ‘please’ to the end of the instruction.
. Draco recalled the look of sheer despair that he’d frequently seen on Potter’s face and his worry expanded to fear.
Draco lifted his head far enough to peer down the length of Harry’s body. “No, that’s all Puff,” Draco snorted. “She’s becoming acquainted with your irresistible attributes.”
you.” Arse burning, face burning, and cock enclosed within blissful warmth that he wasn’t allowed to take advantage of, Harry felt very grateful indeed. Being denied control, willingly
Of course, it was hardly the first time he’d held Draco’s cock, but it was a new venture, nonetheless. Through role playing, Harry regularly had this penis in his hand, mouth, or arse; he knew every inch of it. But there were no instructions or demands here, only Harry’s exploration of the flesh which was rapidly hardening under his fingers.
Draco turned a little more into the mattress, concealing the part of him which had taken most keen notice of Potter’s intrusion. “Is there a particular reason why you’re not sweating all over your own bedding?”
The next sound which emerged from Harry’s throat was close to a purr when Draco wrapped his fist around Harry’s penis. Draco watched Harry’s face intently, and Harry revelled in the intensity of having Draco’s full attention as his cock began to refill in Draco’s hand.
Even as he recognised how stupid it was to stop this when he might’ve been coming down Potter’s throat soon, Draco was consumed with the need to ask another question. “What’s the
Malfoy to work with, but Harry’s choices were not always wise. As Malfoy liked to remind him. The sneers, the smirks, the typical looking down his perfectly pointed nose at everything Harry did. It was all too appealing sometimes.
“Actually, I think he already knew the answer. But he likes to keep information to himself until it benefits him. Hence the attempt at a deal. Although that was pitiful for him. Maybe the magic’s wearing off the paint or something.”
The sight of Malfoy’s smirking face above him was threatening to bring Harry too close to the edge, so he stretched his neck back, shifted his gaze towards the ceiling and whispered, “
you’re so powerful. If you relinquish control to someone, you’d be giving that person a gift. Bloody idiots, if they don’t see that.”
But Potter didn’t keep him waiting for long. “I’ve actually been… meaning to say something, Malfoy.”
“Yeah, maybe,” Harry answered. “Like you said, one day I might be looking for… someone like that. But you’d never put up with me for that long, Malfoy. I annoy you too much.”
Neither the dreadful duo nor the other Gryffindors pushed for further information. Foolish lions. Draco wondered if Potter’s friends really didn’t see past Potter’s camouflage, or if they didn’t care. Draco certainly didn’t, but it was interesting to observe, nonetheless.
Draco often watched him dress, living together made it hardly an unusual occurrence, but Harry was very aware of being intently studied by his audience tonight. The reason soon became clear.
“Oh.” A pause, then Potter breathed against Draco’s neck, “Snape taught it to me. And a couple of wandless healing charms. They’re useful in a sticky situation. But you probably know that.”
Just as Harry had commenced a frantic count of the lines that he could see in the woodgrain to distract from his once again looming orgasm, a sudden jolt startled him: it felt like Malfoy had used his fist to hammer the plug the rest of the way in.
been this good before. When he felt his balls meet Draco’s arse, Harry's eyes fell closed and his lips parted to pull in more air as the unexpected thrill of being inside Draco threatened to overwhelm him. Suddenly, Harry worried that this might not take very long. But not for the same reasons as in his efficient past.
As Malfoy lowered his hips between Harry’s thighs, Harry brought his legs off the bed towards his chest to better expose his hole for what he hoped would be shortly shoved into it.
In a vulnerable mindset, Harry’s instinctual response to the angry tone was to immediately offer apologies. “I’m
Rubbing his temple, Potter creaked out a kink in his spine. “Are you going to shove me back out of it?”
”. Draco held his hand in a motionless grip over the head of Potter’s cock as Potter came, letting semen seep through his fingers.
“I won’t do anything to him that you object to,” Draco agreed. “But I’m keeping all of it on reserve. Always good to have a plan B. And a plan C. And possibly… more.”
“No thanks,” Draco answered. Again, Potter looked baffled. The Weasel looked relieved. Draco just wanted to run away. He tried to tamper down the urge to sneer before he brushed past Potter to stride towards the stairs. “See you in class.”
disappoint Malfoy. He would obey and revel in the freedom from making decisions. Nothing else mattered other than pleasing the man in his mouth, and nothing was more pleasing to Harry.
No wonder Harry struggled to remember it. “Right. I don’t think Scipiones’ offer would have anything to do with me either, considering that I couldn’t get out of his smelly shop fast enough. And I never returned.”
But the truth was, Harry had been so busy with his job that he hadn’t had time to think about much else. Harry had worked from dawn until dusk and beyond, returning home for exhausted sleep. The brief relationships he’d managed to carve out slots in his life for had felt built on lies. In trying to please the men he dated, Harry had quickly given up on having what he really wanted. He’d essentially put his personal concerns on hold, and now he was acknowledging them, the issues he’d ignored were crashing down around him.
Knowing what Draco had to be referring to, Harry’s heart sank. This was going to be awful. But it was Draco who Harry was concerned about.
. Before people had decided he should always be in control. He hadn’t had much time to explore it properly, but enough to understand that it felt right. But Oliver had said
“There you go, then. I can face Weasley with my head held high.” Draco plucked up his jumper and slid it on. “And after events earlier tonight, you’ve nothing to be embarrassed about, either. Stride in there with pride.”
“Just… no teeth,” Draco said, laying as still as he could while Potter’s fingers tugged at the elastic.
, Harry’s brain wasn’t sure how he felt about that. Harry’s erection, on the other hand, gave an impatient jerk.
And with his brow furrowed as he gasped in air, Potter looked like he was conducting his own internal battle.
The inevitable wand double entendre: it had only been a matter of time. Harry’s new job offered so many obvious opportunities, Harry was astonished that it’d taken Draco three weeks to utter one. Amused, he decided to play along.
“I need a peacock feather for the wand I’m making tomorrow morning, Harry. Something to complement walnut wood and a… tempestuous temperament.”
. But maybe there was something… a way to use this opportunity. As far as most people were concerned, Harry had resigned as Minister for personal reasons; that was the official Ministry statement. His abrupt resignation had caused disparagement from the press and therefore resulting disapproval from some of the public, but as far as anyone was concerned, Harry was still on good terms with the Ministry of Magic. The Wizengamot had been careful not to publicly cut amicable ties with Harry Potter; it was too valuable to them.
The bell above the shop door jangled, and Harry’s head swung to the right to watch the door open and Draco step out into the street.
Potter hesitated, appeared to mull over the question. Draco didn’t rush him. “I… suppose,” he replied after a while. “Yes, a bit. Maybe. It’s… different with you.”
Malfoy spoke, sounding barely restrained. “I’ve placed a strong variety of ward around our offices to prevent any correspondence from getting in here. Special pompous Malfoy family magic, but it won’t hold the Ministry out for long. I strongly suggest you add some of that irritating power of yours to strengthen it.
Standing by himself, feeling kind of odd about that conclusion to their conversation, Harry walked over to see if he could assist.
The infraction didn’t appear to rile. “Hmm,” Malfoy hummed. “That was acceptable. I might even let you come.” Harry tried to convey his desire to do that in his appealing gaze. “Even you should be able to manage that. So, you'll come for me. Like this.” Malfoy emphasised his point by squeezing his fingers around Harry’s wrists. “I won’t wait long. I have better things to do.”
“That sounds… interesting. And precise.” As Harry imagined himself speared by something so big and unyielding, taking it all for Draco’s mocking amusement, it sounded
“Fine,” Draco drawled as he settled himself beside Potter on the edge of the bed. “You’re right… it’s none of my concern if you’ve been polishing the Weasel’s shaft or buggering him into any available surface for years.” Potter made a peculiar choking sound. It’d been a throwaway comment to rile his opponent, but Potter’s reaction prompted Draco to ask, “
Potter beamed. “Sounds interesting. Can I see it?” The parchment was in Potter’s hand before Draco could protest. “You’re interested mostly in Potions, right?”
“He wanted me on top, kept asking, and I kept declining, encouraging us to do other things. I’d topped plenty of times before when men had been insistent about it, even though I don’t… like it. And I’ve done it since then because that’s… the only way anyone wanted me. But I didn’t want my relationship with him to be built on the same type of pressure I’d experienced from other men. It felt like that would’ve been too big a lie. But I also didn’t want to disappoint him any
“If you two are going to hump on the ottoman, I think I should be going now,” said Ron from the doorway.
He breathed deep, studying the emeralds and marble with a new depth of loathing. Removing a memory, even a terrible one, would take a part of who a person was. Pensieves were created to hold and view extracted memories, but they were designed to be a temporary storage. And normal Pensieves wouldn’t try to
until a sudden snapping ring echoed in the room, causing him to jump at the unexpected sound. Harry hoped that it might indicate success.
Something was wrong. But as Draco emerged gradually from the drowsiness of sleep, he couldn’t determine quite what it was.
Firstly, Harry wondered when they had become officially labelled as ‘cohabiting’, even though he couldn’t remember the last time Draco had spent a night in his own flat. Harry wasn't complaining about that though. Secondly, Harry was hardly a wandmaker. Assisting with customer enquiries and purchases and fielding passes from pensioners did not make Harry a skilled craftsperson.
Harry wasn’t like other people though. “Maybe not usually. But with me, people expect… better. It doesn’t matter.”
Noting the pallid appearance of Malfoy’s face with dismay, Harry nodded, keeping his further gratitude silent. Beginning to fidget awkwardly, he didn’t know what to do with his hands or how to stand in a pose that looked less feeble than he felt.
“No,” Harry laughed, “I didn’t. It’s what my aunt would’ve called… this.” He ran his fingers through the plush purple. Still detested everything about it.
if you really want to. If you’ve managed to get an idea into your head that I’ve somehow suggested it or expect it, then you can forget that right now.” The tone of Draco’s voice stressed the seriousness of his assertion.
“Don’t…” Harry started, but he trailed off, failing to find words that didn’t sound as desperate as he felt. “Don’t,” he repeated, shaking his head. “It’s not worth it.”
The response from Malfoy was a nod, followed by the replacing of his glass on the table as he regarded Harry.
“Yes, I… apparently.” Potter looked unconvinced. “I don’t know what I want though. I used to want to be an Auror, but… no. I’ve had enough of… that.”
adored. “Bend over the bureau. Hands on the wall.” It took mere seconds for Harry to happily comply, palms poised on the wallpaper below the covered frame. “That’s nice,” assessed Malfoy. “What a lovely arse, prime for the taking. I’ll fuck you into my father’s favourite furniture and we’ll let him watch you spurt your cock onto the fine mahogany. I think that vision would stay with him for eternity.”
you’ve earned it.” Harry opened his mouth to protest, but Draco warned, “If you speak, it will only delay me. Remain on your knees, precisely as you are. Any deviation from this position will be regarded as blatant disobedience and I shall be extremely disappointed.”
Harry stared at the floor tiles between his knees and let himself drift in the bliss of anticipation. Malfoy wouldn’t have put him here for no reason. With a shiver, Harry looked forward to finding out what that might be.
Slightly confused by where this was leading, Harry nevertheless shuffled closer and swung his left leg over Malfoy’s prostrate body to shift himself into a straddling position, but he couldn’t bring himself to sit on Malfoy. That didn’t seem right. The implied dominance of Harry’s position made him nervous, so he knelt motionless, thighs spread wide over Malfoy’s body.
Very reassuring. He wasn’t sure how he felt about being an object of adoration. But they were harmless old ladies. Probably. And he supposed that going directly from Minister for Magic to retail could be perceived as peculiar career development. Harry had badly needed the change though.
Draco curled up on his chest. The position was the reverse of their familiar dynamic and it had previously caused Harry to feel uncomfortable whenever they’d tried it. Confused, but not feeling an urge to correct the anomaly, Harry decided there’d be time to analyse it later.
Draco’s wand was drawn and pointed at Michael even as he absorbed the situation, evidently readying an attack. Harry reached out his right hand towards Draco, palm to the side in a placating gesture, and slowly shook his head.
him. But Harry’s mind had been saturated with the need to punish himself… is that what his magic had
that care through his actions. There was always a possibility that it wasn’t genuine, but Draco had given him
The vibrating thrusts inside him lengthened, expertly hitting Harry’s prostate on every stroke. This time, Harry moved to complement the motion, planting his feet securely onto the mattress and bucking against the object, lifting his bum off the bed as he embraced what he was feeling and finally let go with a scream of release, shooting out his own climax to mix with Draco’s.
“I needed a minute,” he explained, noting a hopeful glint in Potter’s gaze, but Potter’s body remained in that strange balance between defeated resignation and urgency to leave.
After a little while, Malfoy spoke again above him. “Take a moment to think, Harry. As I repeatedly need to urge you -
be any lower than the opinion he had of himself. Harry was working on that though. And he wanted to move on, to learn to trust and be able to rely upon others, at least sometimes. He needed to give people that chance.
Harry straightened his shoulders, found his resolve. “That’s not your decision to make.” Harry didn’t want all this dredged up. He wanted to put it
“Harry,” said Draco, “what can you feel about the difference between this,” he pointed to the closed box, “and this one,” he indicated a beautifully decorated six-inch square box carved from marble and inlaid with emeralds.
Harry’s wrists were claimed and pinned together behind his back at the same moment that Malfoy grunted and roughly impaled him again.
Harry wasn’t prepared to move on that issue. He opened his mouth to argue, but quickly decided that he didn’t want to. His defences were rising, and the screaming match that this discussion was likely to descend to wasn’t worth it.
“You think so?” Potter’s comeback hadn’t sounded nearly as confident or dismissive as he’d probably intended.
Yup, that’s what Harry was afraid of. Harry regarded the wistful, eager expression on the customer’s face and prayed that he wouldn’t be allowed anywhere near her or her wand.
“Do you have an ache?” asked Draco as his fingers lightly traced the line of Harry’s waistband. Harry nodded. “May I look?” He nodded again. “Use your words,” prompted Draco.
“Not for a second. Well, not after you accidentally snapped my mum’s broom in half. I figured that I was onto a winner after that. I see you’ve bought her a nice one to replace it.”
“Yes,” Harry answered, “Michael would be perfect to head the MLE, Ron. And it’s… time I think, for us all to move on.” Surprised that he hadn’t suffocated on the words, Harry aimed to present a genuine, friendly smile. He tried to remember how he used to look at this man when he’d been his best friend. When Harry had felt able to rely on him.
Granger’s attention from across the table had clearly been caught. Draco imagined that Weasley would eventually catch up once he emerged from his mountain of eggs and bacon.
Dropping an incomplete, magically unstable wand didn’t seem any better a choice than hanging on to it.
Yes, Draco did. He’d told Potter that in answer to his inane questions often enough. Draco was tempted to ask if that’s what the apprenticeship would focus on. But that hardly seemed the point since Potter was either taking the piss or
.” Chuckling, Harry nodded and allowed Draco to arrange them how they’d previously been on the bed, Harry’s head on Draco’s chest. “So, Luna tells me that I should ask you how your day went. Not that I wouldn’t have asked anyway.”
Harry did know. He didn’t want to get into it though; he was working at putting that kind of thing behind him, so instead he said, “You’re a merciless and cruel bastard, Draco. That was bloody
“That’s better. Since I’m now cohabiting with a wandmaker, you need to get into the spirit of things.”
,” Lucius growled, pointedly looking at Draco. “If… you ensure that I’m placed in an appropriate setting.”
“Bloody hell, your previously shagging partners have been rubbish,” Malfoy snorted, breaking from his role. It didn’t last for long. “But you’re mine now. I’m going to instruct you. Just do
“Exactly. There you go then. You could be completely rubbish. Shouldn’t be too hard for you,” Malfoy chuckled. “Or… I understand that you have an annoyingly persistent female friend who specialises in obscure and complicated legal stuff and would leap at the chance to take on the Wizengamot on your behalf. And what she doesn’t know, I’m sure she’ll bore us to death with as she finds out. So, you have choices. Option one or two or boring three, Potter. You decide. I vote for number one, it would surely be the most enjoyable.”
Desperate to voice an angry or pleading question regarding Draco’s absence and his supposed preferred occupation, but unwilling to risk it, Harry settled for raising an eyebrow in Draco’s direction. Living with Draco had taught him a few nifty facial expressions.
Certain that the incriminating memo would not continue for long in existence, but unable to speak through his rising anger, he thrust it out towards Malfoy, urgently urging him to read quickly.
The fingers pressed, stroked, pressed, stroked, relentless inside him as Malfoy swallowed and sucked and drove Harry towards the edge.
this, but it would require a massive leap of faith. There was so much past animosity that could turn it into something awful. But Harry reminded himself that people may be misguided about many aspects of him, but they weren’t wrong about one: Harry
“It’s fine. Do what you want,” Draco quietly said as he stood. The effort which this constant restraint required was going to kill him, he just knew it.
“If you do, you might like to help me in the shop,” Luna announced. “As, you know… a job. Now that you’re done with that silly Minister business.”
it. The bastard’s going to go to jail soon, then we can have a celebration before we forget about his pathetic arse and get on with our lives.”
Draco should’ve moved away. He shouldn’t have been standing still and defenceless when Potter’s hands reached for him again. And Draco certainly should
Hermione fidgeted with the cup on the table in front of her. “There has been a fun new personal… development for me, I suppose.”
A distant part of Draco’s mind began to holler at him that this harassment of his sponsor could be a direct route to expulsion. But Draco was strangely confident that however this panned out, Potter would not be running to the Headmistress to relate the story.
that type of internal vision. It’d felt so real. And the mocking laugh as Harry’s hips had unwillingly continued to thrust into Michael’s body had been utterly convincing.
Maybe Draco should stop providing Potter with ammunition to throw back in his face. “I know, but I’m asking anyway.”
“And you can relate the tale of your thrilling day," she said with a wink at Harry. “Remember not to leave out anything… intriguing.”
It took Harry only an instant to let go of his restraint and allow his orgasm to spill out with a bellowing yell and a jolt of relief. As Harry shuddered through the aftershocks, the wetness which splattered on his side indicated that Malfoy had been as close as he was.
Draco gave a damn still remained beyond him. Perhaps he would simply have to accept it as an unfortunate fact.
“Nope.” Harry wasn’t sure if he felt more relieved than disappointed. “We’re going to take Weasley’s sage advice and relocate to the rug.” Draco’s grin was edging towards devious. “That way, I can inform him in detail later exactly how his suggestion played out.”
Harry was more than game for that. “Please,” he begged as Malfoy’s fingers held their stretch inside him. “
“And? You’ve experienced a traumatic stalking incident by an ex and are in need of the comforting haze of alcohol.”
In a flash of epiphany, Harry understood; that’s why Malfoy had described it as a gift. Because Harry couldn’t be forced. Any amount of submission from him would need to be given completely willingly.
tended to provoke negative memories regarding men he’d dated and their expectations regarding Harry’s perceived role. And Michael had been
“I want you to use me,” Harry whispered. Scared to voice it louder, lest the potential be somehow shattered. “Please.”
Draco was looking at Harry quizzically. Harry hadn’t told Draco about the conversation with his father during their first visit to the Manor together when Lucius had made it clear that he knew about Michael and used the knowledge to taunt Harry. Resolving to try harder at this communication business later, Harry waited for Lucius’ next words. They’d best be decent, or Harry was going to lose patience.
“Don’t worry,” appeased Draco with an unnerving smile. “If the wrong people turn up, they’ll wish they hadn’t.”
Draco didn’t speak, instead he stroked Harry’s hair with that same gentle touch. None of this felt fair to Draco.
“From what Ron’s told me, they’re not going to be switching it off again,” said Hermione. “You did a good thing.”
Harry winced as he moved his arms from the position he’d been holding them in for so long, but he forced himself to drop to all fours, turned upon the carpet and approached as directed. Crawling was another new experience for Harry. It was definitely humiliating; he felt his cheeks flush as he crawled with his erection swinging beneath him like an eager pendulum. When he reached Malfoy, Harry resumed a kneeling position and rested his hands on his thighs.
Feet on the floor and his back on the low ottoman, Harry watched as Draco knelt between his spread thighs. Hands on his hips yanked Harry towards Draco until his bum perched on the edge. Draco lined up their growing bulges, and Harry began to appreciate how this could be interesting… but they weren’t alone in the building. Harry was just about to remind Draco of that fact when his intervention was rendered redundant.
Potter’s spreading grin was disturbingly chilling. “Look who’s developing a ruddy hero complex. Trying to save me are you, Malfoy?”
Potter nodded. “Okay. How about this… if you don’t ask me to pretend that I’m happy, I won’t ask you to pretend to be happy either.”
“Well… yes,” Harry answered. Trying to deny it wouldn’t be productive, he supposed. “That’s usually what happens now. Men tell me what needs improving and I try really hard to… improve it.”
Draco lifted his chin. “No, you certainly cannot. But…” Draco sighed. "My family’s always been here. In Wiltshire. In this
He was still internally enjoying Draco’s excitement when a wave of Draco’s wand and a murmured charm swung the door shut. Draco shoved his wand back in his sleeve, stepped forward, gripped both of Harry’s buttocks through his jeans and pulled Harry’s front flush with Draco’s.
it when he did that. The primal expression of completion almost ripped out Harry's climax with Malfoy's, but Harry frantically delved deep for willpower and somehow prevented it.
“Good,” Ron said, looking disturbingly pleased with himself. “Should I come through now and join you?”
Evenings in the common room had also become a duller experience. Potter no longer attempted to include Draco in conversations or activities, so Draco sat alone and undisturbed while he studied. It was exactly what Draco had wanted, but he hadn’t expected peace to be so boring. And the newfound solitude might’ve been easier to enjoy if he hadn’t noticed that Potter was also still not talking to anyone else.
Harry added another, “Thank you,” before he bent forward to direct Malfoy’s penis into his mouth. Other men didn’t even feel comfortable letting Harry do
When Draco lay on his back beside him and opened his legs in invitation, Harry forced himself to remember that he wasn’t alone in this. Draco shifted his spine, getting comfortable, so Harry sat up and relocated himself to kneel between Draco’s open legs, feeling awkward about the reversal of roles.
new… but I’d been in love with Michael for a long while before we got together.” For some reason, it was easier to say that he’d been in love with Michael than it was to admit that he was currently in love with Draco. “I’d thought, and he’d said that he… but he wasn’t. Maybe he was just mistaken… people make mistakes. Stupid of me to believe that he did. There was no reason for him to think so highly of me.” Draco took a step towards him, and Harry shook his head again, raising his still wringing hands in front of his chest as a barrier. “I don’t want to be touched right now,” Harry said. If Draco touched him, Harry was going to start crying. “I’m sorry,” he whispered.
, I think I might’ve been Michael’s insurance policy. If he didn’t get the position, he’d still be able to control the department through me if I was promoted.”
The importance of completing his education was paling into insignificance in comparison to the daily grind of life at Hogwarts. This venture often seemed pointless; Draco’s future would remain uncertain, even if he successfully graduated top of all his classes. The stigma of being a Malfoy would always be with him. Draco would forever be tainted in the eyes of the public, no matter how he performed this coming year.
The kiss gradually slowed, became soothing licks and gentler caresses until their mouths parted and reality found Harry again.
“Oh, nothing much. He got testy. Called me Loony. I don’t like it when people do that. It’s not kind.” No, Harry silently concurred, it wasn’t. “The nargles told me that some people don’t deserve to use magic and that you would know if I was right not to allow him to have one.”
Another tiny nudge at Harry’s anus, but Draco still didn’t attempt to penetrate him. Or respond to Harry’s request. Draco’s brow was furrowed, and he seemed as unsure as Harry whether or not to continue. So disturbingly distant. Almost as if Draco were lost in his own thoughts and had forgotten what his intentions were. Or couldn’t decide on the best course of action.
Ron and Draco actually took three hasty steps back from the desk before Harry allowed the box to burst into flames. The fire only lasted for several seconds before extinguishing as quickly as it’d begun. In the aftermath, there was no evidence that the box had ever been there. The desk wasn’t charred, and none of the other boxes had sustained harm. Harry vaguely wondered why his hands had been damaged by his last magical fire. But he supposed that was the difference between accidental, emotion-driven magic and controlled,
“So, you should be,” Malfoy agreed as he pulled his cock back outwards, keeping the hold on Harry’s hair. It felt like Harry’s insides might be dragging out with him. Almost intolerable, amazing friction, the direction of which abruptly reversed as Malfoy snapped his hips forward and proceeded to give Harry the buggering of his life.
Relieved at this apparent return to normality, Harry chuckled as he followed Malfoy through the study door into the corridor but after only a few paces, Malfoy came to a dead stop in front of him.
Regretting his honesty, Harry imagined a wide variety of both brutally direct and delicately cruel methods which Draco could utilise to effectively deal with something when suitably compelled to. But it was strange; Harry didn’t know whether to feel terrified of what Malfoy might do or glad that he had a person who cared enough to defend him.
Draco didn’t seem interested in the contents of the Manor right now. Instead, he was scrutinising Harry’s face.
Sighing, he shook his head. “I spoke to the Wizengamot. I resigned.” It hadn’t gone well. “I don’t think they believed I was serious at first. They kept telling me to sleep on it, that it wasn’t really what I wanted, despite the official resignation that I handed them with my signature all over it. They went on about duty and obligation. How much the public need someone that they can rely on.” That’s how he’d let them guilt him into this role in the first place. And today, the Members had lectured Harry about mature responsibilities for over an hour, all the time regarding him with such collective expressions of disappointment that Harry had almost told them to forget he’d ever mentioned it. But he’d refused to give in to that temptation. That’s when events had taken a truly nasty turn. “When I insisted that I
! Should I make it thicker? How well did the thrusting charm work?” George asked, loud and frighteningly eager.
“And I know Ron’s glad that you’re willing to speak with him today,” said Molly with an encouraging maternal smile.
Draco gripped fistfuls of the bedsheet and frantically clenched his leg muscles around Harry’s shoulders as Harry resumed his rhythm from his raised vantage point. But Harry would keep him safe. It was more difficult to maintain the accuracy of his movements, but the steeper angle was advantageous to achieving greater depth and pressure, and that made the extra effort more than worthwhile. And it seemed a popular choice for both of them. Harry bowed his head, shaking hair from his sweaty forehead, his thighs trembling with exertion and self-control.
. Not at all. If he moved the wrong way, at the wrong angle or pace, Malfoy would be displeased. In a strange way, this
Potter raised his head but stared straight ahead at the drapes. That look of despair was back in his eyes.
Wondering what he was doing wrong, Harry looked down. Malfoy had an intent expression which Harry couldn’t interpret. And that look was directed at Harry’s groin. Following Malfoy’s pointed stare, Harry saw that the tip of his bouncing penis was liberally weeping precum. Of course, it fucking was. Harry had been so busy, he hadn’t considered the obvious danger. Not that he could’ve prevented it.
But Draco had promised Harry a vibrator, and Harry wasn’t sure how it vibrated. What Draco held was surely more of a dildo. There was no obvious source of power attached to it. Not that Harry was complaining, it looked suitably big to do the job.
. Draped naked over a snoring Draco, soothed by the rumbling noise against his cheek, arms tucked around Draco’s chest and their legs tangled together, Harry didn’t want to get up.
“It would seem that my reputation as your fabulously competent and efficient Personal Assistant has not waned in my absence.”
A cough sounded in Harry’s ear. Harry was about to turn when he caught the reflection of the man standing directly behind him.
Harry didn’t really understand how he helped Draco. It always seemed to him that Draco was a force of independence. But he wasn’t given time to contemplate further as Draco nudged him to sit up straighter, providing space between them to better access Harry’s clothing.
When Draco turned his head to look at Harry, his eyes were wide and watery. Draco nodded in the direction of the frame.
“Isn’t that the eternal question? Get off your lazy arse and find out,” Draco taunted, turning his back on Potter and striding towards the portrait hole. Potter would either follow, or he wouldn’t.
“I… wondered. I mean, I had an… idea about something we could do, and I thought maybe… but no, it’s stupid and you wouldn’t want to, anyway.”
. Could you hear me telling you that?” During his panic, Harry hadn’t been able to. He shook his head and Malfoy sighed. “From my father’s warped point of view, he’d
. But even as his mind supplied that assertion, he understood that most people don’t feel the need to do
. Without vision, the only indications of whether his efforts were appreciated were the noises emanating from below him. Harry listened carefully as he buggered himself,
Harry rolled his eyes. “That’s not a get out of jail free card, you know,” he grumbled, even though the declaration had ensured Draco’s metaphorical freedom.
As Potter’s brain was obviously having difficulty coping with the pressure, Draco spoke slowly, enunciating each word with care. “Who have you given a hand job?”
“Don’t worry, Harry. They only adore you. And they don’t usually get the opportunity to see you up close. It’s… fascinating to them, that you’re here. But it’ll calm down eventually once they’ve got the thrill out of their system.”
Michael didn’t answer. Harry hadn’t expected him to and didn’t want to hear what he’d say anyway. But there was something Harry did need to know. A matter more important to Harry than Michael.
Harry didn’t want anyone, even a portrait of Lucius, to be trapped in a room with their worst fears.
They stood there together for a while; Harry’s face tucked down against Draco’s neck. Harry inhaled the scent of security until his breathing slowed. Draco didn’t speak, instead he simply held Harry until he was ready to re-emerge.
Let Draco use him. Yes… that’s what Harry wanted right now. More badly even than his desire to come. Nodding, Harry lay still as Draco placed his palms on the mattress and stretched long legs behind himself, nudging at Harry’s feet in a silent instruction to part. Harry obediently spread his thighs, making room for Draco to settle between them.
“If you want, there is something else we could do,” said Draco. Harry glanced up at him quizzically but didn’t move his head from its perch. “I also have a letter I could send. If I do, I don’t think Corner’s week would improve. It might not be necessary now, but the option’s there.”
Draco delved into his reserves to present his most practiced smirk as Potter turned to leave. “See you shortly.”
Swiftly complying, Harry felt Malfoy’s fingers dig into his buttocks, and gasped in alarm when he realised Malfoy was beginning to stand. As he was raised higher, Harry’s instinctive move was to wrap his legs around Malfoy’s waist for security. But Malfoy didn’t relocate them far. Malfoy took a single step forward, turned to his right, and another step before Harry felt himself deposited on his back upon the kitchen table.
“I know that I’ve said this before, but you don’t need to be doing this. Let someone else stress over all this crap. And I thought your first meeting this morning was meant to be the first step in arranging that. I spent ages completing that paperwork for you. Didn’t you give it to them?”
Harry’s exhausted cock was trying to get back in the game, but at the rate Malfoy was buggering him, it wasn’t going to happen before this was over. And it didn’t
easy to fall into the temptation to allow this box to erase all the hurt… let it take and take and take… until the essence of a person eventually disappeared.
,” Harry growled. “They’ll be hearing my opinion on that.” The bowl stilled. He was getting better at reining in his accidental magic by expressing himself more honestly before it could escalate. Definitely better.
Harry allowed his hopes to rise. He would be obedient, obliging and humble and in return he would get what he needed.
He’d expected to be there for a while before Malfoy acknowledged him again and he wasn’t incorrect. Harry’s knees were complaining about the position long before he heard Malfoy move on the mattress. That wasn’t unusual; Malfoy often liked to leave Harry kneeling to contemplate his existence. Harry rather enjoyed it. But what Harry was contemplating today was what his punishment would be. During their encounters, he hadn’t previously done anything which might warrant a punishment. He’d earned extra helpings of derision, certainly, but this was the first incident of outright disobedience, however accidental it had been.
Gasping through his growing arousal, but suddenly not at all in a hurry to win, Harry nuzzled his face into Draco’s neck again. Harry mouthed the skin he found there, loving the contrast of smooth skin and scratchy stubble under his lips and tongue. He nipped the skin at Draco’s throat experimentally and could
Potter’s fingers encircled the base of Draco’s cock, the side of his hand brushing against pubic hair as Potter held Draco’s shaft securely.
Harry was fucking terrified. But he was also shaking with lust and love and a desire to be connected to Draco in this new way. To
Surreptitious peeks over his textbooks in the common room had revealed intriguing information. Although Potter faithfully sat with his two best friends, the angle of Potter’s body was often no longer pointed towards them. Granger, Weasley and other random Gryffindors often had to nudge Potter to gain his attention, and Potter’s input into the inane conversations was becoming conducted with considerably less animation than before.
When Ron nodded, Draco continued as he drew his wand. “They have fantastic… facilities which a man of such a
Draco burrowed himself further into the back of the chair, trying to hide behind his potions text and ignore both the latest blatant attempt at coercion and the resulting glares from the other occupants of the room.
to know what it keeps them for. It doesn’t seem designed for viewing memories like a Pensieve bowl, too small.” Draco’s brow was furrowed in concern. “I didn’t… let it do anything,” Harry added. “But I could… see the appeal. It wanted to take… a lot. Too much. It’s not exactly hostile but it seems dangerous, all the same.”
“Harry?” Sniffing, Harry tried to calm himself and monitor his breathing before his magic started to become a problem yet again. Judging by the tears dripping off the end of his nose, he wasn’t doing a great job of that either. “Harry?” Malfoy’s worried voice now came from right in front of Harry, level with his bowed head.

Potter’s wide eyes examined Draco’s nudity with nervous interest. Anticipating disaster, Draco took note of each miniscule inflection of Potter’s tone when he next spoke.
“Okay…” Draco sighed, his lengthy exhale ruffling Harry’s fringe. Draco still looked confused when Harry didn’t further elaborate. Harry couldn’t blame him for that. “Then, I’m trying to decide whether dinner with Weasley would be a bad or good idea. I’m going to need your help with that.”
Harry quickly clasped his fingers together at the base of his spine. Denied proper use of his hands, he worried that this venture could go horribly wrong.
Harry panted louder with excitement when Malfoy’s cock nudged against his hole. As he felt a familiar, strong hands grip both his hips, Harry locked what little stance he had and braced himself. The thick cock pressed inwards, becoming more relentless as it popped through the ring of his anus and pushed, pushed,
!” It hadn’t hurt; the rug was too soft for that, but he’d rather not have dropped from that height without at least some warning. “Bloody
Draco’s anger hadn’t outwardly displayed again, but Harry felt that the resulting calm could be likened to watching a dormant but dangerous wild animal as it surveyed the landscape, calculating the distance to prey. Lying patiently in wait to make a move at the right moment. But Draco was also waiting for Harry’s confirmation, and Harry wasn’t about to serve the prey on a platter. Increasingly tempted though Harry had become to step back and allow Draco to do what he felt he needed to within reason, he didn’t want to actively encourage carnage.
Draco’s fingers pushed further into Harry’s body, and Harry’s eyes widened as he realised exactly what they were going to aim for.
“I’m… not sure that’d be a great idea,” Harry offered, wanting to stop this endeavour before it gained any popularity. But he was struggling to think of a reason to refuse which wouldn’t sound childishly stubborn. Maybe Harry
“Didn’t you get much sleep last night? I’ve always thought that Wood might be a roaring tiger in bed.” Malfoy's voice sounded gleeful.
…” Harry ran out of steam. He took a deep breath instead and tried to pretend that his hands weren’t shaking. “Lunch tomorrow then,” Harry said as he handed Draco the letter. It was the easiest way to pass on the details without rattling his nerves further by talking about it.
That was ridiculous, Harry wasn’t going to… but he did feel a bit dizzy. He took a deep, controlled breath. Then another. Another.
“No,” Harry snorted, starting to remember that there was more to his life now than moping. The dead of night was often the worst time for bringing that on; silence provided too much time to think. Harry tried to shake it off. “Burning is too final. We could maybe find another place to hang him though.”
. It’s not unreasonable to expect to be safe with someone who’s meant to care for you. Or to expect your friend to listen and stand by you.”
He listened to the quiet pats of Malfoy’s shoes as he approached, and polished footwear soon entered Harry’s field of vision.
. If I’d wanted you to be forced to stay under your family’s influence, then I wouldn’t have pushed so hard for you to be able to attend school this year.”
Harry’s hands were clasped firmly at the small of his back as he pushed his arse into Malfoy’s groin, Harry’s erection bobbing between them as he thrusted. It was really more of a rocking, swivelling grind than a thrusting, but the result was creating a wonderful, almost intolerable drag of Malfoy’s girth on his inner walls.
Fighting the urge to pull his arm to his chest, hide the Mark, Draco stood carefully, each motion designed to be controlled, non-threatening… something which he’d never imagined that he’d take care to be for Potter’s benefit. Potter appeared to be becoming more conflicted by the second, but there was no point in hiding. Potter would need to accept what Draco was, or this would need to end.
about it. Between horrible honesty, helpful nargles, judgmental oil paint and a terrifying boggart, Harry felt like this was turning out to be a weirdly disconcerting week. And he hadn’t even got to trying to discover the truth about Ron yet. Mostly because Harry was stalling on that issue.
Anger flared in Draco’s eyes for a second, before his expression changed back to concern. Harry clenched his eyes shut. He wanted to
“Well… okay.” Malfoy nodded. “If you’re sure that you want to.” It was Harry’s turn to nod. “No pressure to stick with it though, once you realise how boring it might be.”
Harry hoped for the opposite. He recalled that from the day Michael had entered Auror training, he’d dreamed of one day being Head of MLE. Before that, even. Now Harry had a vicious
Uncertain, his heart pounding, Harry raised his head so he could properly ascertain Draco’s reaction as he chanced his answer. “Yes, Daddy.”
The remainder of Harry’s confirmation stuttered in his throat when Malfoy paused, rotated his hips, and pushed in at a deliberately different angle.
Sinking unhurriedly deeper with shallow, careful thrusts, experiencing the tight grip, Harry realised that Draco’s wasn’t the only pleasure to consider today. Fuck… Harry didn’t think the act of penetrating someone had felt like this… it wasn’t… it
“I’m fine, Draco.” The grey eyes narrowed in doubt. “A bit… tender, but I don’t want that gone yet.”
“No…” Harry answered, mentally reviewing the many words he’d hastily poured over after the meeting when he’d been searching for a loophole. “It’s not. As long as I’m
Harry’s breath was starting to stutter as it became harder to pull in air. Quickly, he opened his eyes and reminded himself who he was with. He was safe here… but maybe it would be
“He can't hear us,” Harry clarified. Lucius Malfoy was now enclosed within a pitch-black, soundless prison. It gladdened Harry’s heart.
Potter fidgeted with the blanket for a few moments before he released it with a small but oddly forceful motion of his fingers.
was fairly accurate, if understated. But, as far as Luna should’ve been concerned, it was none of Harry’s business whether or not she sold Michael a wand. Ollivanders was her livelihood, after all. And she was brilliant enough at her craft not to require Harry’s input.
Harry didn’t know how long had passed before Draco nudged his cheek. Opening his eyes, Harry inhaled a steadying breath as Draco said, “I know that this is a… dangerous topic.” Harry sensed the inevitable coming as Draco continued, “And I think that I already know the answer, but I need you to tell me. Was it Weasley?”
obvious. You, on the other hand tend to be a people-pleasing wildcard. I used to think it was peculiar, but I get it now.”
“You didn’t. I don’t think I was sleeping well, either. Yesterday was… there was a lot going on at the Weasley home.”
Two more requests from Hermione for them all to go out together had been declined by Harry. He was curious about how her persistence was being received by Ron. Harry couldn’t imagine that Ron would want to see
Draco chuckled softly as he watched Harry attempt to settle comfortably but fail to find any relief. And Draco was still smiling with amusement as he climbed up to kneel on the mattress, swung a leg over and sat on Harry’s thighs. The additional weight pushed Harry’s arse more firmly into the bed and the volume of his groan almost hurt his throat.
me is more than enough, Harry.” Doubtful, Harry frowned. “When I was young, my father used to tell me that he loved me. And… well.” Draco shrugged. “Look at what you’ve
“That’s correct. You have only what I’m willing to give you.” His back to Malfoy, Harry knelt motionless as Malfoy reached around him to move the bottle, glasses and Harry’s other possessions from the table. That seemed fairly promising.
“Look at you,” Malfoy snarled from behind him. “Come dripping out of your arse like the whore you are, Potter.”
“Of course, you do. Just because you don’t need to use a wand anymore doesn’t mean that you don’t understand how the magic works. It means that you understand it
Harry liked it fine in here, but Hermione would only hunt him down. Grumbling quietly, he peeled himself reluctantly from Draco and headed for the bathroom, noting that Draco wasn’t shifting
A shudder ran down Harry’s spine, distracting him until Malfoy kicked at his feet and growled, “Get your thighs apart.” Criticism followed Harry’s attempt. “Do you really think that’s far enough?” Harry tried again, but his restrictive clothing wasn’t allowing for much spreading of his legs. “Well, I suppose that’s the best I can expect from someone as useless as you.”
Resting his dry left palm on Draco’s inner thigh, Harry moved his right hand to Draco’s arse, tracing the groove of the crack, feeling the soft warmth of Draco’s skin. After a moment’s hesitation, he cautiously pushed deeper, seeking the hole within, watching Draco’s expression for any sign of objection. He found none. Draco’s eyes were heavily lidded but alert with something that could be anticipation.
But this continuous background of brooding Potter was affecting Draco’s personal sense of wellbeing and endangering his sponsorship, therefore it was reasonable to take action.
Ron looked questioningly at Harry, but Harry urged him on with a wave. Draco wouldn’t have requested Ron’s absence for no reason.
