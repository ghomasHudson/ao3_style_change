“Well thank you. I shall enjoy this in a moment but first I have something to give you.” Draco turned back to him and looked a little nervous but also excited.
Draco gestured towards the door and Blaise and Daphne turned back towards it but not before having a good look at Harry’s kitchen.
“Here go to your godfather Rosie so that your mother can hit me.” Ron said grimacing and handing Rose over to Harry who happily accepted her and drew her in close to give her a kiss on the forehead. It had been a week since he’d seen her and he hadn't cuddled her at all last Sunday.
He ran into the sea laughing feeling happy and carefree for the first time in ages. Draco was there besides him in no time splashing him and then overtaking him to do deeper into the sea. Biscuit was happily swimming alongside him but Harry hung back a bit just enjoying standing waist deep in the sea. He was watching Draco swim over the gentle waves effortlessly and go further out into the ocean with confidence. It seemed like he was graceful in everything he did with perfect control over his limbs.
Harry had a good relationship with his direct boss but he still wasn’t sure if he really liked him or not. No doubt he was a good auror and a good leader, he had a great respect for Kingsley and he really cared about the Ministry and doing the right thing. He inspired the team and generally he was very fair, however, like many he had a bit of a soft spot for Harry which annoyed him a bit. He just wanted to be a normal part of the team and treated the same as everyone else but Auror Robards tended to think that Harry could do no wrong. He still treated Harry like the Saviour or The Chosen One and looked him at like he was the prized possession of the department.
“Well I can give you a hand if you want? Get them done quicker?” Harry offered genuinely.
“Anyway” Potter carried on. “She’s insanely clever and really career driven. She works at the Ministry as deputy head of the Regulation and Control of Magical Creatures department. She’s passionate about justice and helping others, I think Kingsley is grooming her to take over from him one day...” Potter trailed off a smile and a soft expression as he spoke about someone he loved.
“They did give me the job, of course they did, like you said who better than the guy who saved everyone right?! Except there are so many things wrong with that I can’t even tell you! It was the final straw!”
So I've not had the best week and I really loved being able to escape to the Caribbean with Harry and Draco on this little adventure, I hope you do too!
“OK.” Draco said, he’d get the full story in the morning but for now it was late and it seemed like everything was fine. “I’m going to get your sprays OK and then you can sleep here tonight. Let’s get you under the covers.”
“It’s Blaise.” Said the voice.
“I’m not some fanboy who just wants to kiss Harry Potter so he can sell the story to the Prophet, you know that. If anything, your fame puts me off!” Draco continued half joking.
“Very well.” She said simply.
He huffed and shook his head in disbelief, he hadn’t really analysed his relationship with Fred for ages and saying it out loud he was aware of how stupid it all sounded. How did he get here?! “I know if I really loved someone I could never share them… and I want love, I guess...” He said quietly nervously twirling the stemmed glass in his hand again.
“Under normal circumstances?” Harry asked with a raised eyebrow.
He squirmed slightly avoiding Draco’s eye. “The thing is that George kind of overheard and then joined in the conversation and erm, well, he’ll know I was talking about you, so then he told Fred and he might tell Daphne…”
Suddenly Harry looked back around at the seemingly empty space near where they had come in with a concerned look on his face as if realising someone was missing.
He hadn’t been feeling cheerful all morning but suddenly seeing Harry, especially in this state automatically made him feel happier and forget his worries temporarily.
Harry buried his head in his hands. He knew they were right but it was painful to hear, Hermione had said stuff like this over the years but he’d never heard it from the twins and the fact that they obviously thought so too made it all too real for him. Everyone around him seemed to be ok, they all moved on, all dealt with the past. Was he the only one still struggling with it?
Potter broke out in a cheeky grin that Draco couldn’t help but smile at. He could get used to seeing Potter’s face like that, he thought to himself.
“Ah well, one day maybe! And hey, it could be worse mate. Being cooped up in a palace like this aint all bad! Better than old ‘Azkey’ right?” Leo said, giving him a playful tap on the shoulder and clearly trying to make him feel better. It didn’t really work though. It was obvious he didn’t understand how much of a prison this really was and there was no point trying to explain it.
Leo had brought them here about an hour ago after the trial. Turned out he was the auror assigned to Malfoy Manor for the near future. Draco found himself pleased at that turn of events, he actually liked Leo and it would be nice to have a friendly face around. Upon arrival Draco had immediately started questioning his mother about the missing details from the trials he needed to know but she had firmly said that she had to “get her affairs in order” first and that they would “converse later over tea”.
Kreacher led them into the dining room and Draco was stunned by how beautiful it was like he had been when he'd seen his bedroom. The two rooms were quite similar in the way, they both seemed to be the lightest rooms he’d seen in the house. This room had a beautiful white wooden floor with a large grey and black brocade rug in the centre of it. The walls were also panelled with white wood one third of the way up and the rest were painted smooth in a crisp white too. It was a lot of white but it made the room shine and it had grey and black in to break it up.
It does take a while to get going as I just really wanted to let the readers inside Draco's head and detail his summer before we get to Hogwarts. Be patient with me please, I promise it's worth it! Or I hope so anyway!!
“I completely get that and it’s probably healthy to be together all the time for everything. I know how important your business and your friends are to you and I never want to take those away from you.” Harry answered sincerely.
Harry laughed. “Sorry, I didn’t realise you didn’t know. I assumed she told you which is why you told me that you were… but you could have just asked.”
“-I don’t know why and I’m not asking, it’s none of my business-”
“Like what you see Potter?” He teased.
“I’m grateful Blaise, I am, it’s a good idea and it is a possibility for a long-term plan if we can’t deal with Lucius but that would take weeks if not months. You know how long it took us to sort out the Diagon Alley building.” Draco said sensibly.
“Is she free? She’s wearing aprons.”
Draco smiled. “Yes please dinner would be good. I hope you don’t mind me being dressed down for dinner but I thought I could get away with it seeing as you wore your pyjamas at breakfast.”
A week had passed and although Draco still had his down moments, overall life had been slightly more enjoyable since that evening they had sat in the sun and enjoyed their Italian supper. Him and his mother had got through a bottle and a half of wine that evening and Draco, having never seen his mother enjoy more than a polite toast of champagne before was surprised at how relaxed and funny she had become. She had even started telling him some stories of when he was a baby that he’d never heard before. Something seemed to have changed in his Mother and even though she was still somewhat formal and quiet she was definitely warmer and less distant now. She smiled much more freely these days and didn’t retire to her bedroom after dinner anymore.
There was a bit of an awkward pause before Potter laughed nervously.
Harry and Draco had a bit of a serious chat over breakfast where they talk about Harry's issues for once.
Someone asked for Draco to get jealous of Harry as some point and I love that idea! I did put him getting jealous of Biscuit into this chapter (hehe!) but I will definitely include this request into the next chapter as they will be going out then and it fits in better. (mild spoiler alert!)
“Father wasn’t thrilled about it when we got the chance for a proper chat but he accepted it. My parents were pretty good actually during the time we had in France together. My relationship with both of them will always be a bit strained, particularly with my father. We’ve never been a family that’s been open and honest about our feelings but I know that they love me in their own way. I think they feel guilty about a lot of things and if I’m honest I’m still a bit resentful toward them for those same things I guess so it’s always going to get between us. However, they told me after the war that I could have any life I wanted to have and that they would always support me and my choices which they have kept to.”
Draco impresses me every day though.” He said in a playful tone but looked at Draco in a way that would convery he was serious.
“So you could have refused, he would have killed her we both know he would have done and then he’d have kept you alive to live with the guilt and the grief. Snape would have still killed Dumbledore anyway, or Dumbledore would have died from his cursed hand and Voldemort would have still placed Snape as headmaster and found his way into Hogwarts. You can’t beat yourself up for any of that. None of it was your fault. I probably would have done the same in your situation to be honest-”
“I’m sorry I didn’t mean…” He started awkwardly but didn’t seem to understand what was going on or what to say.
It was about ten o’clock when Draco started stretching and yawning. Although there was something about it that didn’t seem quite genuine to Harry.
Daphne spoke again considering her words carefully. “He told me to give his best wishes to my fiancé, clearly you’re not the only one that never reads the news! I told him you were my ex-fiancé but that we were still friends so I would pass them on regardless. He also said that school rivalries were a long time ago and he hoped you were well.”
“-ever survived the killing curse, yeah I know!” Harry said, rolling his eyes and sighing. “I guess I can understand why I was the object of fascination but nobody sees it from my point of view.”
He would consider himself lucky to have one child and wouldn’t really mind if it was a boy or a girl. Secretly though, he knew he wanted at least two and really hoped that one of them would be a girl. He could imagine Draco cuddling a little girl too, hopefully she would have blonde hair just like him. Would Draco ever want that? He thought so, he thought they wanted similar things in life but sometimes he was worried that he was wrong.
Then Draco finally looked up into Harry’s eyes and he knew there and then that he’d made the right decision to give the chapters to Draco even if he still didn’t know why.
Harry was slightly taken aback and didn’t really know what to do with that information. “Oh.” He said with a blink and then recovered himself. “Of course. School rivalries were a long time ago, I hope he is well.”
He’d been half hard all day since to be honest. He kept picturing what it would have been like if he had felt Harry’s erection pressing into him from behind. What he would have given to reach behind him and grip it to see just how hard, how thick and how long it was.
Um, yes??
“And is that,” Pansy paused as though looking for the right way to word her thoughts, “guidance going to be, uh, hands on?” She was swirling her mimosa around the champagne glass now, frowning slightly at Draco.
Harry preened under Draco’s praise and released the bundle of clothing into the arms of a house elf that Draco had called. “May as well pop them in my room, Pippin,” he drawled. Had he been paying proper attention to his guest, he would have seen Harry’s breath catch and a small smile form on his lips.
Harry squeezed his hand tighter before letting go. “She was still your mother. You can love someone and not like their behaviour.” His lips quirked into a half smile. “Trust me, I’m somewhat of an expert.”
JadePresley, you are all shades of amazing. I wouldn't have gotten this chapter out (ever!) without you <3 Thank you for spending your spare time fixing my mistakes and telling me I'm not crap. You are so appreciated!
“Do I need any preparation?” Harry asked innocently, standing and brushing his hands over his backside.
It was with that promise in mind that Draco was searching the lower floor for Harry. Unable to locate the group on the dance floor, he checked the bathrooms and on a whim made his way to the smoking area on the roof. As he exited, pulling a cigarette out of seemingly nowhere, he caught sight of messy hair up ahead. He smirked and made his way to his friends, lighting up the cigarette as he went. Harry’s hands were waving as he intently spoke to his new friends, who were smiling at his drunken rambling. “-because he’s so pretty and he’s always been so pretty and snarky and I’ve always wanted him.”
He said “thanks, Pans,” loudly over the top of her continued ranting and ended the call. He handed it back to Troy and gave him a grateful clap on the shoulder before striding down the stairs before he could lose his nerve.
Ron flushed and averted his eyes. “They may have, but I possibly forgot.” He took a large bite of his croissant, finishing the majority of it in a swift move. He chewed and swallowed before getting to his point. “I’m here because Hermione sent me.”
He took another shot.
And have him Draco did - after the familiar whoosh of Apparation, Draco landed and found his arms wrapped tightly around Harry who was gripping the blonde's arms tightly, head burrowed in the narrow chest. Draco’s eyes were drawn to where Harry’s white teeth were biting his bottom lip enticingly. Harry’s head tilted up slightly further towards Draco’s and his eyes fluttered slightly.
Draco snorted. “So you brought what? All your favourites?”
Obviously.
Draco simply smiled and waved his hand at the bartender for another wine. “Would you like another drink, Potter?”
“You’ve never gone to so much effort for us to meet someone before.” Troy pointed a long finger in Draco’s face. “And you’ve not taken your eyes off him all night. And,” he said the next with the tone of someone pulling out a trump card, “you have allowed him to touch you in some manner since you arrived almost kissing!”
He led Harry through the Manor, up to the balcony outside his office on the second floor. “I take most of my meals here, Potter. I hope that meets with your approval.” He had a funny feeling in his stomach he hadn’t felt in years. Why on earth was he nervous? It was just Potter.
Troy rolled his eyes and pulled his mobile phone out of his back pocket. “Just wait a sec,” he ordered and turned away, muttering into the phone. He turned back around and handed the phone to Draco. “It’s for you,” he smirked.
“You’ve been sitting at the bar all night staring at me, Potter,” Malfoy drawled, smirking up at Harry who was frozen in place by his hooded grey eyes. “How about you sit down for a minute instead -” He pushed a chair towards Harry with his foot. “- And we can get to know each other better?”
I'm not just sitting and waiting for your texts, you prat, I'm on a stakeout and my phone is on silent.
“My whatever?” Draco raised an eyebrow.
Harry chuckled and shook his head. “Except for when you’re seen with me, of course.”
“The Draco Malfoy moral code?” Harry asked wryly, reaching up on his tiptoes to sink his teeth into Draco’s collarbone and licking the sting away.
The incessant texts?
Draco sniffed and said, “well, if no one is going to finish their sentences properly, I’m going to go home.” He stood tall and sketched a half hearted bow to Pansy. “Thank you for brunch, I’ll see you tomorrow. Keep an eye on the papers.”
“I helped him with his wardrobe as a public service, not for him!” Draco protested. “I-”
Tony nudged Draco’s shoulder.  “So, D, how long have you wanted Harry?”
Draco’s shoulders slumped.
Much better looking to start with.
Really? Because people who hate me don’t often agree to a date with me. You can’t get out of it. See you tomorrow.
Where are you Malfoy?
“Your last boyfriend wasn’t smart enough to pass the Granger test. Even Weasley thought he was dim and that says something. The one before that you didn’t even introduce to them which tells me everything I need to know.” Draco held up his hand to stop Harry before he could interrupt. “You would prefer someone to take control of social situations as you’re never sure quite what to say. You like to be the little spoon. You’re mainly attracted to men, but Hermione is a special case you’ve been sleeping with for years. Shall I go on, Potter?”
Daphne waved the wide white door open and the sitting room was revealed. It was a large square room with lots of light coming through the wide windows. The walls were covered in cream wooden panels and the floor was a dark brown wood. In the middle of the room was a large brown and green rug and on it was a little collection of formal green and brown sofas and armchairs. There were lots of indoor plants to add greenery to the room and ornate portraits and ornaments. It was the most beautiful room Harry had ever been in.
“In that case I’m going to invite him over to the estate Saturday night. You’re invited too of course, and Blaise I think. We’ll cancel Friday so you can have some time to yourself and do this dinner on Saturday instead with Harry. You’ll do better if you don’t have work to think about the next day.” Daphne was clearly formulating this plan on the spot out loud.
“Also he seems nice, I liked him. He has a good sense of humor, he kept pace with me and my little ways which is hard to do.” She said with that classic mischievous grin she was known for. “He seemed genuine. He was really polite to me even after he knew who I was. He wasn’t bothered about the Slytherin thing. I really do think he’s left all that petty stuff behind him. He even told me to pass his best wishes on to you.”
Monday and Tuesday were not good days for Harry; he’d always been useless at sitting around and waiting but he was trying to give Draco space. He had already pushed into his life too much too fast if he had any hope of getting Draco to trust and open up to him again he needed to show that he could respect his boundaries. That was easier said than done though when all Harry wanted to do was to go round there and speak to him.
“Morning darling.” She said as she always did, taking the diary. “Did you have a nice weekend?”
“Hey.” He called out and then motioned to the spare seat at the desk. “May I?”
“OK then.” Harry said, feeling happy. “Let me just get dressed and I’ll meet you in my study with the notes?”
“Like it’s that easy!” Draco scoffed. “Like I could just get Potter into bed! He must be straight!”
No nothing. Draco sighed. He levitated Harry in the air and carefully laid him on the massive plush bed in Draco’s room.
“Does that lead to the basement Kreacher?” Draco asked out loud before thinking the answer was pretty obvious really.
“Erm, thanks.” He said laughing. “You actually have no idea how much that means to me.”
After Hermione had gone to bed Ron convinced Harry to stay up and make their way through a bottle of firewhiskey. Ron was telling him all the stories from work and the office gossip. They hadn’t got drunk just the two of them in years and it was fun just to be Harry and Ron again. Harry found he actually enjoyed hearing all the Ministry shenanigans now that he wasn’t a part of it. He could laugh at it all now knowing it wouldn’t affect him so he didn’t have to worry about it. Ron was laughing too as he never really let things affect him. Harry was too drunk to floo home and ended up just crashing on the sofa.
Just over an hour later Harry was walking into the familiar kitchen of the Burrow. He had apparated and walked over the field as he sometimes did just to clear his head even though his run had definitely helped with that. He’d deliberately gotten there a bit earlier as he knew he owed Ron a bit of an explanation for walking out earlier.
Bex had started out as a waitress in the hotel and they had both met Mattie who worked as a bartender there. The three of them just became inseparable. That was over five years ago and they basically still were.
In a serious note it was always my intention to wrap up the 'Lucius' storyline after the sixth year stuff and have Draco and Harry in a good place before using the remaining chapters to focus on seventh year, telling people about their relationship and publishing the book so all that is coming up soon!
“Draco, wait!” He called out stronger than he felt. “You can come in… please.”
Then he heard a low moan escape Draco’s lips as he nestled his head into Harry’s toned stomach and slowly moved his hands upwards across Harry’s bare back pulling his top up slightly as he did so.
Draco spat out the last sentence then took a deep breath to calm himself down. He mustn't let Potter get to him. He looked down at the table not meeting the other man’s eye.
“Yes, we’ve been working with him quite a lot actually, he really is good at what he does. He’s helped us with our Comic Cordials too.” Fred said sitting up in bed now. “He mentioned that he’s been looking for a premise and we told him that the shop opposite had been empty for a while. So yeh…” He trailed off.
“Probably in exactly the same way.” Harry chuckled.
As always Harry smiled when Draco entered the room, also wearing his pyjamas. He raised his drink.
His mother had stepped up first conjuring an elegant floral wreath of rare dark roses symbolising thankfulness to the deceased without a word. Then she had turned back, placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder briefly and walked to where the aurors stood to wait for him. That left Draco alone near the grave for a few moments to say goodbye. It was strange. He didn’t really
“Saturday, dinner, 7pm my place.” She said decidedly. “I’ll send mum, dad and Astoria off out somewhere, maybe they can go have another dinner at the Macmillian’s, they’re due for another one.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry sighed. “You know I hate it when you guys do that, just say what you have to say.” He said impatiently.
“If you could spare some time away from your studies, I was wondering if I might have your assistance with the Manor?” She questioned him carefully.
Harry threw a cushion at George and slapped Fred on the shoulder.
“Anyway.” Harry said getting back on track. “I never wanted to feel vulnerable again and you wouldn’t believe how many times I dropped my wand during field training with the aurors, it was kind of embarrassing really. So I started thinking more about wandless magic again for the first time in ages. I knew I had the potential to do it because I’d kind of already done it but I wanted to do it deliberately. I started with the summoning spell, I thought if I could wandlessly summon my wand then I’d never worry about not having it. It was like practising for the first trial in fourth year again, I just tried over and over again but nothing happened. Every now and then it would move a bit towards me and one time it flew across the room but I couldn’t ever do it properly.”
The simple thoughts of talking with Harry and making him laugh. The thoughts of him and Harry on a real date holding hands across the table of a restaurant. The thoughts of curling up on the sofa with Harry after a long day. The thoughts of what came after the hot sex, them just cuddling naked on the bed, satisfied, happy. The thoughts that he wouldn’t have to leave after a casual fuck, the thought that he could stay and fall asleep beside Harry. That he could wake up next to him every single day and the most scary thought of all… the thought that he wanted all of this.
Hermione raised her eyebrows at that. “He studied muggle practices and science?”
Hey all :)
“Oh it’s not sudden.” Blaise said quickly. “I’ve always been interested, Harry, so many rumours in all the magazines over the years and now I have the opportunity to get to know the real you. I find myself curious which publication was the most accurate.”
He bought all his potions and product ingredients via owl from a wizarding company so maybe there was a food equivalent. Muggle shops were an option but he didn’t even know where they were or how to get to them and he didn’t even know how to use muggle money. He might have to start dressing as Pierre more and explore the wizarding shops, surely that would be safe.
“Firstly, you can stay with us if you need to.” He said simply giving himself a moment to prepare this next sentence. “Secondly you do have a family member who has wanted to reconnect with you for a long time.”
Draco turned to him and frowned. “Aren’t you in the Master suite?”
“All I care about is sleeping next to you every night, preferably naked.” Harry said kissing him. “I don’t care about anything else. I slept the best I have in years last night.”
As far as he was aware Lucius hadn’t had any dodgy dealings with anyone since the war. The ministry was still keeping an eye on him and mostly Lucius and Narcissa just kept to themselves. They hardly ever left the Manor anymore and they had more than enough money that Lucius never needed to work even after his business developments and investments had collapsed. He put the thoughts out of his mind determined to enjoy himself tonight. Lucius was not going to ruin everything for him.
“Erm no.” Harry said. “I, er, I’ve decided that I’m ready for a proper relationship. I- er, well I’d still like to get married and have a family one day like you guys, just cos I’m gay doesn’t mean I can’t have that, so, er I’ve decided I’d like to start dating properly.”
“Of course, but, erm-” Draco’s smile vanished as he recalled what had happened. “unfortunately, his allegiance switched to me when father got sent to Azkaban a couple of years ago but I had to, erm, tell him to obey the Dark Lord. It... it didn’t end well.” That was rather an understatement but Leo didn’t need to know the specifics and Draco wasn’t inclined to reveal them.
“Look, my childhood was really shit OK? I don’t want to sound like a dick but it’s just not really something I ever talk about so do you think we could erm, well…” He trailed off awkwardly and then stopped altogether when he felt Draco’s hand on his shoulder squeezing it slightly.
“Yes, that is good. Merlin knows why though when I don’t feel at home here! Sorry you have to have breakfast in my depressing flat.” Draco said with a hint of bitterness.
Draco laughed again, this time properly. He made flirtatious eyes with Harry over their breakfast trays. “I’m not sure it gets any better than that Harry, it was a damn good kiss.”
That left Harry wondering when it became acceptable for boyfriends to shower together, something that he’d never done with anyone else but there was something very tempting about following Draco into the shower. He reminded himself though what Draco had said about taking it slow. Was it normal to start a relationship with someone you hadn’t even seen topless? Harry had no idea. Mind you, George and Daphne had gone on enough dates now to call themselves an official couple but Harry was pretty sure they hadn’t slept together yet. What date did that normally happen?
Harry chuckled. “Fine, I’ll let you wear the trousers in this relationship if it will keep you happy.” Harry said, rolling his eyes.
“Thanks, you too.” Draco said, giving a warm smile and then disappearing under the cloak before he even opened the front door.
“OK.” He said, still not entirely convinced. “Is it just pre-wedding stress still at home?”
Daphne came into the kitchen escorted by the maître d’ looking very pretty indeed. Her long  glossy yellow-blonde hair which Harry had only seen up in an elegant bun in the shop, was now flowing freely in soft waves around her face and down her back. She was wearing a very autumnal looking burgundy fitted pencil dress that hugged her petite frame beautifully. It had long sleeves and came down to her mid thigh. Her look was classic and simple but no doubt elegant and it suited her. Harry got up to greet her, pressing his cheek to her in a formal kiss, he might not go out a lot but he still had manners. She turned her cheek to accept his greeting and placed a delicate hand on his arm showing off her beautifully manicured nails.
“You know there’s a reason why I changed my name Potter!” Draco carried on his little rant. “I don’t want to be a bloody Malfoy anymore. You think I’m proud of what my family did during the war… what I did?! You think I want to be associated with that name?! That name follows me around everywhere I go, it’s why I escaped to France where nobody cared. It’s why I never go out anymore in public as even the name change can’t help me there. I still look like a fucking Malfoy and I can’t escape that. My family name is dirt, the Malfoys will always be scum now.”
“Since that day your father has been getting steadily more… incensed and obsessive.” She clarified. “He was angry beyond belief, I don’t think he ever expected you to go to such lengths. He always thought you would obey him no matter what. It triggered an… unpleasant side of him. He was angry with me too of course, it is the only time I have ever raised my wand to him. I promised him that I would find you and bring you home to make amends and he said it was a task best suited to me, which he was right about of course. Your father has never been as clever as he thinks he is, but then I’m sure you already know that.”
“Erm, well that was the bit that I was worried about honestly.” Harry said carefully.
It was two days later when Leo handed him another letter, thinking it was from Blaise Draco smiled but he’d forgotten he was still waiting for another reply.
Harry thought it had been a perfectly reasonable question until Draco had just started laughing at him. He looked at him puzzled until Draco recovered from his laughter and explained himself.
That settled it, he decided, she was most definitely being difficult on purpose and it was probably a test somehow. Either a test for him or for Harry he wasn’t sure but this was typical of her, maybe she was testing their relationship. Interesting... Well he would show her just how good they were together and how well they could run this house.
“Yeah” Harry said with a bit of a grin. “I never told Ron that he’ll probably die of shock or heartbreak when he reads that bit.”
Potter smiled this time when he spoke. “No that’s great thanks, although I have to say I’m really impressed with how you can get me to speak about someone and then just know how to create a unique blend for them. I might just give you a list of everyone I know and their birthdays so you can handle all my gifts!”
It had been a difficult week for Harry and it was about to get a whole lot harder. He’d been avoiding Fred all week. He’d blame the book and said that he had lots more social appointments this week. He also insisted he needed time alone to plan and start writing it. The first excuse was kind of true but the second was mostly bullshit. In truth he was yet to write a single word despite receiving an official go ahead from Kingsley.
Harry liked cooking and mostly cooked at the weekend at Fred and George’s but he’d always been too lazy after work in the past and it always offended Kreacher when he cooked at home. He loved his evening with Teddy and promised it would indeed be a weekly thing from now on. His favourite thing was telling Teddy the story of the Marauders again as they cuddled up in bed. He stayed whilst Teddy slept until Dromeda came back as he had assured her that she deserved to go out and have a nice time.
“Most definitely.” Harry said chuckling.
Then he made eye contact with Draco and his face broke out into an unmistakably cheeky smirk. “You know there is someone you could marry and further the Black family line with that could give your children the Black inheritance.”
“Oooh. Well I love a challenge!” Daphne smirked. “Let’s see if I can remember it all…”
Harry casually seated himself next to Daphne and flashed a smile at Draco that reached into his twinkling green eyes. “Miss me?” He asked with a cheeky grin.
“Oh my sweet Harry, you’re so cute when you’re confused.” Draco’s words had gotten away with him a bit there but never mind, can’t be helped now and it was nice to call Harry his. “I talked about hot guys fighting dragons and mentioned a broomstick too, admittedly Cedric was hot too but you were the only one that flew during that task. I told you how much I noticed you in your dress robes at the Yule Ball, I said how I did anything possible just to get your attention in any way during fifth year… I thought you might have pieced it together.”
“Draco,” He mumbled against his mouth. “You’re wearing too many clothes.”
“Hey guys, sorry you only get one half of the duo today but don’t worry, it is the best half!” He joked. “The other one is probably seeing how many new contacts he can get for his little black book today!”
“What are you thinking about it?” Harry asked him eventually.
“He’s just gone to get us both some coffee sir, he should be back any minute.” Harry said.
Draco had never heard Harry say that before and he’d be lying if it didn’t pique his interest but he was a man of discipline and he really did need to work. “Well I’m busy so you’ll just have to wait until tonight.”
“Not an autobiography as such.” Harry continued. “There’s still a lot about my private life that I don’t want to include, but to finally tell the world the true story of who Tom Riddle was and how he was defeated, yes by me but also by so many others, even you guys!” He finished with a smile.
“Harry?” Came the quietest voice outside his door.
“Well, I was going to go into the Ministry today. Firstly to get all the information on your case first hand but also, I think I need to talk to Kingsley and Williamson about, well about the job.” Harry said flatly. He seemed tired this morning and not himself which worried Draco. “I mean, I don’t know the specifics and I should probably have an actual contract or something…” He trailed off.
“No.” Draco interrupted him and firmly pushed Harry onto his hand and then straddled him taking back control once more. “I’ve been thinking about this all damn day and I’m doing it.”
Draco let out a small low chuckle. “Myself.” He repeated quietly as if he didn’t really understand what the word meant.
Kreacher was nowhere to be seen which was probably a wise move. He had taken to looking after the owls a lot recently and was probably hiding up there talking to Gandalf just like Harry did sometimes when he was stressed.
Before he knew it Draco had spent so long cleaning, sorting and reminiscing about how he’d gotten to this point that it was lunchtime and the doorbell on the front of the currently closed shop downstairs rang. Draco lazily apparated downstairs to the front of the shop and unlocked the door with a flick of his wand so that Blaise could come in.
Then Draco stood up elegantly from the table. Everything he did was elegant, Harry thought to himself, just watching him do simple everyday things is beautiful. “I’m going to go have a shower and get dressed. I’ll meet you in your study?”
“I do care Draco...” Harry said calmly.
“Of course he is!” Said Fred summoning a brightly coloured box from George’s open bedroom door whilst he carried on talking. “When we played it was Ron in Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom with a Mandrake!”
“Have a good time with Blaise and don’t worry about Ron and Hermione. It will all be fine.” Harry said confidently to Draco, giving him another kiss. “I won’t be late home but obviously if you’re having a good time then stay out as long as you like.”
“Absolutely not.”
He finally had all the variety and the luxury back in his wardrobe and he felt properly himself now for perhaps the first time ever. He was safe, he was happy, he was cared for and he was successful. He had all the luxuries in his life he was accustomed to but on his own terms. Yes, the money hadn’t been earned but he did feel like it was part of his inheritance really as he couldn’t have the Malfoy one and it was something that Harry had chosen to share with him which made it special too.
Safe to say that it was indeed the best shower of Draco’s life and it put him in a very good mood to start the day. That and the bacon butty that Harry made him for breakfast.
“More than me you mean!” Draco said flatly and reached for the glass of red he hadn’t touched in a while and gulped half of it down in one go. He didn’t care that he was showing how flustered he was.
“Auror Potter is here for his 9 o’clock appointment Monsieur Defoi.” She said formally.
They walked around a little more and Harry was eyeing up a few things that might make good presents for people back at home but Draco assured him they could come back to the market next Thursday and he could shop for gifts then if he didn’t see anything else on his travels.
As soon as he had Harry came bursting into his room not even bothering to knock.
“Draco, I- I’m sorry...I-” Blaise stuttered very uncharacteristically.
Draco phrased it carefully not wanting to voice how horribly they had been treated during the war. The Dark Lord like to torture things when he was bored and kill other things when he was angry. That was probably where the peacocks had gone too.
Harry sighed loudly and walked over to him. Without saying anything he just buried his head in the taller red-heads chest. Fred immediately wrapped his arms around him and kissed the top of his head.
“Cheers.” Harry said and then he automatically moved to the door marked private which Draco had always assumed led to their flat.
“Look, Draco... when you’re at school houses matter I get that. Hell, I certainly didn’t have any Slytherin friends at Hogwarts and yeh... most of them I’ve worked with at the Ministry aren’t great... but I work with some Gryffindors that are right prats too!” He let out another little chuckle before his expression turned a bit more serious.
Draco half smiled at that but then raised his eyebrow slightly. “Who says I’m going to be waiting here for you. I’m going out too tonight remember?”
“Merlin, Draco I didn’t know it was that bad.” Blaise said, looking guilty.
Harry moved passed Fred and came to stand in front of Draco. He looked into his eyes and spoke only to him as if there was no one else there. “I’ll be fine I promise, I just will likely pass out that’s all. It takes a lot out of me, you remember, like that time at home? I won’t be much help after it today but you have people around you, you will be able to get inside and then you can act together.”
Harry had made up his mind to enjoy the rest of the week as much as he could. He hadn’t had a proper week off in ages. During his week of forced leave he’d been moody and embarrassed only seeing Fred and George, spending the rest of his time at Grimmauld drowning his sorrows. This week he was treating it like a proper holiday. He was determined to use the time to see his godchildren so he spent Tuesday morning with Rose at the Burrow giving Molly a bit of a break. He even picked Teddy up from school for the next three days which the seven year old was delighted about. Tuesday they went to the park for a bit and Wednesday Harry even helped Teddy with his homework before staying for dinner. Dromeda enjoyed Harry’s company too and it was a bit of a break for her. As much as she loved raising her grandson he was growing up to be a bit of a handful.
Blaise trailed off and got a thick dragonhide black belt with a silver buckle out of Draco’s drawer and put it on him despite Draco’s moans that he could put on his own damn belt. Then to make matters worse Blaise got very close up behind him and wrapped his arms around Draco to just ever so slightly tuck the front of the loose T-shirt into his jeans, his hand getting very close to something it shouldn’t.
He felt a little dizzy still as he stood up too quickly and reached out to brace himself against the wall.
“Oh, right… yeh.” Draco had completely forgotten it was his birthday, not that there would be any presents, he supposed. “Well, afternoon tea would be nice.” He said after some consideration. “Will you be joining us?”
They carried on drinking their drinks in silence until the mugs were empty. Finally Draco turned to Potter.
He had received a few other practical gifts from him and his mother for the upcoming school year which he had graciously accepted. True, they weren’t amazing gifts but they had hardly been able to go out shopping and they would undoubtedly be useful for N.E.T.W.S which he was determined to do well at. The best present had come after Leo had left them and he was currently staring at it against his pale skin with his mother’s words still going round in his head.
“As if I’d care!” She laughed. “But if you’d just bloody listen to me you’d know that you don’t have to rush-”
He reached over to put a tentative hand on Harry’s leg under the table. “Plus he was really freaked out when we guessed his real identity. He’s really private Harry and he made us promise not to tell anyone. I’ve never seen him so serious and so worried, I reckon there’s something going on there but it’s not our place to ask. He really cares about his business, it’s everything to him and we respect that so we kept our mouths shut.”
“I’m not sure… do I?” Harry asked with a nervous smile.
Draco simply smiled and did a tiny nod. He closed the gap between them and kissed Harry ever so lightly. Harry felt those soft lips he was starting to become familiar with press into his own for the briefest of moments before they were gone and the basket was pressed into his hand to take.
“The same back to you Harry.” She said kindly.
It is the LONGEST chapter by far and they're aren't really that many natural breaks so be prepared for that, also it is intense!! Hopefully not too intense, i did what I do best and broke it up a bit with some food!! :D
“Sure! That sounds great cheers! The players box will be crowded anyway. I'll get a better view in yours!” George said happily. “You really going to invite Draco though? You two like friends now or something? And by Blaise do you mean Zabini? You friends with him too now?!”
It always took Harry a while to walk through the Ministry, everyone wanted to stop and talk to him, so he was grateful for the cloak on his visit today. Fortunately there was no one around in the corridor outside the Head Auror’s office to hear his knock on the door. He always still knocked, it was only polite.
involve sex, Draco could definitely show him a good time then, but he was just worried he’d be taking advantage of him somehow.
“It’s just you Draco.” He said quietly. “You’re just so… perfect-”
Deep down he’d only ever wanted someone to take care of him yet somehow his first instinct was always to push away anyone who tried. Not Harry though, Draco thought he’d pushed away when he’d yelled at him but Blaise was right, Harry was stubborn and wouldn’t scare that easily. If he really thought about it it was scary how much he was starting to rely on Harry being there in such a short space of time. He could no longer imagine his life without the man which terrified him as he knew he didn’t want to be without him already and they hadn’t even begun anything resembling a relationship yet, but Draco was determined not to let his insecurities get in the way of what could end up being a very good thing.
Every second of every day, Malfoy. Your addiction to sugar quills is quite concerning. I’m considering recruiting your friends for an intervention.
The conversation lulled and the trio returned to their drinks and last remnants of food. Draco very nearly fell out of his chair at the sudden grumble of “there you are!” coming from behind him. The Zabini wards hadn’t chimed, so this person was keyed in to come and go as they wished, and, as far as Draco knew, only the three people partaking in today’s brunch were able to do so.
Harry looked down and grasped his hands together, halting their twisting, frantic movements.
He didn’t like the way they had returned to the serious tone. “So how about some eye liner, Potter?”
jadepresley you are still amazing. Thanks for making me sound like I know what I'm doing!
“So how did shopping with Potter go?” she asked casually.
Malfoy?
As Draco showed Harry around the manor, bypassing the dungeons and the room where Hermione was tortured, they continued to chat until Pippin popped into the indoor pool room, where they were currently debating the purpose of having a pool when you don’t like to swim, to announce that dinner was ready.
“You haven’t taken your eyes off him.” Mitch, who towered over Draco, tilted his head with a half-smile and knowing gaze. “Is there something we should know?”
Draco snorted inelegantly. “Are you fishing, Potter?”
Blaise smiled affectionately. “Weasley, you’re rambling again.”
The music was already loud and the rumble of the other patrons lent itself to the buzz of the bar. It wasn’t overly late - early enough to be able to walk around without having to push past people, but late enough that the atmosphere was electric.
“Definitely time to go,” he announced as he walked back into the room. “Let’s go.”
Harry cocked his head to the side with a questioning frown. “So I don’t embarrass you? Anything I should know about your friends? Rules about the place we’re going to?”
Shit, that's not what I meant, Malfoy.  I was more wondering if you'd like to come with me?
“Blaise! Now is not the time!” Pansy snapped. “I don’t think he-”
Another fancy meal Malfoy, very impressive.
Unfortunately for Draco, that didn’t help him at all. Harry’s eyes fluttered open, and the green now lined with black kohl was even more startling than usual. Draco, whose knee was still resting between Harry’s thighs, caught himself leaning his face towards Harry’s, eyes intent on his lips. He jolted back quickly. Not appropriate, Draco! he thought to himself.
Draco snorted, dropping his cigarette and grounding it out with his heel. “He deserves better.”
Shit. Let’s pretend that didn’t happen again. Thanks.
“Oh! Oh, no,” Draco shook his head and resumed his walk to the entrance hall. He held his arm out for Harry expectantly.
Draco couldn’t tell you exactly how they got Harry home - the walk passed in a flurry of gentle kisses and quiet laughter before they finally arrived at Harry’s apartment.
Ignore that Malfoy, someone stole my phone
The two relaxed in the wicker seats on the balcony for a good long while. Draco was surprised at the ease in which they spoke of both general matters and personal. As they sipped on tea brought to them by Pippin, Draco realised that he was very much enjoying spending time with Harry one on one. They had similar views on most things - but not enough that their conversation was boring. He also found that Harry was very funny. Unlike Draco’s dry sense of humour, Harry’s smile was infectious and he shared it often. He asked lots of questions about Draco and how he grew up, and it was while answering one of these questions that Draco had grabbed Harry and pulled him to his feet to give him a tour of the castle.
Harry raised an eyebrow in question. Draco offered his arm again. “I’ll be side-along Apparating you to the bar.”
Mitch smiled down at Harry. “At the places Draco finds, yep. Exclusivity lends itself to privacy-”
Ouch. I am devastated. Now if you don’t mind, I have work to do.
Hey, cheer me up. Send me another photo of your fancy lunch. You're out with Blaise again, right?
He’d always thought that Draco Malfoy was a good looking man with excellent fashion sense and just the right amount of sass to keep Harry on his toes, but this level of staring was surely bordering the line of stalkerish. More than usual, in any case.
“I think it is,” Harry mused aloud. “Your face hasn’t done that blank thing it usually does.” He wrinkled his nose at Draco to soften the potential insult. “I’m honoured, Draco, really. I want you to be comfortable around me,” he said gently.
“If it’s his business and not yours Pansy,” Draco drawled, “then I don’t need you to tell me.” He raised a sardonic eyebrow. “I daresay he’ll tell me tonight after a drink or two, if I need to know. Or, say, have my suspicions confirmed.”
Next time? I’d like that. Alright, I’ll surprise you then.
“Draco,” he breathed.
“Hmmm,” Blaise hummed thoughtfully. “Of course.” He helped himself to another croissant. “So did the two of you talk, or was it all fashion related?”
I’d say sorry about the hex but I wouldn’t mean it. Hope someone got a photo. Enjoy your lunch.
He caught pieces of her rant which was essentially telling him to ‘sack up’ and ‘are you a Malfoy or aren’t you?’ and ‘since when do you not take what you want?’
The group travelled down the road, still chatting and laughing. Draco, not sober but still less drunk than the others, walked a little behind them, admiring the way Harry fit in so well into his friendship group. He hadn’t shared this particular group of mates with anyone from Hogwarts, and while he had known that Harry would fit in well, it was another thing to actually see just how well he fit. It was always a source of jealousy for Draco that Harry was so easy going, in contrast to Draco’s more stiff and standoffish nature.
'...yeah...'
'I love you too.'
‘Do you remember the plan?’ I ask him and sip.
‘Because you’ve always been opportunistic. You lost and suddenly you just throw money on things just so people would forget. I’m not saying,’ I go on when I see he wants to cut in, ‘you are going around crucioing children, but I’m saying you changed because you had to not because you wanted to.’
When I step inside, Granger is in the sitting room with her children. ‘Who won?’ she looks at me.
'I think you will come back alone. He did chew your shoes this morning.'
'I'm tired. We're still on for tomorrow, yeah?'
'How are you?'
'You know he'll eat it and just jump back up into your lap, right?'
'Okay.'
He wishes Malfoy had not visited him at St. Mungo’s five months ago, because he’s now officially pining.
, and I kissed him, and he kissed me back for one beat of a heart and then pulled away and said
'We spoke to each other plenty.'
'I know what you're thinking. That I am still not completely over Ginny.'
Draco L. Malfoy
'Three weeks, at the most.'
Harry agrees. She looks way too nice.
Gradually, his smile stills. ‘I mean, you don’t have to. I just thought… I wanted… but it’s okay, we can do anything else. What do you want to do?’
So, he did complain about me, officially.
‘So you held his hand because he’s annoying?’ Ron asks, confused.
Potter just stares with one eyebrow raised, jaw working, mouth full. Merlin, I want to pummel his smug face in.
'Pfft.'
'There are no lingering feelings. Anymore. I'll go and I will be happy for her. For them.'
“God! You’re such a pain, Malfoy.” Harry growls as he rakes through the files on his desk Malfoy dumped there this morning without asking.
retort to leave with.
Malfoy shakes his head. His face is flushed pink and so close Harry can see few freckles on his cheeks. “Tell me how you like it. I want to make it good for you.”
'Wanna bet?'
'Why?' I ask dumbly, I don't think I understand. I see his jaw clench again.
Harry licks into his mouth. “Yeah?”
'No, not really. Thanks for the great company. See you.'
'I'm so sorry, Harry.'
‘I mean yeah, but it was harmless and it was just this once. I don’t take them at all, ever, but as I said I was pretty pissed already when he offered.’
'Mulled wine might do you good. There is a Christmas market nearby, I'm headed that way, so if you want to join.'
'But if you're serious, I guess... I can try. One last time.'
'Okay. Just asking.'
‘Well then, I believe a payment is due, if everyone is satisfied with the product?’ She takes her hand off the man’s lap, sliding it to his chest, pushing him slightly deeper into the cushions. ‘I do have some other things to attend to.’
I choke a little on the last word.
'You were selfish.' So blunt.
I regret all my decisions right now.
‘Very good,’ she smiles, ‘productive. How was yours?’
I managed to stay sober, only had one beer. But when I came back home and lied down, Malfoy’s face came uninvited to my brain, with
and for sure he was up to no good. And since when does he have a shop specializing in cursed objects – as he
Pathetic. At one point I really thought he would drag me with him. We would get back together and...
'God, you're an asshole.'
and that was it, because at that point my mouth was already on his.
'Did you tell them? Why you broke up with me five years ago?'
'I was drunk...'
‘I’m just asking. Hermione told me once I should be nicer to you, but I keep wondering why. Maybe I just need to get to know you.’ I put my elbows on the table and my head on top of my hands. ‘So, I’m trying here. Are you really this changed man everyone thinks you are?’
'Remember to take the tart.'
‘I’m good. Just work, you know. Always work.’
'I know, but still.'
‘Good morning.’ I stay standing in the door.
'I don't want to force you.'
'Will you be able to do both? What does the apprenticeship mean? Is it like some course?'
There’s silence, we sip our wine, the waiter clears our plates. Then she clears her throat. ‘Look, Malfoy. We will be working together very soon and I really don’t want it to be weird between us. So let’s bygones be bygones and enjoy what hopefully will be some magnificent discovering of new facts and knowledge.’
'Draco...'
'So? You know what happened last time. I complained, you were gone all the time, we argued and I cheated! I wanted it to be different this time.'
'But we can't. Obliviation would not solve anything.'
Draco L. Malfoy
I want to scream.
He shakes his head, closes his eyes briefly and brings his wand higher. ‘I won’t be asking again. Please. Hand it over, now.’
‘There’s no need Andy. I love this, don’t worry.’ She tsks and says
'Do you, really?'
Ministry of Magic
I must admit, I wanted to cuddle – because I just like it that way after sex, I don’t want to feel cold as soon as I come and I want a little affection, is that so horrible? Well, Malfoy certainly seemed to think so, because as soon as I wrapped my arms around him after, he stiffened and said
'This is yours?'
'Of course you did.'
'I guess we can cuddle for a bit then. Even though I loathe the word.'
'I only want for you to talk to me from time to time about what's bothering you.'
'Alright, then...'
'Are we going to clean up tomorrow? I am quite tired.'
‘Well,’ she starts, hesitant, ‘if you’re sure.’
Blaze Potions Ltd.
'Yeah. Why?'
‘Fuck,’ he moans.
“I do,” he yawns and snuggles closer. “You haven’t fucked the memories out of my head. You were good, but not that good.”
'How can it be when you're all over me almost every day?'
Harry also loves when Malfoy rants. He enjoyed it before because it meant Malfoy was angry and Harry liked when Malfoy got mad, especially when Harry was the reason. It was satisfying, riling him up. But now, with all this going on, he just loves what he looks like while ranting. The veins in his throat are visible, his jaw set and his eyes thunderous. His cheeks go pink, and his mouth is so enticing Harry has problems with staying still. He likes his voice, too. Still posh and haughty but it has a timber he’s not noticed before.
This night, Malfoy was writhing under him, all flushed skin and sweaty back, hot and tight. His bedroom smelled like him. Just as he was about to finish, he woke up and was disappointed he was all alone.
He bestows a small kiss on his chest and opens his eyes. “Is it morning already?”
His head snaps towards me and he closes his mouth with a scowl.
'... Okay, Malfoy, I've had enough of you.'
'She wouldn't dare saying anything against the great Harry Potter!'
'I'll miss you.'
'It's black.'
‘There would be an investigation if something were to go wrong, under Veritaserun. Guess you skipped that part, too?’
“Well, fuck.”
I want to take him home, get him naked and touch him everywhere.
Blaze Potions Ltd.
‘You’re an arsehole,’ I tell him and taste it. Well. It’s very good but I’m definitely not telling Potter that as I start moving again.
I go make myself a nice drink when there’s a chime again followed by familiar voice. ‘Hello? Draco, are you home?’
‘Actually,’ I say, and he stops, ‘can you tell me what happened? Before I was cursed?’
Department of Magical Law Enforcement
'Hello.'
'If you needed money you should've taken some from the office.'
'Me? You don't initiate it anymore and you go to bed early.'
I don’t say anything. I stand up from the couch, resigned, take a deep breath and yank the door open.
He stands up and puts money on the table. 'See you around.' He turns away.
'Sure.'
'Fine. But, Merlin, just try not to step on my feet, Potter.'
‘Excuse me,’ I murmur when I stand up. To my utter horror, Potter just smashes the last remnants of his pie into his mouth and follows me.
‘Alright, I take it back. You know I love your company. You are the best company there is.’ I smile and she resumes her stroking.
I want more.
‘So the celebration is next Saturday, just very intimate gathering of people,’ she keeps nodding her head for some reason.
'Well then, no time to waist. We're having sex for the rest of the night and then all day tomorrow I don't want to see you leaving the bed.'
'Whatever you want. You could even take some time to just think and relax, not work at all.'
Malfoy said when it was just me and him.
'You woke me up with your moving around the whole bed.'
‘Blaise, you are just so right tonight!’ Pansy coos and follows with: ‘Now let’s talk about my big relationship crisis and once we are done, we can move to Blaise’s... whatever.’
‘Thank you, I’ll think about it. So far I am satisfied with my muggle atrocities, as they say at home.’ She slowly picks up a biscuit from a plate and dunks it in her tea.
'I really want you in a hot water. Maybe with some bubbles.'
‘Mhm.’ And then it’s quiet and I’m finally falling asleep.
I stay put for a while, just watching him.
'If it's not strange for us, it shouldn't be strange for him.'
Draco L. Malfoy
'Can I come in?'
'What is it?'
‘That is no excuse, Pansy!’ Several sparks fly out of my wand.
'Don't let Hermione hear you calling her wedding a party, she would end you.'
‘Yeah, of course I am. You know what I meant,’ he waves his hand vaguely and continues his… work, I guess.
'Are you eavesdropping on me?'
Malfoy is standing in front of my bed, black robes on and some sort of a grimace on his face. ‘I am. What are you doing here?’
'Anyone, Malfoy. Litterally anyone. Hope to not seeing you around.'
'We would have to get rid of everything after, all two years worth of memories to completely forget.'
'Hm. So now I will help you clean up, then, after a job well done, I'll give you your present and then I will make love to you in our bed.'
'What's that supposed to mean?'
'Yes. Unless you don't want to. That's fine.'
and I wanted to punch him in the face. I was feeling so stupid and odd and cold.
'I don't think so. '
'What? Why?'
'Don't get offended, Merlin. Look around, people are basically fornicating on the dance floor.'
‘What are you doing here?’ I snap at him, opening the stack. It’s very detailed analysis of the poison on our latest case.
Well, Malfoy is behaving like a real prat again. I wen to his shop four times and to his house twice this past week, and every time he claimed he was busy. I mean, it’s fine if he is and it’s fine if he doesn’t want to see me anymore –
‘What? That was it?’ Blaise looks bemused, his eyes narrow. ‘So all that wailing…’
'She is. How was it, seeing her, happy with Blaise?'
‘Do you? Then why do I need to be present?’ His fist hits the desk and his mouth flattens in a thin line.
Draco L. Malfoy
'I really like the shampoo, but this, how did you even make it?'
‘Didn’t look like she wanted to murder you,’ he grins.
I look back at him. ‘After you send the potions, much better. Thanks.’
It’s been an exercise in suffering, for multiple reasons.
‘Yes,’ I sneer at his back, ‘your wish is my command.’
'Best friends?'
Auror Office
'Well, okay then. Get dressed. We will go for breakfast first, I need tea. Then some shopping...'
Pansy shrieks and nods vigorously. ‘You are absolutely right, Blaise!’
'What does it look like?'
That I apparently told him I adored him.
'You are such a... let me go if you're going to make fun.'
'It's realistic.'
'Stop.'
He hears Malfoy’s voice in his ear. “I like you too.”
if wanted to extend the same courtesy of not overstaying my welcome.’
'Sure. Here.'
'Yes.'
and said:
I look and yes I did, although I didn’t realise it at that time, lost in my head. ‘I told you, just being civil.’
'Just like you,' I say because I don't have anything better. I feel ashamed I came, I have no self-esteem and I am so annoyed with the whole day I couldn't think straight and that's why I'm here. Because he's always on my mind when I'm angry and nervous.
The pain at the beginning is almost too much. His insides burn with it, and he feels like he’s being split in half. But when Malfoy takes his cock in hand again, it becomes easier to move into it. He speeds up and pain slowly becomes pleasure.
Even as he keeps watching Potter in this moment, Draco suffers from no fantasy Potter might ever come to him again.
We had lunch. Then there was a dessert and tea and all that time, Malfoy was behaving like a complete tosser. He didn’t smirk once, no sneers, he was laughing and talking, playing with Teddy and even helped cleaning the dishes. Granted, he barely spoke to me, but other than that, he wasn’t obvious about it, because if I asked him something directly, he answered politely. It was some sort of alternate reality, that afternoon.
‘I can’t believe this is happening to me!’
‘Like hell I will.’ I stand up to face him and he closes the door.
'Draco! Stop. It's public indecency.'
‘You and me both, Malfoy.’
Kind regards,
Nothing left, just ashes.
'I think you don't know how to be alone. I think you might be lonely.'
It’s torture to keep seeing those green eyes above him, face flushed, gasping his name.
‘We did.’
Yeah, what’s that about?
'No, it isn't. It's not at all how I wanted to do this. I've been planning it since may, obsessing and looking for the best moment, but you're being a right prat so... I want to be with you, for as long as possible.'
'I don't know if it is.'
So, he let me in on Saturday and Sunday, too, let me walk the grounds while watching me from the windows. He did not let me in, though, when I asked to use the loo again, didn’t offer tea or anything. He came out once on Sunday. He just walked, back stiff, glaring on me from time to time. I kept watching him, too. I even walked with him. Besides few catty remarks about my hair, glasses, magical abilities, and just generally about me, there was no real conversation.
Just like us.
“Yes?” He gently swipes his fingers on Harry’s skin, making him shiver and sleepy.
I wish to forget. Him. Me. Everything.
I startle when the door to my office bang the wall behind, almost falling off its hinges.
'Okay then. I think I want it. I'll do it.'
'Malfoy. No, why would I?'
God, just adorable!!!
More skin.
'Yeah.'
He crumples the parchment and throws it in the bin.
Ministry of Magic
‘The wailing might have been an exaggeration,’ he admits, ‘and the breakup as well, to get you here.’ He smirks, sitting next to me, and I want to throw the whiskey right in his face.
'No. Not much to think about.'
‘Is there anything you want to tell me Blaise? If yes, speak, if not, let me work.’ I move to my desk and look at the list of orders.
I actually wasn't going to have them be officially together so soon but I just couldn't wait I want them to be together!
Nobody said anything after that slightly awkward moment as they just finished their breakfast in silence. Draco wiped his mouth with his napkin as he finished his last bite. It really had been very good, he had no idea that Harry even knew what eggs royale was let alone make it. Time to make one more playful gamble of his own before leaving Harry and his mother alone.
“Well now you have to us.” Hermione pointed out as Ron leaned forward eagerly and said “tell us what?”
“Well I think I’d be happier if neither of us ever wore trousers.” Draco said flirtatiously taking a step forward to Harry, his apparent annoyance vanished.
“Well you’re a Gryffindor and I’m a Slytherin. Typically, in my experience anyway, they don’t really get on.”
“You really never even looked in here?” Blaise asked sceptically as Kreacher started pouring the wine and then set out serving the starter.
“Well,” Draco started. “I am happy here… it has everything I need, especially as I can have you guys round now. I feel safe here and the environment relaxes me, and it’s not as if I feel entitled to a share of the Black inheritance but… I guess I feel less guilty taking the money than anyone else's and the house feels like it belongs in my family maybe… I know it’s still Harry’s but-”
“-and what you’re trying to forget.” George finished.
“I don’t remember granting you permission to call me by my first name and I’m not usually forgetful
The magazine had looked quite favourably on Harry’s friendship with his old Slytherin classmates. They painted him as a forgiving man who was just and fair to all and didn’t care about the old house and the possible associations of his new friends. It looked very good for his image and they didn’t say anything negative about Blaise or Daphne. It gave Draco a vague flicker of hope that if his friendship with Harry was ever made public then the press wouldn’t hate on him for it but he knew that there was a difference between being a Slytherin and being a Death Eater.
Maybe this was a stupid idea. Why on earth would he give them to Draco to read first? Yes they were sort of friends now but only just, this was really only their second meeting. What if everything in these pages brought it all back? Would all the hatred they felt towards each other all those years ago return? For some reason this new found friendship with Draco made him happy and he wanted to keep it. He felt this week like his life was finally going in a direction that he wanted. What if it all came crashing down?
“Poor woman!” Charlie said back laughing.
Draco chose to ignore it. They couldn’t know about his attraction to Harry. He’d never told anyone.
Then the laughter stopped suddenly and there was silence for a second.
“It’s just stuff Blaise, that’s all. It’s not important.” Draco continued trying to convince himself as well as Blaise. “I have basic furniture, it’s habitable and we can spruce up what’s already here. I have the books, the equipment and the ingredients I need for the business that’s the most important. I can remake my own products, I- I never fly anymore and the other books were just sentimental really… from school. I don’t need them. I have enough money set aside to furnish the shop, get the shelves, the counter, make it look good you know.”
He used to think the whole ‘pureblood’ thing was just all an excuse for posh evil wizards to act superior. Clearly a lot of the war had been based around ideas of pureblood supremacy and those notions still sickened him. In the years after though a lot of innocent pure-bloods had been victimised in the same way that muggle-borns had during the war and that wasn’t right either.
And will they EVER get this god damn book written?!
“The final?” Harry asked pointlessly. “Yeah sure, guess so! It’s on Sunday right?”
With that statement Draco just walked off to his bedroom and slammed the door shut leaving Harry just standing there.
“Merlin.” Draco swore under his breath. “But Dumbledore destroyed the ring right? What happened to the stone?”
“So what do we do then?” Harry said, still clearly a little frustrated. “We just wait? I can get Ron here with a team, we can still try and get in.”
“Yes, I couldn’t agree more.” Draco said, still sounding tired but now he actually
Draco gave Harry a last long look then nodded sharply once. His whole body language tensed again but he still didn’t pull his hand away from Harry’s. Then he took a deep breath and focused on the wall behind Harry as he launched into what sounded like a rehearsed speech.
If his mother was surprised by this she didn’t show it, she just took a small sip of her water. “Well it is an education to see you in your… perfectly ordinary life.” She said looking around as if she was unimpressed. “I suppose it is rather... charming in a way. ”
He was floating in the air. It felt nice, it felt liberating. His limbs were aching, his knees felt funny and his something didn’t feel right with his wand hand either. The whole of his left side was really sore.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Morning Darling.” Came her usual greeting.
“It was hardly swearing I didn’t say fuck did I?” He argued back but then went a bit red in the face. “Ah fuck, well now I have.”
He sighed inwardly. He wasn’t stupid, he saw the difference there. Not, sorry I offended you but sorry if you took offence, like if he was offended by it then it was his fault not hers. Draco was right, this is where he got his brains from. Sparring with Draco thought was fun, he was witty and Harry appreciated that. They’d always had fun making jabs at each other but keeping up with Narcissa in conversation would be a different matter.
“Hi.” Draco said simply.
However, all of Harry's grief that he's been repressing comes to the surface just at the wrong time and he doesn't deal with it particularly well.
“Blaise!” Draco said warningly as he pushed his friend back to an appropriate distance.
“Despite not being that well informed, Professor, I will admit to being intrigued. I still do not see what assistance you would need from me but I will endeavour to be useful if the need arises.”
Draco leaned into Harry’s neck and started giving him little kisses again whilst still moving on top of him. Then he started scooting down Harry’s body nudging his legs apart and settling himself in between them as he trailed kisses down Harry’s chest again. He got lower and lower with his mouth until he was dangerously close to his prize. Harry felt Draco pause and saw him look up at him once more just needing that eye contact. Harry bit his lower lip at the sight of Draco and wiggled his hips enticingly at Draco smiling at him. Draco chuckled and happily dove straight in without an ounce of hesitation now.
“Well it seems Mr. Potter was right to involve the aurors, it really does make everything more straightforward.” She said plainly. “My divorce case would have been more complicated with a private referral to St. Mungos but due to the nature of Lucius’s crimes he has forfeited all legal rights. Mr. Flint is confident that he can grant me all of Lucius’s assets in the divorce, I will get the properties, the vaults, everything.”
He nodded shly. “Yes actually, still are my favourite. The bakery in Diagon Alley has some particularly nice ones.”
When Monday morning came Harry found himself waking early as he always did. He’d stayed over at Fred’s and found himself sitting on the edge of the bed looking out of the bedroom window once again at the shop opposite. For ages it had just been a dark shabby empty building but for the past week it had been encased in a white plastic canvas with a sign saying ‘Opening Monday 12th September’ which was today. Harry wondered what sort of shop it would be, not that he would be likely to go inside. He did all of his shopping either in the muggle world or via owl order as he was always done. He felt some movement behind him and then there was a hand snaking around his waist.
“Yes, I felt better after.” Draco agreed slowly and cautiously.
Blaise paused for dramatic effect and Draco let his words sink in for a moment before he continued. “It looks to me like he’s doing everything he can already to convince you to stay.”
This was just fucking perfect! The best way to end this miserable day would be to find out that his best friend and employee was dating the one person he both hated and fancied more than anyone else. Daphne was quite a catch, of course Potter would like her and she would just love to be with the perfect war hero. They would probably get married and have perfect bloody babies and, oh Merlin, he was never going to escape Harry sodding Potter.
Draco had just listened the entire time unlike Hermione who interrupted him all the time or Ron who listened but made it very clear with his face and body language what he was thinking the whole time. Harry couldn’t tell what Draco was thinking. His attitude of patience and acceptance reminded him of the times he’s opened up to Fred and George except George always made him feel better with humour and Fred would use physical touch to comfort Harry.
“Well I’ve always hated hangover potions.” Molly said hovering above her seat and starting to serve the Sunday roast. “If you’re silly enough to get drunk you should at least have to suffer through the consequences of your actions. Honestly what is he like?! You shouldn’t still be going out to those clubs George at your age! Honestly! When are you both going to settle down like your brothers?!”
“Yeh, she mentioned Malfoy actually, confirmed the split but said they were still friends or something, it was a bit odd actually but…” Harry trailed off and noticed that the twins were avoiding his eye. He once again felt like he was missing something.
him…? Was it even possible for anyone to really love him…? Cared about seemed more accurate. He was grateful for that, it meant everything to him and he could cope with that even if it’s all it ever was. Harry obviously didn’t seem sure either as he was still looking slightly nervous.
“And I’m proud of you too. “ Harry replied back with just as much sincerity and looking deeply back into Draco’s eyes.
Draco found his mother's blue eyes turning soft as she gazed upon him with… admiration. “You broke the cycle.” She said simply. “I saw it the day you moved out. You stood up to your father, to the system, you had a glimpse of what your life would be like and decided it wouldn’t make you happy so you left to make your own life and I… I admire you greatly for that and that’s why I helped you that day.”
“Merlin, Draco, do you have any idea what you do to me?” Harry croaked, his voice dry and husky.
The green light continued to flash in the office every five minutes without fail, which was the only thing that stopped any of them from losing their minds with worry. It was half an hour, two cups of soothing chamomile tea and three visits from Blaise later that they heard any sign of movement.
“Good.” Potter said smiling. “I don’t want any special treatment. I just don’t want my order list to end up in the Prophet... and I asked you to call me Harry.” Potter said.
“I’m in here Leo” he said as he opened the door.
Harry smiled slightly at the look that Draco was giving him. He couldn’t deny that everytime Draco looked at him like that it made him feel pretty good. He’d always been mildly uncomfortable when other people looked at him like that before.
He thought he’d got better at that having to do so many speeches at charity events and press interviews but there was just something about Malfoy and this unfamiliar situation that was making him nervous.
There was the humour he liked so much from Draco, he always seemed to know what to say and how to make Harry feel better. It was probably why he could open up to him in the same way he had with the twins. Except he was telling Draco more than he’d ever told them. Draco had seen more than them at school, they hadn’t always been there. In a way Draco had always been at the centre of it all. He seemed to almost prefer Draco’s sense of humour now too. It was a witty, dry, clever sense of humour but it seemed to suit the conversations they had more than Fred and George’s fun distracting kind.
“So I was thinking maybe you would feel better about the book if you wrote it with me, that way you can have more of a say, you won’t be worrying about what it says and maybe it will help you too.”
“Impressive.” Potter said, seemingly sincere and putting down his wine glass which was already empty. “So you came back to the UK and started a mail order business first and now have the shop. It really is something to build all that stock up from scratch. I’m always in awe of Fred and George when I get to witness the process of having an initial product idea and then watching it go all the way through the development process. I could never be that creative!” He said happily, keeping the conversation light and nodding at Blaise who topped up his wine.
“Any beer is fine.” Blaise replied moving over to stand next to Harry at the bar.
Draco came round the table to Harry and bent down to kiss him on the lips lightly before taking his seat between him and Teddy.
“Draco…” Harry started to say something but he wasn’t sure what and he started trying to get Draco’s loose shirt off him too but Draco batted his hands away.
“Funny old thing isn’t he?” Blaise said.
Harry kissed the top of Fred’s head as he carried on.
Potter shrugged. “Not much.”
“Ron do you think maybe we could erm, get going?” Harry suggested cautiously.
“Yes you’re a real domestic God Harry, you're fit, you're rich, you can cook, you have a nice house, a house elf, no need for a job...” Blaise was ticking them off on his fingers as he said them. “Draco you should marry this one before I do.”
“So you did piece it all together then.” Harry said slightly amused. “I should have known you would.”
Waking up on Tuesday morning felt entirely different for Draco. He thought he’d been content before, he’d been sleeping well, eating well, enjoying life, but he hadn’t realised how much he’d been carrying it around still. Carrying around that anxiety every day that maybe today might be the day that Lucius catches up to him. Maybe today the Imperius curse would stick and he’d be under his control once more.
“There was definitely a woody smell that reminded me of broomsticks, it's kind of similar to what you put in my aftershave actually.” Harry carried on and noticed Draco raising his eyes to him as if interested by that and happy with it. Harry took a bit of a deep breath before admitting the most incriminating of the three smells. “There was also a, erm, well a kind of flowery smell which I, er, I didn’t recognise at the time but now I think it, erm, well… I think it could be chamomile. It, er, sort of reminds me of you I guess.” He said slightly flushed and looked away from Draco.
“What is it? What’s happened?” He said quickly, willing himself to stay calm.
Louis already seemed like a very chilled out baby and certainly didn’t seem to mind the hustle and bustle of the Burrow. It was probably a good thing that he’d been born into the chaos of a family gathering as he seemed to be used to it already! Victoire had been quite a difficult and clingy baby but then she had been born during a very different time where people were still stressed and grieving after the war. Teddy had been even worse than her but then his first year had been very challenging for everyone. Thankfully he had grown into a calm and accepting child.
Harry had thought at first that maybe they could make a real relationship work but Fred had to have a serious chat with him. Fred said that he did love Harry in a way but that they couldn’t give each other everything they wanted. He found Harry very attractive and would happily provide any comfort he needed in any form, he would always be there for him but Fred was pretty adventurous in the bedroom and Harry had had enough experimenting to realise that he wasn’t really. Harry felt a bit useless at not being able to provide for all of Fred’s needs but when Fred suggested a sort of open relationship where he could sleep with others who could fulfil some of his fantasies Harry found he wouldn’t mind that at all. He couldn’t help but think if he was really in love with Fred he would be jealous but the fact that he wasn’t told him something. The other issue was that Fred knew he never wanted marriage or children, he told Harry that he wouldn’t change his mind about that, it just wasn’t for him and Harry knew deep down that he couldn’t give up the idea of being a dad for anyone. All he really wanted was a husband who could love him and their children, a proper family.
“So what’s the plan?”
There was something stewing in the back of his mind during this discussion and one look at Draco told him that he was thinking the same thing. It was strange how in sync they were. He put the thought aside for now though, one thing at a time.
Harry ignored Fred and carried on the conversation. “I’ll need to nick some bands from the Ministry though but it will be easy, I can duplicate them so no one notices they’re missing. I’ll think of an excuse to drop by and see Ron at lunch and slip them into my pocket then. I was going to get seven, one for each of us plus Daphne, Blaise and Graham.”
“Yeah I was thinking tonight would be a good time. I always go to Ron and Hermione’s for dinner on Fridays, erm, if that’s OK with you that is?” Harry asked as he started looking in the cupboards thinking what to have for dinner. He’d told Kreacher he’d handle it seeing as the elf had helped him so much in the attic.
“Hmm” Harry said out loud in encouragement.
Narcissa was sipping on one sofa sitting close to Draco but not touching him and finishing a cup of chamomile tea, probably not her first. Draco had an empty cup in front of him on the coffee table and there were also a few other empty cups and glasses alongside a mostly empty plate of cookies. George had his arm around Daphne on the other sofa whilst Fred and Blaise each occupied an armchair by the fireplace. It seemed quiet in the room but not uncomfortably so.
Draco leaned in and whispered seductively into Harry’s ear. “Every time I make you come.”
It was only then that he noticed the benches around the circular room weren’t entirely empty as Draco thought there might be. Most of them were but he could see a small group of people sitting together out of the corner of his right eye. He also had a sense there was someone behind him but he didn’t dare look round. No doubt they were here to testify about all the horrible things Draco had said and done and he knew he wouldn’t be able to look then in the eye. So instead he just looked straight ahead and focused on the man who would be leading this trial.
“Wow, I had no idea.” Draco said, sounding impressed.
Harry didn’t take much notice and just spoke casually as he finished setting the table. “We like to be comfy don’t we babe?” He said with a cheeky look at Draco.
“Move.” Draco said threateningly.
He forced his mind back to the appointment in hand.
“I just like watching you.” Harry said fondly. “You’re really beautiful you know.” He said as he reached over to trace a line down the side of Draco’s face. His skin was smooth but his jaw was sharp, it was a delicious contrast.
Harry laughed. “It was a very good plan. I liked it a lot.”
He wanted it to be true so badly but he wasn’t ready for it yet. He still had things that he needed to talk to Harry about, important things and he wanted them to connect physically first, properly, in every way. He wanted it so badly that he didn’t even know how to do it because it scared him.
Daphne saw and sighed. “Come on Draco, don’t start! I told you I was bringing breakfast and before you say anything, no I didn’t spend any money on you. The house elves at home made them up so it doesn’t count.”
“Anyway, I spent most of seventh year just trying to stay hidden from anyone and everything and in my solitude I was reexamining everything I ever knew about myself. So yeah, the answer to your question is I finally admitted it to myself that year but even then I was too scared to actually do anything about it or tell anyone, not with Death Eaters in the castle.”
Suddenly he had to look away from those eyes and he felt all hot under the collar. Merlin, what was happening. Was Draco... flirting with him? Surely not. He didn’t even know the man’s orientation, they’d only just decided to be friends ever hating each other it was just ridiculous to even think about. Harry had been staring pretty obviously earlier, maybe Draco picked up on it and was just teasing him about it. He was probably just trying to torture him it didn’t mean that he found Harry attractive back.
Secretly though the look in Blaise’s eye convinced him that he did actually look pretty good in this outfit. He thought about Blaise’s words and he turned to look in the mirror again to see what Blaise meant about drawing the eye to his chest. Hmm, he could be on to something but weren’t his friends thinking a bit too much about his outfit for a simple Quidditch match.
About six months into his all American backpacking experience he’d met a fellow travelling Brit called Rebecca (known as Bex) at a youth hostel. The two of them just clicked and started exploring everywhere together. Then she said she was planning on making her way down through Florida and then out to the Caribbean and Draco threw caution to the wind and went with her. They stopped off at a few different places and picked up little local jobs here and there as Bex needed the money. Draco didn’t really as he’d learnt to be much more frugal with Bex than he’d originally planned to be but he just did what she did.
“You feel better now you’ve got that off your chest?” Leo had said after, his smile growing into a ridiculous grin. Draco had opened his mouth to reply, then closed it again as he didn’t really know what he would say. He was angry and confused all at once. Leo had then sat forward to look at him a bit more seriously.
There was another low quiet laugh from Draco but then he turned slightly more serious as he reached over to gently hold Harry’s hand as they’d done quite a few times now.
“Me neither.” Draco said, holding Harry’s waist as Harry slipped his arms up over Draco’s shoulder and round the back of his neck. “I can’t wait to go to bed with you tonight Harry.” Draco said seductively.
“Will you be OK?” She asked with half a smile.
“Thanks, I think he could too.” Draco said quietly. “And I think I could make him happy.”
“Mr Malfoy” Kingsley returned before hestitaing slightly as if unsure what to say next. He took a short pause before continuing. “None of us are quite sure how to proceed from here. To be honest, I’m not quite sure if I should be thanking your family here or arresting you all.”
“You were going to ask me something else before.” Draco reminded Harry.
“I remember vividly.” Harry said, his cock twitching slightly at the memory. “I thought you said you wanted to take it slow?” He asked Draco seriously.
Draco watched his father hold his arm out for his mother to hold. Then the pair of them followed the Auror out holding their heads high and keeping their expression ever neutral. Draco hesitated before following suit, his eyes glued to the ground as he ignored the glances that were now coming their way. The second Auror, Proudfoot, followed in step behind Draco.
“Yeah, I did take it pretty hard… it still hurts if I’m honest.” Potter was hanging his head down staring at his own lap.
Ron swore quietly and picked up his drink again gulping down half the pint in one go. When he was finished he slowly wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and turned to face Harry.
Draco looked happy too but slightly sheepish as he admitted “Kreacher cooked most of it… but I asked him to make it and then watched what he was doing. He even let me help a bit so I could learn… and I squeezed the oranges myself, by hand!”
Draco comes to Harry to apologise and ask for his help.
Draco cut him off coldly. “Don’t Harry. I know what you’re going to say and I don’t want to hear it. There is no excuse for this, I asked for your help yes but I thought we were working together. I did NOT give you permission to just make decisions like that for me. You know what you did tonight? You took away my control Harry, my independence, my freedom to act. After everything I’ve shared with you surely you must realise how important those are to me.”
She sighed and waved her hand dismissively. “Yes, I’m fine I’m sorry. Just being overly dramatic. Everything is peachy.”
“So where are they all now?” Ron asked.
“No.” Draco said simply as he snuggled into Harry and wrapped his arms around his hips leading his hands to rest on the waistband of Harry’s jeans, his fingers trailing down dangerously close to Harry’s arse.
“Quite alright by me if you were Mr. Malfoy.” The older auror was a bit more formal than Proudfoot and he didn’t spend as much time around the family due to the fact he mostly took the night guard duty. “Feel free to explore all the garden has to offer as long as you can still be seen from the house.”
“Your turn to make it today.” He said cheerfully as he strolled right past Draco and went to sit at the kitchen table expectantly.
“I want you to go put on that white sleeveless top you were wearing when you came back from your run that time and your black shorts.” Draco said, biting his lip slightly. “Do you remember, when I came out of the bathroom and saw you standing here?”
Pushing the thoughts firmly out of his mind for now he straightened up and looked calmly at the group.
“I mean, it’s so fast.” Harry mumbled into his coffee.
The tears wouldn’t be sad tears, they would be happy tears, it was just all a bit overwhelming right now.
Once Daphne had left Draco warded the back door too and checked all his security measures. He looked over the diary again and made himself a to-do list on his desk. He frowned a little when he realised that Potter’s notes were definitely lacking. All he knew was that he wanted a bespoke gift basket for a friend but he guessed he’d just have to find out the details from him in the morning. There was a note to say that he would most likely be arriving just before the shop opened to avoid the public and would prefer to leave through the back of the shop afterwards.
This week she took the opportunity to have a rare night out with Molly as they were both free of grandchildren. Harry took Teddy to the park again but fortunately there was no paparazzi this time round. Then they went back to Dromeda’s where Harry tried very hard to help Teddy with his homework and then he made him dinner. It wasn’t really cooking, he just reheated what Dromeda had made the night before but he was thinking he should probably cook next time.
Draco had somehow ended up sitting on Harry’s lap who was now occupying his desk chair but both of them stiffened up and turned towards the source of the noise. He was sure he’d heard the shop door open and close again.
He read them once, then read them again and again. Then he sat for hours and just thought. He had an instinct about what he wanted to do and he usually trusted his instincts but it was a really stupid idea. He tried to talk himself out of it listing all the reasons why it was a terrible plan but the logic wasn’t enough to shake the feeling in his gut. He knew what the right things to do was.
“Fuck Draco.” He mumbled.
Draco turned back to Harry and gazed lovingly at him in a way that made Harry’s heart ache in the best possible way. “Thanks to you.”
“Good.” Harry said smugly. “That means you’ll have to stick around in my life.”
Draco was keen to move the conversation on so he addressed Daphne as they ate.
“Of course you don’t.” She retorted quickly with a bit of a twinkle in her eye clearly enjoying the interaction as much as he was.
Draco felt really happy that he’d done something to help Harry and proud that it had been something he’s thought of and adapted especially. This is what he was good at, this is why he liked his work, seeing the smile on Harry’s face had definitely been worth the effort and the man deserved to sleep at night after everything he’d been through.
Harry cut her off quickly. “I know it doesn’t and he knows that too. He’s not using it as an excuse but- well maybe his words will be better than mine. Here.” Harry said, taking the letters out of his back pocket and giving Hermione the one addressed to her.
Damn it, why had he pushed him, why couldn’t they have just had a normal conversation like normal people? Because he royally fucked up and pissed you off that’s why, Draco thought to himself. Still though, he should have known it was too much for Harry today. He hadn’t been himself for a couple of days and had been dealing with all the grief he’d repressed for years. The feelings of Cedric, Sirius, Lupin and all the others dying and Harry feeling partly responsible, which is still ridiculous, had all come to the surface after years of burying them and then Harry had been threatened by danger tonight of all nights. It was too much.
The three men nodded politely and raised their glasses. “New beginnings.” They chimed and all took a sip.
The twins were great at lying when it came to pranking people but not when it came to the real stuff.
In this moment he just felt so good and so at peace. His hand wandered to the middle of that chest and he pressed down lightly bringing that upper body completely flush against his own. He could feel that strong back against his chest and when he opened his eyes the first thing he saw was the thin delicate black lines on that lightly golden skin that he just wanted to trace with his tongue. He wanted to lean forward more and kiss all over those little stars.
“Erm, well…” Harry started awkwardly. “It was on Sunday after… well you know, I er, well it was glass… from a- er, from a bottle but I didn’t actually drink any I swear! I was going to though I suppose... but it smashed and I didn’t. I haven’t touch a drop since-”
“Although from now on it would probably be better if you didn’t talk.” Harry pointed out smiling. “And erm, Daphne, maybe don’t say his name?!”
“He was actually pretty good about it, I think he might have even expected it.” Harry replied. “Robards didn’t get it all and was trying everything to get me to stay but Kingsley knew I’d made up my mind even though he said I’d be missed. I told them it should be Ron though and I meant it. I know you guys tease him but he’s actually really good. He’s always been in my shadow, always been my partner and second best. Everyone gives me the credit for our efforts as a partnership, yes our stats are the best of the department but no one seems to understand that I couldn’t have done most of it without him. He’s solved most of our cases and he jumps into the field with the most appropriate spell. His instincts are good and his confidence has grown a lot, he’d be a good leader and he deserves it more than I do. So I convinced them to give it to him and let me leave. Ron won’t need a partner as Head Auror anyway and it will soften the blow of me leaving for him, he’s the main reason I haven’t left before to be honest. Once they got their disappointment out the way they didn’t need much convincing. They both respect Ron a lot and his record speaks for itself, he has a lot of love in the department, he’ll be fine.”
Daphne thought for a moment again.
This isn't a great chapter for Harry :( sorry!
I love putting these little fluffy moments in here and there and for me good food with loved ones is just one of the best things to this scene at the end for Draco is like my happy place! <3
“Other bits?” Draco  asked.
“Sorry, I would change back but I have another appointment straight after lunch and I was particularly pleased with my hair today.” Draco stated mildly arrogantly
“We’ll get you together with your Slytherin Prince if it’s the last thing we do!” They said together.
Potter was simply staring at him holding the laptop bag as if he found the whole idea of Draco even owning such a thing preposterous. Draco ignored him and started to make his way out of the main hotel doors thinking he’d leave Potter to it now. Potter though pushed himself off the desk and made to step forward too but then wobbled a bit and clutched his head.
“Oh that’s great! That means you can come on Sunday now!” Ron said enthusiastically.
We learn more about Graham's story and situation as he comes to Grimmauld Place.
Therefore, from now on this fic will only get updated once a week. I will aim to post a new chapter every Sunday evening (UK time) but I can't make any promises!
Harry looked down at Draco’s box of things. Was this really all the man had? Maybe he’d just brought one box as he wasn’t sure of Harry’s answer and he’d go back and get the rest later. Yes that was probably it.
“Do I want to know what you were stealing before and when?” Draco asked with a raised eyebrow.
George shrugged. “I got a bit of a vibe from both of you at Quidditch the other day. I asked Daphne about it too and she didn’t give too much away but she smiled and said she thought you guys would probably get together eventually…. I- er, I warned Fred about it. I always tell him everything and I just wanted to give him the heads up in case, well I suppose in case something like this happened!”
Draco stepped back and frowned remembering what was going on. “Why are you here anyway?”
Draco smiled at him ever so slightly. “And here I was thinking I was the centre of your universe. I’m almost offended!”
“Erm, well yes, I know… but it’s just not like that. I er- I think I just reacted like that cos the idea of me and him is just absurd really. It’s honestly just a business arrangement and I’ve never met him without George being there too.” Fred explained calming down.
“Yeah, Blaise Zabini. He was at Daphne’s the other night too. The three of them are close so it just kinda feels rude not to invite him. He seems alright but we hardly spoke to be honest. Draco and I aren’t exactly friends yet but I’d like it if we could be.” Harry said casually.
Upon opening the sitting room door he couldn’t help but smile at the sight of his best friend holding his baby daughter up in the air and making her fly around the room. She was squealing and giggling and he just looked so carefree and happy. He saw Harry come into the room and smiled at him holding Rose out for him to take. Harry happily held his arms out to accept her.
“Oh?” Hermione said trying to be casual but failing. “Like a date?”
His mother had returned by lunchtime as she had promised but Draco couldn’t face anyone and was shutting himself away in his bedroom. When Pinky came to tell him that lunch had been served in the newly restored family sitting room, he asked her to make his excuses to his mother saying he didn’t feel well. Draco half expected his mother to come up and check he was OK but she didn’t. He wasn’t sure if he was pleased about this or not, he didn’t want to talk to her particularly but it would be nice to know someone cared.
“Of course, I’ll be out in the sitting room in just a moment.” He replied.
He didn’t though. It took every ounce of effort he had to walk away quietly. After all, he did have to calm down himself now and get rid of his own erection. He looped around the trees out the back of his house a couple of times thinking of Blast-ended-Screwts, just as Harry had done the other day, and then walked back stepping loudly over the decking.
Teddy went to a small wizarding primary school in the middle of nowhere in the lake district. It was beautiful there and they did lots of learning and playing in outdoor classrooms which Teddy loved. Wizarding primary schools are becoming more and more popular now since more women were opting to return to work after having children and less young witches and wizards were being homeschooled like the Weasleys were before Hogwarts.

“Right, erm, Boot and Rogers can you take Mr Zabini and Miss Greengrass to…” Ron looked at Harry.
Daphne had been incredibly unhelpful and had done nothing to lift his mood. Even the brief comfort of the hug had gone now and he felt empty once again. Still, the first week of trading had gone better than he could have hoped and he tried to lift his spirits with that. Life really wasn’t so bad. He’d been able to pay Daphne a wage and put a small amount in his vault at Gringotts to start building it back up again. He’d even had another trip to the bakery on Saturday to stock up the cupboards a bit with fresh bread, cakes and pastries. Not the healthiest but he had a really sweet tooth so he loved it.
The first thing he became aware of was how dizzy he was when he opened his eyes. He closed them, counted to ten and opened them again much slower. That was better.
Harry blinked in mild surprise. Did Fred think he was going to duel him or something?! “Yeah it’s fine… It’s just Malfoy I don’t like the guy but I don’t hate him either plus he does seem to be really good at what he does, I’ve been drinking the blokes potions for two years and now he knows it’s me so he could poison me if he really wanted to!”
That made Draco feel really rather foolish, Potter was obviously implying that Weasley did more than he’d done for the war effort which of course was fucking true. Dammit he hated himself sometimes.
Fifteen minutes later and Harry was staring out of the kitchen window hoping to catch a glimpse of Draco coming home which he knew was ridiculous because he would apparate under the invisibility cloak straight onto the doorstep but he couldn’t bring himself to sit down and relax. Finally he heard signs of movement outside the front door but it wasn’t what he expected. He walked over and hovered nervously in the open kitchen doorway.
“Yes it is just me Draco, may I come in?” the voice called back.
“I think I can break through the wards and apparate in.” He said quietly and seriously.
“I… I…” he stuttered, not knowing how to get the words outs. He knew he didn’t actually kill the Headmaster in the end but he might as well have. He should have done it but he had failed, yet that didn’t dissolve the guilt he felt surrounding it.
Before he could even think about what he was doing his feet led him into the kitchen area and his hands were opening cupboards. There was nothing here. The cupboards were basically empty. What did Draco eat? He saw the coffee bits on the side and at least they looked like they’d been used but Draco couldn’t survive just on coffee. There were some pastries from the bakery and a bit of bread but seemingly nothing to go with it. This wasn’t right, Harry needed to do something. Should he confront Draco about it? Should he do out and buy him stuff? Should he pretend he hadn’t seen it?
“Apparently.” Harry said, shrugging again. “He has a very sensitive nose.”
That was actually news to Draco, he’s told his mother he wasn’t interested in the plans and hadn’t realised they had progressed that far. He didn’t let it rattle him though.
“George! There you are!” Harry said eagerly, seemingly forgetting all about Draco once more.
“Ouch! You bastard! That’s cheating!” He sulked rubbing his thigh where the hex had landed.
“We had dinner together Saturday night.” She said casually as if it wasn’t a big deal.
Harry sat and ate quietly. He knew George was right, it wasn’t his fault but he couldn’t help but feel maybe Fred was more upset about Harry ending things than he made out he was.
“With me.” Harry said simply and then avoided Fred’s eye.
“Relax, last time I stole something from the Ministry it was fifty times more dangerous.” Harry laughed. “At least I can show my face in there now.”
“-beautiful.” Harry whispered. He didn’t know if it was twisted of him to say that, given the nature of how they got there but it was true somehow.
Monday morning for Draco was also pretty eventful. Today, after almost a year of planning and building up to it, he was finally moving out of the Manor and starting his own life away from his controlling parents. He was standing in his new flat looking around, sure living here would take some getting used to as it was pretty small and basic compared to his usual living standards but it was the first thing in his life that was completely his. He owned this building and his father couldn’t do anything to take it away from him.
“No one else can know what they would have done in another person’s situation.” Harry said gently. “I mean, yeah maybe if I was in your position and if it was just me that would have paid the price then yeah I probably would have done but what good would that have done in the long run? If you’d have stood up to Riddle and he killed you then you’d be dead and he’d find someone else to do what he wanted. But it wouldn’t have been you who paid the price anyway I’m guessing. You did it for your mother right? He was threatening her life if you didn’t do what he said?”
“Morning Potter, how are you today?” Gawain Robards called out as he stood in front of Harry’s desk.
“He died.” Potter said quietly. “He died saving us.”
Things will really start to get fun now! :D
The only thing that stopped him from burning the entire building to the ground was thinking of the beautiful shop downstairs. That space was still his and something he could be proud of, it was only that thought that kept him going that night. Suddenly he’d felt like all the effort he’d gone into over the last month trying to convince himself and others he was OK had just been exhausting and he was too tired to put up with it anymore. He was not OK, not by any stretch of the imagination and he was too tired to pretend otherwise now. He needed help.
“Oh?” Harry questioned looking slightly suspicious.
Harry opened his mouth to say something and then frowned again, closing it.
As always, let me know what you think please! :D
“Oh.” Draco said quietly.
“Well isn’t that lovely!” Harry said, sulking.
Looking at the watch the Weasleys had given him when he came of age that he still wore on his left wrist, he realised he’d spent too much time daydreaming and he was almost in danger of being late. He didn’t even bother looking at his hair, he just applied some aftershave, smiled to himself as he remembered who had made it, and then apparated on the spot thinking about the address Daphne had given him.
He secretly loved weddings but he wasn’t going to admit that to anyone. Before the war the Malfoys always had at least three weddings to go to every summer and he loved seeing all the outfits and the decorations, eating all the luxurious food and dancing elegantly with all the pretty witches even if he had to pretend to flirt back.  He’d never actually been to a wedding as an adult though.
“So you know then?” He turned to Draco after a few minutes. “About the Elder Wand… what I was trying to tell you.
Harry paused for a sip of his water as the others just ate and listened. “I intend to tell him tomorrow about the fact that he does have some family still living in you and Draco. Draco expressed an interest last night in meeting Teddy too so that will be nice. He also said he wanted to meet his Aunt so I have invited Dromeda over for dinner tomorrow alongside Teddy.”
“Yes.” Harry repeated with a grin.
“You have?” Harry frowned.
Thank for you for the tips I genuinely appreciate them and I want to improve as a writer so if anyone has anymore of them then please let me know!
The events of that first day back at the Manor quickly became routine. Draco and Narcissa would take breakfast together in Draco’s sitting room while Leo ate in his, then after breakfast mother and son would choose an area of the house or the grounds that needed work and would set about transforming the space. A light picnic lunch would often be taken in one of the newly restored gardens to make the most of the summer weather. Draco would then have the afternoon to himself to study before the three of them took dinner together in the conservatory.
Malfoy laid a steadying hand on Harry’s arm. “We didn’t. Now we do.”
Also, you are clearly Malfoy.
“There’s a gay underground?” Blaise leant forward in interest. “Could you--”
Draco surveyed the room, pointing out the reserved area to his mates (the yellow sparks were outshining everything in the room) and made a beeline towards the bar.
“-right, Draco?” Draco turned his head back to the speaker - Tony was grinning madly at him.
Good night Malfoy.
Wait. So is that a yes? You actually haven’t said yes, so…
Harry pouted adorably and tilted his mouth higher so he could plant another kiss on Draco’s lips.
How Harry Potter could be so unsure of his worth was ridiculous.
Fuck off Parkinson.
You could at least respond to knock me back, prat
Draco looked up with a slight frown. “What? Oh, no. Not Quidditch.” He flicked the paper straight and said, “just they’ve got Potter in here again. ‘Ladies Man Potter Playing the Field?’” He huffed a laugh, indicating the picture. “It’s a photograph of him catching a witch who tripped into him and smiling at her friend. Ladies man!” he snorted again.
Oh Malfoy, you are nothing like anyone I’ve ever dated before.
He strolled out of the room, turning back to ask a question, before spinning on his heel and making fast tracks out of there. He would never get the image of Ron leaning over Pansy while snogging the life out of Blaise out of his head. If being keyed into the wards wasn’t clue enough that things had progressed in the trio’s relationship, this was loud and clear. Draco shuddered. Yuck.
Pansy and Blaise swapped a look.
Draco just raised his eyebrows and waited until Harry calmed. “I’ll leave the floo open, so just swing in whenever you like.” He waited until Harry nodded and was about to end the call. “Oh, and Potter, you’ll only need Muggle attire tonight- no robes.” The last thing he saw was Harry’s surprised face as he shut down the call.
Harry leant back on the closed door, head tilted up enticingly to Draco’s. “You sure I can’t tempt you in?”
The door bang opened behind him, jolting him out of his thoughts. “Draco!” Mitch yelled with glee. “We want to dance!”
Harry had been standing at the bar, staring, for ages. He took another shot of tequila; the lager he’d bought earlier in the evening almost untouched next to him.
“Well you shouldn’t-”
“Sorry.” Ron flushed and smiled back. Almost shyly, Draco thought. “Malfoy, Hermione suggested you go and comfort Harry because he’s freaking out about your whatever tonight.”
Nothing.
Harry just giggled and allowed himself to be dragged off by Tony.
“Oh, Harry was just telling us about the bloke he has a crush on,” Mitch shrugged and smiled. “He’s quite enamoured.”
Draco’s mouth dropped open. “P-preparation?”
“Good thinking, Potter. I suppose you’re not a total lost cause.”
You’ve hit me in the face. You’re as fancy as it comes.
“Why would anything be wrong Malfoy?” Harry asked, eyes sliding to the side.
“Not fishing, I see.” He sighed. “Harry, it was very alright.” He rocked his hips against Harry’s, whose mouth dropped open at the feel of Draco’s hardness rocking up against his. “But we can’t finish this here. Or tonight, in fact.”
Blaise is full of shite Malfoy. Ron stole it. He always steals stuff. Phones, sugar quills, food. He's a thief. Ask anyone.
She stood and stretched before dropping delicately onto Blaise’s lap. She toed off her shoes and propped her feet on Ron’s lap, wriggling her toes and raising an eyebrow. Ron sighed and began to massage her feet.
They returned to the booth to collect their friends and jackets. “Draco!” Harry jumped up and threw his arms around the taller man. “You were gone forever!” he said dramatically.
Harry nearly tripped over his own feet. “What?” he choked out. “I thought we didn’t know each other?”
He looked down at Harry’s shy face and his still trembling hands.
Draco snorted. “Yes that was rather distracting.”
Blaise leaned forward in his chair and looked at Draco. “Draco, it’s Harry Potter.” He paused for effect and then carried on. “Tell me, what did he do at school every single time anyone told him he couldn’t do something?”
“Piss off.” He said back. “I’m definitely
“Y-you and h-him… you’re not joking? You really… he is really… it-it’s… w-what?” Ron stammered out in the most inarticulate way that would rival Harry’s usual awkward stuttering.
“Yeah, I know. Sorry. It won’t last I promise.” Blaise said, smiling slightly.
Then he playfully pushed Harry away. “Now leave us alone and if I don’t have a drink in my hands in ten minutes I’m coming to find you.”
Blaise raised an eyebrow at Draco and smiled at him. Harry thought it must be some kind of private joke but he ignored it.
Daphne worked in silence casting ‘Episkey’ on his broken bones and dabbing his bloody knuckles with essence of dittany before soaking bandages in murtlap essence and wrapping them around his hold hand.
Not wanting to be caught prying into Draco’s things again he stepped out of the room back into the hall. He popped his head into the bathroom just to double check everything in here but it was spotless as always, Kreacher really did do a good job. Harry would have to thank him again later. He waited nervously on the top landing for Draco to come up. He wondered what it would be like to live with him, even if it was only for a month.
Draco was on the second floor when he heard that voice echo all around the school.
Daphne looked at him for a moment before laughing which made Draco frown at her even more.
Draco had written a little section about this that he wanted to include in this part of the book in which he formally apologised to Hagrid and explained the cause of his actions and how he regretted them. Draco had never known what happened to Buckbeak and was happy when Harry had told him the full story. They laughed when they realised how furious Lucius would be about the whole thing. As Draco was still insisting on being named throughout, Harry was of course happy to include his section.
Draco shook his head in amusement as he took off his grey silk dressing gown and threw it over Harry’s head. Harry laughed and dragged it off him. He sent it wandlessly over to the hook on the back of the door where it hung itself elegantly. Draco’s eyes were settled on his wand holster on the bedside table where it had been since Harry put it there the night before. Harry picked it up and held it out to him to take figuring that’s what he wanted.
“OK.” He agreed cautiously. “I have to admit that makes sense.”
Ron looked confused. “But he’s definitely checking you out in the picture and it makes sense with the way you’ve been recently…”
George flushed slightly but nodded at no one in particular then he looked at Draco. “Is- er, is Daphne OK? We’ve been writing, I know her Grandmother died but I haven’t seen her since last Thursday and erm, well I want to give her space but I want her to know I’m here, if she needs...”
Harry laughed but then untangled himself from Blaise. “Blaise, please don’t piss off my jealous boyfriend, it won’t bode well for me.”
They quickly learnt, however, that between the numerous ministry raids and the destruction of the Death Eaters, they were left with few possessions. Many of the rooms were barren and impersonal now, just dark empty spaces that seemed haunted. Furniture that was broken could be easily mended but many of the trinkets and ornaments that had once given the spaces character were gone. Leo had been out a couple of times with shopping lists from Narcissa to replace some of the items. He always seemed happy to help but he could tell that his Mother wasn’t completely happy with everything he brought back and was feeling frustrated that she couldn’t go out herself..
