“Bloody wimp. Come here,” Harry tilts his head down, needing to stand up on tip toes to press a gentle kiss on the spot. “Better?”
The first piece of his mother’s advice: Always have a papertrail of legal documents. It’s a good thing he had the foresight to do that before he left France. Only a truly daft person would take a child out of the country without notifying the government.
“Ah, and speaking of my cock,” Malfoy starts, laying back into the bed with a serene expression on his face. “It truly was a sight to behold. The perfect specimen: well-groomed, long, and thick. Made for the perfect fu—”
A small, squeaky witch is in the middle of presenting her brilliant research to the board about solar debris interacting with Jupiter’s orbit. She’s just getting to a good segment about how Jupiter’s moons are affected as well when a loud ringing sound emits from the pocket of his cloak.
He really needs to take his head out of the Floo, because after seeing Pansy be so good to his son, he realizes that it wasn’t nausea he was feeling.
The cart they’re in feels to be growing smaller by the second as Potter tilts his head forward. The pad of his finger brushes against the smooth curve of his thumbnail.
“They’re better than average I’d say,” Draco admits with a shrug, his eyes drawn to the girl with the juice drawing on the alphabet carpet in the center of the room. He can see why Potter likes this so much, though Draco would eat cement before being a school teacher. Children were fine, but only in small doses. Small, microscopic doses. “What’s her name?” He points to the little girl.
He’s drunk enough to get an overweight hippogriff sloshed, yet Draco doesn’t feel any better than he did when he popped the top off of the first bottle. So he tried the next bottle. And the one after that. And the one after that. Yet nothing has ceased the perpetual hopelessness swimming around in his fuzzy brain.
Harry’s gaze never leaves Draco, his eyes fixed on the sight of him walking around with his hair loose and without a single strand tied back. Draco can hardly focus on his tea with Harry’s fingers playing with the tips of his hair underneath the table in between cooking the food.
He jumps a little when Draco shoves his head into the opening and reaches an arm down, smiling like a mad scientist finally showing an outsider his creation. “Climb up and take my hand.”
Fury creeps up from the base of his spine. How bloody dare he. Draco knew who he was, even if Potter didn’t.
He keeps waiting for Harry to bring up their last conversation, the one that led to him storming out of Harry’s house and pissed enough to go back to the bottom of his desk drawer again. Yet, the only thing he'd given him when he arrived back from France was comfort and kisses. Along with the narcissus flowers Harry gifts him, he receives a massage and a song at Draco’s request. Harry doesn’t believe him when he says that he genuinely likes hearing him sing. No matter how horrible it is, he can’t convince him not like it.
“It’s not the worst thing you’ve done,” he murmurs into his knees. There’s a sharp intake of breath beside him, and he knows he’s thinking about his scarred chest, though Draco wasn’t alluding to that. Harry will have to learn that those scars are nothing more than that. Scars. He’d argue that leaving him helpless and alone without a wand in the middle of a war was worse.
Green eyes cut over to the pile of sleeping children pointedly. “Watch it,” Potter hisses, “Don’t wake the kids over a simple question.”
Wide-eyed from the events that just unfolded and chewing nervously on one of the pointed ends of his fork, Albus whispers loudly to Molly, “Are we still gonna have that fruit cake?”
“Alright,” Ginny wipes her mouth with her napkin and throws it on her half-eaten plate, “Let’s take this upstairs you two.”
He turns, slamming the door behind him with a swish of his robes. Several children and parents watch him leave with raised eyebrows and hidden giggles. His attire looked ominous, foreboding, and completely ridiculous around Muggles.
He doesn’t go into the painstaking details about how difficult it was to get the supplies to London instead of Paris, or how long it took to brew, or how this previous week he was staying up late at night to make theirs at the last minute. He doesn’t, because he’s not a narcissist or a fucking Hufflepuff.
Bewilderment is shining in Harry’s eyes the next morning when Draco sits down for breakfast with unbraided hair. Scorpius, Albus, Lily, and Ginny sit with them more perplexed by Harry’s expression than by Draco’s hair.
Draco stops laughing, straightening up instantaneously. “What?” He hisses. “What exactly does this Mr. Burns bloke look like?”
Albus shrugs his bookbag onto his shoulders, “I dunno. I’ll probably find something that morning to bring. It doesn’t matter because it’ll wow the pants off of everyone anyway.”
Draco tries to sidestep Jaspers, only to be blocked by him with each movement. The astrologist’s broader body was not helping in his escape. Pinching the bridge of his nose, he tries to reason with him, “Jaspers—”
“James and I do not—” Harry begins, literally choking on his words, unable to finish the lie he was about to say. George raises his hands as he proves his point. “This isn’t the appropriate time to do this.”
The rooftop itself is hardly anything spectacular. It’s plain; a few vined plants with protection charms casted on them so that they don’t get ruined by the weather. A solid, white flooring. A large telescope next to the steaming chimney. It’s nothing special, nothing particularly comforting or warm, but that’s okay, because the point wasn’t to look at the décor of the rooftop, it was to look
“Oh, and Harry’s quite fit isn’t he?” Her eyes twinkle like a little girl dreaming of her prince. “Don’t you two agree?”
“No. I never sang around her,” Draco admits. “It was always something just for Scorpius and I.” He feels heated spots rise on his cheeks. “And now you and Albus, I suppose.”
Draco wrinkles his nose at the gaggle of people watching and listening to Potter’s babbling with avid interest, politely nodding in agreement every so often. It was disgusting, truly. How little did these people know that they were only contributing to Potter’s already inflated ego; he can’t be worshiped in the Wizarding world and the Muggle one. He just can’t.
and thus too heavy to be picked up in front of all his new friends, regardless of how empty the hallway was at the moment. Draco just rolls his eyes and plants a soft kiss on his head, wordlessly and wandlessly casting a Lightening Charm on his book bag to ease the weight in his arms because he genuinely was too heavy to pick up.
“PTA. It stands for Parent Teacher Association. It’s a great way to stay involved in Scorpius’ education,” Ana says, pointing a red nailed finger on the paper. “We always try to encourage parents to get involved but it’s difficult recruiting a good group of dedicated parents.” Draco huffs. Well, he was definitely a dedicated parent. “Why don’t you look over it tonight and whenever you’re ready, you can let me know what you think.”
He pulls the lollipop out of his mouth, the red candy glistening with saliva. “Well, where do I start?” He taps his chin in thought. “I guess I’ll say that the tits are fine, for the most part. Bras are uncomfortable little fuckers, but worth it since they make my tits look so bloody good.”
This wasn’t weird, they were friends. I mean yeah they didn’t talk about this but this was out of necessity. Harry’s hands were trembling and a few tears fell from his eyes but that wasn't important.
He can’t help it, even though he’s so close to the Snitch that he’s nearly touching it, he brandishes his wand and casts a spell right when his fingers close around the winged ball.
For it to be the first week of December, it was an unusually warm one. Everyone was out soaking up the warmth, causing Hermione to hiss and mutter under her breath that no one seemed to be taking their studies seriously. It was only until Ron pointedly asked her for a book recommendation on the sexual repression of women did she perk up considerably under the rays. Harry was grateful too. Since that day in the Great Hall, Hermione only ever spoke to him when she gifted him with a new required text for the week. So far, Harry had obediently read through the pages of
“The stupid one,” Harry assures him. “If you don’t want to have sex tonight then we won’t have sex. If you don’t want to have sex ever then we won’t ever have sex.”
His teacher is at a loss for words, still boggled by why Scorpius would think that Albus falling is his fault.
The next meeting is, in Draco's humble opinion, completely unnecessary. Potter’s grand idea to ‘better improve student-parent relations’ is to engage in a reading session every afternoon for those in something called ‘afterschool’. Draco watched with disbelieving eyes from his seat in the back of the room as Potter explained that they’ll be with five year olds. Five year olds!
He ties it back again later Saturday night when Harry’s showing Scorpius and Draco what something called a ‘Transformer’ was. They do this sometimes, whenever Albus or Scorpius wants to have a sleepover, nobody questions when Draco or Harry tags along for the night. It’s just commonplace, for Draco be curled up with Harry on the couch or for Harry to already have dinner prepared for the five of them.
“Take… that… Skeeter,” Draco mumbles incoherently. Dark spots color his peripheral vision, his world drifting away as he sways against Potter’s strong back.
“I’m so sorry Al. I’m really sorry Mr. Potter,” Draco smoothed his hair down when his cries intensified, this time for real. “I’m just really, really sorry.”
He sighs. Spaghetti had been awful for months as it was, but Draco's negligence while cooking it tonight hadn’t helped improve their aversion to the dish in the slightest. It won’t help sitting here even longer, staring at their plates and letting the food grow cold.
“Well,” Potter stretches, the sleeves of his thin shirt hugging the mouthwatering muscles on his arms. Draco looks away. “Since you’re good over here, Al and I will be on our way. See you at the next PTA meeting Malfoy,” he nods politely Draco’s way then gives Scorpius a far more enthused wave. “Bye Scorp!”
So now, instead of reading his daily horoscope, Draco spends his mornings gazing over the papers and hurriedly signing them while trying not to spill his Earl Grey on the white pile.
Draco rolls his eyes but smiles to himself, secretly pleased by Harry’s ramblings. He attempts to push Harry’s body off his chest. Merlin, he was like dead weight against him. “Come on you. Clearly you’re too old to stay awake after one orgasm.”
People were at every corner. Hermione sits in a nook like him, braiding and unbraiding her antsy daughter’s thick, curly hair, scrunching her eyebrows whenever her eyes flit up towards the large hoard of Weasleys. He would think she would be more comfortable around the group, but like him, he could tell she was suffocating under the large swarm of red hair and loud voices.
With the stealthiness of a ghost, Harry’s gotten closer, his arms brushing against his. Draco almost shivers when he feels the dark hair on Harry’s arm brush against his own nearly hairless forearm. His heart is racing wildly in that same way it does right before he’s about to have an anxiety attack—hard and fast in his chest—but he doesn’t feel like he’s dying like he usually does. Quite the opposite in fact. He feels wholly alive. He feels like he’s found what he was looking for.
Potter puts a steady hand on his son’s bouncing shoulder before Draco can say anything. “Come on Al, let's give them some privacy.” He must see the startled look in Draco’s eyes and for once, decides to spare him the embarrassment.
He raises a brow before wiping the confused expression off of his face and smiling as if that was his intent the entire time. Right, to Muggles, ‘diversity’ meant diverse
“Oh please,” he says once he’s moved a safe distance from the insect. “I’m sure he doesn’t hate your father.”
“Not yet,” Harry hisses pointedly at her, staring her down with a gaze equivalent to a crup ready to attack. Ginevra’s smile is wiped off her face and she winces into her tea, mouthing a sorrowful
Harry’s silent, a thoughtful expression on his face as he takes this in. Then he says, “I knew it, you bloody love this.”
Besides, it would look even worse on Scorpius given that he would be hitting on his teacher and his best friend’s married father.
The tip of his shoe catches on the bottom rung of the chair and he’s never been more grateful for Blaise in his life when he catches him by the arms right before he falls flat on his face.
“Everything is about balance in the universe,” he says in the same soothing voice. “The Moon’s pull causes high and low tides. The Earth’s tilt causes the seasons; change it by merely five degrees and the Earth would never reach equilibrium. A wizard’s magic is just as susceptible to imbalance like everything else. Like the seas and the seasons, magic relies on balance. The moon, the stars, the meteors—they can all cause imbalances in our magical cores. The Full Moon effect I’ve created in this room has caused you to feel unsettled. So go on,” he bends down to his ear. “Cast a
Burning in embarrassment from being caught yelling at an owl, he gives her a stiff wave. “Hullo Miss Norrison.” Shite, he really needs to put up better Muggle repellent charms or else his very nice neighbor will be wary of giving him slices of her homemade cakes.
“Oh come off it Draco,” Parkinson proclaims. “You always were one of the girls. Now you really are!” She doubles over into a fit of cackles at her joke, small tears forming in the corner of her eyes. She really did have an awful laugh, Harry noted, though he was far more preoccupied with the murderous look on Malfoy’s feminine face. He hardly has time to slip out of the corridor undetected when Malfoy pounces on him like a possessed wild cat, pressing him to the wall behind him so hard, he sees stars amidst a flurry of white-blonde hair. Malfoy’s nimble fingers were wrapped around his throat, squeezing until he genuinely feared for his life.
She pushes past the throng of leaving parents and siblings, her feet kicking up some of the centuries old dirt on the platform. Draco tenses. She’s not going to make it. The train is going to leave and Scorpius will be gone, never knowing that his mother was calling for him.
He doesn’t think anything can get worse than that, but he complies because he can feel his orgasm building in the base of his thighs and his mouth is more busy moaning than it is talking. He uses his last spare moment of lucidity to ask Harry to look him in the eye when he comes. He hardly even needs to, because like every time before, Harry does so instinctually.
Harry rose from his seat and began looking for his uniform as well. Once he had found it they all began changing. Hermione had slipped out and gone down to the bathrooms. But Ron and Harry opted to simply close the blinds.
“I tried to forget the way you look, the way you smile, how your cheeks flush when you laugh. I tried to forget the way you get so determined during quidditch. I tried to forget the way your lips felt.”
And just like that food appeared magically upon the tables and the students began stuffing chicken legs and pumpkin pie into their faces.
And just like that Hermione jumped into a long story of how she began a non-profit organization to continue her SPEW campaign she’d started in her fourth year. “But of course before i’m able to move on with it I'll have to graduate” she mentioned. Ron chimed in about what he’d been up to at the burrow but it was a far shorter story that his girlfriends.
“Oh look you got one from Mrs Weasley” Harry through the package at Draco, almost positive he knew what it was, significantly less positive how she knew to make one for Draco.
“Now I understand tensions are high between some of us” she glanced between the returning Slytherins and Gryffindors. “Therefor, to promote house unity you will all be sharing a common room.” Several gasps could be heard from the students.
“You little shit!” Draco tackled Harry trying to get the parchment back, but instead they ended up wrestling until Draco had both of Harry’s wrists pinned down as he held himself above him. “You're so annoying.” he flopped down next to Harry. The homework lay forgotten a few feet away.
He hadn’t attended a class since sixth year and he was afraid he might be rusty. But all his worries were quickly forgotten as he approached the Gryffindor table. Hermione was already sitting at the table chatting with Ginny. Harry sat down across from her so that Ron could sit next to his girlfriend. Ginny shifted in her seat and turned around to talk to one of the 7th year girls. Harry assumed she still wasn’t too happy with him.
“Look, I know we broke up but that doesn't mean you aren't still part of our family.” She smiled up at him. “Mom wants you over for your birthday and she isn't going to take no for an answer.”
“It's the last day before break,” Hermione lectured “are you absolutely sure you two got everything done?”
“If you say so” Ron gave up, seeming at least a little comforted by the idea that he won't be completely abandoning his best friend.
“And oh look at the time” she cheered, pulling harry from his thoughts “you’ve got to get on the train” she began to usher them all towards one of the compartment doors. Handing Ron his bags and waving goodbye to both of them she turned around and jumped into what seemed like an argument with ginny.
Their shoulders were leaned up against each other, Harry’s head was tilted slightly to the side as he watched Draco do his Homework.
A short red headed woman rushed towards them, throwing her arms around Harry and Draco. The gesture had shocked him at first but he sunk into the embrace quickly. She was warm and smelled vaguely of home baked cookies.
Harry began the fight that had replayed in his mind a million times before. Expelliarmus and Avada Kadavra. Fighting against each other. Harry already knew the way this dream would end, but it didn’t stop him from being terrified. He fought and fought putting all of his energy into that one spell. But It was never enough, and Voldemort Won. He saw the jet of green light speeding toward him.
He was considerably taller than Harry and had to tilt his head down to meet him in the eyes. His hair was messy and slightly wet from the shower Harry assumed he had just finished. He was wearing distressed black jeans and a-
“I love you, so much Harry. But I can’t stand it the way you look at me sometimes. You think there’s something wrong with me, I know you do.”
Harry chuckles as he reaches the door, knowing that that was just Malfoy’s way of saying thank you. He turns around and smiles at him. “You’re welcome Malfoy.”
If anyone was obligated to do anything, it was his father who hasn’t cared to respond to a single one of his letters in years. Not the ones Draco sent to him when he was a guideless youth still hoping to maintain some contact with him, not when he did as he was told and married Astoria, not even after Scorpius’ birth and Draco took the initiative to send him photos of his grandson each year of his birthday.
Draco swallows the lump in his throat. Right. He had to leave before his son came home and ask why his father was letting an ex-Death Eater into their home.
Her answer is swift and immediate. “While I’m assuming his life in Paris is nothing like London,” Oh how little does she know, “You should know that I think change is good. And children tend to be more adaptable than we give them credit for Draco.”
Draco tugs at his shirt, forcing their eyes to meet. “I am so bloody serious Harry.” His gut churned at the thought of the results of this decision pushing Harry away.
They’ll rather listen to Jaspers, as if his erroneous tarot reading is more reliable than the proven astronomical laws Draco’s discovered from over ten years of research. The only reason why they haven’t granted him approval is because he was unable to answer any of the board’s questions without flat admitting he didn’t know the answer to a question about his
“It’s not easy you know,” Malfoy murmurs so softly he almost seemed to be speaking to himself. “Not as bad as it is for Muggles but still not easy. There’s only like, four gay blokes in Hogwarts and two of them everyone already knows are together.”
Harry gasps and steps forward. “I didn’t do that! At least not that last part! He’s lying, Hermione, I swear!”
A loud explosion and high pitched scream capture their attention. He looks over to see Ginevra picking the glass of her lilac teacup out of her hair and bloodied freckled skin. She gives them a pained smile. “I can’t believe I’m saying this, but you were right Malfoy.” She hisses in pain, “I think I need to go to the Healer’s.” She picks herself up, eyes aimed at Harry pleadingly. “Come with?”
“Scorpius, why don’t you go play while I talk to Professor Lellory for a moment, hm?” Scorpius is off in a flash, heading towards the direction of a large metal contraption that several other children were climbing on.
From the back of the room, Draco squeaks in abject horror. The air shifts and catches in his throat at the same time, turning against him.
He feels something in his chest snap. “That,” Draco growls, “that right there is what I can’t stand.” Leave it to Harry to prove his point unintentionally. “All you’re doing is telling me the same thing everyone else does. I don’t need to go to a Mind Healer or take those bloody potions. I just need to suck it up, it always passes anyway, just like it did today.”
With a quick treat and a scratch on the head, Draco sends him off, stewing in the realization that in a few days, he is going to be forced into a cramped dinner table to play nice with Weasel and Granger.
He was usually excellent at concealing his emotions through a cool mask of indifference, but Draco doesn’t think he could take another second of this torture. Not-An-Auror Potter was bloody fit, and it was impossible not to notice. His growing desperation was slow and painful; how Harry managed to maintain a composed demeanor baffled him. When it came to Harry, Draco tended to lose all of his steely composure.
Malfoy looks crossed between wanting to spit in his face or laugh in it. “Potter, men will still lust over my arse and tits even if I cover myself from head to toe. So why bother trying to? I see this as just making the best of an awful situation.” He gives Harry a pointed look. “I can’t control other people’s thoughts about me, but I can control how I feel about myself. And I have to admit Potter, I feel quite nice in these clothes.” He smirks, gazing appreciatively down at his sculpted physique. “So cut me some slack, will you?”
His fingers clench around the damp green table cloth. He tilts his head, tries to look at her from a different angle than how he usually does.
They watch Albus grab Scorpius’ hand and begin to race as fast as they could onto the train, their trunks and owls rolling sluggishly behind them.
managed to sparse up a quality joke or two. This bloke looked as if he took it up the arse and had something else up there already. It was unbelievable that
Harry, for all intents and purposes, seems to not only be the Vanquisher of the Dark Lord, an amazing cook, and the most stubbornly annoying prat Draco had ever met, but he also happened to be a bloody fantastic cocksucker as well. Draco loves a man of many talents.
He doesn’t mention Fred, he doesn’t have to. The pain that flickers past her blue eyes when he mentions Death Eaters speaks for itself.
The old floors squeak as he walks to the yellow kitchen and Draco softens his footfalls, careful not to make too much noise in a space that wasn’t meant for him.
Harry places a hand on Draco’s elbow. “Just think about it Draco, for children, sometimes ignorance is bliss.” His face sours. “Trust me.”
Without warning a wild-haired, tanned child with a jungle of dark hair, suddenly breezes in between the two adults, in a race to the playing area, running like he’s about to miss the Hogwarts Express. Draco briefly recalls that it’s the same dark-haired child that runs into the school building every morning. It’s almost endearing that the boy enthusiastically races everywhere.
Ginny’s mouth is in a tight ball as she says, “Luna, Draco, I’m so sorry. Please don’t think any of this is your fault.” They both begin to protest her apology but she cuts them off. “No, you two deserve an apology. Please believe me when I say that James will give you both a formal one once this mess is sorted out.”
Draco stuffs his wrist into his mouth, biting down to stifle his moan when he thinks of those tiny freckles on Potter’s face gleaming in the winter sunlight like stars.
” Malfoy snarled, attempting to grab at Harry’s throat but narrowly missing when Snape forcefully pushed him back down into his chair. Which wasn’t hard given well, his…
Malfoy squirms at the word ‘crush’. “He’s not my crush. He’s just this guy I’ve liked for forever.” Harry resists the urge to point out that that was in fact, exactly what the word crush meant. “But,” he continues, “it’s so obvious that he’s straight.”
“This is incredible Draco,” Harry breathes, his eyes glued to the shining sky above. “How come I never see so many stars where I live?”
know how to do it yet I don’t? I refuse to believe that you’re more cultured than me,” He mumbles around his baby-feed sushi roll.
It was the most believable lie he could come up with in such a short amount of time. And Ron being dense didn't question it which seemed to ease the tension in Malfoy's shoulders.
“I have a crush on Draco Malfoy” Harry blurted out, turning to her with the most terrified look on his face.
Harry couldn't forget. It's not like he didn't try, he tried so hard. But his mind kept wandering back to the feeling of lips on his, the warmth of Draco’s hand rested on his waist.
He took his seat next to Ron, Hermione had insisted on sitting in the front row so they could have professor slughorn's utmost attention. Ron didn't seem particularly pleased but he was willing to make some allowances for his girlfriend, Harry smiled at that.
“Come on!” Harry leapt up grabbing Draco's arms and heaving him off the couch. “We’ve got to get to breakfast so we’ll have enough time for Hogsmeade!”
He was startled back to reality when he heard a shaken gasp followed by the sound of Draco’s curtains being pulled back. He instinctively jumped out of bed to check on him.
Harry rose from his bed the next morning exhausted. Still terrorized by his nightmare, He hadn’t been able to fall back asleep so instead resorted to staring at the wall while the scent of parchment and the sound of Ron's snoring filled his senses.
Harry had never asked why Malfoy was always down here so early, Malfoy had never asked Harry either. It was an unspoken agreement between them.
And with a few goodbyes and some more checks from Hermione the two lovebirds were off for their Christmas break at the Weasleys
When the sun finally began to rise Harry decided it was time to start the day. He pushed himself up with his hands and stared down at the other boy for a few seconds. Malfoy had Craned his neck up and they were staring directly at each other.
Harry joked around with all of his friends for the remainder of breakfast. It felt like he was a completely normal student for once, and without the imminent threat of death he could finally relax.
Draco had to remind himself that there was time when he didn't have Harry, and he managed just fine. Worst case scenario he would just go back to being a snotty death eater.
He pulled it over his head “oh yeah this is comfortable” he leaned back on the couch. A small smile on his lips.
His eyes had wandered to the long table near the left wall. Harry wasn’t exactly sure how many of the Slytherins would have returned but he immediately recognized Blaise, Pansy, and of course Draco Malfoy.
Hermione took a step around Harry and enveloped Draco in a hug just like the one she’d given Harry. It warmed his heart to know that Hermione had been so welcoming so quickly.
“It's comfortable,” Malfoy defended himself, Before pushing around Harry and walking away. Malfoy had seemed to speak only a few words every time they met before fleeing. Why was he running away?
Harry was full on laughing now. He placed a small kiss on Draco’s cheek before shoving a chocolate frog into his chest. “Calm down, we’ll be there soon. You have nothing to worry about.”
His eyes were heavy, his posture slouched, but most importantly a large cut reached from the edge of his eyebrow to the side of his face. If Harry and MAlfoy were friends he would've asked if he was ok, if they were friends he would’ve grabbed his face to inspect the cut, if they were friends he would've pestered him until he figured out what happened.
And after what seemed like only a few minutes, they had finished all their dessert. And were beginning to rise from their tables. The prefects were ushering new coming 1st years to the dormitories. “All eighth years please follow me” called McGonagall from the podium.
He had apparently fallen asleep on the couch while studying. Draco was still crouched on the floor working on homework. He whipped his head around when he heard Harry wake.
“Oh Draco checked it out” Harry said, completely oblivious to the words that had just come out of his mouth.
Draco laughs in a light, cheery sound that he hasn’t heard come out of his mouth in years. Almost like a giggle. Almost. He straightens Harry’s glasses because he hates when they were crooked slightly to the left. “No, I’m not. I’m just the one who hasn’t had a blowjob since fifth year.”
“I…” she swallows, looking nervously at the four pairs of eyes staring at her, waiting for her to make the wrong move or to say the wrong thing. Then she looks only at Draco, licking her dry lips. “I hope you don’t mind. I gave him the signet. You never came back for it at our— at the house.”
He wasn’t a teenager anymore. Draco knows he feels something irreplaceable for Harry; he’s never needed a grand moment of clarity to figure that out. He trusts him with Scorpius, and even though he hasn’t said it, from the way Harry’s eyes widened when Draco Floo-called him tonight, he knows it too. He trusts him with a lot of things, including his secrets and his body.
Pansy hadn’t given birth yet, the Healer saying something about her not being dilated yet. They estimate that it'll be another seven hours before she can start labor so there was no reason to stick around. He’ll be back in the morning of course, but for now, he’d rather sleep on his personal black-haired pillow than in a stiff hospital chair.
Jaw set into a stringently sharp line he says, “What is this, some sort of test? To see what exactly?” His chin is quivering and he just might scream from the entire bloody situation.
His home is dark when they Apparate into the bottom floor, with only small particles of dust glittering in the moonlight to greet him. With Scorpius at his mother’s for the night, the home is a manifestation of his worst fears. A cold, empty house devoid of the presence of another person.
Either Malfoy must have superhuman hearing or he was just finely attuned to know exactly when to fuck with him because a swing of long blonde hair later and pewter eyes glittering with mischief are staring straight at the Gryffindor table.
As of now, he was resolved to think only about Quidditch for the next hour and a half, but Hermione had just got done chastising him and Ron for spending their free time playing pickup games than studying. And worse of all, Malfoy seemed to have discovered the world of Muggle sportswear.
Albus skips back over to the nurse’s bed and watches him with unnervingly bright and awaiting eyes. Someone should really tell him that it was a bit unsettling to watch a person so intently as they gather their nerve to sing.
Regardless, he’ll walk past them with his head held high and his rejection letter clutched in his fist. Not because he was the same snobby arsehole who thought he was better than everyone anymore, but because Draco’s come to realize that he
He stuffs his face with the dry piece of toast, uncaring about how uncouth it looks. “Let’s maybe not talk about it.”
She points to the same spot her eyes were focused on. “Tell those two to get a room,” she says right before Floos herself out of the house.
Draco laughs. “Whatever. But I have to disagree. I think I like the reality more than the fantasy.” He wiggles his hips, relieved to find that the pain has settled into nothing more than a dull pinch. “I think I’m okay now.”
“Wait, Scorpius!” He drew his son back towards him, outwardly shaking with nerves. Yes, this was his idea and yes, he shouldn’t be nearly as nervous as he was, but for the love of all things magic if he didn’t want to just Disapparate them both back to the empty-walled safety of their new home at this very moment.
“Ha! That’s rich coming from the same boy who befriended him. I don’t think you’re the best judge of character, kid.”
The Malfoy ring. In his haste to leave France he had forgotten all about it until now. It was such an important amulet passed down from generation to generation, that he can’t believe he had forgotten about it. He can just see it now, the metal ring that had been lying on his bedside table for months, collecting dust as he cultivated a life here with Scorpius and Harry, forgetting entirely about it till this very moment.
He wipes his face. “Every time I take my eyes off of him, there’s a risk that it could…” His breath hitches, “it could happen again.” Not wanting to explain his fears, he squeezes his eyes shut and buries his face back into the safety of his palms. “You can say it. I’m an awful excuse for a father and I know I am.”
Harry shakes his head in a so-so kind of way. “Pretty good so far. There weren't many disruptions in class, my lesson plans have been approved by my blonde, bratty boss, and I finally fulfilled an old fantasy of mine.”
She looks around for any nosy students then leans in, curling a manicured hand under his jaw to bring his ear near her red lips. “The password is…
“Wha— uh yeah I’m fine!” He fixes the collar of his robes and clears his throat. “Completely normal. But uhh, thanks for asking, yeah?”
His thumbs twiddle nervously. “Sometimes my Dad gets nervous. Like, really, really nervous. I don’t know why but his hands will like, shake ‘nd stuff.” Scorpius lays his head on his hands, blowing a breath into the flames. “It’s weird. I never know what to do.”
” Harry reminded him, forcing himself to tear his eyes away from him. “Right Ron?” He looks over at him, to see his best friend nearly drooling at Draco Malfoy’s voluptuous arse. He deftly swats him on the shoulder. “
Of all things, he can still remember the wilted plant in their bathroom that Draco had asked her to water while he was away for that week. Such a simple, mundane task. Yet when he came back, Scorpius hadn’t been to school for days and the plant was brittle with neglect and sitting in a pile of its own dead leaves.
him on his work desk. He is so tooth-achingly sweet, and the crazy part was that Draco knows that it is entirely earnest.
He groans a little as he takes the envelope from her, knowing that his friends would hop on this moment like the animals they were and taunt him relentlessly about it. That was the thing about his best friends, they never cared who was in the room with him, because their main prerogative was to embarrass the hell out of Draco no matter the situation.
Draco opens his mouth to reply with some snarky comment that he wouldn’t compliment him if he was the last man on earth, but then he quickly closes it. It wasn’t true, was it? He could pretend all he wants that Potter’s little performance wasn’t incredible, but it wouldn’t do either of them any good to lie.
“Bloody hell,” Draco breathes, still looking at the fireplace as the flames turn back to their original striking orange hue. His best friends were going to be parents. Today. Now.
Malfoy’s face shifts from shock, to indignation, before finally settling on exasperation. “Potter!” He rubs his temples. “I’m only going to ask you this one time. How in the
Pansy laughs loudly, hiccuping when her laughter dies down and is replaced with snickering. “Merlin, your kid is fucking hilarious.”
He can’t afford any more mistakes. If evenly cut carrots is his way of making up for some of his sins, so be it.
Though Eighth years weren’t permitted to play for their house, no one could stop him from playing a quick pick up game. Unfortunately, today’s match would be against Malfoy and the Slytherins. He can only hope that a Bludger knocks Malfoy out for long enough for the anti-potion to be brewed and for everything to return to normal.
Draco turns and sees his son, all wind-blown silver-blonde hair and redden cheeks sprinting towards him with his arms outstretched. Draco smiled and opened his arms to catch him. Scorpius was a little too big to be picked up and coddled anymore but Draco didn’t care. He was planning on picking him up for as long as he could.
“Harry!” He grabs Harry’s hand, giving it a hardy shake. Harry looks a bit rattled by the action. “How are ya mate? How’s the wife?”
He falls back into the bed once Harry drags him away. His muscles sigh in relief at the soft comfort and Draco promises himself to remember his age more often. That was the best thing about being an adult—he can always blame everything on being old.
Malfoy gives him a small smirk and shakes his head. His hair was out of its ponytail, falling down his back in an attractively messy curtain. He runs a hand through it, messing it up even more. “Oh never mind, you’re a big boy, you know the way.” When he gives him a sly wink, Ron abruptly stands up, apparently having had enough teasing.
Harry’s booming laughter stops a few people short around them. He inches his fingers around Draco’s waist, pulling him closer. “Oh Draco, those two are
“I love you,” He kisses the top of his sweaty forehead. “And in case you need to hear it in a different language—
Draco spoons way too much sugar in his tea, just to give his hands something to do. “Fine. Great, I guess. Gah, I don’t know?! Sweet Salazar, he told me that I
“We have to do that again!” Lily insists once they’re off the wheel. Potter gently reminds her that it was past five and Scorpius and Albus were probably looking for them. Draco silently lingers behind them. Anyone looking close enough could see the pieces of his shattered pride trailing behind him.
. Like a dragon. Like the stars. His name was Draco, though he’d have never known it if he spent all his time around Potter. He leans back against the cool glass and hiccups once more. “So you do know my name?” He quips sardonically. He smiles lazily up at him, one arm strewn carelessly over his alcohol filled stomach and the cool glass soothing his buzzing thoughts. Potter’s voice was beginning to sound distant, hollow, like he was talking to him through a long tunnel.
Potter scratches the back of his head, an embarrassed blush creeping into his cheeks. “Yeah… I mean no! No, I was just wondering if you and Scorp were doing anything this Saturday?”
This time he really smiles; a large, toothy one. For a moment it feels like they are on even ground. The threat of a hurt child will do that to a person he supposes, even to two people who naturally loathe each other.
He may have not been drugged, but he had something he had to say as well. “I love your dimples. It should be illegal for you to have them.” He pushes Harry’s hair back. He sighs at the touch, long and hard on his face. “I love how you sing—you can’t, so I shouldn’t love it, but I do. I love how easy you are with children and your storytelling.”
A dark brow raises. “You actually never said it back.” The cheeky grin on his face disappears and he stutters out, “I-I mean, you don’t have to. I’m not making you. Erm, like I could make you do anything anyway, I mean you’re Draco fucking Malfoy you wouldn’t breathe if I told you to, obviously. So, uh, just ignore what I said it was stupid. Say whatever you want, because…yeah.”
Potter snorts and he begins to whisk some yellow, slippery-looking sludge in a bowl. He won’t ask, namely because it’s humiliating, but he’s about ninety percent sure that that’s what eggs look like before they’re cooked.
He’s only ever conscious of two things when flying: the gold Snitch zipping cheekily from his grasp and the familiar warmth of Malfoy’s body as he races beside him to catch it.
“They do matter, but the fact that you insist on staying away from me doesn’t help anyone understand them. Maybe that would change if you would just talk to me.”
It’s insulting really. Several wizarding hospitals in France have gratefully accepted his theories as truth and now utilizes them in their Preventive Care Unit. If it weren’t for him, there would be far more unsuspecting witches or wizards that land themselves a day trip to the Healers because they casted a heating or cooling charm on the day of a Total Eclipse.
Draco pretends he doesn’t hear him, scowling off into the distance as if he doesn’t exist. Harry Potter hasn’t existed in his world for years now. Draco was determined to continue that streak even if Potter wasn’t.
Draco opens his mouth to say that he wasn’t quite sure Pygmy Puffs should be fed overcooked spaghetti noodles, but it was already said and done. Princess could probably eat a Snitch and still be up and rolling around the next day. If not, there were plenty of other purple Pygmy Puffs for sale.
Harry winces when he realizes he was still on top of Malfoy and quickly rolls off of him. He notices how Malfoy takes a deep breath of air once he is finally off of his chest. Salazar, maybe it really wasn’t a fair fight. His cheeks are flushed a deep red and his hair is scattered wildly around his head, forming a sleek, silvery halo. Hermione helps Malfoy up off the ground and Harry notices just how much taller Malfoy was than Hermione. Though he was now slightly shorter than before, he still was much taller than the average girl. The stupid git looked like an Amazonian goddess.
Harry sneaks a quick glance over at Ron, who was sweating bullets and staring at Malfoy’s chest and tiny waist with cloudy, lust-filled eyes. He steps on his foot to snap him out of it.
“It’s just like flying on a broom,” Potter whispers to him, the words damp on his cheek. Pulling back, he smiles encouragingly as if to ease his nerves, not knowing that he’s only succeeding in lighting them on fire.
One day, Draco will snap on Jace Jaspers. He’ll probably be placed in a cell next to his father for all eternity but sweet Merlin would it be worth it.
Draco shushes him gently and guides him back over to the nurses’ bed. Ana works on bandaging the fairly small cuts on Albus’s arm as he watches the two with sharp green eyes. Hovering over his son’s weeping body, Draco notes that Albus Potter looked rather protective of Scorpius. It must run in the family.
Draco‘s eyes feel like they're about to pop out of his skull. Oh shite. “I… I’m so sorry for being so rude, I didn’t realize—”
“I’ll see what I can do. In the meantime, you really should avoid Malfoy at all costs. I don’t think I’ve ever heard you speak this crudely about a woman—I mean, er— a
Next time, he’d make sure to have Malfoy trip into a balding potion. See how arrogant he’ll be after that.
Harry thinks but he keeps his comment to himself. Mainly because he wasn’t one to speak, what with his unruly mess of hair and because he was genuinely worried about Malfoy. He wondered if there were any potential side effects of the potion that was causing him to feel and look so awful.
But Pansy isn’t listening to him. Her left leg is bouncing rapidly in anger and Draco can tell it’s all she can do not to Apparate to France and slice Astoria in half. “I’ll fuck that bitch up if I see her,” Harry whimpers behind him as if he wasn’t the most powerful wizard alive, “As soon as I lose this water weight,
The small wrinkle that forms in between Astoria’s eyebrows when she scowls fills his mind. Her Patronus calling his name rings around in his head.
“C’mon, we’ll go Floo them so you can see. I promise you he’s fine.” Potter calmly leads him down the stairs, his arm never leaving Draco’s shaking shoulder as they walk.
“Malfoy, I haven’t seen you for over ten years and this is the first thing you say when I see you?” She shakes her head, burying her face back into the Quidditch magazine she was reading. “Harry, darling, your boyfriend is quite the handful I see.”
Ana does a poor job of holding back the dejected sigh on her lips. “Oh, he’s actually out at the moment and has a supply for his class today.” Her shoulders slump and he wonders what she’s not telling him. “Such a shame…”
A bell is rung, and children begin to file into the building, with one particularly excited dark-haired child frantically shoving through the sea of students without care and sprinting into the building.
Like the fact that Harry’s fingers are always in his hair, so much so that Draco hardly even notices that they’re there until his braid is undone and his hair is flowing free around his face. He’s constantly undoing his tight braid, claiming that he likes his hair unbraided better and promising that if Draco gives it a chance, he would too.
The song Draco is forced to sing is Nothing Is Too Wonderful To Be True from the musical Dirty Rotten Scoundrels.
White teeth sink happily into the gooey chocolate treat, a low, guttural moan escapes Malfoy’s lips as he eats.
“I was just asking you a question. Don’t take this the wrong way but…” he scrubs a hand through his hair, his thick fingers musing up the dark strands into an attractive mess. He feels another strange tug in his stomach. “Compared to you, Scorpius reads to me as a bit… gosh, what’s the best word for it...”
Yet watching Harry attempt to sing songs to Scorpius, Albus, and Lily’s amused faces made him realize that he cared for him far deeper than he realized.
The trace of a smile tugs at the corners of Harry’s buried face and Draco can’t help but replicate it even though he can’t see it. Love. The word had always been there on the tip of his tongue, straining to get out. There was something uniquely powerful about giving voice to the feeling. Even after he accidentally kicked the shite out of Harry.
Lifting his face from the pie he was shoveling in his mouth, George feigns innocence, his eyes too wide and his face too open to be believable. He looks around at the red freckled faces of his family members, his too long hair flying around his full cheeks. “What do you mean what did
Growling, Harry pins him down on the desk, all traces of his previous nerves gone as Draco further tempts him, sucking each finger free of the disgusting mint substance and laughing at Harry’s frustration.
“Maybe we can see what he used and try to make our own anti-potion. You know for that, erm, blonde problem.”
during the Orionids Meteor Shower. The results were promising but tiring to obtain. On top of that, he had spent the previous night up with Scorpius to help him with his homework. He doesn’t know if it’s because he was a wizard or because of his own ignorance, but Muggle science was unimaginably difficult. How in the hell was Draco supposed to know the cycle of photosynthesis?
Sighing, Harry scrubs his face. “Well Burns was talking about Lebanese people and Al very excitedly stated that his mother was a lesbian.”
Harry’s jaw drops slightly at the sight of the previously calmly spinning water fountain and soft ripples transformed into a bowl full of high, violent tides. High tides are natural for a Full Moon and by the look on Harry’s face, he knows this too.
Just thinking about being in the same room with Granger and Weasley makes his tongue dry and his skin prickle with perspiration. Yet he impulsively takes out a stray parchment paper and quill, resolving himself not to let his own insecurities ruin a good thing. Harry is a good thing and he would be a fool to not do this for him.
Unfortunately, it meant that he would have to go to Pansy’s to get it. Not that he didn’t love his best friend, but being cooped up in the house had taken a toll on her.
Scorpius tugs on his shirt sleeve, squinting up at him from behind his black glasses. “You look loopy.”
Draco blinks in surprise. Usually when people see Harry, they don’t immediately place him under the title as his boyfriend. Usually they shove Draco out of the way and gush over Harry Potter,
“Oh, Ginny was going to bring someone…” Potter responds flippantly. “But it doesn’t really matter, they’re yours now. So what do you say?” He takes out two rectangular pieces of paper, waving them in his face with an amused grin.
“Don’t bother, he’s staying with us forever!” He hears Scorpius’ shrieking laughter as Pansy begins to tickle him again. “Who knew Draco would produce someone this cute!”
Harry holds up a finger and summons his bag from across the room. He pulls out several sheets from the classes Malfoy missed today and handed it to him. “Like your schoolwork. I went to your classes and picked up your work for today.”
” Hermione’s eyes light up and he can practically see her browsing through her mental library for the uses of the eggs. “Goodness, that stuff is rare to get, how did you manage to have enough to make so many?”
Ron pats him on the back. “That was a one-time occurrence. Prepare yourself for a lot more sabotaging from now on mate.”
He puts his hands on his hips. “Oh really? And say, if everyone jumped off a cliff, would you do it as well?” He raises an eyebrow at his son.
“I suppose you may be correct this one time. Now if you’ll excuse me, I have a research proposal that needs to be rejected.”
an excuse.” Harry sounded exhausted and he looked half-dead. He must not be sleeping well. “I’m sorry, to you also.”
It’s such a simple shift in perspective, really. But it’s one that makes a world of a difference. His features lose some of the harsh definition that he’s been so accustomed to seeing and he looks impossibly young. Draco concedes that Harry may be right. Along with a multitude of other things that Draco refuses to admit defeat on.
“You’re crazy,” Harry murmurs, though the comforting lull of Draco’s fingers and the calming sounds of the lapping water pull him under their spell.
“I’m sorry.” He really hadn’t meant for him to see any of that. Those sort of emotions are supposed to be private, hidden. Draco buries his nose in his stomach. “Won't happen again.” A nagging voice in the back of his head tells him that if he just takes those potions, it really won’t happen again. Only, the voice sounds too much like Astoria and he blocks it out.
But no, learning of his divorce from a marriage he arranged was too much for poor Lucius Malfoy to bear. So much so that after thirteen years, he decided to write him back a fucking note to shame him for his actions.
“We’ll get there.” His head was pounding from today and he wanted nothing more than to curl up with Harry in front of the fireplace. Intrusive thoughts invade his mind and his fingers begin to shake.
hold this over them for the rest of their miserable lives.” He holds up his small fist and shakes it in the air like a victorious gladiator. “They’ll rue the day they first wanked over me!”
, but I don’t have anyone else to talk to about this so can you please put your heterosexuality aside for just ten minutes?”
Albus steps up and places a chubby hand on his arm. “Come on Scorp, I’m fine, see?” He waves his plastered arms around for emphasis. “I’m not mad at you. I could never be mad at you.”
Ron whimpers and rubs his hit shoulder. “Ow. It’s not my fault you accidentally made Malfoy into a super hot bint while also giving him the seductive prowess of a Veela.”
The incantation doesn’t even have to leave his lips, his buzzing magic doing the work for him. The fire that bursts from his wand destroys the pile in a matter of seconds, turning it into one of Draco’s favorite things—ash.
“Now that's just not true” he tackled Draco grabbing the paper out of his hands. Low and behold he'd marked off a dozen misspellings.
“Oh uhm I don't really know” Harry hadn't thought about it yet. “I can't really go to the Weasleys so I'll probably just stay here”
His Bleach-blonde hair was visible in the very back of the room. Sitting at a table with Blaise. HArry was however far more interested in the two people sitting in front of them.
Harry was eating splayed across his bed, the cover’s half falling off, a box of chocolates perched precariously on the edge. Harry himself looked positively fantastic. He was wearing a red sweater and khaki pants, his hair a jumbled mess like always and his glasses slightly askew.
He wasn't sure why he wanted to get anywhere with Malfoy. But he was intrigued, Malfoy had shown some civility, Harry wanted to see if he could get him to show some kindness.
Harry had expected his new found revelation to change something between him and Draco but he found they were still the same. Even if his gaze lingered a little longer and his cheeks flushed pink when Draco chewed on the end of his quill.
“This is the sorting hat” Mcgonagall announced. “It will sort you into your house. And she pulled a roll of parchment from under her and began calling names. Several of them went to Gryffindor, A couple Slytherins, and a handful of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs. But harry was hardly paying attention.
The room was just as Harry left it, his bed unmade, his trunk opened, his pajamas tossed half-hazardly into the corner. But a presence caught Harry's attention before he could deal with the mess.
“She's complicated,” Draco sighs “I love her, but she loves my father. And that's where we just don't relate.”
He made his way down to the painting, tickled the pear, and stepped into the kitchens. It was the millionth time Harry had been down there in the middle of the night, the house elves barely bat an eye. But someone was startled.
I put off writing this chapter for a while because I wasn't sure how I wanted to do it, but her it finally is. this fic was so much fun writing and im so excited to write more! thank to all you lovely people who've left comments and kudos!
“You fell asleep dude” harry exclaimed, pulling Ron up “we should get dressed” he suggested. Ron walked over to his trunk and began sifting through his things. Harry did the same and they both changed.
Harry figured McGonagall had continued reading out names but he had completely zoned out. Transfixed with the idea of sharing a room with Malfoy for a whole year. He’d see him brush his teeth and climb under the covers, and oh my god he would see Malfoy change. Harrys face flushed hot red.
Draco, for no explainable reason other than because they want to be. I’m not letting you overthink yourself out of a good opportunity.” Despite his shorter height, Draco feels six inches tall at Harry’s logical dressing down. He’s very good at those, and he can only guess which curly-haired witch he learned this particular skill from.
He lets them ask as many questions they can think of and even manages to convince several students that aliens are in fact real. The last question allowed is asked by a girl who raises her hand in the same studious manner as a young Hermione Granger, only she has her hair plaited in meticulously neat Dutch braids. She asks in a clear voice, “Why did you choose to study astronomy Mr. Malfoy?”
He hardly ever drinks the stuff anymore; Firewhiskey was for kids and rightfully so. It was made to get someone as drunk as a skunk in two gulps. How he ever managed to consume so much of it in school that Pansy would joke that his blood was no longer pure was beyond him. In his humble opinion, smoking gillyweed was far better than downing a pint.
They welcome him as warmly as they can muster. Granger squeezes his arm and Weasley gives his hand two quick shakes before stuffing his hand back into his pocket.
Shite. He regrets investing in the Muggle phone Blaise recommended as every person in the room stops and stares for the source of the buzzing. He fumbles the phone terribly, his shaking hands causing the thing to slide through his fingers and clatter against the floor.
Disgruntled, Draco turns his full attention back to the calculations he had been solving before Harry came and started criticizing his work.
Foreign hands roam down the length of his braid and down to the crease of his thigh and Draco moans, his own hands unconsciously inching slowing towards the pulsing heat curled between Harry’s legs, moving closer and closer to his—
Harry gestures to the kitchen table, indicating for him to sit. After a moment’s hesitation, he does, assuming that his too was a long story. He sits in the same spot as he did last time he was here, red eyed and with Firewhiskey for blood. Sitting in the seat doesn’t feel nearly as invasive as it did last time, now that he knows he wasn’t sitting in his wife’s seat. Or putting his hands on her dinner table.
He shrugs. “Maybe what had gotten you in such a foul mood that you resorted to stumbling around Diagon Alley pissed and ready to hex off strange men’s bollocks? Skeeter is always looking for a juicy story you know.”
Malfoy shoots out of his slumped position and snarls at him. “My fault?! Had you not been a lazy imbecile and done the most basic research you would have known to use Goosegrass
And then because he doesn't give a damn about appearances anymore, Draco scurries to the back of the room and slumps into his original seat, wishing that Potter could just do him a solid this one time and redirect the attention away from him.
Potter, who had been staring at him with intense green eyes, nods hurriedly after a moment. “Uh, yeah. We should go.”
“Told you.” He swoops down and picks Harry’s dropped wand off of the ground, holding it in the center of his palm for him to take. Tentative fingers grasp around the holly wood and he lets out an audible sigh of relief when the wand doesn’t react negatively at his touch.
He turns around and gives them all a piercing glare. “Hush, all of you! I need to focus. Potter watch my back.”
“Hey, it’s okay, it’s normal.” He rubs Malfoy’s back in what he hopes is a soothing gesture. Though it wasn’t particularly pleasant, Harry was thankful that it wasn’t some weird side effect of the potion. This at least was manageable. And non-magical.
The effect is immediate. “What did you do?” He looks at the length of holly up and down with suspicious eyes. His neck tenses again.
did you Potter?” He holds out the crook of his arm and guides Harry to the crowded floor. The whispers and shocked gasps grow louder. “Can you even imagine me in one of those frilly get-ups, prancing around like a wayward trollop?” He just so happens to stomp past a group fourth year witches decked out in fulsomely frilly dresses. Harry shoots them an apologetic look in response to their screwed glares.
Merlin, after Skeeter wrote that article about me and Harry in school, there was nothing I hated more. Everyone is judging you, looking at you. It’s awful.”
“Relax, Harry,” he says gently, “I simply intensified the natural vibrations already occurring in your wand so that you can feel it. Nothing fancy. Wands are alive you know—in their own weird, magical way.” Ollivander nearly pissed himself in delight when Draco went to gather information from him several years ago. “You should know by now that your wand is simply a natural extension of your magic. When you feel unbalanced, your wand will internalize that imbalance in any spells you cast.”
Draco pinches him as hard as he can with the box in his arms. Last night he attempted to cook a very nice dinner for Harry and the children only for all of them to feed the pasta he slaved over to those sodding Pygmy Puffs. Apparently, there was a thing as ‘too much’ seasoning. It still sounds made up.
Harry Potter: Savior of the Wizarding World, Vanquisher of the Dark Lord, Fantastic Cockersucker, and Most Definitely
Turning back to his son’s teacher, he smiles politely, recalling their conversation before a certain rude-mannered creature interrupted them. “Well, I was just about to say that you can call me Draco, Ana. Now if I may ask, how has Scorpius been adjusting so far? I know it’s only the first week but with us not being in Paris and all…”
Harry’s face falls in concern. “Draco?” His breath hitches again. He swallows, shifting nervously on his feet. “I’m sorry, was this stupid? It was probably stupid. Both Ginny and Hermione said that I should try work on romance because apparently I’m terrible at it and I saw how you looked when Luna brought Ginny flowers and I just thought that maybe…”
He was determined to get to the bottom of it, and he wasn’t above using a bit of stalking to find out. When he searches for Malfoy’s name on the map, the tiny red dot was stationary in the Slytherin dungeons. He gulps. Merlin, he did not want to go back into Slytherin, but it was necessary.
With a raised brow, Draco asks, “Jaspers, why do you keep talking to me? Everyone else here ignores me.”
A strangled noise of embarrassment and anxiety squeezed the life out of his lungs, all while he was standing there smiling like a fool under Ana’s patient gaze. His hands started doing weird motions in the air as he tried to articulate a well-scripted lie that didn’t make him out to sound like a complete nutter.
“Potter,” she grabs his hand once he’s down from the ladder and gives it a quick shake. “Nice finally seeing you after all these years, sorry for trying to hand you over to the Dark Lord and all that shite, though congrats on becoming fit as hell and bagging this hot piece of—”
Blaise and Pansy wanting to shag his son’s teacher however? A very unpleasant shock to his already weary system.
Trying to hide his displeasure, Draco pretends to scan the park for something interesting to do. Which, the most interesting thing he can think of was finding somewhere to eat and sitting down. His calves would be burning soon.
Potter fixes him with a searing gaze. “Aur… Circe Malfoy, how many sodding times do I—!” He balls his hand into a fist. Draco winces at the sharpest of his tone and he holds his hands up defensively. Why was Potter so snappish about the Aurors?
Draco reads the paper, his eyes flashing and his jaw tightening with each word he reads. Potter was a dead man walking, that’s for sure.
Draco’s stomach clenches when Potter’s deep voice grazes his ear. He glowers at him. Someone really needed to teach Harry Potter how to be a straight man. Someone should tell Potter that Draco refused to sacrifice any more of his sanity because of his own unawareness of how to act his sexuality. Whispering like that in his ear would give anyone the wrong ideas.
He looks at Scorpius, who was currently balancing his wand in between his upper lip and nose for the entertainment of Prince and Albus.
His white face turns an awful shade of red when he looks down and sees his unzipped trousers. Parents snicker into their elbows and two girls in the back of the classroom nearly fall out of their seats with laughter.
“Snape likes to teach me special potions for fun sometimes,” Malfoy says. Harry wrinkles his nose for real this time. What kind of psychopath willingly takes extra Potions lessons, from Snape of all people, for fun?! “You want to know what he taught me to brew today?”
With some effort, Draco untangles his and Harry’s connected fingers. Draco gives him a sympathetic look. Harry doesn’t even spare a passing glance at him as he follows James upstairs, letting go of his hand with one quick shake in front of everyone.
Potter yawns, throwing down his crumpled napkin onto his empty plate. “Let’s hope Gin takes her time bringing the kids home today. Al would probably badger you with questions.”
He wonders if Harry will. Burning green eyes stare down at him and he thinks possibly he wasn’t giving Harry’s emotional intelligence enough credit. “I know.”
There’s silence as his words settle between them and Draco settles with the knowledge that he just explained his greatest source of anxiety to the person who must be the greatest prat of all.
Harry gives him a sheepish smile. “Sorry, kinda dropped the uh… yeah.” He moves to run his hands through his hair but wisely stops right when he remembers the slick liquid covering his palms. Draco raises a brow before his eyes locate some of the stuff smeared on the classroom floor, a slippery mess of it lying not too far from where the black bottle was.
“And?” Harry drawls, refusing to take such a simple response as an answer. “I know there has to be some other reason. You never were the type of person to dedicate yourself to something unless you were very passionate about it.”
He chews his lip, trying to recall off the top of his head if there was anything on his wall of reminders that would advise him to stay inside and away from black-haired temptations. Though the more he thinks about it, it seems that the universe is doing everything it can to push Potter and him into these situations.
Dinner with Pansy and Blaise is always a loud affair. For one because Pansy had an innate inability to speak quietly and two because she and Blaise are, to put it frankly, complete arseholes. Draco knew that it was going to be especially bad tonight seeing that it’s been weeks since he’s last visited them. Harry has not only consumed his mind but his time as well.
Between her and Ginny, they manage to corral the scattered players into their respective positions in the air, patiently waiting for Terry Boot to release the game balls and start the bloodbath.
He stops short when he notices the dark shadow looming over him. Harry looks up and stares into the black eyes of Professor Snape. “You’ll do no such thing, Potter.” Harry gulps, feeling an involuntary chill run down his spine. “10 points from Gryffindor for your vile comments. And detention. For a
But when did Draco ever deserve a miracle? “What if he’s trying to set me up? What if he’s lying just to get back at me for all those times I snapped at him? What if his uncle hates—”
He’s driving himself spare worrying about Scorpius, Albus, Astoria, even Harry when he’s not at arm’s reach from him. He feels a lot like a caged dog, pacing around in his crate to keep from going mad. Trying to find something that isn’t there.
“Now get your arse up and stop feeling like a failure. You’re a good father Malfoy, carry yourself like one. Trust me, the kicked puppy attitude isn’t a good look on you.”
Now Draco loves Scorpius, more than he’s ever loved anyone or anything in his life, but good Merlin, he wonders how well he actually knew his son sometimes. As Draco watches him and Albus play, he wonders when his son became so…
He needs to compromise, because that’s the thing about Harry Potter—he’s never doing to get everything he wants with him. He thinks he can compromise; he thinks. Give a little, get a little. A type of balance he never had with Astoria.
It’s frightening the way he wants him— unashamed and sacrificial— his tongue ready to mark his throat at the flick of a wand.
Draco swivels around in the small chair, fixing him with a dangerous glare. “I beg your pardon?” He and Potter instinctively freeze when one of the children yawns, relaxing only when the little boy sighs softly and goes back to sleep.
He sits down on his knees next to Harry and he doesn’t hesitate to kiss him after a long night. Their sons give various exaggerated groans of disgust, with only Lily aww-ing in approval.
She twists her lips in irritation. He was lying through his teeth and she knew it. The one thing Hermione hated more than not having a variety of books at her disposal was a liar. “Well think about what I said. That potion really could help a lot of people; I hope you had the good sense not to Vanish it before anyone got a sample of it. Every potions’ a good one in someone’s eyes.” He mumbles a half-hearted agreement as she pulls a frazzled Ron away.
you made the mistake that you did without berating you for it, he’s obviously not upset at you anymore for turning him into a girl.”
“How…why…?” His muddled mind struggled to comprehend how on earth his son found out about his sexuality. He wasn’t embarrassed. He pressed a hand to his cold, reddening cheek. Okay, so maybe he was a little embarrassed. “What makes you ask that Scorpius?” His voice is higher pitched and shakier than usual. He picks up his quill and notebook and begins writing down nonsensical predictions in an attempt to give his shaking hands something to do.
“But,” Ginny interrupts pointedly, “we all came to a consensus not to meddle in your relationship with Malfoy. And we
He lets Harry lead them over to the couch, falling down onto the soft plush and sighing. Much better than lying drunk on the kitchen floor.
The Floo whooshes her and Marcéline away when Draco turns to look at Harry’s terror-stricken face. Oh Merlin. “What did she say to you that’s gotten you so frazzled?”
Malfoy still wore some of his male clothes, Harry noticed one evening at the library. While he was still donning a short skirt and his hair was pulled back into a high, feminine ponytail, the rest of his outfit was straight from his old wardrobe. A green and silver tie was tied loosely around his neck, falling into the curve of his unbuttoned cleavage. The crisp, white shirt he wore had the Slytherin crest placed right above his left breast, rising and falling as he breathed. Harry just wished for the life of him that Malfoy would just button up his damn top, because he, like nearly every male in his vicinity, was shifting uncomfortably in their seats. If Malfoy wasn’t so invested in his essay, Harry would have sworn he was doing this on purpose.
“Ron,” Hermione hissed. She at least seemed capable of handling a knife and fork unlike her husband, who hadn’t bothered to unravel his clothed utensils. “Don’t.”
As prideful as Draco was about his and Scorpius’ names, he wonders what sort of English teacher he was to teach constellations. He hadn’t seen that in the lesson plans. “Constellations?” He snorts. “Did you teach constellations to the Aurors in your department too?”
On Thursdays, he sits on an alphabet carpet and lets Potter tell him fabricated stories. On Fridays, he sits in the back of his classroom and tries not to stare too long at his mouth. On Saturdays, he lets Potter touch his hair and hug him, but only because they were such good
“And just because females typically have a lower muscle mass index does not mean they are the weaker sex!” Ron abruptly adds in, looking nervously to Hermione for approval.
Following her instructions, he’s in the 3300’s hallway when he comes upon a sharply dressed woman pointing her finger in the face of two girls amongst a group of sour-faced students.
“I’ll give the ferret a chance,” He narrows his eyes, challenging Draco to blow up over the snip as he slams a stack of Muggle money on the table for the waitress. “But just one. Don’t make me regret it.”
Astoria cocks her head, laughing. Three times now she’s laughed. Maybe she really is getting better. Maybe. “His name is
Ana raises her brows, looking vaguely impressed by his bluntness. “Is that so?” Draco nods without hesitation. “Well, in that case, there is something I think you and Scorpius will benefit from knowing about.”
“What?” Squinting, he looks up and is met with a freckled face framed by thick, fiery locks of hair.
” His wand vibrates, the length of hawthorn he was currently using to hold his low braided bun in place, quivering to be in the palm of his hand.
The silence is stretched on long enough to be considered oddly comfortable when she says, “You know I read somewhere that some species of moths don’t have mouths.”
He smirks into his plate. “Then I can see why your dates don’t work out.” Draco snarls, bloody hell, does he know how to shut up? “At least you got one thing going for you.”
It’s a bit wild to consider that he would be here with Harry Potter, not holding back as he divulges the day he decided to leave Paris and never return.
“Oi, watch yer step blondie!” An old wizard with a hooked nose and startling blue eyes sneers at him, pushing him back forcefully after Draco accidentally bumps into him. He cuts his eyes at him and snarls again. “Bloody bastard.”
Cocky, ironically enough. Draco bites his lip despite his annoyance. He’s always liked a bit of cockiness and it looks particularly good on Harry. Still, at his demand, Harry does things the proper way, taking his time to carefully peel off his fifty galleon trousers and pants instead of Vanishing or ripping them like an uncivilized brute.
He’d never known a simple touch would make such a stark difference. All of Astoria’s touches felt like obligations.
Draco grips Harry’s hand. Suddenly, he knows exactly where they need to be. He was wrong before. Draco knew who he was outside of being a father. All he had to do was show him.
After a few knocks, the door yanks open and Molly Weasley’s eyes fall on him first. She welcomes them at the entrance in a bright, chirpy voice yet Draco feels his whole body instinctively go into fight or flight mode.
He props his head up with one hand. “Hey Mr. Malfoy,” he mutters. Beside him Scorpius sighs, looking as forlorn as his friend. “I guess my Dad told you huh?”
Scorpius trills his tongue. “That sucks because Mr. Potter is really funny when you actually get to know him.”
Ew. He needs to get more adult friends. Together, Blaise and Pansy hardly count as one functioning adult. “You said that you had two tickets, who was the other one for?” It’s none of his business, but Draco reasons that he’s allowed to pry in the business of a man that touches his hair like Potter does.
“What are you doing Potter?” Draco asks in his ear through a clenched-teeth smile, waving nervously to the group of parents clapping politely. His heart is pounding in his ears, so much so, that he hardly hears himself speak. He wonders if his tongue even moved at all.
eccentric. I am completely normal and frankly, rather offended that you would think any differently.”
The next day he waits for Malfoy to come to Potions but he doesn’t show. That was nearly unheard of. Harry didn’t know much about Malfoy’s interests outside of his love for Quidditch and his love for all things with chocolate, but he, like most people, knew that Draco Malfoy positively adored Potions. He wouldn’t skip it unless something was seriously wrong.
for an entire month!” Malfoy exclaims. He sounds very close to being on the verge of panicking. Or tears. Merlin, please let it be tears. Harry snickers and the feral growl he is rewarded with evokes a disturbed hum from Professor McGonagall.
“It’s not that big of a deal,” he mutters into his knees, ignoring Harry’s dark glare. He wants to tell him to bugger off with this stupid conversation so that they can move onto more pressing matters. But, compromises.
Draco tip-toes closer to the cracked bedroom door, highly amused when he’s greeted with Harry’s attempts to serenade the three children sitting together on the bed, each of their faces wearing different levels of amusement and disgust. Lily has taken to hiding her giggles under the comforter with a weird printed humanoid car on it. Muggle movies—he could never understand them.
Potter’s look is smoldering, even in the darkness. “Up Malfoy. Now.” Merlin, now he was using his parenting look on him like he was a child.
“I feel awful. I didn’t realize that about him.” Draco slaps his head with his palm. He really needs to get better at learning about this mental health stuff, or at the very least, learn to be more mindful of others. “Be honest. Am I an arsehole?”
Draco, unwilling to be led around in the dance like all of the other girls where, immediately steps in the position as the lead, forcing him to stumble along as he tries to replicate the dance steps the follower was supposed to do. He snickers when Harry stumbles over himself for what must be the millionth time.
The Asian woman in a wheelchair she’s chattering to nods, her eyes glazed over in utter boredom as the first woman continues to speak to her in that same, squeaky voice of hers. Draco winces. He feels her pain; Jaspers was the same way with him.
He assumed that his best friends engaged in threesomes long ago, so hearing this isn’t too much of a shock, neither is hearing of Pansy’s bisexuality.
The same Al that Scorpius had drawn? What rotten luck he had for that rude, slippery little boy being his son’s new friend. And more than that, he apparently already had an influence on Scorpius.
“Oh Draco.” Harry’s thumb brushes away what must be the tenth tear and he kisses the eleventh away with his lips. “So what I’m hearing is more flowers then?” Draco nods and he kisses his temple with wet lips. “I think I can do that.”
Hermione and Ron give them curious glances, and Harry can see them trying to register the ‘new’ Slytherin girl in their minds. Malfoy visibly bristles, waiting for them to comment on his appearance.
If the children care about their parents' sudden closeness, they don’t say so. Their kissing and Lily’s tattling must have erased any confusion surrounding their relationship. Scorpius especially couldn't care less as he watches the television screen with wide eyes and an opened mouth, looking at Optimus Prime in Lily’s lap and the Optimus Prime on the screen. Albus and Lily excitedly inform him of the dynamics of the television program Harry had put on. Enjoying his son’s wonder, Draco doesn’t notice until it’s too late that his very tightly done braid is a wavy mess around his face.
They stay like this, clinging onto one another when the train choos again and a barrage of young witches and wizards roll past them with their trunks and owls in hand.
“Oh I know you’re serious Potter, that’s the problem.” His smile sours and he sighs in resignation. “But it’s my fault too. I’ve been an arse to him and I don’t really blame anyone for not wanting me, what with this horrid Mark on my arm.” His face crumples again and Harry realizes that maybe this was what Malfoy was so upset over.
His heart falls into his feet and he hides it as best as he can given the circumstances. Of course. Of course he should have expected this, how foolish of him to expect anything other than disappointment with Astoria. She played him with her pretty words and sorrowful apologizes, only for Scorpius to be let down unknowingly again. Both Ginny and Harry give him somber looks and he knows Harry is just itching to apologize for something that is completely out of his control.
He doesn’t know when it started— this perseverance fear of being the only soul in a room. He’s never had an issue before, not when his father left for business for days at a time or his mother was busying hosting parties for Ministry officials. In fact, he actually used to
“No,” a croaky voice answers. More sniffles follow and Harry bravely steps forward to pull down the blanket several inches. Underneath, appears two red-rimmed silver eyes and a few fat tears clinging desperately to the tips of his long lashes. The sun catches the light grey of his eyes and Harry’s breath hitches for a split second.
Harry’s fingers had been buried deep in his hair while his cock had been buried deeper inside him. The loose locks of blond fall down his shoulders and Draco nearly jumps in surprise by the reflection of the man in the mirror.
