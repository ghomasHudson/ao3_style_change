Draco laughs and runs his hand across his face. “I’m trying to make a segue, you know. To tell you I’m ready. I thought if I was poetic about the whole thing It’d make me less scared, but it didn’t. I’m still scared.”
“I was under the well-informed impression that you weren’t Narcissa,” Lucius says. He shakes Snape’s hand off and pulls a matching pajama shirt on. “If I wanted her thoughts on the matter, I would floo her.”
He watches the sunrise with his lover and tries not to think of sunsets.

he doesn’t say. Molly continues, “Now, like I said, lots to do today. I want to check ‘Make Sure Draco’s Okay’ off my list. As I understand it, you had quite a nasty fall. A couple of other nasty surprises too.”
“I’m not comfortable sharing that information with a student.”
A silver doe cuts through the blackness and carries Draco from the depths of his memories back to the compartment. Crabbe’s sitting on the floor. Ginny and Pan are huddled against the window. One of Ginny’s hands is clamped around Pan’s arm.
A man with a lightning bolt scar bisecting his face yawns and stretches in the center of the circle, one hand grasped around the key.

“So what’s the consensus? It’s your birthday, your decision,” Draco says. “That universe, or this one?”
The world comes back to him in gray-tones and white spots. Fragments of emotions — hope, desire, dread, confusion,
Draco angrily swallows the rest of the chocolate bar and stands up. The chocolate’s not strictly necessary, but Lupin keeps it on hand and it’s the only thing keeping Draco’s mood from souring completely. A lifeboat in a sea of failure and disappointment.
A white flash of lightning zizzles down the kite string.

Draco stabs his chicken again. “I hate Hogwarts.”
“Yes, well, there are people in the world other than you, Potter. People with different experiences. You’re not the center of the universe. You heard Ron tell Hermione he loves her. It’s like that. I mean it’s not like
His “predications” are usually just basic observations anyone can make, like when he “knew” Fred was going to be angry George had dissolved the couch.
They’ve done nothing but talk about having a baby for the past year. While technically Draco could have a kid the traditional way, he hadn’t wanted to. (“Dysphoria — Besides, all the other wizarding ways are more fun.”) They had eventually decided on this: an elegant, Swedish solution sold in a flat packed box.
“Today's the first night in a long time I know where all of my children are sleeping. It feels wrong to be so happy in the middle of a war, but I am.”
“I’m, ah, sorry. I didn’t realize the monochromatic thing was important to you. Maybe you should explain it to me?”
“Definitely. I’m sure he hates that I outlived him. Well, sort of outlived him,” Draco waves his hand. “I don’t want to think about whatever happens on the other side right now; I’m in too good of a mood. Dancing! He would’ve hated that I dance.”
“Come on, come on. The wait’s killing me, go ahead, set it off,” Arthur says. His red hair peaks out over the top of the cardboard.
“When you told her you loved her in the middle of a battle?” Draco supplies.
Draco earmarked several moments from the past few days to examine later. Things that didn’t fit with his understanding of the situation at the time. Death Eaters bringing them to Malfoy Manor instead of calling Voldemort directly. Crabbe’s bizarre show of loyalty. Narcissa chasing them through the skies of Malfoy Manor with no sign of the Voldemort in sight.
He blushes. No need to make this a bigger deal than it is. “It’s just an exploding charm.”
“I’m sorry.”
Potter has a habit of showing up in Draco’s life at the absolute worst possible moments, except for that one time when he pulled Draco from the Fiendfyre or that other time when he arrived late to Luna’s karaoke birthday party and Draco was already unbutton-all-of-the-buttons-on-his-shirt drunk and they dueted
“You can’t love me. I don’t have a heart. I just have a lot of wet paper where a heart should be,” Draco says 6 minutes into their parent-teacher conference, in response to what the principal of the school Harry teaches Wizarding Kindergarten at would consider “unprofessional communication with the father of a student.” Harry considers it telling the bloke he’s been seeing for four months
Draco laughs in surprise. “How come this hasn’t come up during one of your ridiculous guilt fests?”
The doorbell rings, and Draco chuckles, a raspy eh-eh-eh, his best impression of Voldemort giggling. It might be the most absurd noise Harry’s ever heard. Later, he’ll hear it come out of a dream-hazy Voldemort’s mouth in place of Kill the Spare and wake laughing, safe in Draco’s arms.

noise sustained under his breath, then explodes. “Fine! You’re letting a child dictate the agenda, but fine! Snape brought this to our attention months ago, said Narcissa had been laying groundwork for an uprising. I said ok, let her uprise. If the Death Eaters aren’t all on the same page, that’s good for us. Told him to encourage things as much as possible. Course he wouldn’t do that. He’s got a blind spot the same way you do, kid. Thinks she’s somehow Worse News. But I know better. She’s mortal, at least, and I’m not so sure we can say the same of Voldemort. I’ve never met anyone else who could wield the kind of power he can; Albus’s the only one who even came close. I made decisions. I found a way to help Narcissa because she is all those things you said, kid, and I think she might be the only one who actually has a shot of taking him out. I left a bunch of those little explosion devices you’ve been making for us at a location Parkinson told us they were planning on raiding. Gave her a little firepower for when she’s ready to take him on.”
The moment Ron shows him the press release announcing the “Battle of Hogwarts 10th Anniversary Collector’s Edition” doll set is the moment Harry realizes he probably shouldn’t go home today.
The lights go off.
Pan continues. “By mass the universe is mostly celestial bodies. So Astrology is studying the way the factors that affect your magic affect you. Paying attention.”

Moody grumbles for a second, a low
“I’m in the middle of something.”
Harry does. He feels warm. He feels good. He feels as though he’ll wait forever for this dumb-ass intellectual to figure out the pseudoscientific heart-opening feeling is love.
Unlike Draco, Harry’s always been a romantic; he knows these kinds of confessions are best done in pairs. He’s never been good at this kind of thing, but for Draco, he’ll try. “When I killed him, I saw your face.”
“To check on Draco,” another says. “He’s not good with storms.”
Malfoy’s not impressed. “Has anything about me ever given you any indication that I want flowers?”
“I’m not going to abandon them.”
“Supposedly,” Pan says.

Ollivander extended the wooden wand from its metal body and is now turning it over and over in his hand.
Draco’s breath catches in his throat, stopped-up by memories of a half-naked boy kissing his mouth, his neck, his chest, his stomach, his wrist, between his legs —

“Don’t be stupid; we’re together in every universe.” But Draco considers. “Though I suppose it’s a good idea to view the universe first before we commit. I read something about a pensive at Borgin and Burkes?”
Harry points to a lilac. “This one’s because I was thinking about how uninterested you look whenever you watch me play. This one —” A carnation. “Is because I was thinking of when I saw your ass in the showers. This one’s because I was thinking of all the things we could do tonight, how I want to touch the muscles in your back and see how your hips feel against my—”
Rarely do the problems he complains to Hermione about have such sexy solutions.
Potter punches him in the nose.
“I’m not sleeping with Malfoy.”
Draco finishes in his head. He closes his eyes and tries to bury the guilt and sadness and nausea with all the other feelings he doesn’t have time for.
Draco’s eyes keep finding Harry’s. Sometimes he’s close by, sometimes he’s at the other end of the party, but every time Draco looks for Harry, Harry’s there, looking back.
“Oh good, you’re all here,” Granger says. Thank god. Draco didn’t want to listen to Harry stumble to define their … whatever it is they’re doing. Calling each other by their first names.

“Right. Yes. But.” Granger says into Ron’s chest. He releases her so that she can talk freely, but keeps ahold of her wrist, his thumb gently stroking her palm. Her free hand nervously tugs the draw string of her hoodie until the aglet catches the hole at the top and the cord stops being tug-able, hangs loose and lopsided around her neck. Then, with an intensity that matches her boyfriend’s, she looks straight at Ron. “I want to rescue Fred and George, but we still have to deal with the horcruxes. I don’t know what might happen if they’re in the same place for much longer.”
Lightning again. This time, Draco catches a glimpse of his father, sitting shirtless on the edge of the bed, his long blonde hair pulled back into a ponytail.
Lupin runs one hand through his hair — something he’s done a lot during their lesson — and says, “I think we’ve reached the point of diminishing returns, Draco.”
Grimmauld Place was clearly decorated by someone with a lot of money and no taste. The house is full of furniture that looks expensive — that definitely was expensive — and doesn’t match the wallpaper, or the drapes, or the other furniture. The dining room the Order meets in has a huge mahogany table in the center, brown drapes embroidered with interlocking gold flowers, and several large paintings of ducks that squawk at you if they catch you staring.
Draco talks through the magical kitchenware aisle, the aisle with different types of teeth (“They’re replacements for IKEA’s line of offensive furniture,” says Draco.
Draco reaches out, grabs Potter’s shirt and pulls him closer. Breathes in the scent of his own body wash and punches Potter in the face. Potter shoves back, but Draco doesn’t let go. Potter shoves harder, hits him again, eventually manages to untangle himself from Draco.
“I know you are.” Harry says and pulls Draco close to him. Draco rests his head against Harry’s chest. “It’s ok. We’ll be together.”
“I can’t change the law, but I do work here. I can streamline the process. We can get married in the morning, file the paperwork after, and pick up the child by tomorrow evening.”
“FLY FORWARD. JUST FLY FORWARD.” Potter brackets Draco with strong arms and pushes ahead. Fire falls from Draco’s wand in thick ropes. His childhood home burns.
A gold ball hits Draco in the head. “Hurry up, lovebirds,” Fred says.
. I know I’m lucky. The Burrow is an excellent place to grow up, and I’m better than every version of me that didn’t grow up here. I’m not wishing that part of my life away. It’s just … by the time I got here, I already had a foundation made for a different life. I had to unmake myself and then remake myself, and the pieces never really added up to a complete person. I wish I was someone who made sense, that’s all. I wish I was one or the other. Either found as a baby in the snow, raised only knowing homemade sweaters and kindness, or never lost, rich and cruel and marked on purpose. It’s an awful wish.

At least Potter, Granger and Ron are here. The entire thing isn’t completely hopeless.
“You shouldn’t have gotten me involved,” Draco says. With the vanishing cabinet in sixth year, but also now. Pan shouldn’t have reminded him — or Harry, currently standing near the trash can and trying to disappear into Molly’s red toile wallpaper — exactly how thin the veil separating Draco’s life from its shadow is. His past is always right there, lurking just outside of his vision. Reaching out to him with oily hands. Standing in his kitchen.
“It was me. I did it,” Harry says.
Behind him, there’s a hissing and a crash.
“What about me?”
timing. When Draco’s in charge of the department, he’ll cut all sorts of corners for Potter just to show him he can. Also, he’ll color-code the filing system and send lots of howlers that preach angry sermons about nontraditional family units. But Draco’s only a secretary at the moment, only here because Theo Nott hates owing Draco a life debt more than he hates Draco. Which means, realistically, there’s not much Draco can do other than his bullshit job.
“Hey!” Draco says. “Come on, Potter. None of that.”

Then there’s a large hand on his shoulder.
“You’re unnaturally warm.” Draco points his wand at Harry.
“What the fuck Potter — you left her alone? Right after she learned to stand?” Draco says, bounding out of the room at the top of the stairs and making a beeline for the kitchen. They hear the crash on the way there.
“Fine! Don’t tell me anything! I’ll put my fingers in my ears and close my eyes and you can fix my wand without giving away your stockpiled secrets.
kiss the boy who showed up at his apartment with a handwritten apology and somehow talked himself into staying for an entire year.
Draco’s 18 and marked. Practically Moody’s worst nightmare. If Molly Weasley were any less of a force of nature, he wouldn’t be here at all.
“You could’ve tortured our actual contact, or maybe someone in the Slytherin dorms overheard Ginny. There are ways. I don’t trust you.”
Draco kisses him deeply, hungry, one last kiss to stave off the not-knowing. His hands wrap around Potter’s naked back. The muscles there relax at his touch. Potter moans again, this time straight into Draco’s mouth. He leans his neck to the left, a clear invitation. Draco kisses him there, and kisses him there, and kisses him there.
“Yes, really,” Ginny says, her attention still focused on Draco. “It really is good. Be happy for me.”
Draco grins, the smile uncurling slow across his face, and jumps down off the truck. His hair’s long now, and falls in blonde waves over his ears. He’s been working out too — picking apples, or whatever one does on a farm. He Did Not Look Like This last time Harry saw him, defined in places he hadn’t been previously, defined in places Harry didn’t know people could

Ginny explodes. “They’re not spying! They’re not! I mean they are, but not like that. Oh my god, look, we’re dating. Me and Pan. Dating. We’ve been dating for almost 7 months now, and I’m happy and I trust them, and if you would just get your head out of your ass and
His body twists toward safety, and Draco’s does too, until he’s abruptly yanked backwards by a grounding spell and a hand bunching into the end of his pants leg.
“So … Did you get the floo to work?” Granger says, and the rest of the people in the main atrium come suddenly into focus. Ron, he realizes, is sniffling.
The end of the key lights up. Almost like magic.
“YES”
He doesn’t trust any of his memories of the manor. His childhood home can’t be as magnificent as he recalls. He’s projecting opulence backwards. He’s remembering it as more than it was because he got used to having less.

“I’m here on important Unspeakable business. Business I’m not allowed to speak of.”
Moody’s eyes flick to Draco as Lupin starts talking about werewolf pack movements. He’s been watching Draco all evening. Ginny likes to remind Draco his hatred for Moody is unfounded, based on a version of the old wizard that was actually just several vials of polyjuice in a trench coat. But the real Moody is just as paranoid and unsettling as the fake one had been. He listens to each report with his head attentively cocked to one side, occasionally yelling things like, “Evil is everywhere! Check your homes!” and “Good people don’t eat that many salty snacks!”
“You’re sleeping with Malfoy.”

Draco is the only one who understands. The others have caught glimpses of Narcissa’s power, but Draco’s seen it full-on.
They asked for Draco’s help. They had a plan — there was a cabinet. Could Draco fix it so Pan and Paxton could escape?
“I want to adopt a child. Today, if possible.”
Draco turns around.
But finally, he makes it to the safety of his bed. Shocked, exhausted, angry, but at least, all of those things in the comfort of his own bed.
“This is not what we talked about,” Ginny says at the same time Draco says, “Out.”

“This had better not be a joke.”
“Ron.”
At least they don’t need to worry about being overheard.
The words hang in that space between them where hatred and love have both taken up residence before. Draco doesn’t know which end of the spectrum Harry’s response is going to fall closer to: if he thinks Draco deserves this, or if he thinks this is a tragedy of the highest order and is going to spend the rest of the day crying in the bathroom with Draco.
“The Death Eaters think they know how to make magic bombs … yeah. They’re definitely, errr, taken and it’s definitely not a joke.”
Draco fights a smile. He is Very Mad at Pan and Definitely Does Not find their response to Granger’s rather flippant remark funny.
They’re a mess, every single one of them, and somehow they’re supposed to fight a war? Hopefully Voldemort never realizes the light side’s achilles’ heel is interpersonal relationships.
“I grew in a highly rigid society that forced me to stay in the closet until I was 18.”
“You were supposed to help me! You were supposed to find me in the forbidden forest!”
The most remarkable thing about Harry Potter is that he’s very good at bar trivia, the result of growing up around adults obsessed with art [his mom], sports [his dad], literature [his Uncle Remus] and bars [his Uncle Sirius]. Also, he won the quidditch house cup a record five times, is currently being scouted by Puddlemere United and has absolutely perfect skin. Seriously: no blemishes, pimples or scars. But he’s proudest of the bar trivia.
Draco steps forward and brushes the pads of his pointer and ring finger against Potter’s lips, works them into his mouth. Trails them down Potter’s chest, his waist, circles his belly button, trails them lower, over the outline of his cock.
Ollivander seems to understand. “Not only us. The wizarding porn industry too. Haven’t you ever wondered why the ministry’s never been able to completely get rid of them, despite their constant best effort? Pornographers don’t want this to get out either; it’d paint a huge target on their back. Between us and them, we have a lot invested in keeping this a secret.

“Hi. It’s, ah, me. Is it ok if I come in?”
Ron drops Granger’s hand, folds his hands across one another again. “I know this is hard, but we have to be logical. Immortal Voldemort is a bad thing, we all agree immortal Voldemort’s a bad thing. That’s why you agreed to help us, right? Cause it’s a bad thing. I want the twins back just as much as you do but Hermione’s right, we can’t give up the only advantage we have. It might be something to consider in the future, but there are other options for us to explore first.”

He nods, even though he doesn’t. What is he anyways? His face must betray his question, because his mother raises her wand and suddenly Draco can’t recall what they were talking about.
Sometimes, Harry will lie on Draco’s chest and trace the curve of his dark mark, “Do you think it was all worth it? We wouldn’t be together without the war.”
“What.”
Harry’s yelling by the end. Draco turns over, remembering a similar wild fury proceeding angry red marks, and tugs on the back of Harry’s plaid shirt.
He gazes at Potter, tries to figure out exactly what the emotion is. He can’t quite place it, but he can’t look away either; if he stops staring into Potter’s eyes he might start staring somewhere a little lower on his brown face, somewhere pink and chapped and far, far more inappropriate.
“Draco!” Someone calls after him, but he doesn’t turn back.
It’s a lie. Harry has asked Draco this question dozens of times, and Draco always lies. But it’s ok; there will be other nights when Draco will lie on Harry, graze his fingertips across the zigzag on his forehead and ask the same question, and Harry will lie too.
He bangs his fist on the table, but Draco doesn’t want to move on. No matter could be quite as important as this one. “What do you mean

That’s enough context. Harry pushes their mouths together, works his tongue into Draco’s smile. His body starts to change in response, expand, grow taller and wider. Harry uses his new mass to press Draco against the wall.

“I didn’t want to look then. It seemed private.”
“Oh, yes, you look more handsome. All orphans are handsome didn’t you know?” Harry says. “It’s my honor to welcome you to our elite and exclusive club.”

“How’s your summer been?” Pan asks. Draco opens his mouth to answer, but Ginny cuts him off. “We’ve been playing a lot of quidditch, pulling a lot of pranks. Together. Just the two of us.
“I think my Dark Mark told Voldemort we have the horcruxes.”

It’s Draco, with a scar cross-cutting his face, skittish and fear-hardened, an orphan with an inherent distrust of stability. Snape smuggled him out of the Manor as a baby and entrusted him to Andromeda, who raised him on the run from Death Eaters. He didn’t go to Hogwarts. Draco and Harry had never even
Harry almost pipes up that he wins most weeks, thank you very much, but Draco speaks before he has a chance.
It’s magic that feels like magic; magic that abolishes their physical location and replaces it with a cocoon of black-navy-blue-purple, a darkness punctured by so many stars it’s almost too bright. A mind-boggling complicated charm.
“You’re watching Teddy.”
“How was work?”
“Shouldn’t she just know? I just knew. I’ve known for so long.”
“Everything’s fine,” Draco says. He’s different suddenly, straight-backed and eyes turned down, apparently cowed by an adult who used to let Harry color in his tattoos with muggle markers.

“Hey!” Ginny says. “I was looking out that window.”
Two lanterns flicker on. Draco can see now that Snape is the other person lying in the bed. One of his hand clutches the comforter to his chest, the other reaches for Lucius, who is pulling silk pajama bottoms over silk boxers.
Her eyes flutter open and closed, open and closed, and then stay closed.
“As if you have any room to talk,” Granger says. Ron snorts.
Granger, Ron and Potter are desperately trying to subdue Bellatrix’s wild spell fire. The flames bite at each spritz of water they send at it, roar back and get larger and more uncontrollable. A lost cause. The fire’s spread throughout the apartment already. It’s burning; it’s already gone. He can hear the muggle sirens on the street; the firefighters rushing up the steps to the only other occupied unit in the building.

His room used to be covered in half-finished blueprints and scribbles of ideas, most of which he finished and took down or that migrated to his workspace at Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes. Now, there’s mostly just sticky patches of air where sticking charms once were and a few pictures. Above his head there’s a candid photo of him and the Weasleys Ginny was not supposed to take and is decidedly not allowed to know Draco has.

Potter’s focus is hot against his skin. Draco closes his eyes. Still: he can feel Potter looking at him, making Draco aware of his whole self — his face, his neck, his arms, his chest, lower. Every part of him is conscious of every part of Potter. Even with his eyes closed, his body knows the exact distance between them.

“We’re in the middle of something,” Granger says. “Whatever you have to say can wait.”
“I was homeless for three days because my Aunt and Uncle forgot to tell me they were going on vacation and locked me out of the house. I never went to Pre-K either, because they forgot to sign me up for it and it wasn’t until a social working came knocking on our door asking after me that they even enrolled me in primary school. A lot of times they didn’t even mean to hurt me, they just didn’t care enough to remember to feed me, or cloth me, or take me to school. There are so many ways you can hurt someone. You know some of them, but I know some too. There are so many ways we can hurt each other; I don’t know how anybody thinks about anything else!”

Draco hates that he has to know, but he has to know.

Potter’s mouth slacks with surprise before he registers what’s happening, and he’s kissing Draco back, one hand coming up to tangle into blonde hair and pull them closer together. A moment of blissful static that expands outwards and consumes all but one of Draco’s thoughts. The last one, a prayer to Potter:
“Of course you don’t. The class is at Midnight. No one pays attention. We have so many spells that mimic the night sky! There’s no reason not to teach it during the day! I hate Hogwarts.” Pan crosses their arms and settles against the seat’s red cushioning. “It’s like this. Magic is affected by all sorts of factors, right? I can’t cast a
“Some of these are only like ten years old,” Potter says. “Did your father play?”
“That’s right. You and the Weasleys are close.”
“Fuck,” Potter says. “Give me a second. How about … you take off your pants and get in the car until I’m ready?”
“You don’t want to hear me wax poetic about my wound?
This time, at least, he’s not alone.
There’s a neon sign glowing
“What are you doing here, Weasley?”
“I want you too,” Potter says.
Draco rolls his eyes, but complies. Sticks a finger in each ear and stares at the ceiling until he hears the heavy thud of a door opening and closing. He looks up, startled.
“Accio the bag, Potter.”
“Don’t look so —” He gestures to Potter. “I want you. You didn’t misunderstand things so don’t lose your head over it. It’s just— it’s just— it’s just—”
“Ginny cursed me several times when the Order first assigned her to be my contact,” Pan says. “Punched a hole in the wall of a hotel room we met up in too.”
“THE FUCK, POTTER, YOU WANT TO DO THIS NOW?”
The monkey bangs its cymbals together.
Ginny laughs. “No they didn’t. They couldn’t have. You know Fred and George; this is some sort of sick joke because they want to see what we would do, or it’s Purple Dog Day all over again and this is all Wheezes publicity. Why would anyone take the twins? Being alone with both of them is awful and I ostensibly

Molly’s eyes crinkle, and Harry leaves with a resolution and a recipe.
No Fred. No George. No Potter, Granger or Ron either. No evidence anyone’s even been here recently. Just Draco and the other prisoners, their footsteps echoing through abundance.

“Where are you? What’s the emergency? Three minutes, Draco, let’s speed this up.”
“HELL YEAH!” Ginny says, and she’s gone too.
He doesn’t know what Draco gets up to during the day, only that he expects to come home to sarcasm and derision and instead comes home to a soft look and an almost-fond
“I do though. All of that’s bullshit, but even if it weren’t, even if you are filled with wet paper, that’d be ok.” Harry gestures to his arts-and-crafts corner; the DIY globe and work-in-progress unicorn head. “I like papier-mâché.”
He still doesn’t like Ron’s face. “I’m not keyed into the wards anymore. I’m legally disowned. Stop looking at me.”
The dance floor of a club called The Multiverse is not the best place to confront Draco about his dark mark, but Harry’s drunk.
“You’re going to have to if you want to get Fred and George back!”
“I want you,” Potter says again.
“Errrr. That’s, well, that’s not, I don’t know, inaccurate. I mean I wouldn’t say it like that. I mean, I mean—” Beside them, Harry scowls at Draco. “10 minutes? No way.”
He hates copying Potter, but he hates Dementors more.
More thunder, another bolt of lighting. The storm builds. Over its noise, Snape says, “If you don’t think Narcissa won’t sell you to the devil to save her soul, you don’t know Narcissa.”
Had she not seen Draco rant his way to multiple epiphanies, she would tell him to get the fuck out of her room. But she was there when he figured out the sorcerer’s stone drained all the magic from the world, and she was there when he discovered that electrical currents have the same atomic structure as magic, so — “What’s a key, Draco? What are you talking about?”
“Take a party hat,” George says as he walks by Harry and Draco.
“But there will be wine.”
A pause. “I’m so worried. Aren’t you worried? I’m so worried. There are a million ways to fuck up a kid. So many ways. A million. I’m not positive we’ll even be able to put her together right, and what if we do, and then she's alive, and she has a soul and we have to

and then Harry had rolled over and said, “I want to suck you off,” and Draco had stopped thinking all together.
“Sleeping with me doesn’t make you an expert on my life.”
Ten days after they break up, Draco owls him about his snake.
“Do you think I look different now that I’m an orphan?” Draco asks after Lucius’ funeral.

“I’m supporting a friend. I know how you get at funerals.”
Harry steps forward, intent on finally getting the language right. He kisses Draco square on the mouth, through his little squawk of surprise into certainty.

He’s never going to have sex again. It makes him forget how much of a fuckup he is, and he’s an extremely large fuckup that doesn’t deserve a single moment of relief. He deserves to stew in memories of his fuck ups for the rest of his life.

Who asked Harry out because, “You’re annoying but a good fucking flyer.” An orchid.

It seems cruel to dangle such little information in front of them. To give them bad news and then disappear the same way Ron, Potter and Granger had done several months prior. Molly and Arthur had been out of their minds with worry then, and that was when only one of their children was unaccounted for. Now, it’s half their family, gone.
He presses a sliver of paper into Harry’s hand. It’s a receipt from the last time they saw one another. Six butterbeers, one order of fish & chips. They had gotten drunk enough that they hadn’t noticed when the polyjuice wore off, and when they had, they stayed anyways, together, as themselves, in a back booth at The Three Broomsticks. “It was proof you didn’t mind being seen with me in public. That you might even be willing to be seen with me in public again, if I kept going, if I kept working toward making a world where that was possible.”

All of the years come at once. 29; 39; 49. His back hurts; his legs ache; he feels comfortable in his body in a way his youth never allowed. 59; 69; 79, on. Two old men, falling into inevitability. Reaching together for what’s next.
“Mr Malfoy,” Snape says. He’s scribbling something on a piece of paper when Draco enters the potions room for detention. Draco stands in front of his desk, arms crossed, foot tapping. Snape doesn’t look at him.
Malfoy’s on him, mouth wet, hands everywhere, pulling him into his room, closing the door.
“Out,” Draco says, and the girl scurries out the door.
“Maybe not to you, but some of us grew up learning to read people like our life depended on it, and now it does so you can trust we know what’s going on.” Pan crosses their arms. “She’s just waiting for the right moment. I think if you hadn’t gotten away, Potter, she would have done it right there at the manor. She would’ve had something the Dark Lord really, really wants. That’s really the only thing standing between her and just going for it.”
“Me too,” Draco says, even though he doesn’t know what it is Harry wishes for. It doesn’t matter. If Harry wants it, he’ll get it for him. He’ll do anything, everything for this boy.
Potter moans, mouth closed, the noise somewhere deep inside his throat. Draco’ll do anything to make Potter make that noise again. Anything.

Draco is too, even though he knows it’s not his fault. Patients die. People die; it’s what they do.
Desire’s dangerous. Powerful, like Ollivander said. Wanting to be someone new, wanting the world to be new — sometimes that’s the only thing that gives you the courage to scorched-earth your past.

There’s a half-formed insult about the sound of Granger’s voice on the tip of his tongue, but he doesn’t have the energy to work out the words.
“It’s 9 p.m. Barely even my birthday anymore.”
Draco will not allow himself to consider the possibility, will not allow himself to remember the taste of Potter’s mouth. If he does, he might do something unforgivable, like reach out and touch the ridiculous bastard. Wanting like that is … Reckless. Brash. Ill-advised.

Potter got a firebolt for Christmas. As a result, Marcus Flint makes the Slytherin quidditch team train twice as hard. Not that Draco wants to loose to Gryffindor — he and Ginny are both chasers for Slytherin, and Fred and George are the Gryffindor Beaters. In many ways, the house cup feels like a continuation of their rivalry — but practicing until midnight four days a week doesn’t exactly put him in the best mood.
“No,” Draco says, and leaves it at that. He doesn’t want to think about how one of his best friends tried to trick him into fixing the vanishing cabinet in the Come-and-Go Room so they could smuggle Death Eaters into Hogwarts today.
Lupin leans more fully against the doorframe. He seems barely able to support his own weight. “Harry had a bad encounter with the Dementors on the train. I’m merely helping him learn how to handle it better should it happen again.”

“I think that Fred and George are smart enough to fake it for at least as long as it will take us to come up with a real actual plan to get them back.”
“Spicy tomato rice. It’s vegetarian. I’m vegetarian,” Potter levels Draco with his gaze. “I was, ah, making some for you too. Ron and Hermione went out for dinner.”
Draco grabs his green tote bag and marches out of the office. Harry stares at gray walls and tries not to think about eyes the same color.
“What? I’m happy for you, let’s celebrate with music and a cheese platter, but you can’t expect me to be surprised.
Draco remembers that night. Ollivander’s body screwed into unnatural shapes, the first time he’d ever seen his mother torture someone. The sudden, upsetting revelation that she might not be as justified in her actions as she always claimed to be. Of course he had laughed. In the same week his father had died, his life had been uprooted and he had been forced to realize his mother was cruel. His life felt unreal in the way jokes feel unreal.
Harry’s been waiting to get his flying motorcycle license renewed for … well, long enough that striking up a conversation with Draco Malfoy seems like a good idea.

Well. Everything except one thing.
Draco’s a house with gasoline-filled pipes and Bellatrix lit a fuse. His blood is on fire, and everything else is on fire too.
His mother slaps him on the wrist. “You must never do that again.”
Potter makes a noise that’s almost a laugh. When he looks at Draco, the guilt’s still there, and the sadness, but there’s other things too: curiosity, relief, something Draco can’t quite identify.
“They’re not too bad, usually. It’s just lonely sometimes.”
What the hell is Draco supposed to say to that? How is he supposed to tell Harry that the entire incident is the canary in the coal mine, sorta, an indicator of how Draco cares for people incorrectly, cares for them to the point of capture?

Draco babbles when he’s nervous, and Harry’s unwittingly given him a pandora’s box of a rant topic. An IKEA box, maybe — the rant has more parts than Harry expects it to.
“Good morning,” Harry says when he pads barefoot into the kitchen in only his auror robes and a pair of pants, a button-down shirt leisurely thrown over his shoulder.
It’s the fact Harry remembered the flowers Draco likes. That he cared enough to tell Ron.
“A ge

Actually, it’s because his memory isn’t big enough to hold the main atrium. It’s huge. Taller than he remembers, with more rooms branching off from it and an entire extra fountain he completely forgot about — two intertwining dragons, water coming out of each of their mouths.
“You can’t possibly mean —” Draco starts. “
Draco screws his eyes tighter and hopes for a deeper darkness than the one he’s currently suspended in. He wants to pull his entire consciousness through the white spots behind his eyelids so he can enjoy this moment without its double: the rush of thoughts about how if he lets Potter any closer he’ll see Draco. He’ll realize how gross Draco is, how raw. Draco’s unfit, impure, damaged, fake, perverse. The only thing he’s good at is coming up with synonyms for

“Have you ever been homeless?” Harry says, suddenly sharp. Draco wants to turn over and look at him. He suspects he’ll see that spark he enjoys so much, the heartbeat of their antagonism. But moving feels a lot like showing Harry he cares, which feels a lot like losing this particular argument.
“SURPRISE!” Half the people yell. Someone blows a streamer.
The Ford bumps up and down. Stills.
“Well. Ok. Ok. Ok. Ok.”
They’re in the trio’s home base, a small, cozy tent upholstered in summer colors with a bathroom, joint kitchen/living room and two bedrooms. The same tent Arthur spent almost two hours trying to put up sans magic at the Quidditch World Cup several years ago; Draco recognizes the floral carpeting. It’s considerably more spacious when only shared by four people and not the seven Weasley children, Arthur, Potter, Granger and Draco.
“It’s a matter of odds. Narcissa’s smart, but she doesn’t have the power Voldemort does. We’ve got better odds of taking her out then we do him. Why else would we have encouraged her coup? Next matter!”

Draco curls into him. “I want to roast your family alive.”
“I know you do,” Harry leans toward Draco, wet heat against wet heat; a fire that burns forever, greeting itself.
The nonfunctional Swiss Army Wand in Draco’s shoe is heavy in the best way; a weight that pulls him up and not down. He feels drunk on the first glimpses of a plan.

“I don’t need to explain battle strategy to a child.”
Draco tries to remember what he knows about the manor’s lockdown procedure, if he ever learned the spell to end it. His mind comes up blank, save for memories of his father showing him the wards, telling him about all the people who died to keep them safe.
Harry’s dream included the phrase
“It’s awful.” He’s never seen himself smile like this before — he’s never seen himself before, really. Teenage rebellion is tacky and campy and fool-hearted and harrowing and traumatic and fucking funny. Draco’s always been all of those things. How nice, to finally look the way he feels.
“Drop the knife, Malfoy!”
Draco spends most of winter break intent on proving Lupin wrong. So what if he can’t quite cast a patronus the traditional way? That’s never stopped him before.
And Luna’s head is rolling to the side dangerously, and Dean’s not paying attention to his broom because he’s too worried about her, unconscious on the back of it —

But Draco only barely notices. Draco is already out the door, putting as much distance as possible between himself and the worst piece of news he’s ever received.
“You like to pretend the war happens to other people, but you’re branded with his symbol too.”
Abruptly, her face disappears from his computer screen. The distance between them reasserts control.
It’s true. Ginny takes advantage of Crabbe’s massive crush on her frequently. Also Crabbe hadn’t seen especially keen on becoming a Death Eater to begin with. It’s … not a bad plan.
His voice cracks on the word
“I don’t like your house very much, Draco” Luna says. She’s leaning against the wall across from him, her head on Dean Thomas’s shoulder. Dean glares at Draco, mutters, “
Every part of Draco is filled with a simple, all-consuming ache for this man.
He looks at Ollivander, barely conscious now; and Luna, whose eyes are glossy and unfocused. Dean’s trying to pretend he’s not nursing a broken ankle. The three of them aren’t in good shape. He doubts they’d be able to make it through a longer rescue mission.
He sees his mother first, older than she’s ever been, sitting beside him and Sirius —
“Death Eaters took the twins.” Again, Draco is reluctantly impressed by Ron’s ability to verbalize things Draco himself can only barely grasp.
Draco leans on their intertwined hands, bridges the gap between them and silences the other boy with his mouth.
Draco has spent the majority of the last eight hours — it’s 9 a.m. now; he vetoed sleep — hooking his computer up to the floo network. The connection is spotty, a protean charm hooked to free video chatting software hooked to a sonorous charm cast on a nearby café’s free wifi, but it works. He can see the outline of Ginny’s face in the virtual flames; recognizable, if blurry.

Harry’s brain rolls through a rolodex of facts he’s learned in the past 5 minutes, trying to figure out the best place to start working through his confusion. “Is it a different cat or part of the original cat. Should I give it a different name? Since when do you like animals? Buckbeak hated you.”
“As though you could mastermind a plan like that all by yourself. It was my idea; therefore, I’m responsible.”
(inspired specifically by the lyric, "it's like we're sitting on dynamite / But we're not ready to start a fight)
“This is Luna’s cat?”
“AVADA KEDAVRA,” she yells, one spell in a latticework sky. Draco zig-zags through red; orange; yellow; green, meant to kill him.
He's only doing this because he hates Draco. He wants Draco to feel small and powerless.
“You want to win don’t you? I have it on good authority the bonus round tonight is going to be on muggle composers, and Draco’s been taking piano lessons since he was five.”
“You don’t have to say it like that,” Ron mumbles.
Draco twists around to catch Potter’s lip with his own. He pushes Potter back against the Ford, which
In theory, yes. He’s keyed into the wards; as long as they all join hands, the four of them can leave. But that means — leaving behind those he came here to rescue, giving up his only chance of getting the twins out. Narcissa will change the wards as soon as she realizes he'd escaped. If he leaves, he can’t come back.
“Are you ok? Did it work?” Draco’s concern is dwarfed by his curiosity. Harry cares more for this excitable brainiac than anyone else in this world, but how is he supposed to live in a universe where his sister doesn’t even exist? The price of the love he wants is the love he has. What an awful thing to know.
They don’t understand. He’s alone.
“Unless they didn’t know it was valuable.”
“Ginny!”
“Errrrr—” Ron is shell-shocked. “Errrrr I should— I mean— Errrrr—”
Harry opens his mouth, closes it, finally manages to sputter, “I asked for a
“Partly, it’s like Draco said. It’s from knowing Narcissa. But there are signs. Narcissa — the Blacks in general — are good at making people fall in love with them and then using that love as a means of control. She’s been spending a lot of one-on-one time with each of the Death Eaters. ‘Recalibrating the Dark Mark’s charms,’ or some other such nonsense excuse she makes to be alone with people. They’re all obsessed with her now. And suddenly, people are talking about the Dark Lord’s goals instead of the Dark Lord. Discussing how maybe the Dark Lord isn’t as capable of leading a revolution as previously thought.”
Which is true — Narcissa is almost as paranoid as she is smart — but also he doesn’t care. “You’ve been spying for her this entire time. Feeding her information on Voldemort

“Of course. What sort of dream involves me knitting?”
“I would do everything in my power to save her if you asked me to. If you were bitten by a snake, I would claw out both my eyes so you could make the antidote. If it meant you would sleep better tonight, I would go outside and offer myself up as a sacrifice to the storm. But I can’t leave with you.”
Harry does all the talking for the rest of the trip. They need a new rug, get lost on the way to the home decor section —

“He’s told that joke like six or seven times,” Fred says.
“Just an exploding charm! Just an exploding charm, he says. As though you didn’t successfully make a mechanical toy cast magic. That’s cause for celebration. I’ll let Molly know she needs to make a cake. What do you want? Lemon cake?”
“I knew that. Draco writes me all the time. Isn’t that right, Draco?”
“I’m not my mother.”
Dean seems too invested in the conversation to notice her sudden recovery. “What is it? What are you all talking about?”
“We can’t waste time waiting for the Order. Voldemort’ll kill the twins if we don’t get them out soon.” Ron says. Draco’s almost impressed by his ability to confidently communicate the bleak reality of the situation. Draco definitely couldn’t. He’s to sullen to do anything other than sink further and further into the massive maroon chair he’s sitting in.
He turns toward the empty part of the barn.
“I know you are.”
“I have a source; that’s all I’m going to tell you. I’ll owl you directions on where and how to meet them, but otherwise this is like, Super Top Secret Order Stuff, and I can’t tell you anything more. Especially because … well, it just wouldn’t be good. Also, it’s now been seven minutes and I really really do not want to get caught so Draco, Ron, I love you. Harry and Hermione, it was excellent learning that you’re still alive. Ohhhh I really wish I didn’t have to hang up. Bye.”
Then, Pan has to go and get attacked by a hippogriff. It’s barely even a scratch — Pomfrey rolls her eyes when she sees the small pink line Pan asks her to heal  — but Pan’s father insists on making it a big deal.
She puts her knitting needles on the brown end table and focuses all of her attention on Draco. “How are you?” She asks again.

“You errrr really get going when you get going,” Ron says. He’s flanked by Granger on one side, Ginny and Harry on the other, Pan behind the group. An entire fucking intervention in the middle of the field separating the garden from the barn.
Pan sighs. “I’m not saying we help her. I’m saying we shouldn’t try to stop her. A coup would send the Death Eaters into complete turmoil, and that would be good for our side.” They level Draco with their gaze. “Because I am on your side, whether you want me here or not.”
Draco looks as though he has something he wants to say, but he never speaks. He leans forward and kisses Harry.
“I saved your life, and I’ve been spying for the Order for almost an entire calendar year. I’ve more than earned your forgiveness.

I needed to power a spell. It was utilitarian. There were extenuating circumstances. Like adrenaline. Lots of adrenaline. I thought we were going to die. You know.”
“I know! And Theo's always complaining the house elves don’t give him enough croutons.”
“That’s not fair!” Draco hates himself for being unable to come up with anything better to say.

Harry wants to kiss the blonde bastard, who one time told him he didn’t much care for romance, except — “Draco, I never wrote you a letter.”
Charlie, Ron, Fred and Dean hoist a large bowl of lemonade and a large bowl of punch onto the other end of the table. Fleur’s trying to have a conversation with Percy, who is, predictably, drinking a butterbeer and looking extremely put-upon.
“TOO BAD,” Draco says, and turns back toward Pansy. He sticks his marked arm in the air and waves it around without shame. Though he’s wearing a sheer black shirt embroidered with blue flowers tucked into a belt that’s purely for fashion because his pants are at least a size too small — it’s possible he doesn’t feel shame.
The dark mark looms large over the last time Draco was here, too. Only then, it had been abstract and far-off; an attack on people he didn’t know. Something he cared about intellectually because
“Did he ever manage a patronus? Your friend.”
Ron pulls her into a tight embrace. “Thank you.”
“I am logical. I am being logical,” Draco yells. “I’m the only one without a hard-on for Dumbledore preventing me from seeing that destroying the horcruxes isn’t the end-all be-all he made it out to be!”
“If you’re teaching him, you have to teach me,” Draco says. “I’ll tell Molly if you don’t.”
Snape breaths in sharply. “You would have me loose both you
,” Luna says. Dean blushes.
“Oh, good point, you know I completely forgot we’re in a war,” Draco says with as much sarcasm as he can manage. “Thank you for the reminder. I guess it’s totally fine for you to date a traitor who wants me to help Narcissa take over the world.”
“We never talked about this! We didn’t elect you previsionary leader of the Order to make decisions like this on your own!” Arthur says.
“Hi Ginny,” Granger says. She looks at the large smile on her boyfriend’s face, tender. Draco’s sure he sports the same sappy expression Ron does, but he’s too happy to care.
“That’s where they took Draco when they got him,” Ron says.
. You weren’t even tall enough to reach my knee and already —
Ron gestures broadly and splashes water on the stewardess.
“Can you hand me the wirecutters?”
He points his wand at the ground and mutters the spell. Nothing happens. He tries again, screws his eyes closed and
Which still doesn’t make any sense. Pansy gives an exasperated sigh and clarifies. “Two Gryffindors. Two Ravenclaws. Two Slytherins.”
“I’m fine. It was cancer; it wasn’t as though it was a surprise. He was in a lot of pain. He wanted to go.” Draco sighs. “We used to argue about that all the time. I was smarter than Toby, but he was much better at arguing, so when we really got going, we could go for days. It’s been so quiet now that he’s — wherever he is. I think I’m scared of being alone. I think I’ve had a little too much wine.”
“She’s not worse than Voldemort, you’re just biased,” Pan says. “Don’t give me that look. I know she’s bad, but Voldemort is unhinged. The amount of power he wields terrifies me. He split his soul
“Stop bothering him,” Harry says. Granger narrows her eyes and engages him in one of their silent turf wars. Harry must win, because Granger changes the direction of her questioning.
giving her back.” Draco shrugs. “There are a million ways we can fuck up this kid and all of them are more bearable than the way that couple would.”
Draco’s exhausted when he gets off his shift at St. Mungo’s, but Harry’s not up yet, so he sits in their little kitchen and puts on a pot of tea.
“I can try,” Draco says, heat rising to his cheeks. “Come on, we should check the storefront. It’s not as warded as the workshop.”
Harry picks a bug out of his hair and eats it. A woman in … somewhere else taught him about edible bugs and now he rarely goes into town for food. He’s out of practice talking to people, so he says nothing and hopes Draco will just leave.
and takes a bite. Harry imagines the taste. Swallows.
The hard line of Potter’s mouth softens just a little bit. “Do you have any experience with kids?”
“I can’t. Every time I see you, I want to kiss you, but if I kiss you, then it’ll restart our clocks. It’ll kill us, and I’m more scared of dying than I am of being alone.”
Draco steps closer and takes his hand. Studies it. Turns it over in his own hand, gentle, focused. Harry swallows.
“Just accio the bag!” Draco pushes the sleeve of Potter’s shirt up and brings the knife down on his dark mark. “ACCIO THE FUCKING BAG!”Potter waves his wand and the noise stops. The screaming, silenced; the sack, pulled from his hand. Draco collapses in a chair, throws the knife on the floor.
Draco scoffs. “You haven’t even apologized.”
Draco thinks, but he ignores the thought in favor of one of the millions of questions racing through his brain in the wake of this new information. “Are you saying desire’s a magical fastener?”
Granger reaches the same conclusion. “The horcruxes.”
“When was the last time you saw Molly or Arthur?”
“I’m not going to get you in trouble,” Harry says, and then there’s a calloused hand grabbing his shoulder a little too tightly.
Draco tunes them out, traces the contours of the galaxy still shining on the compartment walls with his eyes. None of this applies to
Draco hates the Hogwarts Express.
“He’s working.”
The pressure inside him compounds, and there’s something in the Hogwarts walls Draco understands until he tries to look at it, and the stress builds, and Potter is so annoying, and there are stretched-out sentences scrapping against his bones. He raises his wand, and the tension mounts, and Draco casts a spell he didn’t know he knew. Out comes a lengthened-crinkle, a crinkled-length.
” Molly says. Moody rolls his eye and slouches. No one can threaten you with your own name quite like Molly Weasley can.
The redhead is braced against a wall. “Do you have any water? I just ran all the way here from —
“You’re a good friend, Ron. You’re a small fire in my heart.”
“Me too,” Potter says. “I mean, I understand.”
You have a cat named Salazar now.
He thinks as Pan’s body goes slack and falls to the floor. Behind them, Dean and Luna beam at one another, unshackled hands interlaced. Ollivander side-eyes them and turns Draco’s functional Frankenstein wand over and over again in his fingers.
Draco shoves the thought away, heads toward the door connecting the workshop to the storefront.
“The twins!” Ron yells back.

“Why do you care?” Draco says. “Why are you even defending them?”
“Draco.” Crabbe pauses for one beat, two. “Aren’t you meant to be in the dungeons?”
instead,” he tells Molly three hours into an intense heart-to-heart, the first stop on his Harry Potter Gets His Shit Together Tour.
None of the windows are broken, but that’s it for good news. There are scorch marks on the walls, the lingering smell of smoke. A thin layer of shimmering pink liquid covers the floor; the love potions, all shattered and pooling together. Fake teeth chatter their way through crumbled boxes. Everything strewn together, smashed, somber.
. He made Potter feel
“Why even take the twins? I mean, me I get, you, I get. But … it’s Fred and George. They’re … Fred and George.”
“We have an actual plan! Ginny, then Crabbe.”
A nearby passenger hands him a water bottle.
Pain shooting from the horcruxes in his hand to the mark to his arm to his brain.
“Too bad.” Draco tries to remember the way Molly’s lemon cake tastes, the feel of his hand closing around the snitch. He’s using a memory from the previous summer, when everyone had been home for his birthday and Bill had arranged a two-on-two quidditch bracket Draco and Ginny had won.
“My imagination sees a whip.”
Fred’s been meaning to fix the shop wards since they opened. Not that the ward quality made a difference in their apartment.
,” Molly says again.
“You’re going to tire yourself out.”
, of course not. A child’s life is at stake.”
“The twins?” Ron asks, all large eyes and hope. Draco shakes his head. Ron lets out a miserable breath.
Other people’s — Potter’s — happiest memory can power spells. Draco’s happiest memory can only create a small silver mist.
the Order and positioning yourself for this exact moment, when you can convince us to stand idly by and let her take control of the Death Eaters, even though that’s possibly the worst thing that could ever happen.”
“Good skincare.” The same answer he gives Hermione. A joke so he doesn’t have to form an opinion on his complete lack of outward signs of aging over the past 5 years.
“That’s massively inappropriate.”
, Ohhhh.” A poppy, at the way Malfoy elongates the syllable. He quirks an eyebrow at the red flower. “You have a lot there, Potter.”
He’s told Pan and Ginny and Harry and Ron and Granger some version of the Greta Catchlove story before, but apparently it didn’t translate well. They still don't understand her power. They hadn’t seen how excited Greta looked when Narcissa asked her to ruin her own life. They’d never felt Narcissa’s tug or had the overwhelming desire to claw out their own eyes so she would spare them a second glance.
“There’s only one Slytherin,” Harry blurts out. Pansy roles their eyes and points a white-tipped finger lazily at the bar.

And inside of him, the part of caring about people that’s awful, the
“DMV’s closed,” Steve says. “Both of you need to leave. Especially you, Parry comma Hotter. You didn’t even have an appointment today.”
Draco keeps his workstation neat. A pile of electronic parts in one corner, magical oddities in the other, room to work in the center. Not that he’s an especially neat person — a good portion of the trash on the floor is his — but his brain thinks spatially and it’s hard to work when he can’t lay things out and move them around.
He mouths
anything — when there could be a Dementor around any corner, ready to surprise him with his own worst memories?
“Ginny!” Ron says, and Draco’s grin grows at the other boy’s surprise and excitement.
Draco snorts and finishes off a second bottle of wine. “I keep on thinking about all the things he hated about me and how I’ve doubled down on them. Like animals, he hated animals and I have a crup, a dog
“Potter comma Harry,” the employee calls again.
“Potter,” he spits when Harry opens his apartment door at 6 a.m. the first Saturday in June wearing a pair of boxers Draco’s pretty sure are his. “Cut my hair.”
, somehow I’m lying.”
“I shall alert the headmaster the Dementors have taken to terrorizing students,” Snape says. He examines the room, his gaze resting on Draco for a half-second longer than any of the others. Then, he swiftly turns on his heels and leaves.
“You were going to make me an accomplice to murder!”
Draco follows the path of Ginny’s gaze to a figure rapidly flying toward them. White hair like his, but longer. Gray eyes like his, but crueler. The thin line of his mouth curving downward into a grimace, more annoyed than angry.
“Holy’s one word for it.” He’s not at all surprised Luna buys into George’s pet theory regarding his own psychic abilities.
“Did Draco tell you our families used to vacation together in Crema?”
“Potter. Can I help you?” Draco snags an apple out of a crate marked
melodramatic,” Luna says and casts the spell to open his restraints. Draco ignores her in favor of picking Pan’s wand off of their unconscious body and spitting on their face.
