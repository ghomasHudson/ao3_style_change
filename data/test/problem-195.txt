July 1999
‘You’re not buying Dad potions supplies for Christmas, are you?’ Teddy whined.
‘Because I… You already know so much about me. You know me better than anyone else alive. He thinks whatever it is that’s causing this, whatever it is that’s stopping me from…healing, it’s routed somewhere in my childhood. If that’s true, then maybe it’s just part of who I am. Then maybe I won’t ever get better. I know I can live without magic. I’m living now. It’s just…I won’t be that person anymore. I won’t be the genius potioneer or that pompous arsehole who thought he’d be the best quidditch player ever.’ Harry laughed and he almost lost his nerve. ‘I don’t want you to know who I am without those things because I’m not sure that the person behind it is a good person.’
A crack of lightening across the sky lit up his cell like a giant lumos. The pages of an old newspaper he’d lain out on the floor looked new again, just for a moment. When the paper had randomly been thrown through the bars of his cell, he hadn’t even bothered to read it. News of the outside world mattered little to him and there was never any good news. Now, for the first time since he’d spread it on the floor as insulation against the dirt and cold, he noticed the date on it.
‘Maybe we can meet to discuss it? I’m open to helping but I am currently employed, and I need to know more before I can commit to anything.’
Teddy ran off to find his shoes – despite having hurried them both downstairs – and Harry caught Draco’s elbow as he went to pick up the bag of gifts for the kids.
‘You’ll be awake properly now, I should think. Oh Draco, we were all so worried. I tried my best not to bring the kids, but it’s been so long I couldn’t face lying to them. You’ve baffled everyone. It took them weeks to figure out what was wrong.’ She held his hand tightly and brushed the hair back from his face.
‘That’s hardly relevant,’ he sniffed.
‘S’ok. Didn’t know you were coming.’ Draco yawned.
Draco balled the note up in a weak fist, mind whirring. He carefully slipped his arm out from underneath Teddy and padded over to the bathroom. In the harsh light he realised Harry had changed him into his favourite pyjamas. His heart twisted nastily but he ignored it. He opened the bathroom cabinet and pulled out the last of his potions, making a mental note to replenish his supply as soon as he could get to the apothecary and buy new ingredients. He’d started brewing his own potions after one time he’d bought pre-made pepper-up and had a bad reaction from the magically modified ingredients.
Trying to avoid Draco panicking behind the wheel of a hulking great piece of metal and fuel, Harry kept his voice light and calm. “In the middle, at the front. It’s the easiest, ok? Just let it out of gear and push it forward and it’ll go right into third.” Draco actually had pretty good lane discipline and was steady enough with the accelerator, but he was having a hard time with the gears and braking.
“Master Malfoy, sir, Tressy is being very sorry, sir.” She stood on trembling knees, wringing her hands like a dishcloth. She’d probably had rather a horrible shock. “They was not giving Tressy their names or telling Tressy their purpose for their visiting, sir. Tressy-” Draco held up a silencing hand.
Harry was asleep on a terribly uncomfortable looking hospital chair. His messy head of hair was resting against Draco’s side, which gave Draco a perfect view of the steady rise and fall of his breathing.
‘No, no you won’t. If this ever goes anywhere it’ll be seen as an admission of guilt. No, I have a way to solve this, if you’re willing to wait just a little while longer.'
Despite feigning offense at Draco’s greeting, Pansy made no effort to answer her own questions, and when they sat down at the breakfast table, he saw she was not as well turned out as he thought. The harsh morning light highlighted the dark circles under her eyes that she’d valiantly tried to layer over with make-up. He didn’t know what he should say to her.
Aspen would randomly start pacing around a room, screaming at walls and doors like he was crying; he’d start shaking and biting anyone who came too close. At first, it only happened while at Luna’s and Harry presumed that he didn’t like being moved about, but then it started happening at home too.
‘I know what’s causing the magic core issues.’ He said with urgency. He searched Harry’s eyes, begging he would understand this was important enough to disrupt his meeting and important enough to not fight Draco on this one.
All in all, it took him two hours to get all of his information out onto the board and in the end it helped him understand his own mind better than he expected it to. He probably looked like a lunatic. He probably was a lunatic; running around his office amongst piles of photographs and scraps of paper. It was an organized mess that somehow represented the inner workings of Draco’s mind and he pieced it all together, bit by bit, until the end result was something that was vaguely understandable to someone living outside Draco’s head.
“What?”
” His breath was ragged after his tirade, and Pansy sat staring at him with her mouth hanging open. It was perhaps an overreaction, but he had put far too much into this plan to throw it all away now, not just for himself but for Granger and Potter too.
‘He didn’t though, and that’s what matters. And we have to do everything we can to make sure he knows how much we love him. Can you do that for me? I think it’s very important.’ Draco’s chest felt heavy with emotion. He felt so much these days, far more than the rage he felt before. He supposed it was the effect of being unable to take his anxiety potions – he wasn’t used to feeling so much all the time.
‘D’accord! My apologies ‘Arry.’
‘You’re a really great guy Draco. I’m sorry things turned out the way they did.’ Draco stood and pulled her into a hug, he even refrained from making a comment on how her bushy brown hair was getting in his eyes and mouth.
‘And she was at the house on a Saturday when I came to pick up Teddy-’
Despite the mammoth task laid out before him, he couldn’t help but think of Potter. The way he had always been acutely aware of Potter’s presence in any room. The fact that they were the only seekers in the whole school who were any sort of match for each other, even if Draco had always lost in the end. He thought of the stupid way Potter hounded him all through sixth year while he was trying to fix that cabinet, and the even more stupid way that even though it had annoyed Draco, he had also loved being the centre of Potter’s attention. The era of seeing Potter every single day and trying to pretend like he despised the mere presence of him was over.
‘I can see that your parents paid for the very best of healers, although you rarely needed them. I can also see you were given the most cutting edge of vision correction charms. I find it hard to believe your father would go to such lengths for you if he was as terrible a person as you claim.’
noise.
Of course, Harry sent Draco home early that day. Shame faced and apologetic, Draco let himself be nearly pushed through the floo by a wrung out looking Harry without passing on any of the information he’d discovered whilst at the clinic. Draco trusted that Harry wouldn’t get him into trouble, considering that technically Harry was Draco’s supervisor, but still; Draco felt like a prized idiot and a total failure.
‘I’ve been lying her in this stupid hospital doing nothing useful and my son, he went back to Hogwarts and I wasn’t there…’ His throat was tight, but he refused to cry. The mediwitch patted his arm gently.
‘Oh. Right. Isn’t the Black family motto French though?’ Draco nodded.
‘Harry it’s not like that.’
“Bloody hell, fire, and damnation, Granger. Are you trying to kill me? What the hell is that stuff?” Draco nearly dropped the cherry tomato he had been about to eat. It was a blazing hot day and the heath was packed with people who’d had the same idea as them. Except, as wizards, they benefitted from cooling and sun protective charms and could keep their perfect spot all day without burning. A few heads turned at Draco’s outburst, but most were rendered sluggish in the heat of the day.
‘Yes!’ Teddy didn’t come to Diagon all that often, but he’d never once forgotten the combination, even though on the occasions they did go, it was often by apparition. If Draco thought the Leaky was busy, it was nothing compared to Diagon itself. It was so packed he couldn’t see one exposed cobble anywhere.
‘It’s not fair Hermione. He doesn’t get to do this to me. First, he’s parading his dates in front of my face, then he’s putting me to bloody bed and calling the neighbourhood watch!’ He was so confused and frustrated.
‘You’re lucky it’s Christmas and I love you.’ He said begrudgingly.
‘Does it have something to do with this? Don’t worry, I haven’t read it, I just found it.’ He took the note out of his pocket and handed it to Teddy. He took it from him and unfolded it.
Draco wasn’t going to be the one to explain.
of all things. And the hair that is pulled back from his face is actually neatly plaited down the back.
‘There’s this boy, he’s in Slytherin. And I don’t think all Slytherins are bad, I promise! I know you’re good, you’re the best. It’s just, he isn’t.’
‘Of course. Great idea.’ He croaked. Harry didn’t seem to notice the change in Draco’s mood. He’d been doing so much better at that too.
“You have a beautiful voice.” He said before he could stop himself. Her glare softened, as if suspended, and it took a second for her to get over the shock of being complimented. She blinked her long eyelashes again and the warmth in Harry’s chest fluttered like it was trying to escape. A fine strand of hair fell into her eyes and instinctively he reached out to tuck it behind her ear. She stared, frozen, as he did so.
“Draco-” Harry choked, “You’re- you’re going to have to stop doing that.” Draco froze immediately.
‘I was thinking about it and I realised how easy it would be to go too far the other way. It’s important to make sure wizards understand muggle culture, but that doesn’t mean we should forget about wizarding culture too. I thought maybe you’d like to teach them some of the things you were taught when you grew up. Maybe it’s a stupid idea, I don’t even know what growing up in a magical household is even like. I just thought it was something important to you…’ It was, and Draco was blown away by how much thought and care Harry was putting into this. It seemed like he’d finally found a way to save people without putting himself in danger.
“The only way I could assuage Pansy was to promise her we’d go through the plan together.” She said after a beat of silence.
“Ah. Well, no, there isn’t. But I’m sure I could come up with one in the next twenty-four hours. The intent is pretty clear, and I know which direction to engineer a counter-curse from. It just takes time to perfect the wand movement and the right emphasis. These old spells are temperamental when performed with wands.”
‘Jesus Christ, Harry. Remind me to never, ever, let you name our kids.’ That was the worst alias name he’d ever heard in his life.
‘I see what you mean. It would make sense too. It’d be the kind of place where people might expect to see aconite, so that wouldn’t raise too much suspicion. It’ll also have the broadest demographic possible, which explains why none of the victims relate to each other.’ Harry said. Draco flushed at the methodical way Harry dealt with the case. He’d never seen Harry in his professional sphere and it was quite maddening.
‘You’re going to be ok, aren’t you? Every time I go to school you get sick…’ He hated that already school had become so synonymous with his magic issues – he’d never wanted that.
‘I’m starting a new project.’ Harry’s gaze snapped back up to Draco, his eyes blazing brightly.
They walked arm in arm down the street and Draco wondered how long it had been since he’d felt this relaxed around Harry. He wondered if it really had been so simple as telling him how he felt, although they were still no closer to figuring out why Draco’s mental state was affecting the dark mark. He pressed his left arm a little closer to Harry, as if his presence alone would siphon the dark magic away.
‘Thank you.’ He pulled Teddy into a hug which he gave back in equal measure. When they pulled apart, Harry handed him a plate of pastry.
What was the appropriate course of action when one finds a possibly wild animal in one's home? And a fox at that.
“Well, will this spell, supposing it works, create an anchor
Draco snorted. ‘You. Capable of promoting your own political agenda. It’s so ludicrous its comical.’ Harry gave him an exasperated look and he sobered himself. ‘Alright. Fine. Where do we start?’ Harry’s grin was nearly blinding and it warmed Draco’s heart seeing him happy again.
barred not no holes barred you heathen.’ Harry sniggered anyway and tugged Draco a little closer.
“First question.” Pansy turned her sharp eyes on Draco. “If something happens to Hermione, what are you going to do with your magic restrictions.” Her stare was piercing, and Draco swallowed thickly.
‘You’re ok. I’ve got you.’ Harry rubbed his back soothingly as he emptied the contents of his stomach. When he was done, Harry vanished the mess without a word and shot a cleaning charm at him. He was overwhelmingly grateful.
He set the album to one side and moved onto the next one which was a selection of sweet from Honeydukes. He was too young to visit the shop at Hogsmeade of course. He appeared equally as enthralled by each present as the last, and Draco felt a knot of tension dissolve knowing he’d done well this year. The last present however, was the most important. He’d wrapped it in a box so as not to give too much away.
‘What are you doing here? You’re going to ruin that dress,’ he pointed at the long hem resting on the dirt track.
During the first month of his agreement with Hermione, Draco searched for apartments and jobs near Paris. Not in Paris, because there’s no way he’d be able to afford to live in Paris, but close enough that he could have an inter-city floo connection or to use muggle transport if necessary.
May 1999
leave Harry.’ Draco said petulantly. It was always a source of contention; whether Draco left Harry or Harry left Draco.
“We’re your friends!” Greg said like it was the most obvious thing in the world. For a moment Draco forgot how bone weary he was, how drained and sick he felt. There were people in the world who did believe in him, even before they knew anything, and he hadn’t even given them the opportunity to step up for him.
He traced the scar lightly with his index finger. Harry was always funny about letting people touch his scar. Teddy had been fascinated by it when he was a baby. Obviously, he didn’t understand what it was or what it meant, he just thought it was a funny shape. Still, Draco had taught Harry that he didn’t have to fear his scar anymore, it was a symbol of survival, not just of Harry but of everyone, and not just because it made him famous.
‘Thank you, Molly. It means a lot to me.’ He told her earnestly. She nodded and stood back up again, breaking their little moment.
His resolve was somewhat diminished by the time the floo spat him out into his small flat. It had just meant to be a stop-gap in the early days after the split. Draco had half expected Harry to come charging after him and tell him it had all been a huge mistake and he didn’t want him to go. Draco’s life obviously wasn’t destined to be a crummy romance novel.
Harry explains as much of his case as he’s been given dispensation to share. There has been a string of incidents of an unknown curse which causes any, and all, light to burn the victim’s skin. At first, the DMLE had thought the only offending light was direct sunlight, so naturally shut the victims inside until they could figure out how to fix it. However, it quickly became clear that it was all light sources. It not only meant that the patients were becoming weaker and their eyesight was deteriorating, it was also impossible to monitor them properly in the pitch black. Harry had exhausted every avenue, including Hermione, and had found no trace of a curse like it.
“Failsafe,” Granger said in a low voice, “stops you getting out once you’re in. There’s no way of knowing which door will be the right one, but I’ll know it when I see it.” Draco’s stomach plummeted to the floor. He had imagined this would be much easier than this.
In the few seconds it took Harry to get out of the car after Draco, he was already soaked to the bone. The rain was getting heavier and heavier by the minute. Even though it was a relatively warm day, this was still England, and the rainwater was freezing. When he saw Harry emerge from the passenger’s seat, Draco turned on him.
‘What?’ Teddy was looking at him nervously, as if waiting for Draco to shout at him. How could a kid at Hogwarts be bullying him? More to the point, why would Teddy care about what anyone had to say about Draco? Teddy knew him better than almost anyone, save Harry, he knew what was true and what wasn’t. At least, as much as he and Harry had agreed to tell him for now. Then he remembered the note in his pocket.
” Malfoy’s fists were clenched so hard by his sides that his knuckles were turning white. He was flushed red with anger and disbelief, his hair beginning to fall across his forehead and into his eyes as his composure failed him.
By the time he’d made it to the open plan kitchen-living room, all Draco’s idea of course, he’d managed to collect his scattered belongings. He was looking around for his wand, which he must’ve dropped somewhere along the way, when a lone picture frame caught his eye. He walked over to the side table next to the sofa he had been adamant was worth the small fortune it cost and picked up a silver-guilt frame he’d never seen before. He turned the photo around and gasped when he realised that it was a photo of him he’d never known had been taken.
The sky was a deep violet colour as the sunrise fought in vein to break through the howling storm. It took Draco nearly twenty minutes to reach the aspen trees as he battled against the force of the wind. Belatedly, he realised that it was foolish to stand beneath a copse of trees in a storm, but he wouldn’t turn back now.
‘Just drink it. Don’t deny your sweet tooth at Christmas.’ Draco took a sip and looked back at Harry in shock. The bastard had added a little something extra to it.
‘Missed you Harry.’ Draco said.
“Stop that!” Harry exclaimed. He tried to wrestle the orange monstrosity away from the fox, but it snarled and hissed at him as if preparing to attack him too. “I know you understand me!
Draco frowned. “What do you mean?” It unnerved him seeing Pansy even vaguely emotional. She had always made a particular effort to keep her thoughts and feelings close to her chest. He used to dismiss this as a Slytherin trait, until he realised it was more a form of conditioning.
She glanced up from her guitar, peering through the curls continuously falling into her face.
They were wandering around the toy section of Harrods when Draco turned to Teddy and asked, ‘Ted, if you could have anything for Christmas, what would it be?’ He realised it wasn’t the smartest thing to ask a child, but he couldn’t help himself. Teddy paused in front of a giant Lego set which seemed to be a model of a spaceship. He opened his mouth and closed it again with indecision. Draco had to admit, he hadn’t expected him to find the answer so difficult.
‘You can see from your notes? What the hell kind of notes are they?’ He demanded. Smith shrugged nonchalantly.
That wasn’t important though. Harry was slumped over his desk, except he wasn’t working. His elbows were crumpling the papers scattered across the surface as his shoulders shook.
‘Well, in that case, carry on.’ So, Draco did kiss him. Only quickly however, since Gabriel was introducing them to his head pastry chef and Draco was determined not to let this opportunity pass him by.
‘Do I wish you’d felt like you could come to me? Of course. But honestly, all that matters to me is that you do what’s going to help you. I’ll say it a hundred times if I have to – all I want is for you to be happy.’ Draco needed to tell him how much he meant to him, but he didn’t have the words. Instead, he gripped Harry’s shirt and kissed him. It was a slow kiss, the kind that made Draco feel like he was melting into a pile of feathers. Harry held him with such care that he felt like he was some kind of coveted prize. He released Harry’s shirt and his hands came to rest and the base of his neck, his thumbs pressing lightly on his collarbones. The slight scratch of Harry’s stubble catching his chin was a delicious contrast to the softness of his lips and when he heard Harry's low groan when he pressed against him further, he knew they’d have to stop before he got too distracted.
‘Listen, Draco, about my birthday. I-’
“Is there something on my face?” She said suddenly, putting down her tea and smoothing her hands over her cheeks and forehead. He almost laughed at the rare display of insecurity, but he refrained.
After dinner, Harry’s concerns over Sirius’ loneliness flooded back. Although he was technically no longer a criminal. Everyone who was around when Pettigrew was supposed to have been murdered had since died themselves. All but Remus who was less trusted than Sirius because of being a werewolf. Without Dumbledore to vouch for him, Sirius was still stuck in hiding until they found a way to overturn his conviction. Most people seem to think he was killed in the war anyway.
‘Yeah.’ Teddy croaked and launched himself at Harry. Balance restored. Draco watched as Harry clutched Teddy close to his chest and all of a sudden, the whole scene was too much for him. The tightness in his own chest was so strong he felt like he couldn’t breathe. He tried to gasp in great gusts of air, but his body wouldn’t cooperate. The last thing he remembers before he passed out was Harry’s panic-stricken face and a pair of arms reaching out for him.
‘Harry,’ he rasped out around the sudden tightness in his throat. He wanted to ask so many questions. How did Harry know where he’d be? He hadn’t told him what he was doing today. How had he known Draco needed him? He couldn’t ask any of those questions however, because he broke down in tears right there in the street.
It was a fairly ordinary thing to do – to sit in the kitchen and talk over tea – so why did it feel like Harry was forgetting something very important? As they sat down at the kitchen table, Aspen kept very close to Harry, sitting quietly by his feet, which was very unusual. He even let Harry run his fingers gently between his ears, something Aspen loved but was very particular about.
‘Of course. This is your health, it’s of the utmost importance. You’re family after all.’ Draco felt his cheeks flush at Hermione calling him family. How the times had changed.
‘You’re very welcome. I think you might just be my favourite client ever. Not everyone has such lovely manners you know.’ Ella beamed proudly.
“In the Department of Mysteries.”
‘It’s perfect.’ Draco pulled Teddy into a tight hug and he wriggled like a toddler, trying to get out of Draco’s grip.
“Oh, come off it, Malfoy, it’s only me. I’m not about to hex you.” Harry tries to lighten the mood but Malfoy only frowns. It makes two perfectly symmetrical eleven lined between his eyebrows that weren’t there the last time Harry saw him. For some unknown reason, Harry loves them.
“Draco, darling, I know you’re taking this hard, but has it occurred to you that maybe Potter doesn’t
‘Well, well, look who we have here!’ Draco said as he approached his old friend.
‘Draco, I’m your-was your husband. I know this.’ They both winced at the slip and Draco’s heart twisted uncomfortably.
‘You’ve been looking after him though, haven’t you?’ Draco had been trying to teach her to watch out for the other children, give them all a sense of camaraderie.
Draco sat back in his chair with a frown on his face. That had been one hell of a whirlwind, so much so that he couldn’t decide if Granger was on his side or just trying to goad him. His head hurt from all the thinking he’d just done and weirdly enough he was quite ready to go back to his cell and sleep some more.
‘Oh, come off it. You of all people should know how ludicrous that is. How are any of my symptoms remotely like yours?’ Harry looked uncomfortable. ‘What…what is it?’
‘No one said it was going to be easy, you know. You can’t expect everything to go right back to normal just because you take the potions they tell you to.’ Harry looked down, fiddling with the edge of the blanket. He’d always had trouble looking at people when he was talking about how he felt. ‘We’re lucky to have you at all Draco, I just want to make sure it stays that way.’
‘Come back to you, you mean?’ He’d never asked Harry what he’d thought of the move. He turned to face Harry properly. The middle of the street wasn’t exactly the best place to have such a conversation, but Draco wasn’t sure when the subject might arise again. Not when they were on good terms anyway.
“THAT’S BECAUSE YOU ATE IT ALL!” He yelled right back, coming to investigate where the last pot went. He
“Paperclip?” Harry asks in confusion. “The portkey was a marble…”
‘This French guy is a pain in the arse. He’s taken over that poor inspector’s, case and then has the nerve to call him incompetent. None of his theories can be back up by evidence, even if they are right! Honestly, he has no respect for police.’ Draco grinned.
His arms shook had he lent against the bathroom sink. He stared at his face in the mirror, noticing only the bags under his eyes and the grey pallor of his skin. He was getting thinner by the day, his bones protruding sickeningly. He thought of the bruise he had on his hipbone from when he’d accidently walked into the table in potions – it had felt like someone had snapped the bone in half. His lip trembled as he held back a sob. He couldn’t do it. He couldn’t kill Dumbledore. The man was batshit crazy, but he didn’t deserve to be murdered. But what would happen if he didn’t do it? The Dark Lord, he was going to kill his family. His mother. The only person who ever loved him for who he was, not what he should be.
‘I think if Harry gave you the impression that he, loves you?’ He looked at Draco questioningly.
‘What’s wrong love?’ Harry asked him quietly. Draco sniffled again.
‘I want to make it clear that I have no problem with Head Auror Potter. He has only ever been kind and professional whilst I’ve been here.’ Lies. ‘I have some personal issues I’m currently working through, and I feel it would be best for me to move on. As far as I know, my contract only extended to providing potions expertise and since it doesn’t stipulate any specific hours, I believe I may be called in to consult on an as-and-when basis.’ Draco knew he needn’t have fallen back into professional speech but there was no way he was going to talk about this to the Minister for Magic, however close friends they had once been.
‘Thanks! Love you Daddy.’ Teddy gave him a hug as he got up to use the floo yet again that day.
‘Well, no, not quite,’ Hermione said, flushing, ‘I am going to be his PA, but it’s with a move to…I don’t know how to say this. It’s with a view to becoming the next Minister…’ Draco’s jaw nearly hit the floor.
‘It’s surprisingly difficult to spot. Often such memories are all linked to a particular event or person or even place. They might be spread out across a long period of time in small chunks so that you’re not even aware of it. I think you’ve made enough progress in trusting me that we can give it a go.’ He was scribbling away in that stupid notebook again. Draco wanted to burn it.
Draco found himself being shooed upstairs the minute they got home by a ridiculously sharp looking Harry. He had to snap himself out of a stupor when he realised he’d been staring at him for a good few minutes and not listening to a word he said. Harry was giving him a smug look he wanted to wipe right off his well-defined features. Oh, but he had forgotten how hot Harry was when he dressed well. Not that he wasn’t ridiculously hot all the time though.
‘Oh! Sorry pépère, I was looking for Draco. Have you seen him? Sorry, l’as-tu vu?’ Draco gaped at him.
‘Shit!’ He jumped back with the force of it and immediately the temperature dropped to a more manageable level.
“Really Granger? And you think my animagus would be conspicuous?” He raised his eyebrows at her, and she had the decency to look embarrassed. She was lucky that she only blushed lightly, unlike Weasley whose entire head turned tomato red.
‘Ok, fine. Six months. Not a day more, Granger, and if I don’t have the most concrete reason in the world to stay here then I’ll be gone. Don’t think otherwise.’ In truth, Draco was scared that if he did leave, Teddy would never forgive him. Of course, Hermione knew that and was playing on his weakness. Bloody Gryffindors, Draco swears most of them are snakes in disguise.
"Now come on, you go and find Draco and fuck him against a wall or whatever it is you do nowadays and I'll go talk some sense into my dumb ass little brother." George says, pulling Harry up off the wall and ruffling his hair in that brotherly way he and Fred always used to do.
"I guess I just have a thing for dragons." He says, looking straight into Dracos eyes, and Draco blushes slightly at the intense stare.
"But... Sirius was always trying to rebel against his family." Harry says slowly, and Kreacher nods.
It's 6:30pm. Harry doesn't know how he managed to waste an entire day doing nothing but playing guitar and having nightmare filled naps, but he sighs as he stands up. He knows he needs to go back to the castle, and he knows McGonagall is going to be mad at him for missing all of the meals today so he should at least try and make it to dinner which he could, but he just really doesn't want to. He does want to go back to the castle and have a long hot shower though so he puts his jacket back on and grabs his guitar before making his way back through the passageway. He manages to avoid anyone important as he drops his guitar off in the dorm room and makes his way to the sixth floor bathroom.
"Professor can I ask you something?" He asks, standing opposite McGonagall.
"Well he won't be with Hargrid, he wouldn't let Harry stay out." Ginny says and Luna nods.
The two continue to do this for the next week, both denying everything when they're asked about it, replying with the fact that they hate each other or a snarky remark.
"I'm gonna tell him." He says as he turns back to Hermione and her eyes light up. She's been gushing about how cute the two of them are ever since they sat down for dinner.
"I-" He whimpers, and Draco runs his thumb across his cheek, preying he continues. "I don't know what to do." Harry sits up and Draco watches in confusion because Harry is definitely in the middle of some sort of emotional breakdown and Draco wants desperately to help him. Harry gets up, and Draco quickly gets up too before Harry can run out of the dorm. Draco grabs Harry's bicep with his right hand, reaching up to place his left hand on Harry's cheek, making him look him in the eyes. There are tears streaming down Harry's cheeks, and each one breaks Draco's heart.
"Sorry Professor." Harry mumbles.
"Fuck Harry." He groans and Harry smirks, suddenly taking all of Draco. Draco's hands immediately grab Harrys hair and he groans which makes Harry groan. Harry bobs his head at a steady rhythm until he feels Draco getting close, when he varies his speed which drives Draco insane and it's not long before his fists are tightening in Harry's hair and he's moaning out Harrys name along with a few groans and mumbled 'fuck's' as his warm cum shoots down Harry's throat and he swallows it all.
"Hey." Harry smiles when he sees Draco near the entrance to the quad, walking over to him and sitting on the wall next to where he's standing.
A few minutes later Draco butters a slice of toast and holds it out for Harry.
He hasn't told anyone, apart from George but they got really close after the war, about how he and Draco sleep together every night, or anything that happens in their dorm room. He quite liked the idea of it being a secret between the two of them. He knows for a fact that Draco hasn't told any of his friends, they'd have a fit or suggest Draco needs therapy.
"From McGonagall?" Harry shrugs. He know's it's not. He still hasn't given her Sense and Sensibility back, which he needs to do. And she wouldn't secretly give him a book, she'd just hand it to him. When Harry enters the great hall it's already nearly full. He decides to ask McGonagall, just in case, so rather than walking over to the Gryffindor table he walks to the teachers table.
"Oh, okay." He says and Harry frowns slightly.
"Okay, guess I'm staying here then." He says and he takes Harrys hand who pulls him down on the bed next to him.
Draco squeezes his hand as they reach the main living room, turning to Harry.
"I might." Harry kisses him again, fingers playing with Draco's hair, splayed out on the pillow under him.
"We've all been through a lot. We don't blame you for what you did."
"You didn't tell Weasley did you?" Draco asks and Harry shakes his head. Draco looks over at him and struggles to breathe. Harry is leaning against the railing on his hands, which means his muscles are very prominent and he looks kind of amazing.
"Really?"
They stay and chat for an hour or two before deciding someone will probably realise if they both go missing for too long, so they make their way back to honeydukes and through the tunnel. They manage to make their way to their dorm room without interruption or being questioned, and when they get to their dorm Draco wraps his arms around Harry's neck and pulls him into a hug.
"Hey Hagrid."
"Anyway, your teachers have told me they are very impressed with your work. They tell me you are quickly becoming the best in your classes. How are you otherwise? I notice you haven't been eating a lot?" McGonagall says and Harry shrugs, sinking back into the chair.
"It's okay, you know. Not to want to talk about what happened. You've been through a lot, Potter. More than anyone should have to go through. And if you feel that now it's all over you need a break then that's okay."
"Good. Now get yourselves to your common room." She says with a small smile and the three students stand up and leave the room.
"Okay." Harry says, sitting on the sofa and leaning against the arm.
Draco falls into a shocked silence when he finishes reading and he closes the notebook with slightly shaky hands. Harry takes it from him and puts it in his bedside table drawer whilst Draco takes a deep breath. He guesses Draco needs a few minutes to actually comprehend what he just read. Draco has no idea how Harry is still a functional human after everything he's been through.
"Wolfsbane?" As soon as the word leaves his lips Ron is gone and Harry is left alone in the dark.
"Are you okay?" Harry notices Draco sounds so uncharacteristically nervous and it makes his heart flutter.
"Yeah?" Harry asks and Draco takes a deep breath. Harrys stupid fucking face just has to be so perfect.
"Anytime brother." James says and then Harry and Draco are back in their dorm.
‘Draco what is it?’ Harry crouched low by the side of the bed so that he was at Draco’s eye level and tried to prise away the bedsheets Draco had in a death grip over his face so that Harry could see him properly. Draco might be long and thin, but his strength was not to be underestimated. Harry couldn’t budge them at all.
He listened as Harry and Teddy wandered around upstairs. He wondered what they were doing, it wasn’t as if they needed to but Teddy to bed anymore. He tried his best to stop thinking, just for a few minutes, but he couldn’t. His thoughts strayed to how much more complicated things were now that Teddy knew. If things ever broke down between him and Harry, it wouldn’t bear thinking about what would happen.
“Harry, I don’t think you should-” Ron’s warning died in his throat because the fox had collapsed on the floor and rolled over on its back, whining for attention. Overcoming the shock a little, Harry could only think of how bizarre the whole thing was, and for the first time wondered if perhaps he was on a bad trip from a spiked drink. It wouldn’t be the first time.
‘It’s not really any of your business, Wood. Come of Ted.’ He cringed at how much he sounded like his father, and purposefully held his hand out for Teddy to prove the opposite. Teddy, to his credit, had learned better than to question Draco when they were in public. They left the shop and Wood, and Draco put on a brave face to battle the crowds to the apothecary where he’d need to go in the first place.
He flung the main doors open as quickly as he could and gasped in the icy cold air outside. He sounded as though he’d just ran a half marathon despite only having stormed down one floor. He spun around in a circle trying to regain his bearings. He more often than not used his limited floo travel to get in and out of the clinic unnoticed, but he couldn’t handle the floo in his current situation. He was about to cry out in frustration when he spun into something warm and solid. He stumbled backwards but was prevented from going too far. He was vaguely aware of the smell of grapefruit.
‘Ted?’ He questioned. Teddy had been a cuddly baby but from about three onwards he’d only ever really hugged Harry. They’d all come to accept that Teddy wasn’t a particularly affectionate person, and now by eleven he was entering his ‘I’m too cool for hugs’ phase. Teddy just stayed clinging onto Draco and he was forced to wrap his arms around the boy’s skinny frame for fear he would knock him over if he didn’t.
“Well, you know… it was pretty standard. We just, broke up… we stopped getting along and stuff.” The shrug Ron gave wasn’t as nonchalant as he had aimed for and Harry could see the doubt on his face.
‘Of course! They’re just through there.’ Daphne pointed towards a white door Draco hadn’t even noticed before.
It was like something in his chest exploded that he hadn’t even known was there. It was too much – the worry over Teddy, the stress of his lack of magic, mending things with Harry, the orphanage, Pansy coming back. Something had to give. The explosion was literal as well as metaphorical as the bottles on the shelves expanded, sending shards of glass and pieces of plastic everywhere, their contents soiling his clothes and his hair. Then, the shelves themselves rattled and crashed to the floor. Draco could do nothing but shield himself with his arms, his heart beating wildly in his chest, and wait for the onslaught to end.
‘Take it off.’ He said gently. He didn’t try to unravel it himself, only lay there propped up on the plush pillows, watching him patiently. Draco picked at the edges. He debated how it might make him feel before he realised he was just making it worse by waiting. He peeled back the bandage. He held his breath as coil after coil slipped through his fingers until finally, there was just one, thin piece of material between him and the branding that turned his life upside down.
“I don’t see what that’s got to do with anything.” She was being deliberately prickly.
“That’s ok, cars have wipers. If you turn that stick there-” Harry pointed to a lever at the side of the steering wheel, “yeah, that one…”
which theorised Potter had been lured into the sea by sirens where he now ruled over the merpeople. Draco had witnessed Potter’s ungainly attempt to use gillyweed and that scenario was about as likely as Draco moving to Morocco and burning his porcelain skin in the scorching sun every day. One thing was true: Harry Potter had been missing for five months and Draco was the only person who knew where he went. Presuming, that is, that Potter followed through with the plan he'd told Draco.
‘You didn’t tell me that! Did you?’ At this point Draco honestly couldn’t remember what he’d said to whom.
“You alright mate?” Ron held Harry’s jacket out to him. He had forgotten about it completely. They stood in silence together when Harry couldn’t figure out what to say to him. “Bit weird seeing Malfoy again, isn’t it?" Ron said into the night. "I’d almost forgotten what she looked like.”
‘That might be pushing it a bit,’ Harry teased but kissed him before turning to the sentiment box. Draco called it that because it contained all the personal decorations that Teddy had made at muggle primary school. He hated it when they all went on the tree each year, but Draco refused to leave them out. His favourite was a clothes peg covered in sparkly silver material with a paper doily stapled to the back with some glitter on the top.
Harry’s heart melted when his careful petting had the fox butting his nose against Harry’s palm. Opening his hand, Harry was shocked when the fox rested his chin on his palm and hummed contentedly.
Draco hated his mind healer with a passion. He didn’t need to “relive his childhood trauma”, he didn’t need to discuss “the issues which led to the breakdown of his marriage”, and he certainly did not want to discuss how he felt about losing his magic. His mind healer didn’t seem to care about any of that.
“Hello?” Remus called from the drawing room and Sirius darted off towards the door.
‘I love you,’ Harry murmured. Even though he was almost asleep, Draco smiled.
‘He passes me notes in lessons. I ignored them at first, but then he started saying things about you.’ Teddy gave him the note to read.
‘Yes, darling, you’re a sausage. Now eat your breakfast.’ He glanced over at Susan who was making herself a cup of tea and watching him with a knowing expression. He didn’t know what she thought she saw but he didn’t question it. Susan made a cup of tea for him too and he leant against the counter as he watched them eat and chatter. Ella was desperately trying to keep yoghurt off Johnny’s face and failing miserably, but she didn’t seem to mind.
‘I saw him at the Quidditch shop in Diagon. He works there now.’
‘I’m very sorry Mr Malfoy, I will send the Minister to you immediately. Where will he be able to find you?’ Better.
‘Oi, Potter. At least wait until we get home.’ Harry’s head shot straight back up and his flush was almost purple with embarrassment.
“Oh, yes. The Ministry were dubious when I first applied for muggle identification so I could enroll, but I constricted a particularly watertight argument about why my studying amongst muggles was actually beneficial not only for their, and my own, reputation, but that it would also do wonders for cooperation efforts.” He scribbles some more notes down and then turns the page delicately with both hands. It amazes Harry that someone usually so bold and dismissive could also be so gentle and careful. It was like seeing a whole other person.
“But nothing. If that’s how you feel I’ll do it on my own.”
Draco wasn’t impressed with this kid’s lack of punctuation or grammar. He sighed. It was ironic that a Slytherin of all people would be attacking Draco’s past. He’d expected they’d either glorify the war or pretend it never happened. It made him angry though. Not because some stupid eleven-year-old was shit talking, but that he thought he could use it against Teddy. What happened between Draco and Harry had nothing to do with him.
“I just need to run a few spells over him, they should give me any magical signatures. There’s also a spell for revealing animagi, but I’m not sure if I want an escaped convict running around my home.” Harry’s heard skipped a beat. It wasn’t possible that she knew about Sirius. No one but Harry, Ron, and Hermione knew about his escape. Luna wasn’t even looking at Harry, she was babbling at the fox like he was a friend she’d known for years. Harry forced himself to relax.
He found Ella sitting on a bright blue beanbag in the corner of the library, her nose buried in a historical fiction novel about a lady in waiting to Queen Elizabeth I. He couldn’t fault her taste, although he doubted she understood half of what she was reading.
He had woken up worried about Ella. After his session with Smith, Harry had taken him home and they’d spent the day together. They’d gone for a short walk, as much as Draco could manage, and they’d talked about Christmas and what they might do about Teddy. They’d both needed it, he’d thought. Needed time to just be together without either one of them running off to do other things. Still, Draco had felt the underlying tension. There were things he wanted to say but couldn’t and he didn’t know if it was only him. He couldn’t expect that any of it was easier for Harry than it was for him.
Frustration reaching a critical point, he pulled at his hair as if bringing pain to his scalp would ease the tension wound through him. He all but ran down the stairs of the clinic, ignoring the stares of the strangers he passed on his way. He no doubt looked like a lunatic. The pounding of his heart hammering against his chest was making it difficult to breathe and he could feel the familiar sense of panic rising. It had been happening a lot more lately because of his medication, and he didn’t know what he could do to stop it.
He apparated to the doorstep of the house and knocked on her door. He cast a cooling charm quickly since it was a scorching hot day and even in the few seconds standing with his back to the sun he was feeling it. The downside to having a pasty complexion. He wasn’t waiting long when the door opened, and his heart sunk in his chest.
‘Draco! DRACO! Calm down. You’re going to have a panic attack. Breathe!’
He tried to slow him down, draw his lips back a bit, but Harry wasn’t falling for it. He gripped Draco’s waist and Draco gave up trying to resist. He met the ferocity of Harry’s kiss. It was clashing teeth and too much tongue, but Draco didn’t care. Harry was warm and familiar and just a little bit intoxicating. As his hands sank into Harry’s hair, he knew he was well and truly fucked. Harry’s hair was always one of Draco’s favourite things about him, even though he always pretended he hated it. Harry tasted like the low-quality beer he insisted on drinking and his birthday chocolate cake and if he was honest, Draco couldn’t get enough.
‘Don’t. You. Dare. Wear. Another. Man’s. Face. When. You’re. With. Me.’ He said as he beat Harry’s chest with his fists. His voice cracked on the last word and gave way to a tidal wave of emotion Draco himself hadn’t expected.
“Well, you are in fact very stupid, congratulations on finally noticing. Quite an achievement for you.” He wanted to come up with a cutting remark, but his brain was lagging, and the moment passed. They lapsed into silence. This was the only opportunity he would have to explain to Lyra what had been going on – the dreams, the dizziness, Aspen – everything. It was the only time he might be able to say anything without everyone thinking he was mad. Poisoned, maybe. But not mad.
‘Don’t be ridiculous. T’as une miette.’ He motioned for Harry to come closer and he swiped the crumb from the side of his lips. Of course, he couldn’t possibly do so without stealing a kiss or two. Or three. Ok no more than three.
‘I know but…Daddy isn’t the same without you. He’s…sad a lot. And he pretends he isn’t, but I know he is, and I don’t want him to be sad anymore. I just thought you might help him.’ Draco swallowed the lump that had formed in his throat. He knew he hadn’t done the best job keeping Teddy out of it, but he had tried.
‘Yeah. But you came anyway. Love you.’ He reached out for a hug, but his eyes were already closing again.
Harry rolled his eyes and took a step closer so he could wipe away a smudge of hummus at the corner of Draco’s mouth. He kissed him and blushed furiously when Draco pulled away to lick the hummus off Harry’s thumb.
Harry had instructed the aurors to move Draco into a small office in the main department now that he had solved the medical aspect of the case. Apparently, he was still needed to decipher the lab reports from downstairs when the aurors brought in samples from the raids and was given updated files on every turn of events in the hopes he could offer some insight. Draco was slightly worried about his position in the Ministry now that the potions aspect was through.
“Yeah, well, I’m sure as hell regretting it now!” He snapped back. Putting his phone back in his pocket, he took his wand out and, checking around to make sure no one would see, which they wouldn’t because they were in the middle of nowhere, he conjured a patronus asking Hermione to send them help. As soon as he had done so he ushered both of them back into the car and out of the rain. Draco was shivering as he slid back into the driver’s seat, his hair matted to his forehead. He looked small and scared and Harry felt terrible for putting him in this position.
‘Oh, that. It turned out to be no big deal in the end. Just someone being dramatic.’ Harry turned away from him, never once looking up from the bright screen, and went over to one of the few electric sockets in the house. Draco still didn’t even understand how Harry had managed to make them work with the magic, and even if he did, he’d hate them anyway. It was just another thing to drive a wedge between them.
‘Draco I-’ Harry started, but Draco had heard enough.
‘Wolfsbane? But surely-’
‘Don’t be sorry. You’re done being sorry, you don’t have to keep apologising. Just let me help you…please.’ He was doing that thing again. Where he looked at Draco like he was really seeing him, like he actually mattered. It made his skin crawl.
“I should be the one asking that. I know my presence is overwhelming, but you didn’t need to go all faint on me.” Harry cracked one eye open so that he could put the empty glass down safely, found that he wasn’t about to pass out or be sick, and decided it was safe to open them again.
‘Yes.’ He said proudly, puffing out his skinny chest. ‘I checked three times. Twice last night and once this morning.’ Draco felt a stab in his chest knowing Harry got to spend Teddy’s last night with him while Draco drank a whole bottle of chateauneuf du pape and cried watching
‘Can I do anything to help Mrs- Molly?’ He asked a frazzled looking mother hen.
‘I wish he’d stop speaking in bloody French.’ He mumbled under his breath.
him or because he cared
‘I’m fine, you know how it is.’ He would probably feel like shit for a couple of days but his attacks weren’t anywhere near as bad as they used to be. Hermione nodded.
“Potter’s not like that.” He concluded. “There’s no way he would just abandon m-everything.”
‘Draco, I- you know what? Fine. I can’t argue with that. It was wrong of me to try and force you to do anything anyway. Just promise me you won’t disappear off the face of the earth? The kids are forever complaining that they never see Uncle Draco anymore.’ Draco felt a pang of guilt at that. It was true, he had hardly seen Granger’s spawn in recent years, he barely had a reason to visit since he was no longer with Harry and he hadn’t wanted to run into him by accident either. Still, he couldn’t expect the kids to understand that.
“What the- how did you- they look amazing! Since when have you been such a good photographer?” Draco is gleeful that Harry’s surprise is because of him. It’s not very often that he manages to make him smile quite as brightly as that – all teeth and crinkles in the corners of his eyes.
‘But do I really-’
And if when they got home they made the most of Teddy staying at Ron and Hermione’s for the night…well, gentlemen don’t kiss and tell.
“Can I get that in writing?” Harry asked him cheekily. Draco swatted at Harry’s arse, but he was too slow as Harry was already turning and running away laughing.
‘You wouldn’t really…would you?’ Draco asked him after a while.
And then there was Ted. Draco couldn’t leave him. He’d been so young when Draco and Harry had first gotten together, he didn’t remember anything else. For all Draco’s faults, he couldn’t let the poor boy think that what went wrong in Draco and Harry’s relationship was his fault. He had to stick around to watch his favourite little wolf grow up. Not the Teddy was very little anymore. Still, Draco would never admit how much he loved him with all his heart. Nope, Malfoys don’t do any kind of affection. Absolutely not.
Did that mean he only enjoyed it because he was lonely? Did it matter than it was Harry? He did miss Harry. He missed the house. He missed waking up every morning and seeing that god-awful mop of raven hair. He missed the way Harry took great pleasure in the simplest things like Draco bringing him a cup of tea in the morning or Draco picking an outfit for one of his fancy Ministry do’s because he knew Harry had as much fashion sense as a Hippogriff at a circus.
‘Teddy,’ Harry sighed, ‘it’s not your job to worry about us. It’s our job to worry about you.’
He turned to go back into the kitchen when he noticed a piece of paper sticking out of the hinges of Teddy’s trunk. There was writing all over it, in multiple hands, and it looked like a note that had been passed around during class. He didn’t really have time to read it, but he pocketed it for later. He supposed it was snooping, really, but he hadn’t heard much about any of Teddy’s friends and he was curious. He walked back towards the kitchen and paused when he heard his name. The door had moved slightly since he’d walked out of the room and it wasn’t obvious he was there.
The Weasleys had been all over the news coverage in those early weeks, looking tearstained and even more bedraggled than usual. It occurred to Draco at the time that the Weasleys considered themselves Potter’s family, which made it all the sadder that Potter felt he didn't have one. He had tried very hard not to think about the lives that had been lost after he had let the Death Eaters into Hogwarts, but even he couldn’t help but think that one son was enough for the Weasleys to lose; they shouldn’t have to lose Potter too.
The door clanged open, making him jump. Harry was staring at him, his expression cautious, as though approaching a spooked horse. He hated it when he looked at him like that. He nearly always did it now, like Draco was fragile. He wasn’t fragile, he just destroyed the room without even trying. Except it was accidental magic – random, uncontrollable. It was like being a child all over again. Not that he’d ever had bouts of accidental magic even then, his father wouldn’t allow it.
Draco could feel a snarl rising in him like a caged animal. “You think I don’t know that?” He spat. “I was a disgrace years ago. Don’t fling that at me like it’s something new. Can you imagine what it would have looked like? A Malfoy the last person to see Saint Harry Potter before he disappeared. They’d have thrown me in Azkaban in an instant.”
Harry is fortunate in that the library is on the ground floor of the Manor, but less fortunate in that it’s at completely the opposite end from the entrance. It’s probably a good thing Malfoy won’t leave him alone with the books because four corridors down and he’s utterly lost. Finally, Malfoy leads him to a large room with only one small window, and walls and cabinets crammed to the ceiling with books. Many of them are old leather-bound prints from a century ago, but in fact many of them seem to have been created long before the invention of the printed word.
Draco snorted. ‘Letting your wife take brunt of the excitement? You’re letting the side down mate.’ They chatted amiably for a few minutes before a disgruntled looking Arthur appear with a fussing Hugo and Hermione excused herself.
At Draco’s involuntary smile, Harry stepped into the room properly and strode over to them.
‘Hugga!’ She said happily, trying her best to kiss her little brother before she gripped Draco’s coat with such ferocity her small knuckles turned white. Being only two, she missed Hugo’s forehead and planted a very slobbery kiss worryingly close to his eye. Naturally, Hugo didn’t seem to appreciate it.
Harry didn’t understand why he felt so raw visiting Sirius. His godfather looked the same as ever; still on the pale side, a little underweight, but otherwise a world of difference from his ragged appearance when he had been locked up. His long black hair even returning to the shiny curtain Harry remembered from old photographs he’d seen.
“Draco? Honestly, are you even on this planet today?” Pansy was looking down at Draco’s eggs which were being massacred by his fork instead of eaten.
Draco stood and wrapped his arms around him. He could feel him trembling against him, but he held him close and kissed his temple gently.
‘Draco, Harry hasn’t been Head Auror since October.’ Draco’s brows furrowed.
, Harry was conscious about have anti-apparition wards around the house to stop the crazier fans from trying anything.
She shrugged. “Better than ‘the posh twat’.” Just then Aspen came scampering back into the room. He went over to his water bowl, stuck his entire head in it, flicked water all over the floor, then jumped up and put his head in Harry’s lap.
‘I mean in the house, with me.’ Harry looked so sad that Draco’s eyes burned with unshed tears.
“Get back here, you cheeky little shit!”
He slowly pushed the door open to find Harry sat on the sofa with a solitary lamp on. It cast a little light, but it also emphasised the shadows under his eyes and made him look so much older than he was. As old as Draco felt maybe. Set out on the coffee table in front of him was Draco’s journal, the straps unbound.
After ten minutes the noise from upstairs stopped but Harry didn’t reappear. Draco waited; listened for any more sound, but there was nothing. After fifteen minutes, he grew impatient. He got up and made his way quietly upstairs to see what they were doing. He dodged the one creaky floorboard on the landing as he went to Teddy’s room at the far end of the house. He’d avoided that room since he came back – he didn’t want to see it still and empty when Teddy wasn’t there.
‘Why not?’ He asked her. He’d found she always had something to say about the books she read, even if they were just simple kiddie stories.
The shirt fell from Draco’s shoulder, exposing him to the cold. They both waited with bated breath for signs of the same black magic as before, but nothing. The seconds ticked by slower than treacle and Draco kept forgetting to breathe he was so anxious. After no more than five minutes, although it felt like a lifetime, it seemed he was finally in the clear.
Harry has nearly fallen off the sofa in his fit of laughter. He hadn’t expected Draco to be so enthusiastic about the idea, especially since he was scared of the toaster for about six months.
‘And why do you think it was him you saw before your accident,’ Smith pressed. How the bloody hell was Draco supposed to know that?
‘It’s good to see you, mate. Honestly, we’re been seeing more of the ferret than you recently and I know he’s sort of alright these days but come on, you’re my best mate.’ The Weasel was saying. ‘No offence Malfoy.’
‘Don’t you think maybe we should eat first? It’s,’ he looked down at a battered old watch he used to keep in a box, ‘nearly eight and I doubt you’ve remembered to eat since I left you this morning.’ He gave Draco a pointed look. It was true, Draco’s new potion regime suppressed his appetite a lot which was dangerous since he needed to build up as much energy as he could.
‘You’re taking the piss, right? You can’t seriously be throwing that in my face again. Who even are you?’ Draco knew he was being horrible and unreasonable, but he didn’t much care. He was having a terrible day and he couldn’t deal with this right now. Thankfully, when Teddy went off to school, he and Harry wouldn’t have any reason to see each other anymore.
“It’ll come to you. It’s not as if you’ve got anything better to do.”
‘I’m glad he’s back home, because he makes you happy too.’ Harry didn’t say anything to him, just backed out of the room and closed the door. He rested his head against the door and closed his eyes.
‘Positive.’
“Well, you have it all the same. Thank you, Draco.” And she turned on her heel and walked in the opposite direction. He stood there in the cold and the dark for a while, his head clouded with everything he needed to remember tomorrow, but also feeling full of an emotion he couldn’t quite put his finger on. He wouldn’t exactly call Granger his friend, not with their current quid pro quo relationship, but somehow it still mattered to him that she was being nice. Even if he claimed otherwise.
‘…And that was a long time ago. You’ve spent long enough with the Weasleys to know that once you’re family you’re always family. Stop giving yourself such a hard time. It’ll be great, I promise. And if it gets too much all you have to do is find me. I warned them, they know you’re having a rough time, no one will mind if you only manage a few hours. Ok?’ Draco wasn’t convinced, but he nodded anyway. What exactly had Harry told them? If they treated him like an invalid all day…
‘Daddy, when do you have to go home?’ Teddy turned to Draco. Draco looked at Harry, this is what they’d been waiting for
‘I know.’
“When you bloody well left without him! Honestly Potter, being partnered with you is the worst thing that’s ever happened to him. And he actually has the audacity to say you’re the best auror in the department. I swear if he’s dead I’ll kill him.” Harry avoids pointing out the flaw in that logic.
‘I will. Love you.’ He gave Draco one last over-tight hug when Draco gratefully returned, committing to memory how Teddy felt and smelled just in case he might forget.
'I- I never thought about it like that I guess. It's been hard, knowing I have missing memories that might fix everything.' Harry didn't say anything and Draco felt a brief flare of anger that he seemed to be ignoring him, but then he suddenly frowned and reached for one particular vial. It was the dustiest of all of them – it looked like it hadn’t been touched in years.
“Yes.”
‘Thanks Hermione. You’re not so bad yourself.’
‘Yeah, would you have come otherwise?’ They both seemed keen to know and if Draco was honest, he’d had enough of his friends prying in his and Harry’s affairs. They were done, there was nothing more left to be said.
He weaved through the plants behind Luna, although he was mainly following the sound of his fox. The crying made his heart hurt and he wanted to take the bundle back from her. It had been less than twelve hours and already the fox had him wrapped around its little…do foxes have fingers? Toes? Toe doesn’t really have the same ring.
‘I think so. I read you stories, don’t I?’ She cracked a small smile and he knew he was getting somewhere.
‘You are? What for?’ She searched his face as though waiting for him to say something else, he didn’t understand why.
“Why? What have you two done? I should have known the two of you coming here together would mean nothing but trouble…” Harry ran his eyes over the tapestry again. Something was wrong.
It was a slow, desperate kind of kiss. The kind that made Harry’s toes curl with the sheer force of love he felt towards his boyfriend. Draco’s face was still tacky with tears, but Harry didn’t care. Draco’s lips were perfect against his own and combined with his body heat, Harry wouldn’t have wanted to be anywhere else in the world.
That only seemed to upset her further. “You can’t expect the Wizengamot to be reasonable with you.” She held up a hand to silence him when he opened his mouth to interrupt. “No, I’m not saying this will go that far, all I’m saying is that if it
“What do you want, Draco?” Harry whispered. All the breath escaped Harry’s lungs when Draco shivered. It couldn’t have been from the cold.
By the time Harry returned that evening, Draco was in a state. He wasn’t able to put up the Christmas decorations because of the charms, he wasn’t able to leave the house again because it was one of his bad days and he’d already used the floo, and he’d accidentally sliced through his palm and couldn’t heal it. He’d retreated to the summerhouse to write in the sodding journal his mind healer wanted him to write. It was tricky because he’d done his best to bandage up his bleeding hand, but it meant he couldn’t hold the book open to write properly.
They lapsed into silence again for a while. Draco’s mind was racing with everything. His heart was screaming for him to forgive Harry in an instant because he loved him, and he needed him, and Harry was there for him when it mattered. The voice in the back of his mind was telling him to be careful, to be concerned that Harry would go to a bar and get pissed and sleep with someone. It was just so…not Harry. He didn’t know. Harry was clearly shaken about the whole thing, but if Draco fell right back into his arms like it didn’t matter, did that make him a pushover? It was so difficult to know.
The security office was next to the lifts and had a view over the entire Atrium. Draco walked as confidently as he possibly could to give the impression that he was absolutely supposed to be there and knew exactly what he was doing. From a young age he had discovered this was the best policy in most situations. It was strange to be able to walk here without people stopping and staring or hurling insults at him, but he also couldn’t afford to let his guard down. Scanning the edges of the Atrium he noticed a narrow door built to blend into the wall which he suspected was the supply cupboard. He slotted in behind a gaggle of witches who were discussing the advantages of using pens over quills and slipped through the door as fast as lightening.
‘Merry Christmas,’ Teddy whispered as Draco started to fall back to sleep.
Harry shook his head and walked into the classroom, wondering why Draco wanted to meet him by the lake of all places. Summer had hit Scotland unseasonably hard already, even though it was only mid-June, and Draco would surely not want to spend much time outside being as pale as he was. The temperature was rapidly climbing into the thirties and Professor McGonagall had been forced to relax their uniform code to account for the boiling hot castle. Harry had rolled his sleeves up to his elbows and loosened his tie.
‘Hermioneeee.’ Harry groaned, dropping his head into Draco’s lap.
‘Because you’re really pretty and people think you’re poisonous but you’re not really. And everyone thinks Daddy’s fantastic at everything so you can’t love him because you’re bad. It’s a bit like rhubarb though, the stems make great pie, but the leaves are poisonous. It’s good and bad but you can’t have one without the other.’ Draco’s brain couldn’t process that.
‘This was…this was his?’ He twirled the wand between his fingers. Draco wondered if he felt any connection with it. His own father’s wand had been destroyed when he went to Azkaban for the last time, and his mother had been buried with hers – as per tradition.
“Fucking hell I did not come here to be your nursemaid.”
‘Hey buddy,’ he said, kneeling down in front of Teddy. For the first time ever, Teddy didn’t turn away from Draco and go straight to Harry. Harry seemed to realise from this that something serious was going on.
“Draco!” Pansy flung her arms around him, despite the state he was in, despite how terrible he looked, how bad he smelled. Even a year ago his relationship with Pansy was such that she wouldn’t have dared approach him like that, but he could feel tears welling in his eyes as he buried his face in her sleek hair.
‘You’re welcome. I think maybe you should keep it hush hush for a bit though, we don’t want to upset the others, do we?’ She nodded seriously. ‘I have to find Teddy and head home sweetheart, but I’m sure I’ll see you very soon.’ Her shoulder dropped and he felt awful. ‘I know, but all good things come to an end sometime, to make way for the next big adventure.’ That seemed to pacify her.
‘Draco?’ A groggy voice called across the living room. Draco slipped his bookmark into the trashy muggle novel he’d been reading as Teddy appeared next to him.
‘You never hurt anyone, Draco.’ Harry said quietly.
‘Of course I do, why would you even ask me that?’ Harry looked uncomfortable and Draco wondered if he’d been missing something glaringly obvious.
In a split-second Harry was in front of him, a warm palm pressed over his heart as he muttered the words of what Draco assumed was a healing charm. His head was getting fuzzy as he became more and more oxygen deprived. He searched for something to focus on as he registered Harry mouthing the words
‘Very good sir. Will sir being in needing of anything? Spungen means, will sir be needing anything?’
“Who the heck is banging on your door at this time in the morning?”
‘How the hell would you know if I’m trying or not! You’re never fucking here anyway! Yesterday was the first day you actually spent more than an hour with Teddy since he came home! I get it. The kids are important. I know that, I’ve met them, I’ve spent time with them, but why are they more important than us? You have a team of people who look after them when you’re not there. Who the hell does Teddy have? Me. And a fat lot of good I’ve done him! Don’t try to tell me that you had to do paperwork on Boxing Day. Don’t take me for a fool.’ Draco was furious. He could feel the blood flooding his veins like fire.
“That’s not going to happen. Granger is a highly capable witch and-”
Somehow, he’d never been able to bring himself to leave. He supposed that said a lot about how he felt about the whole thing, but he was never quite willing to admit defeat and buy somewhere more permanent. This flat was small and cramped and half of his stuff was probably ruined now that it had spent three years under a shrinking charm, but he’d done his best to make this place a home.
Sirius cleared his throat. “Yes, of course. It’s nice to see you. What brings you here?” His words seemed disjointed and too polite.
‘Brilliant. I’ll inform Mrs Granger-Weasley of your whereabout then? Although, I doubt she needs me to, considering I found her listening at the door when I arrived.’
‘I’ll try Hermione. It’s just…not as easy as it looks.’
‘What do you think?’ Harry encouraged.
What truth, Hermione? I don’t have a truth to tell.
By the time Harry returned, Draco had drunk his glass of wine and was contemplating a second glass – mainly to distract himself from the worry that was niggling away at him. After what felt like an age, Harry finally stepped back indoors.
‘Then he stopped. He stopped talking about his friends and started telling me about his classes. I mean, I care about his classes, don’t get me wrong. It’s just, there’s more to school than textbooks and spells. I want him to have fun and makes friends and be a kid, you know?’ Draco nodded. Above all else, he wanted Teddy to be happy.
And when he got to the part about the Veil, her face resembled
‘Only one?’ Pansy said, her nose wrinkling and her face twisting in distain. ‘I thought you were supposed to be posh Draco.’ He snorted an undignified laugh and followed her as she strutted out of the room.
‘We’re happy to let you leave, as long as you have someone to stay with you while you recuperate, preferable with a next of kin. Which, if memory serves,’ the healer flicked through Draco’s file, ‘is the other Mr Potter.’ Draco couldn’t think straight; his heart was beating at a hundred miles an hour. He glanced warningly at Harry who squeezed his hand. It was a useless gesture since he could hardly feel it, but he did see it and he supposed it would have to do.
‘You didn’t like that man.’ Teddy said once they were away from the crowds again. Draco sighed.
‘You didn’t half scare me to death Draco.’ Harry said as he sat down in the same chair he’d been sitting in when Draco had woken the first time.
‘You have work over there?’ She asked him. She wandered over to the far corner and started fiddling with one of the microscopes. Magic worked really well for a lot of Draco’s work but sometimes nothing could beat the human eye.
‘Since when did we ever get along?’ It wasn’t like they’d been holding hands and making daisy chains since the day they met. Harry dropped down onto Draco’s lumpy sofa.
‘Hermione that’s fantastic! Congratulations!’ He burst out. He grinned at her broadly and was about to ask her how long she expected to be PA before taking over when a loud crash made them both jump. One of the empty shelves fell from the wall and splintered as it hit the edge of Hermione’s desk.
Ok, maybe it was still a big deal.
“And you just let him?” She was angry again. He was starting to think short fuses were another unseemly Gryffindor trait. “At no point did it occur to you to say ‘
‘Not all of them, obviously. I just wanted you to see a few things the way I remember them. It’s a bit of a convoluted way of saying I love you I suppose. I didn’t really know what to get you and I’m not always good at remembering to say it…’ Harry tilted his chin up so he was forced to look at him. Harry’s eyes were glittering with tears that threatened to spill over, which they did a moment later when he blinked.
The dizzying underwater feeling slammed back into him with such force his knees almost buckled. More flashes flew across his vision. The man, who he knew now to be Draco, yanking his arm away from Madam Malkin during a fitting sometime around their sixth year. Harry throwing punch after punch after a quidditch match until Madam Hooch had to pull him away, leaving the boy on the ground before him dazed and bloody. He remembered the rage he felt, the animosity between them, but then he saw a wall of fire and felt that desperate need to
Two burly Hit Wizards crashed through the thick mahogany doors just like they had when they’d come to raid the Manor after his father’s arrest. One was built like Vince; tall and broad with a head slightly too small for his body. The other one had long, greasy hair pulled into a ponytail at the nape of his neck. Draco shuddered.
It was easily past midnight by the time Draco made it to bed. He noticed a half-eaten pasta bowl in the kitchen and he felt marginally better knowing Harry had at least eaten something, even if Draco hadn’t seen him again for the rest of the night.
“Don’t call me that.” He snapped.
“It made that noise again!”
Behind the desk stood a tall, willowy looking witch with a full head of bright orange hair that curled oddly under her ears. She wore big jam jar glasses which clashed with her DMLE robes. She could easily have been an intern.
‘No. Not me. He’s bullying you.’
‘Thank you, Draco. You look wonderfully handsome as always. Pansy my dear, let me take your jacket.’ And off the pair of them went, leaving Draco standing in the hallway. It wasn’t like he needed to be shown the way. He let himself reacquaint himself with his surroundings. The hallway remained warm and open as he remembered. They’d lined the hall with hard wood when the kids were small so that they wouldn’t traipse mud through the house when they’d been playing outside. The coat rack Harry had fixed to the wall lopsidedly was filled with the family’s jackets; it was midsummer so there were no coats this time. Draco had thrown a fit when he’d realised Harry hadn’t put it up straight, but Harry claimed it added charm.
‘Well, I probably gave Harry quite a shock. He’s very good in a crisis, that’s why he’s Head Auror, but it’s different when he’s not at work, he’s not thinking the same way.’ Draco explained more to himself than to Teddy. Teddy wasn’t convinced – he’s particularly switched on for an eleven-year-old.
But today Harry was taking him to Grimmauld Place. Harry couldn’t pinpoint why he was so nervous about their visit; there was every reason for him to visit his godfather, and he was sure Sirius would be happy to help him, but there was still a niggle of guilt in him that he didn’t understand. Perhaps he had forgotten Sirius’ birthday? No, that wasn’t until next month.
‘Of course he will, it’ll just take time,’ Harry reassured him.
Back in his office he decided on a game plan for his departure. He decided to create a giant pin board, like the ones he’d seen on muggle detective shows, and map out all the evidence and theories he had so far, so that anyone who was working on the case after him would know where he was going with it. On the muggle shows, they usually started with the suspects in the middle and worked their way out but since Draco wasn’t still wholly convinced Harry’s prime suspects were part of the case, he decided to start with the victims, and work his way backwards.
‘I have a surprise for you.’ Draco looked up from his journal when Harry entered the library room. It wasn’t really a library, just a room with a comfy sofa, a few bookshelves and Draco’s rare tea collection. Still, Draco was nothing if not pretentious.
There was a high-pitched noise ringing in Draco’s ears and the white blurriness was back. This time, when he blinked, the world came into focus a little better. He looked around him, but it didn’t seem as though he was in the same ward as he had been the last time he was here. Or at least, he didn’t recognise anything. He was relieved to find he hadn’t woken up alone – there was a bored looking Pansy flicking through the over-glossy pages of a magazine, sitting on his right side.
‘I don’t know what I want!’ Draco yelled. He felt as though the whole room stood still. He hadn’t mean to snap like that, he knew Harry was just trying to be helpful, but it was all getting a bit much for him. The look on Harry’s face suggested he knew Draco meant a lot more than he said, but it was too late to take it back now.
She allowed him to watch her for a while. It was strange for the two of them to be content in silence, but he also knew he couldn’t leave Aspen with Ron forever, and each minute he spent here was probably agony for the pair he left at home.
‘Hi! You must be Draco!’ There in front of him stood Leggy-Blonde. She was wearing the skimpiest spaghetti strap top and jean shorts and Draco thought it was highly inappropriate around a child. He’d almost completely forgotten about Harry’s stupid girlfriend with everything that’d happened between him and Harry recently.
‘Harry, I’m so sorry, I-’
‘But that’s supposed to be used for people whose consciousness has been separated from their bodies. That’s not what happened to me at all,’ he protested. She stepped away from the bed he was laying on, finally giving him space to sit up. She was giving him a curious look, as if she didn’t understand why it was such a big deal.
Draco struggled over the next few days to create balance. He was working very hard to maintain the momentum with his little project. He’d decided to write a book of sorts, perhaps more a memoir, of his life from joining the Death Eaters onwards. It had been flowing well since he’d started, but he knew how easy it would be to clam up if he didn’t make himself write a little bit every day. He was fortunate that Teddy was also spending time with his grandmother and with Molly Weasley, although Draco was careful not to palm him off on other people too much. The run up to Christmas was a mad time for Molly who had more grandchildren than she could count now, and Andromeda wasn’t as steady on her feet as she used to be. Besides which, Teddy would be away even longer the next time he went back to Hogwarts, and Draco was doing his best to save up their time together like one of those muggle solar panels Harry had been talking about installing on the roof. Light panels on the roof? Muggles came up with the weirdest inventions.
‘I love your daddy,’ Harry told him with determination. ‘That’s all you need to know for now. Will that do?’ Draco watched Teddy anxiously. Teddy nodded and stared at Draco expectantly.
Thankfully, he’d managed to pass the final two hours of his working day prepping the file to be sent to Macmillan when all the results came through. Although Harry was the lead Auror on the case, the less significant details were being dealt with by Macmillan since Harry already had a lot of other responsibilities. It turned out Draco hadn’t needed to go to such lengths to stay in his office and avoid Harry, as the auror who’d been injured in a raid was Ron, and he hadn’t exactly been following protocol at the time. That meant Harry was more than preoccupied and hadn’t been seen all day. Draco was under the impression Ronald wasn’t really enjoying his role in the auror force, and Draco wouldn’t be surprised if he heard that he’d be leaving soon.
‘Us.’ He agreed, knowing how important it was that Draco knew he was in this too, for the long-haul. All was quiet in the bedroom and Harry thought maybe Draco had drifted off to sleep. In all honesty, Harry wasn’t really very tired, but he’d lie here awake for hours holding Draco like this if it meant Draco could sleep peacefully. He’d do anything for him.
‘Of course we can! We can go tomorrow. You love Kew Gardens, don’t you?’ Harry smiled broadly at him.
Draco flinched violently as Harry’s hand slammed into Wood, ripping him away from him and shoving him against the wall.
“I hate to say it,” Ron said sheepishly, “but I agree with Malfoy. You can’t go alone. This place could be anywhere mate.” Lyra made fake gagging noises at the prospect of her and Ron agreeing on anything.
When he woke up, Harry was gone. He wasn’t surprised, it wasn’t as if he slept an appropriate length of time for an adult his age – his body needed a lot more rest these days. He trudged back into the house, his head heavy and woolly, and went in search for Harry. Downstairs was dark and desolate which was unusual since he’d normally find him cooking at this time. He noticed the decorations he’d brought down from the loft earlier were unpacked from their charms but remained throw haphazardly on the floor. He went upstairs but it was silent. He walked across the landing to the far end of the house where Harry’s study was. They’d had a few arguments over how much time Harry spent in there. He was terrible at leaving his work at the orphanage behind despite the staff he employed.
When Draco finally figured out how to get back to second gear, the grinding noise came again. Except this time, it was much louder and was accompanied by a loud clunk. That was when the heavens opened.
‘Come on Rosie, you can help Mummy out of this silly dress.’ She picked her up from his side and balanced her on her hip.
‘You’ve got to be kidding me. How did you even pull it off?’ Draco asked him before he bit into a cinnamon roll. He held back a moan, knowing it would sound highly inappropriate in front of Teddy. The bar was set incredibly high this year.
‘What?’
‘Who do you suppose they are?’ Harry asked, pointed to the statues which lined the outside of the building.
Draco let his head fall against Harry’s shoulder. ‘If anything like this ever happens again, you tell me, right away, no matter what you think the price might be. I know, it’s rich coming from me, but for fuck’s sake. Look at what we’re doing to each other. When did it come to this? We used to be happy Harry. When did we start making decisions on each other’s behalf and keeping secrets and telling lies?’ He said into Harry’s jumper. Harry’s arms tightened around him just a fraction.
‘Since October? But I moved in October.’ He protested. Surely Harry would’ve told him if he’d been planning on leaving the force.
“I see you’re as dramatic as ever.”
He tried to find Lyra on the tapestry. He followed from Sirius’ burn mark and found his cousins Bellatrix and Narcissa, from there he saw Lucius by name but with no image, then suddenly his gaze was at the empty side of the tapestry. He looked back at Narcissa and drew his eyes along again and it was blank…again. Where was Lyra?
“Pans, you know I love you, but we’re only going to the Ministry. I’m not setting sail for Antarctica.”
‘Really? He never mentioned he was dating anyone. Although, I’m so busy these days with being the department head and the kids are a total handful and- oh no, what if he thinks he can’t tell us these things anymore?’ Draco stared at her.
‘Honestly, Potter. You worry far too much. Get on with it would you?’ Harry shook his head but smiled in amusement and let Draco drag him towards the restaurant. He’d been shocked the first time Harry had brought him here – or more to the point, tried to bring him here. It was a ridiculously fancy place he knew Harry would never frequent given the choice. It spoke volumes that he would dress up to the nines just to bring Draco here. He supposed that’s why that fight had been as bad as it had been. Still, he wasn’t about to make the same mistake again. The waiting list for a table was longer than their marriage.
‘We’re going out.’ Pansy said later that night when Draco’s mood hadn’t lifted all day.
‘It isn’t random and I’m not naked.’ He looked down at the white bandage that was still wrapped tightly around his left arm. He hadn’t removed it yet, only had Harry change the binding for him when it got dirty. He didn’t know why he couldn’t look. He’d had the mark engrained in his skin for two years before it had faded, and it had meant far more back then than it did now. Harry’s had reached around him and snaked over the exact spot he was looking at. He tugged gently and Draco let him guide him back around to face him.
“Potter!” She mocked.
‘Alright.’ And then he was gone.
‘Don’t worry about it. Look, he’s up and about and annoying us as much as ever.’ Harry ruffled Teddy’s hair and Draco scowled at him.
‘Harry what’s wrong?’ Draco was alert and on his feet in seconds. Harry held up a trembling hand to stop him from coming any closer and Draco was beginning to panic.
‘I don't need any more time to think, Harry. I've spent years holing myself up making potions to try and give me my life back. For once I need to do something that might actually make a difference. It's not just about me; it's about about you and Teddy and the kind of life you'll have if I carry on like this. Just let me do this, please. I’m somehow the cause of all of this and I have to see it through. Just be here when I come back.’ Harry didn't look happy. He stared at Draco with his piercing eyes and for a brief moment Draco thought that if this went wrong, and it really was it, it wouldn't be so bad if those eyes were the last sight he ever saw. After a long pause, Harry nodded.
‘Aww, mon amour, qu’est-ce que tu penserais si je t’embrassais?’ He teased.
‘Teddy… Hermione, don’t tell me I-’ He couldn’t finished his sentence. The pain in his chest was excruciating and it had nothing to do with whatever it was that had brought him here.
She frowned. ‘You haven’t been home? Harry wasn’t there when you were discharged?’ He resisted the urge to pinch the bridge of his nose.
Draco wanted the ground to swallow him whole as he saw the woman flirt hopelessly with Harry. She looked remarkably like a female version of Draco. Long blonde platinum hair, tall, slim. Harry couldn’t get more obvious than that. Still, it made Draco’s skin crawl. He knew hanging around after the divorce wouldn’t be a good thing for him. He saw reminders of Harry everywhere; a new broomstick advert, a new Twilfitt and Tattings formal robe advert. Draco had stopped going to Diagon a few months after he’d moved out – desperate not to see Harry’s face everywhere he went.
‘No.’ He admitted. He didn’t know why the gossip was getting to him, he was usually so good at blocking it out.
“Shit.” Harry let his head hit the headrest as he blew out a slow breath, trying to calm his rapidly beating heart. “The clutch is absolutely fucked.” Suddenly, Draco was undoing his seatbelt and launching himself out of the car and into the rain. Although you weren’t supposed to stay inside a broken-down car, Harry didn’t want him to catch a cold.
‘Harry we can’t! I’ve already heard Teddy this morning. I couldn’t live with myself if he saw anything.’ Harry didn’t answer him at first, just kissed him to shut him up. It was really hard to say no to that.
“I can’t promise that.” He said eventually.
‘Spungen brought food up a few minutes ago. He said eating would help settle you.’ Draco nodded into Harry’s neck but didn’t give any indication of moving otherwise. ‘Come on Draco. I know you don’t want to but if you won’t do it for you, at least do it for me.’ He sighed. He was warm and comfortable and if he stayed here unmoving, he wouldn’t have to face life. Why couldn’t Harry let him ignore everything? Just for a little while…
‘I see you’ve been trampled by hippogriffs before.’ Draco shot back, and the healer smiled widely.
‘I don’t care about the bathroom, Draco. Bathrooms can be fixed and replaced.’ He turned back to his paperwork. Draco sighed. Harry had been distant with him ever since he’d returned from Hermione’s. In his defence, he’d been back in his old flat a lot since he’d spoken to Hermione.
‘I really like him. I have friends in all the houses, but we don’t get to spend as much time with each other.’ Harry started asking Teddy about quidditch – he’d been keen to get him interested in the sport since he was tiny. He’d told Draco he bought Teddy a toy broomstick for his first birthday because Sirius had done the same for him. He could be really sweet like that. Teddy liked quidditch, but Draco couldn’t see him being much of a player himself – although he did always join in with a family game at the Weasley’s.
‘Goodnight, Draco.’
‘I was thinking wizard actually. I heard about a new French place that opened on Diagon when I was at St Mungo’s.’ He watched Harry’s face carefully for his reaction. There wasn’t so much as a twitch anywhere on his face and Draco began to think he’d said something stupid. Of course Harry wouldn’t want to go out. He’d been at the orphanage all day working hard and then he’d come home, and Draco had slept while he cried. It wasn’t exactly a great set up for an impromptu date night.
He turned, his shirt still clutched in his hand and found Harry standing there with his wand pointing right at Draco’s naked chest. Draco dropped the photo which smashed and scatter glass everywhere, a shard of which bounced off the floor and wedged itself in Draco’s forearm as he tried to catch the frame before it hit the floor.
‘You’re such a git! You know that?’ He thumped him on the other arm and secretly hoped he’d be sporting matching bruises.
‘Wait, Leggy-Blonde it a muggle? How did she not notice when Teddy’s hair randomly changes colour?’ Draco couldn’t help but interject. They were totally off topic, but he needed to know.
‘Draco, you’re being ridiculous.’ Pansy sighed through the floo. She was used to Draco’s small fits over Harry.
She smiled before she disappeared up the stairs.
He felt like he’d been taken for a ride. Had Harry been disappearing off to see Wood this whole time? Had he been lying to him? What if he hadn’t and he really did love Draco as much as he said he did? That would still mean he took him in out of pity, not because he wanted him. Surely Wood wouldn’t have stood for it if his boyfriend had brought his ex-husband back to care for him. Draco certainly wouldn’t have. Then again, if Harry had lied to Draco, maybe he’d lied to Wood too. Draco didn’t like Wood. Of course, he’d become a competent professional quidditch player, but there had always been something off balance about him. He was as much about the social climb as he was about the climb to the top of his profession.
As a result, his relationship with Harry had gone from strength to strength, and on the anniversary of Draco’s return home, they went to the chateau for a quiet trip away. It was the first time in a long time they’d had any time to themselves – the orphanage was finally running the way it was supposed to – the muggle social services fully incorporated with the magical. Draco’s memoir, with significant editing, had been picked up by a publisher and was in the process of being printed. Thankfully, as soon as news broke that Draco was being published, it wasn’t long until it became obvious he was back with Harry. Wood had been quiet since then, although Draco expected he may be plotting some kind of public display of desperation. Not that it mattered, he would only ruin his own reputation even further. Either way, they had been incredibly busy putting their lives back together.
He passed Hermione again in the tiny little hallway and she caught his arm as she passed.
Harry never caught the look on Sirius’ face, because it occurred to him in that moment to search the tapestry for something else. He looked back at Narcissa and followed the silvery branches one more time, but instead of thinking of Lyra, he thought of the man in the arch who looked just like her.
someone
‘So, what if each of these ‘victims’ were targeted through their connections to the clinic. They didn’t have to be patients. They just had to be friends or family of patients or a relative of someone who works there. If they were exposed to aconite and valerian in the same dose, in theory there could be a targeted memory loss which would make them forget taking anything, but not forget the ill effects.’ Draco explained. He glanced at Harry, excited to be finally cracking the case wide open.
“Come on. There’s nothing for you in here.” Harry wasn’t known for his rational decision making, so he scooped the fox up like it was a puppy and made to carry it to the kitchen. It started snapping its jaws at him and he was convinced, as he walked down the hallway, that he was going to have his arm bitten off. He refused to let go though, so he ran his finger very carefully between the fox’s ears. Immediately the fox was quiet. Both ears returned to their regular position and as if a switch had been flicked the fox settled in his arms.
‘But why do you write it all down when you don’t tell me.’
‘What was what?’
He had tried his best to talk Potter out of his terrible plan, but he wouldn’t hear a word of it.
“Right. So where exactly should we- woah- wa- hm, um,” Harry’s sentence descends into incoherent babbling when he turns to see Malfoy rolling the sleeves of his shirt up. His forearms are as pale as the rest of him but seem indecently powerful. His veins are raised with the warm weather and they run down the length of his arms to where they narrow into delicately thin wrists and long hands.
‘Wood.’ He finished for him. Draco nodded and bit his lip to keep himself from saying anything else. Teddy decided he wanted to go to the Japanese Gateway which afforded them some time to talk but Draco didn’t really want to, he'd talked enough already. He'd had time to think about Harry's situation with Wood and now he felt a little shame faced that he was so quick to accuse Harry of having an affair when in reality he’d been nothing but loyal to him.
She sighed and shook her head. “It’s hard on me too. I miss him.”
‘He nearly died, didn’t he?’ It was really more a statement than a question, and one loaded with much more understanding than one would ever expect from an eleven-year-old.
“Sirius, please,” he begged, “I wouldn’t ask if it wasn’t important.” Harry had no idea why it mattered to him so much except that there had to be a reason
‘Nope. Don’t worry about it now.’ Draco reassured him.
Saturday 9
If someone had told me at the beginning of the year that I'd have written well over 200k of fic by now, I'd have called them mad. It just goes to show!
‘You don’t need to explain, Draco. We both made mistakes, we both went about things the wrong way. We can’t take any of it back, but I promise if you give me another chance, I’ll never be oblivious to your suffering again. I don’t care if it takes years, I’m completely and utterly in love with you and I’ll do anything. There’s been no one since you. No one even came remotely close.’ Draco could tell from the determination in Harry’s eyes that he was telling him the truth.
‘I wouldn’t dream of letting anyone else do it,’ he smiled
But he also knew that the Ministry couldn’t always be trusted to do the right thing. It was also inundated with the extra workload that had built up during and after the war. How did he know the fox wouldn’t just be abandoned for more important things?
Blaise gave him a look. He was lounging on the chaise longue with his ridiculously shiny shoes and Italian fitted robes like he owned the place. “You might want to do something with…” He waved his hand lazily in the direction of Draco’s head. He froze.
Draco was twelve the first time he realised he had a crush on Harry Potter. The whole of his first year he had spent in a rage at the audacity of Potter to reject his friendship. He had raged to his friends, his father, his mother, the elves, anyone who would listen, until eventually no one would take any more. It was at that point, when Draco was forced to keep his hurt feelings to himself, that he started to realise what had really happened. Although too young to understand half of the words he parroted from his father, he was astute enough to recognise that he had been rude. If he had only taken the time to calmly explain the situation to Potter, he could have made him understand.
Draco’s fingers made their way to Harry’s hair the way they always did. It was getting just a little too long again but that hardly mattered right now. Harry broke the kiss so that he could kiss Draco’s jaw and neck. He automatically moved his head to the side to give him better access.
He kept his eyes closed for a few seconds after he arrived as he let the world level off. An arm wrapped round his waist from his right side and he prayed it was Harry when someone else took the gift bag from his left side. He opened his eyes slowly when he stopped feeling like the world was tilting sideways and found Harry regarding him closely. He gave him a nod to tell him he was alright when suddenly he had armfuls of a short, middle-aged woman.
‘Ok fine,’ she said as she finished her pasta, ‘but if this whole thing blows up in your face, don’t come crying to me.’
?’ Harry asked him curiously. Draco shrugged.
‘Yep. The less important ones. I moved the others back to the house.’
Harry stares at him in disbelief until he realises that Malfoy is in fact joking. The eruption of laughter in a little more violent than the subtle joke warrants but once Harry has started, he sets Malfoy off too. Each time one of them manages to control the laughter the other one starts up again and so the vicious cycle goes. When their sides hurt too much to countenance even a single ‘ha’, they lapse back into silence and Malfoy goes back to his work.
Now the question was how to get them both home…
For the most part, however, Draco was terrified for Harry. It was entirely possible that Draco had actually broken him. He looked like a kicked puppy most of the time and it was eating him alive to see it. Draco had studiously avoided him as he tried to get his head around everything that had happened. Why hadn’t he seen that Wood had been blackmailing Harry? He never thought Harry so capable of keeping things hidden, not the way Draco had been accustomed to. Then again, Harry had kept who knows how many of Dumbledore’s secrets back in the day, and as Head Auror he probably knew far more than he ever let on.
It wasn’t until he’d brought the box into the living room that he realised the whole endeavour had been a waste of time. The decorations were stored under a shrinking charm so that they’d take up less storage space and since Draco couldn’t practice magic, he had no way of actually putting them up. He considered going to buy a tree, but that would involve more floo travel and he wasn’t sure he was up for that either.
‘I know and I appreciate the sentiment, but I have an alternative I think you’ll like.’
‘Can I help you?’ Draco was taken aback when he looked up from the broom to find Oliver Wood standing in front of him.
With hindsight, it was a stupid thing to do when he was tired. Even worse when he was home alone, but Teddy was coming home soon, and Draco wouldn’t have him come back to a bland house. He went out to the shed in the garden and pulled out a set of step ladders. They’d had a loft conversion done six months after they’d moved into the house but had never gotten around to installing a sturdy ladder up.
‘Take me home, Harry.’ His stomach swooped as Harry did as he asked.
employee and if I feel the need to speak to you I’ll damn well do so. How do I know that this addiction isn’t affecting your performance?’ Draco knew Harry was right but he was not going to be pushed around by him.
It almost made him smile to picture the look on his father’s face if he could see that Draco was bringing Granger into his private library. Except of course, if his father were to find out he wouldn’t have any look on his face because there was nothing of him left but the empty cavern of his body.
‘Actually, I asked you what you would think if I kissed you,’ he admitted. Harry’s face practically lit up.
Getting the ladder into the house and up the stairs was trouble enough, so once he’d made it up the last step, he went to take a dose of Vitamix to restore his energy. The warmth that spread through his system as the potion took effect nearly made him giggle, but he checked himself.
was engraved.
‘Do you?’ Harry pulled away and looked at him with red-rimmed eyes. Draco stomach plummeted to the floor.
‘Good as new.’ Harry said with a smile. An awkward silence descended as they both seemed to realise the situation they were in.
who introduced himself as a lawyer from the firm Granger worked for. He explained the situation to Draco in six short but succinct lines of text which said that even if it could be proven that Draco had been trying to help, it would do nothing to undo the house arrest violation. None of this was new to him, although there was a second letter folded within the first, one that Granger had sneaked in and which was of greater interest to Draco:
The garden was as beautiful as the day he’d left it. There was a wash of the most vibrant colours; the deep oranges of black-eyed Susans against the bright fuchsia of Dahlias phasing into pale pink ribbons of roses. Draco had always taken great pride in his garden; the gardens of the manor were his favourite places to be as a child and he’d aimed to recreate them here. Coupled with his love of potions and therefore potions ingredients, he’d found himself to be quite a proficient gardener.
Orion’s eyes widen. “Oh.
‘Thank you. Didn’t Pansy say she wanted me to work with her? I don’t know if I can do all of that. I still get so tired…’
They were sat in a small interview room with a pathetic excuse for a window of charmed daylight, the first Draco had seen in days. It was actually giving him a headache, but he said nothing. The interview room was one of the most boring rooms he’d ever sat in, and probably for good reason. The entire room was varying shades of grey; grey walls, grey floors, grey table, grey chairs. He imagined this would be the place creativity went to die.
‘Exactly.’ Kingsley was watching him carefully, waiting for an outburst. Draco maintained his calm again.
‘What did he swipe?’ Draco’s tone was far too even. He could hear his father’s frosty detachment in it but there was nothing he could do.
‘Wait!’ A high-pitched squeal came from behind him and he turned to find Ella running to catch up with him, dragging a confused looking Johnny along by the hand.
Thankfully she had a small sofa in her office and they could sit down, as Draco didn’t think he could stomach having to look at her.
Draco had justified not telling Harry the truth with the idea that Harry couldn’t love him as much as Draco loved Harry, but all he’d done was make Harry think Draco didn’t love him at all. He’d pushed him away, he’d made Harry feel like Draco didn’t want to be with him. Harry thought Draco acted strangely when they went out because Draco was ashamed of him. That couldn’t have been further from the truth.
‘I’m fine, love. It’s just a lot. I’ll be fine in a minute.’ Harry kissed him softly, his worry almost radiating off him.
He climbed into the bed between the two of them. He curled up against Harry’s back and despite Draco’s usual insecurity, he was quite grateful he’d gone to Harry that morning. He’d been up very late wrapping presents and choosing how he was going to fill the vials for Harry. He still needed far more sleep than usual, and he needed a little longer. Plus, Harry had been working so hard lately that he hadn’t had much time with Ted.
“Thank you.”
Harry kissed him on the cheek. ‘I’m humbled by your generosity as always.’ He said solemnly. Draco was about to use some rather fruitful language to tell him where he could shove his sarcasm when Teddy burst through the door.
“What? You know why. I don’t see how that’s relevant.” Harry’s stomach clenched with unease.
‘It’s nice to be awake.’ His voice was croaky from lack of use and it caused him to cough quite loudly, only exacerbating his pain. It didn’t wake Harry though. Draco was unbelievably annoyed that he hadn’t escaped their awkward dalliance a few months ago, yet Harry could sleep through this.
‘You can tell me all about how gross kissing is when you help me get your trunk upstairs because I think it’s time you went to bed, you’ve had a long day and we’ve sprung a lot on you.’ Draco glanced at his watch – just after ten.
“Oh no. Please tell me he didn’t. Even he’s not that stupid.” Draco was worried Granger might cry. He didn’t really do crying.
“I’m sorry. What exactly are you doing here?” Her eyes flashed at his rudeness, but she ignored it.
‘Maybe you can get one when you’re older,’ he suggested with a smile.
He nearly coughed up a lung when he arrived in his flat as he accidently inhaled some floo powder on his way. Typical. He looked around the dingy little rooms and realised for the first time that he’d let himself make a mess of the place. He’d only really been sitting at the table writing most of the time he was here – it didn’t seem important to tidy up.
‘Did someone order a professional book reader?’ He teased when she didn’t notice him enter. As he approached, he noticed her chocolate brown curls were getting so long she was nearly sitting on them. He knew exactly what he would get her for Christmas. With permission of course.
‘Oh, didn’t I? We’ve been through this Harry, so many times. Sure, I didn’t kill anyone, but that doesn’t mean I don’t have blood on my hands. We can talk ourselves around in circles but what’s done is done.’
Draco felt a little queasy as he looked at his altered appearance in the mirror. He’d Polyjuiced as one of the interns; a dark-haired, brown-eyed seventeen-year-old with non-existent cheekbones and an odd scar to the left of his mouth.
He curled his hands under his chin as he took in Harry’s sleeping form. His skin – aside from the famous scar – really was flawless, although Draco knew full well he didn’t even try to look after it. He’d shaved whilst Draco had been in hospital, and with it he’d shaved a couple of years off his age. It was odd really, since he reminded Draco so much of the boy wonder he’d been at school and yet looked totally different. He supposed he would never be able to look at Harry now without seeing their life together.
“Hm?” Draco snapped back to the reality of breakfast with Pansy.
Forget about the war, Thursday 1
He couldn’t.
“I’m sorry, that was a dumb thing to say. But you know, he only missed the portkey. It’s not like he was in any danger when I-”
“This is Harry’s invisibility cloak. I took it from his house before the Ministry did their search. They’re very rare and I know for a fact Robards – he’s Head Auror – has been trying to get his hands on it for years. We’ll cover Harry in it to get him out. Even without it, he’s a professional sneak.” There was a wistful smile on her face and it pained Draco that all those headlines he had read about what had happened to Potter never once mentioned the people who really know him, who were truly hurt by his disappearance, not just the adoring fans who missed his charming smile and his outrageous hair.
’ Teddy didn’t like that very much, he half climbed over Draco to give him a bear hug, even though he was far too big for that.
‘Did you fall into an Austen novel while I wasn’t looking?’
"Hermione it's Malfoy!" Ron snaps quietly, and Hermione sighs when he turns to face Professor McGonagall. She gets why Ron and everyone else is so upset but it's not Harry's fault he's sad. The second transfiguration ends Hermione makes her way to the hospital wing alone.
"And now we're more than that." Draco says, trying to remain indifferent but not able to keep the smile off his face.
"Try not to be ignorant arseholes. It ain't right." Harry says before stepping away from the group and walking back over to Draco and Hermione.
"Do you?" He whispers, and Draco rolls his eyes, a small smile on his face.
"You nervous for everyone to find out it's you?"
"You okay?" Harry asks softly and Draco nods, blushing slightly.
Harry is visibly nervous when they appear outside the Zabini house. Narcissa offers him a warm smile and squeezes his arm, and Draco grabs his hand. Harry returns Naricssa's smile before turning to Draco, who also looks nervous.
"I think there's some money in there." He says before leaving his left arm behind his head, bent at the elbow and lying right next to Draco's thigh.
"You know you have a crush on him, why are you confused?" She whispers, not wanting anyone else to hear. Harry pulls his gaze from Malfoy and looks at Hermione.
He can't.
"You don't have to worry about that either. We both know my father hates you, not that his opinion matters, but mother likes you." He says and Harry raises an eyebrow, sitting up.
"No. But I've never done it on 5 people at once when I'm in the middle of an emotional breakdown before." Harry mutters, his words slurred.
"No." Harry says sadly.
"Have a think about where, you can figure out how often later. And he's been security checked and everything will be confidential. He has family members who are wizards, however he himself is a muggle, meaning he is not aware of what happened in full but he is aware of who you are and you will be able to talk to him about magic." Harry nods.
"Are you sure that's smart?"
"Loving people hurts. I know. He told me. And I get it, but he's also so much
"Well I don't really like talking about how I fucking died, Seamus!" Harry snaps just as Blaise, Pansy and Draco walk past, and they definitely heard him. Blaise walks straight over and looks between Seamus and Harry a few times before seeing the look on Harry's face. He's angry and sad and tired and he needs to calm down.
"It's not a competition." Draco mutters.
"It seems Andromeda is unwell and cannot currently look after young Mr Lupin. It's nothing to worry about but he will need to stay here at Hogwarts with you until she is better as you are his only other guardian." McGonagall says.
"Why do you know how to use legilimency?"
"That smells good, what is that?" Blaise asks, having been working quietly next to him.
"Nothing I just- It's nothing."
"I can try but I'm not making any promises." He says, his voice showing his nerves, and after a second Harry grabs Draco's arm and pulls him closer so that Draco is pressed against Harry's back whilst Harry just grips his arm tight. Draco's shocked at first. The only times they've ever made contact since being made roommates at the beginning of 8th year was when they were fighting, and they haven't said anything but insults to each other. Draco debates pulling himself away from Harry, calling him a name and taking the piss out of him for crying; but Draco knows all too well how much the war fucked him up, he can hear him crying at night when Harry thinks Draco's asleep or he hears him having nightmares or waking up with a gasp or a chocked sob when he has particularly bad dreams and Draco always wants to hug him until he's better. Now he has the chance. Draco gets the impression Harry doesn't have anyone to tell him it will be okay, he's always the supportive one, not the one being comforted, and Draco likes the idea of being that person for Harry. So instead of pulling away he just sits behind Harry, pulls them both down so he's spooning him and wraps his arms around him, burying his head into Harry's neck. He lets Harry cry like he obviously needs to and holds him tight.
"The dog constellation. My godfather was named after the brightest star in Canis Major." He says, still with his back to Draco. Draco stares at the Draco constellation and secretly hopes that this one is because of him, although he knows deep down Harry wouldn't get a tattoo for him.
"I'm going to kill that Ravenclaw prick."
"Really? I have to wait til dinner to find out who it is that took my fuck buddy away?" Seamus asks, pouting. Harry chuckles and leans close to his ear.
"We have one." Harry winks at her and she grimaces.
"Harry James Potter you are clueless." She says as she sits next to him. Harry looks at her in confusion and slight annoyance.
When he's sure the girls are far away enough he slips into the next hallway and sprints up to the floor above, the seventh floor, and begins pacing in front of a seemingly blank wall.
"Oh and I am?" Harry scoffs.
Couple of things...
"Mister Potter sir. Winky thought you'd need breakfast." Winky says as Harry sits at his usual spot at the table. He looks at the food on the plate and grimaces. The thought of eating anything makes him feel sick, and he really doesn't want to eat.
"Are you okay?" Harry frowns before sighing and shaking his head.
"How d'you fancy a trip to Hogsmeade?" Harry asks smiling slightly.
"I hope so." He says before looking over at Harry. "What's up?" He asks, noticing the look on Harrys face.
Harry and Draco hold hands as Draco leads them around the manor, and Harry can't help but look at every picture on the wall. It's homey now, nothing like the cold manor he was in before, and Harry watches Draco talk, smiles at how happy he seems now. He's not tense like he used to be. He jokes with his mother and he walks the halls slowly, calmly, rather than standing straight and stiff. Harry gets it, though. Gets why Draco was tense before. Having Voldemort in your house is not ideal, for anyone. And being forced to be on his side when you don't want to be is also not ideal.
"He's probably busy, has a big family. Don't worry about it now, we have a party to go to." Harry says, looking like he's not looking forward to it but also like he really doesn't want to talk about Ron and his other friends. Draco nods, smiles slightly as he presses a soft kiss to Harry's lips.
"Like this?" Harry asks, leaning his face close to Draco's like how he did with Seamus earlier.
"No worries, 'Arry." Hagrid pats his shoulder once before seeing Harry out of his hut, and Harry feels a little bit better for talking to him.
"I am not pretty. I'm hot." Draco says and Harry chuckles.
"We can go hide in my room? Father said I have to stay down here for at least an hour but after that?" Blaise offers and Draco nods.
"What?" He was expecting Weasley to tell him to leave Harry alone. He wasn't expecting this.
It looks like he began to write the word incendio before putting a neat line through it. Harry watches Malfoy for a few more seconds before deciding if Malfoy can help him with potions then he can help Malfoy with DADA.
"You don't have to watch me play, but don't pretend you don't love it." Harry jokes, leaning back against the stairs behind him, watching as Draco turns pink but stays silent.
"Because I know you, Draco. I know there are a lot of things you'd love to do to me. But cursing isn't one of them." Harry summons every last bit of Gryffindor courage as he says this, because honestly he could be completely wrong. Draco gives in and grabs Harry's waist.
"Let's take them to our dorm so we don't disturb McGonagall." Harry says, he knows once he watches one he'll want to watch them all, at least 5 times over. Draco agrees so Harry closes the case and casts a wandless, silent charm to make the case and the pensive float ahead of them. They walk to their dorm without being interrupted, its nearly midnight now so everyone's in bed, and Harry places the case on his trunk and lets the pensive float in the middle of the room.
"Because I can't look at Ron without seeing Fred. I can't look at Hermione without remembering what Bellatrix did to her because of me. You remind me of what happened. And who we lost because of me. I can't- I'm not- I can't." Harry says before he walks out of the greenhouse and over to greenhouse 6. He walks straight to the back corner and sits down, not bothering to see where anyone is sat, he just keeps his head down, pulling his sleeves over his hands in a lame attempt to stop them shaking. Seamus walks in and sits down silently, not knowing how to tell the others what Harry said. No wonder he hasn't spoken to them. How did no one realise what he was going through?
”How do I look?” She asks, hands on her hips and arching her back slightly.
"Have a seat, Potter." McGonagall says and Harry sits in the chair next to Draco, slouching slightly which makes Draco roll his eyes.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Now if you will please practice a few times on your own, I will be back shortly." She walks to the back of the class, towards Harry, and the class watch her before turning back to their work.
"Oh, well if it's any consolation Harry is like a million times better. I mean, smarter, funnier, definitely hotter-" Blaise is cut off by Draco.
"So what else should we do whilst we're here?" Harry asks.
"Thanks Granger." Draco calls after her and she turns to smile before continuing.
"Which means my godson is your second cousin or something." Harry says and Draco looks up at him, confused.
"Sometimes I laugh and I smile and I mean it. Sometimes I feel what I think is happy, and..."
"Whatever, Malfoy." Harry mutters, taking a step away from him and walking towards the door, but Draco grabs Harry's hand before he can reach the door handle.
"I love you."
They don't say much more. They talk about what they need to do during the lesson, and Blaise makes small talk that Harry doesn't have the energy to make into actual conversation, but Blaise understands and doesn't force him to. After potions Harry decides to go for a walk since he doesn't have another class until after lunch. He would go jogging, but he's in jeans, so he leaves the castle and walks around the grounds.
"They were close." McGonagall says and Draco nods.
"But mainly me?" Harry smirks, noticing Dracos blush.
"We should get going." She says and Harry and Draco agree so they start the walk to Hogsmeade together, Harry walking in between the other two and occasionally brushing his hand against Draco's subtly so it looks like an accident because Draco hasn't been to Hogsmeade since before the war and he really doesn't want to be here.
"Alright what happened yesterday?" Hermione asks when Harry gets to breakfast the next day and he looks up from staring at his bowl of cereal, Teddy is sat on Ginny's lap and Harry can hear Seamus and Dean talking to some Ravenclaws on the table next to them about the rules of the tattoo pool. Harry figured they were the ones to start it.
"I don't follow." Draco is very confused now.
"Hey." Draco says, pretending he didn't hear the conversation between Harry and George.
"Why do you need that? And where did you get it?" Draco asks and Harry smirks.
"Yeah, er..." Harry thinks for a second before smiling slightly. He starts strumming a few chords and Draco watches his face as he seems to relax.
"Harry! You look wonderful!" Narcissa smiles in greeting, pulling Harry into a hug, and Harry forces a smile at her. She looks amazing, in a very fancy and definitely expensive dress, and her hair and makeup look immaculate. Harry probably looks like shit in comparison.
"It wont." Harry sounds like he genuinely doesn't think it will and Blaise wishes Harry could see how much Draco loves him.
"You still smell like fire whisky." Draco mutters against Harrys neck.
"Alright fine but I'm not happy about it." Draco mumbles and Harry grins because sleepy Draco is adorable.
"I'm gonna need you not to be a prat for once." He mumbles and Draco doesn't really know what to do so he just moves slightly closer to Harry's side.
"When did you stop?" Draco asks.
"I've got you." Draco whispers into Harry's hair and Harry's hand slides down from his wrist to his hand and grips it desperately, as if he's worried if he loosens his grip Draco will leave.
Harry sees Ron and Hermione entering the great hall and decides he can join them now. Harry quickly looks himself over in the mirror to see if he looks as shit as he feels. He's wearing some skinny fit grey joggers and a plain white t-shirt as he couldn't be bothered with his usual skinny jeans this morning. His hair is a mess as usual and it sticks out all over the place and Harry makes sure it covers his scar, which just brings more attention and staring, before looking the rest of himself over. He looks tired, as usual; He has nightmares every night and never gets more than a few hours sleep at most. He makes his way to the hall as fast as he can without full on running and slow down as he enters the hall, Hermione automatically catches his eye and a look of relief flashes across her face.
"Yeah?"
Harry isn't entirely sure how long he spends crying in the forbidden forest. All he knows is that it's dark and there's no one around. Also it's cold. Really cold. Fucking freezing. Harry hadn't realised how cold he was until he stood up and tried to walk back to the castle. His teeth are chattering and his entire body is covered in goosebumps. He rushes back to the castle and goes straight to the kitchen.
"Not the fifth one. Not sure I could deal with that." Harry says, sparing a glance at Draco who smells one of his potions and immediately looks at Harry. Harry looks back at the list and presses his lips together, wondering if everyone has the same 7 potions.
Harry slides his hands down to Draco's waistband and untucks his shirt before sliding his hands under the fabric and moving them up Draco's back, feeling every scar and bone and muscle as he moves back to kissing him. Draco's hands are tugging and threading and gripping at Harry's hair and he high key loves it. Draco kisses across Harrys jaw and to his ear.
Draco shrugs again.
"And it would be so funny to see the look on their faces when you walk in with Golden Boy Potter on your arm."
"Blaise, he looks after me too." Harry says and Blaise smiles back at him.
"However if you and Mr. Zabini are wanting to spend time together as you are now friends then by happy coincidence you will also have to spend more time with Mr. Malfoy."
“Hey, Draco.” He calls softly, rubbing Draco’s side where his hand was resting, and Hermione almost squeals because they’re so cute and Harry is the sweetest thing and she’s so proud.
"You're a great captain. But seriously, thank you, I owe you one." He says and Harry shrugs.
"It's okay, Harry." He leans up and hovers with his face above Harrys and brushes their lips together. Harry wraps his arms around Dracos waist and rolls them over so he's on top. He kisses Draco on the lips once before moving down his body, kissing over the scars scattered across his torso, his eyes filling with tears.
"Hey." He says and George looks him up and down before smirking.
When he gets to his dorm room he walks over to his bed and sighs, flomping down onto it. He sits on his bed and finishes the essays he was given as homework before sighing. He falls onto his back before rolling onto his side and he looks at his bed side table for a second before sitting up and opening the draw, pulling out a notebook and opening it. He shuffles back so he's sat against his headboard and starts to read through it, feeling the need to feel the pain all over again. In the notebook is a list. One long list of every shit thing that's ever happened to him. Hermione once said years ago that writing things down helps you get over them. it's not true. He just has physical proof that they happened.
"It is best if we leave him to rest for today, but hopefully he will be in his classes tomorrow so you will see him them." Draco and Blaise aren't happy about it, but they both want Harry to get better so they agree to leave him be for today before making their way to their next class.
"What's the password for Slytherin?" He asks just as Harry collapses on the sofa.
"So you have other tattoos?" He questions, asking Harry without actually asking to show him them.
