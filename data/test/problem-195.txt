“I feel like I still had so much to learn from him. I wish I could have told him I loved him, one last time.” Draco said, placing his chin on his crossed arms.
He took a deep, calming breath, and with one last look around his study, Severus started concentrating on his destination. That was when he remembered, with heart-wrenching pain, that Lucius was lying on the couch in his sitting room. He couldn’t leave him behind. It would destroy Draco and Narcissa, and if he was honest, probably himself, too.
Meemy said nothing, but instead answered by grabbing Harry’s shoulder and apparating him into the study, where she helped him settle into the chair. With a snap of her fingers, there was a roaring fire in the fireplace.
Harry was turning the corner to go into the kitchen and suddenly found himself face to face with Narcissa Malfoy. They stared at each other for a moment until Harry felt the need to break the ice.
It was going to be a while before they were out of the shower, but Draco couldn’t bring himself to care.
Dumbledore stepped closer to Harry. “That’s simple enough, my boy. They need refuge; peace and quiet while they mourn their loss. Your home would be the perfect place for that. I would offer them a place at Hogwarts, but I don’t wish to subject them to the Aurors that would surely demand they be released to them.” Dumbledore said.
He had done his best to stop the bleeding, but he knew that he was in serious trouble. The headache, dizziness, and cold sweat that he was experiencing told him that, but he could do nothing besides keep moving.
“As for why you want to wear it so badly... Well, the magic in the ring is most likely enticing you. There are no others that would be more suited to it than you, the last of the Potter line. And it has not been worn, least of all by a Potter family member, in 16 years. I dare say that it
“Headmaster? I was about to send my Patronus to alert you I was coming with… guests. What are you doing here?” Severus asked, unable to keep all of the demand out of his voice.
He quickly diverted his attention to the fireplace and re-set the Floo connection so that only a select few people could come through. He guessed that the Dark Lord had heard where he was going, and he didn’t want to leave him an easy way in.
Harry wasted no time in running out of the diner to face the death eaters, and was surprised to see that his quick thinking had worked. One of the death eaters had been crushed under what used to be the front of the establishment, and the other two were too stunned from the blast to instantly attack him. Harry immediately capitalized on their disorientation, running for the end of the street, firing off spells behind him.
A nod of confirmation was all Harry gave, and quickly sat up, rubbing the sleep from his eyes as he did so. After a sharp turn sent a bed cascading into his, Harry decided to wait for the bus to come to a banging stop before he even thought about trying to retrieve his trunk, and instead allowed his mind to wander.
“Thanks, Remus. You’re right… I was hoping that they would have something in there. I suppose it was foolish to hope for it, though. Why would they have thought about getting portraits done when they were so young, just starting their life. Ugh. I need some air. Honestly though, thank you for letting me know. You stopped me from making a fool of myself in front of everyone.” Harry said.
“Excellent.” Dumbledore said, clapping his hands once. “We need to decide on a Secret Keeper, Harry. You must understand that your parents would not put their trust in me, and instead chose to do something that led to their downfall. I am strongly recommending that you do not make the same mistake.”
extreme, just enough to break a sweat and get your heart rate up. This will help increase your stamina and I think this should be the next area we really focus on. I’m satisfied that your reflexes have improved to an acceptable level, but we shouldn’t stop working to improve even further. It would not do to face the Dark Lord underprepared.
!” Harry yelled, wand pointed over his shoulder and aimed at the first death eater that had started to rise. He didn’t wait to see if it made contact, but took satisfaction from the scream of frustration of what he hoped was the only remaining death eater.
He looked at Severus, trying to prepare for the next spell, but he was too slow. Severus had disarmed him with a flick of his wand, and with another flick, had hit him with a mild Stinging Hex. Harry winced as he shook the pain out of his arm, and stood to face his professor.
Harry quickly bounded off the bed, heading for the loo. He stopped short when he walked into his father’s closet, noticing that it smelled faintly of dark, musky patchouli. He inhaled the slightly intoxicating scent for a moment before pressing through the wardrobe, locating the bathroom directly through the next door. He looked around, stunned at the massive bathroom. He observed the huge, detached bathtub, and a stone-tiled shower that could easily fit 6 people. The bathroom was set in a sharp white color, with ebony cabinets, and beautiful, grey ceramic tiles on the floor. Harry stood looking for a moment, stunned by how well designed it was.
Snape went over to Narcissa and Draco, stooping down to help pick the distraught boy up and bring him into the safety of the manor. They crossed the wards effortlessly, and Harry was aware that he could now feel their presence in his head. It wasn’t invasive, it was just…
“Yes. And I trust you to go slow, even if I’m not.” He replied, and Harry nodded his head in agreement.
. He carried him past the threshold and carefully placed him in the chair that sat to the far left corner of the room. Spinning around, he was momentarily lost in the memories that this place held.
“Meemy was being told by mister Snape that you is needing to eat and take your potion. Would Master Harry like me to bring it up?” Meemy asked.
He took a deep breath and opened the next present, this one from Severus. It was a long, thin box, and Harry looked at Severus questioningly when he saw what was inside.
Severus stared at the spot where they disappeared, trying to control his emotions. He knew that now was not the time to criticize the way Dumbledore handled things. He would go with the flow… for now.
In his room, Harry pulled off his shirt and tossed it to the corner of the room, grabbing a soft brown shirt on his way to the bathroom, stopping to lightly spritz his chest and neck with the cologne Draco had bought him for his birthday and for a moment, could almost see his father doing the same thing. He allowed a small smile to spread before continuing into the bathroom to wash his face, pulling the shirt over his head when he was done and leaving the room.
! I think about it all the time, and it doesn’t help!” Harry finished, tears streaming down his face.
“Whatever the situation was, Harry, I truly don’t mind. I just wanted to give you forewarning. I appreciate you being there for him since… well, he hasn’t said anything to me about it.” She said.
Severus was about to speak, but at that moment, there was a large bang, followed by what sounded like all of the air rushing from the room. He looked at Dumbledore and tried to express that his wards had only seconds before failing. It appeared that the headmaster didn’t need the warning, because he was already springing into action.
They started slowly, both feeling the nerves and excitement at crossing over into new territory. Harry positioned himself behind Draco and started kissing and sucking on his neck, one hand on his hip, the other snaking around to wrap around his straining erection. Draco didn’t even try to hold back the moan he uttered as Harry stroked him off. He lost track of time, enjoying the embrace and feeling of Harry touching him, but he was close to the edge and felt the need to warn Harry.
Harry entered and crossed the room, choosing to sit on the foot of the bed rather than the chair that he had occupied a few days prior. Draco followed him and took a spot near the pillows.
” He watched as the memories Vernon valued most started to wither and turn to black, almost as if a cancer had spread to them. Only when Severus was satisfied that the curse had taken a hold did he end the spell that allowed him to view Vernon’s memories.
“For you, pup, there isn’t a whole lot I wouldn’t do.” Remus said, giving him a small smile. “What do you say we get back to Severus and Mr. Malfoy, before they come looking for us?”
“Third-year summer, though, things started getting bad again. Vernon had decided to confiscate my things when he came to get me from King’s Cross, and I had little choice but to comply. I knew I needed a place to live, so I couldn’t defy him. They were emboldened by their decision to take my things away, and Vernon made sure that I felt every bit of his displeasure at not being able to ‘punish’ me for the last two years. Even when I threatened him with Sirius, he wasn’t swayed.
He finally reached the gates to the manor, and could feel the wards wrap around him as he went inside.
Harry nodded against his shoulder, another weight lifting from his shoulders. He’d been carrying it with him for months now, afraid of talking about it because he
“Don’t be sorry, baby. You just grazed my prostate and it felt really good.” Draco said, catching Harry’s eyes. Harry grinned again.
Harry beamed. He’d just received two incredible gifts and he was having trouble keeping the tears away. He wasn’t sad by any means, but extremely happy.
“The chocolate is some of the best in the world. Guaranteed to lift your spirits with only one bite. Draco has always loved it. Used to beg me for some during his summer breaks.” Narcissa said lovingly.
Harry gave himself a mental kick for watching Draco as he walked away. He was obviously attracted to the young blonde, but it wouldn’t do him any good to pursue those feelings, especially when he had so many responsibilities. Besides, he highly doubted the other teen felt the same attraction, and even if he did, Harry was sure that Draco wouldn’t let it be known.
“Perhaps we should retire for the evening? You are undoubtedly exhausted and we have much to discuss tomorrow.” Severus inquired.
“I doubt you’ll know this, but Lucius was attracted to men. In fact, he was devastated when our parents arranged for him to marry me, and it wasn’t until after we married that I told him I knew where his attraction truly lay. He, of course, was worried that I would cause an issue over it, but nothing could have been further from the truth.  I told him to seek whomever he wanted, so long as he produced an heir first.
Harry watched Draco sleep for a while, content to absorb the peaceful face he had while dreaming. It was so different from the closed off, detached expressions he usually had. He let his thoughts drift back to the beginning of the summer, and was left in awe at how much had changed. He went from an abusive household to the manor of his family, and that alone made all the pain and suffering he had endured at the Dursley’s worth it. He had made peace with the Malfoy’s
“Professor Snape. I had another vision in my dreams this morning, sir. Voldemort was with Professor Snape and Voldemort was using Legilimency, and then, all of a sudden, Professor Snape attacked him. That’s why I had my house elf come and get you. You’ve got to help him!” Harry pleaded.
He did as he was told; double checking his Occlumency shields were firmly in place, he made sure to vividly recreate the scene he was just talking about. Upon locking eyes with Voldemort, he immediately felt him probing his mind, looking for any inaccuracies.
And Harry was true to his word. He went so slow that the worst Draco felt was a slight burning sensation when Harry had gotten about half way in, and had stopped when he heard the small gasp Draco let out. He had waited for Draco’s nod before continuing and the process went much smoother when Draco realized that if he pushed down on Harry, almost like he was trying to
Draco didn’t ask any questions and Harry was so wrapped up in his head that he almost seemed to forget the other boy was there. They had walked far out into the vineyards, Draco more or less leading them, when Harry stopped walking and pulled Draco into a hug. Draco was surprised for a moment but returned the embrace without thinking about it.
“Mr. Potter, would you mind if I explored your grounds? I had a look out the window and saw the most beautiful lake… I’d like to go and sit next to it for a while.” She asked.
will be able to endure the curse on his mind for long, but I think it’ll be long enough for you to get a good head start on thinking about what you’ve done to Harry. You were supposed to take care of him but you treated him as nothing more than a
“I’ll make it my personal mission to teach the boy proper Occlumency. We’ll get started immediately and this time, we won’t fail.” Snape said.
“Through the door, please, sir. If you is needing anything else, please call for Meemy.” Meemy requested, pushing him through the door as she spoke.
Harry took a few minutes as the sun set to catch his breath and rethink his strategy. Simply saying the spell in his mind was obviously not enough. It might work for the simple spells, but anything he thought of that would destroy the boulder and it really didn’t have the oomph it needed. He sat down in the grass and started brainstorming to see if there was an approach he hadn’t thought of.
Harry was woken the next morning by a dark figure looming over him. He reflexively pulled Draco tighter to him in a panic before he realized that it was just Severus. Just Severus who was now looking at Harry and Draco in bed. Together. With no shirts on.
They spent the morning together, choosing to go over to the newly refurbished stables once they had made it out of the bedroom and out of the kitchen. Harry had only seen them once: when they were covered in cobwebs, and had missing and rotting boards, and had thick dust that coated the surfaces and air.
It took him a few seconds to snap out of the daze he was in, but when he focused on the doorway, he saw a line of black-clad figures standing in a line and advancing on his home. In the middle of them stood Voldemort, face alight with rage and fury. They were already casting spells towards him; red, green, purple, blue, and yellow colors flew towards him. They exploded around him, some blasting holes in the walls surrounding the doorway, some missing him and hitting the wall mere inches away from his head, starting small fires where they landed. Severus knew if he didn’t act immediately, he was dead.
He only held it for a few seconds, but it was enough to completely shatter the spell that held her in place. Petunia fell to the floor, shaking and screaming on her way down. Again, Severus felt nothing but satisfaction from her screams, and was about to cast it again when the front door crashed open and in rushed a wheezing Vernon Dursley.
“I just miss them so much. Thinking about them brings so much pain that it makes it hard to breathe...”
“Truthfully?” Harry asked after his blush died down. “My house-elves. I hardly see Dizzy or Nipsy because I’m always calling for Meemy. I just thought it weird, is all.”
“I was dealing with a stubborn potion that required the most delicate of stasis charms. Had I not lingered to place those charms, I would have returned to find my home wrecked, destroyed by a volatile potion left unattended. I apologize for my absence, master.” Severus said.
“I’ll give it a try, Professor.” Harry replied, then cheekily added with a small grin, “And please, call me ‘Harry’ or ‘Potter’, no need for the Mr. anymore.”
“Very good, Harry. It sounds like you found them. Now, it should be as simple as adjusting them to what you want them to do.” Dumbledore said from somewhere behind him.
Severus crashed through the water and swam as fast as possible away from the affected area. Harry was full-on laughing when Severus swam up to him.
Harry shook his head. He would think about this later. Right now, he needed to focus on keeping his thoughts and memories contained behind the barrier. He took a breath, securing his mind as he did so, and walked back to the house.
Narcissa nodded and walked away, still smiling and dabbing at her eyes. Harry turned questioning eyes on Draco.
They stayed like that for a few minutes, Harry gaining more and more courage the longer it went on, and Draco was so relaxed when Harry told him he was going to start inserting fingers, he wasn’t the least bit worried. He waited to feel the intrusion and it came, gently and slowly, and he was thankful that Harry was willing to take his time.
Sorry in advance for any grammar I missed or any weird sentences. This was put out pretty quickly with little editing.
Getting down on one knee, carefully avoiding the different types of body fluid pooling on the floor near Vernon, Severus lightly called his name. Vernon’s beady eyes locked on his, and that was all the opportunity Severus needed.
“Not at all. A shower sounds good. See you in a bit, then.” Draco replied, already walking down the hall.
When Harry arrived on the western lawn, he found Severus staring at the lake, with his hands clasped behind his back. His robes had been discarded and were floating next to him as if there were an invisible coat-hanger on the lawn. His sleeves were pushed up, and Harry could see the Dark Mark, burned black and deep, on his teacher's forearm. He looked away as Severus turned to him.
“I’m sorry for what’s about to happen,” Harry said, sorrow leaking into his voice, before pointing his wand at the door and shouting, “
The two stood at the ready for a moment, staring at each other. Harry’s heart was beating quickly, adrenaline pumping through his veins, his anticipation for Severus’ cast seeming unbearable. Then, suddenly, a bright bolt of orange light was heading straight for him, and Harry nearly froze. But he reacted a bit too late to put up a shield and chose to dive left out of the way.
“I will apparate the Malfoy’s with me, Severus. We’ll meet you at Potter Manor. Do not delay.” Dumbledore commanded, his tone leaving no room for argument.
Harry was pretty sure he’d never been this relaxed before, and he was truly enjoying life here. Nearly two weeks had passed since he’d arrived at the manor, and he had spent every minute he could exploring his ancestor’s home.  The first couple of days he spent searching through all the rooms; he was blown away to find out just what it had to offer.
“Potter! I need you conscious for this, at least for a moment. You need to drink this, and then you can sleep. Do you hear me? POTTER!” Snape lashed out at Harry.
Dumbledore gave a small smile and replied. “It’s simple, Harry. Just reach your hand out and concentrate. Try to feel them in your mind. I’m sure they’ve already made their presence noticed.”
Harry started to move his finger in and out, pressing a kiss to Draco’s shoulder or neck every few moments, until Draco told him to add another finger.
They shared the laugh for a few moments before Draco carefully rolled off of Harry and stood up. When he did, he stuck his hand out for the other boy to use for help up.
Professor Snape spun on his heel and disappeared from the room, leaving Harry to follow at a quick pace.
“It was about of us, of course, years from now, and living here. We were in the kitchen, preparing dinner… with a few children running around us. It was the most domestic thing I’ve ever thought of and it only lasted for a minute, but I realized something during this daydream. “He said. “I love you.”
He just nodded as he turned around and sought out Draco. The blonde was standing near the door, trying very hard to look like he wasn’t attempting to eavesdrop and failing miserably. Harry smiled softly and shook his head as he walked over to him.
Harry was panting as he placed soft kisses along Draco’s jaw until he made it to his neck, where he proceeded to bite, ever so gently, causing the boy to let out a moan. As he alternated from kissing to soft biting at his neck, he slid his hands down to the bottom of Draco’s shirt and slid his hands underneath. He explored the other boy’s stomach and chest while Draco reignited the kiss.
The one constant in his life, the one person he was sure he could always count on had a date with death. It was unfair and Harry wanted to scream his sorrow. Why did the people he cared about keep dying? He knew Dumbledore wasn’t dead yet, but he only had a year. It was almost worse knowing it was coming than if he had died tonight.
“Is that… Mr. Malfoy?” Remus asked. His eyes traveled down to their clasped hands, and it was almost comical to watch his brain go into overdrive.
When they finally emerged from the bathroom some 20 minutes later, they both had pruned hands and feet, and Harry was certain he had never spent that long in the shower before. But he wouldn’t change a single thing.
been captured, the Dark Lord wouldn’t have kept it a secret.” Draco said. “Did everything go well at your… meeting?”
had tried to rape him, but he surprised to find that that was all he felt towards the man. In fact, once he got past those emotions, he felt a cold detachment from him. Almost like the emotion had evolved into something else. That was certainly interesting.
Twenty minutes later and Harry had dressed, eaten breakfast, drank the foul nutrient potion, and was standing on the western lawn facing Severus, waiting for the man to speak.
It was dusk now, and the group had finally started talking while picking at pieces of food. There had been a couple of European Nightjar’s that had started up a song and made the whole setting just feel comfortable. When it started getting dark, Dumbledore had simply flicked his wand and the torches around the patio sprang to life with flame.
“I could be wrong, sir, but I’m pretty sure Professor Snape was carrying Malfoy.” Harry said softly.
Harry turned and saw that Severus had turned his back to them. He was looking at the sunset reflecting off the lake, so Harry went and stood next to him, feeling a little awkward and unsure of what to say. Eventually, though, he found his voice.
The pair still needed to find his mother, and it had to be getting close to dinner, but Draco wanted to show Harry how much he loved him, and he knew a perfect activity for that.
It had been another long day of training for Harry, but he was determined to get this, even if it took all night, too. He had been trying everything he could think of in an attempt to get the more powerful spells to actually have the required strength behind them but were all still extremely weak. The rock he was trying to destroy had small fissures running through it, but it was still solid and showed no signs of breaking any time soon.
The next thing he knew, Draco had stepped into the shower with him. His night clothes were instantly soaked, probably ruining what was an expensive silk outfit. Draco sat next to him with his back to the wall and pulled him into his arms. Harry leaned his head on Draco’s chest and wrapped an arm around his torso.
“N-nothing. It’s just… I’ve just been trying to psyche myself up to do this for a couple of days, and… I don’t know, now.” He said.
Everyone was looking at Harry to move first, giving him his choice of meat. He quickly grabbed a bun and swiped a burger before he said: “dig in!”
Harry chanced a glance inside the room at this point. He saw Severus kneeling down in front of the headmaster. Dumbledore was admiring his right hand and Harry gasped when he saw that it was blackened and looked… dead. Dumbledore must have heard him gasp because he looked Harry in the eyes and gave him a small, serene smile before turning his attention back to his hand.
Draco only nodded and reluctantly pulled himself away from Lucius. He took a few shaky breaths and stood up, hand held out for his mother to take.
When he banged the door open at the end, he saw Petunia Dursley in mid-reach for the phone on the wall.
Harry obeyed, a smile on his face until he truly emptied his mind. When he was finished, his face was perfectly calm and he was able to focus very clearly on the professor’s next words.
“Mr. Potter, I think it would be best if you were to simply try it. There are a hundred different ways for me to explain this, but I think that a more direct approach will work better.” Severus said.
“Save your breath, Potter.” Severus said with a sigh. “There is breakfast for you, along with your potion, in the kitchen. Meet me outside when you are ready.”
Narcissa took one more look at Severus and Lucius before joining Draco. Together, they entered the fireplace and Flooed to Spinner’s End, Narcissa clutching tightly to Draco’s hand.
Harry thought about this for a moment. He doubted he would ever know the reason for his parent’s not wanting to use the manor, but he truly didn’t see the harm in adding another layer of protection around himself.
He didn’t know how long he stayed like that, but he was eventually roused by someone approaching him. He looked at the incoming person upside down and his heart gave a little jolt when he realized it was Draco.
She had brought them some roast beef sandwiches for lunch, along with ice-cold, fresh lemonade. It had been a nice reprieve from the heat of the day to kick back under one of the trees on the bank of the lake. They had eaten mostly in silence, with Severus breaking the quiet every now and again with pointers for Harry. But that had been five hours ago, and Harry’s stomach was growling.
“Come on, I’ll give you a quick tour of the ground floor on the way to the drawing room.” Harry said.
After dinner was over, Harry decided to go for a walk around the lake to clear his mind. It had been a physically and mentally taxing day for him, and he was having trouble clearing his mind and focusing on his shield, so he needed to take some time and get it stable again. Draco had asked if he wanted company, but Harry had just smiled and told him no before departing with a kiss.
They sped-walked up to Harry’s bedroom and Harry quickly pulled his broom out of the closet. He walked over to the window and threw it open, mounting the broom and then holding his hand out for Draco as he did so. The other boy took it and quickly climbed onto the back of the now hovering broom, securely wrapping his arms around Harry’s waist after finding a comfortable position to sit. With a quick word of assurance that Draco was seated and ready, Harry kicked off hard and shot out of the window. He felt Draco tighten his grip and couldn’t help the laugh that came from the exhilaration he felt. He flew high, fast, before leaning back into a freefall that had them quickly approaching the ground. He accelerated towards it and felt Draco tighten his grip even more. With only seconds to spare, Harry expertly pulled out of the dive, and aimed the broom back towards the sky, slowing down as they started flying over the wide open fields that belonged to his family. Draco had started to relax as soon as Harry slowed down, and now his hands were merely resting on his stomach.
Harry stood silent for a few moments, letting the information, really the disappointment, wash through him.
Harry threw his hand out and caught the letter with ease. He shot Draco a grin before he tore into his letter.
“How would you feel about doing this outside? Perhaps the western lawn would suffice?” Professor Snape queried.
Harry looked quickly at Draco, surprised that he hadn’t given a second thought to who was about to see them in bed together. Maybe he didn’t care? Harry didn’t have a chance to agonize over it, though, because the door opened and Narcissa walked in. If she had a problem with the sight she was being faced with, she hid it well.
Severus sighed. Of course, Potter would be stubborn over absolutely nothing. With another small sigh, Severus went inside and made his way up the stairs, smoothing his facial features into one of cool impassiveness. When he reached the door, he gave a small knock before entering, not bothering to wait for a reply. He was met with a dark room, one where he could faintly see Potter’s face looking at him through the darkness.
Harry led the way, followed by Snape and Dumbledore, to the study that was located on the first floor. When the three had made themselves comfortable, Dumbledore spoke.
“Well, if you don’t want to talk, that’s fine. But I’m definitely not your mother.” Harry replied, letting out a small chuckle as he did so.
“I will admit, I am partially to blame for this. Let’s say forty percent responsible. I did not try as hard as I should have to help you close your mind to the Dark Lord, and it led to the death of your Godfather. For that, I am sorry…” Professor Snape paused to let his words sink in before he spoke again. “However, with that being said, you must never allow him inside your head again. And now that your house is under the protection of a Fidelius Charm, you have to be doubly careful.
Harry made his way to the gates of the property, stopping only to tell the anxious Meemy (who had followed him since he left the manor) that he would be back before nightfall. Upon seeing her nod, Harry marched through the gates, and turned left, following the road that The Knight Bus had left on just weeks prior.
The next week went on at about the same pace. Harry spent most of the days training with Severus, and every night with Draco.
They continued the birthday chant as the elves placed the cake on the table. The flames from the torches bounced off the shards of color embedded in the icing and Harry was mesmerized.
Draco closed the short distance to Harry’s lips and slipped his tongue in between his slightly parted lips, taking full control and rooting Harry to the spot. For a moment, Harry forgot why he was leaving in the first place, content to just lay in bed with Draco and let him explore his mouth. He realized, though, that he really did need to get ready, and broke the kiss with a sigh.
Two other sheets of paper were in the envelope and he quickly set aside the acceptance letter and list of books, his breath catching slightly when he finally saw the O.W.L. results.
Severus woke up to the sound of rain lightly pattering on his window. From what he could tell through one cracked eye, it was still early morning, and a quick Tempus charm verified that it was barely half past six. He was tempted to roll over and go back to sleep, but he could faintly smell bacon being made and it was enough to rouse him from bed.
“The smears lead to the living room couch, where I found a large pool of blood. The air is still heavy with dark magic, so I’m assuming they tortured him before taking him away. Did you find anything?” Severus replied.
“I think, Mr. Potter, that the first thing we should focus on is nonverbal casting. This should be relatively easy for you to master, as you already have a strong grip on your mind. Mastering this before your next meeting with the Dark Lord is essential.” Severus said.
He hastily stowed his wand before he mumbled an apology. “Sorry. Really not used to having people around.”
“Right on time, Potter.” Severus said when Harry arrived at the bottom of the stairs. He held his hand out and Harry grimaced when he saw that he was clutching his nutrient potion. He took it from him and downed it without complaint, though, and was rewarded with a smile from the man.
Draco shifted so that he straddled Harry’s right leg and lightly pulled his head up so that he was looking Draco in the eyes.
Harry didn’t know what to say, especially because he didn’t know why she had offered all that information. He watched, though, as she brought her wand to her head and suddenly everything in Harry screamed at him to stop her.
Harry could see the top of a bottle green, presumably silk, nightshirt. It fit him well, looking snug without being too tight. He let his eyes linger for just a moment before walking towards Draco. There were chairs placed on either side of the queen sized bed, and Harry plopped down into one of them. Draco turned to face him but didn’t say anything; things seemed awkward for a moment, as Harry didn’t speak, either. He was trying to think of what to do when an idea came to him.
He was neutral up to this point, as unbiased as Harry could hope for without going and talking to some random stranger.
With a shout and a few of his best swear words, Harry and the unsuspecting passenger took a ride down the stairs… backward. He noticed as he was falling that the person desperately clinging to him was Draco, but it didn't register until they started bouncing off each stair on the way to the bottom. They landed in a heap at the bottom, with Draco managing to place his knee directly in Harry's crotch. He groaned and shut his eyes, reflexively placing a cupped hand over the family jewels, and cursed the Gods for his luck. When the pain had subsided to a manageable level, Harry opened his eyes and saw Draco trying to stifle a laugh.
He faltered for a second and felt his Occlusion slip. With a breath and slight shake of his head, he kept his shield up, and only when he was sure that it wouldn't slip again did he allow himself a rare moment to remember his closest friend.
“Do not make me regret this, Harry.” Dumbledore said quietly, before backing up and speaking loud enough to include Narcissa and Draco. “Please, allow us entry past your wards, Harry. We will get started on the Fidelius Charm as soon as we are through.”
Harry looked back down at the picture. He knew Lily was beautiful, but he had never seen a picture of her where she looked so carefree and relaxed. He leaned back on to the pillows, held the picture close, and closed his eyes.
Releasing a small sigh, Severus walked towards the kitchen with a scowl in place. When he arrived, he found Draco wrapped in his mother’s arms, two cups of tea steaming away on the table.
She said her thanks and disappeared through a door. Harry wasn’t sure, but he thought he heard her voice crack.
“Dizzy, please show them the way. See that you get them anything they need, whatever it is.” Harry said.
When they entered the room, unnoticed, they saw Severus was standing by the windows, hands clasped behind his back, looking down the long driveway that led to the main gate. Draco was sitting on the sofa, legs crossed, looking up at the ceiling, seemingly mesmerized by the pillow he was using his wand to levitate and spin.
“I’m sorry, Harry. I don’t know what to say besides I don’t think I’ve ever been this angry at people I’ve never met before. You should have been treated like a prince after defeating the Dark Lord. These relatives should have worshipped the ground you walked on, instead, they treated you like a bloody house elf.” Draco said.
Draco lifted his head, a small smile on his lips. “The Boy-Who-Lived telling his devoted supporters to fuck off? I’m truly shocked.”
“You will accompany me to Privet Drive. We must verify that Vernon has indeed been captured. Did they mention anything of Petunia or Dudley?” Dumbledore questioned.
The trek back to the house was a much more jovial affair than the original walk had been, now that Harry knew Remus wasn’t upset with him. They kept the talking light as they headed back, Harry leading the way once they got to the steps of the house.
“The Dark Lord knows that I helped heal Potter after the others failed to capture him yesterday. I chose to fight rather than die.” Severus stated.
Harry let out a massive snort and had a smile plastered on his face as he and Remus walked into the room fully, Harry leading the way to the couch, as Severus turned to join them. They all took seats somewhere around Draco, by the fireplace, which had a heatless fire going. They all looked at each other, waiting for someone to say something. Harry coughed.
, if you’d like to call it that. It’s probably going to be upsetting, but I think you should know that the Dark Lord has captured your uncle. Dumbledore and I went to confirm this, earlier this afternoon. We found this when we searched the house. ”
He was instantly viewing Vernon’s memories and he took his time looking through them. Very close to the surface of his memories, he found Vernon mistreating young Harry Potter, in one way or another, and that led Severus to believe that this was something that Vernon thought of every day, something he took
“Please, Mrs. Malfoy. I’d very much like you to treat this as your home for as long as you’re here. The lake is quite wonderful and is fed by a stream that even I haven’t fully explored yet. Let me know if there is anything I, or my house elves, can do for you.” Harry replied.
Narcissa smiled that genuine smile from the other night, and came further into the room to sit next to Draco.
It depressed Harry, knowing that in another time, another universe, he could have grown up here. That he could have had an amazing childhood filled with love and adventure. But he quickly locked those depressing thoughts away, for he knew that there was no point in dwelling on what could have been.
Harry arrived in the kitchen and saw that Mrs. Malfoy had already poured the tea and was waiting with an air of patience that Harry could only hope to achieve someday. When she heard the door close, she turned her gaze to him and gestured to the cup on the opposite side of her.
Vernon froze, shock crossing his face for only a second before being marred with hatred. With a silenced scream of rage, Vernon charged at Severus, intent on causing him as much pain as Harry had caused him. He only made it a few steps, however, before being met with another spell from Severus.
“As much as I would enjoy snogging you senseless, I don’t think it would be wise to keep Severus waiting for too long.” Harry breathed out.
“I still can’t believe James never told us about the Manor. Even when Sirius was living with him, he never mentioned it. The property they used back then was somewhere along the River Tay in Scotland. I was invited to stay a few times during summer hols, but even though it was beautiful, it doesn’t compare to this.” Remus said.
Draco, however, truly broke down this time. He slumped to his knees, sobs wracking his lithe frame. In a flash Narcissa was down beside him, cradling him as best she could from her position.
The man smiled. “I’ve made the right decision, then. I encourage you to look into its history if you find yourself having some free time. I’m sure you could find a portrait somewhere that would love to tell you all about it.”
“When I say, I want you to raise your wand in front of you and cast, in your mind, the first spell that comes up. You will move your wand as you would normally, but do not open your eyes. Do not open your mouth to speak. Let your brain do all the work. Shout it in your mind as if you were shouting it from the rooftops if that helps you. But it must be internal. Understood?” Severus finished.
“I got a letter, boy,” his uncle said, voice low and deadly, dripping with something that made Harry’s skin crawl. “It was from those freaks that you love so much. Professor Dumbledore. He informed me of the… unfortunate passing of your Godfather.” Uncle Vernon finished with a sound of delight in his voice, but said no more. Leaving his statement at that, he spun around on his heel, and started walking towards the lot.
It was funny, with him being in Slytherin, you would think he would have hated Gryffindor’s on principle. But something about Hermione’s know-it-all attitude, and Ron’s inability to stop eating attracted him, and by his second year at school, he had a solid friendship with them. Now… Now Ron and Sirius were dead, and Hermione was most likely never going to recover.  He couldn’t help the tears that started flowing down his face at the thought of them, the tears that threatened to overcome his body and cause painful sobs that he wouldn’t be able to stop. But there was a time and place for that, and if he didn’t get help soon, it wouldn’t matter that they died to save him, because he would be joining them soon.
They would have to move as soon as possible, but Severus needed to reach out to the Headmaster. He was almost sure that Dumbledore would offer the remaining Malfoy’s refuge, but if he was wrong... well, he would go down that path later.
He assumed it was Mrs. Malfoy, coming back for something. He turned and had her name on his tongue when he realized that it was Draco. He stopped short; Draco wasn’t wearing a shirt and his face was flushed all the way down to his collar bone. His usually perfect hair was a slight mess, and his eyes were puffy. Harry had never seen Draco look so… wrecked.
Harry waited, feeling that he wasn’t finished. He was proven right when the man started talking after a short pause.
Harry woke up the following morning holding a particular blonde in his arms. He vaguely remembered a steamy make-out session before the two had passed out. He wasn’t sure when he had made the decision to sleep in Draco’s room last night, but looking down at the person in his arms, he really didn’t care.
“Alecto, is that you?! How nice to see you again! Shame about Amycus, but he never was too bright, was he? Maybe in his next life, he’ll remember to duck.” Severus taunted, slowly moving in a half circle while dueling her.
Harry stood up and pocketed his wand. He gingerly positioned himself to pick Draco up before bending over to grab him. The boy was weightless. Again, Harry was shocked. Had he gotten the hang of nonverbal casting in only a day, or was this a fluke? He was too tired to think about it right now.
? He fumbled his way back to his bed and sat down to read the letter that couldn’t possibly exist, carefully placing the other documents on the bed beside him.
“We have the fat Dursley, master. It would seem that the woman and boy left, but the man was sleeping in an upstairs bedroom at their house. Looks like Potter really did leave them.” The newcomer announced.
“Well done, Mr. Potter. I’ve been trying to gain entry into your mind for nearly an hour now. If we continued at this pace, I imagine that your shield would totally fail and grant me access, but that is not my goal. It does, however, bring me to the next topic at hand. I want you to practice holding that ball around your mind until it becomes second nature. If you keep at it, it should only be a matter of time before I am unable to weaken and penetrate your mind, even when you’re sleeping. It will be mentally taxing, and I doubt you’ll be able to hold full length conversations with anyone, so perhaps for a few days you should retire to your personal quarters, or a private, quiet place and only come out when it’s absolutely necessary.” The Professor said.
” when he remembered what Severus said about nonverbal spells. He sighed deeply but cast in his head, instead. His wand tip flared slightly, almost like he was holding a torch with near-dead batteries. Another sigh, but at least he wouldn’t trip over something he couldn’t see. He made his way across the stone landing but didn’t see anything that would have made the noise.
Harry was suddenly looking down at a much younger Snape, and he realized with a shocking jolt, his mother. They were at Hogwarts, maybe first or second year, down by the banks of the lake. His mother was laughing at something Snape had just said.
He had tried to stick by his resolution to not care, but he couldn’t. Every time he saw Draco, it was like the boy had cast a spell that made Harry notice everything he did. Like, a reverse notice-me-not spell. It was infuriating, because it seemed like every time Harry tried to speak to him, Draco would find a way or reason to leave, usually back up to his room.
“Find him- for me- give him- the floo- address. Tell him- I’m dying. Lily said… Lily said…” Harry finally lost consciousness, mouth still trying to form the words.
Harry pulled him into a tight hug and kissed his cheek before he whispered a, “thank you” into his ear. When he pulled away, he hoped no one could tell that his eyes were a little watery.
With a scowl on his face, Harry said “When I heard the apparition, I turned around and saw them coming to the front door. So I blew it open right as they were about to enter. The three of them were blasted backwards, and one of them definitely got caught by the rubble. One of them I stunned as I was running away, but the third one gave chase. I hid in an alleyway until I thought I could get the drop on him, but you see how well that worked… once I realized he had hit me, I made my way home as fast as I could.
to attack their master. That was all the opening he needed. He whirled on the two guarding the door and hit them with two stunners, rushing them as he did so. Another wave of his wand and the door was blasted open. He had just made it past the threshold when the first few spells whizzed past him. The dark green curse that just missed his ear made him realize they were in it to kill, not to capture.
They walked in silence for a few minutes, Remus glancing every now and then out of the corner of his eye at Harry, causing the teen to feel a sense of foreboding. They walked until they reached a huge rock that was half in the water, half out, and Harry stopped, choosing to jump up on said rock and dangle his feet over the edge. Remus hesitated for a moment, but eventually climbed up and sat next to him.
At the table closest to his left hand, he could almost see Lily bending over to drop something in a simmering cauldron. The table that sat directly on the right wall, he could see a shadow of himself prepping ingredients, smirking at something that Lily had said. With an almost tangible snap, Snape pulled himself out of his memories, and started looking around the room for the items which would save young Potter’s life. It was quite amazing, actually. Everything was in the spot that Severus had last seen it. It was meticulously organized, and it made finding the proper potions a breeze.
Harry turned to face him. He looked into his beautiful silver-grey eyes for a moment and then smiled.
He raced out of his study and down the hall to the room, wrenching the door open when he got there, intent on grabbing Lucius and leaving. But as he pulled the door open, he was blasted back by an explosion that destroyed the front of his house. Severus was hit with pieces of glass and debris, not having the time to react with any kind of charm that would shield the blast. He gasped out in pain as he forcefully slammed into the wall behind him, plaster and bits of wall showering him as he slid down to the floor.
***I also updated tags to more accurately reflect what kind of fic this is. I'm sure I'll add more***
Harry felt himself stiffen at Dumbledore’s words. So he thought them stupid for trusting someone they thought to be their friend? He almost lashed out at Dumbledore before an idea occurred to him.
Harry nodded and tossed the towel to his bed. He quickly pulled on a shirt and trousers followed by his trainers, and grabbed Meemy’s outstretched hand so they could apparate to the edge of the wards.
From what he could see in the moonlight, Harry was looking up at a 2 story manor. He wanted to explore the grounds, but he was honestly dead tired. He would wait until the morning and see what they had to offer when he could properly see.
Harry laughed, but made no further comment. Draco moaned loudly as Harry slowly pulled out and thrust back in, getting used to the motion, and also, Draco assumed, trying to drive him mad with desire.
He shrugged. The only people who could get in were people he trusted, and that was enough for him. He continued his way up to the house and was unsurprised to see lights on downstairs. A quick tempus charm showed that it was already after midnight. Apparently, whoever it was needed something.
His professor said nothing, only turned to give him a slightly disapproving stare, and whether it was due to his choice of language, or the fact that he was half naked, Harry was unsure. Snape turned back towards the window and motioned to the other chair, clearly telling Harry to join him. He pulled his zipper back up and took the seat next to the older man, not caring that he still had his shirt off.
Regardless, that was old news. From what Severus had overheard from Dumbledore (intentionally, he was quite sure, that meddling old man) was Potter had gone and run away. No one was quite sure why, and that nasty Aunt of his was being tight lipped about it. Not that it was any of his concern what a hormonal teenager was doing with his summer, but… the boy would suffer his displeasure if he showed up in September with anything less than perfect health. He didn’t vow to keep him from harm just to have him go and throw that away because he couldn’t handle things at home.
Meemy popped into existence at the other end of the patio and with a snap of her fingers, the grill was alive with fire. Another snap, and it was as clean as new, and with another, final snap she had the burgers sizzling away.
“He mentioned earlier that he was having trouble sleeping, so I offered to stay until he fell asleep. I didn’t intend on also falling asleep, but I guess I was more tired than I thought.” Harry said.
“Uh, wait. Your mum said she was going to visit a relative that she hadn’t seen in a long time. She said she’d probably be gone a few days.” Harry said.
With a curt nod, Severus stood up and walked to the door, waving his wand around the room and returning it to its darkened state. As he was about to leave, he heard a murmured “good night” come from across the room.
They quickly reached the end, and Severus was met with a door to his left and an archway to the right that led off down another short corridor.
” Dumbledore said firmly, wand pointed at the manor. A bright white light erupted from the house. It seemed like someone had turned on spotlights from every window of the house, except it was mid-day and it was impossibly bright.
“Actually, there is. You are probably one of the few people who can say they know what it feels like to lose someone they care about. In fact, I imagine you can say that a few times over.” Mrs. Malfoy said.
Severus knew that his spell would only stun the dark lord, but he didn’t care. He needed to get out of there. The Death Eaters along the walls were shocked still, obviously not expecting
“As Master wishes, of course.” Meemy said, sinking into yet another bow, a slight smirk marring her features.
Harry had been sleeping, pressed firmly against Draco, as was his favorite position to sleep in (the only thing ‘better’ was when Draco agreed to be held by him, something the blonde didn’t often do) and it was still dark outside when he was woken by soft but insistent knocking on the door. He groaned and cast a quick ‘
The next gift was from Narcissa. She had given him his gift in a small green bag that he was sure if he checked, would perfectly match the color of his eyes. Something that smelled truly amazing was wafting from inside and when Harry pulled it out, he realized it was a bar of chocolate with some German name on it. There was an envelope inside the bag with his name written on the front. He set the chocolate aside and opened the envelope, which held an elegant card with a name and address written on it.
“Be calm, Harry. I would never harm myself, especially not when Draco is still alive in this world.” She said. “
’ back into the kitchen, the pair took off out the door leading to the lake, Harry telling Draco that the men had probably been waiting for a while. They spotted the professors standing next to the giant tree everyone was so fond of and headed towards them, though it became obvious as they drew closer that the two men were arguing. Harry grabbed Draco’s hand as they neared.
The next thing Harry knew, Draco was on top of him, tickling him in places Harry didn’t even know were ticklish. Harry was gasping for breath in no time, but Draco didn’t let up. Draco continued his assault until Harry had tears streaming down his face.
Severus nodded his agreement and crept down the short hallway. He briefly checked the closet under the stairs where Harry used to be kept – nothing. He took a deep breath and continued on, using a spell to open the hallway door. On the other side, he found more smeared blood, which lead over to the couch in the living area. He glanced around the room before making his way over to the couch. Here he found a large pool of congealing blood.
They headed downstairs after the shower was finished and Harry was feeling amazing. They walked hand in hand towards the kitchen and were surprised to find when they arrived that the door wouldn’t open. Harry was about to ask Draco if he knew what was going on when Meemy popped into existence behind them.
They got dressed in a comfortable silence, Draco deciding to borrow some of Harry’s clothes, and Harry deciding to mimic his outfit. They ended up dressed in white cargo shorts and a light blue shirt, and if it hadn’t been for the amazing time that they’d just had in the shower, Harry wouldn’t have been able to resist taking Draco to bed right there. As it was, they had been in here long past when they said they would be, and he
how you happened upon this place, and what happened this morning. Beware that you take care to leave nothing out.” Snape hissed out.
After making the short walk from the car into the house, Harry quickly made his way up the stairs, hoping to avoid his relatives for as long as possible. Thankfully, no one tried to stop him, and he made it to the safety of his room without any interruption.  After taking a look around his small room, Harry left his trunk by the door, moved the cage to its spot on his desk, and threw himself down on his bed. Something as menial as taking the train home and riding in the car to house shouldn’t have left him this tired, but all he could think about was sleeping. So, with that thought, Harry rolled over and drifted off into oblivion.
them pulsing as if they were alive, dancing as if they were happy. Concentrating harder, he realized he could locate everything that was currently alive and breathing on the grounds. He could see in his mind every inch of ground that the wards protected.
The rest of the morning was spent on idle chatter. Dumbledore had switched from planning the visit to Diagon back to being festive in the blink of an eye, and he soon had the table laughing as he told tales of his most memorable birthdays.
When they made it to the bathroom, Harry leaned into the shower and turned the taps on, turning around once again to Draco. They shared another kiss as steam slowly seeped out of the shower, eventually encasing them in a hazy cloud of warm mist, until Harry started pulling his shirt up, making Draco lift his arms, and then quickly discarding his own. Trousers and pants quickly followed their shirts, and Draco froze as he watched Harry get in and cautiously step under the spray.
“I’ll get straight to the point, Severus. I need to know what happened that made you attack Voldemort this morning.” Dumbledore said.
“Of course, Master Harry. It’ll be ready whenever you are.” Meemy responded, disappearing with a loud crack.
Severus was focused on showing his master the false memory, and therefore didn’t hear the person that walked into the room.
Harry took longer than a few seconds to answer this time, but he finally replied, “If that’s what you require, Professor, then I vow to be silent.”
Harry and Draco swam for the shore when they noticed her and they were followed by Severus. When they made it back, they were greeted with towels by Narcissa, who wrapped them around the pair.
It wasn’t super hot yet, but it was warm enough that Harry had broken into a light sweat, so he pulled his shirt off as he sat down next to Draco and leaned back against the tree. They were quiet for a moment, content to look around at the massive fields that were essentially Harry’s backyard.
“Eventually, he turned me on my stomach and pulled my pants down. I heard his pants drop and decided to try and kick him rather than scream for help. I hoped against hope that it would be enough. I was lucky that my blind kick had hit its intended target, and my uncle went down. I pulled my pants up and gathered my things. My bedroom door blew open before I even got to it and I was faced with my aunt, who looked like she had seen a ghost. I told her I was leaving, that I couldn’t stay there any longer. She didn’t try to stop me when I pushed past her.” Harry finished, nearly choking on his tears.
“I- I- I can’t talk about that, Professor. I can’t.” Harry almost pleaded, breaking their eye contact and looking down at his feet. He had intended to lie again, to say that he simply couldn’t stand being treated like a prisoner anymore, but the way Snape was looking at him… well, he simply found he couldn’t lie to him.
Harry didn’t hesitate and Draco adjusted quickly to the feeling of Harry finger fucking him. It was like he said, not at all unpleasant, but unusual. Until Harry added a third finger and his knuckle grazed what Draco knew to be his prostate. His cock throbbed in response and Draco clamped down on Harry’s fingers, and he noticed the other boy stopped moving immediately.
Meemy took one last anguished look at Harry before she disapparated, hell-bent on finding the potions master.
“Oh, uh, just a splash of milk and a lump of sugar. It’s no big deal.” Harry replied, feeling a bit uncomfortable.
Harry moved away from Draco who was still sleeping. He searched the ground for his pyjama bottoms and quickly pulled them on before joining the man at the chairs.
Minutes later, Severus was staring down in horror at the fifteen year old boy, who hardly looked like the boy he had known for five years. He had been tempted to sneer at the house elf that had come to fetch him… that was, until the elf had mentioned someone was dying and that that someone was (of course) Harry Potter. He had waited only long enough to ask the elf how bad it was, seeing the blood on the creature’s hands, before grabbing a few blood-replenishing potions, and then jumping into the floo.
The second group of papers was on official Gringotts letterhead. It listed just how much money his parents had left him, and Harry had to read it twice to make sure he hadn’t added a zero or two. It also listed all other items in the vault that he would inherit when he turned 17, and it seemed to go on forever. It appeared that this was everything that previous Potter’s had owned, and that, Gods willing, he would someday own. Harry blanched at the thought of Uncle Vernon finding out just how much money Harry truly had, and vowed that he would never find out.
Harry wasn’t sure when he fell asleep; only that it was very late when he woke. It didn’t take him long to notice what it was that woke him up. Someone was standing in the doorway, and they had hit the tray of food and water that was sitting by the door, effectively knocking it over. Harry scrambled to get his glasses on, and only calmed down a fraction when he had them on and saw who was in the doorway.
in order. When we go to Diagon Alley for your school supplies, you can get whatever you desire, entirely on me.” Narcissa said, dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief.
His face flamed and he experienced a moment of total embarrassment before realizing that this was probably going to happen eventually anyway. He calmed down considerably after that and instead relished in the fact that Draco had come to check on him last night. Not once had Draco complained, even when Harry had tried to hiccup out a “sorry” in the shower. Draco had told him to “shut it,” and held him tighter.
This caused Draco to roll his eyes slightly, but he still raised his hand in greeting to his former Professor.
“I think the two bedrooms down the hall from Severus’ share an en suite. Would that be okay, Mrs. Malfoy?” Harry asked.
Harry couldn’t believe it. He sat in stunned silence for a moment until it actually hit him that he had done it.
“Uh, yeah. I kind of fell asleep in your room and when I woke up and left, your mum stopped me and asked me to have tea with her.” Harry replied.
“Lunch is being ready soon, Master Harry, Mr. Draco.” She informed them. “Please be washing up before then.”
The only response he got was a pillow thrown, with surprising accuracy, at his head. He laughed as he headed out of Draco’s room and to his own to get ready for the day.
Harry and Severus had spent the better part of two hours reviewing the spells that Harry knew and could perform with little-to-no difficulty.
at the end of the school year was a prime example of that. If the boy had used his brain instead of letting his emotions run rampant, he would have seen that Severus had every intention of checking on the mutt staying at Grimmauld Place.
Harry took a few breaths, and slowly got up from his knees, doing his best not to jostle himself too much as the pain in his side was almost blinding now. He pulled off the remains of his shirt and started trying to stifle the bleeding.
“The next two years were some of the best of my life. I had found freedom at Hogwarts, I had friends who cared for me, and no one looked at me like I was less than human. The Dursley’s were too afraid of me when I would return for the summer to actually try and discipline me, so the summers were bearable.
The apparition was fast and hard, landing Severus squarely on the stoop of Number Four, Privet Drive. He didn’t bother stopping to knock, instead choosing to blast the door open with a flick of his wand. A scream and subsequent crash resulted from somewhere toward the back of the house and Severus allowed himself some small satisfaction before moving down the hall towards the scream.
Harry stripped his shirt off before he even started walking towards the bathroom, deep in thought about what today might bring. As he was working on the fly of his trousers, a small cough came from the chairs that sat by the windows. He whipped around, hand already going for the wand that was tucked in his back pocket. He relaxed considerably when he realized the person that had made the noise was none other than Snape, but he was still a little defensive when he asked, “Professor?! Bloody hell, I nearly hexed you. What are you doing in here?”
Meemy broke out into a wide grin and said, “Of course, Master Harry. Perhaps Meemy should start with the Potter Manor?”
It felt wonderful to be out of the house and walking down the beautiful countryside road, stopping to enjoy the random lakes and streams that seemed to dot the landscape. Harry truly felt happy; it was almost as if he could sense the echo’s of his parents walking down this same road, enjoying the same sights that he currently was, and it filled him with a true sense of peace. He continued down the road for almost an hour, passing an occasional house and giving a friendly wave when he saw someone out and about.
Harry’s eyebrows had raised higher and higher as she explained her gift. A horse? Especially what he assumed were thoroughbred horses? This was easily one of the most expensive gifts he’d ever received and it wasn’t until Draco lightly bumped his arm that Harry realized he hadn’t said anything.
“But Professor Snape, sir, my master is dying! He is needing your help. He asked me to bring you to him. He is not doing well, sir!” Meemy cried out, twisting her ears while tears swam in her eyes.
“Thank you, Professor. Since our training a few days ago, I have done nothing except eat, sleep and practice Occlumency. I was confident that I had it down yesterday afternoon. You see, about halfway through yesterday, I noticed I was able to keep a steady train of thought even while I had the shield up. After that, it became easier and easier to hold in place…” Harry trailed off, realizing he was rambling.
The sun had barely started to poke its head over the horizon, and the heat of the summer was still far behind that. When their breathing had returned to normal, Severus spoke.
. He crashed through the surface and water shot up nose, burning his sinuses as it did. He was released and he quickly pushed himself above the surface, spitting a mouthful of water out as he did. He looked wildly around for Snape but only found a chuckling Draco. Dumbledore and Narcissa were laughing from the bank and Harry could tell that he was alone in this fight.
Draco’s eyebrows disappeared into his hairline and he stumbled over his next words. “I… I mean… that’s… yeah. Okay then.”
“Can you tell me about the grounds? Better yet, can you tell me about everything? It’s absolutely beautiful here!” Harry said excitedly.
“Certainly, Professor, but are you sure this is the safest place? The Death Eaters have to know I’m around here somewhere. They found me in a small village not far from here. I... wasn’t as careful as I should have been when I came here.” Harry said, rubbing the back of his neck.
“This is amazing, Draco. Are you not happy that you completely aced your O.W.L.’s?” Harry questioned.
“Such a way with words, Potter. But, I understand. And you’re welcome.” Severus replied. “Now, let’s go get some dinner before it’s cold.”
Severus found himself alone in a large bedroom. There was a sizable bed set directly across the room, raised up on a low platform, with grey washed pine night stands set on either side of the bed. To his left, there was a wardrobe that seemed to perfectly match the theme of the room. The walls were painted a peaceful ocean blue and it paired well with the pine furniture. The right wall of the room was dominated by a giant window, one that come morning, would offer an amazing view of the eastern part of the grounds. Severus was about to head for the bed when he noticed a door directly to his right and decided to pull it open. Inside was another room, an en suite, complete with a giant shower and separate tub, along with a massive double vanity.
Harry got the gentle nudge in his head as he pushed the door to the kitchen open, notifying him of people crossing the wards. He was about to say as much when he saw Draco removing two envelopes from the leg of a brown barn owl.
“Oh… um… my aunt and uncle used to have me do this for them. They always used to complain I never did it right, but I guess it’s not too bad?” Harry replied.
“Now, when I tried to teach you Occlumency at school last year, things did not go as planned. Would you agree?” Professor Snape questioned.
“I believe the Death Eaters were correct in their assumption that Petunia and Dudley left. I couldn’t find anything that seemed to belong to them, and upon further inspection, I found this letter behind the bed where the blood trail seems to start.” Dumbledore said, handing the letter to Severus. He quickly unfolded and read it.
Hello again, everyone :) This has been written for like... 2 weeks? And I only just had the time to type it up and get it edited. I hope you enjoy, and as always, I look forward to your comments and criticism. Chapter 19 should be following soon <3
He closed his eyes and started doing what Snape told him, choosing to build a solid ball of steel around his memories. He ended up imagining that it surrounded his brain, sort of protecting it from people who wanted to do him harm. It took him some time, because he wanted to make sure that he was doing it correctly before he told Snape to check him. Finally, he opened his eyes and nodded, doing his best to hold the ball of steel in place.
Harry did as he was told, and opened his eyes. Seemingly nothing had changed, so he asked, “Did anything happen?”
There were 9 of the bedrooms upstairs, most of them positioned so they could share an en suite. They all varied in size and décor, and it was easily noticeable that the rooms hadn’t been used in a very long time, well before his parents had lived there, simply because of how dated the furniture was. It had taken Harry nearly two days to realize that the manor had another level, past the one with all the rooms. When Harry tried to open the door that was located at the top of the stairs, he was met with a locked door that wouldn’t budge, magic or not.
Harry could see the rage that was smoldering in his eyes and gulped.  He knew Snape would be upset, angry even, about being disturbed in the middle of his summer, but nothing close to this mad.
“Professor Snape, sir?! You is needed urgently! My master is needing you!” Meemy rushed out, trying to grab Severus by the arm and drag him to the fireplace.
Carefully, so he didn’t jostle Draco and wake him, Harry placed the boy's hand on the bed and stood up, stretching as he did so. He left the room shortly after, intent on going to his bed and possibly getting another couple of hours of sleep. As he was closing the door to Draco’s room, however, a figure behind him spoke and Harry jumped. He spun around, wand at the ready, before he realized that it was Mrs. Malfoy.
Snape seemed satisfied with what he did, or didn’t, see in Harry’s mind, because as quick as the attack came on, it stopped.
Harry grinned and turned back around to the bacon, pleased to see that it hadn’t burned while he had been distracted. He could feel Draco’s eyes on him, but didn’t feel he had much room to complain when he had practically buggered him with his eyes just a few moments ago. Instead, he focused on finishing the bacon and putting the sandwich together, which was done rather quickly.
. That they put themselves in extreme danger, and paid such a heavy price, speaks so much to their character that it’s truly a shame that the world will never know their blessings. But I feel as if I can say that given the choice again, they would still stand next to you; not out of duty of friendship, or foolishness, but because it is the right thing to do.” Remus said.
As he made his way up the drive to the hulking manor, Severus took a moment to ready himself to what he would say to Potter. The boy would undoubtedly ask where he had been and he didn’t know how Potter would react to his… unconventional and unusual punishment. He came up with a few stories that he thought could stand up to the boys questions, and eventually settled on using the truth/ not truth that he had to return home to finish brewing a few potions and grab a few books. He was pulled out of his musings upon reaching the door by Meemy, who was wringing her hands around a towel she was holding.
Hello again :) Chapter 7 is gonna be a bit crazy, Severus kinda goes off the deep end. Trigger warnings for violence? Idek if this warrants a warning, but you have it if you need it. Translation for the spell are in the end notes. I am adding them in, because google translate told me two different things. Soooooo yeah.
“You look good, pup. Whatever you’ve been eating has certainly agreed with you! And I could have sworn I smelled… Well. Never mind that.” He said, stepping towards Harry, before stopping again, a more surprised look taking over his face.
“I thought so.” He said, moving forward and crushing his lips against Harry’s. They “fought” for dominance, and Draco decided then that he didn’t care which of them was dominate, actually. He stopped fighting Harry and let him flip them around, so it was now
“I will do anything to keep Draco and Narcissa safe. And I refuse to stand by and do nothing to help you. I love my wife, Severus, and my son, but you have a place in my heart that has never been filled, and I won’t lose that.” Lucius said passionately.
Harry cracked a grin at that. “It’s not that... I’ve never told anyone about this. I think Severus knows or knows some of it, and he had a similar reaction when he found out about what my uncle tried to do, but it’s different with you knowing, and defending me. It... makes me happy.”
“You have ten minutes to meet me downstairs. If you aren’t there, I’ll assume you want to wait.” Severus finished.
“I- I need- Professor Snape. Can you- find him?” Harry struggled to get the words out. He was in serious trouble and he knew it. But rather than have Meemy call for someone else, he had made the decision to call for Snape. He didn’t know why, but something told him this was the right decision. Maybe his mother’s last wish had affected him more than he thought.
They sat there for a moment until the tap in the bathroom turned on, and they both shared a smile when they realized Draco had been eavesdropping.
“I will have to remember in the future.” She said. She seemed to be waiting for him to join her, and as soon as he sat down, she lifted her cup, taking a small sip.
Harry quickly looked at Draco, surprise wide in his eyes, and for a moment, Draco thought he might have rushed things, when Harry asked a gruff, “Really?”
There were several pregnant seconds of thick silence while Severus chewed on the words he wanted to continue throwing at Petunia. He noticed his hand was shaking slightly with adrenalin, and took a deep, calming breath before continuing.
Draco looked like he was on the verge of saying no, so Harry spoke again. “I’m making a BLT. We can split it?”
It was with one of the greatest efforts of his life that he pulled himself together, and continued towards his home.
Harry watched with great amusement as Severus literally shot out of the water. It must have been quite a shock, as the spell Harry used dropped the temperature of the water to something near freezing.
Draco looked down at their joined hands before looking back at Harry. “Sure.” He said, before lightly pulling his hand away and walking back up the stairs.
The finally arrived back on the western lawn and Harry collapsed onto the dewy grass. His shirt was soaked with sweat and he was sure he looked a mess, but he felt incredible. The rush of endorphins released when he exercised like this always caught him by surprise, and he couldn’t help but smile.
“I would be lying if I said I wasn’t upset, Mr. Potter, but I am not concerned about myself. In truth, I am far more worried about Draco. He is taking this extremely hard. His father was everything he aspired to be, and to see him murdered in front of him was… upsetting, to say the least.” Mrs. Malfoy said.
“Then I have failed you once again, Harry. I care a great deal about you and your well being, but I would never force you to stay with a
The car ride home was silent, save for Uncle Vernon talking very quietly to himself, something Harry had only heard him do when he nearly lost his mind trying to outrun very persistent owls, just weeks before Harry’s 11
He grabbed a knife and two plates, and proceeded to cut the sandwich, placing one half on each plate along with a handful of crisps. He handed Draco a plate and told him to dig in while he filled two glasses full of juice. He slid a glass to Draco when he had filled them and then sat down, tearing into his half with gusto.
get harder. But for now, I think you have earned some rest. Go shower and be with Draco.” He said. “Ah, before you go. Send one of your house-elves with a slip of parchment with the address here written down. I’ll go find Remus and bring him along. Meet us by the lake after lunch.”
Draco slowly dragged the pillow off his face and said, “There will be payback, darling. Sleep in fear!”
Harry let out a low chuckle before he replied. “Just surprised to find he isn’t pale and rail thin.”
close to his limb and suddenly, it wrapped itself tightly around his arm. It burned momentarily and Harry couldn’t hold back a small gasp of pain. He looked at Severus, then back down, and was shocked to see it fading, almost like it was being absorbed by his skin. He cast a worried look around, but everyone seemed calm. He looked back to his arm, but the
Harry woke up in his bed the next morning, pressed firmly against Draco and remembered two things. Draco had come to console him when he broke down last night. And two, he had stripped his soaking wet clothes off after helping Harry out of the shower and the two had gone to bed naked. Harry moved a fraction of an inch and could feel Draco’s member pressing against his butt.
“I am Meemy, Master Harry, sir,” Meemy replied, once again sinking into a low bow, “I have been here since as long as I can remember. I come from a long line of house-elves who have served the Potter family for many generations.”
She waited a moment before Harry’s third elf, Dizzy, apparated next to her and took over the cooking. Meemy disappeared and Harry watched as his house-elf expertly cooked their food. It was odd because Harry had rarely interacted with the elf, preferring instead to call on Meemy most of the time.
warmer level and Harry realized that he had probably been in a cold shower to begin with. The tears came harder, now, and they didn’t stop any time soon.
That was fifteen minutes ago and Harry still hadn’t moved from his chair. It wasn’t until Meemy spoke near his elbow and caused Harry to jump that he moved.
Harry was still chuckling when a hand rested on his shoulder and lightly squeezed. He looked up and saw Draco, who was sporting a grin.
“So, starting today, we will duel. In the sense that I will be casting curses, hexes, and jinxes at you, and you will either dodge, duck, shield, or otherwise protect yourself. And do not bother giving me that worried look; I have no intention of casting anything that would injure you… too much.” Severus said.
“Lucius, I require your assistance. I doubt you’re going to like what I ask of you, but I’ve got a feeling you’re going to help me anyways.” Severus said breathily.
“Let’s go for a walk. I’ll bring you up to speed.” Harry said, gesturing for Remus to lead the way, following as the man started walking around the edge of the lake.
“Yes, my son, it went very well. I have reconnected with my sister, Andromeda. In fact, if you’re willing, I’d like for you to meet her today.” Narcissa said.
Time slipped away from him as he Occluded, and he was surprised to see that it was almost pitch black when he opened his eyes. It didn’t matter though when this was something that he needed to do. He was satisfied with the results of his near meditation and stood up and stretched his aching muscles. It was definitely time for bed.
“Draco… I’m sorry that I left on such short notice, but I wasn’t sure how well I was going to be received where I was headed, and I didn’t want to risk your safety, so I figured it best to leave you here.” Narcissa said.
Draco held his breath, waiting for Harry to start pushing into him, then realized that all his muscles had tightened down, and he forced himself to breathe, doing his best to relax. He knew that Harry would stop if it was too much. He knew he had nothing to worry about.
Draco had his hands up Harry’s shirt, one hand in the middle of his back and the other running up and down his side. He moaned,
wasn’t strong enough, and he was hit by the laughing jinx. His wand was again disarmed, the laughing spell reversed, and another stinging hex hit him, his other arm this time.
Severus said nothing when he threw his wand back to him, and Harry was breathing a little heavy, just having had all his most ticklish spots hit at all once.
Draco positioned himself on his knees, looking Harry in the face. This caused Harry to frown. What was he doing?
“Since Master Harry’s arrival, of course. It would be amiss for a house-elf to not provide any assistance Master might need.” Meemy said, a look of slight indignation crossing her face.
“Oh, and one more thing Mrs. Malfoy, before I forget and you are unable to find the house again - Potter Manor is located at 212 Sampford Arundel, Somerset, UK.” Harry called after her.
“Mmm... yes. He’s been spending a fair amount of time with you in the sun and he’s always up early doing some kind of workout. I’m surprised you haven’t noticed yet.” Draco said.
“Mr. Potter. I arrived early this morning, hoping to catch you while you were still sleeping. I wanted to see the results of your time alone, and I was not disappointed.” Snape said, turning to look at Harry with an unreadable expression in his eyes.
Harry suddenly felt like he was going to be sick and bolted to the bathroom where he bent over the toilet, waiting for the contents of his stomach to make an appearance. He retched a few times and ended up spitting in the toilet, but the feeling passed, and he walked over to the tap after flushing the toilet. He turned the tap on and splashed some cold water on his face, wishing he could wash the image of Dumbledore’s blackened hand from his mind.
Severus. He even had a firm grip on Occlumency. Things were truly looking up, and he hoped that they continued to do so.
“I tried to go back for... for Lucius, but they blew up my house. They blew up my house and tried to kill me. I couldn’t reach him.” Severus said, his voice cracking towards the end.
Snape carefully lifted the boy, half picking him up, half standing him up, long enough to flick his wand at the chair, transforming it into a bed, which he then placed Harry on to. With another flick of his wand, Harry’s mangled shirt was banished, and allowed Severus to see fully the extent to which Harry had been hit with
“Yes, but I cannot say for how long your uncle will remain so. That, however, is entirely dependent on what type of man he is.” Severus answered.
Harry looked over at the bed and saw that Draco had stirred during their conversation. He looked around bleary-eyed until he saw Harry.
“Well, at least I’ll have some privacy here.” Harry thought, trying to keep his reservations about what he was doing in the back of his mind.
Dumbledore sat quietly for a moment. He seemed to be making a decision, but Severus was impatient. His nerves were already on edge, and he could feel the layers of the wards being obliterated by the Death Eaters who were currently attacking his house. He didn’t have time or patience for the older man’s usual stoicism.
Soooooo, the long awaited next chapter is here! I am so sorry it took so long, but I learned at a young age if you don't procrastinate now, it'll be too late, later... Or something like that. Anyways, I hope everyone enjoys this.
“I loved him! He was like a father to me, someone I could turn to when there was no one else, and now he’s gone. My best friends are gone. RON DIED BECAUSE OF ME! Hermi- Hermione still hasn’t recovered from whatever she was hit with… you don’t get to tell me about what happened, because I
Soooo... hi! Sorry that it's been like, 6 years since I uploaded a chapter. My life has been extremely busy, but I won't bore you with details. Please, enjoy this chapter, and cross your fingers that I am able to release another one soon. Happy Holidays (and a Happy New Year if I don't post before then)
When Draco had brought him to the room, he knew he was upset and was really in his head about things, but he thought that Draco would maybe cuddle him, tell him things were alright, and they would go on with things. Draco offering himself was… unexpected, to say the least. It not only dragged him out of the melancholy he was feeling, but he was well over the moon now. He knew he was smiling like a bit of a loon, but he didn’t care.
* indicating a house-elf was about to intrude on his space. He continued slowly ladling the potion he was working with into the vials he had spread out in front of him, waiting for the inevitable voice of the irritating creature to ask him for some ungodly favor. A few silent moments later, the elf spoke from somewhere near his right elbow, and if Severus wasn’t expecting it, and wasn’t trained so well to not show surprise, he would have jumped.
His arms were wrapped around Harry and Harry had eventually leaned heavily into Draco. They watched the life around the lake for a while; birds flying low over the water, occasional fish splashing, the soft breeze rustling the leaves on the trees. It was incredibly peaceful, and Harry’s eyelids had started to feel heavy. The last thing he thought about before he drifted off was how lucky he was to have found this place. To have found people he cared about. To have found
Harry was quite comfortable now that he had relaxed. He could feel each of his aching muscles and bruised part of his body, especially his knees, but he couldn’t find the motivation to care.
tickled. Harry was rock hard, a fact that Draco had to be aware of since they had both been sleeping naked.
Meemy and Nipsy popped in then, levitating two giant silver trays that were laden with buns, condiments, and a big bowl of chips. Harry’s mouth started watering again when he caught a whiff of vinegar radiating from the chips. Nipsy disappeared after setting the platter on the table and reappeared a moment later levitating plates for everyone.
After the brief feeling of being squeezed through a tube, he was indeed greeted by Dumbledore and two visitors. Narcissa and Draco stood regally behind Dumbledore, though Harry noticed the fresh tears in Draco’s eyes and slight cracks in his composure.
Harry was helpless to do anything, and he was pretty sure his uncle was serious, so he only nodded. He would only have one chance to scream for help, and he needed Vernon to think that he was about to let this happen. When his uncle released his throat, Harry did nothing except lay there, hoping he would see his resignation. This seemed to placate Vernon, who moved his hand from Harry’s throat, down Harry’s chest, to his crotch, where he greedily rubbed his hands over his groin. Harry could see his other hand in his pants, furiously stroking himself, before his uncle had flipped him on to his stomach, and roughly started pulling his pants down.
He walked quickly to his study, intent on moving the Malfoy’s as soon as he got a message to the headmaster. He froze when he walked through the door, however. His eyes were locked on Narcissa and Draco. Narcissa was sitting up so straight, Severus had to wonder how she did it; her face betrayed no sign that she was anything other than cool and passive. Draco was doing his best, and failing slightly, to imitate his mother.
“Yeah… Sorry if that was too much, or too forward. I have spent the past few days trying to make up my mind about how you felt about me. I came to the conclusion that we shared a mutual attraction, and well… I don’t like to play games.” Draco said.
Severus carefully isolated the memories where Harry was abused by his uncle and started quietly chanting, “
He gave a start when he realized that Draco had woken up sometime during his internal thinking, and he stared back in the beautiful grey eyes that had a questioning look to them.
Mrs. Malfoy gave him a small smile and swept out of the kitchen, making her way down the hall and towards the garden room that would allow her access to the deck that sat at the back of the house.
Harry could sense Snape in his mind and redoubled his efforts to maintain the steel around his mind. He could feel the Professor poking around, trying to find a spot that he could attack, but after trying for a few moments, he gave up and broke contact.
True to her word, Harry had waited no longer than ten minutes before he was tucking into a plate of steaming meats and potatoes, and had just finished half his plate when he heard the cracks of apparition outside.
Harry laughed and pulled Draco down for a kiss. He was surprised to find that Draco’s breath was minty fresh. He pulled away and commented on it.
He still harbored contempt and resentment for his aunt and cousin, but it was nothing like what he had for Vernon. Perhaps one day he could sit down and have a civil conversation with them – without Vernon present. Harry was sure that he’d never be able to be in the same room with the man, let alone have a conversation with him. Even with Occlumency, he’d never be able to control himself.
“At the end of every school year, I go back to the Dursley’s. My mom's sister, Petunia, and her husband, Vernon, agreed to take me in after my parents were murdered. Take me in, not take care of me. The Dursley’s told me that my parents had died in a car accident after my father decided to drive drunk. They never told me that I was a wizard, and called me a freak whenever I did accidental magic. I thought there was something wrong with me, Draco. And because of that, I never questioned their punishment. I thought they were trying to fix me.
He looked around at the people at the table. Dumbledore had that serene look, Narcissa seemed to be waiting for something, Severus looked bored, though Harry knew that was when he was most interested in something, and Draco looked slightly jealous but also extremely happy for him.
After a quick check to make sure no one was around, Lucius and Severus left the tunnel and bolted down the hallway, wrenching the solitary door open at the end. They started taking the steps two at a time until they reached the bottom, turning left to follow the stone corridor that would lead them to Draco and Narcissa. They had only been following their path for a few moments before they heard a scream, followed by yelling, followed by eerie silence.
He noted that the room itself was painted in a deep red, maybe merlot or currant? There were two chairs sitting next to a large window to the left of the room, which Harry assumed overlooked part of the grounds. Continuing along the left wall led his eyes to a door, a few feet from the door that Meemy had brought him through the night before. He continued to skim his eyes around the room, seeing that to the right of the room, there was a fireplace, with a loveseat and comfortable looking armchair, both set in shades of deep red, sitting directly in front of it. Further to the right of the room was another door, which led to who knew where. As he was sitting there looking around, Harry’s bladder made itself uncomfortably known, and he needed to know where the bathroom was.
Meemy clapped her hands once. “Perfect idea, Master. We’ll get started right away.” She disappeared with a crack.
“We should go and clean up before dinner. I don’t want to smell like lake water when we’re eating.” Draco said.
that you have shown you can be. I don’t have any questions. I trust what you are telling me, and anything left out I am sure I will learn about in the future. My wand is yours to command.” Remus stated.
Harry did as Snape told him and spent the next 3 days in almost total solitude. Every waking moment he focused on keeping the ball of steel in place around his thoughts and memories. From an outsiders view, it would look like Harry was meditating; his legs crossed and back straight as he sat in the middle of his room; he wanted to keep this mutual respect that he had going between Snape and himself, so he was going to master this. He didn’t leave his self-imposed solitude and only allowed the house elves to bring him food, giving them warning that he wasn’t to be disturbed when they did so.
“Would you mind telling me where things are around here? I need the loo.” Harry said, squirming slightly.
Harry sped through his shower and was dressed in record time. He chose simple muggle clothing for today, figuring that since he would be outside, having full wizard attire on would only become hot and bothersome. When he was finished pulling his trainers on, Harry grabbed his wand and left the room, rushing towards the stairs in a hurry to get some food and start on practice. It wasn’t until he collided with someone coming up the stairs that he attempted to slow down – only, it was too late.
“I think I should warn you… Though caution might be a better word here, but... I just want you to be prepared for what may or may not be in your vaults at Gringotts. I think I can garner a guess as to what you’re hoping to find there, and I honestly do not think that Lily and James had time to commission a portrait to be made… And honestly, pup, even if they did, well… You have to spend time with it, as it’s more of an impression of who you were, than an automatic magical capture. I know it sounds a little, bizarre, I guess. But I don’t know, Harry. I just don’t want to see you get your hopes up and then be let down.” Remus explained.
He had turned on his heel was headed out of the kitchen before Harry remembered he made a promise to tell Draco where Narcissa had gone.
“We were married, but it was simply for him to fulfill the duty of continuing the Malfoy line. To the outside world, we were a happily married couple, but we were nothing more than close friends behind closed doors. Lucius’ heart did not belong to me.
“I can ask nothing more of you, Mr. Potter.” She said and turned to leave, before a thought seemed to occur to her.
Harry had his question answered rather abruptly when Draco was extremely close, extremely fast. Harry could have sworn that he phased into his personal space, but suddenly, all of that didn’t matter. Draco had leaned forward another two inches and he was kissing him. It took Harry a full five seconds to process what was happening, and he could feel the hesitation and worry coming from Draco. In fact, the other boy had started to pull back when Harry realized what was going on.
They had her, and she knew it. Alecto was a good duelist, but she was no match for both of them together. She looked desperately around for anything that could help her win, and saw Lucius with his back turned, helping Draco into the fireplace. She smiled viciously and turned her wand on him.
Draco faked a very put upon sigh and rolled away from Harry before he spoke. “Only together for a couple of days and you’re already leaving me for someone else.”
“I’ve been contemplating the best way to train you since I set you the task of learning how to cast nonverbally, and I have decided that we will start with honing your reflexes first. From now until your birthday, this will be our main area of focus, and I think the best way for you to achieve results would be to duel with me. Not in a traditional sense, but I want you under pressure when we train.
This only seemed to make it worse for Draco, who finally bust out into a laugh. Harry stared at him waspishly until he couldn’t suppress the soft laughs that wanted to escape.
Whaaaaaaat? Another chapter so soon? I've been writing A LOT at work, and I (hope) that it doesn't come across sloppy. If it does, please tell me in the comments and I'll stop writing at work. I usually go back and reference a bunch of things, making sure I don't mix something up, but I don't have that ability at work, so I've just been going off memory... Anyways, hope you like it!
Vernon’s eyes fell to his wand and he fell silent, casting worried glances from Petunia to Severus to the wand in a rapid cycle.
Hello everyone! It's been (almost) 3 months since I uploaded, and for that, I'm terribly sorry. I was moving from Alaska to California, and I cannot even begin to describe how much of an adventure THAT was. Short chapter here, only about 2k words, but I should be able to keep these coming (I do start a new job on Wednesday, so we'll see) but I will not be abandoning this fic. Thanks for reading, and thanks even more for those of you who continue to leave comments and kudos. I love you all!!!
Harry groaned in his sleep, rolling to his side as he did so. His head was spinning, so he took a few sleepy breaths before slowly cracking his eyes open to try and figure out what the issue was. What he saw made his eyes fly open, and in his shock, he attempted to sit up quickly, regretting the action almost immediately as the left side of his body seemed to burn with the action. However, sitting in front of him was none other than his head of house, Severus Snape. What was he doing here?! How did Snape find him? Then, with sudden clarity, Harry remembered what had happened when he ventured out of the manor that morning. The Death Eaters, the duel, his subsequent injuries…
