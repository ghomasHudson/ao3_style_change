And so they didn't beat her up or make fun of her. It took a while, but by the time her eleventh birthday rolled around, Dudley no longer stomped by her room to wake her up or trip her when she was walking. She slowly established herself as a part of the friend group and hung around with them in the neighbourhood.
There were the good parts, though. There was catching the snitch in the quidditch matches, and studying in the library with her friends. There was gently steering Ron clear of Lavender, and Hermione's smile when she did it. (She could tell that Lavender and Parvati were meant to be together anyway.)
“At least one, maybe two or three,” Harry answered. “Not for another year, though. I want to soak up every moment of bliss that we can get.”
"You have
Draco hoisted himself onto the counter and cracked the eggs, discarding the eggshells and beating the eggs in the bowl.
"Yes please."
She helped Sirius escape but wasn't nearly as eager to jump to live with him. "My brother said he would practice his boxing moves on you if you ever hurt me," she said as he mounted Buckbeak. "I'm sure he's gotten better since I last saw him."
Ara stuck her tongue out at him. "Let me get my shoes and we'll see."
Harry suddenly whipped his head back to Draco. “Do you want to see them? Andromeda, Teddy, and your mother.”
Though Harry never said anything about it unless asked, he always felt much better after talking to someone. Draco was always willing to be that person, but no matter how many times he told that to Harry, he never said anything unless asked.
“Why don’t you just use sleakeasy’s hair potion? Honestly, Potter, your grandfather invented the bloody potion. Most of wizarding Europe uses it. I know you
The occupants of the room felt his magic flare out and settle down sealing the bond. He held up his wand. “Lumos.” Potter's magic felt comfortable and familiar, like sitting in front of a fire or being caught in the wind while flying.
“Okay, guys!” Granger was perched on one of the tables, with her wand in the air. She looked slightly tipsy, her dark cheeks flushed and her eyes glassy from the firewhiskeys that she had consumed.
"Professor," Harry said, approaching the red bench where Dumbledore was sitting. He was wearing his purple robe, the one with silver stars on it, but Harry noticed that there was no twinkle in his eyes. Instead, they looked a bit sad.
He had Apparated directly to Harry's from that man's place. The man, like most of them, had been old enough to be his grandfather. In many ways, he reminded Draco of Abraxas, with his white hair and kind look - then the look disappeared as soon as they entered the chamber, replaced with lust and greed. He wanted Draco, and not in a grandfatherly way.
"Maybe, but at least it won't be two wrongs, right?" Dumbledore chided gently.
The words were said in a confused tone, but Draco knew it was only a front. Dread started to spread inside him. Harry knew, or at least, he suspected something.
Unfortunately, the new Harry was not. Harry used to be the boy hero who saw everything through rose tinted glasses. Only, Draco knew that the rose tinted glasses had long ago been lost and broken. So maybe Harry really did think that ex-Death Eaters were nothing but dirt.
Hermione almost didn't hear those words spoken. It was a crescent moon that night and there were no street lamps around, but she would recognize that whitish golden hair anywhere.
In retrospect, Harry shouldn't have fought the Ministry for the ex-Potion Master's portrait to be installed in the Headmaster's office. Dumbledore was an exception, but Harry couldn't stand that knowing twinkling that his painter had somehow successfully emulated in the portrait's eyes. It was as if he could see all of Harry's secrets and read his deepest thoughts all over again.
Harry shook his head.
Damn that media! He had tried to shelter his kids from the news about circumstances surrounding their mother's death. Only, when you were Harry Potter and even your favorite color was front page material, there was no way around it.
"Cut it, Malfoy."
"Oh, Harry."
Scorpius lifted his head from Draco's chest and shook his head resolutely.
There was a tug on his heart. Pity, maybe, or it could be guilt. On reflection, his own words to Malfoy before, about how the only skill Malfoy had was to become a whore, seemed unnecessarily cruel.
But Draco knew how it would be. People would soon make up some crime or another that his family allegedly had done. His parents and he would be sent to Azkaban, and the Ministry would put his son into an orphanage.
"Did she? Hmm, I always knew she was a smart witch." Dumbledore smiled.
Hermione didn't say anything. She just stared at him, as if trying to read him.
Draco was opening his mouth. Harry didn't know what he would say, and he realized he didn't care.
"Good. I will tell him to come to Grimmauld at midnight tomorrow. You got twenty-four hours, the usual rules."
"And why did you choose to work for me?"
With a sudden insight, Draco realized that on some level of her consciousness, Granger must have known that Harry had changed. She just didn't want to admit it, choosing to turn a blind eye instead. He wondered what kind of justification she had used to convince herself.
From where she was, she couldn't see his face and he wore a hooded coat to cover his hair. He knocked at the door and waited for a few moments before it opened to show her the head of Department of Magical Games and Sports, Abelard Raith.
Unfortunately, it also brought back the thoughts about what he had been reduced to do to provide it, and worse, what he was cornered to do.
Suddenly, she realized in her musing that she had reached Harry's office. She lifted up her hand, prepared to knock, when she saw that the door was not closed completely and there was someone inside with Harry.
It didn't matter that some triggers had to be executed before the dormant infection woke up. It didn't matter that said Mediwizard couldn't even state yet what were the required conditions. People panicked. They were afraid.
Suddenly, she realized in her musing that she had reached Harry's office. She lifted up her hand, prepared to knock, when she saw that the door was not closed completely and there was someone inside with Harry.
"You can always refuse."
"I am sorry," said the other man, his voice low.
"So, have you thought about it?" There was a mocking tone in Harry's voice. After all, they both knew that viewing the situation as some form of choice was a joke. Harry put the tea in front of the sitting man who was steadfastly looking at the table. His hair hung lank, hiding his entire face from Harry. His posture, which used to be straight and proud, was hunched.
"I'll give you three days to think about it, but no more."
Draco shivered and pushed the bell beside Harry's door. It was raining and he didn't feel like casting an Impervious Charm.
Then there was Astoria. He had loved her. He may not have been in love with her; maybe he loved her like a sister rather than a lover, but he loved her nonetheless.
He released her from the hug but kept his arms on her shoulders. She seemed tired, he observed, tired and sad.
Harry was no stranger to dreams, especially nightmares. He categorized his nightmares into three different groups: memories induced, reflection of impossible hopes, and Voldemort's hand-me-downs. So, when he found himself on King Cross just as soon as he felt asleep, he was not surprised.
Harry tightened his hold. “Someday.”
She had hoped, that with time, the pain of losing Ginny would be lessened, that Harry would stop throwing himself to work. Apparently, it was a futile wish.
Just like he had never noticed how beautiful they were, bags and dark circles and all. He had, he realized, never taken the time to appreciate the body in front of him.
A small part of Draco gave a gleeful smirk on seeing her flabbergasted expression. Her eyes had become comically big and for a moment, she forgot to close her mouth.
Draco recognized the look in Harry's eyes, the one that said that he knew his words were the absolute truth and there was nothing that could convince him otherwise. That look used to irritate him at Hogwarts, since it was the look that also said 'Draco Malfoy is nothing but an evil git and we should foil his plans.' He had learned to admire the look later, when it was translated into 'Voldemort is evil and I will defeat him regardless of the risk' and 'now the war is over we can make a better world.' The second one was a bit too naïve for him, but he did admire Harry's bravery to hope and believe. In fact, if he were to be honest, the look was one of the reasons for his crush. Yet at that moment, he just felt empty.
"I saw you yesterday."
"What's the difference? They let the Death Eaters go. They put away those that were infected by Werewolves or even those that they suspected as infected. The Ministry was still practically owned by the same people and groups."
"I did what I had to do!"
"There are other ways, Harry," he added.
Draco hid his face in his hand. He couldn't believe he just poured out his soul to Granger of all people. Maybe the loneliness had gotten to him. His old friends, after all, either in Azkaban, death, or didn't want anything to do with him anymore.
"Am I?" Dumbledore smiled. Absently, Harry noted that the twinkles had come back to his eyes.
"Where are the kids?" Hermione asked, looking around.
Someday was a word of threat, shouted in anger and hatred, a promise of retribution to come.
He was desperate, begging for job at the new bookstore on Hogsmead when Harry found him.
Yes, he was too cowardly to kill, wasn't he? But he was also too much of a bigoted jerk for him to defect to the light side. Draco Malfoy, always a failure.
"Rumor has it that the Greengrasses had a kid that had been bitten to death by a werewolf. And the Brookses had been a staunch hater of werewolves. Not to mention the Radleys have a grandson that was turned into a werewolf. He couldn't handle the stress of transformation though, and killed himself three months later. Afterwards, they treated Werewolves as the embodiments of evil. "
"I can't do it. If it makes you throw my mother out of St. Mungo, then so be it. I know I need the money, but I became your whore for my family. How can I do something that clearly will destroy them? People hate my family. The new law you proposed will give them opportunity to put my family in Azkaban, even on the basis of some imaginary offense."
"What?"
If he were to be honest, it gave him a bit of a thrill, seeing the other man like this, miserable and in Harry's power. It had been a year since he found Malfoy and on impulse, decided to offer him the job, but it still felt like a novelty for him.
"Do you want me to just stay silent and let them do whatever they want to do, Hermione? Even after Ginny? After Teddy?"
Someday was a word of bitter regret and self-delusion, spoken to create an illusion about a tomorrow that would never come.
He should have known Dumbledore would bring Malfoy up.
She deserved better, Harry thought. She deserved more respect than what she got, she deserved more recognition. She should have risen through the ranks of the Ministry, instead of being lumped with dull, tedious work. She scared the higher ups, he knew, with her tenacity and spirit for change and ability. One day...
Ginny. She had been so young, so happy. She wore her hair in a ponytail in those days and Harry loved to play with it while she rested her head on his shoulder.
Harry loved the sofa he sat on. It was beige, and comfortable, and modest, and most importantly, they had chosen it together, he and Ginny, when they first moved into Godrics Hollow. He remembered them hopping from shop to shop, looking for new furniture to decorate their equally new home. Harry never knew shopping could be so much fun before that day.
Her face was becoming paler but Draco couldn't stop himself.
She sighed.
"Am I?" Dumbledore smiled. Absently, Harry noted that the twinkles had come back to his eyes.
He had thought about it over and over these last few days.
Harry recognized him as another Slytherin, although his voice was less sure than his friend.
"Hush, listen. I am not saying that I love you. I am not promising that I will. But, I want to try."
Harry's comment came unbidden into his mind. Was it true? Would Scorpius be better off with another family?
"But the means to the end also used to be important for you, Harry! Do you remember how Dumbledore always said that love was your strongest weapon? But you are now driven by hatred."
"Of course, Hermione." Harry straightened on the couch and hid away the glass. He was not in the mood for Hermione's lecture.
Harry never knew, before his and Malfoy's agreement, he could be drunk on power. Even killing Voldemort hadn't made him feel like this. He felt hot and excited. He supposed it was like getting drunk on firewhisky, only better and without the hangover.
"Don't bring Harry into this. This must have been your idea somehow."
The words seemed rehearsed. Clearly, Malfoy had thought it over.
"I saw you yesterday."
Hermione had been loitering around Number 12 Grimmauld Place for half an hour, Polyjuiced as a punk girl, when she saw a man approaching the house. Casually, to avoid attracting attention, she walked nearer and hid behind the black car on the neighboring house's lawn.
She knew he was using blackmail and gathering favors. Hell, she had been involved in some of them herself.
It should not be like this, he thought bitterly. They had saved the Wizarding world, hadn't they? They had earned their happily ever after. Or maybe he should just stop being a fool.
"I know. I saw you with Abelard Raith."
"And what is the benefit for me in your little scheme?"
Draco shivered and pushed the bell beside Harry's door. It was raining and he didn't feel like casting an Impervious Charm.
He still could feel the old man's greedy hands pawing at him, his forceful lips at his. He still could hear his mocking voice in his ears.
"I have a bad enough day without a figment of my imagination giving me lectures," Harry grumbled.
"Well, maybe he was, but it was yesterday's news. He's old now, after all," dismissed the first one readily.
"So? That's the only word you can say? What is your game, Malfoy? What are you planning to do? And don't tell me you have no scheme, because I won't believe it."
"I...I...," Malfoy stuttered.
Draco wondered how fucked up it was, that even after everything, he was still in love with his jailer.
"Honestly Hermione, you made it seem like a big deal."
"So you decided to talk in the languages they understand: blackmail, bribery, favors," Dumbledore said.
"I'm sorry," he said, startling the other man.
He had, over the years, dreamed about it now and then. He dreamed that he was there and instead of Dumbledore, there were his parents and Sirius and Remus. He dreamed that the train came and Ginny was coming out of it, wearing a big smile on her face. He dreamed that they were all standing at the platform, Ginny and him, James and Albus, waiting for Lily to come home from Hogwarts for the last time.
Harry shook his head. He couldn't lose hope. After all, the proposal, when it passed into law, would bring Teddy back to them.
The selection was a joke, really. All the proposals had to be examined first by a special committee, supposedly to save the Wizengamot's time. Only those that were deemed suitable would be presented to said Wizengamot. Yet, what was the use of perusing the proposal first, if there was no guarantee it would be accepted anyway? Moreover, what was the use of pretending to consider it, if most of the time the decision had been made in advance?
Harry rubbed his eyes; they were grainy and burned when he blinked. Every time Lily had the nightmare, he ended up with his own sleepless night. The Healers at St. Mungos had said that it was normal for kids to have nightmares about traumatic events in their lives. Kids have great imaginations, and sometimes they could imagine scarier scenarios than what had actually happened. Still, it shouldn't last for two years, should it?
"It is not enough, though. I loved Ginny and she died. I loved Teddy and the Ministry took him away," Harry said bitterly, flopping down to sit beside Dumbledore again.
Harry had said that it would keep the Wizarding world safer, that sometimes, things like technicality and lack of proofs had made it possible for criminals to escape justice. And Harry had argued that once a Death Eater, always a Death Eater. After all, if you could kill once, who could guarantee you wouldn't do it again?
Malfoy, no, Harry reminded himself, Draco, looked up. Confusion was plain on his face.
"Listen to me. I know that you were devastated by Ginny's death, but this is not you, Harry."
"Is that your only reason? Because I don't believe it, Malfoy."
They would stop at Fortescue's afterwards. He never chose the same flavor twice, determined to taste each and every one of them, but Ginny always had a strawberry sundae.
He blinked his tears away. So much for not making his mother worried.
And there was Malfoy, sitting on the floor, looking up at him and telling him over and over, "You are Voldemort, Harry."
"Like you said, you need me."
"She put it all together by herself."
"It won't guarantee that we will win..." Harry said.
He had lost so much. How could Harry ask him to sacrifice his family?
Besides, there was something about sleeping with Harry afterward. It made him feel cleaner than taking a bath.
Draco was quite proud that he could maintain his usual polite but detached voice. He felt so tired and sleepy and depressed; the only thing he wanted at the moment was for Granger to go home and leave him in peace.
Still, on the other hand, it also made it harder for them to control him, since he was not directly under their supervision.
"But it made you just the same as them, Harry."
"You don't think this is a big deal? I can't believe this!"
Without waiting for an answer, he proceeded to tell Granger about it in great detail. And when he saw her face slowly lose its color, a part of him felt strangely glad. Apparently, someone, however unwilling, could still give a damn about him.
"Harry, I told you before that it is our choices that made us who we are. You know, Muggles have a saying that two wrongs don't make a right."
"It's all Malfoy's fault."
Draco recognized the look in Harry's eyes, the one that said that he knew his words were the absolute truth and there was nothing that could convince him otherwise. That look used to irritate him at Hogwarts, since it was the look that also said 'Draco Malfoy is nothing but an evil git and we should foil his plans.' He had learned to admire the look later, when it was translated into 'Voldemort is evil and I will defeat him regardless of the risk' and 'now the war is over we can make a better world.' The second one was a bit too naïve for him, but he did admire Harry's bravery to hope and believe. In fact, if he were to be honest, the look was one of the reasons for his crush. Yet at that moment, he just felt empty.
"Some days, I think the war was all in vain," he added bitterly, averting his eyes and looking at the ground.
"It makes more progress than the other way."
"I don't know you anymore, Harry." There was no anger left on her voice. Her tone was just plain sad.
Harry hadn't heard about him for years, until one day he was suddenly back in England and standing on Hogwarts' door step.
There was a taunt in Harry's voice and a look of conviction on his face.
Worse, he realized that there were way too many skeletons in the Malfoy closet. There was a lot of fodder for insult and mockery that even an unimaginative child could easily dig up.
Still, Harry felt that if he just could explain it, Dumbledore would surely see it his way.
Harry glared at him.
"So you decided to talk in the languages they understand: blackmail, bribery, favors," Dumbledore said.
Scorpius. He wished he could give him all the luxuries and privileges he had been given as a kid. Instead, the only thing he gave his son was a family name that would close doors for Scorpius.
"If I help you, I request immunity for my family. There must be a way we can develop a mutually beneficial relationship."
The Ministry took Teddy and the fight to protect Werewolves' rights became personal for Harry.
Draco had just knocked on the door when he was pulled inside and pushed against the wall by a furious Harry. Harry's green eyes were bright and he put his hands on the wall, trapping Draco inside them.
"There are other ways, Harry," he added.
Harry detected a hopeful tone in Malfoy's voice. He could sense that the bravado on display was a fake, though. Malfoy hated to show weaknesses. He thought that showing strength would make the opponent think that you couldn't be intimidated. It was too bad for him that they both knew exactly who was in control. Harry's inner self was cheering.
Then there was Astoria. He had loved her. He may not have been in love with her; maybe he loved her like a sister rather than a lover, but he loved her nonetheless.
"I won't do it."
Harry thought that maybe in his mind, King Cross had become an equivalent of the Mirror of Erised.
He had said that he had missed England, and apparently – to the surprise of no one – nobody in England had wanted to give him a job. He also had waxed a touching tale about how he had always regretted what he had done that night, allowing Death Eater's into the school and all, and how he had wanted to give something to the school to show his remorse.
"I should have seen it, but you are my best friend and turning a blind eye is easier. You are colder, less inclined to forgive. The Harry I knew used to act first, to help even an enemy. Remember how you helped Malfoy from the Fiendfyre? Now, everything has to be calculated first for your benefit. You used to argue for justice, for equal treatment!"
"Trust me Granger; this is even a worse punishment. I have a depressed father that rarely comes out of his rooms anymore, a sick mother that will have to depend on potions all her life, and a kid. On the other hand, I also have an empty vault."
Aralynn pulled out the black heir's ring from where it had been hanging around her neck. "I claimed it a year ago. I'll make it public once his name is cleared."
Hermione beamed.
“You are not a burden,” he told Harry firmly. “You can always tell me what’s bothering you, Harry.
To his credit, his husband had only smiled at Teddy and set the then-toddler Lissa down in favor of hugging them.
"Right," she said. "There's no use pretending that he isn't. Allegiances aside, we
He had needed to take a moment to lean against someone and Draco was perfectly willing to give it to him.
“I know Hermione chose the location.” He said. Draco stopped moving his fingers, looking tiredly up at Harry.
Draco still froze whenever he saw a pretty necklace, and he clawed at his Dark Mark in his sleep. But Ara was there to distract him, and to move his other arm so that it he wasn't hurting himself.
Potter nodded once. “Yes.”
“You realize these things when you spend enough time with someone. You don’t know the little things about your parents, because no one ever told you. They glorify the dead, Harry. You don’t know their faults because everyone wants to have a perfect image of them in your mind. Teddy has you to tell him about Professor Lupin and my cousin.”
"Did I?" He asked, feigning nonchalance. "I can't seem to recall doing so, how terrible."
"You think they'll finally admit their feelings to each other?" Blaise murmured as they danced together.
He had gotten more comfortable with it now, with the multiple Weasley children, his goddaughter Dominique included. He and Fleur had bonded, being French-speaking and blond among the chaos of the Weasleys.
Today, as he walked through the ministry a few days later, he saw his hand getting a few looks, but no one approached him.
Draco sighed, turning to face Harry and looping arm around his neck. They were on break for another thirty minutes anyway. “I know, I’ve seen it all five years. You knew she would get back at you some way. And I do think this is Susan’s doing, she looked annoyed today morning.”
"He loves you, you know," Draco nearly choked on his tea. Pansy's dark eyes glinted at him in amusement.
To see his childhood home, his safe haven to be so horrendously mutilated, to see
Luna pulled a few more apples from their bag. "I know you want to go to him."
Harry’s grip on his shoulder tightened. “It was meant to be a surprise. Look at it properly.”
“Hmm?” Draco asked. He was exhausted. First the wedding, then the flight, and then his first time taking his husband to bed. His fingers continued moving, nails scratching lightly over a love bite on Harry’s collarbone.
The circle erupted in cheers and laughter at that, leaving Draco slightly stunned, but he joined them in taking one last shot before the group broke up.
Ara had helped Susan with a herbology assignment twice last year. Slytherins weren't the only ones who repaid favours.
"She isn't a freak, mum." He assured. "She's just a girl."
going to regret this in the morning.
"No, no, we can't put any dye in. Ginny sent me a list of the foods she can eat pre-season when she started dragging me into her workouts. She won’t eat any if there's dye in it."
"Ara," Theo gasped. "It's not what you think-"
"Have a nice summer."
“Malfoy,” he said in greeting, before opening the door and walking in. Draco hesitantly walked in. Potter was kneeling in front of his trunk, gathering what looked like bath supplies from it.
, that would be awkward.
Quick strikes and fast-moving.
"I see a common theme in your school years," Dudley said one day at the boxing gym. Sirius had been cleared the week earlier, and he had spent the last five days in St. Mungos. "Your headmaster being a meddling old fool."
She cut the floo call and Draco sat back on the floor, mind swimming with all the new information. He would look for the youngest Potter first thing tomorrow. She would undoubtedly be there earlier as an apprentice, and he had seen her face two days ago which should make it easier to identify her.
When she ran into platform 9 3/4, her Dad by her side, a flurry of movement caught her eye. The entire Weasley Clan had come to see the children off. She could see Teddy and Victoire, the engagement ring on Victoire’s left hand catching the light as she waved her hands around while speaking.
“Thank you. I feel a little better after this.”
"I would absolutely love to explain this to you," he said, not sounding like he wanted to explain anything to him at
Draco slipped into the auditorium where Potter would be instructing, finally having found the room after a few hours of sneaking around. Ilvermorny had a pretty solid security system, and the only thing allowing Draco in was his ID card from the British Ministry.
He had often felt restless and fidgety and ended up in the hospital more than he was comfortable with.
have the energy to talk, at least not until he had some food in him.
She heard a few cheers from her godfather in the crowd.
That had been in October, and he got drunk enough that he didn’t remember much of what happened. He remembered apologising, crying (not just by him), and a lot of heart-to-hearts from all of them. It hadn’t been pretty.
“Thank you for your testimony, Mr. Potter,” the interrogator said, and Potter nodded at her before walking back up to his seat, footsteps echoing in the silence of the courtroom. She looked at Draco before speaking. “The wizengamot shall keep in mind Mr. Potter’s testimony in the matter of Draco Malfoy. The court will now discuss Mr. Malfoy’s punishment for his crimes.”
It was the happiest day of his life.
“Oh, shut up, you try dealing with hair like mine before saying anything.” Harry sounded like a petulant teenager, which, Draco realized, he
Both Harry and Draco thought it was a wonderful idea.
Draco then realized that he had taken off his outer robes and was wearing a t-shirt underneath, the edge of what he had thought was a tattoo poking through.
He paused, looking at the face of his husband, tucked comfortably against him, his phoenix tattoo glinting on his bare back.
"I'm still figuring it all out," she said softly as they bowed to each other. He held a hand out and she put hers in it, slightly stunned when he pressed a cool kiss to her knuckles.
Aster nearly shrieked with joy, wrapping her arms around her dad. He laughed, hugging her back, and leaned down until he was at her height.
When Draco reached home after a long day of work, he usually knew what he was coming home to. His husband, if he had gotten off work earlier. His nephew, goddaughter, or any other of the Weasley children. One of his friends maybe, if they had the day off.
soul stuck in his head, I'd say you need me. Besides, I have Regulus' notes."
He shook his head. "Leave," he repeated.
"I'll do my best," she promised. Uncle Vernon didn't say anything to her, only shaking her hand before leaving out the door. It was only her and Aunt Petunia left.
"Whenever the kids at school brought up that I didn't have parents, I always shot them down. Mum and dad may have died when I was a baby, but I never grew up without a dad. I had a dad in every way that counted. I know I don't have to thank you, Harry. But you were always there. Aster doesn't know how lucky she is. She has you and uncle Draco as parents."
Ara cracked a smile at that. Ginny was scary enough on her own, add a badge and green trimmed robes, and well- no junior would cross her.
He resisted the ridiculous urge to reach over and trace his fingers over it.
When Hermione Granger was crying in the bathroom, Ara went alone. She knew what it was like to not have friends. She sat outside while the other girl spoke softly from inside the stall.
, who he loved more than everyone else in the world.
“Andromeda and Teddy will be here any moment, they both wanted to see you and Malfoy” he finished, awkwardly rubbing his neck.
He scoffed. "We came together for the image," he jutted his chin to the side, where Pansy was dancing with a Slytherin girl the year above them. "I'm not her type."
Ara could see Aunt Petunia hiding a frown behind her magazine.
Draco felt a pang in his chest. “The combined forces of my mother, Aunt Andromeda, and Mrs. Weasley will be devastated.”
“Meet up at 2 for lunch?” Draco asked after tightening the tie against his collar.
His family, his home.
Harry looked up at the screen separating them, inclining his head towards the door.
Harry just nodded, looking at Draco with the kind of intensity that made his chest ache. Draco reached forward and ran a hand through Harry's hair one last time, feeling the coarse strands between his fingers.
He let himself smile back hesitantly, “Call me Draco,” he said, and turned around and walked out.
Sirius shook his head. “You were
It had been
Draco smiled at her, pushing his chair back and throwing back the rest of his coffee.
needed to explain Teddy's lack of control of his hair colour, and Harry decided that it was godfather's duty.
"It's a protean charm," her friend explained, flipping the coin over in her hands.
The guards were the ones who,
Harry laughed, and they separated, Teddy slowly walking towards them with his fingers covering his eyes. “Grandma says I’m here for the week, so
"Yes, Malfoy, I know that he's in Malfoy Manor."
sorry.”
“You told me all of that,” Harry said, long used to Draco’s antics. “And I know Mione wouldn’t let us go somewhere where gay sex is illegal,”
He blinked his tears away. So much for not making his mother worried.
Still, Dumbledore, Harry decided, must be barmy. How could he even begin to compare Ginny with Malfoy? Besides, there was no way he could love Malfoy, not even if he wanted to, which he didn't.
"Albus and James are with Molly, and Lily is sleeping upstairs. She is running a big fever. Last night, well, she had that nightmare again."
That was the truth, if not the entire truth.
If he were to be honest, it gave him a bit of a thrill, seeing the other man like this, miserable and in Harry's power. It had been a year since he found Malfoy and on impulse, decided to offer him the job, but it still felt like a novelty for him.
"Still, it is not like Harry is putting you at wand point."
When he didn't hear her reply, he looked up at her.
"Nobody else will hire me."
"But isn't he famous for defeating that Voldemort guy? The books said he's powerful," asked the second one, also in a whisper.
"Oh that. He came to asked me about security plan for the coming Quidditch match." Harry smiled. The lie came out easily.
He should have realized that it would make Harry hate him more.
What was wrong with Harry?
"I think you misunderstand me, Malfoy. I am not giving you a choice." There was a smirk on Harry's lips. Somehow, no matter how many times Draco had seen it, it still struck him as wrong. There should never be a smirk on Harry's lips.
And just like that, he saw her deflate in an instant. The worry lines were back on her face and a haunted look entered her eyes. She put her book on the side table and sighing, took a seat beside him.
Still, perhaps it was because Malfoy thought that Harry was that stupid he would fall for the lie nonetheless, since Harry had seen how Malfoy dealt with the Ministry's paranoid workers, and he knew for a fact that Malfoy could do it with straight face.
Harry glared at him.
Then, he looked at Malfoy's eyes, and suddenly he knew that it was true.
"You know, I wonder, why do you sleep with me? After all, I don't pay you for that, do I?"
Harry tightened his arms.
It had taken the ministry an entire year to decide whether the request was worth presenting to be voted on by the Wizengamot. He had thought that maybe he would have to give them more bribes.
"Trust me Granger; this is even a worse punishment. I have a depressed father that rarely comes out of his rooms anymore, a sick mother that will have to depend on potions all her life, and a kid. On the other hand, I also have an empty vault."
"Don't blame me for your perverted tendency, Malfoy,"
She knew, Harry thought. Suddenly, his chest felt heavy and it was hard to breathe, yet at the same time, it felt like a burden had lifted from his shoulders. He didn't need to lie and do things in secret around her anymore.
"Keep in touch," she told Professor Lupin as they left that year. "Now that we have proof of Pettigrew in custody, we should be able to clear his name. Daphne said she'll send me a book about legal procedure, and I can raise a motion in the wizengamot now that I'm his heir."
"You're doing the right thing," Ginny said.
He was beyond thankful that at twenty, he was finally living comfortably, working with something he loved, and being able to eat a healthy amount of food for his age and amount of exercise.
Draco had expected as much and put down the asphodel that he had been powdering for their potion to listen to him.
The house-elf didn't visit her in the middle of their dinner, because she was sitting at the table with the Dursleys, in her nicest clothes. She was polite and smiled prettily, instantly placing herself in the Mason's good books. If there was anything that Slytherin had taught her, it was about using any means necessary to get what you wanted.
She sniffed delicately, in an obvious imitation of her Pansy. “You better. I’ll talk to you next week Uncle Draco.”
"Your friends love you. Your family loves you. And I am sure Ginny is not the only one who loves you that way."
The old pain was back with full force on his chest. Or perhaps it was never left, merely lying dormant. It was regret and guilt and jealousy and broken dreams fused together and if he had to choose again he knew he would still choose the same path.
"Scorp, what's wrong?"
"They?"
Still, she couldn't shake the conversation from her mind.
Yet the conversation she just overheard...him...what was actually happening? Who was him?
"How can you expect me to help you destroy my family? I need your help; I admit it, but..."
Draco lifted his face and stared at her incredulously.
"And what is the benefit for me in your little scheme?"
"Your friends love you. Your family loves you. And I am sure Ginny is not the only one who loves you that way."
He tried to appeal to her common sense once more, but she just looked at him with the look that he hated: the one that said she was disappointed but felt hopeless to change anything.
"Hmm, so pretty... I will enjoy the next twenty-four hours so much..."
"Oh?" He schooled his feature to indifference instead.
Scorpius didn't answer, though. He just continued hiding his face in Draco's robe, heaving and sobbing.
He had read from the Prophet a few days ago that Harry had finalized his divorce with the Weaslette. He was dying to ask - either for confirmation, a second chance, or both, he did not know. He swallowed back all those questions.
He smirked, seeing the gray eyes become dull once again.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
Draco had imagined coming home to Scorpius' smiling face. Instead, he was welcomed by a teary eyed kid.
Draco had read the newspaper that morning, had known that Harry's Werewolves proposal had been approved. Shouldn't it make him happy?
In reply, Harry opened the door wider and let him enter.
And why should he care about an ex-Death Eater? Those so -- called-ex Death Eaters, they never changed. Harry knew the ministry should just send them all to Azkaban. If they had, then Ginny would still alive.
"It is in my interest to make you happy, isn't it?"
"You let me believe that it was your status as Voldemort's slayer that you were using; that and maybe a bit of blackmail that you gathered by digging out their secrets. You never told me that you were trading flesh as well!"
"I am sure they believe the same," Dumbledore said, "The Ministry thought that putting away werewolves and those who were possibly infected would make it safer for the population. The Purebloods thought that rejecting Muggles and Muggleborns would keep their world safe from Muggle influences. They went overboard and sometimes, the reasons are selfish, but they began with believing that they did the right things."
"Did she? Hmm, I always knew she was a smart witch." Dumbledore smiled.
Harry knew that if only he could make Hermione somehow understand why he did it, he would have an irreplaceable ally in her. He knew it wouldn't be easy, though.
"Do you want to know what his newest project is, Granger?"
There was a tug on his heart. Pity, maybe, or it could be guilt. On reflection, his own words to Malfoy before, about how the only skill Malfoy had was to become a whore, seemed unnecessarily cruel.
"Hmm, so pretty... I will enjoy the next twenty-four hours so much..."
"But the means to the end also used to be important for you, Harry! Do you remember how Dumbledore always said that love was your strongest weapon? But you are now driven by hatred."
For the first time since Harry could remember, he greeted the other man cordially.
"I tried negotiations, tried to talk, but they couldn't be convinced. They wanted me to be their poster boy; supporting whatever programs they sprouted out. They don't want me to think for myself."
“What do you want to do after the war?” Harry whispered on his ear.
They talked about the mundane things instead: the Canon’s prospect, Harry's job as an Auror, Draco's apothecary, the new café where Fortescue’s ice cream parlor used to be. They laughed and talked and Draco knew that they both was pretending that there was nothing else to be said – no accusation, blame, or explanation, threading carefully on a thin ice.
"Of course, Hermione." Harry straightened on the couch and hid away the glass. He was not in the mood for Hermione's lecture.
Harry said nothing. Instead, he cocked one eyebrow and waited.
"Oh, this is rich. Draco Malfoy loves me. You know what? You really are one fucked up person, Malfoy."
They were all the same -- powerful, respectable men with a taste for illusions.
Unfortunately, it was only that, a plan. His only remaining house-elf had woken him up at ten o'clock in the morning with the news of Granger's sudden, unexpected arrival.
The Ministry took Teddy and the fight to protect Werewolves' rights became personal for Harry.
He closed his eyes for a moment, taking a breath.
Draco bowed his head, letting his fringe to cover his leaking eyes.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.--.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
Filling a second glass with wine, he placed it beside the first one.
So it was Dumbledore's turn today.
Harry was going to open his mouth to defend himself, but she stalled it by pressing her index finger to his lips.
Hermione didn't say anything. She just stared at him, as if trying to read him.
"You got no one to blame but yourself for that, Malfoy," Hermione scoffed.
"No."
"And separating them from their family? Killing their parents?"
"I am not. If you must know, then yes, I am a whore and Potter is my pimp."
Not for the first time Harry thought that he had a fucked up imagination.
How said Malfoy had ended up as Deputy Headmaster though, never ceased to baffle him.
"I don't think you believe it."
Well, there was a new improvement on the Wizengamot front. Rumour had it that the Greengrasses had agreed to support the proposal. She wanted to ask Harry whether he had something to do with this and to discuss their next strategy with him.
"Oh."
"That's good, Harry." Her somber voice broke his elation.
Still, he came inside. Harry closed the door behind them and looked expectantly at Malfoy.
The old Harry, Draco knew, would have taken this into consideration. He had read an article once at the Quibbler (not that he wanted to admit it, but for a desperate job seeker, every newspaper was an opportunity) that losing his parents had made Harry consider family as an important thing.
Draco sighed inwardly. To be honest, he had been afraid of this. Kids, he knew just all too well, could be cruel, crueler than any adult in their ignorance. After all, hadn't he been a bully once?
"I know. I saw you with Abelard Raith."
"Don't say that! This is not a Death Eater family! Yes, your grandfather and I made an awful mistake, but it doesn't mean that the entire family is made of Death Eaters. Besides, we have already paid for our mistake. Those kids have no right to say anything!"
The glee was killed in an instant and replaced with fury. He stood abruptly and stalked towards her side.
"Harry, I told you before that it is our choices that made us who we are. You know, Muggles have a saying that two wrongs don't make a right."
"I can sell myself to Muggles. After all, it seems like it's the only thing I am good for, right?" said Malfoy, bowing his head.
Draco no longer believed that the world would give him whatever he desired. He knew that the other man wouldn't feel the same for him, couldn't even stand him, for that matter. Weren't his current circumstances solid proof of that? Harry would never use any of his friends like he used Draco.
And there was Malfoy, sitting on the floor, looking up at him and telling him over and over, "You are Voldemort, Harry."
The sentence was a statement, really, not a question.
No, he couldn't resent her decision to divorce him and go back to her family. He should be grateful that she let him keep Scorpius, although he knew that her father wouldn't want the kid to stay with the Greengrasses anyway, since it could complicate his plan to marry Astoria to another wizard.
"I am sure they believe the same," Dumbledore said, "The Ministry thought that putting away werewolves and those who were possibly infected would make it safer for the population. The Purebloods thought that rejecting Muggles and Muggleborns would keep their world safe from Muggle influences. They went overboard and sometimes, the reasons are selfish, but they began with believing that they did the right things."
He released her from the hug but kept his arms on her shoulders. She seemed tired, he observed, tired and sad.
There was sympathy in her voice, mixed with sadness and understanding. Harry hated pity, but it was different with Hermione and Ron. After all, it was their loss as well.
It was, he supposed, like taking a Muggle drug. It made you high and happy for a while and when the effect disappeared it would leave you feeling even worse than before. Yet, Draco was used to disappointment, wasn't he?
Harry felt the wetness of tears at the corner of his eyes.
Draco hummed non committedly, leaning back onto his hands and closing his eyes, letting the wind wash through his hair. The beginning of spring was upon them, he could feel it.
“The dragon reserve in Romania,” she explained. “He went there for about five weeks with Ginny’s oldest brother, Charlie, for about five weeks before he came here.”
There it was, another tattoo.
"Theo," he whispered. Theo shifted his arm so that his forearm was facing away from them and gazed resolutely out of the window.
Classes would start in a few hours, and Draco was starting to feel a little sleepy. When they reached the common room, they walked in, waving at Ernie Macmillan and Padma Patil, who were drinking a mug of something in the kitchenette.
He wanted one of them to assist, and with a few quick waves of her wand to automate the recorder, Susan walked in, hair pulled back in a no-nonsense bun, uniform buttoned over her slacks.
They sat together in silence for a few minutes, Draco still running his hands through Harry's hair before Harry spoke up.
“I can tell you those things about my mother. Mother always smoothes her robes down when she feels nervous. She frowns while brushing her hair because she doesn’t like the way it looks when it’s down. She doesn’t like apple juice because it makes her teeth feel funny. She has a bad habit of leaving her scarves everywhere. I can tell you those things about you too,” he continued.
"I guess you're not too bad, for a Slytherin," Ron said to her during a game of quidditch.
"She's a freak," Dudley ground out.
“Luna’s appointment. I can’t believe I fell asleep. I-”
Harry and Draco had been sitting in comfortable silence for nearly half an hour. It was nearing 2 in the morning, and Draco was sure that they would regret staying up so late when classes started, but he couldn’t bring himself to care.
not for the last time, he thought, as he watched the few others recount their experiences.
Potter looked at Draco and cleared his throat, startling him out of his thoughts. “I’ll see you then, Malfoy.” He said, awkwardly lifting a hand in farewell, before turning on the spot. Draco saw a flash of red on his shoulder before Potter disapperated.
"A giant one," Ara grinned.
"When seven of your stepfathers have mysteriously disappeared," he warned. "You learn a few tips."
have gone to that nightclub last night,” he echoed Draco’s thoughts from a few minutes ago.
They landed in their joint office that they had been using since they were assigned each other as partners a year earlier, and rushed to the Head Auror’s office for debriefing.
Harry had been missing from breakfast and dinner every day for the past week, along with both Weasley siblings during dinner.
Draco and Susan couldn’t hear most of what was going on, but they would go over the interrogation together, and then send their information to the ID.
Harry had laughed in relief, sliding a ring onto his finger, and wrapping his arms around Draco’s waist.
This was Potter. Potter, who was somehow always there when someone needed the day to be saved. Potter, who had saved
So when her letter came and the word
Ara smiled gratefully at Luna, slipping her map back into the bag. "What would I do without you, Luna?"
Fuck, he was officially old now.
He was suddenly aware that he had apologized to one member of the Golden trio the previous night. He had sent Potter a long letter apologizing and thanking him after their brief conversation in the safe-house, he owed him a life debt. What he had done for him couldn’t be conveyed in a letter.
He had one last thing to say. “And Potter?”
Potter nodded at her thoughtfully, “You're right,” he said, taking out his wand and waving it in the air.
“She asks about you, you know,” he said. “Andromeda.”
He dragged his chair from the opposite side of the table, and moved it away, choosing to perch on the table instead, while his partner exited through the back doors to speak to the guards that had brought him there.
He sighed. She had a point. “She better treat you well,” was all he said. She just smiled widely at him and turned back to the group, where Finnegan and Thomas were recounting their experiences together.
the footsteps are about one-inch square together.
Merlin, today was sentimental enough with him sending off his oldest to Hogwarts.
He was kneeling in the sand, holding a small black box, Draco could see a flash of white from his teeth as Harry grinned up at him.
"Tonks gave birth," Remus said, his normally pale skin flushed with happiness. "We named him Teddy, and his hair is already changing colour. Ara, you'll be godmother, right?"
The death eaters made to run, but not before Ara whipped her dillusion off and screamed the incantation for a cutting curse at Bellatrix and Greyback's legs. She ran outside, catching only Draco's apologetic eyes, and Snape's determined ones as she ran to help the prefects and Professors chase the Death Eaters away from the school.
They were still gaping at her when she dragged them up to the library to show them the queer wizarding section in the library.
(See the end of the chapter for
Malfoy was going with Pansy, Hermione was going with Krum, and Ron was taking Luna as a friend as a favor to Ginny. The boys and girls in her year had all paired off, deciding to go together as friends, even though as a champion, Ara was the only one who actually needed a date.
wasn’t something that Potter did often, then.
The silence that they were in was interrupted when Draco’s stomach decided to growl. The grumbling sounded a lot louder than it should have, probably because of the silence of the night.
Harry leaned into his touch.
Normally they would have said something, but this was a muggle woman and it was their wedding night.
Harry just pursed his lips together, bringing his tea closer to his face.
His hair was getting longer, it nearly brushed his shoulders when he leaned back, and Draco could make out the line of his Adam’s apple and the curve of his throat in the darkness, warmth pooling in his chest at making Harry laugh.
"Hermione and I came here last year," she said and kneeled down. "Hey mum, dad," she said softly. "I'm back. It's been a while since I've seen you, and a lot has changed."
He grabbed his wand and cast a Tempus as a pretext, turning his attention back to the stove. “Ron has an appointment for his wedding robes in half an hour. It would be dreadfully inconvenient if the best man was absent from it.”
Harry’s voice brought him out of his thoughts. “You too? Nightmares, I mean.”
The rest of the girls looked at her expectantly. Ara sighed. "It's Malfoy."
Ara held her hands protectively over her hair. "Don't even think about it."
“Leo!” she heard Aunt Ginny Shriek. “If I hear a single complaint from Professor McGonagall this year, I swear to god, I will ban you from flying for an entire summer.”

Teddy hugged her back tightly. "Aunt Hermione was
It took him a few months after the battle to be able to eat anything filling or nutritious every once in a while, without it coming back up a few hours later. The quality of prison food had been bad enough. It hadn’t encouraged his appetite.
They were sitting on opposite seats, staring out the window. "You guys go in," Ginny said, a shiny Quidditch Captain's badge on her chest. "I'll scare away any kids who come this way."
“Bloody hell, you two look like night and day,” Hugo exclaimed as they went into an empty compartment. He wasn’t wrong, Aster was extremely pale, and Daisy had taken after her mother’s dark skin.
Aunt Pansy, Uncle Charlie, and Uncle Blaise were the only ones in her family to not have children.
She left the brothers to mourn and crouched down near the corpses of Remus and Tonks. She pulled Sirius into a hug, tears finally spilling out of her eyes when she saw his red-rimmed ones.
“Same-sex activity has been legal here for a few years, which is probably why Hermione chose this place,” He brushed his lips across Harry’s forehead.
They nodded.
"Extra naan for me please." Ara and Dudley had taken to spending a lot of time near the fence at the far edge of the park near their house. Ara had done some fiddling and gotten the wards to cover that area too so that no one could see them, and it was hidden from general view.
Potter nodded at him and waved his wand in the air, muttering the incantation for the Patronus charm and silvery mist formed from the end of his wand. He cleared his throat, “To Andromeda Tonks, we’re ready to leave, can you meet us at the doorway where we first came through from?”
He looked in both directions to make sure that no one was watching him before he swiftly walked the distance to Blaise’s dorm.
Harry kissed him long and hard, and his face was annoyed when he pulled back.
of all people to bring the attention to them by clapping Blaise on the shoulder. Draco supposed this was payback for all those years of tormenting him. Not that he didn’t deserve payback, though.
“Thank you. For everything.”
“You were also of age when this took place. This task had been given to you in advance?”
(See the end of the chapter for
Teddy scoffed. “Fine. Would you prefer to discuss wedding details then? I’m sure you, Uncle Bill and Aunt Fleur will have a marvelous time with that.”
"Show off," Dudley snarked. "I'm going to go get that takeout that we wanted."
Pansy smiled into her coffee. "I saw Mrs. Tonks leaving the room. That means it’s free now. If you finally grow some balls and kiss him within the next three hours, then I promise to split the money with you."

A few weeks later, Hermione came to Ara with the idea for a defence club. Now that Ara had settled into her usual hectic schedule, she had handed over the tutoring to different students, and assigned students to teach defence. She added her own spells to the paper that the students signed, and Hermione distributed the galleons.
"I see," Aunt Andromeda said. "You've both taken leave off work then?" They nodded.
Their living room was covered in photos, of Draco and his parents when they were younger, and one with Harry and his parents when he was a baby.
Harry made an apologetic face at Draco. “I overslept too, we
"She did," he stated.
He had gotten a chance to live, one that his parents and so many others hadn’t.
“Triple chocolate,” Harry grinned. “Would Ron select anything else?”
was surprising, Draco thought, as he quietly took his shot.
Draco saw him passing what looked like a canary cream to her.
Scorpius put his mug down. "He married your sister then, Mr Weasley? The former captain of the Holyhead Harpies and the two-time chaser for the English National team."
Her father was one of the ministry’s senior-most Aurors and potions experts. She knew her father had been offered the Head auror position, one that would give him great political influence.

to give your godchild a broom on their first Birthday. Sirius couldn’t be there for mine because we were in hiding. I want to be there for Teddy,
She had socked him in the jaw as soon as she had opened the door, and then smiled at him and welcomed him in like nothing had happened, Scorpius gaping incredulously at them as they walked through the doorway.
' on Harry's motorbike, with him grinning devilishly back at her, one of her arms wrapped around his waist and the other hand pumped into the air in excitement.
One week at their weekly dinner at the Weasleys, Ron and Hermione announced their engagement, all hell breaking loose once Hermione held up her hand with the shiny ring on it.
A five-minute discussion later, and Narcissa and Draco were being moved in too. Ara was delighted. Sirius was less delighted. "As long as you cast silencing charms on your room," he said, looking at them coyly.
? Draco didn’t realize he had spoken out loud until Potter turned his head back to him and sat down properly, this time with a shirt in his hand.
There was his mother, Aunt Andromeda, and Teddy sitting with their closest family in the front row.
"I'm happy that you're who you are, Luna." Ara said softly.
Draco made note of the way he continuously rubbed at his wrist and seemed to shrink onto himself every time he mentioned his wife.
Theo's neck snapped up to look at them, lips parting in surprise.
"Then call me Milli."
Susan took Harry’s place on the table as he walked around the room, interjecting every few seconds to add on to Harry’s questions. It was only a few minutes before the man started to tremble, spilling out the information they needed.
Draco felt a sudden rush of affection for the man sitting next to him. He reached over and put his hands on top of Harry's, not trusting himself to speak.
At first, Draco thought he was talking about his year on the run. But when he surfed through his memories of younger Harry, he remembered him always coming to school at the start of every year looking skinnier and paler than he did before.
“I’ll always be here for you Harry. Especially when you need a bubble bath partner.”
Leave me a comment and tell me what you think :)
When she went back to the common room an hour later, she asked her friend. "Ginny," she said. "Will you go with me to the ball? I know you were planning to sneak in but I really need a date and-"
Draco put his hands on Harry’s shoulders and steadied him. “Luna’s fine.” He reassured. “Ginny and I were there, and
His romantic attraction in Harry had started shortly after Harry had broken up with Althea. He had started noticing Harry in ways that he hadn’t before.
“I wouldn’t have to
Potter wiped his mouth after downing the shot, “That was one time, Gin,” he rasped, “One time.”
Draco laughed incredulously. "Me? What makes you think that he would ever listen to me? He would probably shut the door in my face. And the ministry needs me here, I can't leave."
“Draco-”
The lady at the ticket counter had made them feel slightly awkward as she checked over their tickets a few minutes ago.
"I expected you to be taller," she said, recognizing him as her Godfather's younger brother. "Where are we?"
It was only after she left that he picked it up. It was a picture of him and Lily, from when they were kids. A small note was attached to it, in Ara's handwriting.
"I know," Tracy said.
When Teddy went off to Hogwarts, their whole family had gone to see him off. She and Draco each held one of their kids in their arms (Cassiopeia Luna and Scorpius Regulus.)
“Five hundred, fifty, one thousand,” Draco said. “D, L, M.”
"One calm Halloween," Ara groaned to Ginny as they ran the grounds together in the morning. It was a habit that Ara had carried from her runs with Dudley, and Ginny was happy to accompany her. "That's all I ask for."
Draco nodded; anger dissipating as quickly as it had come. He had a trip to plan. "Tell Miffy to pack my bags, and to take a week off. I'll leave directly from the ministry; I have some work to finish off before leaving." He told Scorpius.
Harry smiled gratefully at him, lifting his shirt slightly higher to heal the bruise above his injury with a quick episkey, and waving his wand once more to clear the blood above it.
Aster and Leo gaped at her dad when he brought an old piece of parchment from his pocket.
She said yes, of course she did.
She shook her head, looking genuinely confused.
Harry had noticed him not eating since the eight years were spread around the four house tables.
“Neither do I.”
"What are you waiting for?" Ara asked, casting a quick scourify at her hair before tying it back.
After one night like that a few weeks ago, Hermione had woken them up. Her expression wasn’t like those of previous times (one of concern), this time she looked amused, eyes dancing with a hand covering her mouth. Harry had fallen asleep on Draco’s shoulder and had somehow ended up with his head on Draco’s lap, with Draco’s hand tangled in his hair.
The pear giggled and the door opened. “What do you want to eat?” Harry asked, holding the portrait open while Draco walked in.
Draco knew the meeting was important, and he knew Harry would have a good explanation for it when he came back. It wasn’t like he didn’t want Harry to get any tattoos, but he could see that they were addicting and thought that Harry needed to slow down a little.
Victoire smiled up happily at Draco’s
The Dark Lord was skilled in torture, so much so that when he was done with you, you would long for something as sweet as pain, beg for something as merciful as death.
If it wasn't clear in the chapter, Lily+ Narcissa= Lissa, and Aster was named for the Evans and Black family traditions, a flower and a star.
"The golden boy can't heal a simple head injury himself?" oh yeah, this was way too fun to stop.
Teddy came to their house to visit a few hours after they had dropped all the kids off to the station.
Adrian left the door slightly ajar when he exited.
“It’s wonderful that you’re doing this for her.” He agreed. “And I never said you shouldn’t. But don’t neglect yourself along the way, okay? After everything, you deserve happiness too.”
"But I'm not a girl, am I? I'm a freak."
She pressed her face into the cushion. "No. Everything is terrible."
“Good morning class,” he spoke to all of them, nodding at Arianna before resting his eyes on all of them as a whole.
"Hermione asked me not to tell you. Ginny came with me because she wanted one too. One thing lead to another and now all of our friends have a bet on how long it would take for you to figure it out.”
When she was seven, her teachers wanted to put her in an accelerated program. But the Dursley's wouldn't pay for it, so she stayed in her regular class. She grew up unwanted and unloved but determined to prove herself.
"No, you can't. You're enough danger as it is. Stay away from me."
Draco had been overjoyed, of course, but her nagging kept him up at night. "Fuck, Draco. I fought a basilisk and infiltrated the ministry. How can I become a parent?" "The Dragon just wanted to escape at that time, it seemed like a good idea-"
He took a minute to look at her. She knew she looked a lot like father, with her pale skin, high cheekbones, and light hair. But her eyes, those were all dad’s.
Lily shared a look with her father before answering. “I’m doing competitive duelling, but I’m getting a defence Mastery rather than a duelling one for now. So yes, I am following in his footsteps either way. I’m competing in the national Duelling tournament this summer.”
He watched as the people trickled into the room and then looked down at his hands when he saw them staring at him. They were pale and long-fingered, even skinner than usual after prison. He looked at the area where the handcuffs met his wrists, where the skin was slightly red with irritation, and rubbed at it slightly, trying to soothe the ache. He clasped his hands together and leaned back in his chair. The room was finally full.
Before he realized what he was doing he was throwing himself at her.
Draco laughed, "Sixth year me might have been okay with this,” He paused, tilting his head to the side. “Well, maybe not with the amount of ginger in my life, but definitely with the fabulous sex.”
“You about done there?” Her dad’s slightly amused voice carried through her room.
§ mischief managed in dark red and the footsteps in black, that move all over his bicep
The voice of his husband didn’t do anything to bring out of his nostalgia.
"You're human now, Tom," she said, feeling Draco's wand responding to her magic as she twirled it in between her fingers. "Just like me." She looked him in his serpentine eyes.
Ara pursed her lips. "By 'they' you mean Sirius and I can't, right? I hope you realize that you've caused a lot of trouble for my department."
"Ice cream?"
“We have a special guest with us today, she’s going to be my duelling partner until John returns from France.” He gestured to his daughter. “Some of you may remember her from last year, or as Professor Grayson’s apprentice from this year. Lily Potter, my daughter.”
“Draco-” Harry swatted his hand away. “There are children here.”
Malfoy stiffened.
He was excellent at them, words harsh in a way they never were outside work. He had drilled himself on techniques, pouring over them at their dinner table at night for hours during training.
“I’m sure you know that your Father and I didn’t have the most pleasant Hogwarts experience,” he said, running a thumb over her cheek. “But for both of us, it was always home. I only hope that you can find the same in it.”
Draco flushed, and Ara grabbed Sirius in a headlock, both of them toppling to the floor in the process. Sirius' elbow pressed into her side as they fell down.
A month into the holidays she and Ginny decided to meet up in muggle London. Ron and the twins came with her, and she took them around muggle London. In return, they took her to the Burrow the week after.
The guest list was only family and friends. By some miracle, their wedding date and location hadn’t been leaked. The wizarding world most likely knew that they were getting married sometime this week since they had both taken three weeks off. The date itself hadn’t been made public, and the guest list had only those who they had been comfortable with.
Draco’s shoulders finally released the tightness that they had been carrying ever since Hermione had told him that he would be flying out to the US.
“He does have a parent though, one who will never let their memory die.”
Draco kept to himself and his few friends for the most part. He had aided in the torture of enough of his classmates that everyday conversation was
She hadn't even said anything about it to Draco, but he knew how important defending her community was to her.
Save Draco and Theo Nott, that was. They were the only two in their year who had taken the mark.
Draco shouldered his bag and held Harry’s out for him as they rushed out the door, Harry locking it by muttering the words to the wards under his breath.
As he grew older, the white slowly started to shift to grey. The days of running through wildflowers turned to walking regally down the halls of school, sneering at those he thought below him.
Ara shushed them.
Hermione was holding Dominique, Draco’s first godchild, as she spoke to Luna, who was pregnant and had started to show a short while ago.
"Tryouts are on Tuesday," he said. "Both of you are keeping your place right?" they nodded. "Brilliant," he said, "I already have a few names, and I would appreciate it if you both were there," he added and left, robes swishing behind him.
“Today is certainly a day of surprises,” Draco said, still surprised. “I don’t even know what to say, Harry.”
Harry hummed in agreement.
“It’s like you wait for us not to be there during meals so you can forget that you don’t have to eat,” he said accusingly.
Every time he thought of the first time that he visited their house, his jaw tingled with the ghost of Hermione's knuckles.
That hadn’t changed, she thought, as she folded her robes into her trunk. Teddy was still her role model, and other than her parents and younger sister, Teddy was the one person she was closest to.
Ara cast an immobilizing curse at a  Death eater who was sneaking up on Ron, and Blaise pushed her out of the way when he saw a green light coming towards her.
Draco flopped onto his back, hitching the blanket higher up his chest for warmth.
Potions smuggling cases under investigation could go wrong pretty easily, especially considering that they usually didn’t know the potion or the smuggler that well.
Lily shook her head. “She saw Al yesterday when he came here for you. He told her that it wasn’t safe for any of us to return.” Draco relaxed when he realized that they were talking about Arianna.
He rolled his eyes. Sirius usually switched between his vaults, where Harry’s grandparent’s portraits were, Aunt Andromeda’s house, and Grimmauld Place. He also had a nasty habit of speaking up and surprising people when they least expected it.
"I didn't make prefect," Nymphadora Tonks said to Ara at the party. "Apparently, I lacked the ability to behave myself."
"I may be influential," Malfoy had admitted. "But you're a leader."
"Theo," Blaise murmured. He was always the calmer of the four of them. "You know you can tell us anything."
He felt Draco trace the shape of the tattoo on his back, the dragon curled around Lily, Narcissus, and Aster flowers.  The little Teddy bear that was under them.
Harry and his mother were listed for Draco, though he had never been in a life-threatening situation after starting fieldwork, or a situation where they had needed to be called in to make decisions for him when he couldn’t.
Draco flicked his ear. "Yes, brat." He pulled back, looking up at his son. Scorpius was taller than him and had been for the past few years. "Stay safe."
She bought a leather jacket identical to his and wore it to the concert that they snuck out to watch on August 30th, two days before she had to leave to Hogwarts. They looked like father and daughter, with messy black hair and high cheekbones. (The fact that both of them were dressed in leather jackets didn't help either).
And when Hermione was petrified and Ginny was taken, it was Malfoy who cornered Ara in the library. "Check Granger's hand," was all he said. "That's where you'll find the answers."
They didn't have the money in their vault to pay for expensive magical robes, and muggle clothing was surprisingly comfortable, as they had found.
"It does," she said, relieved. "I'm going to get someone to tip off Dumbledore and Fudge that Aralynn Potter is in the ministry Atrium, and get them to go there. I'm thinking Tonks for the ministry and maybe one of my Gryffindor friends for Dumbledore?"
The last question was directed at him, and he tried to clear his throat to answer. “I do.” Like the rest of him, his voice was hoarse from disuse and his voice came out raspy and just
There was one where Harry and Draco were wearing old, paint-covered clothes. Both of them had been nineteen, sticking their tongues out at Pansy, who had been lounging behind the camera while they painted their basement.
Draco smiled softly at him, a smile that no one but Harry had seen. He walked out, only pausing at the doorway.
On a lot of the days, it was Draco.
“I’ll ask him about it then,” he said, walking away.
The head boy told her that Malfoy had turned down the prefect's position, and Dumbledore had given it to Blaise instead.
And why should he care about an ex-Death Eater? Those so - called-ex Death Eaters, they never changed. Harry knew the ministry should just send them all to Azkaban. If they had, then Ginny would still alive.
Perhaps the old man was right; he had to change before he fell any further. Perhaps it was not too late for him to be happy again.
"You love me, don't you?"
"No."
"So in sum, all fractions have reasons to reject the proposal."
Some days, Harry wondered why he had gone back to Hogwarts. Sure, once upon a time Hogwarts had felt like home for him. In fact, it was the only home he had ever really known.
Unfortunately, it was only that, a plan. His only remaining house-elf had woken him up at ten o'clock in the morning with the news of Granger's sudden, unexpected arrival.
Draco shook his head, trying to chase the thoughts away.
The room was relatively bare, with white walls and white floor. Once upon a time, Draco knew, this would have been a massive, comfortable bedroom with flower arrangements everywhere from colleagues trying to ingratiate themselves for his parents' favor. Yet the bed in the room was the normal, standard issue of St. Mungos, and the only flower arrangement was the small bunch of roses on the bedside table that Draco had brought with him. At least, Draco tried to console himself, it was a private room.
His action, he took note, irritated her further.
-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.--.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-.-
"Nothing."
He had enjoyed it for sure, but he had always categorized their time together as sex and only sex. Why should he spend more time in foreplay and seduction? After all, Malfoy was a sure thing, and as long as the act was done, he was satisfied.
The glee was killed in an instant and replaced with fury. He stood abruptly and stalked towards her side.
"Potter...Harry..."
Draco was quite proud that he could maintain his usual polite but detached voice. He felt so tired and sleepy and depressed; the only thing he wanted at the moment was for Granger to go home and leave him in peace.
