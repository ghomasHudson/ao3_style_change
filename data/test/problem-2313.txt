flirting with him? How and why is this happening? Were they really going to do this, play pretend and forget about their hatred and animosity?
“I’m honoured, truly. It’s not every day a person can come out of the closet to someone that knows exactly what they’re going through. You’ve put your trust in a worthy recipient,” Ginny says, grinning.
“Al, Al...you are, you’re a hero, mate. I’m so sorry, I’m – I’m so sorry,” Harry cries, shaking his head and squeezing his eyes tightly shut to stop the threat of tears.
. I would not do anything to change Draco’s amazing life." Narcissa suddenly sighs. "I want Draco happy. I knew from his first letter detailing what you did for him in Diagon Alley that you two were meant to be in each other’s lives. Call it a mother’s intuition, but I know what Draco wants, Harry, and that’s for you to be in his life. I am here to appeal to you, Harry. Please. Be kind to my son. You will never find another man who will take care of you like Draco.”
Draco uses what little strength he has left to scream, dragging himself on his stomach towards Harry. But instead of a flash of ominous acid green light, it flashes blue, with a bang, and then there’s white smoke. Once the smoke clears, Smith is on his arse, shocked and coughing, his wand broken in half and smoking. Smith drops it and tries to move from off the ground, but finds that he can’t, struggling against whatever invisible hold has him tethered down. Harry’s still standing before him, a crooked smile on his face. Draco cries out in relief, tears pushing up behind his eyes as he shakes his head, desperately wanting to touch Harry, hold him.
He can hardly feel when they spin away, shooting out of the Floo and into the Parkinson Parlour. Draco lands on his back and Padma beside him on all fours.
my afterlife, Draco, and this isn’t it. Tell Padma I’m really here! Tell her! Fucking tell her I’m here!”
Draco jerks forward with shrill cry of surprise as Potter’s tongue breaches him, relentlessly working his tongue into him, coaxing him open. Draco rocks back against his tongue, a chain of unintelligible words and moans ripping from him. Spurred on by his wild sounds, Potter continues to ravish him like a starving man.
“Right,” Draco forces out through clenched teeth. “Everyone evacuate the lab. Please follow the protocol C-3729A when exiting. Keep your wands close and whatever you do, please remain calm during evacuation.” With that, Draco strides towards the lab’s doors.
sound of the metal snipping away at his soft hair makes his Adam’s apple bob painfully as he tries to bite back a sob. The strands, soft as silk, slide between his fingers to land at his feet. As he works through removing his hair by sectioning off handfuls of strands at a time and cutting them away, he feels something else slipping from him. The clenched ball of pain in the pit of his stomach he’s worked tirelessly at to chip away since the assault feels
” comes Malfoy’s bored drawl from the intercom. The woman has gone stiff and with a huff exits the little foyer out to the street. Harry releases a sigh of relief, feeling a bit nauseous at having dodged the rest of that woman’s ire.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut, his glasses smeared and fogging as he sobs. “I can’t stop it,” Harry cries. “I just can’t.”
Ron gently tugs Hermione onto the dancefloor, twirling her before wrapping his arms around her. This signals other couples to join onto the floor, dancing to the slow, but upbeat song. As stealthily as possible, Harry makes his way over towards Draco without being seen.
. I was going to…” he trails off. Because what had he thought would happen? He knew, logically, that he had to follow The Society’s order and kill the mole in their organisation. So he did. That mole then led Harry to Draco, a top informant for The Society’s rival agency. When the kill sheet came in with Draco’s name on it, he knew it was his own intel that brought about the decision. As a vital player, killing Draco would destabilise the agency enough for Harry to begin picking off the rest of their hitmen and informants without breaking a sweat. Harry had slowly infiltrated Draco’s life for months, positioning himself as a friend. Someone to be trusted. Someone to fall in love with.
Harry looks over at Draco’s laughing form and his breath catches. As dusk falls around them, Draco is illuminated by the descending sun, his white blond hair and sharp features softening. Harry can’t help the warm feeling spreading across his chest as his eyes flit over Draco. He wants to commit this image of him today to memory. He doesn’t think he’s ever seen Draco look so comfortable and happy, especially in a plain white t-shirt and worn jeans. His face is open, contemplative, and calm as he quiets and sips from his beverage, watching the trailers that come on before the film.
Mia snorts, resting her elbows on the bar and propping her chin up onto her open palms. There are runes tattooed on her knuckles: disruption, journey, and strength.
of the Gryffindor shite, but he doesn’t know if what they have is forever – he still wonders how the hell they haven’t tried to kill each other again. Maybe it’s only a matter of time. Maybe this relationship will end terribly and Draco will not only be
Potter starts to fiddle with the small maranta plant sat on the corner of Draco’s desk. “You have a lot to offer in your position here, Malfoy. I’d hate to see your efforts to improve our world get bogged down because of office politics, unsavoury bosses, or, you know, some Pureblood bollocks,” Potter says, not looking at him.
Gedeon nodding and clasping his hands before him. “Well, my apologies. Very sad news of his passing, regardless, he was a true hero. I will of course excuse anyone looking to leave early today, and you should too, Draco. Take the day off. But before you do, I wanted to track you down and let you know that Hermione has, unfortunately, resigned from her position as your senior research partner.”
Embarrassed and more than a little confused at how this conversation has played out, Draco scowls at the other man. “You’re an arsehole, Potter.”
anymore, and one year since the assault, he’s come to embrace that that feeling is no longer acceptable.
“We’ve lost five people already to that monstrous apparition, Draco. Either we try something a bit more drastic to see if we can free them and obtain positive results, or we need to terminate the project and come forward to the DMLE and the general public.”
, but his lips still begin to turn blue. The man’s eyes begin to flutter and Draco uses spell after spell to help the man breathe. By the time Draco gets the man stable, he’s worked up a sweat, a sigh of relief escaping him when the man’s eyes become more focused. He stares up at Draco, a shocked, pleading look on his face as a moan escapes him.
Granger shakes her head. “We have five innocent people stuck in their version of hell when it was supposed to be a place of peace and communication, Draco. I can’t live with myself knowing I helped put them there.”
Harry stands perfectly still, completely thrown off and confused by Draco’s words. “But Draco…you’re not dating anyone.”
“I know what’s in that box. I know what you’re about to ask me, but there are some things I have to tell you first.”
“Are you alright? I thought we were to meet by my office?” asks the man, his accent posher than Malfoy’s, if at all possible. Malfoy blushes and glances over the man’s shoulder at Harry. He can feel his own face heating up as he takes in the stranger tenderly pushing Malfoy’s fringe back from his eyes.
When he doesn’t move, Padma grips his chin and pulls out her wand to aim a light into and across both of his eyes. Draco registers her concern before his eyes roll to the back of his head and he nearly passes out. He can hear when she casts a Lightening Charm on him, wrapping her arm around his waist and hauling him up. She barely reaches his shoulder as she stands a solid five feet in comparison to his six-foot-one frame. Draco can feel as she drapes his arm across her shoulders and leads them towards the Floo.
“I’m sorry I woke you,” Draco mutters once they’re in bed under the duvet together. They’re both facing each other and Draco takes the opportunity to feast on Potter’s open face. Potter is properly beautiful. His iridescent green eyes seem to gleam in the moonlit bedroom, the light and shadows cast over him emphasising his strong jaw, the stubble across it, his thin but shapely lips, the famous lightning bolt shaped scar peeking from under his messy fringe. “You didn’t even grab your glasses…or clothing, for that matter.”
Even though he can’t see Draco, he can hear the other man’s laboured breaths and what suspiciously sounds like a choked sob. “I thought...I thought you…” Draco mutters shakily, before gasping. “I have to get out of here.” Harry can hear him stumbling to get away from him.
Still in shock, all Draco can do is try to control his shudders as he gasps in breaths like a fish out of water. He doesn’t want his vision to tunnel out until he faints. The careful hold he had on his anxiety the entire night collapses in one fell swoop. Smith pats him twice on the head and stands up.
belong together. Don’t let petty outside forces send your love for him up in flames.” Pansy sniffs, her posture straightening, scrambling to her feet. “I’m going to get you a glass of water and a vial of Draught of Peace, I’ll be right back.”
It disgusted him so much, the notions of love and death, that he committed heinous murders to split his soul into tiny pieces just to avoid it. And still, the embodiment of love prevailed—you won despite carrying a piece of that repulsion within you. And so I rationalise, to love and to be loved
Draco stops short, his brow furrowing as he leans against the wall beside Granger’s slightly ajar door to eavesdrop.
Having started his position at the Ministry only a handful of months ago, Draco is still learning the positions and names of people within the smaller or “less important” functions of the Ministry. He’s made it a personal mission of his as it helps to know middle and lower management. They’re usually the ones with the best gossip and little to lose in spilling it to anyone willing to part with a few galleons. But the big names? Draco is aware of the big names, the up and comers, even if he’s yet to match the names to faces. And it’s unsettling now that he matches Derrick Watson’s name with a picture of him dead, his name popping up within the first few pages of ledger over fifty times, especially since Derrick was said to have moved onto the Department of International Magical Cooperation. Despite the position involving a lot of travel, it’s simply not possible that the Chief Prosecutor would be unaware of his brother’s whereabouts.
“We’re all superb liars,” Potter says gravely. Potter’s mouth ticks up into a smile that doesn’t reach his eyes, his gaze piercing nonetheless. Draco feels a chill run up his spine.
idea. Yes, yes, you’re absolutely right. Goldstein and I will try this on a few samples and have a report for you at the end of the day. Anything else?”
“What’s this, Potter? Now I’m incapable of a simple observation?” Draco mutters against Harry’s ear. He smiles at the slight shiver that runs through Harry.
Draco hasn’t read it yet, but Harry, of course, had offered himself up to go public as a credible source, a somewhat whistleblower to the shadow government and crimes happening within the Ministry. When Harry had mentioned it the first time, Draco had gone crazy with anger and paranoia. There was no way he was going to allow Harry to put a target on his back, larger than the one he already carries around. When it had been just the idea of releasing the dossier anonymously to the media, Draco had supported that, but if they needed to attach a face to the story to make it verifiable— well, the risk had just been too great. There had to be another way.
“Oh God, no, no, no…” Potter says frantically. Draco coughs, already tasting the blood in his mouth as he stumbles back from Jeremy, falling to the floor and onto his back as he wheezes out a pained, anguished sob.
“I don’t know what I ever saw in you,” Jenkins says against Draco’s ear. “I used to think how my dad talked about you so much, if I could make you fall for me maybe I’d finally earn his respect, but all you did was treat me like a nuisance.”
Her heart-shaped face continues to pale as she watches him tremble. Pansy slides off the island, her arms coming up to wrap around his body. He jerks away from the touch. Pansy reels back from the abrupt recoil, her face contorting with alarm. “I’m sorry,” he mutters, tearing his eyes away from her. Pansy reaches for him again, slowly this time, and he leans into her touch, head resting against the swell of her breasts, his arms wrapping tightly around her small body, anchoring him. She rests her head atop of his, her hands caressing soothing circles around his back as she rocks him from side to side. He wants nothing more than to drown in Pansy’s perfumed scent of comfort, lulled to sleep like a babe. He feels so stupid, so unbelievably, irrevocably stupid. He should be capable of handling this better. He survived the Dark Mark, for Merlin’s sake. He had stood before the epitome of evil and had swallowed his fears so he could take the Mark upon the tender flesh of his forearm.
“Good grief, is that your sister Astoria snogging bloody Nott, Daffy?” Draco asks, his eyes widening in horror. “What have you two allowed to happen in this flat while I’ve been gone?”
Gedeon ignores his cries and instead turns his glare to Jenkins, a terrible scowl on his face. “You useless, idiotic cretin! No wonder they refuse to make you an Auror, you can hardly follow basic instructions! I ask you to
“Leave the poor sod alone, silly-Millie,” Theo says, his hand absently reaching out to squeeze Millie’s knee. “Draco. Chin up, mate. I’m about to rock your socks.”
“Okay. Perhaps your lack of symptoms are related to the areas of enhancement in the grey matter. There seems to be a suggestion of new neuron formation that I honestly can not explain. There have been studies, but it is generally unheard of in Muggle medicine,” Padma says, her voice troubled, but also reluctantly intrigued.
” Draco says, realisation dawned on him. Harry’s answering blush is all the confirmation Draco needs. “You silly, gorgeous, selflessly charming man,” Draco simpers, pulling Harry in closer.
Draco quickly glances at Potter, exhaustion etched across his face as if he still has the blood pumping heart, active brain cells, and muscle activity needed for his body to register such an emotion. Draco’s loath to admit that Potter has grown to be quite handsome. Potter’s a bit taller than Draco recalls, still shorter than Draco but definitely broader. He looks strong, it was obvious that Potter took care of himself while alive. His jawline is strong, his lips full, his hair an undeniable mess but the disheveled look works for him. And his eyes. Even in death, slightly transparent but vivid in colour, his eyes are still striking. He gives a small shake of his head, chastising himself for allowing his traitorous thoughts to run rampant about Potter’s attractiveness. He instead focuses on the current overall energy between them: tense and angry.
Draco quirks a brow, thinking about what would lead his own friends into doing something similar. “And why would they do that...unless you were avoiding them?”
Potter’s fear of becoming a monster is unsettling to Draco, as well. Draco’s spent the last six months trying to destroy his ability to feel, essentially becoming unemotional—something Potter considers
Draco gasps, his eyes livid. “How dare you say something like that to me! Me, your husband. The future other father of our children. The man you’ve literally bonded your bloody, selfish, piggish soul to!”
was excruciating pain, an invasion of his mind and body. He had assured himself many times since the end of the war he’d never experience something so debilitating again. He would never again be owned, branded, and desecrated by someone. He had assured himself that blatant lack of control would never happen, nothing could ever hurt him the way the Dark Lord had hurt him. Now he feels as if he’s been branded a million times over. This time he doesn’t think he’ll survive it.
Sarah walks through the door, her long hair pulled up into a wet bun as she flicks her wand in a loopy manner, drying herself and clearing up the puddle of rain she drags into the shop.
Potter rubs the back of his neck. “I mean, you’re the one I want to be with, always. There’s no one else for me.”
“Draco! Mate, you look a sight for sore eyes,” Theo says, jovial, wrapping an arm around Millie’s shoulders. “What’s wrong with him?” he asks Pansy.
Later on, when they’ve apprehended all the hijackers, and both backup Aurors and Muggle coast guards and marine police are roaming the ship, Draco stands beside Harry, only half listening to his partner recount the slightly altered tale of how they took out fifteen extremely dangerous hijackers.
“Looks like you need a refill,” Malfoy says casually, leaning against the bar. This close, Harry can see the lines of Malfoy’s chest and hint of his nipples through the crop top and the lean muscles of his stomach. Harry’s mouth goes a bit dry. Parkinson stands at Malfoy’s elbow, her hand raised with a careless boredom that somehow immediately attracts the bartender.
Flushed and slightly drunk off the pleasure, Draco pushes up to his elbows to glare at Potter. “Potter, if you don’t get back down there—”
Draco gasps and abruptly stands. What little colour he has in his face quickly drains away. “Fuck you, Potter. You’re dangerously about to cross a line that you’re going to regret. I won’t stick around to watch you self-destruct and drag the rest of us down with you,” Draco says, voice pitched low.
“You’ve disappointed me, Draco. When I first heard about you from Shoshanna, I immediately felt a keen connection to you, then I read the papers you co-authored, reviewed the clinical trials you had participated in—I simply thought: this kid is a genius! This kid has no boundaries, no qualms in doing whatever he needs to do to get the right results! I knew you were being wasted in America, wasted at St Mungo’s...it’s why I brought you here, gave you a state-of-the-art lab, money for whatever endeavour you wanted to explore, and my Deputy as your senior research partner, all because I had that much faith in you. I saw you like a son, Draco, I loved you more than this bumbling fool Robert! And you betrayed me. For that, I can’t forgive you.”
Draco shrugs, his mind’s eye filling with the image of a smirking Granger, cockily and casually taunting him within the Death Chamber.
Draco can feel his heart racing, a cold anxiety washing over him at Smith’s words. “Harry…” Draco whispers. “Harry...please…” Draco wants to tell him to protect himself, to cast a
“Master Black,” the elf wheezes. “Kreacher has been hearing many tales of you and is proud to be of service.” Kreacher bows low.
When he reaches the first-floor landing he notices that the sconces on the wall come to life for him, dim pools of light illuminating the dark path down the narrow hallway. Draco can make out a curved, ominous staircase at the very end, and he knows that he does not want to creep up those stairs, fear crawling up the back of his spine. He doesn’t know how Harry can live here, with its dark corners and musty smell.
Draco tries to back away from the door quickly, but stumbles, falling back as Gedeon steps out of the office, his bright blue eyes zeroing in on Draco catching himself against the wall.
They could always see right through him, though. Ron had taken him out to the Leaky just last week to gauge how he was doing sans Ginny. Harry often found himself in Hermione’s company now that he had dropped out of Auror training and Ron had stayed. Ron was quickly making a name for himself in the department, Harry’s heard, and he couldn’t be more proud, but sometimes he sorely missed his best mate. It’s not as if he doesn’t spend time with them—he’s constantly joining them for dinner, meeting up with Hermione for lunch at the Ministry, coming around for tea when they probably just want to spend what little free time they have with each other. But it just wasn’t the same.
Harry launches into a recount of their night—of the terrible seafood restaurant they stumbled across in Camden and the old cinema they went to afterwards to catch a black-and-white French film. She nods and smiles along, but the tightness in her face hasn’t relented, and Harry knows something is wrong.
” Harry shouts after him, and to Draco’s mortification, following him. “Why is it so hard for you to find reasons to
– and then he says, ‘I have some news…’” Draco howls again, uncurling himself to press against Harry, his face smashing into his chest. Harry’s arm comes up to wrap around him, holding him close and rubbing circles into his back. “He’s just supposed to be the
A wild, frantic wail escapes the creature as Harry takes several steps back from it, watching as it slides down the wall to land on the floor. It lays out on its side before curling into a ball, broken whimpers escaping it like the wounded animal it is. Harry shakes his head.
“I admit it!” Draco cries out, standing to his feet. “I admit in open court to everything! I started this venture as a means to humiliate the upper echelons of Pureblood society!”
“Right you are, you cock. Now get out the bleeding way!” an elderly man barks. Harry stares down at the man, suddenly realising he’s blocking him from entering the station. He wants to snap that the man should simply walk around him, but he’s in much too fragile a state to do more than nod his head quickly and disappear in the mass of bodies flooding into Goodge station.
‘Don’t fucking shout at me! It’s your fault I can’t parallel park! What kind of teacher are you?’ Draco snaps back before shoving his head out the open window to share a few strongly worded threats to the line of cars honking behind them on the narrow road.
“Potter, what the–” Malfoy stops because his mobile has beeped again, and he glances down at it with a frown. He then looks up at him.
Their eyes meet once again and Draco can see in Harry’s eyes just how strong his faith in him is. Draco nods.
Harry shimmies his shoulders as Ginny bounces up and down, arms and hands doing a weird type of vogue-thing while repeating the lyrics at the top of her lungs before they both break into uproarious peals of laughter.
In that moment, time has slowed down, and everything around him has as well. The sconces on the walls flicker. All that Harry can hear is Draco’s ragged breathing and his own erratic heartbeat unbearably loud in his ears. The image of his terrified children sitting outside in the cold roars to the front of his mind and anger grips him once more. Harry watches as Draco flickers out again, the creature consuming his husband once more.
Harry curses himself for the blush he feels creeping up his neck. Hasn't he suffered enough tonight? He considers coming up with some excuse, feigning an illness, but he'd rather just have it all out now. If Draco is going to reject him, it's best to get it over with. Harry sighs, suddenly weary. "How much of that did you hear?"
She continues on as if she didn't hear him. "Right. All this time, everyone has known Malfoy is extremely attractive, but we just decided to never say anything about it because he was such a prick and it didn't really matter if he was hot or not."
Harry feels his traitorous insides melting and is sure there's an embarrassingly sappy smile etched on his face. "Sure," he agrees, and kisses the tip of Draco's nose, watching in delight as a blush spreads across his cheeks.
It was something everyone knew but no one talked about. Harry and his friends hated Malfoy, but they also couldn't deny he was hot, which made him all the more infuriating.
Ginny winces, then tucks a stray lock behind her girlfriend's ear. "I don't think he was there yet, babe."
Malfoy had pink lips that looked insufferably soft, but they were stretched into a sneer and "Mudblood" fell from them. He had long, slender fingers with protruding, kissable knuckles and trimmed nails that Harry could picture carding through his unruly curls, but instead they gripped Malfoy's wand as he directed a
His friends, slightly appeased by Malfoy's (apparently much more eloquent) apologies, allowed Luna to integrate him into their weekly pub nights. Harry discovered that, horror upon horrors, Malfoy was actually
Ron, having looked up as soon as Ginny approached, considers this. "Um, that he's good at Quidditch?"
The confusion peaks then slowly clears on her face, replaced by understanding and a flash of horror and sympathy, until her expression settles into wicked delight. Ginny says slowly, "We all knew that Malfoy is...attractive?"
"That's not a thing," she repeats. "No one knows that, no one thinks that. I think you'll find that's specifically a
"They do," Harry agrees. "And when he smiles, they turn lighter." Harry thinks of the smiles Draco had given him the past several months, shy and hesitant at first, then warm and wide, and he feels a smile tugging at his own lips. There's a particular one Draco has, one both pleased and bashful at the same time, that makes an appearance every time Harry brings tea for him when he visits his lab. Two sugars, no milk, just the way he likes it. Harry's only ever seen it one other time, when they were in Andromeda's garden and Harry pointed out how much Teddy seemed to like Draco, which makes Harry think of how— "Sometimes, if the light hits them just right, they almost look like liquid silver. And—"
in front of the git himself was not in the top hundred possibilities. If Harry had thought Draco didn't want to speak to him after the last pub night, he was beyond certain of it now.
Draco sucks on Harry's lower lip, eliciting a moan from Harry and giving him an opportunity to slip his tongue inside Harry's mouth and twine it with Harry's.
Malfoy had disappeared for a few years after the War, and re-emerged as a Potions Master. During that time, while he had fucked off to France or Italy or wherever to get his degree (it was France, Harry knew very well it was France and tried very hard to not think about what Malfoy would sound like speaking French), he threw the Malfoy money at any and every charity, and continued to do so when he returned to London.
Luna leans over Ginny to smile at Harry. "He was almost there. Just needed a little nudge. Isn't that right, Harry?"
Harry was too young to want to do anything about it; it was simply a fact he knew instinctively, same as he knew the sky was blue, the grass was green, and the sun would come up in the morning. He had eyes, after all, even if they needed prescriptive lenses.
— and the feeling of the rippling cords of muscle in Draco's back that he couldn't resist running his hands over, again and again.
It's enough to spur Harry into action. He crashes his mouth onto Draco's, eager and insistent, as one hand snakes around Draco's waist and the other buries itself in Draco's hair, just as soft as Harry always imagined. The kiss is clumsy and all teeth, and Harry can feel Draco's smile as he touches Harry's chin and pushes gently, giving them a better angle.
"It's rather early to be turning in, don't you think?" Draco asks, his face a battleground of feelings. Hopeful warred with anxious, confidence with discomfort. "Pick up another graveyard shift?"
At first, Malfoy was cold and distant, and what Harry had assumed was self-importance and condescension soon revealed itself to be apprehension and remorse when Malfoy stammered through an apology during one of Harry's visits to his lab. Harry had been so horrified at this turn of events that he rushed to assure Malfoy they were fine, if only to shut him up, then promptly fled.
Malfoy was pretty, and he was a prick, and Harry had always been able to tell himself the former didn't matter because the latter was irrefutable, unchangeable. He had roughly a decades' worth of evidence.
Ginny finally rights herself, resorting to chuckling into her glass as she takes a sip. "Uh, yeah, no. That's not a thing."
"It's the eyes," Luna says with a smile. Ginny frowns at her girlfriend. "They're a lovely grey. Very expressive."
, come on, you know what I mean. The thing that never really mattered because he was such a terrible person? The thing we all collectively agreed to never bring up?"
Harry peeks through his fingers and stares at the table, horrified. "He'd kill me if he ever found out. I'll have to move, probably, quit my job—"
"Boring. Anyone else? No?" Ginny looks around the table, having commandeered everyone's attention. She reminds Harry of Draco with how easily she captures and maintains an audience. "Fine then. On a completely and definitely unrelated note, who here finds Malfoy attractive, show of hands?"
Despite their misgivings, the Aurors — including Harry and Ron — often found themselves working with him, and eventually, unfortunately, reliant upon him.
These two statements of fact could not be untangled, and Harry was constantly aware of their validity.
Draco pulls back and Harry instinctively chases his mouth, earning a chuckle from the other man. Draco presses a chaste kiss to Harry's lips, then another, and another. Finally he steps back, still in Harry's encircled arms but far enough away that they can't get distracted again.
As if that wasn't bad enough, Malfoy offered similar apologies to Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny, Luna, Dean, and Seamus, and Harry's friends felt it vital that he be made aware of each one.
Harry was a rather handsy drunk, and the more he drank, the more he couldn't stop staring at the way the light reflected in Draco's near-silver eyes and highlighted his cheekbones, and the more he was drawn to Draco like a moth to the flame, leaning into him and peering at him through thick lashes. At some point his arm had wound up flung across Draco's shoulders, and he clung to him when Draco finally, gingerly, took the glass from Harry's hands and suggested he was done for the night.
There were two truths universally acknowledged and inseparably intertwined. One could not exist without the other, and Harry was made aware of both in nearly the same breath.
He ran into Malfoy at Andromeda's where Harry was forced to witness him playing and talking seriously with a delighted Teddy, whose hair slowly faded from dark brown to white-blond as the afternoon waned.
And it would've been fine if Malfoy had left it at that, but he was apparently determined to ruin Harry's life.
Harry pushes past Draco, not even sparing a glance for his friends, and decides he'd rather walk home to let the cool air hopefully bring him back to his body, having left it in a fit of soul-deep mortification the moment he heard Draco's voice.
An hour ago, kissing Draco Malfoy wasn't even something Harry was aware he wanted in a way that was any different from how he assumed everyone must feel after laying eyes on him for more than two seconds. But here he is, standing a little ways from their pub, arms full and heart close to bursting, kissing and being kissed.
Harry had been avoiding Draco at work since then, letting Ron be the one to visit him in the lab, and at pub night. He volunteered to fill in for a Junior Auror on a stakeout for a case he had no part in last week, missing pub night entirely, and only deigned to go this week because they had caught the potions smuggling ring they'd been investigating and he knew Draco was tied up at work going through the evidence they collected.
He was dragged to the Gryffindor table and gulped when he saw who he would be forced to eat with. Draco cast his gaze down, and Ron glared daggers at him, earning him a swift kick from Hermione under the table.
He eyed the glass of milk in his hand, and he just continued drinking it as defiantly as possible-which was fairly impressive, considering Draco had never seen anyone drink milk defiantly. He didn’t even know that was a thing you could do.
The boy's chocolate hair was ruffled up, his glasses crooked. Plump, pink lips beckoned him. Without thinking, Draco leaned in and kissed him.
Narcissa produced a small box from a drawer in the console behind her and put it on the table next to Hecatia, who opened it with excited savagery while her mother cut a small sliver of cake for herself and took a seat between her children.
They were in the attic again, Draco lay gasping on the ground in a similar shirt to the one he’d worn in the last video. He ripped it off and there were ribs poking about in places they shouldn’t be. His wand glowed over his skin and the bones popped back gruesomely into place, left him groaning on the floor.
He re-wrapped the bloodied gauze around his torso and washed his hands frantically. Slightly ticked off, he opened the door.
She walked around the counter and muttered a spell, checking a little notebook that apparently sat inside one of the drawers.
Harry broke down the door in an instant, wand-drawn. One of the janitors was standing over Draco, a hand to his mouth and a gladius; an ancient roman shortsword-yes, an actual sword (welcome to Hogwarts) to his neck. Tears and sweat trailed down the poor boy's face, a black eye starting to form and his shirt torn open. There was blood on the floor.
"Yeah, a little bit. The atmosphere, mostly, not the whole...’I’m going to mutilate you with my sword’ thing. 'S not why I didn’t fight back, though. I  just...deserved it."
"No, you're right. I don't. But you also don't know if they want you to...y'know. It's all conjecture. But the least you can do is look to see what the people around you want for you, since the dead don't seem very talkative!" He spat. Draco stiffened, and ran hands along his eyes. The wind howled outside, whistling through the broken window.
Harry sighed and picked up the case from the ground, eyeing the stained furniture behind him, gleaming bright white in the dark attic. Floorboards creaked under his footfalls and he crouched in front of it, seeing the rivers of pain that were crusted onto its surface. It was rather horrifying. He set his forehead against the edge of the seat and
With that, he began feverishly slashing at the pale flesh of his wrist. The wand never touched his skin, but the large gashes blossomed and painted the chair red, staining Draco’s white shirt. He switched to the other wrist, growing delirious. He passed out soon enough, just staring at the blood that dripped down the arms of the chair. A few minutes passed, minutes of silence between the two boys on the couch. The tape glitched and Harry wasn’t sure how much time had passed, but the light from the windows of the attic had grown low and reddish in the evening.
His stomach churned as Draco told the driver they wouldn’t be long, and he turned his weathered key in the lock. The door opened with a foreboding creak and the boys were met with a tired-looking Aunt Petunia storming out from the kitchen. She clopped toward them an raised an eyebrow at Draco standing slender and serious behind Harry.
After a good half hour of searching, he finally found Draco's room. He could only tell by the worn monogrammed trunk that sat in front of his bed. The two other beds in the room were empty, Hogwarts having a shortage of Slytherin students that year. Harry cursed himself for leaving the map in his trousers back in his room but soon realised he didn't need it from the light coming from underneath Draco's bathroom door. Removing his cloak and dropping it on a chair, Harry crept up to the warped oaken door, leaning against the wall, listening. He could hear sniffling. Crying.
"They wouldn't. And if they did it'd be even scarier. I mean, they'd-they'd probably-I don't even want to imagine what they'd do to me. My family's fucked up."
“You’re an arse!” Harry shouted, and ran to his room to collect his few belongings and change. With a single suitcase, a backpack and a rattled-looking Hedwig, he ran down the narrow staircase and left his things by the front door and returned to the kitchen to retrieve Draco. Vernon was red as a tomato and panting, surrounded by every kitchen knife and fork from the drawer by the sink. Harry sighed.
"Draco you can only die once. And given your current state, I'm not entirely sure how much more torture you could handle. So...pursuing that path seems like a pointless endeavour. Why not...I dunno...help people. Um...yeah. Help people do stuff."
“Locomotor Mortis,” Draco said, his wand focused on the man. He leapt to Harry’s side, who was on the floor wiping blood from his face. Draco offered him a silk handkerchief and he took it gratefully, pressing it to the cut on his eye.
The wizard sighed and walked down the front steps to the curb, where Finchley was waiting in the Bentley.
Draco chuckled, ashamed that he was enjoying Potter’s admiration just a little bit, even if he couldn’t at all take credit for the place. He knew it was a magnificent home, but all he could think was
They drove down to the city, away from the vast asphalt strips of La Guardia and into a forest of skyscrapers until they reached a large hotel where men in uniforms with fans embroidered on them whisked the Audi off to the parking garage.
He just kept screaming, sickening popping and snapping noises coming from his body, blood leaking from his arm.
Hermione was passed out with her head against Ron’s shoulder and his jacket over hers. Luna was knitting, for some reason.
“Harry, what are you doing here? And you know what we’ve said about bringing people over!” She hissed, and it pained Draco to see him visibly wilt.
“You bloody fag! I was going to threaten to show him the pictures, but I bet you’d both get off on that, wouldn’t you?” He spat, and Harry froze.
was scrawled across the wizard's chest in blood and Harry quickly healed it, then moved on and tended to the small cut on the side of his neck and the bruised eye. Draco remained emotionless, staring just over Harry's shoulder, offering no response.
He called out again, and wandered into the second room to find the slytherin perched on his bed, munching listlessly on a bar of Honeyduke’s. He looked absolutely miserable.
The warm water of the shower hit his chest and washed away the crusted over vomit that had settled in the dip of his collarbones. Expert hands were at his back again, now slippery and smelling faintly of chrysanthemums.
"Sectumsempra," he whispered. Immediately, his back arched and huge bloody gashes appeared on his already-scarred torso, running down his arms and his neck. Blood erupted from the wounds, and Harry dropped his cloak and immediately ran to Draco's side. The blonde screamed in agony, Harry’s wand ghosted over the boy's quivering body.
The next time they see young Draco, his bloodied shirt was tossed on the bed and his torso was peppered with the bright-red of new bruises, which Roache healed with care.
“Oh fuck off already!” He shouted, and it only got louder. It was worse now. Before he’d be attacked by the younger students, who heard of the loathsome death eater in the building via their parents and thought it honourable to teach him a lesson. That was acceptable, in his eyes. It made sense.
He unrolled his sleeve to reveal the dark mark, black and mostly unmarred. There were no scars, apart from inflamed skin. He must’ve been scratching at it.
“That’s one strike, Harry. Two more and I break your little birdy’s neck. You remember what happened last week.”
They ended up agreeing that when the Yule Holidays arrived, he’d go home and collect his things and bid them goodbye.
He was passed a fluffy towel and for a moment he just stood there, the heat from the shower fleeing his body like it had somewhere to be. Harry left, and the cool draught floated in from the open door and snaked around Draco’s dripping waist. He snapped out of his trance and towelled most of himself off, then tied it around his waist like a sarong and padded out of the moist shower air. He noticed that his vomit-stained clothes were nowhere to be found and his fuzzy slippers were on the bathmat. He grinned and let himself continue to be pampered, drying his feet on the spongy material and sliding them, still damp, into the shearling-lined moccasins. Walking on clouds, he swung open his creaky closet door and shook the dust out of another pair of pyjamas which were slid over stiff joints with a little too much effort, then turned around to find the bed empty. He headed down two tightly-twisting staircases and a short corridor to the kitchen, where Harry was sitting atop the island watching the teapot, kicking the cabinets with the heels of his feet. He stopped as soon as Draco walked in, as if he felt it was disrespectful. It would have been, had they known each other half as well as they did and if Draco gave a damn. But he didn’t, and Harry seemed to sense this, for the assault on the wooden panels began once more.
Yet as the episode progressed, Draco found himself looking over Harry's shoulder, who sighed and rolled over on the bed to face him.
"Fuck..." he muttered under his breath, looking at the frothy mess in the cauldron. Draco rolled his eyes and stood up, face painted with an endearing smirk.
Harry shook a little. Draco’s nonchalance regarding the situation was...unsettling to say the least.
He thanked his mother for her odd fascination with Rococo and focused intently on the busy swirling patterns of its trim through the entire process. He trudged up the stairs to his room, licking toothpaste from his upper lip.
"Draco they're dead-not sure if you've noticed. Therefore rendering their 'wants' irrelevant. And no, no I don't think this is what they'd want."
She did a little bob that might have been meant to resemble a curtsy or something, and disappeared behind the maple door.
He’d half expected him to follow him in, to not trust him alone, but Draco escaped to his bedroom without a word and changed, and when he came back, Harry was waiting for him in the kitchen with two cups of hot chocolate.
Since his father had bought it for him, its usefulness was the only thing keeping him from destroying it. He had already incinerated all the gifts his father had given him over the years, including the jacket he’d gotten on his sixteenth. Lucius was a man who believed in function over form; the coat was lined with protective wards. It looked plain but it was sturdy. That one took extra long to burn when it joined the desk, shoes and various pens in the bonfire in his backyard. The neat, flawless lawn still bore a huge scorch mark he didn’t dare fix. It made him smile.
The pale boy slunk into the room silently and took his seat in the very back, looking his usual worn-out self. Harry cocked his head in concern, eyeing him across the room. Slughorn droned on about the practical use of medicated potions and the class remained only half-awake.
Harry looked around the library, noting the massive number of weathered volumes that collected dust on the shelves.
“Thank god his father isn’t around for this. He’d have...it wouldn’t have been good. The man was worse than you remember. Poor Dray could never catch a break.”
. It was slightly fainter and ran messily across his ribcage backwards, and Harry had a sneaking suspicion it was so he could read it in the mirror. The notion made him sick.
“Accio firebolt,” Draco whispered and the fastest of his brooms hurtled across the grounds and swept them fifty feet into the air.
He'd cast a pain hex on himself. Harry could see him with a wand to his heart, sickly green light flowing from its tip.
The distinct sound of a body hitting the floor made Harry wince, and he wished he could turn the volume down but the remote was on the other side of the couch and Draco would have stopped him.
“Sorry Dray,” he said. “I just thought-I mean, you brought company, so-by the way, I’m Roache, nice to meet you.”
Draco took his hand and lead him inside to the concierge desk, Harry gawking at the well-lit rotunda in the middle of the ceiling. He was led into a very shiny elevator and deposited in a vast hallway with doors that all looked the same, little tables with orchids and a mirror here and there. Draco scanned the numbers that dotted the walls until he found their suite, and swiped the card in front of the scanner. The door unlocked audibly and he sauntered inside. It was a rather spacious arrangement with a bedroom, lounge and a mini bar with a coffee maker, snacks and alcohol.
"Yes, I have noticed that about you. Have you ever thought that -?" He paused at the feeling of glasses sliding onto his nose. "Von. I can put on my own glasses."
Jill shrugged, easy and compliant, and led the way to their room. It had already been discussed over the dinner table that they would share, though how it had come about Harry wasn't quite sure. He glanced at Jill, frowned a silent question to be sure she was comfortable with the arrangement, and had been offered a nod in reply.
"How did you make me do that?" Jackie had all but shouted after he'd coaxed her into attempting the 'floating arm' trick.
The issue was that Draco couldn't find it within himself to care. Since he'd returned to London barely a day before, since he'd accepted that he was a free man – if only physically, for society still kept him imprisoned – Draco had hit a wall. It was a wall that he refused to consider just yet, but even such refusal couldn't be ignored forever when it barred his path so effectively. Draco couldn't even see over that wall to what potentially lay beyond.
"Jackie, get us out of here," Pansy said with a faintly curl of her lip. "I might need a bite to eat to keep my own breakfast down after seeing that."
Scoffing beneath his breath, Draco shook his head. He hadn't thought Harry would have suited modelling, but the mould he'd been set in seemed a perfect design. It was almost as though he wasn't allowed a mind of his own; he was simply a face before a camera, in a magazine, before adoring eyes that prayed as much to their Saviour in thanks as they did whatever God appealed to them.
For perhaps the first time, Draco wished it had been a Howler. At least that way he wouldn't have to look at the letter anymore where it sat in all of its eloquence and succinctness after picking him apart. This one… This one was different.
Harry Potter had lost his anger, and with it, Draco had assumed he'd lost his voice. He'd assumed that, like so many models he'd come across, he had retreated into being a voiceless, obliging doll before the camera, malleable and obedient, with little tendency towards more active responses when away from the limelight, too. From what Draco had seen, he'd appeared to be just that.
if not directly hear. His hands clutched at Ipetsky's stupidly spikey hair, making a mess of it, but Ipetsky didn't seem to care. He didn't even seem to notice, on his knees as he was, mouth wrapped around Harry's arousal and one hand clasping Harry's arse as his fingers –
"Don't kill anyone, Jackie," Harry said. Despite his sudden disappointment in the Hogwarts prefects he'd previously thought were kind of lright, he didn't want any bloodshed.
He'd heard it before. Essentially, Draco had heard it only the previous day. But just as it felt different speaking his own feelings aloud that morning, if felt different hearing Harry's, too.
"Sorry," Harry said, giving an apologetic pat to the shoulder of whoever he'd grabbed. It was definitely becoming harder to make out faces.
But it didn't feel like such a bad thing. There was no animosity anymore. If expensive clothes were something someone like Draco clung to, he could wear them. It didn't bother Harry, had nothing to do with him, and there wasn't really any reason to point it out.
Eyes springing open, Harry's head snapped forward. His back slammed against the door where his hands had been as he darted a wild glance around the room. A voice? Someone was -? Someone else was in the Room?
, Sirius knelt. Blinking up at him hazily, Harry reached a feeble hand up to those that grasped both of his shoulders. Skinned knuckles met his stinging fingertips, Sirius' hands trembling where he held him.
"And thirdly," Harry continued, raising a third finger and jabbing it in Draco direction, "I'm not a wizard. Not anymore. Besides, the correct term is magician, thank you very much."
"You're Harry bloody Potter," he always grumbled. "They're a bunch of hypocrites, they are. One minute they're saying how you're the bee's knees for what you've done for the world and all, and how that gives you the right to do whatever the bloody hell you want, while in the next breath they're saying how you should be for witches and wizards only or – or how you shouldn't be so familiar with Muggles, or – I don't know, some bullshit about it 'not being right'…"
Harry's mind immediately leapt back to the image of Draco's aunt, the screaming, crazed woman, and the sobriety of Draco's gaze as he'd stared at it. He nodded, squeezing Draco's fingers briefly. "You okay?"
"So it seems," Pansy said with a humming chuckle. Turning, she beckoned Draco with a flick of her finger. "Come along, then, cameraman. I'll treat you to lunch before we head over there."
Jill's lips pursed in a way that Harry knew meant she was swallowing a smile. "It usually is when someone is openly ogling someone else at every given opportunity."
Skirting the table, Harry sidled past his mother to stick his head into the pantry. His riffling was distraction enough for Lily to drop her plate onto the counter and turn towards him.
Draco grunted in reply. He might have said more, too, but whatever words rose upon his tongue died as he stepped into the adjacent room and caught sight of the spread before him.
If anything, it only made Harry love Sirius even more. He was more than just fun, even if he was a kid at heart.
"Aw, come on, Harry," Ron said between snorts of his own laughter. "You're the favourite face of the Muggle and Wizarding world. You know it's our job to make sure you don't get a big head."
Draco actually spared her an extended glance this time, which was more than he'd done to each of Harry's friends at their sparse questions or comments in his direction. "Happenstance," he said.
Only then did he turn and, shoving his hands back into his pockets, hasten into the warmth of his house. In a few quick bounds, Harry leapt up the short steps to his front door, swinging it shut behind him and locking the frozen night of chilled kisses and glowing magic behind him. It was a secret. His and Draco's secret, both the magic and the romance. Though Harry might want the whole world to know about what he shared with Draco – that Draco was, even just a little part of him, his – he loved the thought that their quiet moments of intimacy were only theirs to share.
"Do you think," Harry said slowly, chewing over each word before voicing it, "that dying can change things about you?"
It wasn't hard anymore. Easier with a wand, but not as hard as it had been. Impossibly easy compared to what felt so short a time ago, trapped in a room and grasping for the insubstantial tendrils of magic. The effect of it as he conjured it, tingling down his arm and spreading across his palm, was immediate this time.
Without another word, she swept away, past and behind the couch and out of sight. Head slightly tipped, Harry listened to the sound of her footsteps as she made her way up to the girls dormitory. His hand didn't slow in its gentle ministrations of Draco's hair. The comfortable silence left in Pansy's wake hadn't really been disturbed in the first place.
Harry didn't want to. He didn't want to talk to the strange women before him, the portraits, the smiling, gentle, listening owners of 'pairs of ears' that were more than ready to witness the telling of his supposed woes. Harry thought he might have preferred to never speak another word again.
Swallowing down the tightness in his throat, Harry shook his head. Propping his elbow on the table, he dropped his chin into his palm. "Not just me. You too."
And where…? Hogwarts. At Hogwarts, in the Dragon's Nest boys dormitory. Yes, he could remember that, too. He'd fallen to sleep beside the window, which wasn't for the first time. He usually didn't manage to properly sleep, though, spending the night staring across the dark grounds before clambering stiffly to his feet and retreating to his cold bed before the rest of the dormitory began to haul itself into wakefulness.
"Yes. Yes, it's probably good timing, though I'll admit a part of me begrudges the opportunities missed. But those opportunities will just as likely put you unfavourably in the spotlight and potentially lead to incidents that are better avoided. You're right; Chosen One Fever lingers at the moment."
"Hello," Harry said, offering a small smile. He held out a hand. "Sorry, I don't speak German. I'm Harry. I was watching you before, you're very –"
Harry nodded slowly, ignoring Pansy's sighing "shut the fuck up, Zabini, honestly". "You two spent the Christmas break with him, then?"
"And you know," sniffing again, Ron turned back out the window, "any time you wanted to tell us anything, or who this guy is? Even if you just wanted to tell me? Go for it. I'm all ears, Harry."
"Wonderful. Well, can you maybe do it without acting like a circling dragon? I'm kind of expecting you to start spitting fire any second now."
It was barely a flame, little more than a candle's flicker of light, but it appeared. A flame suspended over his palm, stuttering and winking but not disappearing. A gasp, almost a sob, slipped from Harry's lips.
Draco could only stare at her, shaking his head slightly as she trailed off into pondering. Monique Bordeaux was an up-and-coming fashion guru. Hailing from France, she'd spread her talons throughout Europe in a remarkably swift progression. That Pansy, a journalist and interviewer with less than two years of experience, and the family of Death Eaters to boot, had landed herself a job with the woman herself was nothing short of miraculous. Some speculated that she used underhanded means to achieve her goals. Others that it was her infamy and her family's war crimes that stirred interest in celebrities and thus gained her a foot in the door.
"Is this an attempt to slack off?" Jackie asked. "Because with how much homework I've already got piling up, I wholly approve. Good job, Harry."
"Jackie, magic was fun," Harry said, breaking into her animated spiel that included more arm waving than she likely needed, "but it's the
Had he been wrong to assume something with Harry? Something with Ipetsky? Pansy wasn't the only one who had done her homework on Harry's line of work; Draco knew Harry had modelled for Ipetsky years ago, in his earlier and still tentative days. He'd assumed…
Pansy seemed not in the least deterred by his blatant hostility. She propped an elbow onto the arm of her chair, her chin resting in her cupped hand. "Oh, I doubt that. Surely you've heard the stories of him. I've not doubt you've even deliberately sought them out."
"Aren't they practically the same thing?" Harry asked. He fought the urge to shift in his seat, a telling sign of his own discomfort.
But no. Truth be told, Harry was still stunned that Draco was curious enough about him to date him. Because, as it turned out, that was what they were doing. Harry had asked, just to be sure, because leaving the situation unspecified was torturous.
"And who better to do it than Renee? She's incredible, Harry. Hell, if I was an apprentice still, I'd want to be training under her."
"We'll skim over the big incidents in your school years," she continued, eyeing Draco sidelong once more as she did so. "We'll touch on that a bit more in the next sitting, I think, with the war. That one will have to be a big one, so… we're looking at half the day? Maybe extending it further?"
It was sickening. Draco hated it. But it fit. It fit Harry and what he'd become, what he'd been forced to become, like a glove. Draco was coming to many such realisations of late. He wasn't sure he liked stepping out of distanced ignorance.
"You should take more pride in my styling." Frowning, Von stepped around him and began skillfully rearranging the disruption Harry had apparently made of his hair. He was a tall man, and with the accompaniment of a frequent, disapproving frown when focused on his work, Von had a tendency to loom. "You're killing me, bub."
Pansy was probably right. She often was about such things, and even more so when those things were based predominantly upon observation. Pansy had an eye like a hawk.
"I think you're one of the few in the world who would think that," Draco said, though a hint of pride settled within him at her words. Madame Clementine thought he was 'apt' and 'dedicated'. There was little higher praise in the industry.
Harry knew better, and not only because Draco had whispered, "None of us have ever actually seen a real movie before except in Muggle Studies". To view the three of them as an ignorant outsider, sprawled across the minimal furnishings in one of their three rooms, Draco, Blaise, and Pansy were all wide-eyed converts to the Bond franchise.
"Wonderful," Hermione said, and she sounded like she really meant it. The way she too shook Jill's hand was almost too enthusiastic, but she sounded like she whole-heartedly meant it when she continued with, "I'm really looking forward to this project."
Never done anything? What, never acted upon his feelings? Draco grit his teeth, took another deep breath, spared another glance for their distant, almost disappeared entourage, before planting his full attention onto Harry. Harry, who was watching him with his eyes still wide and such blatant, almost childlike ignorance it was infuriating. How could he not know?
Harry nodded. He spared a final glance over his shoulder before taking a moment more to meet McGonagall's eyes. "As a suggestion, if you happen to need it, Ginny would make a brilliant captain."
Harry listened more than he spoke. Even as weariness weighed upon his shoulders, the company of his friends was doing him wonders. Nothing was fixed yet, and everything hadn't returned to normal, but it gave him hope that it might get there. Maybe.
"Since when do you keep tabs on what I have for lunch," Harry asked, raising his eyebrow in mocking suspicion. "No, that's not creepy at all."
Harry had been outcast since his first year in high school. At twelve, he'd come out to his parents, and the secret had somehow slipped into the ears of his classmates. School life took a turn when so many looked at him like he was disgusting, or strange, or as though he might contaminate them if he stood too close. And it might have hurt –
The tallest of his friends, because it had somehow become a competition. The best flier. The first of his dorm-mates to be chosen on the quidditch team. Perfect dress, perfect hair, perfect performance in his potions and perfect handwriting, which was another source of derision from Pansy that Draco perceived as ineffectually veiled envy.
"Oh – oh, Dot?" Meghan visibly shook herself, wrenching her gaze Harry and Draco's arms. A moment of staring passed before she shook herself again, and just like that, the professional efficiency she so often exhibited reinstated itself. Turning on her heel, she trotted back towards her desk and flipped through the diary. "Won't be a moment."
"Hello," he said, tipping his heat in a nod of greeting. "My name is Draco Malfoy. I've got an appointment with Madame Clementine."
With that, he produced as if from thin air a sheaf of cards and spread them in a perfect array before him to the smiling and murmuring delight of the crowd. Descending into further theatrics, fingers sweeping and wriggling, he played his audience like a fiddler with his fiddle.
Draco's expression was intent. So intent, so focused, and impossible to look away from even if Harry had wanted to. He felt abruptly exhausted, physically and mentally, but he was strangely captivated by Draco as he had grown increasingly over the weeks.
He'd expected it. Draco had expected the hatred that was to come with being Harry Potter's photographer. He knew Pansy had, too, and knew she also accepted the backlash in the face of what was offered to act as a counter-weight. That weight was notoriety.
Lucerne was beautiful in a way that London wasn't. A foreign, captivating kind of beautiful. And yet for once, Harry barely saw it.
"I'll never understand why they call them 'professor' at Hogwarts," Jackie said when Mrs. Joyce had finished. Hitching the stack of library books in her hands, they made for the lines of discarded chairs. "Is professor somehow superior to teacher or something?"
That Harry found his own feet leading him to the Slytherin table was only partially surprising. The numbers worked out, after all, and when he considered the class as a whole… the ex-Slytherins weren't ostracised anymore, or at least no more than they afflicted upon themselves, but wariness and awkwardness still radiated from their corner of the room. Harry had already crossed the dividing line a handful of times that year, spoken up when he could even if he didn't really want to, if only to set an example for others to follow. It was a strange phenomenon, but if he'd learned anything in the past few months it was that people watched him whether he wanted them to or not. They watched him and, sometimes, they even followed. He may as well make the most of the unwanted attention.
"We don't doubt your capabilities, Dot," Von said, stepping to her side. "We're only supporting them to –"
"Why would you possibly think we would partner with you?" the girl asked, tone curling as much as her lip.
The night of September first in the eighth-year tower – the 'Dragon's Nest' as it would be called within a week of school's resumption – was always going to be uncomfortable.
"Shut up, Zabini," Parkinson said, and the sound of a thud gave Harry the startling impression that she'd kicked him under the table. Zabini's shit-eating grin, a little tamer than those he might have once worn but sincere nonetheless, only added to the impression.
It wasn't the first potions analysis they'd done. Granted, Harry hadn't ever taken a look at one and really paid attention to what he was doing, and with a year between himself and his last real Potions experiment he was more than a little rusty. But Malfoy clearly knew what he was doing, and as he settled himself atop the stool, scooting up to the microscope and murmuring a vaguely suggestive "you can start looking for potions with peppermint essence, if you want. I can smell it" he got to work.
"Because apparently you were distracted with dying your hair green this morning," Harry said. He ducked as Jackie swiped a hand at his head.
"Sacramento green?" Harry snorted. "Who the fuck says 'sacramento green'?" He nudged Draco's leg with his foot before tucking it onto the edge of his chair as Draco made to poke him back. Harry kind of liked that he did, too. It was almost friendly.
Harry swallowed a laugh. The blond kid – Draco, the girl had called him – clearly hadn't meant it to be amusing, but it kind of was. He shared a glance with Jackie only long enough to roll his eyes. She looked entirely too pleased with the situation.
Then she was off, clicking her way across the foyer and striding through the doors at the end of the room on the tail of a departing man. Draco stared after her for a moment, glanced back towards the elevators, then turned and followed in her footsteps.
to be here, then," Jackie said shortly. "Just drop the unit if you're not going to do the proper work."
The unfinished threat was understood despite its incompleteness. Draco had no intention of acting up. Despite the crowds, the potential for ostracism if not outright acts of hatred, there was something comforting about being back in his own country again. Even if his parents weren't with him this time, and even if unfavourable memories did wash up a little more frequently. Draco was relieved to be home.
Someone cleared their throat. Harry didn't realise it was Hermione until she took a handful of striding steps forwards and extracted her wand from the sleeve of her robes. "Well," she said, only the deep breath preceding her words bellying her confident tone, "we might as well fix it up a little, right? It's going to be home for a year, after all. Why not add a splash of colour or two?"
Harry smiled. Invigoration Draughts were far from the worst thing used that he'd come across in the industry, from models, managers, and crewman alike, but the higher-ups still frowned upon overuse of them. Even if they oftentimes did make such gruelling demands, the agency Harry worked with – and many others, if word of mouth spoke the truth – didn't tolerate the misuse of potions or chemicals from models or behind-the-scenes workers.
"What, did you need me to hold your hand and show you the way?" she replied. "Hell, Harry, I didn't realise your eyesight were
Harry had no doubt that Ginny had said something public about the Jackdawson situation. She usually did.
Harry couldn't even imagine what it must be like to have such a horror for a relative. He'd thought his uncle Vernon was bad. He nodded regardless. "That would have been so awkward."
Except that it was different now. Just a little. Almost unexpectedly, what added to the wealth of colours in his stare wasn't pity. It wasn't even really sympathy, nor compassion, but something else. Something Harry couldn't understand and something that pervaded even through the touch of anger that still inexplicably lingered.
People like Draco. People like Pansy. People like the accused Death Eaters who had been little more than victims of war themselves and couldn't escape the accusations. They didn't deserve it. They didn't –
Squeezing Draco's hand again, Harry dropped his cheek onto his shoulder. "I wouldn't have picked it," Harry murmured, quietly enough that he could be ignored if that was what Draco wanted. "She doesn't look much like you."
welled within him. But it was less of a struggle than it had been only a week before to shove the thought aside. Almost easy to focus more on the warmth of Draco's fingers, his gaze, and the tight, clenching feeling in Harry's gut that he'd always gotten with Draco but seemed all the more significant these days.
There would be time to talk to the crew. To the supervisor, the models as Draco made a point of doing when they were obliging enough to actually speak to him, and to Clementine herself. But not today. The final day of shooting promised a distinct drop in commitment hours over the next few days, and Draco was determined to embrace that distinction immediately. The trip might be for work, but with Harry in company, Draco had decided to make it not only work.
They continued to walk for a time in silence, a comfortable silence that held none of the tension that Harry knew others experienced with their exes. He and Ginny had never had that. They'd never had a break up talk, never discussed how to 'stay friends' when Harry still kept up with Ron and Ginny happened to persist in being his sister, and they'd never danced around the subject of spending time with one another in the same friendship group. It just sort of… happened.
Sirius only laughed harder, and Harry found that he didn't really mind. Or he wouldn't have, if it hadn't provoked the thought. Shagging Draco Malfoy? He was only human, after all.
"Hey," he said by way of greeting, glancing between Malfoy, Parkinson, and Zabini. "You're stuck for numbers too?"
Harry shrugged as Draco finally disappeared around the distant corner. He hadn't asked why Draco had taken to randomly snapping shots over the past few days, and for all he knew, it could be for a number of reason. To sell in future to the highest bidder, for planning of the next shoots in the interview series, simply to test out his camera – whichever reason, it wasn't like Harry really minded. If it suited Draco to take them, if he wanted to, and so long as Harry knew when it was happening, he could have at it.
Thank you so much to the lovely mods of the Draco Tops Harry fest! I'm so happy to get the chance to partake this year - the last few years I haven't been able to have been such a regret - so I really hope you enjoy the story.
There was a moment, as he'd known there would be, when something reared in him and protested. When the reminder that he was at school, that people would see, that something would happen or someone would do something
Just as she didn't when, planting his glass onto the table before him once more, Draco gestured to the sheaf of papers she'd been reading upon his arrival. "What's this, then? You were certainly making a show of sincere attentiveness."
Glancing towards Draco, his reply died on his lips as he watched Draco draw alongside the table. He placed his own lunch on the table before fiddling briefly with the camera hanging around his neck and take a slight step towards the window. Impassivity swirled in a juxtaposing mix with his concentration, the slight crease on his brow that Harry had witnessed throughout the shooting that day and then before, with his own shoots, the only interruption of his mask. He watched as Draco took a handful of snaps before lowering the camera and frowning instead down at the screen as he flicked through it.
Jackie scrunched her nose. "Are you kidding me? I don't do the study thing. Trust me, you wouldn't want me to help. Right, Harry?"
The room was wide, open, and seemingly larger than should have been possible for an indoor space, though without the Enlargement Charms of magic. Windowless, it held none of the closeted gloominess that was often entailed in internal rooms; rather, the glaringly white walls reflected in the simple, similarly white table and the inky dark floor made it seem larger, brighter, and more open. Even the overhead lights beaming down upon the hardwood were white rather than yellow, starkly enhancing a yellow arrow in centre of the floor directly before the desk and seats that was the only mar upon the otherwise empty room. Despite the seeming randomness of it, the arrow and placement of furniture appeared nothing if not perfectly precise.
the very day after the first interview had aired. Cameras snapping, voices shouting, askance made as though every reporter and their attentive readers had the right to know – which Harry supposed they sort of did. But even so…
Draco broke away from his friends at the same moment, meeting him halfway. Harry wasn't sure who reached for who first, but he found himself with his hand in Draco's, the weight of his closeness a radiating warmth against the chilly morning, and press of his lips against his own chasing away the unpleasantness of a day apart. Was it only a day? Really only one day? It felt like far longer.
"That's just 'cause Jill's a sweetheart who asks nicely rather than demanding like you do," Harry replied, folding his planner and tucking it away. The lunch hour never felt long enough, and he could almost hear the precursor for the bell ringing in the air. "But no, I'm not going to abuse the fact that she's the only one who can get Abel to do anything."
"Don't worry about it." Harry piled his discarded books together and slung his bag over his shoulder. He spared them both a smile. "Catch you after class, 'kay?"
"You don't have to if you don't want to. I mean, if you had study or something, or were doing something else –"
He was gone. And Harry was alone. And Draco could have taken a picture, could have the scoop that Pansy suggested was so useful for him, but he didn't. He could only stare and then flinch at the weight of Harry's words when he spoke in a murmur.
And yet, as they spoke – of Pansy for a time, because it was easy to talk of her, and then of Harry's friends, which Draco was unexpectedly open to listening about – though his anger didn't disappear entirely, it did fade to negligibility. It wasn't important at that moment. Not anymore. A shard of cold ice that would surely swell should Harry see any of Draco's attackers again still nestled indignantly within him, but it was easily overlooked. Easily tucked away.
"Nothing too heavy, then?" Draco nodded, entirely unfazed. "There's a little Vietnamese joint just around the corner that's fairly reputable if you've a mind. You didn't have anything for lunch today, so that shouldn't be too bad, should it?"
Bellatrix was gaunt, hollow-cheeked and wan. Her hair was a crazed mess, hanging around her shoulders in lank chunks and bunches of matted curls. She was so painfully thin that not even her shadowy cloak could hide it, and the hand sticking out of one frayed sleeve looked like a gnarled, bony appendage rather than a proper hand, grasping the short length of a wand.
Head dropped to his knees, Harry could only wait. He knew he should do something but what was there to do? What was he supposed to do in such an utterly unprecedented situation? Between all the algebra and group presentations, his school seemed to have skipped over outlining exactly what to do in the case of an abduction.
A strangled whimper made its way through the roaring in his ears, and Harry knew detachedly that it came from himself. He didn't care. He didn't care that it was pathetic, that it may seem weak, that those around him would have likely been more than a little stunned to hear it. Just as he didn't care that he was very likely being watched as he crashed into Draco and clung to him, arms locking around him crushingly tight and face seeking the solace of his shoulder. Eyes closing, struggling for breath, Harry held Draco like it was the only thing keeping him upright. It probably was.
Any such thoughts abandoned him, however, when the golden sparkles coalesced into tangible form in the air before him. Barely bigger than his hand, the translucent creature emitted a faint glow softer than a lightbulb and somehow purer. It wasn't that which drew the smile to Harry's lips, however.
Staring back at the photograph without really seeing it, Draco affected disregard. "I have no idea. I'm sure something will crop up."
Harry abruptly realised he hadn't the foggiest idea of how to get from A to B, or even if Draco wanted to get to B at all. If Harry himself would be up for it or if he would – if he would just –
"I'm not – it's not that I –" Harry cut himself off, pursed his lips, and frowned. He drew his gaze sidelong, aware but not quite able to stop himself from easing from his rigidity into the comfort Draco's lap. "Last I checked, we didn't like each other. Do we?"
"Which, personally, I question, given that every seventeen-year-old in the world in probably fucking or getting sloshed when they go out to party."
"I've been pulling her weight for the last six years of school," he'd said, absently flipping through a book. "She's not stupid, but I'm smarter, and thus apparently responsible for pulling her sorry arse through her education. Childhood friends are a menace."
"I don't think anyone's really knows for sure about that thing, do they?" James had said, slinging an arm around Harry's shoulders. "But however you feel and whoever you fancy, Bambi, you know your mum and I will support you. Always."
The studio, the wall of pictures, the artistry he'd gleaned – that might have been enough to entice Draco in pursuit of everything Pansy and Dimitri had to offer. But seeing that one photograph…
It wasn't direct permission, but it was enough for Harry. Turning, he picked up his pace and fall into step at Draco's side, squeezing his hand as much in agreement as to assure himself that he was still holding it as they dove into the semi-darkness.
Harry winced. A habit. Was that a bad thing? "Sorry," he muttered, glancing down at himself again, at Draco's lazy recline that was probably not as comfortable as he was pretending it was. Maybe he was overstepping his boundaries. Shifting in place, he rose onto his knees to to climb to his feet. "I'll just – maybe I should just –"
It was only half-full, a speckling of the professors choosing to partake their meals alone and away from the near-constant company of students, but McGonagall was there. With the hall bubbling with noise, peak breakfast hour living up to its name, Harry doubted they would have been able to hold much of a conversation with one another anyway. As he climbed up the steps, he caught the eye of a number of them, shared a nod or two, and stopped before McGonagall.
back rooms. Maybe it was the way he'd shot a glare so venomously towards the space of Sammy's absence that it surely would have struck him dead had he still stood there. Or maybe it was the iron-hard clasp of his hand on Harry's shoulders as he'd pulled him into Apparition.
Flipping up the collar of his jacket to shield his neck, Harry hunched his shoulders as soon as he stepped out of the building of
Harry recognised her. He knew her smile – that smile of lips just a little too wide to be classically attractive – and he knew the arch of her eyebrows, too unmoving to be anything but pencilled on, if professionally so. He even recognised the customary linked chain that fell down the neck of her blouse to hang near her navel, the little frame of a caged bluebird pendant at the very bottom. Harry had learnt that reporters often clung to a particular style, to a noticeable feature, to a specific manner of presenting themselves, even, to make themselves more memorable. This was simply Gertrude Hitchcock's version.
A body, but it wasn't breathing. A child, but it didn't look like a child, more like a flayed homunculus in a bed of its own seeping fluids. It was horrible. It was pathetic, and miserable and – horrible. Harry couldn't look away, even as he pressed himself against the wall as if to seep into and through it.
It was a daunting task yet somehow seemed almost expected in his circumstances. Expected of the wild, crazed turn his life had taken. But he would face it all because there was no other choice. Bellatrix was terrifying and Harry was exhausted. He was next to useless, swaying with weakness from days,
"Ministry support," Lily explained. "We got given a grant for the exceptional circumstances. It's very considerate of them."
Harry chuckles. “No, no. No take-backs, unfortunately. Now you’ll have to tell me all your other dreams about me, especially the wank fantasies.”
After healing the scrape on his face and his throbbing side, Draco spends the rest of his workday in a daze. He helps the customers that come in, skips through his lunch to hold a cheery conversation with his coworkers, goes over his notes on the Wolfsbane potion with Mr Winthrop, and helps Sarah in the labs. Draco doesn’t allow himself to feel the crushing weight of his devastation until he steps out of the Floo at his Fitzrovia flat. His hand flies out to the fireplace mantle to steady himself, when he’s startled.
“First of all,” she starts brusquely, an eyebrow raised high in sassy indignation, “like it or not, I
His head is full of so many questions and startling, frightening poignant answers that he’s tried to bury for so long. He wants to cry. He only avoids the onslaught of tears by belatedly realising that the men who had caught him snogging are exiting the toilets, all three of them turning to laugh in his direction. He still needs to pee, badly. He turns back towards the toilets, sniffling.
“Draco...Please forgive me. Please, you—you have to forgive me. You have to forgive me, please,” Harry sobs. “I’m so sorry. I, I’ve been disgusting towards you. I’m so sorry I ever blamed you for...for his…for...”
“Snog,” Harry says softly, his hands clenching and unclenching. In the darkness, he’s unable to see even a hint of Draco’s face, which may all be for the best at this point, but he can
Draco pushes himself off the wall. “I have to—” he trails off, his body feeling unsteady, lost in the blaze of Harry’s eyes. “I have to leave now. Standing here hurts, looking at you fucking
Harry wraps his arms around him, a deep, satisfied sigh escaping him. “I’m so happy to have you back in my arms. I missed you so much, sometimes I was scared I’d just...stop existing. The fear of not having you here with me, sleeping beside me, loving me, it’s unbearable.”
Upon the lift doors opening, Harry thrusts the bottle of wine into Malfoy’s arms. “Do you know your neighbour hates you?” he asks, stepping further into the familiar, large sitting room.
Sneaking into the Ministry after hours proves to be incredibly easy. On the night before the Great Harry Potter is to be buried, the Ministry is practically a ghost-town, the usual overnight Aurors nowhere in sight by the Floos in the Atrium. Draco has donned his lab coat and brought along his briefcase to appear as if he’s there for a long night of research. The one security guard he does pass gets on the lift as Draco gets on. The Auror looks exhausted but nods at Draco before shuffling towards the Atrium.
I deserve one of these sugary fizzy drinks.” Harry smiles at him. They’re sitting shoulder to shoulder, legs crossed on one of Molly’s infamous multi-coloured quilts. The bright pink and yellow colours were a bit blinding, but Harry has grown very attached to it over the years. Despite the summer air and sunshine that they were privy to earlier in the day, the temperature has dropped now that evening is approaching and people gather at Brompton Cemetery for a film.
"I certainly can. Think about it-their parents probably told them about the war, about how I'm dangerous, just like they worship you. It's really no surprise they came after me."
Harry thought, but stuck to sipping it quietly, then put the glass down gently on the granite countertop.
He found him in the walk-in, picking out clothing and folding it into a case and and zipping three suits into bags made solely for that purpose.
He only got a glare from the raven-haired young man across him, the young man who, Draco noted, looked absolutely ravishing in that jumper he’d picked out.
Draco and Hecatia ate their cake, and Narcissa pardoned herself to the other room, only to be dragged half the way there by her husband.
“Nope. I have not repaid you yet. No redemption, I don’t care if you forgive me or not, I’m still guilty as hell, I fucked up, I-“
Harry smirked and headed for the door, followed by Draco who promptly locked it behind them. The brunette chose to walk to Gryffindor tower, hoping it might help to calm his boyfriend’s nerves.
Neither of them make eye contact for a short while, Draco chewing on his lip and Harry fiddling with his hands.
With that, Draco swiftly strode down the hall, the enormous heavy doors clunking shut and leaving Harry in the vacant room.
“Blimey, will you two quiet down?” Harry grumbled from his perch in the large wingback, looking through the glasses down his nose and scrunching his eyes.
“Yep. Bella was her little sister. Mother always...she always said that she was a rebel without a cause. We all hoped to god she’d find one-y’know, something to fight for. I guess in a sense it was our fault, too. What happened.”
“Bullying me,” he read. The two words were all the way at the bottom of the page, all messy and crammed in like they held no value. And they didn’t, not anymore.
Harry just smiled and put down two mugs of a warm tea his mother had bought and never opened. It was called
Potter just giggled and wrapped his arms around his torso comfortably. Draco made no comment when the hinge of Harry’s glasses dug steadily into the his spine.
Draco was full-on sobbing now, and the gryffindor inched closer apprehensively just to have the troubled wizard practically fling himself at him. He sobbed into his chest, and Roache made eye contact with Harry over Draco’s shoulder, his face unreadable.
He returned as soon as possible, sitting across from the older boy and putting the warm drink on the table in front of him, where the froth was scrutinised by Draco as if it had offended him.
"Dolor aggravesci," he whispered, feeling the throbbing in his abdomen flare up. He rolled his neck and swung the door open.
It occurred to Draco that he was supposed to be feeling something, perhaps the gravity of the situation. But no...nothing. He just shrugged.
He banged his head loudly on the doorframe of the small cupboard and held his forehead as he emerged. She cringed.
Draco just shook his head, concluding that it would take at least thirty trunks to pack up just his wardrobe.
"I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry..." Harry whispered, muttering incantations to heal him. His bones popped back into place and it was agony.
Draco rattled off all the horrible things he’d done, all the reasons he hated himself and Harry just continued scribbling, handwriting growing messier and messier until Draco ran out of mistakes.
Draco's facade started to crumble away and he got up to open a closet in the wall, staring at his reflection. Harry had never seen such hatred in his eyes. He began to wonder if perhaps coming was a mistake.
“I’m-I’m sorry, Harry. I shouldn’t have made you watch this, I-it was selfish. A shitty thing to do. I didn’t realise that, and-“ he was cut off by seventy-kilograms of muscley wizard wrapping itself around him.
The brunette removed the wand without difficulty, prying it out of Malfoy's fingers and crawling back into bed next to him.
He grinned devilishly and sucked the dessert off the spoon in a way that made Draco’s heart do the macarena in his chest and
“Nothing. Nothing at all. But apparently, he can’t get a hold of my parents-for obvious reasons-and so he wants to know what the hell’s going on.
The wizard sighed happily in a ‘what can you do? Love him to pieces, though’ sort of way and nodded.
and stomped up the stairs. The slytherin took the seat across from Hermione and tried his best to look like he belonged.
“Your parents pressured you into joining a terrorist organisation. And in the end, when it mattered, you left, knowing full well that it put your life in danger. And, icing on the cake, you helped bring them down. Anyone would say that’s redemption enough.”
Once they got into Hogsmeade and strode through the inviting doors of the Three Broomsticks, Harry ushered Draco into a booth.
“Draco. I fought to save my own skin. I didn’t give a rat’s ass whether Snape lived. Or you. Or anyone else in this blasted school, aside from Ron and Hermione. And I failed to protect them, too. So what I’m trying to say is...I’m not some saint you have to repent to. I know that’s terribly presumptious of me, but...you know what I mean. I’m just as bad as you, only more cowardly. Don’t forget, you offered me your hand at the beginning of all this. I turned you down.”
The pale wizard bit down hard on his shredded lower lip and used the sprayer to clean all the cuts off as best he could. He stumbled out and grabbed a washcloth from the cupboard, hissing as the fibres stuck. The one on his stomach just kept gushing.
His body ached, and he realised it was because he’d been sitting awkwardly against the headboard all night. Draco was still in his arms and he slowly slipped out of his grasp. His slid his slippers and dressing gown on, then shut the door quietly and tiptoed downstairs to the kitchen, where he stared into the pantry for a good six minutes before realising he had no idea what he was doing, and should probably consult the internet. He did, and started looking for ingredients when Hermione’s voice startled him.
“You have, Draco, a hundred times over. You betrayed me, you were an arse when we were kids but you know what? You’ve suffered a hundred times what I have. I was a martyr, of sorts. I…”
“What do you feel guilty about. What have you done. What are all the mistakes, the people you’ve killed.”
“Yeah, it’s comfy. Not the nicest hotel in the city, mind you, but I’m trying to set a good example for Saddler. He’s the man who’s going to help me manage everything my parents left behind. ‘Thinks I’m too young and reckless to be trusted, so I’m trying not to splurge.”
“Oh, and by the way-y’know, I’d feared he’d hook up with some abusive arshole because-well, daddy issues but you seem relatively tame. However, I swear on my mother’s grave, Harry, if you so much as hurt a single hair on that boy’s head you shall be flayed alive and fed to the gargoyles, understood?”
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry, and this is so awkward, because now we’re both naked and you’ve got to-well, take care
There were also countless slash marks, like he'd been stabbed over and over again, then attacked by a paper shredder.
Though through all his complaints and condemnations of modern aviation, he still hadn’t managed to unbuckle the belt.
rather comically-as he stepped out into the vast foyer of the Malfoy household. The ceiling looked as if it really were soaring, painted like an old cathedral with subjects that moved and there was intricate dark green marble everywhere. It battled with the warm, glowy light that seemed to come from nowhere. Harry looked to Draco, who was entirely unfazed and instead annoyedly brushed some soot from his shoulder and sauntered underneath the left side of the grand staircase into a sitting room that was…
The two crept through the portrait hole, past a disapproving looking Fat Lady with whom Harry had a brief row, ending in him threatening to tell Filch that she’d been sneaking off when she wasn’t needed to have tea with Lord Berwick who lived in a portrait down the West Corridor.
Three hours later, they found themselves under a tree by the water. Draco was studying for Arithmancy with Harry’s head in his lap. His eyes drooped lazily.
Eventually, I’ll die,” he’d said. “And you two will have children. And those children won’t want to live in whatever it is you’ll be able to afford.” Both of their cheeks had brightened at that. All in all, Roache seemed like the cool uncle who would let you smoke weed but only if you did it together and would always have your back when you did something stupid. Or maybe godfather would be more accurate...
the young wizard reassured himself, yet his nerves still jangled. Harry glanced over to the calendar on the wall.
Draco tried to run off to his room but the thought of the sad, miserable looking wizard scampering off to his sad, miserable room to sleep in the dark…Harry couldn’t bear it, so he let Draco run off to wash up for the night and turned back to the Gryffindors in front of him.
The next scene showed Draco in a velvet robe, looking thin and worn, five o’clock shadow peppering his bruised jaw.
They walked in silence, Harry's hand still in Draco's. It was just to help guide him, Harry told himself. Yet the young Malfoy made no effort to remove it, even after he'd snapped out of his dissociative trance.
The boy looked over his features and Draco quickly recognised that stupid look on his face as concern.
Both of them were dressed, Harry donning corduroys and a sportcoat he’d retrieved from the shopping bags. They walked out into the brisk evening air and were relieved to see that it wasn’t raining, and the weather service on Harry’s phone had told them there was no precipitation to be expected. They caught a cab, Finchley having gone home for the evening and left for the restaurant inside a hotel that Draco claimed had the best Osso Bucco he’d ever had. He was right. They were sat at a table near the middle of the restaurant, and Harry was halfway through the tender veal dish when he noticed it.
“I’m so sorry...I get it. I get it now. And I wasn’t there for you then. But I’m here for you now and I’m not leaving.”
"Expelliarmus!" He hissed, and the sword embedded itself in a nearby painting of Salazar Slytherin. The man's hand immediately went to his pocket where his wand lay, but Harry quickly levitated it under the bed. The janitor grimaced, and was sent flying out the window and into the Whomping Willow. Harry paused for a moment, and heard an awful lot of banging about, followed by screaming, followed by the rustle of branches. He nodded in contentment, then ran to Draco's side, who sat with his back against the wall, sweating.
Harry turned his head the minimum amount necessary to breathe. And to whinge at Draco. (They were both equally as important).
it to be for nothing...” he trailed off, and Roache looked dangerously curious. Suspicious. Concerned.
He gently settled down on top of the sheets next to his former nemesis, who stared blankly at the ceiling.
He pecked Draco’s damp cheek, wiped it with his sleeve and walked over to the cupboard in the kitchen. The place was surprisingly well-stocked. Harry suspected they had Finchley to thank for that-or perhaps the housekeeper. Probably the housekeeper. A packet of shortbread biscuits was in a cupboard near the pantry and he unloaded them onto a plate, which he brought to the coffee table. Draco was sliding another tape into the VCR player and stumbled back onto the sofa.
Harry pushed past the other students hurriedly, following the lean blonde figure through throngs of hungry professors and year sixes and sevens. It was lunch time, yet the boy was seen only once in the mess hall-and that was the first dinner of the year. The young Malfoy had been sulking about-well, to be fair they all had. They'd just saved the world, after all. It's a lot-especially combined with having to return to the battlefield and pretend everything’s like it once was. Pretend half of them hadn't died or been tortured. Harry blinked fuzz out of his eyes and kept running until he finally made it through the crowd. Draco was nowhere to be seen.
"Y'guys are...whisper r'lly loud," she muttered and accidentally whacked Ron in the face with her arm.
She passed him the basket of bread rolls and he took one out of necessity, dropping it heavily on his plate but not even looking at it after that.
Draco heaved a sigh, lifting the charm he'd used to hide the bandages from the morning's...activities. He could feel the small blade digging around with every breath.
Harry fell quiet again, watching the clouds beneath them. Draco ran a finger over his upper lip as if he were considering something.
“Sorry, sorry…” The owner of the hand muttered, and it had taken Draco far too long in his delirious state to realise that it was Harry. He was only a bit disappointed.
When the tea did come round, it was accompanied by a platter of red and gold iced biscuits and turned out to be neither apricot nor kenilworth.
The fjord glittered as it greedily ate up the snow that coated everyone’s shoulders like frozen dandruff.
More blood spilled over the floor and down his skin and Draco bit back a scream when hot water ran into his wounds. But the guilt persisted and so did he, digging deeper, fearless, throwing caution to the wind. He was having the time of his life, and it sickened him. A loud knocking sound threw him off balance, and he slipped on the stones, landing heavily.
Harry just stood in front of him, staring. A single, silvery tear slipped down his cheek. Draco’s response was immediate, and he cupped a hand to it, wiping the tear away.
Draco paid while Harry was desperately patting his pockets, and by the time he pulled out a pouch of galleons the food is paid for and the blonde was pulling his overcoat on. Harry noticed he didn’t tip-which he always does. He’s grateful for this as he drops a coin onto the tray with the bill and follows the troubled wizard out the door. The pair rounded the corner and Harry took his hand.
They’d been reading for a few hours and Draco had successfully conquered his urgent need to vomit up his porcine sins when Hermione and Ron walked in, their loud voices a harsh contrast to the peaceful crackling of the fire and the flutter of turning pages that the boys had grown accustomed to.
Narcissa emerged with her hair looking slightly dishevelled and bright red fingerprints on her neck. Her left cheek was pinkish.
He hit play on the clunky old remote and took the mug of tea from Draco’s lap and placed it on the table, shuffling over on the sofa to sit closer to him. He said nothing, but the upward-facing open palm said
Ultimately, however, Draco didn't care. He'd been standing behind a camera for the past three hours and was revelling in the chance to stretch his legs a little. And his back. And his fingers. It wasn't particularly unfamiliar to him, but filming wasn't his forte. Nor was it his preference, for that matter. He was looking forward to the following day when the proper shoot would be underway.
Hermione opened her mouth to reply but caught herself before she spoke. Like Ron, she had more than likely come to terms with Harry openly studying with Draco. Not quite frequently, but every so often in the common room at night after they'd been kicked out of the library, he found himself drifting to the table Draco set himself up at. They couldn't sit as they usually did, not in the company of their classmates and not with the temporary limitation Draco had set upon them, but there was comfort in proximity. Reassurance only added to by the bumping of knees, the murmured exchange in which Harry would pose a question or Draco would comment, to receive a like-minded muted reply.
Draco swallowed. Harry wouldn't have noticed it that either if he hadn't been sitting so close. Next to. On. "Yeah."
A groan. Harry's toes curling. A gasp. Another slap, and then the sharp succession of grunts and thrusts. Draco's hand had somehow found the curtain behind him, had gripped with white-knuckled tightness, but hardly noticed.
"Don't worry about it," Harry said. "I'm sure he's not that bad. Your teacher said you were a prefect or something, right?"
"I don't want him to wake up halfway through the night again," Lily said, scrubbing her face once more.
He barely made it through his front door. Barely into his dark, pristinely clean kitchen to stagger to the sink. His belly lurched, and with a strangled retch, Harry heaved down the drain, clutching the counter as each mouthful, each dribble of wine and soup and pain of the evening, was brought back up again. He'd drunk too much, he realised, had even known it at the time, and he kicked himself for it even as he knew it wasn't the real cause for his nausea.
"He's got stupid glasses, too," was all Draco had said in reply. He hadn't needed to expand further; to attempt to deny Pansy would have been pointless, anyway.
"I hate that you don't get a choice in what you do and who you work for, and don't –" Draco raised a finger as Harry opened his mouth to protest, "- try and tell me you choose. That choice is a load of bullshit and you know it."
Draco was silent for a moment, a heavy silence that didn't feel accusatory but weighted nonetheless. Harry heard him take a number of short inhalations, beginning to speak before stopping himself, before he finally managed. "Can I ask why?"
"That's the thing, though." Pansy's voice lowered, became suddenly insistent. "Things don't just crop up, Draco. Not for people like us."
Once more, she was ignored. "But you're not in shape for it, clearly. And you're completely raw. I've seen your interviews, you know. You've learnt what to say but you've no finesse in how you say it. Not to mention that you haven't the foggiest understanding of how to best present yourself."
"Okay. That's… okay." Draco exhaled heavily. The way the image of his face jostled, the angle moving, coming closer, said he'd picked his mirror up and was moving. "I don't know how long I'll be. I have to slip out without Mother or Father learning of my departure, because they're… well, they've been somewhat disconcerted since Sirius brought me home."
And he'd been just as obsessed with Draco as Draco had been with him. There was no denying that fact. So what had happened?
Harry felt good. Happy. And, given it was Wednesday, it was bound to be a good day. For certain reasons in particular, Wednesday had become his favourite day of the week.
"Bloody hell," Ron said, pausing with a chip in his hand and shaking his head. "And you're doing that all day?"
The woman tapped one finger rhythmically upon her desk. She regarded Harry with that same hawk-like stare that was different to Gertrude's but no less disconcerting. She pursed her lips slightly before replying. "It could work. It certainly could. But you've got to put in the hard yards, Mr. Potter. Just because you already possess fame doesn't mean that this industry will embrace you with open arms." Her finger gave a particularly forceful tap. "Just be aware of that. If you are – then yes, I believe we can work with this."
Harry was left behind, alone and stunned in the empty hallway. Slowly lowering his gaze to the key in his hand, he shook his head. The trip had certainly taken an unexpected bend, and it was far from over yet.
– was swept under the rug. "Just like the fact that everyone else looks the other way when you're beaten the shit out of isn't right?"
Draco was leaving for Switzerland in a week, and he shouldn't be wondering just how the fuck he was going to do it and leave Harry behind him.
Harry didn't know of that possibility. As he shivered in the corner of the room, eyes squeezed shut and hoping, praying, pleading with any god or magical deity there was, all he knew was that his magic didn't work. Thoughts weren't actions, and neither were they really magic. The world simply didn't work like that.
A man gazed towards a distant corner, the hint of a smile upon his lips, the muscles of his bare chest defined in the greyscale gradient of the picture.
Harry was. Not intentionally, but he was. He didn't go out but with his friends, and always draped in Concealment Charms. He Apparated where possible because he had to, and always had company in interviews and castings that he only rarely attended as he'd been required to before. Fame was dangerous, he'd found, and not only from malicious sources.
He left the pair of them waving dutifully, turning and hitching his backpack once more. He skipped down the stairs two at a time and was running before he reached the bottom floor. A brief glance towards the front of the school saw Ms. McGonagall's tall, straight-backed figure still standing before her horde of students, but Harry didn't spare long in staring. He took off for the school oval at a quickstep.
Not much like the Malfoy that Harry had met in Potions the previous week either, or in those since. Malfoy was strange when they were studying in one another's company; Harry didn't think there were the thick, thrumming undertones of hatred that there had once been, but at the same time, the quiet, reserved, almost sadly aloof Malfoy that seemed to have taken his place every other moment of the day took a momentary break, too. Just as strangely, Harry found it somehow relieving; if nothing else, that Malfoy still found himself capable of sharp retorts to Harry, if only to Harry, was reassurance that not everything in his world had changed.
It wasn't the first time they'd shared a bed. What had become a habit of sharing Draco's seat directly had evolved into sharing a mattress, sharing space, sharing the protective cocoon of the canopy curtains and their Silencing Charm that no one else in the dormitory seemed to make use of anymore. But this was different. Very different
A hiss of breath escaped Draco's lips. His jaw clenched so tightly that he could hear his teeth creak, and he abruptly decided he wanted to be anywhere but on the edge of a goddamn lake being assaulted by a gentle wind. Yet even the longing to escape wasn't entirely feverish and mindless; Draco wanted to be away, but he couldn't quite bring himself to flee from Harry.
He didn't need to be told twice. All but scrambling to his feet, Harry fled from the hall. His legs wavered, his steps stumbled, but he didn't slow. When he burst through the door, he didn't look back.
Mr. Hastings was a strange choice for a principal. He was clearly unnerved by the position and just as clearly disliked public speaking. Whenever he climbed up to their clumsy stage, his hands were always clasped together, rubbing and folding against one another as though kneading the nerves from his fingers. His eyes twitched, darting across the audience, and he fumbled his words more often than he successfully linked them together.
“Heart rate and blood pressure are normalising.” She suddenly grows quiet, her expression turning dark as she pulls the runes reading centre. She flicks her wand in a complicated pattern and the orb rotates three times before flashing a deep red colour. “Draco, do you know if you have been Cursed? There is this strange, residual Dark magic attached to your signature that I am unfamiliar with. If you see here, the Curse did not take completely.” Padma points to the hairline fractures within multiple areas of the red tendrils.
need to list names? Come on, Harry,” she trails off with an exasperated sigh. “It’s not good for you, sleeping around the way you are. I’m all for embracing one’s sexual autonomy, but I really don’t think that’s what this is.”
“A little taste of what’s coming to you if you tell anyone about our little talk, Malfoy. Not that they’ll believe you. A Death Eater filing a physical assault claim against a decorated Auror? They’ll throw you in a cell just for deigning to breathe in their presence,” Smith says, now running his hand through Draco’s hair almost lovingly. “And do me a favour, yeah? Stay the fuck away from Harry. I don’t need you in his ear, filling his head with pretty little lies about better days with
Draco hangs his head, Kreacher’s words soaking into him. “I’m sorry, Kreacher…please, don’t tell Potter…about what you’ve seen here. I’m sorry,” he says, lips quivering as he shrinks back into himself. “I just don’t want him to worry.” When Kreacher is just mere inches away from him, the elf conjures a soft handkerchief, lifting it in one wrinkled hand to gingerly mop away the tears on Draco’s cheeks.
“May I kiss you here?” Potter asks, his fingers lightly grazing his quickly pebbling nipples. He nods and soon is met with Potter’s head bent over his chest, his hot mouth first kissing his nipple before bringing his nipple into his mouth, gently suckling it. Draco throws his head back, a cry ripping high from his throat, a burst of sensation exploding across his body, his left hand finding refuge in Potter’s wild hair. He buries his face into the mass of hair, his mouth opening against the long strands in a groan, brows drawing together in his raw pleasure. Before Potter can move his mouth to Draco’s other nipple, Draco yanks his head back, capturing Potter’s mouth in a searing kiss before quickly pulling back.
“Then you have to believe me when I say that releasing the dossier to the media and to the public is the best thing to do. We get the public on our side, so when we start our investigations, all the reasons for doing so are out in the open. There will be no way for the Flints or their co-conspirators to shield themselves from arrest. Then, we begin to pick apart the people within the Wizengamot who are involved, and question the families we know are holding onto illegal, Dark objects from the evidence you cleverly provided. I won’t let them send you to Azkaban over the burglaries.”
He had come back to his Fitzrovia flat, broken a few porcelain plates, screamed, woken both Pansy and Blaise from the commotion, and cried himself sick in their embraces. Even half his emergency pack of cigarettes and a spliff with the paper sealed with a few drops of Draught of Peace, couldn’t numb the devastation he felt. It annihilated the flutters that had taken up residency in his stomach, leaving behind a cruel, cold emptiness. His hands shook, his throat contracted as he spoke, a painful ball of anguish lodged there. Draco didn’t tell them about his and Harry’s trust issues — he didn’t want Pansy to find some clever way to kill Harry — but he instead shared the terrible fight about Harry’s job, and Harry's inability to share that part of his life with Draco. As night crept to morning, they all decided to skip work. Pansy and Blaise watched Draco the entire day as if he were about to perish, and it felt as if he would. When night came again, Draco worried that, if he closed his eyes to sleep, something would give out in his brain, and he’d never wake up again. When he voiced this concern, Blaise and Pansy agreed to sleep beside him to ensure he made it through the night.
“Never mind that, I’ve got someone!” shouts the Auror holding Draco’s arm, an older man with a long brown scraggly beard. Draco doesn’t know him but has seen him around before.
The creature chuckles humorlessly before a helpless sob escapes its lips, pale hands curling into fists. “Fucking
Draco can feel his lips moving, but his throat doesn’t work. He’s just so tired, and he wants to tell Harry, so desperately, that he’s sorry. He just needs to fall asleep, just for a short while.
is perfect,” Harry says excitedly, pressing several buttons on the machine before it blares to life, the TV behind it also clicking to life. Harry picks up the little microphone as he selects a song and smiles mischievously at Draco before taking a deep breath—
Harry's breathing becomes deep and trembling as he struggles to draw in a full breath. He begins to shake.
“He’s right,” Angelina started, a grave look on her face. “After all these years I’ve finally embraced that I’m as mad as a hatter, just like my dear old husband.” George jostled her.
Draco shakes his head in disbelief. “For fuck’s sake,” he says, staring at Potter with clear disgust on his face. “Maybe you should join the children too, Potter, you’re obviously behind in your social development skills, bloody philistine.” He smirks as their friends laugh.
He smiles down at her. “It’s okay. It’s your wedding day— you can cry if you want to,” he says, kissing her wet cheek once more.
“Yes. Why wouldn’t I be?” Draco drawls, masking his fear, carefully turning to face Mia even as her expression remains uncertain. Draco knows that she’s not familiar with all of his behaviour yet, and, as result, doesn’t know that Draco is actually screaming on the inside. He’s still very good at keeping an impassive face.
Once they drag the tree into the front lounge, with a flick of his wand the wireless turns on, crooning a rendition of
He washes his shaking hands again, splashing some water on his face and staring at his reflection in the mirror. His hair is a mess, his face is flushed, but, worst of all, he looks a hair's breadth from breaking down into tears. He tries to concentrate on what to do next, but there are a million thoughts racing through his mind, one more worrying than the next. Draco closes his eyes and covers his ears with his hands, even though it’s not his surroundings but the words, the fears, the sounds in his head causing him to tremble and have heart palpitations that feel like his heart is slamming against his ribcage.
Being around Draco feels a bit like flying, he thinks. All harsh wind whipping through his hair, pulling his face almost painfully taut while his heart races with both fear and exhilaration as he speeds through a cloudless blue sky.
“Let me die,” Draco whispers, his gaze unblinking and unseeing. Harry knows then that the creature has taken over completely.
Draco immediately stands to his feet, chocolate frog packaging and magazine falling to the ground. He doesn’t even have the mind to ask Blaise, for the millionth time, what exactly his job is at the Ministry. “Where is he now?”
Draco wants to laugh, but he can’t conjure the strength to do so. Pansy appears beside Blaise, a cold towel in hand and pressing against Draco’s chest, his throat, his forehead. Draco sighs as beads of water slip across his neck and chest. It feels good.
“Then, it seemed like life just moved on, like nothing happened. Purebloods forgot that they committed atrocious acts mere months ago. Instead, they began to host parties and preach about tolerance in public, while continuing to whip their house-elves and throw around the M word. And then they expect us, their children, to accept these jaded white lies of change, of a new-normal. As the social elite, we have to accept that we're just stumbling through our charmed little existence in a society that offers us worldly comforts with no consequences at all. We’re born into this kind of utopian world as little monsters, shielded from real life, and then we go on to breed other little monsters who will also have this same charmed, ignorance-is-bliss life. No one in our community prepares us for the immense loneliness, the fear of isolation, or the pressure to be perfect. No one prepares you to face your demons in the real world, if you ever do venture out into it, because they simply never had to do it themselves. Nothing ever changes.
Draco bites Harry’s lip, hard, his teeth breaking the delicate skin at Harry’s resounding gasp as Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s neck, his hands cradling the back of Harry’s head, fingers sprawled in his hair. The thought that he can touch Harry so intimately is thrilling.
“He prides himself on being an open book now, but his heart is still very much guarded. And over the years, it’s clear that he’s allowed you to chip away at that surrounding wall.”
“Okay! Here’s to the best night ever?” Blaise says with a cheeky grin. Pansy makes a gagging sound and Draco can’t help but briefly cover his face with his hand, mostly embarrassed on Blaise’s behalf.
“Okay.” Draco inclines forwards, ready to press his lips against Potter’s, but falters. He closes his eyes in shame. The heat from before extinguishes in the pit of his belly like water on embers. After a few moments, Potter shifts under him and their gazes meet. Potter gives him a small, reassuring smile.
There’s a collective gasp going off around them and Draco hears a glass crash to the floor. He watches with growing horror as Bitty’s lips tug into a wide, pleased smile, her dark eyes glinting maliciously as Gibbons holds Draco’s hands behind his back and another searches his pockets for his wand. His voice is stuck in his throat and for a wild moment Draco wonders if the Aurors have also Silenced him.
Draco laughs, his cheeks hurting. He touches them with the cool tips of his fingers before rolling over onto his stomach. Pansy raises an eyebrow at him as he stomach-crawls towards her fluffy pillows, throwing himself against them with an exaggerated sigh of pleasure. Pansy turns towards him, brushing his hair back from his eyes before tucking her hand under her chin as she smiles at him.
None of the comments penetrate his skin. Most of what they’re saying he already thinks about himself already.
Harry comes closer, leaning forward. “Lie on the bed,” Harry says, his voice breathy against Draco’s ear. “I want to see all of you.”
, his heart is beating so fast as his eyes fall on Dean’s lips. Suddenly, he’s terrified. He’s never looked at another man’s lips like this before. He doesn’t quite know what to do next. Hell, he doesn’t know if this is even okay, looking, and acknowledging the stirrings of lust from looking…but he makes eye contact with Dean again and they both smile coyly at one another. The bass of the music from the dance floor pounds through the walls of the loo and he can faintly hear the lyrics...
Draco runs his tongue over his teeth as he tilts his head to the side to stare at Potter, anger bubbling up to the surface. He holds it in. He’s an adult now, after all. He closes the small space between them and leans in close enough that he knows Potter will hear him clearly without having to raise his voice. “I don’t know if you’re just bitter because she left you or what, Potter, but Blaise is not
him, but who knows. Draco nods slowly, schooling his features to mask exactly how dumbfounded he is.
,” Draco hisses, knocking her wand hand away, adrenaline bleeding into irritation. He feels prickly and cold and overwhelmed, his carefully controlled anger ready to burst free from the darkest corner of his troubled mind.
“It was bound to happen,” Draco says. “I did mention the benefits of using your familial invention to you a million times while we were mar
“I think the issue runs deeper than Teddy wanting to frolic around school in his posh play-clothes.”
“She stared at you spasming for a while before gathering her cloak and bag to leave without a second glance.”
“It wasn’t a fucking mistake!” Bitty bites back, sounding petulant. Her nostrils flare. “It was perfect! It was beautiful!”
“I’m surprised you’re not off at the Ministry tonight, Potter,” Theo says, sipping from a pony-necked bottle of cider.
it, Draco lets go, blushing. “It seems like you don’t need me any further—” Draco says, making to stand, but Potter tugs him back down and entwines their fingers. “
“What’s wrong with right now, Malfoy? It’s a bloody perfect time to talk about it, I want them to see this,” he says, his voice trembling with anger. He goes over to one of the open boxes by the bookshelf and pulls out a hot pink book, holding it up. “I just want them to see the reality of what this leads to. You both are so happy, everybody’s so content and before you know it, you’re screaming at each other over who owns—” he peers down at the cover of the book, “—
“Do you know what kind of fucking hell I’ve been living in? I’ve been struggling with my feelings for you for over a year. But I told myself that I’d be condemning myself to heartbreak all over again because you’re so
Eight years ago, fresh from the War and all its chaos, Draco had spent an entire year reading every single book he could find on Muggle science such as biology, chemistry, physics, all their mathematics and computer science. He'd absorbed everything like a sponge. He'd begged McGonagall and his Probation Officer to help him gather proper documentation and recommendation letters, and before he knew it, he was taking practice tests for A-Levels before passing them with flying colours. This allowed him to apply to Oxford’s undergraduate program with a focus in Biomedical Sciences. After that, he took the MCAT, desperate to leave the U.K., and applied to Harvard’s Medical School, taking an international portkey to Boston with just a rucksack of clothes and books in his possession. While fast-tracking his M.D., Draco gained a lot of attention from his colleagues at Mass General. During his clinical rotations, due to his vast pharmacological knowledge, he was often first to make treatment recommendations and answer questions on the pharmacokinetics or dynamics of a given regimen, proving himself an impressive student to many clinicians and professors alike. Draco was involved in a number of research projects with several of these same professors, invited to work within their clinical research units, particularly in the divisions related to neurological impairment and neuron pathology. After his graduation and with several letters of recommendation in his back pocket, Draco returned to England to find the intersection between his Muggle training in medicine and the Wizarding parallel, Healing.
Draco’s hand darts out. He snatches his missing Louboutin tassel out of the air. The one he had blamed Sprinkles of destroying.
Then Ginevra broke up with Harry, causing a media frenzy when shortly after, she began to publicly date Luna Lovegood. This, too, came as a relief to Draco, as selfish as it is.
“Am I okay?” he echoes. He knows the question was meant to be a harmless enquiry into his well-being. It’s meant to be said in a soothing way, but the question burns Draco like Firewhisky burns the inside of his throat. “I don’t know,” he says, tears welling up in his eyes before he releases a sob.
Draco becomes rigid in Theo’s armchair. There’s a flopping sensation in the pit of his stomach as he stares out into the bored, unbothered eyes of his friends. Pansy continues to lounge on the chaise, breaking her gaze from his to fix instead on the ceiling. Theo eases his way onto the floor in front of his infamous round, glass coffee table, sectioning off long thin lines of cocaine as Millie moves to rest her head in his lap.
Harry’s mind whirrs. The mums of Little Angels Daycare are only half a strawberry daiquiri into this soiree and the bizarrely inappropriate conversations are already starting.
to, young man!” Draco says, now stepping fully into the room to stand beside Harry, his arms crossed against his chest.
Hannah smiled softly up at him, her eyes overbright. The respectable canary yellow diamond flashing in the soft lighting.
Draco sneers. “Not until you tell me what’s going on. A little birdie in the Patrol Department claims that Potter’s body was identified by you. I find that a bit strange considering dear old Aunt Andromeda is Potter’s Emergency contact.”
“Yeah!” Harry says, excited. “Let me know when and where and I’ll show up.” He’s always wanted to learn how to drive. Vernon used to say it was a staple of manhood to Dudley, but Harry went off to Hogwarts, and didn’t think twice of the muggle skill outside of his experience with the Weasley’s flying Ford Anglia. He lifts the can of
Harry growls, fingers digging into the material of Draco’s jeans. Heat flares through Draco at the possessiveness, the heavy press of Harry’s fingers. Draco’s lips parting as a feral whip of Harry’s magic charges the air around them.
To top off the horrific decor, there are at least two or three child-aged orphans being paraded around, enticing those who were on the wrong side of the war to dig deep into their coin purses, and not for the good of their heart but for a mention in next week’s issue of
“No, no,” Draco forces out a chuckle. “Not at all, Mrs Pumpernickel, thank you!” Draco calls back, hoping this will deter her.
The look Draco sees there is all he needs to put aside every single reason why he shouldn’t accept his feelings for this man.
“Draco!” someone calls out. He turns towards Luna Lovegood, tanned and happy and dressed in a bizarre, bright yellow tiered fringe dress, waving him over. With a quick glance at Harry, Draco makes his way over to her. She throws her arms around him in a tight hug.
“So I can either walk you home or get you a taxi. I’d say we’ve both had a bit too much to Apparate.”
in love with Draco and doesn’t know what to do. It’s like he’s never seen him smile so beautifully before. There’s nothing for it, he knows right now standing in front of this busy tube station with the flowers and coffee man fighting for the attention of pedestrians, and the old bearded bloke sat on the corner playing the accordion, and Draco standing before him with that smile, he just bloody
Harry sits down on the edge of James’s bed, his legs suddenly feeling full of lead. It’s then that he notices Scorpius’s oversized plush pygmy puff resting against James’s pillows. Something he can’t name washes over him but he quickly shoves the feeling down.
someone’s Dean? You definitely became mine when you kissed me on the forehead and practically ran from my home after fucking me,” Draco says tearfully. Harry gasps. He wants so badly to touch Draco, to hold him, and tell him he’s sorry.
“No. I mean, I was going to have to come back for breakfast anyways, right? Ginny gets back from her vacation tonight. She, Weasley and Hermione are joining us for breakfast, remember?”
why did he not fight back? When the silence uncomfortably stretches between them he sighs and curls in on himself, shame once again roaring in his chest like Fiendfyre as he drops a tea infuser into each mug. Draco had been met with much more direct, accusing questions from the Aurors –
“Yes, Hannah Abbott. You know, that busty blonde with the charming gap tooth from our year,” Draco says lazily, a stretch starting from his neck down to the tips of his toes. He sighs contentedly when Pansy’s brows knit together as she tries to recall Abbott.
He freezes as Draco’s words from the row, all those months ago in front of Ginny and Pansy’s flat, come crashing into him like a sledgehammer.
He’s suddenly overcome with memories of his first time. Dean on his knees as Harry’s throbbing cock hit the back of his throat. Dean’s fingers slowly opening him up for what felt like hours, then pinned beneath Dean as he’s ruthlessly fucked into his mattress. Good on his word, Dean had him screaming so loud someone surely would have called the police for the murder happening next door, had Grimmauld Place not been warded against his muggle neighbours’ eyes and ears.
Derrick Watson, age 39, was the former Head of the British and Irish Quidditch League Division after Bagman’s disappearance. The position is now held by Marcus Flint.
“Good grief, Potter, what are you still doing in my house?” Malfoy asks in a raspy voice, sounding genuinely surprised.
Draco sighs. He’s bloody tired of having to perform for an audience. It’s been a marathon adhering to socially-acceptable behaviours in post-war Wizarding Britain. Sometimes he wants to start a riot, burn some buildings down, and scream out a fierce Fuck You to the Pureblood establishment.
“I see something,” Draco says, carefully slipping his hand into the space to pull out a stack of paper.
“Well, it would be pretty damn brilliant if you could. Something’s gotta give, otherwise what was all this for?” Draco responds, shifting into a more comfortable position against the wall.
Draco rolls onto his side. His eyes feel puffy as his gaze catches on the wilting Swiss cheese plant he’d set on the nightstand last week before landing on the blaring juggernaut of an alarm clock. He slams his hand on the snooze button. The red light taunts him as the block numbers read: 7:00am.
of the jeans had pockets). Draco had gone a little crazy in the Girls section at Selfridges. Harry just didn’t understand why a five-year-old needed a £300
Draco has to control his breathing and thoughts at Potter’s little admission. It does something funny to his insides.
Draco opened his invitation to the Davis Family’s second charity gala quite late. He had been avoiding his owl post for over two weeks, annoyed with the influx of ridiculous events Pureblood families were hosting— from fancy dress masquerades for eligible parties to book club meetups for singles. Draco doesn’t need the constant reminder that he’s alone and will probably die that way.
But you? You were able to go to law school! Your mother was able to snag Dany fucking Zabini! Well, guess what, Draco? We’re now just as glamorous as you, even more so. And if my bitch wife dies in the hospital my associates practically
Potter perches on a thick wooden chair before the kitchen table. It’s been two weeks since he moved in. Draco still sleeps a lot, rarely changes out of his pyjamas, and before Potter feeds him for the day, will nibble on plain cream crackers and sip on tea. But today Potter forces him to get out of bed and has asked Kreacher to leave out chicken salad and thickly sliced seven-seeded wholemeal bread.
“You could wear my mother’s, it might fit you better than mine” he joked, and Harry tilted his head at the frilly purple coat.
"You know you’re hideous either way," he muttered. Harry barely heard it. But he still did, and winced.
The brunette fumbled for his glasses and shoved them onto his face, cracked his back and hopped onto bony feet.
could be heard from hidden speakers. The seatbelt icon lit red and Draco removed his hastily. He hated feeling trapped.
Except that Harry interrupted it after an extended pause. He hummed an approving sound before speaking. "I like it."
"Yeah, well," with an awkward chuckle, Ron's smooth-talking sincerity abruptly retreated. "No problem. Hope that helps you out a bit."
When Dot finally released Pansy from her claws, Pansy crossed the room. A hint of something that wasn't quite a smirk niggled at the corners of her lips as she settled herself. "Well," she said with a sigh, adjusting her seat and plucking a notepad from thin air. A pen – not a quill but a pen – appeared a moment later. "Now that our babysitter has finished bulldozing me, shall we start?"
Harry, sitting cross-legged with his back against the raised edge of the fountain, nodded heavily. "Yes."
The tail end of dinner was still spread across the table, crumbs dotting the tablecloth and dregs of red wine swirling in the base of haphazardly spaced glasses. Sirius was at one side, twisted in his seat with PJ's head predictably in his lap. Remus sat at Sirius' side, as quietly composed as ever with his elbows propped on the edge of the table and head tilted slightly as if in consideration. His small smile widened slightly as Harry glanced towards him, a knowing twinkle that reminded Harry of Jill briefly brightening his amber eyes, before James was shuffling behind Harry and shunting him towards one of the spare chairs.
a small part of Harry thought, though the larger part was as stupefied as Jackie was in her blank-faced appreciation of Pansy in tights.
But he hadn't. And now he'd missed his sodding bus. Huffing, Harry glanced over his shoulder at the route back home, pursed his lips, and considered momentarily using his mobile phone to call James. It was at least part of the reason he had it at all when most kids at his school barely knew how to use one. A very small part, admittedly, because Lily's intense overprotectiveness had done most of the work in deciding it was a necessity.
"Alright, then," he muttered. "Goodnight." Then he turned, hand slipping to his wand in his pocket, and Apparated away.
Walking in between Jackie and Jill, he headed towards where Abel had already taken up residence in the back corner of the scattering of chairs. Or he tried to head there; enthusiasm and excitement didn't entirely distract his classmates from their usual antics.
They did sit, however, whether due to Jackie's provocation or because the rest of the hall was rapidly dividing into their own partnered groups and they were the only two still standing. As groups hunkered down into surprisingly upbeat chatter, Pansy perched like a bird on the edge of her seat while Draco slumped backwards with the languid grace of a snotty princeling on his throne.
"But more than that, I'm excellent at my job." Pansy arched her eyebrows pointedly. "Aren't I, dear?"
Of all the people in the world, Harry wasn't someone that Draco would have ever considered to be a model. Not even close. It wasn't because of how he looked, but how he held himself. How he walked. His confidence in all the wrong areas, his disregard for frivolities and even greater disregard for actually looking presentable.
"I'd bloody well hope you did, seeing as you were the one who suggested the book to me in the first place."
Draco was leaning over a single print, frowning as he so often did when regarding his work, and for a moment didn't seem to realise Harry approached him. When Harry paused alongside him, however, dropping his hand lightly onto the table, Draco glanced upwards, frown clearing into blankness.
"What is it, sweetie?" The pony-tail woman shared a glance with the portraits on her adjacent walls. "Is it gazing from afar? A long-distance love?"
"The magician?" Draco asked, clarifying as he had every time since Harry had first mentioned his comrade-in-arms at the local party supplies store. As always, he sounded derisively dubious.
"Wow, has it really been so long?" Hermione had said, shaking her head as she stared at him over the restaurant table, fork forgotten in her hand. "Wasn't Malfoy under house arrest in France for two years?"
There weren't many people idling along the road outside their hotel, even if the road was already thickening with traffic. However, when Jackie, leading the way towards the car with striding steps, turned and called towards them, he couldn't help but flinch.
Her face hurt, whatever had happened to it. She was exhausted, nauseous, still on the brink of keeling sideways. Everything part of Lily felt pained, and her aching chest most of all. But none of that mattered. Not at that moment, because Harry was alright. That meant everything else was, too.
Jackie turned back towards Pansy. "You sure you don't have to go off with your teacher? You won't get busted if we steal you for a while?"
Then she turned on her heel and strode off to an empty corner of the hall, snatching up and dragging a pair of chairs behind her as she went. Where she positioned herself with deliberate isolation was so typical of her; Harry wasn't surprised in the least.
Harry glanced over his shoulder. When he did, it was to find Draco eyes even wider than before, his mouth flopping open in a show he would never have otherwise permitted of himself. Never, unless truly stunned. He stared at Harry as though he'd never seen him before.
Harry glanced up at Hermione again, blinked detachedly as he met her gaze and rifled for what she'd asked of him, and shook his head slightly. "I'm fine."
Draco's mouth opened and closed a number of times before he caught himself and forcibly pressed his lips together. He nodded, but Harry didn't think he was convinced. Whatever nonsensical reasoning had played out in his head, had instilled such a thought in there, wasn't so easily erased. Maybe with time and a little bit of work, just as with Harry's insecurities and discomforts, he would overcome it, but…
Draco wanted to wake up in a bed and roll over to see a familiar face beside him, not just flushed with lust but with affection. He wanted that, and that want had only become more profound in a very short time.
"No, not briefly. I'm not saying that more travel in the future isn't on the table, because I'd love it to be, but sticking around for a while seems like the best option."
Jill left with a wave, Abel on her heels, and with a nudge, Jackie urged Harry into motion. Dragging a pair of chairs after him, they tucked their seats in the corner.
"Alright, then. How about that time I went down to that vineyard in Italy and saw evidence of Zabini?"
Harry snorted. "You were dead to the world, is what you were. Although, I'm surprised you managed to sleep at all, what with, you know." He gestured down to himself, to Draco and where Harry still sat on top of him. There wasn't all that much between them in size difference; it must have been uncomfortable –
"Ipetsky," Draco said, all by spitting the word out. "And anyone else that you – that you've been with. Or the people who look at you like that – like you're a goddamn piece of meat that they can just have." His voice was strained, a reflection of the tightening of his face. "I don't want to be like that. I just want you. All of you. And I want you to want me, too."
Harry was smiling as he raced towards his bus stop, and it had nothing to do with the mild chill of the morning. Nothing at all.
White walls and dark floors. A predominance of crystalline glass. A glorious image of a young woman in blacks and whites taking up the majority of the wall-space between the two doors. Throughout the room, that style of minimalism, of refinement, extended without the rigid lines that such designs might otherwise entail. A pair of seats alongside the glass window-wall, positioned just so and with a low-lying table between, a stretch of space along either side of the seating that was empty of adornment or furnishings and only seemed to enhance the beauty of the room rather than make it appear dauntingly sparse. Even the receptionist's desk embodied Clementine's unique style.
headquarters was tall. And big. A tall, big building, with a modern façade more window than wall, and a grand entrance of double revolving doors at the top of wide, white steps. Even to the casual passer-by it would have stood out. It breathed grandeur and expense more profoundly than a fistful of galleons. Harry had always found it a little too extravagant, really.
"I don't care," he said. Then again, just for emphasis, "I really don't. I just want to be with you."
Gertrude waited a beat. Both elbow's propped upon the arms of her chair, she delicately steepled her fingers. "I've realised that you're a little lost, aren't you, Harry?"
Draco didn't quite chuckle, but the sound he uttered, barely more than a huffed sigh, was very like it. "You really are worried about me. Who would have ever thought that was possible?"
She would just peek. Just to be sure. Only a glimpse, and not to step inside, because he was certainly a Wizarding baby and seemed to have a knack for sensing when she was nearby –
Breathing a silent sigh of relief as Blaise began an elaborate discussion of what he surely knew precious little about, Harry briefly closed his eyes and turned to the elderly man behind the counter. He handed over a thin wad of notes – better to cover the costs of everyone's order than risk another slip – before taking a step back to Draco's side.
"Abel?" Ron asked, glancing towards where Abel all but huddled behind Jill. He retreated further with Jackie's gesture.
"Meaning," Harry drew his gaze briefly sidelong in the direction he knew Blaise Zabini's bed lay, "I'm thinking about our friends. And about them not knowing."
Harry, the lunch he'd acquired through use of Draco as a mouthpiece all but forgotten on the table before him, dragged his gaze from where he'd been caught staring. It was a little hard not to look again and again; he'd never seen anything quite like the sweeping line of the cliffs, the fuzzed edge of the lake, the picturesque interruption of the smooth lake-surface by what looked to be a motorboat for the line of white-caps left in the water behind it. It was difficult to be sure, though; at such a distance, it could have just as likely been a freshwater creature of sorts. Harry had barely stepped out of England before, and the only for work and in his younger years of Hogwarts attendance. He'd never really had the chance to appreciate such sights in person.
"Yeah, on a broom. Or before the press, when I don't know what direction the camera flashes are coming from. This is different."
His uncles Sirius and Remus had declared he was a master illusionist when he'd played hide and seek with them because he apparently had a knack for hiding himself in impossible places. His neighbour had nearly called an ambulance one evening when she was babysitting him when he'd 'swallowed' his dinner knife. For each of Harry's friends – with Jackie when they still only kids, and then with Jill – Harry had performed a little trick, a sleight of hand, that had inevitably been the bridge into real friendship as they'd demanded in their own ways to know how he'd done it.
Dodging around the scurrying workers, most in soaring high-heels or dress shoes buffed to a shine, Draco made his way towards the elevator. He packed himself in the back corner, arms folded against the press of harried workers with their own arms laden beneath stacks of folders and papers, and forced his way out as soon as the doors opened upon the seventeenth floor.
Draco turned towards him, mouth opening to reply, but any words he might have uttered were overridden by the newsstand attendant overrode his with an unnecessarily loud exclamation. "Hey! Hey, you – aren't you Harry Potter?"
Harry grinned, shrugged, and opened the door, stepping aside to allow Draco to pass before him. "From experience, Dot, Von can make a dress out of a potato sack. I think we'll be fine."
Jackie grumbled something likely snide beneath her breath as Hermione and Ron turned towards him with open curiosity and fascination respectively. "Really?" Hermione asked.
"It can't be very healthy," Hermione said, frowning. "Surely you wouldn't get all of your nutrition from such a limited diet. Harry, have you considered –?"
He broke himself off, exhaling harshly. Lily didn't speak but instead folded herself over Harry once more, arms around his neck as they'd been almost the entire time since he'd woken. The closeness, having the constancy of her touch, was more appreciated that Harry had ever thought it could be.
"It's lovely to see, dear," she said on those occasions. "It was always so upsetting to see you become so angry when you were younger."
But it didn't start again. It was over. Over, and leaving destruction in its wake and those stumbling out the other side picking through the splintered remains of what that storm had broken shattered.
There was a pause as Harry glanced at each of them in turn. Hermione frowned slightly, and the two girls exchanged side-eyes. He hoped they understood, hoped they interpreted his warning for what it was rather than any particular relevance to magically-conjured phones. Draco had told him about the Statute of Secrecy in the Wizarding world; was it really so hard to keep an eye out to make sure it wasn't overstepped?
It was apparent that he didn't intend to expand upon the statement further, and Hermione clearly saw it too. She simply nodded, smiled slightly, and turned towards Ginny to dive into an alternate discussion. Harry couldn't quite help but shoot Draco a sidelong glance with a slightly exasperated huff of laughter. He found Draco glancing at him in return and, surprisingly, just the hint of a smile twitched at the corner of his lips.
Pansy hummed affirmation. "A number of times, and again only quite recently, so I'm still fresh in his mind. He's a casting director by trade, a photographer when he has the time."
"I'll be keeping you guys company for the next few weeks twenty-four seven anyway, just in case," Sirius had added, because of course he would.
And that was the thing. Draco had seen it. He'd seen what Pansy saw, what apparently no one else had, what no one else realised. Not even Harry's friends when Ipetsky had been calling, and calling, and calling, and Harry hadn't picked up. How could Draco not go? How could he not?
Harry stared at him. Real magic? What was he going on about? Harry slowly shook his head. "No. Though focusing on the history of magic for our presentation might be our topic, I figured it might be cool to add a bit of the practical stuff, you know? For a bit of, um… flair." With a flourish of his hand and a twist of his wrist, Harry flipped a fake rose into his hand. "Like this."
Draco twisted in his seat, the chair scraping as he turned, and, lost in Draco's mouth and the kiss of his breath across his lips, Harry barely noticed until Draco tugged him down towards himself. Harry's body reacted instinctively, moved to straddle Draco just as his arms draped over his shoulders, and pressed a little more closely to him until they sat chest to chest.
Harry had sighed, folded, and accepted her orders as were duly presented. He did remember, and though it was all a little ridiculous, almost embarrassing, precautions were set in place for safety reasons. He didn't want a near abduction incident again; the most recent attempt had been messy, and not only because the Muggle police got involved.
Why the hell are we still talking about birds? Harry wondered, though he only smiled at Draco. "Yeah, maybe a good idea."
"Which is pretty obvious too. Still, I think I could help manage to scratch at the surface of our issue a little bit."
"If you truly believe that, then you do me a disservice," Pansy said with a sniff that didn't appear all that dissatisfied. She seemed like a cat who'd gotten the cream for her own emanating satisfaction. "I have connections."
Instinctive… and a want. Harry wanted it. Whether for the comfort of touch, touching in a way that didn't feel quite the same with anyone else, or for another reason entirely, Harry wanted things to go back to the way they'd been. It wouldn't happen, couldn't, but then – paradoxically – Harry knew he didn't want that to happen at all. Because it would never be quite the same anyway.
The seriousness of Draco's expression dissolved as he raised an eyebrow and pinned Harry with a hooded stare. "Oh, you wouldn't? So I'm the unexpected one?"
And maybe he was regretting not getting a wand of his own when he'd had the chance. Maybe just a little bit.
Ron pulled a face, but he was grinning himself a heartbeat later. They fell into a momentary comfortable silence, Ron rocking back on his chair and Harry staring out the window once more, sliding hesitantly back into his thoughts with far more ease than he'd managed when Ron had first sat beside him. Only to be drawn out again when Ron tapped Harry's foot in return.
Stumbling backwards, slamming into the wall, Harry's hand didn't make it to his mouth fast enough to stifle the strangled sound that slipped forth. He scrambled away, but it didn't feel fast enough because within the folds of that blanket he'd seen the baby. Or not a baby, because it couldn't be. A twisted, misshapen figure, twiglike limbs hanging from the folds of the blanket, an engorged head dimpled and pockmarked like the surface of the moon, a skull-like face the size of an adult's peering back at him with deadened eyes.
As if they would care. As if the graduating classes of either school would truly have any investment in the 'growth' of the schools they would leave behind them. Jackie had a thing or two to grumble about that as well.
Draco fell silent at Harry's words. He let them remain so for a moment before, somehow, he answered the request that Harry didn't even know he wanted to ask. "I'll come and get you. Can you meet me outside?"
"I'm not a misogynist," Ron said, swinging his wide-eyed attention towards her. His face seemed even paler than usual in the darkness of the club, offset by the scattering strobe lights seeping from the dance floor. "I'm just saying, surely even you'd prefer –"
Harry didn't know where he was and that scared him, but he was used to being scared now. His vision was darkening, and that was worrying too, but only scary. Nothing more. When he blinked one final time and his eyes stayed closed, that was the scariest of all, because sight of the ground disappeared, his knees gave way, and he slumped to the dirt floor in an exhausted heap. Only his hands, arms trembling as they held him up, stopped him from keeling face first into the ground.
"Now, don't get the wrong impression," Jackie said, pausing in nibbling her apple core. "Harry's not a spoilt rich kid who gets every new gadget on the market."
"I don't really know how it's supposed to sound. It's the only schooling experience I've ever had, after all."
But he couldn't. Or not yet, anyway. Not while the interviews were being released, and rage and hatred was thick. Harry had attempted in those interviews to paint them in the better light that they deserved, but it was the decision of the world whether or not they'd take the direction he offered them. He couldn't force it upon them.
With a sigh, Draco tipped his head back against the window frame behind him. Harry saw only from his periphery – the slight motion, the heavy blink of hooded eyes. "You know," Draco said slowly. It could have been almost conversational had it not been for that persisting rawness. "I didn't expect to feel this way. That it would hurt. Or that I wouldn't be able to move on. No one ever tells you about that part. Not my parents, even though they were in the first war. Not the Death Eaters – fuck, definitely not them. What we… what
Harry watched, and he pondered. Clubbing wasn't necessarily his scene, but he didn't particularly mind it. He didn't think he'd ever be the type of person that would spend night after night getting lost in the throes of madness and drink, even if he didn't have his work to consider. When Harry's friends said he'd mellowed out, he supposed that meant as a party-goer too, though he didn't think he'd ever been much of one to begin with.
Harry didn't know. Magic, as he was growing to realise, wasn't logical. Even so, he'd be damned if he wouldn't try to force some sense onto it. His throat was parched, his tongue heavy in his mouth, and he didn't know for sure but that he was no longer shivering despite still feeling the cold probably wasn't a good thing.
“I figured we didn’t need too much space, so…” Draco muttered, tossing his jacket haphazardly over the back of the desk chair. Harry peeked his head inside the bathroom.
, but Harry continued as professionally as possible and made quick work of healing the wounds and wiping orangey brown stains from the now scarred skin with a damp towel.
They all sat on Ron's bed and drank the foggleberry wine he smuggled from the teachers' cellar out of heavy goblets, while Harry played music from his phone.
He shrugged casually, and magicked his robe onto his shoulders, offering Harry a hand in the middle of the room. He took it and refused to let go.
The soap was hosed gently off his skin and his vocal cords were scratchy and painful when he spoke. Which was precisely why he hadn’t planned on speaking at all.
“Yeah, well, your boyfriend’s picky. So I got us in for dinner, but we can go somewhere else for lunch. Unless you don’t want to go outside. I don’t want to go outside, to be frank, but-“
Harry caught him by the sleeve and dragged him onto the bed, and they had a quick romp in the sheets before Draco’s OCD got the better of him.
"Merlin, how long has this been here?" He asked, prodding the wound which elicited a sharp gasp from Draco.
He cried for an hour straight that night, and when they woke up to the busy sounds of London traffic and grey light in the rain drop-studded windows, his shirt was still wet and salty.
Draco rifled through his drawers and tied a few socks together, then wrapped them tightly around his waist. He climbed into a pair of joggers and a long sleeved shirt, throwing a big wool sweater over it for good measure. Harry eyed him a little suspiciously once he emerged, but walked back to the red and gold common room without complaint. The fat lady in the painting glowered at Draco. The minute he crossed the threshold, he felt...wrong. It was hard to explain, but hairs stood up on his neck and rubbed uncomfortably against the fabric of his henley. The place smelled like food, like people, like...humanity, but not in the weird way. It smelled orange. Stepping into the Slytherin building smelled of nothing but drywall and a hint of bitter licorice. This place, though…he wasn’t sure whether he loved or hated it. It was like the difference between coming into someone’s home, and taking a tour through one of those model houses. Harry sat on his bed and started writing his potions essay on a mangled piece of parchment. It was warm in the room, and Draco slipped his heavy wool sweater onto an empty bed, his bare feet cushioned by the carpeted floor.
