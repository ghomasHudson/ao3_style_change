Harry tried his best not to flush red at the realisation that the reason he had been receiving more stares than usual and his own best friends didn’t know how to speak to him was because he had been wearing a tie that was not his own.
‘Do you want me not to stand up for you?’ Harry asked, slightly hurt
‘What’s it the time for then?’ Harry asked smoothly.
The weeks seemed to carry on that way. Harry and Draco would meet around the castle for hours at a time to wonder around, talk and make out. No matter how many times they met up he never grew bored of the time. He thought the electric atmosphere would fade but it didn’t.
Harry had wanted to ask questions about that but decided he didn’t want to push his luck. He knew from Luna only bits and pieces about her time at Malfoy manner but he did know she had struck up some kind of bizarre friendship with Malfoy. Two teenagers that were prisoner in that house not one. It had been another reason he’d gone to defend Malfoy at The Trials.
Silver eyes watched him closely as he moved.
Harry was pacified to see that Ron, Hermione and many members of the classroom were glaring at Smith too, who seemed defiant in the face of it, glaring straight back at them all.
‘Please call me Narcissa, Harry, and yes that would be lovely.’
Harry snickered and Draco glared as he caught his reflection in the mirror.
‘As if that cancels out what you did,’ Draco said, and once again closed his eyes, turned his head and leant back against the wall. ‘Anyway, he tried to kill you multiple times, he deserves to be where he is.’
He watched the water track down his glasses and felt as his body slowly defrosted.
Harry stared incredulously at Draco who didn’t look at him but must have understood Harry’s silence because his lips twitched.
Someone must have overheard there break up though, either as it happened by the lake shore one afternoon as Harry had promised she would always be one of his best friends or as it was recounted to Ron and Hermione later, the former gobsmacked and the latter trying to be as supportive as possible even as Harry was sure she was pleased with herself for having already guessed. By the evening meal everyone in the school knew that Ginny Weasley was gay and that Harry Potter was single.
‘Oh Harry, you don’t seem focused at all.’ He said with mock sadness
Some part of Harry’s self-control shattered at the promise in those dangerous grey eyes.
Did he really like Draco? The answer to that had to be yes.
‘I hope I can trust you both.’ She added, looking slightly longer at Draco.
‘Till the next detention, Harry,’ Draco said as he walked backwards towards the Dungeons.
‘If you’re asking me to be your boyfriend the answer is yes.’ Draco said with a smug smile.
Draco only glared.
But spending every spare moment he could with Draco meant it was becoming more difficult to balance his school work and his commitments and he’d even asked Hermione to help draw him up a timetable, obviously not mentioning what he was doing with several of his evenings and lunchtimes.
Draco gasped and his hands came to grip Harry’s hair, pulling at the messy strands as Harry circled his tongue and sucked.
‘Potter may I have a word.’ She asked over the clamour or students grabbing bags and leaving the room.
‘What?’ Came the bored response, the owner not even looking up from the piece of parchment he was writing on. .
‘I am sure you are also aware that you should be sat at your own house table.’ She continued.
Harry dropped low and swung out a foot, but his opponent jumped and danced away a few steps, all the while keeping those grey eyes on him. He was so light on his feet, he seemed to be dancing more than fighting.
‘You okay?’ He asked tentatively.
‘I didn’t see what he did Potter, if I had you know I wouldn’t have tolerated it either, but for the moment you cannot take things into your own hands like this. Whether you like it or not you are a role model to a lot of these students and your actions have consequences. I will see you in my office Wednesday evening.’
Draco chuckled.
The comment could’ve been self-pitying but Malfoy spoke so rationally and calmly it didn’t seem that he was trying to get sympathy, he just seemed to be stating a fact.
‘Huh,’ Harry said processing the information slowly, ‘Ginny does like to say that ‘everyone’s a lot gayer than you think.’ Harry mused.
It had started a chain of fortnightly parties with the different houses rotating hosting duties and, on this occasion, it had been Slytherin’s turn to host.
‘That’s three uses.’ Harry said to Draco when he noticed the man watching him from the other side of the counter with raised eyebrows, as Harry began to fry things in the pan and sliced up some bread.
‘I don’t remember you at the Battle either Smith, I remember you abandoning the DA, I don’t remember you ever having to think about fighting your own family, I remember you being a self-absorbed prick, so I suggest you keep that fat mouth of yours shut about things you don’t understand a damn about.’ He said he voice dangerously quiet.
‘Top draw.’ Draco rasped as Harry kissed a particularly sensitive spot on his neck.
With the help of the Marauders map it had not taken Harry long to find the person he was looking for.
Draco chuckled tiredly.
Harry stuck out a hand and pulled Malfoy to his feet, who immediately slipped his hand around Harry’s neck and brought their lips together. Harry was surprised by how sweet it seemed after the heat of what had come before.
Draco took his chance and began the duel with a quick jinx, taking the offense immediately and Harry gasped and focused on shielding and blocking himself from the worse of the attacks. He had started out on a back foot which was unusual for him and he had to concentrate on defending himself whilst looking for an opening to change the direction of the fight.
‘Yeah well, I’m just focusing on getting through the school year, I’ll avoid giving anyone any extra incentives to kill me. Terrorising the ‘golden trio’ definitely wouldn’t help me on that mission.’ He said grinning when Harry all but hissed at the nickname he and his friends had been given.
‘What about this?’ Draco said huskily, as a pale hand wrapped around Harry’s now hard dick.
Harry wondered just how far Draco was planning to undress him, because he wasn’t sure he would be able to say no if Draco stripped him naked and rode him right there on the table.
‘Correct?’ He asked, puzzled.
He had been surprised when Malfoy had caught him in the office, he hadn’t technically asked Harry to train, he’d asked if Harry wanted to ‘work off some frustration’ and when Harry’s eyes widened slightly he had gestured to the unsolved case Harry had been puzzling over for days now.
‘I don’t think so.’ He said in a sing song voice, before rolling onto his front and springing to his feet with incredible grace.
‘I think,’ She murmured to him quietly, ‘That you and I would be better suited, you can keep me practised and I can help perfect and sharpen your technique’ She offered.
Compared to Draco however it was nothing.
Malfoy coughed out a laugh.
‘You heard all that?’ Harry asked, not quite sure how to react to the information.
‘Suit yourself.’ Draco said with a pout before sauntering onto the dance floor leaving Harry to try not to stare at his arse.
‘Yes.’ Harry replied somewhat breathlessly as seemingly all the blood in his body went south.
Harry withdrew his fingers and lined himself up but stopped and Draco wined at the loss at sensation.
‘I would’ve died in the room of requirement, I owe you.’ He said with a twirl of the quill in his hand, it wasn’t as fine as the quills he had once seen him use.
He kissed his way up Draco’s taught stomach as he undid the buttons on his sheer shirt, standing between Draco’s knees as he did and slipped it off his shoulders as Draco sat up to kiss him, fully naked under his exploring hands.
‘Mm, my big strong Gryffindor huh? You got any idea how I’m going to get back to my dorm without being caught by a very angry Filch?’ He said.
‘I told you to call me Harry.’ He said
His eyes snapped open and stared at him.
‘Just trying to remind you who’s in charge. Lie back’
He flicked on the wireless that Cootes had brought down to listen to at the beginning of the year, claiming that it helped calm his nerves, and pulled off his dirty robes and stepped into the already steaming shower.
‘They were wonderful songs.’ Harry said with a grin.
His head turned to the side, opening his eyes looking blindly for a moment before his vision focused on the door just meters away from them.
‘Yes, I’m sure we’re all well aware of your efforts towards inter-house unity.’ McGonagall replied and Ron choked on his pumpkin juice.
The bell rang and Palmore called for the class to disperse.
When Harry had returned to Hogwarts there had been a certain element of awe that followed him around. He was used to it and it certainly had its advantages when it meant he could sprint through any corridor, the crowds parting for him like the red sea, when he was late for his lessons.
‘I was right here,’ Harry said softly, pressing a kiss to his lips, ‘and I’m not going anywhere.’ He said firmly, looking at Draco till he met his eyes.
‘Are you going to do something about it then?’ Harry asked, mimicking his words from earlier and Draco rolled his eyes before pulling the hem of Harry’s shirt over his head as Harry kicked off his shoes and set on removing his own trousers.
‘Well I do feel slightly awkward here.’ Harry murmured as he looked down, Draco was fully clothed, although sopping wet, and Harry was entirely naked.
‘I bet you would’ve.’ He said looking back down at his own work in front of him.
He had a voice like velvet and Harry had to ignore how his stomach flared with heat at the words.
Suddenly a slender pale hand wrapped around his waist and he felt as a body pressed up behind him.
‘Sneaking up on me is not a good idea, I was getting ready to hex you at the first sound you made.’ He said, turning his head to the side slightly so he could see blonde hair and a pointed nose in his periphery, the head resting gently on his shoulder.
Whilst Harry had genuinely had an enjoyable evening, he had still been plagued by the distraction that was Malfoy.
Harry saw sparks and came hard, Malfoy following him seconds later.
‘Mm.’
He was a good dancer. Sinfully good.
‘Yes.’ Harry said again, his body near humming in anticipation.
Harry had barely recognised Malfoy when he had returned to Hogwarts.
Draco caught Harry looking at his lips after one such joke and he just smiled that cocky smile, taking a sip from his beer, his grey eyes burning.
Harry falls in between Pansy and Greg this time. He listens to Draco chat with Luna about stone circles in the front of the procession while he tries to puzzle out why Draco’s upset with him. Maybe he shouldn’t have asked about his birthday, though Draco didn’t seem to mind when the others mentioned it. He seemed quite at ease with Harry until Luna brought out the cake.
“You stop!” Malfoy squeaks. “Didn’t you hear me say where your leg is pressing against me?”
Harry’s breath catches as he thinks about what it would feel like to cup that arse in his hand, to feel the heat of Draco’s body against his. What would Draco’s mouth taste like if he opened it, so softly, for Harry to explore? Would he tremble when Harry’s fingers slid under the warm black fabric?
It’s true that they’re a very affectionate couple, though Harry doubts that Greg really objects to seeing it. He and Draco agree that they’ve never seen Pansy so happy. Her tongue hasn’t lost its sharpness and her moods when she’s writing are as mercurial as ever, but there’s a deeper self-assurance below the surface now, especially when she describes herself as
“Bitten by an adder just after they lost you,” Xeno says. He reaches out to squeeze Draco’s shoulder. “Don’t worry, my boy, they went to Saint Mungo’s for some antivenom. She’s probably right as rain already. Come in and use the Floo.”
“Hermione and Ron. They bring one for me every Christmas Eve, to give me a bit of holiday cheer. And to make sure I haven’t kicked the bucket, I guess,” he added with a wry laugh.
nonsense.”
Harry slaps his hand over his mouth to keep himself from laughing. When Malfoy looks down at the dirty cuff of his shirt, then back up at Harry in outrage, Harry can’t hold it in any longer. He doubles over in muffled giggles.
Harry plants a kiss on his hair. “It’s okay, really. I’m ready to think about other possibilities now. I was barely eighteen when I started the training programme. I’ve had time to learn that I have other strengths besides
I opened my eyes and looked at him, studying the familiar features and the uncertainty in his eyes. Here was a man who argued with Death and won, who used his unfathomable power to heal me. And here, also, was the man who loved me enough to save me. It was like seeing him as I did as a crow, one moment a black silhouette, and the next, a grown-up version of the boy I’d met in the robe shop when we were eleven.
“I’m sure you did the absolute best you could for her,” Harry assured him. He gave the snake a few more strokes along her back before asking if they should return her to her enclosure.
I turned and waded back to the ledge where I’d been sitting and hauled myself back atop it to pull my boots over my wet feet. Something seemed to be crumbling inside my chest.
“Who was trying to take me?” I whispered, looking into his wide eyes.
“There you are! Luna told me you got split up in the fog. Pansy’s had a bit of a mishap, it seems.”
Harry guesses that Malfoy’s referring to the seizure of Malfoy Manor by the Ministry and Lucius’ trial. He heard the news that Narcissa left for the Continent last summer, but nothing about her son, and Hermione told him that Malfoy wasn’t among the students who returned to Hogwarts. At the time, Harry assumed that he was living off his family’s abundant gold and biding his time until he could go out in public again.
They stay there for long minutes while Draco’s breathing slows and his panic recedes, leaving exhaustion in its wake. One of Harry’s hands combs through his hair while the other one stays wrapped around his back. Draco tries to pull away, but Harry keeps him firmly in place.
“No, I don’t think it ever occurred to me that we could.”
“I wasn’t talking about the bad choices part,” Potter says. He’s having trouble looking at Draco. “I meant what you said about choosing what you think will make you happy. Do you think… being with me will make you happy?”
“Heartless,” he declared, but I heard the creak of the floorboards as he slid out of bed onto the floor.
“Why is that?”
Harry closes his eyes and reels from the revelation, the sudden tilt of his world in a new direction. He sits like that for a few moments until the first wave of emotions subsides. But just when he thinks he’s found his bearings, the sudden fear that the others are watching him—that
After George departs (seeking more gullible guests, no doubt), Verity and Hermione excuse themselves to find their respective partners. Ginny wanders over to take their place. She doesn’t bother with any pleasantries before engaging Draco in conversation.
“Harryyyyy!” Teddy cries when his godfather comes downstairs. He almost launches himself from his booster seat at the kitchen table before Andromeda, with impressive reflexes, catches him beneath the arms and sets him on the floor. Harry’s gratified to see Teddy’s hair turn a vivid shade of teal, which indicates a burst of happiness via his yet-uncontrolled Metamorph abilities.
“So, how was the rest of your week?” Harry asks as he sets his stocking feet on the coffee table. “Busy at the shop?”
He breaks off as Harry nips at his neck and pulls Draco closer by wrapping a strong arm around his waist. “We won’t fight. Disagree, yes. But I don’t want to fight.”
“It’s about time for breakfast. Shall we?” he asks, rising from the loveseat. “I think, since we both slept well, that we needn’t bother Mary about rearranging the furniture for a second bed, don’t you agree?”
His mind circles back to Draco singing in the firelight, and there it is again, the warm surge of what he now recognises as
“No, no. I just, um, have a surprise for you. For Christmas.”
He stands with his closed hand paused in mid air and sniffs again before knocking. There’s a faint crash from somewhere in the flat, followed by approaching footsteps. Malfoy yanks the door open with a slightly terrifying expression.
“Um, what did she say again?” Harry asks, noticing Malfoy’s flushed face now.
he tells himself. Soon they’ll come crashing together again, one way or another. But now they both need to rest.
Harry tries to give him a stern look to stop him from saying more, but Draco won’t be deterred.
Malfoy turns a page without looking up. “Oh, really?”
Instead of complying, he stood up and went to crouch in front of the low window in the gable end of the room. I heard the thump of Zoë’s wagging tail, then the click of her toenails on the wooden floor as she trotted over to Potter.
Harry laughs as he says it, but Draco can’t help but notice that he hasn’t brought up his surrogate family’s reaction to last weekend’s revelation. They’re not going to talk about that yet, it seems. Draco tells himself to enjoy this time with Harry, to treasure every confidence shared and every look that passes between them. There’ll be time to worry about the ramifications of their bond on some other day.
“I was practically goaded into it. By the Head Auror, not by you,” Harry clarifies. “I don’t want you to think I felt pressured at all. This was my choice, and I’m sure it was the right one.”
. I mean, every single thing is
“I’m sure you’ll be in good company.”
Draco stops by to see Mrs Allendale after retrieving the last odds and ends from his bedsit. She has a tiny Christmas tree in the corner, decorated with bright ribbons and translucent baubles, each with a tiny spark of light inside. She’s as philosophical as ever about Knockturn Alley, which has slipped back into a sense of normalcy as the year draws to a close. The Ministry’s attention comes and goes as it suits them, she reminds him as she passes him a plate of ginger biscuits. Knockturn Alley and the people in it will muddle through and persevere.
“What do you think I should study this summer, Draco? I want to do more maths. I’ve missed it. Do you know French? One of the girls in my dorm learnt it at her Muggle school.”
“Harry,” I murmured into his hair. “I’m okay. Please stop. I’m okay.”
Still, Harry can’t resist pulling another book from the shelf when he finishes the merman novel. How else is he supposed to pass the time? He’ll just have to resign himself to a little frustration until he’s back in his own flat.
plenty of other positions,” Harry says, dropping his easy smile but keeping a level voice. He detests when people assume that he’s leveraging his deeds during the war for favours or special treatment. “I didn’t want one that required qualifications that I don’t have, like NEWTs. And there’s nothing wrong with
“Nothing that isn’t completely true, I promise,” Harry whispers. “You looked a little upset as we were saying goodbye.”
Despite the fact that neither of them object to the idea, it doesn’t happen again right away.
Malfoy doesn’t reply. He shakes his wand from his sleeve and levitates another log onto the fire—something that’s completely unnecessary, even if they do stay up for a little while longer. The room is stuffy already, and Harry’s right side feels like it’s being roasted like a Christmas turkey.
A snowstorm, the first proper one since Harry arrived in New York, rolls over the city on Saturday afternoon. Harry spends the last few hours before dinner in an armchair that he dragged over to his sitting room window, watching the flakes swirl down from the heavy clouds. It’s mesmerising. He hears the scrape of shovels as bundled figures emerge from the other buildings to clear steps and pavements.
“Do you think they’ll really see it through? It’s an enormous undertaking, and I’m sure they’re both very busy.”
But Potter’s chest was warm against my back. His breath was tickling the shell of my ear as he held me close. He was solid and real and so dear to me that it ached. The wispy, shapeless dreams of a different future seemed like ghosts compared to him.
As soon as Malfoy turns back to his work, Harry lets his gaze slide over Malfoy’s tall, slender form. He can’t help but notice that it’s a very pleasing view.
“Yes, I did—the landscape paintings, in particular. They remind me of the summer visits my parents and I made to France when I was a child.”
“They were probably looking for someone, Draco. A fugitive, maybe.”
Thankfully, he ends up between Luna and Parkinson, from whom he accepts a slice of bread that Harry’s almost certain came from the fancy bakery in Diagon Alley. He often picks up a baguette or loaf of ciabatta there on his way to have dinner at Ron and Hermione’s flat, and he always takes his time making his selection so that he can enjoy the wonderful smell of warm bread as long as possible.
Draco goes right to the bedroom to repack his trunk as soon as they get back to the cottage. Harry follows and lets Draco chatter on about the island and Erwina while he carefully refolds his clothes with wordless loops of his wand. It’s obvious he doesn’t want to talk about more serious things. Harry makes the appropriate responses while he stuffs his own things into his rucksack, trying in vain to provoke a response from Draco with his sloppiness. But Draco just retreats to the bathroom to get his things from there, leaving Harry to sit on the bed with his sinking heart.
“I had tea with Mrs Allendale,” Draco replies. “We’re not late for Andromeda’s, are we?”
Harry doesn’t come to Hogwarts often these days, and when he does, he’s more often at Hagrid’s than in the castle. It hasn’t changed at all since he and Draco returned after the war. Barring another catastrophe, Harry expects that it will still be the same long after he’s gone, slow to change, like the mountains around it.
“Maybe you could just
“I was hoping we’d at least get a proper duel when it all fell apart.” Ron grunts when Hermione jabs him in the ribs with her elbow. “Nothing dangerous! Just
Halfway through the meal, there’s a loud crash from the kitchen that makes them both jump. The hum of conversation around them pauses for a moment, then resumes. Harry squeezes his eyes shut and waits for the sharp jolt to his nerves to ebb. Wills his heartbeat and breathing to return to normal.
“That’s usually all it takes,” Luna says pointedly. “Doesn’t it, Harry?”
There was a splashing behind me, and I looked over my shoulder to see Potter walking back into the water towards me, looking contrite. He wrapped his arms around me from behind, resting his forehead against my hair.
“I managed to ward it back in. It can’t hurt anyone now,” Harry tells him. “I’ll explain back at the cottage. Please?”
“Oh, yes! We should look at that. It’s in the house.” Luna ducks out of the tent without waiting for a reply.
“Oh,” Potter says. It’s obvious that he thought Draco didn’t know.
Healer Pearson places a comforting hand on his shoulder. “He’s been cursed, but he’ll recover now that you’re here. He’s been unconscious since he was hit and we’ve been trying to figure out why our treatment isn’t working. After some research, we found a counter curse that’s amplified by the presence of the patient’s soulmate. You’ll just need to be in physical contact with him while we cast it and stay with him while it takes its course.”
Draco reaches into the bag for more ham while he keeps speaking to the cat in a soft, coaxing voice. Harry has to lean against the doorway. His stomach is doing the fluttery thing again for about the fifth time since they arrived in Scotland two days ago, and he’s not sure how much more he can take.
Harry follows Goyle to the garden to retrieve the wheelbarrow, then down the sloping meadow toward the stream. They’re searching for flat stones for the fire pit, Goyle tells him when they’re standing at the water’s edge. Each stone is inspected for cracks, then gets a Feather-light Charm if it passes muster. Harry’s impressed by how meticulous Goyle is in all his work, and he catches a glimpse of a smile when he says so.
“It’s not enough,” Draco says simply, locking eyes with Harry. “Now that I can imagine… something deeper.”
Harry slashes his wand toward the broken dagger and Vanishes it. Then he sinks into a chair and puts his elbows on his knees and his hands over his face. After a moment, a warm hand cups the back of his neck, thumb stroking over the short hairs at the nape.
“I don’t think you do, Potter, but thank you for trying.” Malfoy breathes heavily into the cold air for a moment, then adds, “I don’t think I could face that, just yet. I’m not ready.”
“And Astoria?” Harry says after the pause in the conversation. “Why would she want to, um…”
“Draco. Draco.”
He draws his wand and looks at Andromeda.
“A few smiles and buying some loaves of bread are not going to make a difference,” Draco says bitterly, “not if the rest of your department despises us. You know that.”
As much as they’d like to stay tucked away, safe from disapproval (and worse), Draco knows they can’t hide here forever. He finishes putting his room in order and tries to steer his thoughts away from worst case scenarios. Instead, he lets the anticipation of seeing Harry at his door tonight quell his anxiety.
Harry hummed in agreement. “Cities are the worst. So many people. And hospitals and care homes and, Merlin, I don’t know what else. Traffic accidents and suicides. Oh, god, I’m sorry, Draco! I shouldn’t have said that.”
“Your mother did well in the class, if I recall correctly.” Andromeda tilts her head in a concerned way. “How is she faring these days? Living under the sharp eye of Great-Aunt Marie-Célèste must be trying. She has very strong opinions, to put it mildly, and expects the rest of the family to agree with her. As I well know.”
He realises then that Malfoy didn’t bring him the shepherd’s pie out of pity, but sympathy. Sympathy for someone who’s also far from home and craving the comfort of a familiar meal.
Three and a half years were enough to convince me that I was a fucking fool.
He takes Malfoy’s cue and stares into the flames, glancing over every minute or so to make sure that Malfoy isn’t upset. He seems tranquil enough on the surface, dressed with his usual care in pressed trousers and a soft—and ludicrously expensive, no doubt—silvery-green jumper. Other than reaching up to tuck his hair behind his ears, he isn’t fidgety. And yet, he closes his eyes for long moments, as if thinking of something painful.
His plan, apparently, is to spend the rest of 1998 brooding on this frigid window seat where the dimmed lights of the Eighth-Year common room barely reach him. And being the miserable bugger he knows he is, he’s not going to do anything to make himself warmer, drunker, or… more noticed. Instead, he’s going to think of all the places he could be if the terms of his probation didn’t confine him to Hogwarts until he takes his NEWTs. He could be properly drunk on decent alcohol—not the swill that Finnigan smuggled into the castle—with Pansy in Paris. He could be with his mother, listening to the waves crash through the open windows of a Greek villa.
Harry shifts from foot to foot and glances at the clock on the mantel. Fifteen minutes left.
Draco nods, wide-eyed, and Greg releases him with a satisfied grunt.
He wonders what Malfoy’s plans are once he gets home. They haven’t spoken much this morning because he’s shut himself in the guest room to study again. Harry repacked his rucksack and stripped the sheets off his bed already, so he doesn’t even have an excuse to go up there.
“All right,” he says, then doesn’t speak again for the rest of the walk.
“I know. I’ve spent more time than I ever want to in close proximity to those things,” Harry says, “and I never thought I’d find another one. I’m sorry if I scared you earlier.”
“Doing what?” I asked, laughing. “Making friends with the Acromantulas?”
He stares into the darkness for a long time, mind pitching in a storm of uncertainty and worry.
After he left, I lay watching the winter light outside turn bluer, then fade away, and thought about the way Potter had just looked at me.
“Oh, you’re fine,” I told her, irritated that our conversation had been interrupted.
. There’s something about the sound that runs like an electric current over Harry’s skin.
“You’re welcome. Shall we go have our tea, now that we’ve settled things?”
“Ham sandwiches. And crisps. Are you surprised?”
A recent string of rainy evenings has kept them indoors, cocooned in this small room. They fill their hours together with quiet conversations, tentative questions, and—increasingly—periods of comfortable silence when they’re content with simply being near each other. It feels to Draco like the birth of something fragile and wonderful, something to be nurtured like a seedling. Their bond needs time to grow and strengthen. It will have to weather storms soon enough.
“We could do that in the evening for dinner,” Luna suggests. “There’s no reason why we can’t start later in the afternoons once the nights are warm.”
“Two minutes,” Harry says, happy to change the subject before Draco can ask him about Ernie again. He reaches for the jacket draped over the back of a chair. It’s not the warmest one he owns, but he doesn’t expect to spend much time outside while he’s in Scotland, and he packed a couple of jumpers to wear as well.
“No,” Harry says, at the same time that Draco says, “
The Oak King’s bitter exile through the dark months lasts only until he has regained enough strength to challenge his brother’s rule. At Beltane, Oak reclaims the throne and the world throws itself into springtime growth and summer bounty once again.
Thank you for reading! Visit me on
“I’m going over for dinner tomorrow,” Harry replies. He pauses to watch a small animal—a fox?—dart across the road ahead of them, hardly more than a shadow against the snow. “It didn’t feel right to stay there, especially since Hermione’s spending the hols in Australia. It’s their first Christmas without Fred.”
Sure enough, Harry saw several spotted lizards sitting with their noses pressed against the glass and their dark eyes fixed on the television screen.
Goyle looks up but doesn’t acknowledge Harry as he strides through the wet grass towards the clearing. Luna waves as he approaches, then returns to her conversation with Malfoy and Parkinson. It seems to involve lots of pointing and pacing off distances.
Harry’s quiet for a moment, then he puts both hands on Draco’s shoulders, giving them a gentle squeeze. “Don’t say that. I know how much you want to help these kids. There must be some way—”
“That your snake would just eat on her own eventually, and then I was going to tell you that I hadn’t actually spoken to her. Honestly, I was going to tell you,” Harry insisted when Draco raised his eyebrows. “I just didn’t want to miss my chance to talk to you.”
“That’s not what Andromeda offered. Look, it’s only for a couple weeks,” Harry says, desperately hoping that Hermione is wrong, for once. “Surely we can manage it for that long.”
“Just a few minutes early. I can come back if it’s not ready,” Harry offers, resisting his instinct to take a step back.
“Basilisk venom. The sword of Gryffindor is—what’s the word?—
taking my clothes off!”
” Harry read aloud, with a sly look at Draco. A cheeky little lizard with protruding eyes and its mouth hanging open was stitched in colourful thread below the words. Harry wondered how many more inspirational reptile puns were scattered around Draco’s flat.
“You can have the chair tomorrow night!” Harry calls after him.
he orders himself,
A thought occurred to Harry as he looked at the vine of a houseplant that had grown long enough to start twisting across the floor.
Malfoy’s face looks ghostly inside the open window. He has pulled his scarves down, and Harry can tell, even from a few yards away, that he’s having second thoughts.
of waffles!”
As if he senses someone’s eyes on him, Potter turns his head to look at Draco. He didn’t need to look around to find him, which makes Draco think that Potter has been aware of his location all along. What a fucking pair they are. Between Potter’s utter incapacity for self-preservation and Draco’s fixation, they’re both hopeless when it comes to ignoring each other.
Draco and Harry let Naia direct them to their chairs. They watch her scamper around the kitchen, first for cutlery and a taste of whatever’s bubbling on the stove, and then to her bedroom and back to get a Transfiguration essay to show Draco.
He casts a couple of cleaning charms over himself and tries to smooth down his hair as he rushes down the short corridor and through the archway marked “Arrivals.”
“I know you’ll do it,” Luna says serenely. “Let’s go see what Draco and Greg are doing, shall we? It’s almost time for lunch.”
“Beans on toast, at my flat? I have cheese to put on top, and I still have some of the cake that Molly sent over a couple of days ago. I’d like to show you my place,” Harry says earnestly, “since you’ve had me over here so many times.”
“Aphids. They eat magical roses and a solution of powdered Dappled Apricot stone and goat’s milk is an effective repellent. It’s also the only use that I know of for this particular ingredient. Didn’t you do some research about it, if you’re investigating someone who used it?”
He helps her out of her coat and sits at the little table under the window while she puts the kettle on. There are enough chairs and mugs in the cupboard for a few guests, Draco notices. He’s never paid much attention to the comings and goings in the building; perhaps he mistook her for nosy when she’s simply being sociable.
“You really took work like that? Wasn’t it—”
Despite that, Draco still feels like a Plimpy out of water in Harry’s flat. It’s in Muggle London not far from the Leaky Cauldron, but the building’s magical through and through, with a Floo connection and wards. There are two bedrooms and a little balcony off the lounge, and the kitchen is sleek and modern. Draco can only imagine how much Harry pays in rent. He’s furnished it simply, but comfortably, with framed photos and some homely touches that are obviously gifts from friends and family: a crocheted blanket, a painting of Hogwarts that would be quite lovely if not for the lurid colour choices, and a few scraggly houseplants on the windowsills.
“I’m the one who ran off into the fog like a lunatic.” Harry pulls Draco into his arms again. “We’re neither one of us perfect. I’m just happy you want to give this a go with me. I honestly couldn’t tell at all if you were interested.”
“Yeah, maybe I will,” Harry says, tucking his book inside his jacket to keep it dry. “Thank you.”
Draco sighs against Harry’s shoulder. He trusts Harry’s opinion of Shacklebolt, whom he’s known for a decade now, but the rest of the Ministry is a different matter. There are some nasty pieces of work out there wearing Auror uniforms, and at least one of them must know where Draco lives and works.
is that he’s started feeling around Draco. And quickly.
“I’m going to turn in, too. Thanks for helping me with him today.”
Three goddamn days Harry’s been waiting to hear from Draco. He ignores the pile of post that accumulated while he was gone and doesn’t set foot in his workshop. When the Floo flares, he crouches down in front of the fireplace and tells Hermione or Ron or Molly that he’s just tired from a long week and a strange bed, and he’s taking some time off.
“How can it already be full?” Harry cries, gesturing towards the piles covering half of Malfoy’s bed.
“Who knows?” Luna says, strolling over to join the conversation. “Ley lines shift, clan borders change. It’s been thousands of years and the people who used the stones didn’t leave written records. We can still use our imaginations to envision what it must have looked like when they were standing. I’m sure they were magnificent.”
Greg makes a scornful huff and pushes the wheelbarrow towards the garden shed. Draco just sighs and retrieves the basket of tomatoes from the garden.
“Molly’s recipe,” Harry says, when Luna compliments his baking. He doesn’t have many special occasions for which to bake fancy desserts, but he’s found a tin of chocolate chip or butterscotch biscuits is welcome just about anywhere. Having a new crowd to bake for gives Harry something else to look forward to on weekends.
He offers to pay for a cab, but Harry worries about getting stuck in traffic, so they head out in the rain to walk to the nearest Apparition Point. Harry pulls the suitcase on wheels that he bought in London, bumping over pavement, while Draco holds a black brolly over their heads. It’s too small for two people. They’re definitely going to need Drying Charms as soon as they get back inside.
They finish their circuit around the park, discussing the plans for the Knockturn school and Naia’s excitement about her Hogwarts letter. They have to pause their conversation several times when there are Muggles close enough to hear, but Draco doesn’t mind. During the silence, he savours the wonder and gladness that’s buoying his heart. It’s only a stroll together in a London park, certainly nothing wildly romantic or intimate, but Draco feels like he might start floating above the pavement at any moment.
As he walks past the Museum of Natural History, Harry wonders if Malfoy goes to museums, too. Does he ride the subway and carry bags of food home from the shops? Does he have any friends here yet?
“I think I’d like to know now, please.”
Ignoring the swollen eyes and nose he glimpsed in the bathroom mirror, Draco goes to the bedroom next. Harry looks up from the bed with a concerned look, but relaxes when Draco sits on the edge of the mattress and leans in to kiss him.
, Potter, not just let your arm rest there like a Flobberworm. Can you move your other arm at all?”
“What about a shag?” Ginny asks with a grin. “Everyone needs a good romp once in a while, to perk them up. You know I can help you find someone who’s fit and can be discreet, if you just want to have a bit of fun.”
“Heartless,” Potter repeated.
“So you’re going to be living here for a while, you think?”
“Finnigan? Or was it Weasley?”
“I have some Dittany in the house that will do just fine,” Luna says. “Greg’s hoping you’ll help him get the last of the seedlings planted today, if you don’t mind. Pansy can help me if I need someone.”
cake and Dad’s going to make my favourite dinner.”
of it beneath the pleasure and exhilaration of the release.
“My dad’s parents took him in.”
There was nothing more Draco could say, so he slunk back to his desk and hid his helpless fury under a blank mask of servility.
They carefully make their way back down the ridge. The fog seems thicker than ever and Harry can see tiny droplets of water in Greg’s dark hair. He thinks of the stag that’s somewhere nearby, its rough coat dripping as it picks its way through the grass and gorse. He still wishes he could have caught up with it. Could have let himself imagine, just for a moment…
The Healer conjures a stool for Draco to sit beside Harry and instructs him to take Harry’s hand. It’s warm and dry between Draco’s palms. He hears the Healer cast beside him, a long incantation that she’s apparently committed to memory in anticipation of Draco’s arrival. He watches Harry’s face, but there’s no immediate change.
Meanwhile, Harry’s supervising Teddy while he smears fingerpaints onto a large piece of parchment spread on the kitchen table. He’s caught his godson with a blue finger up his nose once already, which probably means he should be paying closer attention. Andromeda’s preoccupied nearby with making lunch, humming softly while she casts spells to chop and boil and stir.
“I think so, unless Wharton’s changed the wards on it since he hired me.”
Draco forgot she was there. He shakes his head. Granger doesn’t speak again, but her question sends a cold gust of dread through him.
“A bit of snogging,” Potter repeats in a flat voice. “Is that what it’s been?”
“She won’t eat,” Draco said. “Adult pythons only need to eat every ten to fourteen days, but it’s been almost three weeks and I’m concerned that something is wrong with her. I’ve reread all the information I have about snake husbandry and I still can’t figure out what I’m doing wrong. She has a heat pad under her hide box, an unheated hide at the other end of the enclosure, clean aspen bedding. The temperatures are perfect and she’s not due to shed for several weeks. There are no visible signs of illness.” He let out an exasperated huff. “I was hoping you could help me figure it out.”
“Was it hard to learn?”
“I might, as long as you’re not going to go back to being a little shit again,” Harry says, irritated. Then he sighs. He really does like Malfoy other times, too. Usually when he’s worked up and being ridiculous about something, like hoarding loo roll or having imaginary fevers. Or engrossed in his studies in the middle of a mess of books and parchment. But Malfoy would probably toss him out of his flat if Harry told him that. “Do you, er, you know…”
They pass the train station, then glide around the bend where the lights of Hogsmeade come into view ahead of them. Harry’s nose registers the change from pine to woodsmoke as they approach. The bare trees are strung with glowing candles, lighting up the empty streets. In the centre of the village, a large Christmas tree towers over the low buildings, almost blinding to eyes that have grown accustomed to only moonlight.
They had talked and laughed, going out for dinners and to see professional Quidditch matches, often holding hands.  Harry could feel they were getting closer.  It was exciting and terrifying.  He’d never had time to properly date anyone before.  Was he doing this right?
Harry shrugged.  “It’s a tradition I don’t even know the origin of.  It’s supposed to be for luck, or when you want to toast something.”
Harry stepped into the empty cell, putting the bars between himself and Draco.  He stuck his hands through the bars.
This wasn’t Malfoy Manor.  That cellar had not had dungeons like this.  It seemed like a more ancient building, built of rough hewn stone.  Maybe even a castle.
They must have been the last guests to arrive, as the metal ramp was soon retracted and the boat moving down the river.  Harry could understand why Draco was in such a rush now.  They had to be here before the boat launched.
The use of his name had Draco swinging around, his eyes furious.  Glaring at Harry so hard he stopped moving, stopped trying to apologize.  With a huff, Draco went into the castle, leaving Harry outside, dripping and starting to shiver.
“You cared about me that much?  Back then?” Harry asked, incredulous.
Wand still drawn, Draco waved Harry out of the cell.  Harry walked slowly.  Here was a chance to look around, get his bearings, look for weaknesses.  Get Draco comfortable with doing this, and Harry might find a way to get away.
“Should I leave you alone?  Not sure how long until someone finds you?  No idea what the time is?  Completely trapped?” Draco said, with a bit of a smirk.
That shut Harry up for a while.  “Tenth anniversary?  How about the tenth anniversary of the day we met instead?  My 21st birthday?”  That was less than three years away.
“You said you liked the feel of my magic.  I don’t think I’ve ever felt yours that strongly before,” Draco said.
Draco rolled his eyes.  “No.”  He tried to look irritated, but Harry could see the corner of his mouth twitching, trying not to laugh.
Turning, Draco was soon gone.  Harry didn’t blame him.  A lot had happened so fast.  He sunk in the bed, his mind whirling, heart still pounding.
It was a while later Harry was lying beside him, a goofy smile on his face.  “So, when you say you cared about me for ages, did it start in the robe maker’s shop?  The first day we met?”
Reaching over, Harry took his hand and gave it a squeeze.  “I get it.  It was a strange situation.  Small things got amplified.  Like I thought a lot about that time we played tag.  Like, um, several times during the nights.”
Sitting up, Harry leaned against the headboard.  “So, are we in a good place now?  Are there things lingering from the past we need to deal with?”
Harry was howling as Draco floundered about in the shallow water, finding his feet and standing.  He was completely drenched, his fair hair plastered to his head, struggling to spit out any pond water he had taken in.  The only thing that shut Harry up was cold water hitting him on the face and chest.
There was a sliding sound, and Harry was instantly awake.  It was Draco again, pushing a tray beneath his door.
He held out a small bottle towards Harry.  “It’s a potion.  I think you might have a concussion from when I tackled you.  Your head hit the floor pretty hard.”
Of course, Draco seemed to be bringing him his meals, likely three times a day.   Could he work on Draco?  Get him to let him go somehow?  Lure him close and grab his wand?  Were there keys for the door or was it unlocked with a spell?
They were pressed together, body against body, just the bars between them.  Harry shifted and pressed against Draco, just wanting more, wanting to be closer.
A half hour later, the helpful staff had them in helmets and sitting on bikes they had adjusted to the right seat height.  Harry felt a thrill, sitting on his, memories of doing it as a child coming back.  He’d never owned his own bike, but he’d occasionally been able to borrow one for a few quick minutes from a schoolmate or two, enough to get the rudimentary skills.
“What?” Draco asked, jarred out of reading his book.  It was a sunny day, and they were sitting on the bench, enjoying the gentle sunshine.
He had been enjoying snuggling with Draco, waking up slowly, warm and relaxed.
Just like with skipping rocks, Draco wasn’t satisfied until he was making equally annoying sounds himself. His eyes glinted in amusement when Harry cringed at a particularly loud screech.
Harry had rarely seen him looking so frustrated, and it raised similar emotions in him.  A mess of unvoiced, unresolved stuff.  “Do you really have no idea?”
“Your 19th birthday then.”
His eyes landed in Draco again. His enemy, no matter that he was being relatively kind, bringing Harry his meals, letting him be outside like this. He wouldn’t stop his father when he arrived, wouldn’t stand in the way when he came for Harry. Just like he hadn’t stopped Snape from killing Dumbledor. Maybe he wasn’t evil enough to kill the headmaster himself, but he had facilitated it. Let Deatheaters into Hogwarts. Students and Order of the Phoenix members had been attacked.
Harry stood up.  “You just need some more practice.  Come on, I’m tired of sitting around.”
Harry pushed the stupid questions whirling around his brain away, and just concentrated on the moment.  Being here with Draco.  It had been an amazing night.  A great meal, talking about some difficult things, being more intimate with each other.  He’d never felt so close to anyone before, and just wanted more.
“So your father could appear at anytime to take me to your Dark Lord?  To be killed?  Like a lamb to the slaughter?”
“Um, it’s very nice,” Harry said, trying to relax into it.  “So, where did you hear about this?  And the B&B?  Everything?”
Harry felt it in his knees, and he grabbed for support, his hands ending up on Draco’s hips.  He tugged him closer, digging his hands in, sinking into the sensations.
“I’m sure many people find you attractive,” Harry quipped.
Lucius, who could appear at any moment and grab Harry. Apparate him to throw him down at Voldemort’s feet. Harry could just imagine the proud tilt of his head, delivering such a prize to his Dark Lord. It would put him back in his good graces, back into his top lieutenant role. Voldemort’s right hand man. Malfoy honour restored in a single act, just like he’d said at the Manor to Draco.
Harry was surprised at the remark, but tried not to show it.  Ron thought Harry liked Draco back then?  Had that been part of it?
“This is intolerable!”
Draco’s eyebrows rose slightly.  “So, you are kind of claustrophobic now?  Is that why you were so insistent I let you come outside?”
“I’m OK,” Draco said simply, leaning in to give a light kiss on his cheek.   “Um, watching you, um... was enough.”
He sighed in frustration.  What the hell was going on?
And then he felt something else.  Draco’s lips against his, and his hand going past the bars to dig into his hair.  It was hard and passionate right from the start, way more intense than any kisses he’d had before.
His kiss was light, and Harry closed his eyes.  He wanted to kiss back, but couldn’t even move that small amount.  He could still feel though, as Draco leisurely moved over his face.  Soft kisses along his jawline, near his ear that almost felt ticklish, on his closed eyelids.
“Let’s go inside now,” Draco said, taking Harry’s empty glass and setting it on a table.  He guided him through a doorway, and staff led them to a table near a large window, elegantly set up with a white tablecloth, fine china and silverware.  Candles flickered on all the tables.  The room was able three quarters full.  Harry thought it was likely packed in the summer months, when more tourists were in London.
“More comments like that, and I’ll gag you too,” Draco said, unlocking the door and waving Harry through.
Draco looked puzzled.  “Is this what muggles do since they can’t do fun things, like play Quidditch?”
dinner in here.  If there even is a dinner...”
From what Draco had said, Harry was pretty sure Draco was alone too.  No family members or other Deatheaters.  Some house elves doing the chores, under his command.
Harry was undeterred.  “Surely we can find a quiet corner, or something.”
Draco seemed to sense his friends shifting, reacting to the tension between Harry and Draco.  “Easy,” he crooned, keeping them from doing something stupid.
“Oh fuck!”
Harry could see how stiffly Draco was holding his shoulders and could only imagine how horrible it had been.  “I can’t say that I’m sorry I got away, Draco.  You know I would have been killed if I stayed.  If there had been a way I could have done it without hurting you, I would have.”
Harry had been taking his first sip of his wine when he heard that, and it didn’t end well.  There was a bit of choking and sputtering, and red wine ended up places it didn’t belong.
“Hold out your hands,” Draco said firmly, his wand out.
“Good thing we have nowhere to rush off to,” Draco said, kissing along Harry’s neck.
By the time Draco settled between his legs, Harry was fully aroused again.  He passed Draco the lube.  “Prep me?”
Draco shifted to being on his back, his hands keeping Harry near, rolling on top on him, taking his weight and liking it.  His legs spread, letting Harry settle between them, and even through all the material between them, they were rocking together.  Kissing the whole time.
“Stasis charm,” Draco panted.  “Eat later.”
Harry chuckled, grabbing hold of his shoulders and pulling him back down. “Why the hell would we do that?”
“Um, OK if I take your pants off?” Draco asked, leaving the lube near his pillow.
“Yes!  And I liked the river dinner thing.  It looked kind of touristy at first, but I liked the meal and dancing with you,” Harry said.
Opening his eyes, Harry tried to speak, but his jaw was frozen shut.   He was entirely at Draco’s mercy.
“Run off and skip some rocks?” Harry joked, liking that Draco was telling him some private stuff too.
He sensed a presence beside him.  Draco, a tentative smile on his face.  “I wanted to do something special...,” he said, a flicker of self-doubt coming across his face.
He was lying on his back, pyjamas twisted around his body evidence that he had been restless in the night.  He had gotten used to sleeping in just his underwear, living alone for the past few months.
Draco was laughing hard now, until Harry retaliated with flinging handfuls of mud.  His aim was very good.  It kept escalating until they were both soaked, mud-smeared and breathless.
And then Draco rolled off, to the side, panting himself.  Seeming to need a minute or two to cool down just as much.
Draco stilled above him, pulled out of the moment.  “No, no... nothing like that.”
Smirking slightly, Draco pulled out his wand and apparated them into his bedroom.  They were aroused enough to not hesitate striping each other, clothing coming off almost magically.
Draco raised an eyebrow slightly, but was curious enough to go along with the request.
That had Harry freezing, quickly reviewing what he had just said.  “Um, well, I mostly meant I love it when you are open and honest with me, but in the bigger view of things, um, ... yeah.... Yes.  I do love you, Draco Malfoy.”
But as Draco turned to lock the door to the house, Harry broke away.  He dashed across the lawn, right to the main gate.  It was ten feet tall at least, made of wrought iron in elaborate swirls, and topped with sharp spires.  He reached out with his bound hands, but before they came in contact with the metal, he felt a sharp buzz of pain.  He instinctively lost his balance, falling on his ass, the breath knocked out of him.
“You don’t like it as much as treacle tarts, do you?” Draco said, taking the last bite of the warm sticky toffee pudding.
Harry shrugged a shoulder.  “It’s a bit different dating men instead of women, I think.  Not that I’m that experienced with either.”
It didn’t take long.  It had probably been a week, maybe longer, since he had taken some alone time from Ron and Hermione.  He would find a quiet place in some bushes, cast privacy wards, and take care of himself.  A bit of pleasure, some stress relief.
Harry mentally flipped through the possibilities.  Draco was around Pansy Parkinson a lot, but Harry thought she was more interested in Draco that he was in her.  Blaise Zambini?  Was he gay?  Was Draco?
“If it leads to kissing like that, yes.  Seven days a week and twice on Sundays,” Harry said, stepping closer to kiss Draco.
He heard a mumbled spell, and the blindfold was gone.  He blinked at the sudden brightness and then felt it, Draco licking the tip., circling it.  He looked down, their gazes catching and holding as Draco opened his mouth, taking Harry in.
Draco nodded, already staring down at Harry’s underwear.  The stretchy black cotton was tented out with his erection, and he laid his hand over it, giving a light squeeze that made Harry jump a bit.
Draco was here, but who else?  The food had been good enough that Harry knew there must be at least some house elves.  Preparing food for Draco as well, taking care of his needs.  Were his parents or crazy aunt here too?  Other Deatheaters?  Why were they keeping him here?  Why hadn’t they turned him over to Voldemort?
Draco put the blindfold on him first, so snugly that no light bled around the edges.  His hands tilted Harry’s head up for a deep kiss, before urging him to lie back against the pillows.  The rope was made out of a smooth material, maybe even silk.  It wrapped tightly around Harry’s wrists, holding them snugly, but not digging in or irritating his skin.  Draco attached the ropes to the bedposts, leaving his lower body free.
Harry tipped his chin up, loving the caresses.  “They might need some work. Add some other implements to play with.”
“Come on.  I’m curious.  Hermione was raised as a muggle too, and Ron… well, you know things weren’t typical at his house…”
“Never done much of anything.  Have you?”
A thought hit Harry, and it accompanied a sinking feeling in his gut, making it feel even more true.  Was all this, everything Draco was doing, in response to their fight?  He was calling Harry by his first name, after all, like he’d complained about.
Chuckling at his expression, Harry grabbed his arm and tugged him into the shop.
Draco sighed, closing his book.  “So, you want to know what wizard families with money are like?  Kids go to school, the parents work, same as you.”
He didn’t think he would need it.  He had gone longer between doses today.  But he didn’t want to need it during the night and not have it.
“And the trial?”
It was only then that Harry realized they were in Draco’s bedroom.  Shirtless.  Alone.  With a bed.
-Thames dinner cruise: “The best night in town is on the river! Wine, dine and dance on this great dinner cruise on the Thames, and enjoy show songs and top hits sung by a live performer. Stunning views are on the menu too, as the inky-dark night along great vistas of riverscape gives way to the spectacular lighting of Thames-side buildings and bridges.”
Draco eventually moved off Harry, both breathing hard.  Harry assumed it was another break, but then Draco rolled him on his side, facing away, and spooned up behind him.  The binding above his head allowed for such movement.
Harry was a Gryffindor, and sometimes jumped into things a bit too rashly.  Getting up, Harry looked down at the rug.  “Just lie down, right here?”
He looked around, a bit frantically, his head buzzing. It took a few deep breaths to calm himself down. Trees, hedge, grass...
Draco had some feelings too, it was obvious.  Were they strong enough to let Harry go?
Harry was grateful that Draco had not commented on what had happened. Had just helped him as he needed it.  Left Harry with as much pride as he could.
Harry could tell Draco was upset, barely holding it together.  They had to get through this.  Clear the air.  He sighed, looking away.  “How about after all this time, you still call me Potter?  How am I supposed to take that?”
His skin was a bit flushed, his eyes burning with anger, and his hands were waving around.  It was the complete opposite to the cool, remote Draco Harry had mostly seen in recent years.
Harry said softly, and it felt like a piece of his heart was dying as the magical bonds went around Draco, even covering his mouth.  Harry pulled a blanket over his still body, tucking it around his neck, wanting to give him some comfort.
Harry glanced back at the castle.  “Surely in that huge building there must be some things to help while away the time.”
“Maybe she found you attractive,” Harry said, the half smile threatening to come back.
”Woah,” Draco said, turning quickly, his arms out for his own balance.  But his stance was tense, his eyes wary, and he checked Harry quickly.
The shocking thoughts jarred Harry, and he sat up using a rush, wrapping his arms tightly around his bent knees. “Yes, yes, I can think of something...um...”
Brushing a hand through Draco’s hair, he nodded.  “Completely.”
Draco pulled back, his heavy-lidded eyes dark, his lips a little swollen and wet.  Deliciously aroused-looking, in a way that made things tighten even more low in Harry’s body.
“If you live with me as of that day,” Draco haggled back.
Pulling back, Harry met Draco’s gaze steadily.  “Will you take the job?  I know I pulled some strings to get you in the door but I think the job will suit you.  I won’t interfere again.  How you do in the job is entirely up to you.  Olivia won’t keep you around if you’re shite at it.”
It had been fun, cycling along the path by the river, just being outside together.  He felt pleasantly tired from the exercise.
Harry chuckled.  “Yeah, I was just teasing you.  Do you mean it was true?  You were into that then?”
“Sheesh, Potter, you have grass stains all over your jeans,” Draco sneered in slight disgust.
It had started on the sofa, but they quickly realized it wasn’t that comfortable.  Harry had readily agreed when Draco had suggested moving to a bedroom, perhaps a bit too eagerly.
That had Draco’s eyes zipping to Harry’s, who made sure his expression was one of teasing.  Maybe even a bit flirtatious.  At least that’s what he was going for.  It probably looked like he had indigestion, for all he knew about this.
Harry wasn’t holding back, loving how responsive Draco was being.  Sometimes he shied away from Harry being on top.  But all the signals were that he was just as into this.  His hands were even pushing up Harry’s top, running over his bare back.
Yawning and stretching, Harry got up.  The clothes Draco had set out were very nice.  So, they were going somewhere fancy.  Draco had certainly planned everything this weekend.  Harry was half excited, half dreading, whatever would happen next.
Draco bound his wrists and prodded Harry along, his lips pressed tight together.  Harry simply walked down the steps and into the cell, feeling a bit sad as Draco locked him in for the night without saying another word.
Draco picked up a couple items from the bed stand, holding them out for Harry to see them.  A blindfold made of silky black material, and a deep red rope.
Harry sat up beside him, reaching over to take his hand.  “Can I cook for you?  Um, next time?”
“Yeah right.  Dream on, Potter,” Draco said over his shoulder as he left.
-A/N:  Thanks for giving this sequel to ‘Captivate’ a try.  It’s a WIP, with drafts done of most of the chapters.  I will post at least once a week.
“Fuck, this is cold,” Draco complained, as he walked to stand by Harry, dunking to clean up as well.
Eventually Draco turned his head to look at Harry.  “What things gave you that impression?”
It became a blur after that.  Panting, kissing, thrusting, groaning.  Both a bit out of control.  Harry came first, all over Draco’s chest.  But he managed to keep his hold on Draco, loving the way he gasped, his body tightening and shuddering, finding his release.
Was this Draco’s version of that?  Trying to give Harry what he asked for?  Acting like a couple in public?
Leaving the diadem in its box, Harry stepped away to face them, heart pounding.  His eyes drank in the sight of Draco.  He was wearing his black suit, looking much the same as he had a month ago.  But his face was a bit thinner, his skin paler, and his eyes harder than Harry had ever seen them.
“We could say our vows and I could kidnap you again.”
The ridiculous sight made Harry laugh so hard his boats were falling behind.  Seeing this, Draco turned his head to flash Harry a triumphant smile.  Unfortunately, that made him slip a little and he fell with a big splash, head first into the pond.
-A/N:  Just one chapter left!  Thanks for reading!
Eventually, Draco sat back, his lips swollen and his eyes  half-lidded.  He released Harry’s bonds.  “I better get home,” he said softly, swinging his legs to sit on the edge of the bed and tugging at his clothes to straighten them.
A funny thought struck him.
Draco pushed Harry against the wall, kissing him deeply, nothing held back.  Harry groaned, his arms going around Draco and hugging him close.  Finally.  It felt so good.  So right.
Feeling a bit ashamed, Harry kicked off his shoes and pulled the blanket over him.  He undid his jeans, pushing his underwear aside, and closed his eyes.  He let his mind drift as he started stroking.  He had to stop only seconds later, swearing to himself at the lack of his wand.  No way to cast a mufliato charm or anything else for privacy, like he had learned in his early years at Hogwarts, sharing a dorm room with other horny teens.  No way to produce lube.  He resorted to spitting in his hand, the replacement not as good but allowing him to continue.
“To that drafty old castle?”
It was a surprise when Draco’s arms came around him, pulling him close.  Harry hugged him back, tucking his face against his shoulder.  The tight, sad knot of feelings inside him slowly unravelled, replaced by the wonder of the moment.  Holding Draco Malfoy, on a bed, after they had had sex.  Well, kind of.
Harry could not kill easily either. He always tried to disarm or stun his opponents, usually able to defeat them or escape. But this was war, and the stakes were extremely high. He was an adult now, and the other side hadn’t been pulling its punches. That massive snake had almost killed him at Christmas, at Godric's Hollow.
Harry gave a light chuckle.  “I was raised as a muggle.  I was just wondering what my childhood would have been like if my parents hadn’t…” he trailed off, stopping himself from mentioning the name Voldemort.
It felt like they were duelling for hours, every time Harry was beginning to get the upper hand to a point where he could finish the fight Draco would say something, quietly enough, to distract him and quickly take the offense. As time wore on though Harry could tell that Harry was getting the offense back quicker and Draco was having to defend himself harder. He was waiting for Draco’s distracting comment when he suddenly realised that it wasn’t going to come, the class had grown quieter without the sound of duelling students and Harry realised people around the room where watching them, the last fighters standing, talking to their partners, Harry was pretty sure Dean and Seamus were betting on them.
At least 13 different girls had come up to speak to him about going on dates by the end of his meal.
‘Mrs Malfoy, would you like to stay for breakfast, seeing as your son forgot about your lunch arrangements it only seems fair.’ He added.
But Draco was getting slower and sloppier as he tired and Harry was finally able to end the duel when Draco’s wand shot out of his hands and he relaxed his fighting stance and put his hands up in surrender.
Every time he caught the sight of white blonde hair or a flash of grey eyes he was reminded of Draco and his cheekbones and his forearms.
‘Mission accomplished.’ Harry said with a chuckle.
Harry had talked, laughed and danced the night away only settling down at around 2am into one of the comfy chairs around the edges of the room, bathed in shadow so as to hide the occupants from others in the room. Harry wasn’t sure if this was deliberate but it was effective and a nice touch.
But did this mean he was gay too? He’d never even considered it before, he had definitely had crushes on Cho and Ginny but if he was being honest with himself that was probably true of Cedric as well.
‘We didn’t have to fight to get like this Harry, you could’ve just asked nicely.’ Malfoy said with a sweet smile. Sweat was beading on his forehead and his hair was a mess, falling out of the bun he had tied it back in. If Harry’s hands hadn’t been pinned either side of his head he might’ve reached out a hand to card his fingers through that white blonde hair.
‘No idea, I’ve definitely had crushes on girls so I’d guess no, I just know I’m not straight.’
‘No, I’ve taken a residence in London, it allows me to be closer to my son, perfect for when he remembers he’s supposed to be going for lunch with me.’ She said, giving the reason for her visit without making him feel rude for asking.
Harry went roun4d and round in circles.
‘I might be able to fit you into my busy sched-’
‘Faster.’ He panted and Harry set a faster more punishing pace, moving between Draco’s legs as they came up to wrap around his hips.
He almost wanted to ask if he had something on his face, but he’d been too tired and irritable to bother.
Harry breathed deeply through his nose before he replicated the stance.
‘I thought we were calling each other by our actual names.’ He said.
‘I should be there too.’ He murmured quietly.
He smacked his head up into Malfoy’s own and connected with his forehead, pain exploding behind his eyes. Not the smartest move but the one available to him.
‘Potter I don’t hate you.’
Draco stepped back, admired his work, and used Harry’s tie to pull him towards him in a kiss before he dropped down onto the bench next to him and pulled a plate towards himself.
‘Surprised?’ Harry asked as he moved to look down at Malfoy, a hand either side of his head.
‘Every time you take your shirt off in training, I have to concentrate on not drooling.’ Malfoy said as his fingers delicately traced across Harry’s chest, lingering on his nipples and on the planes of his muscles. Fingers were quickly replaced by his tongue, steadily moving down his body.
Malfoy turned slowly in his chair.
Draco glared harder.
Finally being able to get back into Quidditch and on a broom again had been like realising he’d been missing a limb for months and then finally getting it back. Returning as the captain and still with his sixth-year team intact had given the Gryffindor team an advantage over the others that Harry had been exploiting. With the help of regular practise and genuine enthusiasm Harry was enthusiastic about the team’s chances.
‘This is quite kinky from you Potter, I didn’t expect you to be into choking, thought maybe you were more vanilla. I’m pleasantly surprised.’ He said in a strained voice.
Draco barely blinked as he kept dancing. Eyes still on Harry, eyebrows slightly raised, even as he raised an arm and placed it on the shoulder of the man behind him.
Malfoy slammed his hand into the mat, tapping out of a fight that he couldn’t win, and Harry almost moaned in relief as he let Malfoy go, allowing him to roll away and pant into the mat.
He looked around the room and saw eyes following his, whispered conversations behind hands, blatant pointing and staring. Unfortunately for him, the chosen one, the saviour of the wizarding world, this wasn’t exactly uncommon and so it was still difficult to judge whether or not anything was the matter.
As they sat chatting Harry couldn’t help but notice that whenever they spoke, whilst it always started friendly it descended into something more seductive.
Malfoy dove for Harry, taking him down onto the mat once more, getting a leg over his own, and pinning his arms above his head.
‘That and fear of your ever present and surprisingly aggressive fan base.’ He said.
Harry had taken an instant liking to her, she was precise and brilliant with a wand but firm and took no nonsense from anyone, even Harry.
Harry feinted right and when Malfoy, bouncing on the balls of his feet, moved to accommodate the change Harry swung for Malfoy and caught him with a right hook, Malfoy’s head whipped to the side, as he dropped to one knee.
‘I couldn’t help your dad.’ Harry stated.
Draco caught the bartender’s attention again and made a gesture that got him scurrying to make Harry another drink.
The whole thing felt so much like 6th year Harry felt he was living in a near constant state of déjà vu. It wasn’t suspicion though that made him want to be close to Draco though. He didn’t really know what it was.
Harry growled.
Harry’s brain took a moment to catch up.
‘I don’t think I actually ever properly said thank you for that,’ Draco said after a few minutes, ‘Not in person,’ he interrupted when Harry went to correct him thinking of the letter he had received three days after the verdict.
‘Well I guess it doesn’t matter; I’m dressed well enough for the two of us.’ He said with a smug look at Harry before grabbing Harry’s hand and dragging him into the queue.
‘Deal.’
‘Is this okay?’ He asked meeting Draco’s eyes.
He swallowed the rest of his drink and stalked onto the dance floor taking the hand that Draco reached out for him and pulling him off the dance floor towards the door to the smoking area.
‘That’s a relief, the girls in this place would’ve had a riot.’ Ron said.
‘No you shouldn’t.’ He growled, his voice once again going quiet instead of loud with his anger.
Harry had to fight to keep his breathing even. He was going to do something stupid if he didn’t get out of this hold soon. He redoubled his efforts to shift Malfoy off him.
‘What are you holding back on me for Potter?’ He asked in a low, velvety voice. ‘What are you so afraid of?’
‘Whichever you prefer.’ Harry quipped back.
‘Is that what you kids are calling it these days.’ She said with a smirk.
A loud crash behind them made Harry jump and they broke apart.
Harry grimaced, told Hermione and Ron he’d meet them at lunch, and went to get scolded for losing his temper with another student, but once again Palmore surprised him.
There was most definitely something wrong with his friends, something they weren’t telling him, something they felt embarrassed about to mention. Frankly Harry was too tired to bite and ask them what they were so stressed about, preferring to let them sit and stew about whatever it was causing them so much angst. If they wanted to tell him they would.
‘Right then, I think I’m gay.’ Harry said determinedly.
Harry groaned and shoved him in the shoulder as Draco laughed.
Harry just groaned.
When he’d arrived at breakfast they’d taken one look at him and their conversation had stopped.
‘Have you got condoms and lube?’ Harry asked as he kissed at Draco’s neck.
‘Oh and Potter,’ Harry turned, ‘My lips are sealed.’ She said with a small smile.
If Malfoy didn’t shut up soon, Harry was going to get a very unfortunate boner, Malfoy would never let him hear the end of it.
And then the noise in the room kicked it up a notch.
‘Was that a request or a demand?’ Malfoy asked with a crooked smile.
‘Good morning.’ Narcissa Malfoy said over the top of her mug with a knowing smile.
‘Duelling skills like that would’ve been useful on Harry’s side of the Battle back in May.’ Said a snide voice.
He had even enjoyed watching Hermione and Ron having to deal with the hero worship properly for the first time. It had worn off on Hermione quickly, especially as in the beginning she had barely gotten enough peace and quiet from nosy students to open a book and Harry had watched the frustration grow in his friend with a tiny edge of smugness. Harry had always figured, however, that Ron would have been delighted with the newfound fame and attention, something that Harry had assumed he had desperately wanted, but just like Hermione it had seemed to grow old pretty quickly. In Ron’s case he had suddenly become much more popular with the ladies, but as a result of Hermione, he had no interest and his turning down of dates had gotten shorter and snappier as the weeks had gone on. His scowls had frightened off even the most determined of girls.
As Harry tried to get used to the tight, warm sensation he began to set a rhythm, moaning as he thrust in.
Harry’s heart thudded to the sound of the music Malfoy had put on in the training room, it was deep, dirty and thudding and Harry could feel it in the soles of his bare feet. Auror’s used the training room to spar, train and generally work out, and usually Harry was very happy in it, but it was past midnight and the ministry was mostly empty, it was just the two of them and the situation felt dangerously close to tipping out of his control.
The closer he got the quieter the room became and before Harry could really make sense of what was happening the boy was stood in front of him and reaching across the space between them, going towards his neck. There was an almighty scraping of benches, that rung out louder in the silence caused by the scene, as students stood around the room to get a better view of what was happening.
Clearly Harry wasn’t the only one who appreciated his dance moves as before Harry could finish his drink a man had slipped behind Draco and pulled him against him.
‘I don’t do that.’ Harry grumbled.
‘I would’ve loved to see that.’ He said with such sincerity it made Harry laugh.
Harry tried to turn in the arms that were still wrapped around his body but they tightened, restricting his movement.
‘Okay’ Harry said, beginning to turn towards the door
Over the next few days every single one of Harry’s thoughts seemed to be consumed by Draco.
Harry grinned and leaned in to kiss him, sweet and happy and short.
Harry stopped moving abruptly.
‘Not gonna live that down for a while, am I?’ He asked, but he couldn’t stop the grin that stretched across his face at the sound of Draco laughing.
He was aware of Palmore watching them duelling carefully and flushed, he had always done well in their duels and he didn’t want her to think he struggling all of a sudden.
Harry froze as he took in the blonde-haired woman sat at the kitchen counter drinking from a steaming mug.
Harry just grinned.
Draco had wanted to go out and had suggested a club in muggle London that Harry actually recognised the name of. He was even pretty sure he’d been there once.
‘Of course, Professor.’ He said politely before walking away a few steps and taking a duelling stance, withdrawing his wand from his robe sleeve as he did so.
‘Shit yeah, sorry Draco.’
‘Neither of us needs to practise.’ Malfoy said silkily.
Draco sighed.
‘And you bet on it?!’ Harry yelped incredulously as Draco snickered.
They stared at each other for a beat.
‘Good thing I’m so stealthy.’ Draco replied, pressing a kiss to Harry’s jaw
That thought alone made so little sense to him it gave him a headache.
‘What did you do to end up here?’ He asked.
Malfoy bit his lip.
‘Shut up.’ Draco said with a tired laugh.
‘Pleasantly so.’ Malfoy replied before he moved up onto his elbows to kiss Harry again. Harry felt hands on his chest and then Malfoy pushed him roughly away. ‘But you’ve seen nothing yet.’
Harry followed soon after, climaxing so hard he saw stars and fell on top of Draco with a groan.
He was about to turn so that his back wasn’t to the door when he heard it. A rustle, something moving, there was someone in this changing room with him.
They lay there for a second, just gasping until Harry rolled off him.
Harry just grinned to himself as he pulled on clothes, by the time he was dressed Draco seemed to finally be satisfied with his hair and he took Harry’s hand and began to lead him from the changing room.
‘Your mother saved my life and you hardly acted of your own free will. Is the only reason you’ve not been actively annoying me out of some bizarre sense that you owe me something?’ He asked.
That Wednesday found him in McGonagall’s office but to his surprise not alone.
‘I wondered when I might see you around here.’ She said with a sly smile that Harry recognised immediately, and he rubbed at the back of his neck. ‘Tea, coffee, juice?’ She asked.
Harry couldn’t help but snort at that.
Harry grinned as he kneeled down again before removing Draco’s shoes and socks and then grabbed the waistband of Draco’s jeans and began to pull them off his legs. When they were off, he kissed his way slowly up Draco’s legs enjoying the sound of his breathing becoming more laboured the farther up he got. When he reached Draco’s cock and swallowed the whole thing down again just to remind him that he could he laughed as Draco’s head fell back against the sheets after he pulled off.
‘Do you even know how to dress up Potted?’ Draco said, he eyebrows raised.
‘I don’t like people being jinxed when there back is turned’ She had said to Harry, pulling him out of the flow of students after sending Smith smartly to the hospital wing
‘You’d be dead by now,’ he said to Malfoy, panting a little as the other man focused on catching his breath.
‘Potter!’
This was not a popular option for any members of the Gryffindor team, most preferred to shower back in the dorms in Gryffindor tower but if the room was empty Harry quite enjoyed the peace and quiet.
‘Shit I didn’t even think of that, I just wanted to surprise you.’ Draco said and Harry could hear the wince in his voice.
‘Non-verbal and wand-less Potter, trying to impress me?’ He asked teasingly even as Harry could tell that he was slightly impressed by the surprise in his eyes.
‘Ron!’ She admonished, shoving at his shoulders until he sat up again.
‘Yeah well it sorted out the whole ‘coming out’ thing.’
Harry would have been angry that so many people thought he hated Draco if it weren’t for the fact that it had been so true for so many years. He had hated Draco, could one person really develop a crush on someone they had once loathed so much?
‘And I don’t like bullying.’ Harry shot back quickly.
Harry watched as Draco got ever closer to where he was seated, seemingly completely unfazed by the effect he was having on the room. Everyone was watching, every eye was trained on Malfoy’s progression up the table, probably expecting a fight. Hands were twitching towards their wands, in pockets, up sleeves, on tables, all around the room. Harry could practically feel the stares of the Professors up on the teachers table boring into the back of his head, ready to step in at any moment.
‘Stop flirting with me,’ Harry ground out. ‘We’re supposed to be practising.’
Harry was instantly furious and he grabbed Draco’s chin, making him look at him. His eyes flew wide and Harry could’ve laughed at the look of shock on Draco’s face if he hadn’t been so mad.
Cool pale knuckles brushed against his Adam’s apple and he had to refrain from biting his lip, instead opting to raise his eyebrows at the boy who was so clearly enjoying the show he was putting on.
He lifted his head from his breakfast and saw as Hermione and Ron looked, wide eyed, at something happening over his shoulder.
Harry allowed himself to fall back to the mat, manoeuvring to help Malfoy pull the t-shirt off his torso when he pulled at it, and then Malfoy moved up to straddle his waist, grinding down into Harry’s lap just enough to make Harry groan.
‘What?’
‘You could leave the top off,’ Malfoy called from the floor, ‘Just for me.’
Harry watched, panting, as a Ravenclaw girl began to collect the broken shards of a glass she had dropped, Draco extricated himself from Harry’s lap, falling back onto the seat and scrubbing at his eyes. When Harry turned to look at Draco, still breathing heavily, his heart sank. Draco wouldn’t meet his eyes.
Even when his hatred of Malfoy had turned into grudging respect and then into lust he had been protected by years of animosity and the knowledge that his desires certainly weren’t reciprocated. What was supposed to protect him now, the cat was out of the bag.
They had already beaten the Hufflepuffs 230-140 in the November match.
‘Is this okay?’ Draco asked quietly but clearly, pressing kisses to Harry’s neck and jaw as his fingers slowly explored Harry’s chest.
The realisation that he wanted a relationship with Draco had struck him hard and fast but not nearly as badly as the sudden realisation that Draco may not want a relationship from him in return. Harry hadn’t realised how much he felt for Draco, and all from the simple act of walking quietly, hand in hand.
His head fell forward onto his chest and Draco continued to stroke him slowly till he could open his eyes and when he was sure he wasn’t going to topple over in the shower he concentrated on slowing his breathing.
Sure enough the head teacher was soon stood in front of them.
‘I imagine that if you could find him, he might appreciate some company.’ Palmore said, and there was a clarity in the way that she looked at Harry that made him feel both slightly self-conscious and gave him the impression she no longer believed as most people did that he hated Malfoy, quite the opposite.
Malfoy stood up from his chair stalking towards where Harry was sitting, that small smirk still on his face.
‘Wow, Potter-endorsed and everything.’ Malfoy replied with amusement.
‘If you could reclaim your seat Mr Malfoy, this is a punishment, not an opportunity to… socialise.’
Malfoy began to crawl towards him.
The arms around him loosened enough that Harry could turn around and he was met with those lovely grey eyes.
He stared up at the blurry red canopy above his head, shocked at this new way of thinking about himself.
‘Come on mate,’ Ron said, a hand on his shoulder pulling him away, ‘He’s not worth it.’
‘Indeed.’ Said the voice behind him, and it sounded like Draco was far too pleased with himself.
It felt like every time he got the blonde out of his head he would catch a glimpse of him walking down the hall or he would be in Harry’s next class.
Malfoy moaned low and deep and Harry felt it right in his belly. He bit Malfoy’s lip and when the other man gasped below him, arching his back, he moved his mouth down to attack his neck.
Harry had thought at the time it might be a good idea, hitting things for a while usually helped him focus. He wasn’t so sure now.
Harry walked slowly into the astronomy tower and slid down the wall till he was sitting next to him.
He thought about him constantly, was hyper aware of his presence whenever they were in the same room, he had even cropped up in his dreams.
‘Sixth year huh?’ Draco said with a grin.
Without a word of explanation Draco had begun to untie Harry’s tie with a small smirk, all the while keeping those startling grey eyes, that Harry loved so much, trained on his.
Some days the whispers and the gossiping were worse than others, although it often had some kind of discernible cause, like the day he and Ginny had broken up. She had expected him to be mad at her, but the complete lack of sadness or anger he felt had worried him more than her sexuality. It made sense now of course, he thought maybe his love of Ginny as a friend and his desire to be a part of the Weasley family had blinded him to the fact that it had never been true romantic love between the two of them.
‘hmph, maybe you stick to the defence spells and I’ll do the charms shall I?’
‘Potter, you know I don’t care, but please remember I have a school to run and students to teach. If you could scale down the dramatics just a bit, I would be grateful.’ And with that table she turned and strode away.
‘It’s not that, it just reminds me of The Trials, digs up old wounds.’ Draco replies
‘Malfoy’ He said, trying to catch the boy’s attention, from where he sat a few seats up ahead of Harry.
If he thought about it, it made sense, he just hadn’t thought Draco had come out with a game plan. Then again as Palmore had said, he was incredibly smart. But that wasn’t what he first thought about
‘Of course we are, doesn’t matter to us, does it?’ Ron said, looking to Hermione.
They had begun to write lines but a few minutes in McGonagall had excused herself from the room to deal with a ‘student issue’ and had left with the instruction that she expected them to continue with their work without distraction. This was accompanied with a rather pointed look.
‘No need.’ Said a voice behind him and Narcissa poured another cup of coffee and slid it to him as he sat down next to Harry.
Malfoy gave him a measuring look.
‘Cough up ‘Mione.’ He said still grinning widely.
‘Did I ever tell you how much I like your new hair?’ Harry asked.
‘Call me Draco.’
He swung his legs over the side of the bed, grabbed his glasses and put them on as he raced down the stairs to the common room.  Ron and Hermione were sat in front of the common room fire, Ron’s head in Hermione’s lap with his eyes closed as she read her book, one hand absently playing with his orange hair, the firelight making them both look calm and peaceful. They were alone in the common room but Harry thought they probably wouldn’t have even noticed if it was packed, completely at peace in each other’s presence.
Despite the soft crooning from the wireless, the hot water, the empty changing room something niggled at the back of Harry’s mind, the vague sense that something wasn’t right that stopped him from fully relaxing. He tried to distract himself hoping it was the action of showering in a potentially public place but he knew it wasn’t that.
‘Subtly has never been my strong suit.’ Came the quick response.
Whilst Harry had logically known they would be fine about it, it was immediately a weight off his mind.
‘How very Slytherin of you.’ Harry said, standing up and grabbing Draco’s hand to pull him up too. ‘Let’s go get some food, ever seen the Hogwarts kitchens?’
Unlike the other houses they had gone all out. Usually houses would supply a table of drinks and snacks, music for dancing and occasionally have some cards or some Knick knacks for some game or other they wanted to play. The Slytherins however had made everything Halloween themed, from the orange, black, purple and green streamers everywhere to the carved jack-o-lanterns bobbing around the room providing flickering candlelight. As Harry stepped towards the table laden with food and drink, grabbing butterbeers for himself and his friends he noticed the apple bobbing that Lavender and Pavarti were doing and Seamus and Dean at a pumpkin carving station, the latter laughing uproariously as the former carved a very large dick into his pumpkin.
Harry watched him move to the beat of the music and Draco kept his eyes on Harry the whole time, teasing him, grey eyes alive and challenging him.
Harry growled and grabbed the front of Malfoy’s shirt, placing a foot on his chest and pushing until Malfoy was tipping over, slamming down onto the mat next to him. Harry was very satisfied at the gasp Malfoy made as he hit the mat, winded.
‘Don’t give me that look Harry, we knew you were dating someone, especially after you kept sneaking away from the Burrow over Christmas and we guessed it might be a Slytherin because you didn’t tell us about it, we just didn’t know which Slytherin it was. I thought it was Blaise.’
When he stood again Harry saw, with some small satisfaction, that he had split Malfoy’s lip. He traced the small gash with his tongue and Harry couldn’t stop his eyes from following the motion.
Harry disentangled himself from Malfoy and set about redressing himself.
‘Don’t you want...’ Harry began but he was cut off.
‘I’m not getting fired from the ministry for walking around topless just because you enjoy it.’ Harry said with a chuckle as he pulled his t-shirt over his head.
‘I don’t trust you is all.’ Harry shot back, flushing bright red. Clearly, he was not as subtle as he thought.
‘Draco?’
As Draco jerked him off with one hand, he felt the other gently moving over his chest, scratching him ever so slightly, playing with his nipples.
As Draco was finishing knotting his tie Harry noticed that the collar of his shirt was open just enough to see a purpling bruise on his neck that Harry was pretty sure he was responsible for. He wouldn’t have put it past Draco to decide to come out now and come up with this whole performance just because he couldn’t be bothered to explain away a hickey.
‘Sure.’ Harry said before grabbing his bag and ducking out of the room.
Harry narrowed his eyes at the both of them.
‘Yeah well you provided me with lots of it.’ Harry gasped from behind.
Malfoy moaned; forehead pressed against his as he watched Harry work both of them over.
The way Malfoy spoke to Harry and the way he acted around him had the same charge it had always had, created the same energy in Harry that it always had, but now that the anger and the violence had gone out of it, it felt completely different. He felt almost magnetised to the boy standing in front of him, sleeves rolled up, tattoo on full display.
‘I really don’t give a toss about what the daily prophet wants to print.’
Sweat shined on his body and Harry thought the sight of him writhing underneath him, panting and moaning in pleasure might have been one of the most beautiful things he’d ever seen.
‘No I want to take a shower, I don’t want to have to walk up to the castle like this,’ He said, gesturing down to himself. Over the course of the training session he had executed a poorly timed dive that had resulted in him coming off his broom and skidding into the muddy pitch. He had been covered head to toe in muck. ‘Don’t wait up for me.’ He added.
‘Yeah well it was a rough time.’ Harry said
It was one night when Harry realised that yet again he was unconsciously searching for Draco’s dot on the Marauders Map that he fell back onto his bed and threw his glasses off scrubbing at his eyes.
‘Fucking hell.’ Draco murmured and Harry laughed, turning to look sideways at Draco as Draco did the same.
‘Yes well I was expecting to get some attention this morning,’ Draco said in a playfully sulky voice, but then something shifted in his tone, ‘I worried when I woke up and you were gone.’ Draco said quietly, not quite meeting Harry’s gaze.
‘Oh, come on Potter, I catch you staring at me all the time.’ Malfoy said, smiling down at him.
‘More difficult to do that when I’m actually fighting you again.’ Draco said, but there was nothing malicious in his voice, in fact he sounded more teasing.
‘Yes, to a muggle family ironically, it took an entire ministry department to come in and remove all the magic surrounding the house to make it safe. It seemed odd to stay in that entire house just for me.’
The classes they shared were never an opportunity to talk, either sat too far away or not getting paired up.
‘Course you can, you idiot.’ Ron said eyes closing again, but he opened them when Hermione flicked his forehead.
For that reason he had almost jumped out of his skin when he had turned to his left and seen the person he had just been thinking about sitting on the chair a few away from his.
His head fell back onto Draco’s shoulder, his eyes fluttering shut as he focused only on the sensation of Draco touching him.
Getting the time and privacy needed to adequately fuck Draco’s brains out was not exactly as easy at school as it had been in Draco’s apartment over the course of the Christmas holidays and so they had taken to late night rendezvous around the school that while very satisfactory, did have the habit of tiring Harry out.
‘I think you had a lack of choice,’ Harry said, ‘I think we’re both teenagers who should never have had to make the decisions we made, to even be in the situations we were in.’
‘I thought you liked a bad boy Potter.’ He said, a lightness coming back into his tone, as a small smirk twitched at his lips.
Harry suddenly realised it was a very dumb thing to have said.
‘Deal.’
‘Now’s not the time to be smug.’ Draco muttered as Harry rose to his feet again, kissing his way along Draco’s neck till he got to his mouth.
Harry ducked under the arm that was swung at him, coming up low and continuing to circle slowly in a defensive stance.
The changing rooms were equipped with showers but they weren’t often used due to the fact that there were no stalls or partitions, if you wanted to shower you had to do it in front of anyone in the changing room.
He sped up as he heard Malfoy’s breathing increase and soon they were both panting and gasping, pressing kisses into whatever skin they could reach.
They walked back up to the castle in companionable silence and Harry thought about how much he enjoyed the simple act of holding Draco’s hand, how right and easy it all felt.
Now that he was no longer panicking about being attacked by revenge-hungry maniacs he was suddenly very aware that there was a man stood behind him in the shower and he was naked.
He didn’t answer, forcing Harry to look back at him. Malfoy only tilted his head with that wicked smile.
‘Yeah not too bad at all.’ Draco said with a grin. And with that he kissed Harry’s cheek, grabbed his bag and headed to meet the others.
Harry grit his teeth, hating the implication on Draco’s behalf, but Draco was his usual charming self.
‘Can we just agree to get along,’ It felt weird to say the words to the back of his head and Harry felt that old irritation at the git as the other boy continued to write on his price of parchment. ‘I don’t care if it means we just stay out of each other’s way or whatever I can’t be bothered to hate you anymore.’
With his messed-up hair, panting and wicked smile, he looked like someone who had just been fucked seven ways to heaven, not been beaten in a fight.
He turned back to Smith.
To Harry’s amazement Ron was grinning delightedly as Draco pulled a rack of toast his way and began to butter slices.
Smith had the decency to look worried as Harry advanced on him, wand still in hand.
Harry couldn’t stop the snort that came out. There always seemed to be one group of students trailing him around the castle and on occasion he has taken to ducking under the cloak to avoid them.
Ron was less successful and laughed loudly until even Hermione was smiling.
Harry laughed and rose up on his elbows to look at Malfoy.
Harry woke before Draco did that next morning and after throwing on his boxers and a shirt he found over the back of a chair in Draco’s room he headed out into the kitchen.
Harry had gone over and over everything that had happened in the detention over and over in his head.
‘I’m sure I’ll find it in my heart to forgive you.’ Came the calm response.
‘Yes, damn it, yes.’ He said impatiently and then gasped when the hand began to stroke him up and down.
‘Yes sir’ Draco replied with that same teasing tone but did as he was told.
However, the air of untouchability that surrounded Harry certainly had its disadvantages too. One such example had come to light when in his new defence against the dark arts class, with its 13 students, he suddenly came up short without a partner. The class consisted of 2 Slytherins, 5 Gryffindors, 2 Hufflepuffs and 4 Ravenclaws and naturally, despite McGonagall’s best efforts towards interhouse unity the students paired up within their houses. Ron and Hermione had automatically looked to each other when their new teacher had called on them to form pairs but then immediately offered to work in a three, switching in and out with Harry.
He had been waiting on the corner to the club, watching the line of people waiting to get in when he heard a sigh behind him.
‘Yes Sir.’ Said Draco in a low voice and Harry tried to ignore the flare of heat in his stomach that the words caused.
‘And this?’ Draco asked as the other hand trailed lower, inching over the ridges of his muscle past his belly button.
‘Are these chairs bewitched?’ Harry asked.
‘I might have some little knick-knacks.’ Harry said as he began to rummage in his bag for the map and the cloak.
Harry tried his very best not to stare he really did but Draco wasn’t making it easy on him. They had decided after a few more late-night trysts around the castle that it would be difficult not seeing each other over the Christmas holidays and so it had seemed only reasonable that they meet up.
‘Your best friend just admitted something that must have been affecting him for a long time and that’s how you respond!’ She cried, ‘How long have you known?’ She asked as she turned to Harry again.
In one particular match however, one of the burlier recruits, Jackson, had managed to get Malfoy into a headlock, and as he had writhed around Malfoy’s shirt had risen up a bit, it wasn’t until Malfoy had had to tap out of the fight that Harry realised how much his breathing had sped up at the sight of Malfoys lithe body.
Blonde eyebrows quirked up in challenge and Harry gritted his teeth.
‘Well if you couldn’t beat me it would’ve ruined your rather impressive track record.’ Draco said, taking his wand back from Amelia Bones as she handed it to him and offering her a polite smile in return.
He looked around and his eyes widened as he saw Draco Malfoy strolling up the Gryffindor bench towards him, seemingly without a care in the world.
‘Yeah well my parents weren’t being threatened, everyone has a price,’ Harry said as he watched Draco twist the ring, ‘I made my decisions to protect the family I have just like you did.’
‘Malfoy.’ He blurted out, before his alcohol addled brain could stop him.
The parties had been started by the 8th year Hufflepuffs who, having taken McGonagall’s calls for interhouse unity to heart, had invited all the returning 8th year students to a party hosted in the room of requirement.
‘Oh well you know… the hair and…the tattoo and the… cheekbones.’ He gestured vaguely at Malfoy who had a small smirk playing across his lips. ‘Also, the whole bad boy thing.’ He finished lamely looking anywhere but at him.
‘About two minutes.’ Harry replied fighting to keep his face neutral at the absurdity of it all.
‘I’m very sorry mother but I completely forgot about lunch today, as you can probably tell I’m entertaining guests.’
Their kiss had certainly been the best one he’d had yet.
Harry decided it was time to change the subject.
‘Only if you call me Draco.’
‘Oh of course, the intrepid Gryffindor explorer knows where they are,’ He said in a mocking tone, but he sounded excited at the idea and his eyes were bright.
Despite having ended up in this detention for defending Malfoy everyone still expected them to be at each other’s throats.
‘Nah I must’ve I’ve always known I just didn’t realise until recently that something wasn’t adding up, it all just kind of clicked.’
‘Now what was all that about you getting some attention.’ Harry said as he rolled his hips and set about showing the other man just how much he didn’t want to leave.
‘And I once threw one of those badges at Ron’s head.’ He said. He didn’t know why he was telling Malfoy that other than out of some baffling desire to hear that laugh again. There was something missing from Malfoy’s grey eyes. A light that Harry had always expected to see whenever he and Malfoy were butting heads that Harry hadn’t seen since well before the war.
It had been somewhat satisfying to see Ron and Hermione hate the attention he had always retrieved and he had tried not to take too much pleasure in telling them to ‘just ignore it’ as they had always told him.
Harry kissed him, fast and short and sweet, once again surprising Draco
He shot forward with a succession of three jabs that Harry blocked, but the movement unbalanced him and Malfoy managed to grab him and flip him over his hip, throwing Harry onto his back.
‘What?’
Narcissa left after breakfast, having rescheduled their luncheon and she kissed them both on the cheeks before stepping into the fireplace and flooing back to her own home.
‘How have you been?’ Harry asked, not sure how to unpack what she had said, struggling to think of a way to start a conversation with a woman who had barely spoken to since she saved his life.
Ron and Hermione weren’t the only ones exchanging coins. Across the room money was being exchanged. Harry even thought he saw a silver sickle move between Professor Sprout and Professor McGonagall.
The two hands on his chest were splayed, and Draco gradually dragged one of them further up over Harry’s pecs.
There was something not quite right about the way Draco looked that Harry could not put his finger on. His robes were on, billowing behind him as he walked, his uniform was pristine as ever, his hair beautifully mussed. But there was definitely something missing.
‘Do you still believe in blood supremacy?’ Harry asked bluntly.
Malfoy gasped, the hands pinning him down loosened enough around his wrists for Harry to grab his shoulders and spin him onto his back until Harry was underneath him, an arm wrapped around his throat.
‘You are such a git.’ Draco said and then gasped when Harry ground his hips against Draco’s, letting him know he knew exactly what Draco wanted.
Later on Harry sat at the bar and continued trying not to stare. Draco had pulled him into the club and immediately pulled him towards the bar, managing to get them drinks very quickly by flirting shamelessly with the bartender and not even having the decency to look guilty when Harry raised his eyebrows at him.
Ron sat up.
‘Quite well, all things considered.’ She replied smoothly.
‘You actively defended me and my mother at The Trials. At best I wouldn’t have been able to come back here, at worst I would’ve been sent to Azkaban.
‘But of course, professor.’ Draco said innocently.
‘That was more than flirting.’ Harry grumbled, but he got his hand round Draco’s hard length and fished it out of his jeans, swallowing it down in one fluid motion.
‘But no, I agree with you on one thing Potter, I’m too tired to bother making badges or compose songs.’ Malfoy said as he turned back to his page.
Harry sat up onto his knees and pulled Malfoy into another kiss, before shifting into his lap, spitting roughly into his palm before wrapping it round both their pricks.
‘I don’t believe you.’ Malfoy whispered right into Harry’s ear, his hot breath tickling the shell.
‘Oh they wouldn’t fire you, they’d promote you.’ Malfoy muttered as he searched for his clothes as well and pulled them on.
Having settled into this routine Harry hadn’t realised as soon as one person wasn’t present he would find himself with a new partner. With the autumn in full swing and the number of cold and flu cases in the castle rising it had only been a matter of time. In this case it was Pansy Parkinson, one of the two Slytherins in their class, that had been ill and failed to show. Her usual partner, one such Draco Malfoy, was suddenly alone.
Harry smiled to himself.
‘Your hair, its longer and you don’t slick it back anymore, it suits you better.’
Draco grunted.
The grey eyes were empty and it actually frightened Harry, seeing them going from being so alive in the middle of their duelling to so dull, upsetting in a way that Harry couldn’t explain.
‘Well you could. You shouldn’t because they’re great but technically you could.’ Harry said, wondering if Malfoy was actually trying to encourage banter between them.
‘You haven’t forgotten that you have a boyfriend already I hope?’ Harry asked with a growl before he backed him against a wall, attacking his lips with his own for a moment before dropping to his knees in front of him.
Harry was too, he could feel the pressure building but he wanted Draco to come first so he wrapped around Draco’s straining cock and began to jerk him off. Draco’s back arched again at the sudden pressure on the sensitive skin and soon he was gasping and quivering underneath him as he came hard over his stomach.
‘Merlin, another one.’ Ron said falling back into Hermione’s lap.
Harry tried to think of something to say but couldn’t come up with anything, his brain still spinning far too fast to make sense of anything that had just happened and instead waited for Draco to say something.
At the beginning he had been kind but firm that he needed time to ‘adjust’ and ‘get over Ginny’ and by the last he was irritable and embarrassed.
He turned off the shower, grabbed his towel up from one of the benches along with his wand and turned to face Draco again.
One-minute Harry would be laughing at Draco’s exasperation over Slughorn and the next Harry would be making Draco laugh at a well-timed innuendo, the kind he would never have thought he would be telling Draco. He was addicted to making Draco laugh though, it made his eyes dance.
‘You’re going to have to stop that if you want me to last much longer.’ Draco panted and Harry pulled off him with a self-satisfied smile.
‘Mmm hmm, they were all talking about it in the corridor, Harry Potter yet again standing up for Draco Malfoy, always bound to cause a buzz.’ He said quietly.
‘Good morning.’ Harry replied with a slightly sheepishly.
The blonde head was leant against the wall, eyes closed, breathing even.
‘That was fucking iconic’ She declared loudly, before whispering, ‘Heads up - McGonagall’s coming this way’ in his ear.
The next problem was Draco himself.
‘It’s very clever.’ Harry said, trying to hide his blush that had been caused by the insinuation that the chairs around the room were specifically so that couples could make out undetected.
That was certainly true.
Suddenly, before Harry could think, they were moving and their lips collided. Draco’s hands were in Harry’s hair pulling at the messy strands and his own were on Draco’s waist pulling him closer, holding on tight enough to bruise. Draco’s lips on his made his whole body burn with desire and Harry groaned loudly as his tongue danced with Draco’s, lips moving hard against each other’s. His hands slipped under Draco’s shirt and Draco climbed into Harry’s lap in response allowing Harry to wrap his arms all the way around Draco’s waist, arching his spine off the sofa with a gasp when Draco tugged on Harry’s hair. Harry nipped at his lip in retaliation and enjoyed the feeling of Draco shuddering from his ministrations.
Within a few minutes, they were both breathing heavy, clothing a mess from wandering hands, and grinding against each other shamelessly.
Draco said firmly, with a flick towards the hallway.
Harry sighed.  The pain had returned every few hours, waking him, and he had been glad to have the potion last night.
That made Draco smile, his eyes lighting up.  “Really?”
Harry gathered his courage.  “Um, can I kiss you?  I promise I’ll stop whenever you want, and then you can tie me up...”
He could feel the bed shifting as Draco got into a comfortable position.  He seemed to be kneeling quietly at Harry’s side.   It was a surprise when his lips touched Harry’s, a light touch that deepened.  Harry gasped against his lips when Draco’s hand wrapped around his cock.  He stroked it slowly, leaving Harry gasping and writhing against his bonds.
Harry nodded, moving closer.  “I liked that a lot too.  I think I want more of that.”
The bonds were looser this time, invisible strands that looped around Harry’s wrists and ankles, and attached to the four posts of the bed.  He was spread eagled on top of the covers, fully clothed, with Draco usually lying on top of him.
Shrugging a shoulder, Draco turned his face to look out to the high hedges that surrounded the grounds.  “Like it or not, we are both stuck here for the time being.”
That warm look made Harry smile back, chuckling. He jumped up. “Enough of that. How about a game of tag? You are ‘it’. Catch me if you can.”  He tapped Draco’s shoulder once.
until I get my robes on.”
“I’m grateful that she wants to remedy the situation now, but surely McGonagall has noticed that children from Knockturn weren’t getting letters. She was Deputy Headmistress long before we went to Hogwarts.”
be cooking. Or that I’m ungrateful for the company. I honestly am happy to have you, not only to help me with the overabundance of food, but also to express again how much I appreciate your speaking on behalf of my mother and me last spring. If you hadn’t done that, I probably wouldn’t have this—” Malfoy gestures towards his sitting room. “—or a second chance to… make something of myself.”
for a week?”
Scorpius rubs his eyes and falls back against his dad’s chest, making Draco grunt.
“I think I’d prefer to stay in Knockturn. Wait,” Draco says when Harry opens his mouth to speak, “let me tell you why, please. It isn’t because I don’t want to live with you, or because I dislike the idea of sharing your house, all right?”
I covered his arms with mine to show him I wasn’t angry. Looking across the water, I thought of all that lay beyond the sea—the Netherlands, then the grand cities on the Continent, and beyond that, the exotic, sun-baked countries that I’d only read about. Those were the places where I might still be able to work towards my dream of redemption, of accomplishment and respectability.
“And good thing they’re all witches and wizards. I imagine it would be rather obvious if they came back to the cave covered in mud and leaves,” Pansy laughs. “Although everyone probably knows what they were up to anyway.”
needs to burn off his energy in the garden for a little while,” Andromeda replies, tilting her head at Teddy, who’s pushing an entire buttered toast quarter into his mouth. “My goodness, that’s a big bite. Give it some chews before you swallow, dear.”
Draco trots down the stairs, wand in hand, then around the corner into the second floor corridor. He finds Mrs Allandale sitting on the floor near her door, the string bag beside her spilling out its contents onto the dusty floorboards.
I closed my eyes and tilted my head against the headboard of the bed. The room was silent while I tried to wrap my mind around what Harry had told me. An innocent children’s tale—albeit a grim one—turned out to be darker and more real than I ever could have imagined. Harry’s story felt like a fable that had come to life before my eyes, like an ancient creature awakening from a long sleep. I reached towards Harry, seeking out his other hand.
“I’m sorry,” he blurted. “I didn’t mean to, er, offend you by making it sound that way.”
Jerome nods knowingly. “Let’s hope that
“Ah, I see,” Mrs Allandale murmurs with a sympathetic smile. “Your mum’s not the only one, hmm?”
“Couldn’t you tell? Yes, it’s impossible for me to disobey. I think you can understand why I’d rather you didn’t do that.”
“Tell me now, please,” Draco says when the familiar weight of Harry’s arm rests around his shoulders.
“Not that. The entire week.” Harry gives in and pours himself a glass of whisky so he doesn’t have to look at Draco. “First, you push me away and make a point of telling me how happy you are with Astoria.”
He feels Draco’s weight lift off his chest slightly as he levers himself back onto his elbows.
He’s twenty-seven years old now and has what he can no longer deny is a crush that’s as hopeless as it is inappropriate. Which is a step down even from being chronically single, Harry thinks.
“I planned to right after I finished eating,” Harry retorts, immediately forgetting his determination to ignore England’s Number One Prat. “And I didn’t
Pansy looks ready to shoot down the idea, but changes her mind when Luna claps her hands and Greg looks more enthusiastic than he has all day. Draco merely shrugs and admits it
“Oh, don’t thank me. If circumstances were less dire, I’d just as soon share a room with a Blast-ended Skrewt as
. A bit of work and light and laughter to brighten it up, and it will be a different house, I promise.”
“There’ll always be a need for them, don’t worry.” Draco tilts his head back to look at the sky with a smile. “Though I’m sure they’d be touched by your concern for their livelihoods.”
is watching him—makes him lurch to his feet.
“Does she still live there?” Pansy asks, adjusting the silk scarf knotted around her head to hold her hair back.
“This isn’t your home either, Malfoy,” Harry points out acerbically.
Draco shifts closer. “That must have been a terrible shock. No wonder you came downstairs looking like you’d seen about fifty Boggarts. What a thing for Erwina to keep in her spare bedroom, even warded so tightly.”
“Yeah.” Harry isn’t planning to tell him any more than that, but then Malfoy raises a sceptical eyebrow. “I kissed Fleur’s cousin when he was visiting here last summer. Have you?”
“Oh, I haven’t been there in a long time,” Luna says enthusiastically. “My parents took me when I was younger. It was quite breathtaking.”
“What? What do you mean?” Harry demands. “I don’t want you to quit on my account.”
He was walking home, later than usual, after a stroll in the balmy spring evening. No sooner had he slipped through the entrance to Knockturn, hidden in a foul alleyway between two Muggle shops, than he heard shouts echoing down the Alley. The long-anticipated raid was taking place. Draco even guessed the building the Aurors had targeted: a shuttered shop with supposedly-empty flats above it that Knockturn residents whispered was a smuggling den.
“I wouldn’t have lasted long on a couple of hundred pounds, would I?” I said icily and pushed past him into the house.
I woke in the bed, too weak to open my eyes.
I’ll get a kitten to take with me next year.”
Draco gives him another penetrating look. “So should you,” he says after a moment.
“Sometimes,” Malfoy says. He looks uncomfortable with the idea. “It’s still very new to me, living like this.”
Every day, Harry feels the small ember of light within his chest warming him from the inside, breathed into life again by the moments of joy and desire reflected in Draco’s face, by the fierce pull of the thing that’s captured both of them.
tracked down Ms. Davies from Legal Aid when I was brought in for questioning last autumn,” he counters, raising his eyes to meet Potter’s with a pointed look.
, Potter, and it requires a great deal more care than yanking weeds out of the dirt.”
One thing in Draco’s future is certain: Harry Potter will never be a part of it.
When Hermione, Ron, and the rest of the Weasleys saw that Harry returned from New York much calmer and happier than when he’d left, they finally started to accept that Harry needs to do things at his own pace. That he has many years of grief and trauma to work through before he’ll be ready to decide on a career. Harry was able to enjoy being home much more after that, spending time with Teddy and exploring London the way he did New York. Even Hermione stopped mentioning application deadlines for training programmes and apprenticeships.
Harry ran a hand over my back and then my bicep while he considered my question.
“Another half hour of searching,” Greg proposes. “Then we’ll go back to the camp and tell Luna that we did our level best.”
“Unlike me.”
Pansy, Greg, and Luna are standing on the craggy stones at the pinnacle, admiring the view, when Harry and Draco finally catch up. The air is clear as a bell. A green patchwork of Muggle farmland stretches out in all directions, interrupted by areas of woodlands and the occasional scrub-covered hilltop. Further west, the high moorlands line the horizon, wild and desolate. It’s a view that’s worth the trek, without a doubt.
“Why is that?”
“Sorry we’re late. We took a wrong turn on the way,” Granger says, accepting a kiss on the cheek from Harry. “Hello, Draco.”
Pansy smirks at Draco and pointedly dips her head to nibble on Luna’s earlobe, making her giggle.
, he tells himself.
That’s all that Malfoy needs to hear to kiss him again. And it’s a good one this time, sending a thrill through Harry that makes his toes curl into the carpet. Malfoy’s still gripping his arms, and Harry isn’t sure what to do with his own hands. He tries putting one on Malfoy’s waist. The warmth that bleeds through the fabric from Malfoy’s body is almost as exhilarating as the press of his mouth, which is now fully engaged with Harry’s.
Sending an owl might be a better way to explain his actions, but there was no guarantee that Draco would read it once he realised who it was from. He could tear it up or throw it in his fireplace. Harry imagined Draco wading through his crowded sitting room to slam his window closed in order to block any more deliveries.
“Right, yeah.”
I didn’t hesitate to comply, but I couldn’t take my eyes off the little filly, who was flicking her ears now and lifting her head. Potter went behind the mare and made some concerned sounds while he examined her. He opened his satchel and took out a few vials and bottles.
“I’m tired of being afraid. You have no idea how exhausting it is. How humiliating,” Malfoy says.
“Yes, it was great. I can’t wait to go back,” Naia answers, shuffling back a small step. “Mum says to bring you to the kitchen. Dinner’s almost ready.”
It was only when he had turned into Diagon Alley that Harry realised that he had ended the conversation—perhaps his only opportunity to woo Draco—by complimenting not the object of his affections, but his snake.
They were waiting for Draco in front of his boarding house when he came home from work and demanded that he accompany them to the Ministry to answer some questions relating to a case. Draco could only nod, even though his heart felt like it would pound its way out of his chest. His last thought before one of the Aurors gripped his shoulder for Side-Along Apparition was that he hoped one of his neighbours witnessed the scene and would tell his landlord or Wharton. In case he doesn’t come back.
Draco wraps his arms around Harry’s neck and returns the kiss, savouring the softness of Harry’s lips before drawing back a little. He knows he could press Harry further about the Aurors in Knockturn, but letting the conversation slide into gentler waters is too tempting.
“A true hero,” Draco agrees with a wry smile. “But why weren’t the Muggles working in the shops cursed?”
,” Potter said, rounding on me.
“That one looks quite…
Luna and Greg take the lead, guiding them toward their destination with the help of a tattered Ordnance Survey map. They follow a brook until it’s nothing but a mere trickle in the hillside. After that, they rely on frequent
Goyle shrugs, then gestures for Harry to get back to work. Harry rolls his eyes as he reaches for his hammer. To think that he could be loafing around his flat instead of having the surreal experience of being bossed around by one of Malfoy’s former goons.
“Yeah, I remember,” Harry says quietly, looking away from Ginny. He’d rather not think about that time, to be honest. Those months when they barely touched each other anymore, even in a casual way, were painful. Harry felt terrible that he was a little relieved when she started staying at a teammate’s flat during the week. He knew the relationship was over long before she sat him down to tell him she was moving out, forcing him to admit aloud for the first time that things between them had withered away.
Draco sits up, looking into Harry’s eyes with a sombre expression. When he’s certain that Harry’s not upset, he turns and gets out of bed.
“Wait, how did you know that I can’t speak Parseltongue anymore?” he asked Luna.
Harry doesn’t seem to notice Draco’s brief shudder. He meets Draco halfway across the small room and laces their fingers together. Draco can barely stop himself from swaying forward, drawn by their bond as the sea is pulled by the moon.
“She was doing your job, without the paying clients or the curse breaking, saving the world one humidor at a time.”
“I… My family was on the wrong side of the war,” Draco says. He hates himself a little for glossing over the story, for not stating his own role explicitly, but he
“Harry has a
“I know. I didn’t want you to think you wouldn’t be welcome there.”
“Yes, I would like that.” Draco can feel a smile on his face as wide as the open sky. “I’d like that very much.”
“Where’s that? Sweet Merlin, please don’t say it’s with Granger and Weasley.”
“They
. In a good way.
Ah, that’s it. The garden of the Burrow, the summer before his fourth year at Hogwarts. The entire family was home. Harry met Bill and Charlie for the first time (Merlin, he was so stupid. It took him years to figure out why he couldn’t stop looking at them). Harry recalls the chatter about the Quidditch World Cup and his own amusement at the sight of Crookshanks chasing the garden gnomes. Despite his concern about Sirius and his scar hurting, Harry remembers being happy.
This kiss was so good, Harry just wanted to wrap his arms tight around Draco, and continue for hours.  He couldn’t, so he tried to relax and just enjoy it.  Enjoy Draco.
Draco scoffed.  “As that traitorous house elf made his little speech to Bellatrix, we snuck around behind you.  I tackled you right as the rest apparated,” he said with pride.  “My father grabbed both of us and moved us here.”
Draco’s hands went into his hair, combing through it with his fingers.  Occasionally getting a bit caught on a tangle and undoing it.  It was a wonderful feeling, having Draco almost petting him.  He had dug his hands into his hair before, even pulled on it sometimes, but never stroked through it.
“Oh shit,” Draco said, looking at his hands, “I forgot to unbind you.”
Both of Draco’s hands went in his hair, and he let out a small groan.
After a lot of touching, exploration and kissing, Harry had his hands on Draco’s ass as they shamelessly ground together.
The sex had been some of the best yet, so, so hot.  So intimate.  But then afterwards, not being able to do anything for Draco.  Had that ever happened before?  Harry thought back, and it hadn’t.
Draco let out a hard sigh.  “Yes.  I know it was stupid.  One-sided.  I had been lying to myself about my feelings for you for ages.  But I couldn’t in that moment.  Not anymore.”
“Fuck, Draco, yes,” Harry practically panted.
Draco was blinking hard, his eyes suspiciously shiny.  “I’m the lucky one.  I’ve made so many bad choices in my life.  I don’t deserve this.”
“Next you’ll be telling me we have to shower together because your wand is getting repaired,” Harry said, pushing those silky strands back to see Draco better.
“The Chosen One and the Deatheater,” Draco groaned.  “I can already see the headlines in the paper.
“Come on,” Harry cajoled.  “We are both stuck here and there’s not much to do.  Tell me, what did you do for fun?  With your friends?”
Draco shrugged. “Or you come up with some way to amuse me. Maybe run into the wards again.” He chuckled, his eyes warming at the memory.
He felt numb, the look on Draco’s face constantly flashing through his mind.  Pure betrayal.  He could hardly sleep, curled up on the dry leaves, half expecting to be discovered at any moment.
They got to the top of the stairs, and Draco said
Grabbing the wand, he pulled it out fast and pointed it at Draco, his stomach sinking like a stone, his hand trembling a bit.  “I’m so, so sorry.”
Harry sighed.  “Well, might as well put my notoriety to some good use.  Would you just take the job, Draco?”
Draco chuckled softly near his ear, and went back to kissing, licking and nibbling along Harry’s neck.  He seemed to be mapping out every part of his skin, noting what made Harry moan, pant and whimper.
Nodding, Draco finished up his portion. “Hopefully not all bad?”
But this was all new and a bit fragile.  He didn’t want to fuck things up when they were going so incredibly well.  He spelled his hair dry, slipped the shirt on, and went to the bedroom to finish dressing.
“Oh,” Harry said, not sure how to reply.  This was totally out of his experience.  Nervously, he sipped his wine, looking around.
Panicking a bit, Harry grabbed his own pyjamas and toiletries, and practically ran into the bathroom.  It felt good to have a locked door between them.  He washed his face, changed, and then stared into the mirror.  Why was he trying to delay going back into the bedroom?  It wasn’t the first time he’d been alone in one with Draco.
Seeming to sense this, Draco shifted, dancing close.  Allowing it.  Swaying together.
Grinning, Draco showed him what was in his hand.  A big jar of lube.  He set it on the beside table and crawled towards Harry.
Harry pushed the thought away.  The whole reason Draco had jumped on doing this was to make Harry somewhat feel like he had at the castle.  He could have the physical sensations, but it wasn’t so easy to replicate the dread Draco must have felt, waiting in such a helpless state to be discovered.  Knowing he would have to confess that Harry escaped to his father.
Talking his hand, Harry gave it a squeeze. “At first, it felt so forced.  So phony.  This whole trip.  You were being too nice.  Not Draco at all.”
Draco blinked up at him, a bit stunned.
And that, more than anything, made Harry want to cry.  He had missed Draco so much, felt awful about what he had done, and Draco wanted nothing to do with him except get his stupid wand back.
“I’m glad you like it,” grinned Draco.  “Now, how about we freshen up so we can go for a walk before supper?  I made reservations for 7.”
“Fine, fine.  So, it was just setting up this job that you did out of guilt, or pity, or some combination of the two,” Draco said, pinning Harry again with his gaze.  His anger had calmed down, but it was still there, ready to flare up at the slightest provocation.
Harry thought.
“OK, OK, you got me. You can let go now,” Harry said, pulling at Draco’s arm across his chest. He only breathed easier when Draco rolled away, lying panting on his back. “Um, normally it would be my turn to try to catch you now, but I’m feeling a bit tired. Can we go inside instead?”
Draco turned his head, reading the large red sign.  He looked a bit confused.
Harry shifted, letting his upper body rest against Draco’s as the kisses deepened.  He pushed a hand into his hair, savouring how the smooth strands felt.  Loved it when Draco’s arms came around him, stroking over his back.
He could only hope in time Draco would come to understand his actions.
Harry had a quick shower, styling his hair and shaving in record time.  He pulled on his underwear and hung up the towels.
He said it jokingly, but it made Draco still, and spin on his heel to face Harry.  “Yes,” he said, his face brightening.  “That’s perfect.  Lie down on the rug.”
Draco just waited, knowing Harry had more to say.  This confrontation had been a long time coming.  It was time to lay all the cards on the table.
But the man pushed him away with a hard shove, his face twisted into a sneer of distaste, and scrambled to his feet, racing away.
His rational side brought up point after point, but none of them totally settled him down.  Something was off.
Harry nodded.  “Yes, this first.  Need you so bad,” he moaned, kissing down his neck.  “But the house elves?”
“Oh fuck!  We better get up!” Draco said, looking at the muggle alarm clock on the bedside table.
Draco chuckled.  “Calm down.  It will be worth the wait, Harry.”
Unable to stop the smile spreading across his face, Harry stole a quick kiss.  “Go out in public together, as a couple.  Hold hands.  Talk about everything.  Go to restaurants or Quidditch matches, or drinking with our friends.”
Chuckling, Draco undid his bonds.  The cords had dug in, as Harry had been too far gone to realize he was yanking on them.  Tutting, he used his wand to do a simple healing spell.  “You might need something stronger.  This may bruise.”
“Worth it,” Harry said, grinning at Draco.  “Come here,” he said, tugging at his arm.  He felt the tingle of the scorgify spell, and knew Draco was cleaning them both up.
Draco mumbled a spell, and Harry felt a slight tingling over his skin, and his clothing rustled like it was caught in a breeze.  By the time he lowered his wand, Harry’s clothes were clean and unwrinkled, and he felt cleaner than he had been able to manage with the soap and water.
Harry was immediately on his feet.  This was more than he had hoped for.
At the door, he pushed Draco against the wall and kissed him hard, deeply.  Loving the way he returned the kiss, hungry and eager.  Their breathing was fast, hearts pounding, by the time Harry pulled back.
Harry thought of those years, trying to be invisible around his relatives.  If Aunt Petunia saw him, she gave him a task to do around the house.  If Dudley saw him, he would be teased or thumped on the head.  He hid in the garden under bushes, letting his imagination go as he watched the clouds.  Or escaped to hang out in parks.
“Next you will be asking for a quidditch broom and Celestina Warbeck’s latest record.  You are an enemy of the Dark Lord!  Of my family!”
Harry tried to relax, keep his breathing slow and steady.  Being unable to move was making this difficult, as it seemed to trigger his fight or flight reaction.  His heart was pounding and he could feel sweat beading on his forehead.
“No, no, it’s not that cold,” Harry resisted, not wanting to be apart.
“Now?” Draco asked, a bit incredulous.
“Yeah, I guess it was,” Harry chuckled lightly, and ran a hand through his hair.  Why was he saying so much?  Just pure boredom?
Harry kept thinking Draco would stop, roll off, and release Harry.  Call it a night.  But time after time, they cooled down, breathed normally, and Draco would kiss him again.  It was almost embarrassing how quickly Harry became a panting, sensitized mess, pressing upwards to rub against Draco, turning his face to kiss along Draco’s jaw.  Wanting to taste his skin, feel his light whiskers rasp against his lips.
Draco followed Harry down the stairs, neither of them wanting this night to end.
Harry just knew it.  But he felt to need to push on.
He was so focused, so lost in the moment, it was a bit shocking when Draco’s grip loosened, and he pulled away.  Harry looked up, confused.  Draco was still breathing hard, his eyes a bit wild, his face flushed.  “I’m close,” he said roughly.
Sighing, Draco pulled Harry’s hands away. “I know.  And I know you are basically a good guy, never hurting people if you can prevent it.  I was mad at you for a while, hurt, but I know you had to do it.”
Even though Harry knew he was teasing, Harry had to push down the jealous thoughts that sprang up at the mental image of Draco with another man.  “Um, yeah,” he mumbled, a bit distracted.  “Maybe you should immobilize me.  Give me a taste of my own medicine.”
“How can an interview be suspiciously good?” Harry asked mildly.
But Draco wasn’t doing more.  He had pushed Harry’s jeans down, his shirt up, leaving him exposed.  A flick of his wand freed his wrists.  Harry peered at him from under his heavy lids, still breathing hard.
The room was a lot darker, and a quick glance at the windows showed that Draco had pulled the thick curtains shut.  But that wasn’t all he had done.  There were a bunch of candles burning on each of the nightstands, giving off the scent of vanilla.  The covers on the bed were folded back invitingly.
By the time Draco came down with his lunch tray, Harry’s hair was mostly dry.  “What, no picnic today?”  He tried to go for a friendly tone.
“Well, you know that Olivia, Mrs. Redd, she’s muggle-born, right?”
“If you move into Grimmald Place,” Harry counter offered, upping the ante.
Draco shifted away, pushing Harry on to his back and climbing on top of him.  It seemed to work best for him like this, able to control the speed and the angle.  Harry loved watching him, stroking his cock, wanting to see him cum.
Draco scoffed, passing the dish to Harry. “We went to the same school for six years, Potter. You think I could avoid noticing the way you stuffed your face every time it was served?”
Pure instinct lead him to a plain wooden box.  The diadem was there, a large blue gemstone making up the body of the Ravenclaw eagle.
His response had Draco narrowing his eyes, a bit surprised.  “I seem to recall you enjoying yourself.  Or were all those orgasms faked somehow?”
Nodding, Harry was just glad Draco was talking to him.  “We have been laughing together, having fun.  I am just feeling more drawn to you lately.  Surely you notice how your magic affects me every time.”
“You told your father that we...” Harry said, clearly surprised.
Without the attack from Voldemort when he was a baby, would his parents have been like that?  Would he have been the only child, pampered by his loving parents?  Would they have proudly seen him off on the train, and come to his matches?
After rinsing it out, Harry did the same for Draco.  His hair needed much less product, and a lighter touch.  By the time the suds were gone, Harry just needed more.  He pushed Draco against the shower wall, his kiss deep and hungry.   Wet hands moved all over slick bodies, exploring.
Harry barely had a chance to get their bearings when they got out of the cab, Draco taking his hand and almost running through the people milling about.  He was yanking tickets out of the inner pocket of his suit jacket, and passing them to a man in a uniform.
This story was getting better and better.  Harry waved for him to continue.
Harry scoffed at that. “You have a wand, I don’t. Hardly a fair battle.”
Trying not to chuckle, Harry passed him the rock he was about to throw.  “A good first try.  But you need to look for flat stones about the size of your palm, like this.  Find a few, and then I’ll show you how to throw them.”
Draco gave him an eye roll, but he was also smiling.  “Fine.  Goodbye, Potter.”
Had Lucius suspected anything?  Did he accept it as just an escape, or had Draco revealed that more had happened?  Would he think less of Draco for being gay?
Harry just nodded eagerly, clasping Draco’s hand tightly and apparating them right to his bedroom.  He didn’t do it often in his house, but it was useful in times like this.
And removing the kinky side of things had them in bed together, fully dressed and not even kissing each other goodnight.  That said a lot about Draco.  Without the kinky element there, he had much less interest in sex with Harry.
“So, you aren’t sorry for kissing me, you are just sorry for kissing me if I didn’t want it?” Draco asked, his eyebrows raised in disbelief.
They took their time, Harry easing in really slowly.  Eventually, he stayed mostly still, with Draco rocking back against him.  He cupped his lubed hand around his cock, and soon Draco was moving faster and faster.
“Put your hands through the bars,” Draco ordered, his wand out.
Harry gathered his nerve, and sunk to his knees.  He pushed Draco’s clothes out of the way, finding him fully hard.  Perfect.  He leaned forward, kissing the tip.
The thought had him burrowing his face into his pillow, trying not to get emotional.  To lose it.  Feeling so sad and lonely.  This was just a sham.  He would make an excuse tomorrow and go back home.  Get away.  He couldn’t take another day of this farce.
Harry couldn’t help but smirk at his disgruntled expression, and giving him a kiss.  “Well, they got some stuff right, but a hell of a lot wrong.”
Draco dropped on to the sofa, his face turned away as he took in what Harry had said.
There were no windows in his cell, but there must have been a few nearby, letting in enough light for his eyes to take in his surroundings.  The cell was about eight feet square, with a bed along one wall.  There was a small sink and toilet in one corner.  Harry cringed at the lack of privacy.  It was cold but not that uncomfortable.
Switching spots involved their wet bodies brushing.  Even after everything they had done together, Harry still savoured it.  He tipped his head back, closing his eyes to wet his hair thoroughly.   He turned to face the wall, his back now to Draco.
The basket seemed to contain far too much food. Draco pulled out all sorts of tasty items, and handed Harry a plate. He seemed amused when Harry piled it high.
Harry stood, and slowly walked closer to Draco.  His heart was pounding in his chest, but he had to do this.  He stopped behind Draco, and laid a hand on his shoulder lightly.
Draco chuckled.  He pushed a tray of food through the gap at the base of the door.  Harry could sense a stasis charm over it, keeping things at the correct temperature.  He felt a pang of hunger now that his head didn’t ache as much.
The pond was in an area that sloped down gradually from the smooth lawn, and was surrounded by bushes and slim trees.  Looking through the foliage, he could see the glint of water.  As they stepped into the copse, he could see it was a fairly good size.  The shadows from the surrounding greenery didn’t cover the whole smooth surface of the water, and the spring sunshine allowed him to see the jade green tint of the water.
Draco nodded, closing his eyes.  He seemed to be holding his breath.
Harry sighed and stared up at the clouds. Anger burned hot for a few minutes, then faded. The warm sun and full belly were very soporific, and he drifted off as well.
It ended quickly when Draco stepped back.  “Goodnight, Potter,” he said before sweeping out the door to apparate home.
“You made good choices too, Draco.  Hard choices.  Like when you didn’t identify me at the Manor.”
Draco pulled away then, taking a step back.  He was breathing hard, his face flushed, his eyes dark.  Harry was sure he looked pretty much the same.  Destroyed.
Harry stood up slowly, rolling his shoulders.  He was still a bit stiff.  He held his hand out to Draco, and was happy when he took it and allowed Harry to pull him upright.  “Next time, let’s do that on the sofa.”  Or on a bed, he thought to himself.
Harry had to school his face from appearing shocked.  Bellatrix was still holding him close, so he concentrated hard  to keep his body loose.  But inside he was confused.  Why?  Why?? Why was Draco lying?  To his own family?  It made no sense.
Feeling a bit foolish, Harry picked out a long, thick blade of grass. “Um, pick one like this,” he said softly, showing it to Draco.
“Well, I had help,” Draco said, looking a bit embarrassed.
“You know it’s not that,” Harry said, meeting his icy blue-grey eyes.
Harry rolled over on the bed, his eyes heavy from lack of sleep, and was grateful  for the dim light of the cell.  Draco looked normal, picking up Harry’s barely touched tray from the previous night.  When Harry didn’t reply, he gave a frustrated huff and left, leaving him in peace.
“Malfoy,” Harry said back, before pulling away and slipping out into the night.
Draco pushed a hand downwards, into Harry’s loose jeans.  He pressed firmly against his erection, the tight material of his underwear all that was separating them.  He was moaning too, moving against Harry’s ass.  Harry felt him freeze, and then groan, shuddering against his back.  It set Harry off too, his eyes squeezed tight as he pressed into Draco’s hand.
Draco froze underneath him, his eyes wide, his face going pale.  “You aren’t...,” he stammered, barely getting the words out, “you wouldn’t...”
Draco looked skeptical, so with a sigh, Harry picked up the receiver on the phone and dialled the front desk.  He told one of the staff about the late check out and hung up.  “There.  As much time as we want.”
“I will bring down your dinner in about an hour,” Draco said softly before leaving.
“Oh no, I made a mess.  And you don’t have your wand handy,” Harry said with fake shock.
A minute or two later, Draco was pushing him on to a sofa and climbing over him.  “Brunch can wait.  Stasis charm...”
He had started a seduction at the castle.  But both of them had been caught up in it.  Captivated.  He wanted to continue it now, let them both get to know each other.  Date, like a normal couple.  He didn’t want to rush this, finally having the time to give a deeper relationship a chance.
The worst thing was the silence.  No other people in this dungeon.
Harry put the tray in the floor, laughing.  “Want me to clean up this mess?”
“Mmmm kinky,” Harry said softly as he passed Draco.  He heard him gasp, so he knew he had heard it.  Or maybe he had, but it had been too soft for Draco to be sure what he said.  That was what Harry had wanted.
“Couldn’t we just scorgify-“
“Different how?”
“For the official engagement.  And married a year later,” Draco said with a decisive nod.
Harry completely got that.  There were so many unasked questions between them.  He started with the main one.  The one that still stuck in his mind all these weeks later, when he had gone over things again and again.  “Why didn’t you tell her?  Bellatrix.”
“Um, well, maybe a rustic cabin in the woods with a big fireplace.  Or a modern room in a boutique hotel.  Eating out at unusual restaurants.”
His hand moved into his hair, probing at the swollen lump that was still tender under his light touch.  It felt hot, pounding with its own separate heartbeat, pangs of agony splitting through his skull.
Harry could have sworn he felt Draco licking his skin, and that was the final straw.  He shook, panting and gasping in pleasure.  Making a mess and not caring at all.  He sunk into the mattress, completely drained.
Harry felt a surge of feelings at seeing Draco, a confusing mess of them.  Excitement, his heart pounding a bit faster, wondering why he was there, and what he wanted.  Attraction, as Draco looked very good in a teal dress shirt and black jeans.  But also an urge to avoid him, make his excuses, and leave.
Collapsed together, they slowly recovered.  Harry traced lazy patterns over the sweat damp skin of Draco’s smooth back with his clean hand.  “You totally seduced me.”
“Wanna shag?” Harry said, smirking, and kissed Draco again just because he could.
“It’s too nice a day to stay inside,” Draco said quickly, not quite meeting Harry’s eyes. He took out a blanket and started spreading it out, and Harry got over his shock to help him.
Sighing, Harry lowered himself, lettting his head rest against the pillow and trying to settle into a comfortable position.  “Ok, Draco.”
“How about March 15?”
Draco was just as competitive though, and leaped at Harry, arms spread wide, tackling him from behind. They both landed hard, the thick grass the only thing that prevented bones from breaking. It still knocked the breath out of both of them, and left them a bit stunned.
