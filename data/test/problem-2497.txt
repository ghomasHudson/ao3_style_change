I wanted to sigh out of relief but then I saw the rest of the ward. There was blood dripping down the wall and hanging in the doorway of the nurses’ room was Mary. She seemed to be dead for some time. The rope around her neck was black and she was so pale, even paler than me. Her Body didn’t move at all except the slight swinging in a breeze. It was so cold. I shivered and looked around further. All the doors from the rooms were closed and I couldn’t here a noise except the dripping of the blood from the wall when it hit the floor. I didn’t know what to do and there was a lump forming inside my throat. Then suddenly Itward looked around the corner of an open door that wasn’t opened before.
It seemed to work. A small smile appeared on his pale lips. “A cupboard? I think I got a few things wrong about your childhood.” He said still smiling the bite from our time at school still not present. Was this even the Draco Malfoy I met at Hogwarts? I didn’t really think so. We were still looking and smiling at each other when Mary approached us. “Hey, you two sorry to interrupt but your family is here Harry.” She said smiling at us. I threw one last glance at Draco before standing up. He smiled at me one last time before his gaze swayed over to the Pond again. “Ill see you at group therapy Harry.” He said. I smiled at him even though he couldn’t see it and turned to Mary who was watching us interact, smiling. “Where do I meet them?” I asked her and she led me to a room I wasn’t in before.
I heard healer Atkinson tell her current students through the door and took a steeling breath. Everything would be fine. My fingers stroked lightly over the bandage that covered my eyes. Everything was fine. The door opened. I heard people walking into the room footsteps too close together and muffled to count. “Hello Draco dear. Are you ready to answer some questions?” At my nod, she gave her students the okay to start. There was a shy pause but then the first questions came. “Draco...can we tell you Draco?” I nodded again. “Ok...Do you know how long you have the syndrome now? I thought only children got it.” “I don’t know it’s hard to recall anything from my childhood really. Up until I turned 11 everything’s blurry or black and then there is just school and the war.” I answered as best as i could. I could hear some of the students shift uncomfortably at the mention of the war but i didn’t really care. “...What creatures do you see? I mean when you can see.” “I see the Kamalas mostly. Itward comes sometimes but that’s a rare occasion. He is really busy these days.” “are they scary? Is it really that bad that you...tried to kill yourself?” You could practically feel the tension in the room. They were uncomfortable asking things like this. “I didn’t really try to kill myself I just...needed a moment of silence...of not seeing them...” I tried to explain. “They are not scary anymore but it’s horrible seeing them knowing people don’t believe you because they can’t see these things. They can’t even imagine what it’s like and that means they can’t feel real empathy. It’s...bone crushing...but I can live with it most of the time.” “Does Itward talk about the other realms? Can you go there? Do you...know Fran?”
‘Are you on patrol right now, Potter?’ he asks Harry.
There is a glowing constellation of stars hanging on the wall beside Harry’s bed. It casts a pale light over the bedside dresser, where a photograph of Harry, Draco and Teddy sits angled towards the pillows. Harry will never admit that, on difficult nights, he’s fallen asleep with it clutched in his hands.
(Harry’s laughter, brilliant and golden as it echoes through Draco’s living room over the tinny Christmas music from the wireless -
They’re having tea in the conservatory one sunny Autumn day, when Malfoy’s potion wears off and his hands start shaking so violently, he has to give up on his tea. Harry hates the way Malfoy’s expression changes, the way his eyes shutter and his body curls in on itself, as though remembering the agony of the curses that left such lasting damage.
‘Are those
Some days he trips up, and the happiness dissolves like a lump of salt in a vast lake. He grasps for it but comes away with nothing but empty hands and a savage burning in his lungs.
Harry glances up at Malfoy. ‘It still hurts?’
Harry gets a house in the Highlands, on the other side of the Forbidden Forest, the core of the cottage placed squarely over thrumming ley lines. Some mornings he wakes to Draco lying next to him, his sharp features still soft in slumber, and he has enough time before breakfast to make them both coffees. Other mornings, he wakes to a book of poetry laid open on the pillowcase, a page marked with a sprig of dried lavender.
Harry presses his lips into a thin line. He’d expected as much when he sat down to talk to the Senior Auror.
‘Was it a rough day?’ Draco asks him softly. His voice vibrates through the places where their bodies are in contact.
Blaise steps in through the door with one smooth, elegant motion. He presses the wine into Narcissa’s hand. ‘Mother’s current beau has a fantastic vineyard in Argentina,’ he explains. ‘One of his very few redeeming qualities - but you know how Mother is. Brilliant taste in clothing. Terrible taste in men.’
‘You don’t think I feel the same?’ Draco asks. He laughs, the sound strangling in his throat like a sob. ‘Harry. I have been in love with you from the moment you stole my wand in the Manor.’

. He comes alive here in a way that makes Harry’s heart hurt, but in a good way.
looking for him. His absence should be a blessing on the universe, a dark smudge wiped from a flawless canvas. ‘He hates me.’
Malfoy’s letter finally arrives on the day that Harry qualifies as an Auror. It comes with a box of chocolates, wrapped up with red and gold ribbons and with a card that reads:
Draco flips over the page on the ledger and finds it exactly where he expects it to be -
‘How good is your potions knowledge?’ Draco asks Stephen, flicking open the binder.
‘How very ominous of you,’ Malfoy remarks. ‘You wanted three travel-sized bottles of Dittany, yes?’
the same as that quiet, subdued hum that he heard in Narcissa’s wall. It’s been driving him insane. He’s slept a total of three hours, napping sporadically whenever his headache gets blinding.
And she stands up, nods once at Hermione, and walks briskly out of the courtroom. The door slams behind her with considerable force.
‘What’s up?’ Harry asks.
Harry squeezes his eyes shut. He’s got no excuse, talking to Neville like that, but he’s brittle from the dry rot inside of him. It takes almost nothing to make him turn into something ugly and angry and resentful.
‘Merlin. Christ.’ Harry struggles to his feet. ‘That’s bloody genius, George. Where do we start?’
Harry rolls his eyes. ‘It’s chocolate, obviously,’ he replies. ‘Eat. It’ll make you feel better.’
Harry tries not to breathe a sigh of relief. It won’t do to have her knock an Auror out cold, no matter how deserving of it he might be.
Malfoy tilts his head slightly as he studies Harry carefully. His eyes are so pale they might have no colour at all.  ‘You are?’
Lucius flies back against the wall. The mortar cracks from the impact, his body making a satisfying crunch before he slides to the floor, unconscious.
Acquafredda narrows his eyes almost imperceptibly. ‘Of course, Professor,’ he replies. ‘I am paid very well to assist Master Malfoy and his family, which, as I understand it, includes you.’ He rises from his seat, sending the rest of the ledgers back to their place with another wave of his wand. ‘I will be in the next room with my clients. Please, feel free to use my study.’
‘I’ll find him,’ Harry says, because that’s how they are, him and Draco, Draco and him. ‘I always do.’
I've been so tired recently I end up writing bullet points like EMOTION HERE and MAYBE THEY KISS GOD I NEED SLEEP. Why do I have a day job? I should just sit at home and write fic all day.
‘Fine!’ Harry replies. ‘Perfectly fine.’ He kicks Neville’s shin under the table and makes the Herbology professor spill the almond-free salad down the front of his robes.
it, actually, because he can’t even see the stupid thing).
He fights against the weight of drowsiness. ‘You have to know-’ he manages to say. ‘I have to tell you-’ he breaks off coughing.
Harry turns in his seat to look at Ron, raising his eyebrows in a silent question.
‘I know there’s been this… something between us for a while,’ Harry says, frowning. He’s stumbling over his own words, but if he stops now, he’ll lose momentum and courage and then he’ll never get it out. ‘But I’m not expecting anything from you. It’s okay if you- if you don’t feel quite the same.’
Harry winces.
Draco sighs, closing his eyes momentarily. ‘I see that you still aren’t above conducting diagnoses without your patient’s consent,’ he says, but it lacks bite.
A kind euphemism for,
Harry recalls the chalky smell of crumbling brick and the overlapping stench of his own coagulating blood. He remembers the dark, and the horrible thought that he might never see his loved ones again, that he would die the same way he did in the Forbidden Forest - alone, and scared.
George hurries over to them, grinning broadly. ‘I’ve got it!’ he announces. ‘We’ve been coming at all wrong.’ He waves his copy of the manual at them both. ‘You don’t
‘You’re drunk, Potter,’ Draco grins, catching the olive between his teeth and pulling it off the toothpick in one smooth motion.
Blaise makes a gesture with his hand that falls in tandem with the tilt of his head, as though to say,
Proudfoot, apparently remembering the same incident, turns a delicate shade of puce. He coughs and shifts his weight from foot to foot. ‘That was an honest mistake, Potter.’
So why isn’t he better yet?
Harry stumbles across the Room of Hidden Things during one of his late-night shifts walking round the castle.
Harry’s partner leans back in her chair, a fat case file balanced on her knees as she props her feet up on her desk. One of her feet is wrapped in a cast to keep its shape steady while the bones grow back. She was hit with a particularly nasty marrow-eating curse a few days back, and Harry ended up removing all the bones in her leg in a desperate attempt to stop the curse from spreading.
Or at least, he was supposed to be. He’s supposed to be sneering, congratulating himself for a victory in the name of the Dark Lord.
Draco stumbles backward as though about to drop into a dead faint. In a rush, Daphne steps forward and enfolds him in her arms protectively.
Harry almost believes her.
Draco twists his head so he can muffle his guffaws in Harry’s shoulder.
‘What is it,
Harry sighs. ‘I’m fine,’ he says. ‘Seriously.’
Ron’s eyebrows shoot up. ‘Oh!’ he cries. ‘Yes!’ He claps his hands and laughs. ‘Oh, why didn’t we think of it before?’
Harry managed to make it through an hour of the trial before he finally snapped.
; shaking hands clenched into fists, singe-marks on old floorboards; and afterwards, Harry’s wiry body leaning into Draco’s, his voice muffled by the lapel of Draco’s coat;
He shakes his head once, then twice, and then looks at Harry pleadingly. ‘Merlin’s beard,’ he utters. ‘Potter, I - I am truly sorry. I had no idea.’
Harry reaches out for him, still fuzzy as he comes slowly awake, and Draco sets aside his book to thread their fingers together.
‘So, Harry,’ she says with a very
The Aurors raid Draco’s office on what, by all accounts, should be a happy day. It is a mild, sunny afternoon in late July, and there are roses blooming in Draco’s garden. They confiscate all his expensive, rare ingredients. They tear apart his office, confiscate all his ledgers and books and recipes. They take his cauldron - the one Goldren gave to him, the one made from the shimmering inside of a meteorite.
, Daphne would say, rolling her eyes, but Harry knows better. He can recognise the way Stephen looks at Astoria. It is the same species of creature that inhabits Harry’s heart.
There’s a soft, distant pop, and then footsteps treading over the carpeted floor of his living room, and then a quiet, sympathetic, ‘
Harry stares at his ex-colleague silently as he climbs to his feet.
The pub is too small, the ceiling is too low, and there’s just too much magic, too many spells prickling against his senses. He can feel it building and building and building up inside of him, and Ginny’s looking at him with dark, frightened eyes, and Hermione’s trying to say something to him, but all he can hear is the sound of his blood boiling in his veins. Harry’s pint glass melts beneath his fingers, hissing as it pools in a glowing circle on the table. He can’t stop it, he can’t control it, he’s going to hurt someone if he doesn’t
‘Can I-’ starts Harry, but then his throat closes in on itself, because Draco’s thumb brushes the corner of his lips and,
Malfoy rolls his eyes, but lets Harry order him an overly festive hot chocolate anyways. He pays for the both of them, expertly leafing through the coloured banknotes as though he never pranced around school hissing slurs at Muggle-born students. In his cable knit sweater and worn-out jeans, he looks like one of them. He talks like them too, ordering smoothly and flashing the staff a courteous smile before picking up the little sign with their table number. He even gets up to grab their drinks, but Harry waves him off, nodding pointedly at Malfoy’s hands.
They sit together for a while in a companionable silence that is as much a conversation as any. The stars are hidden behind a faint dusting of clouds, but the moon is a fat dollop of cream against the sky and the air smells like roses and lemon rinds. A lively song picks up on the wireless, overlain with laughter and conversation.
Draco wakes on the fourth day.
Harry feels ugly, cold panic slither down his throat, building frost in his stomach. He forces himself to remain calm, forces himself to meet his fiancé’s panicked eyes and smile calmly.
It is quiet in Grimmauld Place as Draco drags the nib of his quill against parchment. It is a good letter. An effective letter. It has hard edges and polite threats, and just enough flattery to sweeten its bitter medicine.
the letter reads.
Draco smiles at Harry, radiant and beautiful and fragile. ‘I already have everything I want.’
it. It’s a glorious thing to wake up to the smell of warm chocolate drifting up through the floorboards. Harry squeezes through the packed shop, shouting a hurried
He loves this house. It isn’t quite Grimmauld Place (which he’s now handed over to Teddy, who really should have been the rightful heir to the Black fortune all along) and it isn’t quite Godric’s Hollow either, but it’s
To Molly’s great delight, Draco doesn’t want a winter wedding.
They’ve both seen the ugliness on that side of the curtain.
Even though the apartment is quiet and empty, this place feels so very Draco, from the eggshell blue of the walls to the pale, polished wood of the floorboards and the sprawling rugs underfoot. Botanical drawings hang in simple frames from the walls. The bookshelves are crammed with a collection of Muggle and magical books, some old and leather-bound, others cheap paperbacks with cracked spines. A generous-sized desk is placed next to the curtainless windows -
Draco places a thin chip of ice between his lips. It’s all Harry’s allowed for the time being, until his organs grow back. Cold water slips down Harry’s parched throat, soothing it momentarily. This is part of the routine too - Harry opening his eyes, trying to speak, and coughing helplessly until Draco feeds him ice. It would be pretty pathetic if it wasn’t for the fact that it’s a bloody miracle that Harry’s here at all.
,’ she says, and strides into the centre of the room, her stilettos clicking loudly against the floorboards. ‘Weasley!’
Draco smiles, looking up at the ceiling as his eyes begin to sting. He really did think he was out of tears.
‘You’d never,’ says Neville with a shit-eating grin.
A shocked hush falls over the crowd.
, for a change.’
’ He pulls their clasped hands up to his chest, where his heart hammers away as though eager to escape the confines of flesh, blood, and bone. ‘What about Ghent? What about when I told you I wanted to build a forever with you? Did you think that was unresolved sexual tension?’
he have stopped it, even if he’d tried? Or would he, too, have been reduced to ash and charred bone?
Draco seems about ready to chastise Teddy for calling himself a burden (they agreed a long time ago never to use that word with Teddy, not after the cupboard under the stairs and bars on windows, not when they both love him so much) when Healer Thompson walks in.
‘They want to weaponize him.’ Ron is so angry he is quiet, and he is never quiet.
‘What if you can’t find him?’ she asks softly.
‘Aw, thanks mate,’ Harry says sarcastically. He sits back down in his chair. ‘Hadn’t noticed ‘til you pointed it out. Cheers.’
‘How do you have Muggle money?’ Harry asks when he gets back, more out of curiosity than anything.
Draco tries very hard not to look, but then Potter calls his name and makes a terrible joke, and Draco can’t
And then they take him away.
Harry clasps his hands together in his lap, brushing his thumb over the fading white letters on the back of his hand. I must not tell lies. He thinks about the tight enclosure of the cupboard under the stairs and the persistent pangs of hunger. He thinks about the cold hatred he always felt exuding from Professor Snape, unearned and undeserved.
‘even if Murakami isn’t to your refined taste, you can’t give it back. We don’t take refunds.’
Draco halts in his steps, and Harry stops alongside him. Harry scrubs his hand through his hair, taking a deep breath as he draws together the right words.
‘Are you going to shock me again?’ Harry asks, grinning a little.
Harry lifts his hands up in defeat. ‘Yeah, alright.’
Pansy rolls her eyes. ‘Just
Harry sits on his desk, thighs spread and arms folded over his chest. ‘Well this is a bit familiar, isn’t it?’ he asks with a slight grin.
His eyes are like starlight when he looks up at Harry.
Draco presses his palms against Harry’s cheeks and presses his forehead against Harry’s and Harry feels a very different sort of ache grow within his chest, mingling with his grief. Draco is kind and clever and beautiful and perfect. The world tilts beneath him and he falls forwards into the vastness of his emotion, and it frightens him, but he can’t help it, because this is how they are, him and Draco, Draco and him, and he’s been headed here since he read Draco’s heartlines transcribed in that lovely letter.
‘What feats are there left for you to achieve, Harry, that would make you finally worthy of love?’ Draco runs his thumbs over Harry’s scarred knuckles, over the stark white lettering -
‘Get your shoes on, Potter,’ orders Proudfoot.
full of surprises.’
Harry raises his eyebrows. ‘That wasn’t a
‘I’ll find him,’ Harry says, because that’s how they are, him and Draco, Draco and him. ‘I always do.’
Harry huffs a surprised laugh.
I do love my angst. I hope you do too, because ch 11 is going to be pretty angsty too. Don’t worry though, I’m also a stickler for happy endings.
‘Thank you,’ Malfoy replies, setting the jar of eyes down on the counter. ‘I’ve been helping out here in exchange for curse damage treatment. I can’t do any brewing yet, on account of the tremors, but it’s as good as an apprenticeship.’ He frowns as he studies Harry. ‘You look tired.’
‘Well, we’re only patrolling the shopping district,’ Harry says with a shrug. ‘I sincerely doubt we’re going to be seeing much action.’
After the vows are said and the binding is done, they go down to the small orchard Harry planted for Draco, where a long row of tables and benches have been shoved together between the line of cherry trees and lemon trees. The wedding cake towers at the centre of the impressive spread of food and sparkling wine -
perfect,’ Draco says fiercely, tugging on Harry’s hands. ‘
I actually really like the vegan places in Soho. I went to Mildred’s for a friend’s birthday and it was so very good.
- or perhaps a shimmering set of fireworks -
‘Bloody hell, Daphne,’ Harry chuckles. ‘You know I hate it when you manipulate me into feeling positive about life.’
Malfoy stares at him with an expression of faint bemusement. ‘I can’t drink,’ he says. ‘Alcohol interferes with my potions.’
‘Yes, precisely.’ Marsters drains the last of his coffee and sets it down on the table. He gestures at the waiter, summoning him over to collect the bill. ‘Tread carefully, Mr. Potter,’ he says, his eyes fixed on the approaching waiter. ‘The DMLE is a dangerous enemy to make.’
Neville flips him off good-naturedly.
He knows it’s not even six in the morning in England, but Harry didn’t sleep last night. There’s a rush of adrenaline that always hits him in the first few days of working a case, and it usually makes him restless enough to pace around his suite. Besides, as far as he’s concerned, Blaise deserves to be woken up at the crack of dawn with an international Floo call for the absolute hell he’s put Harry through these past few days.
Harry ignores the senior Auror. He’s not in the mood for this particular argument.
When Harry returns from the shower, Draco is sitting cross-legged in bed, staring at the hanging constellation with a curious, wistful look on his face. He opens his mouth, as if to ask something, but then seems to think better of it.
Potter beams as though Draco has given him the most wonderful compliment. ‘I can’t
‘That’s rather the point, darling,’ Draco says.
, Daphne used to tell him, and she didn’t mean it the way Hermione meant it, because apparently Harry could literally burn himself into cinders if he wasn’t careful, and the melting glass and burnt sheets was only the beginning of how bad things could get.
Narcissa stares at Harry for a while, blinking too few times for his comfort. ‘He doesn’t come round on weekdays, he sends Pansy. He visits on weekends. He never wants me to be afraid or alone. I wish he wasn’t such a good boy, Mr. Potter. You know that. You must know.’ And, then, again: ‘I love him more than anything.’
That, at least, Harry knows to be true. There were a number of nameless lovers who drifted in and out of Draco’s life - nobody permanent, of course, and plenty of them were Muggles who came upon him in the bar he worked or at the coffee shops he frequented. Harry never quite understood back then why Draco never found someone permanent.
Harry isn’t sure what to expect. As he follows Narcissa down the short, carpeted hallway towards the living room, his mind races through the options. He hopes it’s Draco. It can’t be Lucius - this building has a million wards on it ensuring that no one with a criminal magical signature can get through. Harry briefly entertains the wild idea that it might be Teddy, but he knows Teddy is halfway across the world doing his apprenticeship.
- by Harry’s godson, who promptly snatches the toy dragon out of his hands and starts very loudly voicing his complaints about the anatomical inaccuracy of the dragon. Apparently, there are
‘When was the last time you saw him?’ Pansy asks.
, Draco once wrote to Harry, in a lovely letter that Harry still keeps folded up in his wallet, preserved with a multitude of charms so he can carry it around like the secret love he’s harboured for Draco these long years, maybe even forever, maybe even since Draco first shot up into the sky on a broomstick with a stolen Remembrall and he went flying after.
‘What?’ Hermione utters, indignant. ‘Harry! Why didn’t you tell us?’
Blaise’s smile is a lazy, slanting thing. As bedraggled and tired as he is, Blaise still is a little too handsome to look at for very long. ‘It’s no skin off my nose, Potter,’ he shrugs. ‘I don’t think they should exist anyways. They’re too dangerous if used in the wrong hands - and looking at history, all hands can become the wrong hands.’
‘Mate, I hate to break it to you,’ Neville grins, ‘but I think Malfoy might not need telling.’
‘Don’t you fucking dare, you don’t have a license,’ shouts Percy from where he’s spelling their fifth bottle of wine open.
Harry whirls around and backs down the road, away from Malfoy. ‘Don’t come near me,’ he says again, feeling nearly hysterical.
He made a promise to Harry, years ago in a dingy alleyway stinking of piss and cheap booze - and he does not break his promises.
‘As much as I’d love for you to throw me onto the rug and have your wicked way with me, you’re absolutely intoxicated. And you’re heartbroken. And sad and drunk sex is never a good idea.’ He looks up at Harry, his brow wrinkled with concern. ‘I’ve never had drunk sex, but I have had a lot of sad sex. It’s shite.’
Draco snorts. ‘Well, there’s a reductionist approach.’
Not included in this chapter: Daphne personally hunting down the Aurors responsible for performing the core-draining curse on Harry and unleashing all her fury on them.
Proudfoot seems as perturbed by the whole situation as Harry is. ‘Now just wait here, Zabini,’ the Auror says, pointing at the Unspeakable. ‘The Department of Mysteries don’t have the authority to let a Hogwarts teacher hijack an Auror investigation.’
Draco is still generous with his affections, but they are a quieter sort - a hand on Harry’s lower back, guiding him through the flower market, a meaningful smile shot over Teddy’s head as they walk through the Muggle museums, a brush of the hand when Draco hands Harry his tea, Draco’s fingers lacing through Harry’s as they watch the telly when the weather’s too poor to venture outdoors.
(See the end of the chapter for
He places his hand on his desk, palm flat against the dark wood. The milk snake slithers across the desk and up onto his wrist, disappearing beneath his sleeve. Harry stares at the whole ritual in morbid fascination.
Draco wrinkles his nose disgustedly at the mention of the phenomenal unpleasantness that was Dolores Umbridge. ‘Only because I was an insufferable git obsessed with winning approval of anyone in power. Next excuse.’
Harry frowns at her. ‘If I let you see my Anchors, will you let me review this damn ledger?’
‘It’s not Draco we have jurisdiction over,’ he replies at last. ‘It’s Lucius.  He’s been working with a faction of neo-Death Eaters to create a complex Time-Turner which can roll back years. Decades, maybe. I’m sure you can imagine what they want to do with something like that.’
‘I think winter weddings are very romantic,’ Victoire offers, passing Teddy the saltshaker with a flick of her wand.
the strict dad.’
property.’ He lifts his shoulder in an over-exaggerated display of nonchalance.  ‘Now, we can’t be too sad about him beating the shit out of a Death Eater Lucius Malfoy, but that’s three broken ribs, a shattered collarbone, and a lot of bruised organs. It’s a troubling pattern, sir. It’s got to go to trial.’
‘No,’ Pansy snaps. She drops into a chair and folds her arms tightly over her chest. ‘Just give me the bloody tea.’
‘Merlin,’ Harry utters. His eyes feel too hot and too heavy for his skull. As he looks back up at Draco, his vision grows blurry. ‘
Harry has to find him.
But then Neville was there when Harry was at his lowest three years ago, sitting in the charred remains of the Room of Hidden Things, his face streaked with ash and tears. Neville was the one that sat with Harry up in the Astronomy Tower until dawn, listening to Harry shakily explain how bad his PTSD had gotten, how sometimes he was too afraid to bring a Boggart into his lessons for fear of whether he’d scar his students, because the things that he’s seen through Voldemort’s eyes should never,
‘I hope I’m next,’ Luna pipes up happily.
Neville plucks the butterbeer bottle and raises it up in a toast. ‘Horcrux privileges,’ he salutes, and downs half of the bottle.
Harry catches him by the waist and presses open-mouthed kisses against Draco’s neck. ‘What have I done to deserve such cruel words from my beloved?’ he sighs in mock despair. ‘All I do shower him in love and admiration.’
‘I missed you too,’ Harry replies. ‘I’m glad you’re coming home with me tomorrow.’
Blaise owls ahead to say he’s going to drop by in the afternoon to interview Draco and collect memories for the pensive. When the Floo flares with green fire, Draco rises from his comfortable seat by the fire to greet his friend. He ends up nearly being bowled over as Blaise all but attacks him with a crushing hug.
While the Weasley-Longbottom wedding was pure, delightful chaos, the Greengrass-Liu wedding is a hazy, midsummer night’s dream.
‘You know what?’ Harry says. ‘Me too.’
,’ he says emphatically, getting up from his seat.
‘I am a Black,’ Draco says. ‘This is the only way we know how to love.’
Harry gets a letter from one Senior Auror Marsters in response to his request, that very same evening.
‘Yeah, sure,’ Harry says. ‘Kingsley wanted to root out blood-purists hiding in the Ministry. There was a whole team of people assigned to that.’
But something’s wrong.
the law,’ Hermione grits out.
that brings her here now, to sit in this empty slaughterhouse with him and offer him undeserved help.
‘Yes,’ Harry says, ‘and I distinctly remember you aiding Umbridge in bringing an end to the DA.’
The door swings open with a near-inaudible creak. Harry scrambles off Draco quickly, but not quickly enough, apparently, because Teddy is standing in the doorway, his eyes nearly ready to pop out of his head as he stares at them.
‘Er,’ says Harry. ‘I was never actually angry at you, Parkinson.’
Draco’s smiles lazily. ‘Hm.’ He leans in close for a kiss. ‘I suppose I did.’
‘Come to Ghent,’ he tells Harry once he’s done rambling. ‘You’ll love it here.’
It makes sense, in the grand scheme of things, that the day that it all goes to shit is the happiest day of his life.
Draco shivers. His mind supplies unkind words in the silence that follows, and as always, they resonate within his skull in his father’s icy baritone.
Harry flips him the bird.
Neville presses a palm over his heart and shakes his head despairingly. ‘You’re a cruel man, Harry.’
‘He and Astoria should be here in the next few minutes,’ Blaise tells them both, his gaze lingering on Draco for a breath longer than it should. ‘Pansy owled to ask if she should take a portkey from Paris, but I’ve put her on Narcissa watch. Hope that’s alright with you.’
After Goldren’s Potions, it’s as though a dam has burst, and suddenly Malfoy is everywhere.
Narcissa isn’t quite as adventurous as Draco when it comes to Muggle Paris. She rents out a beautiful flat in the wizarding quarter, further outside of the city. Harry’s been there a total of three times. He’s grateful that Narcissa saved his life, but he’s not exactly on friendly terms with her.
‘It’s funny,’ Draco remarks. ‘I couldn’t even get a single consultation here before. They wouldn’t even let me past the reception desk. Oh well,’ he says, winking at Harry. ‘I suppose there is some benefit to being tortured by one’s father after all.’
, Potter?’
‘Your record will be clear of all charges,’ Kingsley says, lowering his wand. ‘You are free to go. The DMLE will leave you in peace. And, Harry, by my wife’s life, I swear I will see this investigation to the end. This ends here.’
‘We’re celebrating.’
(It is, in fact, impossible to forget Harry Potter. Draco has wonderful, devastating dreams where he stands in the Astronomy Tower and has his wand ripped away by a boy with an angry mouth and lightning-green eyes, a boy who pushes him up against cold walls and tells him to
‘Some of them did the best they could,’ Harry says, hating the way he sounds petulant.
‘Here,’ Draco murmurs sleepily, pressing Harry’s glasses into his palm.
‘You need a haircut, mate,’ Neville remarks, glancing at him as they head towards the Great Hall.
‘You’re drunk,’ Harry says, unfolding the letter in his hand.
Malfoy seems less than pleased at being ordered around, but he takes a dainty little bite of chocolate. There is an absurdity to all of it that makes Harry want to laugh. Instead, he sits down next to Malfoy, holding both their wands in his left hand. Something feels like it’s shifting under his feet, like the whole world is tilting in a different direction, and he doesn’t know what to do with the enormity of it all.
‘He’s on his own, Harry,’ Molly sniffs, dabbing at her eyes with the corner of her apron. ‘That’s not right. Not on Christmas. But he won’t come for dinner. Says he’s under house arrest. Oh, Harry, it’s not right.’
And then he feels it - the whine of distant wards putting a feeble fight as intruders cross into the property. He recognizes the sensation. It’s one he’s felt himself perhaps a hundred, thousand times when his Auror credentials bypass the wards.
‘If it makes you feel better,’ Ron replies, winking. ‘Shall I have a look at this then?’
‘Oh, we’re quite alright now,’ Daphne tells him with a smile. ‘I’m still working on a cure, but between my research and Goldren’s treatments, Astoria’s as healthy as the next person. But we’re not talking about my sister. Will you Transfigure that glass in your left hand into a goldfish bowl for me, please?’
Harry frowns. ‘That’s different.’
Draco agrees, but he has long since given up fighting against that want - that terrible, unavoidable longing.
Malfoy just sat there, mutely accepting all the ludicrous charges against him, shackled, and shoved into a warded cage as though he were some dangerous criminal. Harry couldn’t peel his eyes away from Malfoy’s hands, twitching and jerking helplessly in his lap. His wrists were so thin the shackles didn’t even fit.
And now we are done with Looking For Malfoy.
‘No, I mean-’ Ron peers closer at the jumble of spells circling the golden orb, long threads of runes weaving in and out of one another. ‘I recognize some of this. Listen, George and I worked on some of this for our Undetectable Box of Delectables.’
Draco’s lawyer awards Harry a polite, close-lipped smile. ‘I understand,’ he replies.
Harry sleeps for two days after his release. He dreams of flowers and stars, and a circle of trees and a platform painted all in white, and then, towards the end, tall wildflowers swaying in the breeze and the smell of damp soil. When he finally wakes, it is to Draco smiling fondly at him, backlit by a halo of afternoon sunlight.
But he also knows that the well of Draco’s love runs deep when it comes to Pansy, and that there is nothing that Draco would not endure for the sake of his best friend, so he holds his tongue.
He tries to run - even towards the roaring, unnatural flames now eating up the street, but the ground opens up like a mouth beneath Harry, cobblestones dropping away into the vast emptiness. His foot hits thin air and he plummets down, down, down. The last thing Harry sees as he falls into the pit is the world toppling inwards like a house of cards, buildings shaking loose of their structures and tumbling after him with all their stone and brick and splintered wood, and beyond that, green fire eats the stars.
, something sympathetic and worried - and he pushes the tray to the side, peels Draco’s hands off the mocha and sets it down. He gathers Draco up into his grasp with one smooth, effortless show of strength. They slot together like puzzle pieces.
‘We can’t recreate the complex magic that most school founders used to protect their buildings,’ Angel adds wryly. ‘I mean, we’re not that powerful. But we figured out a way to scramble the magical trace of the Lopez Panic Room, as well as the magical signature of anyone inside the room. Basically, even if you do figure out that someone’s got a Panic Room, you’re not going to be able to figure out where it’s physically located in their home.’
They’re all at the pub near Luna’s - too many bodies squashed into a booth, with Hermione nearly sat on top of Malfoy - when Ron announces he’s quitting the Aurors to work with George.
Blaise, to his great dismay, catches the bouquet - but only because Draco lobs it at his head with the speed and accuracy befitting an ex-Seeker.
Harry’s not crying. He’s just… his glasses are just wonky. Or something.
true, but he’ll take a compliment if he’s handed one on such a delightful platter.
‘Not on the upholstery,’ he says sternly.
There is an unfinished letter on the desk, secured beneath a moonstone paperweight.
There’s a summer storm sliding in from the East. Harry watches the dark clouds cover the late afternoon sun, dragging shadows over the shining city. The air is laced with petrichor. A memory comes to him, unbidden, and he recalls a flash of cold hands and breathless laughter and standing pressed up against Draco beneath a copse of trees as sheets of icy rain come crashing down. Harry presses his fingertips against the corners of his eyes and takes in a deep breath.
‘Yeah, ’course I did,’ Ron grins. ‘Had to hide them from
Harry complains about Teddy’s growing attitude and Prentis’s general smarminess while Draco keeps his fingertips splayed over the Anchor on Harry’s left forearm. He’s always been fascinated with them.
to work with you when you get your qualifications,’ he announces.
It takes Draco exactly five days to close all his accounts, pack up his life, and move to Paris.
Harry has to resist an overwhelming urge to go over there and adjust the strength of her lenses. Draco seems to read his mind, because he flashes Harry a tiny, knowing smirk.
Harry nods, the movements slow. He feels as though he is still in freefall, and so he clings desperately to Draco’s forearm. ‘I know,’ he says, as winded as though he were punched in the gut. ‘Draco, that was - that was -’
‘Don’t be dramatic, Potter,’ huffs Draco, but his cheeks are flushed with pleasure.
Harry nods along with her story, encouraging her to continue.
Harry rests his head against his knees, his palms braced on the tops of his shins as he keeps his eyes fixed on Draco’s face. ‘Alright then,’ he says.
But Potter is as much a god of creature comforts as he is a storm.
Harry manages a chuckle. After three hours of working with the elder Weasley, Harry wonders how Ron’s managed to put up with it for this long. George’s spikes of creative energy are exhausting - it’s like being strapped to a rollercoaster manned by a chaos demon with a penchant for explosives.
‘Oh, if you must,’ Malfoy sighs, rolling his eyes dramatically. He sets his wrist in Harry’s grip, turning his palm skyward. ‘I don’t know why you insist on this ritual every time we meet. It’s really quite tedious.’
Harry perches on the side of Draco’s chair, feeling too unsettled to sit on the couch. This is going to be a difficult interview - and not just for Draco.
Hermione isn’t much of a dancer, normally, but this is the first wedding she’s attended where she doesn’t have to mind her children, so she gets
Ginny extracts herself from her husband’s grasp. She throws Harry a mock salute. ‘Hiya, Harry. Still here?’
Harry reaches for the rage that’s been feeding him all these months, that monster created from grief and loss and pain, but it’s gone. Fizzled out.
Draco drops his gaze to the glossy surface of the table. His lips pull outwards into a bland smile. ‘You underestimate my father, Harry. In the end, Lucius always gets what he wants, regardless of what he has to do to achieve it.’
Something in the back of Harry’s mind clicks into place. ‘Merlin-sodding-
Harry’s gut lurches, like he’s pushing his broomstick into a nosedive after the Snitch. ‘Ginny, I-’
Teddy’s gaze drops to where his uncle’s fingers encircle his godfather’s wrist, and then he looks up at Harry. He can change the colour of his hair and warp the shape of his nose and chin however he likes - but the shape and colour of his eyes remain the same. It is an echo of things lost in the war, things that leave a dull ache in Harry’s chest.
Harry frowns. ‘Hey, I know about time magic,’ he says, feeling a little defensive. ‘I’ve done some research.’
cancelled on you.’
They get married on a brisk, Scottish summer’s day roughly one year after their engagement, in the spacious gardens of their home.
However, as they fasten his fingers into place with metal braces, all he feels is a depthless, vacant kind of calm.
‘Would… would you like me to kiss you?’ Harry asks nervously.
Ron wanders over to the mess scattered over the bed, squinting slightly as he scans over Harry’s scribbled notes. He should really get himself a pair of reading glasses, but Ron’s as stubborn as they come.
Harry presses his lips together. ‘No,’ he says. ‘Draco is not there.’
‘Don’t be a sourpuss, Potter,’ Pansy laughs. ‘I don’t hold an intervention for just
Harry stills. They haven’t done anything beyond a bit of heavy petting and a lot of kissing, mostly due to how fragile Draco’s body has been following the kidnapping - and with the added chaos of Harry’s arrest and subsequent release, Harry is afraid that Draco’s managed to exacerbate his condition with lack of sleep and compounded stress.
He’d been wrong about villains and victims before. Maybe he’s wrong about Malfoy, too.
The severing curse, apparently, was the least of the injuries. Harry knows this already - the Healers told him as much, back in the hospital before Draco woke - but it burns in his throat and sits sour in his mouth to hear it. It is a specific anguish, to hear the atrocities committed to someone you love, and yet to be helpless to save them from it - for time separates you from any action you might have taken to spare them pain. He feels helpless, angry, frightened.
Proudfoot hesitates, his wand hand shifting slightly upwards into a duelling position.
It is simple enough work finding the corresponding dates. Like a blackbird perched in a tree, they are easier to find once you know what you’re looking for. Draco cross-checks them with the Malfoy family ledger, bending slightly over the table as he runs his fingers down the records lightly.
Harry’s hand is hot like an iron brand when it touches Draco’s cheek. He guides Draco’s chin upwards until their gazes finally meet. His eyes are the same devastating green as that fateful day in the dungeons.
Harry thinks. Some days he could drink half a bottle of firewhiskey and still taste the mix of duelling spells and Dark Magic. Some days he stands under the showers and wishes that he could wash all the blood off his hands, but he can’t save everyone, he’s not a Healer, he doesn’t know how to fucking sow people up again after they’ve been split open by hexes and curses, he just knows how to hurt. Today is worse than all those days put together.
It isn’t as though he forgot about Harry Potter.
She was one of the first to receive a letter. It arrived with a bouquet of white orchids and a box of Turkish delight - which Luna adores. They’ve been writing to each other almost every day, and Luna usually offers to visit Malfoy’s apartment to clear it of Nargles. Malfoy always declines, though.
Harry lets out a bark of shocked laughter. ‘
They don’t talk about it, but that’s alright.
There is a brief, shocked silence, until Rose yells, ‘
Rose pats her mother’s hand and says, rather dryly, ‘Mum, it’s okay, Hugo learned his first bad word when he was five from Dad.’
Daphne migrates around the dining room table and gently guides the youngest Weasley sibling into one of the seats at the table. ‘Cream?’ she asks. ‘Sugar?’
Harry traces the pad of his thumb over the arch of Draco’s brow. ‘Draco, I-’
‘You could never be a burden,’ says Harry, as though it is a universal fact. ‘Not to me. Never to me.’
Harry scrunches up his face in an exaggerated performance of confusion. ‘I mean, you did?’ he says. ‘Who keeps their lube in the same box as their emergency sewing kit anyways?’
(He asks his therapist if it is unhealthy to put everything bad in a room, close the door, and leave for a bit until he is ready to face it again.
‘Oh, I heard,’ Daphne says, pulling a lilac envelope from her pocket. She waves it at Harry accusingly. ‘Work. The very same work that was responsible for placing you in Diagon Alley on-’
Nurses scream and scatter as Harry reappears in a hallway in St Mungo’s. People don’t normally Apparate between countries, it’s not supposed to be possible, but he’s Harry fucking Potter, Master of the Deathly Hallows, so he’s going to do whatever the fuck he wants if it means saving the man he loves.
(Chapter 7 will be a little on the long side, so bear with me while I work through the chewy ooey gooey stuff. As always, I work un-beta'd and it is a hot flaming mess - like me!)
,’ Harry utters, his voice sounding strange and raspy from disuse.
Harry’s Anchors are at their lowest setting so that he can feel as much of the Lopez Panic Room as possible when he starts weaving George’s spell. There are a multitude of charms keeping the apartment running. Each and every one of them whisper to Harry as he treads over the ornate rug towards Narcissa’s living room. It’s unpleasant - there’s a ringing in his ear and an ache building behind his eyes, but he can still focus through it.
‘Lovegood!’ Pansy yells from across the room. ‘Let’s start with the shoes.’
Except then Malfoy appears, pale and skeletal, twitching from curse damage, and the crazy bastard lies to a room full of Death Eaters.
‘I’m done at six-thirty,’ Malfoy replies.
Harry considers hexing the smarmy bastard, but then realizes that they’re surrounded by impressionable young students, and as the current Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, he
say it was weird,’ Harry snorts. ‘But, to get back to the point - as far as Draco’s told me, his mother is actually quite good at throwing off any kind of mind-altering curses.’
‘It’s going to be alright, Harry,’ Hermione says, softly, with undeserved kindness. ‘He’ll pull through.’
Because people
Harry hesitates for a moment. He tucks a lock of hair behind Draco’s ear, marvelling at the silken softness of those white-blond locks. Everything about Draco is a wonder, a mystery - everything from his strange, feral beauty to the scattering of freckles and moles over his body, to the minute number of scars and wrinkles he’s collected over the years. They are no longer young men, and life has left its mark on both of them.
‘Are you aware of the Ministry clean-up task force, Mr. Potter?’ Masters asks.
‘I’m going to kill you,’ says Harry, and he almost means it.
Draco is still staring bemusedly at the middle-aged witch as she exits the hospital room in a hurried stride that Harry’s come to recognize as a Healer’s polite method of getting their ass to the next patient bleeding their guts out.
Draco feels a fluttering in his throat, a scratching like tiny claws crawling up out of his neck, and the tears fall before he can get himself under control.
Thompson smiles with blatant animosity. ‘Oh, I’m not joking,’ she says lightly. ‘Though apparently you are.’
having anything to do with that nasty, pathetic excuse of a wizard. Lucius deserves to rot in Azkaban for the rest of his natural life for what he did.
?’ Harry laughs, shoving her away with his free hand.
But Harry can’t help but tighten his grip on his wand. His heart hammers away in his chest as his vision sharpens, adrenaline coursing through his veins. Harry recognizes Proudfoot immediately, though he’s aged since they last saw each other and looks to have gathered a few more scars. The young man to Proudfoot’s left is unfamiliar. He looks barely a day over twenty, which means he’s probably a fresh recruit. The tall man to Proudfoot’s right, however, sets Harry’s teeth on edge. He knows an Unspeakable when he sees one.
Neville reaches out slowly, as though approaching a frightened animal, and places his palm flat on Harry’s shoulder. He has strong hands, but his grip is gentle.
‘Well,’ says Draco, trying very hard not to think about the inherent eroticism of being hit on the leg with a
‘This is going to catch up sometime,’ she tells him, ‘and you’re going to get hurt.’
,’ he says, indicating the scroll in Hermione’s hand. ‘See, your precious Mr. Potter has been practicing magic that isn’t within the confines of registered spells. And to make matters worse, he’s been injuring people. Destroying property -
you, Draco,’ Harry says, low and fervent, desperate for Draco to believe him. ‘With all my heart. In each waking moment.’
He knows the young man who penned the letter that he still keeps in his pocket, the man who stacked books in a Muggle shop and watched crap telly on Sundays and named his cat after the goddess of the hunt, because she couldn’t catch a mouse even if it climbed into her mouth.
‘I know a few hair-trimming spells,’ Professor Flitwick pipes up from Harry’s left elbow.
‘If you die before my qualification, Harry,’ Draco says, his voice forcibly light, ‘I will go into the Forbidden Forest, find the Resurrection Stone, bring you back, and hex you right down to hell.’
‘I’ll try something different.’ Harry gets up and pulls a set of cards from one of the drawers in the living room. ‘Let’s say each card is one hour. If I turn back the clock one hour, I get two cards. I can only arrange two possibilities with two cards.’
‘I’m perfectly fine, Neville,’ he says sharply. ‘I’d rather you stayed out of my private affairs in future.’
, which Harry isn’t quite sure is a compliment, but you never know, with the wizarding upper class.
I said ch 11 would make it better? Apparently I lied.
Marsters’s owl is a lovely, speckled girl. She waits patiently for him to finish writing, and she does not peck at Harry’s fingers, unlike
Draco’s smile falls from his face as he pales visibly. The glossy magazine drops out of his hands and into his lap with a soft
‘Neville owled just now,’ says Ginny. ‘There are Aurors at Hogwarts. They want to conduct an investigation on school premises, but Neville says they don’t have a warrant and McGonagall is putting up a serious fight. Apparently she hasn’t been this angry since the Umbridge incident.’
Harry digs his teeth into his lip, and he knows all of this, really, but it aches all the same.
… Harry has never seen anything burn so bright. ‘You will take that abomination off him. Right now.’
‘I just… okay, fine, maybe I do, but what else am I supposed to do?’ he sighs. He turns Draco’s palm over and traces the callouses and burns left from long hours of potion-making. ‘I’m hardly a genius like you or Hermione. And I’m not very creative, like Ron and George are. I’m not good with plants or animals. I’m just good at fighting.’
Malfoy sips his tea, his eyes dancing with wicked amusement. ‘You’ll have to figure that one out by yourself,’ he tells Harry. ‘Or suffer in your delightful ignorance. Either way, do let me know which you’ve decided on.’
He dismisses the cards to their place on the shelf with a wave of his hand. Draco looks just as lost as Blaise, but he’s hiding a smile behind his hand as he shakes his head at Harry, as if to say,
? - but once Harry manages to decipher the incomprehensible scrawl, it’s actually fucking
‘Y’know,’ Ron says thoughtfully, ‘George is more an expert on this level of complicated spellwork than I am. I’ll give it my best shot though.’
Daphne smiles at him lopsidedly. ‘Yes,’ she says. ‘I did. And
‘I don’t mean that,’ she sighs, leaning forwards to rescue Harry’s hair from her daughter’s grasp. ‘You’re burning the candle at both ends. I know you’re young, and single, and popular and this is just, I don’t know, a quarter-life crisis or whatever Ron says it is. But I don’t think you’re happy. I don’t think it’s healthy.’
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco shakes his head. ‘No, I was asleep but-’ he breaks off with a sharp inhale, and he looks down at his bare feet.
They roll Draco away, casting diagnostic spells as they go, and Draco is so pale and limp and quiet between them that Harry wants to scream.
Harry throws him a look, mouthing,
Blaise closes his notebook and taps it against the flat of his palm. ‘Potter’s explanation checks out,’ he says. I’m going to have to confirm with other sources, but it appears that the Time-Turner you were working on was never going to be successful.’
Ron is a veteran at taking his children to fair rides, so he knows that too much motion on a full stomach leads to a very quickly emptied stomach, and apparently hasn’t packed enough wet wipes to deal with it, so they are all banned from the roller coasters for at least half an hour. Teddy and Victoire, who played Chaser against each other all through school, have an epic showdown shooting basketballs into wobbling hoops while an awestruck crowd watches on.
because Blaise doesn’t have emotions, he just sweeps around looking handsome and being better than everyone else. He pulls off his outer robes, folding them over the back of an armchair, unbuttons his waistcoat, and drops into the chair with the same unnerving grace that every member of the Slytherin club seems to exude.
‘I can’t change our past,’ Draco tells Harry, ‘no matter how much I want to. But,’ he adds, his voice taking on a hard, determined tone, ‘you’re not going to be a tragedy. I’m not going to be a tragedy. We’re going to have
Harry stares at Draco, and feels, once more, the earth shifting beneath him.
‘Pretty good,’ Stephen replies, frowning slightly. He tucks his hands in his trouser pockets, tilting his head slightly as he glances between Draco, Blaise, and Acquafredda. ‘Has to be, with my family’s line of work.’
‘Yeah, sure,’ Neville says.
Draco leans into Harry’s side, his forehead wrinkling with worry. ‘Should we perhaps inform them that we don’t actually have wedding plans?’ he asks in a lowered voice. ‘I truly don’t want to disappoint them - it’s just that I haven’t even picked out a ring-’
At this point, it’s turned into a complete tour of the apartment, so Harry obediently follows the middle-aged witch around. The guest bedroom is full of flowering plants, and there are enough potions textbooks spilling from the tall shelves for Harry to guess who usually occupies this space. Even as they move on, the familiar scent of lemon, mint and cedarwood lingers on Harry’s clothing.
‘I haven’t needed to,’ Harry replies.
He doesn’t ask for it, though. Not even in the honey-sweet moments when they sit together by the river and watch fireworks explode in the sky, when Draco’s thumb strokes patterns into the nape of Harry’s neck. Not afterwards, when they drink champagne in Draco’s bed and grow giggly off the bubbles - not even when Draco presses his hand against Harry’s cheek and
‘That’s very likely,’ Draco says, looping his arm through Harry’s. ‘But at least I got you out of the house. And you look fit.’
to sign. ‘You can rail me through a wall any time, Daddy,’ she grins. ‘I’m your biggest fan.’
Draco laughs, tipping his head back. ‘Circe, Harry,’ he says breathlessly, when he’s done. ‘You have
Harry thinks his knees might give out. He grabs Draco’s forearm in an effort to steady himself. ‘Fuck,’ he curses. ‘Draco, are you - are you really doing this?’

, and for some reason that awful pun tickled Draco pink.
But he won’t. If he does, he’ll never stop running - and he’s done enough running for a hundred lifetimes. Besides, he has someone waiting for him.
There’s a hollowness to the way Draco says those last few sentences, and his right hand clenches slightly as though fighting off a phantom pain. He’s as good as cured, but the curse damage was only half the trauma inflicted upon Draco by his piece-of-shit father.
Harry and Draco used to have a good laugh at the very prospect of Draco
He closes his eyes, fastening a portion of his consciousness to the soothing hum of Anchors and lets the rest of him unfold. He can feel the storm’s power grow stronger as it approaches - angry, sharp-toothed, sparking with wild, untamed magic, and so vastly different from deep, steady hum of ley lines. He tilts his head back as thunder booms, close enough to make the walls shake.
‘Can you believe that McGonagall makes us file risk assessment forms before each term?’ Neville chuckles. ‘Could you even imagine Professor Dumbledore doing the same?’
Harry sits there and thinks
Pansy scoffs.
Mr. Malfoy.’
‘Why are you here?’ he asks.
‘Would the Wizengamot even care what happened to an ex-Death Eater?’ Draco says, his voice lead-heavy with resignation.
Harry feels too full of love - so full that he might burst. He thinks about how he’s already flown through fire for something that was not yet love, but, oh, it was
Draco’s lips lift into a strange, sad little smile. Harry thinks he’s beginning to understand the meaning of that smile, and the unfathomable depths of the place it rises from.
Ginny stands up, mouthing
‘Sorry about that,’ says Smith with a sweetness so artificial it burns. ‘We have to follow all leads we get. Auror protocol and all that. You understand, don’t you, Malfoy?’
His knuckles brush tenderly over the rise of Harry’s cheekbone, and he tucks a lock of hair behind Harry’s ear carefully. Only now does Harry feel the ache of being apart, like the delayed pain of winter-numbed fingers coming back to life over an open fire. Even with the sunlight streaming in from the window, Harry can feel the ghost of Azkaban’s chill clinging to his clothes. He wants to go home, climb under the covers and sleep for days, safe within Draco’s embrace. He gratefully lets Draco ease him into a chair closer to the fireplace.
Narcissa nods, looking down at her cup. She lifts it again, and then sets it down on the tabletop, saucer still balanced in her left hand. ‘I love him so much, you know,’ she says. She lifts her gaze and stares at Harry, her forehead creasing deeply as she leans forward in her seat. ‘Mr. Potter. You must know. I love him more than anything.’
Draco’s living-dining space is cosy and warm, with the sofa tucked away just to the side of the dining table. With a good charm it can stretch to seat six, but tonight the wooden table is set for two. Rugs sprawl out over the carpeted floor, and an array of portraits and photographs hang from the wall. On the furthest side of the room, sliding glass doors open out onto the back garden, where Draco has his herb garden.
‘Harry,’ Malfoy interrupts, lifting up his palms. ‘Breathe. I’m fine. I won’t come near you.’
In the Forest of Dean, on the really bad days, Harry used to stare up at the ceiling of the tent and construct himself an everything-forever-happy-ending. The kind that used to keep him company in the cupboard under the stairs. He used to imagine himself getting happily married to Ginny in the yard behind the Burrow, and then living in a nice house in Godric’s Hollow with three children and a crup, and on Christmas everyone could have as many helpings of pudding as they liked, and all would be well.
Kingsley pours himself another glass and finishes this one in barely a blink of an eye.
- from work.
Harry and Draco take up a place by the entryway, close enough to their friends but far enough to let the families have the front row. The bride and groom make their way onto the floor for the first dance, and a hushed awe falls over the crowd.
‘Alright, what’s this then?’ he asks, nodding his head towards the open bottle of champagne. ‘What’ve I missed?’
Harry shakes his head, trying to rid himself of the strange feeling threatening to creep into his blood. He won’t pity Malfoy. He won’t do it.
‘We started out with charms that would alert the wearer if there was a hex or curse,’ Guy says. ‘Nothing fancy.’
‘Would you like to come in?’ Harry asks Pansy, jerking his head towards the front door.
Harry presses his palm against his sternum, where a faded, pink lightning-bolt spreads branches out toward his ribs - the old Killing Curse blow that helped him win the war. ‘I’ll try and be more careful.’
Warmth bleeds into his cold, empty life. He adopts a cat. He makes friends. He learns how to make potions that clear acne and soothe rheumatoid aches. He learns how to find a space in this new world and its new rules.
‘Pansy, no,’ says Malfoy rather suddenly.
Ron breaks into a vicious grin and slaps Harry on the back - hard. ‘Let’s go save Malfoy.’
He is dressed in indigo, his robes cut severely close to his figure, displaying his height and lean strength, the breadth of his shoulders and the sharp cut of his jaw. A silver starburst rests at the high collar of his robes, shimmering with protective magic. Harry remembers gifting the pendant to Draco last Christmas, wrapping it up in the silent
Harry can see Ron and Hermione on the other side of the ballroom, running, running towards him. Hermione’s dress flaps at her ankles as she crosses the vast expanse between them, faster than he’s ever seen her move in their entire lives.
?’ Ron demands, sounding near hysterical.
This title is also a song! This one’s by Florence and the Machine and it’s called Third Eye.
Draco likes being happy. He works very hard at it. He places the deep well of darkness aside, refuses to live in the bog of his awful past, and instead twists his misery into humour like a jovial flick of the wand at a Boggart. He surrounds himself with lovely things, purges his life of anything that might link back to the Manor, to
- and he haggles shamelessly over the price of antiques at the flea market every week. He was so quiet in England, so subdued, so
But Draco does his best to keep his distance.
Teddy hugs him tightly, whispering an
Artemis meows pointedly and rolls over on Harry’s lap, exposing her white belly.
‘Patients?’ Harry repeats, raising his eyebrows.
Draco tilts his head and studies Harry carefully. The tungsten tint of the lamplight neutralizes the cold silver of his eyes, and it makes them look almost colourless. He looks beautiful in the night. He looks beautiful in the daytime too. It’s funny, how context can change someone’s physical appearance so starkly. Harry doesn’t know how to look at Draco and see
Harry laughs at that thought. ‘Not a chance in hell, mate,’ he says, clapping Ron on the back. ‘Snape was pretty set on hating my face from birth.’ He nods towards the far end of his garden. ‘Fancy taking a gander at the monstrosity Neville got for me as a wedding gift?’
Neville arches his eyebrows. ‘Mate, you’re literally a Defence teacher,’ he says, elbowing Harry in the ribs. ‘You’re telling me you can’t find a spell that will sort it out?’
Draco’s heart is pulped fruit. He holds Hermione’s hand tightly.
As Harry steps through the doorway, the wards welcome him home.
Draco feels a jab of envy and dark sorrow. The ring box burns a hole in his pocket. He ignores it and turns both the ledger and the binder towards Stephen.
when they danced. And then, suddenly, he thinks of the look of steely resolution on Harry’s face as he strode across the ballroom to his would-be-captors - not a man ambushed at all, but a man facing down a long-awaited duel.
‘Oh,’ says Narcissa softly. She looks at Harry, tilting her head slightly. ‘Did Draco tell you to come too? He asks Pansy to come by on weekdays, you see. Did he tell you to visit too, Mr. Potter?’
‘But I held on,’ Harry continues. ‘I stayed alive. For the- the Wispa.’
‘But my hands are not clean,’ Pansy says, flipping her palms over. There are tiny, red half-moons peppered over the soft skin there, from where she dug her nails in too hard. ‘I have done so many terrible things to so many people. I was on the wrong side of the war. Everyone knows it.’
that’s grown between them. Harry’s spent years learning how to pine, he does it so well - he doesn’t know what to do now that Draco’s started looking at him like this, like he wants to reach across the table and taste the garlic and tomato and basil on Harry’s tongue. Like he wants more than a
Harry can’t feel his feet. Every breath is agony. His lungs feel as though they have been pressed in a hundred places with a hot brand. His ribs are broken - his spine too, perhaps, or maybe it’s the blood loss that’s made him lose feeling in his legs. He knows there is a wound in his side - but this has long since grown numb. It has been days - or perhaps years - since the world collapsed on top of him and trapped him here in this hell of dust and crumbling mortar.
‘I didn’t know,’ Harry says, once he remembers how to use his lungs.
Harry feels his ears start to burn. ‘He’s
Draco pulls away, his eyes overly bright. ‘Thank you,’ he says. ‘
Harry pushes down a tide of bitter irritation at Blaise (he’s just doing his job, after all) and helps Draco back into the armchair. He hands Draco his array of potions.
‘Take a look at that and tell me if you see a troubling pattern,’ he says, jerking his chin towards the table. He takes a step back with his arms folded over his chest, allowing for Stephen to scan the figures properly.
Pansy drops into the nearest sofa. She makes to lift her feet up onto the cushions but is stopped by a disapproving glare from Draco.
Draco recognizes the steady footfalls even before he sees Blaise enter the dining room. The Unspeakable is in a fresh change of clothes, his face clean-shaven and his hair perfectly parted. To the casual observer he might look composed, but there is a wild edge to the way he scans the room that Draco recognizes from when Blaise used to stay up all night in their common room, scribbling out papers and drafting application letters to summer apprenticeships.
They’re out with Luna at Daphne at Fortescue’s, when a gaggle of witches stop at their booth on their way out. They’re so young, Harry is certain he’s seen their faces in the Hogwarts graduation ceremony last year. They press up against the table, giggling, pushing copies of last month’s Witch Weekly into Draco’s hands and asking him for his autograph. Draco’s smile is pinched as he complies, but he’s perfectly polite.
Returning to the wizarding world is far harder than he anticipates, but he is grateful to receive any kind of treatment for the spell damage. Goldren is more than Draco deserves, but maybe it is only because Goldren owes Draco’s mother a stack of favours from when they were students together. Draco returns the generosity by working as hard as he can, diligently and without complaint.
Harry loves Draco’s house.
‘Never did like heights,’ Neville says, in that steady, pleasant way he says everything. ‘I was always dead impressed by you in first year, shooting up into the sky like that, even though it was your first time on a broomstick. Makes sense you’d be fine with this place.’
Above, Hermione screams, and both Harry and Malfoy grip each other tightly. The War is a gargantuan, bloated creature that hovers above them, and they are small, helpless, and afraid. Harry knows he is meant to be noble. He is the Chosen One. But his best friend is being tortured, and he doesn’t even have his wand.
‘Eat,’ she says, dropping into the chair opposite him.
The corners of Draco’s lips tighten slightly, and there is a flicker of
Harry finds himself wandering into their restaurant, mostly out of habit, and orders his usual from a young waiter he doesn’t recognize. It’s really been years since he’s been to Paris, and though the bones of the city haven’t changed much, everything else has. He sits at the small circular table, watching the pedestrians hurry home as he feels a hollow in his heart that grows and grows and grows because he knows that he can only linger in memories for so long before he finds himself courting ghosts, and he promised Draco he would stop doing that.
‘I’m sure there were many,’ Harry replies with a crooked smile.
‘Hm,’ Draco intones flatly. He flicks his wand and the pages of the ledger flip forwards, before snapping into place.
The first time Harry meets Daphne Greengrass is at Goldren’s country house in Dorset. Draco’s moving out to Cornwall to open up his own apothecary, so Goldren’s having a big, no-expense-spared party for the newly-qualified Potions Master.
to pick me as your best man. I don’t care how close you are to Uncle Ron or Professor Longbottom or if Aunt Pansy threatens to skin you with a knife. I call dibs.’
There are wildflowers swaying in the night breeze. The soil is damp and a little cold, but it smells like spring - like sap and petals and blossoms and rainwater.
Harry cannot move, cannot even take a single breath without the restraints digging into his ribs. It is ugly. Claustrophobic.
, he texts Harry. His eyes are swollen and heavy from hours of crying.
‘He did,’ Andromeda states flatly. ‘As difficult as it may be for you to comprehend, my cousin was neither villain nor hero. He was just a boy who loved his family, trusted in them deeply. He never thought they would tell him lies, corrupt him, and twist him to their agenda. But they did. They planted rotten seeds in his heart and let them grow.’
Narcissa reminds him strangely of that poor wizard’s portrait. It makes him want to run out of the apartment screaming - but that’s not exactly polite, so Harry sits and drinks his tea and wishes it were something a little stronger.
Acquafredda rises from his seat, buttoning his suit jacket as he does. ‘I will make the coffee,’ he offers. He gestures at the empty chair at the table. ‘Please, sit. You are both exhausted.’
he says, when Harry first reveals the tattoos to him.
Draco knows that Harry is a dangerous, powerful man, with many powerful, intimidating friends. He knows that Albus Dumbledore made Harry that way - moulded him and manipulated him into just the right circumstances, rewarding him when he made the correct connections, gently nudging him away from any less-than-favourable ones.
Andromeda’s lips thin out into a hard line. ‘No,’ she says. ‘I am going to tell you about my cousin. You might not have heard of him,’ she says, casting her gaze over the other members of the Wizengamot. ‘His name was Regulus Black. He was one of the people who helped kill Voldemort.’
’ he pleads. ‘Harry, don’t.’
Ron’s face softens. ‘I know, mate. I know.’
Draco’s skin is pale, and he looks sickly and thin, but his eyes burn with a fury that makes Harry’s heart leap with hope. And then there’s his hands - Draco’s beautiful, long-fingered hands - clenched into angry fists on his lap.
Neville ducks down to give Ginny a smacking kiss on her cheek. ‘I’m on it, babe,’ he promises. He winks once at Harry before heading back into the house through the conservatory.
Even though he’s, well,
‘Hullo Potter,’ Prentis says cheerfully. ‘Petition went well, I take it?’
‘Then we’ll draw a chalk silhouette around their shadow,’ Draco says. ‘If you’ll forgive the metaphor.’
Maybe Robards did it for the money.
‘I work at a bookstore on days I’m not at Goldren’s,’ Malfoy replies. ‘And sometimes I pick up hours bartending. It pays the rent. Keeps me fed. And I don’t have to deal with, you know, the general aversion and disgust people have towards me.’ He gestures at his forearm, where the Mark is hidden under his clothes. ‘As far as the Muggles are concerned, this is just a tacky tattoo.’
