Draco's eyes narrowed. "To be more specific," he said clearly, "if you are going to leave the Hogwarts grounds, talk to me first."
"Yes. Lupin, as a student.  I don't know the details, but I gather it was Sirius's fault, somehow."
"Yeah. It means she's good at throwing rocks."  He gestured over to the heap blocking the continuation of the passage. "She helped me gather the rubble. Anyway, she and Draco and Blaise should be here soon."
Harry nodded. "I thought the Wednesday gathering went well," he offered. "Not as obviously so as the Quidditch players, but...."
"Forget something?" she asked, and he gave a careless shrug.
"Compensate?" Hermione asked doubtfully.
"We should play tonight and add new designs!"  Linnet said, to enthusiastic agreement.
"And we were hoping to open a shop."
"More in the social sense than in academics," he said. "But yes. I mean, learning about people.  That's education too, right?"
"Er, beer?" George said.
"Well put!" Cornelia exclaimed, sounding surprised.
Once they were alone, Dumbledore sat at the table, checked the teapot, tsked, and then gestured to the platter of sandwiches.
"Stop humoring her, Harry."
Harry sighed. "Can we blindfold him for the entrance?"
"Most likely not," Snape responded, raising his large nose. "I have had complaints about your ... 'manipulation' of her. I will continue to reply that Gryffindors are familiar by habit, and allowing a first-year to address you by your given name is probably not unusual for you."
Ron glowered. "Yeah. I can imagine."
"He'd think I didn't want to, or something, instead of just that Draco was being cautious."
," Draco answered sardonically, perching on the arm of nearby chair. "He has an inherent need to do everything in the most difficult manner possible."
"Do you genuinely find me that confusing?"
Tuktuk apparently thought Daphne was fine, but being held again was not. She climbed up onto Daphne's head -- sending Astoria into gales of laughter -- and refused to get down until Draco lifted her off and back to the climbing structure.
lead to this ailment in an uncircumcised man, but even then, it is uncommon, and the Head Boy would hardly be so careless about behaviors unacceptable to the school."
"You can--" Shacklebolt let out a harsh breath.  Harry belatedly regretted the words. "Professor Dumbledore has not mentioned this."
"We appear to have a difference of opinion. Please leave my room."
The 'something' had been a flogger -- but not like any that Harry had ever seen before. This had tails of scarlet leather, with a haft encased in purple suede and bound near the top and bottom with gold braid, and finished at the top with a gold medallion. It was so clearly made for looks that Harry had been afraid it would be useless, but it wasn't. It wasn't harsh, certainly, but it could build up a good sting. Draco's mocking nickname for it had taken a more affectionate tone after Harry had subjected him to a long session with it.
"I apologize," Draco said. "It's only been that bad the last few days, and the tiredness may mean he's trying to do less of it. You do need to talk to him, though."
Harry lifted the bottle slightly. "Would you like some? It's not as good as usual, but it's not bad."
"Oh, really? And did his mother approve this?"
"I was surprised that the door wasn't locked, actually."
Snape's shoulders drew up and in. "And if you bite me?"
"Well," Snape said sourly, "whatever hidden craft got you into Slytherin in two worlds, you had better reach down deep and find it now. You are a person of some interest to many parties, and I
"In case your balance is affected. That apparently varies from person to person."
though."
, for
"Right, mate," Ron said, more darkly. "How'd you get a Slytherin firstie to run messages for you?"
"Let's move."
"Rot!" Pansy exclaimed.
The brewing had taken almost two hours, and Harry, who had forgotten his Charms texts, had to spend the rest of Sunday finishing an essay. Hermione ignored him -- he suspected that she was annoyed that he had been away so long for two days in a row. He came back from meeting Draco on Tuesday in plenty of time to satisfy rules, but got the cold shoulder again.  Afterwards, he lay awake wondering if it would be better if there was an Uncommon Room, and he spent some of his time with Draco where she could be with them.
, on the theory that his blood is also in Voldemort."
Millicent looked at herself in the mirror, stuck out her tongue at her reflection, and then turned her back on it. "Fine," she said. "Let's go."
"Of course," she agreed, and Harry let Draco lead him away.
At dinner, a message arrived from Draco's mother. Harry watched his face intently while he read it, and determined the news could not be terrible.
"Really? I thought I was welcome in your rooms 'at any time.'"
"Clean up the blood," Harry said, as he hobbled past Draco, "then join me in the shower." He felt a pang of regret as the words trailed behind him -- his lover had looked worse than he felt. Still, it did no one any good to muddle rank, not this close to the moon. He would let Draco sleep late, he decided, and make tea for both of them, and curl up with him by the fire; that diminished his standing not at all. Certainly an alpha should provide for his pack.
"Is it what you want?"
"Oh, all right." She sat on the edge of the tub. "So. Kiss."
"I've been doing my best to ignore it. I mean, I know about Zabini. No one can do her best if she's thinking about dying all the time."
McGonagall lifted her head. "I have many more questions for you, Mr. Malfoy, but few pertain to the trial. No, take your seat, for now."
She frowned. "It is your N.E.W.T. year, Mr. Potter, and you are already taking a full schedule.  Your energies might be better spent in revision."
"I'll keep you in sight, Malfoy," Tonks assured them, "but you can go where you want."
"Giles Goyle has been a friend of mine nearly all my life. When he invited my son and me to a social gathering, it was only natural to accept. But then, his portkey brought me to an unexpected location, and I was obliged to watch, hopelessly outnumbered by his loyal servants, while He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named attempted to similarly brand my son." Lucius took in a hard, painful breath, and Harry watched with growing hatred a performance that might have convinced him had he not known better.
Her attention definitely sharpened at that. "Including supplemental reading?"
"Why are

didn't leave her out of it!"
The visit was unremarkable in any way Harry could define, but he could see how Remus was watching Draco, even while the Quiris charmed him. In return, Draco watched him, but had little to say afterwards, except that Lupin had been better to him as a person than to him as a Slytherin student.
"Draco?" he asked.
Draco, who was just settling between Harry's legs, snorted. "I'm glad you finally realized that, Harry. Perhaps we can get along, now."
His stomach, never its steadiest after a change, clenched alarmingly as the pull of the Portkey ebbed and their kitchen appeared around them. They usually stayed near Stag's Run Lodge, but Draco had been uneasy about this change and had insisted on an island. Draco had also attacked him, Harry recalled, straightening. Before he could turn, the banked fire in the grate flared green, and someone burst through.

Letter, bed, and room vanished. He was on his knees in the shared space by the tent door, a blade flashing to his side as the point of a sword hit the tent floor, and Hermione, rage and horror mixing on her face, lifted it again.
Harry did his best not to show his growing rage. "Professor Snape's too, I expect," he said, almost lightly.
Several people whooped.
The unexpectedly high voice made him jump. "Um..."  He looked around. Malfoy was a girl again. "I, uh, missed you changing."
Harry nodded. "I think-- I know you two don't get along, but I think you should talk with Draco."
Harry came up behind him, his hands rising to Draco's chest.
"But you were able to explain these to his satisfaction?"
"Draco!" Narcissa's fork clattered onto her plate. "You haven't!"
Smirking, Blaise leaned forward to look past Millicent. "So, Harry," he called, "have you ever
the Gryffindor touch. You were starting to worry me. Should I take the tunnel in?"
"That door." Draco pointed across the room.  "It comes out in the dungeons."
Harry laughed uncomfortably. "My complete lack of experience."
Potter seemed to be plotting. Draco couldn't imagine any other reason for the evaluating look he was getting. "Do you know Octavius Lincoln?" he asked suddenly.
Harry shook his head. "Fine. It's not like I'm relying on her for anything."
are the Parselmouth, darling," Draco answered mockingly.
Draco's statement was quiet, but definite. Harry looked at him, confused.
The sentence curved a little bit up at the end, but then, the stone sill wasn't the best writing surface.
"I think I'll go up to Gryffindor," he said. "I have a letter to write before dinner."
affect where you go from there. If I'd accepted Slytherin, for example, I probably would have been a better student, but I would have stayed far more secretive, and become sneakier."
That produced a buzz of reaction. Harry wondered what she was playing at.
"Two older sisters," Gilbert explained.
Harry nodded. "Probably. Shall I send him?"
"Not in detail," Ron said, looking between them, and Harry sighed.
she said.
Ginny's hand darted forward. "Just practice," she said. "I was flattered." She glanced to Gilbert's chair. "And like Gilbert said, I thought I was supposed to. Color?"
"Nothing, fuck," Harry agreed incoherently, promising himself he'd figure that out later. "Let me go, Draco.  Please."
"Mm-hm," Harry agreed, running his tongue over the salty skin. "'M not."
"Well." Harry shrugged. "It's something we fought about, early on. He couldn't see why I did, and I said it was important to me that shopkeepers have money to live on. He has trouble understanding how that matters, unless someone makes him think about it."
As Harry was hurrying towards the restricted section of the shop, a large bulk suddenly cut into the stacks in front of him. He dodged as best he could, but there was little leeway. He didn't fall down, or lose the cloak, or crush Susara, but he crashed into the other person, who lurched forward, spilling books on the floor around him. She dove down to gather them -- it was Millicent Bulstrode, he realized -- slammed bruisingly into his legs, and froze.
"Good." After casting a warming spell on the sofa, and charming the fire alight, Harry undid his trousers, let them fall, and stepped out of them. He sat down, conscious of the feel of the plush cushions against his bare arse and thighs. His shirt and jumper felt peculiarly solid.
Severus took a deep breath. "I want your promise," he said, turning to Harry. "Your promise that neither of you will bite me."
"Well, Snape came with me--"
“Wha’ hap’n?”
"What is
"I see." Horsyr smiled slightly. "Beyond summer essays?"
rather a lot of glass for them to break. Are there really Slytherins who don't know Dark Arts?"
"You had no right to send me a Howler."
"Please!" Hermione said, her voice quick with eagerness. "I never did get to meet one."
The talons descended on his last sausage and grabbed it, the bird lifting heavily off at Ron's exclamation.  It flapped across the room to settle behind Draco and tear into its prize.
"When you stop speaking perfectly."
Harry was tempted to run straight down to room fourteen, but he didn't want to show up smelling of the Knight Bus and the artificial scents of Petunia Dursley's air freshener. Draco valued appearances, and if Draco was going to tell him to leave, he would at least do it with regret.  Instead, Harry bathed and dressed as nicely as possible, in clothes he had bought while in Hogsmeade with Draco. He chose the loose-legged black trousers, and the silk shirt that had once been red and gold, but was now green, black, and gold. Susara flowed reassuringly around his neck before disappearing under the silk to settle around his arm. When he checked the clock, it was quarter to seven already. He went back to the mirror, and tried to decide if he was ready for dinner with Draco.
"Oh. Are you--" Harry caught himself. "In the last world, it was announced on some wireless show that he had been apprehended and killed trying to resist arrest. Not here?"
"Very good, Draco. Yes." He straightened.  "Willingly given, I might add, by the Far Friar, so if he looks a bit thinner this week -- thinner in the sense of a soup, that is -- refrain from comment."
"Here's an idea!" he said. "Maybe I could get the headmaster to open the mixed house space for Christmas. Anyone who wanted to could open presents there, and we could play games all together if we want."
Harry laughed. "I may have overstepped. But I'm not scrubbing cauldrons the entire time."
Harry had not thought about it that way. He wanted to protest that people always believed whatever they wanted of him, but wasn't the point of this year to change that? "I know that," he said instead. "I mean, I've realized it. I did make that mistake last year, but I've been trying to be careful, this time."
. Harry closed on her as a hunter, even while some tiny part of his mind was cataloguing her as Hermione and as someone he loved. His hand, about to seize her shoulder and pull, jerked back. It itched to move forward again.
"Yes, but something was wrong with the last one.  Drink this."
Harry grinned. "Draco put some work into it, earlier in the week."

"And that's why people who know about this think that it worked. You lived."

Pain seared like the Cruciatus curse through Harry’s legs and mind, and Aunt Petunia was shrieking over Hecksban’s incantation. Harry clamped his mouth shut on his own reflexive scream. Hot pain turned to pure heat, obscuring both sound and vision.
She laughed, a little raggedly, and dabbed at her eyes. "Poor dear. Did Remus really talk to you?"
"Yes, but that doesn't change-- Oh, never mind! The Head Boy just ought to
She studied him for a moment. "Oh. Well, sorry, then." Uncomfortably, she looked around the space. "So we should pick up the rocks?"
"But Sphinx feathers," Hermione said grimly, "are illegal for trade." Harry expected the two of them had fought over this the night before.
Draco's teasing manner subsided. "I know you
Draco and Parkinson made almost identical eyerolls at his lack of breeding, but Bulstrode gave a nod that looked something like approval.
"Yeah, well, Snape got tired of me." Harry crossed to the case of wine and pulled out a bottle. "Which of these do you think I'd like better?"
"So that's good? Just in past where it's tight?"
Harry woke. He had thrashed free of the covers and was freezing cold. Draco, who knew better than to touch him in such a state, was standing clear of the bed, wrapped in a blanket, saying his name, urgently and steadily, again and again.
"It's an impossible question," he answered, as a House Elf appeared and snapped her fingers. Soup appeared in each bowl.  "It's like asking if I'm afraid of people. Nagini was terrifying, when I was tied up. Most snakes aren't."
"Now that you're not avoiding us!"
Tom waved a hand in dismissal. "I'll have it sent up. Close up that cloak, Mr. Potter, and I'll show you to your room."
"Oh." Harry swallowed hard. He couldn't object to this. His self here wouldn't object. There wasn't any reason to, was there?  "Um...."
-- and it's not just
Harry repressed a snort only out of a sense of the dignity of occasion. He looked towards Draco, expecting to share a moment of amusement -- surely no one would believe such tripe -- but Draco sat stiffly, lips pressed in a tight line.
Harry, tugging his trousers over to where he was sitting, grinned.  "Maybe we just needed an excuse to go for it."
Standing, Draco stretched again, lengthening his lean body. He wasn't as bulky as Sirius Black, but he was young, and quick, and a werewolf.  "Having made your plea," he said, "
enjoy that, and it doesn't mean anything's wrong with you, and I brought something to show I'm sorry for not trusting you."
Sirius stiffened, almost knocking over the chair beside him. "Regulus."
"Well, as I was saying," Neville resumed, darting nervous glances at Hermione, "you can't take it more than twice a month, and I think it would be worse if my mind worked that way twice a month.  More frustrating, I mean. And I'd be ..." He looked down. "You know.  Tempted."
Draco smirked. "That is not far off, in some regards. His previous self is in there too. Strange that he chose his Muggle parent rather than the witch. That weakens his link to Salazar Slytherin's line by a generation, now that I think about it."
"Please?"
Octavius didn't know -- or shouldn't know -- that he was under investigation. The only way it all made sense was if Octavius was guilty, and Malfoy was involved.
"Some," he said coyly, making her giggle and Ron scowl.
Biting his lip, Ron nodded.  Deciding Draco required no assistance, Harry strolled over to the sideboard. He was met there by Millicent. She stood so close that he could feel the heat of her body up the line of his right side.
Harry moved to the side of the steps and leaned back against the vibrating train. It didn't quite obscure the strange, queasy feeling of the Polyjuice starting to wear off. "How do you know I'm not the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher?" he challenged.
"You don't think we should ask Madame Pomfrey--"
"I expect you deal with 'that' at least once a day."
Sunday, Harry was busy with the intensive Apparation class, held in a tent just outside the Hogwarts gates. He was glad to avoid wandless magic with Snape. By next week, he hoped, Draco would have smoothed things over with his spellfather. When he asked before their session with McGonagall, which she had moved until evening, Draco told him that he had sent Severus a letter, saying that he valued his support and suggesting that they dine together on Monday.
"We were wondering if this drinking thing was entirely made up."
"And throwing a wine bottle at the wall?"
"As if they would!" Cornelia scoffed.
"Not so much so as to track me down when you got on the train."
"Seamus. He greeted me
Harry felt his face twist in wry humor. "Not willingly.  Umbridge made me write lines."
"In any case, we're not inviting her now. Should we invite Weasley without her?"
Draco looked like he was going to argue, but a group of fifth and sixth year Slytherins emerged around the curve of the staircase, and he shifted to a lighter tone. "I need to get my broom. Wait outside, this time?"
"Here," he said, lifting it up from what appeared to be a fuzzy copy and handing the original back to Harry. "Draco may look on with you, and I will make any necessary notes on the duplicate."
"It seems ... wrong. And look. We're seventeen. We have no idea what it's like to have a relationship outside of school." That was it, he realized. "It might not even work."
Horsyr, Harry."
"As you wish." Draco wrapped a leg over Harry's, pulling their lower bodies closer together. "You look so hot with my cock in your mouth. Like that, don't you?"
"It was just in front of you," Harry protested. "We know who we are, right?"
Draco shrugged and took a moment to chew and swallow. "Linnet is definitely interested in speaking to you about current events, but she's never been a real partisan. Blaise came to me privately to say that he intended to stay neutral as long as possible, but that he no longer discounted your potential in the upcoming conflict."
"I don't think I want a Slytherin," she said quietly, "but a Ravenclaw might be nice."
"Of course not!" Harry decided that he shouldn't let on about Snape. Maybe Dumbledore might have chastised him with it? "I was
Hermione's shoulders slumped forward. "I suppose not. I do worry about you, though, and you can't tell me I shouldn't."

“Sorry,” he said. “No idea where that came from.”
"I'm not sure I believe this is a good idea," he said. "If it wasn't you...."

"And your house is Hogwarts?" Harry asked.

"Get back here!"
"How kind of you to say so."
Millicent gestured for the bowl. Linnet and Blaise each snagged a bead as it went past.
so often."
"All girls care, Harry," Hermione said, and with a wry smile, added, "even me."
As he sliced the pie in two, Draco nodded. "Of course. Apples are the best fruit for maturity elements in potions, for example, and blood ties to the person it came from, as well as to life in general. You can't see that, but it's there."
Draco straightened. With a glance at Harry, he said, "the classification spells are useful, but no guarantee of safety. You should still have at least a partner present for the technique that we tried."
"Who's the other man?" Harry asked Leroy, ignoring Cartwright's huff.
"Do you really want to be a man, though?" he asked. "Or just to avoid being married off?"
Silenced, the twins looked at each other. Harry felt suddenly awkward. "It was -- Draco feels I can use Voldemort's blood guilt against him, and build a protection. Remus thought the theory was sound, but he doesn't want me to do it until I leave school. He's afraid I'll go looking for trouble, or something, but really, Voldemort has found me enough times that I'd like to be prepared."
"Let me guess: Divination, Potions, and Herbology?"
"I'd been going to suggest it tomorrow," Seamus said, but Draco shook his head.
"Which hasn't changed."

"Frequent contact there came later. It would depend on the time of the casting."
least friendly classmates were never invited to go on about my escapades in court."
"Er, hi?"
"If it makes you feel any better, I'm having trouble with her too."
Harry shrugged. "Nah. I ran into a ... an acquaintance and put on my cloak to see what he was up to."
"Have you ever tried memory enhancing potions?"  Harry asked. "I was reading about gargoyle dust, this summer...."
"You're gone all the time!"
"Well, he thought I knew he was interested in me, for example. And I didn't, but I'm kind of clueless sometimes. I mean, it was Seamus that told me, and I think Hermione knew, so he can't have been exactly unreadable." Harry didn't want to be taking about this. "Do you know who the new Defense against the Dark Arts teacher is?"
obvious as a couple, then?"
Draco smiled brightly. "I had thought elderflower presse and pumpkin juice for non-alcoholic beverages, but now that I think of it, we might want--" He stopped. "Herpo!"
"Of my last time trying against you. In front of everyone."
Harry considered that. Though technically a curse, the spell did no long term damage, according to the text and to Snape. If he lifted it before leaving, his subject would not be harmed. Slowly, he nodded, and then looked keenly up. "Why wait?"
was an extended hoax meant to discover how long a respected Quidditch publication would pay for nonsensical gibberish written by a famous ex-pro Seeker. Harry was of the camp that that thought Patrick had taken a Bludger too many to the head, but if you could manage to figure out what he was trying to describe, the advice was always good.
He shook his head. "No, though I am still annoyed about that, to be honest. It's-- Remember how we'd talked about telling Draco, in September?"
"Biting fairy," Hermione said quickly. "They're poisonous."
memory. I knew certain things would please you, and how to do them, but I still don't remember doing it before." He turned his head to look at Draco. "When did we first do that? Was it like that?"
"If you wish. If you want to veto any one of them, you may, with sufficient reason."
Ron rolled his eyes. "So, what are we doing, this time?" he asked pointedly. "You said something about a focus-enhancing potion?"
He continued to push and twist, until the grip around his fingers gradually eased. "Lie still, now." Leaning over, Harry reached for his clothes and pulled out his wand. At the current height of the bed, he'd be on his toes the whole time. "I'm going to bring this down a few inches."
“Land against coast, I think,” Sophia interjected. Harry had never heard a political word from her before. “What we can’t see doesn’t matter, of course.”
Draco smirked. "Quite true, but you're still nice," he said, making Harry shove into him hard.
He was just at the fifth floor landing when he heard Hermione say his name. He paused, and turning, saw Hermione and Ginny getting to their feet in the corridor. Ginny beckoned him, and he left the staircase and walked over.
There was a flash of something in Snape's eyes -- approval? interest? -- but his voice was bland. "I will consult on theory, discreetly."
"Brilliant," Millicent breathed. "Where does it go?"
"Draco! Do you
"Understood, sir."
Harry laughed. "In Slytherin, maybe." He leaned back against the blue sofa. "So ... Julian Devary?"
did you tell about the curse?"
"I was just remembering...." He had to think how to phrase this so Draco would understand he wasn't reluctant to do more. "The first time we kissed, it felt so dangerous. And now it doesn't."
"Of course, it doesn't do to say so, so I usually don't, because arguing is unpleasant and takes too much time and I'm not good at it, sadly, but it's good to get a fresh perspective, now and then, and people without Wizarding upbringings come out with such unique ideas. Some of them are rot, of course, but then there's things like the ink that turns a different color if you spell a word wrong, which I'm told is--"
"You truly intend to slay him?" she asked Harry. For the first time since the Seeing, she sounded rational.
He had said the right thing.  Both of them smiled. Harry managed not to sigh. He supposed he had better work on his Charms assignment until then, and hope that Draco was free tomorrow. The ceiling of the Great Hall was clouded by grey sleet.
"Hm. No, I suppose not." In a sudden move, Draco brought his still cupped hand to Harry's erection, and smeared what was left all over it, so that the excess dripped down to the edge of his thighs and down the cleft of his bollocks into the crack of his arse. After four tight, fast strokes, he pulled away, scrambled over Harry's lap, and snugged up against the arm rest. The book on the side table was quickly lowered to the floor and he lay his chest across it, raising his bum. The lines from Harry's belt were even more impressive now.  Harry admired them while he positioned the head of his cock.
Seamus and Parvati were still there, Seamus watching with a distinct smirk, and Parvati looking anxious.
"Yeah."
"Gah!" Harry shoved his hands back through his hair. "I brought you down here because that part was
"Oh."
"But...." Draco twisted the soft bread in his hands -- "why correspond with me? If it wasn't for.... I suppose I thought of it as closure."
"Mr. Potter." His head lowered, either in respect, or to avoid Legilimency. Harry could hear his heart racing, but the stink of fear and unwashed human overpowered anything else scent might have told him.
"Oh hush!" Harry said crossly. He looked at Yolanda. "I've been spending my time in the mixed-house sitting room, when it's open. To support it, you know."
"Caligula's Cauldron."
"Lovely to meet you, Gentian." Harry bowed, and then grinned. "But I really do have to run. See you later!"
He looked at the beads, and thought.
"We're adults."
"Very well," she said. "I have never taken a lover -- in the broadest sense, just romance and just sex both count -- whom I felt to be inadequate."
The assigned text was indecipherable, and Draco didn't show up to lunch. Harry scowled at his plate.  As if having a
She thought he could handle this, obviously, but he couldn't see why. Even with Veritaserum resistance potions....

Draco smirked. "We're actually
"Oh?"
"We cannot provide names," Draco warned. "We have a minor privacy charm, just to prevent making such disclosures accidentally, and there is agreement among us that invitees are not provided with that information in advance."
"It does seem inadvisable," Gilbert agreed.
"Cold?" Harry asked.
"Oh, it was about us --"

"Do you have a problem with that?"
Harry laughed, as if Snape were not brooding like a vulture between them.  "Would I notice?"
things.  He can be useful. If I can't defeat Voldemort, my N.E.W.T.s don't matter, do they?"
Everyone understood that wasn't a good thing. Ron shuddered.
"Oh?"
"Okay. I'll try to be more precise. But anyway, I don't really understand why you did it. I mean, wouldn't that be too long to wait? It turns out not to have been, I suppose, but I can't imagine putting that much effort to something that would kill him fifteen to twenty years from now. Isn't that like saying you'll live with it until then?"
"Friends," Harry said quickly.  "Right? You trust me?"
Breakfast hadn't arrived yet, so Draco, with a brush of his hand along Harry's shoulder, left to talk to other people in the room.  Harry tried not to watch him. When Dumbledore stood at the head of the table, cleared his throat, and asked for people to take their seats, Harry was surprised to see Draco speaking to McGonagall. He was perhaps less surprised to see him passing back a section of the
The corridors were empty. It was certainly past time that he should be in Gryffindor, if not his own dormitory. He wondered if most people would be asleep when he got back. He didn't really feel like dealing with any of them tonight. And he certainly didn't want to admit that he'd been off consorting with the enemy at their victory party -- not when it was entirely his fault that Gryffindor had lost. Maybe, he thought, he could just refuse to say where he had been. Most people would probably assume he'd been off sulking on his own. That was
"Mm," Draco murmured. "It doesn't have to be real -- Snape, I mean." He tilted his head back as Harry licked his neck. "It can just be our fantasy."
He looked at Mrs. Weasley, who was now smiling at him, and the twins, who just seemed to be making the normal amount of trouble, considered how much
"Yeah. It looked like a Friday with no food."
"Nothing's wrong, but there
She shrank back. "I saw his body."
The hot water sluicing over his stressed muscles felt wonderful. The shower had been designed with a rail and cushioning spells, so he didn't have to worry about falling. He had a good life, he thought -- much better than most people in his condition, even now. Draco joined him just as he finished with his hair.
“I shall stay until lunch,” Draco said. “I’m best able to skip Potions and explain later.”
"Oh, you can't go!"
After a moment of shocked silence, Millicent burst out laughing, closely followed by Ginny and -- to Harry's surprise -- Linnet.
"Yes, we wouldn't want any trouble. But we trust your discretion, of course."
a party. I forgive you the offense against my family, Mr. Parkinson. I'm sure it will have quite have slipped my mind by the end of the evening."
"I don't trust people to do anything!" Harry snapped.
expect owls can be followed, I'm not receiving them, so there's no way
"That's mad!" Harry exclaimed, shocked.
"I don't want to be stopped," Draco answered fiercely. "Cloak, Harry. Be a bold Gryffindor in the morning."
Hecksban nodded again. "Generally, yes. However, if your mental construct is strong enough without it, the sketching is unnecessary, so in that sense, Harry is more than half right." He smiled brightly at the class and drew his wand. "To start out, however, you will all use drawing, whether you think you need it or not. Like so...."
They had reached the end of the things Harry had agreed to talk about, and he had managed to keep from saying that Sirius was an animagus, even though that had been harder than he had expected. He hoped Tonks gave him the antidote right away.
"Right."
"And your house is?"
"Mill...."
"Children's thing," Draco whispered to Harry.
And he was obligingly gentle. Too obligingly, Harry decided, after a long time of a gentle twist of two, then three fingers. He couldn't say it wasn't good; he wasn't even bored, really, but the strain of
"That was a week ago!" Severus protested, and Harry managed not to laugh. It was minutes until moonrise -- he could feel the queasy shifting of his innards as it neared -- and he couldn't blame Severus for being afraid.
"Would I be trying if I didn't?"
"You know, it wasn't his fault," Harry told him, as he sat down.
Harry groaned. "Not by half. Maybe I'll avoid Gryffindor for the rest of the weekend."
"Good." Harry scooped up his bag. "Let's go back to Gryffindor before Hermione comes after us."
"Divination." He bit his lip. "We didn't have formulas then -- Draco just sent me a list of things that might be useful and that he couldn't get by owl order."
is with his solicitor, and I want you gone by the time he comes out."
"You'd be stuck supporting us for years."
"Where? The Shrieking Shack is a bit out of the way."
"You do?" He couldn't see how she could.
"He has not yet made a report in person; indeed, he has scarcely been present. The death of Mr. Parkinson has left us both rather busy, and in different ways. However, that is not a matter for you. More to the point, I am encouraged that your skill is growing to accommodate your power."
at what is otherwise hidden."
"Um, no, a Slytherin, but he thought it was a very Hufflepuff predicament."
Draco shifted impatiently. Thornton was supposed to meet him with the new team uniforms at the end of practice, and everyone else had already left.  The boy was probably dallying just to be irritating. He strode to the door, but before he could look outside, the object of his annoyance appeared in front of him.
"Oh," Ron said, "it's also poisonous.  The henbane, I mean. After you put it down, you should use a cleaning charm on your fingers."
interviews -- saying the Ministry needed to authorize an independent investigation. Without that, do you think anyone would have gone to Azkaban?"
Draco turned, but before they could start to kiss, there was another sharp crack. Draco and Harry twitched apart, and twisted to find Dobby standing between two of the chairs, with a stack of house banners and a ball of ivy cuttings floating in front of him.
Harry continued to touch him while he thought. "Here and there," he answered, "but not much, really. I expect if I had met Draco Three, he'd be more like you, but even then... I mean, you just mentioned Azkaban. You went through that. You endured months of serving Voldemort, and you were in the thick of the Battle of Hogwarts. You didn't get away from the whole mess and live with your lover and his guardian and learn how to be an arctic fox."
"What an imagination, Potter."
"I don't--" Severus tried, but Draco was already working shampoo through the thick mess and into his scalp. Lazily, Harry slid a hand up and helped a little with the back of his neck. Severus made a strangled noise and pressed against him.
Tonks stiffened, a small frown line creasing her forehead. "I doubt the Fey would care about such details of human society."
"Bind me," Draco said raggedly. "Flog me. Take away my sight, my wand. Tell me what to do."
"Stay clear!" his voice echoed back from the Common Room. Standing was impossible. Harry crumpled to his knees. "Emergency!"
"Don't be silly. I
"Of course! He won't learn anything until he realizes that what he knows is wrong."
Padma coughed. Seamus snorted. In seconds, everyone was laughing, including Harry. Every time he started to get over it, he met someone's eyes and imagined the confusion that would result from people trying to decide what they all had in common, and he would start to laugh again. It was quite some time before the general hilarity subsided.
"Skyberries. In the Forbidden Forest. It would be something useful you can do with that skill on a broom, rather than wasting it all on foolish sport."
She nodded thoughtfully. "I can do that. Not in his dormitory, obviously, but in the Common Room and in the corridors. Will you keep him from reporting me? If I need to be out late brewing?"
While he was reaching for a tart, a school owl landed by his fork.
"Right, but since
"How's Gryffindor?" she asked.
Miranda grinned, her teeth looking large in her child's face. "Sir. You are influential, a brilliant dueler, keen, and as unstoppable on a case as a Krup after an Erkling -- everyone says so -- but I don't know that you're much of a curse-breaker."
"Inadequate," Draco retorted, his voice brittle. "Even were she not, Harry is non-negotiable. I will not say it again."
They talked idly about Quidditch in different sorts of weather for a while, until Harry noticed that Ron had fallen silent.
Draco sniffed. "I'll tell Gilbert he has nothing to worry about."
, exactly; it's Draco's plan for Friday evenings in the Uncommon Room."
"Yes,
"Ooo!" With a little shiver of delight, she looped up into the air and down again. "In a week, then!" In a quivering flash, she was gone down the drain.
?" Draco's suggestion hauled Harry back to the present. "Severus Snape, moody, domineering bastard, won't wash?"
Taking a long, deep breath, she nodded. "
"And?" Harry prompted, stretching his stride over a prominent root.
"Harry's right," Ginny said. "Pin it on him." With a curt nod, she sat back. "So -- you decided Ron should try this divination?'
"Talking," Draco repeated caustically. "About what? Dark Arts?"
"Do you deny it?"
"So, yeah, we'll be telling everyone to show up."
what did he do?"
As he related the publicly consumable account of his interrogation to Ron and Hermione, he noticed that Ron wasn't the only one he needed to talk to. Seamus and Neville had been joined by Cornelia, and when Parvati walked past their spot, Seamus looked away so sharply that Harry was afraid he would hurt his neck. Scanning past Parvati, he found Ginny by the tapestry of a griffin fighting a knight. She frowned pointedly, mouthing something Harry couldn't understand.
"And you didn't 'drag us' in here," Ginny said.  "It's voluntary."
Meeting his eyes, Harry smiled. Draco made a toast like he was casting a spell. "To us," he said simply, his glass meeting Draco's, and they both took a ritual sip of the amber liquid.
"Denied. Continue, Professor Snape."
might feel betrayed. He had thought that was intended for him. He didn't want to rehash what had happened -- not with all these people around them. Setting a hand on hand on Ron's shoulder, he steered him forward. "Hermione's right about the hitting though. We're too old for that, and I shouldn't have, no matter what you said. Now let's get dinner."
to undo this curse, really?
Draco's attention shot to him like tacks to a magnet.  Harry crossed his arms over his chest. He hadn't realized that Hermione was still worried about that. "I can't tell you."
"I mean -- before it was like you'd put the glamour on
"Mother," Draco greeted her.
Harry drew out to go in again, and this time, Draco moved into the push.
. Talk to me tomorrow morning."
"It's not true!"
"I think that's an excellent idea," Draco said smoothly, with a quick, quelling look at Harry. "If he acts,
"Oh. I implied you might be with Draco?" Her voice rose nervously, muddling the tone. "But they'd guess that. You know they would."
Harry closed his eyes.
"No."
"Not as something he did," Seamus said, reaching for the porridge, "but he should know by now that you need more care."
"Where does it go? You never mentioned."
"Yes!"
"Well, you certainly haven't made it easier!
to tell Professor Dumbledore," he said carefully. His eyes rolled to look at Draco. "But Malfoys is having bad secrets--"
"It was easier for me," Jacob volunteered. "I could tell he was lying to me, so I listened when he was with Dad, until I knew enough to pretend I knew more, and then I got the rest out of him."
"When you're a man."
“I understand.” Harry wasn’t willing to think about think about anyone’s bits, at the moment. Just as it was occurring to him to worry that this might be about ‘taint’, instead, Draco leaned into him.
"Mm. Well, dinner is a stew. It can sit. We'll start in the hallway, just before he should be leaving the bath, and one of us can charm the door not to reclose."
Ron's words were scarcely audible. He was still looking at the red flickers in the blackened wood. Harry lowered his voice again.  "Look, Ron, I know it was Malfoy, sort of, but he -- she -- our girl -- she was hot." He let out an involuntary breath. "Very hot, once I got those clothes off. And it was just ... It felt amazing." He forced a shrug. Ron didn't see it. "I'm going to bed." Resolutely, Harry headed for the staircase. At the first step he looked back. Ron was still standing by the fireplace, but staring at him, now. Harry grinned. "I'm shagged out. Honestly."
Draco squirmed back off the table, reaching with his bare feet for the floor. His trousers slid to his ankles, but he ignored them as he dropped to his knees, and then forward onto his hands. The blindfold stayed on.
money until Malfoy got to you."
"Speaking of which, she is concerned about her son's attachment to you."
Snape drew himself up. "It does, however, mean that outside of school, he is subject to no one else's whims. We discussed this with Professor Dumbledore,
now. All these
"Hey!"
Harry winced. "Have I been that bad?"
Harry noted. "And then?"
"Right. I'll believe it when you show it."
At the upper dungeon level, Harry stopped to query Draco in the Liber Geminus, while Hermione watched with interest. He followed the course Draco described, and came to Blaise lounging against the corridor wall. His face lit up when he saw them.
into a hospital cot. People were shouting to get Madame Pomfrey, and bring her back!”
"Oh, let me help," Parvati said, jumping up, and making Harry feel rather foolish for not having thought of that himself.
Tucking the book away, he started down the stairs, telling himself it was the best choice. Hermione would be upset that he hadn't come to her first, but a detour to the library would take too long, and might cause him to run into Ron, or worse yet, Seamus. As he was thinking about this, he became aware of light footsteps approaching quickly from below.
Ginny giggled. "Oh, I was thinking a duel between Draco and my brother!"
. "Sirius?" he asked.
Draco looked unhappy, but he hadn't set his chin for a fight. "Yes. However, I still think you should have consulted me. And this summer I plan to host a party that is mine."
“That was neutral though.”
"Right." Harry cleared his throat. "Someone could do better at trials, of course. I mean, I need to choose the candidate who's best for the team. But you should get in some practice."
"Harry!" Remus said brightly, turning from conversation with Hagrid. "Here at last!" More coolly, he nodded a greeting to Draco. "Mr. Malfoy."
Harry, much to the distress of the twins, nodded.
"Ow! What was--?"
"Not -- just when I woke up, she wasn't around. Just now."
"Why would I bother with Muggle technology?" Draco sneered.
Draco's nose wrinkled. "Why on earth would she blame you? But yes, Auror Shacklebolt said there will be a heavy Auror presence, considering. Mother would not hear of not attending." He looked idly out over the space below them. "I might send an owl to Tonks, on my own. She--" He tensed, his hand going to his wand. "Someone's -- Oh. It's McGonagall."
"Circe!" Gilbert swore. "How did you survive?"
"Am I?" Snape asked coolly. "The Muggles won't notice. I am surprised that you do."
to make you cry."
The food may have been what others were eating in the Great Hall, but dinner felt very different. The first oddity was that there was a carafe of wine, from which Snape poured a glass for each of them. More unsettling was the decorum of it. Professor Snape's manners were sharply meticulous, and Draco's thoughtlessly gracious, and Harry knew he had to behave more politely than he was accustomed to. However, when he asked for a platter of beef that he could easily have reached, his forbearance was rewarded by an approving nod from Draco, and he settled down more comfortably.
"I'll
will ask me to dance?"
For a while, they studied, Draco helping Harry with Potions, and Harry helping Draco with Transfiguration. Eventually, however, Harry yawned and stretched.
He sighed dramatically. "Really! In any sensible world you'd be a Ravenclaw. Everyone says so. How do you manage to be a Gryffindor in three?"
"Not if it's clipped in, and the charm is targeted," Draco contributed, shoring up the misdirection.
Again, that look.
not one who would take offense, Granger," Gilbert retorted. "But even at this year's ball, I saw more than a few strident 'pureblood means pure' types at Malfoy Manor, and at least three people that I suspect are active Voldemort supporters."
Millicent shushed him with the wave of one meaty hand. "Ask away, Granger."
And he did, he thought, as he walked away. Potter, of course, had Creevey, as he had Thornton, because scholars in their N.E.W.T. year -- or even their O.W.L. year -- no longer had time to run foolish errands. However, he intended to have Thornton seen tailing Potter -- and Thornton
, Weasley."
"All right," Sammy said, raising his chin as he looked back at Harry. "I'll go, even if none of the others do."
Padma rolled her eyes. "
Draco sniffed. "I believe we knew that as well."
"Draco wasn't with you, so don't claim you were just hiding from me! I ran into him an hour ago, and he had no idea where you were either."
"That could be all right."
"I don't know what they're called. Sirius sent them to me, and said there were games, but I've never learnt any."
into place in a warm, soft bed, somewhere with no light at all."
"No."
"That might be the best one to use on him, too," he said thoughtfully. "If I'm careful about wrap, I can work him up slowly."
"I love you," Harry whispered. He Summoned the matching sheepskin from the other side of the bed and covered Draco with it. He rubbed his arm gently, but rather than lying beside him and cuddling him as he would usually do, he came up into a ready crouch, his eyes boring into Severus, who was beyond pretending not to watch.
"But you didn't use one."
“Everyone needs a little help sometimes,” she answered reasonably. “Carla is shy.”
"I'll bring it up with Professor McGonagall," Parvati offered.
"If you don't mind? It almost feels like it's ending already, though I know it's not really over until June. But this would be our last time to be ... well, just us."
"And Auror Mason, of course."
He looked again.
"Vaguely. It was wonderful, but..."
"God, no." Harry had to close his eyes for a moment, remembering the first press of Draco One's fingers
"But Miss Tonks has a valuable observation," Draco pointed out. "What if the point was actually to
"That's how I'd like to wear it."
"Dumbledore might just be trying to force me to come and talk to him."
"Sorry," Harry repeated. "I won't again -- unless it
"Likes, not
"But--"
The cupboard turned out to be along a perpendicular corridor, but still backed up against the left wall.
"Um...." She blushed. "Well, one person states that they've never done something, and if they're lying, they take a drink -- everyone has drinks -- and so does everyone else who's done it."
"This trainee --" Draco reached past him to secure the paper chain to the headboard -- "just how fond of her are you?"
Ron snorted. "True enough. The right person happened to be Harry."
"Not from Draco," Harry added quickly. "Draco was shocked. It was on my own." Snape wasn't something he felt required to confess to, especially with his godfather already upset.
of ... for example, your robes. So when they moved, the real cloth would show through, because the glamour didn't track. The same thing with your arm, last week. I'd see the real thing if you moved fast, as if you'd cast the charm on the air above your skin, rather than on your whole arm."
"A few times."
was it," Hermione said tartly, and Draco conceded with a graceful shrug.
The remaining man dove for his wand and followed.
"Well, he knows that you took me to the seer, of course. If you're willing to consult with me on divinatory potions, may I let him know?"
"No."
Draco met Harry’s eyes. Harry was remembering last year’s list of curses. They needed to do
Draco let out a long breath and sent Harry a friendly smile. The whole room seemed to lighten. "There. Let's move to the table.  Had we finished our argument?"
"My godfather sent me a set last spring, with a letter saying it had amused him in the hospital wing." Worried that might seem too familiar, Harry sighed. "I'd like to actually meet him properly.  Maybe if the current investigation pans out."
went over Mr. Parkinson's head as he went down. I don't think it hit anything though."
Cornelia shrugged. "Pretty much."
"I wish the younger ones wouldn't gossip about you.  It's not as if they can't speak to you in the common room. Do you see how they're staring?"
"I really am sorry," Draco said. "But he did ask."
Sammy's eyes went to first one side then the other as he looked at each of them. "Who's Sirius Black?"  he asked, confused.
"Of course not! She is a half-blood and no friend to the Dark Lord, but the temptation -- and the risk -- is too great." Snape rolled his eyes. "And it's 'whom.'"
"What?" Harry asked.
"That's a lot of dye," Creevy explained. "Colin uses it, of course -- that's how I knew the abbreviation right off. But he's never bought more than five galleons' worth at a time."
"It was certainly the most exciting part of my holidays," Harry continued. "Strange, and a little bit dangerous --"
of your blood; you were right about that." With that, she rose to her feet.  The cat swayed slightly, but stayed on her shoulder. "I advise you to look closer to your heart for guidance, Harry Potter, and I wish you the best of luck."
When Harry had bought Stag's Run Lodge, the limited electricity -- the water pump, water heater, and a few lights -- had been powered by a propane generator. After a few days of magic making the lights flicker and strobe alarmingly, Harry had pulled the fuses for everything but the water pump, which was far enough away from the living areas that it tended to work reliably. Eventually, they had run out of propane, and Hermione had encased the tank in explosion containment charms, and Harry had hired someone to do plumbing charms and to update the primitive bathroom.
"I don't know." Harry bit his lip. "I mean, I want to, but I still think it's too much of a risk."
"No, he actually
Harry leaned against the cool stone of the window embrasure. Nearby, students hurried up and down the staircases.
"Lovely." Her teasing smile gave her a momentary resemblance to her unacknowledged niece. "As I understand matters, formality would be
"I can't really turn it on and off like that," Harry replied, grinning at her. "How about some other entertainment?"
"Yes."
"Perhaps because you

I'm lying in bed with a hand down my pants in the most undignified
"Let me read it first--"
They continued on in silence to the fifth floor, where Draco opened the door to the Prefect's bathroom with an easily audible "Suds and buds."
"Persistent erections."
"What?" He stared at her. "Okay, I can believe it about Sirius. He's careless, and far too full of himself. Draco, though -- we should be friends, at least. We can't have spent six years in school together without realizing how much we have in common."
Harry nodded.
"Certainly, as long as he doesn't do it repeatedly." Snape looked keenly at Harry. "If you care for him, as I believe you do, you might not want to risk more than two attempts this year. You will recall how we apparated away from within the seer's house, and why."
Harry couldn't keep from feeling flattered. "All right. I'll play bodyguard, then."
Draco tsked. "If it was easy, the magic wouldn't be strong. You'll have to work at it, but I'm confident you can manage."
She turned, and Harry jumped to match up with her long, quick stride. He was aware of Ron and Hermione lagging a little behind. "Is something wrong?" he asked.
"Clearly." Hermione moved to the second, longer, sheet. "The next divination? Ron?"
Whilst Harry was still dizzy with that, Professor Dumbledore poured tea -- first for Harry, then for himself -- and set a quilted cozy over the pot. "You will recall," he said, adding two cubes of sugar to his own cup, "our previous discussion, the last time we sat in this spot?"
really that fascinating?"
"Krups?" Now it was Draco's turn to be confused.  "In a two-room flat?" His brain caught up, and flooded with relief.  He had been misreading everything. "Oh, is this some new gambling scandal?  I have no idea, Potter. He doesn't talk business with me."
“What?” Harry exclaimed.
"However, if we want to genuinely expand inter-house cooperation, we need more people, and I think that now that we have a core group, we should be able to extend invitations to prospects who might not have been entirely suitable for the first round." He surveyed them for a moment. "However, I don't mind having delayed on Hufflepuffs until after tomorrow's match." As people chuckled, he picked up his glass. "Who has a nomination for the group to debate?"
for you! You can't stay any place he'd expect! Except Hogwarts, I suppose."  With a huff of annoyance, Draco stood. "Let's order dinner. I could scarcely manage a bite at lunch, and it's been an exhausting day."
"No unnecessary expenses, Potter."
"Try not to look," Madam Langston said soothingly. "It will not spoil the divination, but you will find it unpleasant." She cleared her throat. "Now I must anoint myself. Once I have done that, you may ask me one question, and one question only. Do you understand?"
"What is it?"
"Is Hermione going to report me?" Dean asked.
"Explain what twice?" Hermione asked tightly. She was standing in the entrance to her room, arms folded and wand in hand.
"Because?" Her eyebrows rose.
"Are you sure it was you, and not chance?"
And you were one of the people who came to rescue me and my friends."
Changing a shiver to a deliberate undulation of his hips, Malfoy worked lace knickers off and down, until had them dangled on one toe. He kicked them to the side, and without being asked, pulled the skirts up further, until the last bit was pushed to a very obvious peak by his released erection. Harry whined.
"Look. You said she didn't think that you doing well meant no one else could. Why does honoring your family have to mean that other people's families don't matter?"
Padma waved to Hermione, and Hermione waved back and then looked pointedly past Draco, Harry, and Ron, and to her other side. "Sophia?" she asked.
took his catch-up turns. He seemed to be able to split up the dice rolls to
he felt, and made a decision.
"How are things going with Hermione?" Draco asked on Saturday morning. They had met in the Uncommon room to clean up from the night before, as they often did. Draco thought they should have Dobby do it, but Harry didn't want to strain his loyalties that greatly.
"Because you were sorry, or because you were afraid Draco would be upset at you?"
"Just don't expect her too soon. She'll ask as many questions after a lesson as her professor will allow."
"This is one of those dances where you switch partners."
"Mother was
The old wizard led them to the Floo and sent Auror Tonks ahead. After a few seconds, he offered the Floo powder to Draco. "Dunhorse Cottage," he said, and Draco nodded.
Harry grinned and Linnet giggled. "I'll tell you about
"Lovely timing."
"One year," he said, "we went to the seashore for a week. It was really exciting and fun, and then the second morning I woke up with dragon pox and had to stay in Bill and Charlie's room by myself, every day all week, with people laughing and having fun outside my window, and the smell of the sea in the air."
filtering me out of the divination. Are you any good at that?
“We’ve already discussed that.”
“Mr. Malfoy is welcome too of course,” Remus added. Sirius opened his mouth, but then closed it as Remus elbowed him in the ribs.
"The sanctioned one or the other?" Snape sneered back, but then shook his hair from his eyes. "Growing fur on some Muggle substance, for some incomprehensible reason."
Ron moved suddenly, rolling onto his side. Harry readied for more vomiting, but Ron just took a sip of water.
It was a good line, but not convincing. Draco shot him a look.  "Really. Tell me, Gryffy -- Potter or Creevy? I might give you points for honesty."
Whether or not Talbot was telling the truth, his testimony turned Harry's thoughts to a related problem. Even if he didn't stay with the Weasleys after his birthday, they could still be attacked to flush him out. On the other hand, that had always been true, hadn't it? Visiting the Weasleys would give Voldemort a more concrete reason to attack them; it made sense to stay away. And leaving the Dursleys should keep them safe -- certainly Voldemort would know that he didn't love them, wouldn't he? And Voldemort -- Tom Riddle -- had hated his own Muggle relatives, so there, at least, he should not invent affection where it didn't exist.
"You could probably get away with one arrangement," Harry conceded. "That's all, though. Really."
"The only person I've ever heard you
"Millicent Bulstrode."
Ron's eyes darted here and there about the room and found all the Gryffindors nodding. Scowling, he took a bead. Parvati smiled.
Harry took out the paper and spread it against the wall, pointing at the photograph. "I'm sure that's Mr. Nott."
"I was safe enough."
Ron snorted. He apparently remembered that story. "Time will tell, I guess. Now, Malfoy Manor....
“Life to life is always easier,” he said, and began a complex incantation of transfiguration. The branch shorted and rounded before taking the form of a brown rabbit. The new creature barely had time to lift its head before Hecksban stunned it. Hermione gasped and Dumbledore sighed, running his hand once down the thick fur.
"Yes, of course," Draco soothed, "but that's no reason to permit love to blossom where the result would be unsuitable."
"Oh!" Draco said. His eyes were open wide.
because of a Muggle-born apprentice who was astounded that he not only survived, but left without potions or devices four days later."
charm on
Hermione cleared her throat.  "You said you weren't going."
"Well yes."
"Hi," he said.
"Occasionally." Harry shrugged. "None of them are friends."
"Not from Professor Snape."
"They'll be fine," Harry said, letting his feet settle on the ground. "So what's the basket for?"
"I'm sorry." Harry glanced over at Severus, who was watching tight-lipped -- but still watching. "Am I boring you, love?"
"Well, let's keep that between ourselves, shall we?"  Harry suggested. The surreality of lunching with Snape was catching up with him. Snape had a flash of that young, sly look that Harry had seen during their lessons.
"Yes, but I was ten, and my mother said she was
"Piss off," Harry replied, happy to hear the words come out unembellished. "No offense intended."
"But why bother?" Harry returned. "I'm just here to ask if you want to come to the library."
"Precisely."
Potter?"
. We need to know what strengths Harry should
"Well, it's not bad, really," Draco demurred. "The house is split, though."
"Yes," he snarled. "If you had any discernment at all, you'd realize how tedious this life is." He raised his head. "I thought I'd find a girl," he said, raising his eyebrows as if that was a challenge.
"Color?" Harry asked.
Harry took a long breath. Nott -- these had to be from Nott -- had managed to cut the memories off at strategic points, so he probably could as well. He set his shoulders back. "Sure. I haven't done this before. Is one at a time okay?"
Restraining a smile, Harry squeezed in next to Draco and peered down at the drop of potion. The purple took on a pinker tint, this way -- almost glowing. Within it were tiny black dots, each suspended in a colorless, cloudy orb.
"Right. So why not just Harry?"
here.  Is it really tomorrow? I mean, the next day?"
can threaten us all they like – trips are an indulgence that you are not entitled to take."
Draco's brow creased. "You
Nodding, Harry resumed, going fractionally lighter. He had been pushing, after all, letting his own agitation affect him. He kept at it until Severus settled into the faster, harder, pace, and then held there. After what felt like several minutes, he paused to catch his breath.
"Because Dean and I were on the outs last year," Harry said.
"I wasn't avoiding you!"
"With shield spells," Justin added.
Harry pushed away his tea, sloshing it over the saucer and part of the table. He stood. "Dobby!" he called.
"Is that as nasty as it sounds?"
"No." Harry breathed out. "It was just strange. I was startled. Now try moving, just a little -- slowly."
"Of course it matters! We're talking about
"Put a sock in it," Draco said brusquely. He grinned at Harry's surprised look. "Listen for a moment. I don't want you to refuse them--"
"I beg to differ!" Linnet exclaimed. "
"Well, it's not good to shrink and expand something too many times."
"It's your game. But I'm not inviting Parvati, or my git of a brother."
"So I'm told," he answered steadily. Snape looked satisfied with that.
Harry landed several blows in quick succession, and then stopped to shove Draco's undergarment down. His arse was as marked as his back, and his cock standing out hard from his body. Harry took a moment to stroke it and smear the wetness at the tip. "Mm," he said appreciatively. "Hold that thought."
"Crap." The edge of her bed sank under him as he sat. He took her hand. "I'll do what I can for you. I promise."
Hermione was over to them before Harry had got through himself. Her eyes narrowed as she looked over at him. "You're out late."
intend to stay like this. However, I could reverse the change; it would just take six weeks -- after the four needed for the potions to work their way out of my system." He gave Ron a withering look. "And sadly, no -- I won't be in your dormitory. I'm going to be Head Boy. Well, one of the Head Boys."
"Really. I wasn't drinking, I wasn't off the grounds, I wasn't doing Dark Arts.... It is none of your business."
“A hospital cot? With wheels?” Harry couldn’t image transfiguring anything that complicated, certainly not on the spur of the moment.
"Ron?" Harry asked tentatively.
this year," Narcissa said sharply.
"Well enough, I think."
was even more disconcerting, but there wasn't blood -- which he had apparently been afraid of, as he had looked for it -- and he felt more normal afterwards, as he continued up to Gryffindor.
was followed by a stone-shaking
For a moment, even the twins were silent.
"I," said Draco grandly, "am Head Boy."
proper Common Room conversation?"
"Oh. That makes more sense." Millicent began to grind Mountain Crab shell in the large mortar, so Harry filled the cauldron with water and set it to heat. It wasn't until the fluxweed had been added to the brew that she spoke again.
"You're helping her because she's helpless?"
"And well deserved!"  Ron contributed.
Harry laughed. Neville was more clever than most people thought. "The jewelry's optional," he said.
"Or more like Truth or Dare?" Harry put in.
"Voldemort is such a bastard," Harry said viciously. "He left the head here, with a letter for me, saying it was a
Harry nodded. Zoe and Damian were gone, leaving him with a Chaser spot and a Beater spot to fill.
He found the color in the mirror.
Gilbert laughed, drawing Harry from his thoughts. He looked over to see that Cheefi had grasped a lock of Hermione's hair and was holding it over his own head like a toupee. Tuktuk seemed to find this quite as funny as Gilbert did.
her."
"Oh. Well, good." Harry realized he was petting the chair arm again, and forced his fingers to cease their quick strokes.  "So, it's a brilliant class. The first two months were mostly curse detection and blocking. We did simple transfer and destruction in November, and have just started what's called 'effect mitigation,' which was what I was doing there."
"My loyalties are now public knowledge. Anyone who wishes you harm will first try to distract me, and next to distract Draco."
Harry clenched his jaw. Under the table, Draco stroked his leg with one foot, and when he had Harry's attention, looked appealingly at him.
Hermione's face softened. "I see. So what happened?"
"Great," Ron muttered. More loudly, he said, "
Snape shrugged the matter off. "And I expect there was no one to protect."
"Oh no!" Hermione said, looking over.
"So say it."
At that moment, however, there came a knock at the door, and Draco's voice calling "Harry?"
was the one I used a clipping of in your potion. Rather than adding weight and wisdom to the draught, I increased your focus on physical sight, and the Dreaming head of the Runespoor had no balance."
"Enough of this school crap," he said, prowling forward. "You were too sleepy, last night. I want a fuck."
Tonks, from a few steps away, answered. "THE POSSIBLE TARGETS ARE BOTH HERE AND ALIVE. THE OBJECT IS SECURED."
"It was not as late as the Daily Prophet would have you believe. There is no story so dramatic they do not find it worthy of embellishment.  In this case, 'deep in the dark of night ' was before my usual bedtime."  He looked sharply at Harry. "I will not tell you more about the meeting, but you may now ask other questions."
. We couldn't have you."
For a minute, there was silence.
"Okay." Now that she thought about it, that was true. Harry would be safer in this Harry's world than her visitor was in this one. He might not trust people he should, but he wouldn't trust anyone he shouldn't.
to help. Dobby hears you -- wherever you be."
"Point of order," Linnet cut in. "May we hear the dangers of the other years?"
"Oh, all right, not in those words. But that's what it amounts to." She stroked his forehead in a motherly way. "You'll call us when you feel better?"
"No." Snape gestured towards the door. "I still have my secrets. As consolation, be assured that I will be unable to catch you at mischief for several hours. Harry, you know to speak to Gerard Hecksban about any pain, correct?"
"I'm going to--"
He sat when Harry did, setting the notebook -- actually a folder, Harry saw now -- carefully on his lap, and then pulling off his gloves.  "Now tell me -- Malfoy Manor? Why were you there?"
Narcissa gave him an odd look before turning back to her son. "Only regrets, fortunately. The Hanleys, incidentally, sent their regrets quite promptly.  However, the Clarkes conveyed that Linnet Hanley will be attending as their son's guest, so the intent of your request is fulfilled."
Draco pulled the bowl closer. He stroked it almost lovingly, and Harry saw Ron roll his eyes. Ron's derision changed to amazement as Draco drew his wand and repeated the strokes, coaxing the base to spread out toward his touch. As he started to turn it, Ron reached a hand.
to see that. It wouldn't do to proceed recklessly."
Harry, humbled, nodded.  "Right."
Draco examined the scar. "'I must not tell lies?'"  he read with a sneer of disgust. "Did you do that to yourself?"
Blaise reached out his hand for the money and took it with a grin. "He has a point there. All right. Shall I deliver the goods to you, or will Draco do?"
"So if you're up there ignoring each other, you might as well be down here," Seymour argued. "Not that it matters to me."
"No, not that. Let's start with something simpler."  Harry pointed at Millicent's feet. "How about your shoes?"
Snape drew back and up, like an offended goose. "Die? I am hardly about to kill you, although if the headmistress hears of this, you may wish I had."
"I still don't have anything to be Scabbers," Ron complained. "I mean, represent him."
"Oh, is he?" Draco exclaimed awkwardly. "I hadn't realized."
She snorted. "Not too dim after all, Gryffindor.  Yeah, I might be able to make time -- but we'll need to brew every two weeks."  She sighed. "It's probably better to start on a day that we can always manage."
"This could, potentially, reinforce whatever inroads you have made at school. Parents whose children have spoken favorably of you will get a chance to see you for themselves."
"No, of course not. But neutrals will need to be carefully selected."
Harry was about to say that he would join him when he spotted someone else -- a flight down, Millicent Bulstrode was just turning on to the stairs.
Harry nodded. "Right. Some dungeon corridor if we can't."
The group went deathly quiet. After a moment Draco sighed and shook his head. "Darling...."
"Right, but most of us didn't choose it, did we?  This is just what we have to do to get on to the real stuff."
girl didn't exist. Malfoy had been amazing.
None of it was flat. Harry was still felt awkward going down stairs. He hoped slopes weren’t as bad.
"You were out all night!"
"And you weren't bitten?" someone challenged.
for them. And as Hermione pointed out later, we'd be messing up international politics if one nation had that sort of sudden population decline."
Draco shrugged. "It depends on how you think about it."
That was not, of course, subtle.
"Of course not, Harry," Severus answered immediately, with a glare at Draco. "I didn't spend years keeping you alive in order to mindlessly turn on you."
"Well, this will just expand that to the surrounding area." Biting his lip in concentration, Eugene set his wand to one pink nipple, releasing his mouth long enough to mutter an incantation. The flesh beneath the tip began to swell up and outwards. Malfoy's mouth opened as he let out soft, panting breaths. It took a flash of pleasure for Harry to realize that he was pushing into the side of the mattress and rock hard. Embarrassed, he drew away from the contact and closed his eyes. When he opened them again, Malfoy had small breasts of white and pink.
"What are you, Weasley, ten?" Draco scoffed.
"Why'd you say you did that if you didn't? It's supposed to be the other way round."
"I could leave before the ball."
make extra work for some poor House Elf for my convenience."
Harry sighed. "Oh..." On the verge of agreement, he stopped. "Look, part of why I felt this was safe was it wasn't widely known to be yours."
"You tried to protect his privacy and his health. It was a difficult balance."
After that, "Miller, Graham" was sorted into Hufflepuff, and "McDuffie, Robert" into Gryffindor. "Mello, Yolanda" followed. By the time the Sorting was over, Gryffindor had eleven new members, six boys and five girls, and Harry thought Slytherin had nearly as many.
for things, really -- that he let me try to win support in his house, and that he look the other way about us."
"Damn it, Snape, I didn't WANT to come back. I told Professor Dumbledore I
"Git!" Harry exclaimed, snatching a bead from the bowl. "It was
"In return for what?"
Potter scowled in his most dangerous manner. "Let's say other people believe you. Does it balance binding me here?"
"I don't think
Malfoy stopped and started again, and there was more breadth this time.  "Good?"
Draco's eyes widened. "With a Blood Quill?"
Smiling, Harry bent down and set her on the stone floor.
Draco snorted. That, he could believe. "You're still responsible for getting here on time," he said, deliberately looking Thornton over.  "I don't see any sign that you hurried."
"What?"
"He's really good at it, too," Rob said, eager to talk about something he understood. "He was mentioned in "Young players to watch" in
Harry shrugged. "Not outright, although I did give them the impression I would. The last thing that I told them was that insulting my boyfriend was a bad move."
A solution occurred to him, and he gestured at the fire. "Draco, would you pour the water, please?"
Gilbert's eyebrows arched up. "Having not been caught," he said haughtily, "I am scarcely inclined to provide details."
If a snake could frown, she would have done. He could feel her distress.
"But it's
Harry grinned. "Yeah? Me too."
"Well, it was practically to me," Harry protested.
"Because he was vicious about your homosexual attractions."
"I.... Right," Ron said sheepishly. "I should have realized that -- that it would be unpleasant for you, I mean."
"Yeah. I do."
"Still." Harry sighed. "I know it doesn't make sense. Maybe it's -- I don't know -- image in front of a Slytherin student?  In front of his spellson? But he does." He shrugged and reached for a sandwich. "What had you wanted to talk about?"
"Well, not spying directly."  Eugene touched the table next to them, and it opened, exposing rows of cosmetics and raising up a curved length like the neck of a swan which sent out a soft, white light. "He has a way to tell where people are."
"Mrs. Malfoy said she thought you had been close before."
"Yeah." Harry looked up and smiled tentatively. "Enough, isn't it?"
The collective response was just as rude as he'd remembered.
go through Hermione's things. That left him without much to distract him from the question of how well Draco could handle Hermione's protective anger. Draco might be better with people than he was, but he didn't know Hermione as well.
From the interested flicker of Zabini's eyes, he hadn't known, which to Harry meant he was allied with neither the Order nor Voldemort -- at least not actively.
"Done this before?" Harry asked, nipping Draco's ear, while he worked a hand under Draco's robes, bunching them up and getting in his way. Draco panted harshly at the contact.
"No need to wait, darling," Draco said. "We ha--" His voice tightened. "You have a House Elf, after all." He looked away, and scraped moodily at his empty plate. Neither he nor Harry took a bead.
Snape's head turned slowly, like that of a snake seeking a scent. "You have performed accidental magic since coming to Hogwarts?"

"You'll tell him we found doxy eggs in it?"
would he take it?"
"That's a
She glanced over at her brother. "Gilbert says that you and Draco pushed for the room."
"I--"
" he complained, hurrying up to her.
"What?" Canceling the glamour, Harry pushed back the hood of his cloak to meet her eyes. "Look, why would I--"
Harry burst out laughing. Draco winced at that, but Millicent just grinned at him.
Neville's eyes widened still more, at that.
"Yes."
Draco smirked. "I know. It makes my own loss of impartiality far more bearable.
will love having just the custard. Tastes vary, you know."
"I suppose it would reflect the light better."
Draco sighed. It wasn't loud, Harry thought, just very obvious.
, Harry?"
"Can, yes," she said grimly. "Now, I want you to admit we have a right to." While he was still trying to absorb that, she took a quick breath. "No. An obligation to, as people who
. You need to choose a place for the 'output' to go, though -- we have an enclosed toilet on the third floor. It overflowed once, a few years ago -- too many Aurors processing detainees from simultaneous raids of a half-dozen sand houses."
"It's just that I've never seen it before," Harry answered readily, and his eyes widened in horror. "You put Veritaserum in my drink!"
"I expect you to manage something better than that."
"So," Harry said uncertainly, "that invitation." He met Draco's eyes. Coming with me?"
"I-- I wasn't offered... I'm not sure how I would petition for that."
"Mm. I'm rather glad it's not Severus."

"Do you have your portkey?" Snape asked. Harry felt for the bookmark from Remus that he knew was in his pocket.
"You're
"No. As far as can tell, he only asked because he thought it would be Draco, and thought he'd be embarrassed."
"Professor Dumbledore gave me
"Harry?"
"The mirror's a bit of a giveaway."
"You're not surprised."
"Let us start with the Uncommon Room, then," he said. "We'll need to persuade at least some of the others; leave that to me."
"I--" Ron gasped, as if an Acromantula was approaching.
"As we decided."
.  She felt this made her look more logically at what was known and what was alleged of her father's death, including some new information she inferred during the investigation." Draco looked sidelong at Harry. "She seems to believe you were present; I'm not sure why. She expressed frustration at how few details she had and asked if I would prevail upon you to speak to her."
Harry nodded. "All right."
"Even more so in the chamber, on our wolf-fur one."
Ron scowled. "It's not your business, is it? It's my assignment."
Shacklebolt studied him for a moment. "It was not Snape," he stated, reaching for the photos. "Though I should probably speak to him next -- or after the headmaster. I believe I should be on my way."
"I just need a moment to--"
"It wasn't in the proposal."
. That's a weird old word, but the only one that works. I haven't been able to say how, though."
Draco arched his eyebrows. “Apparently.  Professors Snape, Hecksban, McGonagall, and Flitwick – as well as Hagrid – are said to be sequestered in a security review with the Headmaster. Thus the cancelled lessons.”
"But I did promise...."
"No one will believe him," he whispered.
evaluating options. Money isn't the only factor."
"I'll come along," Cornelia said. "Mill, Ginny, Caradog, you're in, right?"
“Let’s go see Hagrid,” Ron said cheerily. Draco shuddered.
you used, but ...."
"That was it, then, was it?"
"Yeah, but I bet you could learn to like it."
"It was just.... He grabbed my arm. I'd have hated myself, I think."
At Harry's angry claim, Cheefi swung down from Draco's shoulder and took up a spot between them, patting first Hermione's face and then Harry's. Hermione giggled.
It had been more like three hours, as Harry remembered it, but he supposed Ron was creating some extra time afterwards by making their visit shorter. Hermione sat back with a dissatisfied huff. Harry looked over at Draco, and found him studying Ron. Perhaps he hadn't realized that Harry wasn't the only Gryffindor who could lie to his friends. "Hermione," Harry said, "just let it go, all right?"
, specifically.
Hagrid’s hut, when they reached it, was closed and locked. Fang bayed from inside, and jumped up to loll his tongue out at them through the window, tail wagging madly, before returning to his earlier ruckus.
"I do. Nott's been muttering death threats in his sleep, Blaise says. I'll only be a moment."
"You're back."
"That wasn't what I asked."
"I had made arrangements for their protection--"
Harry waved him off. "I'll see you at the Welcoming Feast."
"That was a violation of international accords!"
Life as a social outcast had not improved Severus Snape any. His hair hung in greasy hanks, neglected enough to have formed knots at the base, which they never had at school. His face was gaunt as well as sallow, and there was a touch of paranoia in the way his attention twitched to the side. Of course, Harry realized, the kettle was still there, steam now rising from the spout, but he wasn't willing to get up and move it for

think of it as a skirt. Recalling Draco's unease the night before, he followed his knock with calling, "It's Harry."
"'Fey,' Draco said to Harry quickly. "The modern word is 'Fey,' as we said last night.'"
Harry was too far away to hear Luna's hum of agreement, but he could see it in the stretch of her lips.  Padma's growl, much closer, was just at the edge of his hearing.
"The Dark Lord does not care," Snape said coldly.  "I thought that had finally got through to you."
"The Quiris are leaving. Let Astoria know? We'll be here another hour or two."
"Well," Dumbledore demurred. "I'm sure Minister Ramsley sees it merely as not mentioning--"
"All right, then." In pleasure, Harry shifted his human muscles under the spray for a moment. When he had to put a hand on the rail he did his best to make it look casual. "Turn around. I'll get your back too."
She smiled gratefully. "Right. So he had me work with him on the paths at the edge of the forest, and actually some grounds-keeping work as well -- although we don't call it that -- and we got along."
Harry blinked. That didn't seem relevant. "Does that bother you?" he hazarded.
"Yes, yes," Dumbledore murmured, stumbling back and sinking into one of the chairs usually used by visitors. The paper was still in his hand. "How disheartening."
"Oh, honestly, Weasley!" Draco shot back contemptuously.  "He wouldn't have come over here at all if I hadn't intervened."
"Well, you because you're hard on Slytherins, and me because I didn't turn them into frogs."
her!"
The man's eyebrows, which were thick and tangled, came up. Harry got the feeling that they didn't do that often. Indeed they descended back into a scowl almost immediately.
"Of course." Harry's mouth twitched, and he let go of Draco to cut a slice of his beef. "Where would the world be without you mocking it?"
The warning seemed excessive -- after all, they had both been here before -- until Harry was inside the room and realized that Snape had been marking. Piles of essays were spread over the table in front of the sofa, and the smaller table between the sofa and the chair, some with sealed potion samples beside them. Snape firecalled the kitchen for more tea and took a swallow from his own cup before carrying it with him to the chair. "Please explain," he said.
“Just to torture him?” Hermione exclaimed.
"Unless you're much more twisted than I thought," he said, "I think the answer is yes."
After breakfast, Harry hoped he would be able to escape while Hermione scoured the
Remus had followed more sedately, settling the hem of his sweater. "We'd almost decided you must be safe."
of before, but who was piss-poor at Translation charms.  (Not that any
"Yes?" he asked mildly, turning.
"Are you all right?"
"Ah, yes. I've heard about that concern." He hoisted himself up and back, so he was sitting on the worn surface of the desk.  "Well, they can't kill you that way; at least not directly."
The loops of her body flowed over his skin with the eager hiss, and she raised the front of her body to look him in the face.
"I've known her too long to say, really. She's like a sister; I've never understood how Ron can
"Mind if I join you?"  Ron asked flatly. Hermione stood.
She laughed, and took his arm again, as cozily as if they had been friends for years. "Oh dear. You really don't know how to play, do you? Let me help." She sent him a flirtatious look. "Would your friends be shocked to see you with a girl?"
"Good enough." She drained her wine and stood, holding out her hand. "A pleasure doing business with you, Potter."
Slowly, Draco walked him through changing the color of his light at every third cross of the line, and Harry found he could pick up the rhythm, making the change at the right instant, even with larger and smaller loops. Sometime after that, it occurred to him to wonder what the point was.
"I don't
"Not if I can help it." Harry winced at the words leaving his mouth, but he wasn't going to apologize. He turned to the trainee.  "Miss Leroy, I'm keeping you on this case as my research assistant. Get me a full report on Octavius, and put the known sales points on a map, referencing dates and times."
"I do not represent the MLE, Potter."
"I'm not!"
"Probably growing quickly," Harry said. "Come on -- let me see. I need to recast it anyway."
"Severus, really," Draco chided, the name dropping as naturally from his lips as if he were his father. "Do
"I know." Harry held on to Draco and wondered when that would pull him in two. "You just ... you talk about it like it makes
Draco smirked and took a sip of his drink. "As it happens, I cleaned up the decayed remains of a forty-two foot basilisk with a Bone-Burning curse. Before, I might add, Harry and I started to correspond with each other, which was before we started to associate with each other, which was before we were close enough that I would have considered believing anything of the sort, had I not seen the evidence. The thing you need to understand about Harry is that the most outrageous things happen to him; the only lie he has any proficiency in is false protestations that he was studying quietly at the time you are asking about."
"Maybe." Ron took a deep breath. "Still, I think we better get on that divination, right?"
"Oh, I see. Yeah. Anyway," Harry continued, "you can change a little, right? So maybe on the third and fourth weeks, I should do a glamour of how you look the second week, and then the fifth week, change it a little more...."
adequate information."
"Yeah, I was offended! Would you have dove for Weasley if he was falling off his broom?" she asked sarcastically.
"Um ... Does McGonagall know?"
Draco leaned back, crossing his arms over his narrow chest. "Is that why you're teaching him Dark Arts?"
Harry came to his feet. "Done with that."
"It will give people something to do."
"All right." Draco sat back on his heels and Harry's knees. "Well, you know I did have a tendency to, um, listen at doors...."
"Silly, literal Gryffindor," Draco answered. "All right. I didn't mean to bring you down, you know."
He also, it seemed, had the sense to not try to make conversation once they had left the room. After a long, silent march through the corridors, Harry stood in Dumbledore's office, watching the man draw a familiar Pensieve from an equally familiar tall cabinet.
"I think you did the right thing!" Hermione exclaimed.  "Though I wouldn't have thought Sirius capable of assassination. That's rather different than attacking in anger."
"Explain to me first," Remus said firmly. "
"Oh, does she want to improve her looks?"  Hermione said sharply. "Seem smaller, perhaps?"
Harry laughed. "I knew what he meant, Sirius."
"No, but it's scarcely wider. Relax again. It's just a little toy."
"You don't look happy."
, though. I just noticed that you were telling me to do what I would have done anyway."
"Some of you will," Draco countered. "The rest of us can keep a few tests going, if we've timed them carefully."
"Why?"
She sat back, crossing her arms. Harry was grateful Hermione had not shown up. As harsh as that question was, it would be far worse with both her and Ron in the room. Draco was the first to reach hesitantly forward.
When Snape had answered with a dignified nod, Harry continued. "So he wouldn't choose people who weren't willing -- or at least didn't pretend to be willing."
There was something perversely satisfying about terrifying the Dursleys.
That was interesting. Harry tried to keep his voice as light. "Really? Do you know who?"
Draco grimaced. "The trial? They don't want me talking?" He hesitated. "Though they could have killed me, easily enough. They must have more complicated plans."
"Oh," Myrtle said. She fanned her face with one hand. "You look
"Definitely whisky. Bloody strong, that is!"
"Probably. Can we say we're done?"
"Yeah. Draco thinks it's time too."
He lay there afterwards, regaining his breath. Draco tipped him to the side and then came up on one elbow beside him.
With the intimidating slowness of a bear, Millicent turned to face her. "Do you think he--" she jabbed her finger at more of a downward angle than Harry thought really necessary-- "is going to beat me up?"
"Right. I think it happens to a lot of kids with Muggle families." Harry shook off the thought and the memories that came with it. The Dursleys had hated him before any of that. "Anyway, you can all watch from here for as long as you like, and you can go back to the castle when you're bored. No going into the changing rooms, though, and no stepping out onto the pitch, got it?"
Dumbledore nodded gravely at her. "You wished to speak, Narcissa?"
Thirty hours later, Harry had an Apparation license, presented by an embarrassingly fawning Ministry official. He had one essay due on Wednesday, but nothing else to prepare. The NEWT-level students had no lessons this week at all, just exams on Tuesday or Wednesday, as set by each professor.
Potter blinked. He cleared his throat. Waving vaguely beyond Draco's shoulder, he said, "Well, I do need some, er, Murtlap essence."
His lips curled in an unfamiliar sneer. "Granger," he said shortly. With a disgusted air, he surveyed the tent around them.  "So. I take it my counterpart in this world is another Muggle-coddling masochist?"
"You think so?"
Ron snorted. "Not to mention his recent ideas of friends."
Nodding, Harry did a quick visual check around them, located the long Hufflepuff bead on his bracelet, drew his wand, and tapped it.  The bead glowed brightly for a moment, and then dimmed and warmed. "I should learn to do that wandless," he muttered. "All right. Let's go."
"He was impersonating Thornton," Draco said quickly, trying to recapture some indignation. "With Polyjuice."
Draco got to his feet. Harry had only time for a moment's confused hurt before Draco reached a hand down to him. "Come to bed?"  he asked, his voice low.
"Crops. Meant for horses, and meant to be mild, but painful if you hit with the shaft." Harry grinned. "Of course, I really whale down with them -- not what one's supposed to do to a horse these days, I'm sure. And a switch, which is more pliant. The flat thing is a paddle, but also leather -- not as rough as wood." His eyes flashed up to meet Snape's. "Would you like a tour of how each feels?"
"She was a Slytherin, Potter. These things must be done with care. She will be more amenable to an alliance if she believes the thought was her own."
"Anything you want," Harry promised breathlessly.
"Maybe we'd better split up here, Potter. Wouldn't want to turn your house against you again."
Harry slipped into the seat beside Draco in Cursebreaking on Monday. Professor Hecksban was still arranging a few items at up at the front of the class. "I can't stay after," he whispered.
chair -- he did feel undeniably possessive of it now -- Harry approached hers and cautiously stroked the wood.  It felt the same as the first one had; milder, if anything. Again, he moved close in, sinking down into the curse that flowed along the grain. He didn't understand the trigger, but he twisted the malice to face the other way, and felt it settle.
Harry had managed not to think of that. Perhaps the curse was losing its hold on her? The book had said it had to be dispelled, but if it faded off naturally, that would be much better. She might not ever realize what had happened.
"So you think I should accept."
Fred and George showed up within minutes. George looked around the room and his eyes narrowed. "Where's the fire, Harry?"
"Drinking?" Potter guessed. "Dark Arts?"  Snape nodded to the first, then hesitated at the second. "With either," he said. "I may have a little talk, or several, with the student in question, depending on how I see the matter developing." He looked archly at Harry. "However, as you are not re-sorting, none of that should affect you.
Two voices chorused goodbyes as he walked away.
Ron stared after him. "Password? There wasn't a password."
"Stone to wood has lasted three weeks now."
"But we recommend the Hogshead. Anything the barman serves, he'll sell you by the bottle."
"Ugh!" Draco exclaimed. "I kissed a Gryffindor!" and that was so unexpected that Harry burst out laughing. He looked at Draco, who was smiling smugly at him.
"But ... he'd never agree to stay here. We terrify him!"
"Ah." She steepled her hands for a moment. "Well," she said, inclining her head.  "If what you want is to do something together, I have a suggestion that should suit nicely, but stretch you both a bit more." Afraid she was going to tell them to go do their homework, Harry managed only a slight nod, but she smiled thinly and continued.
"What did you do?"
Ron cleared his throat. "It
"I'm hopeless, aren't I?" she asked wryly.
"I can't imagine not having Draco."
Caradog leaned over. "They probably assumed a Frenchman."
"Look, will you just tell me what it is?"
After a long silence, Hermione nodded. "Fair enough," she said. "And I'm sorry."
"Oh." Ron rubbed his forehead. "Was it useful?" He straightened suddenly, with a horrified look. "That stuff I drank had a
She sighed and stared at the bread in her hands. "Look, I'm a
"Yes, because you avoid Draco Malfoy so assiduously."
"I didn't expect you to!" Harry objected. "Ron shouldn't go after you like that."
"An extremely helpful one."
They both looked at Ron, who -- unnervingly -- had not appeared to notice the conversation.
Harry rubbed his forehead. He wouldn't react well himself to that, and Ron--
Suddenly, his head snapped to the side, and in a sudden move, he pushed Harry against the wall, just by the crocodile bed.
"But not the extent of it?"
"Why were you there?"
been enjoying his lessons."
He went up to the second floor immediately, and around a couple corners to where he had left Creevy. To his surprise, the younger boy was not waiting in the corridor. He came closer, and at the sound of he footsteps, Creevy emerged from the broom closet in which they had left Thornton.

"To the
"Sorry," Draco said.
"Thanks."
"Creevy! What if it was someone else?"
" Harry said carefully "-- I mean, I'm sure there are others, but the one affecting my life -- was a
He continued, alternating the flogger and touch, until Draco was clinging to the bar to stay upright. Deliberately, Harry set the flogger down and kissed behind his ear.
"Probably. That was just a few weeks ago, and people -- guests especially -- do peek back to see who's who. I should do it this week, though, so I'm not thought of as an Auror."
"Are you sure he's all right?" Hermione asked, almost at a whisper.
Ron set his head down like a bull. "I won't back you up."
"He also...."
Breakfast had even more people in attendance than the day before, but the additions were all from Hogwarts. Harry saw Professor McGonagall tuck a section of the
"We didn't say, did we?" Sophia mused. "Yes -- you get one more try. Just one, though."
"Wait," Ron said urgently. "I'm thinking."
who have practical exposure," Gilbert explained.
Harry nodded readily. "Right.  We will."
Harry shrugged. "Okay, I guess."
at all. If he was a Slytherin and sleeping with Malfoy, and had Snape's mother's last name, he couldn't count on anything about this world. He was going to have to listen carefully and react as little as possible until he discovered how to get home.  Fortunately, Malfoy didn't seem to expect him to be chatty. Probably he wasn't a morning person in this world either.
to get him in trouble, but he can be such a grim hero. I felt that he needed some time as a wild young man."
Harry didn't like that thought, and he wasn't sure why. He'd never been reluctant to consider Malfoy the guilty party before. He wondered if it was that lost look he had seen in the photographs, and again today. What sense did that make? Malfoy had grown up with everything and come to Hogwarts securely arrogant. Harry remembered later -- Malfoy crying in the bathroom; Malfoy, his face white with fear, returning to Voldemort and his parents. Malfoy had lost his trust late, rather than early, but after his family's precipitous fall, the hurt would be deep. And with that in his past, and everyone knowing it, he might prefer to go about as someone else.
Millicent nodded. "Before bed. And the book warns that I may wake up sore, but taking it in the morning leads to balance problems."
"Ah."

influence -- it must be! The boy is unbalanced, and Dumbledore has encouraged his paranoia rather than helping him, and he's been filling my son's head with his own delusions of persecution." Lucius closed his eyes for a moment, as if mustering his resources, and then opened them again. "It pains me," he said, with quiet dignity, "that we must be victims to such experiments in education as to turn our own sons and daughters -- our future -- against us."  He glanced down at his unused chains, for just a second, and then raised his head to look again at the Inquisitor. "That is my statement," he said levelly, and sat.
"But it does!" Draco insisted, gesturing angrily at the beautiful room. "It's the Malfoy midwinter ball! It's supposed to be white and gold!"
Harry tensed. Ron, still watching the potion, reached into his pocket and drew his wand.
"Oh, no, you don't!" Vernon roared, his face growing red with anger. "I don't allow your sort in my home. This is a decent house, you know, and I won't have my wife and son exposed to more abnormal freaks from That School. Bad enough that we have to house the boy --"
"Oh, you might not notice all of them," Harry said. Draco shot him a look, and Harry was glad he had explained that conversation to him previously.
"We thought Snape was trying to steal it," Harry explained. "Of course it was Quirrell -- or rather, Voldemort on Quirrell's head --"
Harry considered that. He didn't think Hermione mattered much to their chances. "Okay."
Draco's laugh was so tight with nerves as to be almost a giggle, but he let go and pushed where he had previously been holding, and Harry rolled over, wriggling back until he had Draco's cock between the cheeks of his arse. To his satisfaction, it firmed up some in the process.
Harry laughed. "I promise," he said.
Ron looked up, astonishment wide on his face. "Keeper?" Slowly, he began to smile. "I might have a shot at that."
"Damn."

"What?"
"Caradog Cadwallader," Cadwallader said uncomfortably, but he shook hands with Draco before extending his hand to Harry in turn. "Potter."
"Why? We were friends in June. I haven't done anything since then." Draco's voice grew sharp. "Did she expect letters?"
"A young woman, and I'm

"Mm. Good."
"But if we rotate people into the Keeper's slot during practice," Ginny objected, "they'd just be learning about us."
"Well, we're
Quickly, Harry evaluated his situation. There was no cover.  By the time he could get around the tent to the door, whatever was coming would be on him. He drew his wand and braced himself, only to see the beast's mad rush change to an easy lope. Closer and slower, it was clearly a large, shaggy, black dog. His heart caught in his throat, and he could only stare as it came to a stop a few paces away and shifted into his godfather.
he coaxed. She did move, but her progress was slow and twitchy.
"Ah." Blaise straightened. "Well, then...  would you buy me a quarter-ounce of gargoyle dust?"
"Dean," Harry said sharply. "No. She's fine." He spoke with more confidence than he felt. He had met Linnet, but he didn't know her well. He would have preferred the neutrals that he knew better.
"For those that has the gold, yeah, I can."
"Weren't," Seamus answered jovially. "They're taking them at six now, haven't you heard?"
With a sniff, Draco looked back at his waiting toy. "It was humiliating," he complained.
"I strongly suggest you do. The Manor grounds detect wizards entering in animagus form."
"For a few minutes," Harry said. "Then we talked about your mother, and then about Death Eaters, and then he had me practice casting spells with his wand."
Zabini looked uneasy. "How little?"
Ron caught at Harry's arm. "Stay with me?" he pleaded.
"You don't believe that."
Harry flushed. He hadn't thought of it that way, but he probably did look snooty to them, walking off with Draco Malfoy, and in his new formal robes, as well.
She marched them all, Draco included, through the Gryffindor Common Room and into her room. People stared, but anyone who started to speak shrank back from her glare. As the door clicked shut, she pivoted to turn that glare on them.
His body stiffened momentarily under Harry's ministrations, and he abruptly curled up to stare. "Oh," he said, flopping down again. "You. Merlin."
"Ah," Harry said. "And you're the other one with that green. What's that about?"
Draco shifted back, leaving Harry to answer. He supposed Draco might find the Gryffindor head of house intimidating.
"What does he have to do with it?"
"Over here," Harry said. "Everyone else has heard." He sent Draco a look. "Later," he whispered.
"I'll come along, if you don't mind."
"Wrong?" Harry echoed. "Um, nothing. It's, ah, working."
"Eh, fine. Ron had calmed down by the time we got to the Welcoming Feast."
"I thought everyone did."
"He's not --"
"Thank you," Draco said. "And I
Draco sniggered. "He wasn't too upset, if that was the worst of it. I suspect he just overreacted because of your cheek; I told you not to wear Susara like that, and so soon after what you did to Theo--"

With a flourish, Kingsley produced a white envelope from his robes. "Here you are. A non-functional copy, as I expect you would prefer."
"What Harry is not saying," Draco drawled, as they crossed into the dining room, "is that we practiced that technique only with a marker hex."
Thoughtfully, Draco nodded. "For you to use Slytherin, though ... That would be a benefit to us in itself, in some ways."
"Where are we going?" Creevy asked, bouncing up to follow him.
Hermione had settled back against her desk and was regarding him with disapproval. "Now," she said, "answers, Harry. Where were you?"
"Explain."
The conversation, he saw, had given Draco time to recover, although he looked a little too bored for it to be entirely sincere as he straightened and handed the article back to Parvati.
"Mm." Harry let his lids sink closed again. "Love you," he murmured.
"Your friend is better company than I expected," he said. Harry had no idea how someone who was still glowing from orgasm could manage that breezy tone. "We should have him over more often."
"Unclear," Draco answered. "Madam Horsyr expects to be back in a few weeks, but she may not be able to take them with her at that time, either. If so, I could have them for several months more.  Also, if this arrangement works, I've said I might take them again later."  He laughed at the expression on Harry's face. "Really, now! They're a Potter creation; you ought to be proud to be reunited with them."
Harry shook his head quickly.  He didn't think he had been quiet. "Just didn't mention the ones that might cause trouble," he muttered back, choosing the remaining tart with pear slices.

I think those laws were to keep people from taking other people's
"Hi, Kingsley."
"Good plan," Draco said, as Ron nodded.  "So. Shall we get ready?"
"Le'er ou'" Harry slurred. His lids dipped down and he forced them up again. Susara was on his chest, lying still. Hermione had apparated to the other side of the bed. "Galle'n."
effect. Have you any guesses?"
Harry grinned. "At least one person said that's why I was being nice to the first years. 'Trying to look tall, Harry?'"
"Last night was a disgrace," he said plainly.
"It doesn't change the things they've said," Dean said quietly, "Draco included." He was looking down at his hands, which he was twisting together. "Gemma is still dead."
"But they did favor magical lines, as you said."
"He has a notebook, a hand-sized leather-bound one. I've seen it before. It's for scheduled items and things he does for Malfoy. When I tried to open it, I couldn't, even with charms, but when I used
Harry nodded. "Defense and Cursebreaking, too. I get the feeling Professor Hecksban won't mind that sort of thing."
Millicent snorted. "Making friends with the firsties, Harry?"
She turned around. "A secret meeting chamber?"
"How we shatter the glass, Weasley.
"Draco!"
Harry and Draco kissed occasionally. So, to their surprise, did Sophia and Jeremy. Midway through the afternoon, while Seymour was excitedly learning Parcheesi, and Ruthven playing Exploding Snap with Callie, Harry looked at Draco, and in mutual understanding, they slipped out and up to Gryffindor, where they blocked the door and made love in front of the fire.
He paused to set the fag in his mouth and to light it with a careless-looking snap of his fingers at the tip. He looked frighteningly like he had made the motion hundreds of times.
With a bright laugh, Draco stretched back to give him a kiss. "Very busy," he agreed. "Let me just...." With a quick spiral of his wand, he cast an expansion spell, and the bed wavered and whooshed out to its full size.
bits of things about him -- but she got more about me. She thought
Millicent snorted. "And what would you know about fathers? Sorry," she added hastily, "but it's true. It's easy for you to look at families and think it's all love and understanding. When you have one, it's more complicated."
"Well, I woke earlier, but you didn't, so I went back to sleep." Draco yawned slightly. "We must have been up late. I can't, usually." He smiled slowly, that strange, new smile that seemed to be only for Harry. "Or maybe I've never had such a fine pillow."
for news about Sirius, although he suspected it was too early. He didn't find anything. It was Saturday when Hermione handed him the front section from Dean's Muggle paper.
She nodded. He thought she might even have understood. "Okay."
"That's NOT
"But it might be useful, yeah."
Harry smirked. "I chose impartially and have two new Weasleys."
your obsession with Octavius? Yes, he usually does. But he often requests me for other people, and I'm not even sure they're all gay. Sometimes they meet me looking like him, which is completely strange, because I can always tell."
"Yes, of course."
"She was all set to mount a hunt," Ron said cheerfully, taking an egg mayonnaise sandwich from a platter. "But I said this was the most likely place to find you."
"Oh. Well, even if I did the reading, I probably wouldn't remember, then."
"Werewolves are more vicious towards humans," Harry said stiffly, "assuming they are not on the Wolfsbane potion, which you know we are.  Cattle are much larger and heavier than people, and they have hooves. I'd need another two or three more wolves before I attempted it,
Harry snorted. "Well, yeah. Since he's
"She was attacked, almost certainly, because Mr.  Parkinson was
Draco giggled. Harry moved to tickle him, but then changed his mind. He started undoing Draco's thin shirt, instead.
"What? What went wrong?" Snape sounded startled, worried -- of course, Harry reminded himself, he had played that game with a far more powerful opponent than Draco. "Where is Potter?"
A grandmotherly witch was sitting by a table, turned so that her hands were visible where they lay in her lap. She smiled at Harry warmly, without even a flicker of surprise. "And Mr. Potter. So good to meet you. I am Madam Langston. Pardon me for not offering my hand -- I cannot touch anyone until after the reading, and I'm afraid one of you will need to pour, as well. Sit."
Harry made a face. "Isn't that the one that can make you, um, limp?"
Her eyes fixed on Ron, Bulstrode stood up. In the doorway, she paused, and after meeting Harry's eyes, inclined her head briefly.  Expressionless, she turned and left.
me, where Flitwick never has.  You'd be a great teacher, you know."
"So you were looking for trouble."
"The investigation has concluded, then." Harry guessed.
the pot calling the kettle black."
"Then why--" Draco stopped, and for a moment closed his eyes. "No. Let's start this again."
"No," she said, her voice scraping her throat.  "As far as we know, he's fine, and just can't find us."
"Hm." An attractive flush had returned to Draco's cheeks. "The idea does have merit. Shall we go to the kitchens now, in that case? Or do you not feel well enough for food?"
"Yes, exactly," Draco said, nodding. "But they're much too small."
Harry stopped in the doorway of the crowded Slytherin Common Room. A nearby lower-year registered his presence and whipped around. "Potter!"  the boy shouted in warning, and rowdy conversation muted to whispers in outward waves as people turned to look.
When Harry got back to Gryffindor, he had to tell Seamus that yes, he had eaten, and Hermione that no, he hadn't been drinking. Telling Ron anything would have been a waste of time, as Ron stayed around only long enough to loudly detail -- presumably for Hermione's benefit, although he was addressing Dean -- how much work he had done that afternoon, and when Harry turned to him, he left the room.
"It might be just coincidence," Hermione said quickly.
"That was
"Mm. Let me slide these off, right? I want to make you feel so good...."
Carla reddened, but let Hannah tug her to the sideboard, putting their backs to the circle.
Harry shrugged. "A little, if smelling it doesn't make me feel ill."
"Well?" Malfoy demanded.
"Loudly."
"Though he does if he plays," Parvati said.
, not her." Draco nodded shakily, and took up the kiss again.
"Shacklebolt was the Auror, right?"
Chastened, Harry looked away, and the headmaster's voice softened. "I do recall that conversation," he continued, almost wistfully. "Rarely have you come to me for counsel, and even more rarely do I have time for social frivolities around it. Remember, Harry, that whatever strategic importance you may have, you are still entitled, as everyone is, to be concerned about your safety for your own sake."
"Harry! Why aren't you in the office? Angelina had to go to an emergency meeting in Oslo, and she appointed you and Wentworth her contacts for local investigations, and when I was looking for your Floo name I found a half-dozen applications that Kendall sent me years ago." At Harry's stunned look, he pressed on. "Would you have any objections to Draco Malfoy? I know he was a little rat as a teenager, but his qualifications are excellent, and we have a half-dozen openings where he'd have to be better than nobody. I'll give you the right to nix it, though, because I
Yolanda looked a little alarmed. "Isn't it mostly older students? What if the Slytherins--"
? With my only companion a Muggle-born girl?"
"Have a drop too much, last night?" Seamus prodded.
The people on the street were just as unpleasant as he remembered, but from an adult perspective, he found more of them pathetic than frightening. Of course, he amended to himself as he sidestepped a grab from a hunched man with sharply pointed teeth, the scary ones might actually be more frightening now. What he found himself watching for was not hags or half-trolls or wild-eyed addicts, but the people who were a little too well dressed and too focused for the area...
Drawing his wand, he began to rotate it next to the bottles, which rose, spun, and melted together into a liquid blob. At a word from Draco, the blob stabilized in the air, and he used his wand to draw out a smaller ball of it. He lengthened that to a rod and expanded one end into a bubble, slowly pushing the space down. When he was finished, he had a glass mug that he settled on the table.
