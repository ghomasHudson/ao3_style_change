Harry felt his own hand slide to where Draco’s neck met his shoulder over soft, warm skin. His grip strong.
And it suddenly struck Harry that Malfoy hadn’t been like that since he’d come here. Harry had expected him to be, had been waiting for Malfoy to revert back to the annoying behaviour he had shown in school - surprising Harry every time he didn’t - but he hadn’t. He’d been civil, helpful even and sometimes teasing, but never more than that.
Next Malfoy transfigured the rug into a neat mattress - piling it with the bedding and pillows that Harry provided him with - after which he started to undress himself in silence, his back pointedly towards Harry. Harry decided to do the same, changing into his pyjama’s quickly, only then realising that Malfoy obviously wouldn’t have anything to wear for the night.
Okay, so, besides this whole thing making Harry feel a bit off, it had also left him with the firm knowledge that trying things out with a bloke had definitely been the right thing to do - even if said bloke had been Malfoy - and that Harry was surely going to do it again, wanting to explore a whole lot more of the possibilities now he had the chance, now he knew it could be this good.
And it obviously caught Draco’s attentions, making him look at Harry with an unreadable expression, his pupils dilating just a fraction and his cheeks turning slightly pink.
They had decided they would dance together. At this ministry ball. For all to see. It would be a strong statement, but it would also require Harry to dance, which was most definitely worrying.
Blaise looked at Draco again, scrutinising, trying to uncover everything Draco wasn’t saying. Draco usually was rather good at withstanding that gaze evenly, but he didn’t know how good of a job he was doing at this particular moment.
“Sure?” Draco’s eyes held mostly amusement, but Harry could see the genuine concern hidden underneath. Harry nodded.
It was only that evening, when Draco had been safely back in his own empty flat for a while and getting ready for bed, that he realised it was gone. For the first time in over fourteen years the necklace wasn’t around his neck.
Harry kept smiling at him, though, and he knew it was soft, completely fond. He was utterly unable to look away from the grey of Draco’s eyes and even though Draco was probably right – Molly would undoubtedly not take kindly to them being late again - Harry still pulled Draco in for a kiss, intending it to be short.
“Well, don’t let me keep you.” Draco got to his feet in one smooth movement, wincing a little at the pain it apparently still induced.
And perhaps that was good, Draco debated, perhaps it meant they could have the slightly tentative friendship that they’d had just a few weeks ago. Perhaps it meant Harry wasn’t angry at him anymore, or at least not enough to shut him out entirely.
Malfoy furrowed his brow again, just for a moment, before his face evened out once more. “No, I never do really, no time. Certainly not now I’ve got this whole cabinet thing to take care of.” He flashed Harry a wan smile.
Granted, the woman at the reception desk had been slightly taken aback when Harry had paid the full sum in cash, but he couldn’t care less. Harry didn’t have a credit card, but he did always keep Muggle money in the house, a rather large stash of it actually, mainly for cases like this one, because he
Then Harry heard a door creak open. It wasn’t Draco’s though. “I don’t know what you think you’re doing,” the man that was apparently Draco’s neighbour growled, “but whatever it is, just stop it,” adding, after he’d given Harry a quick look, “even if you are Harry Potter.”
“Harry!” At first Harry thought Draco had got out of his nightmare anyway, but his eyes were still closed. “The fire-, Harry!”
Draco’s eyes had followed Harry’s gaze to the corner and he sounded every bit as condescending as ever, when he said: “Let me assure you, I’m not drunk. I haven’t had anything since last night, really.” He huffed, adding more quietly: “And even if I had, I doubt it would have changed the answer.”
Why the bloody hell hadn’t he been told whom he would be working with? Draco’s identity would have been safe with him. He knew he could keep a secret: he’d had quite enough experience with that for fuck’s sake.
Harry watched him again, sending him a gentle smile. “It seems even more valuable to you,” Harry’s intuition said, apparently borrowing Harry’s voice for the moment. “I really think you should have it.” He smiled again, trying to lighten the mood just a bit. “It’s not like I need the money anyway.” Adding, still watching Malfoy, hoping to make clear he’d really meant it. “Please. Just take it.”
And Harry could see how that would have been awful, humiliating even, which was when Malfoy added: “Because, just so you know, I’m not doing your sodding paperwork for you.”
“So, Mr Malfoy, I would like to ask you some questions on your transition. You’re a very special case, you know.” Here she did actually look at him, her curiosity clearly winning out now she had this chance to talk to a real male Veela. “So before yesterday you hadn’t noticed anything out of the ordinary? No exceptional mood swings, for example? We know that many Veela experience these in the years leading up to their first transition.”
Draco was still leaning against the door frame. He was pale, his eyes hollow, the skin underneath raw.
Neither of them said anything for a while, just watching the stars flicker all around as if the both of them were up in the sky with them. Eventually it was Malfoy who spoke up. “It’s the constellation Leo.” His voice was soft and warm, but there also seemed to be another quality to it that Harry couldn’t quite place. Malfoy continued: “Regulus Black was named after its brightest star.”
Fortunately Harry seemed to be equally affected, kissing him back with fervour while pushing Draco’s bathrobe out of the way, trying to get to as much bare skin as he could possibly get his hands on.
“Really?” Nott made to sound cold and incredulous, as if he didn’t care. “You can’t expect for you both to get out of here that easily. That thing is definitely not important enough to me.”
Breakfast with Harry was much like the lunches they’d shared: nice, easy and utterly comfortable. They ate, talking about nothing in particular and again it felt like they hadn’t been apart since they left Hogwarts at all.
It appeared it wasn’t necessary for him to do anything about it, though, as Nott didn’t get a chance to cast at Draco again: behind him Zabini had come in. He didn’t skip a beat at seeing Nott, shooting him a fast and unrelenting
He was hit by his own projectile, which now had fragmented into tiny bits that were partly able to penetrate his frail shield.
“I do understand why you’d want your father out,” Harry now said quietly and quite without warning. He didn’t specify out of what, but that part was obvious.
Harry looked at him at that moment, for the first time today actually meeting his eye. “No, I feel fine, really.” He sounded slightly surprised.
But the voice he heard now obviously wasn’t Potter’s. It was female for starters. “Mr Malfoy was hit by a rather vicious curse.”
Again it was Harry who eventually broke the silence. “I should probably head back in,” he stated. It was true: he had been out here longer than he had anticipated and his friends would be wondering where he’d gone, but he couldn’t quite seem to get himself to move, though.
So, Draco went to his bedroom, just taking off the robes he’d still been wearing and not bothering to take off his shirt or trousers, then proceeding to lie
Okay, if Harry would never get used to Malfoy walking into his sodding living room, he was most certainly never ever going to get used to Malfoy using a
When Draco eventually got himself together again, breaking the kiss, he still felt its effects all over, leaving him slightly dizzy. Harry’s dazed gaze suggested he probably felt the same.
“Where’s Harry?” It was out, before Draco had actually had time to think about it, so he quickly added: “He brought me here, didn’t he?”
Who had owled him to come and try a new range of products for the shop. And who had subsequently showed up on Harry’s doorstep when Harry hadn’t come around to answering him straight away, taking Harry to the shop himself without preamble.
of all people. If anyone had done anything stupid tonight, it obviously was Malfoy himself. He had run off like the dramatically pompous twat he clearly still was. Whatever happened and whatever Luna thought, Malfoy evidently couldn’t have changed that much.
Zabini looked at him for a brief moment. “I think you should probably try and get a few hours of sleep. I’ll inform you if there is any progress on the case.”
Harry still wasn’t sure. His divorce from Ginny had been more than eight months ago now and he’d wanted to go to a gay club ever since. Just to try, just to know how that part of him worked, because even though he’d known he could be attracted to both men and women for quite some time now, he’d never got to discover what it would be like to be with a man.
The water wasn’t the only reason Potter’s gesture took Draco completely by surprise, though, because Potter had
And now it was eight o’clock. Harry wasn’t there yet, but he would be soon, so Draco checked himself over in his mirror one more time. The expensive, dark green Muggle suit he was wearing was perfectly tailored to his slim body and his tie was the exact shade of grey of his eyes. He looked good, even if he thought so himself.
Jones nodded, directing himself at Harry. “It would be our pleasure if you could take some of our produce off our hands. As Mr Mauvay has probably told you, we grow some of our ingredients ourselves, the stuff that actually likes the climate here that is, but some of the plants tend to do a bit too well. And I heard you would be interested in selling those on for us?”
The room was almost completely dark, just a bit of daylight leaking in through mostly drawn blinds. Next to him Draco felt that Harry was going to cast light, a barely there
When Draco woke up what must have been a few hours later, he was still on the sofa, under his bathrobe and a blanket that hadn’t even been in the living room earlier. Harry was standing by the window, watching London in all its glory below. He was just wearing his trousers, but even that made something stir inside of Draco. And it wasn’t pleasant.
“Yes, and there’s that.” Robards pondered before seemingly making a decision: “Harry, I hope you and Mr Malfoy get along.” Harry knew that Robards was aware they didn’t. “Because he’ll be your responsibility for the next week. Until we know more.”
“No, don’t say anything,” Draco was surprised by just how warm his voice sounded, how gentle. “We’re safe.” And Harry seemed to trust him, because he didn’t try to speak again, only smiled a little. Then he blacked out once more.
This time it seemed like Draco couldn’t even have this quiet moment to himself, though, because that was when he suddenly felt the tug on the wards on his flat. Draco quickly ran his hands over his face, discarding the tears as much as possible.
He looked like someone who genuinely wanted to take revenge, whatever the consequences to himself might be.
Breakfast proceeded easily enough after that, them talking anything but the case and when Blaise got up, getting ready to leave, it was almost a quarter to nine.
Draco had known that the Ministry usually sent scouts to Gringotts when they needed qualified Curse-Breakers for this team. And he had also known that Bill Weasley normally advised those scouts on who would be suitable.
a member of the venerable house of Black,” he said mock-condescendingly, softening his words further with: “Although I don’t think I will be viewed as such for much longer. Not when this heritage of mine gets out.”
Harry found Zabini’s idea of ‘easily’ was slightly different from his own as it took Zabini about an hour, but then the wards and spells had been taken apart enough for them to be able to pass through a kind of tunnel undisturbed.
“Yeah, well,” Harry said and he decided to just cut straight to the uncomfortable bit. “We need to speak to him. There has been an incident … . Has he perhaps been acting differently today, or erm-, recently?”
Either way it wasn’t Saturday yet and besides Draco wasn’t even sure they would actually encounter each other again: Potter might not even show up next time.
And suddenly there Harry was, with his warmth and his scent and …, and his everything. And Draco didn’t have the strength to push him away, like he should. The cold he had felt was gone immediately and Draco just melted into Harry’s embrace, leaning his head against the side of Harry’s.
It was just Harry being every inch the nice Gryffindor, needing the key to let some people in, no more no less.
“Mr Potter, Mr Malfoy,” she acknowledged them both. “As you are undoubtedly aware, you’re here to take the last test before you’ll be allowed to join Tracing Division. You’ve both scored more than sufficient on your earlier tests, which surely makes for high expectations on our part.” Draco allowed himself a wry smile: no pressure then. “This test is different, however, in that it evaluates your practical skills. The test will have more or less separate tasks for the Auror and the Curse-Breaker, tasks easily identifiable once you’re in. If you go about this test the right way, you should be able to finish it with minimal damage, collateral or otherwise.”
Harry was slightly surprised at himself. Why had his thoughts wandered off to Malfoy of all people? But when he looked at the schedule in front of him, he knew. Malfoy was the first person on there: next week Tuesday.
Draco got to room two in another instant, composing himself just before opening the door, walking in collected as always.
Malfoy saw, because of course he did, but instead of making some haughty comment on how he dressed with style - and Harry didn’t - he just said: “I haven’t got many of these left, but Blaise’s club is not a place to look-, well, less than your very best.”
Draco smiled back. “Well, your place actually does come with a house-elf, which would make recovering so much easier.”
Draco looked over his shoulder, somehow expecting there to be wings that he’d miraculously missed. There was nothing.
It was when Potter had just finished lunch that he suddenly got up, almost throwing his chair to the floor in the process.
And Harry hadn’t been there: only picking up on Malfoy’s distress signal when it was already too late.
“A full English it is, then.” Malfoy said, when he finally strolled into the kitchen. He sounded as arrogant as ever and he looked it too, all softness of the night before entirely gone. Still there was no malice to his words, they were just an observation.
Next he eyed the queue that was forming at the bar. “I think I should get back. But Potter …” Harry waited, but for a moment Zabini was silent, until he said: “Be careful. Draco-”
“I think-, I think it means that the part of the curse that makes him respond to questioning has been dealt with.”
“I think we’re in luck,” he had whispered, “They really are mostly standard wards with some alterations. I should be able to deal with these easily.”
Draco had to take a moment to cope with the effect those words had, a warmth spreading through him in waves: Harry really
“You could actually answer, you know, when I wish you a good morning,” Malfoy chided, but without the malice that could have been there.
Draco could feel the sweat gathering on his upper lip. He didn’t know how long he had been casting exactly, but it had been an embarrassingly long time for something as simple as a protective ring.
Harry smiled at her again, suddenly understanding. “You’re worried I might land her in trouble, because she’s late?” The girl nodded.
Harry shook his head quickly. “Of course not. We’ll just tell her that we’re trying to work things out or something.”
Blaise was still grinning. “That’s why you like me.” Then he got up. “But as amusing as this conversation is, I will have to leave you and your undoubtedly very impressive dragonfly.” Blaise smiled. “I promised Ginny I’d meet her and some others in Hogsmeade tonight, just for a few drinks before we all go home again tomorrow.”
know my translations were completely off.” Draco smiled a little, hoping that Potter would pick up on the humour he’d intended. Merlin, he felt tired. “Besides I told you I speak the language. I-.” This time it was Draco who was stopped short.
Potter had been studying him again, though, probably drawing all the wrong conclusions from Draco’s wince. “Do you play chess?”
He felt like Malfoy should’ve known that and for some reason it annoyed Harry that he apparently hadn’t.
The first thing Draco noticed when he woke up the next morning was the unmistakable, throbbing headache that too much alcohol usually left in its wake and he immediately contemplated not opening his eyes at all, knowing that that would only make things infinitely worse.
The answer really left Harry none the wiser, but he found he didn’t really care anymore as he carefully walked Malfoy to his room, leaving his arm steadily where it was.
Blaise regarded him. “I’m fairly sure you’ll find Draco in his flat and I definitely think you should talk. Draco probably misinterpreted. It happens.”
So Harry reluctantly let go, smiling at Ron. “Sorry,” Harry didn’t sound the least bit sorry, though, “but I thought this would be a good time to get back at you for everything I had to endure when you guys first got together.”
Because there they all were: the guards, standing in groups, ready to fire and Theo, in the middle somewhere.
One of the guards obviously thought this had lasted long enough, though, and he sent a curse Draco’s way that Draco deflected with practiced ease.
Harry felt an alarming need to touch him. Which he valiantly ignored, though, knowing it would probably startle Malfoy away. “Yeah,” Harry just said instead, “it should.”
Charlie’s fingers moved smoothly over the nape of his neck now and Draco let himself be pulled forward. He could smell the Firewhiskey on Charlie’s breath.
Hermione just smiled at him. “I actually eat here regularly,” she stated, which was something Draco wouldn’t know about, because until quite recently he himself obviously never had. “Ron eats here too, so we sometimes have lunch together, including Harry if possible,” Hermione continued, briefly smiling Harry’s way, making Draco feel the sting of guilt: Harry had been with Draco for lunch for the last week and a half, which had obviously kept him from seeing his friends. “Ron’s out on a field mission now, though,” Hermione then added.
He started to move. Fluent, seductive movements that he’d also had the opportunity of perfecting in all the time he’d been frequenting this place. He’d seen Potter watch him last week, had seen how Potter had apparently appreciated the view.
“Working. Which is what you should be doing too,” Draco gritted out, snappier than he had wanted to. A searing pain was actually wreaking havoc on his back now, his jaw clenching hard in an effort not to show anything, to keep his eyes open.
Of course Draco wasn’t doing anything in particular on Tuesday evening either, but there was no reason to seem too desperate.
Draco’s Saturday had passed as uneventfully as it usually did. He’d been sleeping in to start with, because he unquestionably disliked getting up early and as it was, there was quite enough of that throughout the workweek already.
again, Harry noticed. He had always known Malfoy was punctual, but really, how many times did anyone actually need to know what time it was?
He got up, head swimming unpleasantly. Draco hardly noticed he’d sent his chair flying to the floor behind him. It was so hot in here, the burn in his back excruciating. He needed some fresh air.
He stayed in there for a degenerately long time and then some, feeling the water sluice over his body, warm, comforting. And
When Harry ordered breakfast the next morning Malfoy wasn’t up yet. Over the past three weeks, however, they’d fallen into a routine where they’d had breakfast together more often than not and Harry knew exactly what Malfoy normally had: toast, usually rather heavily buttered, and tea that was much too sweet to Harry’s taste. That was it.
“So, curses and potions,” Potter stated, picking the books up from their pile and looking at their titles. “Makes sense.” He sounded a bit like he was talking to himself. “You always
“Of course he won’t,” Blaise simply agreed, which really didn’t help matters. “But perhaps you should change the way you’ve been approaching him. You’ve owled him, correct?”
It was definitely not the sort of luxury setting Malfoy had grown up in, but it hardly could have been, seeing as Malfoy Manor, and all of their other possessions, had been confiscated by the Ministry after the trials.
It had lasted all the months leading up to the new school year, and Draco had even started to believe it could be more, that
Harry could see the exact moment that he did, though, for Draco sat up straight in one movement, obviously regretting it immediately and putting his hand to his, undoubtedly also pounding, head.
When Harry got home, early the next morning, the rest of the night had gone by in a blissfully Malfoy-free haze. Well, almost. Sort of. Apart from the times Harry had thought he’d seen Malfoy’s hair, which, when he’d looked closer, had never been quite the right shade of blond.
and all that, but she didn’t, just sticking to: “I really think your test results were quite correct: the both of you are going to make Tracing Division proud.” She stopped for a beat, adding: “Already have, actually.”
Hermione had just told Harry that Draco had said something about being tired and that he’d looked upset. And although Harry had noticed that she had wanted to talk about this some more, he really hadn’t felt up to it. She had probably reached conclusions that he really wasn’t ready to discuss with her, or anyone else, just now.
Harry now knew that life had taught Draco the hard way and Draco had actually learnt. Making him more attractive than he’d ever been before. Inside and out.
“A few hours. In the end we decided it would be best to keep you sedated for a while: the first transition is usually extremely painful, you know, even if it is only partial.”
It was strangely satisfying that now they had, having fallen asleep intertwined like this, tired and sated after yet another mind-blowing experience, and Harry still vividly remembered how Draco’s fingers had touched his cheek softly, almost reverently, before they’d both fallen asleep.
“I should be going too,” Draco quite superfluously stated. He sounded slightly hesitant, as if he wasn’t entirely sure it was a good idea, either.
“That bacon is absolutely delicious.” They’d been eating in silence for a while, but now Malfoy had just made this comment. Out of the blue. And Harry agreed, his bacon had turned out to be quite nice, but this still took him completely by surprise. Malfoy had actually paid him a compliment, a real, full-blown one. Not even a ‘sort of’ one.
When that Tuesday after class his umpteenth owl had returned looking exactly the way it had when he’d sent it, Harry couldn’t take it anymore. He’d had to do something, so he’d gone to Draco’s flat straight after work, having apparated right to its front door effortlessly.
Besides it was Potter. The same Potter he’d been to school with. The Potter he had ridiculed, because he couldn’t have anything else. That Potter. And of course nothing had changed there, not really, but well, perhaps he could just allow himself this, the ease, the geniality, just for now. Just for today.
Then Draco turned, picking Harry up with great care. Harry was bleeding, but even in his current haze Draco noted it wasn’t as bad as it could have been. This could be healed. He just had to get Harry to hospital quickly.
“I came to get her out,” David said, “but they just laughed at me, so I demanded to see Alice. Her boyfriend: John something, I don’t know his last name, came with her, though. He only came to have a laugh, I suppose, because he basically just told me to leave. Alice wouldn’t be coming with me, anyway, he said. She was in no fit state to actually leave even if he were willing to let her go. And he was right. She was completely out of it, hardly even remembered me at all.” David stopped talking, his words soft with tears.
It very quickly became clear he was in no such luck, though, when Malfoy wandered in out of his bedroom.
“Yes, well, you could say that again,” Draco couldn’t help but smile a little too. “Subtle is definitely a word for it, although I’m still not sure whether to be extremely happy about that or absolutely offended,” Draco added in a bout of honesty that took him completely by surprise.
And it was okay. It really was. This just went to show how this couldn’t have worked anyway. Potter had his friends, this whole group of people around him. And Draco was no part of that, never would be.
In the end Mr Jones decided Kendrick actually knew about his ingredients and how to get the good stuff and when he shook Harry’s hand again, agreeing on the sale, it was decidedly less warily and more expectantly. “We would like to take these ingredients off your hands. I understand you already negotiated a price with Mr Mauvay?” Harry just nodded. “And we look forward to your next visit. When do you think you could produce the rest of the ingredients on our list?”
And Mathew had talked to that man willingly, because for whatever reason he was working with them. He was working with whomever wanted this Time-Turner.
And he found it didn’t even shock him anymore, either. The feeling was there and for some reason it made complete sense: Harry realised he’d had this feeling for a while now, he just hadn’t recognised it for what it was.
Potter watched for a moment, his gaze softer than Draco had expected. Then he turned to the books Draco had pulled out of his library.
And suddenly the box opened, at first just emitting a deep, impenetrable darkness. It startled Harry, but it only lasted for a moment, because almost immediately stars began to appear, flying from the box, beautifully bright, effortlessly taking up their consecutive places in the velvety dark.
Draco noticed the words came easier than they would normally come: he was tired, really, very tired. And that meant he would have to be careful as to what he said, not giving away too much. Around Harry it was always so easy to give away too much.
he knew, because over the last few weeks Hermione had taken every opportunity to make absolutely sure he understood its significance – and that’s why he’d come in the first place. He’d never actually liked dances in the first place and something like this: a formal banquet with speeches and all, followed by a ball. Well, he would gladly have forgotten all about ever even having received the invitation.
Harry’s grin only got broader and he felt like they might have crossed another line altogether, like Draco felt as much at ease with Harry as Harry was feeling at ease with him.
Harry didn’t even answer him, just feeling a seething anger course through him, all of which he channelled into his casting.
So, the stairs it was, then. By the time Harry had resigned himself to having to walk up to the twelfth floor, Malfoy had already darted up to the first. “Do keep up.”
So he went to get the parcel from the bedside table where he’d left it, hoping that Harry would like it, suddenly unsure.
“Why did you come here?” Potter’s anger seemed to have passed somewhat, being replaced by what sounded like curiosity and something else, something Draco wasn’t able to pinpoint exactly.
“Good, because I’ve already given up the suite in Brussels and I’m here now and I really wouldn’t want to stay at the Manor, because it’s empty and horrible and-.” It all came out in a rush of utter relief and Harry stopped Draco’s words by cupping his jaw, touching Draco’s mouth with his thumb, while Harry felt himself smile at him entirely too fondly.
If Harry was surprised to find himself in Draco’s flat, he didn’t show it and Draco didn’t have time to register how he himself felt about it either.
“Well, I think we shouldn’t dance at all, especially if you actually care for the use of your toes. I haven’t improved since the Yule ball, really,” Harry heard himself say next.
Harry concluded it was too late to think about that at this moment, so he didn’t, instead just opting to turn the television off and go to bed.
Harry noticed the suitcase was wizarding and could probably easily have taken the contents of the whole room.
“Harry!” Hermione’s voice was conspicuously close to his bedroom door, but he still tried to ignore it, burying himself under his pillow. “Harry, are you in here?” Of course he was and she knew it. He just groaned.
It took Harry a brief moment to catch up: Malfoy thought he’d come here to get the Constellation Box back. “I already told you, I don’t want it back. It’s yours.” Harry heard the slight annoyance to his voice. Why couldn’t the twat just accept something without immediately making a big deal out of it.
Harry found Draco on the sofa again, but this time he wasn’t asleep. He was reading, leaning against the back of the sofa, one leg tucked under himself, his other foot still on the floor.
“Sulking on your own.” Astoria’s words, absolutely not phrased as a question, were accompanied by a soft touch on his upper arm. Draco realised he’d become used to her touch: it had been a constant over the past fourteen years, always just there when he’d needed it.
Harry smiled at Draco, surely radiating all the warmth he felt, but when he tried to cup Draco’s jaw, Draco warded him off, wary all of a sudden. “You’d like me to-, what exactly? Be clear, Potter.” And for all his arrogance, his indifference, there was a plea to his voice.
Harry hadn’t had time to wonder where all the real guards, or Theodore Nott himself for that matter, had gone, but if he
“Yes, well, wait, that would have been precisely a week ago today.” Blaise seemed to seriously try and recollect whether he’d found a laughing Harry Potter in their room that night. “No, can’t remember.” He shot Draco another grin. “He must have cast a solid silencing charm.”
Draco was still watching him. “Not really,” he eventually just said, not quite looking at Harry. It sounded clipped and distant. “But
When Draco woke up again he was lying on the sofa flat out, his shoes were off and he was under a blanket that hadn’t been there when he’d fallen asleep. He turned slowly, registering that light was streaming in through curtains that obviously failed at doing their job of keeping it out. He’d slept like a proverbial log, though, hadn’t even come close to waking up any time throughout the night. Or part of the morning apparently.
“I assure you we want to bring them down.” For a moment the boy just stood there, watching Zabini, looking into his eyes, trying to find the truth.
He apparated out before he’d even thought of the wards. Luckily they were still set on letting him through.
She didn’t seem to think any of it, though. “Yes, I have been asked to escort you there. We will arrange for your luggage to be brought up, too.”
“And you all agree on this?” was all Draco could come up with next. He knew more people in their year had signed up to be Aurors, remembering he’d heard Ron, Neville and Padma talking about it.
And that was when he spotted it: a hooded person at the back of the room getting up just after he did, watching him for just a beat too long.
And besides Harry’s prowess being very helpful in their current situation, Draco had to admit it was also utterly attractive.
“You were having a good time last Friday, weren’t you? You know, with Wood. You would be perfect together,” Draco said casually, when he spoke up again. It almost sounded like he didn’t care. Almost.
“You know you’re terrible, don’t you?” Harry smiled, finding Draco mouth for a quick, but extremely promising kiss. “But yeah, I think so.”
Harry noticed Draco had retreated to the far corner of the room and for a moment Harry thought he didn’t want anything to do with Harry’s friends. Until Harry remembered Draco actually had Hermione’s phone number in his phone and Harry looked again: Draco looked uncertain, as if he felt he didn’t belong and for some reason it made Harry’s heart ache a little.
They danced and it somehow felt secure and comfortable now - much more so than it ever had before - Draco’s body slotting next to Harry’s as if it was made to do so: lean, warm and utterly alluring. Harry could feel the tension between them building like an invisible fire, impossible to quench.
Sometimes Harry really, really missed Ron. Granted, Ron probably wouldn’t have trusted Malfoy either, but he
okay. You don’t have to-,” Harry started, but Draco couldn’t let him finish, he couldn’t afford himself the luxury.
“Finally, there you are,” Blaise greeted him the moment Draco entered The Leaky. “I actually was on the verge of assembling a rescue party to get you out of the Ministry, just in case an evil object had eaten you alive.”
“Oh, and they don’t speak English very well, so I’ve taken the liberty of asking the only one of our colleagues who speaks French to join you. He’ll translate,” he heard Agatha say to Potter when he rounded the corner on Monday morning.
Until Harry started to shift, turning to Draco’s side, but still holding him up with one strong arm at the same time. “We’re going upstairs,” Harry’s voice was low and a bit gravelly.
Harry smiled at that and he found it was genuine. “No, it probably wouldn’t have been. So, you don’t think we should go into those threats while we’re at it? I mean, as I’m here anyway.”
“And there’s just one way out of here, which also seems to lead through lots of guards, or whatever they are. I should think the Cartel will have drafted in all staff that can fire a decent spell at us by now, so we’re probably going to have even more of an unwelcoming reception when we get out of here than the one we already had. Not to mention that Theo will undoubtedly have been freed,” Draco’s voice had become even  quieter, as if he was mainly talking to himself, just summing up everything they would be up against.
Draco just nodded, not really knowing where this went and being quite certain that wherever it was, it couldn’t be anywhere good.
And so what, if it didn’t come out its usual silver, but glowing orange, harbouring a fire and strength that apparently made the Dementors wisely decide not to stick around any longer. They didn’t even try to penetrate the shield his Patronus put up this time, they just left.
Draco was utterly surprised at what he found in Potter’s eyes though: his gaze now openly heated, enticing. Draco had seen his fair share of those gazes over time, enough to recognise it exactly for what it was. He just had never expected to see it on Potter, most certainly not directed at him and definitely not after that debacle last week.
Today Draco had made it into Training even earlier than he usually did on Tuesday mornings, but apparently it hadn’t been early enough, because he still hadn’t been able to finish grading his students’ essays. And now he had to go. To Potter’s office.
Draco probably knew this too, because he didn’t comment when Harry lay so close that his chest was effectively pressed up to Draco’s back, his arm over Draco’s chest, their fingers interlaced as always.
Still within earshot of the guards, Francois started talking. “Kendrick, so glad you could make it. Did you bring the goods? Because we would very much like to see what you would be able to supply us with and whether the quality meets our standards. Our previous supplier was found sorely lacking in that respect.”
Nott apparently wasn’t done yet, though. “How are you parents, by the way? I heard your mother isn’t doing too well, living in that cottage of hers in France without your father.” Nott studied Draco’s face for a beat again, to see what the effect of his words had been, but now there was nothing there but stony indifference. Nott continued, more seriously, all mockery gone: “You know the Cartel would actually love to have you: your expertise on potions would be greatly appreciated here - you might even have noticed the small reference I thought I’d make to your name when I chose our logo – so if you’d work with us we’d pay you a royal salary and you’d have enough time to spare to actually visit you mother regularly. I heard she complained-.”
Draco also knew it wasn’t something people like him got to have, though. He’d learnt that the hard way. And then he’d settled for the next best thing. Which was now taken away from him, too.
“What kind of understanding?” It was a stupid question and really it shouldn’t matter, but for some reason it did. It mattered a lot and Harry needed to know.
“Ron!” he screamed and it came out painful and raw. Ron had been there, just a moment ago, but Harry couldn’t find him anywhere anymore. He started scanning the debris. There was so much of it.
Draco didn’t know whether it was all the Firewhiskey he’d had, but he felt himself lean in a bit. Why wouldn’t he? It could be fun and it wasn’t like he had anyone to go home to anyway.
So Draco had gone outside into the garden, having decided that some fresh air would do him good. The garden must have been beautiful once, but now most of the plants were overgrown, the flowers few and far between. It reminded Draco of the gardens at the Manor, which looked more or less like this one, because his mother had effectively abandoned them. Just the rose garden remained, her favourite and the only garden she was still willing and able to put some effort into.
Malfoy shot him a faintly amused glance. “Well, I think it’s probably best if I show you. It’s in my office. Would you care to come along?”
It was a very strange realisation to have in the early morning with a horrible headache and Draco still sleeping peacefully beside him. Okay, Harry had known he had started to like Draco better of late, but going from that to this definite, obvious, physical attraction. Well, it was something that would likely take some getting used to.
impatient as well, “I’m only saying we could call her. I think that’s probably safer than using an owl or the Floo network in this case.”
So Harry just proceeded to look for the things he needed in his Auror robes as both were standard issue. It didn’t take him long to find them.
“Of course you are. Francois,” Harry said, pointedly looking at him, trying to soften the look with a faint smile.
And Potter hadn’t been entirely accurate, either. Draco hadn’t been acquitted so much. He and his mother just hadn’t been imprisoned, mainly because Potter testified on their behalf. The Malfoys
So, Harry swiftly cleared his head of images of Dolores Umbridge scrutinising all teachers at Hogwarts and looked up the room where Malfoy would be teaching.
When shifting position he felt the now more or less familiar pain flare again and winced a little. Well, it wasn’t quite as bad as before and he
“I just supposed we could have lunch together. You know, since neither of us has had any yet,” Harry clarified. He pushed one of the baguettes towards Malfoy. “I thought you might like this one. They’re from the canteen and, well, their coffee isn’t particularly good, but their baguettes usually are,” adding, feeling slightly uncertain all of a sudden. “At least I like them.”
It was a feeling he hadn’t had in a long time and he should probably tamp it down, before it became something he’d get used to. Before it would be taken away again. Before Harry would realise what he actually meant to Draco.
“Yes?” Draco turned to face Harry, but he didn’t say anything else, not even commenting on the use of his first name. His gaze was intent, though, almost expectant.
So here he was, not sure it was a good idea for a whole variety of reasons, but completely unable to turn away from it all the same.
But of course that just couldn’t last, ending abruptly when a mediwitch came in with Harry’s breakfast. Draco moved back as if stung, taking this opportunity to excuse himself, to get out with at least most of his pride still intact.
Malfoy smiled right back. It was a slightly hesitant thing, though, and Harry couldn’t help but notice how soft he looked again: his hair all tousled and falling in his face in places he would never have allowed it to throughout the day.
But invading their small group now felt like too much of an intrusion. So Draco decided to turn around and leave. Which, of course, was the moment Harry saw him.
“Well, we really should be off now,” Harry said. They had stuck with the holiday story, although Nurie, the girl’s mother, had conspicuously refrained from asking where they were actually going.
“No, just you,” Draco’d said it without thinking and he really wanted to elaborate: he should explain how Harry made him feel. It felt like something he should do, like something important, but his eyes just felt so heavy and he decided to close them first.
Whatever the reason Luna was here, it was still really nice to have her over. Harry made them both tea and they talked, about how her and Neville’s plant nursery was doing - very well indeed - how Harry liked working with Terry Boot – not very well at all – and then, before Harry was even really aware of what was happening, the conversation just shifted to Malfoy and his forced presence in Harry’s life.
, all of it, the tea, the food he liked, everything. “I’ll do it. I suppose you still don’t stock any decent tea, though.” Draco drawled. At least that came out the way he’d intended it to.
Draco just nodded. “Yes, I do. The question is: do you?” There was a challenge to his voice, but it wasn’t menacing, like once it would have been.
They kept moving together like that for a while. Neither of them trying to get closer or do anything else, just moving to the music, to the beat that always reverberated through clubs like this one throughout the night.
Okay, so now Draco apparently had the attention span of a goldfish: nothing he read seemed to stick, making him have to read the same passage at least three times for it to register. It was utterly infuriating.
Draco just nodded at that, after which they went their separate ways. Draco had to admit that the whole thing left him rather stunned, because today, after the first awkwardness, Harry had been perfectly decent towards him. Nothing more of course, but it had been much better than Draco had expected.
“And who …?” Potter’s question got stuck in his throat when he looked up to see Draco. He was wearing an expression Draco couldn’t quite figure out. Well, at least it wasn’t full-on contempt. “So you speak French?” Potter asked, slightly baffled.
“So, still here, I see.” Smith was standing a few feet away, spitting his vitriol. Draco looked up at him slowly, feeling bone-tired all of a sudden. “And Harry’s still your bodyguard. What happened? Can’t poor Malfoy take care of himself?” For that last sentence Smith had used a voice that sounded so much like Moaning Myrtle it almost made Draco laugh. He stifled it straight away, though. Smith actually
, before smiling at Harry professionally. They had been having regular meetings for the last three weeks, but nothing much had come of it yet.
“How the hell do you even know where I live?” Draco knew it wasn’t the most polite, or adequate for that matter, response to someone standing on your doorstep to return your locket, the one you quite inconveniently lost at their place.
Harry Apparated straight home, but not into the library, because he didn’t know what would be waiting for him there. So instead, when he’d fully materialised again, he found himself in the mostly disused parlour next to the library, where he cast an Auror strength Disillusionment Charm on himself. Then he proceeded into the library.
Harry noticed some of his standard Auror Wards had been broken now, though, but luckily he had also cast less common ones on his house, including some of the more recently developed Wards that not all of them used, or even knew about, yet.
The rest of the afternoon was spent reading the casefile on their assigned case. They would be clearing a house that had been a safehouse for a group of Death Eaters.
Draco didn’t seem to agree, though, getting out of bed in moments, leaving Harry strangely cold all of a sudden. “You don’t, you know,” Harry answered slightly uncertainly, but definitely meaning it anyway. “I wouldn’t mind if you stayed a bit longer. We could even have breakfast, if you wanted.”
Furthermore Harry liked Zabini. He hadn’t actually seen him for the past few months, but they’d had to work together on more than one occasion over the years, because Zabini worked in a Covert Ops part of the Auror Department that had been established after the war, at first mostly to seek out dark wizards and later to find any criminals that had proven to be especially difficult to find. Harry’s team had had to rely on Zabini’s team for intel a few times and although they hadn’t quite reached first name basis just yet, they had found they worked well together. Harry was genuinely glad to see Zabini here.
Neither of them had brought up Draco’s current predicament and Draco hadn’t told anyone else yet, either, not even his mother. The humps on his back had retracted, so there were no visible remains anymore and Draco had decided it could wait, at least until he knew exactly how his Veela traits worked and how to deal with them. Otherwise there wouldn’t be too much to tell anyway, he’d concluded.
Harry nodded, starting to tell Zabini about the rest of yesterday: how he had been brought in and how Draco – Harry had decided he’d keep calling Draco by his first name whatever Zabini might think - had most likely located the Cartel’s headquarters. He ended his story by telling Zabini that Draco had been in late and quite exhausted, most likely having been rather unpleasantly questioned.
“Oh, you’re finally here,” Harry smiled at him, “See those statuettes?” Draco nodded, although he knew it had been a rather rhetorical question, “Well, we thought we’d have a closer look at them, but when we wanted to walk into their circle we found we couldn’t. We think there are wards of some kind, guarding something. It’s conspicuously empty in the middle, don’t you think?”
Harry was positioned next to the door of the dining hall and apart from the servant (apparently no house elves here) that had shoved a plate of food into his hands at some point, no one paid him any attention.
Harry just gave him a slightly strange look, before saying: “I’d like you to stay.” Okay, so Harry definitely didn’t want to be alone.
Robards considered this for just a moment, letting the facts sink in. Hermione Granger was the leading expert on anything memory related. Robards knew that, but he also knew she wouldn’t be back before next Saturday evening. “Okay, but Mr Malfoy
But Harry wanted to do something, to say something to make this whole thing go away. The only problem was that he didn’t have a clue as to what.
And Harry rather muzzily realised they would most likely end up having to dress at top speed, hoping to make it to The Burrow in time, but he couldn’t bring himself to care: it was definitely worth it.
“Harry, there you are.” Ginny smiled at him, drawing him into the conversation with ease, as she always did. “This is Mabel.” Okay, now he remembered where he’d seen her before. Mabel worked at the Department of Magical Transportation. “Yes, of course. You’re responsible for our Portkeys,” he said.
“Yeah, and I didn’t really know how to-,” the man tried to explain, “I’ve never had to call in the Aurors before.” So, that’s why the owner of the shop had been late calling them in. Harry understood how that would have worked, because although it had changed somewhat over the past few years, Knockturn still wasn’t the sort of place where Aurors were typically particularly welcome.
taken you out. I could never have left you there.” And he repeated it, over and over, and over again, until Draco would actually hear it.
It had taken two owls – why couldn’t Slytherins just answer fucking owls? – and some convincing on Blaise’s doorstep, but now Harry was in Blaise’s living room, apparently having intruded on a dinner for two, if the dinner table was any indication.
When Draco woke up again, he felt much clearer, although he wasn’t entirely sure that was a good thing given the circumstances. Luna was by his bedside again too and for some reason, now, in his less sedated state, he felt disappointed.
“I don’t think it’s fair you know all about mine - even through there’s not much to know really - but I don’t know anything about yours,” Harry continued. Then he stopped for a beat, his eyes sparkling, but also just the slightest bit hesitant. He was watching Draco intently, apparently gauging his reaction, then threw in, still in that teasing tone of voice: “For example: did you at some point have a fling with Pansy Parkinson?”
So Harry told him, about the wedding and how nice it had been, and about how he had seen so many people he’d lost contract with over the years.
He did know it somehow suited him, though. Which made it inconveniently difficult to react to what Malfoy had said, so Harry just went with a simple: “I needed to finish something at work.”
Harry didn’t know and decided to leave it for now, waiting for the bathroom door to open and close for a second time, then picking himself up off the bed and making it to the shower.
Malfoy seemed to be alone - which felt like much more of a relief than it probably should have - locking eyes with Harry as soon as he got back to the dance floor. Harry took that as the invitation he hoped it was.
make the wrong decisions. I deserved what was coming. I was really lucky not to have to go to Azkaban in the first place.”
When Draco spotted Potter, he was standing against a wall, looking around, catching Draco’s eye almost the moment he came in. Draco was drawn his way without even thinking about it, their eyes locked all the time it took Draco to reach him.
Okay, Blaise actually had a point there. Harry hadn’t even thought of that aspect yet, but Blaise was right: even though
Harry made it to standing remarkably fluidly, swaying a bit when he was upright, though. Draco was by his side in a short moment, steadying him.
“Come,” Harry addressed Draco, ignoring Smith altogether now and he started  walking towards the lifts.
should go,” he said to Penelope next, passing her the broken handle of an umbrella that was obviously a Portkey. “Good luck. We’ll take care of this,” Mathew finished, indicating the statuettes and the house at large with a vague wave of his hand.
exactly. I-, I just needed to know something.” Harry stopped and Draco found himself watching Harry, willing him to go on, to tell him what Harry had wanted to ask Luna, what he apparently hadn’t felt like asking Draco.
Harry nodded. Whatever this would turn out to be, it wasn’t something to take on in an establishment full of witches and wizards and certainly not the ones that seemed to frequent
Late in the afternoon they’d been called away from the warehouse they’d been surveying, however, to investigate a theft, no potions this time, but something important all the same: a wizard’s wand had been stolen.
This time, when Harry knocked, Malfoy’s answer took slightly longer again. Then the door swung open.
Draco just watched him silently for a beat, his eyes betraying confusion, hurt and uncertainty in equal measure. “I-, didn’t you notice? Your library was a complete mess. I thought I could catalogue it: putting everything on the same subject together in alphabetical order. I assumed it would be easier for you to actually use your library that way.”
“Malfoy?” But no answer came and after about five minutes of waiting fruitlessly, Harry went downstairs again.
intended to be there, but he just needed all his strength to actually get up, exhaustion and that bloody pain clawing him down the moment he tried to stand.
“Yeah, exactly. And you definitely still need to recover, which would be completely impossible in your own flat, all alone.” It was probably not meant to be taken too seriously, but Draco registered how absolutely sincere Harry’s voice had gone. And it made something warm nestle in Draco's chest. Something that was there more often than not when he was with Harry.
He didn’t dress yet though, just putting on pants and a dressing gown and getting to the kitchen, where he started to do what he’d gotten up for, making everything he knew Harry liked for breakfast: toast, eggs, sausages and bacon accompanied by large quantities of tea to wash it all down with.
Harry didn’t say anything for a beat, then obviously decided to speak his mind anyway: “I thought your marriage to Astoria … . Well, I just thought your marriage was meant to result in that, you know, children.”
Harry shook his head. “No, it sounded like Latin, though, something beginning with Some-, ending in -um.”
with Muggles. And, well, I still regularly venture out into the Muggle world.” He paused, apparently not sure whether he should elaborate, then deciding not to, falling silent.
Harry had no idea what time it was when he woke up next to Draco, but he didn’t even bother to cast a
The only light in the room seemed to be coming from the street lamps outside, otherwise it was completely dark, slightly cold and uncompromisingly empty.
Harry saw how Draco struggled to keep his temper in check. His knuckles white from clutching his still lowered wand, his face a pale, transfixed mask.
Draco turned away quickly, couldn’t actually watch this. Then he apparated out of Harry’s house on the spot.
This confused Harry, which apparently showed, because Malfoy continued, slightly flustered: “Let’s just say it’s nothing out of the ordinary.”
When Harry emerged from the kitchen again, Draco wasn’t at the table anymore and for one heart-stopping moment Harry thought he must have left. Until he realized this was actually
Harry nodded: after Hedwig he hadn’t owned an owl for a long time, but about four years ago he’d finally given in: deciding that communication would actually be a lot easier if he had one himself. “What for?” The question was out before he could think the better of it.
Then, when Draco had reached Potter, he just grabbed hold of Draco’s arm, followed by the swift and slightly nauseating tug of Apparition, astonishingly landing them smack in the middle of Potter’s bedroom, Potter’s lips were on his again as soon as the world had stopped spinning, his hands roaming free all over Draco’s body as if he couldn’t decide where to start. And Draco just noticed his own hands doing something similar, right before he stopped thinking altogether.
“You’re looking for Curse-Breaker Malfoy?” Draco’s colleague Penelope Lassiter asked. She was a prim looking witch with unexpectedly friendly eyes that Harry had consulted on more than one occasion. He nodded.
“Push it under his door,” Harry suddenly realised. “Would that actually work? He ignored all of my owls,” Harry hesitated, still insecure yet hopeful somehow.
Draco frowned. He wracked his brain, but in the muddle that was this afternoon he couldn’t find anything about having been told about his heritage, at least not before Luna had broached the subject, and he certainly didn’t recollect asking anyone not to tell his family about it.
Harry took the glint of humour in Malfoy’s eyes for what it was, noticing that, for some reason, he didn’t even really want to provoke Malfoy anymore. “Nothing, I guess. Here in Belgium I’m just a bloke with a stupid scar, apparently.” Harry smiled a little, then said: “It is nice, though, not to be stared at. I’d almost forgotten what that felt like,” realizing, as he said it, that it was quite true.
Well, and of course Draco’d had to go and hit that particularly lucky jackpot. As if just being a Death Eater hadn’t been enough of a problem, already.
Then he turned, presumably to leave the room, but he stumbled a little and Harry was there, steadying Draco by his elbow, before he’d even noticed.
Draco still had to determine whether that was a good thing, whether he could actually trust this-, well, whatever it was they had, whether it would hold.
“But I really need to go now,” Draco said next. It was true: they’d been at the cafe a lot longer than Draco had anticipated. The coffee had been worth it, though. So had the company.
It had been an absolute relief: Lisa didn’t comment on Malfoy being in Harry’s house at all and at first Harry’d thought she might not know, but then they’d been talking about the potions thefts and she had broached the subject. She hadn’t said anything demeaning about Malfoy, however, just stating that she was glad that maybe Malfoy would be able to shed some light on the case when he’d retrieved his memory, because the whole thing still didn’t seem to be going anywhere without it.
And Harry didn’t know what about it astounded him more: Malfoy eating just one rather simple sandwich for lunch or the fact that it was a supermarket sandwich at that.
“Just so we’re clear: if I had to choose between going back to you or to him, it would be him anytime.” Right, so much for the not-wasting-his-breath on Terry part. And Harry knew he’d said it without thinking and probably a bit too loud, but he had meant every word.
“Same.” A beat of silence in which they were just standing there, staring at each other. “Zabini said there’s a Portkey back to London for you.” Draco then said. His words sounded matter-of-factly enough, but his brows were slightly furrowed and Harry realised he looked sort of uncertain.
doing here?” someone now spat. It was Smith, apparently still the same little shithead, even if he was wearing Auror robes.
More than anything his feelings for Harry were like an itch, something Draco rather desperately wanted to scratch although he knew it wouldn’t solve anything, that it would only make things worse.
Harry decided to hold out his hand and smiled, a bit tentatively, because admittedly some things just needed getting used to, but it was there all the same.  “Perhaps we should start over. Hi, I’m Harry.”
Harry wanted to comment, to say that he was already wearing a T-shirt, so what was the point, but he didn’t want to seem rude, so he put it on. Next he felt the light tingle of magic over his trousers which seemed to make them just slightly tighter.
“No, Potter, there isn’t.” The truth of the matter was that his attacker had been sneaking up behind him. Usually Draco tried to be really careful, keeping close to buildings, preferably with windows, and always watchful, but yesterday he’d been in an, admittedly rather deserted, Muggle area and he hadn’t been as attentive as he’d normally be.
Potter wasn’t there, of course. Draco really was ridiculously early, the club not packed with people yet. And Draco decided that was a good thing: he would be able to dance and talk to people, perhaps even pull, before Potter would even get here.
He handed it over to Ron, who seemed a bit taken aback and it was only after what seemed like a long moment that Ron spoke up: “Well, I think we should probably take this to the Ministry as soon as possible, straight to Robards I should think. The sooner this whole thing is over, the sooner we can all go back home. Coming, mate?”
It was the other thing that Harry saw, though, the softness, that made him reach up and touch Draco’s cheek, tentatively, still not sure whether Draco would let him.
He hadn’t visited that particular club since, hadn’t wanted to run into Potter again. It was a road he’d been on before and he knew from experience where it led.
The answer came when Potter started to walk off the floor to a dark, secluded nook, looking behind him once, to see if Draco was following.
“I-, I didn’t know,” he then said honestly. “They didn’t tell me. I just gave them your wand, you know, after-, and I supposed they’d give it back to you, at least straight after the trials.”
Draco was still clutching Harry tight to his chest. Which was good. He was going to keep Harry safe.
“And? Is it what you expected?” Draco was curious, but he realized his voice sounded sort of quiet, tentative. Perhaps this wasn’t the sort of question Potter would appreciate.
It was one of the things they didn’t talk about when Draco visited his mother, but he knew that she did. It was the reason why she had stopped caring for a lot of things. And it was hard seeing her like that, because as much as he didn’t like his father and his father’s opinions anymore, he did still love his mother and he didn’t want her to hurt.
Potter considered him briefly, almost like he wanted to see whether Draco was actually interested. Then he answered: “Mostly yes, but, well, sticking to the rules is not really -, you know, something I’m very good at. Sometimes it’s just rubbish, following procedure when you can just
At work Potter denied their weekly encounters at the club just as much as Draco did and Draco was quite sure Potter wouldn’t want him to be there in the morning, when he woke up, before Potter would go and have lunch with the Weasleys. It would be awkward beyond words.
Once he was sitting down Draco had Accio-ed his chess set. It was wizarding and beautiful, made out of ebony an alabaster, the pieces visibly happy to be let out of the box.
“If you say so.”  Harry said giving him a somewhat pointed look. “Otherwise I would have thought you’d been asleep on my sofa.”
“So you never had any children?” Draco didn’t have a clue where Harry’s thoughts had gone when he was eating, but this question was apparently where they had ended up.
That’s when Harry saw what the package held. In hitting the floor it had apparently opened up slightly and a stick poked out. It was made of wood.
“No, it wasn’t anything like that,” Draco hastened to say, catching up with what Blaise was most probably implying. “He wasn’t here for-. I told you, he just came to lend me a book.”
dance with him, though? You know, since you brought him here.” It sounded rather base even to his own ears.
When Draco saw them, their threesome comfortably whole, there was just a short moment of indecisiveness. Draco had gotten to some sort of truce with Weasley and he’d learned to appreciate Granger – although he would probably never tell her that in so many words - who was smart as a whip and thoroughly decent. She’d been the first one to make her peace with him, treating him like a wizard and not someone best completely ignored.
Because however well they got along now, that would definitely be a deal-breaker: Draco was quite sure Harry wasn’t at all interested in anything beyond friendship.
“Your, erm-,” Harry started, obviously struggling to say something and Draco actually saw the moment Harry decided to just go for it. “Your lips are erm-,” he said, not finishing, but brushing his fingers over Draco’s upper lip instead, wiping at the moisture that was undoubtedly there. It was a gesture of such intense gentleness that it left Draco completely breathless.
He didn’t add that that was probably for the best, since he was hardly eligible, considering the side he’d been on throughout the war.
And even if they weren’t together Potter had never dated men, had he? And least of all Ex Death Eaters.
Malfoy had actually kept his word and made it an exceptionally quick visit, but it had still been awkward. Mrs Malfoy hadn’t commented on their explanation for visiting together, but she had kept shooting Harry quick glances that undoubtedly meant something, although Harry didn’t have a clue as to what. It had left him feeling decidedly unsettled.
if we’re late for lunch again. Especially since we can’t stay long. Shirin has a French test tomorrow and you know I promised-.” Draco’s face had gone all serious again. Tutoring was very important to him: he hadn’t missed one single session. And for some reason that always did something to Harry. “Don’t give me that look,” Draco said next, his voice both warm and pleading somehow.
“Well, you have obviously experienced some physical changes, as I’ve just seen.” She stopped just for a moment, writing something down. “And Allure? Well, you’re obviously really easy on the eye,” she blushed again, “but is there any-?”
Malfoy looked up, smiling in a way that on anyone else would have been teasing, but on Malfoy, Harry wasn’t quite sure. Perhaps it was taunting. “Yes, I mainly use it to text people. And to play rather stupid games. It really isn’t that hard to use. Not even for you.”
It was not really a question. They knew they would be leaving together, but Draco liked the way the dark in his words, the low purr of his voice, still effected Harry. And he knew Harry did too.
Up until now Draco had been quiet, but as if on cue he started talking in his sleep, his voice sounding strangled and utterly terrified: “No, don’t, don’t leave! The fire …, Harry!”.
The Healer that started casting diagnostics on Harry was a witch with a friendly face that Harry recognized from the British Room, but that he hadn’t really talked to much.
never seemed to spend his days in their suite, though. (‘Really, Potter, why should I stay here: much too tedious. There are people to see and things to do throughout the day too, you know. Don’t worry, though. They’re hardly bodyguard-type meetings.’ Malfoy had actually smirked at that.)
Draco smiled a little, languidly, unfocussed, then unexpectedly leant his head against Harry’s shoulder. “’S nice.”
“No, but I’m fine,” Draco stated. Harry kept conspicuously silent, though, just watching Draco intently, which was ridiculous of course: Harry was the one who got hurt. When Harry didn’t stop watching him, Draco felt obliged to elaborate though: “It’s just my back, but that’s probably because-.”
Harry smiled back at him and it made Draco feel warm. “Hey, do you want to have dinner together?” Harry proposed and it felt so normal, so right. It took Draco completely by surprise.
“So, is there anything else you’d like to know for now?” Francois had effortlessly reverted back to his professional tone of voice.
He was dressed to kill: a white shirt under formal robes in dark green ever so slightly threaded with silver at the hems and nicely fitted around the waist. Underneath he wore a waistcoat to match.
Harry just didn’t think that was it, though, the boy’s anger suggesting something else. It suggested he wasn’t just someone sent there by the Cartel to see whether Kendrick and Francois could actually be trusted: his anger seemed too real, too raw for that.
The three hit-wizards - or whatever they were – who were undoubtedly sent their way to kill them, saw it too, but shot curses anyway. They didn’t even come close to hitting Draco or Harry.
Draco usually flushed a bit when he won, being pleased, but not rubbing it in, like he probably would have done years earlier. Instead he just flushed and smiled genuinely in a way that Harry could easily have watched for hours.
Luna regarded him, smiling softly again. It felt like she was looking right through him. “Do you know what the dragonfly also stands for?” She didn’t wait for an answer. “It also indicates that someone should bring happiness to their life.” Here she stopped for a moment, eventually adding: “You
“Well, you did save us another trip here.” Harry smiled, trying to ease the tension around them a bit, because, although Harry really didn’t want to, he did understand what Malfoy was trying to say. And the worrying thing was: Malfoy might even be right. Just a little.
He had fallen asleep, his head lolling to the side a bit. He was still pale and Harry silently reprimanded himself. How could he not have noticed? Even Harry himself was tired and for Draco, having been wounded the way he was, that must have been worse.
Okay, Harry was going to make him spell it out, so Draco did: “Well, let’s see. You don’t want this. And I certainly don’t want to make you. So, we’ll just have to find another way to-.”
Draco ran his hand through his hair, pointedly not looking at Harry anymore, obviously upset. And Harry noted he didn’t just look tired anymore, he looked exhausted all of a sudden. “I-.”
Malfoy smiled back, a bit hesitantly, obviously still not quite sure how Harry had meant his remark: “Well yes, no need for it to be
So, Wednesday had dragged on for what felt like forever, but finally Draco’s long and tedious workday had ended and it was Wednesday evening, nearing seven.
“Okay, and erm-,” the next question was obviously going to be embarrassing, because the intern started blushing even more vehemently. “Well, what about erm-, sexual desire? It tends to peek the years prior to the transition, especially in males.”
And then the dreadful reality occurred to Harry: “So, I will have to come to all those events you go to?” He was proud to have swallowed the word ‘awful’ to accompany ‘events’ just in time.
That was not what he said to Harry, though. “I would have thought you’d love the gawking. I seem to remember being cornered by awestruck first years was your favourite pastime in our last year of Hogwarts.” It came out every bit as light, and condescending, in tone as Draco had intended it to.
Harry felt slightly baffled for a moment, then broke out into a smile he wasn’t able, or willing, to stop.
“He’s grown into his looks, don’t you think?” Of course Hermione had seen where Harry’d looked just now. There really was no point in denying it.
When he saw Draco sit down again, Potter relaxed a little. “Really, I won’t be very long,” he repeated. “Perhaps you’d like to look around the library?” There was a glint of amusement in Potter’s eyes and Draco wasn’t sure whether it was a serious suggestion or not.
It took Draco by surprise. Well, at least until he remembered what a sanctimonious do-gooder Potter usually was, which meant it didn’t really mean anything. Not really.
For one unsettling moment Draco’s brain just seemed to stop working. Then he saw Mathew Dean and Draco felt relief for the briefest of moments before realising something was profoundly off here.
Here Malfoy just stopped talking, and Harry kept looking. “So?” Harry eventually asked. “What is it?”
So Harry waited outside of Malfoy’s classroom until the second year students came piling out, chattering loudly about how - by the end of class - they’d all been able to break the rather challenging curse Malfoy’d apparently set them. Then, Harry went in.
The Slytherins obviously weren’t part of that, though: they were massively underrepresented at this wedding, as most of them, like Draco and Astoria, had fled the country, but, unlike Draco and Astoria, had had no wish of returning yet, not even for a wedding, the way they’d been treated after the war still not forgotten.
And then, after they’d cast spells at Harry for at least an hour, Harry finally opened his eyes again.
Dinner had left Draco full and pleasantly buzzed, because of the wine they’d been drinking. They were sitting on his sofa, close, almost as if they were actually in a relationship. Which Draco knew they weren’t. Of course he knew.
“We had a message from Ron and Hermione, when you’d already nodded off last night. They’re fine too,” Harry proceeded to say. He had been trying to find something comforting to talk about, but this had been the only thing he’d apparently been able to come up with.
So Draco got up from the floor, but, just like earlier that evening, he didn’t quite manage his usual fluent movements, bracing himself against the wall behind him, still swaying a bit on the spot when he’d finally managed to stand.
“You’re not happy about it?” Luna asked and it was a slightly surprised question, as if a dragonfly was the most desirable Patronus one could have.
“No, we don’t.” Harry had got up, standing next to Malfoy now and Harry supposed his smile was warmer than it had any business to be. He must still be really heavy-headed from sleep.
The first time it had thrown Draco off a bit. Of course he’d been aware Potter would be heading Auror Training - everybody in Training had known - but he just hadn’t thought of how to act when he would encounter the man. There’d never been any love lost between the two of them, to say the least: Draco had in fact been under the distinct impression that Potter hadn’t wanted to run into him at all.
“There you are. Finally.” Harry greeted Draco  “Well, I can now officially tell you that your kitchen actually works.”
A quarter past eight. Draco started to get a bit nervous. Harry wouldn’t have forgotten, would he? No, that couldn’t be it. He probably had an emergency at work or something else pressing. Draco cast a Stasis Charm on the food just to be safe and reprimanded himself: a quarter of an hour late wasn’t that much. Harry would come.
Harry decided not to let it distract him, though. “Drink this,” he repeated, holding the vial to Draco’s lips. And Draco did, swallowing with some difficulty, but drinking all the same. Harry smiled with pure relief.
“Harry, he isn’t worth it.” Draco had finally been able to get up, finding his voice in the process and he had put a steadying hand on Harry’s arm. It sent a tingling sensation through his whole body: touching Harry just always felt so right.
Malfoy shrugged. “Something simple.” He didn’t seem prone to explain any further, but Harry kept on looking at him questioningly, full Auror mode. “Oh, don’t give me that look.” Malfoy smiled a bit, obviously trying for a light tone. “Just a sandwich or something.”
And Terry knew it, falling conspicuously silent, before starting to leave and mumbling something that sounded a lot like: “Have fun with that fucking Death Eater of yours,” under his breath.
“Yes, most definitely.” Harry was quite certain Draco’s personal stock of ingredients was completely up to par. Draco had told Harry it had taken him much effort to complete his set of rare ingredients once he’d become a qualified master potioneer, the only people actually allowed to have such things on stock.
Suddenly Malfoy’s quick retreat after Harry’d mentioned his mother made much more sense. Malfoy must have known Harry hadn’t mentioned her just to taunt him though, because their interactions this week seemed to have been perfectly normal. Malfoy hadn’t seemed angry. For some reason that actually was a relief.
Harry watched Draco get up, too incredulous to say or do anything at first. Then he just managed:  “Draco, you heard what Corentin said. You should sleep.”
“But first send Blaise-, your Patronus. You know, Zabini:-, I think you’re actually-, actually acquainted with him,” Draco tried to quip, but Harry could also hear something else, something remarkably like hurt somehow. Draco really, really wasn’t okay, still he went on, saying: “We have to wait-, for Blaise. Fill him in. He’ll clean up. Side-Along me out. Afterwards.” Draco was talking in short breaths, constantly panting.
“At 12 Grimmauld Place. In the library. I’m still clearing rooms out, doing them up. That’s when I found this.”
Harry grinned at him. “It sounds like you’ve got some experience with that,” adding, because, well, technically Zabini was still Francois and Harry wasn’t to know who he really was: “Do you actually know Malfoy?”
an Auror. So Harry felt the need to explain: “I don’t remember who he said it was with and I thought it would be his mother, but-.”
Draco swallowed: “So you didn’t want the divorce?” He noticed how tight his voice sounded all of a sudden.
Right. Of course. This wasn’t about him, but about Hermione having to take time off. So, Draco quickly stuffed his hope back where it had come from and tried to look indifferent, cool.
“And you brought a friend,” the girl said next, seemingly having spotted Harry, who was standing in the doorway, only now. Then she saw the suitcase. “Are you going on holiday?”
Potter’s door had been open again and that meant Draco couldn’t knock, choosing to conspicuously clear his throat instead.
When the first fireball materialised in his palm, Draco wasn’t even surprised anymore, just intent on incapacitating the shield that Mathew had put up for the Dementors to be able to take Harry.
count yourself lucky to have someone like Draco on your team.” Hermione had annoyingly been calling Malfoy
When Harry woke up, he already felt the warmth of another body curled into his before he’d opened his eyes and there was a short moment when he thought it must be Ginny’s, just before he remembered it couldn’t be, that it wasn’t even close.
Draco frowned, thinking. “I think the statuettes are actually projecting wards of some kind, although not the ones we’d normally use. These seem to be darker.”
“Good, you’re here already.” His Covert Ops man had apparently arrived just outside the door of the office and stepped in, shrugging his outer robes off. “Please, sit down. Make yourself comfortable.”
Harry just started to apply Dittany. “So, does that happen a lot? Curses and stuff?” Harry tried to make it sound casual, but he didn’t think he succeeded.
That apparently was all the answer Blaise had been looking for. “Ah, ‘very good’ it is then.” He leant back in his chair. “How many times have you two met up?”
So Harry eased him down carefully. The bed was so soft and Draco felt so tired all of a sudden that he almost gave in, remembering he had promised to keep sitting only just in time.
Harry had made a simple, but absolutely delicious pasta bolognaise and for some time Draco just ate, grateful for the cooking and especially the company. Even now he’d spent his evenings with Harry on a rather regular basis, it still was really nice to be able to just sit down and eat after work and even better: not to have to do it alone.
As soon as Draco hit the bed, his eyes closed again, while he obviously let gravity take over, sprawling out with very little decorum.
It was unmistakably clear what Harry wanted him to do, but Draco very much preferred being asked, nicely. So for a moment he just sat there, not quite knowing how to respond.
By the looks of it, this particular house was not going to pose much of a problem, though. It had been taken months prior, which probably meant no one was actually hiding in it anymore and although there were bound to be some dark objects in a house like that, there was no evidence to indicate anything really menacing.
Back inside it was Luna who talked to Harry first. It was still crowded, hot and loud and Luna had to lean in close to make herself heard.
“I-. It’s my mother’s birthday today.” Harry could have known, of course - Malfoy had told him when he’d bought her a book a few days ago – but he hadn’t actually realised it was today.
In reality he plonked down on the curb instead, right next to Malfoy, who immediately stopped watching Harry in favour of the street in front of them.
“I do think your dragonfly Patronus is really fitting though,” Harry answered. There was a glint to his eyes and Draco should have heeded that. But he didn’t, expecting Harry to tell him something along the lines of what Luna had said about the dragonfly and what it symbolised.
Yes, of course. Harry had forgotten Malfoy was actually related to the woman whose portrait still managed to terrorise anyone she laid her eyes on.
“You didn’t have to. She saw.” Harry knew his voice sounded soft and Draco just watched him, his eyes unreadable. “She even wrote a letter to Robards about it,” Harry continued.
“Erm, no, of course not.” Harry didn’t really know what to think, though, whether to feel offended. Why had Hermione asked Luna to call in on him? True, besides Ron and Hermione, he didn’t really speak to an awful lot of people outside of the office, but there really wasn’t any need to. He spoke to the people he actually wanted to speak to and that was quite enough.
Draco’s decision whether to take on an internship as a Healer in France had been an easy one to make then.
It was the moment their waiter chose to come over to their table and ask them what they’d like to have for dinner.
Harry Potter - in one way or another and that just wasn’t what he was looking for. He wanted something better than that, something that was real.
When he eventually made it to his flat - so late it was completely dark even though it was late spring - it was to Blaise and take-away curry. “Has anyone ever told you, you work too much?” Blaise just said by way of a greeting.
Harry cooked, by hand and magic combined, sometimes talking and sometimes in silence. He seemed to be completely at ease in his kitchen and he didn’t seem to mind Draco just looking on.
And Draco didn’t know where it came from, but all of a sudden there it was, something someone had said when he’d been working on a tomb in Peru:
“How often?” Harry pressed. It all started to make sense - the curses, the no one apparently getting punished, the whole Floo thing - and Harry really didn’t like where it was going, not one bit.
Then Malfoy took his first sip, immediately scrunching up his nose, wincing: “Ehw, seriously. I suppose it’s a good thing I never get my espresso at the canteen. It’s-, it’s water really. I can only taste milk and sugar, nothing else. Yuk.” They had gotten their drinks at the Ministry canteen, but luckily they were well out of earshot by now.
Harry’s face must have shown some form of surprise, because Malfoy elaborated, slightly impatiently: “It’s rather late for an early shift. Even for the most famous Auror, I take it.”
Harry smiled, still not completely awake, his green eyes were so soft it almost hurt. “You know you didn’t have to,” he said, pulling Draco down towards him, “’M just really glad you’re here.”
“So, you live here now.” Harry’s gaze went past Draco, inside his flat. Draco knew what he’d be seeing, but when he registered the surprise on Harry’s face, mixed with something close enough to pity that he didn’t want to think about it, it still stung. A lot.
But no, he had wanted to become an Auror, so that’s what he’d become, like everybody had expected him to. He couldn’t say he didn’t like it, though. Most of the time it was okay, chasing criminals of all kinds, working out how particular crimes had been committed and eventually the satisfaction when things were rounded up.
There had been another burglary into an apothecary, in Edinburg this time, but the progress that had been made on the case was rather disappointing: namely none, whatsoever. The thieves seemed inconspicuous, like shadows, until they struck, usually making it out with their loot so fast that no one was actually able to identify them.
Harry found he couldn’t look away now, though. He wanted to reassure Draco, wanted to touch him, like he had yesterday, but he wasn’t sure how that would be received now.
Harry knew he’d been chopping vegetables with much more force than was actually warranted, but he hadn’t been able to help himself. “No, not really. I’ll just be very happy when I get to work with Ron again.”
“Draco!” Draco, still casting at the incoming guards, heard and shifted position, turning his broom swiftly, enough not to get hit, but not enough to get his broom completely out of harm’s way however: it splintered out of the air.
himself just in time. “Potter.” Then he strode towards the classroom he would be teaching in, hoping Potter wouldn’t pay him another surprise visit, just to see whether Draco wasn’t secretly using any curses on Muggle-born students.
So Draco led them to the dancefloor, elegant and sure, much like Harry had seen him do when he had danced with Astoria all those months ago. The music stopped and Harry heard the first notes of the tune he had wanted to dance to, the music he had asked the orchestra to play when he and Draco would get to the floor.
Harry unconsciously leaned in a bit and Zabini instantly leaned back ever so slightly, then continued. “When I mentioned Kendrick being a Death Eater someone let slip that he, you, well Kendrick,” Zabini almost smiled at Harry, because of all these confusing identities, just before he apparently thought it wouldn’t fit his professional demeanour and dropped it again, “that
Okay, so this was weird. Draco Malfoy was standing in his living room, taking it in annoyingly slowly. “This is a Black property, isn’t it? Great-Aunt Walburga lived here.”
So Draco went up to a brown haired man with a boyish smile that took his fancy. And found himself utterly and completely bored within minutes.
It hadn’t worked, though, and he had ended up at his usual club. Where he’d seen Potter. Which had meant the rest of the night had been completely inevitable and utterly, mind-blowingly good.
“We’re going to use the Floo now,” Harry warned. At least they wouldn’t Apparate, Draco thought fuzzily. He knew from experience that was a very bad idea, when he was this wasted: the mess he’d made when Astoria had Side-Alonged him when he’d been completely trashed all those years ago, still fresh enough in his mind.
After everything was over there seemed to be people around everywhere and all the time. Harry and Draco were made to give statements to Zabini and some Belgian bloke that Harry hadn’t actually seen before.
Harry just watched him for a moment. “So, you went to mainland Europe to escape scrutiny?” It was as much of a statement as it was a question. Malfoy nodded without looking at Harry, briskly walking to their Apparition point.
Harry was stopped short by the expression of unadulterated shock he saw on Blaise’s face. “It can’t have been his mother,” Blaise said, oddly serious all of a sudden. “Don’t you know? Draco’s mother has passed away. Both his parents have.” Blaise’s voice had gone very quiet. “Narcissa died four months ago. It even made
But all that was most definitely not why Harry was glad to meet up with Francois this evening. Harry was not a schoolboy anymore after all and Malfoy didn’t get under his skin like that. Not anymore.
So Draco got up, making it to the door just when Zacharias Smith happened to come in. Smith didn’t say anything, just glancing at him with a look of contempt that left very little to the imagination. Draco stood even straighter and looked down at him with practiced disdain.
“Not that often.” Now Harry couldn’t resist looking up at him. He didn’t quite believe what Draco had said and it must have shown. ”Not anymore.” Draco added quietly, averting his eyes.
Well, at least it wouldn’t be immediately obvious to everyone he was part Veela. That had to be a good thing.
Their room held single beds - even though they were currently pushed together - and Harry realised it would be easy to shove them apart. He found he really didn’t want to, though.
And as soon as they were in, a building materialised. It wasn’t particularly big and had a low thatched roof and walls that looked like they actually had to make an effort to keep standing. The building really wasn’t much to look at and Harry almost wondered why the Cartel had bothered putting wards and disillusionment on it at all.
“Mmm, I’m afraid that would just be an assumption,” Draco remarked, stretching back into his pillow lazily, registering how the look in Harry’s eyes got stuck between hungry and curious, while he impatiently reached for his wand to send the breakfast tray off to hover closer to the wall, out of their way.
He’d made an appointment to have some wizards come and install his new kitchen on a day that he was actually off work, but now they were Floo-calling him to reschedule. Damnit.
Again Harry turned around, silently conferring with Draco, deciding to go on whatever. They hadn’t come this far just to turn back again.
The office that they were lead to now was situated at the very end of a long hallway, as far from the Minister’s offices as one could get. It was small, just large enough to hold two desks shoved together and two chairs.
“Yes, of course I know. I’ve seen it. I would never have asked him to teach me the Patronus Charm, if I hadn’t known he could cast one himself.”
Potter would easily have been able to back out if he’d wanted to. Which he obviously didn’t, because next thing Draco knew their lips had met, apparently making one of Draco’s hands decide to fist Potter’s shirt, making the kiss that followed seem much more desperate than he would have wanted it to.
Malfoy and Terry, however, now seemed to agree on something for once. They were both watching Harry like he’d finally lost it.
He didn’t have to for long, though, because Potter got in a few minutes later. He was animatedly talking to a dark-haired witch that Draco didn’t know and Draco suddenly realised he’d forgotten. Potter had obviously forgotten they were meant to see each other here.
Harry saw that his words still didn’t seem to convince Malfoy, although he had apparently decided not to look a gift horse, or baguette in this case, in the mouth, because he sat down. “Well, the gesture is appreciated,” Malfoy said next, his eyes still holding confusion, but genuine warmth as well.
club. It was the very last place Harry would have expected him to be. When they’d still been at Hogwarts Malfoy had hated Muggles, with a passion, and he would not have considered spending time amongst them of his own free will, not ever. Still, that was exactly what Malfoy seemed to be doing just now.
He had probably been walking to his bedroom, but had stopped short when Harry came in, looking Harry over rather slowly. It left Harry, obviously still just wearing his pyjamas, feeling uncomfortably underdressed: Malfoy was wearing a particularly beautiful Muggle suit in a shade of blue that was reminiscent of the sky at night. And, of course, it fit him to perfection.
So Harry explained: “It would be nice to have someone here. You know, just for a while. It would help.” And in the dim of night Harry realised it was only partly true. He would like someone there. It
Harry was exceedingly glad that Draco had made him learn all their different uses by heart as part of the homework Harry’d had to do for his Glamour. And that he had actually put in the work. It definitely paid off now.
want him out, really,” Draco then answered, possibly even more quietly. “But my mother wants to try, wants to be able to take care of him, now he’s this ill. And I, well, I get
Harry shot Malfoy a puzzled glance that Malfoy apparently interpreted correctly, answering: “I rent a room here. Their eldest son has left, because he’s earned a full scholarship to Cambridge, and they’re renting out his room.”
The damned idiot had just up and left. Draco had left. He’d left The Leaky without even saying goodbye. Harry had seen him on the other end of the table, of course, because even though he’d been really glad to see Oliver again, he’d been watching Draco too, intent on talking to him later, trying to catch his eye. He hadn’t been able to though: Draco hadn’t even looked his way, had just been attentively listening and talking to Neville and Hermione. Which Harry had taken as a good sign.
Except he wasn’t. Not really. Not anymore. Harry sighed. He wanted to be angry at Draco, wanted to lash out - it would make it all so much easier - but he couldn’t. Whatever had happened on Friday, he was well aware it had had nothing to with Draco being the poncy twat he’d been in school: Draco wasn’t the spoilt boy who thought the whole world should be at his feet any longer. And Harry knew it.
“Harry-.” Draco said, once they had started walking to the room they’d apparently been assigned. Draco’s eyes were still open, but his breathing was even more shallow than before, his skin tone almost completely see-through now. “I er-. I can’t-, I know you don’t-.”
When they eventually made it to Blaise’s club that evening they were late, very late, which was quite clear, because - besides Ron and Hermione - even Luna and Neville had already arrived. Harry smiled at them and found he couldn’t even be bothered to feel guilty. He was just really happy to see them all. Here. With him and Draco.
The part of him that wanted to explain wasn’t the part that won out in the end, though, and Draco felt his face level out completely while he got up from the table, choking out a tight: “Thank you for dinner,” before Apparating on the spot.
And Draco had promised himself: no chickening out this time. There really was no reason to. This wasn’t any different from all the other times he’d pulled someone.
“If you’re going to wait for that thing, you’ll still be waiting by tomorrow. It’s usually stuck.” Malfoy’s posh accent seemed so out of place here it was shocking.
Harry had become a more and more permanent presence in his flat and it had felt so good, so natural, so much like he belonged there. But Draco also knew what Harry had told him when they’d started this, that he wanted to help Draco finish his flat, so he could settle in and feel at home. Nothing more.
It was then that Draco had learnt that Harry actually wasn’t completely off limits, because he was bi. And he had liked Draco. Or the things they did, anyway. And Draco had let himself have it: their easy, amicable thing, whatever it was.
“Hey,” Harry’s voice was soft, a tenderness there that even surprised himself. He put a hand on Draco’s leg, wanting to comfort him, but not really knowing what would be allowed. That made Draco’s gaze shift back to Harry, it was still too bright, but also somewhat stunned.
Draco wanted to quip that he was indeed in and would very much like to keep it that way, but he didn’t. It was Harry on his doorstep, after all.
Harry felt inclined to say something: Nott shouldn’t address Draco like this: Harry realised Nott posed a threat to Draco, and that just wouldn’t do.
Draco felt himself flush violently, thinking of how it must have looked, how his control had slipped and his feral Veela side had taken over without him having any say in the matter. He was lucky Harry probably hadn’t been able to see all of it in the position he’d been in.
That actually made Harry laugh. “Seriously? You can do potions. If you can get those right, I think cooking food shouldn’t be a problem. The recipes essentially work the same way actually.”
Malfoy had closed his eyes just for a moment and when he opened them again the pained look that had been there, had been replaced by something else, something that looked like resignation. “Well, if we’re going to do this, we might as well lie down.” His words could easily have been disdainful, but they weren’t, instead they held a softness that could only be there at night.
“Mr Malfoy is not in at the moment, but he asked me to let you in, when you arrived. You can help yourself to anything you’d like and order whatever you want from the menu, would you want to,” she started to explain, while letting him into what apparently was Malfoy’s room. “Mr Malfoy occupies a two-bedroom suite. I will show you where you can put your luggage.”
And then Harry said something even more surprising: “Let’s just see what happens. You know, I’m quite sure that if
They only let go of each other when they heard Harry’s Floo come to life, apparently remembering at roughly the same time why the Floo was roaring.
It was more than Draco could say for himself. He was still awful at losing, but Harry didn’t even seem to mind that very much.
Then Francois, well Draco, took Harry’s arm and Side-Alonged him just like that, without any kind of warning.
So, he’d left The Leaky shortly after, hoping that Draco would at least be at the club on Saturday, owling him to make sure he would be.
So he up and left, leaving Harry puzzled. Didn’t Draco remember last night? He’d been pretty sloshed after all, so perhaps he didn’t remember and was ashamed of having been that pissed. Or he might have remembered just fine, being ashamed of
There had only been one owl that had persistently tried to deliver pieces of parchment. And Draco knew, he knew they must be Potter’s, because who else would take the trouble, but he hadn’t even looked at them, had sent them all back unopened.
So next they went to the dance floor, elbowing their way through the crowd to get to a spot where they could actually keep standing. Draco noticed how Potter seemed to be just a bit unstable: the drink in front of him at the bar most probably not his first one. And he also realised that that probably was the only reason Potter had agreed to come with him just now.
It was a Time-Turner, slightly larger than the ones Draco had seen before and probably more powerful, able to take a person further back in time.
“Malfoy?” Potter sounded deeply surprised and Draco was quite sure his own face mirrored that sentiment exactly.
Because eating at the canteen also meant they wouldn’t be able to disappear into a dark corner the way they had at the Leaky. The canteen simply didn’t have any dark corners.
“It’s your turn to get the Hangover Potion,” Harry teased, without actually opening his eyes yet. Draco groaned. The monthly get-togethers with their friends - whoever was available joining them - were always soaked in alcohol, which invariably meant they needed Hangover Potion the morning after.
It was only then that Harry remembered Malfoy hadn’t been sleeping in his room anymore, that he’d apparently heard him in his own room across the hall and that he’d come here anyway.
Harry didn’t ask him anything, just gave him a look and got up, making them another round, handing Draco three toasties this time.
Draco decided not to tell Potter his weekend really hadn’t started yet, wouldn’t for a while to come, because there still was a heavily warded cabinet waiting for him in Curse-Breaking. So he just answered: “Yes, you too.”
Currently the witch and wizard that were left had stopped casting and for a moment Draco thought they would surrender, but then they started hitting them again, faster this time. Draco stuck to their tactic, holding his shield, only lowering when Harry started casting spells too.
And then they’d started playing. It had been a long time since Harry had seen chess pieces move. And that in itself was quite enticing: seeing pieces bring the game to life, slaying each other, but always knowing that was all it was, a game. No harm done.
“You must have missed it, though, being in the wizarding world,” Harry said, remembering Malfoy’s family and all that pure-blood crap he’d grown up with. Malfoy just gave him a long stare, something cold in his eyes all of a sudden that Harry really didn’t like, but that he didn’t know how to undo. So he just decided to ask what he’d wanted to anyway: “Is that why you started to work for Zabini?”
“What do you mean?” There was a tinge of hostility to Malfoy’s tone that hadn’t been there before. For a moment it sounded like he was going to say more, but he seemed to think the better of it.
Draco shrugged. “Nothing. It just seems like a rather tedious way to spend your Saturday off.” It came out extremely quiet and Draco realised he really didn’t want Harry to give up his Saturday like that. Harry’s job was demanding enough already: he shouldn’t be forced to be bored into oblivion waiting in Draco’s flat on his weekend off.
Kreacher didn’t comment on their state of rumpled undress, not even under his breath, just giving them a look that Draco couldn’t decipher.
Draco gave him a slightly confused look and Harry was sure this was the moment he would be made to leave.
come here for that, it probably wouldn’t be hard at all, given the way he looked right now, his fitted shirt open at the collar and his tight trousers not leaving anything much to the imagination. He looked undeniably good.
“Thanks, Hermione.” Harry got out of bed and quickly changed into his clothes while Hermione’s back was still turned. He really did feel a whole lot better.
Harry watched Malfoy as he stood on the dance floor of the club, his body easily moving to the beat with the same fluid grace that he used when walking, or sitting down, or anything else really. Malfoy’s eyes had been open at first, but as he had gradually let the music take over, they had closed.
When that had been done, Harry had hoped they’d be left alone for a while, but that had obviously been too much to ask, because instead they were hauled off to one of the smaller office spaces to see some Healers, both him and Draco on different sides of the room.
“Well, since you’re bearing-, not gifts as much, but erm- baguettes, I presumed that you’d-.” Malfoy - sounding as arrogant as ever, even though his sentence didn’t even run smoothly - didn’t finish what he was saying, but Harry understood well enough.
Harry didn’t move away from the bed, though and he thought Corentin would surely make him, but the Healer didn’t, instead just giving him a small, and still slightly puzzled smile. “I should probably just leave you to it,” Corentin proceeded to say, still eyeing Harry and Draco as if they were something quite special. Harry had seen that look often enough to recognise it anywhere. “Just let me know if there’s anything else I can do or if -, you know, anything changes.”
“I wasn’t thinking anything much, really,” Draco answered. Harry cocked his head a little as if he didn’t believe him, but he was smiling all the same. “Just that it was quite a delightful evening,” Draco decided to add.
have seen that I don’t agree,” Harry defended, knowing he meant it even more now than he had previously. “You’ve served your time. That should be enough.” Harry said it with utter conviction, making Malfoy’s face do something complicated that Harry didn’t really understand.
“No, but at least in Azkaban no one actually gets killed or tortured anymore,” Harry blurted. Azkaban may not be very nice, may leave any person marred, but the Manor would definitely have been a whole lot worse.
It had been confiscated a while back, but because it wasn’t a priority it hadn’t been cleared by Tracing Division yet, which was a prerequisite for other Ministry staff to come in and catalogue the house, however, because Tracing was the only division equipped well enough to clear a house like this one.
Like the first night Harry had seen him work, it was quite clear that Malfoy knew exactly what he was doing, mixing a drink while pouring another and talking to people easily at the same time, smiling at them as if they were the only people in the world.
He found himself leaning against Harry, his face buried in the nook of Harry’s neck. It was so familiar, so warm and inviting and he allowed himself to lean into it even more. Harry just let him, holding him up.
“Yes, I-. You don’t think I could-?” Draco stopped himself short as soon as he realised where his question was going, how vulnerable it would sound. How pathetic. He hadn’t been able to reign in his tone, though, his voice sounding much softer than he had wanted it to.
here,” Zabini said as he stepped into Draco’s room. Harry saw how Zabini’s posture had visibly relaxed a little when he’d seen the Healer. Corentin just shot him a quick glance, nodded in acknowledgement and went on casting.
When he got there he heard voices in the smaller living room and he headed there straight away, stopping in his tracks, suddenly careful, when he recognised the teary voice of someone who was unmistakably Ginny Weasley.
They took the stance they would start from and then Draco leant into Harry, his cologne strong and satisfying, and Harry thought Draco would whisper something encouraging, but he didn’t, instead just giving Harry a kiss on his jawline, fleeting, but warm and filled with promise and Harry knew it was exactly what he had needed.
Harry just nodded, although he felt slightly disappointed. He would have liked to know who he was working with, but he also knew that whoever it was, was putting himself in grave danger just talking to him at all.
Then a thought hit him. “So it could be really dangerous? To try and get these wards to yield?” As an Auror Harry had learnt to undo the more basic wards, but this was bound to be more complex: the sort of spell work an Auror would ask a curse breaker to come in and deal with.
Harry looked up at Zabini who didn’t say anything, but just cocked an eyebrow and smirked at him almost imperceptibly. Harry could readily guess what was coming.
“Please, stay,” he repeated warmly and he felt his smile grow into something that was probably much too soppy, but that he really couldn’t stop.
Harry didn’t take the dare and smiled. “I’ll have a better look at your bathroom later, you know, when you’re not in it and for now I’ll just cook us something and leave you to it.” He decidedly didn’t look down at Draco’s body anymore.
“Mhm,” Draco conceded, “but I think we’ve already established that I’m very much only partially Veela.”
Harry was leaning against the door frame, having learnt the hard way that it was particularly ill-advised to disturb Draco when he was brewing. Draco was standing over a potion, carefully counting while he was stirring.
The following morning it wasn’t Luna, but someone else that came to check in on Draco, which was only to be expected, because Luna could obviously not be on rotation all the time.
Zabini proceeded to put the bracelet securely around Harry’s wrist. “And I think you really should be careful.” Zabini’s dark eyes were completely serious, betraying real worry for the first time. “And please use the bracelets if necessary, because Draco-.”
Malfoy’s face did something that Harry wasn’t quite able to read, but that on anyone else would have looked suspiciously like hurt, before he checked himself, and answered, slightly loud, as if forcing himself to just say it: “Yes, I did, actually, but that’s nothing for you to worry about.”
Before he could actually say so, Nott had already answered, however, sneering: “Why? Because you work with Potter so well?”
Harry nodded. They would follow up on that, of course they would, but he wasn’t sure how he felt about it. It had been so long since he’d even heard Malfoy’s name: Harry’d testified on his trial and although Harry hadn’t really agreed with Malfoy’s sentence, that had been the end of it.
“And you’ve been to his flat?” Harry nodded again, still completely at a loss. “Well, doors to a flat don’t actually reach all the way to the floor.”
The chill Draco felt had now spread everywhere, enveloping him whole. He felt so cold he was actually shivering as the realisation hit him.
It was that Friday afternoon, when Harry walked out of the Ministry canteen after lunch, that he finally saw him for the first time in years.
“Potter. You’ve arrived.” It most definitely was his usual drawl, but his jawline clenched and his eyes closed briefly, then he looked up again, watching Harry. “I’m sorry I wasn’t here to welcome you, but I trust Madeleine has told you all you need to know.”
Then he looked over at Malfoy, who smiled at Harry’s undoubtedly slightly puzzled look. “I used to work here.”
And Draco didn’t pull back. Instead he put his hand in Harry’s neck, pulling him in, and it really just felt right, like they’d been heading for this for days. Harry gladly let him.
But that didn’t mean Harry had to like the git. And it certainly didn’t mean he would enjoy working with him.
So Blaise had kept Draco company well into the night today and now, after Blaise had left, Draco was sort of tired. He felt almost compelled to give up on going to the club entirely. But then, of course Draco couldn’t deny he was eager to know whether Potter would show up tonight, whether Blaise had been right.
He definitely wasn’t relieved, because he couldn’t bear the way Malfoy had been giving him the silent treatment all afternoon - and all evening, too - for that matter. Malfoy had hardly been in their shared space at all, not even to have dinner and for the brief period he
The relief Draco felt washing over him at that realisation was intense, much stronger than it had any right to be.
Draco turned towards him, smiling a little, still feeling so blissed-out that everything in the whole, wide world seemed all right for a moment. “Of course not. Just sleep,” he said, his voice warm with how good he felt. Then he manoeuvred his arm heavily over Harry’s waist, leaving it there.
When they let go again, Harry looked reassuringly dazed. “Fuck, I really need to go,” Harry reminded himself, “I don’t want to be late for class again.”
Draco smiled a little, then fell silent again for a while. “The answer is yes by the way,” he then said, completely out of the blue.
Draco smiled, knowing exactly why Potter was here, because Blaise was that kind of friend. “Then why don’t you?” Draco moved closer still, just shy of actually touching Potter’s ear with his lips, wanting to push him just a little bit further, see how far he could go. “Still don’t care to dance?”
Harry just looked at him for a while, the anger in his eyes visibly building. Then he exploded: “You think
So Harry decided to go back to his casefiles, but he found he couldn’t focus enough to read them, or at least not enough to actually understand anything that was in there.
Of course Harry hadn’t seen Malfoy for the rest of the week, but as soon as Friday lunchtime rolled around Harry found himself actively looking for him. Malfoy hadn’t come into Training early, like last week, though. And although Harry hadn’t really made up his mind as to what course to take yet, when he placed his order in the canteen, he found himself ordering two baguettes. To go.
“Why were you following us? What do you want?” Harry noticed he didn’t sound half as intimidating as would probably have been wise.
Draco wrapped Harry securely into his arms, shielding him from the fire all around them as much as possible.
When they reluctantly let go of each other again, Draco’s eyes were watching Harry’s intently, as if he was trying to peer straight into Harry’s soul. Harry gladly let him.
“Draco Malfoy, am I right?” Draco didn’t feel like nodding, so he just didn’t. People usually got his name right: his blonde hair just as much of a giveaway as the Weasley’s red. This particular Weasley didn’t ring a bell, though. He was ruggedly handsome, muscular and strong, but Draco couldn’t for the life of him put a first name to this man.
He also realized that was hardly an option, so Draco shrugged, dragging his eyes away from Harry’s to watch the lake instead. “Well, yes, I suppose we’ll probably cross paths one way or another.”
