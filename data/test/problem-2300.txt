“That’s what you get for working in the ministry, Malfoy.” Of course. I should have known the whole fucking time. Weasley. “How dare you attack another witch like that! You’re a coward!”, I shouted, while gripping the handle of my broom tightly, so that my knuckles turned white. My whole body tensed up again. Meanwhile, I had managed to sit on top of my broom again. But I could feel, that I was tired. Too tired to fight him again. Catching a deep breath, I replied shakily: “I know that you have a problem with me, Weasley. But I can’t change that. So, leave us alone. And don’t you dare bring Harry or Hermione into this. They’re my friends – my family.” With that, I turned around to Harry and he nodded. No more words were spoken, as we were leaving Ron and finally making our way to Sirius’ residence.
“Good morning to you both." Another person walked up to the table and looked at the two friends who had already sat down. Maybe a bit too aggressively the young man put down his teacup and concentrated on the person, who had just entered the room. “Potter….” “You should stop calling me that, darling.” Draco’s corners of his mouth wandered upwards and revealed a huge smile which made Harry’s day every time he saw it on the face of his boyfriend. “You’re up early. What kept you awake that long last night?”, Harry inquired, while taking a seat at the table.
Suddenly, a big whoosh introduced the arrival of a new person. They were standing in the middle of the two fronts, facing neither of them. It looked almost like they wanted to play referee. Their black cloak was wet at the bottom and indicated, that the person had been walking through mud beforehand. They straightened up and focused themselves on the sky above them. With one rushed hand motion, they drew their wand, pointed it towards the clearing up sky, and whispered, loud enough for us to hear: “Morsmordre!” A chill ran through my body, as I heard the word being spoken aloud. It hadn’t been saying for a couple of years now. But here it was again. That person must be Snape then.
After I had hung my coat on the black coat stand, I took a seat at the desk and started up my laptop. “I made you some tea, love.” Harry must have made the tea in the little kitchen niche, which was laying behind his desk. Fortunately, we had one of those fancy tea cookers – with the Slytherin crest on it – of course. He put the black teacup next to the laptop and I started to smile, as I perceived the smell of Earl Grey tea. “You’re the best, Harry. Thank you so much.” “You looked quite fierce down in the lobby. When you were talking to Ron.” I raised my eyebrows and answered exhaustedly: “Weasley just couldn’t stop himself. He needs to keep his nose out of other people’s business.” Harry nodded and sat down behind his desks. As I started my laptop, the snake on the Slytherin crest twirled and then froze. The crest blinked in shimmery gold and then my desktop appeared. We continued working until the lunch break came around.
I opened my eyes again and slowly pulled away from Harry. “Who that might be?”, I asked no one specific. As I turned around the scent of Harry’s cologne was still hanging in the air. “Hey, guys. I thought, that I would come and pick you up for lunch. But I didn’t want to interrupt. I’m sorry.” It was Hermione, who had opened the door by herself. She was standing in the doorway. I smirked and approached her, followed by Harry. Thus, the trio made its way to the cafeteria.
As soon as his lungs stop screaming, Harry unclenches his fists and reaches out for his daddy who eagerly envelops him in his arms and pulls him into his lap.
He wakes up feeling completely rested, the soft green light of the dorm window spilling in through a gap in the hangings around his four-poster bed, splashing over his face and breaking through the fleshy darkness of his eyelids… and Draco’s arms still loosely hugging him from behind.
Harry frowns at seeing the dead snake nailed to it.
Remus nods in agreement.
”And why does he have to care what his father thinks anyway?” Harry grumbles.
”What was that for?” Draco exclaims in exasperation. ”We need fire — or embers — or it won’t work!”
”Oh, it’ll be fine”, Hagrid says and waves a dismissive hand. ”I got this book outta the library see… Dragon-Breeding for Pleasure and Profit… It’s a bit outta date, but it’s all in here, look… I just have ter keep the egg in the fire, ’cause the mothers breathe on the eggs you see, and once it’s hatched —”
”You’re not seriously thinking of going?” Draco says haughtily after Hagrid has shuffled out of the library again.
Harry is sure Professor Snape isn’t buying it, but at least they’re not giving him an outright excuse to march down the aisle and dole out detentions to each and every one of them. Which is something, Harry figures. With his stomach churning and head pounding, the last thing he needs is to be scrubbing cauldrons all night…
Riddle nods silently, his bright eyes glittering in the dim light and never wavering from Harry’s face, making him feel oddly exposed — like when Snape’s eyes had bored into him and he’d felt sure the man could read his thoughts…
What Harry had initially read as excitement in his friend’s face, he now realises it’s closer to distress than anything and if the cool dungeon air outside the Common Room wasn’t enough to wake him up then this realisation does the trick.
— let the — troll in —?” Harry gasps incredulously.
”Yes, Sir…” Harry mumbles sullenly.
”Draco, I spent the day with my parents”, Harry says. ”You knew I was going to —”
”, Draco repeats incredulously. ”Harry! Pay attention!”
”Wh-who?”
”Look…” he says. ”I have somewhere to be…”
”I see…” Dumbledore says again, nodding seriously. ”I am so sorry, my boy…”
”You said it”, Draco mutters, surprising Harry — and evidently himself as well, because he seems to startle and then quickly shoots Harry a worried look, as though expecting Harry to mock him for dropping his aloof exterior — but Harry simply laughs, and Draco relaxes again, his lips twitching.
”Oh, I wouldn’t be so sure of that, my dear…”
what his daddy is afraid of,
”Voldemort knew about… about me and Draco”, Harry says slowly, swallowing round the lump in his throat. ”He was asking Lucius about it, mocking him… Lucius kept saying it’s not true and… Draco knows where the Malfoy family’s loyalty lies…”
Pansy, Blaise, Theo and Daphne all frown and turn around in their seats, while Harry straightens up even more and follows their line of sight, but he can’t see anything out of the ordinary. The Gryffindors are looking a bit glum, but that’s to be expected after yesterday’s loss —
”He didn’t”, Harry says. ”Granger did.”
”What’d you do to Bulstrode?” Daphne asks idly as he plops back down in the seat between her and Draco again, allowing the ingredients to spill out of his arms and onto the desk. ”She’s glaring daggers at you.”
The blonde’s eyes flicker over to meet Harry’s, but he might as well have them screwed shut for all the connection Harry feels with him; there is not a trace of emotion inside the steel grey eyes, and Harry feels his chest tighten as he stares into them.
”Death Eaters?” Harry repeats fearfully.
to explain this to your dad.”
”Then why’d you
”Don’ yeh worry about it, we’ll be fine”, Hagrid says and waves his hand again. ”I’ll let yeh know when it’s hatching, so yeh can come and see —”
”You really think Dumbledore is going to offer him a job?”
this is
”What?” Draco says blankly, stumbling after him onto the staircase. ”What do you—?”
They squeeze together on a small settee crammed into the narrow space between the window, the table and a rather massive weeping fig, getting each other up to speed with everything that’s happened over the hols. Draco tells Harry all about the three weeks he spent in France with his mother at the start of the summer, and Harry tells Draco about the mail thieving house elf that appeared in his room.
”Staff table”, Draco grunts.
Harry stumbles slightly as she pushes him into a broom cupboard before squeezing in next to him, her bulging bossom level with his face and making him feel hot and clammy. He squirms away from her as much as physically possible in the cramped space, but not wanting to appear rude he gives her a pinched smile.
”It’s okay”, he says. ”I’ll take my Invisibility Cloak and sneak through the trapdoor and I’ll grab the stone before he can get his hands on it and keep it safe until tomorrow when Dumbledore gets back.”
” he yelps. ”No, no, no, no — Look at me, look at me!”
Harry nods in agreement and lets Draco pull him along once more. They make a beeline for the fireplace this time and Draco grabs a drink from a houseelf’s tray and gives it to Harry.
Harry watches them converse in hushed tones for a moment, before returning his attention to Remus who is still perching on the edge of his seat and fidgeting sligthtly with the frayed cuffs of his robes.
Blinking tears from his eyes, Harry sits up from his sprawled position on the floor and looks around in confusion. Snape’s office comes back into focus and he realises he must have banged his knee on the desk and fallen to the floor. He struggles to his feet again, feeling disoriented and slightly out of breath.
. It’s all of our lives. We need to get you back to your family and b- erm, and
”These were the only ones in my size —”
”Wh— ” Harry just shakes his head, feeling at a complete loss.
”Oh, really, Professor McGonagall?” Umbridge says, her tone now rather chilly. ”And your authority for that statement is…?”
”Don’t be stupid”, Draco says firmly and shoves his face against Harry’s cheek, kissing his jaw.
”Yeah…” Harry mumbles.
She stops dead right next to the statue behind which Harry is hiding and desperately holds his breath, hoping to stay hidden and not have to deal with her. But Trelawny’s hasn’t spotted him, she is frowning down at the card in her hand like it has somehow insulted her.
”Can you hear anything?” Ron says after a while.
”Sh-sh-shit”, he gasps. ”Are you o-okay?”
! And then she sent you that fucking note!”
Harry frowns in confusion.
Pansy is still standing there, glaring back at him with her hands on her hips.
”What about the trophy room — that’s always unlocked.”
to hear…
Professor Snape seems to be thinking along the same lines, because he says nothing at first. He just warily watches as Sirius moves back into the kitchen without a word and when he returns a moment later with five glasses hovering in the air in front of him, all containing a generous amount of amber liquid, he inclines his head towards Remus and murmurs a
”I wonder who’ll be teaching us?” they hear Granger ask a few feet away.
”I don’t… I don’t get it…”
”And all for nothing”, Pansy says with a put upon sigh, making a show out of turning her head towards Harry with a sad pout. ”That’s the real waste, isn’t it…”
The woman’s voice can be heard again, closer to the house now, as she lets out a gasp, ”Is that a dead snake nailed to the door?”
Sitting down with a heavy sigh, Snape glares at the words carved into the back of Harry’s hand.
Eventually, he settles down on the floor of the Astronomy Tower and lets his gaze rest unseeingly on the blanket of stars above him, allowing his mind to wander; snippets of images keep prodding at his awareness, like an annoying little light blinking at the corner of his eye. He shakes his head to clear it and refocuses on the night sky.
”What?” he snaps.
Harry shushes him sternly, ”You’re scaring the First Years…”
”Oh, what — you don’t think I could win this?” Harry huffs.
”What?” Harry mumbles, as much confused about what the blonde has said as he is at the sudden space between them.
He doesn’t appear to notice Harry or the still sobbing Wormtail at all at first, taking a long moment to acquaint himself with his new body, his long spindly fingers fluttering with delight over his arms and chest, before brushing over his bald head and down his hollow cheeks. But then his scarlet eyes flit over to Harry briefly, as if making sure he’s got an audience, before stalking over to Wormtail and bending down to hiss in his face.
Professor Snape comes striding down the aisle between the Ravenclaw and Slytherin table and stops behind Harry and Draco, who both twists around in their seats to look up at him.
Harry looks up with a soft gasp, barely daring to hope… Sirius grins at him, and Remus gives him a pinched smile as well when Harry turns to him, but there was no mistaking the stern glance he gave his husband just before and Harry realises his daddy didn’t like the idea of Harry breaking a school rule at all, but that his dad must have somehow convinced him to get the broom for him anyway.
”Don’t be silly, you have nothing to be sorry about”, Hary says firmly, hugging the other boy closer still.
”I’m too old for arranged play dates, daddy!” Harry snaps.
”Yes, Sir”, Diggory says immediately. ”We were just heading inside—”
He tries to focus on what Ms Jones is telling him once the witch resumes their conversation, but suddenly Harry couldn’t care less about quidditch tactics. His gaze keeps darting back to the doorway, expecting Draco to return. But he never does.
He feels slightly exposed standing on his own suddenly, naked as the day he was born and much colder than any boy would want to be in a situation he hopes will turn sexual…
For a moment he becomes blurred as Harry’s eyes well up with the tears he wouldn’t allow himself to show his dad for fear of not being taken seriously. Ironically enough, he knows his daddy will always take him seriously, and now for the first time in his life he really doesn’t want him to.
The rain is falling heavier now, but he can still hear the bludger when it whooshes by… He flies higher and higher, looping and swooping, spiralling and zigzagging, rolling, feeling dizzier but also more alive than ever before… A whistling in his ear tells him that the bludger has just missed him again and he quickly speeds in the opposite direction…
he thinks.
After they’ve finished breakfast, Remus walks Harry to the dungeons and gives him a big hug before returning to his own quarters.
In the end, he decides he rather sit in Arthur Weasley’s office and read the latest issue of
”Yes, you do. Stop saying ’hello’ and he’ll stop stalking you.”
”Harry, mate… Do you mind if we ask you a question, though?” the other twin says. ”How can you be friends with that git?”
”Go talk to Draco”, she says in an unnecessarily loud and slow voice and Harry feels his cheeks flush, keenly aware that the whole Common Room can hear her. ”Spare the rest of us from any more cold shouldering, it’s very tedious—”
Harry more or less spits the name out.
, he tells himself.
Harry hangs back and makes sure to take a seat at the back of the classroom. His friends look between him and the front, clearly torn. He slams his book bag down on the desk and stares back at them all stubbornly. They exchange subtle looks, but join him without a word.
”I offered to help”, Seamus shoots back with a teasing grin. ”You said you wanted to figure it out yourse—”
, Albus?” McGonagall says.
”Yeah…”
”Hello, Hagrid”, he mutters, as politely as he can manage under the circumstances.
”GO AWAY!” The blonde shrieks.
There is an awkward bumping of umbrellas as everyone gets up to make their way down from the stands and back to the castle again. Harry remains seated for a moment, waiting for the others to go ahead, not wanting to accidentally take someone’s eye out…
parents?”
”What was it, the monster?”
He fumbles with his wand and holds it out in front of him.
”It’ll be alright, you’ll see”, Remus says as though he’d been able to read Harry’s mind. ”Now, finish up your breakfast so you can go finish packing… We need to leave in twenty minutes.”
Parkinson huffs, but there is a twitch of a smirk on her face. Zabini’s teasing grin softens and he leans in to murmur something quietly in the girl’s ear and nods, sending him a grateful look when he leans back again. It’s the softest Harry has ever seen her look, in this world and his own. Zabini leans in again and gives her a quick kiss on the cheek.
”Bring them in”, Crouch says in an oddly hollow voice.
Draco favours him with a grin similar to the one Pansy had on her face as she lead a very bewildered Granger to the dance floor.
”You too.”
”As I was saying”,  Dumbledore continues, turning back to face the students. ”We are to have the honour of hosting a very exciting event over the coming months, an event which has not been held for over a century. It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.”
He gasps for breath and feels hands on him, grabbing him and pulling him up to sitting, wiping his sweaty hair from his face, just as a dawning sense of dread begins to fill him;
Harry groans and behind him, Draco groans as well. Hagrid seems to shake himself out of his memories and looks between the two of them, quite horrified with himself.
”I won’t tell anyone”, Harry adds. ”How are you going to do it?”
, he quickly corrects himself —
”Happy Christmas!” he exclaims.
A girly giggle echoes around them suddenly and they both freeze.
”I mean, sure they hate us — and Harry in particular”, Seamus mutters. ”And Draco’s probably not their favourite person since… You know… But
Scratching out an
”Be quiet”, Snape snaps coldly. ”I was not asking for information, I was merely commenting on Professor Lupin’s…”
”P-p-p-please Remus, S-S-Sirius,
” Lucius says slowly.
”He’s going to be alright, though”, Sirius cuts in. ”They found him just in time and took him to St Mungo’s—”
”Stop! Stop!” Lockhart screams.
”I need to find Snape”, Harry continues, as tears well up in his eyes and tumble down his cheeks. ”But he’s not here and there’s no-one in the Potions classroom!
”Oh, er… I dunno, coconut mostly”, Harry mumbles distractedly, leaning over his potions book for a closer at the instructions until he’s suddenly pulled to the side. ”Wha-
”Harry?”
”You think it was cursed”, Pansy says and it’s more of a statement than a question, but Blaise nods anyway. ”If Gaunt was really Riddle’s grandfather it’s entirely plausible that he had the ring in his possession at some point, it’s also possible that he cursed it… But Dumbledore isn’t stupid. Even if he got a hold of the ring, why would he—?”
Draco leads him up to the castle and continues to pull on his arm insistently, all the way up to the fifth floor and every time Harry tries to ask him where they’re going — about once every floor — he just shoots him a secretive smirk and just shakes his head.
”Thought it’d be the perfect bluff”, Sirius continues. ”Voldemort was sure to come after me — No-one would suspect James and Lily to trust one so pathetic and insignificant as you with their safety,
coming back here on a different day — I do have a life, you know!”
With a bang, the office door flies open and Madam Pomfrey comes storming out.
”Oh, he did
I thought long and hard about this. Obviously there was no way Remus would let Dumbledore steal Harry away to visit Slughorn… so initially I was going to keep Snape as Potions Master and either have Dumbledore bring in Tonks to teach DADA or force him to do it himself.
”You have the required number of five already, even without History of Magic”, Professor Snape says and without waiting for Harry to actually tell him he’s okay with just five, he spells the timetable for him and hands it over.
Eyeing the shower stalls now however, Harry doubts whether they’ll be able to help him listen to the egg. Instead he makes his way over to the bathtub in the corner and begins to fill it up. He’s always thought this tub was quite large, but looking at it now Harry wonders if he’ll be able to contort himself enough to submerge himself in the water and still fit the wide open egg under there with him…
He stretches out languidly, peering around him blearily just as Madam Pomfrey comes bustling in through the gap in the curtain.
”Harry, go join Remus on the sofa for a sec…” Sirius says, squeezing past him and walking out into the hall.
not know?”
The blonde shrugs quickly and starts to add clockwise stirs to his own stirring and immediately his potion begins to pale as well.
”Think they’ll attack us if we try and cross the room?” Ron whispers without taking his eyes of the swarm of birds overhead.
”Oh, don’t I know it…” Sirius says, clamping a hand on Harry’s shoulder and giving him a small shake.
”HELP HIM!”
”Please stop”, Harry mutters and grimaces. ”And he’s
”That’s what Dumbldore sa—”
When the blonde finally sits back, once again revealing both boys’ bulging crotches, and leers down at the smaller boy and reaching for his belt, Harry gives the drawing another hurried tap with his wand and fumbles with the picture frame in his hurry to hide it in his bedside drawer along with all the other Christmas gifts non-suitable for dads.
”He’s very… erm… sensitive? Isn’t he?” Hermione says politely and Ron lets out a loud snort.
It’s not necessarily fair, but it’s right.
Harry blinks his eyes open and peers up at his daddy.
They continue to sink further and further below ground, until the darkness of the earth has enveloped the small box completely.
Draco only hums non-committally. Harry gives him a sidelong look. The blonde’s eyes are guarded and he’s got his lower lip sucked into his mouth, which is a sure sign that he’s worried and Harry realises that, despite the confidence he expressed earlier that he could easily get Professor Moody sacked with just one owl, he’s actually dreading their first lesson with ex-Auror.
”I LOVED HER!” he bellows back, some colour now returning to his pale cheeks. ”I tried to
”Harry?” Sirius voice shakes him out of his thoughts and he blinks to see all three wizards gazing at him curiously. ”You all right?”
In the next moment, another boy appears, looking identical to the first one. Harry blinks, then smiles gratefully as they both grab a hold of the trunk and lugs it into an empty compartment for him.
But when he reaches the door, he hesitates. What if, once he’s walked out this door, Professor Snape will go back to ignoring his existence? This is his chance to talk to him and try and set things right.
A second later, the doors slam open and Remus and Sirius storm inside the Hospital Wing, followed by Professor Snape who keeps a safe distance from both of them but his eyes on Remus in particular, Harry is surprised to notice.
”And signal for help”, Snape adds. ”Okay, then… Good luck, Harry.”
He fumbles to get Draco’s pyjama bottoms down as well, but with Draco basically still sitting, his bent legs shoved under Harry’s sprawled thighs, they just bunch at his waist. So instead Harry simply pushes his hand inside them and then, bending his arm at an awkward angle, he begins to pump the other boy’s cock, eagerly matching the rhythm of Draco’s own movements until he feels the other boy’s body curl up even tighter around him, trembling with tension.
”I don’t think daddy exactly pays people for their stories”, Loony says dreamily. ”They do it because it’s an honour and to see their names in print…”
”Is it Hagrid?”
He wheels around and sees Snape stride up to him and vanishing the snake with a simple flick of his wand, before turning to the crowd and bellowing, ”Duelling Club is over, everyone back to their dormitories! Now! —
Sirius sighs and pushes away from the doorframe, padding across the floor and sinking down heavily into the other end of the sofa. He’s still avoiding Harry’s eyes — but at least he’s not so far away, and at least he’s not shouting, Harry thinks hopefully.
Harry straightens up again and turns to face him.
”I ate quickly—”
"Harry? What —?"
Harry swallows again and takes a deep breath to steel himself. He can feel tears prickle in the corner of his eyes but he wills them away angrily. He can’t allow himself to break down, not now. He needs to do this and he needs his dad to take him seriously. Because the one thing that Harry is the most scared of in this moment, is that his dad will start laughing like he’d done in the memory, or that he’ll dismiss Harry’s feelings about it.
cushion”, Harry says, pointing his wand at the cushion wedged between Blaise’s hip and the armrest and it flies forward, whacking Theodore in the back of the head before soaring into Harry’s outstretched hand.
”No matter”, Ms Skeeter simpers, turning to smile at her photographer. ”I think we got the most important part, didn’t we?”
”Sorry”, he mutters. ”I didn’t think…”
… Because when something has been mended one too many times and is beyond fixing anymore, he will get rid of it and buy a replacement.
He pulls away again and Harry almost topples over, trying to prolong the kiss.
Snape leads the way to his office at the end of the corridor and taps the lock with his wand before holding the door open for Harry who steps inside. The walls are lined with shelves, some of them filled with peeling old textbooks but most are stacked with jars and boxes of ingredients. Snape’s personal potions supplies, Harry guesses.
When they finally make their way to
”Good”, Snape says shortly. ”So what
As it turns out, it’s a very close match. Draco is very quick and with only the one hoop he should be able to save the Quaffle from going through it every time, but halfway through the match Seamus discovers his weakness… If he throws the Quaffle as hard as he can and aims it
Harry’s heart pounds pridely in his chest and he glances at Draco quickly, sharing s small smile with him before focusing on the Potions Master once more. The man’s black eyes lock with his for a split second before darting away to glare over at the Gryffindors on the other side of the classroom instead, but Harry swears he saw flicker of a smirk on the man’s face.
”A thing?” Remus frowns.
” Harry repeats teasingly. ”No, you didn’t wake me… I was hoping you’d come and, you know…”
”Yeah, right…” Harry mumbles, sitting up a little straighter.
”Yeah, what else?” Harry huffs.
All throughout dinner Draco is back to his earlier, silent self again, like the scene in the Charms corridor never happened at all, and when the two of them make their way to Umbridge’s office just before seven, Harry shoots him a couple of sidelong looks but Draco keeps his eyes firmly fixed on the floor in front of him, his mouth set in a thin line.
”You too”, Harry says and tries to sound like he means it. ”Thank you for having me, and for inviting me to come to the World Cup—”
With varying degrees of difficulty, the four of them clamber out of the portrait hole and make their way back across the castle towards the dungeons.
”Yeah”, Harry says dully. ”All thanks to that Skeeter woman…”
”Good evening, Professor…” Harry says, smiling politely. ”I’ve just come to check on my potion, if that’s okay?”
”I bet you are”, Seamus shouts from his own bed and a chorus of snickers erupts around the dorm.
(See the end of the chapter for
”No”, Harry shakes his head. ”But I have a pretty good idea of what I’ll be…”
”Yeah, I know, but still…”
”Harry, we’ve been over this—”
”So, we meet on this evening to continue the tale of Tom Riddle”, Dumbledore says in a booming voice that seems much too loud in the hush of the office. ”Whom we left last lesson, if you remember, poised on the threshold of his years at Hogwarts…”
he sighs, and heads inside.
When Harry and Draco enter the Common Room their friends flock around them, babbling excitedly. Pansy and Daphne begin to speak over each other excitedly about having just returned from Hogsmeade when Professor Snape came striding past them, and more or less ran up the front steps and into the castle — ”Clutching a piece of paper!” Seamus cuts it rather loudly — and ever since the two girls got to the Common Room and told everyone about it, the wild theories about what could possibly have got their Head of House acting so panicked, have been flying apparently.
”Professor”, he says. ”Sorry to w-wake you—”
Suddenly, something happens that has never happened before… A student puts up their hand. Professor Binns, glancing up in the middle of a deadly dull lecture on the International Warlock Convention of 1289 stutters to a stop and blinks in amazement, as if he’s just now noticed that there are actual students in the room in front of him.
”Yes, Harry”, Remus says slowly. ”I think they’re really good.
”Knew what?” Sirius says with a frown.
Pansy gasps and slaps her hand against her mouth dramatically, but her wide eyes glitter with excitement.
… so slowly, in fact, that by the time he’s finished, there’s only ten more minutes left of the lesson.
”Hippogriff shit”, Harry mumbles under his breath.
Professor Snape immediately bends down and roughly pats the body down, until he finds Moody’s hip-flask in one of his robes pockets. He flicks the top open and sniffs the contents with a scowl.
”Draco? I’m really not drunk—”
”What?” Harry demands.
Remus’s eyes become suddenly misty and Harry feels a stab in his chest, because for the first time since he woke up in the Hospital Wing, he recognises his daddy…
Harry and Draco exchange a startled look. Harry thinks Draco must be thinking the same as him: that Professor Snape must be furious indeed to be speaking like this to a fellow teacher, in front of students no less, even if the teacher is Lockhart.
Harry huffs out a chuckle, and gives the boy a wry smile. If it wasn’t for the eager glint in the boy’s eyes, Harry might have thought he was just as arrogant as he pretends to be…
He stares out into empty space for several long moments as he tries to wrap his mind around this idea. But no matter how he twists it and turns it around in his head, the idea just doesn’t make any sort of sense. Until it suddenly occurs to him that maybe Malfoy wrote the letters —
”Yeah, two rolls”, Harry says and shakes his head. ”I haven’t even started mine yet, it’s going to take me all night…”
A sudden knock ont he door interrupts him and with a last worried look at Harry’s face he turns to face the door, calling out ”Come in!”
Harry spends most of his time hanging out with Seamus and Blaise, but Theodore has taken to join them more and more as Crabbe and Goyle’s maturity level and vocabulary seems to regress rather than the opposite. He’s also on friendly terms with the rest of the quidditch team, except for Flint who still seems to think Harry got himself banned from quidditch on purpose… And every so often he runs into the Weasley twins and catches up with them, but he hasn’t seen much of Ron since term started. The twins tell him their brother is in mourning over his rat Scabbers who apparently lost its life under very dramatic circumstances… Harry wouldn’t laugh at a story like this normally, but the way the twins recap what happened is just hilarious and by the end of it, Harry is clutching his side and wiping tears from his eyes.
Harry suddenly finds himself with his arms full of Draco and the end of his sentence stifled by a forceful kiss. He eagerly returns it, grabbing a hold of the other boy and pulling him down with him as he leans back on the sofa. Draco eagerly follows the movement and spreads out on top of him, completely smothering Harry’s body with his own and running his hands greedily over any part that he can still reach.
”Bowtruckles!” Granger informs them all, her hand still thrust desperately in the air. ”They’re tree guardians, usually they live in wand trees!”
Just as they’re about to leave for the Burrow, a couple of Hogwarts owls arrive with Harry’s and Draco’s Hogwarts letters clutched in their beaks. Remus grabs the letters roughly from them and flicks them hastily through the doorway before shutting and locking the door with swift movements.
“Says the man who got his cock out.”

“You sound off.”
“What?” Harry briefly looks back over his shoulder but Malfoy has disappeared into the nook.
“You’re an idiot, Harry.” The affection and fondness laced through those words felt as if Malfoy had meant something else.
Clearly he had taken leave of all his other senses.
then it was only for the quickest of moments before they seemed to get over it once they’d spotted his camera. Bellies sharply sucked in, hair fluffed up as they posed for him, smiled demurely at him. Winked at him. Squeezed his arm a bit too long before he moved away on to the next crowd.
It’s a lie, DMLE is essentially one big grid but Esther looks grateful as she steps out and nods at Draco to follow her. Neither of them look back at Mr April, who is clearly in the midst of having a strop.
“Hm, and trouble. You should stay away if you know what’s good for you.”
Harry faltered, his smile disappearing; he looked worried and guilty in equal measure and Draco tried not to overthink that either. “It was that day in Puddifoot’s,” Harry said, chewing a little on his lower lip. He released it and sighed quietly. “Or...just after. I said—right before Michael showed up—I told you I had to go and sort something out, do you remember that?” Draco nodded. Of course he remembered. It was shit. Stupid Michael. “Good. And then I messaged you—well,
[16:18] I’m sorry, your hair...?
[19:32] ‘Tried’ to be really nice about it
Maybe that’s just what his face looks like
Feeling confident and smug, Draco raised an eyebrow, his mouth curving up into a smile as if to say
[10:18] But someone has taken my book out :-/
And I told him he’s a horrible kisser
It’s Potter’s voice, speaking Draco’s thoughts, sounding far away but so familiar in his head as a cloying stench fills his nostrils.
The soft, amused sound beside him was unmistakable as Draco was dragged inside.
“So could you.”
“Introspection?”
[11:01] I don’t think I do
His eyes follow Potter’s following the wine glass and then he’s looking back at Draco. “That I look
Just heading back now
Draco had pulled his lower lip between his teeth and Potter had definitely seen him do that.
[08:33] You’re infuriating
“You’re sure?” Harry doesn’t know why he asks it, what he really means by it until Malfoy answers him.
Harry discovers them in the early hours of the morning, his chest flush against Draco’s back, arm curled protectively around Draco’s lithe torso. They’re so faint Harry almost misses them, creeping up into the blond hair at the nape of his neck. Harry nuzzles into them, smiling against Draco’s skin as he lets out a contented little sigh and falls back asleep.
[16:24] I’m sorry that I made you think that
[13:30] I think you and I are a bit beyond the pleasantries seeing as you asked if liked being peed on last week
Harry watches his friend search the cafeteria, as if this imaginary not-a-Potter-fan will pop up out of the ground from Ron’s sheer force of will. This enables Harry to get another good look at Malfoy, sitting alone, eating a peach and turning the page of his book. How he’s able to eat it so perfectly Harry doesn’t know, and feels his brows knit together with irritation as he watches Malfoy take another delicate bite. Harry’s peach was too ripe, too sweet, the juice dripping messily down his chin before he gave up and handed it over to Ron.
You’re better than this
With a flourish of his hand, he wandlessly vanishes Malfoy’s trousers and underwear.
The other thing was this: Potter had definitely been watching him.
“You didn’t look at yours.” It isn’t a question.
[20:19] Yeah okay
be thinking about him.
I’m sure he doesn’t think you’re a weird creepy sex pest
He nodded and smiled up at her before she turned and left.
[19:24] Well not at all now you’ve let me off the hook ;-)
[10:38] ‘tis a pity they’ll never know then really
“Are you really arguing with me? About yawning?”
Exactly
“H-how you getting on Malfoy?” Harry takes a tentative step towards the nook.
[14:07] I believe it went well
“...yes, you’re ridiculous.”
“Thanks, Malfoy.” Potter started adjusting the cuffs, as if his little outfit wasn’t tailored within an inch to fit him like a dream. Potter gestured at the camera. “Who’s on your hit list tonight?”

But the more Benefits and Galas and Banquets and Charity Balls there were that brought them together, the less absurd Draco thought it was until he finally figured it out: Draco was simply Potter’s escape from the near-constant demand for his attention.
[12:13] Why is that a personal favourite?
It got easier to distract himself when Luna came back and sat with them properly. It gave him something to focus on as he tried to keep up with what she was saying (which felt a bit like watching an episode of The West Wing set in Middle Earth) instead of the lack of Potter’s hand on his leg (which was shit).

[22:05] Welcome back :-)
“Christ, don’t ask me that…”
What about the peace garden?
“I don’t fucking know.” Harry didn’t look up as they walked, thinking it was much more sensible to concentrate on the simple act of putting one foot in front of the other.
Draco stared back at Harry.
[13:37] Oh my god
[13:06] Have no fear! The remainder of the golden trio are rather predictably scurrying our after you
coming to see if he was
[00:41] So?
It was just a job, and he had a list of people he needed to make sure he photographed - but there were three names on that list that left him feeling faintly sick. Of course the golden trio were gracious about it, but the shot was awful - too posed, too stiff, too resigned. The one he actually submitted for the editorial was a candid he got much later, much more Draco’s style. The three of them laughing, in their own little world, oblivious to his presence.
Harry tugged him forward, causing a tiny but nonetheless undignified noise to escape from the back of Draco’s throat.
Malfoy’s presentation is brilliant, of course. He’s confident and charming, explains the future developments in the Auror Training Programme like he’s spearheading the entire thing by himself. He even manages to demonstrate a reconstruction of the shielding session from that morning using some truly impressive charmwork that has Harry sat on the edge of his seat. And he was
I saw you whisper something in his ear after you helped him up
Harry’s gaze drops to Malfoy’s hands when there’s a shift beside him, the pressure between their pressed-together arms increasing ever so slightly. Harry doesn’t know why he looks down, but he can see that Malfoy has the cuff of his loaned jumper held between thumb and forefinger and is sort of mindlessly caressing the fabric between his fingertips. It’s oddly fascinating to watch. Malfoy only lets go when his name is called, straightening the cuffs as if he’s wearing a shirt which Harry thinks is sort of funny.
“He doesn’t even like them,” mutters Sebastian.
Maybe
And then...well then he was leaning in and taking a small bite of Draco’s crêpe, eyelids fluttering closed, releasing a contented little ‘mm’ sound that Draco found he rather liked.
Draco abruptly stops when he sees that Potter’s mouth is threatening to pull into a grin, his eyes crinkling at the edges, amused at Draco’s flustered state.
Don’t pretend you don’t like them
[14:03] 5. Tell me
“...alright. Are you sure?”
“I’m so fucking sure about you, Harry.”
Draco huffed. “Is this why you suggested I get a hot chocolate earlier? So I would be forced to speak to him?”
Harry groans and sinks his face back into his hands. The song. He glares at his friends through splayed fingers and sighs. Ron is singing fragmented parts of the song and making up parts he can’t remember as he serenades Hermione, who is red-faced and trying to catch a breath between fits of giggles. It hadn’t been that bad, Harry thought, although he should have known something was up when the guy had turned up to the restaurant carrying a lute.
[08:26] How the fuck did you do this?
“What do you mean?” He asks.
[21:30]
“Fuck off.” Potter laughs properly then, leaning forward and reaching for Draco’s pen. “When was that?”
[Call disconnected]
“Happy to be of service.”
“How tragic for you,
“-sake, don’t want him to pass out.”

[19:52] Because I’m asking you

[20:24] He became a bit dismissive when I mentioned Saturday night/Sunday morning
It’s not even been an hour when he can hear the familiar tap-tap-tap of an owl at the studio window. Draco let’s it in and unties the missive, raising an eyebrow as the bird doesn’t move, waiting for a response.
“Whatever you’re going to say.” Harry doesn’t even look at them. “Please do not.”
[16:56] What?
“Malfoy.”
It’s probably meant to have come out like a joke, but Malfoy’s voice has come out in that rumbly-soft way again and Harry isn’t laughing, just moving closer to him. They’re close enough that if Harry takes one more step forward or Malfoy takes one back, there won’t be any space between them at all and it’s taking every ounce of self-control for Harry not to just

“Fu-uuuck Harry.
He sort of hated himself then; he wanted to just jump, he wanted it so badly he could practically feel it singing through his veins.

“...just can't help myself when it comes to you.”

“A personal reason?”

He only hesitated for a second, but that was all she needed. Luna’s eyes narrowed immediately. Draco couldn’t stop himself from shooting a worried glance at Potter, who had sat back to watch their interaction. And he was still smiling, the gorgeous wanker.
Hope the parking has improved at SP, just on my way now.

“Hmph.”
Draco made a gesture that said it wasn’t a big deal and smiled, but he knew his heart wasn’t in it. Potter scrubbed a hand through the back of his hair, messing it up a bit. It suited him more, Draco decided, he looked more like himself. Chaotic and messy and beautiful.

His phone buzzed in his pocket as he reached for the door.

and suggested him as a photographer (Luna. It’s definitely, definitely Luna). And while he’s at it he can also blame Ivy, his assistant, for being so proficient at setting up that Draco has no choice but to help sort out the ‘models’ – chat to them, get them to loosen up a bit and take this for what it’s supposed to be: a laugh, a silly afternoon,
He was about to put his phone away when his thumb, apparently acting completely of its own accord, hovered over the text messaging icon and opened up his inbox. Several names appeared in the list before him, with one shining out like a beacon at the very top alongside a time-stamp from the last message sent last night. He pressed on it and scrolled through, hating himself a bit for giving in so easily as he read and read and read.

“27 minutes.”
“Yep.”
Ivy poses a theory a few days later as she chooses photos for her exhibition. Draco is sitting next to her in an attempt to offer critical feedback, but the reality of the situation is that he’s actually just muttering into an overpriced takeaway coffee about the oddness of the Potter situation.
And Moody.
[20:27] Suspiciously quickly
As you can see it’s pretty fucking calamitous and sadly I was unable to learn how to use a brush. I’m not very clever. I don't know what all the fuss is about me really. I’m not even that good looking. Anyway, the hairbrush was obviously not an option. Oh I’ve tried magic of course but I’ve started to suspect that this...’thing’ on my head has become sentient. I certainly wouldn’t want to piss it off with an ill-prepared for hex so we’ve just learnt to live with each other.
Is this something to do with that lad from Griffin that you fancy?
[00:08] I’m talking to you
He didn’t want to look at Potter, suddenly afraid of what he might see there, but he’d made himself do it anyway. Draco was surprised that Potter wasn’t laughing at all; in fact, his normally idiotic face was doing something rather complicated, flitting in equal measure between discomfort and anger. At what exactly, Draco didn’t know or care to know, and he raced back to the Slytherin common room as he felt his eyes prickle with heat and humiliation.
[20:32] I’m sorry too
Harry faces an obstacle. Some things are discussed. Draco takes revenge.
“Keep going,” Malfoy whispers, curling a leg around Harry’s waist and urging him on. Harry leans down and kisses him again, nips at Malfoy’s lip.
Professor Snape goes over the timetable with them and then spends five minutes outlining all the measures that have been taken to prevent students from cheating and tells them if any student of Slytherin is caught trying to cheat despite this, they will have him to contend with.
”Mister Malfoy?” Umbridge prompts.
”Never accept a Dare from Pansy”, Daphne murmurs to the Gryffindors as an aside.
”Can I have a seat and put some murtlap on my cut, please? Before you start hollering in my face—?”
”I was just wondering, Professor, whether you received my note telling you of the date and time of your inspec—?”
Inside the bedroom, he grabs the old alarm clock from the nightstand and drags the rickety desk chair over to the window. He puts the clock on the window sill and then sits down to wait, staring between the street and the clock, trying not to count the seconds or his own heartbeats.
but remains silent. Her eyes flicker over to Draco briefly, and the blonde apparently takes it to mean they’re dismissed, because he grabs Harry’s sleeve and pulls gently, before leading the way out of the tent.
Harry lets out a small surprised huff and smiles, feeling a sliver of hope when the other man returns it tenfold, even as the other three professors return to his bedside and he can help but to notice that, although Dumbledore is still smiling and twinkling away as always, the other two are looking particularly grim.
”There you are… We were about to send out a search party”, he comments lightly. ”Did you have a good time?”
, than play nice with the rest of the Weasley clan. He’d have quite a good time playing Gobstones with them the other day, but it’s not the same as hanging out with his own friends… it’s not as relaxing, because he’s on his guard the whole time. He can’t help it. Being surrounded by gryffindors, especially ones he haven’t quite got figured out — as cool as they are — it is emotionally draining to interact with them for longer periods of time. Especially a whole group of them.
They keep to the shadows and jog as quietly as they can, pausing at every corner to listen for any sign of Filch or Peeves the Poltergeist before they continue further up in the castle. Finally they reach the trophy room, which is indeed unlocked as Draco had said and definitely big enough to fly several feet above the floor. Harry lets Draco go first and sits down crossed-legged in the middle of the room and watches him as he zips between the walls and rounding the dusty old chandelier, his dressing-gown flapping around him.
”What is it?” the spider Aragog says.
”How much do you want to bet she’s got giggling hearts floating all over the place?” Harry adds with a grin.
They walk to the dorm to grab their toilet bags and then head for the boys’ bathroom. As they’re brushing their teeth, Seamus asks Harry if he really thinks You-Know-Who is coming back.
"He... He disappeared", Remus says, avoiding Harry's eyes.
”I doubt anyone will ask though”, he says and starts jotting down Seamus’s name on top of the list. ”They all think I’m weird for even saying hello to the Gryffindors, so…”
”Well, there you have it”, Lockhart says shakily and heaves himself up on the stage again, staggering slightly before regaining his confident stance. ”That was a Disarming Charm —”
”I didn’t say anything”, Harry grumbles again —
Harry startles and whips his head around to meet the Professor’s gaze. He feels his face flush slightly when he realises that he’s still clutching the man’s arm as though his life depends on it, and quickly lets go and takes a step back.
Harry’s stomach growls softly in protest.
this isn’t his Sirius…
Their conversation is halted altogether however, when an owl taps on the window. It’s not an owl that Harry recognises. It’s got at least two different letters clamped securely in its beak.
”And who to kill first”, Pansy adds, fluttering her lashes sweetly.
The troll tries to swat Harry away, but Harry manages to hold on. He draws his wand, but before he’s hand a chance to try a spell, the troll starts thrashing around wildly and the wand lodges itself in one if its’ huge nostrils. The troll roars in anger, or pain, Harry isn’t sure.
”You’ll have to kill me”, the man whispers.
”What’s wrong with
”Your daddy thought you might appreciate it if we spared you the embarassment this year”, Sirius explains with a grin.
For once, Harry is the one shifting his food around on the plate while Draco is shuffling vegetables into his mouth at record speed and chewing almost mechanically.
”Because of the prophecy”, Harry says, feeling his heart hammering away in some kind of anticipation.
”He’s seen it all”, then-presumably-George interjects.
He knows Lucius always wanted Draco to attend Durmstrang, but that Narcissa had put her foot down and insisted he attend Hogwarts instead, because she wanted him closer to home… but what if the witch has now changed her mind? What if she plans to make the move to France permanent, to get Draco out of harm’s way now that Voldemort is returned?
”I guess”, Harry shrugs again. ”But… I figured we’d keep it between us—”
He’d been so worried about the Malfoys’s reaction when he gave the interview that he completely forgot about the other Death Eaters he’d named.
Remus pulls him back into his chest and hugs him tightly. Harry burrows his face in his chest and continues to sob, all of the tension and adrenaline finally surging out of him. Remus lifts him up and cradles him to his chest, rubbing his back soothingly.
Harry mouths.
Harry turns around and stares up at the ancient statue of Salazar Slytherin. The massive stone mouth opens, wider and wider, revealing a huge dark hole… As soon as Harry senses movement in the darkness, he squeezes his eyes shut —
Harry backs away faster, feeling along the wall for a corner or a doorway, and to his immense relief, there is a door left ajar. He manages to slip inside just as Snape reaches him and the man walks past none the wiser.
Harry melts into his daddy’s embrace, feeling more exhausted than he’s ever felt before in his life… not surprising, considering he’s barely had a wink of undisturbed sleep since his last night at Hogwarts and that was three nights ago now. He remembers the effect of the Dreamless Sleep potion that Professor Snape got him and wishes he had some of it left, so he could get at least a few hours rest without having to relive everything that happened in the graveyard.

”Hello, Colin”, Harry answers automatically without tearing his gaze away from Draco.

”Fine”, he mutters. ”I’m not very good at chess. I never really learned. Ron’s tried to teach me, but… He’s too good.”
”A Parselmouth”, Draco whispers breathlessly.

”It’s true”, Draco murmurs quietly.
”Orange”, Snape growls. ”Really, Longbottom? Orange! Tell me, boy, does anything penetrate that thick skull of yours? Didn’t you hear me say, quite clearly, that only

Harry feels a winge of desperation from being in the cross hairs of that relentless gaze.

He honestly wasn’t sure if he was trying to deny his feelings altogether, or admonishing himself for unfairly feeling them at all in the face of what he’d done.

Potter stepped closer and this time pointed at the door. “Sorry, do you mind? It’s just – I’m meeting someone and –”

“Is that supposed to mean something to me? Just admit you’re shit at cleaning charms.”
So if Harry found himself looking forward to those training sessions that Malfoy came along to, or found excuses to visit Malfoy in his laboratory, or just so happened to have lunch at the same time as Malfoy, then that was Harry’s business.
Potter’s face softens, he blinks a few times, smiles up at Draco from his pillow-nest. Must be all the potions he’s on, Draco thinks; pain relief, blood replenishers. And knowing Potter, probably some kind of relaxant to stop him wandering off. He wouldn’t be looking at Draco like

”Ah, yes… You can speak parseltongue, Harry — because Lord Voldemort, who is the last known descendant of Salazar Slytherin, can speak parseltongue. If I am not mistaken, Lord Voldemort transferred some of his powers into you the night he gave you that scar. Not intentionally, of course…”
Pansy lets out a huff of a sigh and shakes her head, then leans forward over the table to pin Harry with a sincere look.
Harry gives her a noncommittal shrug, trying really hard not to get his own hopes up.
”I daresay we’ll probably see each other again soon”, Diggory adds and gives Harry another wink. ”Give my love to Draco!”
”Last lesson of the day”, Draco answers for her.

It’s the only way.”
”Well, figure it out!” Snape snarls. ”We’re trying again! Now, get ready!
Harry starts packing his trunk as soon as he gets back to the dorm, instead of leaving it to the last minute like he usually does. Something about going through the motions of packing up everything, it just makes him feel like the moment when he gets to leave is getting closer, like he can actually speed up time somehow just by reminding himself that he’ll be leaving soon…
”No”, she murmurs, squinting suspiciously at Harry. ”It’s a ruse. He’s having us on.”
”I kind of wish I had brothers and sisters”, Harry admits. ”I’m an only child — er — or maybe you knew that already?”
”Okay, what did you mean to imply then?” Harry mutters.
”Don’t tell me you had a fight already”, Parkinson says in a long-suffering voice.
Harry frowns and swirls around, following the gazes of his daddy and boyfriend to see two dark specks against the sky, growing larger and larger.
Harry frowns. That’s the second time his dad has said
”Merlin, you get worse every year…” Remus mumbles with a fond look at Sirius who merely shrugs carelessly and then beams at Harry.
Two fourteen-year-olds kissing the air out of each other’s lungs hungrily, blood boiling in their veins and hearts hammering happily… only a year ago, and yet they’d been
Then Harry remembers. Bellatrix Lestrange and her husband were sentenced to Azkaban for torturing a couple called Longbottom.
”I will be his dearest, closest supporter… closer than a
All the residual pain evaporates from Harry’s body suddenly and his mind is wiped of all thought, which is almost a greater relief… he feels light, like he might soar away at any moment… he’s flying, even with his feet firmly planted on the ground, he’s flying… dreaming…
”Are you awake?”
”No?”
”Yes.”
”Yeah, but… Look, I know he’s your favourite teacher, and that he favours you —”
”What do you think?” Bagman asks, still beaming at Harry. ”Come on, let’s have a closer look!”
Harry listens carefully. Apart from the gentle drip of water, he can hear something as well… A soft rustling like wings, and a clinking sound…
”Yeah, you’re right”, Harry says lightly. ”I don’t. I just have a thing for y—”
”What?” Harry says nonplussed.
”What’re yeh doin’ here?” Hagrid says uncomfortably, throwing a worried glance toward the corner where Harry and Draco is hiding. ”Get outta my house!”
, Harry thinks tiredly, as he totters off the last step.
Harry stares in paralysing panic as Voldemort raises a wand and whispers,

”So were my dads”, Harry cuts in.
He doesn’t remember the other Harry actually telling him anything in the dream; but somehow he must have got the message across, because Harry
He and Harry hurry out of the office, then wave goodbye to Mr Weasley who hurries along the corridor and disappears out of sight. What’s so urgent about a regurgitating toilet, Harry doesn’t understand. Mr Weasley
Harry looked one last time at his uncle, then his aunt and cousin and finally Draco.
- You should go.
He could see how much their terror affected Harry. Harry, the defender of the innocent, Potter. Draco always hated this about his old schoolmate, how concerned he was with everyone's well being. Sometimes, so those you care most about may survive, you had to sacrifice others. That was how it worked in this world, and after all these years, after he'd lost so many of his friends, he still didn't learn the lesson. He supposed it wasn't entirely Harry's fault. After all, he grew up on Dumbledore's watch. That old, naive, too kind for his own good and good for nothing wizard. Draco pitied Harry. Compassion was the last thing Lucius and Narcissa taught their son. And that allowed them to live a little longer than James and Lily Potter had, at least.
- What do you want from us, boy? Vernon Dursley shouted, holding Petunia's skinny arm in his big hand to prevent her from leaving the safety of their corner. What do you want? Why did you come back?
- Probably." Malfoy admitted under his breath.
- He's with me, Harry reassured them. We've come to take you somewhere safe.
Dobby explained that everything that had happened to Harry this last month was his doing. Harry swore he could have strangled the elf. They heard Malfoy calling for Harry after a moment. Dobby was startled and vanished, before Harry could even ask him why he had done all those things.
"... to the nursery. Potter and Malfoy are there, so we'll have to be quiet."
- How kind, Draco said sarcastically. How very generous of you, Potter. As if I had any choice but to stick with you.
"Potter, I think there's somebody in the room with us."
He switched position a couple of times, not knowing how to make himself comfortable because of his arm. He was exhausted, but sleep would not come. He heard Malfoy coughed.
- You'd already played before ?
Harry nodded to the elf, got up from his bed and walked with Dobby to the nursery's door. He passed Malfoy's bed, and was close enough to see his terrified face. Malfoy stared at Harry in confusion.
A noise came from upstairs. Draco watched Harry running to the first floor and sighed at his recklessness. He took out his wand by instinct before remembering he couldn't use it and ran after Harry.
- I can't believe you're scared of it. I thought you were happy the monster was set loosed in the castle.
Harry heard it again. He could hear Malfoy gasp and hold back sobs, as well. Then, he saw it. He saw his ears. As big as Harry's arms. His round sad eyes and his scarred and long fingers. Finally, he felt the weight of the little elf when he got onto the bed, making the mattress creak again.
Harry was looking at him the same way he did when they first met. A mix of confusion and anger on his face. It made Draco sad to think about it. He knew it was last time they would ever see each other.
- Are you done?
Magic was beautiful. It could be terrible, too.
The boy was the first one to notice Draco's presence. Something about Dudley reminded him of Goyle. Though Dudley was no less than three heads taller than Goyle had been the last time Draco saw him, before he'd heard how he'd been killed during the battle at Hogwarts.
- Yeah, I saw that."
- You'll die, Harry said desperately, visibly not knowing what to do but to state the obvious.
"They're coming !" Harry told him, running back to bed. Malfoy soon imitated him, not bothering to ask who were "they".
- Don't call me that. We're not there yet.
Draco, he thought.
Both of their speed breathing could be heard over the sound of now close footsteps approaching the hospital wing. The door burst opened and four people came in. Harry almost screamed. He would have bet Malfoy did, too. But they did not seem to care about the two of them. They put Colin's petrified body on a bed next to Malfoy's. Colin's petrified body, Harry realised. He heard the words "Chamber of Secrets" and "open again" very distinctly and it sent a shiver through his whole body. McGonagall, Dumbledore and another woman Harry could not recognise, though he guessed she was the nurse, all left the room hurridly, leaving Malfoy and him alone with Colin.
- I know, Draco cut him off. I was on their side not long ago, hopefully they won't know I'm a turncloak.
Back in his bed, the covers covering him from toes to neck, he thought of Dobby. Dobby didn't want Malfoy to see him. Why ?
- No..." Malfoy whispered miserably.
"You don't reckon it's the monster, do you ? The thing in the Chamber.
- Why would I see better than you ?
"It's just like the cat." Malfoy only said.
"What was that ?"
But the four of them were dead now. Gone. And Harry and Draco were left alone with only the other for company. And with Hogwarts destroyed and Black's old house taken from the Order by Bellatrix and her minions, the Order had to separate. In the chaos, Ron Weasley had disappeared with his family, Hermione Granger with them, but Harry had stayed behind to make sure nobody was hurt. Not for the first time, he saved Draco's life, with the help of Tonks, who Bellatrix killed right after they'd put him out of danger. It was a strange feeling, somebody sacrificing their life for him. He never really liked Tonks. But she had died so he could live.
- Harry...
- Because we saw what you people could do with our own eyes! Dudley shouted, his voice so alike his father now. I'd rather die here in my home than being used as toys by those monsters in the streets, like they did with the Harlans. One of them tortured mr. Harlan all night. We heard him. And his wife. She was screaming for them to stop. They were just trying to run away!
- What ?
- Do you hear it ? Listen !"
Aunt Petunia, Harry had called her. Her long blond hair were all over the place, giving her the look of a deranged person. Draco thought she looked as if ready to throw herself at anyone who would dare approach too closely. But once she was certain it was really Harry before her, she made herself as tall as she could, as if to prove something. Her husband didn't even try. He and the so called Dudley were terrified of Harry. It seemed that, family or not, he was first and foremost a wizard. And a dangerous one at that.
A war seemed to have taken place in his head. It was quite a surprise to see Harry Potter hesitate to go and save somebody that needed his help. Draco stayed speechless.
Harry woke up in the streets, in the middle of screaming muggles and wizards trying to protect them with spells. He heard someone called his name.
"Go back to sleep, Malfoy.
"What are we gonna do ?" Malfoy asked out of the blue. Or maybe it was to break the tension, Harry did not know.
"Harry !"
He tried not to sound to kind and failed. It was too late to pretend he didn't care anymore. And he was tired. So tired.
Harry looked beaten, sad even, when he left the room and went back to Draco's side.
Draco itched to hit the boy in the face. But he was always helpless in fights so he did nothing. How many times had he heard his father scream as he was being tortured, too? How many times he and his mother screamed for them to stop? Even before Draco helped Harry escape. He was fuming just to think about it.
- Who is this?
A question Draco expected.
"Dobby can't be seen by Mr Malfoy. Not here.
- Maybe it doesn't know how to tell apart pure bloods from mudbloods !
"I need to get some rest. My arm is growing bones.
- Dudley? It's me. It's Harry. Open the door.
- Yeah. Why do you ask me that ?
- Of course not. I don't know who it is. I don't. He added when Harry didn't seem convinced.
Harry got up and joined Malfoy. He wanted to see Colin. When he did, he swallowed back a gasp. He took Colin's hand in his and it felt like holding a rock. He shivered at the touch. After a moment, he turned to Malfoy.
- Uncle Vernon! Aunt Petunia! Dudley!
"You tell anyone and I'll make sure you can't speak anymore. I know some powerful spells, you know."
- He's in there? Draco asked.
He turned to Harry and pointed his wand to his face as he say the words.
The noise the bombs were making it hard for Draco to hear every word. He looked around him and watched as another muggle was leaving his home with a bag as big as himself. He tried to run and failed. Much like Harry, the muggle seemed to hesitate. He finally left the bag behind and ran. Draco wished Harry could have this much sense.
Harry woke up with a start, the inside of his mouth dry and his arm hurting so much he had to bite his lip so he did not scream out loud. He would have cried if the tiredness hadn't taken all the energy left in him already. Instead, he fell back onto the mattress loudly, his weight making it creak. It was only when he heard Malfoy moan in his sleep that he remembered he was in the room with him. He stared into the darkness at what seemed to be Malfoy's sleepy form on his own bed and hoped the noises he made earlier would not wake up the other boy. The moan became a heavy sigh and Harry could hear Malfoy move. Harry was certain he was awake. He tried to stay still and not make any more noise. After a couple of minutes, Harry thought he was safe to breathe normally and move again. Malfoy had gone back to sleep. He sat down on the bed, feeling sick because of the pain in his arm. He had been told bones growth was painful but he did not except it to hurt this much. He hated Lockhart more than anything in this moment.
- Come with me, Harry said after a long moment of silence. Please.
Harry listened hard and did hear something. He thought he even saw something near his bed, and his heart started to beat hard in his chest.
- I have to make sure..., Harry started before stopping himself.
"Open the door ! I don't have my wand on me !"
Harry smirked and Malfoy held his wand up.
He seemed more upset than happy that his nephew came back for them. He was starting to make Draco angry. They were risking their skin for these ungrateful fools.
Harry was not really scared. But he still bit his lip so he didn't laugh at the other boy's face.
- You can go if you want, Harry offered him, having made his decision. I won't try and convince you to come with me.
But Harry did not have time to listen to Malfoy. He pushed him inside and closed the door behind him, worrying Malfoy in the process.
- Yeah, you won. No need to remind me.
- Here or there, Petunia said, what's the difference?
- Not before I made sure the mug... your family are safe.
- My uncle and aunt live down the road.
The Ministry, all of Voldemort's followers and the dark lord himself knew of Draco's betrayal. When they followed his trace and found him, he had no hope to escape unscathed. He would die the moment he was finished with the Dursleys. Despite the fear of dying, and having to face enemies, Draco felt at peace at the thought that he would leave this world sacrificing his life for muggles. A last offense to the dark lord who took everything for him. His very last act as a wizard. As a human being. As Draco Malfoy. That was how he would be remembered. Harry Potter would make sure of that, he knew.
- And you're not ?
Malfoy was threatening to cry, Harry judged by his trembling voice. Dobby, he almost answered, before the elf put a finger on Harry's mouth, pleading with his eyes not to tell anything. Harry looked at Dobby with a furrowed brow, confused.
"You said the monster couldn't tell apart the pure bloods from the others. Are you sure about that ?
The sight before them was a truly pitiful one. Draco saw a man and a woman shivering in a corner, and their son, towering over them two, gasping at the intruders as if he was seeing Voldemort himself. Draco could have laughed if he wasn't so tired. Instead, he let Harry reassure his family and stayed in the corridor.
”I think we should go this way”, Harry says and jerks his head towards Hagrid’s hut instead. ”I think we should fly next to the edge of the forest, there’s no way we’d be seen with the trees behind us.”
”Can we Apparate? Please?”
”No”, Harry groans.
”I mean that…”
” he chokes out. ”YES! IT WORKED!
”Okay, fine. If you have to…”
”Yeah. Still. I wish we could have hung out more.”
Mr Weasley, who seems to have tried his best to ignore them up until this point, turns around in his seat and returns Lucius’s stare firmly, his ears flaring red as the blonde man sneers. Harry and Draco take their seats in the row behind the Weasleys, book-ended by Lucius and Narcissa, and for one brief moment it looks as though they’re out of the woods… But apparently Lucius can’t resist one final dig, because he sweeps his gaze along the first row then comments in mock surprise: ”Good Lord, Arthur. What did you have to sell to get these tickets? Surely your house wouldn’t have fetched this much?”
”Welcome to Divination”, the Professor continues and sinks into a large winged armchair in front of the fireplace. ”My name is Professor Trewlawny. You might not have seen me before. You see, I find that descending too often into the hustle and bustle of the main school
Crumpling the roll of parchment in his clenched fist, Harry slams the door to the Defence classroom and stomps down the corridor, half hoping to shake the anger off but the harder he stomps, the angrier he gets. By the time he reaches the spiral staircase leading to the dungeons, he’s fuming.
”It would be impossible to tell in this picture”, Remus interrupts. ”Even if you had a close-up of the rat, you’d never be able to tell in a photograph! Now, stop it — you’re scaring Harry!”
Harry shakes his head. The boy gives him a pinched smile and takes the seat.
”He wouldn’t have to anyway”, the other twin interjects. ”Didn’t you hear? We’re not playing Slytherin tomorrow, they switched with Hufflepuff… Apparently their Seeker is still recovering from his arm injury!” he rolls his eyes and then gives Harry another wink.
”So, what”, he says. ”I should just let her spread lies and—?”
”I’ll write you a note, in case you run in to Filch or Filius on your way back to the dungeons”, Remus says and starts looking through the mess on his desk for a spare bit of parchment.
”You believe me, don’t you?”
”What?” he gasps, thrashing around, trying to get the hundreds of bugs off him. ”What are you talking about?
This time, there is a murmur amongst the people again and Karkaroff, like Harry, realises that he’s managed to surprise them and the relief makes his entire body sag inside the confines of the chains.
”You’re going to another Order meeting today?” Harry asks carefully.
that he hadn’t known, because although his face remains as impassive as ever, there is a glint of surprise in his eyes. After a moment, he shakes his head to confirm it. Sirius nods.
”Shut up, crazy person!” Harry laughs.
and, ignoring Dapne’s look of incredulity and the looks of exasperation on Pansy’s and Blaise’s faces, flicks the pages to ’D’.
Harry rolls his eyes, but steps into the man’s waiting arms.
”We don’t know that”, Harry counters. ”I know your father works fast, Draco, but
”I thought you weren’t friends with him anymore!”
”Mm, soon…” Harry mumbles, draping himself on top of him and kisses him deeply.
”Go, already”, Draco says and rolls his eyes affectionately. ”Go win the match for us.”
… Something you don’t

-confident”, McGonagall says sharply. ”I’m telling you now, regardless of your marks at the end of last year, if you do not put in the work, you will fail your Transfiguration OWL… now. Today we will be starting Vanishing Spells. These are easier than Conjuring Spells, which you would not normally attempt until NEWT level, but they are still among the most difficult magic you will be tested on in your OWL…”
”Well…” Draco says hoarsely. ”Just as well…”
”So if daddy is fine, he’s coming to see me off at King’s Cross, right?” Harry insists.
Draco lets out a high-pitched scream as one particularly enraged Skrewt runs at him with its trembling stinger raised and throws a smouldering plank at it before legging it out of the pumpkin patch and diving into Hagrid’s hut through the back door. Harry and the other Slytherins, as well as a couple of Gryffindor girls, hurry after him and together they barricade the door.

pass an OWL without serious application, practise and study”, Professor McGonagall tells them grimly. ”But I see no reason why everybody in this class should not achieve an OWL in Transfiguration as long as they put in the work — yes, you too, Longbottom. There’s nothing wrong with your work, except lack of confidence—”
he’d whispered, eyes shining with suggestion… and Blaise making a comment about Silencing Charms, in case they’d be —
”Here, Harry”, Sirius says and pours him a mug of coffee.
”What’s wrong?” Draco asks, frowning slightly at him.
laughing”, Harry grumles under his breath.
This memory is no different. Just before they take the plunge, Dumbledore informs him he’d been very lucky to get a hold of it and as Harry finds himself standing inside the house of the Gaunt family once again, he almost wishes that the old man hadn’t. He hadn’t much liked this place the last time Dumbledore took him and he definitely hadn’t want to revisit it.
”No, it’s too late, Harry — No, really — Don’t give me that look. It’s not courteous to floo call after ten o’clock, especially on a weekday. I will call them after breakfast tomorrow.”
Draco shrugs slowly, tilting his head as he studies him silently for a moment before he murmurs, ”There’s just so many people everywhere…”
”Yeah, sure…” Harry says, looking to his daddy for reassurance and receiving a smile.
He then turns around and belts out an oddly high-pitched shriek that makes the hairs in the back of Harry’s neck stand and he finds himself holding his breath and searching the darkness with frantic eyes while he waits for something to happen… Hagrid gives the shrieking cry again and Harry jumps slightly. Then he hears it…
”And… Mr Weasley…” Snape adds, glaring suspisciously at Ron. ”What are you two doing?”
”What if you knew you wouldn’t get caught?” one of the twins says in a hushed voice.
”Come on…” the blonde murmurs and takes him hand, steering him gently towards the dormitory staircase.
”What was that?” Professor Snape demands.
”Well, I’m not”, Draco continues stubbornly. ”I am going to make her pay.”
”Well that, at least, is reassuring to hear. I wouldn’t want either of you to miss out on any valuable learning, even though I am
Harry watches as the yellow letters begin to swirl madly and when it stops again, the words have been replaced with an image of a pair of round glasses under a mop of messy black hair and in-between the two sits a lightening bolt in the same bright yellow as the letters had been.
”Let’s go somewhere else”, he says cryptically.
Halfway through the last edition of
Bundled up in their green and silver scarves, Harry and the rest of the Slytherin Fourth Years make their way down to Hagrid’s hut for Care of Magical Creatures. As they pass the lake, Harry glances over at the Durmstrang ship, slung from side to side by the force of the December wind, its black sails billowing against the dark grey sky, and feels grateful for the thick stone walls of Hogwarts and the many fires inside…
"Malfoy.
- Hermione was wrong. Your father may have paid you your place in the team but you're good. You could have entered the team without your father's money.
It was not Malfoy's voice. It was the Professor McGonagall's. Harry rushed to open the door, forgetting Dobby had locked it. He tapped on the door, not too loud, and called Malfoy.
- Probably." Harry concluded, still staring at Colin with worried eyes.
Draco held his wand before him, pointing at the Dursleys. On Petunia's face, he could see a bit of Harry. It made sense. He remembered she was the sister of Harry's mother. It was the eyes, he decided. It helped make him hate her less.
- I don't know. Steps, I think. I first thought I was dreaming, but I've just heard it again. Can you see something ?
The moment the door closed, the room was in the darkness once again. Harry heard Malfoy getting out of bed and approaching Colin's.
These would be the last words spoken between them if Draco didn't intervene. And it would haunt Harry forever. He didn't want to care but like the time at his manor, he couldn't help it. His parents would be turning in their graves if they knew what he was about to do.
Without another word, Harry made for his relatives' neighbourhood. Draco followed. They could have apparated there but using magic would tell the Ministry where they were, so they had to run in the rain.
Draco stayed at the door, half inside, half outside. The Dursleys' house was small, and strange to him. It also seemed ridiculously easy to enter muggle habitations. Draco shook his head in disbelief. Did they have any idea of how to protect themselves at all?
Between the bombs and the people's screams, Draco couldn't even hear his own words when he opened his mouth to speak. He had meant to thank him. But Harry wasn't looking at him, he was too busy watching the muggles running away from the war, more terrified than they had ever been before.
- Dad, I don't want to go.
Draco had caught himself thinking of Harry as... Harry, and not Potter ever since they left the school grounds. For some reason, it had felt as if a wall broke down between them now. He suspected it was the same thing for Harry after Draco helped him and his friends. Or after Draco lost his parents. Maybe Harry felt they had a connection now that they both lost their family. If Potter's uncle, his wife and kid were dead, too, of course. But Draco would never let them become this familiar with each other. They were on the same side, but they were not friends. Draco's friends were all dead.
The voices became clearer and nearer. He heard a click and the door opened. The light allowed Harry to see Malfoy's annoyed face.
- Don't be stupid. Only the heir of Slytherin can open it.
"Does that mean it's you who opened the Chamber ?
- They're already gone, Draco stated. They must have. Like all the other muggles. If they didn't leave, they're idiots. And I'm not rescuing idiots.
- Oh." Malfoy simply said, visibly puzzled.
- You know I can make you if I want to, Harry told his cousin, losing patience. You're acting like I could hurt you. Like I hurt you before. And I could have. You've been horrible to me. But I didn't. So, why are you scared now?
Malfoy was the first to move. He climbed onto his bed in silence, and layed onto the mattress, sighed and turned his back on Harry and the petrified body.
- The legend says it can. I just... I was scared.
- Safe? Vernon shouted again. Safe, you say? Where? The whole country is a battlefield! Monsters everywhere! I saw a man tore another apart with teeth as big as my hands. This thing didn't even look human. Even children aren't safe from them. I heard disturbing things... things that would keep you awake at night, boy. Your people did this. And now you want us to come with you?
- Right. I should get some rest, too.
"She's my friend, though. And you insulted her. She could beat you easily in a duel, you know.
- I wasn't asking you, Harry said. You're coming with me whether you want it or not.
He thought of Snape, Tonks, his mother... of Harry when he saved him at Hogwarts, and after that at the Headquarters.
- I can't just leave them, Harry convinced himself. She's my mother's sister. And he's my cousin.
”Where is it?”
”No, wait!” Draco says hurriedly and puts the ink bottle down again. ”Wait, don’t go!”
Harry watches curiously as the dial whirrs back to zero after each number Sirius dials, until finally, the sequence of numbers is finished and a woman’s voice greets them.
”Just because you’re so jealous you can’t stand the idea of Harry not being in love with you for the t
Harry blinks.
”Thank you”, the woman’s voice says coolly. ”Visitors, please take the badges and attach them to the front of your robes…”
Harry tries to school his face in his most earnest expression, but it has the opposite of the desired effect, because suddenly Professor Snape has got his hands slammed down on the desk and his face shoved into Harry’s personal space, his dark eyes flashing angrily.
”Whenever I cast the spell on you, your mind immediately takes me to memories you fear or are… embarassed… about, in other words, memories that you don’t wish me to see, basically handing me weapons”, Snape says plainly. ”So this time I should like you to try and invite me to see
”Daddy what happened to that man, Pettigrew?”
He is however glad that he didn’t have to be around to see it. In fact, any amount of time spent away from Toad Face is time well spent… Harry is sure his nightmares will be infiltrated by bulging brown eyes and flabby cheeks any night now, but until then, he’ll try his best to forget about the woman’s existence…
”What do you mean
he thinks.
”What”, she says flatly. ”The Gryffindor party? Are you insane?”
”I slept great”, Harry says earnestly and sinks down in one of the chairs at the table.

”Well, it

going to die. It’s not so much a fear, or even a thought anymore. It’s a sense that fills his whole body and mind. A certainty.
Ron shoves his own roots over to Draco’s side of the desk and then picks up his knife again, probably to try and save the uneven pieces he’d cut for the other boy.
”She’s got a point”, Ron says.
”Yes, yes, I see it”, Ogden says hurriedly, concerned for the young woman as she begins to gasp and splutter around her father’s tight grip.
”No…” Harry says and sighs in disappointment. ”He’s in the Gold series… Do you want mine? It’s a Dragon card.”
… there?”
When he comes to again, Draco has joined him at the top of the bed and is resting his head over Harry’s racing heart.
One of the witches of the Jury stands up gingerly.
”No”, Harry says firmly.
That night he lies awake for a long time, thinking about his conversation with Granger. He tries to focus his mind on the floor plan she’d started drawing and on their various theories, but it keeps wandering back to the part of the conversation that had been about Draco — this world’s Draco and his Draco — and Granger’s words kept coming back to him:
”I knew I shouldn’t have taken this job straight out of Hogwarts…”
”Yeah”, Harry says. ”He’s very competitive…”
As it turns out, Professor McGonagall wasn’t exaggerating about
”Of course, we’re delighted to have you!” Narcissa says. ”Draco, darling, do show Harry to his seat…”
Harry thinks now.
He turns to look up at Draco and catches the blonde’s knowing smirk and feels his cheeks burn, but he thinks he might get away with it as the water that is now level with his waist is quite hot and the rest of his body is beginning to flush as well.
Harry tears his eyes away from the bird again and locates the Headmaster sitting slightly hunched down in the straight-backed chair behind the massive oak desk. His head is bowed and he is peering curiously at Professor Snape over the rim of his glasses.
he thinks as he gives the gamekeeper a sidelong glance. Hagrid could easily have lost his job, but obviously he didn’t.
Sirius will give him a sympathetic half-smile then, while Remus hugs him tightly from behind and burrows his face into the top of Harry’s head and mutters nonsense into his hair.
Professor Snape’s eyes flicker upwards briefly, before he pins Harry with another glare but this time it’s more exasperated than anything else…
”Why don’t you start from the beginning?”
. ”And treac—”
”You can be white”, he mutters as he sets up the chess board.
, Harry thinks.
”Maybe even Miss Parkinson”, Dumbledore suggests lightly.
”Okay, if you’re sure…” Harry says, handing him the Invisibility Cloak.
”Stupid, meddling Gryffindors…” Harry grouses.
”Does he…”
”That’s romantic…” Harry grumbles, peeling off his sweat-damp pyjama top.
At the end of the lesson however, Hermione Granger is the only student to have altered her match in the slightest, and Professor McGonagall holds it up for everyone to see, favouring Ms Granger with a rare smile. The match had been made silvery and rather pointy, Harry can see and feels a stab of envy, but also a grudging respect for the muggle-born girl. Draco looks thunderous and mutters about mudbloods and cheating.
”Nothing”, the other boy mutters.
of those detentions for when the Slytherin team has practise, forcing Marcus to replace you…
He gets up early the next day so that he can have breakfast with his dads before they take off. Remus hugs him goodbye and promises to be back for his birthday, then brushes a kiss over the lightening bolt scar on his forehead.
”What — I —”
”No — well, actually, yes — once — but…” Harry thinks back to the Welcoming Feast at the start of the year and the first time he saw Snape… Could it have been him in the forest?
”Grandma?” Daphne says suspiciously. ”Yeah? Why?”
”Technically it would save time—”
”Petrificus Totalus!”
And so it continues, higher and higher inside the vast Ministry.
”Yes…” the other boy mutters, sending a glare in Seamus direction as he sits down crosslegged in the grass, still rubbing his tummy.
The worry in Draco’s face immediately melts away when his gaze settles on Harry and he walks over and dumps two rolls and an apple in his lap, before squeezing down next to him in the armchair.
”Welcome!” he says in a carrying, booming voice and holds out his arms, the golden details on his plum-coloured robes glittering in the candle-light. ”Welcome to another year at Hogwarts! Before we commence another excellent feast, I have an announcement to make…”
Harry grins. Not only did Sirius persuade Remus, he did it in a rather cunning and foolproof way as well. If Harry didn’t know better, he’d think a Slytherin came up with it.
”I win?” Seamus says knowingly.
you’re not
”Very nice… well done, Lucius…” Voldemort says softly, brushing the back of his long, white fingers over the other man’s cheek. ”I’m impressed… now, step aside and let
”Well, yeah, but you also always make up in all sorts of sickly ways. It’s almost like… you pick a fight just for the excuse to be all lovey-dovey for a bit.”
Stomach plummeting, he can do nothing but stare… A body lies rigid and cold as though dead on the floor next to him. It’s Justin Finch-Fletchly, with a look of utter terror frozen on his face, similar to the one he’d had on his face the last time Harry saw him, when he was backing away from Harry in the Great Hall, convinced Harry had just set a snake on him…
They stand in silence, sipping their drinks for a moment. It’s not awkward or tense, but not entirely comfortable either… Harry can’t really explain it, but something about the atmosphere is just too obviously romantic…
”We’ll take him to the Hospital Wing”, Professor Dumbledore says calmly, but Harry can tell there is worry in his eyes.
”Not much to go on?” Harry whines.
”I’ve alerted Poppy”, he says in his silkiest voice. ”And Professor Dumbledore is waiting with the High Inquisitor in the Headmaster’s Office, but he assures you that there is no hurry…”
”What’s that, my dears?” Professor Trelawny says, turning her massively magnified eyes on Harry.
” Vernon Dursley hisses furiously, squinting at him through his sleep-swollen eyes.
Sighing heavily, Harry unties the small roll of parchment from her leg. An immediate reply can only mean bad news… the fact that Hedwig doesn’t take off again, but waits for him to read the letter, only confirms that his dads are upset…
”Probably… why?”
Harry thinks wildly.
An owl hoots somewhere nearby, startling Harry who almost slips off the branch. When he’s got his footing again, he leans forward to listen once more.
They make their way back to Harry’s house as the sun begins its decline on the sky, the almost orange light making Draco’s hair glow a pale gold… Harry keeps stealing glances at him and no matter how hard i he tries, he just can’t stop smiling.
Suddenly a meaty hand has grabbed a hold of his arm and hoisted him to his feet and he stumbles slightly as he puts weight on his sprained ankle, put this pain is nothing compared to what he just experienced and he continues to stumble after the hooded figure automatically.
