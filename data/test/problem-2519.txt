“The very bottom, for sure,” Draco said with an eye roll. “Harry, we have more galleons than anyone I know. Surely we can count this purchase as a loss and get rid of it.”
Wiping away his own tears of laughter, Harry said, “Oh but
Harry sat back to pull off his t-shirt. “Take your clothes off. I want to see.” He kicked his pyjama bottoms to the floor.
“I know, it’s all right.” He rubbed her back, while he pondered his next move. If they were kicked out of their pack, that didn’t bode well for their survival. “We can keep you safe here, Jane. We’re all taking care of each other, like you take care of Robbie. Food. A bed to sleep in. And—and Wolfsbane Potion, if you’ll take it. We can help you with all of it.” He stroked her matted hair. “You don’t have to do this alone.”
“Oh, all right.” Harry had to sit back when Draco jumped to his feet.
She took the children’s rejections and acceptances in stride, asking subtle questions of the willing that revealed their level of care. What was their favourite thing to eat? Did they have a special spot at the table? What was their favourite bedtime book? And did they get in trouble for not going to bed on time? What sort of games did they play? Did they ever leave the house?
the options. This is one possibility. We can marry and worry about an heir to satisfy your parents sometime down the line.”
For all his pent up energy, Harry moved slower than Draco anticipated. He took his time getting Draco hard and lowering himself oh so carefully with a deep groan.
He let himself imagine it for a moment, what friendship with Harry Potter might be like. If he didn’t have to worry about the little children, and the circling Aurors. If he didn’t owe Potter a life debt. Two life debts, if one counted the freedom he gained at his trial. What if they were any two blokes that met in a pub or a coffee shop or a nightclub.
“Well, since you went to all this trouble…” Draco said with a smile, banishing his cardigan to a patio chair. He started unbuttoning his robes as well. “This
“It’s okay,” he heard from the bathroom door. “I can fix it.”
Sorry Draco doesn't
Harry pumped furiously at his cock, a slow flush creeping down his chest. Draco smiled, knowing the end was near. He licked along his lips and flicked his tongue at Harry playfully.
And maybe… just maybe… Harry’s husband.
Pansy gave him an unimpressed look. “We’re having lunch in a bit, but I’m sure Pickles can bring you something now if you’re hungry.”
My cock springs free and his tongue swirls around the head.
And fucking around with the fucking
“You don’t have to be here, you know,” Draco said quietly. “The others take turns keeping watch with me.”
“Courtship leads to betrothal. Different rules for that, and it might last anywhere from months to years. You get married after that. Not sure what’ll happen when it’s two blokes, though. Historically, that’s filed under ‘confirmed bachelor’ or some such shit and not really looked at too closely.”
I hadn’t planned on falling asleep, especially not next to Draco on the same bed but apparently I did, since I feel Hermione shaking me awake. The first thing I see when I open my eyes is Draco’s pale face, slack in sleep. I startle in surprise only to come nose to nose with Hermione’s concerned expression. Her hair is completely out of control around her head.
Luckily Draco is out enough so that the track home goes by without complications. He is completely asleep when we arrive back at Grimmauld Place. I put him in bed, changing his clothes and cleaning him up magically. Hermione has made tea by the time I return to the living room. She smiles at me, when I let myself fall down onto the sofa opposite her.
I deeply apologize for the delay in posting.
“And if he gets scared of something? He could lash out”
“No, Malfoy please listen,” I kneel down in front of him, but he kicks out and I fall backwards when his heel hits my shin.
~ * ~
“P-Potter?” he mumbles, blinking tiredly, “What…?”
We exchange a look. We may have gotten Draco free from Azkaban now. But the harder part is yet to come. We have to help a man, maybe broken beyond repair back to himself.
See you next time. I am sorry for the delay again...
“Good morning, Draco,” I smile.
In September I return back to school at Hermione’s request together with her, Ron and everyone else who couldn’t complete their 7th year because of the war. McGonnagall, who is headmistress now, sets up a whole new dorm for what she calls the 8th year. The houses are mixed in the dorm because by far not everyone returned. Some didn’t survive the war, others moved away or just simply don’t want to finish school. But even then you can see the difference in the houses. While basically everyone from Gryffindor who made it through the war returned as well, Ravenclaw is about halfed and there are only a few Hufflepuffs. In our year that is. As for Slytherin. We don’t have any in the 8th year. After Malfoy got imprisoned most of them feared coming back I guess.
“Good morning Draco,” I say softly, “It’s time to get up. You have to eat something before I leave again.”
I smile back at her. We proceed to the living room in silence after that. Eventually I come to stand in front of the well-known door. It’s slightly ajar which allows me to watch Draco through the open space. I can’t help but smile at the picture he presents.
It earns me a sigh while the doors swing closed behind us, “Is this about Malfoy again? I was informed that you tried everything you can to get him out of there. And while I agree with you that his punishment was way too harsh for the little crimes he committed, you could never bring forth a good enough reason so the council would believe me. I cannot rile them up against me that much.”
She sighs, some tears escaping those huge pools. Then she puts one of her long fingers to her forehead. Like a wizard would do with a wand she draws out a silver string. I conjure up a vial and she puts it in there. My hand is nearly shaking with eagerness. Finally I have found the last piece to free Draco, something I have been working towards for two years now. I thank her again then turn to leave, the now corked vial tight in my grip. Even though I hear McGonagall shouting after me, I really have no time for that now. So I hurry out of the castle. As soon as I reach the outside of the barrier I disapparate. Back in my house the next thing I do is firecall Hermione over. She stumbles out of the flames shortly after.
Draco sighs and shakes his head, but he looks resolved to accept whatever is in store him. I even can’t help but admire him for it. Where did that whinny boy go who spent weeks complaining about a fall from his broom. Something must have changed him quite a bit.
“I know and I told them that he’s not healthy enough for such a thing. They hardly listened however. They only said that if we can’t present a statement soon, the case would be closed.”
“Excuse me,” I basically gape at him, “What?”
Michael nods and he waves behind us as we finally leave the prison. Outside Draco shows a proper reaction for the first time. That crooked smile reappears on his face and he stretches towards the sun in a longing movement. Hermione and I exchange a sad smile then she apparates us back to Grimmauld place while I hold Draco steady. He doesn’t even react to the feeling of apparition. I sigh as I stroke his dirty hair. She drifts off to the living room while I help (more or less carry) the blonde upstairs into a bedroom I had Kreacher prepare before I departed for the ministry. When I lay him down onto the bed, he gives me a last one of those crooked smiles before his empty eyes drift closed. I stroke his gaunt and sickly face a last time before I leave the room to join Hermione.
“It’s okay,” I purse my lips, “But yes, among other things.”
“Yeah, sure. I don’t really have any plans. Seven sounds good to me.”
“I will help him back on his feet. Get him back from wherever he is now,” I say with determination.
“Can I help you, sir?” a soft voice suddenly asks behind me.
“This is the young master’s bedroom. Do you need anything else, Master Potter?” she squeaks.
He chokes on another half-laugh, half-sob, “Don’t make promises you can’t keep, Potter.”
That’s what has me stumbling out of the floo in Andromeda’s house this Friday afternoon. She is already waiting for me, soft smile on her face.
Then she literally flees the room. I stare after her for a second until I hear a door slam open and then retching. Apparently she really got sick. Not that I can blame her. To think that Draco was hiding something like that even when we were still in school. Since she is gone, I pull the list to me to read it over on my own. A few minutes later she returns, looking pale, and falls back into the cushions next to me. I give her a short nod and she picks up the second list, the one about Draco’s mental troubles. While I finish and put away the first parchment, she only seems to turn whiter as she reads the shorter list. When she is finished, she just buries her face in her hands.
“No, please don’t punish me! I’m sorry! I promise I will make you proud! Please!” he whimpers.
“From here we still need to search by hand,” Hermione gives me a smile before we separate and I hurry off into the night in search for Draco.
“I know,” I sigh, “But he’s a fighter and he is already showing signs of recuperation. I am sure he can heal if we help him.”
I try to turn my head, but my already sore cheek rubs across the carpet and I groan, “That hurts.”
Disclaimer: I don't own Harry, but Andrea is an OC.
What follows is a relaxing afternoon of conversation. We try to avoid trickier subjects like Draco, the war or politics. I keep my magic half-way focused on the wards around Draco, more for Andromeda’s sake than mine. But there is nothing worrying. The spells register nothing more than Draco’s usual mood swings, which are harmless. I notice that he was very tense at the beginning, totally untrusting of little Teddy and the current happenings, but he relaxed over time as the toddler proved to be no danger at all. I can’t say whether he enjoyed playing with the little boy but he certainly seems as peaceful as he gets these days.
Harry’s mouth dislodges from the light suction he’d been working at the head of his cock, lips now open and pliant, a bit swollen and shining and so, so pretty — Draco groans, forcing his eyes to stay open as he comes over Harry’s open mouth, his tongue trying to catch the mess even as it smears higher, over his cheekbones and the bridge of his nose. His whole body shakes, pleasure wracking through him as spurt after spurt colors Harry’s blushed face in sticky white, still gorgeous as he lets Draco dirty him.
“Harry,” he swallows, and one of Harry’s eyebrows raises just slightly, making Draco grin, his boyfriend somehow looking smug even as he laps at the underside of his cock. Draco’s fist moves quicker over himself, waves of pleasure rolling through him, and he knows there’s no use in fighting it, “love, m’coming, open—”
m’so—”
“Begging like always,” Draco tsks, feeling his cock throb where it’s pressed against Harry’s outer thigh. He rolls his hips into the tight muscle there, making sure Harry feels the drag of his arousal fully, “feel how hard I am, darling? Wanna fuck you so bad, m’aching for it.”
“But— but your cock,” he pants, legs spreading so wide that one of his knees peeks out from beneath the sheet, rocking down into Draco’s hand.
He’s not going to last, but this isn’t the time for him to worry about such a thing — they’ve got plans to get on with, there’s things to be done, rather than just repeatedly falling into bed with his boyfriend over and over again.
“Fuck,” Harry gasps, eyebrows pinching and jaw slack — Draco lets go of his softening prick and kisses his head once more. Harry is having none of it, though, instead reaching blindly to try and grip Draco’s erection pressed tight against his leg, head turning to try and chase Draco's mouth.
“Mhm,” Draco agrees, unmoving as he leans more fully into Harry’s chest, their lips moving sweet and soft against each other, “we should.”
Harry hums, “good morning,” and kisses him again, all while Draco cards his fingers through his hair, “we should get up or we’ll be late.”
“But you want cock, I know,” Draco cuts him off, silencing him with a quick kiss to his lips, jaw slack under the touch, “we can’t always get what we want, can we, Harry?”
“I’m gonna come,” Harry’s eyes open once more, searching for Draco’s, pleading. His fingers curl, balling up into fists, his hole fluttering around Draco's fingers, “I can’t—”
Harry, ever eager, drops his mouth open and lulls his tongue out to rest against his lower lip, waiting. While it’s filthy and makes arousal throb inside of him, Draco feels a bit endeared at the sight, bringing the head of his cock down to press against Harry’s tongue, rubbing it over the delightfully wet heat that’s been offered to him.
“And you’re going to show me, aren’t you?” He drops his voice lower, pressing it against his lips, Harry’s open mouth swallowing his words, “going to show me how good you feel with my fingers fucking you, hm?”
he gasps, shoulders pressing into the bed as he arches, moaning loud and long as the wet patch covering his cock spreads, soaking the sheet as he comes, “Draco, Draco,
Spent, Draco’s chest heaves as he sits atop Harry’s, cock still in hand, unable to tear his gaze away from the absolute mess he’d made of his boyfriend's face.
Harry sleeps on his back, arms lazily splayed over his head and thrown atop the pillow near the curls that have gotten even more untamed in his sleep  — it’s often how Draco finds him; in the low light of morning sun peaking in just barely through the window across their bed. For a moment, he stops and just looks, free of shame because Harry can’t quirk an eyebrow up at him and ask him if he’d like to take a picture instead. He can’t hear the other’s snark, see his smirk pull at the corner of his lips, and while he loves all parts of Harry, even the cocky parts, he quite enjoys just watching him rest.
“You know I wouldn’t be able to keep quiet,” Harry smirks now, eyes still fluttering behind soft lids, “but I
“Fuck,” he mutters when Draco finally dislodges his come stained lips from Harry’s, “stop before I get hard again.”
“Darling, lay back,” he murmurs, and Harry listens, pliant after his orgasm. He drops his hands back to the bed and lays flat, watching Draco through blurry eyes.
He’s right — Harry isn’t one for hiding the way he feels pleasure, no matter the position he’s in. A rumble of a groan slips from his parted lips now, as Draco pulls out just to add a second finger, rubbing inside of him in a way he knows Harry likes. His hips press down into the feeling, and Draco grins at the wet patch forming on the sheet from Harry’s cock leaking.
Harry’s still trying to swallow what’s made it in his mouth, lapping at the come dripping into his mouth from his upper lip — Draco moves as quickly as his shaky legs allow and scoots, lowering himself to press his open mouth against Harry’s, licking his the taste of his come off Harry’s tongue.
“Yeah,” he pants, then again, softer,
“Haven’t you had your fill?” Draco taunts, rolling his hips into Harry’s thigh once more, “I was inside you for hours last night — we fucked each other full, didn’t we?”
“Don’t call me by my first name,” is the annoyed response, which brings a small smile on my face.
“Not? You said they would accept that.”
“Malfoy!” you yell down the Alley.
Disclaimer: The characters aren't mine.
After he got used to it he started taking Dragon out there to play with the cat. He still has difficulties moving on his own, but crawling works good enough by now. What still troubles him is keeping his balance. From what I read horse therapy can help with that kind of problems.
I on the other hand carefully approach Draco who is sitting on the ground in front of his cot, staring at the opposite wall, grey prisoner’s clothes covered in dirt. Even though I make no effort to hide my approach he doesn’t so much as turn his head. So I kneel down in front of him.
“Do you want a tea? Or something sweet? They make delicious pastries here,” I try to distract him. He blinks at me confusedly, “This is a café after all. I didn’t drag you out here just to walk here and back. I doubt they can reach the standard of tea you are used to from home but a warm drink and something sweet should help you to calm down, right?”
“I don’t remember how it felt to win my first horse competition. I don’t remember what the purple flowers in our garden smelled like. I don’t remember the Yule Ball in our fourth year and not what happened with Buckbeak. I don’t remember what Severus did for my ninth birthday nor…” he pauses, “Nor how my mother’s hugs felt, no matter how rare they were.”
“Yes, I came, Teddy,” I smile, ruffling his strands while still holding him a bit away from me to save myself from an aching scalp, “Sorry for not visiting for so long. I still missed you.”
Remember how you said in the morning after waking up that it never should have happened. That it would be best if we just forgot it. You said if you knew a memory charm you would perform it now. Hah, the famous boy-who-lived doesn’t know one of the basic spells. Apparently you didn’t listen to Granger well enough. I don’t know whether you meant it as a joke actually, but you seemed serious to me. So I performed Obliviate. Until today I am not sure why I did it, but to me it looked like this was what you wanted. So you will still be the perfect golden boy and you won’t have to live with the shame of having shagged your death eater enemy.
We process in tiny steps towards the stable. But to my surprise as soon as he hears the sounds of horses, Draco seems to stretch forward, instead of blocking and pulling backwards. This time it’s me who stares at Hermione over the blonde’s shoulder, but with an encouraging smile.
“I agree.”
He sighs, “Depends. Most people never forget a trauma if it was bad enough. On the other hand, your generation is strong. I doubt he will ever be like he was before the war, but he should recover, yes,” he tries to give me a reassuring smile, “I could give you the contacts of a friend of mine who specialises in psychology. I know he won’t care about the identity of his patient. Your friend wouldn’t be the first suspected death eater who he treated.”
“I know you know that,” Andrea laughs, “But you don’t have the balance to control a horse completely on your own yet. And with only one hand you can’t properly hold the reins either.”
Grey eyes flit to me and widen, “Potter? What the hell?”
I exchange a look with my friend, before sighing, “Alright, but if at any time it becomes too much tell us.”
Hello everyone,
“Dragon?” I kneel down to pet him, my cup of coffee floating in the air, “What are you doing out here alone?” he only meows, getting on his hind legs to kneed me with his front paws, “What is it?” he only meows louder, causing me to frown at his unusual behaviour, “Is something wrong?” I look up for the blonde usually not far from the cat, “Where is Draco?”
Once again she smiles, “This should help in court. Maybe now we can finally have some progress,” she sighs, “Though I am not too hopeful.”
“He hurts me,” he mumbles, carefully peering at me with unseeing eyes, “I didn’t even do anything wrong. Neither did that house elf.”
“Got you!” I grin triumphant, “Let’s see what secret you have been hiding. How much sweets did our headmaster order each year?”
“I am trying to describe a personality similar to our cat since he seems to get along with him so well,” I snort.
“Like me?” I don’t really like where this is going.
“That’s good,” he smiles, “I wish you luck with him,” he smirks, “and with the exam.”
Our walk is slow again, but he seems to have gained at least a little bit of strength from the first proper food in what I guess are months for him. Entering the bath, he twitches as the heat hits him. He is used to cold these days, so I run my hands down his back.
I nod, I had already suspected that he would not reveal himself so easily, “A house elf?”
“Even after two wars the wizarding world is still not changing then,” I smile sadly as I stroke Draco’s soft hair, “But for now I guess I’m happy with changing your world for the better.”
“Are you sure?” he repeats and for a second his eyes seen clearer.
I nod and sigh, “I am not sure why, but I really want to get him out of there.”
“But… Why?”
“Draco? Malfoy, are you okay?” I ask tentatively.
Any comment and kuods is appreciated though.
A good two hours later I am noticing that it is taking a strain on him. His hands are white-knuckling in his sleeve and the occasional twitches in his facial muscles hint that he may be fighting his mind falling back into the childlike state. So I lay a hand on Hermione’s arm.
“It’s okay. Just be more careful next time,” Hermione replies while I work on keeping Draco steady, murmuring to him about horses.
“That’s not even the worst of it,” she grouses and I feel like someone is trying to crash my chest, “It’s not the outside that worries me. It’s true he looks awful when you see him. But what really worries me is his mental health.”
laptop is mostly working but I don't have internet where I'm living during the week, so updates will be mostly confined to the weekends until my roommate finally gets the router. Currently I am leeching off my university's wifi ;)
“Is he worse today?” I ask.
“A house elf, Master Potter?” the little creature squeaks, closing the door behind us again.
Wearily I sigh again, “I know you’re not. You’re smart. But yes, I want to be friends with you. You might have done bad things during the war but none of them were on your own free will. Not to mention you saved more people. You are a good person, Draco Malfoy. And if you don’t believe me I will tell you until you do.”
“So what?” he glares but I can see his fingers dig deeply into his thin arms until they are creating red dents in the white skin, “Am I supposed to drop to the floor in gratitude in front of you now?” his lips pull into an aggressive, hateful smile, “Or maybe present my ass? Is that the way you want me to show my gratitude? The guards certainly seemed to enjoy it.”
“What – “ I ask but am interrupted by the chair on the other side of the table scraping over the floor.
The next big step happens once again with the horses. Three more weeks after my exam (which came back with a surprisingly good grade, even though I think Professor Javis might have had something to do with my test getting graded a bit more towards the positive) we are on another horse therapy session. Just me and Draco. Hermione hasn’t been accompanying us for a long time anymore. Especially not since Draco has started to consider the stable a safe place too (as long as there are not too many other people there).
Her ears flop dejectedly and her eyes fall to the ground, but then she nods to my greatest relief, “Yes, it was the young master who ordered Tilly to take care of the prisoners.”
When they disappear from my view I turn back to Andromeda, only to see the first tear slip down her cheek.
“For what?” he responds confusedly.
“And I am supposed to believe you?” he snorts, doing his best to regain his old haughty behaviour, but his whole form is tensed to run.
“Why wouldn’t he? He has people waiting for him here.”
“Hi Harry. Found a cat?” she asks, motioning to the cage next to my feet.
“So he was at the final battle?”
Disclaimer: Not mine
“I never knew,” I fall boneless into the couch, “He was in so much pain and never told anyone.”
“Well, I had to shoot a spell at him to put him asleep. Since then he is calm yeah, but I wouldn’t call him okay.”
“Oy Malfoy, I heard you dropped out of the Quidditch team,” I yell after you in an afterthought at passing you in the corridor, a piece of news I found very surprising to say the least and slightly disappointing to be honest (Quidditch just isn’t the same when you’re not competing with me), “Why would you do that?” I want to know, is there something wrong with you?
“Hello Draco,” she says lowly, bowing her head, trying to make herself look even less like a threat, “My name is Andrea. I won’t harm you. I just want to help you.”
“No,” he presses out, voice high and panicked, “It wasn’t me. I’m sorry.”
In fact, do you have friends? No matter when I see you these days, you are always alone. It seems sad to me. And you look slightly ill in recent time too.
Again, I'm not a doctor, I'm studying IT, so I'm just making this up as I go along.
He cleans all four of Shenan’s hooves with silent determination, slow and methodical. Afterwards he straightens up and strokes the mare’s head, praising her. She snorts and rubs her nose all over his chest. I can’t help but shake my head, the Draco I knew from school would have thrown a fit from having animal fur all over him. But instead he just smiles, rubbing between her eyes.
It also made me think about another possibility for Orion’s parentage. His ‘mother’ could have been a male too. It could have even been you yourself. That would at least explain your sudden disappearance. The time fit. Granted I already suspected that you left to be with whoever carried Orion. Still if I assume you carried him (which sends one hell of a painful stab through my chest), you must have slept with another male. Enough of a shame to run away and hide the child from everyone? But you love him I could see that at the station and in his behaviour, so not a shame. Besides Orion always talks about his ‘mother’, not ‘father’ or ‘other father’. So there was a woman. Who? I want to know. I care. Will you ever know how much I care for you?
Hermione nods and follows me silently. She makes careful conversation while the leaves brew. My hands are still wavery but we both let it go for now. My own last appointment at a therapist is long overdue as well, but I really don’t want to go. Despite the fact that I am a healer in training and know that I should go. Let’s just forget that for now…
The bustle of platform 9 ¾ is around us. Ginny is smiling and fussing over the children. I told her to stay home, but she wanted to say goodbye to me at the station. James is with Hermione so she only has to juggle two children but it is still a tad bit annoying. I really love my children a lot but I don’t need them in the middle of all this ruckus as long as they are still this young. So my eyes wander away from her and over the masses of people.
He snorts before sitting on the chair furthest away from us. He crosses his legs as well as his arms in front of his chest. His whole posture screams defensiveness.
“You can just call to ask for advice,” he shrugs while he scribbles something on a piece of paper, “Here. But don’t forget that tomorrow is another mandatory lesson,” he smirks, “Maybe you will be a bit more attentive then.”
She nods back before an annoyed customer calls and she has to return to work. I just got back outside when hurried steps announce someone’s approach. When I spin around in the vain hope that it might be Draco, I discover it’s Hermione running towards me.
I am currently trying to change something in my study plan, but it proves more than difficult. When I call, no one picks up and my E-Mails are always answered with 'that's not our responsibility'. That is so frustrating...
“You okay, Harry?” she asks worried.
I can’t finish the sentence though because at this moment I feel a weight dropping on my thigh. Startled I nearly jump, but soon I realise that it’s not more than Draco who has put his head there, Dragon crawling over the bright locks and padding over onto my leg. The cat meows as if trying to break me out of my gloomy mood. I smile sadly and use one hand to caress the boy’s head and the other to scratch the cat behind his ears.
Disclaimer: Not mine.
I laugh nervously, “Nothing, I… Never mind,” I break off, “I have to get ready for dinner at the Burrow now. I’m sorry, but I have to hurry.”
“Morning,” I answer to her greeting.
He doesn’t react, neither to an apology. When I try to shake him, he only gives a strangled sound, pulling his legs closer to his body. His head is now shaking left and right frantically. His whole body is shaking and rocking. But still he does not make any sound. His eyes are wide, face haunted and frantic, but there is not so much as a peep from him. That’s what worries me the most. That he suffers in complete silence.
After a fast shower and changing into better clothes I hurriedly apparate to the Weasley family home. Since I want to ask them about my new findings too I have some report sheets with me.
“Yes,” he forces out, taking one slow step after the other.
next chapter, despite me having a pretty busy weekend because it's christmas baking time.
“Potter?” he glares, his anger a default reaction to cover the panic after coming to at an unfamiliar place with no memories of the recent months, “Where am I? What are you doing here? Where is my wand?”
It’s two days later when I really hear him speak for the first time. After a day spent mostly in the backyard, reading and playing with Dragon, Draco is tired. As usual I bring him to bed like you would do with a small child (I don’t read him a bedtime story though, he usually does that by himself). After pulling the covers over him, he starts to make sounds in the back of his throat and I realise that his stuffed dragon is still laying on the other side of the room. I stroke his hair and summon the thing, earning me a contented sigh from him.
After filling out the forms with my address, contacts and some more details about Draco, she smiles at me.
“Yes,” I nod, revelling in the fact that here in the muggle world no one recognizes my name.
“What is that?” I frown at the thing.
This is another dark chapter.
“And he is,” I hurriedly explain, nearly falling over my words in the process, “Like 99% of the time. But there were some very few times when he kind of responded to me directly. It wasn’t like he talked or anything, but he seemed to understand my emotions and react accordingly.”
“A book?” I ask and at a blink I start lifting one book after another until he gives me the same pronounced blink.
“So I’m a prisoner in this house,” he tilts his head up, crossing his arms over his chest, the movements of his left arm choppy and slow, “I should have known.”
“He was there before the battle. Whether he fought, I can’t say, but I doubt it since I stole his wand and he lost his mother’s.”
Teddy tilts his head at the blonde’s uneasy face, “Kitty?” he asks, holding the squirming cat up towards Draco.
I would be lying if I said that it wasn’t one of the best mornings of my life waking up like that. But only before the reality of our situation came back to me, but it was still a great experience. Unbidden the thought came to my mind that this is how I want to wake up for the rest of my life. As soon as I thought that, I blushed and tried to shake it off, despite smiling softly down at Draco’s peaceful face.
Sorry, I'm in a hurry because my internet is about to cut out.
Dusting my hands off, I turn around, “Hello Professor. What is it?”
“Are you sure you’re okay?” I ask him with a smile, even though he isn’t looking at me.
He shakes his head in his sleep, “Here… Bed…”
But on the other hand my loud arrival (banging the door too) has called my two best friends out. The two have not been at the trials, instead helping with either rebuilding or family matters. We agreed to meet up in the evenings so they have been waiting for me in the house I inherited from Sirius. It takes no less time than for me to take off my coat and throwing it over a hook to the side, for both Hermione and Ron to storm into the corridor.
She nods softly in agreement, “I think you might be right. It just makes the story sadder. Anyway, even though this is some heavy scar tissue on his arm, I don’t think it would inhibit his movement or cause him any serious pain. Some stinging maybe if he moves it the wrong way but nothing worse. So like I said the reason he doesn’t move his left arm is most likely psychological. He probably connects some kind of trauma with the dark mark on it.”
A bright smile breaks out over my face and I fall to my knees next to his head, fingers immediately in his soft hair, “That’s great, Draco!” I laugh, at least that gets him to carefully lift his eyes over the green fur a bit, “I am so proud of you. Yes, goodnight.”
One question though, I've got a few stories on my computer that are written only a few chapters in. I have always been reluctant to upload anything that's not finished, but that means it's likely those stories will never be uploaded.
“I don’t, don’t worry,” I smile, he is as difficult to get talking as you were, “I just want to know what he is doing these days.”
“No, thank you for now. I will call you when I want to leave again.”
Her eyes widen to an almost impossible size, “Tilly is… The young master… He…”
“Yes,” I sigh, tightening my right arm around his waist. A moment later we are gone, only to reappear at the top step of Grimmauld Place. He slumps against me and I’m not sure whether he is still with me or not. However I want to get him inside first, so I lift him to settle his head on my shoulder. He is still incredibly light, mostly skin and bones as he is. As much as Hermione and I have tried, it’s difficult to get flesh back on his bones. He has always been more the skinny type, but his body still hasn’t recovered from his time in Azkaban. It does worry me, but from the last scan we did, I could find nothing to cause this. Subsequently all we can do for now is feed him as much as we can, which isn’t much unfortunately because he only eats small portions.
It’s Draco! I nearly startle away, but he makes an uncomfortable sound at my movements so I go still again. He huffs in his sleep and digs his face into my arm. I shush him carefully and stroke his hair. He pulls a face at my touch, which causes me to chuckle a bit. His nose scrunches up and while I think about how cute it is, I don’t notice his own eyes drifting open. The moment his sight seems to clear, his eyes go wide in shock.
“Yes,” she gives out a pained hiss, “I agree with you. I am just seeing this the rational way. Maybe,” she squirms uncomfortably in her seat, “it might be better to end his suffering. He has been through so much we don’t have to make him put up with even more. I…”
“A bit, I would say,” I answer, “But it’s nothing worrying I would say. Michael told us to expect differences in his behaviour after all.”
“What happened to him?” I ask nervously.
“I agree without a doubt,” she nods then suddenly grips one of my hands, “But you look not that much better than him, Harry. You should take better care of yourself.”
He takes shaky steps further into the room. I lead him over the threshold and stop him. Carefully leaning him against me, I very slowly put my hands on the hem of his prison shirt. He barely flinches as I start moving it upwards. When I finally pull it over his head, I feel him shudder in my arms, but he stays still. When I run my eyes over his naked upper body, my throat closes. He is literally nothing but skin and bones anymore. His skin is something between pasty white and sickly grey. He is littered with bruises, cuts and scars. Since I can see each bone clearly, I also spot some bumps on them which suggest that they were broken and not properly healed. I take a shuddering breath, mumbling apologies all over again.
As soon as the ministry hears the name ‘Malfoy’ they put up walls. We have achieved lighter punishments for a bunch of other people in similar situations like him though. A little victory, just not the one I wished for. As for the proof, I have run out of options. The only thing I haven’t tried is talking to Draco directly, but I doubt he would be much help nowadays. Luna managed to get through the ministry three months ago and was allowed to visit him in his cell and what she told me was anything but encouraging. I remember that day clearly.
“Are you sure I can come in here?” Ron asked nervously.
“Oh, dear, of course I’m glad to see you, Harry,” She said in a much softer tone, “I’ve got your breakfast on, now. You look famished. Not to worry, we’ll sort you out.”
"See you in a minute, I hope..."
“Fine, but I want a full explanation when this is over. I hate being kept out of the loop.”
“Come along, Potter,” McGonagall said, sounding a lot gentler than she had moments before.
“Fine,” He said, jumping to his feet, and Harry winced when Slytherins turned to stare at them, “I was trying to be nice to you, Potter. I see now that I shouldn’t have bothered.” Then he stormed off to their dormitory.
He laid down on his bed. He’d already sipped his soup broth for the night and the room was already getting dark. Hedwig hooted softly again, low enough to be for his sake only.
Harry just scratched out his next sentence. There was no way he could tell Malfoy about any of this. He just didn’t trust him, even if he had saved Harry’s life on Halloween and inadvertently helped his investigation just now. Besides, Malfoy was right. Harry had saved his life first.
They’d interrogated him about Harry his first night. Draco had expected them to be angry about the stone, but his father seemed most interested in what had happened that night. He pressed for every detail Draco knew, which was whatever Harry had deigned to tell him that day at the feast. His father seemed uninterested in any details about Harry himself, but his mother seemed more curious, like Draco had been growing up.
Draco’s felt embarrassed again. He eyed one of the books to the side. It wass a muggle poetry book. He pretended to be very interested in its title.
worn this year.
“Cupboard?” Fred asked, glancing at the rearview mirror. He pressed a button on the dash and swooped lower. George made a vague gesture to the right.
It was the best evening of Harry's life. Slytherins cheered, a few even clapping him on the back and congratulating him, Malfoy stared at him for most of the night, Ron and Hermione ran to give them hugs, Hermione’s face still streaked with tears.
A storm of cheering and stamping broke out from the Ravenclaw table.
Narcissa put her arm around Draco’s shoulders and squeezed him tightly. Draco closed his eyes as he leaned into her warmth.
“Good going, mate. Now we’ve got the whole break to relax.” Ron said. He had also read the card and admitted that the name sounded vaguely familiar.
“How do you all know each other already?” Harry asked.
“We? You’ll really get caught if Weasel’s going. He’s about as subtle as a mountain troll,” Malfoy drawled, but Harry wasn’t fooled. “Is this Flamel related? I did some research. The elixir of life I was talking about? I’ve heard you lot muttering about a stone. I’m not an idiot.”
His scar had also been hurting more than ever since his trip into the forest with Hermione when they’d encountered Voldemort. Hermione was so focused, she even waved this off, though she always turned several shades paler.
“Sure,” He shrugged, “But Slytherin doesn’t need me to set a reputation, now does it? It seems like you lot have that down all on your own.”
“Then why did Dumbledore give you points then?” Blaise asked.
They were quiet for the rest of the trip, all the way up until they climbed the stairs to their dormitory. Malfoy was about to climb into his bed when Harry said, “Malfoy?”
“Yes, I see now I should have just reported you to Filch,” Hermione said coolly.
“That means she knows all the gossip,” Zabini said in a bored voice.
“Fourth, to Draco Malfoy…”
“Ron’s on there?” Harry asked, interested at last.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Not Slytherin,” Harry thought, thinking of Malfoy’s pinched face and Hagrid telling him about He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named back in the Leaky Cauldron.
He pointed down the hall towards the door at the far end that would eventually lead to the Grand Staircase. They crept but they’d hardly gone a few paces when Harry heard another frightened squeak followed by a startled yell from Ron and then crashing as Neville tackled Ron into a suit of armor. They all crashed to the floor. Harry and Hermione looked at each other. If possible, Hermione looked even more murderous.
“Please tell me you aren’t going after him,” Blaise said tiredly.
Malfoy followed him to the door, hissing like an angry cat. Especially when they veered from the other Slytherins and joined a group of Hufflepuffs.
Not that he had to sit alone for long, though, because the doors were suddenly thrown open loudly and Professor Quirrell came storming in.
Harry huffed, carefully picking his way down the path to Hagrid’s. Considering how close Malfoy was to him, one wrong move could send both of them tumbling down.
“Potter…” A voice suddenly said. Harry looked up to see Malfoy, standing next to the empty armchair with a book, looking like a bird ready to take flight.
last year. I’m sure you strive to be a credit to your house…”
Predictably, potions went badly but it was hard to be daunted when he and Ron walked out of the classroom talking as easily as they had on the train. Harry ended up inviting Ron with him to go visit Hagrid, which would probably cause Pansy to have an aneurysm if she’d heard.
“You’re a tosser, you know that? I want you to know that you almost got us killed tonight. And don’t think that if you had gotten me expelled, I wouldn’t have come to murder you.” Harry growled.
Ron glanced at Harry with concern, but the others looked intrigued. Mrs. Weasley was gone only a moment before she was back. She passed the photograph to Harry.
I only wave it off until another asks, “Had fun?”
But before I can turn back to my book, his singing suddenly breaks off and a sharp voice a lot like the one I knew from Hogwarts sounds, “No, you aren’t Dhalia. She was black and – “ a break in his speech has me on my feet immediately and on my way to the other door, “Where am I?” he asks just before I can pull it open.
“You didn’t pay much attention did you?” she sighs and stands up, “You thought about Draco the whole time am I right?”
“From him? Nothing. I didn’t cure him for myself or to have a new project like he accused me earlier,” I frown.
“Was anyone else aware of it?”
Important Warnings: more mentions of rape, torture and abuse.
“NO!” I yell, finally finding my voice again, but he doesn’t care.
I see Andromeda relax, but she still doesn’t move. I on the other hand step closer to the nervous man, still smiling. Of course he would never hurt him. Seeing no adverse reaction as long as his aunt stays back I extend my arms towards him.
Kingsley browses through the sheets, “Indeed if this person is Draco Malfoy he deserves honours more than a prison cell. However you have not given me proof yet. Even though I believe you, the council will not.”
“But you didn’t join on your free will, did you?”
“Nothing special. I went outside and at first it was fine,” he recounts slowly, face pulled into a grimace, “Then I… I came across a couple with their dog. I thought it would be fine, simply turned away but the dog wasn’t controlled and jumped at me,” he takes a shuddering breath, “I startled and fell. The thing was still licking and bothering me, but at least the couple noticed. They tried to pull him away. I was still mostly in control, even if it was difficult, until the man suddenly reached down and grabbed my left arm. I-I,” he swallows, “I don’t remember much after that. Just running, running and fear. Every time I thought I could calm down I came across another dog or person and it started anew.”
Disclaimer: The characters aren't mine.
“I don’t know,” the two exchange a look, “The Order would have kept them safe, I guess.”
“Yes, I think she said her name is Tilly. A Malfoy house elf, but it was Malfoy Manor after all. But why are you asking this all?” she fixes her eyes on me imploringly.
“Let me guess, Draco?” she sighs.
I sigh and run my hand through my hair. I am not getting the name out of her. If a house elf was specifically ordered to not tell anything, they will never do so under any circumstance. But while I’m already here…
He snorts and averts his eyes, trying to tear from my hold, but I keep him still, “I want out of here,” he growls, gaze turned away as well as he can, “It feels like the walls are closing in on me. And the garden isn’t enough.”
I gasp, “You know who I am?”
Unwilling to break the calm atmosphere I set to watch him. My eye falls on a toppled stack of books next to the door. I guess that is what caused the crash earlier. But that was stacked securely, I remember that clearly. And Draco was way too far away from it, not to mention that he wouldn’t be able to move over there. So what threw it over?
She smiles sadly, “Remus’ diary from his 6th year in Hogwarts.”
thank you for the kudos and comments. They are always appreciated.
“I went to school with him and I haven’t seen him for a long time. I just want to know what he has been up to these days.”
“That you are,” I bury my face in his long hair to hide my own tears, “You are so much stronger than I ever was.”
“Probably,” I nod sadly, rubbing his hands until I feel him relax the slightest bit.
“As you maybe know the Malfoy case has been opened again. There will be a new trial for Draco. The Ministry requires a preliminary statement from him,” he replies, completely ignoring the second part of what I said.
“She asked you?”
Will you ever know that I loved you?
“Well, they are trying to dig up new evidence. Kingsley is pushing for progress but whoever is on the job isn’t as open as him and is barely doing anything,” she snorts, “Also, they want to wait until Draco can give a statement.”
And damn right I do! Why did you never tell me that Orion is my son? No mysterious woman who you slept with in our sixth year. Bullshit! It was you who carried and birthed him. And it was me who you slept with. My memories still aren’t back, you bastard. All I know is what you wrote to Orion. And that’s not much. But I want to know the details of what happened that night. And the morning after. Why you deleted my memories, why you never told me. You really took that secret into the grave with you. Lou knew I assume. Who else? Snape? Blaise or your friends? At least I solved the riddle why you disappeared in our sixth year. You left to give birth. God, why did you never tell me what happened. I would have stayed with you!
Hello everyone,
“Did not!” I growl, hitting her arm.
“I’m not. It’s just sad seeing him so broken…”
“It seems to work out perfectly,” I grins.
I apologize for the delay in posting.
“Oh Draco,” I murmur and once again pull him into my arms. He doesn’t resist this time, “It will come back,” I try, but he shakes his head.
She nods, face thoughtful though, “I agree. This is a great start and I don’t want to worry you. However don’t be too careless. Like his condition, the way he reacts to Dragon could change within the span of hours. He’s not stable enough yet to hold a mood.”
“So that’s Draco then?” Andrea asks next, turning to the light blonde.
“Is Tilly here? From the Malfoy household,” I ask loudly.
“Oh god,” I can just keep myself from sobbing into her shoulder, “But he never let anything show of that.”
I grumble but hurry through the opening after the other man. Luckily nothing seems to have happened. He has his working hand and shoulder against the wall of the stalls. Curious horse heads peek from a few of the windows. Most pull back though when he sways past, as if understanding that if they touch him they might upset his course and cause him harm. Eventually he stops, panting slightly as if he just finished a run around the Quidditch field. I smile sadly at how weak his muscles have become. Still leaning against the wood he reaches his working hand out to stroke the nose of a brown horse carefully sniffing his hair.
“I think having the dragon with him actually helps. Before he would never have refused anything or pointed at something. It’s a step right?”
Another meow has me grinning and I spend the rest of the afternoon playing with our new cat until it is time to check up on Draco again.
Finding her is turning out to be a nearly impossible task however. By now I have discovered some old articles with magic pictures about the two of them. A young Draco atop a beautiful grey and white horse, holding up a trophy or executing a jump. The mare itself however seems to be lost to time. Draco said all the horses were sold during his time at Hogwarts. The paper trail is gone unfortunately since the mansion burned down.
“No!” I glare at him and can’t overlook how he startles at my loud voice, so I soften, “No, you didn’t.”
He nods nervously, “Not alone. But warm, not bad. Is better.”
“Tilly is cleaning the young master’s bedroom at the moment. Do you wish me to call her for you?”
“What?” his eyes narrow.
“He-He was there…” he shudders.
“No, but you are sleeping on the floor, Harry,” the rustling of clothes sounds as the shadow above me moves.
“Oh my god. All this time,” she breathes, “I thought Malfoy was just an asshole, but he put his life on the line during the war. He saved countless people and his reward is imprisonment until either death or insanity. The world is not fair.”
“Well, you are going to sleep now. Draco is sleeping too for now and I will try my best to keep him calm should he wake up. You need sleep more than he does right now,” when I open my mouth to protest, the woman glares at me, “Don’t make me put you under with a spell.”
“Well at least I have persons who would want to have sex with me and I’m not still a virgin like you!”
He seems to think for a moment and I keep silent, knowing he needs his time to respond. Eventually though his face scrunches up. A bony hand stretches out and does a vague motion in the direction of the stack of books on a small table opposite his bed.
Eventually I manage to secure the unresponsive limb in the sling, only to have something hit me in the back as well. I huff and glare at the other boy playfully.
I am making this quick, cause I have exam season right now and I don't really have time to post. That also means there might be no chapters during the next weeks.
Nonetheless it’s progress so I am humming lowly as I walk down the hallway. I come past Draco’s room and out of habit throw a look through the partially open door. I grind to a halt immediately though.
“Well, he’s certainly getting more active when we’re getting closer to horses,” I huff as I catch myself against the wall of the stable.
I still can’t help but feel a twinge in my heart when I see her. Is that jealousy? Possibly. Because you two seem so happy. And I am currently pretty annoyed at my own wife and all you feel when you see me is anger and disgust. Instinctively I move towards you and whoever the woman at your side is.
“For being honest and answering the questions.”
Ron, with blood covering half of his head, skull cracked open. Hermione’s eyes are vacant, burn marks of a death spell at her temple. Teddy’s small body twisted and pale. Sirius looks like when I saw him fall through the veil, seemingly floating in the air. A crushed figure is laying next to a dead George with slit wrists.
“That’s nice,” she smiles, though still not with as much enthusiasm as before the beginning of the war, “I’m sure you’re hungry then after working the whole day. Come to the table.”
We quiet down again, everybody eating their breakfast. After he is finished, I help Draco back to his feet and lead him to his room. He follows without protest. But before I lower him onto his bed, he throws his arm out. It’s vague and I have to do some guesswork until I manage to work out from the hints he gives that he wants his favourite book again.
“I agree,” she frowns, “Right now, giving a well-known Death Eater an Order might create unrest and that’s the last thing we need. I will be content when his properties have been returned and I can get compensation for his suffering.”
Stubborn idiot. But he won’t be deterred and now is as good as any time to take the next step, especially if he is the one initiating it. We can still end the attempt within a moment if it turns out to be too much for him. I have chosen a quiet muggle café around the corner for our first outing. It’s just a small bistro, with only local customers. By foot it takes less than two minutes to get there and there are booths in the back, that shield you from the people out on the street. The fact that it’s muggle also means that we have to worry less about anyone recognizing either me or Draco and causing a scene, even if we don’t use glamours.
“Draco?” I am now running through the house, opening room after room. Dragon is keeping at my heels as good as the small cat can. But no matter where I go, he isn’t here. A tracing spell for him comes up empty. I come to the horrified realisation that Draco is not in the house anymore, he’s gone. Where I have no idea.
“Come on, walk with us,” Andrea motions to me as she starts to lead Shenan around the hall.
He huffs, but nonetheless goes back to brushing the horse’s fur. I smile at the picture. Still he shies and moves away to another spot of the horse every time Andrea comes close to him. She finishes soon and lets him continue touching the palomino while she puts the cloth and belt from last time back on Shenan. Draco gives a disgruntled noise as I pull him away from the horse after a motion from Andrea. Hermione follows us as we make our way to the riding hall. The therapist puts the rope on again as well as she leads Shenan behind us. Draco reaches out to one or two other horse noses along the way.
Professor McGonagall shoots me a look I am still familiar with from my own school time, “I would very much appreciate it. Unfortunately Dumbledore was never one for much order or tidying up and well, the people after that just didn’t have the time,” she then frowns, “Mind you, that there aren’t only school papers here. Some of these sheets contain information about or for the Order. This room can only be seen and entered by members of the Order as well. That’s why I need you to sort this out. You have to separate the papers for the school from those for the Order.”
“That’s one point. Also, Teddy needs a lot of attention, he’s not even three after all. But Draco already requires so much attention. Not to mention that I have to study as well at some point. I am bordering on being forced to repeat some lectures anyway. I can’t take care of Teddy as well when I can barely manage Draco and my life at the same time.”
“I can’t ask him those,” I growl desperately.
Draco doesn’t make any move towards the cat. The animal gives out a meow, like he is trying to catch the blonde’s attention too. As usual his only answer is another blink. Careful of Draco’s expression I lower the furball onto his lap. But he doesn’t seem to react negatively. Unfortunately he doesn’t really react at all. Just watches me put the cat on his legs. Not even his functioning hand is lifted towards the animal. Apparently Dragon refuses to accept that though and instead of just laying there like he did with Hermione and me, he gets up on his paws and does the two steps across Draco’s thin legs. Once he reaches the bony hand, he energetically bumps his head against it.
Due to that I turned to the magical world. However they don’t have something like the internet, so without any papers, tracking a single horse is difficult. It requires many owls and a lot of footwork. I have found out that most Malfoy horses were sold to other purebloods. A lot of them went to France or Germany, but Kari was not among them. She was sold by Narzissa, not Lucius like the others, to some small breeder for Thoroughbreds. I tried contacting the man, only to find out he died a few years ago. His son sold the horses again, but I haven’t been able to get in touch with the younger man yet.
Disclaimer: Not a chance.
He nods and turns away from me. I do the same and somehow manage to get back to Grimmauld Place without falling asleep. Hermione welcomes me in the front hallway.
“I haven’t seen you for ages,” I say, smiling happily at being able to talk to you, “How’s it going?”
“Master Potter,” the elf hurriedly bows deeply, “Of course. Matty welcomes you at Malfoy Manor. I am sorry but none of the masters is here currently.”
I wanted to update one more time before I drive myself insane again over my grades for this semester (coming up on the website this friday, yay...).
“Your aunt and great-cousin,” I explain.
“Is that what you called her?”
“What is it so soon?” her eyes fix on my eager face, “Did something good happen?”
“Okay, I get it,” she waves her hand, “You’re right. These moments give you hope. And me too, if I’m honest. But still, Harry. Even if you manage to pull him out of there you will still put him through quite a lot. When he comes back and regains his memories, he is going to go through all that pain again. And the aftermath of it. Are you prepared to help him through that?”
Disclaimer: Not mine.
“Beating you is really not worth my time,” you say haughtily, “You always just had luck on your side. Now do me a favour and go back to your loser friends, you are giving me a headache.”
When I wake back up, six hours later, we have moved and I have stretched out along the couch. To my surprise I discover Draco laying half on top of me, sleeping peacefully nonetheless. His right hand is curled into my shirt and it seems as if he is using me as a replacement for his stuffed dragon. Not that that changes anything about the soft, warm feeling spreading through my chest at feeling the other man so close while still calm and peaceful. So I just stroke his head and let him sleep on, my arms wrapped around him.
I squirm in my seat, “Unfortunately not. His guardians are not in the picture,” I clear my throat, “His father is dead and his mother is in the mental ward. She is not properly aware of the world around her.”
Hello everyone,
Hello everyone,
She raises an eyebrow, “Wow, you look like shit today, Harry.”
“Unfortunately it will probably be accepted. The wizarding community doesn’t care much if an ex-Death Eater gets justice or not if it doesn’t have anything to do with punishing them.”
“Alright, so simple things. Let’s take baby steps,” I take his right hand, the left is still laying unresponsive in his lap, “I know you at least have an idea of what I am saying. You always do, even if it takes you time to understand it,” I take a deep breath, trying to think of something very easy. Right, Michael said he sometimes recognised his own name, “Okay. Do you remember who Draco is? Who is Draco?”
“That’s good,” he nods, “Thank you. You can go now. But tell no one, not even any of the other house elves.”
“Like I said, depends…”  I repeat, “Why are you asking questions about the Malfoys?”
“Everything okay, Harry?” she looks me up and down, “You don’t look so good.”
It’s the trials. The biggest clean-up after the second wizarding war has been done and now they are dealing with the remaining death eaters. Quite a number of them died during the final battle, some committed suicide in their holding cells to avoid Azkaban and luckily less than we feared could escape the country. I was asked to watch the proceedings as I know the most about the Dark Lord and his organisation (at least according to them, I would think higher members of the Order of the Phoenix would have been better). So now I am witnessing my 14th trial since the beginning of it all. Up until now every person put to trial has received a relatively just punishment. The court is now sentencing a young woman who I forgot the name of to seven years in Azkaban in the top layer (the easiest confinement; no dementors, no dark hallways, acceptable food and so on). Thought so, from her testament under Veritaserum it became clear that she was a minor pawn who did little more than legwork and has never killed anyone. I yawn while she is led out of the room.
“Maybe that’s exactly what we need,” I grin and hand the cat over to her inspection, “A dragon to help another dragon.”
“Yes, yes,” I catch him, “We are getting moving.”
“Yeah,” she strokes my shoulder, “Look Harry. I don’t want to scold you. I am sure you are doing your best in taking care of Draco, but you really have to take the upmost care to not push him. At least not yet. Maybe later in the healing process but it’s way too early. Michael warned us, he can fly into a panic at any moment. The most important thing with him is now to keep it calm and give him time.”
“Harry?” the voice repeats, “Are you still alive?”
“I’m not being pessimist here,” he looks up at me now, grey eyes hard, but shining with tears for the first time in all the years I’ve known him, “It’s true, simply a fact. My mind is too messed up to ever recover completely…” his eyes are averted again.
Disclaimer: I don't own them.
“Only because you don’t have friends doesn’t mean I’m the same, you bloody spoiled prat,” you scream back at me.
Limbs heavy from sleep, the blonde tries to sit up, “Where am I?”
“Do you want me to go first?” I ask Draco as he is standing in front of the door, hand hovering in the air nervously.
“Unfortunately he does,” it’s Hermione who disagrees with me, “If we want justice for him, he will have to.”
He gives a choked, unbelieving laugh and this time I can clearly hear the tears in his voice. I don’t think he is allowing himself to cry them, but they are there nonetheless. I nuzzle his hair, not sure who I am trying to comfort with this. I guess we are making a really strange picture for the rest of the guests but Lena is effective at keeping anyone from complaining.
Disclaimer: Not mine.
“The Ministry confiscated the Malfoys’ belongings? Is that legal?”
Who is he? He looks a lot like you, you know. Is he your son? That would fit, but isn’t he a bit old? If he’s eleven years… If I would count back wouldn’t that be still in our school time? I doubt that. So your cousin or something like that? I never knew there were more Malfoys.
He stares at me for a few more seconds before he turns and disappears around the corner. I run my fingers through my hair as I walk out after him, heading in the direction of the entrance. After slipping on a jacket and shoes I don’t have to wait long until soft footsteps down the stairs announce Draco’s arrival. I guess he really is eager to get outside. Nonetheless he is also undoubtedly nervous. His left hand clenches in the material of the coat he is wearing and his movements have become slow and somehow clumsy for the first time in months. I watch him worriedly.
Instead, I'm going to put up a warning for mentions of abuse, self-harm and suicide in this chapter.
“Still – “ the guard tries but his colleague nudges him urgently.
“We have taken on patients from Andrea before. If she says it’s better for them to take normal riding lessons, then that’s what we are going to do,” he smiles, “What special conditions does he need?”
A pale forehead furrows in confusion, “What?” he croaks out.
“You want me to sleep here?” I sort out of his sleepy words.
I groan and am hard pressed to stick my tongue out at her, only narrowly managing to not do it. After all it’s not like she’s wrong. Suddenly I feel one of her arms wrap around my shoulders.
The same goes for any mistakes in HP lore. It's been some time since I last watched one of the movies and several years since I read the books.
I smile, deactivate the charm and continue to follow him. Let him have his moments with Shenan and I will wait patiently for the first words he will actually say to me. As long as he is making his progress. Andrea calls us into the middle a few minutes later and the session continues as usual, with the exception of Draco’s mumbled words to the mare later in the stable.
“Tilly already said she can’t – “ she starts but I don’t want to hear it now.
Focusing back on the task at hand, I reach down to his pants, the same dirty grey. Even though I am as careful as I can, he still flinches when it slips down his thighs, but then he goes slack, like he lost every last ounce of fight in him. I run shaking hands through his hair, an awful suspicion creeping up on me.
“Narzissa’s diary mentions that they had a cat at some point, but Lucius threw the animal out when Draco was five. They also had horses and he loves riding according to the diary,” she pauses, “But right now a big horse is more likely to freak him out than help him, but maybe once he is more responsive it might help him. You would have problems actually keeping horses of course, but there are therapies in the muggle world which work with horses. We could take him there at some point. And no one would recognise him in the muggle world either.”
At that I shake my head with a soft smile, “No, it’s fine,” I run fingers through Draco’s hair, “He’s been a big part of my life for as long as I have known of the wizarding world. I want to bring that part to rights and maybe then I can think of focusing on someone else.”
“Are you sure we’re not talking about you?” Blaise said coolly.
Harry was stunned.
Unlike Ron’s note, Harry didn’t recognize the handwriting at all. He set it asife and picked the fabric up from the floor. The fabric felt nice and he settled it across his shoulders. Hedwig hooted in alarm.
But, as Dudley loved to point out in front of his own friends, Harry hadn’t heard from anyone at Hogwarts all summer. The Dursley’s had all been treating him differently too. On one hand, they’d caved and given Harry Dudley’s other bedroom in fear that Harry’d squeal to some higher power in the Wizarding World they wouldn’t be able to sway. On the other, Uncle Vernon seemed to walk a fine line between exploding over every little thing Harry did and ignoring him completely. Dudley messed with him mercilessly in front of his friends and parents but avoided him when they were alone. Aunt Petunia was as snobbish as ever, but most days she could hardly stand to look at him. It made for a very lonely few months.
“It’s faster, more streamlined. I think it’s supposed to react to your movements better, too.” Her eyes were still on Harry’s fringe.
“That’s enough, Mr Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.” McGongall said sharply.
All in all, the week ended in a high note that got progressively better as Harry learned the layout of the castle and spent more time with Ron. That is, until they got to flying class.
Malfoy frowned, “What’s all this about? Why are you suddenly curious about Nicholas Flamel?”
“Dad said you’d gotten a warning from the ministry about underage magic,” Fred said, letting out a low whistle, “Harry, I didn’t take you for a criminal. Didn’t you get one of those fancy slips of paper last term?”
Blaise rolled his eyes but pulled his hangings closed and Draco finished pulling on his shoes.
Were they meant to re-evaluate in thirty days? If it wasn’t working out between them could they break it off sooner? Harry supposed that having a check-in once a month made for a healthy relationship. He wouldn’t really know, as he’d only dated Ginny and that hadn’t lasted long.
Draco gave him a tight smile. “Of course, seeing as his father is still in Azkaban.”
Ugh, as if everything wasn’t so fucking awkward between them before, Potter had to go throwing
“Is that… something you do often?” Potter stretched out his legs, crossing them at the ankle, in a pose of nonchalance. But there was careful intent in his tone.
A rush of relief and adrenaline flooded Harry. “Who said we’d even be inviting you over?”
For the first game, they each held a spoon in their mouths and used the spoon to scoop ping pong balls from one plate to another. The ridiculousness of it had them both laughing too hard to keep the spoons in place very well. Sadly, Harry managed to get all ten of his balls moved before Draco. With a smirk he demanded a piece of clothing. Draco peeled off a sock and threw it at him.
magic instead of his so I hover uselessly, tension creeping up my spine.
As he cast a sticking charm on the paper, Draco wondered what his father would say about the current state of his study. Annie plastered the drawing to the wall, amidst a host of other similar scribbles done by herself and several other children. Crayons, both magical and muggle, littered the floor right over the stain where Chester spilled grape juice on the rug. The House Elves hadn’t got to it in time to truly get the stain out.
“Sorry, shit, I’m so sorry, Draco! Here, let me -” Harry yanked Draco to his feet and turned him towards the water. “It’s all right. Sorry. Just… rinse it off, I’ll be right back.”
“Here? In the place where I work? Where someone could very easily walk in on us?”
As Draco drank the last of his tea, he thought about suggesting they head on to bed.
“There’s barely enough room for the two of us,” Harry huffed against Draco’s swollen lips as he nearly fell into the toilet. Again. Unfortunately the loo was the only part of the Hogwarts Express that didn’t have windows through which they might be seen.
“I love a creamy centre…” Draco whispered, before licking a dollop of cream off his own cream puff.
And of course, he did.
The next day, they paced in the courtyard, waiting for Narcissa Malfoy to make an appearance at the Hogwarts gates. Theo kept sighing and checking his pocket watch for the time. Harry and Draco circled one another and Harry kept offering words of encouragement.
“Well maybe,” I gasp, “just a little.”
Draco choked back a sob of relief. It would be all right. Somehow, Harry fucking Potter would fix everything. Little bastard. Draco didn’t know which he hated more in that moment—Harry Potter or the desperation with which he needed his help.
“I really want to kiss Malfoy right now,” Harry mumbled, and immediately realised what he’d said
Harry stayed up late that night reading the first book Draco gave him. At her second ball after her coming-out, the young, innocent Honourable Annabelle de Ros, only daughter of an impoverished baron, saved the older, jaded duke from a poisoned glass of wine, incurring a life debt. Harry was fuzzy on why the wine was poisoned in the first place and finally decided that no one cared, as the romantic softening of Charles’s heart during his thirty days of service to Annabelle seemed to be the point of the book.
“No, I only met him in Hogwarts for the first time,” I shrug, caught up in what I remember reading in Narzissa’s diary, “And by then he already went through enough to be bitter and a carbon copy of his father.”
“Draco!” I call, “You have to let me go! I need to sleep as well.”
That's it for today. Thanks for reading.
Thank you for the comments.
I chuckle, “Not at all,” I lay my head on my hands where they rest on the window frame, smiling at him, “I like it. I think it’s amazing how you care for the horses. It’s just…”
“Yes, good morning to you too. I am glad you are back. Do you want breakfast?”
thank you for the comments and kudos.
Warnings for panic attacks maybe?
I am dying of heat and so is my laptop. I hate summer.
When I return home it is to find Hermione feeding Draco some sort of soup in the living room. His eyes are as absent as usual and he only reacts slowly to the girl’s commands to open up and eat. But it’s better than nothing after all. When she hears the floo flare she looks up over the blonde’s head. She gives me a sad smile then lays the spoon down.
“No,” he answers to my surprise, “I am well aware of the consequences but that is something I will not allow.”
“Draco!” I repeat, reaching out a hand, “Draco, it’s just a dream. You have to wake up.”
Andrea and I make small talk while she leads Shenan around the hall. Hermione has left earlier this time. Draco is peaceful as always as long as he’s around horses, even urging Shenan to go faster at some point. It seems like she can’t decide whether to follow his commands or not. But neither Andrea nor I have been paying much attention and eventually the mare gives in and starts a slow trot. The therapist is surprised when the horse suddenly bypasses us, but immediately tries to reign it in again. Draco gives an annoyed sounds when Shenan slows down and the woman grins.
So yes, I will be continuing this series. It's not abandoned, I'm just not feeling great right now, so updates are a bit slow. I'm sorry.
The pain is back at being treated like that by you. What is wrong with me? Why am I reacting to you like that? Suddenly thoughts from when I was seeing you at the trials come back to me. Did I love you? Do I still? Is that why I feel envious of that girl? But I am married to Ginny, a woman. I am married to Ginny…
“That’s not a cane,” I says softly, waving my hand to wandlessly transport the umbrella to the next garbage bin, “It’s just a broken umbrella. And nobody is going to try to hit you with it. No one here will hurt you, I promise you.”
“You wanna talk about it?” I can’t help but ask (not that I would talk).
I shake my head, both to get some of the water off and to try to get those pictures out of my mind, not that that works. I doubt the look on Draco’s face and those screams are going to leave me any time soon. I cringe when I can’t help but wonder how much of what Voldemort said was true and what my mind just made up to torture me. I hope it was mostly the latter.
To my utter surprise and kind of relief the shock of losing his grip seems to have cleared his mind for a moment as in the middle of falling he curls himself in, protecting his head. He doesn’t manage to stop or avoid landing on the ground, but he does it as safely as possible without using any magic. I breathe out as I reach the fence, to see him sitting back upright again. He is covered in grass and scowling at the stains, but seems unharmed. Before I can say something though one of the two new horses noses at him. The dapple-grey mare pushes her snout into his neck, causing him to giggle.
“Or he is just too proud,” Ron snorts but I ignore him.
“He really takes well to the horses,” she nods, “That’s Shenan. She’s a twelve year old palomino mare. She should fit your description well.”
A frown crosses Draco’s face, “That was throughoutly checked when I was taken into custody. There is no need to prove it again.”
I apologize for the delay. Unfortunately now I'm out of written stuff, this is all I had on my computer. I know where I want to go with the story but to write it out, not to mention add filler, isn't as easy as it sounds.
So when the lessons end for the day and everybody hurries out of the hall to get home, I on the other hand walk down to our professor. He looks up when I stop next to his desk.
“He startles so easily these days and screams himself awake with nightmares every night. I don’t think that counts as progress,” I lay one of my arms over my face.
“Before we go down and talk, I want to do something,” she says softly, “We need Draco for that.” I frown but she smiles sadly and shakes her head, “Don’t worry, it won’t hurt him or anything.”
“Yeah, well,” my fingers start to fiddle with the books and papers in my hand, “I know someone who has gone through a heavy trauma. He is basically apathetic right now. I am trying to help him, but I am afraid that I don’t know enough to properly care for him,” I softly admit.
I wish you all luck and health in the current situation. Please stay healthy and safe.
“And even if I am. At least I am not sleeping with everything on two legs in the vicinity.”
“Thank you,” I say earnestly, but she just waves it off.
And indeed Draco has already managed over half of the distance. His steps are insecure and he has problems balancing himself, but he is doing it, in smaller steps than the usual human though. Four steps, five, six. With the seventh he reaches out his right hand to the wood and another move forward lands him against the other side of the hallway, where Shenan welcomes him by carefully nosing his cheek. He gives the light furred horse a smile despite the fact that his free hand is now clinging to the bars next to the horse’s window. He buries his face in the soft fur instead.
A minuscule furrow appears on his brow then he lifts his right hand again, the left laying still as always. Then he slowly taps his own chest. I frown confusedly as well.
Our luck holds until the next Thursday and the blonde is calm enough to go to horse therapy. Hermione has decided to accompany us this time just to be safe. Draco is more nervous than normal and tries to twitch away just before we apparate. At first he seems slow to calm down even with the smell of the stable surrounding him.
“No, never,” he agrees.
Hello everyone,
I waver for a moment, but then nod, “Yes, thank you. I just don’t think he will react well to strangers.”
“At least they are labelled,” I hear Draco mumble as he scans the names pinned to the wood stands under the horse gear.
“Can you stand up with me?” I ask, “Or do you want me to carry you?”
“It’s okay. I just want to clean you up. Calm down.”
But while I feel like I am floating on a cloud since I heard him speak for the first time, I can’t help but notice how my friend is watching him with worried eyes.
“I tried, but before the trials there was too much of a chaos and now… I asked, only to have them say that as the criminal he is I can’t be allowed to talk to him until he is in safe confinement.”
“You didn’t see him that evening. He could not kill Dumbledore. He could never kill anyone in cold blood. He may have done some awful things while under Voldemort’s reign but I believe that he would never do it on his own free will. Taunting, teasing, playing pranks and insulting or throwing punches, yes. But nothing that would warrant any worse punishment than social service. Like I said, I am aware he might have committed smaller crimes, but nothing that is enough for what he is suffering now. And the worse stuff he did was forced anyway, I saw that,” I rant.
“Naturally, that is a requirement if he wants to clear so much as some of his guilt,” he explains calmly, my anger rising further once again. When he starts again, my patience rips another time, “And now – “
I am just watching him when I notice the stable’s owner come towards us. To not disturb him, I distance myself from Draco a bit. The older man nods at me and holds out his hand when he reaches me.
“What is it, Ginny?” I sigh and turn around.
I apologize for the delay in posting.
“Your friend? No, not since the last time he was here with you,” she shakes her head, “Something wrong with him?” she asks as she hurries over to me.
“I will take him with me at Grimmauld place,” I answer with determination, “I know he will be in an awful state and we would be lucky if he could recognise his name so it would make no sense to make him live alone. Not to mention that Malfoy Manor was burned down. Believe me I am prepared.”
“I know,” I argue, frowning at her, “But his injuries can be healed. There are spells, potions or ointments that can even make his scars disappear,” I snatch the list from her hands, scanning over it, “I’m not a mind healer, but I am sure there are ways to heal him.”
He gives me a tired but happy smile which warms my chest. Immediately he shuffles over, pulling the sleepy cat with him. I move onto the bed, carefully gauging his reaction. But nothing more than a small increase in the tension in his body happens.
“Indeed we have apparently convicted an innocent. Someone who saved many people even.”
“I will make breakfast. Do you want anything special?” I chuckle.
“No we do not. However I have a very urgent request and the minister will see me anyway.”
“Maybe because I see a bit of myself in you,” I murmur, not wanting to reveal the real reason behind it, “A boy forced into his role and side of the war before he even understood what the war was about. I didn’t have any choice to be anything but the boy-who-lived and no one asked you whether you really wanted to be a Death Eater. Not to mention that neither of us had the nicest homelife.”
Breakfast passes in a comfortable atmosphere with Draco eating his little portion as every day and Hermione and me conversing about harmless topics. When I leave for my class I have a better feeling about leaving him in my friend’s care for a whole day than I did yesterday. As strange as it may sound at first, his childhood toy seems to anchor Draco and that is the most important thing we want for now. We can’t really help him if we can’t reach him because he has shut himself off.
“Draco?” I ask worriedly, hands stretching to stabilise him.
Hello everyone,
“Dra-Draco,” the blonde says carefully.
Anyway back to the main topic. You’re dead now. I honestly cried when I heard the news. I am sad, really sad. And I feel like I missed out on so many chances I could have had. I am standing here and watching your casket being lowered into the ground next to Lou’s. They said you died so early (for a wizard that is) because your body couldn’t deal with the remaining damage from torture from younger years anymore. Mostly your heart giving up from damage of too many Crucio curses.
“Are you married? Are you Orion’s mother?” you ask, turning to Lou.
“I don’t know. My guess is that it is self-inflicted,” I grumble out sadly.
