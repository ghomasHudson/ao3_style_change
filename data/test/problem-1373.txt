“I don't know, but my brothers have a band, that could be it,” Ginny suggests, and Philia starts to get more excited.
“As if your name is better, Ginny? What's that supposed to be? The name of a cat?” Philia watches Ginny from the corner of her eye as she chuckles.
“Come now,” Narcissa urges Draco and Philia. They follow their Mother and Father through the wall portal and the throg of more people on the other side surprises Philia. She doesn’t enjoy crowds, or people, she likes her own company because it is enough and it is quiet unless you count the things happening inside her head, “I’ll send you both owls when I get the chance, I hope you make Slytherin, Philia, please dont pull one of your little… tricks”
“I was trying to listen to songs that might motivate me to do this astrology stuff,” Ginny explains honesty, setting down her quill and taking out her headphones to hear better.
By the time Astrology comes around, Philia is actually looking forward to it. And it has nothing to do with the fact that Ginny is her partner and everything to do with the fact that it's her favourite subject. She swears…
The murmuring only gets louder when they hear Phlilia’s name, she grins slightly at the reaction it provokes as she takes her seat on the stool and the dirty old hat is placed on her head.
“Ngaw, I was looking forward to teasing you,” Philia pouts and pulls a face.
The boy looks taken aback rather than mad, his two friends don't seem impressed either, Philia decides to ignore them and look around her surroundings. The trio immerse into quiet conversation, laughing at intervals. Philia wouldn't admit to it, but it does make her the slightest bit self conscious.
The blonde aristocrat didn't need telling twice. Even when he got a little resistance from Harry it didn't last for long before the moans elicited from the younger man excited him even further. Harry had even started to shift about and unfastened the clasps of Draco's waistcoat and tugged his shirt out of his pressed trousers. Draco felt Harry's teeth grazing his skin and his answering arousal pressing up against Harry's thigh. He craned his neck back and shivered as the balmy air licked his exposed skin from where Harry had lifted his shirt up around his chest.
Blaise blinked in surprise at the words on the page. So Draco really had loved Potter all this time? And Scarhead had reciprocated? Apparently so, considering the state that Draco had arrived back to the dungeons in. Despite himself, he found himself smiling at the prospect of Draco finally satiated and above all things happy. He was still a little sceptical, however. The following morning at breakfast, when Draco and Harry walked in smiling like utter idiots and matching hickey's just barely visible over their collars -easily spotted when you knew what to look for -Blaise felt himself smirk into his cereal as he ducked his head down. Pansy and Theo hissed questions under their breath but when he was personally asked if he knew anything, he merely smiled smugly, relishing in the knowledge for a little while longer. Not only was it because finally, the sexual tension -for the most part -had been cut in half between the bespectacled git and his blonde roommate, but also because Blaise had actually been right all along.
Harry was fascinated as he looked at the puddle. How much had Draco been holding in? He didn’t know what to say. He just watched until Draco stopped peeing and cried.
They hadn’t seen each other in a year. The last time was when Harry spoke at Draco’s trial. Harry travelled the world after and Draco found a job in muggle London.
“Uh, are you alright Malfoy?”
Finally, the pee turned into a small trickle and then it stopped. Horrified Draco looked at the mess he made. He was wet, disgusting and ashamed. Fuck his small, weak bladder. Fuck this all.
“Oh?” Draco said. “Well, was it fun?” He tried to keep his attention on the conversation and not on the fact he was about to burst.
Draco’s crotch was now pressed against Harry’s leg. He couldn’t help but press himself tighter again’t the Gryffindor’s leg. He willed Harry’s leg to hold himself so no more pee could escape.
Malfoy didn’t respond, instead he kept kicking stones.
The old lady stood there for a little longer, watching him slowly get more uncomfortable. She then smiled at him.
Harry shrugged. “Perhaps we can talk some. I’m the only one here. We could talk about our year.”
He supposed he could just go behind a tree. But that was truly disgusting, wasn’t it? Besides, Harry would think that it is disgusting too. Draco wasn’t gonna risk that after just being friends for half an hour.
Harry smirked. “Wanna go on a date? Meet me friday at 6 in the evening here.”
Harry and Draco were currently on their way to the forest. Snape told them that they need to collect ingredients for potions. They got a whole list and they could only leave once they got everything on the list.
Draco interrups him panicked. “I can’t hold it anymore, please!”
Draco smiled a little, relieved at how nice Harry was being. Draco followed Harry to Hagrid’s hut. Harry opened the door and led Draco towards the shower.
Harry and Draco were currently sitting on the couch, watching
Draco bounced up and down. He couldn’t hold much longer. He needed to pee so badly. He was going to pee himself.
“Potter.”
Harry grinned and cradled Draco closer to him. “Hey silly, accidents happen. You don’t have to thank me for being nice. I need to thank you for being freaking awesome.”
Harry stared as his boyfriend had an accident. Secretly, he found it a little hot. His boyfriend squirming and then having a full blown accident. It didn’t disgust Harry, it only turned him on.
Harry laughed. “Don’t be ridiculous. You and your dad worship each other.”
Malfoy chuckled awkwardly. “I don’t know why I said all of that. I guess I just wanted you to know but I didn’t know how. You can’t tell anyone this though!”
Oh fucking shit, Harry
But Draco couldn’t. He had to go so freaking badly and there was no way he would make it all the way to the castle.
Draco murmers something but Harry can barely make it out. He does hear things like ‘sorry’ and ‘harry.’ That is until he hears one heartbreaking sentence: “don’t break up with me.”
“I can’t! H-harry! I need to go so b-badly! I can’t hold it anymore. Oh merlin! I- I am gonna wet myself. Fuck... c-can’t hold it,” Draco begs. He feels more pee coming out. It is soaking his boxers and soon it will go right through his pants.
“Yeah, but you need the bathroom badly so lets just go, okay?”
“Shhh... dragon. Don’t cry. It is okay... nothing wrong,” Harry desperately tries to soothe Draco while rubbing his back.
He quickly grabbed himself while performing a little pee dance. Shit shit shit... he needed to go so bad.
When Harry came again his desperation just grew ten times and Draco didn’t know how long he could hold it anymore.
“I did make it,” he said stubbornly. “Now can we please stop talking about being desperate?” He moaned.
Draco shots the bathroom a longing look and then slowly puts off his trousers, pee dancing in place. He needs to pee so badly that he isn’t sure if he will even make it at this point. A sharp urge makes him reach out to grab himself with two hands. He feels his hands getting slightly wet and he knows that he just leaked. Harry is still looking at him with an expecting look. Finally, Draco gets his trousers off. There is a small wet spot clearly visible on his green boxers of where he just leaked.
Harry feels so guilty. It wrecks his heart to see his boyfriend like that. Quickly, he gently grabs the blonde’s arm. He pulls him away from the puddle of pee and then takes him into his arms, not caring if pee will get on him.
He was halfway when another bad urge got him sagging to his knees with the effort of not peeing. Unfortunately he leaked large. The front of his pants were completely soaked through.
Draco was studying in his own room. All the eight years had gotten their own rooms in a mutual common room. McGonagall had decided that they deserved some privacy, especially since some of them were eighteen now.
Harry’s clothes were too big on Draco’s small figure. He basically drowned in the soft material of the black sweater. Draco didn’t mind. It smelt like Harry and Harry smelled nice and safe.
Harry smiled at Mal.. Draco. “I won’t say a word. Thanks for trusting me, Draco. I really respect you and your mom for that. It is truly amazing.”
Malfoy took the paper and shoved it in his pocket. He still gave no response.
The next 45 minutes passed without incidents which Draco was really grateful for.
Harry just smiled at him. “You’ll be fine. Besides, that is a lie. I saw you flying on the pitch once at night. You probably thought you were alone but I was taking a night walk. Anyways, it looked like you were desperate for a piss then too. I saw you rushing to the quidditch changing rooms because of the bathroom there. You did make it right?”
“Oh merlin, I’m wetting. C-can’t stop it...” he cries. He has now started to pee fully. A hissing sound is clearly heard as the pee goes right through his pants, forming a puddle on the ground. He feels slightly light-headed from the long awaitened relief.
Draco looks at the wet spot and then panicked at the bathroom and Harry. He knows that he’ll lose it any second now. He totally ignores Harry asking for the dishes. He needs to get to the bathroom and NOW.
“He would fucking what?”
Harry chuckled and looked at what Draco was doing. He was collecting poppy seeds. Draco’s position was rather uncomfortable. He kept shifting and changing his position. Was he in pain?
“Completely sure! Now hurry!” Harry said.
But it wasn’t that bad yet. Surely he could hold it in. Draco grabbed his water bottle and drank some. It was surprisingly hot for March so he drank a lot, not wanting to dehydrate.
Draco nodded, embarrassed that she had seen his little dance. He really needed to be more subtle. He quickly uncrossed his legs, trying not to wince at the growing urge.
Potter shrugged off his robe and unwound his tie and started unfastening his buttons. Draco mirrored his movements, his belt clinking as he shucked his trousers off and stepped out of them, his hard-on pressing up through his silk boxers. Potter licked his lips as he stepped nearer and hummed, "If you want to learn to speak troll I can make you grunt all night long."
It wasn't too long before rumors started circulating, and it certainly didn't help what they were actually
"Mmm yes, love?"
He was a coward and he knew it.
"Next time we do it this way -I'm topping."
"Lucky Draco," Harry rasped, still staring up at the ceiling, his jaw clenching a little at the mention of the blonde man.
He drew a deep breath and then stood up to walk out of his room.
"Don't do what?"
Regardless, he knew that something needed to be done. He also knew that it was going to create a tidal wave of back lash if they were going to be successful. The other question, when it came down to it, was what exactly could be done that would be so subtle to actually work for Draco and Potter?
Draco held up Harry's jacket in his hands, "come on, love, lets go for a walk along the beach."
It was the middle of July things still hadn't improved too greatly between Harry and Draco. Their business still flourished and they got a lot of people coming in every day for top-ups of to see if Harry would sign an autograph for a young child, but due to his hectic work schedule, which Draco was starting to think was more self-imposed than Harry let on, wouldn't allow him to be at the shop too often. The only downside to whatever was bothering Harry was that it was beginning to show to those who were often around them, like Draco's parents and Severus. They had been discreet about it, asking Draco when Harry wasn't in the immediate vicinity on one of their trips into Paris from an afternoon away from the apothecary and work. For his part, Draco didn't have much on the tale to tell, however what he did say seemed to have caused a frown to appear on Severus' usually expressionless face. This worried him a great deal but he pushed it to the back of his mind.
Glancing over his shoulder as he circled back and retreated from the courtyard, he smirked even wider as he saw the dumbstruck look on Potter's face. He was almost out of ear shot when he heard a shocked, "What the Hell Malfoy?" with footsteps hurrying to catch up with him. Taking a sharp detour Draco managed to avoid Potter catching up with him. He watched from the alcove as he saw Potter turn left and right, looking for him and upon seeing no one, hissing out in frustration and actually stamping his foot!
Harry narrowed his eyes a little and found himself straightening up to his fall height which still onto put him eye level with Draco's pointed chin, "Mister Malfoy the world of healing potions in changing as we speak. Every day more people are finding new uses for various ingredients and making more and more cures, and you are standing there in all your finery as though you have given up and are just waiting for the right time to die!" he hissed out the last part out, not wanting to draw attention to the both of them.
Draco stopped abruptly, tugging Harry to a halt beside him. "No," he breathed, his expression stern. "You are not allowed to think like that. Let's just -enjoy the evening alright?"
Draco immediately felt his cheeks flush pink. He was getting far too hot despite the Entrance Hall almost being completely deserted at this point. He straightened up a little more and looked down at Harry, "Er well I don't know -Would you want it to be a date?"
Blaise frowned as he glanced over at Potter who was looking as normal as he possibly could over on the Gryffindor table. He didn't look embarrassed or that he was trying to hide something. There had been no declarations of love or Draco walking around wrapping in Potter's duvet just 'to feel closer to him'. He leaned a little closer towards his friend and murmured, "Let's give it a couple of days. He might want to do something ridiculous over breakfast. You know how he's an early riser."
Harry soaked up all of the information but it was too much too soon. He couldn't full digest it. He shook his head weakly from side-to-side, not because he was disagreeing, but because it was too many scenarios and consequences tossing and twirling in his mind for him to think straight. Finally his head lulled onto his shoulder and licked his lips, "Can I see him?" he whispered, so afraid of the answer was he that he almost hoped Severus didn't hear him.
Draco nodded with a lazy smile playing on his lips as his head lulled against the headboard, "I always seem to forget how amazing it feels to have you inside me."
There was a moment of silence before Severus spoke up, "He was taken to St. Michaels in Paris. It was touch and go for a little while and his heart stopped twice but he managed to choke up half the lake and according to the letter we received this morning, he is now stabilized and eating a little."
Harry took a deep breath and decided to hedge around the subject. "It's just, since we all practically stared Death in the face, doing something as tedious as exams and looking for a job seem -well -so mundane and ordinary that I just want to scream if someone mentions them again."
It took a while before the murmurings of the hall came back however it was still tense, only really broken by the abrupt departure of a certain red-haired girl with tear stained cheeks.
The voile curtains were drawn across the tall windows, letting in a strained orange glow of the sunset into the room. It tinted everything with a burning glow that left him breathless as he deflated and leaned back against the door, clicking it shut behind him. Draco didn't shift or stir in his sleep. Taking the small salve from the bedside table he knelt down on Draco's mattress, feeling it sink underneath him, before he unfastened the ties of Draco's nightshirt and splayed them out, exposing the pale smooth skin. He swallowed thickly, feeling his body temperature rise up as he daubed his fingers with the yellow salve and started to rub it in soothing circles over Draco's chest. Almost immediately he could detect a change in the older man's breathing. As soon as the salve had soaked through into his chest cavity, Harry drew his wand out and performed another diagnostic spell to determine if Draco had caught the onset of a cold or a brand new fever. Thankfully both the tests were negative and he left out a soft sigh. He turned to place his wand and the salve on the bedside table and froze when he turned back around.
Draco squeezed the cool fingers in his palm, "He missed you too. In fact, just last night he brought this over to me," from the deep pocket of his hoodie he drew out the tattered book. He slid it onto Harry's lap and watched as weak fingers ran over the familiar cover. "I think he wanted you to have it -in case you got bored."
By the time they were exhausted enough and lying in a tangled heap on a pile of their clothes, the flagstones burning with their body heat, and lying with Harry's head against Draco's shoulder. They were both breathing deeply and both completely mind-blown. The clock chiming eleven at night, Harry let out a soft groan and rolled over so that his forehead was pressed against Draco's flushed skin, "I don't really want to leave. Not after that. I'm dreading tomorrow now."
Draco almost snorted. Almost. He slipped his hand around Potter's throat and gripped him tightly. "Maybe I'll check that for myself," he growled as he forced his hand down the front of Potter's jeans, making the younger boy gasp and jerk. It was too late. There was nowhere for him to recoil to, so he he was practically trapped as Draco's long, cool fingers wrapped around his cock and started to tug.
Harry nodded, "You have no idea how much I appreciate this Professor, this is such an amazing chance for me!"
She shared a knowing glance with Blaise when Draco was predictably paired up with Potter. She slipped out of her desk to join Granger, with a note passed over to Blaise declaring that they needed to meet in the classroom again after curfew. He nodded silently as he moved next to Longbottom.
Every grunted word made Harry shiver as he felt himself harden a little through his trousers. He could distinctly see Draco's own arousal highlighted by the flickering flames dancing in the grate. He reached down with his quaking fingers, and –feeling brave –traced a line up the length of Draco's cock through his trousers and suppressed a smile as Draco hissed through his teeth and tilted his head back, exposing his beautiful white throat. "Do you like it when I touch you?" he murmured as he splayed his fingers around the thick length, feeling his stomach knot when he felt the hot, thick heat twitch under his palm.
"Please don't say that!" Harry gasped out as he squeezed his eyes shut, "I don't want to be categorized like that! I can't have depression, Severus. If I do then that just means I've been hurting more people than saving them!"
Draco nodded his head and edged into the room and settled himself on the edge of Harry's bed, his head bowed to the floor and his knobbly knees poking out from the hem of his nightshirt, "He does but I don't think he'll miss me right now," he murmured as he peered up through his fringe at Harry, "Besides, I don't plan on staying too long." His voice had a tight edge to it, as though it was taking all of his self-restraint to keeping his voice steady. "I just came here to ask you something."
"We should go over there," Pansy murmured, nudging Blaise under the table.
"No!" Harry snapped up and then groaned in agony against Draco's shoulder at the white hot pain that ripped through him. Blindly, he reached over to the bedside table to swipe a dab of healing salve on his fingers and used it to smear on his rectum. Once the pain had dissipated, he settled down beside Draco and looked at with firm eyes, "Don't say any of that. Not now and definitely not yet. This is going to take some time to get used to. Just … Can we at least get used to it first?" he almost pleaded with the blonde.
Draco kept his eyes locked with Harry's letting his hands wander freely, touching as much of exposed skin on Harry's chest as he could reach. He watched as Harry's breathing grew heavy and uneven, heaving underneath the palm of his hand. He felt so beautifully warm. He leaned up a little in his bed and winced as Harry shifted away, almost out of reach. Thrusting his arm forward he snatched at the back of Harry's nightshirt and drew him back down, his legs slipping in between Harry's through the bed sheets. A shiver ran through the brunettes muscles, making Draco ache to wrap his arms around the younger man. "Kiss me," he panted heavily, feeling his stomach knotting in the fear that Harry would bolt out of his room, and out of his life.
The dog whined lightly before removing himself from Draco's sprawled body and over to Harry, tail wagging, and waiting obediently for his lead to be strapped back onto his collar. "Oh yeah, he sits for you, but when it's me he enjoys breaking my back," Draco grumbled as he gently eased himself back onto his feet and dusted the wet clumps of sand that were clinging onto him.
All too soon the clock on the mantelpiece of Draco's fireplace chimed that it was midnight and Draco inwardly groaned before forcing himself up onto his legs, the effects of the potions weakening a little as he staggered over to the large bed that accepted his weight. The cotton sheets felt heavier on his skin but his temperature didn't flare up like it had every other night. He felt good as he was fed a potion to help combat his temperature, whilst a cooling charm was cast over his sheets. Harry smiled at him and brushed the blonde man's fringe aside, "Sleep tight Draco. I'll see you in the morning."
It was nice that the Room was slowly regaining it's previous powers.
They both sighed and took their time standing up and leaving the Room, the door disappearing as the door clicked shut behind them. As they came to a stop at the staircase, Draco turned to him and smiled softly, "I guess I'll see you on Saturday then?"
Harry shrugged. "That's just how sex is meant to be, I guess. Natural."
He hadn't screwed up the fucking potion.
"What's that?"
Harry's breath hitched when the blonde turned to face him, his face half-cast in shadow by the fire crackling in the grate. "I can try and help, if you're willing to accept it this time," his voice held a tight strain of challenge to it, but for the most part he was anxious to know how he could help the blonde.
Harry smiled and wriggled over slightly, his wide emerald eyes watching as Draco moved himself around the bed and placed the laptop beside his pillow. He unzipped the hoodie, feeling in no need to rush, and slid out of it, allowing the warm bulk to cascade to the carpet beneath his feet. He then unbuckled his belt and unfastened his jeans. Stepping out of the heavy pool of fabric clutching around his feet, he sat on the edge of the bed in only his boxer shorts and his warm socks. His skin felt a little warm to the touch but a shiver was easily detectable as it ran through his aching muscles. "Wear the hoodie," came a small voice from behind him. He glanced over his shoulder at Harry who had the covers tucked under his chin; his glasses making his wide green eyes seem brighter.
A smile curved onto his mouth as he bent over to retrieve the hoodie from the floor, quickly slipping into the Luke warm fabric and zipping it up at the front. Satisfied, he drew back the covers and slid beneath them, propping the laptop on his lap once we had settled up against the pillows. As the laptop loaded, Harry wriggled over to Draco's side of the bed and rested his head on Draco's chest with a hum of contentment. It made him smile. He made quick work of logging on to the internet -he adored Harry for showing him all about Muggle technology -and was quick to locate a decently priced hotel in -
He gasped when he saw the room. He didn't know what he had been expecting but whatever that illusion had been was now shattered; the walls had been charred down to their bare stone and despite the sheer size of the room, there was nothing comely or homey about it anymore. Most of the stone had scorch marks on it and there was barely any light except for the faint light coming from a fireplace off on one wall that spluttered out a feeble aura of warmth. He cast his eyes around the room, his breathing harsh to his own eyes until they landed on the dull blonde hair of Draco Malfoy's bent head. Despite expecting to see the blonde his breath still caught in his throat and he hesitated, not knowing what to do.
"Draco please …" Harry begged. He wasn't sure if he was begging for more or begging for Draco to stop.
Harry decided that was about as good as he was going to get for that morning, so he slipped out one of his first ever medical journals to study, flipped it open on his lap, and started to read.
Draco smiled and placed a kiss on Harry's forehead as he went about booking the hotel, "I think some sun and sand will do everyone a great deal of good."
Deciding that he was thinking too much, Draco marched out along the hallway and smirked at the look of surprise and anger on Potter's face. Before the brunette could even open his mouth, Draco had pressed him up against the wall and grabbed at his crotch through the loose bottoms. "Is that a wand in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?" he growled low in his throat, delighting in the heat he felt in his palm.
Draco swallowed. This wasn't going the way he'd planned. He cleared his throat and drew in a few deep breaths to calm his rattling nerves. "Let's try this again, shall we?" he stated in a tight voice, "Pot -
Draco dipped his head up and down between Harry's legs over and over, taking his lover in as deep as he could without gagging too much. He squeezed Harry's buttocks as he sucked on his head and made the younger man moan and arch into his touch. As much as he didn't mind letting Harry lead on rare occasions, he still needed to have a little control to savour. He felt himself growing harder at the mere thought of what Harry had yet to do to him.
Five little photo's stared up at him; the first one was of him with Harry's arms around his neck, the second was of his kissing a blushing Harry's cheeks. The third one had a small Seeker's ears hopping up in the side of the frame; the fourth had Seeker leaping onto their laps, tail wiggling. And the fifth was a close-up of Seeker admiring the enclosed camera lens.
The screech of the train against the rails echoed through the glass windows and grated on Harry's frail nerves. It had been a long weekend. He had gone to see Severus at the hospital with a package he'd packed of stronger salves that healed deep wounds a lot quicker with a sedative laced into it, in case there was any pain left behind, there were new potions for the consumption disease that was miles ahead of the ones the muggles had created, and they had managed to save numerous people. His name had been in the papers for a good few weeks after they'd created the stronger potion as the morality rate of the wizarding community had drastically improved in the last five years since Harry had passed his exams. Draco's own health seemed to be less of a burden on both of their minds although it was a constant black shadow that followed Harry around, dogging his steps and taunting him during the long nights down in the potions lab in the back room. When the weather started to get like how it was now, it would be like old people with arthritis; harder to move and harder to breathe; increase irritability and lack of energy. Harry did his best to make the blonde man as comfortable as possible, but sometimes he felt as though he was losing his firm hold on the life around him.
Harry himself, the shame and fear and everything else he had kept bottled up for over a year whilst he lived in the manor with Voldemort came lashing out, tearing Harry's skin apart and letting his own blood stain the flagstones.
Cocking a black eyebrow, Harry turned to look at the blonde in the dimming light. "Oh really? And how are you getting p-?" He didn't get to finish his sentence as Draco leaned over and stole a chaste kiss that took Harry my surprised and left him a little breathless. "Right um ... I think I'll have to pay that installments. Wouldn't want chapped lips now."
“Oh well, it was worth the try,” Ginny says, picking her quill back up and going back to her parchment, a signal that their conversation is ending. After a long pause, Philia speaks up.
“Oh yes it did!” Philia lies, keeping her face innocent and mediocre, “It was a little confused at the start, but then it chose correctly” Philia smirks, that was less of a lie. Dumbledore doesn't look amused.
"Not to lowly for you?" Harry quipped a little tightly.
"The one to your heart."
"You too, Malfoy."
He hesitated, looking down at him. "What is it?" he asked.
"For fucking spying on me and making me your little charity case!" Draco sneered back.
As they sat in their Divination lesson, he discreetly tore out a page from his notebook and carefully wrote a message to Potter. He folded the paper into a little crane and spelled it to fly over the heads of his classmates. He watched as Potter jolted out of his bored, slumped state and carefully unfolded the crane under the table, despite Weasley being practically past out on his textbook.
Draco smirked, peering over his shoulder. Two bright green eyes teased him from under a black wind-swept fringe. "You're not bad," he smirked. "You're just lazy." A firm hand smacked his backside. He leaned down and pressed a chaste kiss to Harry's mouth. "Now, are you going to let me get out of these stiff clothes and into something more comfortable?"
Draco shook his head, "Well we both know someone who pretty much survived a life like that. Severus pretty much lost all he had to live for when he was just a few years older than us. I mean sure he was only thirty-eight when he was killed, but he still lived almost twenty years just stewing in his own rage, hatred and pain. I'm not saying it's an ideal life, but you can still ... live."
December descended cold and brittle over the castle and cast a blanket of frost over everything beneath it. Draco spent most of his time indoors, looking out over the white world and wishing so badly that he really could turn into the 'ice prince of Slytherin' just so that he didn't have to feel the gnawing hatred from everyone, students and teachers alike, as they passed him by in the corridors or during classes -sometimes even during meals in the Great Hall. Ice would suit him perfectly, he wouldn't need to feel emotions or pain or the after-effects of curses and jinxes.
Harry helped to wriggle out of his all-in-one before Draco opened his arms out for Harry to stand up in to them. Weaving his shaking arms around Draco's neck, Harry squeaked slightly as two muscular arms enveloped him and cradled him to a lithe, toned chest -when had Draco gotten so muscular? Harry suddenly felt a heavy weight in his chest at how much he must have missed whilst incarcerated in St. Mungo's. He shuddered violently as Draco eased his body, legs first, into the bathtub that was three-quarters full of hot water and apple scented bubble bath. The water lapped softly at his skin and seeped over the puncture holes the needles had made all over his skin. He hummed softly in contentment as his bony shoulders sank underneath the water, the steam creating a sheen of condensation over his pink cheeks and nose.
"Potter!" he called out in a controlled voice, barely audible over the din of students returning to their dorms. He cursed his insecurities as he reached out and snagged the sleeve of Harry's robe and yanked, "Potter!"
Harry's eyes darted to the envelope as though it were a poisonous snake, "What's inside it?" he whispered through trembling lips, tears gleaming on his thick black eyelashes.
Draco smiled as Harry squeezed his hand. The sky was a pale grey and rather bleak compared to the bright sunshine they had been experiencing recently. However, the breeze was soft, cool and welcome, and the clouds in the sky meant that Harry did not have to wear his cotton skull-cap until about lunchtime. Draco had stuffed it into his pocket regardless.
"Oh, I have. But I'm trying out that thing you've been telling me to do."
He poured some more apple scented bubble bath into his hands before shifting around the tub and slipping his hands under the warm water so as to massage Harry's shoulders. The feel of bones bursting against the stretched skin made Draco feel physically sick -what had they been doing to Harry in there? His stomach churned uncomfortably as he watched Harry slide his hands over the slippery bubbles, and blow a handful into the air -like a little soap-covered child.
Draco ground his teeth together and slowly moved himself back before sliding in again. He slowly started to thrust his hips in a slow rhythm. Harry's panting spurred him on as he quickened his pace, pleasure pooling in his stomach. It was blinding him. He wasn't going to last long but he didn't give a shit. He tried to calm his erratic thoughts to last a little longer. He rocked his hips even faster. "Harry!" he groaned out as the brunette moaned and arched into his thrusts, making them both spasm with pleasure. "Shit, I don't think I'm going to last long," he panted as he leaned over his lover, both of them glistening with sweat as they rocked together. He inhaled Harry's musky scent and pressed burning, sloppy kisses to the other's damp neck and forehead. "Ah, I love you! I fucking love you!"
"Easy for you to say," Draco grumbled as he forced his fists to unfurl at his sides, focusing instead of the way the candlelight danced in Harry's eyes as he watched him before he trailed his wet tongue down Draco's stomach, over the length of his cock and then back down between his buttocks. Another smirk from Harry as he teased Draco's entrance with his tongue, slipping it in and out slowly and making the blonde man squirm. He let out soft panting breaths as Harry slicked a finger and slowly pressed it inside the ring of hot, tight muscle. "Ahhh …" he whimpered out as he felt the digit slowly ease in and out of him at an agonizingly slow pace.
"Well if we're going to get technical about this sort of thing, I do own at least half of it, maybe even a little more," stated the other man as he ruffled his hair.
"H-Harry?" he asked praying to Merlin that he wasn't suffering from delirium again. He didn't need that again. He tossed his head from side-to-side and groaned and honestly didn't need his mind playing tricks on him again. "If you're not real please get out of my sight. I'm in no mood for this idiocy today!" he snapped knowing full well that any figment of his imagination would simply stay to antagonize him.
"Well, because why would anyone
Thankfully, that was a niche that Draco could excel in even in his sleep; six months before they had opened for business they had held a function in a nearby hotel to show their potential business partners that they were serious. It didn't take all that long to convince them to continue signing on and delivering their stock and trades to their apothecary. Draco had even managed to get a couple new accounts for private buyers, which would allow their prestige to grow at a rapid rate. And it had. Harry couldn't thank Draco enough for that.
do. Despite not wanting to be presumptuous he really wanted to see if there was anything more between them. Or if, perhaps, there could be.
For his part Harry tried to keep himself as busy as possible, his heart racing at the most menial of tasks and earning peculiar glances from Ronald and Dennis as he raced through each of the wards appointing new medicines and salves for severe curse burns and helping to ease some of the rambling patients in the spell-damage ward to quieten down and wash them manually. Some of the nurses tended to be lazy and scourgify them, but Harry found that that left them irritable and the skin became raw and red, almost like a rash. Harry didn't mind doing a few things manually. It was just the way that some people forgot that some hands-on things would work wonders if they were to lose their wands, which happened more often than not.
Severus inclined his head, "I know that it isn't easy, Harry. And yes, in some cases you may have done more harm than good but as far as I've seen in your records –yes, I've been checking up on you –but so far the only thing that has happened that may come back to haunt you is that you used scourgify on a couple of beds giving a large number of patients a rash, that you then later helped to cure with a strong dosage of your salve so … No, somehow you've managed to stay on top of most things. How you're managing that I'm not sure, but I think you're going to snap soon Harry. I don't know when, and I don't know how. But it will be soon, and you need to be careful. That's why I wanted you to come here for the two weeks. I want you to talk to me, or Draco, or someone. Come to me and talk if you're feeling scared, because I can see it in your eyes, Harry. I know you're scared." He leaned forward in his chair and bore his eyes into Harry, "Let me help you, Harry. I've been helping Draco and he's working through some things. Your negligence of his affections and even simply his attention and general conversation almost tipped him over the edge into depression, but I managed to get to him in time."
.' The words faded and then reappeared, much like the last one, '
Draco smoothed his sweaty palm on the thighs of his trousers. There was always something about the glint in Harry's wickedly green eyes that made him nervous. "I was thinking about it and thought that maybe a puppy would be more -appropriate."
He had to wait in the drizzling rain for almost forty minutes by the time his delayed train pulled into the station. He was sure that his ticket had gotten soggy in his cloak pocket but he couldn't bring himself to care as he tucked himself into a seat, draped his soaked cloak over the chair opposite and pulled his satchel up onto his knees. He smoothed the pads of his thumbs over the locks, as though taking his time would lessen the low of what the letters had to offer him. He was half hoping that when he pulled the front flap up that they would have disappeared, leaving no trace for him to read. '
Draco sat up fully and threaded both of his hands through the soft black hair, gripping Harry's face between his hands and staring fully into his eyes, both of their breathing hushed and laboured between them. The weight of the younger man in his lap made every muscle inside him ache and burn. "I said that I want you to kiss me," he panted.
"Oh, you're apprenticing underneath Snape?" Draco's voice held a note of interest and approval for which something warm swelled within Harry's chest. "Oh, he is certainly a great teacher you should learn a lot from here I dare say." He sipped from his flute.
He had not expected to be awoken to the blinding red lights filtering in through the living room window.
Draco grinned too, finally glad that he was able to make Harry smile. He poked his lover's side gently, earning a squirm from Harry. "I am not afraid to tickle you, Scarhead, so watch it."
"You must be young Mister Potter?" a petite maid curtsied to him and he felt a flush creep up his neck as his travelling cloak was taken from him by another maid. "Do come in. Lord Malfoy and young Master Malfoy are in the drawing room. If you would follow me, I'll take you to them."
As soon as the dessert dishes vanished from the tables and all the students were sufficiently full up, Draco felt sweaty and nervous, his ice cream sloshing around in his stomach making him feel ill, as he kept his eyes trained on the messy black hair two tables over. His throat felt thick and he could feel the hairs on the back of his neck stand up on it. This was it. He needed to make his move. Just as he was moving towards the doors, he milled into the crowd and felt others bump into his back as he craned his neck to look for Harry. He reached out, his fingers ready to snag the sleeve of the younger boy as soon as he got the chance.
"Draco can you promise me something?" Harry asked in a soft voice, his green eyes glittering. Draco felt dread flood his stomach but instead of biting Harry's head off that he didn't want to hear any of it, he swallowed thickly and nodded his head for Harry to continue. "Promise me that -if you give all this another go -that you'll be ready for anything; for a puppy or random holidays to Blackpool," he chuckled weakly, "and maybe children if it gets really serious."
Harry rubbed at the back of his neck and frowned, "Well yes that was the plan, but I cannot go to dinner looking like this. I won't look nearly formal enough in front of all of your fathers associates."
Harry smirked, "Wow. I don't know what's gotten into you recently, but you're being so affectionate right now." He leaned in, pressing himself against Draco's slick cock. He rubbed himself against the blonde, "You're so sexy, Draco. And I really do love you. I've wanted to tell you for a long time, but I didn't know if you felt the same." He ducked his head shyly.
had won? I've never wanted to be killed as much as I did in that moment."
Draco could feel his nose and eyes burning, the tears sticking to his lashes. Tremors were clawing at his body at the thought of having a wonderful future -with another man that was not Harry. No matter how close they grew, he would not be Harry. There was only one Harry. He sniffed loudly and wiped the cuff of his hoodie against his nose and eyes, trying to rid the hot tears now streaming down his cheeks. Through the blurred world of his tears Draco felt two thin arms wrap around him and curl him over against a weak chest. Thin fingers combed through his hair in a soothing manner. "Don't cry baby -I don't want to see you cry," came Harry's soft voice as his cool cheek was pressed against Draco's burning forehead. "Shh baby come on don't cry," the rocking motion was soothing but still Draco finally felt as though he had been torn from a very comfortable place.
“Sorry... I-I can’t hold it anymore. I need to pee so badly Harry!!!” With that, he shoved his hands in his crotch, dancing in place.
He was interrupted by Harry kissing him again. Harry grabbed Draco’s hands and put them around Harry’s neck. Harry then wrapped his own arms around Draco’s waist.
Draco shook his head. “Fine. I’m just tired. Can we hurry up a bit?” He said uncomfortably.
Draco was crying.
Draco flushed red. “I don’t need to go to the bathroom. Please, lets just hurry and...”
“Take off your trousers.”
Harry felt happy as he collected some leaves. It had been over an hour since Harry and Draco became friends and Harry already knew they were gonna become great friends. He smiled as he finished the leaves.
Draco on the other hand felt very ashamed. He didn’t dare to look at Harry. The relief was overwhelming, but so was the shame. Tears streamed down his face. His boyfriend was gonna think he was disgusting.
Draco knew he had no other choice. Either the tree or his pants would go wet and he would prefer have it be the tree. He nodded to Harry and started making his way towards the tree.
“Not without me,” Harry smiled as he lay beside Draco. “Are you feeling better?”
Draco looked at him, still holding himself tightly. There was no point in denying it. He was bursting.
“We should go before Hagrid comes back..,” Harry mumbled. Draco nodded and picked up his wet clothes that still lay in the bathroom.
But Draco doesn’t always have good luck.
“Dragon, I would never break up with you. I should have just let you go to the bathroom. It is my fault. A-and, I didn’t mean the harsh things I said. Merlin, I’I’m sorry. Draco, please forgive me,” Harry says. He feels Draco calming down, his sobs turning to sniffles.
Harry shook his head. “You can hold it!” He said. “Really Draco, just a little wait!”
Draco turned around and smiled a little. “Good job!”
“Oh yes, I absolutely think that..,” Harry moved closer and now they were only a few inches apart.
Finally, he finished his book. He closed it and put it on top of his other work. He sighed happily because he could finally hop to the small bathroom attached to his room and relief himself.
Draco was at his limit. He felt more pee coming out. Soon it will become a wet spot, he was sure of that. Since his arms were around Harry’s neck, he couldn’t hold himself. But then Harry put his leg between Draco’s.
“Yes...” Draco replied slowly, stepping from foot to foot. He felt so embarrassed but he needed to do this if he didn’t want to wet himself and thereby his work clothes.
“Keep my father out of this! If he finds out about this he would fucking...” Malfoy stopped his sentence.
“Eager for it, aren’t we?” Harry grinned, totally thinking that Draco did this out of being horny instead of absolutely desperate to pee.
He can’t hold it anymore. Even if Harry would let him go, he would pee himself. There is no way he can make it now. It is pressing on him and he needs to go so badly. Tears silently fall down as he still somehow tries to hold on.
“Yes, that will work. Thank you so much, Harry,” Draco said as he smiled at Harry. He then disappeared into the bathroom, not wanting Harry to see him in wet clothes much longer.
Draco bounced on his feet as he was somehow still holding. It hurted like crazy. Merlin, he wished the world would just disappear right here and now.
“Draco you are about to wet yourself! I’m not blind!”
Which was even worse was that he started to feel the signs of his bladder. He hadn’t used the bathroom since he left to work this morning. The tea he drank really started to form a problem.
“But we aren’t done yet!” Draco said. His hand were on his knees now. Obviously he didn’t want to hold himself in front of Harry but he probably really needed to. His thighs were squeezed together and his face was focused on trying not to pee himself.
“Harry...” Draco whispered. “I’m going to pee myself. Can’t hold it...”
Except there was a small line. Draco wiggled around, hoping the people would hurry. He wanted to ask if he could skip the line but the man in front of him seemed desperate too.
“Mhmmm... goodnight Harry.”
Draco sighs as he hops from foot to foot impatiently. He really has to go badly. He has never needed to pee that badly before in his life. He always holds throughout movie nights, but never did he drink this much.
He wriggled again but it just wasn’t enough. He looked behind him and saw Harry picking berries. Draco smiled a bit, Harry wasn’t looking. Quickly, Draco grabbed his crotch and held himself tightly. He couldn’t help but squeeze in absolute desperation.
He squirmed slightly in his seat. He needed to pee for almost two hours already and it was only getting worser now. But he wouldn’t allow himself to go. No, not now. First he was gonna finish the last chapter of this book. Then he would be done with his homework.
It took long but eventually the stream stops. Harry looks at Draco. He is squatting in a puddle of his own pee. His pants are completely soaked. And... oh shit. He is crying.
“Of course not. I’ll help clean you up and then we will forget about this, okay?”
“Yes?”
But they weren’t even out of the forest yet. The castle was still so far away.
He quickly walks over to the bathroom, but before he can hop in, Harry does. Draco had noticed how Harry’s been shifting around on the couch, probably needing to pee as well.
First, he needed to stand up. He carefully stood up, not wanting to strain his bladder even more. A little pee dribbled down in his boxer. He immediately doubled over and grabbed himself tightly with two hands. Oh... he needed to go so badly.
“Fuck you too,” Philia replies, doing a little salute before stumbling onto the train with her trunk. Most people are still farewelling their parents so she finds an empty compartment quick enough. She has a little radio that she has used a shrinking spell on so she can listen to her music, she simply plugs in her head phones and voila. She wouldn’t survive without her music. Soon, the train gives a jolt and starts to move forward, Philia watches her view change from the window, her head resting on the glass and her hands tucked between her thighs. It isn’t long before people try to sit in the compartment with her, she decides not to be a bitch and instead pretend to sleep so she doesn't have to socialise but can still use people with the information she hears.
“Philia!” Draco screams, bolting across the dining hall to where Philia is sitting with the Ravenclaws eating toast and writing an anonymous, rude letter to a teacher who annoyed her yesterday. She grins and looks up as he nears. He grabs her upper arms and turns her to face him, the reminisce of the drawings still on his face, “You little bitch, what is this!?”
“I did not!”
“Excuse me, Professor,” She stands up and leans on her desk, Professor turns to make eye contact, eyebrows raised, “It's bollocks that you put us in pairs with anyone let alone the Gryffindors!”
“Your brain is probably too small to comprehend this, darling, but the hat put me in this house so, therefore, I am a Ravenclaw, whether your itty bitty feewings like it or not,” Philia stands as she says this, getting attention from some of the other students to, “Plus, I like my septum piercing, you have no right to tell me it isn't completely awesome”
“I want to be sorted!”
ignore mistakes please! i didn't have lots of time to edit, anyway enjoy this chapter because I'm excited to publish the next one... :):)
“Sounds dumb,” Philia replies, back to what Ginny would count as her ‘normal self’.
“Ditto,” She agrees, whipping her wand out of her pocket and holding it to Draco’s throat, Draco looks surprised and drops Philia as if she's a hot ember, “Don't be scared, prude, all I’m going to hurt is your dignity”
Once at the brick wall that leads to the common room, she whispers the password Draco gave her. She didn't think it would be the real one, knowing Draco, but surprisingly it works! The wall opens up and Philia scrambles in before the wall shuts again. She admires the common room, although it's dark, the green looks splendid. Next, she takes on the task of trying to find Dracos dorm. It wouldn't be a real adventure if she did not tamper with her brother while she was there. Who knows when she might get another opportunity like this?
“You,” he points to me, “You have extraordinary will power, the hat did not really choose Ravenclaw for you, did it?”
“Of course I am, nitwit!” Philia screeches back, then whispers, “Up, but not dressed, ready or looking ok… or feeling it”
“I didn’t mean it like that!” Cho stutters, trying to right her words.
“Philia!” Draco yells from downstairs of the Malfoy manor, “We have to leave in 20 minutes, are you even out of bed?”
Philias day does not start well, but when does it ever? Her first two classes were awfully boring and about things she already knows. She managed to finish the homework for divination before class had even finished, so she doesn't have to worry about that at least. Although she doesn't need them, Philia hasn't made friends,but she has made enemies. Cho, whose last name Philia now knows is Chang, for example. Philia and Cho got paired for a herbology experiment, let's just say that Cho had to take a quick trip to the hospital wing after their experiment broke loose. Philia was, however, hopeful her next class would be a success. Apart from the fact they had Gryffindor for astronomy (they’d had them for divination too but that had gone smoothly), Philia couldn't wait for her favourite subject. Despite not caring about school whatsoever, astronomy really intrigues Philia. She thinks she will get a new ring as a promise to the stars, the rings she has at the moment are all quite old. Her favourite is an oval shape with Celtic patterns wrapping around the ring and around a circular green gem in the centre. Her other rings include thick rings with words engraved into the inside where you can't see, rings with little gems wrapped in silver, a flower ring with swirls that wrap all the way down her finger and a ring that looks like a piano is wrapped around her finger.
“I don't see that in your heart you are really a Ravenclaw”
Philia ignores her Mother and throws the floo into the fire, she whispers, “Kings Cross Station'' and steps into the fireplace. The warmth from the fire momentarily makes her feel alive before she steps out of the fireplace of the office of Kings Cross Station, she is careful so she doesn't attract attention as she creeps from the shop unnoticed. She waits for a few seconds and her family emerges soon after. Kings Cross Station is more busy today, of course, because school is starting up again at Hogwarts. This will be Philia's first year at Hogwarts even though she is almost sixteen because she was going to Beauxbatons Academy before they rudely banished her. She had been sent to detention many times for rude remarks, or pushing some of the girls around, but this time she had actually lit a girls hair on fire in class. Philia had an obsession with fire, she loved it. It is simply magic in itself the way it flickers and needs oxygen or it dies. Kind of like people. People are flames and perhaps the wicks of candles are their souls…
“I thought you hated music like you hate everything, plus I met you yesterday, how was I to know it would come up!”
“Can you see them?” A boy with round glasses and awful hair asks, he looks intrigued.
“Only the sound of my depression, do you want me to play it for you? It sounds like a mix between broken vinyl and crackling fire as I burn down your house with your family inside,” Philia murmurs, not wanting to let Ginny in on anymore of her personal life.
“You've been taking Trelawny too seriously,” Teases Philia, copying Ginny's parchment and trying not to look at her too much in case people think they are friends, that would ruin her reputation, plus, they most definitely aren't friends.
“They can’t come with us! What if they're Slytherin!”
“Oh, I get it!” Philia says with a fake laugh, “You think Ginny is disgusting, that makes FAR more sense!”
“Would you show me?” Ginny asks softly.
“I get it, cause the moon is a part of astrology,” Philia says in a ‘duh’ tone, “Well, is it a good song or not?”
“What do you do?” Philia smirks, “Sing?”
“Dunno what gave you that idea, sweetheart,” Philia snaps back, even though it's obvious because she would have left already if she really didn't want to be here.
“Are you sure you’re not taking things too far?” Millie asks, not making eye contact, “I mean, Draco looked pretty upset…”
Without thinking, Nyctophilia lets out a snort and mutters, “What a cow”.
“What!?” Ginny bursts, face contorted in disgust. Philia is doing the same, “You’ve got to be kidding me..” Ginny mutters as she collects her things and joins Philia. As the professor continues through the names, most people start with their essays and research meaning the attention and beady eyes that were once on Ginny and Philia are gone.
“Oh, that's kind of personal,” Ginny chuckles hesitantly.
“Manners! But I can't, at the moment the band is just them, Lee and me so it's not really official,” Ginny says, putting out the fire she’d set a light inside Philia.
“Do you play an instrument?” Ginny continues, ignoring Philia's comment.
“Drums and bass,” Ginny replies.
“She’s right!” Philia looks a little further down the table and sees Cho from earlier, “She doesn’t think like a Ravenclaw, act like a Ravenclaw or talk like a Ravenclaw! She doesn't even look like a Ravenclaw!”
“It means I like the dark and the demons that lurk within it. If you're not careful I might pull your soul into a dark abyss of nothing so I can suck the life out of everything you’ve ever enjoyed. It’s spelt: N-Y-C-T-O-P-H-I-L-I-A”
Dumbledore nods and returns to the teacher's table as food starts to appear on the silverware spread out along the tables, Philia digs in and the Ravenclaws observe her further.
“Look, I might reconsider if you take me to your brothers band practise, or do they do shows? Take me to one of those too!” Philia demands, letting her enthusiasm leak out the more she speaks.
Snickering, Philia leaves, excited for the reaction she will get tomorrow. It's most likely Draco will realise it was her pretty soon, but for now, she can rest contently...
Once at the second to last dorm, Philia whispers 'Lumos' and steps into the room. She feels exhilarated, like a weirdo lurking in the shadows. She is a weirdo lurking in the shadows. Examining the faces, she sees Draco quickly. Face contorting into a grin, she creeps over and puts a spell over Draco so his face has drawings all over it. The drawings include: A penis (of course), the words: I love Potter, arent I gay and multiple other doodles that Draco will have trouble getting rid of.
“It's funny, that's what it is,” Philia manages to say before erupting into the loudest laughter possible, her Mother used to say she sounded like her Aunty Bella when she laughed, high pitched and deranged. By now they have the attention of the whole hall, Philia takes advantage of this, “Where’s Potter? Did he get to see what was written on your face then?”
Once on the roof, Philia lies back with a sigh, looking up to the stars. She grazes over a few thoughts in her head and somehow she ends up thinking about Ginny from earlier.
“Hold on, your brothers have a band!” She exclaims, Ginny looks bewildered again, “Why have you never thought to tell me this?”
This is where the story kind of starts, consider the last chapter more of a prologue...
“Yes, Millie,” Philia replies before stuffing another toast into her mouth and turning back to her anonymous rude letter.
Groans and disapproving mutters buzz around the room but Philia is the most outraged of all.
Nyctophilias relection is pale as ever as she scowls at the mirror in her room. Bloodshot eyes, bags too and hair that hangs greasy and limp. The only thing looking good are her fingernails which she painted black just yesterday. She tries to smile, just to see how it would feel, but it doesn’t change anything, never does.
“Course not, Ma!” Philia says, fake enthusiastic, she turns to her Father and takes her trunk, “I think I’ll go now, please don’t talk to me Draco, I don't want people to know we are related, you know?”
A girl with dark skin and hazel eyes gasps, “You do not belong here! Ravenclaws want to improve and build on things, not destroy them!”
“Hey!” Ginny protests, laughing more now, “Well, no, I don't think I have one as of now”
“Look, you can pretend to be the queen of ‘i don't give a fuck’ and ‘i hate everything’ but it's plainly obvious that you adore stars, so let's enjoy this project and be as true to ourselves as possible,” Suggests Ginny, looking square into Philias dark blue eyes.
“How do you spell your name? What does it mean? I’ve never heard it before,” Ginny asks, after writing her own name.
“Welcome students of Hogwarts to another year! I don't want to bore you with an elaborate speech too early into the proceedings so we shall sort our first years now! However, we have a transfer student who shall be sorted first,” Dumbledore's voice booms through the hall and everyone is hush until he mentions the transfer, they all know its Philia, “Nyctophilia Malfoy, please take a seat”
“She’s asleep,” one voice says, a girls, then Philia hears multiple footsteps and the weight of her seat dip from someone sitting down, “She won’t mind if we join her”
“Because I value knowledge” Philia lies, the real reason is because, for starters, the Ravenclaw common room has the highest tower in Hogwarts, the dungeons for Slytherin are far too low.
“And why is that?”
“Sorry..” She whispers, hoping Ginny won't make fun of her. But, Happy with an apology and not wanting to ruin it, Ginny simply continues as if the words had never been uttered.
“Yep, so how did you get such good music taste?” Philia inquires, without realising she is letting on that she likes the song.
Nyctophilia doesn't sleep or fake sleep for the rest of the journey, instead she sits looking out her window trying not to think or fidget. No one else disturbs her on the train ride so the next time she sees anyone is when the train stops at Hogsmeade Station and students start bustling down the corridors to get out. By then darkness has fallen and a few teachers are standing around with lanterns directing the first years and other students. Someone takes Philia’s trunk and she follows the other students her age to a little road that has lines of carriages. She doesn't have much choice as to who she is in a carriage with, but doesn’t take much notice, too busy observing the peculiar creatures pulling the carriage.
“No shit I can see them, they're right there,” I snap, “Perhaps you've been prescribed the wrong glasses”
“Hey girls! Glad to join your little posse, don't mind me, alright?” Philia laughs, walking over to her bed. She goes to the bathroom that the dorm has attached to slip into her pajamas, then puts a jacket on over the top ready to leave the dorm.
“Hush! Silence everybody!” The noise dies down until everyone is either looking at Dumbledore impatiently or Philia accusingly, “We shall keep the first years in the hall for tonight to settle dorms, but the rest of you are going to be kind and patient until then, let's enjoy the feast and I will hopefully have the hat fixed by morning”.
“You should have told us you were awake,” Ginny mutters, she is holding a chocolate frog and breaks some off to eat.
The hat stumbles for a few seconds before it can finally get the words out, “Ah, um, s-sly”
“Were you pretending to sleep?” Ginny asks as Philia opens her eyes, looking Cho up and down, Cho looks mildly intimidated and Philia wonders what it is about her that's scary, her septum piercing perhaps? Or her height? Maybe she should stand up.
“If I get kicked out of this school, I’ll tie myself to a post and light myself on,” Philia does jazz hands and smiles, “FIRE!”
“Can’t you use your inner eye to find out more useful information?” Philia groans.
“That and I also play piano,” Ginny says, unfazed again by Philia’s retorts, “Perhaps if you joined the band we would have enough members”
“She has good arms,” Philia whispers to herself, chuckling slightly. Before she gets too tired and falls asleep on the roof, Philia returns to her dorm. From what she can tell the others are asleep, but they could be pretending. It doesn't matter, because as soon as Philia gets into bed and drops down her privacy curtains she falls asleep.
Philia laughs, “There is no way you’re wrapping me into this..” But Ginny has her ways, and Philia had already fallen madly for her charm.
“Stow it, Malfoy, I know you love astronomy,” Ginny accuses, pulling up her own parchment and ink too, writing up the date with her quill.
As she goes up the stairs she almost loses her footing, making a slight thud as she catches herself. Philia's heart leaps at the sudden sound she has made, pressing herself against the shadows as a voice comes from inside a dorm. The said dorm door opens and a boy peers around the hall, Philia has to hold in her laughter as she goes unseen. As soon as the door shuts again and the light under the door of the dorm is off, Philia continues, being more careful now.
Those words hardly made Harry relax as he allowed Draco to push him down against the pillows; threading a leg between the chilled tanned ones and feeling Harry tense up beside him. He wanted so desperately for the younger man to relax and to trust him and to want this as much as he wanted it. He ran his hand over the nightshirt, not wanting to go underneath the fabric and frighten his companion. Above all Harry was afraid, but after the way he had cared for Draco and spent so much time with him, he couldn't think of what would truly hinder their friendship. He wasn't sure about how kissing the blonde would be a progression or a regression, but he couldn't deny that no one had said anything for ten minutes and he'd been staring at the blonde's pale pink lips. He licked his one lips and didn't object when Draco rested his head down in front of his, sharing the same pillow, and almost touching noses.
to look back –dear Merlin he wanted to look back at the man he'd loved with all his heart –but he couldn't. He felt nothing but disgust at the rejection that was now slathered over him like bile. Instead of looking back around, he simply carried on through the door, along the winding corridors and back to his own bedchamber. He knew Harry wasn't going to bother himself with removing himself from his bed and hurrying after him, but that didn't mean that his chest didn't ache as he unconsciously stayed up for another hour and a half, curled around a plump pillow and slow hot tears running down his cheeks.
The words made Harry feel embarrassed but he didn't understand why. He merely allowed himself to be pulled down until he was leaning over Draco. He could feel the breath rushing down his chest from where the blonde was breathing up against him. He could feel every muscle in his body vibrating with anticipation as Draco reached up with quavering fingers to gently tousle through Harry's dark hair. To his surprise, he felt that the blonde man's touch was exciting him in a way he wasn't used to. It unnerved him but a tiny voice in the back of his head insisted he didn't want it to stop. He felt tense as Draco dared to trail his fingers lower, down the length of his flushed throat and drifting down his chest muscles and tickling the trail of dark hair at the top of his abdomen. "Draco … What are you doing?" he finally managed to breathe
"I love you too," Harry whispered, his voice seeming to have disappeared with the shock of the gorgeous, cool band on his left hand. It shone brightly in the cozy lighting of the restaurant. He gazed at it for a few moments longer, turning his hand at slight angles so that the ring glimmered. It smiled a little wider and almost jumped out of his skin when Draco placed a hand on his shoulder.
Harry wiped his eyes discreetly, and squeezed his lovers hand tightly, "this was a perfect holiday, Draco. I almost wish that we didn't have to go home."
He had received a small parcel in the post that morning. Clearly it wasn't dangerous otherwise it would have been diverted. Unless the system was getting slack, which he didn't doubt would happen eventually. He had opened the parcel and inside was a small slip of paper and a phial of scented body oil to be dabbed behind the ear before he went to sleep. When he unfolded the slip of paper he was amazed that written across it was the password to the prefects' bathroom. As insulted as he was, he couldn't deny that he wouldn't mind taking a long, quiet soak in the swimming pool-sized bath-tub. He was curious about the body oil too.
He shifted away, glaring weakly up at the brunette man who seemed unfazed. "What are you doing?" he asked irritably, feeling his greasy skin getting wetter. A bath would definitely feel great right now. Being clean would be a blessing.
Draco fought the urge to roll his eyes as he continued to stare down at the faded cushioned cover of the armchair. His throat was drying up and he could see Harry was going to argue against almost everything he could possibly say that would ensure Harry would be closer to him and further away from the hospital. He didn't want this, the constant fighting, the arguing the lack of understanding on Harry's part. It wasn't what had drawn him to the brunette in the first place. He understood that patients came first, but sometimes personal life needed to come first. "You can't save everyone, Harry," he muttered gently, so low that he wasn't entirely sure that the stubborn younger man had heard, but he decided that it didn't matter. Not at two o'clock in the morning at the very least. With a deep breath, he forced himself out of the armchair and made his way across the room to the door. He forced the handle down and opened it and he
Harry was shocked to say the least. What Lord Malfoy was suggesting was not something that had even entered into his mind. "W-wouldn't you prefer to have someone that you know informing your master Malfoy of such things? My presence would surely only disturb him further, and I wouldn't want to be a burden on you, Lord Malfoy."
Harry sniffed lightly, drawing the back of his hand underneath his nose. "I feel so useless," he eventually breathed, his shoulders shaking as tears brimmed on his lashes, "I can't do anything for myself anymore!"
Draco, now walking across the living room to the bedroom door, called out over his shoulders, "We're off to Blackpool for a long weekend."
He sighed as the bell chimed, the plates vanished, and his classmates stood up to head for their next lesson. Pansy groaned as she fell into step alongside him and Draco as they left the hall. "I don't want to go to Potions with the Gryffindor's," Pansy pouted as they made a sharp turn in the corridor to descend down to the dungeons for their class.
Draco felt his lips curled into a sneer, "I think your teacher is looking for you, Potter," he sneered as he turned away and took another flute of champagne from the bar and then disappeared into the numerous black robes of the mass crowd that were milling around inside the function room. Harry was suddenly no longer in the mood to talk to anyone and was all too happy when Snape found him, followed by Ronald and Dennis and then escorted them back out to the main lobby where they gathered their travelling cloaks and out into the balmy night and back towards their own hotel a few blocks. No one spoke on the way back, not even Dennis who was the chirpiest one out of all of them.
Cass grinned down at the dog, bending to his knees to ruffle the golden flanks, "Oh, he is a beaut!" he straightened up, "So where are you boys' from?"
Without saying a word the younger man shifted down onto one knee and pulled out a little box from the pocket in his trousers. Draco felt everything inside him tighten up. His body flushed with heat and his stomach flipped uncontrollably as he watched the lid of the box slide back to reveal a little gold ring. It was so hot all of a sudden that breathing was becoming almost too difficult. He clenched his fingers into fists and drew in long shuddering breaths to calm his racing heartbeat. "Draco," Harry smiled softly, his green eyes glimmering in the candlelight, "I have rehearsed this so many times in the last few weeks but nothing ever seemed good enough to say to you. So all I can do is ask; will you, Draco Lucius Malfoy, do me the honour of being my husband? To let me love you and hold you and accept every last inch of you the way that you have done with me? I know we cannot be the conventional marital couple, but even if it's in the privacy of our own home, I want you to be my husband, I want you to be mine and no one else's. I want you to love me as much as I love you. This ring is as close to married as either one can get. I want you to be mine. Every last breath in your body, I want to be mine and I, yours. Let me love you. Let us be as married as we can be and live as happily as we have been."
Draco couldn't help it. He glanced down and sure enough, Potter was hard through his school trousers. The sight alone sent blood rushing to his own cock. "I don't need 'accio' to make you come."
Harry felt his heart melt into a puddle in his chest as he floated off of his chair and into his jacket, Draco's arms giving him a loving squeeze as he fumbled with the zip. With a small, tender kiss to his cheek, Harry allowed himself to be gently led from the restaurant, all the while his eyes were flitting back to his left hand and the beautiful ring that now glimmered on it, declaring to the world that he belonged to one, Draco Malfoy. He sniffed and cuffed his nose as he leaned into Draco's warm embrace as they walked casually down the street towards the promenade that was now dusted with the darkening blue sky of the night.
With a heavy sigh she turned around, her arms folded across her chest, to look up at him, "I didn't mean to snap like that," she offered by way of an apology.
' –he hadn't thought of Draco in that way for a very long time. The heavy shame that weighed down in his chest stayed with him until somewhere in the house the clock chimed eight o'clock in the morning.
She hummed in response and then raked her fingers through her hair, "It's just so irritating. The war was meant to get rid of all of this. I know no one likes being forced to grow up, but we had to and they're still acting in this way over easy targets. It's barbaric."
"What the fuck was that for?" he shouted out, his anger rising out of him like a torrent of burning water.
Draco huffed in annoyance and swiped a handkerchief from his top pocket and swiped it across his brow. "Fine," he huffed waving his hand at Harry, "Read if you must but I can't promise to pay attention to you."
Harry's fingers were cool as they slipped weakly into his palm.
"I'm scared that one day I'm going to wake up and not have you beside me –and –and that it'll be all my fault," he blinked away at the tears brimming on his lashes before inhaling deeply, "And it's not even that the same thing would have happened. What if –what if I drive you away again? Without physical consequences? What if I am so unbearably horrid that regardless of our age, you decide that you can no longer stand to be around me?"
He sighed and pinched the bridge of his nose and stood up, adjusting his robes before grabbing his briefcase from the trunk rack and departing from the train.
"Isn't that gross?" Draco found himself asking, as he leaned up on his elbows.
Draco looked up into those bright green eyes that were no longer obscured by his round glasses. They were filled with concern and shining with lust. It was a strange, over-whelming sensation that flooded Draco with a renewed sense of confidence. He reached up and brushed Harry's hair out of his eyes before tenderly cupping his face. "Take me," he breathed.
Harry swung his legs back and forth through the stone pillars of the Astronomy Tower balcony. His gaze was unfocused as he stared out at the sunset that was blanketing the grounds in a soft, burning gold light.
Dinner passed him by in much the same fashion as any of the other meals in the Great Hall. General chatter filled the air as did the scent of the beautifully cooked food.
Harry leaned up on his elbow with a shocked expression. "Are you honestly telling me you'd like to do that again?" he asked hesitantly.
Draco smiled serenely to himself as Harry hobbled over the carpet and disappeared into the bathroom. He waited until he heard the spray of the shower before gaining the energy to haul himself up from the comfortable mattress and open the window that sat low in the wall about two feet away from the bed. The cool evening air swept in and covered his skin in goosepimples. He shivered slightly and went to the conjoined wardrobe and dresser, hobbling slightly as his roughly stretched anus was throbbing painfully. He winced as he bent down to retrieve a pair of pajama bottoms to step into.
He climbed back up the stairs to the main lobby where Harry was sitting on the bottom stair with his head resting softly in his hands. Draco frowned slightly and touched the thin man weakly, "hey love, I'm sorry about that."
Draco wanted to object but he held his tongue and nodded, "Of course, Harry," he assured as he accepted the brunette back into his arms and cradled him in such an affectionate manner, it was such a sharp contrast to his sharp features and haughty disposition. Harry melted into his arms at the touch, his eyelids fluttering closed.
Draco frowned and turned his head to look down at the young physician in his arms. "What are you saying Harry?"
!' the voice sneered in his head, '
Draco cut him off with a firm kiss against his mouth; silencing Harry and making the brunette melt a little more into the mattress. "You talk too much, Potter," he murmured as he leaned over the brunette man. He stroked a strand of dark hair behind his ear and smiled softly down at him, "Let's not worry anymore, alright? You can sneak back to your bedchamber in the morning if you must, but for now just relax okay? If this is the only chance I get to do this, then let it happen now."
"For you to vent," he replied evenly, "You have a lot of anger that you need to get out. Don't deny it!" he stated quickly just as Draco was about to retort. He watched, satisfied, as the blonde's mouth clamped shut again. "You need to vent and that's okay. If you want, I can help you with that. We can do it in the room, just as long as there are no cutting curses flying about, alright?"
Opening his eyes he was greeted with the sight of dark grey clouds shading the horizon and a curtain of rain spilling down against the window. He grimaced at the ache blooming in his chest. He could feel a stiffness creep into his knees and wanted nothing more than to stoke a fire and curl up in front of it with a blanket tucked around him. He had never felt as old as he did at that moment. He blew warm air onto his hands and rubbed them down his face before taking out another letter from inside his satchel. He slipped it out of the envelope and held it a little closer to read in the dimming light.
