“I will be,” Harry nodded. “But hey, if I fall for a British Alpha, just imagine the yelling you would be into if you fall for a British Omega,” he said doing his best attempt at smiling.
I would like to say to my guests and anonymous readers, I am sorry that you cannot comment. A troll came here and decided to ruin everything, even going as so far as impersonating to be me as they reply to you, my wonderful and beautiful readers. That said, I want you guys to know that I FINALLY KNOW WHO VOLDEMORT IS GOING TO BONE--I MEAN MATE. *ahem* thank you all for your suggestions, they're all wonderful, however I feel that the person I have picked will be best for everyone involved. However, if you guys still want to play the shipping game.... I uhh now need an Omega for Ron! I know, terrible right I write a story and don't know who I'm shipping who with? What you call Improper preparation (which it is) I call "cheap ways to interact with the readers." So! Who do you think Alpha Ron will get hanky panky with? And don't worry, we won't see any *explicit* stuff with Ron. Just with Harry and Draco, and maybe Voldemort and his Omega.
Harry looked up at his father, silently challenging him. They were both silent for a moment Harry looked down at the wedding seating. He picked up a quill and started crossing names out. Daphne Greengrass, Pansy Parkinson, their parents, the Crabbes, the Goyles, the Carrows and Yaxley. When he was done, the only names who weren’t crossed off was Blaise, Theo, their parents, and the Malfoys. He looked up at Voldemort.
“Oh really?” Harry chuckled. Draco just smirked and led Harry to the nearest bathroom. He casted a locking spell on the door after making sure they were alone and turned to Harry. He bit his bottom lip, “So,” his hand went into his pocket and pulled out a small black plug, “I want you to try this on, and keep it in you the entire game,” he ordered. “If it hurts too much, then I have another order in mind.”
The cut on Draco’s hand started to heal itself, the blood clotting quickly and skin stitching itself back together. Draco did the same with Harry’s hand and they kept their hands held while they held their free hand to the stump and started chanting.
“In our private notebook we go into more intimate details about what happens when we have sex,” Harry stated.
There were two spots open, and Harry took the one next to Theo, smiling brightly at him. “Good morning Theo, how did you sleep?” he asked as he lifted up his wrist.
“Because the next thing I have to tell you might make you hate me,” Harry said, “and I don’t want to keep it a secret because you know I’m bullocks with them.”
“Wake up, my son,” the handsome face of Voldemort said. Harry screamed and jumped up, only to see that he was no longer in his room, but on the floor of Malfoy Manor.
“My sweet Harry,” Blaise said, lifting Harry’s hand gently, “is marked by my father to become his wife… I do not want that. You, Loki, will have your revenge against Satan by helping us plan our wedding and trap Satan within it.”
Voldemort stared hard at Harry and their eyes met. Harry felt the familiar pinch in his head, and remembered Mrs. Weasley teaching him household spells. Voldemort seemed satisfied and nodded, pulling out Harry’s wand and giving it to the boy. “Just the one spell, Harry,” he warned.
that looked interesting, and moved to buy them. The old man found them again behind the counter. He silently bagged charged them. Harry paid, not even paying attention to the price, and as they walked out, Harry leaned into Draco and smiled. “I think next time I should have my collar,” he hummed. “That would freak the old man out even more, don’t you think?”
“A rat,” Ron said, looking entirely disappointed. “Sometimes I wish a cat can just come along and eat it.”
“They were just standing there—snogging!” Ron said. “Snogging! She’s my sister and Greengrass was just snogging her!”
There was a second knock on his door. Harry looked at his watch and smiled as it ticked eleven-fifty pm. Uncle Remus walked in and looked at Harry’s outfit. He let out a small chuckle and placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders affectionately. “An outfit befitting of a Potter,” he said. “Come on, we are ready for you.”
“And you are still acting too lax about Malfoy,” Hermione said, looking at Ron and Harry. “Both of you—I don’t get how you can forget everything he is and who his family is!”
“That’s great,” Niall smiled, “I’ll make sure to save you a seat.” Harry nodded in agreement and Harry said, “Oh! You have to meet Theo, he’s like one of the only two people I find reasonable there. He’s an Omega like me and really nice. We, we actually shared plushies last night,” Harry’s cheeks started to blush. “He has an Alpha named Blaise Zabini and they’re both very helpful.”
Voldemort moved to the fireplace, where Harry saw a folded bundle. It was a black robe just as his father’s, with a large hood. “Wear this, I do not wish to reveal you as Harry Potter yet, my son,” Voldemort said.
“No it is not, it is what happened,” Mr. Riddle said. “I’ve asked Hagrid myself during my visits to the school to prepare for this case. The current Headmistress of Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall, can agree as a witness to mine and Hagrid’s conversations.” He looked up at the crowd, his eyes falling directly on Professor McGonagall. A hush fell upon the room as everyone looked at her.
Harry gave a shy smile, “A date could be nice,” he said, “We could head down to Hogsmeade this weekend… shouldn’t be too crowded.”
“I...” Draco stuttered. He didn’t know how to feel. His breath shaky, Draco walked to the mirror, staring in horror at the hair. He shook himself out of it and ran to the bathroom. It took him more than an hour to get back to normal. He carefully removed all body hair, trimmed his hair until it was the perfect length, and that his neat patch of pubic hair was back to how it was, giving his penis a couple inches look. Noticing it, Draco couldn’t help but notice that it looked different, larger, but now wasn’t the time to confirm.
Uncle Remus whistled in response. The sound of two dogs barking and a fox yipping filled the house as the three familiars seemed to jump into the kitchen from the shadows. Mr. Malfoy eyed them with distain. “I see… your crowd is always so barbaric. Draco, I will be outside. Say your goodbyes to i—Potter, and meet me there.” He turned around and walked away. Draco stood awkwardly, shuffling from foot to foot.
He opened his eyes. Every inch of his body was covered in icy sweat; his bedcovers were twisted all around him like a straitjacket; he felt as though a white-hot poker was being applied to his forehead.
There was a moment in the classroom where each and every student was silent. They turned to Mr. Riddle, who was equally as silent, for an explanation. Mr. Riddle looked back at all of them, his face stoic and unflinching, “Well,” he said, “You’ve heard her. Tomorrow during your free periods, you all shall report to her classroom. Now, let us get back to the lesson…”
“At first it doesn’t but it’s the truth,” Harry said, “That’s my life. Dumbledore tried to get me to kill my father!”
The three nodded and worked quickly to make a menu that they were happy with. Compared with the seating, this process only took a couple hours. “Good,” Uncle Remus smiled, “I will make phone calls and arrange for a tasting then.” He quickly wrote something down, “Now, for the invitations…”
Ginny looked at Harry and smiled, Harry couldn’t help but notice that she smelt rather flowery. He smiled back friendlily. “So, Harry,” she said, “want to go for a little walk with me? We hadn’t had a chance to catch up lately. We can play Quidditch.”
December came quickly, arriving with it a positive avalanche of homework for the fifth years with its snow. Harry had found that the shadow walkers were much more useful as the daylight became shorter and shorter. It was them who told Harry of Draco’s actions on Goyle, and their influence on Draco as they did so. Not that he told Draco about this, Harry wanted his man to be proud of his actions.
“Oh dear,” Dumbledore muttered, “I can see how this can become a problem.” He leaned back and looked between the two of them. “Great distances from each other will cause intense pain, even in this castle it is enough to feel as though you two are going through an intense sickness.” He frowned and stroked his moustache and beard in thought.
“To escort you down to breakfast,” Malfoy said as though it was obvious. “Come on.” Harry stared at him some more before getting out of bed.
Harry nodded, “Actually yes,” he said. “I saw the Dark Lord, I saw the Devil… a couple times actually.”
“I know, but like I said, I didn’t think they would actually do it,” Draco shrugged. “But now they did…”
--“so it’s the first test for new Gryffindor Keeper, Weasley, brother of Beaters, Fred and George, and a promising new talent on the team—come on Ron!”
for Harry. “I don’t want to be caught unaware,” he explained as he added the book to the small pile. Their godfathers nodded and with their new purchases, the family stepped out, ready to apparate home.
“Manipulating Harrison? Don’t you dare begin to talk about manipulation, Albus Dumbledore! You have had a hand in Harrison’s development ever since you kidnapped him!” Mr. Riddle yelled. “From when he arrived to the Potters to when he was given to the Dursleys instead of his godparents and now here, you are trying to use my son as a shield so you can play the victim!”
“That you know of,” Nott smirked. “Anyway, I think I’ll visit you more over the summer, I want to spend more time with Harry… and give him some tips on getting that body of his.”
It was true. During Harry’s first day of heat, Ron gathered his courage and asked Daphne for a breakfast date during the morning of the weekend. It was a very beautiful September day, and Ron managed to convince the house-elves to make them food that they could eat outside in the courtyard. There was a table set up and the two sat across from each other as a small spread of food appeared. “This is brilliant,” Ron grinned. “Perks of being a Prefect, eh?”
“Firstly, I have a mild case of lycanthropy,” Draco began, “however I do not become a werewolf during the full moon. There is not enough of the... ailment,” he said cautiously, glancing at Harry, “however I have some werewolf-like traits. Or rather, animalistic traits. I find that I am more aggressive, and the meat I usually like to eat needs to be rarer for me to properly enjoy them. I think Greyback did this to me as either to enhance his own lycanthropy, or lycanthropy itself is needed for the base of all the other changes.”
“Well, that’s our Harry isn’t it?” Theo said, “he has so many secrets to keep nowadays, doesn’t he?” Ron looked at him suspiciously.
“Sirius shut it,” Remus said, pulling his husband back down. He cleared his throat and smiled softly at Niall, “The changes that Harry is going through will take years, he won’t have the physical ability to carry until everything is fully formed when he is around fourteen years old, but even then, we all would rather he does not get pregnant until he is twenty-seven.”
“Malfoy you say? Interesting,” a third voice said. Uncle Remus looked behind him as a tall pale man with a handsome face stepped out into the foyer. “I am sorry to intrude on a familial occasion; however, I have a busy schedule today, and a wife to get back to.”
“Leave my father,” Harry said. “We will tell Dumbledore everything, see if he knows more and if not…” he sighed and took a deep breath, looking Draco in the eye, he said, “if Dumbledore cannot help us, then I will use my father’s training against him. I’ll kill any and all of his followers who will remain loyal to him.”
“Or, because I am more useful to my father than you or any follower can be,” Harry countered. Yaxley raised his eyebrow at this.
and together the two went inside. Once again music blasted in Draco’s ears, ruining any chance of conversation until they were in the kitchen. Draco glanced at Harry and asked in what he hoped was a calm, conversational tone, “What do you want to drink?”
He needed to get them out, and if Dumbledore would not help him, then he would find his own way. So, the next day he made himself as presentable as possible. He found his least shabby robes and made sure his sandy hair was at least clean. The werewolf steeled himself as he stepped outside of his home, one of the small cottages that the Blacks owned for centuries, and apparated away.
He screamed and screamed as Sirius’s hands held him tighter. He pulled Harry into a hug and would not let go as Harry continued to scream, his voice growing hoarse and dying. He coughed, gagged and made unhuman gargling noises as his voice broke. His mind was slipping between something and reality, he didn’t want to be touched. He was dirty.
“That medieval thing! Mrs. Weasley scoffed. “Half the time it gets the right results and the other half it just detects your dinner. Ahh, here we are…” Carrying an armful of containers, she gave Harry a little smile and said, “I’ll be back with a nice drink for you, calm down a bit until I return.”
“Well I can’t, the place makes me feel weak,” Harry said, still looking at the monster before him with a hard glare. Voldemort raised the skin above his eye as though raising an eyebrow, even though he had none. “Uncle Vernon just beats me and beats me. Happy? Now, will you kill me or not?”
Harry returned to his room irritated yet embarrassed as he returned to his room. He thanked Nagini and told her he wanted to be alone. Falling on his bed he groaned as he took off his pants and reached down, feeling wet slick. “Fuck,” he whispered. Harry groaned, “Stupid fucking Alpha. Why did he cause me to get wet?” Harry was shocked to feel his hole slick and wet. Hating the feeling, and needing to sleep, Harry debated on whether he should take care of it or not. His horniness gotten the better of him. So, he took off his clothes and laid on his bed and closed his eyes as his hand slid down his taunt body, reaching his wet dripping hole, his other hand grabbing his hardening member. He tried to think of Viktor, but as he came, his mind was full of platinum hair.
“No, something after me, something’s coming,” Harry whispered. “I can feel it. I’ve been feeling it all month. I don’t know what it is, just a bad feeling on the back of my neck. It’s always there, but today it’s stronger than ever.”
“I know, which is why Niall is going to make sure you stay out of trouble,” Remus said. He hugged and ruffled Harry’s hair playfully. “Get good grades and have fun, okay boys? Make friends, it’ll all be fine.”
“Ok, I’ll try it out,” Cedric shrugged, he thought for a moment, “but only if you two tell me about domination and submission.”
He shook his head and stared down at the mark that he received on his Dark Initiation, which felt almost a lifetime ago. All too soon, time passed and Uncle Sirius knocked gently on his door before entering. “It’s time,” he said.
“You’re an Omega!” Ginny raved. “You’re an Omega and you’re supposed to be an Alpha! You lied to us! You lied to me!”
the demon thought to himself, his cock pushing hard against his own pants. His body was skinny and somewhat featureless, smooth yet hints of manhood. His light nipples and chest were dusted with blonde hair, a treasure trial nearly kept, lead towards a short, neat patch of pubic hair that laid loving on top of a long pale cock with a fat pink head. “We should all tan together,” Blaise said, “naked… it’s good for the skin,” he said to them as though there was no room of argument. He circled around and cupped Draco’s ass, giving a nice firm squeeze, causing the boy to make noises,” Responsive… love that,” he chuckled. “Have you ever thought of receiving, Draco?”
The demon caught up with Draco at the door and grabbed his hand before the blonde could open it. “Looks like Harry’s not the only one I have to protect,” Blaise smirked.
Mr. Krum grunted and looked at his son. “I’ll let it slide, considering you got my son out of his room,” he muttered. “Goodbye, Harry.”
Harry could feel his hand pulsing at the demon’s sight and presence. Draco’s hand squeezed his other and he glanced at Draco to see the blonde grinning madly. “We did it,” he whispered.
Nobody laughed. Harry glared at Zabini and stood quickly. “I would rather you do not make any of those kinds of jokes around me Zabini. You are my Alpha’s friend however I still don’t know you. Pray that you don’t make a horrible impression.”
It was a dreamless sleep, thankfully, a sleep that was more about fighting exhaustion than dreams and recharging yourself. It was hours later that he woke up, the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon gone. He still felt tired, almost deadly so, however, Draco felt like he was in no near trouble of collapsing from exhaustion. Slowly, Draco opened his eyes, and the first thing he saw was red. Bright red-orange hair.
“A little jinx,” Snape repeated slowly. “Is it also true then, Potter, that you have repeatedly yelled at her?”
“I know that now,” Bellatrix sighed. “You’re right, I never should have come here in the first place.”
“What? I’m not suggesting that we go into Professor Umbridge’s office while she’s at the infirmary suffering after-effects from a potion you’ve thrown at her without her knowing,” Harry smiled. “I also am not suggesting that it’ll give me an hour to make said potion and it’ll be ready around, say, one in the afternoon?”
“Besides, he’s sort of dating Remus right now and he trusts him,” Harry admitted, “Although he doesn’t know that my father is the Dark Lord yet! So Hermione please for the love of god don’t tell him.”
When everyone appeared to be seated, the Minister cleared his throat and shuffled through a stack of papers in front of him, “Right, well, let’s begin. October 18
“Hello to you too, Pansy,” Draco sighed. He ignored her and petted Harry’s hair. “Harry, these are my friends, plus Pansy Parkinson. Blaise, Theo, Daphne, this is my Omega, Harry.”
Harry and Draco quickly fell upon each other in a loveseat, their legs tangled together as they cuddled, giving each other lazy kisses, or drawing patterns on the other’s body as Remus sat awkwardly on the couch, glancing at Mr. Riddle who paced impatiently. It was almost ten minutes after they returned home and neither adult said a word. Suddenly, Mr. Riddle stopped and looked at the windows. “Finally,” he muttered. “Draco, go open the door for your father.”
“Is it not in an Alpha’s nature to comfort an Omega in need?” Voldemort asked. “I am not here to be creepy or cross any boundaries, however, I just could not help but follow this saddening scent.” He looked around for a moment before looking at Lupin. “If you are uncomfortable about talking here, perhaps we can move someplace more inclusively secretive?”
“Blood of my beloved,” Draco chanted, “may it power these ancient runes, and allow your souls to be one.” He closed Harry’s hand with his free hand and squeezed it, letting the blood drip onto the knife. “Love’s blood coat the steel so that we may be your soul’s armor.” He took the knife away from Harry’s hand and quickly sliced his own hand. Harry held Draco’s bleeding hand, letting their blood mix onto the blood. “Love’s blood coat the steel so that we may be my soul’s armor,” he said.
“Never!” Harry yelled. The voice laughed once more and Harry drowned it with another gulpful, ignoring it and his growing erection. Two more times the slime dripped down his throat, and Harry grimaced as he wished the full moon would be over with.
“Potter!” Malfoy growled out. Harry could feel the young Alpha’s anger and irritation towards him coming in powerful waves. He stood his ground, however, ignoring his Omega’s need to cower and show submission. “What are you doing here?”
“Been waiting for this part,” Draco muttered, causing Harry to giggle before their lips smashed against one another, gliding across as the faint sound of clapping reached their ears. Their eyes slipped close, Draco holding Harry tightly as their kiss continued. When they separated, Voldemort forced them to step back as he walked between them. His wand in his hand, he gave a sweeping wave and the room changed. The seats the guests were sitting floated up, moving among themselves as tables appeared and they floated down, sitting where both Voldemort and Mrs. Malfoy planned weeks before. On the platform, a large table appeared with five chairs. Harry frowned at this, watching as Voldemort moved to sit in the center chair, Harry and Draco left to sit on one side of the table, and Draco’s parents the other.
“Good night, Harry,” Draco said. He gave Harry a small smile and Harry felt his heart quicken. Harry watched the Alpha getting into his bed before he slipped into his own, closing the curtains as he laid down and looked at his bandaged hand.
“It’s about Blaise… I love you but… I think I’m starting to fall for him too,” Draco said. “The way he talks to us, looks at us… smells… please tell me that you share the same feeling.”
Harry looked up at Draco, and moved away so that he was standing next to the bed, Draco stood up as well. “Come to the Burrow,” he repeated. “You can feel it too, right? This pull between us? I don’t know what it is, but I don’t want to destroy it. So, come live with me at the Burrow! It must be better than living in this small room. Besides, then we can be together,” Harry gave a sly smile, “we can properly learn about each other, how we feel and touch, how our bodies changed.”
“You and him were in similar situations, just as you and I were. He was my apprentice, my submissive, and I’ve used the same clause to make him mine… and in doing so, I have cast away those disgusting apes, the Riddles, from my life. A father who did not know I existed and grandparents who pretended my mother did not exist. Those were my muggle blood, and I threw them away completely. Just as you will throw away the Dursleys.” He paused, Harry was still staring at him, his stomach still churning. “Harry… muggles are beneath us, nothing good can come from their existence… they only live to serve Wizarding kind… the same as mudbloods—”
Voldemort stopped, and Harry was surprised at how easy it was to hide his dainty frame behind his father.
It was a good final lesson, covering everything they have learned since the meetings began. There was some disappointment that they weren’t learning anything new, but Harry retorted that it would be useless to start something new right before the holidays begin. Just as Harry told Draco, Neville had improved beyond all recognition. Neville successfully froze and unfroze Harry three times, performing the basic spells he taught perfectly. When the hour was up, Harry called for a halt.
“What’s the matter?” Fred said impatiently, moving around Ron to look over his shoulder at the parchment. Fred’s mouth fell open too.
“No,” Harry said, shaking his head. “I’m still a Gryffindor. We think that it’s the best place for me. However, my dad did give me a task to do while here. I have to turn the student body against Dumbledore. My father wants to be out in the open about our relationship, however, we need people against Dumbledore to back us up.”
Ron turned to see first year Hufflepuffs looking up at him. “Yeah, I’m looking for Cedric,” Ron said gruffly. “Diggory.”
The sigil started to glow, and Harry felt a sharp pull inside him. His scar burned as though on fire, and he opened his mouth only scream at the sensation. He fell to his hands and knees before collapsing, the world around him going black.
“I haven’t talked to my friends about it yet,” Harry admitted. Dumbledore nodded and looked between the two of them.
“Because there are gay guys like me who wants to start a family with their significant other but can’t because it is normally impossible,” Harry explained. “Like imagine if Charlie wants to start a family with his boyfriend.”
“I mean if they’re that sexy enough, yeah,” Blaise smirked, “but I don’t think I can handle dating the Dark Lord’s son, sorry Harry.”
“Now,” Mr. Riddle said. He moved to an old battered wardrobe and opened it. Two long bars shot out of it, on which were costumes hanging on hooks. “The left is for the girls, the right the boys. You will be paired girl/boy for the dance… except for you two, Harry and Draco, I’ve decided to be progressive and allow you two to be partnered.”
“But she started this when she overheard me talking with Ron and Hermione about you,” Harry sighed. He rolled to his side and stared at Draco as the blonde silently worked. Draco did not respond, instead, he scribbled something as a puff of smoke vaporized. “What are you doing?”
Umbridge, thankfully, wasn’t waiting for him as he left the spiraling staircase. He went to the Great Hall, as he was hungry, and it was still breakfast time. As he sat down, Ron asked him what he and Hermione wanted to do.
Harry sighed and sat back on his bed. He looked up at Ron and patted next to him. His friend walked and sat next to Harry, both silent for a moment as Harry gathered his thoughts. “It all started the day of that article,” he said. “I was really sad and really angry, so I walked out of the Dursleys’ house and into a nearby woods.” Harry proceeded to tell Ron everything he could remember about the past week at Malfoy Manor. Ron listened intently, for once never interrupting and demanding questions. Instead, he just had a sort of frown on his face as he concentrated on what Harry said. The Alpha crossed his arms when Harry finished his story.
“I understand,” Uncle Remus nodded. “However…” he placed his hands on Draco’s shoulders and smiled softly, speaking in an equally soft tone, “whatever happens, you’re welcomed here. The month or so Harry has known you, he has grown so much more open. You might not see it now, but you’re a good influence on him, right Sirius?”
He could feel the Dark Lord’s eyes burrowing in on him, and he did not want to fail. He went to the cupboard and quickly found bottles full of wormwood and baneberries. Grabbing both, he cut the wormwood in half before adding and squeezed the juices out of the berries. Than he began stirring. Once, twice, thrice, ten times he stirred before, suddenly, the water turned crystal clear and sat still, as though chilled over the roaring fire underneath. Harry turned the flames off and stepped away, sweaty and nervous.
“This doesn’t mean we’re friends though,” Ron said, snapping from whatever daze held him. “Understand?”
“Well whatever you do, make sure the wear a jacket,” Uncle Remus said. “It’s a surprisingly cold day for July.”
“Mum tried to visit him, talk with him, but he just slammed the front door in front of her,” Fred said.
“Don’t call yourself that!” Uncle Remus snapped. “Of course your familiar will listen to you Harry, you are a powerful warlock, more powerful than you can imagine!”
“You’re such a good brother,” Harry muttered as he sat up and pulled the tray towards him. “Stupid but good.”
The old god stopped and turned to Blaise. They gave a huge sniff before their eyes glare in anger, “Lucifer! You disgusting angel! How dare you come back to mock me!”
to dance the opening and walk in with a date. I so much wanted that to be Draco, but I didn’t know how to approach him. I simply couldn’t walk up to the prat and declare my love to him! That would be too embarrassing… and too much for both of us. And I was scared, you know. I mean what would happen if he was straight? Would his bullying increase? Would he spread the news that I’m gay? At that moment, the risks just were too much for me to take a chance. So, finding no one else, I’ve brought Parvati Patil… and that was a complete disaster. I mean, Ron and I were forced to watch others dance because I was too scared to ask Draco… and Ron’s too pigheaded at times. We left after our dates ditched us and went outside for a walk. Where we overheard Professor Snape and Karkaroff talking about something coming back… thinking back on it, I think I know what they were talking about, however I don’t want to tell you yet, Cedric. Anyway, on Christmas the next day, Fred and George demanded an update report on what happened the night before. They were a little frustrated that I didn’t tell Draco, or go to him, or even try… however I yelled back at how afraid I was of the consequences if he said no. That was when George told me something, I still don’t really understand. ‘Harry,’ he said, ‘in a Dominant/submissive relationship, you, the submissive, hold all the power. You are the one to call the shots, who decides how far to take it, and who decides when it ends. If you really want this relationship with Malfoy, go and create it. Don’t wait for him to come to you, it just doesn’t work that way.’ I mean, I get the obvious parts, you know like going after Draco, and not waiting for a relationship to happen. What I don’t get is the submissive having the real power, not that it matters much, I suppose.
“The past can be a wicked entity,” he said. “If you would, we can leave it behind. For we have reasons to celebrate, even if there is tragedy. For me, I have found my long lost son just a couple of weeks ago. And though your godson’s family is gone, you and he are still alive, are you not?”
Harry felt something prick at his mind, and automatically he shielded his mind, using the magic he absorbed from the piece of Voldemort’s soul inside him. Voldemort raised an eyebrow but smirked knowingly and proudly. “We’re angry,” Harry said. You’re angry at me, and I’m angry at you. We killed people we cared about, people who were useful to us. I want us to talk, to put everything we did behind us.” Harry swallowed and presented his wand to Voldemort, “I want to show you my loyalty, father.”
His room was almost the size of his entire dormitory in Gryffindor Tower. There was a queen-sized four-poster bed with dark green curtains pressed against the wall with two small nightstands on either side. There was a wardrobe that was large enough for Harry to step inside, all the clothes from his wardrobe in Malfoy Manor somehow already neatly put away in there, as well as some new clothes. Next to the wardrobe were dressers with more clothes, underwear, socks, simple shirts, and the like, and opposite them, under a window, was a desk and a bookcase waiting to be filled.
“Good, then I wish to go over the procedures one last time before it begins,” Mr. Riddle said. “A demon shall walk you down the aisle towards myself and Mr. Malfoy and Blaise. There, I shall conduct the ceremony where you three shall exchange your vows of loyalty to your spouses and our Dark Lord. Afterwards there is the exchange of rings, which I must confess I approve of your choice of rings, I have just saw them, and afterwards you will seal your marriage with a kiss as in tradition. I will say ‘may this kiss bind these two in everlasting marriage’ and your brief, chaste kisses will commence. First it shall be yourself kissing Mr. Malfoy, Mr. Malfoy kissing the Dark Lord’s son, and lastly you shall deal your marriage to the Dark Lord’s Son. Is this all understood?”
“You know a lot of things that Draco doesn’t know yet,” Harry corrected. “But this isn’t about me and him.” He stopped when he heard footsteps and looked up to see Hermione and Ginny walking down into the kitchen. Harry’s nose twitched instantly, and he looked at Hermione.
Draco stared down at Harry, silently considering his question before an egotistic smirk appeared on his beautiful lips. “You’re a submissive,” he said.
“Yeah—yeah, yeah alright, yeah that sounds alright,” Ron nodded. “So uhh—what were you two going to do? Not snogging I hope—not that there’s anything wrong with you two snogging it’s just that I don’t really want to see anybody snogging really, not after her.”
“How can you be so calm?” Ron demanded. “What about you and Malfoy, he gave you one and you two didn’t even have a date technically!”
“Ah! Lucius Malfoy,” Barnabas Cuffe, an elderly man, said. “This is a surprise visit, what can I do for you?”
“I do not care,” Harry replied. He looked up at Draco then back at the snake. “My master… my lover commanded me to bring you out, so I will!” Draco smiled at being called Harry’s master. He patted Harry’s shoulder and looked to where he was staring at. He saw nothing. Still the darkness did not shift. Frustrated, Harry yelled out, “I am your master’s son! His blood runs in my veins now! My will is his, and I demand that you show ourselves!”
The Omega alone, everyone seemed to have no fear or hesitation to stare at him as the pass. They even pressed their noses against the windows to watch him go by. The younger students held up rude finger signs while others help up various copies of
while others were huddled together, making crude reenactments of what clearly was Harry being struck by the Bludger. “Draco!”
“Alright, fine,” the man said, he waved his hand and a dozen collars appeared on the table, “take a look and if you don’t like what you see, we’ll try again,” he said.
Unfortunately, Draco was a little too loud as Parkinson laughed, “Jealous? Of that thing? As if!” She walked down to the trio and sneered at Harry. “Why would I be jealous of a sexless tranny—”
Still no sign. Did they get lost? Did they get escorted privately? Who do they think they are making the world wait like this? There! Do you see? No those were just black-haired children.
“Nothing? Nothing! Then why did Ginny tell me you tried to use a Severing Charm near her?” Mrs. Weasley demanded. “Are you insane?”
One by one, the others went into their beds and though Harry could hear them sleeping, it still eluded him. The pounding in his head gotten worse. He felt as though he was sticking his head into an open fire as an earthquake happened around him. His body felt as though it was being picked by pins and needles everywhere as he failed to get comfortable. He started to sweat. The room felt burning, and with every breath Harry felt vomit building in his throat. He forced himself to sit up, gasping for clean cold air that would push the vomit down. He groaned and clawed at his skin, wishing for it to stop. Tears welled and fell across his cheeks. “Fuck,” he groaned, and he opened his curtain. All the other beds were closed, and everyone was still sleeping.
“As far as I know, yes,” Draco said. “Every coven is full of witches and warlocks. None of this mage stuff, that’s just fantasy.”
“Of course, my puppy,” Voldemort nodded. He turned back to the counter and waited. A moment later, the man returned holding several sheets of paper. Voldemort snatched them all and quickly glanced through them. “These are all?” he asked.
But what can he do? Dumbledore gave a long sigh and sat down in his chair. He cannot continue the lessons, obviously, Harry Potter, he refuses to call him by his father’s name, would be much too suspicious and cautious to even be in the same room with Dumbledore alone. No, if he cannot influence Harry directly, he can still keep an eye on Harry. Watch the boy from a distance, as well as keep an eye on his mail. He figured that it was Potter who brought the Alpha Protein to his father. He would not allow the boy to give more evidence to his father. He will not let Voldemort win.
“I just won’t Harry, that’s all,” Uncle Sirius said. Harry didn’t like that answer, however he stayed quiet about it.
“Uh, kind of,” Ron said, his face redder than his hair. He finally sat up and looked at the two, telling them what happened. “And then I followed the smell to Terry Boot! And instead of flirting and anything I just ran away like a coward! God, what kind of Alpha am I?”
Harry’s mind couldn’t help but go back to his vision of his Lord. “Summoning,” he said. “I want to learn how to summon and contact demons.”
“Thanks?” Ron said questionably, although the blush on his cheeks deepened. “I uh couldn’t stop thinking ‘bout you, actually,” he confessed. “I mean—I had
Harry started to move away but Blaise pushed his head further down Draco’s cock. “Swallow it bitch,” he growled, Harry began swallowing quickly, getting turned on by the name calling. He stayed on Draco’s cock as it pulsed, shooting rope after rope of cum down Harry’s throat until he was spent and Draco pulled his limping cock out of Harry’s mouth. “Clean him.” Blaise ordered and Harry did so. “Good boy,” Blaise muttered.
“Yes he does, Potter this, Potter that—I need to ask Uncle Remus and Uncle Sirius what his problem is,” Harry frowned. “At least Mr. Riddle had the sense to hide however he feels about me.”
Ron grumbled and gave the woman a death glare before walking on. Harry found he walked slower, and his hand kept going to his necklace, lifting it up so he could sense his Alpha. It was still strong with Draco’s scent and it calmed him.
“Of course,” Harry said. He filled Yaxley’s cup as well as his own. Placing the teapot back onto it’s platter, Harry sat down and lifted up his cup. “However, I would rather you did not, we want my future pregnancy to be a surprise. Besides, you did not share with me what it is my father is looking for.”
“Is that a jab against my sexuality, old man?” Draco asked, “At least I am married, and one day will have heirs, unlike yourself. You should hear how my mother speaks of you, poor Yaxley always a suitor…” Draco smirked when he saw a flash of anger appear on the old man’s face. He turned around and shrugged, “Besides, what I am buying matters not to you, it’s for the complete and utter
Mr. Riddle waved his hand, muttering under his breath, and Harry gasped when he saw Parkinson’s other hand was thrust in the air, rusty-looking shackles binding them together, her left hand was in a strange case rendering it useless. She looked as though she was in pain, not bad, but reasonably mild as she fell to the ground. Mr. Riddle saw Harry staring and said, “This is what happens, Mr. Potter, when you are caught breaking rules. I pray that you are more elusive than Miss Parkinson here.”
Bellatrix looked at the knife and nodded, “Alright,” she said, “but I’ll do it myself.” She silently took the knife and examined it carefully. It was sharper than anything she held, with an old, worn out hilt. She looked up at Lilith, “What is going to happen afterwards?” she asked.
Harry frowned at that as they moved through a door, and into a cavernous room that was the kitchen. He slipped from Sirius’ arm, “I’m going to help Mrs. Weasley with the drinks,” he said quickly.
“You’ll accept anything I give you and you will like it,” Harry said, giving his brother a grin. “Anyway, have you made any friends yet in your House?”
“I don’t think we’re there the whole journey!” Hermione said quickly. “Our letters said we just get instructions from the Head Boy and Girl and then patrol the corridors from time to time.”
“Go out with me,” Harry said quickly before catching himself, “Uh I mean—how about you and I hang out tomorrow—for dinner? My treat.”
“Not yet actually…” Draco said, the high of the battle still driving him. “Harry and I wanted to ask you something important, before we were interrupted by that disgusting demon.”
Dumbledore frowned. He looked like he wanted to argue. However, he did his disappointment and sighed, “If that is what you believe, then I hope you all have a good day, Professor Lupin, Mr. Potters.” He nodded his head and stood up. The family only relaxed once he was gone.
“As long as that correction comes with a punishment, I would be down for anything,” Harry purred. “How would you like to punish me, sweetie?”
“And now,” Mr. Riddle said, “we shall have our own read their vows to each other, as they take their final steps towards unholy marriage.”
“Yes,” Remus nodded. “But come on, you need to rest. It’ll take some time, but we will have them.” He helped his Alpha up and Remus prepared himself for the coming months. It would take a long time for them to get the paperwork in order, and in that time he’ll make sure to nurse his Alpha back to health. He wanted the boys to see Sirius as he always was, a strong and happy man. Not this frail shell that Azkaban has made.
good—even got myself a feel,” he winked at Harry. I bet we’ll be going at it before your heat! So you better step up Harry.”
“So, Potter is our Lord’s son,” Lucius muttered. He sniffed the air and frowned, “You are not an Alpha.”
“Yeah of course, I’ll just spend some time with Ginny,” Hermione nodded. “I have other friends than just you two, you know,” she gave Harry a smile. Harry nodded, and looked relieved. “But you know,” he couldn’t help but saying, “if you want, I think Blaise is left by himself too.”
Harry did not move. He found himself too exhausted to react at first, his brain moving slowly to understand what Voldemort just revealed. “How…” he said slowly.
“That I need to explain too,” Harry said. He brought his necklace up, his cheeks blushing madly. “He gave me this yesterday,” he said.
“Sorry, I just can’t get what Mr. Riddle said out of my head,” Uncle Remus frowned, “I’ve been thinking about it all night. I barely gotten a wink of sleep. Sausage, Harry?”
“Carbs are good,” Draco shrugged. “Besides I’m just cooking for the five of us so it should be fine.”
“Oh, okay,” Ron shrugged although both he and Hermione gave Draco a strange, hard look. Draco returned them but said nothing. Instead, he just shrugged and pulled Harry gently. “Come on boywife, let’s go see if we can’t find a private place to relax,” he winked.
“Ron!?” Hermione said, her jaw dropping. “But… are you sure? I mean—” she turned red as Ron looked around at her with a defient expression on his face.
“It seems that Dumbledore has been using this house-elf, who is apparently hero-stricken with Harrison, to lace his food with the protein,” Voldemort said, “which is in the container.”
Harry quickly composed himself. “A prophecy about me and Voldemort,” he muttered to himself. “That is what he’s looking for.” Harry placed his cup down and had another finger sandwich. He looked at Yaxley and smiled, “This was rather informative,” he said, “thank you very much Yaxley.” He stood up and gave a short bow. “I am sorry for all my misbehaviors, and I hope moving forward, that we work together towards our goals.”
“We’ll be here the rest of the day,” Mr. Weasley told his family. “Perk up Weasleys, we should... we should go.” He swallowed heavily and wiped his eyes with his thumbs. Mrs. Weasley refused to let go of George and Cedric. Harry returned to Draco, and looked at him, “Can you eat with us?” he whispered.
Greyback’s eyes focused on Harry, a deathly chuckle rolled in his throat and he spat, the mixture of blood and spit landing on Harry’s cheek. “You bitch,” Greyback cursed. “The Dark Lord’s going to…” life left Greyback’s eyes, and his body slackened.
“Well now, your teaching in this subject has been rather disrupted and fragmented, hasn’t it?” stated Professor Umbridge, turning to face the class with her hands neatly in front of her. “The constant changing of teachers, many of whom do not seem to have followed any Ministry-approved curriculum, has unfortunately resulted in your being far below the standard we would expect to see in your O.W.L. year.
“I have decided upon myself to have an apprentice, a child who is merely a teen, and yet has shown potential, much more potential than some of my very own followers who sit now in this room.” He let the statement sink in, enjoying the looks of shock, embarrassment, and plain self-disappointment sink in as eyes shift from one to another. Voldemort waited, wondering idly who will be the first to speak out? Who will be the first to challenge his decision.
Uncle Sirius and Uncle Remus hesitated, looking at Harry who had a conflicted look on his face. “What is he talking about Harry?” Uncle Remus asked.
“When a person is bitten by a werewolf, their bodies stay the same, for the most part, but your body have went through changes akin to puberty,” Dumbledore said, “your eyesight, for one thing. Another, you did not shift while you were unconscious.”
He smirked as Harry choked on air, his cheeks blushing a deep red. He sat back, looking as composed as ever. “So you see Harry, I’m sure I can handle any meat that New York gives me.”
“What? He knows about Gin and I?” Daphne asked. “I wasn’t expecting it either myself, but man you have to feel the way she kisses!”
“What is it Uncle Remus?” Harry asked, turning to his uncle. Uncle Remus gave a soft smile, “Some good news on this nervous day,” he said. “You know how we’ve always had trouble getting me pregnant… well, after that incident with the first demon… your uncle and I talked and, well, stuff happened and…we’re going to have a baby.” Uncle Remus smiled.
“Not telling,” Theo smiled, “I got you this, by the way.” He pulled out a small present and gave it to Harry. Harry missed the confused look on Draco’s face, but Theo didn’t, the boy giving the blonde and sweet smile.
Ron frowned. “Didn’t want to believe it but I think mum’s spiking your food. Fred and George used to do it, to get them stronger, you know, but to think
The next morning, the Church held an emergency meeting. Harry found himself sitting with his Uncles and Blaise in the front pew with the Malfoys while Mr. Riddle addressed them all. “On yesterday, a day that was supposed to be a celebration, the day of Samhain and celebrating all that Lord Lucifer has given us, we instead found ourselves in the grip of a horror, a monster, a creature of malice intend that comes from neither heaven nor hell. We had one fatality from this attack, Ms. Warrington, who was a good woman, a devout follower, and a loyal member of our community, who never missed a mass in her sixty-seven years. Today we honor her memory, and rejoice for today she has entered Lord Satan’s eternal Paradise in hell…”
“Honestly the two of you,” Hermione whispered, looking away purposefully as Draco pressed his lips against Harry. The two absorbed themselves in the kiss, their homework left forgotten. Hermione cleared her throw several times to get their attention.
“Me neither,” Sirius sighed. “Anyway, how about we go to bed?” He looked at his Omega with a smirk and wiggled his eyebrows, “Come on love, we need practice on keeping you quiet.”
Harry nodded, “Yeah, let me go get my cloak.” He left Hermione in the common room and ran back to his dormitory. He moved to his trunk, only to see that his bed was properly made, unlike the other beds which was still disheveled. On the pillow, wrapped in a gold string, was a letter. Harry’s heart sank. His hand shook in horror as he reached out to the letter, pulling the string and reading the familiar handwriting of his father.
Harry nodded. “Your sorting involves looking into a child’s head for their strongest qualities rather than testing them. In essence, you are saying with your bias that the qualities that Slytherin prefers are wrong and automatically evil. Is that right?”
Draco smirked, “Harry if you ask I’ll sleep with you every night.” Harry couldn’t help but snicker at that. He turned his back to Draco so he can slip the necklace on, his fingers tracing and lingering around his neck. “Beautiful,” he whispered. “My sweet omega.”
The week passed too quickly for Harry’s liking. On the day of the full moon, Mrs. Weasley was in their room with a sudden thought, “Where will you be sleeping tonight, Draco?”
“We thought he was, but after that stupid fucking case, his letters just immediately stopped,” Niall said. He gave a small growl and accidentally stabbed a piece of chicken with his knife too hard. “Sorry. Just can we please move on to something different? Please.”
for himself, and pulled out a toy snitch for Niall who let it fly around the room before snatching it out of the air, not even leaving his seat sometimes.
“Cease your infernal yapping,” Voldemort demanded. Uncle Vernon opened his mouth as though he was yelling, but no sound came out. He tried again and again but no matter how purple his face turned or how tightly his balled his fists, no sound came out of him. “Harry, call the other two here,” Voldemort commanded but he did not need to as a second later Mrs. Dursley walked in wearing industrial rubber gloves and a night coat, obviously in the middle of doing dishes, and Dudley walked in front the stairs. “Who are you?” he asked, “Dad!” He said, his eyes growing when he saw his father gasping for air.
“Oh good, Weasley has a stalker,” Draco drawled. “If you want to be a third wheel, you are more than welcomed, I guess.”
“I think I know exactly what kind of ideas you are thinking of Mr. Potter, I am not impressed,” Draco said, “you are much more likable when we were just talking about how much better Roxas is than Sora.”
“Well, in case you couldn’t sense it, I just happen to be an Omega myself,” Lavender smiled, “so I was wondering if you were doing anything tomorrow?”
“Speak little of it Harry,” Voldemort said. “I still do not know what to do with that situation. For now, however, I am planning on giving Dumbledore a distraction as I continue my research into what he is looking for in the Ministry of Magic.”
When the time was up, Harry snapped out of his trance and looked up from his potion. Through the fumes and heat he was sweating, yet his hair somehow didn’t look out of place at all, and his skin looked like it had a healthy glow instead of being drenched which he saw that some of the Gryffindors, as well as Crabbe and Goyle, looked. He then looked at his own table. They all made the potion, however, and not to brag, it was clear to Harry that his was the best of the four with Malfoy’s begrudgingly being a close second.
What surprised Harry even more so was that the Dark Lord seemed to be following Hogwarts curriculum with the other subjects he taught Harry, going over the spells in an overview that Harry learned in his fourth year. The Dark Lord was pleased that Harry wasn’t an imbecile in Transfiguration and Charms, which they both went over in ninety minutes; however, Harry did feel that the Dark Lord was disappointed in his progress, and that made the boy himself feel disappointed as well.
“Then he should have stayed there,” Ron said. “I don’t want a filthy Malfoy in my home! He’s a Death Eater junior!”
The three were silent for a moment. Blaise looked at Harry hesitantly before saying, “Well… now you won’t be scared when you’re in trouble with him? Eh?”
“It was for the greater good,” Dumbledore said. “Harry Potter was safe with the Dursleys, as long as he considered the place home and the muggles his family.”
“So you will kill all my followers Harry? Do not back down, you have almost killed me, and you would have killed the Unspeakable in the summer. Do not deny it, I know it is true. Your hands are stained, but still you have not killed,” Voldemort said. He looked back at the plans before them. “So tell me… who will you kill first?”
“He and Draco are dating now apparently. They hooked up over the summer,” Blaise said, petting Harry’s hair.
“Well, we’re reading just now,” Professor Umbridge said. “If you have other queries we can deal with them at the end of class.”
The Dark Lord healed himself and cleaned the knife before putting it away, “Come Harry, it is ready now,” Voldemort said. Harry looked and saw Voldemort waiting, steam dancing from the potion, twisting and spiraling with one another as it rose in the air, releasing more of that musky smell that Harry found pleasant. An old chalice appeared before him, and the potion filled itself into it. Harry grasped the chalice and looked at Voldemort. “Breathe in the vapors, let the smell penetrate your being and drink,” Voldemort said, he looked down at the cauldron, “you must drink all that is in here.”
“Just last week, we lost a bright student to a terrible thing,” Professor Umbridge said, “The Ministry have informed us to remind you all, that life can be hard, cruel, it can even feel as though the entire world is your enemy. However, turning to substances and abusing them? That is not the answer. Fred Weasley felt the weight of the world, and fell to abuse under it’s weight and—”
“Good,” Theo smiled he lifted his as well, and the two Omegas lightly scented each other, giving a satisfied mewl. “I hope your bed was comfortable.”
“Oh, Harry!” Mrs. Weasley said. She rushed around the table and smothered Harry in a hug. “It’s not your fault sweetie,” she said, “you had no control.” She pulled a chair by them and sat down so she could still hug Harry.
“Well, Voldemort wins, it’ll be worse, much worse. The most extreme beliefs you grew up on will be established I fear…” Harry said.
“Some things came up,” Harry said, he glanced at Blaise and Daphne before leaning towards Draco, “I’ll tell you about it later when we’re alone.”
Draco kissed Harry’s cheek and shook his head, “Come on boy,” he said, “let’s go live our ‘normal lives’ now.” He took Harry’s hand and led him out of the dungeon.
“Mayhaps, young Draco,” Yaxley said, “however the shops here hold none of the frivolous things your kind enjoy.”
Ron’s eyes went huge when he understood what Harry was saying. “Bet the slimy bastard felt rather cocky when you told him that,” he muttered.
“What kind of services?” Harry asked. For some reason he found that he could not get out of his bed. He was frozen sitting up, staring at the dark figure. It seemed to move, enveloping more of the room as the moonlight faded away, yet Harry could tell that the central figure of the essence stayed completely still.
“he applied for a desk job so he could come home and work for the Order,” Fred explained. “He says he misses the tombs, but,” he smirked, “there are compensations…”
“Yeah,” Harry blushed, nodding. “But I have a question, Professor,” he said, turning to Dumbledore. “Whenever I’m close to Draco I feel relaxed, but whenever we are away, I still feel connected to him, if not a little on edge. It’s nothing serious but, I was just worrying, what will happen if we stay separated for a long period of time?”
“The Omega brings the bread and jelly while you bring the peanut butter. Alone you can’t have a full sandwich, but when you work together, you’re able to make the sandwich. It is kind of the same with Alphas and Omegas and their heats and ruts. Both the Alpha and the Omega need to work together to make the Omega pregnant.”
“I don’t know, my parents have been asking that for twenty years,” Harry smirked. “But I can give you a few ideas if you really need them, Draco.”
The waiter gasped and looked between Harry and Draco for a moment before smiling broadly, “He’s a keeper Harry,” he winked.
“I’m not wearing cologne,” Ron said. Harry just grinned and laughed. Ron stared at him confused before realizing what Terry said. A huge grin shone on his face. “See! Told you I could do it,” he said confidently.
“Wait, you don’t mean—” Draco gasped. Harry nodded. He turned to Draco with a serious look on his face. “Yes, I do mean that. I’ve already told Mr. Riddle when he asked me I wanted to learn Summoning. It may be an advanced subject… however I just know I can do it… if I had help of course.”
“Good question,” Uncle Remus said, he looked between the three of them, “Well, you all are marrying each other for this trick so… I would suggest that Blaise propose to both of you, or the three of you propose to each other. The only differences would be just determining who is waiting by the alter, and who is walking up to it.”
“Oh dear,” Mrs. Weasley said, now facing Harry. “Well, Dumbledore will be here later for a checkup, make sure to tell him this,” she said. “as well as fix anything you might have broken.”
Harry went silent on that. He shook his head, “Just family stuff,” he muttered but still frowned. He looked up at the Gryffindor table to see that Niall was looking just as concerned. They nodded to each other, silently telling the other to wait for him when breakfast was done. He looked around and asked generally, “Has this stuff happened before with any of you? Your letters missing or not arriving?”
Harry’s uncles nodded, and Mr. Garrison walked towards them. “We can talk in the dining room,” Uncle Sirius said, the three of them going through a closed door. Harry watched until the door closed behind Mr. Garrison, and returned to the living room where Draco and Blaise were.
“No problem just don’t be loud,” Dean shrugged, causing Seamus to snicker. Ron, however, looked horrified.
Luck shone on Draco a few minutes later when he saw a banner that was deep red with a golden lion hanging from a building that read
“Whatever you do, don’t mention Percy in front of Mum and Dad,” Ron told harry in a tense voice. “Every time he’s mention, Dad breaks whatever he’s holding and Mum starts crying.”
“Yeah, you are,” Blaise nodded. “I have no idea who sent Mr. Garrison… however right now I’m just happy that everyone is safe.”
“Hmm… after that I remember screaming, loud noises. I just wanted to sleep, to try and just figure out what happened. Dumbledore was by us; they were bringing you to the Hospital Wing, but Professor Moody took me away to his office alone. We talked… he was too keen on Voldemort, I think… I can’t remember much, it’s all just noise after we returned. Dumbledore barging in… McGonagall and Snape with him. I think… I remember seeing Moody change, but I didn’t understand it. He was a Death Eater in disguise as Moody. However, that catches us up. The Death Eater pretending to be Moody is locked away somewhere, you and I are safe and Voldemort is back. What happens next is anyone’s guess… but I can tell you that I am scared.
“I’m sorry for not believing you,” she apologized again. Harry smiled at the Alpha and took a bite of his breakfast.
“Harry… I do believe I heard you promised to kill my servant,” Voldemort said. Their eyes still connected, Harry felt a pain in his head, far deeper than before, originating from somewhere unknown as Voldemort hissed softly. “Yes… plenty of anger indeed… so much darkness that Dumbledore does not know about. So much anger… and a want to submit, but to who?” Voldemort stepped towards Harry. The boy tried to struggle but for some reason he couldn’t turn away. All he could do was to stare at Lord Voldemort’s red eyes as the monster continued to his into the air. The feeling delved deeper inside Harry. He couldn’t understand it.
“No!” Harry said furiously; it was crucial that Ron understood, “I wasn’t dreaming. … not an ordinary dream … I was there, I saw it—I did it…”
“Yeah, with your transformation,” Ginny smiled. Harry frowned. His mind went back to what happened a month ago, how Connor almost died and he was forced to turn, how he had no control over his body and its reactions. He felt disgusted and ashamed. “Lucky,” he spat out.
“It’s not marked up precisely,” Blaise said, “more like tattooed to show he’s under my protection… and that he and Draco belong to me.”
“Well, to begin, there is a ring ceremony to start the official courting session,” Uncle Remus said. He held out his hand and pointed to a silver band with a dark blue middle, “This is what your uncle gave me when we started our courting. It is basically the beginning to a marriage planning. This session should last at a minimum of two months, and at maximum of two years, most usually last five months, as that is what is deemed socially appropriate. It is during this period that the marriage can start to officially be recognize and officially begin planning.”
Draco realized what Harry wanted to do and nodded, giving his Omega a sadistic smirk. Harry stepped away, clearing his mind of his Alpha as he tried to think of every horrible interaction he had. The jeer and howls, smelling Cormac’s arousal and the boys constantly goading him, mocking him for sex. He felt his anger grow, reaching out from inside of him as well as something else, something foreign yet familiar. It was power, great power, and Harry needed it in that moment. He found the seventh year who called out and recognized him as Urquhart, Slytherin’s new Quidditch Captain. He pulled his wand out and barely pointed his wand at the teen before he hissed out,
A wand-tip flared, illuminating the hall with magical light. Harry blinked. The people below were crowded around the foot of the stairs, gazing intently up at him, some craning their necks for a better look. Remus Lupin stood nearest to him. Though still quite young, Lupin looked tired and rather ill; he had more gray hair than when Harry had said good-bye to him, and his robes were more patched and shabbier than ever. Nevertheless, he was smiling broadly at harry, who tried to smile back through his shock.
Smiling, Harry agreed and the two sped down the rest of the stairs, out of the tower, into the main room of the Academy, out the front door, and down the cobblestone path into the forest. Harry instantly found his way and took lead as they ran through the trees, ending up half an hour later at the back door of the Black House.
“No,” Remus said. He stood up and said, “I’m going to bed. Goodnight Harry.” And with that, he left.
“Of course it is, but this is just idiot boy,” Mrs. Lestrange said. “He’s a man, he can take it, right, idiot boy?”
They stopped at a perfectly normally looking bookstore, much to Harry’s surprise, and Draco held the door open for him. “Obviously I’ll do the talking,” he said. He glanced at Harry for a moment, “Hold still,” he commanded. Draco pressed his wand against Harry’s neck. He felt a thick leather wrapping around it, before resting comfortably. Smirking at it, Draco pocketed his wand, “There,” he said.
Harry nodded and stepped away, muttering another apology. “Yes,” he said, and he began telling his father everything that happened in Dumbledore’s office. He slowly pulled out the ring and glanced up. “He saw you in my mind and I ran. The only good thing is that I was able to get this out as I ran away. I’m sorry, father. Truly.”
“Well, sit down,” she said, pointing toward a small table draped in lace beside which she had drawn up two straight-backed chairs. Two pieces of blank parchment lay on the table, apparently waiting for them.
“I did,” Draco said, “and I want to talk with you about it. Privately.” The grunt nodded and stood up. Draco led him away from the main room and up to their dormitories. The room was empty, and Draco hung back as Goyle walked in. It was also oddly dark inside, with barely enough light for Draco to see in front of him. If there was any doubt in Draco’s mind, they quickly were washed away as he faced the boy. He would not kill him, no, he knew that even if he boasted about it he could never kill anyone, but that doesn’t mean he can’t harm the idiot.
Harry nodded. He placed the ring on Draco’s finger and said, “With this ring I name myself yours. I am your lover, your submissive, and your husband. I will take care of you as you take care of me. Obey you as you command me. And love you as you love me.” The ring on Draco’s finger glowed as Harry’s. Voldemort waved his wand around the two hands. The glow grew in strength and two small orbs trailed from the rings, hovering for a moment before following Voldemort’s wands, entwining and twisting around both hands, their trails of light dancing with one another until, with a twitch of the wand, they shot towards Harry and Draco’s chest, a warm sensation growing around their hearts.
“Thank you my Lord,” Harry said softly, “and… thank you, for sharing that with me. I… I’ll live up to be like Alphard.”
He didn’t know how long he was picking through the pile, looking desperately for familiar words. He picked up a rather small piece and turned it over, seeing one word in a familiar scrawl.
“No—not at all,” Harry lied, trying to get the flashes of his late night activities out of his mind. Particularly the image of Draco Malfoy.
“The Pureblood Society is nothing, means nothing. It is just hatred, an old and pitiful hatred longing for a past that never existed. You look to the Dark Arts, to my father to bring back your superiority, and instead fall into a dangerous and fatal ideology, become a slave to a man whose concerns are only for his own power. The muggleborns and half-bloods did not make you weak—you have! All of you in your disgusting beliefs have made yourself weaker! And I for one cannot wait to watch you all fall. For without you—without the Parkinsons, the Crabbes, the Goyles, the Greengrasses—without the whole lot of you! Those who rely on hatred and bigotry and call it superiority, with you dead, the world will become a better place. So thank you for coming to my and Draco’s wedding, I hope you all choke.”
Draco was silent as he thought and Harry wouldn’t dare look up until the Malfoy decided on his answer. When he did, it was minutes later, and he answered with a question. “How far are you willing to go? Look at me when you answer.”
“I see,” Professor McGonagall nodded. “Well, I know your father has stated that you wish to be undisturbed, however, I am afraid that I have to repeat his warning, Mr. Riddle and Mr. Malfoy. While you are students here at Hogwarts, I ask that you do not speak to any reporters or say anything false that gives Hogwarts, the school, a bad reputation.”
“See you, boyfriend,” Harry smiled. They kissed again and Draco left. Blaise stood up and followed him, “I’ll walk him out,” he said to Uncle Remus and Uncle Sirius.
“Big words Blaise,” Draco said. “You better be a good teacher, because so far it seems we’re not getting a proper education according to you.”
“It was Terry’s idea!” Ron said defensively. “Besides, he told me that he could eat more than me! I had to prove him wrong! It was like an Alpha thing!”
Time to self-promote shamelessly. Did you know I'm writing a Harry/Draco that *isn't* rated M? I know, scandalous! It is called The Slytherin Prince and please give it a try if you have the time.
“But I feel weak! I mean I’m used to danger!” Harry complained, “I’m used to people trying to kill me! Voldemort, Wormtail, death eaters—a bloody dragon even tried to eat me! But because of what Greyback did to me—to us, I feel worthless! Weak. Pathetic. Just the thought of him sends me stiff and I can’t move or—”
“Harry! What’s the matter?” Draco said, jumping up. His omega stopped directly in front of him, almost crashing into the Alpha. He panted, as though he just ran a mile, and held up the stack of letters. “My letters… from Viktor,” he said.
Harry took his and scurried away back down to the Slytherin dungeons where he found Draco lounging lazily by the fire. “Draco!” He said quickly, running towards him.
Mrs. Krum pulled Harry and Niall into a tight hug and she looked at Harry’s hair, “Your hair it is beautiful! But too dull and black, you should have it be colorful like your brother’s,” she said.
“I’m alright at it,” Niall shrugged. “Not as great as Harry, however. He’s always been the top of our class since the first day. And it’ll only be a matter of time until he’s the top here too—sorry Hermione.”
“Ge—get off of him you idiots! He’ll kill all three of us!” Malfoy panicked, grabbing the nearer flunky and pulling him off. Crabbe and Goyle didn’t move immediately, too stupid to understand orders Harry thought, before jumping up as Draco yelled, “Move you idiots!” He pushed them out of the compartment and gave Harry one final, scared look. “This isn’t over Potter—I’ll get an explanation out of you.” And, with a drop of Harry’s wand and letter, he ran away.
“You really want to call the Dark Lord’s son a cheap whore, Parkinson?” Daphne asked. “I don’t exactly think that is a good idea.”
“Enough chatter!” Mr. Riddle demanded. The talking died instantly, and everyone turned to look at Mr. Riddle. “Now, face your partners, but do not touch. Ladies! This is Samhain, you are offering yourselves to Lord Lucifer and his demons, boys you are the demons preparing your partner for your master. Give him your praise and this chaste offering.” He moved towards an old record player and turned it on. A hauntingly violin music started playing, the tempo slow and suggestive. Mr. Riddle let it play a bit before moving to the two circles. “Partners will face each other. Now in the dance, boys, you will take lead, leading your partner through the circle, dancing to make the ritual complete, with each twirl and each rotation the girl becomes purer and purer until she is ready for the Dark Lord’s blessing. Then, at the end, to fully glorify his name, you will create his symbol. Potter, Parkinson, Weasley, Brown, and Greengrass, you five will be the points. Potter will be the top point and the rest will follow in a clockwise manner. Now, pay close attention as my wife and I shall demonstrate the dance.”
“So like you want your father to meet your potential omega?” Harry asked, his cheeks turning pink as well. He thought for a moment and nodded. “Do it.”
He glared at them all and moved back to his throne. “One more thing, I want any and all information on who Peverell is, along with any information and whispers about the Elder Wand. That is all, now clean away the bodies.” He waved his hand dismissively. Crabbe and Goyle ran up the bodies, bowing first to Harry, and dragged them away. One by one, the Death Eaters stepped up to Harry, kissing his feet and hand before leaving until it was just himself and Mr. Malfoy.
“Ron texted all of us about the food, I hope you’re not mad about it Draco,” Neville said, his cheeks turning red.
Voldemort thought for a moment, debating internally, before nodding, “What I say now will not leave this room, understand Harry?” The boy nodded meekly. “I have the diary, which is now gone, a ring that was from my mother’s family… I stole it from my grandfather and killed my father and his parents to create my second Horcrux. After that, I have went and looked for relics of Hogwarts’ Founders, four items that they left to their descendants. Slytherin, a locket, Ravenclaw, a diadem, Hufflepuff, a cup, and Gryffindor, a sword. Each with their own history, each with their own relevance. The locket, the cup, and diadem I have found, and with each I have killed and split my soul even furthered, creating them into my Horcruxes. I now have five, but there was one more… one that was made by mistake, coincidental, a Horcrux whose soul of mine chose… you, Harry. You are my Final Horcrux.”
Powerful freezing winds burst into the church. The doors were flung open and the windows shattered as hail and hard snow rushed in, beating and packing onto the monster. It snarled and tried to move however its body was quickly freezing. Ice formed on its pale skin, the body moved sluggishly before stopping completely, a full inch of ice covering the whole creature, it’s mouths all frozen open, the first head’s ice was stained red while the others were purely transparent.
The demon stared at Harry’s hand, his red eyes going from an inquisitive look, to shock, then glee in a span of ten seconds. “My my… so you’re Harry Potter,” the demon purred. “Tell me Potter, why have you tried to summon my Father?”
He obeyed, ignoring the pain as he stood to his feet, his head still looking down. “Look at me.” He finally looked up. “You seem a natural Harry,” Voldemort chuckled, his red eyes twinkling with a forbidden knowledge Harry wasn’t privy to. “You did not scream or try to escape… I feel you should be rewarded.”
They walked across the main grounds of Hogwarts, getting away from the main building, which Ron pointed out was where all the professor’s offices were as well as every other kind of office a university needed, and turned a corner to a small little community of shops, a small café next to a bookstore and even a diner. Ron grinned and gestured towards them, “All student-run,” he said proudly. “Hermione’s got the bookstore down pack, that’s Flourish and Blotts, she’s another friend she’s very smart, top in all her classes! Weird she hangs out with us but she’s cool.”
There were a couple of tables outside, all full of families or couples. Harry parked in the free spot right in front and smirked at a little kid who watched in awe. Harry helped Draco off and smiled at him as he offered his hand.
“And I feel for your plight, truly,” Niall said, “but I am not that teacher. You all may believe that I’m like the Boy Who Lived or whatever they call me—but I never cared for any of that. I’m Niall Potter first and foremost. My biggest priority is none of you but looking after my younger brother. And followed directly behind is now my Omega, who we just had an amazing first date so please don’t ruin my mood from that.” He sighed and stretched in the chair before standing up. “Look, I’m sure the Umbridge problem will solve itself. My brother is stubborn, and we’ll either get rid of her his way or mine, so it’s not really that much of a terrible problem.”
The three days Draco claimed that he’ll have Harry under his thumb pasted quickly. The most they advanced was that Harry started kissing Draco’s cheek whenever the blonde teen did something good or nice for the Weasleys. After Dumbledore’s visit, Draco seemed to be working his hardest to try to be polite to the Weasleys. He started by apologizing to Ron and Hermione, Ron wanting him to list every single thing he had done against the trio (being a massive prick coming up multiple times) before Ron even thought to smile at him. Hermione was a little more forgiving, but Harry could still sense that there was a huge tension between her and Draco. The only real problem Harry found was with Ginny.
Harry looked as though he was on the verge of crying, however he held it in as he wiped his eyes. Sniffing, he got up and followed Blaise towards his bed where they both sat against the foot of. “Remember Harry, deep breaths, each one you’re falling deeper and deeper,” Blaise said, “I’ll be doing it with you two.”
Draco stared at the beautiful and sorrowful omega in front of him, and he felt his heart throb. He stood up from his seat and took the few steps to Harry. The boy looked up at him, curious, and Draco took his bandaged hand gently and got on his knees. “Harry,” Draco purred. “Please, let me help.”
“Especially because they’re asking about Neville,” Harry added, frowning. “Um, father, what exactly are you going to do?”
“Fine then, we won’t send the boys to Hogwarts, simple as that,” Sirius nodded, “however where do you think we should send them? Because I am definitely not sending them to America.”
He would return after dinner, that was Voldemort’s decision, so Mrs. Malfoy had the house elves make all of Harry’s favorite, no matter how “low-class” Mr. Malfoy said they were. Draco pulled Harry away after dinner, bringing him to the garden.
Nagini stared at Harry for a moment. She pressed her head against Harry’s cheek in an almost soothing motherly way.
“No really, Molly … thanks anyway … Good night, everyone.” Tonks hurried past Dumbledore and Harry into the yard; a few paces beyond the doorstep, she turned on the spot and vanished into thin air. Harry noticed that Mrs. Weasley looked troubled.
“Hello Typhon,” Harry cooed. Draco allowed the dragon to jump off his arm onto Harry’s bed and the two teens crouched in front of it. “Aren’t’ you a cutie?” Harry said, stroking the underside of Typhon’s head.
“What do you mean?” Harry asked. Draco took out his wand, and with a wave, Harry’s clothes and the bed sheets were cleaned. Harry muttered a thank you as Draco move to sit down with him.
“For distracting me,” Theo said. “I still don’t know how to feel about my father. I’m sad that he’s dead, but he was also a Death Eater. I hated him, hated You-Know-Who but yet… I’m happy that now I have you. And when the time comes, I’ll make sure to wife you up.” He gave a smirking chuckle which caused Ron to gasp.
Niall laughed, “You actually support them? But they’re like the worst last season!” he said. “They haven’t won anything since, what, 1738?”
you lot or else!” She threatened her family. The Weasley clan stood up, as did the Diggorys, Finnigans, and Changs. One by one their voices added to the spell; their hands outstretched.
“What—no!” Draco yelled. Fenrir chuckled and stepped towards Draco. Draco stepped away, only to be hurt by a Cruciatus Curse from Voldemort. His screams filled the room as Greyback closed in on him.
Silence fell on them again and Harry’s mind started to turn. Is this because of the werewolf thing or the gay thing? He’s still himself, still Harry so why does everything feel so weird? So awkward between them now?
Harry held his hand out and Draco slipped the golden ring on his finger, repeating after Voldemort, “With this ring I name you mine, you are my lover, my submissive, and my husband. I will take care of you, as you take care of me. Command you as you obey me. And love you as you love me.” The ring glowed on Harry’s finger, and he felt a warm sensation.
he thought, and his stare turned cold. “I do not see how my past relations are any matter to you,” he sneered. “If anything, if I were you I would be more worried about that ridiculous thing you call hair. Did you actually think you would look cute with pigtails at fifteen, darling, or is your eyesight worse than mine?”
“Like how can you and Draco start dating after the both of you basically bullied and argued for four years,” Blaise said. Harry blushed and nodded.
The sight of Hogwarts brought a smirk to the werewolf. He closed his eyes and inhaled deeply, smelling the fresh, pure smells of unspoiled children, and among them was his bitch. “Just you wait, bitch,” Greyback growled, “I’ll have you soon enough. Though you’ve been a naughty bitch, maybe I’ll have you watch while I have a child or two before I put you where you belong.”  There was a snap behind him. Greyback jumped and turned to see what was behind him, seeing only nothing. His eyes narrowed and he sniffed the air.
“Good… because I want us to taste it a lot… by the end of the year boys, I want you two to be addicted to cum and cock from the three of us,” Blaise smirked. “And your pussy was so great Harry…have to remind me later on, I’ve read about some spells to make it feel even better.”
“They wouldn’t shut up, but I’ll live,” Niall chuckled. “Just be good, okay Harry? And be careful if any Alpha tries to get his way.”
The man jumped slightly and looked at Voldemort, “I don’t know what—” he began before his cheeks turned to red. “Oh, I see,” he said. “Is that what this is about?”
“Don’t say his name!” Harry yelled and Niall flinched. Harry blinked and whimpered. “I’m sorry,” he said in a softer voice. “I just, I don’t know. He was our friend but…”
“Good gracious, it’s getting dark already! I didn’t notice they lit the lamps! You’d better go and change into your robes, all of you. McLaggen, you must drop by and borrow that book on nogtails. Harry, Blaise, Draco—any time you’re passing. Same goes for you, miss,” he twinkled at Ginny. “Well, off you go, off you go!”
He never found hers. He looked and looked, taking careful care to look at each scrap, reading the words and putting them in a different pile ten times over, but instead, all he found were hurtful words, baseless accusations, and small parts of Ron’s letter. It was impossible to put together. From what he found, Ron mentioned The Burrow and hoping to see Harry soon along with something about Bill and Ron’s second gender.
“Okay,” Harry nodded. “I know you’ll win.” He looked back at the others before turning to Viktor. He quickly kissed Viktor’s cheek and licked his lips nervously, “Good luck,” he whispered and ran back to the others. Sirius took Harry as Remus took Niall. The boys said goodbye to the Krums, Niall squeezing Viktor’s hand hard when they shook. Then, they were gone, walking back to the castle.
His cheeks reddened immensely as he stumbled on, “Ron was just thinking that, uh, since you’re half-Italian that you’ll be happy with Olive Garden after.”
Twilfitt jumped once more and turned to Harry. “If—If the kind sir would just step this way?” he said fully nervous. Harry nodded and offered a smile as he followed the man, Draco, and Voldemort trailing behind. He motioned for Harry to stand on a podium and he quickly started to take measurements until he stopped. “Um, sir... these clothes, they are three sizes too big,” he said hesitantly. “I cannot properly measure him without—”
Voldemort chuckled. “How quickly you go from murderous to curious,” he said. “If I did know any better Potter, it would seem as though you were trying to figure a way to kill your own father.”
“Ginny and I went shopping for a little bit, I uh… talked with her, and I think she’s starting to get around the idea of you and Malfoy, Harry,” Hermione said. “That and everything that is coming out about Professor Dumbledore.” She looked nervous, as though she was stepping on eggshells.
Mr. Malfoy stood up and said, “Mr. Potter is venting his frustrations at the poor quality of learning that Professor Umbridge has provided along with the heinous and cruel matter of her punishments. Which we can see in great detail in his written account of the matter.”
He could hear a howl behind him. His feet hurt as they pressed hard against the cold ground, roots and acorns mixing with the grass unseen. He was slowed, only because he was rooting through his pockets, until he managed to pull out his wand. Giving a breath of relief, he turned over his shoulder and shouted,
“Well actually,” he started, “I’ve gotten an interesting letter from my friend Ron. It seems that he is actually an Alpha. I think. I’ve gotten howlers because of what that Skeeter woman wrote and accidentally torn his letter along with them.”
“Not enough to be sloshing, but enough to declare without embarrassment that you are really hot,” Harry said.
“Yes Alpha,” Harry muttered. He walked away from Ron and stood in front of Draco. The Alpha immediately grabbed his boy, turning him around and pressing his back to his chest, crossing his arms around the boy protectively, resting his head on Harry’s shoulder. “Weasley,” he said in a far more civil tone, “I am sorry for everything I have done to you and your family.”
“Exactly,” Uncle Sirius nodded. “And if it is your father, Blaise, than tradition and social etiquette will dictate that he brings Harry successfully to you. After that, the demon disappears, however if it is your father than he will then move to sit on the groom’s… your side, which is another thing since there are three of you…”
“Don’t worry Hermione, since when have I ever done anything rash?” Harry asked, giving a joking smile. Hermione gave him a look that caused him to laugh, “I promise I won’t do anything,” he said. Hermione relaxed and the three went on to lunch.
The day seemed to go by in a blur. He wrote two letters in History of Magic, writing about Viktor in one and going into full detail about the detentions in another. Then in Potions, he has gotten his moonstone essay back with a large elegant black O scrawled in an upper corner.
“You know Harry,” Uncle Sirius said lightly, “after finding out that Draco takes his tea and coffee exactly as I do, I think you’ve made a good choice in dating him.”
The dance for the holiday was brutally slow at some places, yet at others the steps made Harry want to blush. Mr. Riddle was not lying when he said that parts of the dance were seduction, seduction on the female… or Harry’s part on the men. He found himself getting close with Draco, the two pressing their bodies together, Draco leading while Harry follows, it was sexual, embarrassing, and if Harry wasn’t constantly worried about what Mr. Riddle was planning, he would have found it fun.
With a whine, he closed his eyes and started to imagine his male friends taking place of his fingers, switching to every male he knew until, with a flash of Draco Malfoy, he came. Ropes of cum drenching him as he rode the greatest and longest orgasm he ever had.
Magic filled the air, their own magic. It swirled and danced around each other, tangling, and morphing into a single entity before falling down into the Alpha and his omega. They continued to cum and continued to bite as they rode out this magical high until their last spirts of cum dribbled from their cocks. Finally, they moved from the other’s neck and stared at each other. Their lips were bloodied, and faces were soaked with sweat. Smiling to each other, they kissed, the blood still in their mouths mixing with each other as they swallowed. They moved slightly, so that Harry could sit comfortably with Draco’s knotted cock still in him. Panting heavily, they smiled as their instincts informed the two of them what happened. “Mate,” Harry breathed.
“Then eat as much as you can, don’t force yourself to finish it,” Niall said. “Just eat it, okay?” He looked at his watch and cursed. “I have to go.”
Harry looked hesitant but began to roll up his sleeve, showing his inner forearm where his growing mark laid. “It keeps growing…” he said, “I don’t know what it will be when it’s finished but… I don’t think I can hide it soon. I’m Voldemort’s apprentice. Sooner or later, everyone will know.”
“NO!” He yelled a little too loud. He stopped, seeing others were looking at him and blushed, “No,” he said softer, “god no—I’m not pregnant. We didn’t even do anything together!” He leaned close and frowned. “Look—it’s not about Draco, okay. I can’t talk about it now, but can you please trust me when I say he is good?”
“To stop you from marrying my dad,” Blaise said, “It’s so fucking obvious—marry me—and Draco—both of us! Become our wife!”
“Of course,” Uncle Remus said, the two men gave Harry one final hug, “everything will go right today Harry,” Uncle Remus whispered, “you’ll see.” But still that did not calm a violent flood that was storming in Harry’s stomach.
He was dismissed, and followed the shadow-walker back to his room in Privet Drive. Harry waited until the shadow-walker was fully gone, checking every corner he could, before putting the potion on his dresser. He finally allowed his frown to drop as he stared at the potion. Harry felt troubled. The potion taunted him, gleaming an evil green in the moonlight as he considered it. He hated the Dursleys, that was nothing new, but using a potion on them? It sounded wrong… having them forced against their will to listen to him, to follow any and all commands he could usher… that didn’t sit right with Harry. He didn’t want that power, he didn’t want to force this onto them.
His body felt smooth, powerful, and flexible. He was gliding between shining metal bars, across dark, cold stone… He was flat against the floor, sliding along on his belly. …It was dark, yet he could see objects around him shimmering in strange, vibrant colors. …he was turning his head. …At first glance, the corridor was empty … but no… a man was sitting on the floor ahead, his chin drooping onto his chest, his outline gleaming in the dark. …
“I mean—you were the top of the class in our Dark Arts lessons,” Harry said, “When I lost that is… maybe they think you’re a big hero and would do it because they asked? Or like maybe House loyalty.”
“Okay,” Harry said, his cheeks blushing as a heat grew inside him. He reached out for the plug but Draco stopped him.
“I am very happy,” Voldemort said, “our little Harrison has given us a very important gift.” He pointed to the letter and container. Remus picked up the letter and read it quickly.
He broke down. He dropped the soap and cried openly, shaking as his tears blurred his vision even more. Sirius rushed to Harry and pulled him tightly into his embrace. Harry cried on his shoulder, “I messed up,” he said weakly. “I’m sorry Sirius, I messed up.”
“I’ll see you tomorrow Harry… I’ll escort you to classes like normal,” Draco said. He and Harry kissed briefly, the kiss itself only lasting a couple seconds before Draco regained his cocky smile. “See you, my dear.”
“We were just expecting the one,” James chuckled, “but yeah, we have.” He looked at his wife, who smiled and looked down at their precious sons. She lifted their older son slightly and the Healer poised to write his name, “Niall Sirius Potter,” Lily said, “and Harry James Potter.”
“You will obtain for me a Potion of Obedience,” the Dark Lord said. “However, you are not allowed to inform anyone about this manner.”
“I know, and we won’t,” Blaise said. “There has to be a way to keep him away from our Harry…” the two thought for a moment.
Harry nodded, and just leaned against the sink. Even as he heard screaming from above, it was Mrs. Weasley, Harry didn’t find it in him to run out and check. He just stood there against the sink breathing, focusing on his breath and yet miles away. He still felt awful when he went to bed that night, wishing, deeply, that he would never wake up.
The next day, the three went to school early to look in the Academy’s library. Focusing on traditions of marriages, they began to comb over old books and texts, looking for a loophole or way out of Harry’s predicament.
Harry shook his head, “It’s because of my scar, Dumbledore kept the monthly problem to himself as did I,” he said. “Slughorn kept going on about my scar, and how I’m ‘the Chosen One’ as the
“You’re right,” Draco nodded. “Just make them understand we’re stronger.” He wrote down the names, as well as two more. “The Carrow twins,” he said. “Mother and father told me horror stories about those two. They are sadistic and mad like the others. There is also Rowle, Thorfinn Rowle… and Gibbon… I cannot remember his first name.” Harry nodded and looked at the list, counting.
“We’re not betraying you,” Harry said, his voice back to normal. He stood tall by Draco, glaring at his father. “I told you what was going to happen. I told you that I will kill your followers. This is how. You may think it’s cowardly, but this is how Draco and I will kill them.”
“Boy could be useful,” Moody grumbled, getting their attention from the corner. “You said you made a plan, eh? What is it?”
“You’re thinking too much,” a sleep voice grunted. Harry glanced up to see Draco looking at him through sleep-ridden eyes.
Dumbledore knocked on the door half an hour later, and the boys sat down behind Remus’ desk. Remus opened the door for the headmaster and returned to sit with his boys. “Harry, Niall, it is pleasant to see you both are well,” Dumbledore said, giving them both a grandfatherly smile. “And Remus, it is good to see you are settling in.”
“My my… to think he would pick that androgynous brat. Lucifer darling, I had no idea you’ve liked them genderless now… or is it really a boy? Or a girl… does not matter. They all die in the end. Shame though… he looks powerful enough.”
Remus thought. He continued to watch the two until the door opened and a fat man walked out and yelled, “You are not done yet! Get inside you ruddy children, you’ll finish it in the morning!” Remus snarled as he watched the man slap the back of their heads as they walked inside.
“Good, and lastly boys, know that Hogwarts holds its strictest punishments for Alphas who try to sneak into the isolation rooms, as well as for Omegas who try to sneak out of the isolation rooms. The two of you may be in a courtship, however, that is moot compared to our rules in this regard. Am I understood, boys?”
“No, that just sounds creepy,” Harry frowned. “Just talk to them like you would any other, just because they’re an Omega and you’re an Alpha doesn’t mean that you can’t be civil and friendly.”
“Yes, so be a good nephew, Harry, and let your Aunt out of her prison,” Voldemort said with some mirth. He handed Harry his wand. Harry took it and could feel the hatred flowing from the wand. He glanced up at Voldemort.
“To put it simply, yes,” Voldemort said, “I must add a final ingredient, however, as do you.” Harry felt a shiver and turned towards his lord. Voldemort stepped to the potion and produced a sharp silver knife. Harry watched as the Dark Lord extended his arm over the cauldron. “This would have been your husband’s blood, a husband’s blood to cleanse his submissive,” Voldemort said, “however I am your Lord, your father now, and this will work just as well.” His hand moving quickly, his face showing no reaction or flinching, Voldemort sliced a clean cut into his arm, and Harry had to look away as his blood poured slowly into the potion.
Harry zoomed around the end of the stadium behind the Slytherin goal hoops, willing himself not to look at what was going on at Ron’s end; as he sped past the Slytherin Keeper, he heard Beltchley singing along with the crowd below,
“Oh? You’re defending him huh? What? Are you one of his boys too?” Ginny spat venomously before marching out of the kitchen, slamming the door behind her. Harry winced at the sound and looked at his two best friends.
“But a lovable idiot,” Harry grinned, surprising Draco as he winked at Hermione and kissed her cheek before falling, rather gracefully, into the chair that his shirt was on. She scoffed but grinned, shaking her head.
“Well in that case,” Draco stood up and took Harry’s hand. “There is no way I’m letting my submissive out of my sight.”
Voldemort turned to see his Omega wearing nothing but a pair of pajama bottoms. He couldn’t help but smile at how healthy-looking his body was starting to look, moving further and further away from the once gaunt appearance. “I’m sorry pup, I just had a lot on my mind,” he said.
“Well—I mean it wasn’t my idea at first it was Ron and Hermione’s, mostly Hermione’s and everyone there are people who hate Slytherins—”
Ron nodded and moved quickly around the room, closing the curtains over the windows and snuffing the candles he had lit. The room became darker, but still easy to look around. Dumbledore turned his wand to the darkest corner of shadow. He started chanting in a language none of them understood, and almost immediately there was a loud howling that filled the room. Dumbledore kept the chanting, as wind magically picked up in the room, sweeping and whirling around, pushing the furniture against the walls and pushed everyone inside, the door slamming shut. The unearthly howling continued, and Mrs. Weasley gave a gasp of shock as red eyes appeared in the corner.
“I am,” Harry nodded. “I hope that it’s okay if I brought my Alpha, it would honestly help us both plan our futures easier.”
“Hogwarts was the safest place,” Harry said, “then the Ministry drove Dumbledore out. Without Dumbledore to fear, Voldemort has easy access to the castle.”
“Draco make sure that this omega does not look,” Voldemort commanded. Draco jumped and looked up at his lord for a moment before nodding. He stepped forward and grabbed Twilfitt, his eyes meeting Harry’s for only a brief moment before turning around with the man, their backs to Harry. Voldemort stepped to Harry and whispered, “You have scars.”
“I don’t need your pity or your anger,” Harry said shortly when he reached the bed. Draco looked up at him. “Never in my life have I ever pitied you,” he said seriously.
“I did! But your letters never mentioned or replied, and then they stopped,” Viktor said. “You never replied.” Harry blinked, what was he talking about? He never got any letters from Viktor.
Mr. Malfoy sneered in disgust. “As if I would allow you to disgrace our family from marrying a Potter,” he said. “Honestly Draco, I have thought you would grow sense and end this trifle manner by now. It seems that I was wrong.”
“In the meantime, I think we should just try and relax for the rest of the night,” Uncle Remus said. “The pizza should be here any minute now.”
“Harry, mate?” Ron asked. Harry turned to Ron and pointed at the plate frantically. Realization came to Ron’s eyes before turning to anger. He took his napkin and pointed towards the Ravenclaw table, “What the hell is that guy doing?” he asked loudly. People around them turned to look at where he was pointing. Harry took the napkin in Ron’s hand and quickly spat out the food, coughing rather violently. He did not risk his own cup and drank from Ron’s as Ron got rid of the soiled napkin by throwing it under the table.
his parents are followers of Voldemort!” That shocked Ron out of his stupor as he jumped at Voldemort’s name. He looked between Harry and Hermione but said nothing.
Harry placed him down once more and nodded, “Okay, good Dobby, thank you,” he said. “And please, stop punishing yourself.”
“You have no idea how good it feels to hear your annoying voice,” Harry sighed, spotting Draco. The Alpha just raised an eyebrow as he smirked.
“Yeah, they always lose because they keep getting fouls,” Ron nodded, he gave Niall a smile, “hey at least you don’t support them, eh?”
However, before they could, Harry saw something. Across from Flourish and Blotts was a store with plushies of every side called Omega’s Comforts. In the window was a plushie of a large, beautiful wolf with black fur. Harry swallowed and stared at it, unconsciously stepping towards the store. “Harry?” Sirius said.
“Of course, yes,” Draco said. He took his wand out, handing it to Harry. Harry thought that the older Alpha made sure their fingers touched. A shockwave pulsed through him, and Harry blushed as he closed his legs, thinking
“Yeah, I did,” Draco nodded. He smiled and thought for a moment before kissing Harry’s cheek, “So, two more dates?” he grinned.
Still struggling, Harry gave out a silent gasp as shadow hands reached through the barrier. Harry reached for them, grasping onto one. It was warm, inviting, and Harry held on strong. The other hands circled around Harry, the shadows of the darkness cradling him, driving away the mist and carrying the boy across the barrier.
Draco chuckled and undid his pants just enough to slip his cock and balls out. “Get it wet dog, it’s the only lube we’re using,” he warned.
The three just stood there for a moment, shocked. Madam Malkin stood her ground, “You heard me, boy, I don’t want your kind here, get out!”
“So Harry’s body is changing and that’s making him feel all hot?” Niall frowned, “Is it going to be like that all the time?”
“It is barely the afternoon,” Voldemort hummed, “and my son is in desperate need of clothing. I think I will go out with him, and your son too if required.”
“Sirius! The boy’s fifteen, please keep that kind of talk to yourself,” Uncle Remus grumbled. Sirius just shrugged and picked up his fork. “Harry, when you’re done eating, if you can just feed Orion and Lycaon, it would be much helpful,” he said.
A man of pure beauty with ebony skin and fire-like eyes. Harry could not describe him physically. Only that he knew who the man was in an instant, and the man’s handsomeness and beauty had no comparison or parallel. Harry’s heart felt corrupted and smitten for all but a second until the man, his Dark Lord, disappeared from view, but his presence was felt by Harry. Shaking, he looked at the others, to see that they only were staring at him.
“Lucius,” Voldemort said in a purring tone, “Do not worry yourselves over my appearance, for today is a day of celebration.”
Draco took a step back and instinctively held his arms. He hated that he reacted so cowardly at even the faintest mention of
“Then why were you so focused on getting us here to Hogwarts?” Harry asked, “And then tried to force me to change houses.”
“No worries,” Blaise smiled, “I’ll just go and have a head start on our homework.” He walked into the kitchen without another work.
“Mr. Malfoy! Mr. Malfoy! How do you feel about the accusations Dumbledore made?” a reporter asked, “did you know about the allegations against your father?”
The woman stared at him silently. Mr. Riddle laughed once more, taking another bite of his apple. There was another soft gust of wind, and the woman was gone. Mr. Riddle shook his head as he turned his attention back to his work. “Incompatible woman,” he muttered to himself. He looked at the painting of his Lord and said, “You should have thrown her away.”
Harry frowned. He hated this, hated himself. He should have been stronger. He must be stronger. He shouldn’t have killed Nott. He should have killed Voldemort. He didn’t feel himself. Where was the boy who faced Voldemort? Faced the Basilisk? Faced Quirrell and turned back time to save Sirius? Where was he? He wasn’t here. He wasn’t being escorted to the bath by Sirius. He was somewhere else. He was the voice who protested and died away and now all that was left was… what? Harry did not know.
Bellatrix nodded. “Then how about this?” she asked. “It has been forever, after the ten years, you, me, and that girl all head out for a night. No planning or demonly wrong doings. Just a couple drinks.”
Harry forced a sweet voice, “I love my Alpha so much and I love my Alpha’s love, especially when he forces me to do embarrassing things that will make him lose sex later on.”
“I know that the last couple days have been hectic,” Blaise said, “I’m just trying to make our new norm go smoothly, and that we all can get along, my mages.”
Blaise chuckled, “Don’t worry Draco,” he said, “by the end of the day, my dears, I’ll more than make up for whatever ills I’ve done to you two.”
“No my Lord, Harry is far from it in fact,” Uncle Remus said as he opened the front door. “Why, by the time he was five, he could easily levitate utensils and even small objects. His powers have only grown ever since.”
“A secure and loving home… as Mr. Harry Malfoy,” Harry said sincerely. Daphne laughed and shook her head.
Harry nodded. “Almost,” he said. He looked back at the congregation, “I’ve saved you all with the help of magic that I would never known without the help of Draco Malfoy and Blaise. I would not be here, today, with these two. Blaise is Satan’s son… in regard to his father his will is mine. I study and worship the same practices that you all, however in this matter I will defeat Satan if it comes to it. I’m not going to pretend that I have all the answers—I’m not even sure who is against me and who is with me—but I do know that I believe in Blaise, and I will follow him to heaven and back. If all you want to do is throw insults at me, fine, do it, I don’t care. But if you excuse me… I have an old god to wake up.”
