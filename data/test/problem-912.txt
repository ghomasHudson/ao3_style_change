“I’m glad you are so passionate about this. It shows how much you care for your future, and your father,” Severus added that last part as an afterthought. He’d clearly assumed his father’s research was something pureblood related.
Next thing he knew, he was slumped up against a wall. Draco blinked around blearily, and he pinched the bridge of his nose. He felt a dull headache, but nothing too bad. He felt the same as he had a couple weeks ago- confused, and like he’d just woken up from a bad nap. This time, it was easier to quell the rising panic because he knew he’d feel it. Also, this time his situation was easier to explain. He had gotten sick in the Great Hall, and had been on his way to the infirmary. He must’ve lost consciousness on his way there.
Draco didn’t know what to make of that. He supposed it was meant to be comforting, but it just made him feel uncomfortable.
Sighing, he raised his palm up to get a proper look at the wounds. They weren’t that deep, just red and inflamed. Though, of course, that was to be expected. He felt a shift on his shoulder and turned his head to peer up at the bird curiously. He didn’t understand why it insisted on using him as a perch. Animals never liked him much- except for Acelin- so this bird was curious, indeed.
“That diary thing?” Daphne’s question made Draco tense. He really hated it when the diary was brought up in conversation.
Emerald green eyes flooded Draco's vision as he met Potter's gaze. He instantly cleared his expression and took in the raven haired boy’s appearance. He looked slightly taller than last year, but aside from that not much had changed. When he looked back up at Potter he realized the other boy had been giving him a curious glance, like he was some puzzle he couldn't figure out. Draco frowned at that, Potter was supposed to look at him with anger, disgust, hatred. Not...whatever this was.
So, when his friends didn’t fuss over him like they normally would’ve...Draco felt...something. Anger? No. He knew what it was. What a ridiculous thing to feel hurt about. He scolded himself for feeling this way. Draco knew better than to feel sad over something so pointless. He should’ve expected it anyways. Why didn’t he?
It made sense to Draco, strangely enough. It was easy to forget Tom Riddle wasn’t alive because of how animated he and the diary seemed to be. But then, it wouldn’t really make sense if he was alive either.
Yet, even with the darkness surrounding him, Draco could clearly see his hand wave dully across his face. He also felt like he was floating, and when he slowly sat up and looked around him he realized he “was” in a pool of water.
He’d, quite possibly, killed Daphne Greengrass. And yet...he didn’t remember any of it. It was only moments ago that he’d been enjoying himself in the Great Hall with his friends- one of them Daphne- and now...he was here. He was in a desolate corridor, facing the fact that he’d hurt someone important to him.
During the hours that followed, Harry pondered a lot of things. Maybe they should talk? About the war, about their relationship. Maybe he should fuck him, Malfoy seemed to have enjoyed the kiss and Harry didn’t feel even an once of the shyness girls he dated made him feel.
After a little while without Draco speaking, Harry continued: “You strike me as a guy who can never be satisfied. You never had control over anything in your life. Your father decided everything”, Harry took Draco’s left arm in his hand and started slowly stroking his mark. “Then, Voldemort took over and it got even worse. But now! You had me to control, I thought that now you finally had something in your life your could control, it would never be enough, and it would always get worse and worse every time you got bored with your last idea on how to torture me.”
Malfoy had explained that last part with an ambiguous look in his eyes. In one way he sounded more of himself, more assured. In another, he sounded defeated, resigned, knowing their plan was not compelling enough for the Wizengamot.
“You said it yourself: I’m a cunning little bitch who uses people and doesn’t care for rules. You, on the other hand, are
“Well, you fucked me harder and harder, then you caged me, then you forbade me to cum, I thought the dry shagging was the next step.” Harry explained, sounding suddenly more confident, even though Malfoy’s expression troubled him.
What should happen now is Draco shouting a clear : "what the bloody hell are you talking about, do you have rats in the attic or something?", but no words came out. The blond boy was somehow more mesmerized by how she had said it than the fact she had said it. She giggled it. Like 12 years old girls do, and not adding: "if you hurt out precious saviour, we will curse your death eater ass into next week." It was pure, undeniable gossip. Nothing more. This was unequivocally the weirdest day of the young Malfoy's life.
Harry walked towards him and touched his forearm. “To be clear, that doesn’t mean I think you should rot here", he insisted cautiously. He could feel the need for Malfoy to jerk his arm off of his touch, but he didn't. Harry smiled, and backed off. It was a start.
The blond boy froze. He did not move for 30 endless seconds. Then turned around and sat back on the chair. Slowly. His face was red, looking stunned, but also calculating. Harry could practically hear him pondering the implications of what he had just said. Rethinking their whole relationship.
They were meeting in a little conference room near the cells and Harry had managed to get him alone. He knew a lot of powerful members of the Wizengamot would not agree to this meeting. They could want to hear the whole conversation or not let them talk at all. This could go south any second, so he had to make his point quick. He did not have time for Malfoy to be scared and sad.
Harry had voiced his clarifications in the most relaxed and comfortable way. That actually freaked Draco more than the words he had spoken.
"You came", she said with looked like a genuine smile. She had the same look in her eyes that Potter had on that night on the tower. Merry and drunk.
“Why not? We already know we are sexually compatible; we just had a very non life threatening conversation, you obviously like me and I do recall mentioning I like your nerdy side like 3 seconds ago. Plus, we could talk about our shrink visits and I could tell you about all the Slytherin more or less legal things I did here over the years.” Harry accepted.
They were not ignoring him in particular; they were ignoring the past in general. It was so obvious now. Everybody here had decided that they all well deserved to be stupid reckless kids. To finally live the adolescence they had been so violently deprived of. Because of the Dark Lord and his followers. "Because of me." he couldn't help but whisper to himself.
Draco must have looked like he was about to implode, cause suddenly Granger was sitting closer to him and stroking his back. Not unlike what Potter had done on the tower. "You must feel very confused about those feelings", she started. Draco could only nod, so she continued: "all that history between the 2 of you, all that violence and hatred. I could understand that even though you had feelings for him, you'd be reluctant to start a relationship with him. Do you know how you feel about him, exactly?"
Harry smiled. Nodded. Stopped flirting. He walked to Draco once more. Took his left hand in his. “Wanna go for a walk then? It’s beautiful outside. Smells like spring.”
Draco lay down on the bed, putting in left forearm over his eyes. Harry sat crossed legged near him. “So… basically, all this time, I was the Dom, but you’ve been the one using me”, Draco laughed again, more genuinely this time.
Instantly, the beautiful stag started bouncing right towards Granger, having its desired effect and completely baffling her for just the slip second it took to quickly cast a disarming charm.
No, what would have been the real bold move, would had been to admit how he really felt. Thankful, grateful, promising of stopping to be an arsehole prat, scared that he would never be able to repay his depth.
After Draco’s conversation with Snape he did, admittedly, feel better. His friends seemed to brighten at his lighter mood, and he was even able to joke with them more freely than he’d done in weeks.
To be honest, he’d sort of expected worse. To feel ill maybe- possibly even having constant nightmares. But that wasn’t the case. Draco felt tremendously tired, but the Pepper up potion should clear that up swiftly. And he had slept rather soundly too. No nightmares, no nothing.
Draco hopped off his broom and cleared his train of thought. Yes, he really did suppose yesterday had been most eventful. And even though he understood his mother's worry he knew things would be ok. He’d have his father there to ensure he was safe, afterall.
Lucius placed the black diary down gently on the edge of Draco's bed. He then strode out of the room, but paused before he turned to close the door.  “Draco. Narcissa does not need to know about this. She’d only fuss, and you’re old enough to accept tasks of your own free will, aren’t you?”
Turns out, Draco didn’t finish a moment too late. One of the twins had finally decided to just hex Crabbe, and he shoved past Granger. He grabbed Draco’s robes from behind and shoved Draco to his front so Draco could clearly see the fury in the Weasley’s eyes.
At least he’d been able to write to his father and tell him that the task was completed. Surely, his father would be pleased with his timing. And Snape had mentioned something about bringing up the Potter- Car issue to the school board when Draco had seen him in the dungeons after classes ended too. So, all in all, it wasn’t a total waste of a day.
Draco looked at Snape blankly and made to stand up and join his professor near the fireplace. Fawkes shifted and gave a discontented trill, but flew off Draco’s shoulder nonetheless. Dumbledore watched his bird in complete curiosity but shrugged the curious creature off as he refocused his attention on the Malfoy heir.
As he’d pondered this, Madam Pomfrey had retrieved a Pepper-up potion and shoved it in Draco’s hands. Draco nodded at her in thanks and took the potion, immediately feeling the build up of heat being released from his ears. He stayed in the hospital wing for a moment longer, and when the potion's side effects had dulled- and he felt the drowsiness seep away- he had given the empty bottle back to Madam Pomfrey and headed to the Great Hall.
Abruptly she slammed her book down- earning a murderous look from Madam Pince. She winced, and gave the librarian an apologetic look. Afterwards, she turned to Draco and signaled for him to place his book down.
As expected, the day was a difficult one for Draco. He’d only gotten about 2 hours worth of sleep, and yet, he felt as if he’d gotten none. All his dorm mates questioned him about his exhaustion- under the impression he’d fallen asleep not long after them- and Draco had to pretend he was not as tired as he really was. Of course, when this didn't work the girls all became concerned that he’d fallen ill and promptly sent him to Madam Pomfrey.
“Draco. Is your father still donating to the team this year?” Flint grunted. Draco sighed, but nodded. The older boy laughed and hashly patted Draco on the back. Draco grimaced at that, but didn’t complain.
It seemed simple enough to Draco. He hadn’t been expecting any of the Dark Lord’s tasks to be anywhere near pleasant anyways. “Alright. Do what you need to,” Draco said determinedly.
His friends came after all that. To most, their friends would be in second or third place. Or, they wouldn’t even be ranked. Not to mention most people his age wouldn’t think of a possibility where they’d have to hurt and lose their friends for the sake of their own self interest.
“Now, Narcissa, the boy has agreed to stay by my side the entire time. No one would dare hurt him if he’s in my presence. Not to mention he’s already 12, a perfectly acceptable age to be making trips into Knockturn Alley so long as he is accompanied by an adult. Stop fussing over the matter,” Lucius clearly wanted to make the point known. Plus, he’d already been making comments since Draco was 11 that Narcissa had to stop worrying over him so much someday; that he was getting much too old for all the coddling.
“Granger,” he sneered. “Have Potter and Weasley finally realized how annoying your presence is? Finally abandoned you?”
“Mother, I apologize for shaming the family name. I’m sure father told you about what I’d done, and I-“ He was stopped when a comforting hand was placed on his shoulder. It was quite unlike the way his father's hand had gripped him earlier, but the area was indeed slightly bruised, and he winced nonetheless.
Instead, Draco was greeted by a shimmering of ink on the once blank parchment. Words started to form, and Draco held the diary out towards the fire to see them more clearly.
With that plea he turned to stare longingly at the ring. If it really wasn't a scam, a pretty thing with false promises...he could potentially change the future, whatever it was supposed to look like for him, and maybe...just maybe. ‘Maybe I can finally be just as great. I can be recognized.’ It was a long shot. But he had to take it, it just felt...right.
Nonetheless, Draco answered the Dark Lords questions- every one of them. He told him about his magical expertise, his immense loathing for Harry Potter and his friends, and his family. He didn't realize how much time was flying by, and was only aware of it when he heard a muttering from the other side of the room.
Draco stopped writing in the diary for a few days after that first experience. If writing in it would constantly wear him out, then he needed to regain some strength before writing in it again so he’d still be of use to the Dark Lord. Plus, exhaustion really wasn’t a good look on him- and if he continued to look tired his friends would become suspicious.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________
In an effort to apologize to his father Draco accepts the task Lucius presents to him. He just doesn’t understand why a Weasley would need to be involved.
Draco quickly snapped out of his thoughts to thank Flint. “Listen, practice is tomorrow. Sorry for the short notice, but I just couldn’t seem to find the time to talk to you until now,” Flint grunted.
Draco did love to see Snape and Potter argue, as it usually ended with Potter being put in his place. But right now, Draco wished Snape wouldn’t drag him into this mess. So, he joined Potter and gave his godfather a truly menacing glare (as menacing a glare as a second year could give, anyways).
In fact, Draco was surprised they hadn’t questioned him further. He was grateful for this, but he certainly hadn’t expected it. He supposed Daphne had come close to asking Draco about the diary once, but Theodore gave her a sharp jab in the side before she could say anything. At least Draco wouldn’t have to lie to his friends as much. And if they could be kept out of this for now, that would be the best outcome.
Draco's mind went back to when he'd thrown himself in front of Harry before fake-Moody could fire a spell, and wondered why people equated It with something so big as actually saving his life.
"I see." Severus said flatly. "I understood this might happen. You aren't in any immediate danger, so I wouldn't normally entertain such futile requests."
Like a frozen Lake with hundreds of thousands of fractures and fissures that would break through if he moved even an inch.
"Oh, right. Well, I might have to go to the library and research then." Draco started, reminding Harry fondly of Hermione when she was on a roll about something. He remembered his friends with a pang of guilt, realising he had bailed on them after dinner and never went back. They must all be asleep, Harry thinks, checking his watch.
.” Harry insisted, “She already hates me. All I have to do is drop a pencil wrong, and she’d find a way to put me in detention.”
Spotting Ron and Hermione, he veered around the table to go sit across from the pair. He briefly caught sight of Seamus, who quickly looked away when he saw Harry looking, Harry just shook his head again, wondering what exactly it was that Ron had said to the boy.
Draco was sitting on the windowsill in one of the high towers of Hogwarts, his parchment and books laid out around him that he was dutifully ignoring in favour of staring at the transfigured Quidditch pitch.
." Harry said with a short laugh, "Merlin, no. I just want you to not be at each other's necks in the very least."
The two were silently looking at something the wall across the room, shoulders almost touching as they stared at it. Harry and Hermione glanced at each other carefully, then slowly made their way to the two.
"No, Potter. Listen to me. We're both in very sensitive positions at the moment. With the rising of the Dark Lord, I'll be able to collect information from the inside from my father - undetected, of course. In return, you'll give me any developments about your side and what they know. We'll be able to compare and share knowledge. This way I can be informed of what my father doesn't tell me and won't be blindsided by the Dark Lord."
Draco leant in to Blaise, nudging the boy annoyingly. “Who said it was Lancaster I was after, anyway? Looks like everyone’s dad
"I SUPPOSE YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A REAL LAUGH, HAVEN’T YOU," Harry interrupted, stood with his fists clenched and facing away from Draco. "ALL HOLED UP HERE TOGETHER -"
in Second Year, for Merlin knows what reason other than them being muggleborns? I'm afraid to admit that I agreed with it back then, maybe even liked it, but now I'm older and I realise that it was fucked up, and they had
"She's…er, fine. We're both good." He stammered, looking down at his parchment and not making eye contact, obviously not recovered from his encounter with Blaise earlier that year.
“M’ fine,” he said again, bracing his forehead on one of his arms on the side of the sink. He stayed like that, catching his breath. Luckily, the heaving had stopped for now.
He ate dinner eagerly, having found his appetite after his nap. He ignored Pansy scandalised expressions for every serving he took, as if three was all
“I’m glad you think so, Malfoy.” Harry’s owl flapped her wings agitatedly on his arm, to which he soothed her with a few strokes and uttered encouragement. After a moment, he looked back at Draco, the corner of his mouth turning upwards. “Now are you done gawking? I’m sure you didn’t just come here to admire my looks.”
Mr. Weasley got up from his chair, wearing not the usual robes but muggle clothing he'd often seen businessmen wearing on the streets of London on their way to work. It was something more suited for under a pair of robes, in Draco's opinion, but it definitely passed by muggle standards.
“Dreams? Weird ones? Trelawney worthy ones?” Pansy continued boredly, seemingly unaware of his panic.
the letter started off with, and Harry smiled at the words he could practically hear coming out of Draco's mouth in that snobbish tone of his.
"Bottomline is," Sirius continued over Remus's fumble, "We've all put to rest what we have with this kid and him with us, correct? Great. Let's get over it. Chap's turning in to a blooming tomato over there."
"It…" Snape started, a strange expression on his face Draco could only place as fear, "It is all true, Draco. He is back." the man clutched his left arm, and Draco stiffened. He had forgotten whom he was really speaking to.
There was a loud thump, the sound of a heavy object hitting Ron's head, and the subsequent sound of it hitting the floor.
"It's great, Ronald. Harry's too unstable to be in a position of power, anyways." Draco said dully, and Harry scowled at him.
Harry walked a few paces ahead of Malfoy all the way to the side of the Lake. He made sure to stop beneath a willow tree that would have obscured them from view if anyone decided to look out the courtyard. It was a secluded area, and Harry pleasantly noted it's suitability for staging a non-so accidental death of a certain Slytherin student. The moon was still a few hours away from the crux of it's path over the sky, but it shone regardless and cast it's beams over the water. Harry thought he might have enjoyed it, if certain
Without looking back at Dumbledore, he turned and descended the staircase, leaving the room behind him with a whole new mountain of worries on his shoulders.
He heaved again and this time it was more gagging and less actual vomiting. His eyes began to water as his stomach muscles convulsed.
He glanced at his mother, the fire sending shadows across her face, but also a warm yellow light that made her look younger.
Draco took the time to look down at the rest of Harry, and barely managed to hide the change in his expression. He hadn't realised it before because of Harry's hideous oversized clothing, but Harry looked skinnier than when he'd left for the summer. It was a significant amount than normal in Draco's opinion, and his mind started on the dark trail of thought of what exactly Harry's relatives tolerated in their dislike of him. He shook off the thought for the time being, not wanting to address it with Harry just yet.
"Because I don't want my father to become a Death Eater again, Blaise! I don't want him to become one of them again! I like the way my life is
"It looks like you've really thought this over." Ron said, looking unamused but considerably more calm than before.
"Oh don't change the subject!" She said, snatching her parchment away and rubbing something out on it, "I've tolerated your little tryst with that blundering Gryffindor idiot all this time, but now it's getting annoying when you're so stressed about him all the time."
"Clothes are there." Draco pointed to the end of the bed, where a set of freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt sat at the foot of his bed. "See you downstairs." Then left the room.
“Well,” Harry said cautiously, “I’m… I’m on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. And I was supposed to be at the tryouts for the new Keeper at five o’clock on Friday and I was - was wondering whether I could skip detention that night and do it — do it another night…. instead...”  His voice felt barely above a rough whisper. For some reason, the woman had placed a deep seated fear inside of him that he couldn’t shake, and it took all of his willpower to maintain eye contact. He’d felt true fear before, but standing in front of Umbridge, he wondered why it almost felt the same.
Ron reached out and Harry met him half way, clutching onto his friends sleeves frantically, “My scar, Ron. She touched me and it began to hurt-”
The whistle of the train sounded, signaling five minutes before departure. Draco looked to his parents, the two saying their goodbyes to the other families. They approached and greeted Blaise.
"Only around one week in did they start. After that…" He trailed off giving him a knowing look, eyes puffy behind his circular-rimmed glasses.
"Don't think I haven't watched you and Potter." The man said, his magical eye now fixed on Draco. "I know what you think of me, and I can't have you intervene after tonight." The man drew out his wand, instantly spurring Draco in to pulling out his own.
, Blaise." Draco grumbled, attempting to bury his face into his pillow in hopes it would smother him dead.
"Right." Draco said, looking slightly deflated. Harry didn't understand why the boy's mood suddenly changed before his eyes caught on the sun sliced in half by the horizon, but looking whole anyways in the reflection of the Lake.
Sorry i won't write essays like this all the time. Thanks again to people bothering to read this shit!
annoying sometimes." Potter finished, panting slightly. It reminded Draco of the night of the Ball when Potter gave him a similar kind of rant.
.” Neville corrected next to him, and the portrait swung open toward them like a door, revealing a circular hole in the wall behind, through which Harry and Neville now climbed.
Draco grabbed Blaise's arm and pulled him close, whispering harshly, "Then whose is it, Blaise? It's my responsibility. I'm the only one who
Once outside, he shivered slightly at the cool night air. He didn’t realise that winter was approaching once again, and only had a thin jumper to combat the chill. The moon was nowhere to be seen that night, which meant he needed to cast a
The bird saw him, and he could swear the thing's eyes narrowed at the sight it saw. It rose to it's full height, wings tucked at it's side and head pridefully held up so Draco wouldn't be able to look down on it even if he tried. It's body covered the window behind it, blocking all light and casting a shadow on Draco. It was bigger than, and from the looks of it, even if he had his wand which had been confiscated by Harry, much more powerful than him.
Draco snorted, and everyone looked at him. "He is infuriatingly thorough." He remarked. "What was done in a two hour meeting could have easily been said in five minutes."
They lapsed in to silence, just like the day before, and as weird as it may have looked, Draco relaxed slightly in to it. The hushed quiet, his aching body and the warmly lit room from the fire across them made him want to melt in to the chair.
Harry quickly stopped flipping the wand in the air and placed it obediently next to his on the ground.
He opened up the window and the owl flew in. Immediately, the letter unrolled itself and begun to speak.
A bird overhead screeched, and the trees lining Privet Drive began to rustle. Wind brushed through Harry, and he lifted up a hand to his cheek because the skin felt colder than normal. It came away wet, and he looked at his fingers to see were damp on the tips and caked in dirt under his fingernails.
Draco’s arms fell to his sides. His body tensed without his permission. “You must be more specific, Professor. I’m sure there were many nights for Harry,” he said quietly.
Bill looked at him for a moment, shocked, before saying softly, "You're good for him, Draco. Maybe Ron will see that side of you someday, too."
Potter cocked his head to the side and smiled crookedly, "Oh my. Draco Malfoy just thanked me in casual conversation. What have I created?"
"Ms. Zabini." Draco's father smoothly greeted a sharply dressed woman as they approached. Next to her, a man much shorter than her was stuck to her side, almost nose deep in nuzzling her exposed chest area as if it were the most lovely thing in the world. If Draco didn't know better, he would have been certain the man was under a love potion.
“Wh- What do you mean ‘another’?” Draco’s beginning tirade was stopped by the dull expression on Blaise’s face. “I- well of bloody course he’s involved somehow! It’s just… he doesn’t know about this, thank you very much. My own volition completely, Blaise.”
His stomach began to heave and he felt a sourness threatening to leave his mouth. Scrambling back up, Harry brushed past Ron and began to run again.
like that." Ron grumbled on the way down the stairs, all of them going silent and tensing up around the draped painting of Walburga.
"Oh-" A shiny object, green and silver, fell out of Draco's envelope as well. "Me too." He said, pleased.
Draco sat up on his knees, letting the book in his lap fall away to the ground. He pressed his hands to the glass, getting as close as he could to garner any sort of view better than the one he had.
"Alright there?" Draco asked him. He glanced pointedly at their hands, the corner of his mouth twitching. "Like the feel of my hands or something, Potter?"
Draco sat back with a relieved sigh, but grimaced immediately and crawled up to stand when his knee protested. If he could jump for joy, he would, and if he could let out a celebratory yell, he would. Neither his blasted knee nor his mother's possible intrusion would allow it though, so he settled for flopping on to his bed with a contented sigh.
"As I have said," His father boomed, "Within a duel, your eyes never leave the same place. What's your spot?"
"Nothing." Draco said quickly, acting as odd as he'd been for the last ten minutes. "Just remembered something."
“Did you just come from detention?” Ron asked, face blooming with red as if he were embarrassed. At the reminder of detention, however, bile rose in Harry’s throat. He braced his hand over his mouth and Ron gasped.
It was nice though, he thought again. Being stood there with his perpetual rival, but not feeling the usual animosity he usually would for once. It made him think that he maybe things weren't how he thought they were, and for that he felt relief for once.
"Your boy did well." Blaise's voice murmured in his ear, and Draco was too chuffed that his bloody Gillyweed worked to even respond.
"It's alright, but stop saying sorry so much, will you? You're freaking me out to be quite honest." Harry said jokingly, but he meant some of it as well. Malfoy smiled again, something Harry felt like he would never stop being startled by.
"I'm not going to apologise about anything I've done to you over the years, because quite honestly you deserved them. You're a bully, you insult my friends and you almost killed me last year with the dementor episode. That being said, if you want to start over, I propose a truce. You're not so bad, if you don't open your mouth as much."
“It’s cool, mate,” Harry said quickly, smiling in a way he hoped wasn’t creepy. Without thinking, he reached out and put a hand on Seamus’s shoulder, meaning to be friendly. Instead, Seamus just froze and looked at him like Harry had sprouted a new head on his shoulders.
Conjuring his most charming smile and throwing it at the Weasel and finally to Potter, Draco strode to the boy and took his hand. He shook it once, hiding his wince that it was quite as clammy as it looked, and said,  "Very well. I will take you to the Ball, Potter."
“As I was saying, you have been informed that a certain Dark wizard is at large once again. This is a
"If I don't do this," Draco said, his voice now low and tightly controlled, "I will have no choice, Harry. I
"What you did…from your explanation, I can understand why you had to, to some extent. It would have been too much of a risk if Draco was allowed to go between the two extremes without proper boundaries. I understand where you were coming from."
He left the room, and Harry busied himself with nothing important at all in his trunk, if only it would give him something to focus on other than those horrible feelings. He did that silently, Draco and Hermione also silent behind him.
The first was a blinding flash of pain that erupted throughout Draco’s whole body, causing him to suck in a deep breath and stagger. If it hadn’t been for Draco’s rigorous training in keeping a calm composure at all times- and the presence of Draco’s enemies- he surely would’ve screamed out in agony and fallen to his knees. It felt like the cruciatus curse, only with more of a burning than slicing sensation. Draco had fallen victim to one of his father's stray curses when he was younger, and he hadn’t wished to revisit the feeling again. It couldn’t be helped now, he’d supposed.
“Family heirloom,” Draco responded- his voice equally casual. Draco looked up from his book momentarily, and saw Blaise open his mouth to refute his statement. He couldn’t let them figure this out. He hated to show weakness, even if it was made up, but he had to do this.
That fact brightened up Draco’s day. And with Riddle being mysteriously absent for some time, Draco was even happier. Draco was calm for the first time in awhile; the fact that the Gryffindor-Slytherin quidditch game was just around the corner gave him something to look forward to as well. With his new broom he was sure to beat Potter.
“In case you’ve forgotten this is a partnered brewing session, and I know how dreadful you are in this class. You need to do something to get credit, and I won’t have your idiocy mucking up the potion. Plus, I don’t feel like getting the ingredients,” Draco shrugged. He slowly started to tidy up their workstation (even though it was practically spotless already), and Potter just rolled his eyes at him.
“I suppose your answer is in that statement then,” was all Draco said in reply. Now that he thought about it, maybe it was better that Daphne hadn’t been alone with him. She was incredibly smart, perceptive, and persistent. If anyone could get Draco to admit what he was doing with the diary...it was her. And his housemates must have realized this, and known he wouldn’t want to be questioned. So they kept her away from him- until now.
Before he left, Draco “suggested” that Crabbe and Goyle get changed too. He only hoped the two idiots would get the message.
“Wait, hold on. So, Potter and Weasley couldn’t get past the platform’s barrier? What does that mean?” Theodore questioned.
Fawke’s head bent down towards Draco’s hand, almost like he was inspecting it himself. Draco paid him no mind; Dumbledore’s bird could do whatever it wanted. Draco watched the bird absentmindedly, and just wished Snape and Dumbledore would arrive already so he could sleep. Perhaps he’d wake up and realize all of this was some horrid nightmare. He knew it wasn’t, but Merlin, did he wish it was.
With that thought, Draco was pulled under the sea again. A wave had come and swept him under, and Draco didn’t try to fight it. The lingering hope in his eyes slowly diminished, until nothing was left, and all Draco could give to the bird next to him was a forced smile, and a soft “Thank you.”
He refrained from writing a lot in the diary during the next few days. Riddle didn’t seem to mind much. He just seemed to want to know about Draco’s day more often than not. After exchanging slight pleasantries, Riddle would usually end the conversation and bid Draco goodnight. Draco wasn’t going to complain about that outcome.
‘More of that? Draco, I aim to build a bond with you. I can’t let you help me until we both mutually trust each other.’
“Ginevra said she really didn’t know how it got in her trunk, and she looked very relieved when I brought the subject up. She told me she was trying to find the owner, but didn’t even know where to begin,” Astoria said calmly. “And, really, when she got the book for me there was no mistaking that it was yours. It has a really fancy cover, and a strong aura.”
His breathing grew panicky, and he instantly recalled trying to run from Daphne. Had he fainted? No, that wouldn’t explain the essay, or why he was in the common room instead of the infirmary. Those thoughts only made him panic further.
Nothing eventful happened. Sure, he had gone to quidditch practice last week, and the Gryffindor’s reactions were just as he expected them to be. Potter looked especially outraged, and Weasley was even more upset than Potter was. The boy had physically turned red with anger.
This time, Draco startled. A flush of panic overwhelmed him. She had...noticed? It was confirmed then- Draco still had to deal with the aftermath of the whole ring fiasco.
Draco's eyes widened only slightly. The Dark Lord really did trust and value his father then. So, if he trusted Draco to that same degree...perhaps he wouldn’t need to take the mark to be a Deatheater. The Dark Lord would trust him so much that he wouldn’t need to take the mark.  Maybe he’d even be so close to the Lord that he wouldn’t have to kill unless it was to protect him from a direct attack.
Draco opened his mouth to counteract Dumbledore once more, but abruptly stopped when the man’s words registered. “After...Daphne,” he mumbled.
The head of the Malfoy family felt a surge of pride. His son was a good choice for this; what with how he’d accepted the task so readily. He’d be a great servant to the Dark Lord when he came back. “Good. I’ll leave this with you then.”
He heard a faint whispering, but in his reduced state he couldn’t make out the words. It sounded eerie, and wrong. He felt the magic from earlier tug at him, and then a presence seemingly looked him over for a fraction of a second. As this happened Draco pathetically tried to raise his Occlumency shields higher.
“I was saving your sister from these bloody snakes!” Mclaggen proclaimed. Fred Weasley looked at the Slytherins with anger for a split second before he turned to his sibling.
Pansy looked around at the others, ensuring all eyes were on her. “I just heard those Ravenclaws who passed us talking about Potter. Apparently he wasn’t on the Hogwarts Express today.”
“Mr. Malfoy, stay back,” Snape’s cutting voice stopped Draco in his tracks. Potions was over, and Draco had been hoping to avoid the professor for a little longer by sneaking out of the class amidst the other Slytherins. ‘Damn Snape and his observational skills. The man’s far too astute sometimes.’
As expected, Snape wasn’t an easy read. Really, Draco got nothing from him. Finally, Draco gave in. “I wasn’t avoiding you professor. I’ve just been busy as of late.”
“Patience Blaize. Silence peaks others' interest you know.” With a glare from both Blaise and Daphne Greengrass, Pansy gave an exasperated sigh and continued. “Anyways, apparently Potter and Weasley couldn’t get past Platform 9 ¾’s barrier . So, they drove one of Arthur Weasley’s enchanted muggle cars to Hogwarts instead.”
Like now, he’d supposed. “Fine, let’s see what you’ve got,” Draco sighed, there was no telling what he’d have to put up with when it came to Acelin. Still, he smiled fondly at his bird before looking down at his talons, fully expecting to see a letter in his clutch. When he didn’t see one though, he groaned dramatically and sent a pointed look at the flying menace resting on his shoulder. “Nothing, you knocked me down only to show me you have nothing to give me?”
And with that, Draco shoved the diary into his bag and made his way to the Great Hall. He would eat dinner, and after that work on Transfiguration homework. Then he would go to his dorm early, and actually open the diary. Then he would write in it, and everything would be fine. He would obey the Dark Lord’s commands. And he would do this all on his own. He would do this for his family; for his father.
He cursed under his breath, and he cast a quick ‘Tempus’ spell. Upon seeing the time Draco groaned- classes were going to be a pain. With a final goodbye to Tom Riddle, Draco closed the diary gently and immediately felt a wave of exhaustion fall upon him. Strangely, he felt sharper- like he could see things clearer, and actually make sense of things.
Still, just thinking about all the stories he'd heard about Knockturn Alley really did excite him. More importantly, this trip was going to turn out to be one of the best yet- not only did he get to accompany his father on an important errand (whatever it may be), he was also going into Knockturn Alley and, almost certainly, he would be getting his new broom as well. Draco smiled gleefully with his next thought, ‘I suppose the good thing about going shopping for my supplies  later in the month means I have a better chance of not running into Potter and his sidekicks.’ Yes, the prospect of this shopping trip seemed to get better and better.
As expected, he felt a slight pull in his magic- like a resistance. It was the diary’s doing, he knew that. But, even though he did manage to get past that barrier, he still felt sick to his stomach after the ordeal was over.
‘I’m quite curious to see how Hogwarts has changed since my time. Let’s start there- with your time at school.’
Realization hit Draco. If what his father had said was true, then Ginevra Weasley would be the prime candidate. “Ok. I’ll do it,” Draco said the words with an air of finality. This was a simple task, and he could do it easily and with no remorse.
He lit the lantern with a wave of his hand, and he shut the curtains around his bed. This time he disregarded his hesitation, and started to write.
As Draco made to do exactly that, he realized with a jolt he was actually closer to Potter now as the line had moved up considerably from moments before. ‘No matter, I can still get out of here unnoticed, surely.’ Yet, Draco should’ve realized it wouldn’t be that easy- things involving “The Boy who Lived” never were. For the first time since stepping into the shop Draco finally realized just what that line was for. Because, in what appeared to be two swift steps, Gilderoy Lockhart himself strode up to Harry Potter and pushed him up to the front of the line, exclaiming that Potter was the lucky recipient of Lockhart’s generosity. And, as much as Draco wanted to look away, he couldn’t.
And just like that, it was morning. Both boys saw the light of dawn enter the room at the same time. Telling them recess was over. They hadn’t fuck. Hadn’t said anything but those two sentences, so many ours ago. They started walking at the exact same pace, which put a tender smile on Draco’s face, that Harry obviously did not notice.
for the very first time in his young life. This powerful realisation was quickly followed by another: even though they have had sex many, many times, they had never kissed once. The thought of it had never even crossed Draco's mind before. But now, both sitting very close to each other on that bed, naked, it was all he could think about. Kissing the crap out of that beautiful insane and shockingly not that much of a Gryffindor boy.
, just like I am.” He spoke most of that very quickly but slowed at the end to put emphasis on the fact that Malfoy had done nothing wrong, if maybe acting a little cowardly. But nobody should blame a sixteen-year-old for that.  Malfoy should be at home, drinking posh tea in his posh pajamas with his annoying posh friends like any posh kid who went through major trauma.
an opportunistic Slytherin arsehole.” Harry smirked at him and Malfoy finally smiled, a little. Malfoy got angry at him for being nice and smiled at him being a jerk. Harry would have to ask Hermione about that. It didn't make any sense.
“You would really go out with me? On a date? A ro…man…tic date ?”, he stuttered, looking utterly shocked.
“I think there’s a spider on your chair.” Harry lied, trying to sound convincing and a little scared.
"Potter invited me. But I don't feel like I deserve to be here. It... it isn't right", he answered quietly, his eyes still fixed on the group listening to the cursed broom story. He couldn't help but notice Potter was now among them, laughing wholeheartedly without a care in the world.
When they reached the lake and sat on the grass, it took them both about 3 seconds before they started furiously laughing at their owe expanse. It was like they both had been caged for months and were finally out of it.
It had felt so good to put it there. To take ownership of the world’s savior’s Cock. To deny him orgasms. To fuck him senseless all the time and not give a shit about his pleasure.
Of course. They were an odd number of students and Potter was too good for any of them to face up anyway, so Lukewarm had made him the judge.
“I don’t know that either. It felt like you got scared because I was in pain and didn’t want me to run away and end this.”
“Think for a minute, Potter. They will know we met. If we tell the exact same stories, they will know we arranged them during this very meeting, and all of what we will be saying won’t be usable as definitive proof that I am not a despicable bastard who needs to be put away for good. You shouldn’t have come.”
“Oh my god, do you hear yourself? It’s like you think you know everything and are the best at everything. I’ve seen Lukewarm do it. It needs to be smooth and precise. Then, I can concentrate on making you pay for those 10 jinks you managed to cast.”
“Wow, what a stupid plan. You really exceeded yourself this time, Potter”, he answered with a scowl.
Harry sat back facing the fire. The right move now would be to leave of course. Go back to his room and forget this out of time moment ever happened. But it was the last thing he wanted.
At that, the young Malfoy couldn’t help but glare at Potter for the umpteenth time that night, but noticed to his great surprise that Harry was looking right at him this time, with what could only be described as a come hither look.
Harry thought of Snape, whom he had hated so much. Sometimes even more than Voldemort himself. Snape who had switched sides and was also a broken man. Not unlike the stunning blond boy sitting in front of him.
He got up to pick up a warm blanket on a nearby couch, only to sit back down to cuddle with Malfoy, spreading the blanket over them both.
Approaching the sheet, Draco hoped he would be paired with Potter, but doubted it could happen. DADA was never his best subject and Lukewarm’s system couldn’t possibly take into account the fact that he had gotten better in the last few weeks.
A couple times, when the savior had been forced to watch Voldemort live through his nightmares, he could see death eaters around. Most of them were not murderous at first. All they wanted was make sure their traditions would not get lost in a sea of new wizarding families. Was it stupid? Yes. Dangerous? Well, looked what happened. But surely, with the crazy snake gone, they could talk to each other. Muggle-borns could prove that they are lot less powerful and are as useful as purebloods. The purebloods could voice what there are afraid to lose and compromises could be made. Yes, this could work.
Here we go again. In defense class this time. Harry and Draco yet again arguing over something silly, more for the sake of the arguing than anything else. It has happened pretty much every day since the beginning of eight year.
Malfoy looked at him like Harry had just said purple giraffes were in the building. So, he did not answer, but just kept looking at the Gryffindor, bemused. Harry felt the need to elaborate.
Harry was sitting cross-legged with his arms behind his head, waiting for the deliberation in the other’s man head to end, his own guard totally down.
Oh boy had Potter been wrong. Being a virgin at the time, any sex talk seemed courageous to him, but to Draco, it was the easiest topic possible. By sixth year, he had had sex with pretty much everybody in the Slytherin house that was old enough. Asking to suck his Cock had nothing brave to it, it was in fact pure unadulterated cowardice.
“You would really do it? See a mind healer?” Draco asked, still standing way too close to him to his liking.
The Slytherin had to think fast. That cage had to come off. But Potter was too far gone to notice or care. So even thought it felt like the worst idea ever, he did what he thought was best.
He caught Potter’s eye in the crowd, and it hit him. Wow, that was a bad idea. There was no coming back from it. But it was a guarantied win.
“You mean using Potter as a DADA tutor so I can take naps during Lukewarm’s lectures? I still can’t believe he hasn’t noticed it yet. Last week, I argued that the disarming charm made orange light so I could see him do it from up front.”
“Well…You did agree to dance with me, and here you are doing all of the dancing, yet again making a show of yourself in front of your adoring fans. You should thank me for leaving you all the spotlight.” Draco answered, smiling chin high, looking very proud of himself.
“That’s who I am Harry. You run into things, I run from them. Maybe it makes us the perfect match. Maybe the perfect storm. The only thing you can count on is that
‘Here goes nothing’. Draco whispered to himself, still looking straight at Potter before casting: “EXPECTO PATRONUM!!!”.
“Like I said Draco, he likes you, but I’m sad to say, you might not be looking for the same thing.” Hermione remarked, before standing up from the couch, and taking Ron with her someplace else. Harry stood up from the group and walked to sit with Draco. None of the others seem to notice his leaving.
Draco stared at the jewels adorning the woman's neck and fingers. "That's what I call talent." He murmured.
dramatic. At least now you don't look like a bloody banshee. Thank me later, Potty." Malfoy vanished the mirror and started to the entrance looking sickeningly pleased with himself, the warm glow of the candles inside looking extraterrestrial bouncing off his platinum blonde hair. Harry followed him, touching his head and whimpering quietly with the grief of his own lost locks.
"Magic is magic, Malfoy! It's not your choice or anyone else's who is inflicted with it. How can you blame muggle-borns for something they can't control? Would you rather they stay in the muggle world and learn their magic there? What is it you want them to do?"
He passed through towering trees and over far-reaching roots that could have been bigger than he was if above the ground. The canopy of leaves above him obscured the sky, and it felt cooler than on the walk there from the lack of sunlight. A layer of moisture settled on his skin, making his shirt stick and the hair at the nape of his neck curl. He could hear the distant whistle of birds and whirr of insects around him, but Draco kept his focus on the ground as he began to count.
“Step-brothers?” Blaise cried, incredulous. Draco assumed that laughing wouldn’t have helped the situation, but the elevator music in the background didn’t help him one bit.
to the ball, are you?" He was sauntering up to the three of them in a dramatic billow of his Slytherin robes and a shit-eating grin on his face. Hermione opened her mouth to reply before Harry stepped in front of her with a scathing look.
Draco's body flooded with fear. Could he run? Hide? Shit. Why did he leave the Invisibility Cloak in the corner…
" Moody whispered, and Draco's vision fell through as he became a creature of pain and heat, awareness of who he was replaced by lava through his veins and hot needles under his skin.
Harry felt Hermione lean over their shoulders to check their notes, a habit she had developed over the years. Harry attributed the act alone to how Ron and Harry made it all the way to Fourth Year.
"Right." Sirius braced himself and held up his wand. Draco cleared his throat and Harry saw him raise an eyebrow at his already raised hand.
"And I'll be here." Harry sighed sorrowfully. Draco squeezed his shoulder once, then turned to face the meeting. Bill was waiting for him, and Draco braced himself with a deep breath.
"Don't take that tone with your mother." His father passed by behind him, hitting him lightly on the side of the head.
Harry felt his eye twitch, not unlike Umbridge’s did that morning, but kept his smile consistent. “It’s totally fine! We’re cool, alright?”
Draco took a deep breath, "I looked in to it after you mentioned it. I never had the time to really talk about it, to be honest, but I came across something that might be useful a few months ago. It's something called a Fidelius Charm."
Harry knocked on the door of Draco's room later that night, his stomach full to the brim from the celebratory dinner they'd thrown for him. There were whispers throughout that Dumbledore would be there for it, but of course he wasn't. He couldn't even spare Harry a glance when the trial ended, let alone show up for some light socialising with the people working with him.
After a moment of the entire class just staring at her, she sealed the letter and sent it Draco’s direction with a wave of her wand. He caught it quickly.
"Amelia Bones?" Draco asked. He'd heard the name before from his father, along with a few added comments that had Draco's own mother tutting disapprovingly. Then again, it wasn't a surprise that his father hated the Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement.
"He probably hates me." Draco sighed, not listening to Harry and imagining all the ways Sirius Black may want to murder him at the moment. "Death Eater's
Draco froze, hand on his wand. He slowly looked up. As far as he knew, he was alone. Unless he was seriously ill, or confunded, or going insane, or all three, a disembodied voice really just said his name.
"Regardless, Draco. I've decided I won't give word of this to you mother and father, although I am sure you can imagine if they knew."
"Do you really not know who she's going with?" Ron asked earnestly. Harry silently nodded, shaking the whole chair as he did. He looked at the clock on the wall, seeing they had two hours until the Ball. Why were people already getting ready?
"Yeah, I'm sure." Ronald grinned like the cat that caught the canary. "You look completely alright. You've only just almost cursed yourself several times in the past hour-"
Ronald blinked once, then gestured around the room extravagantly, "Well, I don't see another bloke here."
"Obviously not, Hermione." Ron chuckled without looking up. Hermione just rolled her eyes and grabbed Ron's textbook from where his arm had been resting on. Ignoring his grunt of annoyance, she flicked through the pages while speaking,
"What about at school?" Harry said, interrupting Draco's muttering's about disorganised library sections.
"Fine. I'm going - but not because you told me to!" Harry said, getting up and dusting off his trousers, "I left Ron and Seamus in a chess match and Seamus should have lost by now. Best be there for Ron to tell me about it."
“Oh — that’s brilliant!” said Harry, guilt seeping into his chest. “Merlin, I’ve been a terrible friend haven't I? I didn’t even ask you first thing-”
"Harry, come and eat first." Draco said to him at some point as he was checking on the second batch of eggs he was cooking up.
______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Upon realizing this, Draco immediately switched to the defensive. She had seemed awfully curious about the diary, and Draco couldn't afford to let anyone know about what it could actually do. “Yes. But who’s to say it wasn’t a rhetorical question? Small talk, and all that,” Daphne said, letting out a huff of laughter.
“There. Now we’re even. You don’t tell Snape about that punch, and I won’t tell Mcgonagall about the harassment. Got it?” Fred grumbled.
Still, Draco had a mischievous thing called pride. And, though he wouldn’t do anything brash, he wasn’t going to fully submit either. “I only stated the truth,” Draco spit out.
Narcissa pursed her lips together and met Lucius’s steely gaze. She really did try to be sensible when it came to Lucius’s say on how Draco should be brought up. The pureblood customs, for example, where indefinitely things she agreed with and wished for Draco to be exposed to. The same with some basic dark magic knowledge- afterall, most dark curses really weren’t evil or anything. In fact, they only got a bad reputation because of muggleborn ideals; often ones from the medieval age no less. She scoffed, ‘and they call pureblood traditions ancient.’ However, when it came to things that could put her son in danger, or things severely outdated, she wouldn’t hesitate to protest against Lucius’s aspirations for their son.
“I suppose so, but I wasn’t trying to sneak up on you dear. Do you underestimate my intellect that much?” Narcissa smiled, voice quiet and warm.
Dumbfounded, Draco gave the headmaster a silent, questioning look. Dumbledore, unaware, simply laid the yellow candy in front of him. He reached out for the candy and held it between his fingers- fiddling with it absently. “If you don’t want it, Mr. Malfoy, Fawkes would be more than happy to take it off your hands.”
Draco looked at Daphne in surprise- he hadn’t known she was joining him. The other second year Slytherins weren’t anywhere in sight, and she and Draco hardly spent time alone together. Now that he thought about it, it seemed as though the others had been trying to keep Daphne from being alone with Draco.
Yes, this could work. Draco gulped, “Then all I need to do is give this diary to the Weasley then? Couldn’t I simply give it to Potter himself? That’s who the Dark Lord wants.”
Draco perked up at that. He hoped he knew what the Slytherin was implying. “You’ll let me help you now?”
Draco had been in the zone- intensely reading a passage about mandrakes- when Daphne interrupted him. With an internal sigh, he placed the book down. It would take some time to regain his focus anyways.
Daphne scrutinized him, “You still didn’t object to my claims. You aren’t doing research for your father, are you?”
A small part of Draco’s mind congratulated him on the fact that he was able to mix a smidge of the truth into this. It made him sound believable. At the same time, he hated how it made him inadvertently confront his emotions towards the diary, and the task in general. It made him wonder about what Riddle had done to him- and he really didn’t want his thoughts to go there.
———————————————————————————————————----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
At that, Potter resumed his embarrassed expression and sat up to get the dried nettle from the storage closet. Draco shook his head and finally calmed down. ‘I swear, that Gryffindor will kill us all one day. And he’s supposed to be the bloody saviour of the wizarding world.’
“No!” Draco shouted. “I was responsible!” He was adamant. Making a last minute decision, Draco let the incriminating words flow out of his mouth. “Nobody else could’ve done this! I have literal blood on my hands!” He thrust his hands forwards to enunciate his point.
Draco’s mouth felt dry. Severus was right. His father would never order Draco to harm his academic or social careers; even if he requested he work on a side project, he wouldn’t expect Draco to put it above his other priorities. ‘But...hasn’t he done exactly that this year?’ Draco’s mind countered.
Just thinking about him put Draco in an awful mood. Potter, the boy who’d taken Ronald Weasley’s hand in friendship rather than his. And then, to top it all, he had the headmaster wrapped around his finger; the precious golden boy of Gryffindor, who had earned points along with his friends for doing just about nothing right before Slytherin had rightfully won the house cup. Because, honestly, why wouldn’t he? Every professor there practically adored him anyways- except Snape of course, but then, the man usually disliked just about anyone outside of Slytherin house.
"What's wrong, Draco?" Harry asked, having come up to the top floor with him to explore some of the other rooms.
"That we're friends, of course!" He called back, and turned away again before he could see the boy's reaction. The split second of realisation in the boy's eyes had been enough.
“Harry? Are you sick?” It was Ron again, but this time he was closer and was placing a hand on Harry’s back. Harry looked up to see his friend’s worried face in the mirror and he immediately looked away wearily as nausea threatened to take him under again.
"Well, not exactly. Can you promise you'll let me explain?" He asked intently. Draco almost refused and demanded to know what the fuck was going on, but his curiosity overruled him. He nodded slowly, half-expecting Black to just pop up out of a bush somewhere.
