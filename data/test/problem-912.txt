our speech, our symbols, our nuances.’
Yet, in these deeper parts something had changed…drastically.
Before he passed them to Harry, he hesitated a little.
Minerva shared a shocked yet knowing look with the Headmaster. The boy was a Parselmouth.
‘Hello, there little-un. Yer the one who’s been ‘elping wi’ ‘th mares?’ Hagrid asked.
Harry was still too small to reach of the taller branches – those ones always had the juicier fruits. He could sometime rope Colther in to helping him get those, but the snake tended to eat more than he picked.
Here goes nothing, he said to himself with a grim expression.
Language. The boy was raiding his mind for language.
Hagrid felt the familiar puff of pride. Albus always treated Hagrid like an equal, even if the half-giant didn’t think he’d deserved it.
It screamed again, it sounded like frustration. Harry didn’t run like it tried to. He walked calmly, always pressing forward, always throwing more and more at it. Harry’s hand moved like they were weaving; pushing and pulling at the dead wood, leaves and animal carcasses and forging them into a writhing being of many arms, hands and sharp nails.
He turned and was then startled by a small creature with pale, silvery features. It was staring at Harry – reeking of fear.
‘But his magic-.’
The werewolves and Aragog’s rancid children always crept around the edges of his territory. Mosag, the female spider was the worst of the lot. She often sent her children out often to find Harry. They all seemed to think of Harry as some kind of prize. Harry smiled as he daydreamed ripping their legs off and setting fire to them all. Though, he knew he couldn’t, the forest had all kinds of children, most of them unpleasant. Aragog and Mosag; he couldn’t touch – no matter how easy it would be to make them choke on his poisonous power.
Lupin then brought out a lump of wet mud, or clay as it was called in this new language. The Professor then took his wand and the clay morphed into a set of three teacups, all painted white with gold embellishments.
Draco backed away from the door and walked back to his dorm with a pensive expression.
‘Albus?’ Minerva probed cautiously. No wonder, Albus and the boy must have made quite the visual; an old man grinning and making odd noises with his eyes closed as magic whipped around a boy who resembled the fabled Pan of the Wild.
Noticing how disgruntled was at the difference Lupin chuckled slightly.
Draco had whined after the third attempt to capture the Professor’s attention. ‘You’re not listening!’
Harry stretched and took note of the suns position as Colther snapped at the wolf circling him. ‘Well, that was enough excitement for one day I think.’
Then he remembered the stench from this morning and groaned again.
This thing was a mound of black on the forest bed. It suckled at its prey, completely unaware of the green pair of eyes watching it. The sickly-sweet scent of Unicorn blood carried, and it turned Harry’s stomach.
The creature stared at him, seemingly in shock. Harry wanted to stare back, but then it was raising that branch in his hand again, the one the dancing light flew from. A bright green spark flitted by Harry’s head after he gently side stepped its course.
With his heart in his mouth and sweat on his palms, Draco steeled himself and pushed forward. He reasoned that he survived the Forest before, and that he was not going in
‘Hunt?’ Snape asked softly, one brow arched. Maybe it was an involuntary reaction to potion fumes.
‘In the Forest Albus?’ Minerva probed gently but resoundingly skeptical. ‘I doubt none, except perhaps Hagrid, would last too long that deep within the Forest - never mind a
‘Euthanasia.’ Cross said quietly.
‘No.’ He said gently. ‘But we knew your parents when they were still alive.’ Albus thought it was almost cruel to tell the boy so quickly that his parents had not lived – but lies and deceit were quick butchers of good faith, and that was what he needed from the boy then. To trust them.
‘He was here Albus. The whole time…alone?’ Remus asked quietly.
still and stare at the boy below him.
Albus steeled himself.
Stickes sneered internally.
‘We’ve no choice.’ Stone shook. ‘My girls…I won’t be able to look at them if I did, he’s younger tha- fuck..’ Stone would never see them again if he didn’t do this. Would be able to look at his wife and kids if he did.
Again, Snape did not answer him. He was too engrossed in whatever it was that he was analysing. He did so with an intensity that suggested the substance would solve all of Severus’ problems and woes. Or maybe make him fantastically rich in the process.
The hairy creature made distressed noises whispered into the ears of the mares, trying to offer small comforts to ease their pains. Its massive hands shook went he petted at the too thin Unicorn, which was curled up on the ground, its breaths laboured, its leg clearly broken and bent at an awful angle.
The creatures power danced within him in a lurching, sickly rhythm. Though it didn’t move, merely trembled with wide eyes and gasping breaths.
Albus clapped his hands, snapping the two men out of there contemplative trances.
‘We expect nothing of you except that you find a home here Harry. As for what you
‘Do bugger all you mean?’ Harry piped up as he ran his fingers through the feathers of his arrows menacingly.
Colther shook his head in exasperation. ‘
typically with a weapon or restraining devices like a snare or net. The objective is to catch the prey, one way or the other. I mean, I knew some people didn’t partake, but Severus I am surprised that you have not heard of the activity! It’s rather good for the legs and lungs I must say-.’
James’ face crumpled.
‘Firenze?’ Stickes asked nervously into the unseasonably cool air.
‘Milk? Sugar, Harry?’
‘I’ve seen anything like that.’ Stone looked shiftily back at the door. ‘Not in a kid anyway.’
when the boy seemed to catch on his ticklish sides.  The others stood stunned as the boy then wriggled under Severus’ robes and the typically dour Professor yelped.
Harry shook his head quickly, dislodging
‘Aye. I’ve asked th’ centaurs and the spiders. They don’ ‘ave a clue what’s out there. But they're sure something is.’
Withheld groans and bitten tongues were also instinctive by now. The mild amusement surrounding Stickes and his partners second name had been bled dry a few days after they’d been paired.
‘Isn’t the Potter kid about a year old?’ Stones said sceptically.
Draco returned from a rather stressful night of detention, and being accosted by Forest monsters, he had some serious questions.
‘You?’ Harry asked, a tone of danger which belied his years coloured his voice. ‘It smelled like that, only stronger.’ Harry was now baring his teeth. ‘Did you drink from them too?’ His questions shot from him like bullets as he stepped forward threateningly. ‘Did you hurt them too?’
‘Says you.’ Jonah then looked at his friend who he had first met in the forest all those years ago when he was lost and scared. ‘Wizards can’t find him.’ He reminded the centaur backing away slowly. ‘I’ll check in you soon.’ He took out his wand, giving one last glance to Harry before he disappeared with a snap.
He reminded himself glibly as he neared the hut.
‘How did you stop him, Harry?’
‘Only because you get snippy when I don’t.’ Harry protested before he stuck out his tongue.
Next thing Draco knew, he was on his arse outside the Severus’ quarters and the door was slammed shut behind him.
‘I think I’ve found dinner.’
Hagrid brought some crusts of the dried pastes to Albus and Severus; eyebrows raised when he’d told them that all of wounds had cleared up, as if the Unicorn’s had never been injured in the first instance. Even the young male was now trotting about the place, its hind leg was not perfect, but a damn sight better than what it would have been otherwise.
The forest floor was teaming with life here. Deciduous trees thrived and bore fruit, others flowered, and all stood tall
The creature moved in its own dark blur. Like a plume of smoke, it shifted then formed again now ten paces away from Harry.
And he could think of another who might be feeling the same, if not worse.
, Draco took note of how silent it was.
The other creatures that normally scurried and tittered here and there were now horribly silent. He clambered down the tree, berries in tow and landed with a practised, soft thud on the forest floor. He carefully placed the bowl down, his eye flicking from side to side, watching – waiting. He never let his back turn away from the tree and kept within a few paces of the colt who was now breathing harshly.
Harry couldn’t remember much before the hut. When he tried it hurt.
‘Just my fuckin’ luck.’ Stickes groaned. Chris or ‘Cross’ as he’d been nicknamed in the department (more likely he’d given it to himself) was a pain in the arse just shy of impaling yourself on a sharpened pike.
Shockingly cold hands reached his temples and then Albus’ eyes fluttered closed under a disorientating wash of sensation.
dancing in the air; a brave one landed on his beard as he pulled his jaw off the floor.
‘Bedtime, I think.’ Albus smiled as he waved towards the bed. ‘I will be in my office, or chambers. Both are up the stairs outside the door. Call on me if you have any questions, otherwise I’ll meet you here in the morning before breakfast.’
Stickes checked over the infant again, and his back whilst he was at it. The Healers had checked him over, but to calm his racing mind he needed to check him over again. He realised he must have looked somewhat crazed, he probably was.
‘The essay on types of spell? Are you joking?’ Another boy chimed in.
James and Lily were experienced in defensive arts. Merlin, they had seen the worst of Harry’s turbulent magic and had
‘Hagrid – I wouldn’t-.’ Lupin started, but Hagrid cut him off with a furious, dismissive wave.

Swallowing audibly, Harry then pulled hard at the door which swung out with an awful dull
At first Harry thought he only looked after the Unicorns until he got a glimpse inside the hut while the creature was off tending to the Thestral’s. Eggs, nests, hay, and big clear bowls filled with water. All of them had an animal or creature of sorts inside them and the hut was

tracked the prints through the trees, where they started to become a little too dense for the half giant’s comfort. He was a large man, and it wouldn’t do any good to be stuck among them.
was like more specifically.
‘You little-.
Severus gave Draco a strange stare as if Draco were a hair in his soup. Strange, the man must have been coming down with something.
When he finally caught up with them, somewhat struggling to breathe and spitting out beard hairs, he saw that they’d surrounded the boy, holding him at wandpoint. The boy had burrowed himself into a small thicket, the shadows hiding his face. The light only rested on his eyes which were startlingly green and very,
The forest enveloped him in darkness and embraced him into its shadows. He was mist, and peaty fog crawling over the forest bed.
But all those thoughts stuttered to a halt when he saw the boy bend down to the bucket, peer left to right, and then pull of the red cloth that covered his torso.
‘Ah think th’ boy needs a rest, Albus.’ Hagrid interrupted Severus before the Potions Professor could ask anymore questions. ‘Th’ boy’ll be dead on his feet.’
But there it was, still laying on its side as it had been for a couple of weeks now. Though now, it had orange sludge and threadbare fabric wrapped around its leg staved with an oddly straight piece of dead wood. What was even more curious it that when Hagrid had checked on them last night there was none of this. And to his disbelief he found a small green hand print on the young mares hide.
Lily stated, giving no room for argument as she stroked Harry’s cheek.
Hagrid was a half-giant and that meant sometimes he didn’t know his own strength. He was mindful to be extremely gentle as he tapped the salve on the gaping wound.
Stone was always cool and calm. Though, this would break him.
Firenze smiled right back at him. ‘Go.’ He ordered. ‘Go do all that sunbathing you kept griping on about as a teen. You are far to pale for a man your age.’
Though, for something to drain a like that Unicorn did not bode well at all for anyone inside
The other Professor took their seats, all of them watching Harry as if he were the oddest sight they had ever laid eyes on. Though perhaps he was, he didn’t look much like them.
‘Hmm?’ Severus made a noise like he was agreeing with whatever Draco had just said, a clear sign he was
There was a strange look on Albus’ face, and Hagrid thought he knew why. With the same care Hagrid had just taken, Albus slowly neared with his palms out and facing upwards.
Harry was then met with a room filled with boys his age, dressed in black and green. He was above them, in one of the arcs that made up the roof above their beds. Immediately below him were thick beams of dark wood, like those he’d seen in the dark space before, only these were polished to a shine and lights hung from them.
‘Did he say when it might arrive next?’ Severus asked.
Harry was thinking about how he would approach the topic of wolf and pack – one that Lupin seemed keen to avoid- when the man handed Harry a piece of white wood.
Which of course there was, everyone knew that.
‘Is the boy a wolf?’ Severus asked, paling slightly.
‘We can’t move him. He won’t let us.’ Cross interrupted. ‘Two Aurors are already at St. Mungos and Bagshot barely dodged when she tried too – not to mention the Healers.’
There was a small nick on Hagrid’s hand from where the branches had whipped at him as he’d ran after the boy. He opened the tub and then put a small amount on, showing the boy it healing up.
eaten; the fat of the animals he hunted or the tartness of the berries he picked.
Harry came closer to Albus again, leaning into the man as if Albus had been whispering.
Harry smiled at the lazy snake and poked him. ‘You
He was covered in patches of different coloured pastes; his arms were steeped in the stuff to his elbows. He kept applying it to the mares liberally in soft continuous circles and hush, hissing whispers. The sound made Draco’s hair stand on end.
Hagrid was a comfort throughout the walk to Albus’ rooms. The fact that these people had multiple rooms boggled the mind.
They followed cross up the carpeted stairs. As the arrived nearer the nursery, the air thickened, and the stench rose.
‘- found more prints. Hagrid says it keeps coming from the west-side of the Forest.’
Harry found himself wringing his hands often in those moments. The hesitancy he felt about approaching the creature warred with the notion that something would change if he did. He couldn’t know if it would be for better or worse. He remembered Colther’s quiet warning about creatures that looked like Harry and had experienced their violence and strange power first-hand.
But the boy who had feared him did.
He then learned that the creature was welcomed by the Forest. It herded and fed the creatures within, always with his calm noises and gentle hands. Harry had seen him birth beasts, clean hooves, brush wings, and nuzzle into them when he was done.
‘Yes, of course.’ Harry nodded quickly.
Colther
He’d found him again.
Then the curious mind left Albus, as did cool fingers.
‘You’re trying to tell me the infants a suspect?’ Stickes felt his own brows raise higher.
He hooted in victory when Harry caught the last one, which had been made more difficult because he had to do so gently and without his gift. He was too wary to use it in case it hurt them.
The process was normally revolting, but in this heat is was downright revolting. Taking breaths through his mouth did not help, he could taste it – the spider silk cloth over his mouth did little to help.
Harry could hear the creatures approaching, their colourful power lighting up the darkness between the trees. He could hear Hagrid bellowing and the loud thumps of his footfalls and bellow shouts.
Albus looked at the concentric rings again, utterly fascinated. Hagrid knew Albus could feel the magic in it, Hagrid could too. The old magic, deep in the roots and soil. Such old magic that it was rare nowadays. That only made the whole thing more curious.
I-I was checking…checking to see-
shame.’ The snake was pointedly looking away from Harry. ‘I guess you won’t want what I’ve just found.’ Harry smirked at the snake chanced a glance in Harry’s direction.
Then the common thread clicked in Albus’ mind.
The snake hissed, now affronted. ‘And who is it that keeps feeding me blackberries?’
After that, he began following the creature often with a curiosity that ate away at him. Harry always egged himself on to do the stupidest things sometimes;
Albus suspected he looked somewhat like Snape and Lupin did then - tense, pale, and a little haunted.
When he arrived at the enclosure again, he was gasping for breath and roughly trying to calm himself.
He couldn’t see his face, not clearly. As the boy pottered and smeared paste on the scrapes and scuff each mare sported, Draco could make out a mess of dreaded hair, thin limbs, and odd black markings that looked as if they swirled on the surface of the boy’s ashen skin.
There had been a bad thunderstorm and the Hippogriff and Thestral’s enclosure had been torn down. A few of the younglings had gotten lost in the chaos of it all. Hagrid had been sweating trying to find them. He’d been crestfallen when after two days they’d remained lost; their mother’s still moaning for them with heart-breaking calls.
‘Yes, a large part of Transfiguration is changing the state of one thing to resemble another. It’s a skill you will learn in time. You have already achieved the first step which is changing an objects state. You will make it resemble something else entirely with a little practice.’ Lupin enthused.
As the creature turned to leave, Harry followed it after they untangled from the vines. As he tracked it, Harry realised that the thing was much taller than he’d previously assumed; Harry was only as tall as its mid-thigh.
‘Magic folk?’ Harry echoed.
Turning to hide the boy away from the bodies for a moment, Stickes cast a few quick cleaning charms and cast a glamour on them.
‘Been some time since some like tha’ happened, eh Severus?’ Hagrid bantered with a booming laugh.
‘Dead. Death Eaters.’ Cross offered.
‘The Potter child, Harry. He was found alive with the victims, mortem says its been a week.’ Cross continued with a furrowed brow. ‘Healers say he’s healthy and that magic your sensing? Well, it’s his apparently.’
‘Are you taking me away?’ He asked. ‘Will I come back?’
Draco’s first inclination was to creep back to Severus’ quarters and explain. To say that he’d been wrong and that it wasn’t a creature that had run away from Draco, but a boy who looked poorly dressed for such a cold night in September. His second was to run up to the boy, consequences be damned, and do…something. The third and perhaps the most sensible was to stay
Harry hushed them all, including Colther – he wasn’t about to suffer
Stickes stood still. There was no need to travel. Though after ten minutes he itched to.
to be bitten.’ Colther reared up.
Albus smiled at them.
‘I’ll need to hunt soon. You joining me for that?’ Harry asked as he spied a cowberry bush, the red fruits ripe and glistening with the morning dew.
So engrossed in the task, Harry hadn’t heard the creature arrive behind him. He didn’t have a clue he had company until the thing whimpered in shock.
Then Draco panicked simultaneously over the boy perhaps scenting him, and if there were other werewolves in the Forest with them.
He could hear him breathe. Draco could see the boy enjoy the fruits and small chicken sandwiches he’d brought for him. The boy smelled like the lemony soap Draco had brought him.
‘And that would be…’ Harry probed.
He rushed in straight to where the water was at its deepest. When it reached his ribs, he took a breath and sank into it completely. He let the current wash away the stinking pulp and the heat induced haze.
And in the coming months, Albus’ features became more grim with each new body found.

He took a few measured steps back, the soles of his feet now warmed by the silvery blood.
He reached down to touch his side and felt along a bleeding gash.
thought he’d known pain before this moment. He had. But rarely had it cut so deep.
Harry nodded quickly, watching the change sin Albus’ expression carefully.
‘It’ll be colder soon.’ Harry said as he filled the bowl. With a wave of his hand he made it a bit deeper in case the blueberries had ripened too. ‘So, the next hunt is going to be the big one.’
‘What’s that?’
Harry was seemingly lost on Hagrid’s unique accent, Albus had to stifle a small chuckle.
‘Ah, I do not think there is any cause for concern. It does not seem to be a malevolent force.’
She cooed at Harry, her finger tracing his small chin.
Harry thought.
like tart, dark fruits and the blood of raw meat.
‘Why ever not? That’s the best part!’ Colther hissed furiously.
Then that awful feeling prickled at the back of his neck.
me! Get – him – off – me –
He kept his eyes flickering from side-to-side. He knew that the teachers could be crawling around these parts and if he weren’t careful, detention would be the least of his worries.
‘What happened?’ He asked.
The child pivoted quickly, his face lighting up in surprise at the blooms spreading and climbing around him. He bubbled with delighted laughter then.
He stretched out his bow, his arms roiling with the tension as his arrowhead tracked something in the distance Harry could not yet see, only feel. Harry feared the creature was back again and quickly he rushed up the nearest fir with feline grace to get a better vantage point.
Stickes thought as he Banished the maggots and flies.
‘Stop chasing ‘im, yah bleedin’ nutters! You’ve just gone an’ spooked ‘im!’ Hagrid shouted out to four very deaf ears.
rings on a tree that could only be five years old at most. He knew this, the white marker he’d left several years prior was on the ancient pine right next to it.
‘I’ll do it.’ Stickes said numbly. ‘Just go.’
The boy had heard the sloshing and quickly turned to
When Draco arrived those final few nights, the boy didn’t come.
In the long grass, kneeling on the dry, cracked ground Harry wished for rain.
As Albus left Harry was then confronted with the minefield that was his new temporary hut –
yer’ scarin’ ‘im!’ Hagrid shouted as he chased behind four
And Hagrid was helping them.
Hagrid had sniffled then grunted angrily at the third body he’d found – this one was much deeper in the forest. It had died painfully; bite marks, welts and bruises littered is neck – most of which was missing, like the beast had fed on the flesh too.
With a wave of his hand Albus first made the windows vanish entirely, then he brought them back, only this time they shone with an amber sunset over a loch rather than the grey clouds and trees. Then it darkened and the window glittered with the light of the moon and stars.
Thoughts of little Andrew assaulted him as he took in the little boy still in the cot, still staring at his parents.
Breaking the surface against with a quiet gasp, he looked around carefully. He’s just spooked some deer that had caught scent of the pulp he’d just washed off. Though, except for the quiet sounds of the smaller creatures – he was alone for now.
Lupin was also a werewolf, though he hid it well. Stranger still was that Lupin’s wolf seemed to know Harry, if the scent of
Dark as pitch and it made the small hairs on Albus’ neck raise and unbidden thoughts of Ariana step forward from the shadows of his mind. It was an ancient kind of power, one that moved mountains and roamed deeper than even the eldest tree roots.
‘Try.’ Lupin passed him one of the thinner books.
A large part of Harry wanted to jump down and finally meet the other boy. And now that he could, speak to him.
‘We’ll have our hands full then, don’t you both think? So much to learn and discover. A true joy, yes?’
Albus watched all of this with a strange feeling inside his chest. The sensation flooded his gut a little when Remus neared him with a vexed expression.
He heard the boy murmur.
‘Stay here.’ He murmured carefully to the pack. ‘Keep it in your sight.’
Hagrid softly repositioned the boy in his arms and helped lift the hat that they boy was now struggling with. His cheeks hurt with how hard he was smiling.
As the bucket plopped beside the woven fence, Draco sunk lower to the ground to hide himself.
‘Will I be able to visit my friends in the forest?’
‘They are both quite delicious.’ Minerva chimed in when she spotted Harry’s quiet panic. ‘If you don’t like them, there are a hundred ways to have tea.’
Snape sighed. ‘Albus, whatever it may be is something that can clearly survive among that rancid lot – something that may not want to be found.’
‘It felt -
‘Does he?’ The pain of grief tinged Lupin’s response.
‘I was hoping that you could manipulate the beach wood in the same manner you did with the dead roots when we first met you.’ Lupin said as he gestured for Harry to try.
Whatever it was, it wasn’t of the forest. It stank worse than the pulp he had made that morning.
‘Well, that’s a
As Relga hiccupped and belched after a particularly long swig, Draco inched the door open and slowly made his was outside into the cold, brisk night.
on his hands and the edges of his face like tiger stripes.
‘Well, I don’t starve – do I? Unlike some…’ Colther’s jowls inched up as if he were grinning.
Suddenly, the chair Lupin had sat on began to float, mimicking the movements of his wand as the Professor waved it from side to side slightly.
‘That is unusual, but all good things can be.’ He answered cryptically.
‘You planned this. Brought us here to kill a kid.’ Stickes said lowly, his nausea racked up a few notches.
'Quirrell?' Remus asked.
The pulp was ready,
souls.’ He snorted.
‘Yes. If I didn’t know better, I’d say you almost sound excited, Severus.’
The child was now in the corner of his cot, as if he wanted to hide.
‘Raise your hands.’ Albus guided gently. ‘Show him you are unarmed.’
‘Doesn’t really look like the others either, this one has
despite there being hardly any sunlight for them to grow to such heights. Small animals flurried and frenzied away from Hagrid, the noise of them all surprising him after miles and miles of too-quiet and too-tense. There was fungi and flowers that Hagrid had never seen before, big blooms and heady scents wafted towards him, making him sneeze on more than one occasion.
James struggled to form the question.
.’ Stones stared wide eyed at the child. ‘Fucking hell! What the hell are we meant to do with
‘I’m not late, am I?’ He asked.
With that thought, Harry pulled on his hair, then began to run his fingers through it, clearing off the dirt and leaves. After his skin had turned somewhat numb from the icy water, Harry moved to the bank, shaking off the water and summoning his red robe with a flick of the wrist. Once covered, he made the careful walk back to his hut. There was a good amount of light today – a rare occasion in the forest. So when Harry arrived, he took up his carving knife and stone file before sitting on the hut step and began tending to his spears and shivs – a task which demanded a lot of visibility and concentration, lest he lose of thumb.
‘The fuck? You’re gonna’ put us in Azkaban for not killing a child?’ Stones all but screamed, and Stickes fell back a few steps. ‘Gonna’ strip us ‘cause we won’t kill a fucking innocent kid?!’
‘We will speak of this later.’ He said pointedly, Draco’s shoulder rose to his jaw at the sound.
A few years, not even a decade – now
‘Do as I say, and not as I do and all that.’ The boy, Theo, griped.
For days after, Harry was too anxious to return. He really hadn’t wanted to be seen by one of those creatures. Colther had explained that they were many in number and probably wouldn’t be best pleased that Harry was among the creatures of the Forest or that he’d been so close to them all this time. He said that they tended to harm that which they did not understand, or those they felt threatened by.
living their whole lives in every moment, forever.
Hagrid shook his head again, then smiled softly.
‘Nonsense. I’m simply concerned for the welfare of our students and resident creature, since this stuff is being slathered over the latter by something which might harm the former.’ The Potions Master scoffed.
He moved closer to the ice-white creature, trying to catch his name in the hubbub of loud conversation.
The forest had always been a dark and dank place. Hardly anything grew in it. Often Hagrid’s walks through the place was accompanied by the foul stench of death and decay – the forest always had such little life in it.
had discovered that Hogwarts was
A snort from Lupin resulted in the boy bounding over to him and grabbing his arm upwards and sniffing at him. The boy then yipped like a cub would and Lupin stilled for a moment, his amber eyes widening. The little one reached up to his head and grabbed it down to his eye-level; the pull nearly sent Lupin arse over elbow. Righting himself with flailing arms, Remus then stared at the boy with a dumbfounded expression at the boy nudged his forehead against his. The boy yapped again, this time it raised at the end, as if he were asking a question.
With a growling hiss Harry clapped his hands together, and the earth rumbled and shook under the red-wool being. The earth split, and it cried out as it was swallowed into the chasm Harry had created.
‘Aye – there been a lot o’ change deeper in.’ Hagrid stated. ‘There even
The two Auror’s snapped their own shields up, nearly clipped by the fall out. The air now smelled electric and sickly-sweet, like the bodies on the floor still staring at them all.
‘The differences between our magics will incur complications. At first, I suspect it will be like two people with different mother tongues trying to hold a conversation. But it is nothing to feel anxious over. We will help you to the best of our ability, I and my staff.’ Albus gestured behind him. ‘I have experience with your kind of magic – my own sister was like you.’
Harry could hear every heartbeat, every footstep, every breath of his home. He listened until it called back to him.
Albus then approached Harry before crouching down until they were at eye-level with one another.
sounded to the right of where they’d just been foraging.
Then the dark lifted, and the sun broke through the canopy.
This was now his sixth journey through the deeper parts, an area that any sane person would tend to avoid if they liked living. The Forest promised no kindness. But Hagrid knew these parts better than most, and with his trusty crossbow in tow – he was willing to take the risk.
Albus’ expression was something between fascination and wonder as he took the boy in. His features slowly bloomed into a beaming smile when the boy visibly relaxed. He grinned stupidly when the little one climbed round into Hagrid’s surprised arms.
‘Do you think he’d attack us?’ Harry asked the snake in a small voice as they lay within a burrow of blankets and hay in the corner of the hut.
Colther snorted when they tried to herd them; the young ones were swift, and the winged ones were more than a little snappish when Harry tried to near them. He ran and dived after them, falling and slipping in mud branches and huffing in frustration. Harry rushed at them, using his slightly larger frame and arms to swoop them up before tying a length of soft cord around their necks.
Severus might hang his by his thumbs.
And now,
Not that they would do much good where he was going.
The Headmaster paused a little longer, looking between Harry and the hatch, before he sighed slightly then offered Harry a small dish of lemon drops.
‘Nothing?’ Albus echoed.
After that Lupin dismissed him, telling Harry he could spend the next couple of hours at his leisure – as long as he did so within these new rules. He was meant to meet with the Headmaster again tonight, and Harry would be lying if he said he didn’t have serious questions.
Harry’s eyes snapped to the left and he bared his teeth in a strange grin. He looked over and a strange giddiness overtook him; manic, gleeful impatience.
He looked right in the boy’s eyes then, holding them like he would with any creature that had its hackles risen. Hagrid then held his hands up, showing the boy that he was defenseless, that he wasn’t going to harm the boy.
Harry’s grin was sticky, but no less glorious.
‘And drastic measures entails…?’ Stickes pushed.
Instead, Draco conjured a bucket of warm water, a rag, and a bar of lemon soap before levitating closer to the boy.
It was with careful, quiet steps that Draco made his way from his bed, down to the common room, past the dormitory portrait, through the dungeon corridors and up the winding stairs to the small door.
It should terrify him, but Albus didn’t typically pander to what was expected of him or even what he expected of himself sometimes.
.’ Stone was fisting his own hair.
Gods, he’d almost forgotten the child’s name.
‘I…understand.’ Harry ground out.
With a nod Harry let his magic explore the wood, then with a smile, it sharpened to a pike before Harry threw it into the wall behind them.
when inquisitive, inky fingers reached out and squashed his cheeks together. And a chuckle escaped when the boy pulled at Albus’ hat and the boy put it on, only for it to swamp his head completely.
dealt with it completely unscathed. Always!
Then the boy started prodding and pulling at different things on Hagrid’s face as if he’d never seen a face before and was trying very hard to work out what it was. He seemed particularly taken with the mass of Hagrid’s hair; he’d grabbed large clumps of it and pulled the frizz out to its ends as if he’d never seen anything like it before, making odd hissing noises as he did so.
Harry trailed it until the trees of the Forest started thinning, so much further East than he ever traveled before. Hesitating, Harry stopped following for a few beats; it was far too open here, and these parts of the woods were dark and felt too still.
Lily nodded,
And then it screamed.
one was searching for its kin. They both smelled similarly awful, like they had been in close contact for a long time.
‘Or what? You’ll bite me?’ Harry jeered.
‘You seen any dead wood down there Colther?’ Harry called down.
With one last look back at the wan faces of the other Professors, Harry was guided through to a new room.
Instantly, black vines were wrenched from the ground beneath the boy’s feet. They looked like the gnarled roots of dead trees and were sharp at the ends like thin pikes.
Moving about the room, Harry saw that it was old and might have once been beautifully decorated. There were crumbling portraits on the wall, some still, other moving so slow that Harry thought they must be feeling lethargic. The arches above him at one time may have been impressive with shining, dark stained wood. Now they looked a little grey and rotted, the teak paint peeling and floating in flecks to the ground.
The forest had that morning given him a hen that still needed plucking and an old rabbit that had died but was still warm to the touch. That same rabbit was carefully skinned and now hung in the hut, ready for stew.
Harry shot him a dark look. ‘Any excuse.’ Harry grumbled. ‘We will be hunting, because if not some of us might go hungry this Winter, and I’ll tell you now Colther, it won’t be me.’
He hit the ground with a hard roll and winded slightly he stood and swayed.
‘Did he kill his parents?’ Stickes didn’t want to let the child go, but he released him slowly into Firenze’s waiting arms.
He wanted to close his eyes for a few moments, but he never could. There were too many things out there that could be watching him, and he always had to stare right back.
The boy then stood before trying to scrape the muck off himself. He grew visibly frustrated when it seemed to cling to his skin. Draco itched to help; they had just learned about gentle cleaning charms that mimicked a sponge bath of warm soapy water. Draco feared that the boy had never seen soap and was appalled with the notion.
He could sense it. And for a moment, a blink, he felt off-kilter. He knew then that whatever this was like him and his mother, the forest – but so awfully different at the same time. His gooseflesh was a testament to that.
‘Correct.’ Cross said in a clipped tone. ‘So -
‘Like I said. You made the right choice.’ Firenze moved forward and held out his arms.
Draco had wanted to follow the boy in but cursed his own cowardice for how frozen his feet were then.
But somehow Malfoy had gotten lost and Hagrid had only realised it when he'd heard the poor boy yelp.
pick - and I’ll keep you company?’ He enunciated each word with a tap of his tail against Harry’s temple.
Then a shot of red light shot past his ear.
Not that he could care one whit about if a Weasley got lost in the Forest, but still.
He hadn’t made that mistake again.
Albus let out a soft, delighted ‘
Severus put down the book he had been reading to peer at Draco.
‘It’s a bit chilly.’ She said to the group. ‘-and it’s getting dark.’ She pointed to the horizon. ‘Shall we continue this in the castle?’ She turned to look between Harry and Albus. ‘You are more than welcome to join us Harry – unless anyone is expecting you?’
Hagrid was rambling and garbling when he all but hauled Albus into his hut after sending an urgent letter off to him - which he hardly ever did on account of his clumsy handwriting.
Draco heard clinking glass and thought Severus might have moved those thrice-damned vials of flakes he was obsessed with.
hen he took stock of how close it was to Harry’s hut.
'Yes - I mean - it was dark...and there were shadows - it looked like that to me.' The normally self-assured boy stuttered on.
He breathed a sigh of relief when he crested the hill and saw roughly twenty mares all mowing about within a fence of rough woven dark wood.  With a furrowed brow, he noted that he hadn’t heard his professors yet, despite having listened in on their plan earlier that day stating they’d be here.
Dumbledore smiled then made to leave before Harry stopped him.
Noticing that Severus was not standing to help Draco rid himself of the dandruff, which in Draco’s opinion was more than a little
The headmaster's brows rose to his hairline. He turned it in his hands, his own magic seeking and probing.
It made Harry feel…uneven. Like he was watching something he wanted to be part of but was not invited to. He didn’t know how to broach that instinct that wanted to reach out and…Harry honestly didn’t know what to wanted to do if he did.
‘I didn’t sign up for this.’ Stone said darkly.
how interested in those creatures he was to the others. His curiosity brimmed under the surface of his skin, begging him to follow the second creatures’ path north-east and discover more about it and these
‘You are all…complicated.’ Harry said as Hagrid showed him a chair covered in the softest material Harry had ever felt – velvet.
It was the hoot of an owl behind him that made Draco jump out of his skin. Then it was the snap of a branch that echoed loudly around the small clearing.
‘Well, whatever that is – it’s definitely cursed, if not dead already. You’d have to be insane to drink that stuff.’ Harry gestured to the blood before he brushed the mud off his knees.
Harry looked off into the trees, worrying his lip.
Draco then sank into desperation, his actions quickly becoming rasher and foolhardier.
Albus thought it sounded almost like a question, so he nodded at those curious eyes. He hoped the boy understood his affirmation – that and he hoped he hadn’t just agreed to anything
could be spelled as
He hesitated. But curiosity won over when he heard the rather large creature call out to something; the noises it made were guttural but melodic and it made Harry feel…calm.
That wound was still deep, but Dumbledore spoke around the tight feeling in his chest.
He never once looked back at the cot.
It was then the stories his father read to him and Aberforth before Arianna was born. Then came the ache in his hand when he was forced to write a letter to his Aunt thanking her for knitted pants that she had no business making
And there was magic in the air,
‘You don’t need to see this. Go. Go home to Sheila and the girls.’ Stickes sounded like a Muggle robot.
Harry nodded sheepishly. ‘I followed you.’ He said to Hagrid. ‘The Forest said to help – one of your kin hurt them badly.’
‘How did he get there?’ Severus probed. ‘He didn’t crawl from Godric’s Hollow.’
It had been Lupin who’d spied the little one first and quietly pointed to where he was perched on one of the higher branches of great oak. They had all stared at the boy for a few beats in shock as the child stared out into the distance. Hagrid was thinking the poor boy looked a bit forlorn when Snape had decided in his wisdom to shoot the boy with a
Hagrid realised that he’d been through these parts before some years back. He sometimes left a swipe of white paint on a boulder or a tree if he was exploring – just to make sure he didn’t get
It looked at Harry, its head tilted. And Harry grinned toothily right back at it.
In times of War, many people often went missing in the name of Magical Security. Stickes never thought it would happen to him, they were just rumours. But now it was his unavoidable reality.
‘Am no’ goin’ to hurt yeh.’ He repeated, seriously hoping the boy understood him. ‘Neither is tha’ sorry lot.’ He jerked his head behind him as he heard Snape huff.
It was so different from his own home; it was filled to the brim with strange items and materials Harry had never seen before. He traced his hands over strange fabrics and bowls with handles that had curious things painted on their surface.
‘I’m- I.’ Stickes words failed him, the past hour had caught up with him in the ten minutes of utter silence.
And the wee mans grin lit up the dark room.
The boy’s lip trembled. Stickes shushed him gently and then offered his hand to the infant.
‘Maybe – however it was powerful. The first I mean, not so much the second.’ Colther contemplated aloud.
One of the Obliviators called up after the bottom floor had quietened down.

It was silent except for the sound of the soap rubbing against slick cloth and the faint popping of the suds.
strenuous.
Over the next few days, the creature did his rounds and when he found the new carcasses Harry had left for the somewhat bloodthirsty mares, he searched the ground more intently; looking at Harry’s footprints with a furrowed brow when he found them.
‘Your magic is highly unusual. And can be somewhat dangerous. People in our world tend to dislike either of those things. Plus, there are things that revealing your identity would…complicate.’
‘Better that than getting fat.’ Harry said under his breath as he stepped from branch to branch, hauling himself carefully now the drop was higher.
The snake sniffed. ‘Because I keep you on your toes, if I left you with those damned wolves all of the time you might get fleas.’
After that Hagrid kept searching, always had an eye out whenever he done his rounds. There were more instances of strange but ultimately welcome occurrences.
Malfoy was then dismissed kindly with a steaming cup of hot chocolate for his nerves.
‘And just what do you think you are doing Mr Malfoy?’
But they did, and in
The Professor nodded before unpacking several books from his satchel.

screaming through the air was anything to go by.
Albus turned to look at the fatigued pair.
His voice broke on the last utterance. ‘They didn’t find them for
Stone growled. ‘I’m not doing this.’
Draco had never seen anything like it.
‘Yeah. Last time I tried, a whole tree rotted away.’ Harry sighed. ‘It’s always the same.’ Then Harry eyed the snake. ‘You can climb those quite easily-.’
‘I think so. I don’t think he’s met any Wizard before. Except the one he banished.’ Albus confirmed, his gut clenching at what he imagined was a terribly lonely existence.
‘It’s a dark night, Jonah. I’m glad you arrived.’ Firenze features were slowly lit by the subdued spark at Stickes wand.
‘Did you hear something?’
Stickes had lost his son. Like Jim it was nothing glamourous but it was horrifically quick. Cot death, the Healer had explained calmly to him and his sobbing now ex-wife. Little Andrew just fell asleep and didn’t wake back up again. There was nothing they could have done.
showing scenes of people fighting or dancing, sometimes both.
Stone laughed humourlessly. ‘You don’t know that he did. Even then, doesn’t mean we go about killing babies! God, could you imagine what would happen if The Prophet got a hold of that? No fuckin’ way am I going to have that kind of blood on my hands.’
‘Says the one who doesn’t even chew his food.’ Harry parried to which Colther hissed ominously before turning away pointedly.
Then the damned blond mop decided to greet them.
With this small victory he allowed himself another berry and chewed, utterly pleased as punch.
‘Albus…’ Lupin spoke hesitantly and turned his wide amber eyes to the Headmaster who’d stilled a little too. ‘…Moony.’
to look ugly – or worse –
The Aurors and their assistants were used to this now, gallows humour and grim smiles all round. The Potter being fairly well known just made those smiles a little more grim than usual – it was always easier to bury a complete stranger than someone who’s name your already heard.
‘I would. They are far more helpful.’ Harry’s leg was swinging as he ate more of Colther’s favourite fruit.
Snape’s face then twisted into a grimace when he recognised that
The snake reared its head and it huffed slightly. ‘How about,
‘And bloody freezing.’ Harry breathed, still watching the massive creature stomp through the trees far ahead them.

‘You ‘got rid’ of him?’ Severus probed.
‘I should think so.’ Albus nodded as he moved to open a trunk, and then a wardrobe and set of drawers. ‘Your magic is a little different, but not so much so that you cannot cast illusions if you wish.’
The last sight Draco caught of him was pale limbs wrapped in red wool become swallowed but the trees on that far side of the enclosure. He grabbed the feather and ran back to his dorms.
‘Severus was given that mark by a man who is now an enemy to him.’ Albus explained as Severus breaths came quicker.

‘We don’t know
But then the boys head turned as if he heard something and Harry had to duck back into the arc.
‘I am – fine. Hagrid healed it.’ Distracted, he rubbed a hand along the red fabrics on his side, dyed darker from the cut. The boy then looked around Albus. ‘Hello Hagrid – I – I have wanted to say that for a while now.’ He announced with an odd unaccented voice. It was monotonous and indicative of someone who hadn’t yet learned to connect speech with their feelings or thoughts.
this is amazing!’ Harry rushed, his voice still sounding largely unemotional and it contradicted the wide eyes and massive grin on his features. ‘How did you – can I? Can you teach me to-?’ The boy garbled as he spun and plucked at violets and lilacs.
‘Now, we are still not sure how your magic would translate a spell like this. What I’ve read about Wild Magic is that it can be controlled in a similar fashion to produce the same outcome. So, for the next few weeks we are going to get you accustomed to letting you magic flow through the beach wood branch, guided by an intention, then onto a target you will manipulate.’
‘I can’t do
The boy’s eyes lit with recognition before he pointed into the woods.
‘It won’t be necessary to go in all wands blazing. I know you and Remus feel differently.’
‘Nothing so simple.’ Albus finally settled on, too far gone to explain this experience, his typically extensive grasp of words and theorem were muted by it. ‘He isn’t merely searching for a translation, he’s reshuffling his mind to
‘Subtle my friend. Some might say you’re losing your touch.’ He grinned, his chest now tonnes lighter.
Whatever was hunting them was either stupid, careless or desperate to hunt this close to the forest edge. Hagrid suspected it was a nightmarish combination of all three.
So not a long time at all.

helped Harry hunt. A rabbit would have to walk into his mouth before he would attempt to bite it.
A few days later the young male was walking about, still limping, but stronger – the bone was bloody-well
‘Water. Juice from fruit. Sometimes with a little sap too in spring.’
With a small nod and a shaky exhale, Draco left the enclosure and walked slowly to his dorms once more.
And this was no different. He shadowed the beast and spied on him most days. Every time getting closer and, on a few occasions, nearly getting caught.
With another audible
Stickes rubbed his hands against his face furiously as the Occulmensed memories leaked through the cracks.
Green, focused eyes locked with his. ‘Albus.’ The boy said before he turned. ‘Minerva.’ He stated to the abnormally shaken witch.
He strained.
So, it was safe to say Stickes was not in the best moods this evening.
– and that was putting it politely.
‘I can’t just let you-.’
one smelled bad. That one smelled like his own magic.
Just why? Merlin damn it man, you need to take care of that. That – I mean – there’s potions
‘Ah!’ Harry exclaimed when the moths suddenly burst towards him. His magic automatically lashed out and caught a few, killing them with a rot before the fell to the floor with a quiet
The weeks following that didn’t offer much more in the way of clues. No more tracks, though thankfully no more dead mares either. The beasts were more skittish than usual around Hagrid, though it was to be expected. Even with all that life growing deep in the forest, there was still a threat in the air.
One morning Harry woke up to bleating Thestral colts and winged, beaked foals he had no name for after a night of battering winds. This time the hooved beasts were young and clearly lost; they had meandered up to Harry’s hut calling out to their mother’s.
‘Albus.’ He said as he pointed at his own chest. ‘Albus.’ He repeated himself after he’d taken the boys hand and directed towards his chest.
‘I can’t be sure.’ Colther grumbled. ‘All we know is that he’s a friend of the Forest, even though he’s aligned with the others the Forest doesn’t permit. But that doesn’t mean he is
‘What did you drink in the forest?’ Severus asked levelly.
Albus and Snape busied themselves with testing and running spells over the new salves and the woven wood fence. Their expressions were equally amused and fascinated, despite Severus’ attempts to seem disinterested.
Draco watched him pounce after it, each time he went to grab the bar of soap, it slid between his palms.
The creature seemed particularly focused on a white marking on the tree next to where Harry was perched. It stared for a while before something on the ground caught its eye again. Harry realised with a start it was looking at his footprints.
His mind now reeled through all of the precautions he should have taken. With each ‘what if’ the notion that he had aided and abetted the child’s death grew and twisted within him.
Now Hagrid was cursing large frame and wheezing through a brisk jog. He’d had to shove off his fur robe in favour of lightening the load on his poor knees.
‘It was too long ago for you to remember it.’ Albus tried to comfort the confused child. ‘And you have been lost for such a long time, Harry.’ Albus let out a ragged breath, memories crashing within him. He had to tap down the urge to embrace the child, lest he spook the flighty boy.
‘Oh, shut up and find me some lavender.’ Harry snipped.
‘Keep it in your sights.’ Harry whispered to himself as he tracked its frenzied movement between the trees.
Harry fled like the wind through treetops.
‘What were they called?’ Harry asked, and a sadness had crept into the tone. It broke Albus’ heart that that it was the first emotion he had voiced.
Draco raised his nose like his Father did when he wanted to assert himself.
Wizards.
‘What did you eat in the Forest?’ Severus questioned, talking over a confused Minerva.
The boy ran his hand over the cut instead of looking at it, still obviously too wary too look away from them, and he winced at what his fingers could feel. Hagrid then spied strange black markings on the boy’s skin, which seemed to
‘Get it for me, will you?’
For in storm and struggle I lived,
The boy reached out and touched his hand that was gripping the wooden bar of his bed.
‘Yes.’ Lupin cleared his throat. ‘Alright.’
‘Will Lupin assist?’ Severus asked with a sigh, resigning himself to a long trek in the woods.
Looking around again, he sighed. Nothing there – nothing unfriendly at least. He snorted –
‘Any idea as to what might be causing this Rubeus?’ Albus asked whilst staring at the flowers he’d just picked up.
The boy howled softly.
‘Oh, how
The forest opened behind the creature, ivy vine snagging its feet and it tumbled back with a guttural yelp. It landed on all fours, which Harry could admire.
Harry returned that night with his stinking pulps and doused fabrics. He worked until the sun came up and there was sweat in Harry’s eyes. Harry had rubbed the pastes deep into the wounds and winced at the noises they made when he had to be a little more heavy-handed.
‘Watch it.’ Harry murmured. ‘Or we’ll both end up with sore legs – what use would we be then?’ He said gently.
‘Of course you’d say that, you mad bastard.’ Harry shook his head as he donned a woven basket, tying it around his waist before stuffing some arrows into the back of his robes.
‘Yes. My father and I enjoy it on occasion. It’s where you search for prey –
‘You’re okay lad. It’s all okay.’ He repeated.
Without knocking, he entered before quietly closing the door behind him.
‘We can ‘elp yeh'.’ Hagrid nodded to his side again, trying rip his eyes away from the swirling marks. ‘After we've said our sorry’s first, of course.’
The question was another stone dropping in Albus’ gut, and he struggled to not show it.
The Forest was an unforgiving place to dwell, and Harry had lived and breathed it since he was a babe. He knew what cruelty was, he’d seen other creatures tear each other apart limb from limb. He’d seen babes eaten, the sick discarded, and the old picked off.
Harry bolted, grabbing tree branch after tree branch with a swiftness that blurred him. He yelped when more flashes of colour tried to touch him, when he lost his footing and nearly fell, when the branches nicked his soft skin as he stumbled.
The hairy creature seemed to be a guardian of sorts; it looked after the beasts at the edge of the Forest and the treeless fields beyond its edge.
Embarrassed, Draco buried his head into the crook of his elbow. He listened to the splash and wade of the water. Despite himself, he looked up to see the boy sniff at the bar of yellow soap hesitantly before sneezing and the soap slipping from his wet hands.
Harry’s power did not feel like that, his was like a living nightmare. He felt the keen differences at they clashed. Harry’s power destroyed; it ate at everything until nothing but the husk was left. The creatures power instead
’ Severus asked incredulously as he picked twigs out of his hair, spluttering as if she’d gone mad – or he had already. ‘Minnie, the boy is a bloody
Harry then nodded as he agreed with the entire concept of a bed – mattress, duvet, pillows, sheets, and all.
Minerva then threw her hands up in exasperation, knowing that Albus had already made his decision. And despite himself, Snape was somewhat excited – if only for the new and strange potion ingredients.
Harry rose a brow, but then nodded at the snake slowly. He didn’t let on
'I don't...just a feeling. The hissing was -
Peering into the darkest part of the space, Harry realised that it went on. Then, on one hand he was happy that he had a path to follow, on the other, he wasn’t too keen on sinking into that dark, foreboding space.
Those damned fools! Albus saw red.
And a babe, small and staring right at Stickes was sat in a soiled crib.
The boy’s eyes shifted behind Hagrid and his brow furrowed.
Albus further back, behind his desk, to where the large staircases were joined. With a touch of his palm to a wooden panel, the wood slots shifted, sharply separating.
‘We would prefer it if you came with us.’ Minerva stated gently. ‘The castle is safer than the Forest.’ She then titled her head. ‘If you like it, you could stay with us there.’
confused.
‘And you say that the area houses non-magical creatures?’ He probed levelly before politely turning down Hagrid’s offer of an aptly named rock cake. Hagrid set down a mug -nay- bucket of tea before sitting hurriedly like a child would if told there was chocolate cake ready for them.
The child flinched and then he was met with a tidal wave of malevolent magic, black and sticky. The shield barely held.
He kept close to the thicker trees, which bowed and shifted to keep him in shadow.
with them. The smell was understandably ripe, but when Harry crept about the space, he felt that strange edge of warmth and comfort again.
Harry removed the shiv hidden in his skin between his shoulder blades as he held the readied bow and arrow in the other. The wet sound of the buried shiv breaking flesh cracked through the stillness. It didn’t hurt anymore; the forest had shown him how to protect himself.
‘And if he’s innocent?’ Stickes needled sharply. ‘You gonnae’ live with that?’
Severus intoned dangerously to now deaf ears.
‘I…’ Harry bit his lip. ‘Are you my family?’
He continued slowly as he neared the boy and the razor-sharp vines rooted around him.
It was too much for Stone. He could only shake his head and back away from Stickes like the man sickened him.
The creature snapped some of the vines, but Harry kept hurling more forward. It’s grunts and growls increased sharply when Harry pushed it back, the vine never relented because Harry didn’t. They all reached out to the creature like clawed hands seeking to maim and poison.
‘Quite right you are Hagrid.’ With a quelling gesture, Dumbledore pushed the others to pocket their wands as he popped his down his sleeve.

For a long time after Draco stood there, vexed and hesitant.
of the items crashing nearly shook the room.
‘Oh, great. I got worried there for a second.’
Then a moments stillness as the creature looked down, vexed at the pain in its chest.
‘Don’t listen to that mean old bat.’ She said to the young lad whilst the boy was playing with a ball of yarn from her pocket, pinching his cheeks lightly. ‘He has no sense, it’s all those potion fumes I tell you.’ She said before totaling a pointed glare over her shoulder at a now purple Potions Master.
After climbing down, slowly, the corridor started to brighten again. Moving around another corridor then revealed an arced, wooden door covered with moths. At either side of the door were other paths. Peering down them both, he noticed that neither of them were lit.
Jonah laughed humourlessly. ‘The stars tell you that?’ He cradled the infant to his chest a little tighter.
Harry ignored him for another prized he’d found on the way up. ‘Oh, cloudberries!’ He grabbed at the yellowy-orange fruit but frowned when he saw how little space he had left in the bowl. If he stretched the stone any further, it would crack.
Hagrid found himself still searching for the small creature he’d thought might be at the centre of all the impossible oddness - and it wasn’t terribly long before more evidence of it sprang up.
‘She was.’ Snape said, though it did not seem he was aware he’d spoken.
The Headmaster hummed as if he was humouring the Potions Master.
‘It’s human.’ He announced gravelly.
With his heart in his mouth, Harry backed behind the wooden door a little more before sitting on the dusty floor.
‘How could they- I mean you of all people too. Fucking cunts!’ Stone kicked a small table down the stairs, the crash sounds as if in slow motion to Stickes sluggish sentences.
‘Yep. Eighteen months to be exact.’ Cross confirmed with practiced stoicism.
tried?’ The snake hissed back.
And it was a horror scene, like the kind Stickes used to watch with his Muggle brother.
‘-I know what hunting is, you fool! I am asking what it is exactly that you wish to hunt, insipid boy!’
‘Mon you wee rascal. Up we go.’ Stickes grabbed the infant from his parents in a swoop, trying his best to smile back at the wee one.
below us.’
‘I would invite you to discuss this matter with Albus, I don’t think it’s my place to tell you.’ Lupin gave Harry another downturned smile.
After some staring and a few nervous glances at his colleagues, the boy whisked the vines away. For a moment Hagrid was stunned when the blackened roots burrowed back into the earth.
‘Terribly so.’ Albus agreed. ‘I am not envious of your situation, Harry. There will be a lot to earn, most of it basic.’ Albus nodded to himself.
As Hagrid started to enthusiastically explain Hogwarts to Harry, who was straining to understand his accent, Dumbledore, Lupin, and Snape walked behind them.
‘Yes.’ Albus said to himself as the treeline broke onto the Hogwarts grounds. ‘What a joy indeed.’ He grinned.
Bury me with clenched hands
The boy tilted his head in the shadows, his eyes narrowing at Hagrid’s approaching feet.
But after many, many hours searching over the last fortnight – Hagrid hadn’t find a bloody thing except these little prints scattered everywhere. They were human, but smaller than he’d expected. The footfalls didn’t match the size of the bite marks on the mare’s neck. Well-unless the beastie had and oversized mouth or thumpin’ great hands. The tracks always went cold after thirty paces or so, like the being simply stopped, stood, and then

who could have done him serious injury. Not that Draco was inclined to admit this to anyone except Severus; to others Draco was a picture of cool calm and surefootedness, even in the direst circumstances – as all Malfoy’s should be.
‘But, you…changed it? All of it.’ Harry tried to explain.
‘Here, here.’ Stickes agreed, feeling that everything around him had finally cracked and the coo-coo’s were out the nest today.
him.’ Albus heard Lupin breathe behind them.
Albus couldn’t seem to take his eyes off of the bite marks, when he did it was with a snap.
‘Is it Harry?’ His voice carried, which seemed to still the giggling across from them.
Harry grinned. He felt wonderful. He could hear the wolves jeers from the treeline, the growls took on a mocking sing-song quality.
Little Andrew rolling in his own cot overlaid the scene in front of him, and his heart was breaking.
‘He’s learning.’ Albus offered with bubbling laughter. The sensation roving through his mind almost felt ticklish. He could feel the force of the transaction rove through the air in the small space between them, building and building with enough energy to fuel the Hogwarts Express for several journeys.
Severus’ expression turned dark and made as if to start shouting at him before he took in Draco’s slumped shoulder and furrowed brow.
Even Aragog respected the man and called him ‘Hagrid’ in their strange clicking language. The spiders weren’t allowed to touch Hagrid, who Aragog had named

Harry smiled at the scene and inched forward, unbidden.

‘Violence is forbidden otherwise. Especially among children.’ Lupin offered, his expression still stern and foreboding.
Then the quiet happiness he’d found all came to a stop when the ice-white creature saw him.
But this thing was not of the forest, and so it should
He slowly edged to his left, letting his magic swirl and swoop at his side; ready and waiting to lash out.
Then Harry perked up. ‘I mean…that’s not a terrible idea – might slim you down a bit?’ Harry nodded. ‘Might even be able to pull himself up a tree or two for once.’
It was one of the more hair-raising sights Draco had witnessed and it led him to the horrid thought that the boy might have been bitten on a full moon.
He had scouted out what he thought was the west-side of the castle, and after the majority of an hour, he was yet to map out all of it.
Harry could see the markings on his arms swirl nervously in jagged motions as he approached the bed. It was a far cry from the pile of blankets Harry was used to. With a tentative step, he edged onto the bed and let out a gasp for how much his body sunk into it.
Cross had continued to draw blood for the majority of two decades and genuinely still found it hilarious.
Albus simply shook he head with a tight smile.
spirit’ as Draco watched him tend to the sick and injured creatures with a calm ease that Draco thought he’d never achieve.
‘I will care for him until he can stand on his own two feet, as you humans put it.’ Firenze smiled, rocking the infant slightly. ‘Harry Potter will be a great man. One day you will realise you’ve done the right thing, do not feel as if you are abandoning him – that is if you choose to not forget.’
Colther hissed in annoyance, apparently sick of hearing about Harry’s rambling about Hagrid.
‘No, you’d think they’d all had a meeting about how to keep us busy. There’s far too much due around the same time.’
‘Woah.’ He breathed.
‘If yeh’ let me put some of this on, it migh’ sting a little less.’ Hagrid offered, not knowing if the boy could understand him or not.
‘No. Not that it is any of your concern.’ Snape went back to marking his papers. ‘You would do well to put it out of your mind.’
Hagrid then took in his features and his breath left him in a gasp. He
Running to the noise, Hagrid saw Malfoy on the floor pointing at the treetops.
It was all he could think about. The margins of his textbooks were filled with small doodles of hippogriffs and unicorns. He sketched out the boy’s figure, small on the page like it seemed from the distance Draco maintained from him. He’d try to imagine his face, what it must look like up close. But with each drawing he tried, he quickly scribbled out.
Harry just snorted.
‘The thing I saw was like me, I think.’
The boy was still roving their features his brow furrowed. Then, suddenly, he moved forward towards Albus, arm’s stretching towards his face slowly. His little hands stopped just before they would have settled on his head and hovered in a hesitant motion.
Something had been hunting the Unicorns, some of the carcasses he’d found not thirty paces from his cabin.
There was the boy he had seen in the Forest, the ice-pale creature that had screamed at the sight of Harry.
Harry stayed on his haunches as the ice-white creature lifted a long piece of shining wood – just like the creatures Harry fought before had done.
‘Harry?’ Albus tried after he’d knelt beside the child. He was answered with a confused, concentrated look his lips.
Big green eyes finally looked at him and his chest tightened enough to strangle.
‘Yes.’ Then it was Harry’s turn to hesitate. ‘I think so.’
Harry shook his head and stopped himself from thinking any further on it.
Albus considered the boy for a moment. In the corner of his eye he could see Remus wring his hands as Severus’ soft pants sounded behind him. Harry’s magic was unlike theirs, and that was putting it mildly. It was
as he cleaned out yet another greying wound and dodged another wayward hoof for his troubles.
Albus blinked then smiled softly up at the half-giant, once again thankful for his forthrightness.
With that, he sank back and pushed himself up to float on the waters tumbling surface.
He ran with the wind as his guide, billowing through the trees that shifted their branches from his path. And then heard the growls of wolves following him. He glanced back, the wolves keen eyes were sharp as they trailed his steps. They had heard the forest’s call and now flanked him, protecting him, guarding his path. His leapt over brook and bog, closely followed by the soft thumps of heavy paws.
Wizards and Witches caused him.
Albus.’
The Professor then walked over to the beach wood and hauled it out of the wall before casting a flurry of magic which repaired the wall quickly.
Harry bit his lip, somewhat shaken by the intense look the Professor levelled at him.
Harry fidgeted with a burst of nerves as the Headmaster regarded him.
Then the boy spoke.
Though, as Draco began to voice his grievances with Dumbledore’s lax duty of care policies and ask more targeted questions about what he might have seen in the Forest, Draco noticed that he was being pointedly
particular train of thought before it took root.
‘We don’t know. But – I mean if that was my kid…’ Cross trailed off.
‘I think he does Remus.’ Albus murmured. ‘Very much so.’ He confirmed without actually stating what they were all dancing around.
This? This was not typical
’ The snake huffed. ‘I’ll have loads of fun watching you track for
‘Severus, any news on the creature in the Forest? Has it been captured yet?’
?’ Stickes asked dumbly. He thought that this was cruelty, plain and simple. Accidental magic happened all the time, the fact that Cross hadn’t moved the kid now from his dead rotting parents spoke volumes and it made Stickes question the DMLE’s sanity putting him in charge.
He hadn’t been daring enough to leave the cover of the trees then. But now he had found the pale creature again, and with it, the scent of lemon soap.
‘There’sa change in th’ air, Albus! The belly of the woods are’na so dark anymore. Things are growin’! With hardly any light hittin’ the ground too, the floors bloomin’ all sorts. It’s like th’ place has great big lungs again, an’ it’s finally takin’ a breath. Here, look -.’
‘These will be your rooms for now Harry, just until we can get you something more suitable.’
which when he was three years old sounded more like
‘Care to elaborate on that survivor shite?’ Stickes asked with an edge to his voice that told Stone he was already done with Cross as he was.
‘Aye – saw a bunch of bleedin’ hens before I turned back.’ Hagrid chuckled, somewhat lightheaded.
‘But…’ Harry struggled to gather his thoughts. ‘Hagrid wouldn’t. He’d help.’ Harry tried, looking down at the colt imploringly.
Draco swallowed worriedly. He hadn’t been serious when he said he feared for his life after seeing the demon-spirit thingy, but if Severus was concerned…
Harry nodded with a frown. He then twisted his hand before clenching it, his magic spiralled towards the clay, a pot formed from it – though it was somewhat ugly in comparison to Lupin’s cups.
The Forest had seen this intruder and wanted it gone too.
‘Not willfully by any measure, if at all.’
‘They’re dead.’ Severus muttered after some minutes. ‘She’s dead.’ He added monotonously.
‘The black spirit demon thing, sir.’ Draco murmured quickly.
Stones had a family to return to, Stickes did not.
'And was it hurting the foal?' Albus probed a little more.
Hagrid shook his head and pointed to himself, his arms raised with palms facing the boy.
But that was so bloody hard right now.
Cross exhaled sharply, like an animal backed into a corner. ‘You don’t? Then you’ll be charged and let go.’ Cross threatened.
‘A place which is elegant in its simplicity.’ Albus beamed as he spelled teacups towards the rooms occupants who happily accepted them.
as he did so.
This time when he passed Severus’ quarters, the Potions Master was just exiting them.
Nodding to himself, he completely missed Nott, Crabbe and Goyle’s calls from the common room couches. Now in his dorm, he committed himself to a brilliant plan; wait until everyone was asleep, sneak out to the Forbidden Forest, hide out at the Hippogriff enclosure, and then confront the ugly, shy, dark spirit demon.
‘I’ve never seen balms like these before.’ Albus admitted. He and Severus then shared a look which said,
‘Lily and James Potter.’ It was Lupin who had spoken up then, his expression strong despite the shakiness of his arms. ‘They named you Harry James Potter – and they were the best people I’ve ever known Harry.’
‘Well - is it?’ Severus cut through the silence.
Harry snorted. ‘Is that his name?’
Harry now knew what a teacup was, which cracked the egg of there being more than one type of cup wide open.
Harry didn’t do this. But that not what the papers had written. No. The Ministry had killed an innocent child and were
‘It’s for your babes…and you.’ Harry smiled at the mare. ‘I’ve plenty back home. Might bring more if the hunt’s fair before the frost.’
‘Well, Harry. That was quite impressive. Though, I must apologise for what happened earlier – we are very sorry we startled you.’ Albus watched Harry, assessing if he had followed what he’d said.
The boys then seemed to descend into argue loudly among each other, some laughing, others clearly whining with exclamations of
Then he was surrounded by them and their strange weapons.
‘Probably. He is your kin, in a fashion.’ Colther turned South as if scenting them before he shook his head worriedly. ‘They don’t ever travel this deep. Often those who do are either lost or hiding and tend to be picked off quickly. Though it is curious why it was feeding on the pure beast.’ Colther inclined his head to the dead mare, its silver blood shining over its belly.
None of them answered, they all just stared, each with their own strange expression.
Then a rage Stickes hadn’t felt in year erupted. ‘You gone fuckin’ mad mate? He’s an infant!’ Stickes shook his head. ‘You’re talking about killing a child?’
One of the boys said. His name was Draco.
Obliviation never could mask something so awful. No, those kinds of memories stuck. He’d tried when Andrew died.
Jonah shifted. ‘You know what I’m here for then?’ He asked, the tremor in his voice felt like it moved the air around him.
The wolves growled at the snake, through it was more petty than hateful.
are dangerous.’
The grass around Harry began to shrivel and grey and an awful, sticky cold followed in its wake.
‘There’s sets of prints.’ Hagrid said as his mind was turning over what he’d learned these past months. ‘They’re difficult to track – might get abou’ forty paces before they simply stop, as if th’ thing making them disappeared.’
‘Easy, Albus.’ Hagrid said. ‘He’ll spook.’
Harry’s noise wrinkled. ‘I think it’s kinder that way. I don’t like the screaming.’ He shivered.
‘It’s a big change.’ Lupin said, startling Harry from his thoughts. ‘But we would like your journey into our world to be a smooth one. There are people who wouldn’t be very welcoming at all if they knew you were here. Though it’s no fault on your part, there is still a need to protect you from them.’
Lily said softly, sensing Albus’ sombre mood and fearing the worst.
With a stiff nod he made his way back to his home. To Harry’s new home.
It returned to a hut that looked like Harry’s. What stunned him was that Harry had found the Forest’s end – something he’d never even thought of before. There were no trees here. Just fields, a huge body of water and a massive stone structure, impossibly tall, straight and lit from within.
Stickes thought. I’m quitting after this, he promised himself.
‘Was.’ Albus nodded. ‘You have what we call Wild Magic – or Old Wild. It presents in a few people every so often. It’s terribly powerful, and thus can be difficult for young people to wield with any sort of success. Though, I suspect because of your upbringing, you are leaps and bounds beyond those who are more like you - and your peers who are less so.’
Harry thought to himself as he rubbed the colts flank.
‘…Harry?’ Minerva echoed before searching the boy’s face, her eyebrows shooting up. ‘The Potter boy?’
, the Headmaster has asked me to inform you of a few rules that you will put into practice as I tutor you Harry.’
that he made the short, quick climb.
‘That’s what I’m afraid of.’ Harry murmured as a sweet, milky brew was passed to him by Remus who had fixed him a cup.
Harry took the shiv in his hand and threw it through the gap in his vines and with a sickening
‘Just finish it the night you get it, then you don’t need to worry.’
The boy would arrive to find a steaming bucket of water, soft cloth, and lemon soap ready for him. After hearing the boy’s stomach rumble one night, he’d taken it upon himself to leave a small offering of food in muslin and wax paper. The boys shivered after washing, so Draco had brought wool blankets dyed in the same red the boy seemed to favour.
The other’s wounds were knitting up too at an eye-watering pace. Hagrid stood among the herd wringing his hands before checking over the Unicorns again – noticeably less flighty, like something had calmed them and let them trust again.
Flashes of books, newspaper stories, and letters – visions of whispers, jokes, endearments, and arguments.
The Headmaster had his suspicions where Quirell was concerned, it might have been cruel, but he was not overtly concerned over the mans fate. Albus frowned before he tapped the crystal vials filled with dull orange, green and purple specks with a warm smile.
Harry took it and pushed back his sleeve. The boy stared at the Dark Mark as it was revealed, the symbol was greying, but still swallowed all the light around it.
‘No – he knows the ques though.’ Remus said as he stared at the boy laughing as Hagrid tickled under his chin. ‘He looks just like James.’ He said suddenly, as if the thought rushed through him.
Now intrigued, Draco made his way over to the brewing area, a space which he was typically forbidden to enter. Snape simply looked too far gone to notice Draco at that moment in time, so like any good Slytherin, Draco took advantage of Severus’ wayward attention. Attention that should have been laid upon Draco.
Harry shifted his weight forward a bit to get a better look of it; this one didn’t have anything covering its face. And he was stunned to see it looked somewhat like him – except its skin was all pale and blank. It didn’t have the face markings like Harry’s – which right now had moved to form a straight band across his eyes, pitch and inky from ear to ear.
‘It’s always a pleasure to see you work so efficiently.’ Colther praised.
‘It is an illusion.’ Albus offered. ‘Rooms without windows can feel a little constraining and oppressive, I’ve found.’
‘The castle is pleasant at night, but in daylight it’s truly stunning.’ Albus said merrily as Harry gaped at moving portrait that waved at him.
Albus didn’t speak at first, he merely nodded and downed the contents of his glass.
Sang the enraged maternal whisper, the gale blustered around Harry, charged and malevolent.
Yes. Dust. You have dust on your shoulder, my good friend. Ha-ha-ha…ha.’ He audibly swallowed. Draco made a point of brushing Severus’ shoulder. However, when he did so, he jostled Severus’ hair, which donned his shoulders with more
Plus, right now he’d rather take his chances than kill the boy.
He stopped when he reminded himself forcefully that Hagrid didn’t
After worrying his lip, Draco spelled the soap to collide with the cloth rag he’d conjured before making them rub to create a thick lather.
Draco could only shake his head, the words he might have spoken clogged in his throat.
‘No-come on man, don’t-
It was quick: the boy grabbed the bowl, snatched the rest of the red cloth, and then disappeared into the shadowy trees on the far side of the enclosure.
He stood in front of Severus’ chambers and sighed, the air in his throat felt too dry.
So, it wasn’t a surprise that the Potter’s had decomposed slightly before they were found by a concerned neighbour; Bathilda Bagshot funnily enough. And despite the old woman’s trauma in lieu of discovering two dead bodies, rotting and putrid, she was cognisant enough to sign an autograph or two when asked.
‘But the ghoul might not-.’ Jonah was interrupted by a shake of the centaur’s head.
The boy stared on as if he’d just witnessed a miracle. He approached the rag cautiously, poking at it, sniffing it. Draco sighed and spelled the soaped rag to rub at the boy now who yelped. Then, when the boy saw that the rag was getting rid of the dirt and sludge, he let out a pleased hum.
‘Would he look after me like that too?’ Harry asked himself as he lay in the nest of blankets in his home. ‘…I’d hope so.’ Harry whispered.
Hagrid then held his hands out in a welcoming gesture towards the boy, his smile never wavering.
Harry let out a sigh of relief when the strange markings on the front of the book made sense to him.
He asked himself as he winced as at the guttural moan one of the colts sounded.
Colther looked at Harry archly. ‘One day you’re going to have to learn how to cut them down.’
Dumbledore stared at Harry a little longer before turning to the massive wall clock to the right and shook his head slowly.
‘I saw you. Not the infant.’ He explained, which made everything clear as much – as per usual.
The sobs in his chest bubbled up. Then he knew he couldn’t do it.
His lazy thoughts reared as he shook off most of the water before wrapping the reddish cloth.
After carefully stashing the pulp away and hiding its smell with a wave of his hand – Harry  made his way to the stream very, very quickly.
So, Draco had gleaned that the spirit often visited the Hippogriffs behind Hagrid’s hut. It was meant to return tonight…it was probably nocturnal now that Draco thought about it. Or maybe it was frightful to look at and embarrassed by it. Draco had never had an issue with how he looked, but he could imagine that it would be
Harry thought.
With tentative steps Harry followed the curve of the corridor until his foot met air again and his heart lurched. Feeling at the ground, Harry’s hand found a platform below him, and then another which revealed a set of stairs.
‘That is brilliant Harry. Really! Almost all magical children struggle with transfiguration, never mind attempting to accomplish it wandlessly!’
There were several audible intakes of breath around the pair, except who shakily exhaled.
Harry watched carefully as a pale hand reached to the shiv and then slowly pulled it out. The sound of metal scraping against bone and bloodied flesh was the
He soothed himself.
But even Professor Snape was starting to miff Draco off somewhat.
'Tha' wasn' there five years ago.'
Stickes had to cast a Bubble-head so last night’s indulgences wouldn’t come back to haunt him.
do, if you wish, we will discuss something akin to lessons and future plans in the morning. Though, perhaps after breakfast. I find myself a tad flummoxed without a good few pieces of toast in me, hm?’
The three watched Minerva translate Hagrid's enthusiastic detailing of the Hogwarts Greenhouses before the boy touched Hagrid's temple. Harry now spoke a strange mix of Dumbledore's polite tone and Hagrids rowdy bubbling.
‘What?’ Stickes was almost tempted to laugh it off.
Draco curled into the armchair further, hugging himself as his conscience berated him.
Harry was on his haunches again. He motioned for Colther and the wolves to make themselves scarce. His eyes stared north-west, the sound of the footfalls were ridiculously loud. It was calling out to something, its voice high pitched and panicking.
Harry shook his head quickly, and then forced his weary legs to straighten out, and with a sharp nod he began the arduous task of rounding up the beasts.
The boy then smiled and flicked his wrist. Suddenly, thick vines crept from the ground, blackened and looming over them all.
And all the creatures in black were looking up at him. There were far too many to fight at once, Harry’s stomach dropped with the realisation.
And eyes open wide,
‘James…’ A now pale Lupin breathed.
and the
Now, Albus thought he had sent them to their deaths.
‘Feel that?’ Stone gaped slightly, staring at the house with renewed interest.
And small mercies that Cross enjoyed the sound of his own voice and authority so much that he jumped on the chance to lay it all out for them in a serious tone.
Its screeching was unlike any creature Harry had met before. It had a face, but its black cloth hid its feature in shadow.
Draco held a breath and a wince as the Potions Master
‘It may not welcome the intrusion – I mean we still don’t know what happened to that stuttering fool Quirrell.’ Snape tried, hope beyond hope.
It was the night he'd taken Malfoy and the Weasley boy into the woods for their detention. Hagrid had begged off bringing them with him, he'd told Albus he didn’t know what was out there still and it was dangerous - but the Headmaster had simply shaken his head preaching something about curfew and character building.
‘A…man. His – magic - like yours.’ Harry tried while pointing to the wand at Minerva’s hip. ‘He smelled bad and wore a hood.’ He looked back at Albus. ‘Got rid of him…and his friend. He was drinking the cursed blood, the Forest was cold.’
Albus stood and swiped everything off his desk, the
But then a slight movement caught his eye, and in the distance a herd of roe deer grazing in the summer heat. The nearest wolf turned to him, her tail wagging.
Harry had nabbed a strange bristle thing that the creature swept over the horses hides and hair with. He tried brushing his own arms and head, but it was rather painful and not as enjoyable at the mares made it seem.
‘He looks like Potter.’ Hagrid said, perturbed and quiet.
‘I might have.’ The snake replied snidely. ‘But none for you.’
He gestured Harry small chest.
Like a frightened animal, Draco’s head snapped to where he last saw the boy. In that space, there was a small bowl discarded, its contents spilled to the floor.
forty years old. He checked a recently fallen stump,
It spoke a tongue that Harry didn’t understand, but its body communicated enough; it was shocked, then enraged and murderous.
The air cooled, and the sun seemed to dip as if night had rolled in.
He leapt from Hagrid’s arms as approached a horrified Severus with a swiftness that seemed magical. It was starling to see Snape laugh uncontrollably
their next meal.
‘Good!’ Lupin beamed. ‘Well, that’s one less hurdle to worry about.’ He then stood again before pointing at one of the first pages, at a particular spell.
'Young? How so?' Albus smiled at the boy to put him at ease.
There it was.
Harry saw the creature, and it was
Draco nodded, knowing then he had already sussed out the situation out perfectly.
Except Professor Snape, of course. Draco’s Father wouldn’t socialise with any old riffraff.
With a sort of carelessness that was typically beneath him, Draco bolted into the Forest, the last of Summers balmy air making him run with a sweat.
Harry’s expression darkened.
‘I wish to join the hunt.’
What was even more exasperating was trying to get them back to the herd near the massive creature’s hut. Colther, being unusually helpful, recommended meat as a lure. Hence, Harry was then found carrying a deer carcass, followed by a screed of wobbly legged foals each trying to steal from him with fluttering wings and small nips. Harry smiled back at them after he warned them off. Covered with twigs, drying mud and now deer blood, Harry guided them through brook and glen until he arrived at the rickety enclosure.
‘Naw.’ Stickes Scottish accent shone through best when he was pissed. ‘You gonnae’ tell me why ‘am here at three in the fuckin’ mornin’ Davie. I took leave for a reason.’ He mumbled.
Cross’s use of
He was hunting, stalking. The wolves rumbling softly in anticipation.
Harry read aloud.
‘Oh shut it.’ Harry picked up the bowl of berries, flinging one to Colther’s waiting mouth.
Not bothering to grab anything from the hut, he clambered through the grass and over the incline. His legs were shaky from the amount of work he had to put in recently. Harry’s whole body had been wishing to rest for
He wished fervently for the courage to approach the boy, to stand up and call out a greeting, to introduce himself, to hear the boy speak, to learn the boy’s name, to know what his voice sounded like, what
Draco bit his lip, feeling somewhat guilty about keeping his secret.
Harry wondered if Hagrid might become his friend too. He hoped he would, even if his company with the spiders was questionable at best.
This informed Draco’s second serious question – why was Severus, his typically attentive friend of the family, snubbing him?
‘You have been spending too much time with the wolves.’ Colther said mournfully. ‘Savages – the lot of you.’ The pack just huffed at the snake, one of them purposefully stood on his tail.
He’d find this damn beast and put it out its misery.
he found an old marker. He looked up and saw no break in the trees, no sunlight could have chanced through here to help it grow.
do that Theo!’ He chuckled, to which the dark-haired boy next to him sneered.
He took a big dollop of it and tentatively reached out the boy’s side. The little one flinched slightly before stepping closer, giving Hagrid the go-ahead.
Harry pivoted then glared at the snake. ‘And where the hell were you?!’ Harry griped loudly.
Harry’s eye looked up and caught a flash of red and black, the elderberries were higher up this season. He groaned and placed the bowl down.
Then Harry heard a laugh and he stilled.
‘Neither’s Robards or the hoods. He started ranting about the kid being the next Dark Lord or some shite. Though, I can’t say I disagree with him.’
from the thing it kept tight in its right hand. It slashed, severed, and slit at Harry’s gnarled, blackened vines. Its breaths were laboured and wet sounding.
forest was dark and a thick layer of mist hid its floor. Stickes almost laughed at the fact the forest had changed so little, and yet his life had turned upside down.
And then once, on the last day. The boy had sat down, right next to where Draco normally hid himself. He was just a metre away. So close, and yet further than Draco could reach out to touch. Draco had never held himself so still, never forced his lungs to function on so little air before. He’d never felt his heart roar in his ears like it did then.
Although, other things that only confused him and thrilled him in equal measure.
‘The mix is like nothing I’ve come across before.’ Severus admitted. ‘It has no real equivalent.’
Among the flowers and a bleedin’
‘Impossible.’ Snape had breathed as he eyed the orange and green flakes.
, I suggest you hop to it. Have a good day.’ And like the spineless coward he was, Cross high tailed it out of there. Everyone on the bottom floors was whisked away, leaving the Auror partners alone in the too quiet hallway.
Draco’s lips sparked a grin at the sound.
He still watched it closely, transfixed. The huge beast made an insane amount of noise as it walked around the space. Harry’s chest loosened a little when the creature had bent down to pick up a wayward chicken and stroked its feathers.
As the boy touched a bloody hand to Hagrid’s cheek, he heard a gasp behind him.
Not even Harry could get away with making that much noise without attracting unwanted attention.
Harry held up one of Lupin’s cups questioningly.
It was terrified of Harry. It was trying to protect itself.
With a grin on his face, Harry heard the rest of the boys leave, all of them shuffling out and shouting something about
The forest was howling in agony that one of her beloved children had died such a painful death for this thing that loomed before him. Harry’s inside curdled with the sensations of the forest’s tears and he flipped the shiv in his hand, fidgeting against her weeping.
Hagrid carefully took out some healing balm Poppy had gifted them all for this trip. The boy tracked his movements as Hagrid kept pointing to the wound.
Swallowing audibly, Draco took the ill-advised steps forward towards, then into the pithy forest.
He continued whilst staring down at Harry.
When Stickes arrived on the scene, he was more than a little hungover and bleary eyed. Yesterday he had buried a friend of his, one he hadn’t spoke to in some years and who had brutally murdered. But not by Death Eaters, which Stickes may have found some solace in. No, poor Jim had been beaten to death by the regular sort of murderer; a gambling game gone wrong where Jim had won the money and his soon to be killer hadn’t.
I’ll get you your damned wood, you moronic boy.’ The snake went to fetch it in a huff.
The forest helped where she could. Two winters past he’d probably have died from hunger had she not led the odd unsuspecting squirrel and rabbit his way. But still, he’d been miserable and had lost too much weight. It took an age to harden his body after that winter, so he’d stayed hungry for longer. And in this place, he couldn’t afford such a weakness, not with the other predators all too happy to make
The boy was there again. At the sight of him, Draco grinned and let a gasped silent laugh escape him.
is the one who made those salves?’
‘Fruit? In the Forest?’ Minerva questioned.
‘Who’s the Secret Keeper?’ Stone queried.
Draco had also never witnessed something so tender or that have ever looked as lonely as the boy below him did. The sight caused Draco’s chest to unfurl itself, making room for a blooming swell of warmth.
Stickes took a breath. ‘Avade Ke-.’ Then the boy moved, he flinched at the green light. Then he was reaching out between the bars of his cot in a panic. Moving and straining his little limbs in order to touch his mother and father. The boy grunted softly, trying to reach them and missing his mothers head by mere millimetres.
‘I can’t. I’d ruin them if I tried.’ Harry answered as he clambered up the trunk.
In the bottom drawer, he found a couple packets of unopened lemon soap. Harry bit his lip before he took one, hoping the boy wouldn’t be too distraught having one go missing. After a little more rummaging, Harry happened on a folded piece of wax paper, within it was one of the feathers he normal wore in his hair. With a small sniff, Harry realised it
He moved in a blur and brought the shiv down. But nothing connected.
now, and the sun wasn’t even at its highest.
‘There’s so much.’ Harry said quietly. ‘It’s not like learning from the Forest.’
‘We have met before.’ Albus charged on, the last of his doubt had left him when he’d felt the touch of Harry’s mind on his. ‘The last time I saw you, you were a babe, sleeping in your mother’s arms.’
It turned Harry’s blood cold.
Cross nodded slowly then looked over his shoulder. ‘You should come see – makes more sense once you do.’
Harry beamed and then plucked a few from his dreads, and a few of the blue beads he’d made for good measure. He placed them in the paper, gently folded it before returning it.
With one last look south – where he’d banished the creature far beyond the Forest’s trees. It seemed
The snake shook its head and blinked slowly. ‘The forest does not take kindly to their trespass – they are quite dangerous.’ The snake said carefully. ‘You’re the only one she has gifted shelter to.’
‘Here, wee man.’ Stickes approached slowly with a soft voice. ‘You want your mummy and daddy?’ He cooed shakily, tears running tracks down his cheeks.
‘We will find out…then we will thank who we have to thank.’ Albus stated genially.
‘But Severus, I was nearly
The boy then took a tentative step closer to Hagrid as he stood up from a crouch. Hagrid nearly grimaced when he saw how deep the cut actually was from this angle. He made a beckoning motion with his arms and the boy continued the few paces between then tentatively. The boy hissed as he walked, the cut obviously nipping him.
Colther then blocked Harry’s path. ‘They are of your kind, but so not mistake them for your kin. Magic folk are nasty business. You’d both do well to avoid them.’
‘Colther?’ Harry called out again, but quieter this time. ‘You done a runner?’
With a look of sheer exasperation, Severus all but threw his arm at the child.
soft. Not like an adults voice.' Malfoy mumbled. ‘It’s was much shorter that the mare, about heights with its chest.’
How can you expect me to sleep, to walk freely without watching my back, to eat without a stomach upset knowing that thing is still out there terrorising the good people of Hogwarts!’
magic – the kind he’d felt in spits and spots over his years as a friend of the forest. And the earth was soaked with it here, where all this life brimmed around Hagrid like a strange out-of-place sanctuary.
‘Enough of that from you!’ She chided, though still laughing at the boy’s frenzied curiosity.
‘I know.’ Firenze offered gently. ‘Tonight was trying for you, you made the right decision.’
The scratches and gouges looked to have been caused by falling branches and a few falls during the night. Harry pinched his bridge and promised to reinforce the hairy creature’s fence after he returned the foals – he was not interested in a repeat performance.
It continued calling, and nothing answered back. Harry’s curiosity damned him when he leaned too far forward. The branch snapped under his foot and the creature’s eyes snapped to Harry in turned. Then that awfully bright dancing light shot towards him again. Harry feinted, then dropped to the ground.
in Albus’ eyes that spoke of steely determination and being hopelessly beyond sensible suggestion.
To their right, a large clock chimed. Harry swayed on his feet slightly and his eyes felt very heavy.
‘Keeping a safe distance, lest you’d trip up over my
‘Can you understand us?’ Albus asked quietly in the space between them as the boy returned to his exploration of Albus’ beard and long grey hair. When the boy didn’t reply or react to Albus’ question, they all had their answer.
‘Hard not to.’ He answered. The outside of the cottage looked innocent enough. But, the magic in the air was thick and curdling. Stickes feel something akin to bone scraping against bone as he approached and entered through the front door. Either that or he needed to visit the dentist.
It was magic that should have been beyond his age and stage, but neither of his parents had been a stickler for Ministry rules when it came to underage magic. Thus, Draco knew far more about specific pieces of magic – namely those that would impress the guest at the gala his parents threw.
Draco could have whooped as he ran from the exit, through the grassy banks of the Hogwarts grounds until he neared the shadowy edge of the Forbidden Forest.
‘Good question.’ Cross backed them all out of the room but didn’t pocket his wand. ‘Robards has already authorised drastic measures. Kid’s got a core that could take this small town with it if he has a proper tantrum.’
It happened after Potions class too, only this time Draco was sure he was being wilfully ignored for nefarious reasons.
‘Ah, Stickes and Stone – my favourite dynamic duo, beautiful mornin’ eh?’ Cross beamed like a fucking spotlight.
After describing what he had seen, Hagrid guided Snape into the heart of the Forest just before term started. Snape simply stood and stared like Hagrid had when he’d first found the place. It had been the first time Hagrid had seen the poor bloke shaken.
‘Have you ever done anything like that with your magic?’
Harry grinned to himself.
‘Not his eyes though.’ Severus murmured, Albus found he was gazing at the boy too.
Minnie.’
Then a twig snapped behind them and the boy stilled a little, his attention returned to the other three Wizard’s behind them, the strange marks flooding his eye’s in a band from ear to ear.
‘Put those effin’ things down!’ He shouted out as he eyed the gash on the boy’s side and the wicked sharp wooden spikes that surrounded him. The spikes moved in a circle around him and the thicket, quivering as if ready to strike at any moment. ‘He’s hurt, you bleedin’ dolts!’

‘It was a hard essay!’ Theo defended.
You should know that! Ugh, it’s on my
Albus nodded to himself before turning to Hagrid, Minerva, and Snape. ‘Strange. I don’t think it’s malevolent, but I think it needs to be found.’ He announced. ‘It may be one of us.’
It was akin to a Muggle piggy bank being tipped over; the boy was rummaging through his mind for valuable things that lay within it. Once he got over the shock of it, Albus thought the child might be looking through his memories. He was, in a sense – but the searching was disjointed, flighty, with nothing to connect the frog jumps the boy made between flashes of Albus’ recollections.
‘You mean if we don’t. And it’s not a bloody thing Chris! It’s a fucking child!’ Stickes spat, his hate for the man now reaching a whole new, dizzying level.
The two ragged Aurors made their way into the cottage. Once they passed the muggle-repelling charms, both of them soon woke up properly. Their wands were instinctively unholstered, though neither were raised – two decades on the job meant protocol and crime scene safety were instinctive too at the point.
With a huff, he placed his hand against the wall and moved forward, letting his magic spread out into the space before him.
Harry rounded on Colther quickly as the snake exited a hollow stump, the dark energy with roaming in his arms and legs. ‘Do you know what that was?’
Everything jerked, mares and boys alike.
wide.
The first Unicorn he’d found, he’d been able to save. He had found it during one of his many trips to visit Aragog and his family. The Acromantula had complained then of a creature that did not belong, angering forest and harming her children. But there was a lot of that. Things hid in the forest for many reasons, none of them good.
Everything was filled to the brim with that strange dancing magic, so much so that it made his magic feel dull and joyless in comparison. Harry looked at his hands and frowned before Minerva pointed to things called
The female mare seemed to snort in agreement before huffing against another wave of discomfort. Harry got back to rubbing her neck and stomach, guiding the mixture and pushing at the knots in her stomach, just like the centaurs taught him…
As Dumbledore neared him, he noted a number of empty whiskey bottles and an acrid stench. Nodding a little, he Summoned his own tumbler and filled it.
This creature
‘Right you are Hagrid.’ Albus nodded before standing.
‘He suspects that it likes to help the mares. With so many still injured, it might return -perhaps as soon as tonight.’
Shaking the dark edge of his thoughts, Harry went through the motions with careful grace. Touching the hulking tree with his now cold hand, he let his senses roam through the roots of the surrounding woods. He lost himself in the hunt.
Typical for the Forbidden Forest.
He knew what it was, what it was called, but he had never experienced it before. Albus was
The stream never looked so attractive. The glistening water promised to be cool against his over-heated, sweating skin. Shaded by heavy trees and guarded by high boulders, Harry stripped off his threadbare cloths, their orange-red dye bright against the brown green of thirsty grass.
Its eyes widened at something and then it was staring with its mouth wide open. It touched the trees and then its gaping mouth quirked up and it made a pleased sound. Though, the thing was so hairy Harry could barely see its cheeks move.
But even that was nothing compared to the
it sunk into the panelled wall.
Smiling softly, Albus tried another tack.
‘Then why wont you let me lend my service to something as important as this, Severus?’ Draco griped at the door…quietly.
Lily’s voice caught.
Despite its size, the beast had a soft hand and made gentle sounds before he let the chicken on its way. The creature was careful, and he seemed to respect everything that surrounded him – he even look somewhat awed when he passed different plants and tree spores.
James offered calmly whilst rubbing Lily’s back.
The boy stared at Albus as he came to stand in front of Hagrid, his arms and legs tensed as if ready to run.
for there interception of a ‘dangerous, clearly unhinged child’.
It smelled of dust and musk. Looking around Harry took in his surroundings; a high bed of dark wood, floors of polished stone covered with red patterned carpets, pictures of people who were famous for their grand thoughts and opinions, and tall high windows. Harry stared at the windows for a few beats, his mind catching that there was something wrong with them.
‘Is that why we’re here? You want us to do your dirty work?’
Twenty years all for nothing. Twenty years and it all came to this.
Lifting a bow, Harry had an arrow aimed for its head and followed it as the creature walked, staring at the ground.
‘Albus, what – what do you want me to do?’ At Albus’ furrowed brow, Harry garbled an elaboration. ‘I mean – what should I do now I’m here and – when do you want me to go? And-.’
Harry’s eyes quickly shifted to the Unicorn and then back then he growled angrily when the creature still didn’t retreat.
When Harry returned them in the late evening, they were brought into a fold of adult mares in a flurry of grey feathers and black scaly skin. The winged beasts bowed to him before rubbing their cheeks against him, and the Thestral’s nipped his ears affectionately. He shushed their whines as he pushed a few wandering colts back into the fenced circle.
The report stated its own speculations; it suggested that James and Lily must have went into hiding sue to the nature of their sons magic.
‘Neither of us did.’ Stickes agreed, his hands now shaking. ‘We wouldn't be able to magic the memory away either…’
was never good.
‘Was?’ Harry swallowed.
And it wasn’t simply the age old ‘innocence of babes’ that fuelled that intuition, no – it was more of an educated guess afforded to him by his liaisons with the Potters.
As Draco hurried back to the castle, he tried to sort out the jumble his head had become. It was a mess of questions, of thoughts leaping in different directions, of worries and anxieties biting at him.
‘Aye, big fat ones – chicks too.’ Hagrid beamed.
‘Yes, but it was too heavy to carry.’ The snake grinned.
Hagrid passed him the slice of wood he’d cut. The headmaster took it calmly, with a furrowed brow, like it was a puzzle he’d never encountered before.
But Harry could understand the sentiment, he often harmed those that threatened him or the Forest. He would probably harm anything that tried to hurt Hagrid, the mares, even Colther.
Albus stood and walked over to Lily and the sleeping infant in her arms.
It had been too long since he’d last called on it, and it was thirsty.
And if the forest was angry at the first mauling, it was livid by the fourth and enraged at the fifth.
what had happened.
Firenze shook his head. ‘You don’t give yourself enough credit.’
The snake seemed to regard him for a moment before answering. ‘One of your kind. The beings beyond the forest.’
Then Albus couldn't help himself, he laughed wholly overjoyed.
‘Alright?’ Stickes partner, Stone asked.
There was just enough of a gap in the canopy above to let in a little sunlight today. He wished he could stay in the long grass and play. But he needed to pick the high berries and fruits creatures like Harry could reach.
After that, new life had clambered in the belly of the forest, constantly stretching outwards. The area which Hagrid had first visited was now impossibly larger, as was the life within it. Odd new plants sprung up, peculiar animals Hagrid had never seen nor heard of grazed and scuttered around him.
Harry had only seen his reflection in the ice of winters waterfall, or in the still surface of the sluice over west. But he knew that this thing was more like him than any other creature he’d encountered. Or perhaps the werewolves after the moon stopped bearing down on them, though even then he’d only caught glimpses of arms and blurred, scarred feet. Or the centaurs had they walked on two legs instead of four.
Hagrid then knelt down on the ground and then stooped some more so he was eye-to-eye with the child. He didn’t dare move his hands as the blackened vines reared at him minutely.
‘You did a good job. But you promised you’d leave them.’ He reminded Jonah softly.
‘I know you!’ Harry cooed at the foal who had followed him about when they healed the mares. ‘You’re pretty far from home…we’ll get you back, eh? We’ll need to.’ Harry said to himself as he sized up the small herd of foals and started to plan their capture. ‘The hairy creature might follow your trail up here.’ Harry said whilst looking pointedly at his hut.
body.’ Colther snapped back.
Harry had pushed the strange creatures from his Forest, he started seeing more of them.
‘What hurt them?’ Minerva asked softly whilst rubbing small circles in the boys back.
The boy changed from ‘
Albus nodded when the boy turned to him again. ‘Your magic is a little different to ours Harry – it always has been.’
He then pointed to the boy’s chest and the same fricative noises escaped his mouth followed by the child pointing at his own chest.
Then another creature so like the last came bounding through the undergrowth.
‘Oh, you don’t need to tell me. Just last week I saw you scribbling down a conclusion at midnight Theo. Midnight!’
Whilst looking after the mares, something had been looking after Harry. At first he thought it might have been Hagrid leaving a pail of water for the beasts, but knowing what he did now about magic, the soap and cloth had been charmed to create suds and wash him. Hagrid hadn’t smelled like the lemony soap at all, in fact, the half-giant tended to smell like hay and strong tea.
Harry walked back slowly once the creature entered his hut. That night he dreamed of giant creatures hugging massive stones and a Forest that was lit from within with thousands of yellowy stars.
Snape levelled another bizarre look at him. Perhaps the man was confused, and he’d never been hunting?
The shadows slid across Draco’s skin as he inched forward to get a better look. The tree that stood with him on the top of that small hill offered him a perch from which he could spy uninhibited.
Then Stickes hear the tell tale sounds of the Obliviator Squad from the floor below them. Stickes and Stone shared a knowing look and both men sneered at Cross.
Harry held up a hand, silencing the pack. Their tails stopped swaying, now tense.
Severus shook his head dumbly, now astonished rather than disbelieving.
The Potions Master let a highly unusual giggle escape. Mortified, he cleared his throat and schooled himself.
It was on the third visit to Severus’ quarters that he stumbled upon a seemingly tense conversation between his Professor and the Headmaster.
‘Second, is that although you do not need a wand, you do need to keep up appearances, for appearances sake.’
was he there at all? Like all simple questions, they have quite straightforward answers; Dumbledore is an incompetent fool who surrounds himself with even more inept minions.
‘…Your concern is noted, but I doubt it will bear fruit. If it does, I will listen to your grievances then. Now…’ Snape then gestured for Draco to leave.
It happened so fast that his screams were still echoing after the earth had consumed him.
Soundlessly he rushed forward, his feet barely touching the ground as eight pairs of eyes watched on hungrily.
At this the boy softly untangled himself from Minerva and approached a quickly paling Potions Professor.
Harry nodded slowly and he felt the surrounding stalks caress his arms as he pushed his weight forward. He brought the dark, rotting thing in his chest forward and it quivered in delight.
‘No hunting today?’ Colther did not sound disappointed.
Albus thought.
Standing up he went to shape a bowl out of the small boulder that sat outside the hut. He’d have to be quick; it never held its shape too long once he changed it.
The boy was so small, so thin and dirty as Stickes slowly raised a shaking wand. The boy wasn’t even looking at him. It was better that way, Stickes couldn’t bear to meet the boys eyes.
Severus shook his head before leaving Albus and the hearth, a few minutes later a door slammed shut.
He then smiled at the canopy and said a silent thanks to the Forest.
‘Colther?’ He called out. There was no reply.
‘Severus? I mean, there is no need to be embarrassed, it happens to the best of us…well maybe not me specifically because of those potions I was just telling you about. But as an infant I’m told I suffered a rather bad case of cradle cap-.’
Roots surrounded him, as if shielding him from the world around him.
when the boy suddenly clambered up his tall frame before perching on his shoulders. Hagrid tilted his head back and saw green eyes staring back at him with a blinding smile.
The babe wriggled in his arms, he was far too small.
Then the unmistakable sound of hooves on wet, damp earth sounded in front of him.
as a concerned peer.
‘A wizard?’ Albus probed.
‘Wouldn’t it be easier for me to just use my hands?’ Harry questioned.
Unconsciously he settled on the latter and sank onto his haunches. He held his head in his hands and stared through his fingers
‘People?’ Severus echoed. ‘I should think not. Why do you ask?’
Dumbledore couldn’t have foreseen this; he had thought them safe from the proverbial wolves at their door. But to discover the wolf had been among them this entire time was hard to swallow – and wholly unbelievable.
Albus then reached behind himself and then produced three vials. He took the boy’s hand softly and pour purple flakes from one of them into the child’s palm. He pointed again at the boy, this time his face set with an inquisitive stare.
No one knew what had happened to the Potter’s in the final days of that awful War. Then again, no one knew anything of much substance; everyone kept their secrets close. It was every man for himself and his own lot. Nobody was interested in looking out for their neighbour or even friends and family who were distant – both literally and figuratively. Families were often spilt in two, Light and Dark…the brave ones anyway. Others just hid to save their own hides, everyone else be damned - the smart ones.
People spoke their feelings; those emotions coloured their voices. But those sounds did not always match what was happening within them. They held secrets within them, so many false pieces to save themselves, to remain unburdened by not becoming a burden.
Albus made a quelling gesture as he walked over the where the boy was seated with Minerva. As if he could sense their discomfort, his eyes began flitting over them all nervously.
Lily sniffed.
He nearly broke one when he heard the creature return; Harry hightailed it out of there without letting it seeing him.
But it wasn’t to be.
‘Leave.’ Harry hissed warningly, circling the heaving form. ‘You do not belong.’ The screaming creature suddenly stilled – well – as much as it could when its body was slowly wasting away with putrid, deadened skin. Its face turned to him; it arms cradling itself.
When Draco heard the soft hissing and felt the cold shiver of the boy’s magic, he gasped quietly. The boy droned a low, almost melodic sibilant as he wrapped red dyed cloth around a Unicorn’s mangled leg. Having never seen that much blood and gore, young Draco swallowed against the bile that rose when he heard the pained whine of the mare the boy was treating. A colt dashed to the boy who then turned to hold the babes head in his hands before nuzzling with the same soft hisses sounding between them.
He beamed when he saw the deep blues and silver of both the feather and beads he’d gifted.
But then the thing
rang like a bell.
‘A friend?’ Harry asked the air quietly.
With a tentative inhale, the boy stilled then quickly backed away from Severus. The Potions Master was humiliated that his Mark was bared, but he did well to school his expression.
In Albus’ mind there were rules, opinions, conjecture, thought, feelings, society, environment, knowledge, skill, motivation, subtext, and cues that Harry couldn’t begin to understand.
Both men seemed to struggle with themselves. There was an impossible sentence on the tip of Albus’ tongue, the same one he suspected that Remus was currently struggling with.
Stickes then took a lock of the boys hair, only a little darker than his own son’s had been, placed it on a sooty pillow and then spelled a ghoul of the boy.
Pushing past a rather affronted Snape, Hagrid moved closer to the boy –
Lily’s eyes began to burn with determination. The love for her son was as fierce as it was unshakable. James took his wife’s hand, his support and protectiveness over his family was equally unwavering.
‘Here you go wee’an.’ He crouched down with the boy in tow. ‘Say bu-bye to mummy and daddy.’ The wee one reached down and put his hand on his mums face and then made a happy gurgling sound. Stickes put him on the ground and he watched to boy move and trip slight to his dad too, he touched his dad forehead with his and patted him a little strongly.
Covered in shadow, Harry could see the boys shake their heads and Draco stare at the spot Harry had just jerked back from. For a moment it looked like he was staring straight at Harry before he frowned, shook his head and then made to leave the bedroom.
He was sitting in a castle. Before today, he’s never known things could be built so high, so solidly, or could fit so much within. Harry’s eyes ached with all that he’d looked and stared at.
Harry wiped the back of his hand against his forehead, sweat was soaking his eyelashes and stung his eyes. Hunched over a deep stone bowl filled with pulp he’d ground down with his own fists, Harry found his arms and back aching. His throat was dry, and he was elbow deep in foul innards, ivy mush, and red spore from in-season stinkhorn fungus. He stared at the jug of water longingly as the mulch squished between his palms and fingers.
‘Ach.’ Jonah dismissed. ‘You know I can’t see past my own nose.’
‘What have we got here?’ Stickes huffed with a barely aborted eye roll.
Harry eyes widened to discover a portrait of centaurs galloping to war where the panel had once stood.
Harry felt a strange energy from the hooded being. A sound-like pressure
Albus gestured to the young boy, beckoning him over.
A few weeks ago, the Defence teacher, Professor Quirrell, had apparently went missing in the woods. Rumours swung from a nervous breakdown, to a mission to prove his tenacity in his chosen subject, to a left-field sabbatical in Romania once more after the Vampire who had accosted him had apologised over owl.
Draco had wanted to be brave then. He wanted to stand and move, to introduce himself, to have the boy introduce himself in turn. But he didn’t. Draco was caught between transfixion and anxiousness. His palms were slick at the thought of spooking the strange boy and never seeing him again.
‘Tha’ way’s th’ hut.’ Hagrid confirmed. ‘He’s the one.’ He said with a grin blooming on his features.
anything friendly.
‘And what does yours smell like?’
‘Ah, the mad flurry before the frost creeps up on us. Yes. As always. Might even be inclined to help – if it’s needed of course.’
Albus rose an amused brow then nodded with thoughtful glance at the moon.
Harry pointed to the wand Albus held. ‘Yours dances, it’s alive and colourful, full of life. Even the spells that smell more like mine are full of light.’
Harry believed the forest must have had a hiccup when he came to be. He was the only one - a mistake perhaps. A centaur with strange power and now hind legs. Even the rabid werewolves had brothers.
‘Brilliant. Well, good evening Harry – sweet dreams.’
He saw the distressed look on the large creature’s face and realised that he wanted to but couldn’t.
Stone froze his pacing when he realised Stickes was right. Neither of them could move. Neither of them wanted to. Now Stickes was cursing being too effective at his job – which he’d all bit married himself too once Laura left. Hence, the high number of dark wizard kills; it was cathartic in some sense.
Harry frowned before suddenly blurting: ‘Why?’
‘-homework yet?’
Harry felt the land settle when it was gone, and he let out a slow breath.
Now at eye level he could see the crust from spilled tears on the babes face, the dirt and soot covered the rest. There was no way this kid killed his parents, if he did it was an accident.
But the hairy creature never used his, even though Harry could smell it on him; a light musky scent that spoke of home, hearth and happiness. Instead he befriended the Forest’s children and nurtured them without hesitation.
Climbing back up to the arc, he looked to his left, down another very dark, dank corridor.
Stones went in first. ‘Merlin, why is the kid still here?!’ He shouted.
Harry stared at the canopy.
‘Fine. Maybe I should share these cloudberries with the wolves instead.’ Harry reached into the bowl and bit into one, holding Colther’s eyes the entire time.
He tried.
‘You better let us take a look at that cut yeh' got there.’ Hagrid gestured to his side which was now bleeding at a concerning rate. ‘We’ll ge’ yeh’ fixed up, yeah?’
He did not breathe as he watched the small creature pad towards the hippogriffs and unicorns. It was wide eyes that he took in how the sprit in front of him wasn’t a spirit at all, how instead it was a small boy, his age with red cloth wrapped around him and black marks all over his pale skin.
‘Could someone like me survive it?’
it.' The boy wrung his hands and eyed Hagrid's bow as if he should do something with it and preferably soon.
So Stickes had to do it.
world was much larger that Harry could have dreamed.
and then kill them too quickly.’
‘Have you
They did so, and after he considered them quietly with a soft tilt of the head, the surrender seemed to release a floodgate in the boy.
‘Good. I am most anxious to get to the bottom of
The boy’s brows creased with a faraway look before he brightened.
getting a little fat sitting on my shoulders all the time.’
a good morning.’ Stone answered, and thank god cause Stickes was far beyond pleasantries at the moment.
He ran, and then ran some more – always trying to dodge the dancing light.
Hagrid had crouched to inspect it, not believing his own eyes.
had but a moment’s notice, it barely turned before Harry brought the shiv down, its pale back was now gaping and bloody. The pain had it slumping forward, its flesh now beginning to become sickly. The blood which had been thick and clotted before was now a dark brown. Harry’s magic was seeping into the beast, its wound decaying like it was already dead.
‘So…here’s what we are going to do instead. I’m going to pretend I’ve done the deed and then you and me are going to visit some friends of mine. Their good people, you’ll like them.’
Hagrid wheezed when the boy somehow managed to flip Severus on his arse.
He looked at the apple trees, they must have been
Then he finally lost his footing completely in his panic, his mind unhelpfully adding that the blunder was unlike him, and that he knew the Forest well enough to do better.
Lily and James were dead. Their child was executed.
‘Oh.’ Harry swallowed around the knowledge. ‘Would you tell me about them then?’
Draco had told himself firmly.
‘Like you
There were rules in this place you had to follow. And draining the blood of pure creatures was laughing in the face of quite a few of them. Harry balked at the silvery liquid ran in small rivers from the Unicorn, it eyes dead and staring. The sucking and slurping cutting through the quiet of many horrified eyes watching.
And in struggle and storm I died.
He had quickly sought out his family friend, understandably still shaken over finding himself in close quarters with a
Jonah looked away and swallowed before biting his lip hard. ‘They were gonnae’ make me kill him.’
Remus Lupin was by all accounts, a rather strange man. Or at least, strange in the way that he regarded Harry. Lupin looked at Harry as if he knew him, as if he had already forged a close relationship with Harry that he’d forgotten about.
them even. In fact, it’s nothing shy of remarkable.’
He thanked the forest by returning what he didn’t need to its floor, innards, fruit skin, and bone. It helped the plants grow wild and fierce around the hut. But he knew he’d have to hunt soon; the sun was starting to cast longer shadows much earlier. Sometimes the pips grew, he had a few young apple trees beginning to sprout. But it still be some years before they bore any fruit.
‘I don’t – I haven’t.’ Harry seemed to struggle with himself.
‘You can see it?’ Albus asked Harry, but it sounded as if he was talking to himself more than Harry.
Harry yelped softly before he aimed arrow shot through the air at the creature with a
Hagrid slowly stood, as smoothly at his creaking knees would let him. Hagrid let out an
‘Yes, it would. Unfortunately, it might cause you a bit of bother if people were to see you cast wandlessly at your age. Which brings me to another rule Professor Dumbledore and I have discussed: you cannot let anyone see you until we know you can control the magic within you.’
He wasn’t a father yet, but Stickes had been and Stone had two young girls under his wing.
‘I’m not sure I’ll sleep well otherwise.’ Cross looked over his shoulder to where the pithy magic felt as if it could choke them. ‘I don’t know what that is, but it’s like no child I’ve ever seen – or adult. Inside and outside missions.’ Cross stared unseeingly.
of the odd beasts with their shiny pieces of wood. Hagrid was among them, pointing to deer carcasses and prints Harry had left before he’d tended to the sick mare.
‘The Dark Lord.’ Severus said faintly.
His eyes roved over the bed and the drawer beside it. With a small smile he carefully opened each drawer in turn, the first few held clothes, others had small knick-knacks and object Harry hadn’t a name for yet.
of him readying the bow sliced through the silence.
Stickes then grabbed a blanket from the linen cupboard at the foot of the bed, plus a few changes of clothes for him.
It was shouting, or that’s what it seemed like. The second creature wore far stranger cloths than the last one; a strange wrapping on its head – even though the sun was now high – and layers of thicker dark red wool, so long they brushed the ground at his feet.
‘What?’ Colther interrupted. ‘Slither around ‘till I’m dust, like you do? No, you me tired just watching you.’
‘Would you believe me if I told you they had?’ Firenze cocked his head.
Harry mumbled under his breath about
Harry was innocent. He knew this in his
Currently, he was balancing on a beam in a windy tower. Across from him, he could see another tower with a dark roof that seemed to hold hundreds of birds. He’d hidden away up here when he had saw a dark shape move among the birds from the tower window. His reflexes had him jumping and grabbing the beam before he could think much of it. Harry was glad that he had; the tower had then filled with a group of young girls a little older than he was. They were loud and now he was too cautious to move in case they, or any other student, saw him from the large arch ways they stood next to.
As if he could halt the boy’s lurch form the branch, Draco had held his arm out, his body moving forward unbidden.
‘…Always?’ The boy cottoned on quick, and Albus nearly grinned at his sharp senses.
‘Just go – Davie please? I’ll be out in a moment.’
‘Will I be able to do that?’ He asked.
Minerva practically squealed with tinkling laughter as the boy unraveled her hair – which was highly uncharacteristic of the stern Deputy Head. ‘You’re a breath of fresh air, aren’t ye?’ She cooed.
Harry, covered in dirt and dust them clambered through the hatch door before seating himself in chair opposite a wide eyed Dumbledore.
Albus moved swiftly forward with a spring in his step that belied his age. The two men behind him looked on worriedly.
He then rose to balance on his haunches and let his eyes roam. The air was shifting too quick and flurries for these parts.
There was blood in its lungs, and it was still fighting with a weapon that looked so much like Harry’s. Harry pulled at the bow, an arrow sank into its thigh.
Harry didn’t allow himself to be stunned. He simply followed. Raising his hands, he swept the decaying matter on the forest floor between them and shifted its form into pointed, creeping vines. The sharp ends were then sent out, flying forward with a twist of Harry’s wrist.
Not one for quiet, subtle games of self-preservation, Hagrid piped up rather loudly.
‘What I caught…Sometimes what the Forest gave me.’ Harry answered as he worried his lip.
’ between swats, Harry climbed, crawled and shuffled all around Snape and his robes. Albus was beside himself, clapping like a child would at the comical sight of Snape being inspected by the curious, clambering lad.
Stone held his hands up and shook his head. ‘Not my call, Chris’ running the show.’
Then the creature cast a strange smoke from the branch in his hand. Harry could sense the poison it had created, and he threw air at it with a dismissive gesture.
Severus then jumped out of his skin before thumping his elbow off the brewing table, scattering some flakes onto the table.
‘…I wondered if the people who go missing in there survive it.’ Draco said.
Unlike the rest of Hogwarts, the magic in this space felt unstable, like it hadn’t been touched in a long time. He followed what felt like a winding, ancient path full of rot and decay. The air was still and musky here and Harry thought he’d been the first to breathe it in a long time.
Before leaving, Harry thought what it might have been like to have had this. To have grown up around boys like Draco, with a family, and friends. It wasn’t until he’d for others like himself that he’s known how terribly lonely he was. How much he needed to speak to others like him, people who thought like him. A snake and a pack of wolves were poor replacements for what he’d found here. The animal’s lives were straightforward and small, and Harry felt like his life till now had been terribly small too.
The Forest always gave Harry a gentle sort of guidance and she’d softly pushed Harry to pursue the hairy creature, for Harry to help him where he could. And did so gladly because Hagrid was wholly worthy of it in a selfless sort of way.
Severus’ head snapped to him, and an awful cracked sneer inched up his features.
Hagrid’s mind turned over day and night. The prints were random at best, they didn’t seem to lead anywhere, they certainly didn’t point in any direction – which had caused the half-giant a tender scalp from all his scratching.
He had happened on the first when he was collecting feathers for his arrows and Harry had happened on an egg nest - the ground had suddenly started shaking.
‘Why did they pick us?’ He asked himself. ‘Why us?’
The male then nudged into the crook of Harry’s shoulder, and with a low crooning sound then went to tend to the foal Harry had fed. Harry felt a warmth in his chest at the sight. He felt like he’d finally got a little of the thing he wanted when he watched the hairy creature tend to the herd and the beasts in his hut.
Malfoy hesitated then shook his head. 'I don't know, all I see it do was rub the Unicorn’s neck.' And then he added after a pause. 'It seemed young. Like my age and size.'
‘I heard Tuscany is stunning this time of year.’ Firenz pushed. ‘Haven’t you always wanted to visit?’
Dumbledore also let himself be flummoxed for a few beats; the boy’s swift grasp of language and the knowledge he was unraveling made him feel off kilter. Albus looked around, apparently everyone else was feeling the same.
those green eyes and that wild hair.
‘I’m okay. It’s gone.’ The wolf didn’t seem convinced if her nuzzling was anything to go by.
Severus was holding a vial with gloved hands. With am extremely steady hand, the Potions Master was extracting flakes of something from the bottom of the glass with a set of comically long tweezers. Draco peeked over Severus’ shoulder and spied four more vials, all filled with the same flaky substance, only these were coloured differently from the first and each other.
The first, and the most sensible, was
After a few beats of dead silence, the boy peered from the branch he stood on and then jumped from the great height with a grace that belied his age and height.
‘I don’t. You two have done nothing but offend me this morning.’ Colther huffed.
After crafting a ring of fenced dead wood like the hairy creature kept, Harry then slapped paste on them all, muttering about
air was hot and cloying that morning. It was sleepy in the forest; both animals and plants alike seemed to drop under the blanket of constant, almost wet heat.
They sighed in unison before glaring at each other and marching forward.
‘I would disappear for a while Jonah.’ Firenze advised.
‘In a fashion.’ Albus offered before conjuring creeping ivy and wildflowers around the boy.
The man was a concerning shade of violet.
His pack were as his side in a flash, circling him. Their noses brushes against his legs, checking for wounds and yipping when they found none.
‘How are they different?’ Harry hesitated. ‘I know my magic isn’t…alive like yours.’
‘I am certain he is Severus.’ Albus said as he checked the child’s fingernails before holding them up for the Potion’s Master to see. The boy’s fingers were stained orange and purplish pink.
They were quickly interrupted again by the whirlwind boy who in a blink had released his hold on Lupin and then tackled Minerva to the ground which resulted in a puff of Autumn’s leaves dancing around them.
Not even dazed by Severus’ increasingly high-pitched and desperate shouts of ‘Get him
