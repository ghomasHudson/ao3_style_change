"Right now you don't, but you'll find someone better. You're the chosen one, no one will be pleased when they find out you're fooling around with me: a Death Eater."
Harry's eyes suddenly lit up and Draco felt mildly worried. "Are you saying you've played pranks before?"
He was at the table when Draco finally noticed him, practically jumping out of his skin as he took in Harry's form.
Moving over to the end of his bed he reached under and pulled out the Marauder's map. It had been a while since he'd really looked at it.
"Sure, but shouldn't you be working to find who the room smells of - instead of messing around with me?" Harry said, putting a hand up to Draco's chest to push him away, but he just grabbed that hand as well and intertwined their fingers.
"I don't think it's that bad at all," Lavender said. She seemed to be enjoying watching people kiss.
"Yeah Harry, will you be okay?" Seamus said with a smirk and Dean snickered hiding his face with his hand and turning away slightly.
He couldn't stop it though and he felt the hot tears make their way down his cheeks. He'd finally been able to befriend Harry, the thing he'd wanted since he first laid his eyes on this boy, and now he'd messed it all up. Why'd he have to be so stupid?
"You're seriously not mad," Draco asked, beyond confused at this point and his head was spinning with the new information.
"Hey! Can't you just let me enjoy it for once!" Ron said, well tried to say anyway. What came out was just a mumbled mess around the food, but Hermione still understood him.
"Get it off yourself," Draco grumbled, picking his wand off the floor as Harry struggled with the vines, "And you should remember covering them." Draco watched Harry struggle for a moment, "Oh wait, you slept through the whole class, that's right."
Dean smirked at Seamus and whispered back, "Want me to only name one of the people in that relationship? Or both?"
Hermione seemed to contemplate this for a second. "And you're sure you didn't mess up the potion at all?"
"Alright," Harry croaked and Madam Pomfrey tutted before hurrying off to return with some kind of painkiller.
"How can you still not be bored with staring at me? You've been doing that for over an hour too," Draco shot back.
And then it all came flooding back to him. Pansy was the one who had messed with the potion, but she'd also only done it because she thought it would make them admit their feelings to each other. His head was hurting too bad to think about this too deeply and he flopped back onto his bed.
"What was step three and four again?" Draco asked, he was laying sideways on the bed and had his head hanging over the side, his hair hanging down.
Harry caught sight of Draco first as he made his way towards the entrance of the restaurant. His breath caught in his throat at the sight, Draco was absolutely stunning. His hair was loosely styled in that way that made Harry’s head spin and Pansy had evidently also roped him into wearing eyeliner and Harry had to admit he was glad she had. It made his grey eyes almost seem blue and Harry had a hard time not stareing. “Wow- you look-” Harry tried, stumbling over his words. “Amazing,” he finally managed as Draco laughed.
Harry arrived back to the dorm room a few minutes before two to find Draco already there, sitting up in his bed.
"Yeah, of course. Thanks, Ron." They stood there awkwardly for a moment, Harry hovering on the stairs and Ron studying him. "Hey, I'm really tired, I'm going to head to bed. You should too."
The end of the quarter came faster than Harry expected and he found himself seated next to Draco at the Gryffindor table at the feast the day before everyone would go home for the holidays - or stay at the castle.
"So, the leaves are starting to turn brown and fall off. Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression they should be green and attached to the plant," Blaise said, putting his hand on hips and tilting them to the side, all the while glowering down at the plant. Neville had to tear his eyes away.
Draco looked at him shocked for a moment, there were a million things he was expecting Harry to ask him, but that definitely wasn't one. "Well, not common exactly. Why do you ask?"
Molly left then to go wake up the rest of the house and Ron sleepily made his way down the hall to the restroom to look for Harry. When he got there though, it was empty. Maybe he's with Hermione or in a different bathroom, he wondered to himself and made his way upstairs to check. The other bathrooms were all empty though and when he made it to Ginny's room neither her nor Hermione knew where he was.
Draco kept coming to sit at Harry's table though, even if it was at times a bit weird, because it was worth it if he got to be with Harry.
"Alright," Harry said and then paused, trying to think of a good pick up line. "Do you believe in love at first sight—or should I walk by again?"
"Um, I was just wondering... if um, well if you'd like to do something together sometime? Like study or-or something else too, if you don't want to," the girl was red up to her ears now and Harry didn't really want to turn her down in front of all the Gryffindors in their area, but he really didn't know what else to do, not to mention he was totally off guard.
"You're awake," Draco said, noticing Harry staring at him as he collected his clothes to change, "Good morning."
Harry leaned into Draco's lips again and soon he was pressing Draco down into the mattress and pressing wet kisses down his neck and to his collarbone.
"Here's the notes you were asking for the other day from Potions," Hermione said, "I just finished my homework and figured you'd be needing them. Ron and I are going to the library to study after Hogsmeade."
"It'll be interesting watching from the stands for once though," Harry said, joining the conversation after finally tearing his eyes away from Draco.
As the final class of the day ended though both Harry and Draco had reached peak levels of nervousness.
Ginny and Luna were sitting on Ginny's bed in Gryffindor tower. All her roommates were at lunch already so they had the place to themselves.
"I can't believe it's already November," Harry said, gazing out over the lake. The sun had set not too long ago and the stars were out, their reflections in the water glowed and Harry wished he could freeze time. "The year has gone so fast."
"Oh, the tryout dates for Quidditch have been put out. Of course, none of us can try out tho. Slytherin is set for the 5th and 6th, Hufflepuff for the 7th and 8th, Gryffindor for the 12th and 13th, and Ravenclaw for the 14th and 15th. Speaking of Quidditch, when will the team be announced for the eighth years? Dean's been really excited about it."
Draco let out a long sigh, knowing he lost, and scooted closer to Harry who reached his hand up and placed it on Draco's neck. And then Draco felt lips on his and he shut his eyes tightly. I am kissing Harry Potter, actually kissing him, Draco thought and his stomach did a flip at the thought. Their lips were pressed together awkwardly, the exact thing Pansy said not to do.
Harry looked out the window as the train started to pull away from the station and closed his eyes as Hermione and Ron continued to talk to each other.
Draco moaned, hand coming down from his grasp of Harry's hands on the wall, to grab onto Harry's hair and pulling. Draco clenched his teeth as he came inside of him, collapsing against the wall with Harry as he pulled out, panting.
"And it looks like Cooper has caught sight of the snitch! -- Harper seems to have located the Snitch as well -- Demelza Robins scores, ten points to Gryffindor -- Harper runs into Cooper, she's thrown off course -- oh wait, she caught up to Harper again -- Cooper caught the snitch! 150 points to Gryffindor -- Gryffindor wins, 240 to 110!" the ravenclaw's voice boomed over the pitch.
Draco's heart rate picked up as Blaise turned to ask Pansy the next question and Draco realized he'd be next.
"Oh yeah, I can't blame him," Ginny murmured and they both turned to look over to where it looked like Blaise and Pansy were teasing Draco again. "He seems happy."
"Yeah you gotta do it or we'll all just come up with something worse for you!" Seamus cackled and Dean swung placed his arm around Seamus' waist and kept him from tipping over. Seamus was only slightly less drunk than Pansy. Ron looked around at the group slightly horrified.
Draco saw Harry looking around the room uncomfortably, "Yeah, I know. I don't like this room much either. Let me show you the gardens since we have some time, you'll like them a lot better."
"I can say whatever I want and you can't dictate where I can and can't go," Blaise shot back with that familiar smirk that was common to his house.
"Mmhmm," Harry mumbled, watching Draco walk up the stairs. "Here can you hold this for a moment Ron? I've gotta make sure he doesn't chuck my things out the window or something," Harry handed his cake slice off to Ron and then rushed up the stairs as fast as his body would let him.
Harry felt Draco's lips brush against his neck as he spoke, growing more and more aware of how Draco was affecting him. He felt his neck grow warm.
From there on the game slowly became a bunch of kissing dares and more nosy truths: Dean and Seamus kissed, Pansy kissed Lavender, and Milicent was dared to sit on Goyle's lap for a few rounds.
Harry went to tilt his glass back when he caught sight of Draco taking a shot as well and he almost choked. Had he slept naked in the dorms this year? Did I just not notice? His mind was suddenly a whirlwind of questions that were less than appropriate and he almost missed the next question.
Draco paused for a second as for a moment two different interpretations of that went through his head: Harry was worried for him or Harry was worried he was going to do something evil again. He chose to interpret it as the latter as it gave him a reason to argue; they had been too friendly lately and he needed to return it to normal.
"Okay, last question," Hermione said, picking up the last piece of paper. "Never have I ever liked someone in the circle." Everyone took a shot except Goyle who blushed from the embarrassment.
"I can only imagine what sharing a dorm with them for six years was like," Draco grumbled, he didn't seem very intimidating though with the blush coating his cheeks.
"Well me telling you to stop fighting won't change anything," Hermione sighed. "While you were in McGonagall's office we were discussing starting a weekly party of sorts."
Ron had to admit that Draco truly hadn't done anything this school year so far, but it didn't mean he liked him any more.
"Oh, um- yeah, he can still be a git- ow!" Hermione elbowed him again, "but he's been pretty nice to us this year. I think he regrets how he acted in the past. He and Harry are roommates too, and they've gotten along pretty well."
He shifted his head to the side a bit to take in Draco's sleeping form next to him. He hadn't slept in his own bed since then and his favorite part was getting to wake up every morning to Draco's bed head and his face shoved in his neck.
Snape cut in then, "It seems someone has slipped amortentia into your potion; that, or you happened to accidently put all of the ingredients into your potion," Snape drawled, obviously angry about the inconvenience, "Though I highly doubt even you'd manage that."
"Alright," Harry said, gladly following Draco out of the room and into the hall. "How do you find your way around here, it's huge," Harry asked as they rounded another corner to find more hallway.
"Yeah, like Ron and Hermione glow brighter a lot. I haven't really watched many people though," Harry looked over at Draco, taking him in, "You're always glowing pretty bright though."
"I wanted to say sorry," Harry said as he finally found the words, "I wanted to apologize for how I acted towards you, I ignored you after the war, and I'm sorry about that. It was selfish."
"Pipe down Weasley," Pansy replied coolly, "that's part of the game. If it was that big of a deal, then they can just take a shot." Ron glared at her.
Harry suddenly turned red, forgetting that he even had the jumper on. Draco thought faster than Harry though, "He was cold and I don't need him complaining about a cold later," he said, pushing past Ron with an eye roll.
"Took ya long enough," Ron said with a smirk as Harry entered, "What did the Ravenclaw captain have to say?"
"Pansy," Hermione replied confidently. Pansy was a great roommate, Hermione thought and was glad she had roomed with her. She wouldn't change her roommate if she could. Lavender flipped the coin and it landed on heads.
The three adults seemed to take a moment to let the information sink in, until Pomfrey finally spoke up, "Since we're still not sure what the potion will do, I think it's best to just monitor you for a while until we know more."
"Hmmm," Pomfrey said, worrying her pen between her fingers, her eyebrows scrunched up in concentration, "I have a feeling you all are probably right..."
Harry's face was bright red and Draco was trying to recover. Harry was praying that Ron hadn't seen, he was not ready to have to explain it to Ron.
"Yeah, that's a good idea," Ron said, "Much better than mailing your gift. I like seeing you open them."
His mind was still reeling over the turn of events though. First Dean and Seamus are dating, then Harry seems to like Draco, then Hermione might be gay...
"Harry your rambling," Dean said with a laugh and a nervous smile spread across Harry's face, "But about when we knew we were gay, it started like how you described: I realized that I was looking at guys as well as girls and it just came down to experimentation.
Monday morning came and it was awkward to say the least, they both avoided each other as they got ready and for once Harry was the first out of the dorm.
"Hey, didn't know you came up," Harry said, walking over to his trunk to get clothes to change into.
Hermione laughed, standing up and grabbing onto Ron's hand to pull him up next. "Come on, it isn't that bad." They headed up the stairs to go to Ron's room and swap shirts and everyone laughed at Ron's face as they disappeared around the corner.
“I think my leg may be broken, but before we go to the hospital will you marry me?” Harry interrupted, a slightly pained look on his face.
"Maybe I should go drink some of that potion so I can let you know. I'm interested to see what everyone looks like too."
Hermione noticed him walking over and stood up, rushing over to him, " you need to stop fighting with him! Look at your face, you-!"
Neville let out a laugh that caused Blaise to feel a bit better at least, "What'd he do this time then?"
"Yeah Yeah," Harry laughed, sliding down to lay his head on Draco's shoulder with a contented sigh. He felt Draco lay his head down on top of his own and they slipped into a comfortable silence.
Potions was awkward as Harry and Draco were partnered up. They only talked to each other when they absolutely had to. People were starting to notice by mid day and rumors were traveling around the school. Everything from Draco cursing Harry mute to people saying Draco had tried to kill Harry. The last one made Harry angry when he'd heard it.
"Sorry," Harry apologized, trying to think of a reason he had left and coming up with nothing, "I uh- I went to visit a friend."
"What are you getting at Pansy?" Draco said, shooting her a warning look. He really hoped she wouldn't start talking about her weird proclamation of him liking Harry in front of him.
"So do I, you were incredibly dense," Hermione laughed and spun the bottle with her free hand and it landed on Lavender. "Truth or dare?"
"How would a stupid dare change how the punishment went?" Draco was trying to find his place in the textbook.
"I didn't know that!" Ron said, surprised as he looked over towards Blaise and Neville, who were blushing and backing up from each other.
Draco felt a rush of power at knowing he was the one reducing Harry Potter into the mess before him. It was oddly nice and made him feel wanted in a way he hadn't really ever felt before.
The gentleness with which Draco spoke, took Harry by surprise. How am I ever supposed to get over him if he keeps doing things like this, Harry thought. Harry sucked in a shuddering breath, "I don't always remember them. They're often jumbled up and make little sense." Harry sighed and looked down at Draco who was still leaning on his shoulder. Draco didn't say anything, simply letting Harry speak. "Tonight though, I know it was about my aunt and uncle. They're who I used to live with after my parents... you know." Harry stopped then and Draco realized he didn't know how to continue.
"That looks like a love letter," Seamus helpfully put in, "you seem to be getting a lot of those lately."
Just because he's nice to you doesn't mean he likes you. You're friends, or you were until you kissed him.
"Yeah, but it'd all be a lie," Dean put in. "It's not like they'd actually be getting along, and it's not like they can pretend to either. As you've noticed, they're not too good at that." Dean sent Harry a smirk and he turned slightly red.
"This has got to stop Harry, we should probably call it quits or McGonagall isn't going to let anyone play. You and Ron have enough information to pick the team right?" Hermione said to Harry. She had come down from the stands to talk to Harry and they were both currently trying to figure out what to do.
The others slowly dispersed after a pointed look from Hermione, and started towards the castle, all for Draco and Pansy who followed Harry and Hermione up to Blaise and Ron.
Harry suddenly tilted his head and then moved his lips against Draco's. Draco's head was spinning oh merlin, he thought. Harry's lips were softer than he thought and he suddenly felt himself melting into Harry as they kissed.
"I'm just telling the Death Eater that if he decides to attack you or anyone again he's going to have to deal with our whole house too," the kid sneered at Draco.
Draco slid down next to him laughing as well as he leaned his head against Harry's shoulder. "I never thought I'd ever pull a prank with you of all people."
"Yeah, you're probably right," Harry said with a sigh to Hermione and then turned to the others, "Okay, tryouts are over! We'll get back to you all about who made the team, thanks for coming!"
Before Harry could even think about it, he was agreeing and Draco was sitting down next to him - rather closely - and getting some looks from other students.
"That's great!" Hermione said happily and Ginny beamed over at her. "Do you two want to join us? I can get a waitress over here for you two if you'd like.
It had seemed that would be all anyone would be talking about for the next few days, until McGonagall announced that she had good news: the staff had agreed that it'd be a good idea to hold another Yule ball for those in fourth year or older. It had been decided that it'd be a good activity everyone could have fun at, especially after the last year.
"I'm gonna go to the restroom," Harry said, slipping his chocolate frogs into his pocket and slipping out the door. He didn't mind if they knew he wasn't going to the bathroom, he figured, they'd probably just think I was being nice and letting them have some time alone.
"-And we'll go clockwise around the circle, taking turns to draw a paper. Any questions?" Pansy finished up telling the rules and everyone nodded in understanding.
"Yeah, that would make a lot more sense actually," Harry said, leaning back against his bed frame and looking over at Draco who was laying on his back with his legs hanging over the side. Harry shook his head telling himself that he needs to stop staring at Draco.
"There you are!" Hermione jumped up from the table, Ron groaned at her voice as it sent another round of pain rocking through his skull.
"How was your Christmas?" Harry asked as they made their way up the stairs to Ginny's room where Hermione would be staying.
“Astronomy tower at 7 pm this Saturday, and you better not be late. Oh, and you’re taking me on a date Saturday,” Draco said with a smirk and then left to go find Pansy.
"Precisely! That's the whole reason why I messed with that potion!" Pansy tilted her bottle towards Draco, the liquid sloshing dangerously close to the edge of the bottle, "Knew neither of you'd be able to say anything to each other without some kind of aid. Though, you managed to kiss him!" Blaise snickered as Pansy gulped down more of the contents of the bottle. "I'm just bummed it didn't work right. I did research and everything," Pansy complained.
"Well that changes things a bit I guess," Hermione said, running her hand over her face, "though, maybe we can talk to them and see if they did anything new in the past few days, if so we could try to look for a pattern between people of the same color."
When he was fully inside he allowed Harry a moment to get used to him. When Harry reached up to drag Draco down for a kiss he took that as his que to move. Draco started off at a slow pace as he let his lips trail down Harry's cheek and neck softly, but soon Harry was rocking himself up to meet Draco's thrusts trying to make him go faster.
I wish I could be there too, not that I'd particularly enjoy being surrounded by 11 Weasley's for break, but for you. It's nice here, but I still miss seeing you every day. I think you'd enjoy the manor, or at least parts of it, one day maybe you can pay a visit here. I know there are parts of it that probably hold bad memories, but there's a lot more here too. Like I mentioned before, the gardens are very pretty. We have a greenhouse, which is where I read with my mother, that's full of different plants from all over the world. I recon Longbottom would enjoy it. We also have many acres around the house that we could fly on, no muggle would be able to see us.
“Okay, say you’re right, why didn’t he ask me then? He knows I like him. Even if I hadn’t literally kissed him, he can literally see me glowing.”
Draco woke up in one of the stiff hospital beds. The white ceiling was blinding and he shifted his head to look at where Madam Pomfrey was fussing over another student in the corner.
When they both made it back to the castle they had just enough time to wash up and change for dinner.
"I suppose," Harry said. Draco could tell he didn't buy it, but maybe it eased his fears a bit at the least.
Harry felt his face heat up as he realized that Draco had in fact noticed that he'd been staring at him.
"Here, take this." Draco opened an eye and saw Harry was holding out a glass of water and holding something else in his other hand.
"Are you okay?" Hermione asked. They had been sitting in the dining hall for the last ten minutes and Harry hadn't said a word, just mindlessly stared down at his plate.
"Okay, I finished my part," Harry whispered, crouching down next to Draco. They were both hidden behind a statue just outside filch's office.
A smirk spread across her face and she suddenly flopped against Draco who was sitting on her left. "Oh Pansy, Potter looked at me again today! He's such a git!" Pansy said in a high pitch, imitating Draco.
Draco had fallen off the bed in surprise at their position and Harry stared at him over the side of the bed and Draco stared back wide-eyed and stuttering.
"Well it didn't work Pansy! So what now!?" Draco practically yelled and watched as Pansy shrunk back in the way she did when she knew she was in the wrong. "I need some fresh air," Draco seethed, throwing on his shoes and leaving the room.
"That's just an odd mix," Hermione said, almost like she was talking to herself, "I don't imagine it would kill you, especially as none of the ingredients react badly towards each other... I imagine it was someone who wanted a specific effect or they didn't know what they were doing. It just seems odd."
"Well you were in Slytherin and you're a pureblood and extremely annoying. We figured you were a great candidate."
"Sorry, I didn't think I'd be gone so long," Harry said, embarrassed. He really hadn't been planning on staying the night at Draco's.
Draco looked over at him for a moment and he seemed to glow a bit brighter which just confused Harry even more. "It makes even less sense that the potion seems to have no effect besides your headache and the glowing."
“You said sorry in your letter,” Draco pointed out, and Harry couldn’t help but notice the anger in his voice.
Hermione looked over to Harry wondering if he realized just how awkward the situation felt, only to find Harry dumbly staring at Draco as he mumbled thanks.
The walk down to the greenhouse was fairly quiet, but it was less tense than it was before. When they finally arrived, Blaise led the way over to his bubotuber.
"Like, is it bad between you and Malfoy? After last night I mean, you remember right? I don't think you were drunk enough at that time to forget." Harry colored as he realized what she was talking about. "I mean, he usually sits on the other side of the table and now he's sitting with his back to you."
Hermione eyed them before realizing he was never going to continue what he was saying without prompting, "What did they find out, Harry," Hermione said, finally gaining Harry's attention back.
This was one of my most favorite chapters to write so far, I hope you enjoyed it as much as I enjoyed writing it!
"But that doesn't make sense. Draco was working on it with me, whoever did it couldn't have known Draco wouldn't be next to me when it exploded. Someone getting revenge wouldn't attack him."
"Draco, I'm not asking for much here. I just want you to be honest at least," Harry said and Draco finally turned to look at him. Harry could see the fear lurking in his eyes, but he pressed on, "I like you. A lot. I don't want to pressure you, and if you really don't want to I'll back off, but I wanted to ask you out. On a date."
"Fine, I'll talk to you two later then," and with that Draco started walking back towards the castle with Harry hurrying to catch up.
"We were always so worried about everything happening in the world through our school years. None of us really were able to focus on other things and Draco had the worst of it, he was so concerned with his parents' politics that he let that affect how he viewed everything. I know he wanted to have been friends with Potter first year, and now that he's older I know he wants more than that, and this is his chance at it," Pansy let out a long sigh, "I've noticed the looks Potter sends Draco's way at meals and the way he looks at Draco when they're together. Draco has a very good chance and I just don't want him to screw this up for himself."
Maybe he is going to do it, Draco thought to himself, there’s still hope. If not, I can always do it myself. “Sure, I’d love to,” Draco said, taking Harry’s hand up in his own as they made their way down the street.
"Veritaserum and amortentia were supposed to cause you two to confess your feelings towards each other when you drank it, but instead it blew up!"
Harry was grabbing the last cushion when he heard someone coming down the stairs to the girls dormitories. "Hurry, someone's coming," Harry hissed, grabbing the cushion and running for the stairs, Draco hot on his heels.
"We were able to snag a lot today while everyone was eating. Figured we could use it for future games if we have extra," Seamus supplied.
"Oh definitely Parkinson," Ginny laughed and when the coin landed on heads and the question was shared, Pansy looked oddly proud.
Dinner time came too soon and Harry realized he had spent more time staring at Draco than working and he still hadn't done much. Well, he could always work later he supposed.
"Listen, I know it's kind of awkward between us now, after the whole dare and everything, but I don't want it to be," Blaise said as they were sealing the last vials of the potion, Neville turned to look at him. "It doesn't have to mean anything if you don't want it to, but if you do want it to mean something...." Blaise struggled for a moment with the words, rubbing his arm nervously, "I wanted to know if you wanted to hang out with me during the next Hogsmeade trip? If you don't want to I perfectly understand, and I don't want this to make anything awkward between us-"
Pansy returned with the pink notebook and resumed her position on the bed and opened it up scribbling in neat cursive 'Plan Blaise x Neville'.
"Huh? What?" Harry snapped back to the conversation, his brain slowly processing the question, "Oh, yeah I'm alright. My head hurts and," he paused for a moment wondering if he should tell her about the glowing - after all, the potion could've just gotten in his eyes - but decided it couldn't hurt, "and you're both glowing."
A/N: Hey all, so I want to be honest with you guys and let you know that I may run late or accidently skip update days during the next few weeks, please bear with me. My brother was diagnosed with Leukemia this week and my whole family is very worried about him. So if I don't update, that's why, though I'll try to keep the updates regular.
"Ugh!" Harry groaned, leaning back in the chair he'd been sitting in for the last fifty minutes. Draco and him had been sitting in the common room doing homework for almost an hour in silence and the murmuring around them had finally quieted down, but Harry's sound of annoyance proved useful at drawing in much attention. Draco shot him a pointed look. "I don't understand this!" Harry turned to look at Draco who had started on his work again.
Draco didn't say anything but Harry could see him looking at him worriedly. "Well, there's always the possibility you two simply messed up the potion," Pomfrey looked over at where Malfoy was sitting, "though I know that you're pretty good with potions, so it would seem more likely that someone tampered with it."
Draco quickly got out of bed and rushed over to him, calling his name. When Harry didn't wake, he reached out and gently shook his shoulder.
Harry reached up to place his hands on Draco's cheeks as he stared up at him. "I love you." Harry barely whispered it but Draco heard it loud and clear.
"Ha!" Draco shouted, grabbing onto Harry's arm and shaking him a bit. It sent a shiver down his spine. "Did you see that? First point!"
Harry turned a bit pink around the ears as he watched them shoving each other on the other side of the circle. He knew that Draco complained about him, sure, but he didn't realize just how much until then.
"Tell me about it." Harry swung his legs off the bed and stood up, walking to his trunk to get out some clothes.
"Draco!" Pansy shouted as he entered the common room, "Oh thank god you're okay! We weren't allowed to visit!"
"Yeah, but she said she would refuse to play any position other than Beater, something about how hitting the bludger around at people sounded fun," Hermione replied, laughing slightly.
Her voice seemed to knock sense back into Draco as he snapped back to himself, "I'm not leaving and you can't make me," he said defiantly, moving to sit down in the chair next to Harry's bed.
"Yelling at him about it isn't going to change anything, okay?" Hermione said, a pleading tone in her voice, "Plus it's getting late, let's just go inside okay?" Ron continued to glare at Blaise.
Harry woke up on Halloween and rushed down to eat. Hermione and Ron shared looks as Harry practically inhaled his food and then muttered a quick goodbye as he ran out of the dinning hall.
"N-no! Of course not! We are being punished, remember?" Draco stuttered, which only made Blaise laugh harder.
Harry felt his ears heat up, "Who says I went to go see anyone 'special'" Harry made air quotes with his fingers.
"Goodnight, 'Mione," Ron said, leaning forward and giving her a quick kiss as they reached her and Ginny's room.
"You should really listen to Granger, you know, chew your food before you talk," Blaise said, and Ron sent him a scowl.
"Simple. I know where the laundry room is so we can steal some extra blankets from there and then we can steal pillows from the common room."
When they reached the Great Hall doors Harry made a split second decision and told Ron and Hermione to go on without him as he hurried to catch up to Dean and Seamus.
Before Harry could respond, Hermione leaned over and whispered something in his ear. A grin spread over Harry's face as he looked over at Pansy, "I dare you to act like Draco for two rounds."
Harry slowly ran his hand in circles on Draco's back, feeling his muscles slowly relax and his breathing slow down.
Standing up too, Harry said, "We could still make the class if we go now, a scourgify would be good enough to clean up."
"If you're so bored go talk to Parkinson or Zabini," Harry's voice was slightly muffled by the pillows.
Everyone looked at her mildly shocked and even Seamus looked a little impressed. Ginny blushed a little before spinning the bottle and it landed on Hermione.
"No way," Draco breathed, reaching out to run his fingertips over their names in the dorm. "Where did you get this?"
Hermione seemed to buy it, "Oh I know! Next time we have a party, we're ending it sooner! That was way too late and half of Sunday was wasted because no one could wake up."
He watched as a house elf came in, then, and took away their plates. It was silent a few seconds more as Lucius finally folded the daily profit and set it down on the table. He took a breath like he was about to talk.
"Thanks for having me for breakfast," Harry said awkwardly, "but I really should be getting back to Ron's house. They're probably worried."
Sunday Draco sat at the Gryffindor table with the rest of the Slytherin trio for the welcome back feast. He was holding hands proudly with Harry and he could hear people talking about them through the hall, but for once he couldn't care less.
They found themselves pressing into each other’s sides as they walked, fingers brushing together, hidden behind the layers of clothing they had on to protect them from the cold.
Then again, when he thought about it, Draco had never really been reserved with touching him. The amount of times they'd held hands was staggering. Harry felt himself heat up at the thought. Was he thinking I liked him that entire time-?
"I think a lot of families want to spend time with their kids after last year," Ron said, "Families are getting a bit closer I've noticed."
Draco finally cleared his throat, "We can both eat lunch and then we can fulfil our punishment for the day, after."
"Yup! Apparently we all have Wrackspurts around our heads though," Seamus laughed and Luna smiled at him.
"Well we could bring food up to our room and-" Draco paused for a second, thinking, and then his eyes seemed to sparkle with mischief, "and we could build a fort."
"You wouldn't," Harry said as he reached forward and grabbed both of Draco's wrists and pulled him under the cloak as well, his anger melting as he pulled Draco towards himself. He could see the sorry look in Draco's eyes and he knew Draco well enough to know that the fight earlier was just Draco's fear talking.
Harry simply shrugged and Draco ran the towel over his forehead. Harry let out a breath of relief and closed his eyes at the feeling of the cool towel on his head. Draco moved the towel to Harry's neck where he let it stay to cool him off. Harry opened his eyes again and looked up at Draco. Their eyes met and Harry felt a spark pass between them, but Draco quickly looked away.
"Well of course not, everyone wants to be in Gryffindor because you're in it," Hermione said, turning to look at Harry, "I mean how often is it that one gets to be in the same house as the one who saved the wizarding world?"
"No, well I'm not sure I suppose. I've only seen three colors, but I suppose there could be more..." Harry looked over at Draco who was seated next to him. "Draco's red, so are you two and Pomfrey is light blue. When I came into the common room I think I saw someone who was pink, but I don't really know who it was."
Harry happily returned the hug, "Sorry, had to wait for everyone to go to sleep." Draco pulled back to take in Harry's clothes.
When Ginny got the bottle in her hands she prayed that it would land on anyone other than Ron. She gladly leaned over and kissed Luna when it landed on her. The kiss lasted longer than the prior ones and Pansy seemed to be pleased that the game was picking up and she tossed a bottle back, taking a big gulp of the burning liquid.
The eighth years that had come out to try out for the team were currently watching from the pitch as Ron and Blaise yelled at each other loudly in the stands.
Harry cried out, savoring the feeling of Draco's tongue trailing circles around his nipple as he soothed the bitten nipple and moved to the left. He could feel the heat in his stomach building and when Draco sucked rather roughly on Harry's nipple it completely undid him.
Harry pulled back to smile at him before diving forward to capture his lips. It felt so much better than the first, this time he could enjoy it, all thoughts fleeing his head as he let his hand find its way to the back of Draco’s head. His fingers tangled into the short blond hair and when Draco pressed forward and tilted his head slightly to the right, the kiss was immediately deepened.
"Five," They both said in unison and Ron let out a groan as he realized what would be happening next.
Harry flushed, as he realized Ron had come to the same conclusion he had: Draco was in love. He could only pray he didn't realize with whom.
Harry let out a laugh, hurrying to the love-seat in front of the fire to strip it of pillows and cushions.
The next 28 days they had to let the potion sit and mature and when October 5th rolled around, Harry was kind of interested to see how it turned out.
"About 45 more minutes," Harry replied, picking up his sheets from the floor and putting them on his bed.
"Let's go down to lunch, that'll make you feel better," Luna said, grabbing Ginny's hand and leading her down to the dinning hall.
That was all it took for their friends to understand- and for the entire school to know- and Draco and Harry finally let their nerves turn into excitement over the next few weeks they had planned. The train ride home was over faster than they expected and next thing they knew Harry and Draco were standing on a beach hand in hand.
"Whatever you say Draco," Pansy said and turned back to her food, Draco hated the knowing tone to her voice and the sympathy in her eyes. He did not like Potter. Not one bit, those girls just annoyed him because they only liked him for his fame and nothing else, it just pissed him off.
Draco felt a soft smile spread across his lips as he enjoyed the sensation of Harry's warm hand on his own.
"Thanks Hermione," Harry replied giving her a small smile. Draco followed his lead and stopped glaring at Pansy to shoot Hermione a small smile of her own.
Ron yawned and stretched out on the floor and both of the Patil twins excused themselves to go to bed.
“Wow, sprint here?” Draco says teasingly when Harry met him at the front, panting and clothes a mess.
When it was finally over, Harry practically jumped up, leaning down to help pull Draco up before another person could kiss him.
Harry remembered seeing them on the marauder's map last night, up late in the common room and his lips turned into a small smirk. He had an idea to get her off his case, "and what were you doing up so late? Draco and I were looking at the marauder's map last night, and you two were up oftly late in the common room last night." Harry was only teasing her to get her off his case, so he wasn't expecting it when her face heated up like a tomato. Then, if he wasn't surprised enough, she let out a loud gasp that drew the entire class' attention, which only made her turn redder.
"Come on Draco," Pansy complained as Draco worked on his homework in the common room next to Harry. It was the first day they had to do their punishment in front of others and Draco was in a sour mood, he didn't like all the looks they were drawing. Draco decided to keep ignoring Pansy as he had been for the past ten minutes.
The Three Broomsticks was warm and crowded with Hogwarts students when they arrived and they barely managed to snag a small table tucked into a corner.
Harry felt terrible now about pushing him away and yelling at him like he did a while ago. But on top of his guilt, Harry could feel his stomach turning with nerves, though he had no idea from what.
"Okay I have another game idea since it's not midnight yet," Pansy said and an evil smile crossed her lips.
Harry figured that at this point, even if Draco never liked him back, he'd be content if they could just remain friends.
Draco moved his arm down off his face and his eyes met Harry's. Their gaze held for a moment and Harry was thinking about leaning in when Draco broked the eye contact and turned his eyes towards the comb on the bed.
"How is that even remotely brilliant. He's stuck hanging out with Malfoy, Hermione. Malfoy," Ron shot her a look.
Draco was shocked when Harry finally started kissing back. Finally! he thought. He'd been dreaming of kissing Harry for years and he couldn't seem to wrap his mind around the fact that Harry was actually kissing him back. Sure, Draco had thought he hated Harry at one point, but he figured he never truly could, even if he tried.
"Yeah, yeah," he could tell she was rolling her eyes behind the mask, "Do you know where Ron is? I lost him in the crowd."
"Great, this will start tomorrow," McGonagall said and turned away, leaving Draco and Harry to glare at her retreating form.
"You have to hang out with each other for at least an hour a day on weekdays right? Well if you come to the party, then that'd count as hanging out right? As far as I know, McGonagall didn't really give you any rules on that." Draco and Harry both stared at her for a moment, neither of them had thought about that. "Plus, of course, there's also the reason I'm going: there's going to be alcohol."
"Yeah, everything's good. Don't stop for me. I'm just heading to bed," Harry mumbled a bit too quick and Hermione raked her eyes over Harry's form.
Draco and Harry found themselves seated in front of McGonagall's desk in a matter of minutes. McGonagall gave them both a disappointed look as they stared at their shoes.
Instead of working, he opted to watch Draco. His hair had grown out slightly over the summer and hung loosely around his head. At the beginning of the year Draco had come to school with it slicked back as usual until Harry made an off-hand comment that he should try to wear it loose. Draco hadn't slicked it back since and Harry felt kinda bad. It did look better though. Quite a lot.
But Harry was covering Draco's hand with his own and he didn't look like he was going to be taking off or berating him for his feelings any time soon.
As soon as the door closed behind them, though, Draco was on him: kissing Harry roughly, hands traveling up Harry's sides under his shirt.
"Well since about fourth year," Dean replied and Ron choked on his food again, and Hermione pounded on his back.
"We should be getting going too," Hermione said as everyone else seemed to agree and get up as well.
They took it really well, Harry thought, maybe I could talk to them, they might be able to help. But what if I end up not being gay, I don't really want to cause a stir if I'm not...
As it turned out, luck was on his side and he made it down the stairs and outside without anyone waking. He turned in place as soon as he made it onto the lawn and with a crack he was gone.
"Calling it an anniversary makes it sound like a good thing though," Hermione said, and Ron groaned.
"Well it is past two in the morning," Ron said. Dean and Seamus had fallen asleep together on the couch, Romilda Vane and Milicent had gone to bed an hour ago, Pansy and Blasie were beyond drunk and were starting to get a bit hysterical, and Harry was becoming sleepy with the amount of alcohol he had consumed.
"You should be thanking me. Now you have a chance to actually ask. Him. Out," Pansy looked pointedly at Draco for a second before continuing, "I'm sick of you just staring at him!"
"If you take me to Madam Puddifoots I won't hesitate to kill you in your sleep," Draco said as he caught sight of the horrid shop.
"Woah!" Harry said as he jumped, practically falling out of his bed. "You can't wake someone up like that! How did you even get in here?"
"Mmmhmm, and that's why you carried back several bags every Hogsmeade weekend for the last several years here?"
"You were extremely persistent though, I'll give you that. Trapped me in the potions store and everything."
Eventually the bottle landed on Lavender, who quickly fulfilled her dare of kissing Goyle, and then spun the bottle. It landed on Harry.
Draco sent him a glare but continued, "He kissed me about two weeks ago and then cornered me in potions the other day and asked me out."
"Since about six months ago?" Hermione said, confused now and Harry realized he'd just have to let it go or people were going to think he was weird.
"Oh good, I just started on that actually, we could work together," Draco said, and Oh God, he was scooting closer to Harry so their arms were touching. His loose hair falling slightly in his face as he leaned over to look at his work and Harry could smell his lavender shampoo. He could feel his face heating rapidly and tried not to stare too hard at him.
“I don’t want to go home just yet,” Harry said as they made their way out of the restaurant, “would you like to walk through the park for a bit? It’s a nice night.”
He watched as her eyes grew wider as she no doubt remembered what she had admitted to the night before, "Draco I didn't think-"
Their lips met and suddenly Blaise felt he wouldn't ever get enough of it. It was quite intoxicating to kiss Neville and he wondered why he didn't have more people fawning over him. Blaise raised his hand to cup Neville's cheek as they both leaned in further to each other.
Suddenly Harry was visible, the cloak laying beside him on the floor. Draco stared at it, mildly shocked for a second before recovering himself, the cloak wasn't important right now.
When Seamus made it back to the dorm room door and closed it, they all ran back down the stairs, snickering and tripping the whole way like little children.
Harry smiled that bright smile, that made Draco's heart flutter, at him. "Alright, it's a deal! Now get your jumper!"
"Andddd Gryffindor wins again," Harry laughed. "You really need to get better at picking who will win, Draco."
Harry woke to sunlight streaming in through the windows. He slowly opened his eyes to find blond hair and a warm body wrapped around him. Draco suddenly shifted closer to him and tightened his grasp around Harry's waist and he couldn't help the smile that crossed over his face. Harry shifted down a bit, as he was still slightly leaning on the headboard, to wrap his arms around Draco. Who cares if I'm not supposed to like him, Harry thought as Draco let out a contented sigh in his sleep, I can continue to dislike him in the morning.
"It is your problem because if you just sit there and read, I'm leaving and this hour won't count," Harry shot back, crossing his arms over his chest and glaring over at Draco.
"Yeah, just a bad dream. It's alright, you can go back to bed," Harry said, running his hand over his face.
Draco swung his legs down off the couch and headed over to them to take a couple bottles wordlessly, setting them on the table with practiced ease. The two other boys noticed the regal air Draco had about him as he placed the bottles down on the table, attributing it to his upbringing.
Narcissa was just finishing her eggs when Harry realized that everyone at Ron's house might be worried and looking for him. He didn't even know what time it was, if it was still early they probably weren't up, but who really knows. He had no way to know what time it was, he didn't know if the Malfoy family was early risers or not, so he couldn't even base a guess on that. He hadn't even seen outside yet today, so he couldn't judge it by how bright it was out either.
"Step three was ask him to hang out outside of school and step four was to ask him out," Pansy replied, making a few marks in the notebook. "But I guess you don't need to really worry about the steps now though, he said yes." Pansy smirked and went to sit down next to Blaise on the bed.
"No, of course not," Pomfrey said and Harry felt better. He hated the hospital wing, he's stayed more than his fair share of time in the hospital wing, and didn't plan to spend more this year too. "I just mean that I want you to let me know if you notice any changes and Snape and I will look into the effects of the potion combination in the meantime."
Draco slowly pulled away after a moment, “As much as I’d love to just sit out here and make out with you, we’re both going to catch a cold and I’d really like to eat lunch.”
Harry knew they looked a mess, he could feel his hair sticking up more than usual and when he glanced at Draco... well, he wasn't much better. Snickers and whispers were heard around the room as their classmates took in their appearance. Ron looked at Harry as if he'd grown a third head.
"Well since we had to room with someone from a different house, that meant that there were only two Huffelpuffs and slytherins to choose from.
Blaise's face lit up as he suddenly pulled Neville into a hug. "Thank God, I didn't know what I'd do if you said no. I'm so happy." Blaise pulled back and gave Neville a blinding smile.
The game lasted a little longer, but soon everyone was fighting against sleep and alcohol to fall asleep. People started gathering up the alcohol and heading to bed, Ginny and Luna heading out as well.
“Yeah,” he paused a moment as if thinking about something, before turning his face towards Harry, “if that’s alright?” He kept his voice low too and Harry decided to respond in the same tone.
"I'm sweaty and gross," Harry mumbled, "I should probably shower and then we can get back to setting up the fort."
He made his way down the train, peering into the compartments until he spotted Draco. He was seated next to Blaise and was talking to an animated Pansy.
Harry was staring at the board intently and Ron studied him. If Hermione was right, and Harry did like Draco, what would that mean? Ron thought. He figured it wouldn't change much between Harry and himself, but would it mean he'd have to hang out with Draco more? He figured he would. He didn't want to hang out with Draco, but he supposed he would, if only for Harry.
The sound of his name from Harry's mouth sent him over the edge and he stood up, fumbling with the button on his pants, pulling them down with his underwear. Draco leaned back against him letting their erections rub against each other and his breath caught in the back of his throat.
"What are the odds you'll let Seamus do your hair." Hermione and Ron turned back to the game as they heard Blaise asking Luna the next one.
"Well I only ever really knew a few people there. Well I mean, I knew everyone, but I wasn't friends with anyone except Pansy, Blaise, Crabbe, and Goyle. So, the parties were always really boring, just a bunch of walking around and greeting people. My father would make me dance with all the young women around my age."
"Yes, I think that would be a great idea, as I much prefer the silence," Draco shot a glare at Harry, and moved to go around him but Harry reached out and grabbed his arm.
"The seats are way too cold," Harry shivered a bit as he sat down on them and then cast the heating charm on them that Draco had just taught him and sighed in relief. "Ah that's better."
"I can see you as a healer more than I can see you as an auror," Draco said thoughtfully and Harry sent him a smile.
The game carried on for a bit, everyone drinking a bit and starting to get a little tipsy. Even Hermione gave in and was sharing a bottle of firewhiskey between her and Ron. It was Pansy's turn and the bottle rolled to a stop in front of Harry, who was feeling a bit more than tipsy.
When Draco got into his room it wasn't long after Harry had gone to bed, but Draco could tell he was already asleep by the soft snores he could hear coming from Harry' bed. Draco caught himself smiling and hurried to take a shower.
"You very well know that it's not my choice to be hanging out with him!" Harry defended, suddenly awake, "It's not like I enjoy his company Hermione. And I've already finished all my homework, Malfoy helped me with my potions essay." Hermione looked at Harry for a moment with shock written all over her face - no doubt from the fact Harry already had all his work done for the first time ever - but recovered quickly.
"Really?" Draco asked, suddenly very excited, not caring in the slightest how weird he might be acting at the moment. Only caring about just how nice Hermione was to let him borrow the book.
That was four days ago and today Draco was finally able to leave the hospital. The time in the hospital gave him a lot of time to think though and he felt like the time he spent laying on the bathroom floor, watching as his blood mixed with water and stained the stone floors, broke something inside him. He'd seen his life flash before his eyes and he'd been so close to death that perhaps this was the universe telling him that he had a second chance to try again, and if that was the case, the way he was living now was not how he wanted to spend his second chance.
“Move your hand up too,” Draco said, reaching to pull Harry’d hand back up to his hip instead of where it was currently resting a little too low. By the smug smile Harry gave him, he had a feeling it was on purpose.
"Not a clue," Harry mumbled, pushing his food around his plate. The fact that going with Draco even crossed his mind had him a bit stressed now.
Relief flooded Harry as he said his thanks for letting him know, and headed back to the dorms. It was great to know that there was an end in sight to the potions effects. Even if it hadn't seemed to do anything bad to him, it still made him nervous.
"Of course, as I said, I'd love more help," Neville said with a slight laugh as they finally reached McGonagall's office. "Lemon Drops."
Harry yanked the door open when they reached their room, chucking the pillows into the room and quickly closing the door when Draco made it into the room.
After tryouts ended and Ginny was assigning positions to the players, Harry and Draco decided that it'd probably be best to just head back as she looked pretty busy.
"Who would you kiss out of everyone in the circle?" Pansy whispered to Draco and he could feel the answer trying to escape his mouth. He had no way to lie though, that was part of playing these kinds of games with wizards: you couldn't lie.
“Harry comes to me for help planning dates more than you think,” Pansy smirked, “He’s dreadful at it you know. Anything nice he’s ever planned for you was at least partly due to me.”
It had been a month since Draco agreed to date Harry for real and Harry couldn't have been any happier. Even besides them dating, things had been going great. The eighth-year quidditch team had won against Gryffindor on Saturday, his grades had improved greatly with Draco's help, and he'd been having the most enjoyable year at Hogwarts so far. No crazy guy after him, no arch nemesis constantly bullying him, no weird mysteries to solve, and no insane tournaments to get volunteered for unwillingly.
"I'll go get the ingredients while you stir," Draco said as he moved away to find them in the store room.
"Yeah, okay," Harry said, glad to finally shut the textbook. Though it wasn't like he was reading it much anyway.
"Hmmm," Hermione mumbled, staring down at her plate, "Well I suppose we can scratch that idea off the list then. What about admiration? That could be similar to love and we don't exactly know what the effect of the veritaserum is."
"Hmmm, yeah maybe if I could by-pass the headache," Draco said, bumping Harry's shoulder with his. Harry smiled in return.
The fire was warm and Draco was drowsy. Not even twenty minutes after sitting down, his eyes were struggling to stay open and the book was slipping from his fingers.
"Ouch, that stings. Especially as I don't like them either," Blaise grabbed at his chest and pansy whacked him in the back of the head, "Hey!"
"Thanks guys," Seamus smiled and then noticed Harry sitting quietly and his smile dropped slightly, "You alright Harry? You've been awfully quiet."
It wasn't unnatural though, they spent so much time together, pressed up against each other, that it seemed more unnatural to be apart. It made him nervous how dependent on Draco he'd gotten.
A large Eagle Owl flew in as soon as he opened the window and he felt his heart skip a beat. He reached out and grabbed the letter and gave the owl a treat and hurried it back out the window before Ron could see the owl. The owl hooted angrily at him, but flew off to wait in a tree just outside the window for his response anyway.
Harry and Draco were currently sitting in their shared room, each on their own bed. Draco had suggested reading since they were to be stuck together for two hours. Harry didn't particularly like reading but agreed since Draco did. And now Harry was bored, like he knew he would be, and was currently trying to get Draco's attention from across the room. He'd caught himself doing this more and more in the last few days, during their time together Harry had been wanting to actually get to know him more. So now here he was, a week into their punishment, sitting across the room watching Draco read.
"Where on earth did you fall asleep at?" Hermione continued, "Neither of us saw you come back last night, and you weren't in bed when we woke up."
“I told you, I was nervous and didn’t know what to do! I was also kind of freaking out!” Harry threw his arms up and some people around the common room were starting to look over and give them weird looks so he dropped his voice level again, “If he kissed me again now, I wouldn’t shove him away!”
The notebook was a garish sparkly pink book that Pansy had showed up to school with after summer break in second year, and proclaimed it would be for any plans they made. Pansy always brought it to school every year even though it remained mostly empty..
Hermione was down reading in the common room when she heard a loud thud followed by a bunch of yelling which could only mean one thing: Harry and Malfoy where at it again.
"Well I have no idea where Granger and Weasley are, but Pansy and Blaise are sitting at the Slytherin table tonight. Something about finding Pansy a girlfriend, but I kind of wanted to sit next to you," Draco said the last part so quietly Harry barely caught it, but it brought a smile to his face anyway.
He remembered his stash of hangover potion in his bedside table and sat up to get it out. By the time he had downed a bottle, he could hear Pansy groaning as she woke up. Draco passed down a bottle of the potion to her wordlessly.
"Hey," Harry said and got up to walk over to Draco's bed where he sat next to him and Draco surprisingly didn't protest, "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to bring up any bad memories. For the record, I don't think you would have taken it if your family's life didn't depend on it."
“They’re quite cute and I get a bit bored here alone all the time. Odette has to leave so often, it leaves me little company,” Pansy said, filling up two cups of water for them. Odette was Pansy’s girlfriend of three years. She was a year older than Pansy and was currently interning under Ron’s brother, Charlie, and often has to leave for a few weeks at a time. Pansy was hoping to possibly move with her to Romania when school starts up for the year and Draco and Harry head off to Hogwarts to teach.
Breakfast had been pretty quiet, except for the low murmur of people talking about the quidditch match the next day. It was to be between Slytherin and Gryffindor, which meant it was going to be a rowdy match.
"Then, on the count of three both person A and B say a number from 1 to 10 and if the number is the same, person B must do what person A said."
"So your plan was to decide who to prank and then come to me to make up the idea?" Draco said, smirking down at Harry who was laying on his bed smiling sheepishly.
"Thanks, Malfoy. For listening," Harry said, a small smile gracing his features. The small smile made Draco happy and they both slid down into a laying position. Draco took the damp towel off Harry's neck and dropped it over the side of the bed.
That's when he realized just how bad he messed up and his eyes prickled. He tried to hold it back, it's my own fault, he told himself.
"Hey guys," Ginny said, walking into the compartment, sitting down beside Harry, "you took off so fast I lost you in the crowd!"
Pansy was smirking at him though, even after he finished his next turn, and he knew there was no way she'd let this go for a long while. As the game dragged on though, and Draco let himself relax a bit he couldn't help but feel a little disappointed that they weren't playing truth or dare this Friday. Though, he knew that if they played truth or dare that he'd most likely have to kiss Harry again, he still wanted to play. He hated to admit to himself though that the reason may be that he did want to kiss Harry again.
"Well you were at the party of course (A/N I guess I should clarify that the party they are talking about is not the one from Halloween at Hogwarts - that was just something I wrote for fun - the party they are talking about I didn't write.), but afterwards I'm pretty sure Harry stayed up a bit longer. He was still on the couch when we went to bed," Hermione said.
"Ron was complaining that Zabini was talking in his sleep about someone and seemed totally whipped. I guess he was dreaming about Neville."
"I'm bi," Hermione said, staring resolutely at the fire, if Ron was going to react poorly she didn't want to see it.
Draco sat back a moment to get his pants off and Harry's own quickly followed Draco's off the side of the bed.
"I was here earlier, but you weren't waking and Pomfrey forced me to go to class," Draco said all in a hurry and his words seemed to blur together a bit and it wasn't helping Harry's head that Draco seemed to be glowing red. "I was so worried."
Harry jumped a bit, "Yes! Thanks!" Draco watched in amusement as Harry hurried to grab his scarf and jacket.
“Hey, that’s true!” Ron said, catching on, “No more headaches from the colors! That’s gonna be nice I bet.”
"We should go too Malfoy, we still have to do our punishment for the day," Harry said, turning to Draco who didn't look pleased.
"I dare you to-" Pansy slurred her words a bit, she had by far drunk the most. She looked around at the group looking as if she was contemplating something, and then her eyes landed on Draco who didn't seem to be paying much attention. "To snog draco. And I don't mean any of that little kid shit where you just sit there with your lips touching. You gotta actually kiss him."
He didn't have anything to argue back but he still felt stupid. What if Draco had just gotten caught up in the moment like they usually did during dares. The fact that Draco kissed him back made Harry think Draco liked him, but why would he run away if he did. Harry was silently freaking out as he rounded the corner. He hoped he wouldn't run into anyone as it was late and he'd forgotten his invisibility cloak in the dorm and the Marauders Map.
“Yeah- yeah of course it’s alright, you’re always welcome.” Draco smiled at him, fingers tangling together between them slightly. Harry saw the slow blush creep up Draco’s ears and the haze glow a little brighter.
It was now a few hours to summer break though, and Draco and Harry decided it might be time to share their relationship status to Hermione and Ron, lest they start asking questions about why Draco was now living with Harry. But, after that their plans consisted of leaving to the beach for a few weeks to escape the press and reporters that were bound to come, if only for a couple more weeks.
"I'm just-" Harry sighed a bit, taking another sip of water and looking out over the grounds, "I'm a bit worried about what the whole potion means for Hogwarts and well... everyone I guess. If a death eater did manage to sneak into Hogwarts, I doubt they're going to just stop after one failed potion."
"I don't have anything I need to shop for today. I just didn't want to sit in the common room with you for two hours as you complain."
As soon as the door opened Hermione was throwing her arms around both Harry and Ron. "I missed you guys so much! How was your guys' Christmas?" she asked, letting go as Ron moved to let her inside.
But they wouldn't just go away, Draco realized as he laid in bed a few nights later, watching Harry read out of the corner of his eye.
Draco could hear Harry laughing at something the Weasel must have said and couldn't help feeling slightly jealous. Harry had only laughed like that twice for him: when they had the pillow fight and during that blasted game of Questions (or whatever the hell Potter called that game).
They stayed silent for a moment, wrapped up in each other’s arms when Draco suddenly pulled back, “Wait a minute, do you even know how to dance?”
"It's too cold for it only being October," Draco grumbled, taking off his cloak, setting it down on the seat next to himself. They'd selected a booth at the back in a semi-private area. It suited them both as neither of them liked the attention being in public brought.
The next place they found themselves was honey dukes and Harry had a bag full of candy and Draco was following behind laughing.
"Hey!" Draco yelled setting down his book to glare at Harry. Harry smirked over at him until he noticed how Draco's hair was sticking up and then he burst out laughing. Draco launched the pillow back, hitting harry straight in the head sending him falling off the bed.
"Like I'll ever get along with him," Draco scoffed, walking back to his bed to pick up his book and return it to his bookshelf.
Harry stared across the room, now. Watching as Draco's head bobbed as he laughed quietly at something Pansy said.
"Is-" Harry paused wondering if it was something he should even ask, but figured he might as well since they were already here, "is being gay, something common in the wizarding world?"
Harry scooped Draco up in his arms and carried him over to the bed, Draco letting out soft laughs the whole way there, Harry smiling as well.
"She came in and-" Draco couldn't manage another word as his mouth suddenly felt full of cotton and he struggled to breathe, his head was suddenly spinning. He vaguely heard a sob and wondered who had made it.
Draco and Harry had been arguing over what they were going to do for their punishment for the day and Harry had suggested they go into the Forbidden Forest.
"I've been meaning to talk to you about-" Harry stopped as he mulled over what he was about to say next in his head, he wasn't exactly sure where to begin. Ginny seemed to get it though, thank god, Harry thought.
“Unless it’s me,” Ron made a face, “I’d freak out if he liked me. Or ‘Mione.” Harry and Hermione both just stared at him. “What?! Don’t you think that would be super weird?”
"Alright, works for me," Harry said with a smile, that Draco returned with one of his own. They stared at each other for a moment until Pansy cleared her throat.
He was met with a long pathway lined with stone and water features that lead out to what was clearly the green house. He couldn't help but think about just how much money had been put into the greenhouse, let alone the rest of the house.
"Yep, you're the first to know about my stash. Don't tell anyone or Ron will look for it and steal some," Harry joked.
A few moments later Draco returned. His pants hung low on his hips and his arms were up, causing his shirt to inch up his stomach as he towel-dried his hair. This was a nightly occurrence that Harry didn't think he'd ever be able to forget or stop enjoying. He especially liked how Draco's hair looked after a shower: messy and wet and Harry longed to run his fingers through it.
They ran until Harry grabbed Draco, pulling him behind a tapestry. Not even a few seconds later they heard Filch's footsteps hurry past their hiding spot. "I'll find you, and you'll be expelled!" he shouted as he rushed past.
"Well, what are you working on?" Draco said, leaning over to inspect the book that Harry had not looked at once since he noticed Draco was in the library.
They made it up the pathway to the front of the house, Draco reached out pushing the grand doors open to admit them. Harry was immediately taken back to the time he, Ron and Hermione had been taken by death eaters.
"What did you think I was planning? That was kinda the point you know." Draco pressed his fingers to Harry's mouth meaningfully and Harry seemed to understand as he opened his mouth and wetted his fingers. Draco took more time than what was probably strictly necessary, but he had a hard time making him stop.
"New hair color. Are you blind as well as stupid now?" Draco said, setting his stuff down, "You know, you don't want to do the same thing all the time."
"Yeah," Draco responded and set it back down, "I haven't really played in a while. I'm worried that I'm not going to do very well at the matches."
The waitress had a bubbly personality and took their order with a smile and minimal looks at Draco. Their friendship wasn’t exactly secret information as the Daily Prophet had caught wind of it back at the beginning of the school year and had done a special on it. Draco and him had laughed about it and then promptly threw it away. Harry supposed the Prophet would be doing a special on their relationship again as soon as they caught wind that they were now dating.
"Uh," Harry started, realizing he had completely forgotten what he was working on. He looked down at the book, hoping it hadn't been too much time since Draco asked the question, frantically searching the page for anything that would tell him what it was again. "Potions," he finally got out after noticing the current page was a list of potions ingredients.
I'd definitely like to see the garden someday, and I'd imagine Neville would like it too. I'd also like to meet you in Diagon Alley too, we'll have to set a day.
"Well I don't care what you do, but I'm going to read," Draco responded as he walked over to his bed and plopped down.
"So, I've been talking to people for you guys because I imagine you haven't talked to anyone yet to see if their interested," Ron and Harry flashed her sheepish grins. Of course Granger did all the work, Draco thought, rolling his eyes as he listened to their conversation from his bed. "Anyway, there is interest, but not enough for two teams. I was thinking that instead of making two eighth-year teams that just have games against each other, what if we just make one and that team can have practice matches against the house teams?"
While it shouldn't be as weird to witness because she had seen him do the same thing all of sixth year, it still was strange watching him stare at Draco across the room for the tenth time this week. She figured the reason she found it so weird was that they were actually friends now. She had no idea what was going through his head either. The look on his face was a mix between contemplative and nervous and a whole slew of other emotions she couldn't place. The whole thing was weird.
"Excited for the Quidditch match Saturday? Gryffindor against Slytherin!" Seamus said loudly, taking up some food from the dishes in front of him.
"Well, uh- I have a girlfriend," Ginny started and Ron cut her off with a whoop of excitement, they all turned to stare at him.
Everyone was silent for a moment as they all seemed to take in exactly what that meant, waiting for someone to break the silence.
Dean then cast a quick tempus, "Oh crap! We're going to be late if we don't get going soon! Sorry Harry, we'll talk later if you have anymore questions!"
"I can only imagine. I bet your father ran all over these halls with the same wild hair and goofy glasses you've got too," Draco snickered.
"Alright, well, there should still be some time before we start games and such if you want to work more. I'm going up to shower," Harry said, already heading up the stairs. Draco watched him go until his body disappeared.
Molly sighed, "It's alright now, next time just leave a note though! I was worried sick! Now come along, lunch is ready!" She hurried out of the room to get the rest of the Weasley family.
"Sure," Draco laughed, leaning down and placing a soft kiss on Harry's lips. When Harry leaned up to continue the kiss, Draco pulled away and Harry complained. "You wanted to plan a prank, remember?"
"Oh that would have been horrible, thank god I didn't waste my one chance at getting you on a date, on that place." Draco smiled a shy smile over at him and Harry broke out in a smile too.
"Can I help?" Draco asked, trying to ignore the weird looks he was getting from different students as they made to head back to the castle.
“Yeah, I uh-” Harry started, heart feeling like it was going to leap out of his chest, “I wanted to apologize to start.”
"Is that so?" Draco and Harry had gotten in line to pay for the candies and people were starting to take notice of them together. Draco tried to ignore the stares and whispers.
Draco shot him an annoyed look, "And why would I tell you? Now if you don't mind, I quite liked the silence."
"Oh sorry," Hermione said when they bumped into each other. "Oh, sorry Malfoy," she said when she realized who it was, "I'll just uh-" she made to move around him when he stopped her.
The next day Harry found himself on the quidditch pitch running through a practice game. They were playing a practice quidditch match but with no snitch and less players on both sides.
“You should still go,” Harry muttered, looking away. Why can’t I just ask him to go with me, Harry internally groaned, I know he likes me. I’ve just got to ask him!
"Yeah, it's weird to think we won't be coming back here next year..." Hermione said looking up at the castle.
Ron flopped onto his bed when they made it to his room, "Ugh I'm so tired. Kinda bummed the fireworks didn't blow up or anything," Ron joked with a laugh.
"Sorry... if I woke you..." Harry murmured, already starting to drift back to sleep now that Draco was there. The dream had been about Draco, afterall. Harry had dreamed that Draco had fallen into the flames in the Room of Requirement and had been in the middle of a fit of panic when Draco woke him.
"Yeah, it shows where everyone is all the time," Harry said, eyes searching for Filch on the map, "if you think this is cool I also have an inv- Oh crap! He's coming back this way! Hurry, let's grab the stuff and get out of here." Harry snatched Ron's bag of things and then slammed the desk drawer shut, rushing out of the room after Draco.
"Leave it to you to read a book over the summer on room expansion spells just to try and figure out how we're going to be rooming," Ron said turning to Hermione with an exasperated look.
"I found this spot at the beginning of the school year. See how it slopes down, but you can't see any of the beach? It looks kinda like a cliff huh?" Draco nodded a bit, "Well, that's 'cause it's a bit of a secret cove. There's a hole in the rock that you have to squeeze through a bit here on the side," Harry pointed to what was, sure enough, a hole in the side of the rock formation, as they got closer. "Then, when you go through there, it opens up into a little cove with a small private beach."
Lavender took Goyle's unwillingness to kiss her the wrong way though, and looked extremely put out as she went back to her seat.
"Stop. Both of you," Hermione said, putting up a hand to stop Harry who was starting to mimic Draco, "The whole purpose of you two hanging out is for you two to stop fighting."
Hermione's cheeks pinkened slightly and she let out a breathy laugh, "Boys," she muttered with a roll of her eyes as she gave him a light kiss.
Harry had been aware of how close they pressed into each other as they talked about the match, of how close their faces got when it got particularly heated, of how their arms had practically been glued to each other since the moment they woke up.
"Reckon that's your replacement?" Draco asked, watching as the new player flew around between players.
"We should probably all head to bed," Neville added, he started to stand up and grab some of the empty bottles and put them in the bag Seamus and Dean brought them in. "I'll bring these to Seamus' room so he can get rid of them without Headmaster McGonagall finding them or another professor." Neville headed up to the dorms.
He was at the end of the stairwell when he looked up and saw Draco across the room, completely alone in the corner of the room. He looked like he was studying but Harry could tell by the way his eyes stared blankly at the same spot on the page, that he was thinking about other things.
"Well I'm up now, give me a moment and I'll be ready," Harry replied, getting out of bed and heading to his trunk to get out his uniform.
"I have no idea what you mean," Draco replied as he turned back to glaring at the girl who was talking to Potter.
"Thanks," Neville said with a smile as they left the shop and Blaise handed over his chocolate frogs.
"Why would I care when Potter will get here," Draco said with a slight scowl, but it didn't deter Seamus. If anything, it seemed to edge him on.
"Well, that's pretty much all I talked to, I'm sure there are more. Goyle played as a beater last year remember? So I'd imagine he might still be interested."
"Do you have any stores you want to go to in specific? I mostly just want to go to honeydukes and also see if I can find someone with a different color haze."
"Go away Malfoy," Ron said, sending Malfoy a glare as he started to laugh and walk off, Goyle, Pansy, and Blaise following behind.
"Can you go get the Alihotsy leaves from the pantry? We need more than I have in my potion kit," Draco asked.
When Harry finally pulled away they both looked a bit disheveled and red. Their lips were swollen and Draco let out a little laugh.
"I can't find my herbology notes or homework!" Ron shouted, turning his trunk inside out onto the floor. Blaise looked at the mess in distaste, he knew that would all remain there on the floor until Hermione paid a visit to Ron in his dorm and made him clean. He hoped she'd come visit soon.
"What's so interesting about that book? There's so many better things to do on a Saturday that reading," Pansy looked over at the book that lay in Draco's lap, Mastering Potions: Uses for Common Ingredients, "Like figuring out how you're going to get to shag Potter."
Harry looked over at Draco, this was news to him. As far as he knew, it was only Blaise and Neville working on brewing the potions. Harry broke out into a smile and pulled Draco into a tight hug. "You're amazing, you know that?" Harry mumbled into Draco's hair as he hugged him.
Draco glanced over at Harry, he was a lot better at sneaking glances than he was and hadn't been caught yet. What would my mom say about this if she knew, Draco thought to himself. He wondered if she'd care, or if she'd lose her mind over it, like his father would be sure to do. He figured it'd be the latter.
They both drank their Butterbeers in awkward silence. When Harry was about halfway through his drink he finally tried talking to Draco again about something else. Draco was quickly smiling again and had forgotten all about the intense moment they had both just shared.
"Where are we going?" Draco asked when they reached the doors leading out to the grounds of Hogwarts. They had practically run from their dorms and Draco was a little out of breath.
They walked in a comfortable silence for a bit before Draco decided to risk grabbing Harry's hand. They'd held hands, sure, but usually only when comforting one another.
"Well I'm not rooming with him, I'll just room with Blaise, not like McGonagall will know," Draco said, turning as if to go find Blaise.
"Last Friday... I know you remember it or you wouldn't be acting like this. Did you mean anything by it?"
Draco was a glowing ball of red light now. It was quite dazzling and it was even better now that it didn't give him a headache. Harry giggled a little drunkenly as he stumbled a bit into Draco's side.
"Our NEWTS of course," Hermione said like it was obvious, "and you should be studying too. They're coming up and I imagine you haven't even started making flash cards."
"Well of course more help would be great, but it's a lot to ask people, and not many are very dedicated to herbology."
"It is pretty cold," Hermione replied, leaning into Ron for warmth. Harry watched them, wishing Draco was there and then reminding himself that he'd see him soon.
"Hey guys!" Hermione said as she sat down across from them, Ron following her lead. "What're you guys talking about?"
At the beginning of the school year when Draco had come to apologize to Harry and they became friends, it had been beyond awkward between Harry and his friends when he'd hang out with Draco. Draco had apologized to Ron and Hermione of course, and while they'd accepted his apology (though that took a while), they hadn't really gotten used to him being around Harry.
"Yeah, I think she's trying to make it perfect for Percy because this'll be the last one for him living here. He's going to America this summer for work after all," Ginny chimed in as they set Hermione's things down.
Harry laughed and Draco loved the way his eyes seemed to glow in the starlight. Their arms brushed as Harry spoke, "You wouldn't want to go through the beginning though, all the colors made my head feel like it was going to split open. Like a permanent hang-over."
The kiss seemed to go on for ages, but it still wasn't quite long enough when Draco slowly pulled away. They both kept their eyes closed for a moment after, a sigh escaping Harry's lips. Then, suddenly realizing what he'd done, Draco's eyes shot open and he jumped up mumbling about being sorry. He quickly grabbed his wand and was gone before Harry could even react.
Draco chucked, happily returning the hug with a smile. "You're the amazing one, I just provide plants," Draco said and Harry laughed, pulling back and smothering Draco with kisses.
He felt hands grab onto his and squeeze gently. "Breathe in slowly, okay?" someone said and he felt himself complying, breathing in and letting it out slowly.
The day of the Quidditch match between Slytherin and Gryffindor had finally come and Harry and Draco had been teasing each other about who was the better team for the past few hours and it was starting to grate on everyone's nerves.
Harry stared at him a moment as the words sunk in, Harry could tell it was a lie by the way Draco's voice trembled slightly as he said it and by the look in his eyes. The words still stung though and Harry turned, grabbing up a cloak from the top drawer on his dresser - which he'd left open that morning - and started towards the door. "Fine. Whatever you want," he said as he disappeared around the door frame, leaving Draco still on the bed in the dorms feeling like his heart was just ripped from his chest.
"Well, maybe I wasn't interested in being 'just friends'," Draco whispered in his ear, making him blush harder and try to back up again, but Draco's hand on his hip held him in place.
"Five! Four! Three! Two! One!" George set off the fireworks all at once and everyone took a sip of their drinks.
Hermione smiled a bit at that, but was not nearly as embarrassed by the question as Neville had been by his, and confidently answered, "about third year."
Draco started to move then, yawning and raising his head up to look about himself. When his eyes settled on Harry's shocked form it took him a moment to respond, but when he did he suddenly jumped back muttering sorrys.
Draco noticed the book she was holding then, "Oh, is that Cushing's new book?" Draco said excitedly.
"That sounds good to me, gives us enough time to tell everyone. And he can tell the rest of the Slytherins," Ron said gesturing to Draco with barely hidden disgust and spitting Slytherins like it was a curse word. Draco scoffed at Ron and moved to get up.
"Uh- I was looking for Malfoy," Harry said from the door looking equal parts nervous and suspicious, he hadn't missed them slamming the notebook shut.
"Malfoy!" Harry shouted as he stormed after him up the stairs, barely pausing to round up his things on the table. Everyone in the common room shared a look and watched as Harry's back disappeared around the corner. Hermione felt a little worried.
When the bottle was finally handed back to Pansy from Blaise it was placed in the centre and Pansy volunteered to spin first. The bottle spun around a few times before slowing to a stop before Neville and Neville audibly gulped when he saw the look she was giving him.
"Oh, Pomfrey told me that the potion is supposed to wear off by New Years day. At 7:51 to be exact."
"Just get on with it Pansy," Draco said, dropping his head down to stare at his book, his face burning.
The shock was evident on everyone's face, including some of the people around the group, but before anyone could say anything Draco looked up and glared at Pansy.
"What have I told you about not talking with your mouth full," Hermione said, "What he was trying to say was that Quidditch practice is in an hour and Harry still hasn't come down from his room. He needs to eat."
"Draco!" Harry said a little louder, with a shake of his shoulder, and Draco finally started to move.
Hermione was starting to think that Harry may be going off the deep end again, and by that, she meant he was stalking Malfoy again.
Realization dawned on Ron's face and his mouth made an 'ohhh' soundlessly and lifted his own glass to his lips.
Harry almost immediately noticed how Malfoy's hair was swept off to the side messily instead of slicked back as it usually was and he couldn't help immediately thinking that it definitely looked much better.
After a moment Draco seemed to decide it wasn't going quick enough as he pulled away to move his lips to Harry's neck. His teeth dragged lightly across the skin above his collarbone and Harry let out a small whimper. Draco moved his hands between them, fingers running over the button of Harry's pants.
On the other hand, he and Ginny were back to being friends. Harry was sort of surprised to find out Ginny and Luna were dating at first, but now that he knew, he thought it quite obvious. He, Luna, and Ginny has taken to hanging out more often too, Luna had told him she was panromantic and asexual (he had to ask what that meant) while Ginny came out as bisexual to him. Harry found he rather liked hanging out with them together, but sometimes he felt a bit like an awkward third wheel.
"It was fine," Draco tried to say without giving away what'd he just spent the last hour doing, but failed miserably and what came out was more of a choked sob.
The kiss finally ended when Hermione pulled back slightly with a small smile, the kiss had been nice, but she still very much liked Ron.
"I told you... hah... to stop, now you're a mess!" Harry said breathlessly, fussing over Draco's face and he laughed.
When Ron walked through the door, he couldn't help the groan that escaped him at the sight of Draco.
"I wanted to talk," Harry said, looking over at Draco. Draco suddenly felt nervous as he went to sit next to Harry on the bed.
Harry liked how they were starting to hang out outside of the common room, and were doing things together that weren't homework. Of course, they still worked on their homework together as they still had to complete it, but more often than not they were actually doing something fun. He wondered what it would have been like if he had been sorted into Slytherin or Draco had been sorted into Gryffindor. Would they have been friends? He liked to think they would have.
