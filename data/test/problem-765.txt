She had known where he had gone.
Love love love.
“Hi, my name’s Bethany.” Draco took the offered hand, amused “I’m Draco” The small smile Bethany gave him was one of shyness and of innocence. Draco felt a pang of longing for the time when he had been- well not shy, but certainly innocent.
After returning to the castle, he angrily worked on his occlumency for hours. He didn’t sleep well that night.
Draco raised an eyebrow, “I believe that is what I said.”
“Shields up!” Bellatrix commanded of them, firing curses that Blaise and Draco barely managed to block.
“I-...
“But I’ve been writing to father about how much more ordered the school is and he’s taken my side on the issue. I just wanted to pass on the message that no matter what happens, you
Draco’s heart halted in his chest as he recognised Harry.
Blaise nodded slowly and leaned back, the small smile returning to his face, “I'll take your word for it…” he tapered off and then gestured to his cauldron “Um- So what exactly am I doing?”
“Come,” she said “I finished the designs for the badges, would you like to see?”
Draco would have stepped back had there not been a wall behind him. He had never been victim to that smile- it was frightening, and made his stomach drop… even more so because that smile had once belonged to a friend.
“I expect two rolls of parchment describing the properties of Dittany to be submitted to me by Monday morning. Those who fail to complete this task shall face detention. Dismissed.”  After Snape left the room groans filled the air- punctuated by the grumbles of various students.
The anger swelled in Draco’s mind and he felt himself launching his body towards Potter, resisting the urge use of magic, but wanting to hurt him anyway. The animalistic hatred having almost full control. It wanted to punch Potter. He tried to yank back against it, and managed to stop himself from hitting Potter- physically stumbling in the attempt. His face burned as Weasley laughed loudly.
Alone.
Voldemort didn’t even look at him as he walked past, neither did any of the Death Eaters.
muggles they had been discussing all night had written it. Draco found himself smiling.
Draco’s heart almost stopped as they rounded a corner and saw Harry standing there, his back to them. He was alone.
Hello hello! There are some delicate issues covered in this chapter. Please check the notes at the bottom before you make any judgments!
“This piece of paper declares you to be in charge of the family’s fortune when you reach your 17th birthday, and that you shall become the master of the house should something happen. You also cannot pass the position onto anyone else unless death, serious injury or incarceration occurs. Sign here” Draco paused, considering the implications. He sighed, realising once again, he had no choice. He raised his wand to the paper and his magical imprint was singed into the paper. The smell of smoke mixed with the smell of blood. His father nodded and tucked it away before stepping towards the doorway.
Draco's heart was racing, and he began to build his walls, from the ground up, as Snape had taught him to. He forced the word “Yes” to come out of his mouth. He didn’t know how his father would react to this information. He had been stupid not to see it coming, Father knew Draco had been blocking him out of dreams, and would know he was being trained.
Blaise was next to him and his mother was happy. He felt something loosen in his chest.
He was pleased to see that he had double potions after History of Magic and had a free period later in the day before Ancient Runes. Tuesday, however, bought Defence against the Dark Arts. He couldn’t help but wonder what lessons with Umbridge would bring.
“It could be any number of things- but my guess is that it’s his Horcrux. Because he came back from the dead.”
He reached out just as the screaming from the crowd reached it’s crescendo and placed the wand back in Harry's shirt, just above his hand which rested loosely on his chest. He leaned in, his voice as soft as his mothers had been. “Take it... it’s yours by right.” Just as Draco let go of the wand, he felt something change. The warmth somehow left him.
The tone was clear.
So it wasn’t so bad after all.
“I mean,' said Malfoy, raising his voice a little more, “if it's a question of influence with the Ministry, I don't think they've got much chance... from what my father says, they've been looking for an excuse to sack Arthur Weasley for years” Weasely shot him a very dirty look, but Granger’s hand was holding the redhead back.
He knew he could not continue on without emotions, he was not a fool. But he also knew that if he let this...
“He’s an asshole, plain and simple.” Draco sneered at a painting who looked shocked at his language. “-He doesn't like how much influence Umbridge has here by herself. He knows people high up in the Ministry but doesn't have as much power over her as he’d like… so he wants someone to keep an eye on her… And that fell to me. Also- I figured that telling her I was showing you around the school would be a good enough excuse to come in early before class starts.”
“There are bigger dragons to catch my friends,” he said, knowing they would hear the word ‘friends’ and forget anything else he might have said.
He had finished and taken notes on three chapters, and was well through his fourth when Pansy said “Draco, come on, we’re almost there. We should change into our robes now.” Despite being annoyed at the interruption he knew she was right. He got up and slowly stretched, he hadn’t moved in hours. He was pleased to see out of the corner of his eye that the new boy, Blaise, was watching him.
The thought of Blaise’s calming voice only made things worse, and the anger grew inside him.
Poor (P)
“Harry Potter is dead. He was killed as he ran away, trying to save himself while you lay down your lives for him,”
Draco had not been able to escape Crabbe or Goyle. He hadn't had time to tell Pansy not to bother to send the boys back to him and hadn't had time to escape the room before they had arrived to flank him, their faces delighted at the return to old ways.
Draco's eyes moved from the Mudblood to look at Potter, who brought up the rear of the Golden Trio. His messy hair fell over his face and his eyes were cast down. He was avoiding making eye contact with anyone... something he now often did unless provoked.
Dumbledore, seemingly done with the introductions, continued, “Tryouts for the house Quidditch teams will take place on the-”
I tried to do it in a more subtle way, that I think suits Draco's character a tad more.
Crabbe looked at Draco and smirked. “That doesn't mean I wouldn't have enjoyed punching him in his fat little face.”
“No!” He wrenched his hands from Blaise’s. “No- There’s a potion in my trunk that can heal me.” Draco used his wand to summon the small bottle from his trunk and saw Blaise looking at him with worry in his eyes.
As if it were something he could change!” He felt anger rise up in him, his voice became shaky. “Trust me I’ve tried to change it and I- I can’t! I tried to feel something for Pansy and I can’t!” The tears rolled down his cheeks uncontrollably now.
Like a predator getting ready to pounce, Draco watched as Goyle slowly raised his wand, a twisted smile on his face.
After almost falling asleep in History of Magic, thankful for his ability to take notes even when incredibly bored, Draco made his way to potions and grinned when he saw the potion sitting at the front of the class. They would be making the Draught of Peace which he was already proficiently good at, thanks to Snape's gift from the previous year.
Snape made a
“How dare you!” His father’s eyes were wild as he leapt up from the ground.
Then he would remember he was bound by blood, and his mother would suffer far more if he rebelled. He could do nothing.
But of course, Potter ruined it “Where’s Hagrid?” Potter asked the professor. At a poke in the back from Crabbe, Draco sighed, and seized the opportunity. He recalled the meeting he had overheard about Yaxely working with giants, and the mentioning of Hagrid being on the same journey.
He waited until his living room fireplace came up and jumped through. And there, in all her elegance, sat his mother, who had just looked around in shock. “Draco?”
The crowd around him buzzed, and got even more excited when the French girl was carried out by Hagrid. She was unconscious and limp. Draco sighed and was trying to return to his homework to attempt to ignore the annoying cries of the Beauxbatons when he was once again interrupted, this time by the unmistakable sound and sight of a portkey being activated.
“Breathe Draco” said Blaise, who was puffing himself, and was still trying to button his school robes up.
Blaise looked at him, confused, for what seemed like the longest time. “He didn’t tell you?”
Harry kissed him.
Oh I also have a tumblr but I dont plan to upload anything to that as im kinda mad at the website anddd its not as easy to get the word out about uploads, but if you dont have insta and want to ask me a question, feel free to follow me at satan-incarnated
You'll have to forgive me! I have an explanation.
As he was patting Theo’s shoulder, Draco spotted Potter, who was dressed similarly to Theo in standard dress robes but unlike Theo, he looked good in them. Very good.
“Hurting yourself is never the answer. It’s just a fucking hole that you dig deeper every time you do it. And then you dig so deep that you can’t get out. And it’s shit and you hate yourself for it and then you hate yourself so much that you can’t stand it and then you hurt yourself again.” Blaise’s words reminded him of the words his Mother had once spoken in the garden.
Draco paused, processing the statement. Then glanced at Theo and Blaise who were currently standing besides one another, looking solom.
If she found Draco, she might need a wand if they were to escape. She edged closer and closer. But she froze as a voice rang out.
in front of him and did exactly what he was told, hating every second.
“I don’t know,” said Crabbe, and Goyle just shrugged. Draco groaned, exasperated.
He walked to the door.
Crabbe and Goyle spoke simultaneously “What!?” apparently the two brain cells they shared couldn’t handle the information that Draco didn’t want to go bully people.
The logical thing at that point might have been to accept his death and just let the fire take him, yet he began hauling Goyle up a pile of junk beside him, trying to outrun the fire.
The sound of stone forming into wood- similar to the sound of ice cracking, let him know that he had been successful. He repressed the urge to run as the door once again materialised from nothing. He placed his hand on the large doorknob, and after a pause, pushed through it. The sounds of battle ceased to exist as the door gently closed behind them, but Draco barely noticed, because his heart was beating so loudly in his ears.
after Andromeda left. Certain measures were put in place, magical bindings.” She snorted. “Bellatrix never had those measures put in place for her. She was devoted not to her husband, but the cause.” Draco clenched his teeth.
This is going to be the last chapter for awhile- 2-4 weeks. Im in finals time and everything is stressssss
Wooo hefty chapter, the topic and conversation were hard to write so hopefully, it came across well. Please leave any suggestions for how I might have written it better! Or what you liked! It will definitely be appreciated and help a lot!! I don't have a Beta reader so its all in my head dude I cannot see whats bad.
“Draco!” He had no idea how long he had been standing there. He looked around. The train had already started to move. In the carriage door was Pansy, she had been the one to call his name.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” He asked, needing the truth.
Though he only saw it once he carefully looked for it- Harry’s chest was rising and falling.
down. Out of sight almost to himself, hoping and praying to all the gods whom he had never bothered to pray to before.
Draco wanted to kiss those--
Theo nodded, and patted his shoulder.
"Where did he go?"
The large concrete room had not been subjected to the same cleaning charms his living room had been given when father had been tortured- the walls and floor were splattered with blood. The smell of it filled his nose, along with the smell of piss and shit.
“Hi, my names Blaise, you must be Malfoy” Draco shook the offered hand.
Draco knew they were all still staring at him. “Nope.” He didn’t even bother to glance up. Goyle decided this meant he could speak.
he felt because of it…
He picked up and unrolled the Prophet, and was immediately saddened by the sight he had forgotten would be on the front page.
“So...tell me about America?” He said, trying to distract himself.
A pause, then, “He is well trained... Get up” Draco felt his legs move without him commanding them to. He kept his eyes averted, but he could
“Well, it was pretty much automatic, she knows my father really well, he's always popping in and out of the Ministry ... it'll be interesting to see whether Gryffindor are allowed to keep playing, won't it?” Pansy snorted.
There was a knock at the Draco’s door. Draco flicked his wand at the door, not surprised to see their mothers, “Good morning Mrs Zabini, Good morning Mother,” Draco said, inviting them in them in.
Eventually, Snape seemed to realised Draco could go no further. “Enough”  Snape handed him the potion that would help with the headache. Draco nodded and thankfully took the potion, knowing that meant their lesson was over.
friendship.”
Draco struggled to keep up and soon found that the river of students had several currents- but none of them seemed to move him closer to Potter. He looked around- looking in the corner of his eye trying to find Crabbe and Goyle. It took a minute but he found them, they were just behind him. It had only been a minute, but that had been enough time for him to lose track of Potter. Perhaps the hundreds of students hid him, perhaps he had gone somewhere. But then he realised... the primal urge to
and tortured. He began to question every thought he had ever had about muggle-borns as their screams echoed from the dungeons and into Draco’s dreams. He had been ignorant to call people mudbloods. He realised this, when their blood, which was the same crimson colour as his, covered the robes of death eaters that walked the halls of his house.
I. Did. Not. Expect. This. Fic. To. Be. This. Long.
“What?” Draco said, hurrying to keep up.
And so Draco had learned to read personality types, had learnt to see and manipulate greed and fear in others, while always masking his own interests.
Draco raised his hands in the air as Harry Potter stared at him and, after a second of being gobsmacked, immediately started apologising.
Fuck.
He hated peacocks.
The two E’s stuck out like sore thumbs, and as usual, upon seeing his grades, he wondered what the

It was only after getting up and hitting his boxing bag for ten minutes that his brain could focus enough to see the last two letters which lay unopened on the table.

“If you're wondering what that smell is, Mother, a mudblood just walked in.” It slipped out of him as the emotional blackness began taking over, Draco reinforced the strong walls where his better self remained. It could not be touched.
“Congratulations,” Said Theo, in a Snape-like drawl “You have just awarded mediocrity” -this time he got giggles as a reaction.
She made a ‘hmph’ sound, then after another extended silence seemed to settle on something. “Perhaps… Well- perhaps- I should try it...” The genuine expression on her face surprise Draco. He would never have thought she would want to do anything that resembled exercise apart from her morning walks.
One night whilst the rest of the Slytherins were in the common room he returned to his dormitory and began to pace. He hated that this person who inhabited the school halls and wasn’t him. Sure, it
He wandered from room to room, unable to find him. Eventually, he heard hushed whispers from a door which was slightly ajar.
For a split second they looked into each other's eyes, and as Draco saw the rage in his opponent's eyes, he realised that perhaps duelling with Potter wasn't the best idea. Regardless, he had put himself into the situation- Committing, he decided to go with Densaugeo as it would disfigure Potters perfect teeth and therefore mess up his perfect face. He screamed the spell at the same time that Potter yelled Furnunculus! A pimple inducing hex- Apparently having had the same intention of facial disfigurement.
As they did Draco forced himself to be reasonable. He needed to distance himself from Blaise before something regrettable happened.
Fiendfyre.
“Oh don’t give me that look Draco. Do better.” She snarled as she rebuked him. “For now, not getting hit is a good place to start. It’s good to develop your dodging instincts. But eventually, you will start having to be on the offensive.”
Blaise just looked confused. Draco filled him in.
He and Goyle looked at each other. Goyle looked relieved- but Draco knew that this was only a small reprise. The fighting would not stop as long as Harry Potter was alive.
I must not tell lies
He hurried to catch up with Pansy and the first years. Bethany talked to him all the way back.
A roaring, billowing noise behind him told him that Crabbe had managed to say the incantation correctly.
“Potter.” Draco tried to match the contempt. He resisted the urge to criticize Potter, as he still had the ferret incident hanging over his head, which- he reminded himself- he would get Potter back for. He and Pansy had some wonderful badges coming along.
“How'd the occlumency go?” she looked concerned.
“Merry Christmas Snape,” he said to Snape’s back. Snape was standing in the corner of the room above a cauldron, muttering enchantments. Draco sat and waited for his turn.
“The boy... is he dead?” Voldemort sounded weak. Frightened.
(See the end of the chapter for
Snape took the bottle back as Draco shoved it back at him, glad to be done. He sunk into a seat, placing his head in his hands, emotionally and physically drained.
“How may I help you, Mr Malfoy? Are you here to pick up your order?” Borgin said from behind the counter, his dark eyes scrutinising Draco.
“We are going to Diagon Alley today dear, would you and Blaise like to come?”
He realised he wouldn’t mind that.
He felt well and truly awake. He had gone to sleep at some time around 1 pm the previous day. In fact, he marvelled at how long he had slept, usually these days it was something close to 3 or 4 hours.
“Only to see you Mother” he replied taking his seat. Immediately the napkin rose from the table and settled itself onto his lap.
The fire crackled happily behind them. Draco felt cold.
Then he paused. Mother was still in that hellhole. He pulled the smile off his face, and felt his chest began to tighten, suddenly breathing was difficult. She was alone, with all those fucking deatheat-
Laughing, Draco chased after him, “You fucking cheat!”
“He is Dead!”
Summoned from nowhere, the massive door materialised before the Golden trio, who, with face’s grim- entered. As the door quietly thudded close and shrunk into nothing, Draco almost jumped out of his skin when a beefy hand grabbed him.
As he sat drinking in the corner he noticed a family a couple of tables away. The father was holding his little son and they were laughing as he made faces at him. Draco felt a pang of jealousy as he thought of his own, now distant, father.
“Thank you Draco, this is appreciated. Would you like some tart?”
Thanks! :D
“Draught of Peace, yeah I can see it in the cauldron up front.”
Students were soon streaming past him. Towards the entrance to the room of hidden things... which had apparently had become a hidden exit? The room of hidden things had no exit- it went on for miles.
to have his interest. Fuck Potter. Fuck his
The mudblood, however, ruined it as she stepped between them “No, don’t, honestly, it’s not worth it.”
Shortly thereafter they arrived at the Great Hall. It had been transformed into a winter wonderland and looked...
“Oh. Yeah, right.”
Dumbledore stood up and all the students turned to look at him, and were immediately quiet. Draco remained looking at Potter, who looked very tired and content. Draco couldn't remember the last time he had felt that way. Content. Happy. He sighed to himself and turned to finally pay attention to the headmaster.
“Over here!” Came an American accent, and it took Draco a second to realise it was Blaise calling them. They made their way over to what looked like a pretty uncomfortable Blaise. “Why do you look like you’ve seen a Boggart?” Said Pansy as they walked over.
“You didn’t tell them who I was...back at the Manor-”
do that again! Do you understand?! You not only put your entire family at risk, but you
“Never mind how I know, you stupid boy, only that I have eyes
people in the school Blaise! Never mind our odd Headmaster, this is the woman you should come to have you any troubles…” Umbridge tilted her head at him, smiling.
No. It wasn't a realisation. He snapped himself out of it. It was just a stupid reaction to the actions of Potter. He would find anyone doing this to be incredibly hot. Anyone. Father would not find the image of Draco cheering for Potter in his mind. He would bury it.
He tilted his head, considering it....He
“Yes well, I do maintain my old house pride!” She smiled at them, then sat down in her seat, “It’s good to see such lovely young gentlemen surviving in what is...quite the mess of a school system. Hopefully, my presence here will change that.” Her smile was predatory.
“What” Draco snapped at Theo, scared he had been caught staring. Theo had a disapproving look on his face, which didn’t help with Draco’s fear. He rolled his eyes “I can practically hear the scheming you’re doing.... It’s written all over your face.” Theo broke his disapproving look with a large grin “Don’t you ever get tired of it?”
“Thestrals,” said Hagrid and Draco’s mind was taken back to the night when they had gotten off the Hogwarts express. Theo had mentioned the beasts.
“I don't know either.” Harry's laugh rang throughout the room. Draco suddenly realised that Harry being in his living room was strange.
Madam Malkin suddenly bent toward Malfoy and grabbed his arm, apparently deciding the situation would go away if she ignored it.

again. In came the fear, and the anger, the desperation- but also a warmth he had not realised was gone. The ball began to move into his mind, separating itself from the physical world. He guided it carefully into its box, and breathed a sigh of relief as it settled in.
“I manage it, Zabini” Bellatrix came back into the room, a glass of water in her hand. “By practice. I do not need to think of the spells I need to summon. I just summon them. That is only achieved via
Blaise seemed taken aback by his tone. So Draco slowed down and took a breath, and then in a much gentler tone said “Sorry… Yeah?”
“She has been sober enough when you are here, but when you are at Hogwarts she has been turning to alcohol to control her emotions- and she is prone to lashing out when she is intoxicated…” “Apparently it runs in the family,”  Lucious muttered under his breath as he retrieved a piece of paper from his pocket. Draco’s face heated.
“Im fine Mother, get off me. - I said I’m
He did attack. Again and again and again, until Draco’s back was wet with sweat from the exertion from it. It was a cruel kind of torture as it became more and more difficult to defend his mind as a headache formed.
The mourning boy breathed in and then spoke softly, “I haven’t been doing much thinking at all actually... it’s like- now that I’ve finally stopped having to run around, fighting- it’s all threatening to come in, all the deaths and the reality of it all... so my brain just- pulled the parachute. So now I don’t
He dismissed the hazy memory, full of high pitched screaming. He had been so pathetic.
Eventually, a pale blue steam wafted from the cauldron, leading Snape to exhale and finally join Draco.
He flicked his wand, and the two steaming cups he had just made began to drift over. As they did, Draco once again picked up one of the cut ropes off the bed.
” His Father’s words sounded strange in his mind. Draco saw the replayed images of his father hitting him, again and again, and then saw his mother crawling to him. Draco had never wanted to relive that night again.
didn’t want to know.
As if to prove his point, Draco watched as the Gryffindors stood as one and turned their very angry faces to glare at Pansy and the rest of the Slytherins. Then the Hufflepuffs stood, and almost at the same moment, the Ravenclaws- Draco saw wands emerging everywhere, pulled from under the sleeves and out of the pockets of dressing gowns.
Apparently his Mother took his grunt of exertion as a call to enter, for she opened the door and gave him a flabbergasted look when she saw him hanging from thin air by his hands- one of which curled around her wand.
So Draco did. He was angry but not surprised. This was Lucius Malfoy, the great manipulator, he had a plan for everything, and plenty of minions to execute anything.
He raised his wand and pulled the…
Horrified, Draco watched as the presence in his mind was transforming into a towering mass of darkness. Draco was distantly aware of his body stepping back, interpreting the distress signal Draco was subconsciously sending it-
“I can’t,” Draco gave Borgin a look which rightly inspired some fear in the eyes of the piggish man. “It’s got to stay put. I just need you to tell me how to do it.”
I managed to convince myself that I still loved him, despite his flaws.” Her eyes came back at Draco, her eyes frighteningly intense.
“You alright mate?” Theos voice was soft, unheard by anyone else. Draco tried to put a brave face on. “Im- Im fine”
There was a small silence that was followed by a drawn-out sigh, Slughorn did always like to be dramatic. “I’m here to evacuate you all… Y-You Know Who is coming to attack the school.” A silence, then “Harry Potter is here. He warned us.”
Hopefully you enjoyed!
As they stepped inside, Madame Malkin came to assist them and Draco noticed the same exhausted expression on her face. It wasn’t from over-working, Draco knew that- It was the face of someone burdened under excessive stress. He saw the telltale signs of it every time he looked in the mirror.
It was so intense that he feared he might explode. He shoved it down and bottled it up.
once been, but now Draco was different. He was trapped in his own head, unable to be who he was and it was torture. He had thought coming back to hogwarts would be safe and that he would be able to relax for the first time in months.
forgot about you and your little call.” Draco actively suppressed the shudder Voldemort’s voice caused. “I almost- didn’t care. But I can’t ignore it now. Not after what happened with Arthur Weasley”
Told you more would be up soon. ive just hit over 100,000 words uploaded. Thanks everyone who came back to read it.<
A pause, then “
“No. I- I can’t.” At his sceptical look, Draco apologised “I’m not being dramatic, I would like to… but- I really can’t.”
They reached the library, puffing from the stairs and sank gratefully into the large comfy chairs they always occupied. They practically owned the spot, tucked neatly away in the corner of the library, away from prying eyes and ears. Despite that, Pansy put up the usual privacy charms.
He felt a wand being shoved into his hands. He looked down and was shocked to see his own wand sitting in his hand. The warmth of its return flooded into him- the knowledge that despite it having being stolen from him that it was still
“Draco, dump your stuff. We have to go to the Prefects carriage,” Pansy drew him out of his thoughts which were currently about finding out if the lips were indeed as soft as they looked. He nodded at her and a minute later they were walking towards the Prefects carriage.
Yet Narcissa knew. He needed more. And she had to begin somewhere-- She looked to the sky, as if for help.
” in his hand.
celebrity.”
Each of the store owners were not the same people that Draco remembered. They were all distant, stressed and had large bags under their eyes. Eventually, they finished their shopping, and Draco swallowed as he realised they would now have to go to Borgin and Burkes.
he was cut off as Pansy spoke up, “No, that doesn't explain why the Carrow’s mentioned Ravenclaw tower. If Potter’s just coming to gather troops- why would he go to Ravenclaw tower? Could he have not destroyed the Horcrux yet? Could their library have something on it? I’m pretty sure horcruxes are ridiculously hard to destroy. And I don’t think we should mention this to the Carrows… as Theo made clear, He doesn’t want this information spread about. We can use this to our advantage.”
So this was on the back burner for a bit, I've still been writing, but it's far more fun to write new content then revise old, PluS- I kept missing my upload time and would just be like yeah I'll upload tomorrow but it never happened :((
Of course, Blaise's Mother could use his owl, and send actual letters to Blaise. But his mother had to get up in the middle of the night to sneak Draco letters. Draco had a strong urge to hit something, but his thoughts were interrupted by Weasley who walked by them, talking loudly to Potter and Granger. “She can’t just ban Quidditch, I mean- It’s quidditch!”
He held back, the awkwardness intimidating him, until he realised that she was his
She nodded as he began pulling the robes over his head. “You’re right, Draco-” she glared at the Golden Trio “-Now I know the kind of scum that shops here… We’ll do better at Twilfitt and Tatting’s.”
Just as he had done in the Great Hall, Draco strode in, chin high and back straight.
The boy’s eyes were already closed as his body took the sharp blow from the killing curse. He had curved inwards, and crumpled silently to the ground. She had expected him to fight- he hadn't even raised his wand…
“Did you do the meditations?”
?” Draco frowned, getting annoyed
Draco denied any, he wasn’t hungry in the mornings anymore.
He had always been the more tolerant father figure in Draco’s life… and Draco was fairly sure he knew Draco was gay. Snape taught him everything useful he had ever known and had always made sure he was okay. But Snape acted as a double agent against Dumbledore, he was a pivotal figure in the meetings between the Death Eaters... Snape was on the wrong side.
Acceptable (A)
Draco woke up. No “goodbye”, no “I love you.” Nothing.
She found his heart.
“Goodnight Draco.”
Hope you've enjoyed it so far! I've been really sick with the flu so even getting this up has been hard.
“Welcome to the family” he greeted one girl who looked more frightened than the others. She smiled nervously and stuck out her hand.
And so Draco found himself once again watching Potter. He was training hard but didn't seem to be outwardly affected by the pressure of the third task at all. But Draco knew he was feeling many more things then he let people see. He himself was familiar with outward facades. Potter was a little too stony, a little too quick to laugh at jokes- and when he thought no one was looking he often rubbed his eyes with his hands, signalling tiredness.
Harry Potter had died quickly, for Voldemort had not made his usual show of killing- he was obviously apprehensive of the boy who had continued to evade him time and time again.
Eventually, she led him to a garden bench and softly spoke to him, “I have tried to hide that side of your father from you for so long. But I cannot pretend after what he did to you. I am sorry- I am so sorry I haven’t had this conversation with you sooner, I was just... so ashamed.” At Draco’s expression, she clarified, “Of myself. Not you Draco- never you.”
He needed to hit something, or be hit- or at least breathe some air. Merlin, he needed to
Finally, two days later, Draco received a response from his Mother. It was in her handwriting, but was not written in her usual style. His stomach twisted itself into a rather large not upon that realisation. The writing was far too cold and simply informed him that she was ‘well’. He requested a meeting with her for lunch, hoping that he could see her face to face and have his worries put to rest, only to receive a reply a day later saying she was ‘too busy’ with the guests in her home. Draco knew then, with no doubts, that she was not writing the letters, or was being forced to.
“Are you the Malfoy boy?” Draco turned to find the owner of the hand was also the owner of an unknown face- most of which was covered by a large and heavy hood. But from what Draco could see, it was hairy and sported quite a few scars.
“Yes, but-”
“Don’ worry, it won’ hurt yeh.” The oaf had a toothy grin sticking out of his bushy bead. But Draco could see nothing to smile at. He shuddered.
“Come back here-- you long-legged bastard!” Blaise yelled as Draco pulled ahead.
. I was wrong. I was so stupid. But I was also too late,
Then- three more minutes passed.
He breathed in the fresh air surrounding him and let a little of the constant tension go. It was difficult, as all he could think of was his mother, yet he knew he had to do it to survive. He couldn’t afford to punch any holes in any walls to release his rage, especially if they were the stone walls that the castle happened to be made of. Nor could he throw vases or photos across rooms. Or scream, or cry, or breakdown… no one could see him like that. He had to learn how to control his emotions in case he blew up and caused more trouble than he could handle.
That had
Draco nodded, amused, “Regardless, I can survive a few weeks alone. Merlin knows I’m used to it in the Manor.”
“You will need strength in the coming months.” Lucious was still eating calmly “Something is coming” His father's words were too similar to Snape's. A pang of worry appeared in Draco’s chest. He ignored it and continued to build his walls. He had almost finished when-
“Possibly,” said Borgin, his eyes lighting up with greed. “I’ll need to see it, though. Why don’t you bring it into the shop?”
been a foot.
“How have your holidays been?” She asked.
Potter would not go to him. He wasn’t that stupid.
He could see a lot of himself in the other boy.
Narcissa Black, for that was what she thought of herself now, was frightened. Her entire world was wrong. Draco was not with her.
“Fine” Draco resorted to his usual response.
“He killed every person working there.”
He now stayed away from their part of the gardens.
He pressed his quill to the paper.
to think. But I think I’ve started to come down.”
He was well into his breakfast and was chatting happily with Crabbe and Goyle about quidditch when he spotted his father’s owl swoop in, which he could recognise due to its signature grey shine. Draco’s stomach dropped, his father had never sent him an owl before, not at Hogwarts. What was so important that his father would send his own owl? Had he discovered that Mother had sent an owl?
Eyes alight with the thrill of the hunt, Crabbe whipped his wand at the fifty-foot mountain of old furniture, broken trunks, old books, robes and unidentifiable junk, and shouted, “Descendo!”
“Bow, boys” Draco felt his legs bend as they succumbed to the Dark Lord’s magic His knees hit the ground, hard. He winced and bowed his head. Blaise had also been forced to kneel beside Draco.
Tumblr; satan-incarnated
Draco waited a minute for the medication to take effect- sighing as it did- and then left the room. Only to almost scream in fright as he came face to face with his mother.
Yo, this one contains the scene where Hermione gets tortured by Bellatrix- ie "mudblood" on the arm... its not too detailed but if you're not down for that then Ill put a summary at the bottom. Love yo faces.
Draco continued. “He was even angrier than when Potter escaped…” Draco was suddenly caught in the blood that had covered the manor floor after Potter had escaped…
-...anyway- I am… I am going to let you back in. But you have to-...
Draco began counting off how he was doing in all of his subjects- very well in all of them, “In Charms, Ancient Runes and Transfiguration I’m second-”
Borgin shook his head, trying to recover himself “There will be no need for…” His voice had grown considerably higher.
Thought I'd put out a bit of a longer chapter this time, as the last few were short and a little heavy.
“Learning to block out unwanted foes will be a more important skill if you are to survive coming months, and you must focus on clearing your mind.” Snape said finally looking up and giving Draco critical eye. Before he could look down, Draco asked the question he knew wouldn't get an answer to.
“Shut up, Malfoy,” said Granger sharply.
Draco looked down “She’s fine.”
He could see the appeal that was there for other guys- the good bone structure, perfect skin, the wicked smile and playful eyes she taunted you with...but- Draco had never felt anything other than a brotherly love for the girl, and he had come to realise that he never would.
His already racing heart felt as if it would stop. He was confused. The first time the Dark Lord had entered his mind he had been weak, it made sense to be small. But now he was back to full power. It didn’t make sense for him to still maintain the small size. In front of him, the Dark Lord smiled, chilling Draco’s blood. “Ah, you have noticed me. Very good.” Voldemort rose, towering above Draco- and with him, the presence inside Draco’s mind began to grow.  “I could tear these down, so...carefully built. They are strong, no doubt- to anyone who was reasonably skilled at occlumency they would pose a challenge. But to me…” The Dark Lord trailed off.
Draco moved past him to inspect the package that Borgin had fetched for him and placed on the table beside them- the Opal necklace. It had been expensive, but would be required if Draco could not fix the cabinet.
She patted around his body searching for his wand.
Sorry Its been so long, next chapter will take way less time!
He shook his head as he heard Harry scream “Aguamenti!” ...a little water would do nothing against Hell’s own fire. It required a complex counter-charm that Draco had never thought he’d need to learn.
It took a second, but Draco did laugh this time, but it was a humorless, sad sound. He raised his sleeve where his dark tattoo stood out against the pale skin. “I’m not so sure,” He looked to see Harry staring at it, his face had paled. Draco hated the fucking thing, and now that Voldemort was dead and it hadn’t gone...he knew he would have it forever- a constant reminder of his cowardice.
Snape came through his office door, looking very dishevelled and in all black pyjamas with a black robe and black slippers.
Draco felt something stir in him. Anger, fear, disbelief... and shame. How could he have been so
“A drink for the teachers and guests above seventeen to drink at the ball” Without looking, Snape slid a fist-sized box across the table. Draco had none of Snape’s careful reserves and ripped the wrapping off. Snape raised an eyebrow to his grin.
“Augh!” He rubbed his head, grinning and not missing Snape’s small smirk.
Draco let the anger and jealousy consume him, tired of trying to always suppress and control it, tired of the yearning which lurked underneath, a yearning which could never be realised. He let it burn through him, and was so caught in the high of the emotion, of the pain which was being crushed by the pure anger- that he almost didn’t feel it...
“No-” Hissed Crabbe “You never told us how! Remember?!”
Draco and Blaise finished their potions quickly- Blaise's colour and scent were slightly off, causing Snape to inform him it might; “Let someone have a peaceful 3-hour
Draco leaned against a wall behind him, crossing his arms and daring himself to enjoy the moment. It was better than the seriousness that had just been heavy in the air around them. “And muggles jump out of them?” Harry nodded, “Why?”
Draco looked down to find a small bottle, full of golden liquid, nestled in the box.
He was looking out the window as Draco entered, which was good because that meant he didn’t see Draco go red.
Armed with a large gulp of the Felix Felicis that had taken days to be delivered to him- (thanks to no owl allowing Greyback to go near it until he thought to paralyse one) Draco walked into the Room of Hidden Things.
All student organisations, societies, teams, groups and clubs are henceforth disbanded.’
The owner of the voice came around the corner, wand out.
He was about to call that out when he realised Granger had already beaten him to it- her hand was stuck up in that stupid way of hers, like she was bursting with the answer. Draco, hating himself, took the opportunity to make fun of her. He imitated her- much to Pansy’s delight whos laugh turned into a scream when she noticed the Bowtruckles. The little creatures had jumped at the noise of her scream.
“For now I guess…” Draco kicked at some rubble beside his old desk. This was all so
“I’ll see you at breakfast,” Draco said and went into his room, smiling to himself.
Draco felt and
they were difficult to train. Draco felt fear lash through him. The last creature that had been
“Harry?” the yell from the other aisle came again. “What’s going on?”
Hello!!
History of Magic: O
“Professor Slughorn!” He could hear the strain in her voice.
“How are you going?” Blaise removed his knee from Draco’s and stood up, Draco missed the comfortable contact. Blaise made up for it when he stuck out his hand to help Draco up. Draco knew it was wrong but took it anyway.
Madame Pomfrey rushed in, but he sent her away, claiming truthfully that he had suffered from a nightmare.
“Nice to see you too,” he said to Theo before trudging towards the stairs towards his dormitory to dispose of his suitcase.
After dragging himself out of his hot shower he found Blaise already waiting for him, reading a book, their breakfast sitting on the small table at the end of Draco’s bed.
He blinked at her, “Sorry, what?”
What they didn't know, was that one of the dirty,
As they walked into the basement, Draco fought the urge to vomit.
He had begun to slowly drift from his childhood best friend as she nattered on about how disgusting muggles were and how good it was that their fathers were back in their old positions. He reminded himself that only a year ago he would have ignorantly agreed with all of this too. Pansy was just spewing out words her mother and father had taught her, but that didn’t mean he could forgive her for it.
The awkwardness and unspoken questions hung in the hair, tangible. He needed to do it.
As Goyle wrenched his trunk from the rack, Draco heard a thud and a sharp intake of breath.
And with that, they left, and as he passed by Weasley, the redhead smashed his shoulder into Draco, but Draco barely felt it, as his mind was currently at war with itself.
“Mum, what did you think when father found the memory of Cassius?” It tumbled out- but once he had said it Draco felt as if he could finally breathe.
He felt his mind crumbled to panic and shock-
The smell of her perfume wasn't there. He frowned. She grasped his back weakly, seeming to need the contact, “How are you?” Draco asked, head still in her hair.
Bored, he went back to picking at his nails.
“I don’t want to, there are far better things to do”
Their hands connected and Draco knew that his weight combined with Goyles would not be able to be lifted. Their sweaty hands slipped out of each other’s and Draco whimpered.
“Why?”
“Very good Mr Nott, ten points to Slytherin! And you Mr Malfoy?”
“The Slytherin quidditch team will be approved for training and playing, won’t it?” He deliberately made it sound more like an order than a question. Umbridge and Draco stared at each other, each with a fake smile on their face, two wolves having a fucking pissing contest.
“What does it look like?” Draco couldn't keep the bitter tones from his voice. “He lost his shit again”
And then Draco was running.
He thinned his lips, but forced himself to nod.
From the way she said it, Draco knew she wanted to talk. He could not bear another awkward experience like Hogsmeade, yet he knew he had to get the questions off his chest or he would go mad. So he decided to take the opportunity to talk, as they had often walked together in the gardens when he was a child, and Draco had always run ahead to pick his mother flowers. It would be a good place to ask the questions.
Draco rubbed at his still wet hair with his towel and picked up the newspaper. Same old boring headlines.
The usual words and excuses rattled around in his head as he walked quietly in front of them;
“Blaise! Let's go.”
Draco felt like he was floating as he made his way to the common room- but not in a good way. He felt disconnected, disorientated. He only found his way back because he had walked the path so many times.
I also just want to thank all you commenters for your continued support! It always makes my day to see you guys freaking out and letting me know what you liked! No matter if you just say Great Chapter! it's always better to say something to let me know you're still here (This is the best compliment of all) then saying nothing for fear of nothing interesting to say... I love you all, I love doing this, I promise to finish this dumb story which won't leave my head alone!
well, it’s the only explanation... He might have gone through your father’s connection...They would have had to have been already in communication before you called him. Which is likely enough... It’s a very stable way to communicate.” Snape frowned then turned to Draco.
why am I talking to you- you're not even
“Give and take points?” Draco could hear the shock in Blaise’s voice. Draco himself was shocked- Even prefects couldn’t do that.
At the price of Crabbe's life.
A second later the card was added to was added to the others on Snape's desk.
She tensed in his arms and he was horrified to discover how much weight she had lost since he had hugged her last. He supposed he had just gotten used to her sunken face.

Three minutes until the hour was up.

Is everything making sense? Im scared the writing quality has gone down in my rush to get chapters out :l
“Oh, they were privately expressed of course. You do know that Father has the minister’s ear.” He didn’t even try to veil the warning in his voice.
The next hour was absolute hell.
Two hours later, Draco, Pansy and Blaise were walking down towards Hogsmeade. Draco walking between them. Pansy, as usual, was nattering away about some gossip magazine’s newest drama. Draco managed to make eye contact with Blaise, they both rolled their eyes and grinned. Draco silently cursing at how good Blaise looked when he grinned. They made their way into The Three Broomsticks where Crabbe, Goyle and Theo, who was looking uncomfortable in the presence of the bigger boys- waited inside with Butter beers. They all chatted for a while before Draco excused himself with the reason of needing to buy some new gloves for quidditch, as his older ones from didn’t fit anymore and the weather was getting colder. Blaise realised he needed some broom polish and decided to come along.
Deciding that being above ground might make him feel better, he took his Charms homework and went up to the library enjoying the bright sunlight streaming through the windows and the warmth that came with it. As he was getting settled at his table he saw the newly reunited Golden Trio walking by. Ever since the display Potter had put on for the first task, Weasley was no longer ignoring Potter. Draco scoffed,
couldn't break from that. And even if they could, he couldn’t give them the time to change.  He wasn’t on their side anymore. He had to act
“Oh very funny, really witty” Granger’s voice called out. Some giggles followed her remark. Bitch. Draco felt his own face heat as he turned to the Mudblood.
He looked at the clock which hung above the door to Pomfrey's office. ‘3.27’ He looked to the windows, noting it was dark. So it wasn’t 3.27 in the afternoon.
“Well if you’d like to make an
Draco pushed forward to the front of the crowd, barely noticing as the fighters of Hogwarts began to trickle out the doors in front of them. He reached Hagrid’s side just as the Death Eater progression stopped. Voldemort was right in front of him, but Draco knew he could not succumb to the fear. He owed Harry Potter his life.
It was ruined as the broom suddenly pitched downwards. Draco opened his eyes to see Potter reaching out a hand towards the flames. Reaching for something as he had reached for Draco not long ago.
In no time he was sitting down on the uncomfortable piano stool ready to begin. He opened the book, only to be surprised to find the loose pages of a song that had not been there before. With it came a note.
that you hide behind! I see your conversations! I see everything!” Draco felt invisible hands wrap around his neck, and begin to lift him off the ground. He was choking silently. Mother screamed. “Lucius, no! He is your so-” With a flick of his wand, Father sent her flying backwards into the wall behind her, a sickening thump making Draco’s stomach drop in panic. Lucius turned to her, a deranged look upon his face, “Don’t you dare defend him! He brings shame to the Malfoy name- you stupid woman!” Father's attention on Mother broke the lifting curse on Draco. His petrified body fell to the ground, meaning he hit his hip on the dining chair along the way. He sucked in a sharp breath through his nose, as his mouth wouldn't open. He began to panic as he saw his father grasping his mother's throat- with real hands this time. Draco went to scream, but it got caught in his tightly sealed mouth. He was powerless and could do nothing. Tears began to leak from his eyes, blurring his vision. His heart thundered in his chest- he was panicking.
“Oh come on Ron, Dittany is actually quite interesting. If you look at the specifics of its brewing method…”
“Draco,” he said, tightly gripping Draco's arm, “What are you doing down here?”
He spent the rest of the time walking, and taking in the environment surrounding him, noticing how at peace he felt walking among nature. The lake, forest, mountains and sky all seemed bigger than him and somehow that made him and his problems seem small. Their pristine qualities seemed to help cleanse his tight lungs and calm his ever-busy brain. Eventually, he finished the circuit and regretfully returned to reality. He walked back to the castle, wanting to drag his feet like a child.
“I really don’t think you should be-”
, watching as the blood slowly got sucked into nothingness. He then washed his face, gripped the side of the basing and breathed deeply.
While Crabbe and Goyle…
else.
With a few waves of his wand and a new set of clothes, he looked close enough to the part and with another groan he set off for his father’s office.
A waitress walked up to them, a quick quotes quill and a notepad hanging in the air beside her.
He dusted off his hands and straightened his robes, and resisted rolling his eyes as his Mother gave him a look.
His dark thoughts were interrupted when he saw Snape, striding down the table handing out timetables. When he reached Draco he paused and retrieved a note from his pocket which he added to the timetable. Snape nodded at Draco, Draco nodded back.

One could only endure so much cruelty, stress, worry, anger and despair before they began to turn into somebody that they wouldn’t have liked in better times. And Draco’s better self wasn’t around anymore. He had long shoved the part of him the was sympathetic into a small corner- into the same place he buried his memories. He kept it there for it’s own protection, and for

“Yes, I do understand how that may not be beneficial to one’s mental state. Is that all that has been causing you to be distant?”
“Yes, and it’s wonderful to have her back. It was... difficult at first, but she is slowly regaining her own mind once again. Come, Bella will want to meet you.” She led him into the antechamber and through to the sitting room.
It was only after he was bandaged up and was trying to sleep that Draco’s brain fought through the shock and realised his father hasn't made a comment on the memory of him cheering for Harry at the first task, nor had he seen the memory of Harry calling him disgusting and Draco's reaction to it...or the memory of him dancing with Draco in his dreams. He had not heard Draco’s traitorous words which he had spoken to his Mother just that afternoon. Draco had buried those ones well enough not to be found.
Draco sprung up from the bench, and stepped over it.
They began to walk to the gryffindor carriage, Draco remembering last minute that he usually sauntered. He completed the look by once again put a smirk on his face as they entered the carriage. He found himself looking to Harry’s face which was just as tired looking as in the papers, and then to his lips, wandering if they too were as soft as they looked.

“Actually I am. Please go away”
This change had come about after an article by Rita Skeeter had been published in Witch Weekly, labelling Potter as ‘Harry Potter...The curious or confused? That had created its own storm, and then, and barely two weeks later- Potter’s name had come out of the Triwizard cup, and the school had labelled him as an attention-seeking brat. He now walked around with his head down, barely speaking to anyone while the Mudblood desperately attempted to hold him and Weasley together. It was a rather amusing display of pure patheticness. Draco, however, didn't buy the rumors that surrounded Potter. Why would he come out as bisexual and then give everyone a reason to hate him a few weeks later? It didn't make sense. Potter was stupid, but not that stupid. An adoring fan from the older years had probably put the name in the cup, wanting to see their Golden Boy achieve more success… Draco caught himself staring and stopped before Potter caught him.
I never planned this part to be this long, however I dont have many regrets. Half the plot points I came up with along the way- the main idea, that of anxiety and depression coming to life through magic (if that metaphore wasn't obvious I dont know what I did wrong ahahah) -that of the mental obscurus- wasn't in my original concept of the plot.

Pansy’s second piece came to a close. She looked at him, ready for the duet that was next. He shook his head, signalling he wanted to play something else. She nodded and stepped away.
...to find his OWL results- something he had
He walked down to the common room to find Pansy, Crabbe and Goyle waiting for him.
It was the solution he had been looking for for months. Upon reaching what now seemed like the steepest hill he had ever encountered, he forced himself to keep running, his heart pounding and mind racing.
She smiled at him. “Of course.”
Minutes later they were running in comfortable silence and Draco discovered the benefits of running with a partner. He pushed himself, a subconscious part of him wanting to impress Blaise. Sure, it made his lungs and legs burn… but it was fun. Towards the end, they both began to sprint, wanting to beat each other.
His curse rang throughout the gardens.

Yet he accepted it.

He heard a rustling of cloth as Snape walked over and placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. Draco flinched away before half relaxing and letting the warm contact stay.
“Perhaps you’d like to take it now?” Borgin was still quite pale.
Much Love!
Blaise bought him out of his pleasant thoughts with a deadpan tone “Your dad sounds like a dick. I can’t wait to meet him”
Draco froze "What the
He had chosen to give the wand to Harry, and the wand- ever so loyal to him, had respected his wishes. It had changed it’s allegiance. It was now totally under Harry’s control.
He was a quarter way through the essay on
He snorted as he spotted the redhead who looked ridiculous with ancient looking dress robes, and was looking at Krum with murder in his eyes.
“Have you ever heard of punching bags?”
The room sunk into a chilling silence again. Draco felt his body growing colder at the thought of the man- if he could even be called a man anymore- who had caused so much death and destruction. Who had changed every aspect of Draco’s life. Who- until now, had been… invincible.
Both of them had lost their wands in the room of hidden things, and so were powerless to defend themselves from all the dangers a battle bought.
He was silent, not knowing what to say. Eventually he settled on, “Well- now you know.”
He watched as Harry smiled, and something warmed in him.
He pushed it open, knowing he was triggering the wards that would wake Snape up.

And so Draco was forced to listen as his father went on. “You think to hide from me? You are my son! I see you, and I see the little
...And he had to be there. Just in case.
He smothered it.
Draco sneered and was tempted to curse Crabbe, but Weasley distracted him.
And suddenly, Draco’s mind rushed. Greyback would only be trying to tempt Draco with information if it was something that had been kept hidden from him. A secret Blaise knew and he didn’t, something Blaise didn’t want him to know... Draco closed his eyes. It was something that
His hair was a mess, his clothes were rumpled and his eyes were hollow and bloodshot.
He decided to focus on his upcoming exams and 15th birthday instead, wondering what Pansy had gotten for him. As he found out a few days later, she had organised a lunch for her, Crabbe, Goyle, Theo and Draco at his favourite restaurant in Hogsmeade. It was a lovely day full of laughter and good food, and Draco relished the opportunity to escape from his reality for a while. Afterwards, he found Snape's present on his bed, which was a Draught of Peace potion along with the note “
Draco had just made it in when he was roughly grabbed by Crabbe and pushed onto the wall beside the door.

“Yes, I do quite agree, and I hope you can make the difference that all of us students here truly need.” He said, smiling back. He glanced at the clock on the wall. Breakfast had finished, the other students would be here soon.
-” He took a large bite scrambled eggs, making the rest of his words barely intelligible “-You can bet your ass its my business.”
More than once he considered ending it all, but knew it would crush his mother, and he could not stand to hurt her.
He stood awkwardly in the empty hallway and after a second heard it echoing with the tones of Pansy’s Prefect voice. “Everybody- piss off.” The hallway filled with the sound of chairs scraping and footsteps. Within fifteen seconds Pansy came back to fetch him.
Hours later he stopped playing. He had figured out the first couple of pages, could play them flawlessly, and he felt better. Pansy had long ago left to go get ready for the Yule ball so Draco played a couple of games of exploding snap with Crabbe and Goyle- and cursed when he remembered he had forgotten to give Snape his gift.
Draco knew Snape would want a full fill in on his situation, in a place not filled with Death Eaters, unwanted ears and occasionally the Dark Lord. He sighed, not looking forward reliving his memories of the holidays and glanced at his timetable.
“Is that what made you change? When they made you…”
It all was too much.
Finally, when Draco was finished picking his eighth nail and was onto his ninth, Father spoke.
“Malfoy.” The hatred in his eyes and tone was obvious.
, who had a reason to be
Draco conjured a protego, anticipating the oncoming curse- only to be thrown off his feet, along with Blaise, as Bellatrix growled and stalked over to them. They were both still on the floor.
“Harry?” Crabbe mimicked Weasley’s shout. “What’s going- No, Potter! Crucio!”
Luna began sobbing “Please, no- you can’t-”
Then Draco spotted her over Pansy’s shoulder.
As if summoned by thought, he heard Crabbe's horse whisper in his ear.
Out of the corner of his eye he saw Potter pull out his wand, so he reached for his own. Snape would be there any second, but that didn’t stop him.
The horn for the Diggory and Potter rang out, and Draco grimaced as the crowd grew even louder, screaming their adoration for the Hogwarts champions. Potter and Diggory both hesitantly entered the maze, their faces both pale and their wands out. Shortly after Krum and the French one entered too. Draco sighed- now they just got to watch the wall of the maze and wait for the winner to be announced. He was only here because Pansy had dragged him down saying she “Wanted to see Victor!” Draco sighed again. He got out his transfiguration homework.
The words triggered the memory of the night Father had beaten Draco and his Mother.
“I think I’ve buried what I needed well enough, but I'll need to make some memories with you to cover them.”
That gave Harry pause, “Well- for fun I guess. Like the adrenaline that they get from falling from the sky- people enjoy that.”
“Crabbe,” said Draco, “That is not the best insult, considering

Draco laughed as Blaise scrambled back up, cursing Draco.
“You ready?” He asked, smiling at her face which contained barely restrained excitement. She nodded.

The headache hit him hard.
“Draco? What on earth are-”
Snape stopped speaking, and a very concerned look came onto his face. After a period of silence, he spoke.“I assume we are talking about the Dark Lord?”
After her speech was finished, the students were finally dismissed and just before Draco could make his way to bed, he found he had the unwanted task of showing the first years to their dorm.

No loud bangs or shouts as there had been before. It was very unlikely that Voldemort would be late...and yet another minute passed.
“Enter.” The call came from the inside of Snape’s office, and Draco was already pushing the heavy door open. It had only been a couple of months since he had entered the musty room which was filled with bottles of strange looking things and the jars of stranger looking things, but it felt like it had been so much longer.
“It didn’t go away now that he's dead?” Draco just raised his eyebrows, and Potter’s face reddened as he realised the stupidity of his question. Draco felt his face redden slightly in response as the pure oddity of the situation hit him- then something in him panicked and he resorted to old ways.
He sighed and tried not to think about Luna as he continued to read the text Snape had set him for arithmancy. He glanced out the window in front of his desk and then frowned when a white peacock came into his view. It trotted across the grounds- so
“Felix Felicis, otherwise known as-”
Draco relented “Not really. It means I have to have dinner with Father.”
“Not anymore,” said Harry, waving the wand in a teasing way, but slightly louder than he needed to. The panic was clear on his face. “Winners, keepers, Malfoy. Who’s lent you theirs?”
He groaned and pulled himself up, wandering over to the mirror to make sure he looked presentable.
They strode past some windows, the air was fresh and the view was nice. He had missed this dumb castle.
“Hello Professor,” He said in his charming tones as he strode up to her.
He did not know why a foot had appeared from nowhere- but he knew that it had been a foot.

“I see that being Dumbledore’s favourite has given you a false sense of security, Harry Potter. But Dumbledore won’t always be there to protect you.” His Mother was handling the situation well, so Draco took the opportunity to stay back and try to get a grip on the anger in his head.

Crabbe’s smile widened and he took a breath, probably to spit cruel words at Draco, but Goyle interjected before he could. "Our fathers made us." The words were quiet. Honest. Crabbe froze, "Because your father made them. We lied to them best we could, covered up your thing with Blaise once Pansy figured it out, but your dad's fucking ruthless."

He had figured this would be the safest explanation, to pretend that he was fearful of anyone finding out he used pain to cope with his emotions.

Draco frowned, not wanting to ruin the moment but... “Sorry, but- what’s a parachute?”
Voldemort did not stop speaking, “The battle is won. You have lost half of your fighters. My Death Eaters outnumber you and the Boy Who Lived is finished.”
There was silence, and then something Draco never thought he would ever hear come from the stony professor was softly spoken, “I’m sorry Draco.”
“Augh!” He cried out and buried his head under a pillow.
shoulder. “I expect Potter will be reunited with dear Sirius before I am reunited with Lucius.”
Everyone in the room was silent. And Theo was in his element.
Potter growled “How's this any of your business? And besides, your supposed friends have left you as soon as the holidays started,” Potter stepped in closer “there's some true friendship right there.” Potter had gotten right into his face. Draco didn't feel like he could breathe properly. He managed to force a quiet “Fuck you Potter” out of his mouth.
Draco took the largest breath of him life. He opened his eyes and found himself on the floor. He did not remember getting there. “Leave now, boy. You are too young for the table” The Dark Lord left the room. Draco pulled himself off the ground and with Pansy’s help went back to his rooms. He couldn't believe he had succeeded in hiding the memories. He had managed to fool the
His Father held up a hand to silence him, and then advanced on him, a look in his eyes. “I feel the need to remind you to never...
Draco returned to his rooms, slamming the door when he got there and continuing to pack for Hogwarts. He was looking forward to finally leaving this place. He as he was packing he caught sight of the prophet which was still on the floor from where he had thrown it that morning. Potter stared back at him. Draco paused, and stared at the boy that was so similar to him as a thought came to him.
Soon enough, dessert was served and he decided not to have any, claiming a foul stomach- which was partly true. As everyone ate and talked around him, his eyes wandered. In seconds he found Potter, whose messy hair made him easy to spot. He was laughing with his friends and was munching down treacle tart, which was his favourite dessert.
Draco. You are my son and I will love you no matter what you do and I will always love who you love.”
The rest of the day went slowly as Draco was already ahead in most of his classes- all the lessons were incredibly boring. Ten minutes into charms he decided to start on his Potions essay as it gave him an excuse to ignore Crabbe and Goyle who were sitting to one side of him, making an absolute mess of the summoning charm they were learning. Theo saw Draco studying, nodded and pulled out his own books only to be hit by a pillow that Flitwick had them practising on. He swore as Draco began putting a shield charm up around them.
Draco froze.
She noticed him looking, smiled, and came and kissed him on the cheek. Draco took her hand and kissed it, ignoring the awkward feeling- He had long gotten used to it.
He scrambled off the floor and pointed his wand at his father, “
There was the sound of crunching footsteps as somebody approached the building. Draco breathed in deeply and put his mind back into the duelling state. Just before the stranger reached the door they heard a call “Just me, Mistress”
He sighed, looked around at the silent common room, empty due to the holidays. He missed his friends.
“Are we safe?” Goyle's voice was quiet and had lost all character. They both were thinking of Crabbe.
Pansy sighed, then rushed over and hugged him. “Are you okay...truly?” Her whisper was close to his ear and full of worry.
“What happened Draco?” Snape said softly.
And I am way hotter than you.” Pansy huffed and continued on. “Such a tragedy… anyway, we’re nearly there- game face on.”
Draco inwardly cursed as he remembered he had forgotten to look up the animal. He had forgotten to show Blaise around too. Perhaps he needed to invest in a remembrall.
Harry’s hand inched up a small distance, barely noticeable, and secured the wand.
Do you understand me?”
Pansy, Theo, Crabbe and Goyle kept close to him, and while he could not express it to them, he was eternally grateful.  He did not go home for the Easter holidays, fearing what he might find there, so he just lost himself in his study.
“Fuck off Blaise” He turned over trying to escape the headache. A second later bright sunlight blinded him and sent a searing pain through his head.
detention, maybe banned from a game. Not a
I know I said I hadn't written too much on this new Draco... but... I wanted to show the deteriorating of his relationships and include some things critical to the story later. Ah! Sorry!
“What did you get me for Christmas?” Blaise puffed as they ran.
He screamed and grabbed the closest thing to him, an ancient vase, and threw it across the room. With the force of both his arm and uncontrolled magic behind the throw, it exploded upon impact, and thousands of pieces flung across the room. A piece hit Draco's cheek.
Theo didn’t even try to deny it. “Yuuup”
Draco didn’t think that one would hurt Harry too much, as he had said worse things with no reaction, but was then surprised by a large figure who materialised from the crowd.
Draco walked into the main common room and suppressed a gasp. He had never been at Hogwarts around Christmas and was surprised by the overnight transformation the house elves had given the room.
"What do you think you're playing at,
I’m sure I-”
As Potter walked out, swinging his bag over his shoulder, Draco found himself watching him and once again slipping his eyes down to watch his rear end as he walked out of the classroom.
Please feel free to leave comments (constructive only) on what I could have done better- for example- I believe Snape and Draco's relationship was really important to his character development and I should have explored it way more. Or, "Your portrayal of x was great!" Hows my combat? Hows my intense physical stuff?
what this joke of a school needs... You do know how involved with my peers and my own education he is.” Umbridge nodded. The mentioning of his father had caught her attention.
Blaise chuckled and got up. “Cmon, dragon boy, I’m getting cold. Shall we race?”
“No, no, no,” Hagrid waved a dismissive hand, whilst a low grumble that Draco assumed was a laugh came from the half giant “tha’s jus’ superstition, that is, they aren’ unlucky, they’re dead clever, an’ useful! ’Course, this lot don’ get a lot o’ work, it’s mainly jus’ pullin’ the school carriages unless Dumbledore’s takin’ a long journey an’ don’ want ter Apparate — an’ here’s another couple, look —”
“So this is your son,” Voldemort. “Look at me”
He felt broken at the prospect.
Draco snorted. He would know, as he currently lived in that truth.
Draco looked up to find the small house elf which clutched the stack of parchment in its hand. He nodded and gestured to his table.
He was no longer enjoying the moment. His stomach reached for his throat as they hurtled towards certain death.
He stood there, not believing his ears. And he knew.
say or do anything that could compromise our family’s position in the Dark Lords mind.” He gripped Draco’s shoulder, Draco now recognised the look as a vicious anger, cold and under a facade of deathly calm. “Do not do anything stupid, such as getting drunk and saying
Chest heaving, he stopped and immediately darted to the side he spotted the procession coming out of the forbidden forest. His eyes found Voldemort, who was looking ever so vile and
“What were you making?” Draco asked as Snape slowly unwrapped his gift, being careful not to tear the wrapping.
“So." Theo broke the long silence, his voice quiet, “Potter stole something that was incredibly valuable to him. Valuable enough to make him kill loads of useful people and to look scared. What could it have been?”
He changed the subject, not liking the fear on Blaise’s face “You want to go for a run? The gardens will be nice.” Draco hoped a run would calm Blaise down a bit. Merlin knew it would help Draco clear his head...He did not like that his aunt was home.
“No- I didn’t have sex with her! Ever!” He hadn’t meant to yell.
“Blaise, hello dear, and Draco- my darling,” Draco’s mother looked considerably better now that Draco was home and she had befriended Anna, Blaise's mother- who carried the Italian Zambini name. The woman was drop-dead gorgeous and was a known widower. She had given Blaise his angular features and his eyes,
kill you.” He stood and walked out of the room. Draco let out a sob.
She stood up and walked over to him, her movements graceful and confident. Draco felt a shiver run through him, his hairs raised. He was on edge.
Draco had missed being on his broom and raced around the pitch while Montague gave orders to everyone. As no one else was going for seeker he didn't really have to be there, his position was guaranteed- but he knew it would be good to turn up in support of the team.
(See the end of the chapter for
He shrugged, deciding it wasn’t worth it, then reached for his wand and flicked it, settling into his cloak as it wrapped itself around him. One more flick and his slippers were on his feet, and he was ready. He snuck out of the hospital wing, flinching at every creak and noise he made.
Her little eyes were scheming. Draco smiled and nodded,
It had taken weeks of work, but he had done it.
It was beating rather quickly.
do that again. And if you ever lie to me again, I will know.” Seemingly satisfied with his lesson, Lucius let go of his neck. Draco collapsed to the floor, gasping for breath. He could hear his mother whimpering and sobbing. Lucius squatted down, and laid a hand on Draco’s shoulder, his voice had softened “You are my son, I only want what is best for you” Draco was silent, tears coursing down his face “I love you very much, my son. But sometimes...you make me so
“Was it difficult Draco?” She asked him back, at a similar volume.
“They’re all gone- and we locked them in their rooms,” She gave him a wicked smile again. He smiled weakly back then pushed past her into the common room.
He turned to his mother who had come to stand beside him. “How are you going?”
Eventually they returned and Draco retired to his rooms. He didn't want to come across his father, the fucking monster. He loved his mother more than anything. He started to pace, wondering how he could get them out of this mess. Nothing came to mind. Hitting Draco was one thing, but his
“I thought you couldn't see them?” Blaise was looking at him oddly.
It was a bright, cloudless morning and he was stretching- about to begin his daily run around the lake when Blaise jogged up “Can I come? ...If you don’t want me to I can run somewhere else.” Blaise looked hopeful, Draco couldn’t turn him down.
street?! Just don’t sell it.”
“He looks like a fool doesn't he.” Theo gestured “Bloody Weasleys...they make it so easy to make fun of them! Why... would you dress like that?! I wouldn’t turn up.” He laughed and held out a punch cup to Draco. “Want some?” Draco took the cup from him only to nearly spat out the drink upon sipping it.
He had seen similar things in textbooks… this
“What?” Potter was aggressive. That made it easier to hate him- and to taunt him.
"Your Diss-lousion charm wore off!" it had been the rough pull of Crabbe.
versions of Crabbe and Goyle. He wouldn’t have known they were there unless he was looking for them. He shrunk back to stand beside them. To wait.
shutting down the school to put it on high alert within ten minutes or so. After the meeting I overheard the Carrows arguing about
“Your defence is strong but still has cracks in it. You will need to make sure the foundation is stronger before you build upon it.” This was Draco’s only warning before Snape slipped through one of the forsaid cracks and was in Draco’s mind. Draco immediately tried to clear his mind. But he knew he was not successful as he felt Snape digging through memories, an unmatched force in his mind. Draco began to muster his strength for a counterattack. Snape stopped at the memory of Pansy and Draco making badges.
Draco breathed out, the hardest part of coming home over, and was surprised to find himself alone. He decided to find Blaise, perhaps he would want to go for a run. It was spring after all, and the gardens would be looking beautiful.
“N-no it’s alright I guess” Draco realised he did want Harry there, here they weren't enemies, just two guys, in a room. What?
She felt her whole body tense. This is how she would get back to him then.
She was wearing various shades of bright pink and looked even worse than she did in the papers.
“And how was the ball?” His mother began to lead him towards the hedges which towered above them.
He growled as the thought came unbidden to his head and he shoved it aside. He left the room feeling sour.
He hadn’t even really processed those events himself- everything had just been about surviving.
He checked the piece of parchment he always kept with him. It was charmed with the Protean charm and allowed him to talk to Pansy. He had sent it’s sister to her shortly after being imprisoned- he knew after spending time with Luna that talking with someone often made him feel better. This was as close as he could get.
Draco grunted in agreement, too caught up in his own thoughts to care.
He had made it. They were going to be-
Draco and Pansy spent the next hour finishing the badges off while Crabbe and Goyle handed them out to all the Slytherins. They were all tasked with making sure as many people as possible wore them the next day, especially the Hufflepuffs.
While she was considerably younger than his mother, they had bonded over their love for their sons and mutual love of fashion and anything expensive.
“It’s something that comes with the teeth” Fenrir smiled, his teeth glistening in the lamplight. “Blending in with the shadows that is.” He snorted “Not the secret that I keep.” He gestured to Blaise’s door “I’ve been watching the boy’s door. Don’t want him running off without payment now.”
“Don’t kill him! DON’T KILL HIM!”  Their split-second hesitation at Draco’s desperate screams was all Potter needed.
“Yes, they have also been well-”
Draco considered his wand which lay on the table in front of him. It was simple, not overly ornamented, and had served him well. He knew that the core, Unicorn hair, was the most faithful of the cores.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Borgin’s sceptical look. “You doubt me Borgin?”
The last paragraph where Mother had asked him to come home was torturing him. He knew he couldn't go home, his occlumency hadn't improved enough to face Father yet. And his Mother had hinted that his father wanted to “check his progress” that alone caused enough fear to stop him from caving and going home.
Yes, the next part of this story will be filled with far more Drarry. Sorry I pulled you through that.
“And your Mother?”
Draco frowned “He must be late, c’mon let’s buy a butterbeer”
“Did you do everything on the third line, Potter?” Potter muttered something in response
Ever since Potter had failed to dispute the rumors that he was Bi, Draco had found himself watching the star of the school more and more. He was curious and was trying to see if Potter displayed any characteristics that might identify him as gay.
Harry grabbed Draco and dragged him onto his own broom and Draco felt his own arms wrap around the warm body of the boy in front of him.
“Lets go and see how Potter’s coping with being beaten by Weasley! ...Pansy told us.” Their smiles were cruel. Draco had never noticed that before. But after having spent a number of weeks with Death Eaters he now noticed the small details. The glint in the eyes- The eyes that held no kindness at all. He wandered how often he had once worn the same smile.
“You decide pretty boy. But pay my pretty little price. Or else” Upon the last two words, Greyback looked up and winked at Draco and left the room.
speak ill of me or of the cause ever again- swear to me.” Lucius put his hand out, gesturing for Draco to give his own.
This time when Voldemort entered Draco’s head he didn’t bother to put on his show of fire and lightning, he just threw aside Draco’s walls. Draco felt himself cry out from the shock.
look on her face. Draco had last seen the look shorty before receiving a punch in the face by the crazed woman herself. He decided upon a tactical retreat.
“You know, one day I am going to get you to open up” Blaise rested his hand upon Draco knee and Draco struggled to breathe for a second. He wanted to open up to Blaise, but knew he never could. Sighing, he changed the subject.
” He heard Snape’s sharp intake of breath “-so I wouldn’t say it wasn’t as bad”
Draco came back into his body. For a moment he didn’t open his eyes.
His final defences went up and the younger, brattier, unempathetic Draco took over. Draco would have screamed if he could. But he could control nothing.
Five days later, after essentially spending the entirety of that time locked in his room recovering, Draco returned to Hogwarts.
Crabbe ran past them all, now looking terrified- he seemed to understand the idiocy of what he had just done.
Pansy slapped his arm “Come on, stop showing off your
Draco raised his eyebrow. He hadn’t been expecting that. “Yes.”
“Wandering what secrets he’s hiding?” Draco found the growl belonged to Fenrir Greyback as he stepped from the shadows. Draco hadn’t even seen the man- if you could call him that.
Draco raised an eyebrow at Theo who shook his head, clearly giving the message-
my head isn’t screwed on- besides I can’t even do the fucking charm anyway-” He kicked at the grass, “Yeah, I’ve admitted that I had a change of heart, but that doesn't magically make me
As if called by Draco’s thoughts, a sneering Lucius pushed through the bar’s door. He looked around, his face turning mildly disgusted. He spotted Draco, and the disgusted look did not go away.  He gestured with his chin and swept out the door, knowing Draco would follow. Draco got up, collecting his suitcase on the way, his feeling of dread growing larger as he got closer to the door. He was so frightened his father would look into his mind and find the dream Draco had not yet had a chance to bury. Yet- he had no choice. Like an animal being lead to slaughter he followed his father, dread in his gut and mind.
Pansy went a bright red and stuttered “Oh- I... Of course” she finished lamely. She turned and hurried away. Draco rolled his eyes, Pansy got so needlessly emotional sometimes.
Draco panicked, and it focused his mind enough that for a second, he felt in control. “Ouch!” He yelled and shoved Malkin’s hand away. “Watch where you’re putting your pins,
There’s so much I have planned after school ends, but I want the character setup and exploration of Draco first, plus a few story elements that need to be there for after school.
“Draco, wake up” Blaise came into focus as Draco attempted to wake up, cursing the occlumency headache. He had still been practising defending his mind, despite the apparent futility of it. Voldemort would always be more powerful than him.
There was going to be hell to pay as soon as Snape arriv-
“Well, your name does mean dragon after all”
Draco suddenly couldn’t be bothered with it. There was a hole opening in his chest and he couldn’t breathe properly. The anger he had escaped was simmering in his stomach again.  He needed to get out. He began to make his way to the carriages, abandoning his friends. Crabbe and Goyle took this as a sign and followed Draco, taking the liberty to push lost first years out of the way. Draco just watched it happen, not able to care, and just focusing on
“Down here, I want to show you something.” Draco felt his stomach drop- the basement was where the majority of prisoners were held and… tortured. His mind shuddered at the word and its connotations. Late at night when the Death Eaters had forgotten to put up silencing charms he could sometimes hear their muted screams, and sometimes he heard them in his dreams. Why was his father taking him into the room?
“What's doing it?” One of the Patil twins asked, obviously terrified. “What's eating it?!”
” He could barely hear his mother’s voice echoing through his mind, but could see her pale, concerned face, and hear his vicious reply as clear as day.
Draco wondered what exactly he was considering when he felt it in his mind, a small assault. It drew back, surprised at the defence it found. It stood up higher and
Theo raised his hand to his chin, looking frightened, yet thoughtful.
“You,” she said to Blaise, “Need to work on predicting where I will fire. Trust your instinct, not your brain.”
for Merlin’s sake-”
Draco snapped out of his thoughts and suppressed a groan, Umbridge was the last person he wanted to see at that moment.
Potter raised his wand higher. In the back of his mind, Draco desperately hoped Potter would do it.
“Good evening, Draco, please take a seat.” Draco mentally readied himself for the attack before he even sat down. Snape had long ago stopped asking him if he was ready. As Snape had sarcastically told him once, “Your enemies won't ask nicely.” Sure enough, as soon as Draco had sat down he felt his walls being assaulted by Snape. He gritted his teeth.
As he sat down and waited for Pansy to finish he made a decision. The house elf came over with the water and Draco asked it how long until dinner was served. “About 3 minutes sir”
The crowd buzzed around him, and after a minute or two of speculation, Krum was dragged out looking unconscious, or close to it.
Right well see you when I see you!
he found the release that his wand could provide. He screamed one final time as he forced it from his mind and out of his wand, making it explode into his childhood bedroom.
Draco was beginning to rise to join him when Blaise yelled “I’m gonna win!” and took off.
If he hadn’t been listening out for it, he would have missed it.
the way he smiled at you? I didn’t even get anything
“I’ve found it,” said Draco, turning to meet Borgin’s surprised face.
Eventually, they made it to the Great Hall and stood outside- listening to Mcgonagall begin the evacuation procedure. Just as he began to get bored, a loud piercing voice came into his head.
Draco raised his chin, "I could easily take you both on in a duel- careful with your words." They had no idea how shaken he was from the darkness in his mind- which had woken up and started poking at the walls of its confines.
Draco rolled his eyes, and turned to glare at Potter. Of course Potter needed to do a photoshoot. It was retch-worthy. Knowing Potter though, who Draco had noticed didn’t really like attention, it would probably be like torture and it would also have the added bonus of making the entire school hate him more than they already did.
Time to put that theory to the test.
“Im fine Mother, get off me. - I said I’m
What. The... Fuck?
As Flitwick waddled away, Theo frowned and turned to Draco. “You cocky bastard”
“I know that you are preparing to fight.” Draco began to feel nauseous as his heart struggled to leave the confines of his chest. Voldemort was
“Where did you get that key?” He asked as they hurried through silent hallways.
Thought Draco as he untied the letter from the bird's leg. He gave the owl a pat and some of his sausage, and sent it on it’s way then ripped the letter open.
Underneath the headline was a picture that gave Draco the chills. The ransacked shop had not been treated with any mercy- it was a message to the wizarding world. Just as every attack so far had been.
He engaged Blaise in conversation as he began to figure out whos foot that might have been.
“Draco” It was his father. Draco’s stomach dropped and he sat up. The world rocked on its hinges. He struggled not to vomit.
“Did he mention what it was?” Theo asked, ignoring Pansy.
He put his fingers to the piano and played.
He watched as his Mother slowly turned red and then purple as his father continued to yell various slurs at her.
Pansy snickered “Maybe she's secretly related to a ghoul!” Crabbe and Goyle barked out loud laughs, causing a sleeping painting on the wall beside them to wake up with a start.
that Harry had described, but he didn’t need to summon a memory, because he felt it at that very moment.
White spots exploded across his vision. Tears ran down his face. The hand grasping his shirt turned to a hand on his neck.
“Draco!” His Mother whispered more urgently this time and he forced himself to look at her. She reached up to hug him, yet his arms didn’t go around her as they should have.
“I’m not going to hurt you” Draco felt some air make its way into his lungs.
Snape was one of the many visitors to the house and Draco didn't know how to feel. He looked up to Snape, but here Snape was, participating in the meetings. Draco began to question himself… everyone around him thought this was okay, but why didn't he?
“Congratulations on finding someone worthy of your love, Har.” Ginny smiled at the curly haired wizard who she used to date. They nodded to each other, and Ginny reached for Girlfriend’s hand, Fred reaching for his girlfriend.
At the very end of the table, Fleur and Bill sat, talking quietly, hands clapped together, and very slowly eating their fill.
The two glasses wearing boys, looked to one another-trying to make the other go first. Harry seemed to lose and say to his adoptive mother, “...Uh, no…”
“You're such a git.” Harry scowled, spinning around on his heel and walking into the bright and-relatively-happy home of the Weasley clan, his black robes billowing behind him.
“Katie, zat ez amazing!” Fleur sung.
“I'm gonna cry again!” Harry sobbed.
“That means the world to me, Gin.” George thanked her, trying to avoid the molten hot glare from his twin.
“Alright, everyone!” Mrs. Weasley shouted from the kitchen doorway and hurried over to the table with a large tray, “Dinner time!” She said and revealed the food on the large dish.
The table of Weasley’s (And future Weasleys) all slowly turned to the third oldest child, all with ajar mouths and raised eyebrows.
“Huh.” Arthur grunted, sitting back in his seat a bit, setting his fork down. If he was angry, he didn't show it. He looked more...surprised.
“Just the perks of being a mother. I know how to multitask.” She answered, sitting herself down and scooting into the table. She placed her napkin in her lap and nodded for everyone to begin eating once Arthur sat back down. The woman looked over to Angelina next, “I know you're a vegetarian, dear-there's some veggie chicken right next to George.” She pointed to the food and gave her son a look, in order for him to pass the food to his- probably soon to be-sister in law.
The man raised an eyebrow, “What? You heard your mother, invite the boy over for Merlin’s sake!” He took a sip of pumpkin juice before going on, “But what’s the boy’s name? Do any of us know him?”
“I'm so happy for you guys,” Ginny said after the others stopped their bellyaching. She offered her older brother and soon to be sister in law a smile, which they both returned happily.
She sat next to Luna and Fred, pulling a napkin into her lap and tucking a curl behind her ear. A smile sent around the table, and she was diving into a deep conversation with Luna, discussing whether or not they would be returning to Hogwarts for an eighth year. Ron sighed and sat next to his little sister, ignoring an irritated Percy, who had been nodding at the seat next to him-not wanting George to take the seat on his right, as he was now seated in between the twins.
“Does he work at the ministry? Is it Harper’s son? He’s a bit of a tosser, but I heard his son was into lads and had recently struck up a relationship with some-”
And his frustrated huffs he was letting out.
“I'm dating Draco Malfoy. The son of Lucius Malfoy.” Harry answered, shoving a piece of bread in his mouth and avoiding any eye contact at all.
“What's wrong?” Hermione frowned, getting close enough to see the discomfort in his eyes. And his grimace. And his sweaty forehead.
“We love you, kid.” Charlie grinned and ruffled Harry’s already messy locks. More laughter erupted from everyone’s throat, and Harry found himself trying to hold back a few tears, his emotions becoming heavier with all the kind words he was getting.
Percy seemed to go as red as his hair when he realized he had just shouted out-and then
Harry sat down at the other end of the table, right next to Charlie and Bill, grinning brightly at the two telling him Molly was going to sit at the other end with Ron and Ginny. He gave a laugh when Charlie began to drag out his wallet (Which was full to the max with pictures of his dragon children) before both were scolded by Arthur-who sat across from them, along with a tired looking Fleur. The pregnancy seemed to really be doing a number on her sleep schedule.
The couple exchanged humoured looks, stifling their laughter in different ways. Hermione slipped a hand over her mouth, and Ron-not stifling his at all-simply burst into a round of laughter.
Fred had invited Angelina Johnson (Who was apparently his girlfriend, much to no one’s surprise).
Unluckily, that meant Molly was going to begin her usual series of questions for the single people at the table. Which, only consisted of Harry and Percy now, as everyone had partners or was aromatic (Cough-Charlie-Cough). The two gentlemen sucked in a breath as she asked,
Ron quickly accepted and pulled himself off the ground, using Hermione’s hand very minimally-to not seem like he had tried too hard-keeping his fingers intertwined with Hermione’s as they made their way up the hill, coming closer and closer to a disgruntled looking Harry.
Two blue eyes darted over to Ron before to Harry, “Then who is it?” Arthur frowned, “Don’t say it’s Harper, himself. I would have to alert the authorities. Right after I gave him a rightful beating, of course. Maybe use just my fists. No wand necessary.”
The laughed, some still in the form of snickers, and some very wet as if they had just cried.
The rest of the family finished their clinks and all took a large gulp, finishing up the toast and going right back into eating and talking with one another. As a whole family, with everyone smiling brightly and full of joy, no one feeling out of place.
A round of ‘Here here’s went around the table and then little knocks as everyone clinked their glasses together. Luna accidentally spilled some of her own drink on her girlfriend’s hand-but Ginny didn't seem to care and smiled back at her.
Harry glared at the others snickering as he answered, “It's actually not a she.”
“He has changed though, right?” Katie piped up, staying quiet for most of the prior conversation, but speaking up in that moment. She hurried on when she noticed everyone’s raised eyebrows, “I-I mean, he wasn't the...nicest person to be around and he regularly made fun on me for being a half blood and he-”
Harry’s nose wrinkled up in disgust. He ignored the shouts of laughter the others gave and squeaked, “That is-no. Just,” He closed his eyes and almost dry heaved, “Merlin’s saggy tit, no.”
The other murmerd in agreement, All casting a loving look around the table-those with partners there, sending soft smiles and tender winks to their lovers.
“Do you think we could just ignore him and sit here in peace for the rest of the evening, ‘Mione?” Ron asked, voice practically in a whine.
Molly hooked into Fred’s comment and looked to Harry with wide eyes, “Are you seeing someone? Really? Why haven't you told me? Who is it? Would I approve? Who is she?”
The tall redhead’s older brother’s lips scrunched up, as if sucking on a tart lemon drop, and looked his brother in the face. They both stared at each other until Percy lost the staring contest and blurred out,
He looked down at his plate with a blank look when he got an elbow to the gut.
Of course, after a while, the Weasleys started bringing their partners with them. First, it was just Fleur who came with the Bill.
“It's not Mr. Harper’s son.” Ron cut his father off, wanting to just get all of this drama over with. He couldn’t eat his dinner peacefully in this conversation. Bites of chicken were taken rapidly, followed by mouth fills of pumpkin juice and corn.
“Um,” Harry shrugged, “I think so. You might know his father better though, dad.”
She smiled, nonetheless, and kissed his cheek, aiming for a large part of his many freckles, which dotted his face like a mosaic. A grin dusted both of their features and they fell into a soft quiet, the only sound coming from inside the Weasley home. Loud laughs came from within, and they both tried to ignore it until they were called in for dinner.
Ron leaned closer to Hermione, trying to give more of his body warmth with a big hug, when- “Ron! Hermione! It's time for dinner, you two!” Harry shouted from the front doorstep, his voice carrying all the way down to them, at the end of the hill.
And so, all of the Weasley children had arrived with their special someone, Charlie having his beloved dragons with him (As dangerous as it sounds) and Harry with a big stack of fan mail from supporters around the world. And then there was also Percy...no one really knew what was going on with him and no one wanted to ask, in fear of him disappearing once again
The table quickly stopped the small conversations, all wanting to see the new episode of: Molly Weasley trying to set her kids up with her friend’s kids. Every new one was a delight to watch when you weren't the object of Molly’s questions and suspicious glances.
She was quite done with their idiotic behavior.
“Harry!” The twins and Molly shouted at the same time, but for different reasons and with very different tones.
“This looks amazing, Molly.” Arthur smiled at his wife, “However did you find the time to make this all in three hours?” He asked and stood to pull her seat out for her.
Harry nodded, “I can-yeah. I'll invite him over for tea. He would love that, mom.” His voice grew thick with emotion and his eyes shimmered with happy tears when Charlie patted him on the back and Fleur kissed his cheek. He looked to Arthur, waiting for his comments.
Ron followed after his friend, stopping his laughter and replacing it with a whine when Hermione elbowed him in the rib cage, “Shut it, Ronald.” She commanded and made her way over to the dinner table.
“What the hell, George?!? Why wouldn't you tell me you proposed? I was gonna set up a romantic evening for you two and then show up halfway through, with rose petals, and champagne, and a camera to capture the lovely-”
They walked for some time, the reality and threat of his father getting further and further away.
Sleep was tough that night and when he finally escaped he found Harry waiting for him.
“Give me Harry Potter, and you will be rewarded. You have until midnight.”
The voice spread through his mind and Draco felt his body tense- This was all happening too quickly for him to process.
Draco continued, not caring. “Is it- Is it possible that Fenrir Greyback could let the wizarding world know that the Zabini’s are here?”
Draco shook his head “No it’s too early, we won’t get any until November at least”
“Don’t interrupt me.” He ignored her reaction “I don’t want you involved. They know what Borgin sells- and we’ve already had multiple things taken from the Manor. We can’t give them an excuse... It
“He was on the first page that many times, you’d think the prophet would get tired of the witch hunt,” said Pansy “Also, he’s not even a celebrity anymore...more like an
“I thought you just told me to shut up”
Draco turned around, his lips lifting and his eyes going straight to Potter who looked like he was about to vomit up some slugs.
“That’s bullshit,” Draco said, and Blaise snapped his head up “You have my father's protection, and my father is employing that man. Bad things happen to people who cross my father.”
Once again, the time has come to move through some time quickly.
“Morning,” he said to them both, before taking a bite of the apple. Its flavour was a little subdued, but manageable. They mumbled their replies, both too caught up in their food and drinks to seriously reply. It also seemed as if Theo had not yet been affected by his coffee yet.
He only realised he was crying when a tear dripped onto his hand.
“Never on the face, otherwise you and my friends would know”
My Mother’s not a whore! And we don’t have a fucking fortune- we’re technically
"Obviously, as he
“No, not until we have a talk bud.”
Draco found ‘boxing’ as Blaise called it, and running, were his favourite ways to help his head from flying into fits of rage or horror at the situation... not that he didn’t. Several times he found himself kicking or punching walls, or even sometimes statues, and suits of armour- much to their distress.
“How are you doing?”
Plans, so many of them.
Draco’s frown deepened. He
He nodded in approval.
Minutes later he found himself making his way up to Umbridge’s office. Just before he reached the door a hand grabbed his shoulder.
They walked into the out of the castle and towards the groundskeeper’s house, rejoicing to be free of the inane torture that had been Defence against the Dark arts.
As he gave the large bowtruckle to Blaise to sort out, he nudged Pansy and raised his voice “Yes, Father was talking to the Minister just a couple of days ago, you know, and it sounds as though the Ministry's really determined to crack down on sub-standard teaching in this place. So even if that overgrown moron does show up again, he'll probably be sent packing straightaway.”
Draco felt sick. Not just in his stomach, but in his entire body. His legs and arms were weak, sweating. His mouth was dry and his eyes could not seem to focus-- neither could his head, it jumped from one incomplete fear to the next and each thought made him feel sicker. He was lost for words for a long time. His Mother became silent as well.
Hope you enjoy this one, please leave a kudos, or even better comment if you did! it helps a lot!
He returned to his rooms and begun to get ready for bed. As he stripped off his sweat-soaked clothes and climbed into the soft, feather duvet sent by his mother, he knew should definitely have a shower, but the medicine Snape gave him made him so tired and Draco couldn't be bothered. He started the meditations that would help shield his mind when he was asleep...
about you…” Blaise looked very uncomfortable. “Come on” he turned and left the pub, several people hurrying out of the way as he strode towards them.
“Alright! Let’s start off easy” said Graham, who was a chaser himself. They all launched in the air.
“Draco, I am aware you usually like to have your own desk, however as Mr Zabini here is new to the class and curriculum, and you are the most capable student here, you will be assisting him.” Snape ignored the glare Draco sent him. He
Also its important to character development so I hope you don't mind. Harry will be back. Dream Harry will def be back even sooner.
His Mother nodded. “Very well. I believe you.” Draco knew she was just trying to end the conversation. He closed his eyes, fighting tears as she reached out and touched his shoulder.
Wow hi, thanks for reading. This is my first go at fanfiction so any comments or suggestions are welcome!
Draco wasn't surprised in the slightest by his attire.
He looked towards the sky and found a thousand stars staring back at him. Was Harry up there now? A hundred tales and stories said it must be so.
“Oh,” Draco said, taken aback. It was his turn to be silent for a moment. Then- “Okay”
Blaise looked down, “Uh, about halfway through… why?”
Potter, who had shoved Draco into this fucking mess by forcing his father to go to prison, who didn’t have the Dark Lord breathing down his neck, didn’t have a mark he despised
” But it was seemingly acceptable. They were packing their things away when Draco looked up and noticed Potter’s cauldron had grey smoke coming out of it- and Weasleys had green sparks flying out of it. Draco smirked, he knew Snape had been unfair, the first potion of the year was quite difficult.  That didn’t stop it from being funny though. Blaise had been lucky to have him. He looked around to find that Pansy’s potion was a little too dark and its steam was lavender instead of blue, while Theo seemed to have made a potion that was similar to Blaise’s.
“But when he hit you... when he turned that side onto you- I saw what I had so ignorantly been hiding from myself. Any love that might have still been there... left me, and I realised having no father would be better for you than having
It was a voice he was far too familiar with.
Blaise shook his head, giving Draco a grateful smile and got back to it.
Draco snorted. The put a hand on Biases shoulder, liking the way Blaise tensed slightly and looked nervous at the contact “Take you own advice, breathe and you’ll be fine”
Seemingly knowing the same thing, Voldemort’s voice returned, a crueler, more manipulative note to it. “
Draco was fairly pleased with his physical shape since he had begun routinely working out. Sure, he wasn’t buff at all like Crabbe and Goyle, but no one could deny the lean muscles that had formed on his arms, legs and back.
" before! I know you did. Do you think we're stupid?!"
Anyway thanks for reading, much love!
Sighing, he reached out and grasped the handle, closing his eyes as he felt the familiar, warm, tingling sensation.
“No.” Draco spoke sharply, trying to scare the screams away as well as Harry’s pity, “I had a change of heart a long time before that actually, but it’s… complicated.” He didn’t quite feel like explaining his crush on Harry quite at this moment, or his experience being trapped in his own head for almost an entire year, the latter of which had changed him quite a lot.
for the first time in far too long.
“We were hiding in the corridor outside,” grunted Goyle. “We can do Diss-lusion Charms now! And then,” his smile grew, “You turned up right in front of us and said you were looking for a diedum! What’s a diedum?”
He tried to push the thought away but as Potter dropped into a dive and swooped down to grab the golden egg and the crowd screamed around him, Draco couldn’t hide from the fact that Potter looked very, very, hot. It became harder to deny as Harry hoisted the golden egg in the air, a triumphant look on his face, as the crowd went mental for him.
“Sorry, what?” he asked Pansy, struggling to care about what she was saying.
Charms: O
“It wasn’t as bad as last time, as this time you can walk,” Snape said in a neutral tone.
“So how did you get in here?” he asked as his foot hit a chair.
Draco realised that he felt it- he felt the peace… the
Draco quickly packed his homework away. As he zipped up his bag he saw Dumbledore get up and made his way out of the stands. Draco followed, ignoring Pansy’s cries of annoyance.
Well, she certainly seemed comfortable with it.
Snape looked up and saw Draco standing there, obviously stunned. He rushed over and gripped Draco’s shoulder. “I am being called. Which means he is back. Hide, do not be around when the word gets out. You will be a target.” Snape strode away, his robes billowing behind him. Draco stayed where he was, stuck. The thoughts crashing through his head.
“No.” His father’s response was curt and short, but welcome.
They all went a little bit paler and he could practically see them all imagining it in their heads.
Sniggering, Draco gave Potter a last glance, noticing Potter still looked fairly rattled. Draco felt like shit for having caused that. They left, and heard the compartment door slam shut behind them.
Draco felt his face heat in shame. He struggled to control his expression. “Well, I technically am a death eater.”
Always, his mind would play these events and words over and over. He could do nothing, but surely he could do
Draco…I would not condone my own son to that- I
“Did you read the prophet this morning?”
“Oh, it’s the thing muggles use when they jump out of planes-” he saw Draco’s face, “Ah. You wouldn’t know what a plane is either…” he paused, obviously trying to come up with an explanation, “Well- it’s like a bus that- flies. It has wings. They're made of metal. They use them like we use portkeys- to cover large distances.” He frowned, seemingly going over his explanation, “...Yeah.”
“I miss being a kid. When shit didn’t matter” Draco spoke quietly, unwilling to disturb the view that stretched out in front of them for miles.
Despite the fact that Draco finally had realised his mistakes, had finally realised he was an asshole- Had been ready to just quietly let Potter get on with his life and not torment Granger anymore--
“Corner me! Find a way!” Bellatrix was in her element, her eyes were alight.
Pansy looked most concerned of all. “Draco- are you sure you don’t want us to stay-”
His gaze slid to Crabbe and Goyle, who’s gaze’s were cold- they were the same as Pansy, yet crueler.
The battle, the deaths, the endless nightmares- they all had faded away as soon as the stag had come close. He no longer felt the weight of all of those faces, all of those screams- his mind was
“There is perhaps something you could help me with…” She paused, licked her lips, and considered her next move. “...What I want, is for you to gather information about some certain students and teachers for me. You see, I am trying to- restore some order in this school, but as you have highlighted, this is difficult with no allies,
Honestly ive been writing this for so long that its hard to rememeber half my scenes.
The Hogwarts express seemed different. It could have been the Aurors prowling around the platform, or perhaps it was the tension and fear that was thick in the air.
Draco sighed.
“We bring you his body as proof that your hero is gone.” Draco found he could not move.
He glanced around, marvelling at the quietness of the street as he strode down it. It did make it easier to get where he wanted to go, but something… didn’t feel right.
And so here he was, walking back and forth-
This was a man he had always respected and in a way loved, but he had come to hate the beliefs he had once shared with him.
“It was lots of fun” He didn’t mention that the alcohol he had ingested had definitely been responsible for that.
“Oh, so sorry. I ah- thought you might have been a death eater…” He tucked his wand away. “Sorry.”
He probably did need to eat more.
Y'all were wondering when it was going to happen...
As soon as his wand made contact- he could
He was trying to fight but it was now becoming clear that he was losing. The darkness had escaped its small confinements and had been free in his mind for too long. It had spread its tendrils too far through his mind. It was
all the time. And people who are good and kind hate me for it. What-” He knew the next sentence was very risky but could not stop it from tumbling out of his mouth, just as his other words had “What if
Having no excuse to stand there-
“IF WE DIE FOR THEM, I’LL KILL YOU, HARRY!” Weasley swooped down to them, Granger sharing his broom. And then, miraculously, they began dragging Goyle onto their broom. Draco felt the tears that were running down his face from pure gratitude dry as the flames suddenly became angrier.
“Na-uh” said Blaise who whipped the covers off him. “We... are going for a run.” Draco groaned, hating Blaise with a burning passion. “Nice ass by the way.” Blaise chuckled as Draco yelped and jumped out of bed, clad only in underwear. He covered his junk with his hand.
He pointed his wand at the shelf where he kept his medicine for the occlumency headaches. He used the potion only when he had to, as he didn't have an infinite supply, and due to his excessive occlumency practice, it went down rather quickly and was difficult to brew and therefore, replace.
He pulled himself out of his bed, feeling like pure dragon shit and made his way down the stairs. All of them looked smart in their travelling robes.
He felt the anger that had been building come to a crescendo.
She sighed and untangled herself from his arms. “Okay. Well- make sure you write me back, I’m going to be sending a lot of letters.”
Draco looked up and shook his head.
Draco tore himself from Snape’s grip and sprinted over back to the stands, having figured out the connection between the portkey and Harry to Voldemort. Draco followed Snape's advice and was cautious. He hid behind the stands, with a good view of the entrance to the maze.
Oblivious, Blaise continued his lecture. “I can see you’re angry, but yelling at her won’t do any good,” He placed a hand onto Draco’s arm “she’s high inquisitor now and you heard and saw what happened to Potter in his detentions... She’s got power, so I don’t know how much a good idea-”  Blaise stopped at the look Draco was giving him.
“I didn’t help her escape. She was safer here in my care then out there being hunted.”
Ice began to creep through Draco’s veins and he began to rebuild his walls as his father’s voice slowly raised in volume “I see your feelings! I see how disgusted you are by having to kiss her. Just to
didn't matter. The further he got from Harry, the further Crabbe and Goyle got from him too. As long as Crabbe and Goyle lost sight of Harry too, he was safe.
“You fucking Bastard!” Theo was glaring at him.
Harry turned around, a look of disbelief upon his face.
- hem- if you get my meaning. Now both of you should go and eat breakfast, should you not?”
He still hadn’t brought up the courage to take the wand from Harry’s hand…
Theo’s grin widened “An apt title, as I love a little mood murder to spice up my life!”
- lived
“I don’t know what came over me,” Draco said, dismissing her “I just really wanted to curse Potter-” He continued, ignoring her look of disbelief “But I'm going to go to Borgin and Burkes now, you should go have lunch somewhere. I have decided I don’t want you involved.”
He felt even worse when on Monday Harry gave him a vile look as they walked towards Care of Magical Creatures. He couldn't imagine how he would feel if someone banned him from the sport, he knew Harry must get a similar amount of joy as Draco from flying.
“No!” Blaise looked panicked. “I’m fine Draco, really. I don’t want you to have to go to your father unnecessarily. Greyback’s just another asshole who would do anything to get with my mother. I don’t want to make him feel he has power over me if your father cracks down on him. Just- just let it cool down.”
me- and you shame your blood!”
(See the end of the chapter for
It couldn’t be Theo either. It had something else,
“You’re going to… use me?” Blaise shook his head then seemed to accept it. “Right. - Also, why does your father want with-”
“Very good Draco”
“Think… You mustn’t… You’ll be in such trouble…”
And with that, the Dark Lord left his mind.
And with that, she gave a small smile and linked arms with him. Soon they were walking through the very same gardens he had danced with Harry in the night before, but it was now covered in snow, and only a few magically strong flowers survived.
They stood there for sometime before Draco felt something brush his hand- he slowly opened his palm to take Blaise’s hand, which was warmer than his. Something in him fluttered, he knew this was wrong but he couldn’t stop himself. So- instead- he smiled, enjoying the freedom. They stood there for a little longer, watching the sky, their hands intertwined.
He swallowed the words of rebellion. They could end any chance he had.
Not long after that, they were jogging in the gardens, the smell of various flowers filling their nostrils. Draco had missed them and the colours they held. As they jogged past the broom shed Draco pulled up and gestured. They had abstained from flying during the winter- But now... now it was spring. Blaise grinned and they rushed to grab some brooms and a practice snitch.
“Mr Malfoy! And Mr Zabini! Why you have me quite unprepared! Did you make an appointment I’ve forgotten about dear?”
Draco looked back up, to look directly into Snape’s eyes and unflinchingly replied “Exactly”
Let me know your thoughts!
Draco shook his head. “Nobody has been able to figure it out.”
“Form up!” Draco grabbed his broomstick and followed the new captain, Graham Montague’s, orders. It was the day after his breakdown and trials for the quidditch team were on. Draco felt ready for them as, thanks to Blaise, his head was clear. He had been for a run that morning, having felt the urge to just
He sighed as he spotted his Mother hurrying down the street towards him a very angry look on her face.
Draco's heart swelled as he spotted him- Messy hair and messy clothes- looking very out of his element as every pair of eyes in the room turned to look at him. It was almost laughable. How could Potter still not be accustomed to people looking at him?
Impossible. The Dark Lord was
He slammed up his walls, despite knowing what little they would do to stop an attack.
“Follow me please” Pansy began leading the first years away, and Draco glanced up to see Potter leaving the hall, looking distressed, and the source of his departure was clear. He was being followed by looks of apprehension, fear and some which displayed outright hate.
Apparently, they all heard him.
“It’s not that simple... Draco, he loves you. You are still his son. He is just struggling to change a belief he thought was wrong his entire life. His father did incredibly cruel things to him as he grew up and he thinks that his treatment of you is normal.” Draco felt tears prickling in his eyes.
Draco nodded “He got through my walls, I wasn’t fast enough when I put them up… he saw through the Pansy stuff but it distracted him enough that I hid the memories.”
“No, don’t even try to bullshit that with me Draco. Did you
Once again, it was difficult to write and anything you liked/didn't like commented down below would be appreciated.
He coughed and watched as some snakes made of fire began striking at him, burning him, searing him, making him scream in pain. He felt his head descending into a manic state.
“They have been well, and yours?” Draco replied, as was polite.
“What the hell?” said Blaise, who was standing behind Draco. Draco was thinking the same thing. His Father had been right. This bitch was out of control. The word that stood out to him was the word
Blaise just looked at him, a confused expression on his face “My mother doesn't have an owl, he lets her use his.”
So when Voldemort went looking, he found all memories of Draco bullying Potter and his friends that had been carefully layered over everything. The memories played back to Draco and he struggled not to wince at his own cruelness.
“Ready?” said the oaf, looking around at the class, his beady looking eyes looking more excited than Draco had seen them in a while. “Right, well, I've bin savin' a trip inter the Forest fer yer fifth year. Thought we'd go an' see these creatures in their natural habitat. Now, what we're studyin' today is pretty rare, I reckon I'm probably the on'y person in Britain who's managed ter train 'em.”
“You're quiet Draco.” She waited for his answer.
Draco put the letter down for the third time that day. He missed his mother so much, he hadn’t spoken to her since the previous summer holidays, when Father had discovered Draco’s memories. After the nightmare that had been the following week Draco had locked himself away in his room, not wanted to see his friends, but he had needed his mother.
Draco felt rooted to the ground. He looked into his father’s harsh eyes, hating him. His Father would crush him in a duel if he tried to fight it. He had no choice.
Draco’s back automatically straightened at the tone his father had taken. He panicked and turned to leave, feeling sick to the stomach.
“But- why would you put some of your soul in anything?” Blaise looked horrified now.
When I go back and re-read my first chapters it's horrible, so many errors (despeite the fact that I read it dozens of times.) So Im going to leave all this up because its informing the plot of the next part- (it wont be nessesary to read this though), but Ill also leave it up as a little insight into the process of my writing developing.
“Should we even be discussing this?” Pansy sounded scared. He rarely heard her sounding scared.
In answer, the oaf just pointed to the cow. Draco looked at the cow again, despite how gross it was, and held back a need to sprint in the other direction as he noticed a strip of flesh that seemingly tore itself off the carcass.
as the blanket was whipped off Draco. He squinted, his eyes adjusting as she hauled him up and shoved him into a cupboard. “I’ll send Crabbe and Goyle back for you,” she whispered as she shut the door.
Draco felt the same longing for better times... but then growled as the anger came back in full force. He threw the photo across the room, but it didn't break as the vase had last time. In response, Draco punched the wall. A large dent opened under his fist and pain blossomed up his arm. It felt good. Realising he didn't want his father in his room he cast a silencing charm. Then he punched the wall again.
Potter say such things to his mother.
His eyes wandered over the various dark artefacts and ornaments- and immediately found the tall cupboard which sat near the back of the store. It had old runes all over it, a brass handle, feet which curled gracefully and matched the description of the cabinet from his research exactly... he allowed himself to smile.
” Draco took the opportunity and
She looked a little dazed. “I suppose so.” She averted her eyes, obviously uncomfortable with how close he was to her.
“Heh Hem”
“He was telling me about how impressed he was with your new program and ideas. Thinks this is
Draco frowned, but nodded. Truth be told, he hadn’t really wanted to speak to his father anyway.
you and you weren’t there…” He couldn’t bear to look at her, but he heard her sob. He closed his eyes, wishing for-- he didn’t know. Something to make this
They said their goodbyes, and then made their way down the stairs.
Finally, when they were assigned the task of drawing and documenting the behaviour of the bowtruckles, Granger was forced to shut up, and Draco could stop being a dick.
“Um, Draco?”
your bud..
“Well, he’s giving me gay vibes, because he didn’t really
Alright- remember no upload for awhile- see you then!! <3
Yet, the exercise helped. He was thankful Blaise had found him when he did, but wished he had known about how helpful exercise was during the holidays, maybe he could have helped his mother more. He resolved to tell her when he got home.
“Sit down” Draco tried to settle, but was somehow unable to in the usually comfortable chair.
Hagrid frowned, some of his excitement visibly leaving him, then upon deciding to ignore Draco, he promptly turned and led them into the forest, collecting a dead cow carcass on the way. Draco struggled not to retch as the half-giant swung the dead animal onto his shoulders and it made a disgusting thunk and slapping sound. They made their way further into the forest and Draco had to make an effort not to turn around and run in the other direction. He couldn’t embarrass himself like that.
Dumbledore looked surprised at the interruption but quickly recovered and sat down. As Umbridge launched into her speech Draco remembered his Father’s words.
They all made their way into the potions classroom, pushing and shoving, and soon enough were all seated in the classroom. Snape had a sour look on his face. “You will notice,” he said in his low, sneering voice, “that we have a guest with us today.”
Automatically he secured the walls in his mind, as he had been conditioned to do. They were strong and they would not break.
Goyle was leaning against the closed door "Leave off 'im Crabbe." Crabbe didn't move.
Alecto said that the Dark Lord said Potter might turn up and they shouldn't question it.
After a terrifying walk through the forest- every slight noise from around the students making Drco flinch slightly, they arrived at a dark clearing and Hagrid dumped the cow carces on the ground. After a second or two the oaf raised his massive hands up to his mouth began to call out in a high pitched wailing noise. Draco could feel the panic building up. He looked into the trees, straining his eyes to try and get a glimpse of the creature Hagrid was calling.
Care of Magical Creatures: E
Snape was quiet.
She lounged in an armchair, her posture beyond relaxed and her eyes closed. She was strikingly beautiful, the paintings had not captured it quite correctly.
the Malfoy boy. I
Crabbe recoiled, then sneered. "C'mon then, let go into there-" he pointed to an empty classroom "-and re-do them."
When he met Mother the next day he was still slightly annoyed. As he crunched through the snow on the way to the restaurant he was meeting her in, he found he was incredibly annoyed by some stupid Christmas carolers. He flicked his wand in their direction and muttered “Descendo” which cause a heap of snow to fall off the roof they were under straight onto them. Draco smiled at their shocked cries.
Pansy met him at the gates, took one look at him, and beamed.
Eventually, he made it out to the corridors and began the long walk across the school towards the Slytherin dungeons. Pulling his cloak tightly against him, trying to keep the cold at bay, he slipped into the first of the many secret passages he had been taught by the older years, getting lost in the memories of all the use he had gained from them, and soon enough he arrived at the large wooden door that led to the Potions classroom.
Knowing all eyes were on her, she forced herself to continue. She had a wand to find. She leaned over him and heard his very quiet breathing… it did not matter. She did not care for this war anymore, nor its martyrs. She just wanted to escape it with her son.
Exceeds Expectations (E)
His expression must have said so for she sighed then clarified “I have not slept properly in a long while without the aid of potions, and they are starting to not affect me anymore… and- well I suppose my head could do with a little ordering.”
How's my romance? It's a bit weird for me to write and difficult (not hard to read though)
“Well... you can’t enter when someone else-” Draco was cut off as he felt a wand shoved into his back and Crabbe's voice came from the other side, “We watched you enter that room a hundred times, Draco. Including the time when Trelawney was in there- No funny business.”
Draco had known since it had all begun that he couldn’t trust him.
"Yes?" said Snape curtly- he clearly wasn’t happy with the interruption.
She looked up, a bit of fire in her eyes, “Your Father often said things like that before you were born.”
The Boy who -
Much Love!
Later that night Draco was making his way to the library, to pick up some more books to study when he spotted his father in the hallway. He turned to hide in a side room.
"But it's only been a couple of weeks." He finished for her, returning her warm smile. She let him in using the same key Filch had used. As soon as he got through she swung it shut behind him and then turned around and swept him into a long hug. But then she stepped back, and he saw none of the joy he had felt in the hug. She was biting her lip and looking concerned.
...When he had heard the Dark Lord’s voice in his head...
“I’ll be fine, Pans” That was not a lie- he would be fine...once they returned.
The seething mass grew and twisted in his mind.
“Just take one capful,” Snape said, the rare sound of concern filling his voice. Draco nodded, not in the mood to talk back to Snape and remind him that he had taken the potion the previous summer.
Practically shitting himself.
” Draco closed his eyes, but there were no tears left. Only numbness. “
Draco exhaled and leaned back in his chair. Something big was happening. He didn’t know what, but the fact that the Dark Lord had panicked in such a way made him almost certain something was big going to happen in Hogsmede or Hogwarts.
They reached the carriages, meaning he felt as if he could breathe. He took a large inhale, and felt a hand on his shoulder. He was ready to shove it off and tell Pansy to leave him alone when he noticed it wasn’t Pansy, but Theo.
Draco stood up, trying to put on a facade of courage but ruined it by stuttering “I- I am trying to fix it, I thought that-”
Blaise knew Draco didn’t get on particularly well with his father- but that was all he knew. “Yeah, that’s shit. But this year it should be different right? With my Mom and I there?” Draco shrugged.
Draco put the note to the side and considered the piece before him. It was titled
mouth and his
“When then?” Harry didn’t take the hint, “You were... different- when we were in the Manor- and in the room of requirement…” he saw Draco’s confused look. “You called it the room of hidden things, but it’s slightly more complic…” He trailed off, “Anyway- when did you change your mind? When did you become good?”
But she did not plan on returning to this place. She was finished with this war.
Draco, I don't have much, but I've heard they are preparing to shut down Hogsmeade… you’re lucky I'm so quick to pass this onto you, the school is also in chaos...
The door creaked open, and from the back of the room, there was a shrill, “Come in!”
Voldemort watched the fake dream, and was still--
The darkness reached out, and crumbled his defences. Draco cried out as the walls he had placed his faith in turned to smoke. There was a feeling of amusement as the Dark Lord considered him. Draco knew he saw the cowering boy, but he took no pity. Draco could now feel what Voldemort felt. There were no walls between them now. He felt…
Yet still. He was trapped. And restless. And he had nothing to do but think.
Draco hit it with all the force he could muster. It felt good. And his hand, which had now healed, only hurt the smallest amount. It was enough.
He didn’t miss Potter’s smirking face when Draco expressed his fear. He frowned.
Poor, Draco. Finally had something going for him, and then that literal mind fuck, but I guess it worked out.
"You lied about seeing Potter "
Draco saw Hermione dive aside, the crackling green spell causing the overwhelming panic inside him to double. Time slowed as he stared at Crabbe.
His mother stepped back, looking as if she had been slapped.
“But why?” He whispered, not really sure of the question he was asking.
“This does not bode well Draco… there is dark magic involved in this death, though we can prove nothing. The wheels have been set into motion, something is indeed coming.” Draco was beginning to get very worried. What was coming?
Thanks for all your lovely comments, that's a source of a lot of smiles.
Draco woke angry, and dragged himself out of bed. He needed to go for a run.
“...We are very pleased to welcome back Professor Grubbly-Plank, who will be taking Care of Magical Creatures lessons; we are also delighted to introduce Professor Umbridge, our new Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher.” The pink woman stood, to a polite applause that Draco took no part in.
looking at Draco and Pansy with a surprised look on his face again. Draco mustered his courage, winked. Potter looked taken aback at that, and then frowned. Draco scoffed, amused, and turned back to Pansy. This was going to be a good night.
He looked up to see him mother crawling over to him. It was then that he noticed her red eye as well. His father had hit her in addition to choking her.
Snape stuck out his hand, and Draco placed his gift and card- which contained the short “
He and Blaise split from their mothers and vanished into the crowd, enjoying their freedom. Blaise grabbed Draco hand, and began dragging towards Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlour, saying he wanted a hot chocolate. Draco couldn’t bring himself to let go, enjoying the warmth of the hand in his, as well as the buzz he felt from their connection.
“You”
You’re kidding! Draco, did you hear that?” Draco turned to her, still feeling sick from the news he had received from his father. What would Father do to his Mother?
stupid. I thought I could hide his violent side from you. I stopped loving him and- And I only stayed because I could not bear the shame of leaving him, and I told myself you needed a father. I kept digging myself into this hole and now it’s so deep that I can’t get out--” She paused, tears welling in her eyes. Her voice had gone cold.
“Excuse me,” Draco interrupted, annoyed at the whole experience. “but what exactly are we supposed to be seeing?”
“So how come you three aren’t with Voldemort?” asked Harry, obviously buying time.
like being wrapped in packaging… “And don’t forget to keep that one safe...I’ll need it.”
“We will need the giants on our side for the coming war, Yaxley. They are stupid creatures and that makes them easier to control. Do not fail me.”
Harry looked down, blushing slightly. And Draco knew he had been right.
when Pansy and the rest of the crowd collectively gasped, and Draco looked up to see red sparks fading away from near the centre of the maze.
Troll (T)
He was startled as there was a tapping on his door, accompanied by the muffled voice of the house elf “
“C'mon kid, I heard your Mother’s wild in bed. And you know you’ll have to pay a pretty price for me not to spill your little- or should I say-
So when Draco knocked Umbridge's door for the first time- he was armed with his most charming smile.
The human mind lost logical control when faced with imminent death, and simultaneously would do anything to survive.
His mind flickered back to the signs. The conversation he had ear dropped on between Mrs Zabini and Father, where Lucious had rebuked Mrs Zabini for not keeping a good enough eye on Mother. So-
It was so intense he almost feared it.
“Of course” Snape immediately stood and summoned a brown bottle. Draco knew how disgusting it tasted already.
” peeking out from under a jacket.
Harry, ever the hero, had come to save his life.
She nodded, and once again, they fell into silence. He could barely breathe. Thoughts swirled in his head, demanding attention. It was time.
“Did you call him?”
He went back in and found a book on Legilimency and Occlumency. “
Potter was not hot.
“Is there anything else that the master should need? A meal perhaps?”
“Miss Parkinson, if you would like to share the joke that has you in such a state, please go ahead. Otherwise, sit down and be
“Any tips?” He muttered to Draco.
“I am your
"You saved me from the fiendfyre Potter" he hadn't quite summoned the courage to use Harry's name. He wasn’t a Gryffindor, "I was just repaying the debt."
He had walked in to find Blaise, Theo, Crabbe and Goyle waiting for them. The crackling of the fire was the only sound to be heard.
“Yeah well you have such long legs I have to take every chance I get, don’t I?”
His Mother tried to hug him but he shoved her away, putting his head in his hands where it felt more stable. He breathed a shaky breath. He let his hands drop.
It was as if he could not reach them… as if he wasn’t experiencing them the way he knew he should. His frown deepened, but he shook his head and and climbed onto the train after Pansy, who had given him a long hug a few minutes before. Even that had seemed subdued. Shouldn't he have felt something?
He had come out to Pansy fairly quickly after realising he was gay, and she hadn't been surprised. She had simply stated that his “sense of fashion was far to good for a straight man”
As Harry stalked away Draco found his eyes once again being drawn to his sworn enemy, his gaze slid lower, and centred on Potters rather round a- A loud sigh came from Theo who was sitting beside him.
She paused.
They stared at each other, stubbornness clear in each of their faces. Draco broke and looked away, he was not in the mood nor mental space to fight.
wasn't one of them. Anybody should feel
in his mind, directing all of his magic towards it-- and felt his body become his own again.
“How.”
“That ought to cheer you up,” he said, snickering and pointing Weasley out to Pansy.
He punched his bedpost, and pain ricocheted up his arm. The action along with the pain felt good. He hit it again.
“He’s fine, Pomfrey will have him better in no time” said Pansy, kindly patting Crabbe on the shoulder.
His father slammed against his them, shaking Draco to his core. “Very good” his father said, “But you will need to become more familiar with your walls so they can be put up faster, and then you will avoid cracks” his father proved his point by slipping through the cracks of the last bit Draco had hastily put together.
He had never attempted wordless magic but he knew the theory behind it. Draco hesitated for only a second, the fear freezing him. He shoved it aside,
They re-entered the manor and made their way to their rooms, Draco teased Blaise and playfully shoved him. “If you hadn’t strayed from the path you might have won, idiot.”
“Don't you want me here?” Harry sounded disappointed.
Snape nodded curtly. “If you ever need to talk-”
“It was just a dream, My Lord.” He didn’t dare look up and betray himself further.
They made it to the small village, and despite the Easter joy that seemed to be in the air, they were both solemn-faced. Draco pushed the door of the three broomsticks, sighing as the familiar smell and atmosphere hit him. He looked around, his father nowhere to be found.
“Of course!” Draco quickly agreed, thankful for any chance to get out of the manor.
At the end of the lesson, with nothing but a sharp call of his name, Snape summoned Draco to his office. As Draco entered the familiar space his eyes roamed the shelves which were full of odd looking jars which contained even odder looking things. He settled in the comfy seat opposite his head of house. He knew the chair was charmed to become more or less comfortable depending on how much Snape liked the person in it.
“That does not excuse you”
Upon returning to his room he walked past Blaise closed door.
“Shit, you’re not meant… you’re not meant to know that.” Fenrir looked paniked. Draco flicked his wand at the dog, making him yelp in surprise. “Fuck off” Draco didn’t even enjoy watching the beast scowl and skulk away. He could only feel the anger, consuming every part of him.
couldn’t
Well.
“Draco!”
(See the end of the chapter for
“I saw your decree this morning. I think it’s a great idea. Clubs truly can be dangerous if they aren’t regulated well.”
“I know,” Draco could practically
But there's more chapters coming soon.
“Not a word to anyone, Borgin, and that includes my mother, understand?”
Voldemort was back.
In reality Draco just needed some air as he could feel the constricting hole opening in his chest again.
“...so coming here was...difficult.’ Draco tuned in towards the end “But Mom says your house isn’t so bad.” Blaise finished.
It took a couple of minutes, but after separating the parts of his mind and building his walls, and double-checking their strength, he slowly stood up and walked towards it. It's measured pulsating sped up, it seemed to know something was happening. He wondered if it was conscious.
The loyalty of the unicorn hair inside- it felt like getting a limb back. The wand had still chosen him, despite the fact that Harry had won this wand from Draco back in the Manor. His thoughts snapped back to Harry-
Draco wished he hadn't always been such an ass to Potter, and he realised what had started out as jealousy and hatred had eventually turned into a way to get attention. He liked Potter's eyes on him.
However, upon coming downstairs and seeing a new poster on the common room message board- he changed his plans;
Voldemort was still speaking. “Come out of the castle, now, kneel before me, and you shall be spared. Your parents and children, your brothers and sisters will live, and be forgiven, and you will join me in the new world we shall build together.”
“Absolutely none of your business. And how is your breakfast this morning?”
"The Dark Lord knew it was possible to communicate over distance because of Dream Legilimency, so he structured the spell around it... It's also a very failsafe method- as no one can listen in on the conversation unless they have a blood connection to the deatheater in question, and happen to be sleeping at the time of communication."
It didn’t come with too many responsibilities, the house elves and his Mother dealt with most things.
He was so caught up in the guilt and worry for his mother, he almost missed the oaf Hagrid saying they were going to be going into the forest for the day's lesson to study a creature that “preferred the dark”
So do not worry too much about me, focus on your studies and your friends.
Crabbe didn’t notice the poor attempts at distraction. “We’re gonna be rewarded,” he took a deep breath in, looking ecstatic. “We hung back, Potter. We decided not to go. Decided to bring you to ’im.”
Two minutes later he found himself bursting into the gloomy office. The only change to the space was a few Christmas cards on Snape’s desk. He knew they would be from Dumbledore and the other teachers who got offended at Snape's lack of decorations each year.
Draco’s chest warmed with pride. Snape continued “But your father might not make that mistake, or he might find something before you are able to force him out. Keep strengthening your initial defence. And clear your mind more effectively.”
“Yeah,” said Harry, “but you, unlike me, are a git, so get out and leave us alone.”
Pansy grew very pale.
“Oh, Hello Pansy… Crabbe, Goyle, Blaise… uh- Neil.” Draco struggled not to laugh at the thought of Theo’s face at being called
As he tramped around the lake and the morning frost crushed beneath his feet, he tried to process what he had dreamed the night before. Most of it was gone but he could still hear the weird voice saying “Why am I here?” Draco shook his head… it didn't matter. There was no use giving himself a headache trying to remember a dream.
“Are you busy at the moment?” he asked, sitting on the pink fluffy seat in front of her without being asked. Her eyes widened.
and just nodded, unsure of what else he could do.
The next chapter uploaded will be 6th year, when things start to get very interesting...
Because it was
Draco looked up, wondering where it might have been destined to go, when he happened to notice Dumbledore going very pale. The other judges seemed to share this sentiment as they all began arguing amongst themselves.
itsssss 6th year!
Since they were little Pansy and Draco had been dance partners, they knew each other's moves down to the core. As he swept her around the dancefloor, Pansy smiled brilliantly. They both knew they looked amazing.
“But I was naive. Stupid.
Blaise snorted a little, leaning in closer to Drac,
“Come on, stop standing there. What’s taking you so long?” She looked concerned, at Draco’s shrug she made a face but continued “Well- there’s a
- but-- he couldn't muster any happiness. Mustering any positive feeling was difficult these days.
Draco just looked at Blaise, who was smiling at him pleasantly. Draco just gave him a tight one in return and made his way over.
“Not now Pansy” he interrupted her and began piling some eggs onto his plate. He didn’t want to deal with her mothering right this moment.
“I know, I know- you’ll be there with open arms.”
away, leaving Draco by himself as he muttered “I’m
His mother began to shake her head- Draco sighed. He had had enough, he had to get rid of her some other way.
Draco considered his words. “I swear to never again, while drunk, speak ill of the cause you follow.” He met his father's furious look. “I will say no more. You will not put me in a cage like that.” His father grunted, a furious look upon his face.
6th year! Its when everything goes to shit-  Are you ready?
Upon Draco’s entry, her head turned to meet his gaze, a small smile playing upon her lips, which were red as blood.
His aching burns and wounds no longer mattered as he ran, for his mind was once again awake with panic. Exhaustion forgotten, he forced step after step and the bottom of the stairs and skidded, then continued running towards the large doors that lead to the grounds- well, door- as one had been blasted into bits. He ran into the back courtyard- towards the exit-
“Yes?” he called, flicking his wand at the door which opened to reveal a house elf.
“Yes. He probably didn’t realise the connection was there until you said his name, which already has strong magic attached to it.”
“Tell me
His eyes opened, and the scream that had come out of his mouth was choked off as he realised he was safe. His heart thundered in his chest, and he felt as if he couldn’t breathe- but he was alive.
After sorting through all the cloaks, socks, books and whatever else his relatives thought worthy of him, Draco came to the end of the pile where his parent’s presents layed.
He knew how angry he would feel if he was in Potter’s position. Most of the wizard community didn't believe him because of the stupid newspapers, yet they were telling the absolute truth.
. All four of them slowed down to take it in, not believing this was where they ate their meals everyday. The only feature which had stayed was the enchanted ceiling, which now dusted them with a light layer of enchanted snow which disappeared upon contact. He led Pansy over to the drinks table, noticing all the eyes on them. As he poured them both some punch he began to hear the whispers. “She looked incredible” and “I can't believe how different she looked!” Pansy practically glowed besides him, until they heard “And she got Viktor Krum! How on earth did that happen?” He and Pansy looked at each other in shock. Who had gotten Krum? They both looked around, not willing to actually ask somebody.
“Manners, Potter, or I'll have to give you a detention,” Draco was careful to drawl. “You see,
Harry laughed awkwardly, then upon seeing that Draco wasn’t, stopped abruptly. “No, you're not.”
Draco sighed and let it spill out of him “He entered my dreams on the night of the Yule Ball. I- I was too tired to remember to do the meditations. He called me home. I woke up late and didn’t get to tell you.”
“Draco, this is all happening too fast.” The usually gentle voice was rougher and full of panic “You must get yourself and your mother to safety. We can keep you safe. Tell her to come-” The second sound of a portkey snapped through the air, interrupting Dumbledore.
Something was happening.
” “You, however… and Mr Zabini, could be a very useful resource and I need people I can trust...”
?!” He yelled, his fear escaping through anger.
Entranced, Draco turned with it as it slowly trotted around him- streaming light and making the broken world around it look beautiful. He found himself smiling at the magnificent creature and in response, it lifted it's head high. Its purpose served, it slowly diminished, evaporating into the air around it like mist in the morning light.
“Is she here?” He didn’t even have to speak the name. His mother nodded, a smile on her face.
He was grunting as he pushed through a pull up when a knock came at his door.
A cruel laugh echoed through his mind. And Draco couldn’t do anything, he was paralysed in fear.
They came over the top over the hill and looked down to find the usual swarm of Gryffindors awaiting them, the bright red causing Draco to sneer.
Granger raised her hand. “The only people who can see thestrals,” she said, “are people who have seen death.”
And her panic had become so bad it made the world- that was literally falling apart around her- fade into insignificance.
“This is
something had gone his way.
was also impossible.
Because of this, after a series of events including Draco fangirling over Harry Potter, the trio escape, taking Ollivander and Luna with them.
Draco looked at Pansy and saw her scheming eyes, and her excitement at the possibility of having private information. Even though everything was telling her she should be scared- She was excited. He saw his old self. The child who had not ever thought about anyone but himself. The potential Death Eater. Pansy was still like that. She was still on the wrong side.
He almost wanted to laugh at the absurdity of the situation.
you fucking asshole.” It was Blaise’s voice that held the panic. Draco burst into the room, wand out.
“Yeah I know, it’s disgusting” agreed Draco.
Something was calling his attention, he looked down and groaned again, settling on a morning walk over a cold shower to calm things down.
. And if you didn’t, none of this would happen.” He patted Draco’s shoulder, “You may stop pretending to have a relationship with Pansy now, learn to bury your memories better. And if I ever find a memory of you kissing a boy again. I
The framed picture that his mother had given him for Christmas stared out at him. There he stood, a boy from only a year ago. He was happy. And his father had his hand upon his shoulder. They were
She had not screamed or cried. She had simply found a willing Death Eater to take her to the castle as she was wandless and could not disapparate. She had promised the Death Eater she would please him greatly once they returned as payment.
Draco hated the overly sweet tart. “No thank you,” He looked over to the cauldron with the blue steam still rising from it “...but I’ll gladly have some of the potion” Barely a second went by before an enchanted book slapped the back of his head.
“What the
Each day was a struggle. Draco buried himself in his school work to distract himself. Always the knowledge that he could keep Father as happy as possible if he kept his grades up spurred him on.
Draco just stared blankly at Snape. “I have never been so frightened in my life. I learnt my fucking lesson.”
Okay so- its against Canon that Bellatrix is in this scene- I know. But I think this is one of the things the movie got right...
“Well I went to see the game between the Cannons and th-” Draco lost interest as soon as Goyle started talking, and focused on the textbook instead.
Harry slowly walked over. His eyes focused on Draco “Why am I here Draco?” He was very close. Draco didn't really know what was going on. “Why am I here?” This time Harry whispered the question. Draco shook his head.
“Where are the rest of the students?” asked Slughorn.
(See the end of the chapter for
He waited another few minutes.
“No, of course I wouldn’t, you stupid, little man, how would I look carrying that down the
“Mother.” Narcissa looked up sharply at him, obviously disliking the interruption. “I can order for myself.” He turned to the waitress who maintained an impassive face- he could feel his own burning. “I’ll have the Salmon please, but only if its fresh. If not I’ll have the risotto”
“Mastered Accio already have we Mr Malfoy? And you too Mr Nott?” The squeaky voice of Professor Flitwick came from below him and Draco looked up from his essay.
Draco was frozen for a second, processing the death, but Snape's and Dumbledore's words came back to him quickly enough.
Are you guys getting the switching perspectives? Also, how do you like Evil Draco? Borgin and Bourkes is probably the longest scene he gets... but if you like him ill put in more fleshed out scenes.
He hovered in the doorway, unsure.
“Without magic- or a broom…”
“Draco-”
Draco’s wrist burned as the spell settled on him.
Potions: O
A pause, then excitement came through the connection
“Shut up and eat” said Blaise, grinning and raising an eyebrow. Draco sighed and did as he was told with a smirk of his own.
Blaise just kinda shrugged at him, awkward “We just came in from America, she wanted to join the movement and we had no other place to go...”
He desperately searched around for anything else that could help contain the tempest in his mind as it battered itself against him.
Eventually, after several attempts, they calmed down.
He was alive.
He didn’t register the scenery as it rapidly flew by him. He didn’t notice Blaise, Pansy and Theo looking at him and each other, with concern furrowed in their features.
Draco smiled as he pulled the cloak off Potter, whose body was frozen at odd angles.
He also knew that Unicorn hair was the most difficult cores to turn to dark magic, which is what Draco told himself was the reason he had been struggling with Bellatrix when they had moved onto dark magic. He had hoped the dual nature of the Hawthorn- which favoured both healing spells and curses would help him, but it seemed the Unicorn hair was preventing him.
“Dare.”
“Who cares,” Draco interrupted, wanting to change the subject “He’s probably only doing it for attention. And besides, I think he only keeps the Mudblood around for her head and not her looks… I mean- have you seen those teeth?”
‘BY ORDER OF THE HIGH INQUISITOR OF HOGWARTS
She had not thought a dead body would do that.
Summary of Chapter:
But how? He couldn't apparate, he couldn't get home. How? Panic streaked through him before he had the realisation that Snape's office was connected to the flu network.
No wands. No Magic. The most basic of written theory. Yet he smiled at the fucking
Draco stood up.
Dinner was roasted pheasant with a lemon and mustard sauce. Draco’s Father sat to his left. Draco did not look at him. He could not bring himself to, fearing he might explode if he did. As they sat quietly eating it his mother attempted to break the silence. She looked much better than she had in the afternoon.
Draco bolted awake. He groaned when he saw the very early morning light in the windows at the top of the room. The dream that had just woken him up was slipping away. Well, he was awake now--
Pansy gasped.
have to think about Potter?
(See the end of the chapter for
He gave Pansy her present. As she unwrapped the necklace and earrings that Draco had noticed her looking at in Hogsmeade weeks back, she gasped.
He unwrapped the beautiful three-piece suit they had gotten tailor-made for him, which had a dark green silk handkerchief included. He had also been given a framed photograph of him standing with his family. The picture had been taken before Draco's father had found the memory with Cassius, it had been taken less than a year ago. They all looked happy, and proud. Well, perhaps not his Mother, but she had never expressed emotion too strongly.
Crabbe was just one more added to his list.
“Show me around the school. I mean, when I came here a week ago to get sorted and do the admin and everything they gave me a quick tour but it wasn’t very extensive and I kinda forgot everything anyway.” The word vomit ended just as quickly as it had started as Blaise realised what he was doing.
Potter's eyes changed direction and he caught Draco staring. The champions face changed from uncomfortable to surprised. Draco knew the look came from his surprise at Draco's attire. All he ever saw Draco wearing were his baggy school robes. As Potter continued to stare in obvious shock, Draco took the chance to sneer at him. He turned away to find Pansy, who was helping herself to some of Theo’s drink and put a hand on her arm “Come on, let's dance” Pansy took a gulp of Theo's drink and coughed before looking at him and dismissing him with a wave of her hand “We can't, we have to wait for the champions to lead the dance.”
So Potter had made it in.
For a second it was silent, as all in the house realised what he had done.
“Okay,” He said, smiling, then he leant in and kissed her very gently.
As they waiting for Snape outside the potions classroom, Draco confronted Blaise, “Why did my father’s owl drop a letter to you?”
He looked around at the scene before him, and then it hit him that someone was missing “C-Crabbe,” He already knew his friend's fate, “Crabbe...”
been suppressing a lot of his emotions- primarily his anger... for a long time- perhaps this was similar.
Draco repressed the snarl that rose in his throat as the anger he had so carefully restrained began battering against its walls at the sight of Potter. The mere thought of Potter had induced his breakdown earlier that morning, and the sight of him was even worse.
easier.
Madame Malkin frantically tried to cool the situation, but was making no difference. “Really, you shouldn’t accuse… dangerous thing to say… wands away, please!”
“I’ve needed you mum-- I
They made their way to a compartment and Draco floated his suitcase up onto the rack, then sat down by the window and watched as the train slowly took off, and worried parents waved goodbye to their children. He tuned out and began to focus on the thoughts swirling around his head.
