"It wasn't me..." He mumbled. "anyway, if we are done here...KREACHER!" The house-elf appeared with a crack.
He was alone. There was no one in the room with him. The only people in this house were on the floors beneath him, he was sure of it. So, where did the sound come from? Flashing teeth and claw, he looked maddly around for the source of it, before they landed on a portrait next to the wardrobe.
Blaise tensed. "I was worried about being tailed and it looks like you were the one that had to worry."
Looking at Hari for a moment, he settled back and raised his outstretched hand towards the canopy above their heads and let his dragon manifest to the surface. Fingers elongated, white scales that reflected light erupted over his skin, and claws sprouted where manicured human nails once sat at the tips of each finger.
"WAIT!" Kreacher shouted as he ran after his wayward master. Where are you going, your filthy and needs a bath." Harry looked down at himself.
Harry is stubborn. Now he’ll never be my friend. He’ll see. He’ll see how everyone else treats Weasley and mud-blood's like that Granger, was it, and come crawling back to my side. First I’ll have to get rid of these louts, Crabbe and Goyal. No, Father said they’ll keep the heathens from attacking me in their jealousy. DAMN! Harry Potter will be my friend, mark my word.
; you’ve both matured too much. Still loyal, but the strengths of the spells cast with either not be as strong or unravel over time. Not suitable for wizards as magically strong as you two.” Mr. Ollivander hummed in his throat eyes raised to the ceiling, and hands on hips. “We’ve tried quite a few wands the last time you were here, but now I see you take more after your mother than your father. We’ll try the same…he trailed off wandering off in the process, “Give this one a wave.”
When Muggles began hunting Witches and Wizards in what they called, “Witch Hunts” in the late seventeenth century, the newly formed Ministry of Magic passed the International Statue of Wizarding Secrecy which hid the Wizarding communities from the Muggle communities. Any witches or wizards who revealed themselves to Muggles would face swift punishment including having their wands snapped. The Malfoy’s would have to cease all involvement with Muggle aristocracy, or risk losing their standing and position of influence within the Ministry. The Malfoy’s preservation instincts were strong even then, and they removed their existence form the Muggle community; keeping all their possessions, and even stopped their expansion efforts. The Malfoy Manor and its lands, as it is seen today have remained unchanged; with the exception of much needed updates in plumbing and gas, unplotible and invisible to Muggles.
The leek jumped Tom in the neck and bit him, a fountain of blood poured out an splashed on the grund.
Ebubu chuckled, dis scull was so perv, in every possivle wasy. She thought about the time she, draci and vampirt cayme togetheas and all her teachers wantinh to fuck her and Lopiun and Snake takin Videos of her naked ans so in..
„Gt outta my wy!!"Enobyshooted at some of the kids who ran ofer the floirs. She had beenlurkin at the door of the infirmary were Draco sat woth Vampire.
She made her haair in a bun and slipped in an oversized black shirt with a white crescendmoon on da front, black ripped shorts, black knee socks and blacklaquer plateau boots. She put on dark violet lipstick, nearly balckbut glancing in the light with a ceratain shimmer of violet. Blackeyeliner and violet nails and long black earrings in form of acrescend moon too completed her look. She took her black leatherbasckpack from the door and hushed outside, hopping not to wake upher roommaze.
„Were alr8.“. Ron answerd. „Butt we dunno where vampire and draco are or ryan and Neville or anyone else, wave lost 'em.“
The lesson seemed as it wouldnt end to the girls, something was just odd about having classes when there was like a war goin on and they felt like floating in a constatnt state of danger.
„Hav u lost a bat or somethin or why do ur lips look like theyr only purpose of excisting is to cause eye-cancer to veryone who has to look at it?“, hissed Jinx.
Not just that they still didnt kno how to deel with the leak, there were also rumors that they thought of closing down Slytherin( for it was the house with a bad aura), or even Hogwarts as a whole because it would become too dangerous. It wuz not cleer, if the mutation of the leeks may also spread to other plants – or creatures! The forbidden forest was widely known for bein dangerous and inhabiting mythical creatures, who knew whaot wood happen or whot this dark magic could create out of these already horrifying creatuerres!
„What the fucking bloody hell is wrung with y'all?! What did appen 2 all mycool goff friends? Why are y'all acting weird?!"
The leek jumped to Ryan and she kicked it away, some parts of the leek were teared apart nd the leek was only half and had just one eye left, because the other eye sticked on ryans shoe.
She nearly had forgotten how tit felt to bee kissed, her last boyfriend had been a real asshole and head betroyed hr and since then she decided not 2 have a boyfriend anymore, this was 4 years ago now...
„CRAP! GOYLE!“ she screamed for quite a while, and walked in the direction she thought they had come from before they built their hut fr the night.
„But whos dis otta guy?“, hermoine asked. Ryan went silent, she couldnt confirm it fort hey coulddnt c his face yet, but she wuz afraid it wuz her ex-boxfriend Jordan.
„Hello.“, she said, still confused how she ended up here and not in the mood for giving a moody answer.
She nearly cried, she felt so safe with him, especially after the encounter a few minutes ago, she really had to hold back her sobs.
„Huh...“, he sighed. „You must think im a total jock, good for nuthin but quidditch and looking good.“
“Oooh, another handsome boi.”, the other black haired one said and pranced over too Jordan. She linked her arm with his and looked up at him as if he was the hero of a bad anime.
She smirked to herself, it was not possible for anybody else to „fall“ into the other dimension because she set u the time turner and the letter-spell especially for Ebon<.
Ryan aslo looked behind them, her eyes glass like, hate, but also fear and insecurity raging in the,
„It's called Cybergoth."Hermine explained. „All dis gurl on beaxbatonns were so lame withtheir gothik- or punk stuff lookalike."
„I dont kno.“, Jinx said, with a certain glance in her eyes.“Maybe i can fid out tho.) She looked around„Oh“ she looked at the other end of the great hall. „Theres Tina, I‘ll ask her.“  Jinx walked over to the hufflepuff girl with glasses (c chapter 2). The girl wore a long black dress and a black cape.
„Vampire!" she screamed, blod pouring outta her eyes. The red liquid dropped from her chin on her pink corset and short leather shorts.
"Wo the fuck do you think you are, lil witch?" Drake spit. "Dont youever dare again talk to my bae like dis again!"
"The food is quite good, but id rather eat at our room, you have to tellme what you did over da hollydays," Ryan mumbled, eating chocolatecookis with choco-spiders on em.
red shorts, blacj fishnets and black laquer boots-.. She made a bun with her blonde hair with blue tips and then played a game on her mobile-phone.
Then, suddenly she heard that scriechin noise again, witch had woken her up, she looked around in the nfirmary, but there was nothing but shaduwz and mere light.
Neville and some others begann attacking the leeks before they could hurt the piknicking students who were running away and try to fleed.
And Harry waznt sure whot 2 thing of any o dis. He didnt wanne talk, but the silence also felt oppressing, depressing....
Shed ben in the forest with crabb and coyle and then suddetly she wuz here, in another timeline?! Smh. But how?
"Good, this applies to all of you", he said to the others. "Now let's begin... Potions and Magic Past(r)ies. It's an art to be able to bake and brew perfect magical foods and, on the other hand, very difficult. It requests concentration, practice and interest. To hook your attention from the very beginning we will begin with something you all may now – Bubbleblubbs."
Ryan ihaled and wanted to shout at him again, when he just tilted forward, because Tina hit him with her (very big and very heavy) book.
„You go guuurl!“, Tina said pointing at Ryan with fingerguns (AN: yes, bear with me). Tina wore a light grey blouse and dark grey jeans with dusky pinnk coloured sneakers and a pendant with a white crystall. She had short street-mutt blond curly hair. She also hadfreckles and wuz all in all not goffik at all.
„Alright.“ Dumdledor and flipped his beard over his shoulder. „I will call Lupin and Hagrid, they will be able to find them for sure!“
„Devil darnit.“, she said and looked at  her book. „Hope I didnt damage it.“ She run her fingers across the cover, decided everything was alright and looked at ryan.
Hewent to classes, as the normal school-programm continued as if nothinhappened. He entered the classroom for
She had set her trap up as she was wandering through the woods with drace to find the otthers. Draco had no idea what she was doin, just as harry and ron he was just like under-average as a student and did not know even like half of the spells and curses that Hermoine did.
„It was an accident,Professzr."; Vampirt said. „Im not sure whot was inside thisbrew, but the effect was nit the intended one."
„C’mon who doesnt want to learn everything about stuff that was so long ago that not even our 400-year old ghost teacher has actully witnessed it), she said.
She shivered again, she wuz wearin just a black ripped jeans, black boots, a blck shirt with a witchy prit on da front, black woolen cuffs and a wool coat, but she froze, it was gettin cooler because winter wuz ahead.
Draco could hear the noises from the quidditch-field, as he sat in the infirmary to visit vampire. He was as white as sthe sheets, and he couldn't look away from the big bloody wound on his cheek, the one on his chest was covered with bandages. He merely breathed, Draco took his hand, as he heard the screaming of the students from afar. He stood up and locked outta windu.
Beneath the wardrobe stood Ryans dressing table, with an oval mirror framed with floral embellishments. The whole furniture was painted all black and was completely overloaded with Ryans make-up stuff, which was like over 20 differently shaded and coloured lipsticks (from dark red to dark violet to brown to black and white) and more stuff. Hermione didn't even know what it was all good for..
Maybe this wuz just a fake time turner that didnt work, maybe it wuz a trap fro hermoine and she just wanted to wait until ebony uses it, just to laigh at her when it did not work….
They went for zhe great hall where also all the otter (gettit??!) studentsheaddid. They passed the door and all over their head flew burningcandles, (so fuck Brandschutzmaßnahmen! [2]). They set down besides acouple of gothic boys and a gay couple that was soop cut kissing. Towards Hermin and Ryan sat Ebony,Drace and Vampirt.
„I know, nevertheless, Im sorry but youre so beautiful and sexy.“, he siad flirtingly. „I dreamt about kissing u sonce u arrived here.“
“Oh, dear, I’m not talking about “boys like him”, but about the boss-jock himself...”, Tina pointed out, adjustung her glasses. “He isn’t so bad btw, its mostly acting I think, but we’re going off tipoc, aint we? Iwas just thinkin, he had this accident… and… his broken bones heal so fuckin slowly”
All students, regardless of age or house, scurried across de floors,afraid of the murderouuus creature.
After this bitch had arrived everything at this scool had turned strangeand unusual – Vampire acted strange, as well as Draco!
Ryan stepped out of the door, she had wished a shortcut to the infirmary and the room of requirements helped her get there.
„Yeah, bt they may be not on the verge of death because of a walking leek that somebody accidently brought to life.“.
They stood up and ebony did not know what to say, she just looked at themgoin away with lots of food on their plates.
In front of it, waiting for Professor McGonagal stood diverse other students, among othersthere stood Ron- eh, Dioblo.
„So here we are.“, said Dumbledoor as they reached the forest. „Got toghether in ur grups and then – have fun“ He flung his arms in the air.
„Why is that btherin u? Don‘t u want me anymore just because I dont want to be a porrly written gothic-character anymore?“, Harry turned around and looked him straight in the eyes.
Now she remembered! She went with ron to his rom because she wouldnt go alone to hers! And Ryan was in the infirmantry with Neville who had been attacked by a leek!
Dumbledoor( goddit) (← hah, gettit? Im so funnx if u seay somedng else stopflamingzz) stood n fornt of the audence and began talking stuff andthen Mrz Mcgonugul ccame with the magical hat and the kiddos weresorted in the houses. Whe finished, dumblidork talked about the newteacher willy vunko who began dis year with teaching and snape nowbeing teacher for dark-arts.
"I think that ould be a goof ideea, I mean we all could think about us and how we wannt it to go on...", Vampire thought and looket outta da windu. "I hope she undastand, bshe sh++has so many proböems at de moment..."
Ebony looked at him shooketh, none of her teachers ever dared to give her astonishment for being late, bettah to say they didn't because they al hopped to sleep with her because she was so sexah.
„I understand, you always were more a special type, not alone in clothin'", Ryangrinned. „Hey, did ya hear whos the new teacher here at schol?"
She wanted to hiss on them but was too exhausted and confused to say somethin, she held her head in her heands.
"I'm not sure, they brew some sort of potion and gave it to the plant and that leek grew veryfast and was really big and then it ran away!"
„We‘ll never get outta here are we?“, asked Draco, freezing because it wuuz shady and dork in the furest.
She lifted her gaze and now recognized the girls, they were te beauy ateon girls that bullied hermoine ealiers.
Satan couldnt stahp staring a th4t strang3 gurl in the bed nxt to him. She seamed confused when thee met this day, but as sonn as theyd been alone she tried to seduce him or someh´thin? She tried tob e sexy in her school.unifurm or so and wuz like, soooo what do we do now???111!
Tears were streaming down her face as she ran off, Neville shouted something, but she didn’t hear it, she didn’t want to hear it, to hear excuses and lies.
„Wait,I want 2 help 2!", he said, gasping, as he had been running downthe hallway and still having pain from his injuries.
The small razor blade flew out of ebonys hand through the room into vamires hand, cutting himself. „Fuck!" he screamed.
„Ignitium!"Novell shouted and the leek catched fire and screames, but still continued following the girl. Neville jumped heroically from his broomstick and kicked the leek away be4 it could reach her. She fell on the ground and looked up-
Ron was busy writing, also trying to distract himself from the bad vibes his thoughts caught upon. Rather successfull.
it was pitch black inside the forest, the small light of the lamp didnt help much, as they stumbled over roots and sticks ans stones.
Thats what she thought, her view slowly wandering to Ron, who was by now talking too Drago who had just arived.
They waited for Hermine and Jinx who wanted to spy on the teachers who had a discussion in Dumbleborks room about how to deal with the leek, which was still at large.
He hesitated... should he go and sit nesxt to her? Where was her friend?Would Ryan come to class or was she skipping it today?s
"Ohmy, I love bubbleblubbs," Ryan grinned at hermoine. "But im so bad at beking even regular baking-thingz."
In dark blue ink wuz to be read „This is a Time Turner. (A/N it turns time, if you couldn‘t tell) You can travel back in time what do you wish had never happened?“
„Thanks, Ma'am.", Ron said, slightly emberrassed because he did not mean to ask it out soloud. Hermine could even see from her seat that he became a littlered on the cheecks.
„Oh, expensive does not equate having good taste.“ Jinx raised her eyebrows and the girl gasped angrily.
Her eyes flew over the mass of students and hung by a smoll grupe of gothics. It was Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and her boyfriends Draco and Vampire.With them stuud Diablo, who shed better known as Ron, before hebeacame sorta weird cause of all this pseudo-goffic-satanist- things.
“Sooooooo, Neville, I heard you were still singel, yeh?” Fleir blinked her eyelashed and looked at neville, who still had a few days in the infirmary. She took his hand.
"Hon,maybe you should listen and not staring in the air the whole class long," Drakp said with a comforting and depressed voice.
„Sure, I wanted to save a little so I could grow more night-black plants.", Ebony answeredas if this had been the most stupid quession in de univers. [
Voldemint was a popular brand witz mint'flavoret cigarettes,bonbons, etc. She also owned a black shirt with the classic Voldemint-lattering on the front and a skull out of silver-colorued sequins on da back. She wore dis shirt rigt now, with it a black leather-jeans and black combat-boots with matching neongreen Shoelaces witch (gettit1) had lill silver skull on the ends.From her ears hanged big black earringz whoze motif was a death-moth. Around her wrists were severus band-armchins.
„Oh Professur Mcgoogle.“, Satan said as thex entered the great hall and nearly bumped into the vice-principal.
Ryan wore an oversized plain black shirt, black overknees and black boots with a 6cm heel, she had some black hairties around her waist to make a bun later in class for potions & pastries.
"I also think shes annoying, just complaining and hating agsinstHermoine," Vampire said and shook his head. "Se has to get overthe fact that she isnt the inly hot gal at hogwarts anymore."
Tina wore arust coloured vintage dress withyellow boots, looking like the impersonalisation of a cottegecore dream. Jinx wore a red velvet dress with hood, the hood draped fluently over her blue wavy hair. She wore a koining red lipstick and rded fake lashes.
"Assholes.", Ryan said. "They think they're sooo cool and sooo special." She shookher head. "Especially that lil whore Ebony, she fucks with likeevery boy who finds her attractive."
But as soon as she had left Ebonty chatted about her in the whole school what a whore sheallegedly was and that Ebony never thought she was even goff enoughto be her friend. She also told some people that Hermine tried tosteal her boyfriend dRAKKE away and Ebony fought her and that thishad been the cause for her leavung.
Because of the escaped mutant leek there now was a case of emergency and there were newsafetyy masures taken.#
Today subject was about spells castet inside bakery goods as a liquid core. Mostly used for counter-curses and as medicine against certain poisons.
“Ryan what’s wrong?”, he asked and set up again, although his painkillers wore off and it hurt a lot to move.
„But we cant wait one or two days for anybody to arrive, we need to find them NOW, before more things happen!“, Professur Mcgonogol said.
"Oh my goth every year da sam shit, always dose stupit prepsz and littlekids I just want to go to my romm, relly." Erbony said gothicly androlled her eyes. She wore a black bandeau vokuhila-dress and violetfishnets and combat boots and wore red eyeshadow and red lipstick.Vampire next to her on sa left word black jeans and a black shirt. Hetook a ashort look to hermine, they were friends before she leftskull, but he also wasnt interested in her anymre now.
After a long hour of searching and not findung them, they took a short break. They sat down on a fallen tree, it ws really cold out here and hermine freezed.
„Since youre living in this forest, do u know where the leek is or the leeks?“, Neville asked. „They are mutated and murder the students.“
"Yeah, mybe.... maybe we should just have sorta "pause", I mean that we pause our three-relationship?"
"Asshole!" she hissed and went to her place in the last row. Beside her Draco and Harry and on the other side some Hufflepuff girl she didn't know.To Ebony she looked like a tital [E/N: typical?] nerd with her stupid glasses and stuff.
Huh, it was always a pleasure to watch her read, Isora though, sideeying her friend , to not be too obvius.
He flew to her to help, she tripped over and the leek came closer and closer and she coul not stand up because she sprained her ancle.
Dr Devorak again send them on a journey about food, leeches, alcohol, how centaurs shuld be classified as insects because of their 6 extremities and how hey could also be funghi, hedgehog goulash and it’s meaning for the ogre population, the ogre wars, pie crusts and chickens.
Night sunk over the castle of Hogawarts and after making nasty remarks about ebony and the booyz, some time of thinking and finally deciding to go watch the quidditch match tomottor after school, Hermoine and Ryan went to bed.
“C’mon let’s go somewhere more fun.”, saud one of the blckhaierd girls and they somehow complimented and flirten Jordan out of the room.
„What is wrong with u? First this scene with ebony and now you're so bitchy talkin 2 me?!2, Draco wuz angry and hurt.
„Suicide is no option, we talked about dis 1million times! Dont belittle deathan depression! Goddamit, we were there for u but I think now its timeto MOVE ON! AWY FROM U!"
] pins withskulls and bats on them. Her black eyeloiner wuz smugded, as well asher blood red lipstick.
It had felt so good, but... she wuz sure he doesnt mean it, she didnt want 2 be a number on the long list of gurlz he had been kissing or having sx with or somehting...
Actualy, most of the time they had been silent, an uneven silence that Draco hated but did not know how to end.
He heard about what happenedd to Vampire, but he couldnt bring himself to go to the infimrary to see how he was doing.
“Well and there’s also her ex, who tries to get near her again….”, Fleur cntinued, unbothered by Neville slowly loosing his temper.
„Im gonna kill muself you funking bastards!" she screemed and theycould hear her search a razor or knife or somethin.
It wuz a weird situstation for the Quidditch-players because they culdnot help and didnt know whot to do.
And then more leaks broke through the other grandstands and ran on the field. The grandstand of our Slytherin girls was so broken, it fell over!
„oh, its u, oh yeah... ill be fit in a couple of days again, hah.“, he said nervously. „Ryan is okay, she didnt get hurt. I think she fell asleep la while ago“
They hadnt talked or even looked at each other when they went upstairs intheir room, finally having some free space of their, beloved butannoying girlfriend.
„Yes it was, and being depressed is not „Gothic" or „cool" orsomething anybody wants to achieve.", Diablo/Ron said.
It was a wild ride between the story of the plague, the possible influence of the plague on the development of dark arts and alchemy, diverse herbs, goats, leeches and the fact that you can’t see your shadow in the dark.
They sat outside on a small ruin near the black lake, the sun slowly sat as they stared to the horizon.
“Well.. thut wuz awkwarrrrddddd.”, Jinx mumured; she wore her hair lue and in space buns, she wore shorts with studs on them, a black shirt that resembled a corset, blue fishnets, black botts, a fluffy black bag and nude lipstick (A/N keepin’ it classy ya know).
But Dumbledore didn't answer, he couldn't because a student ran in and yelled: „Vampire Potter has was attacked by de leek!"
Ron looked at hiimself in the mirror and removed his thick black eyeliner. He didnt want to be friends with the gothic-clique anymore,it had been a phase and a really dumb one too.
"What a long long skull day," Ryan said, stretching after the transformation-lesson. Today they learned to transform magicily in to othr creastures like cats, wolfes and so on.
Drace couldnt help but smirking at this stupid scenario, ebony doing siómething stupid and bringing every1 else in trouble 2.
„Especially Lucyus Malfoy will not be happy to hear his son is declared lost for now.“, said Severus wh had just been appearing in the rom.
"Heyo," Hermine said when she poked Ryan, who wuz waitin for her in the great hall. Todayshe wore a black top with a deep v-neck which exposed the harness-braunderneath sexily, and a black skirt and black boots and black cuffson her arms. Her long black haer fell over her back in smmoth waves.
we're back with a brand new chapter of your all time favorite series My Immortal-My sweet Unvalentine!
.  Hari either didn’t see the eye-roll or chose to ignore it. “They need sunlight, and water, and nurturing care to survive. You see, in order for them to thrive and produce more buds, the old dried up ones have to be cut away.”
"Wizard." Draco corrected, rolling his eyes. "I look like I run around with nickers and pantyhose on."
He was clearing malnourished and battered when I saw him in August. Maybe I should revisit that Giant theory. He is always around that great oaf, half-giant.
I watched through our connection as Voldemort gave him a task to complete upon his initiation into his ranks and with its completion a promise with veiled threats. He was to kill Albus Dumbledore and Voldemort would then free his father from Azkaban. Kill the Headmaster and his family will have their honor restored amongst the inner-circle. The veiled threat was, fail and his father will never get out of Azkaban alive; fail and he and his mother will die. Malfoy, once proud to final have joined the adults and become a Death Eater, was ambitious enough to believe that he could easily kill Professor Dumbledore and restore his family's honor to its former glory. In actuality, it was a fool's folly, because Voldemort had set him up for failure, he does not give second chances, and is not merciful.
“Brilliant, but I just recalled something,” Hari said puzzled. “Hermione told me the first time she met that she’s already tried simple spells and they worked out for her…How was she able to do so? She grew up with Muggle parents.”
“Well, I was orphaned at my Muggle relatives. So I wouldn’t have that particular advantage would I? In fact, I’ve nearly been expelled a few times for using magic at my aunt’s house. I got off with a warning during the summer before second year, because a house-elf used a levitation charm and I was blamed for it. It belonged to the Malfoy’s. I still have no idea how it got the idea to get me expelled so I could be safe.”
Draco didn’t expect the hesitant return press of lips and their almost shy movement against his. The kiss only lasted a moment, before the cold began seeping in and he had to pull away far sooner than his liking. Hari let out a small sound of protest. With eyes closed, his lips blindly sought out Draco’s retreating ones, and his body moved forward without thought.
Sanderson tilted his hat in a salute as he put it on. The bell above the door jingled as he stepped out into the morning. Nic hurried after him to turn the sign to open and once more open the blinds on the door to start his work day a little later than usual, but worth it, he thought.
Harry thought astonished. The two house-elves saw him, squeaked in surprise when they saw him lying on the grass in the sun. "You be Master Harry Potter, sir? I is Dot, this is Kocoa, Master Draco and Mistress Narcissa's house-elves. Where does Master wish us to store their things." Dot had the courage to speak up first and ask.
“Good choice, sir. Can’t say I ever had any myself Master, but ol’ Kreacher here, fine education in what Spirits to bring to the party. Hard stuff here, and Wines and Champagnes in the cellar.” Never mind that Kreacher was no longer that crinkly old and smelly house-elf, but rejuvenated and young looking. ‘He would probably never get over talking like an old man, er elf’.
Focussed on the pale gold light in the cauldron, he nearly forgot that they had to close and exit the circle. Hasty he moved,  stumbling over his feet, he moved clockwise, the rings of smoke settling into the grass with a faint dewy outline.
Harry meets a certain blonde prat we all love. Kaa, seriously, stops eating owls. At least long enough that Harry get a chance to read one letter.
“If you’re worried about my clothes not fitting, don’t be. I can spell them to fit.” Draco said as he got up off the messy bed and took a wistful breath in hopes of catching Hari’s scent, but only smelling cold snow. He frowned, displeased.
You would think that oaf knows enough about dragons to feed it the right type of subsidence, wouldn't you? No feeding a Ridgeback raw cow meat. No, Ridgebacks eat marine life. Whale fat and blubber at this age, crustaceans, the like. Then larger animals as it grows. Idiot.
Maddening enough, you know what he said when I blurted out Harry's name. He said, and I quote. "God damn it, Draco you need to stop obsessing over that Potter boy already. It's not healthy."
The man's eyes narrowed. He had what some might call the devils good looks with dark tousled hair, expressive brown eyes flanked by long eyelashes, a slight mustache over cupid boy lips, and a days growth of stubble over chin and cheeks. Those expressive eyes were narrowed in what Draco knew to be angered seeded from fear and his cupid bow lips changed from a frown to a snarl.
Draco must have seen the disappointment on Hari’s face. “A wizarding village is out of the question with the current state of things.” Hari honestly never even considered a wizarding village to go shopping, but what was Draco on about?
Raised off the earth in the center of the lawn, the altar was draped in a golden cloth, decorated with oakleaves, flowers of every hue of red, orange, and yellow; predominate by sunflowers, and an abundance of summer fruit and vegetables.
Hari coughed as dust made it into his airway and Draco could only stand astounded with jaw dropped. Hari felt the unexpected chuckle burst forth. Hearing the masculin laugh, Narcissa turned around to see her son and Hari back from their date.
"Oh I plan to have fun." Draco replies. He grabs Hari's hand, pulls him in, twirls, and then has his arm around Hari's shoulder.
"What are you suppose to be?" Draco finally caved and asked Arlys, as not one but two hackneys pulled up outside the salon.
Draco buried his face against Hari’s warm chest and took a deep appreciative whiff of Hari’s scent, hoping to catch something other than the disappointing smell of snow and soap. He forced out a weak chuckle, “Saint Potter.”
“He only got off because you testified for him!” He needed to drill that into Hari’s thick skull. “He still did horrible things, criminal things. He took the Mark, for one, and fought on You-Know-Whose side of the war. ” Bill tried to reason with the very angry green eyed boy in front of him. He just couldn’t see how Hari could defend Malfoy after how he was treated in school by him.
A golden crown shimmered like a halo over her dark head of pleated braids. Gold beads danced at the ends of her hair when she walked. Upon her chest, two golden wings spread from the center of her muscular chest to circle her broad shoulders. The long valley of her torso swirled and glinted with each movement. The skirt was formfitting, but only until mid-thigh before flaring out in sheer lace train. The train of her dress looked like golden lace peacock feathers.  Her icepick heels, gold of course, were laced up mid shin.
"This adorable little guy is my godson, Edward Remus Lupin." Harry said in a baby voice that was disturbing when his deranged Aunt Bellatrix did it, but did something else completely for Draco when Potter spoke like that to his godson. Then he did something that freaked him out. He walked right over to him, ignored his halted breath and stiffening shoulders and placed the slightly squirming baby into his arms. "Malfoy, meet your cousin, well second cousin, actually. This is your Aunt Andromeda's grandson, Edward. We call him Teddy. Teddy Bear" Harry said affectionately to his godson, "meet your cousin, Draco. I hope you two get along, but if you throw up on him that would be a riot."
I was walking with Crabbe and Goyle to the Training Grounds for our first flying lessons when the incident happened; of course I already know how to fly. I was never able to get Father to buy me a broom though, apparently Father isn’t that easy to bully. I was walking behind Harry and his trio of friends, Granger, Longbottom, and the Weasel, pretending like I was actually a part of their group when Longbottom dropped his Remembrall. I snatched it up. No one even noticed. Harry had been ignoring me since Hogwarts Express. It was time to let “Operation Get Harry Potter To Pay Attention To Me” commence.
Draco turned his head slowly towards the sound, seemingly unhindered by the intrusion on his private space. "Hari..." He breathed out, eyes slightly unfocused before snapping to attention. His whole posture changed as he uncurled from his perch on the windowsill. "What are you doing here?" Draco's voice sounded harsh, even to his own ears.
Alleycat smiled almost impishly. "Very good, Prissycat. Yeah, I guess I am. Kaa here was just telling me that you smell of old magic. You're a witch, too?"
Draco pointed a finger at his mother, “You’d think that…anyone at Hogwarts would say we hated each other. We fought constantly, I tried to get him into trouble many times, and I took every opportunity to make a fool out of him, but…”
It wasn’t easy, but Draco tried to steer the conversation  very difficult for Draco to keep his mouth shut, but he changed the subject. Reaching across the space between them to caress the feathers along the outside of the owl's facial disc near her hidden ears. “Do you have a name for this pretty girl?”
"He recognized us. I don't know who he is or what he wanted, but I had to get you out of there. We have to go." Draco said.
I want to openly cheer for the Harry, but I am torn in two from what I want to do and what is expected of me. I am expected to cheer for Slytherin and show my house loyalty. Only Slytherin cheers for our team. The other three Houses will cheer for Gryffindor. Harry is Gryffindor. What is one silent voice in a sea of hundreds screaming fans? How I wish I were allowed to cheer him on as well.
“Harry Potter,” Kreacher spoke up finally, voice high and squeaky. “I no longer wish to serve anymore masters but you, sir. You saved my life, you healed me. Kreacher is a better house-elf now. You healed me, I was corrupt, like this house was by dark magic. You, with Light magic, purified this house and me. You punish my intolerable behavior, killed the old me, and bring me back to life. I serve you and your family for life.” With a final head bob, Kreacher put an end to all that being freed nonsense. Pouring a glass of water to clear his master’s palate.
Severus slimmed the lid of the trunk. "Minerva, I don't have time to deal with a spoilt child, who ran away from home..." Severus turned away to gather some other item, but Minerva grabbed his shoulders with surprising strength.
Life was too short for what ifs and maybes. Harry didn’t survive his entire adolescence fighting a deranged murderer focused on world dominance and immortality, like some 1980 Muggle super villain. Harry certainly hadn’t survived a war, the killing curse twice, to wallow in self-pity. ‘I should see a psychologists, or a Mind Healer? -No’ With a shake of his head, Harry nixed that thought before it could take serious root. That’s all he needed, that damned Rita Skeeter getting a hold of that story. Harry could read the headline now:
Hari stood up and looked around the garden. Yes, it was magical. It was like a little oasis within a city of concrete. Here within the protection of charmed walls, the Muggle world didn’t exist and the wizarding war never touched it. It was his perfect sanctuary.
"What is the meaning of his Harry, why am I barred from entry?" Kingsley booming voice came from the fireplace.
"Alice, please call me Alice, Hari. Sheryl is the only one to get away with that name." The spikey haired girl replied.
his mother told him that is the main smell all underage witches and wizards had. Fresh and clean like new snow, but cold to the touch, so don't. It appeared to have the opposite effect on Draco, because Harry didn't smell like anything, like he didn't belong to anyone, it made Draco want to scent him, to warn others away.
With a jolt back to reality, Draco awoke to realize his room on fire, his two house-elves, Kocoa and Dot trying desperately to wake him up, and get him dressed into soot stained but as of yet burnt clothes. For once Draco didn’t care about his appearance, what clothes he was wearing, or if his hair was neat. He jumped out of what remained of his smoking bed, slipping on the sooty garments, Draco hastened to reach his mother's side. He was not worried about getting burnt, after all he is partially dragon, thanks to his mother’s creatures’ blood passed down to him, but rather having a beam fall on him.
After Hari finished preparing breakfast and spent guilt free thirty minutes with his godson, who was getting quite good at lifting his head and looking around. He was still little and couldn’t do much, but oh what he could do with his godson he loved every moment of it. For instance, Teddy loved staring at his face, well that was true with everyone, but he wanted to delude himself that his godson thought of him special. He would often spend a lot longer with him singing, rocking, and tickling his hands and feet to see them clench and kick as if walking. He was positive that one of these days Teddy would soon be walking on air. When he brought that up to Andromeda, she tittered with Narcissa like school girls. Narcissa said soon Teddy would be able to see in color. Andromeda chimed in that once Nymphadora started seeing color, she would not only change the shape of her nose to match whoever was holding her, but she would often change her eyes and hair to match them as well.
"Secondly, the item you took was a dark artifact that was actually corrupting the magic of the ley lines that the bank was built on, when you removed it many of gringotts natural defences were strengthen as was the magic we goblins possess. I ensure you, breaking in to and getting away with stolen treasure will not be possible in the future, by anyone, let alone you again." The chieftess gave Harry a stern look, and Harry had no control of his facial muscles as he gave an impish smile in return, before grimacing.
were a part of that, I might add. It’s in all the papers; the whole school knows and is whispering behind his back, or giving him dirty looks. He comes home for the summer, hoping from a reprieve, only to come home to a very displeased Voldemort. I know what a displeased Voldemort feels like; he would often mirror his emotions to me. It is not a pleasant experience. Voldemort is angry, livid even, and willing to take it out on the remaining Malfoy’s. He wants to kill them. He intends to kill them, actually. Bellatrix, deranged psychopath, Bellatrix still wants her sister alive if anything else and has a better idea. Initiate Draco into the fold, make him a Death Eater, and if he completes his task set out to do by the end of the school year; he and his mother live. Voldemort set Draco up for failure. Yeah, pisses you off doesn’t it Draco?” Hari said over his shoulder somehow catching Draco’s in drawn breath.
“Teddy…” Harry’s vision blurred and his mind went fuzzy and he heard what Kreacher was saying through a haze of fog.
“Fuck off!” Jinx and Hermoine had to hold back each other to not gu straight to the thorauht of tdesi girls.
„Because I didnt know either.“, Professur Mcgonoggal said. „Professur Dumdlekork didnt tell me anything, I also am afraid nothing is prepared for her.“ She shook her head.
“You know neville, you’re someonce specail…. And you’re really special 2 me….” Fleur sighed, looking down. “Maybe this  not te riht timer, but… I like you… You are…. Special ….”
„He‘s such a douchebag, we‘re gonna fuck him up, if he ever tries anything ever again.“ Tina said. „We‘ll smear his brain on the dungeon walls, if neccessary.“
They stopped walking and t was dead silent, there was no single noise in this forest, just their breathing, leaving small white clouds in the air because it was so cold.
Although he wuz da house-leader he didnt really kno how to act around people, especially girls. They always tried to come near him just because he wuz so powerful and a really outstandin magician. And da boys either thought he wuz gay or were afrid of him or thouht he was some sorta geek or somthn. So all in all he wasnt really popular, although he wuz da house leader and he didnt rely hav friends.
„Severus, it doesn'tpay!" he said. Today he was wearing a black shirt with whitesplatters all ver it because he thought that was a thing the youngkidz would think was cool. [A/N: None of the studentsor his collegues thought it was cool. He's the goddamn headmaster forF*cks sake!]
Fleur culdnt hide her devilish smile, as she walked through the emptyy hallwas of this goddarned old school. This building had nothin compared to boatbatonx, this school felt old and weak, just like their haedmister.
But he had no time for more self-pity because class started as Mr. Wuwonka nearly flew into the classroom.
„You seem distracted, whot are you thinkin about?“, Ryan asked and flipped a flat stone over the lkes surface.
Then, suddenly, there was a strange noise in the ear and then, the mutated leek broke through the grandstand of the teachers!
So they went 2 history class, but weren#t quite interested in the subject. Hermoine thought about viktor krum all the time, she was worried about Ryan.
Hermoine and Jinx sat in the fourth ro and were chattng, Harry and Draco sat in the third row, one empty seat between them, they didnt look at each otter and didnt talk; and Ron sat alone at the end of the second Row.
They got up. Ryan wore a black knotted blouse so one culd c her belly (which wuz of course super flat and trained, just because), she wore a dark anthrazit coloured jeans and black doc martens. She ore thick black eyeliner and long black lashes and some nude matte lipgloss. Hermoine wore a long black hoodie with an even longer red shirt underneath, black tighs and blck plateau boots, she wore her mint green hair in a bun and wore black eyeliner and dark brown lipstick on her lips.
„Try to remember thestuff you poured in it, kiddos, we need to know to maybe find out howwe can defeat the evil vegetable. And what did exactly happen? Maybewe can find out what is the plan of the leek."
Ryan was wearing a long dark blue dress with white stars and moons printed on it, and because oft he deep neck she wore a black mesh-top underneath and above a thin black cardigan. She wore her black hair in braids which she had wrapped around a headband, and wore silver moon earrings and a silver nose ring. She had put on dark blue eyeliner to metch her dress
„Damn.“, said professur mcgonogal at the end of the lesson. „Since miss ravebway is missin, the class is much mot´re quite and we somehow have a better work attitude here. Well so it also has its good side “ she looked around. „if anyone asks, i never said that.“
„Ssssshhhhhh“, said Ryan. She acknowledged hermoines hate towards krum, just because he wuz da best frind of her (Ryans) ex-boyfriend,.
Hermino also hanged her cloothing into a black knee-shprt dress with aswingong skirt and bones all ova it, also with a v-nack but not asdeep as ryans. Black matte pumps (18cm and plateauoo) to completethe look.
“Hey, gurl, Ibeen thinkin about somethin,”, tina said as they walked ovre the bridge, heading to the astronomity tower. Absentmindedly she took Jinx’ hand.
„Oh… eh….“ Ebon< stuttered, sweating heavily, she had no idea, she didnt even know  what was goin on. „Eh… I#m a new student and they told me to go look for u soooooo it was more like a question, rather than a determination…...“
“Well…. Uhhh.”, he stopped, thinkin about ryan. But apparently she didnt want to talk to hm anymore, maybe he wasnt fancy enough enymore, now that h cudnt play quiddisch. But was she really that superficial? She didnt seem the tyoe actually and she was very cold towards him as he was playing his jockrole.
At each step which was taken by the studentds, there was a certain hesitation, listening closely if there ere any suspicius noises.
"Ma mère , calls me Dragon, or Mon Petit, or Mon Petit Dragon, or Mon Dragon Okay Potter. So laugh it up." Draco said giving up his secret, mortified about somehow not being able to avoid this confrontation, but not lying either.
Behind Hari's back, Draco's hands were clasped together in prayer as he silently begged his mother to stop embarrassing him, as Hari's shoulders were shaking with laughter.
can hear you.” Draco responded with a sneer. Bill appeared to swell up in size back stiff he reached for his wand, but Hari caught his wrist with Seeker reflexes. Bill paused from unleashing his attack, stunned. Hari not only stood between a wizard’s wand and his opponent. He stepped between two alphas about to do battle over territory rights. Bill as the intruder and Draco the one doing the defending.
had no effect in this dreamscape as lips lapped at his exposed skin, ankles, knees, thighs, the hollow dip in his hip. Draco’s silken hair fell to curtain his face, strands tickling the lines of Hari’s pelvis.
Draco’s brain just shut down, he shivered, the ear where Hari’s hand just barely grazed was already going numb with cold from the
Hari smiles bashfully up at the tall blonde “I’m beginning to.” Nothing in his demeanor was faked and he wasn’t acting coy like that Muggle. This was, just Hari. Draco smiled back in return.
And so Kreacher began teaching Harry the finer things about Spirits, steadily getting him drunker and drunker, until Harry was collapsed over the bar, talking in a drunken slur and rambling. One arm was dangling off the edge, while the other was busy making imaginary designs on the wooden surface of the desk.
Hey! I'll have you know that I mastered that spell fourth year during the triwizard tournament." Hari said with some haughtiness.
"Shoot!" Panted Arlys, "The sign-in sheet for the first round has already been turned in! I wanted to be in the group who sang the opening number."
"Let's have it for our first singer, Queen Beryl, singing..."The DJ checked the clipboard. "Aretha Franklin, 'Respect.'
Draco gave Hari an odd look. "Some Black's don't tolerate spouses with creatures' blood unless they are beta. Like my fourth great uncle Sirius's line. There are no creature manifestation in that line. They are all beta, including your godfather."
"I'm alright, I'm alright. Just forgot you spoke parseltongue and it gave me a bad moment, tis all." Draco managed to get out.
Andromeda then clapped her hands, the unexpected movement causing Hari to jump. “Good, we are ready.” Andromeda said, raising her voice to her sister, busily bouncing and rocking Teddy who giggled madly. When Narcissa came closer, she said sadly. “Teddy can’t make a sound.” Narcissa raised her eyebrow. Nodding her head she took out her holly wand and silently sent Teddy to a gentle slumber. Hari was upset but he held his tongue. It was better than a
Together they spoke in unison, shouting tone heard over the sudden howl of wind, “Blood of my heart.” The red lines flared, and Hari felt the magic flood from his veins into Teddy’s and through Andromeda, then like the tide, washed back.
"I was trying to get...Hagrid fired. He had no qualification. He never resumed his schooling after his name was cleared the end of second year. He doesn't have a functioning wand, and his pink umbrella is not fooling anyone. He never sat his OWLS, let alone his NEWTS. He. Is. Not. Qualified. To. Teach."
Sheryl saw the brief slip of the mask and answered the unspoken question. “These here are American portion sizes. The challenge is two large entrees, three large sides, and a large beverage. You think you’re skinny frame can eat all that in around an hour?” Draco’s face paled trying to imagine the amount of food. How can one stomach take all that food
“Wow, if I had known this was possible, it would have saved me a few dozen midnight trips in the Gryffindor comonroom at midnight for floo calls.” Hari exclaims.
“Nymphadora?” Hari asked, gently stroking the soft petals. “Are you sure you want to use these? They’ll get destroyed.”
"You're the only one who can get away with calling me that." Alice turned to Draco. "I'm pansexual. Meaning, I can love anyone, no matter their sex or gender identity. Sometimes its sexual, because hay, a girl has needs too, but other times its romantic or emotional attachment too. I've been in many different types of relationships. But recently the zing for me, hits all three with Sheryl Bear here. We've been fooling around on and off since I was 19."
I was rather impressed with how Potter handled himself. It’s not every day that a student could talk back to Severus unscathed. It was rather cool. I had to hide my approval behind the Malfoy mask like always. I think Severus should have given Gryffindor ten points for Potter’s cheek not taken them away. I wonder what he’d do next.
If Harry had looked up, he would have seen an unusual sight. A big brown owl, with amber eyes watching from the roof. He glided behind the pair unnoticed and just as it was about to reach the boy on silent wings, a great big snake reached out from the shadows and swallowed the bird. The letter it carried landed on the dirty paveway and was quickly trampled on.
It wasn’t long before Hari took notice of the lone figure blocking the entrance. If possible Hari’s shoulders tensed even more. Draco watched a he physically tried to relax his muscles before stepping away from the motorbike and out of Draco’s reach entirely to approach the bulking form. Something his alpha clearly did not appreciate.
A hissing noise sounded from behind Draco and he turned to see a mass wiggle from the pile of blankets, before he realized the mass was mistaken for the pile of blankets was in fact, a giant snake. The snake uncoiled and rose to flick its forked tongue at the bird, maybe out of reach.
It was he who instructed Dobby to discourage Hari Potter from going back to Hogwarts. It was he who suggested Dobby give Gillyweed to him for the second task, and it was he who ordered Dobby to release the prisoners from the cellar.
Andromeda and Narcissa had been sitting down for after supper drinks in the parlor when they suddenly overheard a commotion from an open window.
"Thanks, Sheryl. Your table's ready for you. Ollie's coming over after second set, he says, if your still here."  Emmet says, sweeping his hand out towards the awaited booth.
"Hey Bae!?" Hari tried experimentally, liking the sound of the nickname more and more. Draco looked over from throwing the rubbish in the
Hari laughed along with Draco. If that comment was made even a month ago, the world would have seen them rolling around on the floor in a true Muggle fist fight.
“That is a beautiful story, Draco.” Hari says. He had an inkling in his mind, the dream he had the night before. Draco the magnificent white dragon. He could imagine a tiny blonde boy, curled up next to his mother as she told him this bedtime story.
"I have money!" Draco said cringing away from the raised fist. Never before had he been punched and he didn't want to be punched now. He already knew he bruised like a peach.
Harry shrugged off the praise not knowing how to take compliments very well. "Maybe I could write a letter to Kingsley, then. Maybe he could do me a favor. I'd owe him big time." Harry said.
"That canna be. Harry would neva do such a thin, yeh got it wrong." Hagrid sputtered. "How could yeh let a lil' boy run out like tha. Dumbledore trusted yeh..."
The giant snake slowly raised its head to peer up at Harry. It tilted its head almost like a puppy, flicking its tongue out inquizetly. Harry was startled the boa hadn't bothered to move when the others were near, just when it was alone with Harry.
doing here?” He practically hissed. Draco’s dragon had superior hearing and heard every word. His alpha was always on guard around Hari, so when unfamiliar alpha stepped through the Floo, he stood up from his spot at the table.
April 2020 Update: Chapter 13 will be updated on April 20th. I hope to also have chapter 14 up at the same time. Subscribe to receive notifications about when that will be.
Harry didn’t know how to read music; he listened by ear and played by heart. He just didn’t have the patience to learn it. He would only call himself a novice at best, and an amateur  at worst. Harry learned the basics from the cat obsessed old women who babysat him when the Dursley’s went away on vacation. She only lived a few blocks away, still in Little Whinging Surrey, making it a convenient and cheap way for the Dursley’s to temporarily get rid of him while they had fun.  Mrs. Arabella Figg often bored him half to death, talking about her prize-winning cats. But sometimes she’d take a break and try to teach him the piano. So from listening to Mrs. Figg ramble on about cats, the piano, and escape into the garden to pull weeds, Harry learned a bit about the functioning of the piano, how to play, and how to tune one.
Tomorrow was Dudley's birthday, while they were out at the zoo Harry would practice and prepare for his escape.
A rattling was heard from the other side of the alley. Cursing and the sound of crashing glass could be heard. A finger rose to the boy's lips in a silent request for quiet. Draco was then lead to the opening of the alley. Whatever was behind them went quiet.
Harry wasn't in the mood for celebrations and parties. He wanted peace and quiet. Was that too much to ask?
The sound of a fight continued beneath him. Flesh hitting flesh, grunts of impact, and curses flying around. Then nothing, only the quick rasps of his own breath and heavy breathing of the victor beneath him. He wasn't sure if it was his rescuer or not.
Petunia didn't know what to do with another babe to take care of. She had her own son, and now she had Lily's son to take care of as well. She paced in her kitchen with lace curtains and clean countertops, thumbnail chewed down to the quick.
"Don't give me any lip, Dragon, and listen carefully. You are in pre-rut, which means its not at its strongest yet. As long as there is no one of
His laughter sounded on the wind and floated up to a window left slightly ajar. Hari didn’t notice this as he continued to put the garden to right with a combination of magic and manual labor. Hari also didn’t notice the platinum blonde head that peaked out the window from above.
Hari’s smile was megawatt and the laughter was quite different than before, full of joy and wonderment.
Draco stopped wolf whistling, but continued to make appreciated noises at the show. Draco critiqued Hari’s choices now and again, or rejection some of Hari’s choices out right, or compromising on others.
I don't know why I have the increasing urge to stay near Harry as much as possible. My eyes track him whenever we are in the same room together. It's maddening. I can get in so much trouble with father if he were to find out.
He didn't know where to begin. Should he start off with his initial reason for coming, Teddy? or should he start by apologizing? He looked at the women who reminded him so much of her sister, the one whose deranged laughter haunted his nightmares, "
"So you want me to have this, because..." Hari prompted. Looking at the cover, the back and carded fast through all the blank pages. It wasn't a very large book and it could fit in his breast pocket of his school uniform.
Draco Lucius Malfoy, never had what it took to be a good Death Eater. It was only his life circumstances that brought him to that pinnacle moment where he made the decision to take the Dark Mark and join the Death Eater ranks. From birth, his parents raised him on four fundamental beliefs; he is a wizard and therefore better than any muggle, he is pure-blood which means his magical family lines can be traced back centuries, he is rich and influential, and most of all he is a member of the Malfoy family. He was raised to be proud of his heritage, his wealth, and social standing. More importantly, he was raised in the inner circle of pure-blood elitists and bigots who eagerly awaited the return of Voldemort so that they could take their place in the highest status, under Voldemort's new regime, as second in command.
Draco took a deep calming breath, "Okay, Potter, anything else you would like to scare me with before we finish the tour." Hari realized that Draco only used his last name when really mad or in jest, so he didn't take offense and replied in kind.
"Your a witch." Dudley said a little shell-shocked. Hari thought he looked like a plastic bag, pale and about to float away in the wind.
Draco looked deeply into Potter’s wide and panicked eyes, and said quietly, “Scared, Potter?” before pushing his cock past the first ring of muscles.
"It's open." Nik hollered not moving from his perch on the other side of the counter. Harry turned panicked eyes to Nik who didn't look phased in the least. Panicked eyes roamed the bakery, looking for an escape. His eyes landed on the the land line on the wall next to the electric kettle.
Narcissa was still standing at the railing, staring in astonishment on how Hari had manipulated her son. She suppressed a giggle at the exchange. She stepped back into her room when she had a thought.
As for Hari, he found his nerves at having the Malfoy's living with him in home receding some. They were still there, plenty, but with a small truce between old rivals, perhaps they could even be friends. Hari didn't want to even imagine what his actual friend Ronald Weasley would say to that prospect.
She had to consult the Book again and see if it gave her any clues as to were he might have turned up. Then...
I will admit that I am not always diligent in my writing, but classes are more time consuming than I thought. Before I knew it, all this time has passed without me writing. I think I am becoming obsessed with Harry bloody Potter. It's maddening. I know he is up to something with his two friends. Ever since the match with Hufflepuff in February, have I been improving my stealth of tracking
Hari gently came to a stop just inside the barrier. Shutting the engine down, Hari turned to Draco over his shoulder. “You’ve been quiet the whole trip here, Dray.  Did I drive too fast and you are feeling nauseous? Shite, you ate a lot today, and I was inconsiderate. I’m sorry.”
Dear Mrs. Malfoy, we wish to offer our deepest condolences for the death of your husband, Lucius Abraxas Malfoy. Mr. L.A. Malfoy’s death, occurring by asphyxiation at 03:17:19 on 19th June 1998. No ill will or harm shall befall the remains after death and fall in the care of our Undertaker department.
Opening his eyes he gazed blurrily outside the clouded glass. Somewhere beyond the glass was the lion clawed bathtub that Draco lazed about in for upwards to an hour each day. He remembered the time he inadvertently walked in on his bath to piss then again to take his own shower.
They both ended up laughing hysterically. And when Andromeda and Narcissa, holding Teddy, came out of the parlor, peered over the railing to the ground floor below to ask what was so funny. They only laughed harder at their inside joke. Hari continued the tour, including Narcissa this time, who still refused to give up her hold on the two month old baby.
Harry didn't realize he had been drawing attention to himself. Piers noticed him talking, nudged Dudley.
Slipping his head beneath the surface of the frothed water, he held his breath just letting his mind empty of thoughts, before surfacing again. Taking a deep breath, he tensed. While he was beneath the surface of the water, Hari had entered the bathroom unannounced. Draco's back was facing the direction of the toilet so he couldn't see Hari, but he heard the clear sound of a stream of liquid hit the inside of a porcelain bowl, and smelt the faint pungent smell of ammonia. Hari Potter was taking a piss right behind him. The sound of trickling water diminished, he heard the sound of nails scratching against bare skin, and a loud yawn, before the sound from the toilet flushing and then the rushing water from the faucet in the direction of the sink.
It was Dudley who responded, "At the supermarket, actually. Cho-Cho was having difficulty choosing parsley in the fresh produce section."
"Emmet, Emmet that's great news. I won't tell Mum or da. Okay. oh they are going to be so surprised." Alice Squealed. "we got to celebrate. Have a drink with me."
Ron tried to punch me like a common Muggle on Boxer day. That neanderthal, he should have used his wand, and then he could have gotten detention. No one saw the scuffle to focussed on the game. Crabbe punched him in the nose. And Goyle fend off Longbottom by sitting on him. I was able to step back just in time to see Hary catch the snitch, right above Severus's head. That had to make my godfather really mad.
Thank you all for your wonderful support and patients with me. Also I know Revenge of the Sith came out in 2007, but I don't care. Padme always rocked her looks and she is a Queen.
When his mother straightened out her disheveled appearance before leaving, Draco stood by her side and said. “Thank you for telling me about everything, but I think I know Hari enough to know he isn’t like father, and won’t treat me the same way. He’ll accept me…I hope. I have to believe things will work itself out between Hari and I.” He took his mother’s hand and placed it over his own heart. “If he is a beta, then I will love him as I always have, because nothing would have changed. If he’s an alpha, then I will do everything in my power to be what he needs, because my alpha loves him already and wants to stay by his side.” He bows his head to the side. “And well, omega…” He sighs wistfully. “Wouldn’t that be a dream?”
"Psst, Mrs. Tonks. It's me Harry, Harry Potter. May I come in?" A disembodied voice hissed out a quiet whisper. Two hands appeared in front of her, separating an invisible slit in a hood to reveal one specticle clad green eye and a lightning bolt scar just barely peeking through a fringe of messy black hair. With a slight sigh of relief, Andromeda quickly waved the godfather of her grandson in.
"Not in the house, Malfoy, but if you are so afraid of snakes maybe you should have been in Hufflepuff instead of Slytherin." Hari joked.
Then next trail of fingers down Hari's rib cage was heading towards the the scar on Hari's hip bone when it was halted. Draco looked up to see Hari's eyes unfocussed. "Hari, love." He gulped. "look at me, please." With breath rattling in his chest, his eyes focussed on Draco's. "Are you with me?"
The first owl to glide down was a silent winged barn owl with tawny wings, pale face, and empty black eyes. The letter it carried was cream coloured with purple inked letters. The black wax seal had an emblem stamped into it of an M with a wand proudly expelling light from the center.
"I'm ten." Harry said indignantly. Nik's heart sank. He would have guest younger, but didn't want to offend the kid, and thought the kid would have been proud if he aged it up a bit. But no, the kid wasn't lying. He was ten and that meant he was heavily malnutritioned if he looked so small and young for his age.  Then he couldn't allow the kid to go back to that abusive house.
Over his mother’s head, Draco shared a look with Hari. He  was receiving the same treatment, but from his aunt, who absently wiped a smudge from Hari’s forehead. Seeing something on Hari’s neck, she went to wipe that too, but halted with a tittering, “Oh my.”
Holding tighter, praying Hari wouldn’t object, Draco trailed his nose down Hari’s neck and breathed into it. Would Hari allow it? Was he even able to with
Draco sat with mouth gaping in assoundment. He then tossed his head back and laughed roarishly. “Touché, Potter. Touché.”
In class I do my best, to be the best, and to get him to notice me. He only does so when I taunt him or his friends. Or savatage his work in potions. Severus knows its me. I smirk at Harry's frustration. I watch and hope he is watching me in turn.
Even as Harry was currently very carefully, trying to find where the rest of his body went, as he could only feel his head, Kreacher appeared with a tea tray and a small pile of scones. "Awe master is awake, good. I've prepared you a cuppa to start your day and something small to settle your stomach. A big day today, lots to do."
"That will have to be decided after the trial. I'll have one of my employees show you to your vaults, so you can withdraw some gold" Looking around her own pile of books, and said "...Awe Mr. Weasley, come here." Bill Weasley stepped up to the Chieftess' desk. "You'll help Mr. Potter set up a Muggle Bank account at Our Ally Banking, to exchange gold for muggle currency. I believe you know how to get around the pesky muggle rule of needing to be at least eighteen to open one, yes. Alright, go, go. I am a very busy goblin I have a whole bank to run world wide. " Apparently that was them being dismissed. So as quickly as possible Andromeda with the still resting Teddy in her arms, and Harry following at her heels, rushed out of the room before the brick wall could fold in on itself once more. Right before the final bricks went back into their proper places, Harry heard the chieftess shout, "Oh, Mr. Potter, do remember to grab your birth certificate, it will be needed to set up your muggle bank account. And one last thing, Mr. Weasley worked as a Curse Breaker in Egypt, dismantling all types of boobytraps in the ruins of ancient Carro, he might be able to help you with a certain spectre in your home."
“No, no, no!” Narcissa said almost aggressively. “The bonding spell only requires three drops of blood. One between godparent and child, and the third with the conductor, which will be Andromeda as she is the closest blood relation to Teddy.  We’ll do a duel ritual, using Andromeda’s blood to tie you permanently to the House of Black as the head. You’ll then name Teddy as your heir in name and blood.”
In the center of the room, Narcissa; dusty and sweating with a rag protecting her hair as she revealed an antique coffee table with a flourish of dirty cotton, as dust swirled into the air. She was laughing as she said, “See Andra, I don’t mind getting a little dirty the muggle way. It’s nothing a little refreshing charm won’t fix once we are done.”
So how do you guys think it will go on? Any characters you hope/ expect/ wish to have cameo appearences in the following chapters?
ok, Well played… so you wanna go hit him right now or wait till tomorrow? Do you need someone to help? Jinx? Hermoine? The Avatar?
“But he’s kinda cute tho.”, Tina said, blushing. She wore a short dark blue velvet dress that Jinx had suggested to try out.
*Foreshadowing! Of course this is going to happen in one way or another, because we want to create unnessesary drama, bitches!*
„Fuck off Jordan“, she said, but he had already stepped near them (although viktor, who stood next to him, tried to hold him back) and put an arm around Ryan sshoulders.
„Miss Callahan.“, said Professur Mcgonogal, who approached from tda back. „Plz pay attention to your choice of words, especially in front of our guests.“
She looked at the letter and thught this was a joke at first. But then she thought about it – what did she wish had never happened?
“You know what I mean. You’ve been acting strange after visitng Neville.” Hermoine pulled a ripped gray shirt over her head, big enough to reach her knees. It had been a band shirt once, but the writing and logo couldnt be sien anymore.
Some giggled, which made him blush a little more, but he caught himself fast and straightened his back.
“What? Older men? I thought she felt something for me, how can she throw herself into his arms right away??”, Neville sounded enraged and Fleur had to hold back to not grin widely.
The trombones began playing and the Gryffindor-team flew in, accompanied by the loud cheers of the Griffondorks. Then the Slytherins flew in and the Slytherins cheered,
„Hermone chuckeld, she wore a black top which wuz laced up in the frunt, black high waist jeans and a black floor-long coat. She also wore a black leather chokerwith a silver ring attached to it and another necklace which looked like two snakes holding a green stone in the front. She had different sized rings on her fingers with different stones and all silver. She had put in red contact lenses, whose made her look hreally demonci..
„Whot does this mean?", Hermina could hear ron whisper-shouted, heraby meaning he just asked in adead-silent room.
Hermione looked up and saw him, he saw a small smile flit across her lipsbefore sh turned away again.
Nobody dared to sit on the empty seat between them, so on this seat and table were stored all the books and writing materials.
„We are, dont forget, I‘m Slytherins Seeker, if I can catch the golden snitch, I will find a way out of here.“, Harry answered.
#ok so tell me what reincarnation you feel like, I won't say anyone a word because of good ol times.""
Oh, and he wore a light grey shirt and dark grey jeans and ...uh...pfff...uhm… lets say dark blue sneakers, ok?
"I think your time as the teachers-favourite are over," she said, not even looking AT THE ahockt goffik-grl next to her, taking her cape and her books, straightening out her glasses and leaving.
As he entered the rom (he taught a special class very early on wednesday mourning) he wore slim black leather pants, black laced up leatherboots, a white shirt with puffy sleeves and a blsck cloak, that floated elegantli as he swung it over the chair.  His shirt was… well...how do we put it...(to make yu feel the same cringe as the students)...well he unbottened it nearly completely to expose his mmuscular torso (with hair on it).
There were made new passwords for the common-rooms of the houses (although it was pretty unlikely the leek could talk or something). [
„But I could try it nevertheless… nobody is here, nobody would notive…“ she thought, and if it really worked out and she travelled bac in time to straighten things up… she could also just return back to the tmeline here if it didnt work out
He wanted to say sorry to hermoine, he had believed what ebony had said about her and had been really angry. He couldnt magine hermoine would have done this, and in the end it was not true too.
Ryan was tense and short-tempered because the situation stressed her out.The girls were chill and just ignored the stupid comments from the slytherin-peepz.
„Professor mcgongoal! If Jordan ever comes near me or my sister ever again I swear-!!!“, Ryan stormed through the open door, stopping confused, as she saw her sister.
"The beauxbattons girls are also fanatic about these fishnets, in all colours – you can geteye-cancer because of this, really." Hermine chuckled as theyentered the Slytherin-living room.
Both were unable to sleep, although eboby wasnt there to complain aboutthe world as she always did the last times. She was in a girls room,because the teachers did not allow a mixxed girl-boy room inHigwarts.
"I knew someone had stolen things from my stock," Snape said and stood up heroically."Who are the students who fucked shit up?" [
After a few hours of unseccusfull searchin in the woods hagrid returned, it was already afternoon and because winter was ahead it was already gettin dark again.
He was so friendly and open to those girls who were obviously flirting with him. Why didn’t he tell them to stop? That he already had feelings for someone… for her…?
„Maybe.“ Hermine said, when suddenly the earth started shaking and ripped, a deep abyss opened and seperated the group.
"Awww,do your lil friends have to fight for you," Hermoine grinned. "Youstart and they have to do the dirty work for you?"
They walked through the door of the classroom, just a few other peepz sat around, beneath others Hermoine, Jinx and Harry and Draco and Ron.
They passed a group of prepz, it was Neville, the major jock in this schol, and his buddys Crab and Goyle.
„You seem even more depressed than ever! So why are you nit goffikanymore?", Eboy shouted behind him. „Do you want 2 tell me thatyou gothic-image was just fake?"
Harry and Draco also were still inside the forest and had a lot of time to talk and do… other things...(A/N: Talk to me; Like lovers do…. * playing here comes the rain again by eurythmicsTM©*))
„High five“, grinned Jinx as they met in font of da rom, but Ryan just smiled vaguely at her.  Jinxx leaned in closer „Hey, if you want… Tinas quite good in potions, should we sneak some special stuff into his beaverages or somethin:?“
In the exact moment as he turned around the corner to hufflepuff-entrance to talk to hermina, he could see Drace kissing her.
All students left the room, also the gothic-trio. Ebons was so pissed,she didnt say a word for the rest of the day.
“So whut, we ust wont gettaa caught.” Ebntu hopped of er ber and swung her ewand, changing her outfiz into a black lace corset with non-matching velvt skiirt, violet platea shoes, black fishnets and red striped legwarmers.
“...Ok….” Ryan sat down on her saet. She wore an asymetric dress with a high slit in the left, long sleeves &aturttleneck, black lipstick nd white eyliner today. Her long black hair shimmered in the morning light.
In another Room of the Slyherin tower, Vampire lyed awake in his bed,strarring at the ceiling of his rom and Drake lying in the bed nextto Vampires, staring out of the windows.
„I think we should totally make it a thing to hit im at least once in every of the following chapters, dint cha think?“, she corrected her glasses and smiled. She wore a shirt with dark ¾ sleeves and a white torso, pale blue jeans and black/hite sneakers and she looked super innocent.
„Hey Drago," vampire said calmly. „maybe we should talk to Ebony, her behavoir has brought all of us in big danger."
They had been walkin through the woods 4 some hours now and nothin else had happened, raco and Vampire, silently hold hands and Rin and Hermine treid to avoid lookin @each otter, folliwing the boyzz.
“Wait a sec, dr devork what are you even doing here? Your class is once a week, this is professtur wonka s class.”
Hermine and Jinx looked inside the room from outsie'de the window, they hided behind some bushes and used a spell to be able to hear what was said on the inside.
Tina and jinx sat next to hermoine and Ryan, they didnt have much tome chattin before class started.
Since My Immortal-My sweet Unvalentine is a My immortal fanific, and since My Immortal is a Harry Potter fanfic, we would like to add at this point that we do not support JKRs transphobic statements!
“So will ya, or will ya just think abut it?”, Dawn muttrerde 2 hörself, without lookig up from her buk.
“Sweety, I’m glad you’re excited.”, Jordan said slimingly as he wirled her around to look at him. With a quick move she escaped his grip and stumbled a few steps backwards into the infirmary.
All the teachers were interested and shocked about what hapened in the woods, especially that tom the quiddich guy had been killed, and the others werent back either!
Se wasnt used to that,  normally everybody thot she wuz hit and wanted to date her, and here all thpse preps were trying to learn and get good grepes an such.
Ryan began tidying a little bit and hung clothes into her wardrobe. Becuse it was a little cold already she pot on black knee-socks, which made her look cute but also very gothic.
And it was absolutely clear that Vampire and Draco had no idea about Ebony being such alying, condescending, egocentric piece of shit. Maybe they just didnot want to see her real self because thhey were in love. Maybe theyhoped their love could chage her into a betta persona.
„You‘re a jock.“, she said, wallked over to the bed and took off her goat and shoes. Then she looked up. „Watcha waitin‘ 4? Let‘s get to sleep.
Hermine changed into her overzized JINJER-band shirt an long black leggins for sleeping, Ryan and her sister pit on black leggins and Humavoid-Shirts (different ones though, they had them from the consert they had been see in togetha). Izora changed into a grey shorts and a In This Moment-shirt.
„Ah, yeah right i hat totally forgotten about it..“, Neville nodded. „But in this condition i wont be able 2 go anywhere.“
„I think they went missing.“ she answered. „ Dumbledore also had no idea about you arriving so...“ She looked at Ebony. „We‘re sorry, but we found some old school unifrms for Slytherin for u to wear.“
„I tried talkin to he, ya know?" Draco said and sat down on his bed, grapping his pusheen-plush-cat. He wore a black ripped shirt and agrey jeans, his black eyeliner was smeard and formed a dark shadow under his eyes. [E/N: *cough*Panda*cough*] „I think she didnt understand what I wannet to tell'er. I dunno, I got de impresion dad I dunno her anymore, she has changed so musch...."
„What did you put inthis potion?" asked Snape effervescing and hit his hands on thetable, his black cape flaunting over his shoulders [
It was so awfull! Everything was shit! I mean, she hadn‘t been changin her clothes for like 2 days, she felt tired and annoyed  and draco and harry were nowhere near at all (she didnt want them around either, but she wanted to see ‚em so she could tel them to fuck off for leaving her).
„We need to get into the forbidden forest and find out if there are more leeks or other mutatetd plants out there!" Mc Google said.
„I think I should sleep.“, he smiled, as if he wanted to say sorry. He felt he was rude for saying this but he wasnt in the mood for talkin 2 anyone.
As she walked to the front entrance door but was stopped by – SATAN?????(A/N As we remember from my immortl the original Satan is Voldemorts younger self!)
„Yeah,I gotta same impresiion too...," Har- Vampre said thinkingly. He put on a red shirt, he also wore black jeans and dark grey sneaker.„Maybe the relationship beween us developd and we are just not meant for each other ya no?"
“What? For whom?” Why was he reacting like this, he was a mystery for himself. She wasn’t his girlfriend, well they got along good for a while, but… why did it hurt to hear thus?
„How are you gurl andwow- what are you wearing?" Ryan said and they gave each otter theghetto-fist and smiled calmly.
„“Hey, have you heard already?“said Jinx (the black-haired Ravenclaw girl from her sigils-class, see chapter 6) She wore a black longline bra, black shorts and a black tulle skirt on top of the shorts, black plateau boots, black lipstick and black eyeliner. „They also requested some sord of special agent to help hera wtith the problem, something about a lord or somethin“
After Potions & Past(r)ies they went to Herbalism, after this there was History of Magic and after that one hour of old Runes and their Magic Meaning and an hour of Transformation.
is a textbook of magic,typically including instructions on how to create magical objects like talismans and amulets, how to perform magical spells, charms and divination, and how to summon or invoke supernatural entities such as angels, spirits and demons. Source: Wikipedia]
“I will fucking ruin them!”, Jinxes teeth looked even more beasty than Ryans in the fading sunlight.
„No.“, Prof. Mcgonogal winked her argument away. „As a teacher, i am still restraied by the headmasters orders...but you are not directly...“ She looked at them conspiratorilly. „So make sure I catch you stopping him, so there will be no consequences.“
"My butt hurts," was Draco's first thought at the next morning, they hadforgotten to close the curtains and the light of the misty mourningfell through the windus. Vampireclinged on him and had his arms wrapped thightly around him. Heclosed his eyes again and took a deep breath in.
„How daru u? Dis lipstick is frum a top brand, u little brats couldnt even afford!“ the blue lipped whale said.
„Professor Dumblefork, what should we do? Who should we let go into the forest? It's a very dangerous task!"
A phony laugh creeped to her sfrom behind, one that many other people would ve found appealing, cute and heartwarm1ng.
„Ya know I was a boy-scout when I was younger.“, said Tom, the quiddith guy. „Iam super good in reading tracks, although im not sure how to find a leek in the dark, ya know? Haha.“
„Hello students, fans, friends, and colleagues!"Dumblebore shpouted. „In these dark times we still want to have some fun! So We want to see a fair match – so let the better team be the winner!"
Ok, so to speed things up, of course Jinx was totally down for Tina, and we‘ll bring them toghetether, wahoo!
"ya know it is something I just can tel you, b because e were so close friends before you were kidnapped and then went to beaux badtoes"
„Alright then, it is merely dawn, we should go.", Snapp said, just as thedoor flung open – it was Vampire!
Jinx wore a punky black shorts with ripped parts and spiky rivets and a grey ripped shirt which matched her punk-style. Her black boots were matte and at the end of the shoelaces were small silver bats.
“h mr malfloy, I think the young lady is reigt.” Dr devorak yeetet the rest of the stuff on the bog ol mahagoy table. “And your abilities can’t copete with hers, as I heard, so maybe be careful.”
The news that a student got attacked but survived circulated and everybody knew a bout it very qucik.
Ryan chuckled, today she wore just an oversized Icon for Hire-bandshirt and ripped shorts and a black leggins undernath and black docmartins shoues and black handcuffs. Her make u wuz also simle, just black eyeliner and blacklips tody.
„No its important you get some rest to get your wounds healed….“ She couldnt lock him in the exe. It was an awkward situation 4 her, because of the kiss and all...
„Hey Ryan, long time no s-„, he said, as Ryan ramed ers elbow into his stomach and he vomited on the floor.
Hermione stood there in front of the door, waiting for Ryan and Dawn, whilst chatting with the black-haired Ravenclaw girl from her
„As you wish, Miss Badass.“, Jinx winked at them and turned around as Tina arived their little round.
Ryan was so happy to c him and wonted to stand up and huck him, but caime to the conklusion that he m8t fall if she justbumped at him.
„Oh c whos dere?“, a girl looking like an goffik-instagram mua looked at them, doin a duckface with her inflated lips, painted in bright neon yellow. „It#s hermoine.“
„I know, and it is your total right to think of them as – as you said - superficial and phony bitches, nevertheless, please try to keep your attitude,“ Mcgockle said. „ there are many outsiders here at the moment, some of which I#m not sure are fond of our school and would love to use such disputes against us. Not to forget, we are in as state of emergency because of a goddamn leek.“
So Ryan, Neville and the boy from the quidditch theme – Tom- went on the left, Hermine, Ron, Draco and Harry went on the right and the other groups went anywhere else into the forest.
„Maybe it had to watchem have sex and it flew because it was so awkward!, Hermoine hissedand Ryan almost fell off the bed laughing.
"Fuckin prep, shut up you bitvh!" Eboni hissed, but the Hufflepuff girl just shook her head silently and smirked at her knowingly.
"Styx ,go for flight, huh, Ryan said in the moment and went to the windowwith the cage. She opened it and Styx hopped out of it, stretched hiswings and flew away.
„They were asked to help us, and for the fact that they are from another school, we may not take any egal action against them.‘
„Oh god, not again!" screemed Ryan, as she and Hermine wanted to go upstairs to their classes. „That's enough!" she scriecked. „Iwill no longer let my little sister walk arounf anywere without me!"
„Don‘t be like dis.“, it was Jordan (of course, who else) „It‘s been so lung, how can ya still be angry??“ He tried to approach her but she smacked him in the face.
As she looked around everythin looked as grey as before – she wondered how long she had been lying here. Ebony walked up the hill she had falen down from, still covered in dry leaves and dirt.
„It‘s Jordan, he‘s ….“, Ryan fought back her tears, she cwasnt even sure if they were of anger, fear or just insecurity. Why was she still not able to stand up against him properly?
“You mean Ryan?” His heart felt weird, as if he had lost something important. He thought about hw she had rected the other day….
„Did you know that in America everybody is allowed to have a gun and that many kids die because of school shootings?“ Tina looked at tham.
She just nodded quietlyy and went to the bathroom to change, although the thought of uniforms let her little goffik heart shrink.
He took a last look at Ebuny, still sitting on the floor, not knowing what was going on, and went awsy.
"Alright, hope to see you there tomorrow," Neville said, still smirking, taking a last short look at Ryan before moving on.
The other gurls looked at each othaa as if they were quite shocked about not veing alout to bitch arond like little kids anymore.
The arriving of Hermone reminded him what t had really meant to have friends, reL FRIENDS and to be oneself.
„Yu cant go alone to your room, it far 2 dangerous.“, Neville said, holding her bag by slightly touching her arm.
Hermoine was impressed that tina just had to say a word and Jinx would follow along and she had dicussed where to sit for like 15min and hadnt bean succesful at all.
Dr. Devorak flohnced into the room, today wearing a dark bloody red shirt, and a black, jeans, straghter than him.
He had a strange feeling that maybe all this was connected – hermino commin back, the leeches, ebonx disappering, the new teacher, all the students from other schools
„Yeah...“, he looked at her, still not 100% convinced, but he just shrugged and went with her 2 the great hall.
When they were in their room, Ryan changed in her Conquer-Divide-Bandshirt, which was wayy too big, because it was oversied-fit, and a black shorts for pyjamas.
“Yeah, I have a strange feeling, considering this long recovery somehow,  maybe its nothing, but…. We should keep an eye to this ….”
“Well hes very good locking thou, and really cultivated 2….” Fleur murmured. “Maybe she likes olter men...”
„Why did you even want to come with us, Vampire?“, asked hermine, because the rising tension between the boys annoyed her.
Jinx, on the opposite wore a blackshirt with a bolero on tp which had an iridescent green dragon scale pattern. And high waist black jeans and black demonia boots with a huge platform. Her nails were super long and also green and she wore green lipstick and blac eyeliner.
And how better to show a mudblod her place then to destroy her friends in a pityful place like this….
„It worked out I think.“, thought Hermine, „The trap I set up for her transported her back to the time she visited as she had to seduce  Voldxemort aka Satan. But this time she wont be able 2 come back...“
) you as well. The otherunimportant secondary characters without names standing right thereare here to support." He pointed at the gruop of students theydidnt know.
After haf an hour of searching she decided herself to wear a short black jumpsuit with a deep neckline on da back and goffik patches all over it. Pink fishnets with pearl in form of bats and little orsnge pumpkins and her beluved black bikerboots made it perfcct. She whore her hair in a bun with two long bloody needles stuck in (to maybe stick it into the eye of dis bitch hermina.... who knew?)
„I‘m more worried about the kids themselves than any oversensitive platinum-blonde-dyed parent!“, said Mcgonogull.
Dawn and Izora wore normal clothing – Dawn a skater-dress with a universe-print, black leggins and black laquer combat boots, a violet long coat and fluffy ear-warmers; Izora wore a red shirt with „I hate people (and pants)" in white letters on the front, ripped denim blue jeans, red boots, a black beanie and a black coat, as well as her yellow-black-striped hufflepuff scarf (although hufflepuff didnt play today, but it was just so waaarm!111).
He didnt anse´wer, he just locked @her with his mud green eyes. (A/N mud green because of the bugs, as you maybe remember in twilight the vampires drinkin human blood had red eyes, the cullens who drank animal blood had golden eyes and bugs make eyes green just because :P)
A new teacher arrived, but just mere rumors were heard abot him, wwe all kno Dumbleforks not that reliable when he has 2 pick new teachrs
„Professur McGonogal“, Isora (A/N: Ryans sister, in case u forgot) yeeted the door to mcgoggles bureau open. „If this asshole of a durmstrang student will ever think of looking at my sister ever again I will-“
„He sais he wants 2 help, so he go gonna do help§, Dumbledoor saiys. „Nodiscussion, I#m the headmaster."
The conversation uff the teacherss was rather unspectaclular. They wanted to send another squad to look 4 ebuny, but werent sure which students they culd send in the forest again.
On top ef Hermoines case was also a cage, but a far smoller one, wth arat sittung in it. His Name was Karl and his left ear was black, buteverything else was white.
“W-!”, >Drace wanted to protest, but haerry hit him with a “Shut the fuck up!” and the docotr continued his lesson.
]and could not bear to be with anyone. His rage brought him deep in the castle of Hogwarts. He hadnt realized it was getting dark outside and becoming late, until he found himself in a cold, dark floor, allsalone and two blood red glowing eyes staring at him out of the shadows.
She had told him these were protection-spells and he had believed her (beacause he had been emotionally unstabl and not the best student, as said).
Draco didnt even listen to her, he just stared yat the floor where vamp-harry had left. He remained silent asnd went awy 2.
“Oh wait! Letme guess!” Fleur exlamatet and looked thoughtful, shrinking her arms and planting a finger at er lips.
„okay.",he said. „Maybe ... I... I just wanted to tell u that... im notwith the gothic-people anymore, when you left Ebontz'told everyonelies about you, well at the beginning I believed her although Icouldnt really imagine you doing all of the stuff she told us, butknow I now taht it was all just lies and...yeah..."
"Hey girls, what are ya up to?" Neville said with a charming smile,every other girl at this school would have melted, seeing that glance in his grey eyes..
She wore a dark-red lacedress with matching lacquered high heels. Her black eyeliner framedher dark-green eyes and her long natural-red curls fell over herback.
Of course that this bitch Hermoinie cam back, tht all er friends left her… but first of all that Vampire and Drago rejected her.
„Yeah.",she said felling obviously uncomfortable. She didnt undastand why hewas now talking to her at alle. She noticed his slightky differentstyle of clothing, somethin had changed, he seemd different to hernow.
With the easy of a thousand year old sul sh spoke some magic furmolas and their opponents didnt mention, tlll it was 2 late.
„So, I demand you not to brng any damage to the highly revered name of the house Slytherin; Mr. Riddle will show you everything and accompany you in your frst week of skull.“
The teachers told them to go in groußs of at least 3 persons and groupedthem as they thought it would work best – so: Ryan, Neville and aboy who they were told was also a member of the SlytherinQuidditch-team; Hermine, Ron and Draco as group two, Ebony and Crapand Goyle; and also the unknown others were grouoed in grops of 3.
„Why so grumpy?“, said the girl next to the first bich, lookin exactly da same as the first girl, just with blue lips. „You#re back in your hell-jole of a skull, wasn#t it whut u wanted?“
She went past the Quidditch team, which came in from practicing, Neville talking to the others. He looked up as Ryan nearly flew down the stairs, he had heard her screaming.
He looked at her thinkingly and then smirked a little (as much as he could before having pain again.)
„Of course they told you to search 4 me, I‘m the Slytherin-house leader, I just wonder why they din‘t tell me...“
"Crap," she thought, arming herself, because she thought he wpuld say something stupid andattacking her for yesterday when she and Ryan fought with ebonyy.
Hermoines outfit today was a black off the shouder roll top and black leather pants. She had her mint-green hair in a bun and wore earrings witch (goddit!) locked like silver snakes twining around a black agate stone. She wore black eyeliner and had painted dots under her eyes.
"no, no, I really mean it, this goff stuff  got sorta wrong for me, I dunno, bit I really think I am an otherkin.*, he axpleined. "I mean hey, in this alternate potter-universe there are vampires and wrrewolfes, centrairusse and stuff, so why not being a reincarnation of an animal-soul in a humans body, huh?"
They both hadn#t to go to aany lessons for the next two ours, but both felt like they couldnt standkdis slice for the next 2 hours.
„Whaddaya mean?“ he didnt look at hr, he exactly knew what she menat but dindt want to talk bout it.
Hermoine wondered if Neville also had recognized this hesitation of Ryan, althpough he didnt knew her so well.
„Who‘s brain?“, asked a voice behind them, t‘wuz Neville, still an arm in a bandage and holding a crutch with the other hand.
After a long discussion Ryan could convince her sister Dawn and her room-matte Izora to stay with them in their room in the slytherin tower.
>“I thought so.“, Satan said arrogantly. „Now put in your uniform, we need to talk to professur Snake.“
“Thank you,” he manages, feeling entirely wrong-footed. Everyone’s watching him now as he tears off the shiny paper to find a scarf knitted in soft slate-blue wool. His fingers stroke over the neat rows of stitches. “Thank you,” he says again. “It’s lovely.”
There’s a squalling baby and two people shouting at each other from the next room, and the wireless is blaring as loud as it will go. Footsteps thunder overhead, and then the sound of smashing glass followed by a bellowed, “
Instead, he’s got a cot, which certainly isn’t anything fancy, but he’s slept on it before—just once, on a stakeout where he and another Auror were taking shifts—and it’s comfortable enough. It’s also going to be a very tight fit with the two of them tucked into it. They’ll have to cuddle up pretty close to keep from tipping over the edge onto the floor, and Harry’s stomach thrills at the thought of spending the whole night with Malfoy in his arms.
thing just as appalling as Draco does. He talks a bit more about Potter, and Draco shares a few childhood stories about Pansy. He makes sure they’re really embarrassing ones, to make up for the ones she’s undoubtedly shared about him.
“He’s got loads of things to see to,” Draco went on, and then steered the conversation back to himself. “That’s why he’s got me, mostly. To keep things here running.”
He has a few boxes left, all books, and he Levitates them across the hall to the small room he and Potter have designated as a library, then tucks his wand up his sleeve. That’ll be the last bit of magic this house sees. He and Potter had agreed that, other than the necessary spells they’ll need to work to manage Draco’s transformations, they’ll be doing as much as possible the Muggle way. The chances of someone catching them at it in their own home are slim, but they don’t want to get into the habit of using magic all the time around here. Draco especially is afraid he might do something to give himself away.
In the end, Draco receives five applications, and schedules them one right after the other for Monday afternoon. He’d been nervous through the first two interviews, a little hesitant through the next two, but by the fifth he’s much more comfortable. He feels almost confident, in fact, because so far all of the interviews had gone nearly the same. Introductions, he asks the same questions, listens to the answers, and then thanks them for their time before ushering in the next interviewee.
It’s even smaller a room as Draco’s lab had been when he’d taken possession of it, but unlike Draco, Potter hasn’t bothered with Expansion Charms. The room is just big enough for Potter’s desk and chair, and two large filing cabinets.
Would it make her feel uncomfortable f she knew my thought?, Izora asd herself, shifting her gaze up to the big ornamentes windows uff the libruray.
She hung different dresses in her wardrobe, a black one with a mermaid tail printed on it, beginning on the hips, but it was no normal booring mermaid tail, yt was designed like fishbones and looked very cool on her because of her long legs and perfect bod-. Next to this she hung her green slytherin dress. She also hung uo a short black dress with a corsage and with skulls and bones all over it, a black dress with an anatomicall heart on the chest and diverse other black,grey, red and dark bluu dresses with lace, prints and cutouts and stuff, Underneath all those dresses stood a black pair of high heels,some dark snikers (one violet pair with universe-pattern on it, agift from her little sister), diverse boots and a pair of sandals. She looked at the other part of her wardrobe, there were lying her jeans, shirts, tops and all.
„No,my sister"!, yelled Ryan and tried to go back to find her, but it wuz impozzible to walk through the panicking crowd.
„But…..“ she looked around, all the other beds of the infirmry had no bedding on them, there were just the bare mattresses. „I dont want to sleep on the couch either...“
Night sunk over the castlle of hogworts and and everyone went to sleep,even Hermoine and Ryan, still with lotsa eating-stuff lyin around onall tables, nighststands and their cases which still stoodeverywhere around in the room.
It was early the next möurning when Hermine sat on her bed and drew small pictures in her grimoire thinkingly. The tip of the pen gave night-black ink onto the paper while she thought about Ryan yesterday.
When he arrived n his room he felt reieved for he wuz alone, nevertheless the room felt empty without his beloved boyfriend.
“You rmember I said we were going to beat up Jordan every chapter from now on, respectively chapter 17?”
„Oh I am sorry, her majesty the queen of darkness is somuch more helpful than me, „he said hatefully.
"What a bitch, whore, wanna-be.whatever!" Ebony screamed when she, drakiand Vampire left and went for a walk outside in the nightly mist. Shescreamed and shouted for quite a while, Vampire and Draco were silentand just listened to her bad rant. In the last times she justexploded like all five minutes and they were rally annoyed of hermoad de last weeks. The boys looked at each other quietly, wishingthey had some time for just themshelves (
"mine too," Vampire said. "Just as you are." He turned his hadtowards Draco and saw his green eyes shining in the dark. (romantican erotci bi guys moment *-*)
Ryan looked at him suoer annoyed for he had been talkin all the time for the last ten minutes. Even Neville, who was used to listen to people telling him uninteresting stuff, seemed annoyed.
"Pfffff," hissed Ryan, who obviously was enranged because she just thought of the quidick boys as pretentious, self-centered idiotss. "Who does he think he is?"
Before she could think even more about this strange non-Draco-like behaviour, ProfessorMcGogogal came down de hallway and they alllll went inside the rom.
Ryan and Hermoine looked through the window as Krumm and the other guy got the information froom the teachers abaout the problems.
“Nevertheless, f he…. Liked… me he wouldnt let her,….”, Ryan murmured, nearly letting the tears fall from her heart.
It was Ryan, an old friend of Hermina. They kew each other since the timebefore Herminesfive-trimester long students-exchange at beaux-button. Ryan alsolooked just like da awsom tattoo-artist Ryan Ashley Malarkey,  and was as annoxed of thebeauxbaton-ladies as Hermine was. They got alng very well and wroteletters during the time of de exchage.
