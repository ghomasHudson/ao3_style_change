“I know where you’ve been.” Blaise said.
. His hand had only reached out for a second but in the picture it looked...lingering. “That’s not really how it was.” Harry argued, “he wasn’t caressing anything.”
Ron opened his mouth to say something, but instead just started laughing again. “I can’t believe Malfoy was flirting with you.”
“And, he’s a git!” Harry spat. “He knows damn well what his schedule looks like. He’s just...purposefully annoying me.” Harry knew this.
“Yet.”
“Er, thanks. You...do too. Look nice. I guess you always look nice though.” Potter’s eyes went wide, as if surprised that he had said that. Causing Draco’s smirk, to turn into an actual smile.
“We can watch whatever show you want to.  I signed up for a free monthly trial of one of those streaming sites.”
“Are you going to open it?” Ron asked.
“And you are suggesting I get it and use it.” Harry raised a brow at her, he wasn’t angry if it would work he would be stupid not to.
“Lo” Draco heard, and rushed into the other room. Harry’s head was in the flames of the fireplace, waiting for permission to come the rest of the way through.
“Certainly not.” Draco said, when Harry came into the room. He was wearing a pair of dark blue pants, and a gray cotton button up. His brow scrunched up in either confusion or indignation at being told to go change for the second time that day.
“You’ve already crossed me off your list so you don’t care one way or the other. Is that it?”
Harry heard the ancient front door of Grimmauld Place creak open and then slam closed.  Draco was always overzealous with his wandless magic.  Harry padded into the entry still barefoot and in his pajamas to see if he needed any help with the groceries.  Draco had left earlier that morning saying he was going to stock up for the next few weeks of mandatory self isolation.  This new virus was throwing the whole country into a panic, both wizarding and muggle.  Harry stopped short, when he came around the corner and couldn’t see Draco behind the wall of toilet paper he was carrying.
“You slept with Zacharias Smith in seventh year.”
“Awe, Harry you are so innocent sometimes.”
“I’ve got my eyes peeled and…”  He dropped his voice even lower.  “After the war I built myself a sort of...safe house.  I’ve only told a few people about it, so if things go crazy again and we have to take the law into our own hands, I’m prepared.  And of course I would look after you three.”  Draco looked torn between being horrified at Seamus’s crazy coming through and touched that he was being included in those worthy of Seamus’s whiskey and protection.  Harry thought he would rather stay put where he was at the risk of capture and death than be stuck in a safe house with Seamus.  He had lived with him for 6 years in a dorm and Seamus had only grown worse over the years.  Harry didn’t think he could make it for 6 days.
“It’s been a long time since I’ve lost. I’ve gotten quite accustomed to getting exactly what I want.” Draco practically purred the last part, before turning and letting the door fall closed behind him. Let Potter think on that.
Draco stepped around his purchases, leaving them floating behind him, so that he could scowl at Harry properly. “You never know and you will be thanking me when your arse isn’t raw from having to scourgify it, because we ran out of toilet paper.”
“No, you can get him off of me.”  Draco emphasized his words by kicking Harry in the shin.
“Rich people host charity events all the time.” Ron argued, “It gives them an excuse to throw a party, they can ride off on their taxes.”
“Do you think you will ever tell Draco that he didn’t have Rubert’s Disease? And that you had cast a blood and love ring on him instead.”
Potter looked so offended at being accused of being dramatic, that one would think that Draco had just insulted his mother.
“Well I have a few more ideas, but they are less solid and I really don’t think we need to consider them yet. I will leave these here.” She said pointing at the stack of books on the end table.
Harry decided they’d done enough talking and went in for a kiss, hoping it would be received better this time.  He wasn’t disappointed.  Draco froze for a moment, his mouth and body stiff, but then he relaxed and kissed Harry back with the passion of someone that had been holding back for a long time and just decided to throw caution to the wind.  It was amazing and Harry thought he could spend the rest of the day doing nothing but snogging with Draco.  Draco’s hands tangled up in his hair, teasing and petting, Harry moaned into Draco’s mouth.  Maybe he wouldn’t want to spend the entire day, just snogging, that was starting to seem like torture.  Even more so when Draco’s shirt started riding up and Harry’s fingers came into contact with smooth skin.
“Probably.” Harry said, trying for humble, but knowing they would most likely win. His team had come together last practice, better than he had ever expected. Even Draco was doing better than their first practice, if he was as distracted as Harry he was hiding it well. He hadn’t let a single quaffle by on the last practice. Frankly, at this point Harry was the weakest link, but he would pull it together, no matter how much he wanted to obsess over Draco.
Draco dropped the towel onto the counter and turned with an expression of offense on his face. “Malfoy’s do not run.” He heaved his chest up with false bravado, giving Potter a practiced look of superiority.
“I’m going to take a stab and guess this has something to do with Malfoy.” Hermione said, her voice calm.
“I was going to go to the Mart and get a few more things, I really think this isolation is going to last longer than what I had planned when last I went.”
“I’ve been thinking about trying a fertility spell on Pansy next. Would you like to come over and help?” He asked. He hadn’t minded Luna’s help reversing the Blood and Love ring either. The ring is old magic and requires blood from the intended recipient to cast it and an act of love to reverse it. It was a harmless spell that parents use to cast on their children to help them find a romantic match. Blaise wasn’t all that surprised when it helped lead Draco to Potter, after all Blaise had spent six years of school listening to “Potter this and can you believe Potter that.” There was a running bet in the Slytherin house about when the two of them would finally shut up and… ‘kiss’ already. Blaise had a few people to get in touch with, who needed to pay up. He smiled over his glass and patted the camera in his pocket. He had all the proof he needed.
“That’s okay.” He said, taking the offered letter back from Ron and stuffing it in his pocket.
“Look it’s Seamus!”  He said, more excitedly than was really warranted.
“Wonderful.  It’s been sort of a holiday for us.”  She glanced towards Nott, who was nodding along in agreement.
“We’re managing.”  Draco said, coming to sit next to Harry.  Harry took his drink and tried not to shift too much, on the stiff cushion.
“I know.  It’s just hard to remind myself sometimes.”
“Sure thing mate.” Ron agreed.
“For discreteness.” Draco said, getting up off the floor with as much dignity as he could.
Harry chuckled into his whiskey.  Of all Draco’s friends he surprisingly got on the best with Pansy.  She was more blunt than any of his other friends and he appreciated that.
“Then how did you know it was him?” Hermione asked, making Harry feel better that this was the first time she was hearing this as well.
“Er…”  Harry tried to think of some sort of excuse, but his brain went blank and Harry didn’t think that he had a spider on his face would cut it.  “I got nothin.”  He admitted.
“I didn’t think you would, but I just wanted to give all options I could.” Draco nodded but said nothing else.
“One more.” Ron suggested, and Hermione kicked him under the table. Or Harry assumed she had, based on years of knowing Hermione’s expressions and body language. And Ron’s quick retraction of the offer.  “Another day, I mean. Er, we should all have one more, another night, all together.” Ron rambled, a little worse for the drink.
She did have a point, but Draco refused to have this conversation again.  “What should I wear?”
“At least you didn’t buy it.” Draco eyed the floral couch with distaste at the thought that at some point in time someone somewhere had in fact bought that couch.
“The ugliest flat in Britain.”
“Glad to see you have your priorities straight.”  Harry commented, Draco was already holding one of the bottles and eyeing it like it was a bottle of galleons instead of whiskey.
“I don’t know.” Draco admitted, it didn’t make any since. Draco swooped down and grabbed his wand from his robes piled on the floor and cast a few spells on himself that would show if he had any curses or spells affecting his being, but the scans showed nothing.
It was right around Draco’s third attempt of leaving that Harry suddenly paused while kissing down his throat. “Uhm.” He said, pulling back looking confused. His glasses were thankfully gone somewhere, hopefully never to be found again and his hair was sticking up everywhere, but in the bedroom Draco decided it was okay for it to do that.
“Well you did try to turn him over to The Dark Lord, during the war.”
“But how could they have done something without you being present.”
“Exactly.” Hermione agreed a little too excitedly. “But we don’t know for how long. What is considered dead to the curse? What if it is just your heart stopping? Then we could use a medical spell that is used during a number of surgeries to temporarily stop the heart. The curse is broken and then we lift the spell and your heart starts pumping again.”
“Lets go get a drink.” He pulled Harry by the hand to the nearest bar. All the eyes in the room seemed to be on them. Draco decided he liked being on the arm of Harry Potter very much.
Harry woke up in the most comfortable bed, tangled in the softest sheets and blankets he'd ever felt. He hadn't even known such materials existed in the world, but up until last night he also had never known that sex could be like that. He stretched out wondering where Draco had gone and then wondering where his clothes had gone. He did manage to find his glasses and his wand.
“He just needs a little more time to warm up to the idea. He did agree to play seeker for one of the teams.” Draco said, leaving out that it took convincing and a little blackmail.
“He came to Fred’s funeral.” Ron finally admitted. Harry paused for a moment that hadn’t been what he was expecting.
Harry shot up, his hair sticking up everywhere, from the sweat, rain, and genetics.  “What? When did you guys get here?” He asked, looking between Ron and Hermione.
“Er, Draco?”  Harry asked, not really sure what to say and hoping it was in fact Draco behind the stack of white rolls, instead of a different psychotic wizard.
“Potter. Over here, please.” Harry cringed, but walked over to where Draco was. Draco held up his top pick to Potter’s cheek.
“So, Malfoy was completely sober when…” Ron swallowed his face threatening to crack, ”he was... caressing your... thigh?” Ron's control went completely out the window. He began laughing so hard tears were streaming down his face and he had to lean against the island to support himself.
“He’s not alone either.”  Pansy added.  “I didn’t realize how much the wizarding world liked gambling.”
his tone pleaded.
Pansy.” He didn't think he need say more.
“A letter from your parents.” Draco cringed.
Draco flitted from room to room, making sure that everything was in order.
“Well after you are done charming Potter, come down the hall to my office and we can go to lunch.”
“She’s right.” Draco agreed and Harry took a second of pause at Draco Malfoy agreeing with Hermione. Hermione beamed for a second, before continuing.
“No, uhm nothing else.” Potter said, and Draco shrugged, feigning indifference.
“Because you are the most qualified. Obviously.” Draco drawled, as if it pained him to say such a thing. Potter racked his hands through his hair, making it more of a mess.  “Pansy is helping me, I suppose you can always meet with her if you prefer.”
“You need to take a chill pill.”
“I’m gonna drop off a couple bottles to Dean as well.  I’ll pop in later and we can have a few drinks.”
“You are planning a Quidditch match to raise money for orphaned children?” Harry asked.
“Not at all.  We just finished eating, would you two care to join me for a few after dinner drinks?”  Draco asked.
Harry’s face turned pink around the ears. “I know.”
Harry shrugged, not seeing a problem.  The conversation stalled for a moment and Harry desperately wanted to continue talking about teeth anything to avoid talking about what Harry knew was coming next.
It must have for Hermione as well, because her eyes filled up with tears. “Oh, Ron.” she said, putting a hand on his back.
Draco shook his head. “No. There were not any reported deaths around the time the curse appeared that matched the rite to apply the curse. I’m not doing that one anyways.” Draco’s eyes held no question on the matter. “I’m not going to pass a curse onto my mother or father.”
“Goody.”  This time it was Draco’s turn to sound dry and bitter.  It didn’t last long when Seamus brandished two large bottles of alcohol.
“Another thing I can cross of my list.”
“Draco, you are going to drive yourself around the bend and me along with you.”
“No.”  Draco quickly answered, then looking sheepish admitted, “Maybe.”
“I won’t say anything then.” She said.
“The stores aren’t closing.”  Harry pointed out.
“It was supposed to be just temporary. The entire flat that is. I was planning on fixing up 12 Grimmauld Place and moving in there, but with work I haven’t had much time and then here we are.”
“Stupid.” Harry muttered again.
“Had a good time. Bye.” Harry looked over Draco’s shoulder and scowled at his audience.
“Is it true?”  Draco asked his eyes big and too alert for someone that just woke up.
“As if you can talk.”
Draco apparently didn’t know what to say. He looked speechless. Harry tried putting his arm back around him, but he shooed Harry’s arm away and jumped to his feet. “You are the master of the elder wand and you don’t use it!”
“Oh Merlin.”  Draco pulled a pillow tight against his stomach and he looked about as freaked as Harry felt.
“We wanted to tell everyone the exciting news.”
“Er, she said she would be here in a few minutes.” Potter said, looking like he didn’t know where he should sit. He finally put the tray on the coffee table and sat next to Draco on the striped couch. Closer than Draco thought he really needed to.
Harry handed the letter to Ron to read, not that he would understand the cryptic words. He knew less than Harry about the situation. Ron’s eyes darted across the paper, absorbing the words with a wide eyed expression, very Hermione like.
“Yes please.”  Draco quickly agreed, allowing Harry to pull him to his feet.  No one would probably miss them if they were gone for just a few minutes.
“Does this mean that you like me too?  Or are we arguing about this for reasons I don’t understand.”  Without giving Draco a chance to answer Harry continued, years of holding his feelings in spilling out.  “Draco, I like you.  I didn’t say anything because I didn’t think you liked me and I didn’t want to make things uncomfortable between us.  And also because I wanted you to live with me.  I didn’t think you would if you knew so…”
“Because I didn’t know what to say.  I was thinking.”
“Then they would go after Harry so they could become the master of the most powerful wand known.” Draco finished for her.
“Why did you ever allow him to move in with us?”  Draco asked, casting one final spell that Harry wasn’t for sure what it did.
“I can and will not believe the the ancestral home of the Black’s is worse than this.”
“You guys are the first ones here.  Grab something to drink and I’ll put this with the rest of the food.”  Harry’s voice trailed off as he re-entered the room.  Draco was still lounging, but it looked hotter from a distance.  His posture relaxed, with his feet and knees falling slightly open, making him look confident without trying to.  The entire pose, brought to mind a few nights ago, in this exact spot, when Harry had taken advantage of a similar position that consisted of Draco just like that and Harry kneeling in front of him.  Harry was sure that Draco was sitting like that on purpose just to fluster him.  He would probably be teasing him slowly to insanity all night.
“This is Malfoy were talking about. Making plans was an extracurricular activity in school.”
He summoned his clothes and climbed out of bed begrudgingly. His clothes felt like he was pulling on a canvas bag compared to the sheets he was leaving.
The next morning, Harry woke up, to a floo call from Ron. “I'm coming through.” he called. A moment later he was standing in Harry's kitchen, with an unreadable expression.
“Thank you Gr...Hermione for your help.” Draco stood up from the couch again and Harry’s arm felt cold and empty. Draco held out his hand to Hermione. Hermione looked at the hand, then her face broke out into a grin and she bounced on her toes. “Oh.” She bypassed the hand and gave Draco a very quick hug. The surprised look on Draco’s face was the funniest thing Harry had seen all month.
Draco’s face pinched into a frown.  “That didn’t answer my question.  We all say things.  You either do or you don’t.”
Harry dropped his head down into his pillow and groaned, “I don’t know.”
“No. Why would I?” He was starting to get irritated now. When would the kissing begin again? He tugged at Harry’s hair, trying to get him back on task, but the stubborn man acted like he didn’t even feel it.
“No.” Harry assured, “He came by the office today and when he was leaving he said something and it, I think he was flirting.”
“Wonderful.” Draco commented, trying to keep the sarcasm out of the remark and failing, if the look Potter just gave him was any indication.
Soon their routine shifted into helping each other study, which led to talking and then joking, which led to an unexpected friendship.  They ended up getting along so well that after Hogwarts, Harry had asked Draco if he wanted to move in with him at Grimmauld Place.  Draco was looking for a place in London, Harry had the room, and didn’t have the desire to live alone.  It had worked out.
“I’ll come back later.”  George announced.
“Your neck.”
When Harry went to put away the condiments he had used on his sandwich, he noticed that the fridge had been reorganized and cleaned.  “Did you clean out the fridge?”
“You are my roommate, my friend and I have roommate and friend-like feelings for you.”  Harry managed to get out.
“Don’t worry. I didn’t find my mattress on the side of the street.”
Ron shrugged again and mumbled. “It’s not a big deal. It’s just stupid to hold onto grudges. We all did things during the war we aren’t proud of.”
“Yeah, that sounds fun.”
“Blaise! I will hex you if you don't hand that camera over NOW.” Draco had his wand in one hand and his other out like an impatient parent.
“Batton takes care of permits.”  Potter said, pointing at a chubby man two desks away.  Then raised a brow as if to say, now please leave me alone.
“I was planning on telling you when we got back to Draco’s.”
“She still uses a toothbrush.” Ron said, sounding like Harry was the only one he could trust to confide this with.
“We will talk later, but you need to go.” Draco said, already stepping away.
“Shh.” Harry said, looking over his shoulder, hoping Draco hadn’t heard her, but he was still across the room, their drinks being loaded onto a tray.
“And?” Hermione probed, not looking at all surprised.
“I couldn’t imagine they would.  I wish that my work had offered me to work from home.”  Draco was having a hard time with not working.  It was like he strived on the fast pace and long hours.  He had only been off for two days now and he was already getting the wild look of a caged animal.  Harry on the other hand was looking forward to having a little extra time off.  He had a few projects around the house he was hoping to get done and frankly he didn’t really like his job at the ministry affairs office.  He was told it was just a stepping stone, but so far he hadn’t liked any of the jobs on his path up and was beginning to think he wouldn’t like it up at the top either.
“Want to watch something for awhile?”  Harry would probably put something on the telly for a bit, to help him fall asleep.
Draco showed up with five minutes to spare and enough time to do a walkabout to make sure all last minute details were in order. Nothing was out of place, not that he expected they would. Pansy had came straight here after the game; she had a sharp eye and no trouble bossing Draco’s temporary staff around as if they were her own. She handed him a glass of wine when he made his way back to her.
“As one of the team captains, I thought it would be good to go over some of the details.” Draco snapped, standing stiffly in response to Potter’s negative reaction. “Set up a few practice dates and give you a list of your teammates as of now.”
“Yeah, me too.” He tried to say quiet enough for Draco’s eavesdropping friends not to hear.
George seemed to consider Harry’s response for a moment, then gave a large grin.  “Not as interesting as waking apparently.”
“Fine. I invited him to the Harpies game this weekend.” Harry flashed Ron a look that asked, “Are you happy now?”
Draco nodded, “Then call me Draco.”
“I don’t know what that is, but I don’t want one.”  Draco had caught a hold of the banister, bringing them to an abrupt stop.  Harry’s feet slipped and Draco took the opportunity to try to make a run for it.
Harry ran his hands through the silky strands of hair at the base of Draco's neck, pulling him closer and kissing him deeper, his mouth tasting like a mixture of apple and brandy. The soft groan that Harry heard come from Draco was perfect. Harry pulled back slightly from the kiss to gauge Draco’s reaction. His reaction was to push Harry back into the settee with both the force of his own kiss and the use of both hands splayed against his chest. Harry found himself with a lap full of Draco, his legs straddling him on both sides. And all his senses going into overdrive and loving every second of it. If only he had realized sooner that spending time with Draco could be like this.
“You’ve got something and you’ve got it bad.”
“I’ve been purposefully avoiding the paper today.” Harry admitted.
“A Quidditch event?”
“Ginny owled me tickets to her next game, this weekend.”
“Perfect timing!  Maybe you can help me, I was thinking a shade of teal.” Pansy pounced on the color samples, flipping by each color, with a trained eye.
“You’re looking in a right cheerful mood today.” George commented, sounding cheerful enough for the both of them. “We’re getting ready to play a game of Quidditch which you love, for a charity that is for an actual good cause. So what’s up with “ George pushed his eyebrows together into an exaggerated scowl. Harry knew his face didn’t look like that. He might look a bit more serious than usual, but he was not scowling. At the moment.
“It could maybe be fun and hey, maybe Malfoy will be on the other team and you can beat him just like old times.” Ron encouraged.
“That’s even more absurd. Me and Malfoy on a date!” Harry eyed Ron, expecting him to laugh at his own joke, but he didn’t. Instead he just shoved another large bite of food into his mouth to avoid having to say more, but Harry couldn’t believe Ron of all people would suggest such a thing. He hated Malfoy. Didn’t he?  “I
“I’ve not really taken the time to decorate, half the furniture was already here when I moved in and I just kept it.”
“It’s better than Grimmauld Place. I don’t think you’ve been there recently, but at least this place is a little homey.”
“Draco I... love... this shirt that you picked out for me.” Draco shot a sharp elbow into Harry’s ribs and he laughed.
“To get you into bed.” Draco purred. “To make a fantasy of mine come true.”
“It seemed like a good idea at the time.” Harry said, thinking about the hip bone that was visible through Malfoy’s shirt but he wasn’t going to mention it.
“On what?” He purred, hoping to entice Harry to get back to trying to cox him into staying longer.
Harry laughed, “That’s absurd.”
Harry shot Draco’s thigh a look as it sat comfortably on the edge of his desk. The thin material hugged it, showing off the lean muscle underneath. Draco flashed a sexy smile. “I have to get a few changes to my permit.” he volunteered before Potter had a chance to ask him what he wanted. Draco thought he was making it clear what he wanted, but Potter had always been thick.
Pansy leaned forward, looking mildly impressed and holding her empty glass out expectantly for Draco to fill for her.
“And what did you think?”  Harry asked, feeling like he might vomit.
“Ok, see you next week than.” Draco drawled, and turned to leave, as soon as his back was turned, Potter blurted. “Would you want to go to a Harpies game?” Not exactly what Draco had in mind, but…
“Got an extra ticket and it would be good uhm to get ideas for the game.” When Draco turned, Potter looked very determined and Draco wanted to laugh. He looked like he had in fourth year, when facing the prospect of getting the golden egg from the dragon.
“I care about…” Harry took a deep breath, “Fine. I’ll play seeker. Who’s going to be on my team with me?” Harry pictured a team made of Harry’s least favorite people.
“It is a Quidditch event.”
“The elder wand?” Draco asked, looking confused, “That’s a fairy tale.”
“Not that kind of thing.  More like little onesies with funny sayings, and stuffies that sing ridiculous lullabies.”
“So I just have to die to break the curse.” Draco said, rolling his eyes.
Draco was silent for a moment, while he flipped through the channels with the remote that Harry had passed to him.  Then finally asked, “Do you think they sell toilet paper on there?”
“Shopping with Malfoy
“Only George. He was sitting at the table with me.”
“What did he come by for anyways? To ask you to dinner or something, because mate, that's not insinuating.”
“I’m not babysitting.”  Draco mumbled and Harry elbowed him to be quiet.
“Yes. He is my only cousin.” Draco sat up straighter. “And he adores me. Ask him. That is if he still wants to talk to you after he finds out you don’t care about children that have lost their parents.”
“I know, but it’s nice to know that you noticed as well.”  This won him an eye roll, and Draco chuckled. This was actually easier than he had expected. He felt calm and relaxed. He walked up to Potter boldly and ran his arm through his.  “Shall we be on our way then?” He asked, and felt Potter tighten his arm before he apparated them away.
“That was different and need I remind you of last New Year’s.”
“Not if I hex you first, for being a crazy person.”
“Let’s get something clear, Potter.” He took a menacing step forward. “I had already planned on doing a charity. The only thing I added to it was the Quidditch match, which was a stroke of genius, because the ticket sales alone surpassed the last five years worth of raised funds for the WOA.”
“With everyone cooped up for weeks on end, I predict that in nine months from now we will have a major spike in the number of babies being born.”  George explained, waggling his eyebrows at Harry.  “If you know what I mean.”
Draco got the feeling she thought he needed cheering up, but would never come out and say such a thing, it wasn’t their way. Draco’s bedroom door swung open and Blaise walked in. He was wearing robes, but they were short robes, that spoke of practicality, which Blaise didn’t usually show in his clothes. Fashion was hardly ever practical or comfortable.
Five days later Draco found himself down at the DMGS again. He really didn’t know what he seen in Potter. His hair was a mess and his glasses were different, but still atrocious. Even muggles had mastered frameless lenses, but apparently the chosen one had not. He supposed he did have pretty eyes, and his body wasn’t bad to look at...probably. It was hard to tell with the loose robes he chose to wear.
“Why did you run in here to avoid me?” Harry asked, with about as much subtlety as ever.
“Hate? Honestly Harry. If you think Malfoy has changed enough to ask him out then he must have.” Hermione said, sounding reasonable.
“Hermione would never try something without us agreeing and knowing first.” Harry said.
“Less of a git?” Ron suggested.
“I need to stay informed!”  Draco was yelling all the way to the stairs.
“I’m sure he wouldn’t be that upset.” Luna obviously had never seen Draco in a full blown fit.
“He’s an adult, adults are too busy for such nonsense.”
“Yes, I was taking inventory and making sure that we use anything that’s going to expire first.”
“Are you ever planning on telling him that you are hopelessly in love with him or are you just going to be flatmates for the rest of your lives?”
“Well?” Ron finally asked, looking as if the curiosity was going to kill him.
Harry wished he could, but being cool really wasn’t something he was good at.  Draco was though. He was calm and collected as he passed the drinks around, he had even got an extra, for Ginny, noticing her arrival while up at the bar. He had sat down in the seat next to Harry and had casually let his leg, just touch his. Harry’s heart had raced at the gesture as the word date, kept running through his head, making his palms sweaty. It had been a very long time since Harry had been on a date and he had never been good at dating. He hadn’t been good at dating girls and if he had thought for a moment it might be easier with blokes, that idea was soon shattered.
“Wait. Why am I team captain? I never volunteered for that!” Potter complained.
A silence fell over the three of them as they stood in Harry’s sitting room all in their own heads. Hermione finally broke the silence. “It’s getting late.”
“Think of it as an insurance policy, to insure Potter's good behavior.” Zabini gave Harry a gleeful smile that didn't make him feel any better. He was starting to think he had fallen into a nightmare.
“Harry you don’t honestly want to hear Pansy’s trifle gossip.”  Draco said, before magicing Harry’s glass out of his hand with enough force that he was afraid it was going to break upon impact with Draco’s outstretched palm.  All the while bouncing to his feet to retrieve them all refills on their drinks, with sporadic arm gestures.  “It’s not like you are going to be making any bets.”
“Nothing new has happened, we can listen at dinner.”
“You both have horrible taste and would be lucky to have each other.” Draco told the both of them.
They landed in the room Harry had flood to earlier. It was more modern than Harry expected. Malfoy brought to mind old money, like Malfoy manor with rich woods and furniture meant for appearances not use. Draco's flat was simple and cozy with clean white walls and trim. Splashes of color coming from the furniture and decorations.
“All right, I think that’s enough for now.”  Harry cast a spell at the wireless, shutting the voices off mid sentence.
“He’s only the lead singer for the hottest band, Warlocks of London” Hermione said, shaking her head as if Harry had disappointed her by not knowing that.
“Oh, I’ve already sent memo’s to my staff and have them all working from home.  I’m going to have order forms owled to every wizarding home in London and the surrounding areas.  Orders can be sent back and we will ship them.”
“My thoughts exactly.”  Harry mumbled.
Harry was going to meet him here and they would apparate together to the game. Draco fidgeted with a piece of hair that was out of place, feeling nervous and then feeling ridiculous with himself for feeling nervous. What would Potter’s friends say, what would the Weaslette say after the game? The media would say something cruel he was sure, suggest that perhaps Draco had cursed him somehow or slipped something into his drink or food. But none of that mattered. He was getting closer to his goal and then he could cross something off his list and besides. He wouldn’t have to listen to anyone for long. He only had four years left to live. And by god when he was gone, Harry Potter would remember him by something other than all the mistakes he made at school. Draco would make sure of that. It would be a night to remember.
“We got here a little while before you did, Mate.” Ron said, holding a cookie in his hand. Long enough to raid his cabinets, Harry noticed.
Harry turned his angry gaze on Draco, who had a tray of food and drinks floating behind him. The fact that he looked even more attractive with his hair unfixed and shirt casually untucked only managed to make Harry angrier. “What is this?” Harry demanded, the paper crinkling in his fist.
“Perfect.” Potter mumbled.
“Stall them.” He commanded before slamming the bathroom door.
An owl arrived for him when he was out to lunch with Ron. Harry recognized the bird as Malfoy's, his owl would bypass the mail forwarding ward. The owl didn’t wait for a treat. It dropped the letter in his lap without even bothering to land and continued on its way.
“Accio Harry’s wand.” Harry’s wand came flying from behind the nightstand and into Draco’s outstretched hand. He shoved the wand at him as forcefully as the clothes and gave him a push as if to say. Get going. Now!
“But I wore this to Seamus’s wedding last week and you said I looked nice.” Great now he was pouting.
“Then we can fly.”
“I don’t think that’s going to happen anytime soon, with this whole isolation and social distancing stuff going on.”
“What were you right about?”
“Just wait until the fancy dinner afterwards. You won’t have a locker room to hide in then.” George said with an evil grin.
His father still hadn’t came to terms with the fact that Draco wasn’t going to marry into a proper family and have a child to pass on the Malfoy name to. He didn’t care about Draco’s preferences as long as they were private, but the front cover of the paper was the opposite of private. “You are shaming the family name.” His father had accused. Then they had gotten into a fight and Draco had told him that his dad had already managed that by joining a mad man.
And Ron asking, “Did you see the paper today?”
“The elder wand is dangerous.” Hermione piped in.
“I think we would have heard something suspicious by now if the ministry was out to control us.  We do know a few people that work at the ministry.”  George pointed out.  Half his family worked at the ministry and Harry too in case Seamus had forgotten.
“I most certainly don’t know why, but it usually does when it comes to you acting neurotic.” She waved her free hand around the room as if it held proof to his behavior.
“To leave a lasting memory.” Draco was so close that he was able to lean in and whisper into his ear. “It was worth it.” He could hear Potter’s breath hitch. He let his nails rake over the skin along Potter’s neck. “Should I regret it Harry?” His voice husky and barely audible.  Draco found himself in Potter’s arms for the second time that night, only this time it wasn’t a surprise. He could feel Potter’s pulse under his fingers and he knew what he was doing to him.
“Sure. And having the famous Harry Potter in the match would probably double the ticket sells.” Malfoy leaned in, completely sitting on his desk now. “No matter how he bends.”
Draco chanced a look at Potter. He looked surprised, but pleased and his hand returned to his back, as if rewarding him for his good behavior. “Let's take a seat.” Potter suggested leaning to speak in Draco's ear. Draco could get used to being on the arm per say of Harry Potter. But he wouldn’t he firmly reminded himself. This, whatever it was would be was just short term.
“The curse is gone.” Draco felt too shocked to feel anything. Things like this didn’t just happen to him. Waking up with a curse was more like the stuff that happened to him not the other way around. Harry had climbed out of the bed and was casting his own spells and physically searching and touching his neck as if the ring was just faded and if he looked hard enough he would find it. His wandering hands soon, widened their exploration and Draco found himself back in the bed. Draco would get to the bottom of this as soon as he got home. Which would be when he finally managed to get away from Harry.
Draco let the warm water run over him. Unfortunately he only had thirty minutes before he needed to be at the dining hall before the guests started to arrive. He would love nothing more than to spend at least that much time working the tension out of his sore muscles, but after the match he was obligated to stick around with the rest of the team for a few pictures.  They had won as Draco had expected. Both teams had played well making for an entertaining game and then Harry had caught the snitch recklessly diving low to the ground, one knee actually skidded across the grass. Perhaps that was why Harry made a better Seeker, because Draco wasn’t dumb enough to attempt harming himself for a game.
The next day Draco tried to get up and leave early, but Harry was very persuasive and somehow Draco ended up staying almost the entire next day. Harry’s bedroom wasn’t as bad as his living room and his bed although not up to Draco’s standards was suffiseable. Otherwise no amount of Harry’s methods, which included lots of kissing would have been able to keep him there.
Draco rolled his eyes.  As if the lead singer to a band was competition to the Savior of the wizarding world.
“Darling, get up I have a wonderful surprise for you today.” She was dressed in tight pants and a sturdy, but still fashionable, looking pair of boots that rose up mid calf. Her top was a fitted jacket that fell below her hips, she looked like she was going to be taking up equestrianism. “I was going to wait until your birthday, but things have moved faster than planned and well...I don’t want to wait. I want to do it today.”
alone.  Why was Potter making this so difficult. He liked men, and Draco knew he was an attractive man. Potter would be lucky to have him. Yet he continued to act oblivious to Draco’s advances. He had tried to get out of going for a drink and then had only stayed for one. What was it he was looking for in another man? Apparently not gorgeous and witty.
“How so?” Ron asked, his mouth full of food.
She was right and Draco stood up to get Hermione a drink, leaving Harry with nothing else to do but to put the fruit tray up and go see who else was here.
“I’m sorry.” He said, speeding through his apology, he also hated saying sorry, but Pansy was a friend and wouldn’t dwell on it. “This has nothing to do with Potter. I just don’t see why I should hide it. To spare others? To pretend it isn’t there? I don’t care to do either.”
Draco usually avoided dark-dusty places, especially when they required the manual labor of crawling in said dust to reach it. But this was the Valley of the Kings. A place that he had dreamed of visiting since he was a child. He had begged his mother and father to take him when he was thirteen. He had learned about the secrets of the tombs in his ancient runes class. Rune magic could be traced back to ancient Egypt and it was said that the Pharaoh Ramses I, tomb was completely covered in magical runes, that to this day has been unable to be fully translated or broken.  Muggles were mostly fascinated with King Tut, obviously not knowing about the amount of magical power that the Ramses were believed to hold. Draco’s eyes flickered over the wall of runes. Each rune carefully etched neatly into the stone, until thousands of them seemed to form the wall. It vibrated with power and energy, that was lost to the wizarding world today.
“Then I suggest you leave and yes you can call, we will talk. Maybe go to dinner.” Harry didn’t miss the pause or the maybe. Liking neither, he realized that he was never promised more than another one off and he might not get another, especially after Draco talked to his parents. Who knew what they would have to say? Harry had no doubt that they were front page again. Draco stepped back, probably to find his own clothes and without thinking Harry stepped forward and pulled the resistant blond into a crushing kiss. Incentive that’s what he needed to give Draco. It wasn’t like he was completely immune to Harry. He had wanted him just as much last night as Harry had him and he would remind him of that before he left. He was probably giving the still watching Pansy and Blaise more of a show then they had planned on, but they had already seen him naked and Harry was past the point of caring. He forced Draco’s mouth open, not that much force was needed, he had caught him by surprise and his mouth opened with a mumbled “Oh”. It was a slow, relaxed kiss that he hoped promised more, before finally pulling back he caught Draco’s bottom lip between his teeth and gently sucked. Draco looked flushed when Harry broke the kiss and stepped back. Feeling bold, he gave Draco a smug grin and a wink before apparating away.
He managed to pull his arm free without waking up Draco.  His eyes were closed and his hair had fallen softly across his pale, peaceful face.  He looked beautiful and it made Harry’s heart hurt in his chest, that he wasn’t allowed to love him the way he wanted.  Draco had made that clear a long time ago, when they were still at Hogwarts.
Potter wasn’t gone long before Draco heard the shuffling of his feet as he came back carrying a tray with two mismatched mugs. Why am I not surprised?
Harry narrowed his eyes at both his friends. “Why aren’t you two upset?” He asked sitting up straighter and tossing the pillow off his lap. “I know I’ve been kind of a homebody, but...you guys hate Malfoy. So why are you okay with the fact that I invited him to the game and that you will both be forced to sit with him and go to drinks with him?”
“I bet on You and Draco.”  She said, batting her eyes.  “And Greengrass and Smith.  There was no way that was going to last.”
Potter didn’t answer right away. He fidgeted with a piece of material, showing interest for the first time in them all night. “No. I’m not.” He answered, sounding invasive.
“Since you ask.” Malfoy said, and Harry could almost swear that he fluttered his eyelashes at him. Long pail eyelashes.
“A drink?” Draco swept across the room to a buffet cabinet with multiple crystal decanters on it and glasses. Without waiting for a response he filled two glasses half up. He took a seat down on the settee placing the drinks on the table in front of him and patting the cushion next to him, inviting Harry to come sit next to him. Harry took up the offer with pleasure. Sitting next to Draco seemed like a wonderful place to be at the moment or possibly any moment.
The following laughter, that came from the otherside of the door, cut off as Draco cast a silencing charm and then a locking one from beside him.  The spells more controlled now that he was using his wand.
Draco joined his two friends in the kitchen. He had matched his style of dress to theirs. A pastry and cappuccino was already waiting in an open spot for him.  “So where are we going?” Draco asked, not really expecting an answer, but hoping for some kind of clue.
“You don’t know who that is mate do you?” Ron asked.
“An interview. In his dreams.” Draco said. Harry still had his chin resting on his shoulder, he shifted and kissed Draco on the cheek, his hot breath brushing against his ear.
“I didn’t realize I needed to get out so desperately.” Harry commented, bringing a flush to Ron’s face.
“Ready to head back to bed?”  Draco sent the cups floating to the sink, while Harry yawned again and nodded his head.
“Like I'd trust you to keep your word.” Draco wiggled the fingers of his open hand.
Draco transfigured the hard chair in the corner of Pansy’s office into a large plush chair and dropped into it. “Well, I have a permit for a Quidditch charity event that I’m expected to pull together in two weeks.”
Harry followed a few steps behind, trying not to laugh. Draco didn’t like being laughed at, unless he was purposely trying to make you laugh, then he expected you to laugh and loudly.
“Why would it?”
The game was crowded as expected. Potter, lead Draco through the crowd, placing a gentle hand on his back from time to time. Draco liked the feel of it. Along with the feel of the eyes on them as they passed by, probably wondering what the Chosen One was doing with the likes of Draco, but he didn’t care. He was Potter’s chosen company today. He didn’t even feel disgruntled about having to spend the day with Granger and Weasel. The two bounced up from their seats when they spotted Draco and Potter, waiving them over. They smiled broadly at their friend, their smile stiffened when they turned their attention on Draco, but is seemed more out of uncertainty of how Draco would interact with them, then out of any sort of malice or dislike.
Draco adjusted the collar of the dark green robes he was wearing. It was nice to have an excuse to wear green again; he wanted to show his support for the Harpies since he was going to be sitting on their side. He wore a black muggle t shirt underneath he thought it would appeal to Harry’s tastes. He did ask him to the game after all when he was wearing a muggle shirt and jeans.
better.
“Event permits are down the hall.  I would think you would know where.”
“Anything else?” Draco asked, “That you might want?” Potter, stopped fidgeting and scowled at Draco. Making Draco wonder if he’d gone too far, but Potter seemed so thick, that he didn’t think that if he wasn’t more obvious he might not notice at all.
“I mean how long have you felt this way and said nothing?”
“It’s been hours since I’ve had an update.  I need to stay informed.”  Draco tried ducking under Harry’s arm, but Harry moved to block him again and a small skirmish broke out in the doorway to the kitchen.
“And what if it lasts longer than a month?”
“I think we are past the small talk stage. Don’t you?” Draco’s voice sounded low and Harry felt his stomach flutter. Draco reached forward to grab the two glasses of liquor off the table using the action to draw even nearer to Harry, his leg was now pressing against Harry’s. And his elegant figures brushed Harry’s when he handed Harry his own glass.
“You never did say who you betted on.”  Harry pointed out, his arm draped along the back of the cushion, behind Draco.
Draco sat leaning against a locker, relaxed and listening. He had removed his hot robes, sitting in a thin t-shirt and dark grey jeans, that both clung to him. He had thought about casting a drying spell, but then decided not to, realizing what he must look like and hoping that Potter would take notice.  So far Potter hadn’t seemed to be looking at him much at all, and Draco was starting to think he was sitting wet and uncomfortable for nothing, but once everyone started shuffling out the door, Potter called, “eh, uh Draco. Can I have a word with you?”
“Is there something you need, Malfoy?”  Draco found that flirting with Potter wasn’t an easy task.  Potter’s tone got under his skin and Draco could feel his sultry expression beginning to morph into the well practiced sneer that just happened when he looked at Potter’s stupid face.  But he was on a mission, the list wasn’t going to finish itself.
Harry shuffled behind the three of them with little excitement.  He knew that Draco would want him to join them to make it seem like that was what they were planning on doing and a nightly habit of theirs, which it wasn’t.
“Nothing!” Harry jumped to assure, not wanting to tell either one of them that he had asked Malfoy out, then getting pale at the thought. What if he said yes? Then they would know and he would have to go out with Malfoy. It took all his self control not to smack himself and say the word stupid again.
An arse with a nice arse, Harry admitted before looking away. Not knowing if he was more angry at Draco for the list or for the fact that he now couldn’t stop looking and thinking about him and he couldn’t have him because Draco had said he was only interested in a one off. Or himself for not being able to stop.
“Yes, he is a popular face and if I recall he used to play beater.”
19. Shag Harry Potter
“Right abough wa?” Ron asked, his words muffled by a large bite of fish.
“Oh Harry. You are possibly a lost cause.” Draco sighed. Calling Potter by his first name seemed to get a reaction out of him. He looked surprised for a second and then pleased. Draco decided to call him by his first name more often.  “You will just have to trust me to pick something out that looks good. It will go faster and then we can go get a drink as your reward.”
“Well another thought I had isn’t really a cure. It would cure Draco but…” She looked at Draco hesitantly. “It’s a transfer spell. I found a case dealing with a blood curse similarly cast. The family was able to track down a living relative of the caster and then was able to manipulate the curse enough to transfer it to a blood relative of the cursed. It’s very complicated. Do you know who put the curse on you?”
“Congrats, Ginny.” Harry said, standing to wrap her into a sisterly hug. She patted his shoulder in return a large grin on her face. They had managed to stay friends after their breakup. They had gone through a rough patch for a moment, but then Harry had realized why he didn’t want her and when he had finally confessed, it was a relief to both of them. Harry didn’t have to feel guilty and Ginny didn’t have to feel inadequate and then she had got the position on the Harpies. She had confessed to Harry one night that she was glad they had broke up. She didn’t really want the strain of a relationship, while traveling and trying to get her Quidditch career off the ground.
7. Get a pygmy puff
Draco let go of his own resolve and joined Harry in laughing.  The sound made his stomach flutter, like it often did, and Harry realized that it had been days since he had heard Draco laugh.  He would have to make sure that he made him laugh everyday.
“As if.” They both said at the same time. Pansy sounding scandalized and Blaise with a bored tone. Pansy and Blaise both scrunched their face and looked at each other equally offended that the other would be so quick to dismiss the other. They shot into arguing with each other.
Draco finally allowed himself to lean in and in a voice even Potter wouldn’t be oblivious to, said, “Maybe we could make it my business.”
“Shopping with Malfoy?” Harry asked. There was no way that was going to be fun. Harry hated shopping at the best of times.
“It will pass in a few weeks, you’ll see.”
“I think the risk would be lower than it sounds with the spell being so easy to control and reverse. It’s common medical practice.”
“Sure.”
“That is so typical, Malfoy.” So it’s Malfoy now that didn’t take long. “I’m not an idiot.”
“It’s just a bunch of our annoying friends.”  Harry grabbed a hold of Draco on his way by stopping him from triple checking the placement of the pillows.  “Here have a pre-party drink.”  Harry held up the drink he had just made for himself.  Draco needed it more than him.
“That sounds lovely.”
“Sure, Malfoy.”  Harry kept from rolling his eyes, but by the look Draco shot him, he didn’t think he was hiding the fact that he wanted to.  “Do you want me to give you a hand with…” Harry waved at the floating bags and array of items. “Er, all this.”
“Should really learn to shut your bedroom door mate.”  George commented.
“I need an event permit.”  He said, keeping his voice smooth with great effort.
“Ginny!” He heard his friends greet, with the enthusiasm to portray their joy for her that she won. Harry turned his attention from Draco making his way gracefully to the bar, not without disappointment, and greeted Ginny with the other two.
He couldn’t believe that stupid article. More than friendly, it was a work dinner. He had been working with Ezra on the updates of this years Quidditch rules and regulations. Some changes had been made and Ezra was president of the IQL board. There had been nothing romantic about it. And as far as stalking Smith in school. He had followed him one time and it had been an accident, he had been trying to follow Malfoy and had accidentally followed the wrong blond. He wasn’t stalking Malfoy either. It had been completely legit detective work, which he often liked to remind his friends was warranted, because he had been right. Malfoy had been up to something. He was always up to something and today wasn’t any different. Malfoy had come strolling into his office as if he were Harry’s boss and was expecting a full report to be placed in his manicured hands. One tightly clothed thigh practically sitting on the edge of his desk.
“That we are stupid, but mostly you.”
“Then why didn’t you ever say or do anything again.”
“I suppose I should get up and practice my flying.” He told the owl, who moved to the window to eat it’s reward. It wouldn’t do to look rusty in front of Potter. He might be trying to woo him, but that didn’t mean he didn’t want to be better than him still. And he was going to be as good a keeper as he was as a seeker and then he would be better than Potter, because Potter only played the one position. He smiled to himself looking forward to the fresh air and Potter grudgingly telling Draco that he was an amazing keeper.
“My moon roses are in full bloom. You will have to come over for dinner to see them.” She looked so pleased, or as pleased as she would show in public. “You are invited as well, Harry.” She added almost as an afterthought, but Draco could tell the smile she gave him was genuine.
“You just want to watch more fairy sex scenes.”  Harry teased.
“You’re going to have to come over for dinner tonight and explain what happened.”
He placed the parchment down on the counter and began a pot of coffee, he had that tired, wired look about him, like he had stayed up all night again.  “I stayed up all night, working on a new line of products to alleviate the isolation blues.”  George said, confirming Harry’s suspicions.
“Don’t think it escaped my notice that you just happened to be at Pansy’s at such an early hour.” Pansy looked affronted and Blaise rolled his eyes.
“We can still apparate.”
Harry was panting by the time they finally pulled apart.  Draco’s breathing was steady, but his eyes were huge and he looked like he might be shocked at what had just happened.  Draco adjusted his position on the bed, which would have put distance between them, if Harry hadn’t moved closer, not willing to let Draco go yet.  Or anytime soon.  Harry nuzzled into Draco’s neck, smelling the warmth on his skin and the fresh scent of his shampoo, as the silky strands brushed Harry’s cheek.  Draco’s hands were still loosely wrapped around Harry.  Harry pressed his lips against Draco’s neck, trailing his way from the base up towards the ear junction.  Harry could feel Draco’s erratic pulse just below the skin and hear his breath starting to catch.
Potter’s hands pulled Draco tighter to him, his body pressing him against the counter. Draco’s fingers tightened around his wand and without consciously thinking about it apparated them both to his flat. Harry didn’t act like he noticed until he leaned into Draco even more and without the counter for support toppled them both onto the floor of Draco’s bedroom.
“What if he says yes?” Harry asked, feeling pale.
“Let me get this straight. You are the master of the elder wand. I was the master of the elder wand? That’s...that’s just ridiculous.”
“Not you too mate?”
“I didn’t mind helping lift the hex either. I’ve never done that kind of magic before, only read about it.”
“I think I will use this as the cover for the interview you two are going to give me tomorrow.”
“How have you been holding up in these trying times?”  Pansy asked, after taking a sip of her wine.  Harry couldn’t tell if she was being sarcastic or not.  He never could with Pansy.
“Oh no you don’t.”  Harry said, getting in front of him before he was able to make it.
“Pretend you love each other.” Blaise said, winking at Draco. Draco wanted to hex that smirk off his face.
“Good Morning, Potter.” Draco greeted, not even bothering to take the time to lean on his desk. Potter looked up with a worried expression, as if he would be required to go to lunch again or fill out more paperwork.  “Don’t worry, nothing is required of you. I am just here to drop off the final list of your team.” Draco flicked his wand and a single piece of paper appeared on Potter’s desk. “I can’t stay to keep your day from getting droll. I have seven meetings today, starting with a promise to Pansy that I would take her to lunch.”
“Why didn’t you tell us?” Harry asked, he didn’t know what he would have done if anything differently with this knowledge but it would have been nicer to know that Draco wasn’t a complete git sooner.
“We went to a Quidditch game and I’m participating in a charity. That is it.”
“Until you are actually believable when you say it.”
“I can’t believe you were able to get us in here. They haven’t allowed the public down here for almost fifteen years.” Which was the reason that his parents hadn’t brought him. He believed that his dad was unable to pull enough strings or he was using his strings for other means and wasn’t willing to use one for such a thing.
Harry didn't leave his flat the entire day, blocking his floo for extra measures. The last thing he needed was someone mentioning Malfoy to him. He didn't think he could be held responsible for what would happen to them under the circumstances. The more he thought about it, the more all the pieces seemed to fall into place. The plotting, the persuasion, the entire Quidditch charity event! Draco was a ridiculous git. He'd always been one. Why had Harry ever thought he had changed?
“We will start planning at lunch.” She said, he was going to have to buy her an entire new wardrobe to pay for this one.
“We’ll just listen to what she has to say and think about it.” Harry was saying as if they were now in this together. Harry had distracted Draco with his pretty eyes and flirtatious touches and manipulated Draco into coming here to meet with Granger about possible ways to break the curse and once Draco was clear headed again decided he would be a fool not to listen to her ideas, she was very smart when it came to research.
Harry opened his mouth, but then shut it.
He wandered down the hall poking his head in the open doors, but none of them were fostering his missing blonde.
“Berlin” Harry spoke out loud and the map’s image transformed from London into the city of Berlin. Grinning Harry left the map and walked to the desk wondering what kind of wood it was built from. When he looked back at the map it had resumed the image of the whole world again. Harry ran a hand over the wood admiring the smooth texture. A piece of paper sitting on top caught Harry's attention because his name was clearly written twice. He picked it up and read over the itemized list.
Draco put on an easy smile, getting along with Potter’s best mates would be a big step in the right direction.  “Hello, Weasley and Granger.” He greeted holding a hand out. Both accepted his hand with a shake, Granger's a little firmer than Weasley's, Draco noted.
Harry took a second to look offended before asking, “What’s not a big deal? I’ll decide for myself.”
“Blaise you owe me for winning our little bet.”  Pansy said.
“He wasn’t bloody flirting with me.” Harry argued, but he might as well been arguing to the paper, as much as Ron was listening through his laughter.
“No, but with them both home and not working they will start driving each other up the wall.  They’ll fight, Ron will end up on my sofa, then he will go home and apologise, they’ll make up and that’s how babies are made.”
“That looks like the exact same color.”
“Bloody Hell Harry! You aren’t actually going uniform shopping with Malfoy?”
Before Ron apparated away Harry asked him, “What’s Rubert’s Disease?”
“Technically he was living here before you or me.”  Harry pointed out.  Harry had allowed George to live here while Harry was at Hogwarts so that he could be closer to work and get away from the Burrow, after confessing to Harry that he was finding it suffocating and that he couldn’t stand sleeping in his old room anymore.
“Sounds like you're the adventurous type.”
“I set up charities all the time.” Draco said, neither admitting or denying the possible truth of Potters words.
“For a bit of light reading.” Harry joked.
“Perfect.” Draco said, turning to head to Batton’s desk.
“Not everyone is doing well with this social separation business.  We stopped off to see Blaise earlier and he is about to climb the walls.  Of course he put on a brave face for us, but he had that look in his eyes, similar to fifth year, when Quidditch got cancelled by that horrid troll.”
Harry felt his face heat up. Apparently Malfoy had read the paper this morning.
“Sure you don’t want us to leave and come back later?” Ron asked, with a pained expression on his face.  He still didn’t understand what Harry saw in Draco.  He was clearly blind.  Harry was about to tell him that they could do just that, when the floo sounded again.
Potter’s eyes got as big as two green saucers, and then his face turned three different shades of red.  “Very funny, Malfoy.”
Hermione waved a hand. “He doesn’t want to seem too eager. It’s not a big deal Harry.”
“That sounds too risky.” Harry said, when Draco looked like he was giving the idea serious consideration.
“I wasn’t placed in Slytherin, just because I’m a pureblood darling.” Pansy said, looking pleased with herself.
“I had it imported from Italy. It’s up and coming.”
“You don’t think it’s a problem that you once stomped on Potter’s face?”
“Sorry mate.” Ron said, lowering his voice.
“I will have to check my schedule.” Draco waived an uninterested hand in the air, and in a bored tone said, “I’ll owl you.”
“A free pass.” Draco had repeated. Draco did not feel like he had ever had a free pass in his life. And he would never call a death sentence a free pass.
Ginny giggled and with the same tone added. “Eyewitnesses say that Harry Potter took Malfoy home, apparating them both after leaving the bar arm in arm.”
He downed his tea and scooping up the paper, rushed to the fireplace to floo to Pansy’s. He threw in a handful of powder, stating Pansy’s place of residents. An empty sitting room greeted him upon his arrival. Pansy was known to stay in bed until noon, so Draco wasn’t surprised that she wasn’t in the dining room either. He flung open Pansy’s bedroom door, brandishing the paper for her to see.
“It’s not so much the wand is dangerous it’s just if people knew about it then…”
“Looks like it’s just us again.” Harry commented once he heard the floo woosh. He looked up at Draco, who’s gray eyes narrowed, but Harry didn’t miss the dart they made towards his bedroom door.
8. Go to a muggle moving picture
“Very Funny.”
Ron looked around as if he expected a reporter to be sitting at the adjacent table, smiling with their camera out.
Harry cringed. “Well, I’ll try to get out more.” He finally conceded.
Draco shot Potter an icy look. As if?
“Is that how you justify having dinner last night with a certain someone?” Pansy said, batting her eyelashes, with a knowing smirk.
“There’s no need to research the second one.” Draco said, but Harry knew it was a wasted request Hermione would most likely research all three and the one’s she didn’t even tell them about and then find a couple other options as well.
Ron’s laughter, wasn’t putting Harry’s spirits any higher. “That’s great, next you will be going with him to pick out team uniforms.” Harry stuffed a bit of his dinner into his mouth and looked down at his plate of food, which was looking more and more interesting compared to Ron.
“That’s what Malfoy said.”
15. Ride a hippogriff
“They’re bloody amazing, we’ve been to see them three times.” Ron said.
Harry trudging on with, “I do both sometimes.” Sounding a bit desperate and too loud to his own ears.
Pansy let out an easy laugh.  “Trouble in paradise?”
“Because you had practice with him today.” Ron said, as if it were obvious, “Besides only Malfoy is obnoxious enough to make you get that look on your face.
“He’s wearing off his welcome.”  Draco said, but he was smiling so Harry didn’t think he really meant that.
“Does it help clear the head? Or perhaps increase circulation? Enhance sex?” He waggled his eyebrows at Luna.
“That’s not going to happen here.  We are going to spend a couple weeks, relaxing and watching too much telly.  The worst thing that’s going to happen is you’re going to get bored and sick of my cooking.”
Draco’s face flushed.  “I didn’t think you would really like someone like me, when you were sober.”
“So what color do you think you will er go with for your team?” Potter asked, struggling to make conversation. Draco, grinned down at the teal he thought was his favorite.
“It’s Malfoy now?” Ron asked, raising a brow, as if to ask, “Bad news?”
“No pictures.” The guard barked.
“We don’t have time for this.” Pansy snatched the camera out of Zabini’s hand and flashing him her own glare pressed a few buttons. “Now they’re gone and we can move on.”
“Don’t try to win Draco to your side, by name dropping his most recent obsession.”
“You are thinking about working for Luna Lovegood?” Draco asked, placing a hand up to touch the wall.
11. Give to Pansy (a child with our genes would be unstoppable)
“Like you suggested.” Harry added, realizing this was all Ron’s fault made him feel a little better.
Pansy was silent for a moment, he could tell she was sifting through and analyzing each word. Finally she took a sip of her wine. “Darling this wine is fabulous. I can’t believe I’ve never heard of it before.”
Harry must have looked confused, because Draco continued.  “That night you kissed me, I thought you were just drunk.  I didn’t think you actually liked me!”
“Blaise asked me if we wanted to place a bet on who would get pregnant first.”  Pansy announced.
“No, I just like the taste.” She said, taking the glass from Blaise and taking a drink from it before handing it back.
She punched him hard in the shoulder, “Draco Malfoy! Harry, you have almost unlimited options and you choose, Malfoy.”
Draco’s logic didn’t make any sense, as usual.
“I know it will. I’m not really worried about the virus, it's just, I hate being stuck here...stuck anywhere.  What if they shut down the floo and we can’t leave.”  Draco looked like he was starting to work himself up in a mild panic at the thought.
“I didn’t know you were dating anyone.”
“That is a start darling.”
Draco was intrigued.  He sat up in his bed, feeling excited. A surprise for him. “I will dress and join you two in a flash.” Draco said, throwing the covers off.
“Finn Pinkerton!” Hermione sat up in her chair, almost throwing the food off her fork, in a Ronlike manner.
“Just think of each person in the stands as twenty pounds going towards orphaned children.”
“I’m not going to go around spreading gossip about Zabini or anyone else.”  Harry slouched as much as the straight back would allow him to.
Harry’s brows furrowed. Was he really that much a recluse? He went out with Ron for lunch all the time and went over to Ron and Mione’s house for dinner regularly. And granted it had been awhile since he went to the Burrow, but...he liked to spend Sunday’s at home and catch up on housework and paperwork. What was wrong with that?
“About Malfoy.”
“Most definitely not.” Draco would kill him if he found out that he hadn't been dying and that Blaise knew the entire time and didn’t tell him. It had been a little bit of a misunderstanding really. Blaise hadn't expected the ring to appear on Draco's neck like that and he really hadn't expected everyone to freak out and think he had Rubert's Disease. When he found out he had went to the manor to fully intending to tell Draco the truth. He showed up expecting Draco to be a complete mess, crying about the injustices of the world. Instead he found Draco calm, slightly drunk, but optimistic. Ready for the first time to take charge of his life instead of living his life for his parents and doing what he must instead of what he wants. So he had decided to wait, for just a little while. Honestly Draco would probably still be living at the manor pretending to be straight if it wasn’t for Blaise. He should really be thanking him, but then he would have to tell him. Maybe in a few years.
“Yeah. See you two later.” Harry walked them to the floo.
“He was wearing a glamour.”
“With all our friends and family here.”  Ron continued.
“Dinner!  That is several more hours away.”
Draco raised a brow, then without answering, sauntered back towards Potter.  “Uhm,” Potter said, looking down at his feet and looking slightly flushed. Since Harry wasn’t looking at him, Draco didn’t even bother trying to hide his smug smile. Finally, he thought.  “I was thinking that you could bring the uniforms next practice. So that everyone can get them sized before the game. If you’ve got them yet, that is.”
“Hmm. No.” He said.
“What are the other options?” Harry pushed forward. He did not want someone casting a spell to temporarily kill Draco.
“Is Draco trying to be funny again?” Pansy came over carrying a single sample. Potter looked down at it with relief. “Darling, how many times must I tell you, stick to what your good at: sarcasm and good hair.”
1. Find a cure for Rubert’s Disease
“I like my wand better.” Harry shrugged.
The End
“They will care.” Draco informed him.
“That’s true mate.”  George agreed.
“Hermione’s brilliant.” Harry said sounding more confident in his friend than anyone had a right to. “Not that you aren’t brilliant too, but sometimes it helps when you aren’t as close to the thing.”
18. Get my wand back from Harry Potter
“In here.” Harry gave Draco a squeeze before pulling his arm back and sitting up to greet Hermione.
“You would be so lucky.” Pansy said.
“You look nice Harry.” Draco praised, using his first name for an extra touch. A light blush formed on his cheeks and he looked down at his shoes, seeming embarrassed by the compliments
Harry read over the letter twice, despite the considerable length. He didn’t know what to make of it. It said a lot, all while emitting a lot more. And the very end guilt tripping him with Teddy and orphaned children. He had some nerve.
“To your bedroom?” Potter waved a hand at the neatly made bed, then looked away as if it were indecent for him to see it.
“Draco really. We are in public.” His mom scolded, but whether she was scolding about the elbow or the public display of affection he didn’t know. His mother was a firm believer in keeping that sort of thing behind closed doors. Draco rolled his eyes and turning around pulled Harry into a kiss. Letting his tongue explore for an inappropriately long time. Harry was flushed when Draco pulled away. He didn’t want to get too carried away. He would save that for later in the men’s lounge.
“Why didn’t you say anything?” Pansy whined, despite her teasing, Draco knew that she would want to take Blaise out to celebrate.
“What did he say?”
“I did not.” Blaise denied.
“I could apparate you home if you wanted.” Harry volunteered, saving himself from having to ask Draco to his place after all. Perhaps that was Draco’s plan all along, he was devious like that. Harry got the feeling that every move he made tonight was somehow orchestrated by Draco, which only made Harry want him more.
“By the way I don't have your wand. If I did I would've returned it by now. I turned it over to the ministry at their request.” With that said Harry slammed the door with a satisfactory thunk, took a deep breath, and apparated home.
“No it’s not.” Harry said. “It was Dumbledore’s wand. Then you disarmed him and then I disarmed you.”
“Dunno Mate. Maybe in school, his fighting with you was his way of flirting. And now he’s older, he’s figured out there’s a better way.”
10. Freeze sperm
“Did you go for drinks afterwards?” Ron asked his voice still forced casualness.
“I’m starving.”  He said to break it.
“They didn’t last a week.”  Nott added, his hand slowly trailing circles on Pansy’s thigh.
“Draco, did you cast a glamour?”
“Of course.”  As if proof, Draco picked a chip off his plate and popped it in his mouth.
“Did you make a bet?”  Draco asked, twirling the last of his whiskey, with a superior look on his face.
“I’ve just been tuning in now and then for updates.  I’ve not been just sitting here.”  Harry hated to think about how often, now and then was.
Potter rolled his eyes, and Draco could feel his cool slipping away. He wanted to grab his wand and hex Potter or grab him and throttle him, but then that idea didn’t seem like all that much of a punishment for Potter.
“Three times? Where was I?”
“Oh, thank you Harry!” She beamed at Harry and then at Ron, “Can you imagine if the Warlocks of London play at our wedding!”  Ron gave Harry a shrug.
“What is your plan?”
Draco poured Harry a whiskey as well, without asking if he wanted one.
“You know Harry, this thing could be fun.” Hermione suggested, after she calmed down about Finn Pinkerton.
Harry didn’t know if he ever ended up paying. The room got more crowded, as all the Weasleys and a few others piled in from the adjoining room.  “Everyone gather round.  We have an announcement to make.”  Ron gave Ginny a shove to the side so that he could make his way to the center of the room, pulling Hermione along behind him.
The pause in the kiss was long enough for Draco to get his senses back. “What are you doing?” Draco had been talking to himself, but Potter thinking the question was directed at him broke the contact and leaned back to sit on his shins.
“No, he’s still a git.” Harry recalled the way Draco had laughed at the waiters suggestion that they try the fritter and gravy. As if his sophisticated taste buds were well above, such food as a fritter. Harry had thought it sounded good, but had been unwilling to order it from the harassed looking waiter.  Then when the bill arrived, he hadn’t even reached for the check. He looked straight at Harry, as if to say, "you don’t really expect me to pay do you?"
“I put myself out there and he doesn’t want to seem too eager.”
“What else?” Harry asked, sounding a little loud in the small sitting room.
“Who did you bet on?”  Harry asked, somewhat curious.
Harry rolled his eyes, thinking it was still a stretch.  After another pause, he finally asked, “What should I do? About Malfoy. Should I say something to him?"
“Probably not.”  Harry muttered, while trying not to think about the alternative to that.  Spending the next couple weeks passing the time having lots of sex together.  Harry swallowed and almost tripped walking up the steps.  The subject dropped and they were soon in Harry’s room passing the time, not having sex.
“I thought you might be bi.” Potter huffed, not appreciating being laughed at. “Besides I hardly know you, why would anything be obvious about you?”
“I play still, but I repeat. Why?”
“George?”
“The red ring is gone.” He said. Draco, looked down as if he would be able to see his own neck, then annoyed at himself, jumped up to go to the mirror. His reflection proved Harry’s words. His neck was all pale, creamy skin with only a single bruise from Harry’s mouth on his collarbone, marring it. The familiar red ring was gone.
“Stay. Go. It’s your choice.” Draco said, sounding as if he could care less either way. “But nothings changed. I don’t want any...future misunderstandings.” Draco gave Potter a belittling smirk. Then cursed his own face. Why did Potter always bring out this side of him. Potter’s open expression slammed closed. His big eyes that had looked so sweet and charming, narrowed before he clumsily climbed to his feet.
Harry took a pepper up potion before leaving the house for work and tucked a second one in his pocket. He would need it.
“I haven’t noticed anything suspicious.”  Harry agreed.  “I think they are just trying to keep the death toll down.  I mean we still aren’t recovered from all we’ve lost in the war.”
“Yes. It could perhaps be strong enough to break the curse. If we don’t tell anyone then I think the danger would be minimal.” She said, looking at Harry skeptically and looking at Draco as if she were hoping he would keep it a secret.
“Well, you seem to get wrapped up in work and I know at first you didn’t like going out because of the attention, but your only 23-not-53!”
“And what do my loving parents have to say?” Draco asked, leaning back against the padded headboard.
“So no one else knows?” Harry asked.
“Just woke up and couldn’t fall back asleep.”
“Malfoy’s not the other team captain?” Hermione asked, she had been uncharacteristically quiet, as of now.
“Not that.”  Draco said, finally moving to an upright position.  “What George said, do you really...have feelings for me?”
“Not really.” Harry admitted, “I mean it’s a bit strange. We never got along in school, why all of a sudden would he begin flirting with me?”
“That sounds like a better idea than what I was picturing.”
“You work too much Harry.” Hermione said. Ron shook his head in agreement, with his fiance. Not that, that was a new occurrence.
“I’m not going to tell anyone.” Draco told her, looking offended that she would think he would.
“Did you do something?” He turned to Harry. Did he go get the elder wand and cast something while Draco was sleeping, in an exhausted, sound state.
Both Harry and Ron spoke at the same time.
“Draco.” Called his mother’s voice from the floo. Draco’s felt the panic settling in and felt his eyes go wide. “Go stall!” he pleaded not able to keep the franticness out of his voice.
A chuckle, made them both freeze.  “I see you two have finally got on with it.”  Harry twisted to see George standing in the doorway once again with his arms crossed, looking humored and obnoxious.
“No, this is amateur only. The one that owns the prank shops.”
“Should I come back later?”  Both Draco and Harry froze, Harry looked behind him to find George standing on the bottom step looking amused.
“Draco, we have enough food to last us over a month if need be.”
“I didn’t think about it. And Fred’s funeral wasn’t something I wanted to bring up at the time.” Harry could tell that it still wasn’t and was sorry for pushing him into talking about it now.
Harry blushed at the thought of repeating it, “Well it wasn’t really what he said so much, more of how he said it. In an insinuating way I suppose.”
“There is a case study of Robert Humfrey being cursed with Rubert’s Disease. He had ended up dying of a potion overdose. But it is recorded that when they took him to the hospital the curse was gone.” She looked up and looked over at Harry uncertainty, which Harry didn’t like because that meant that she knew he wasn’t going to like this idea.
“Mate this is a date.” Ron said, Hermione nodding her head in agreement.
“Would you like to participate? In the Quidditch match. I could use another seeker.”
“Marvelous. Bye.” And Blaise was gone.
“If you insist.” Draco said, flying past Harry into the closet before he had a chance to change his mind. He had been dying to pick out Harry’s clothes, but he didn’t want to seem controlling. And usually he liked making Harry have to go change, because he liked watching him undress, but they really were in a hurry and this was the first time that they would be attending an event with his parents as a couple and he wanted Harry to make a good impression. If that was possible.
Down stairs he found the kitchen light on and Draco sitting at the table drinking a cup of warm tea, the steam puffing up from the cup.
“I gave them all the option, not a single one of them said they wanted the time off.”
“Ginny?” She was a chaser for the Holyheads Harpies.
“Perhaps.”  Seamus shrugged, “But complacency is just asking for someone to step up and take advantage.  We the people need to be involved and watchful.  We can’t just assume that the ministry has our best interests in mind.”
“Sure mate.  I’ve got to run.  Unlike you I have someone in my room that didn’t just accidently fall asleep there and she’s going to be wondering if I ran all the way to the store for this.”  He held up a plate stacked with a variety of foods that didn’t seem to go together.  George picked a single blueberry up and popped it in his mouth.
Draco shot up so fast he almost fell out of the bed. He flung the blankets off and started shoving a naked Harry out of his bed. Harry felt a flush form on his cheeks as he was forced to stand naked in front of Pansy’s and Blaise’s ogling eyes. He was torn between wanting to cover himself up and covering Draco up who was on full display as he rushed around picking up scattered clothing. His arms were loaded by the time he made it over to Harry and shoved the clothes into his arms. The sparkle of the emerald stud through Draco's right nipple momentarily distracting him.
“Smile Big.” Blaise said, popping out of nowhere. Snap. The light felt like it blinded Draco.
Nott started laughing, “Some of our friends and associates have started making bets on the most outlandish things.”
“Item 19.” Draco said, although he thought it should be obvious.
He vanished the paper and walked to his department. He’d survived worse. He would just pretend it was the alcohol and nothing else.
“That was stupid of you. Why would you tell me? I’m not going to tell, but you couldn’t have known that. You two are reckless idiots.” Draco crossed his arms and threw himself back onto the couch, next to Harry and this time when Harry reached his arm around him he only stiffened but allowed it to stay. Harry couldn’t help the smile that formed on his face.
“Agreed.”
“I see you are not glamouring that anymore.” She said, giving the red ring a disdainful look.
Potter’s body stilled and he met Draco’s eyes. Draco instantly regretted poking at Potter’s temper because the intensity of his gaze sent a shiver through him and he didn’t know why he was picking a fight in the first place. Hadn’t he wanted to stay on good terms with Potter if possible? Perhaps it wasn’t possible. He had said Malfoy’s didn’t run, but he was wanting to run or reach for his wand, apparating would be much faster.
Harry really didn’t want to talk about Malfoy anymore and asked about Hermione’s new favorite subject. The wedding.
“Well, he will probably say yes, so you will just have to deal with it.”
date Malfoy. Would serve you right for suggesting it. I would bring him along when we hangout, and to dinners at the Burrow. We could all go out on double dates.” Harry gave Ron a wide grin, all teeth, raising his brows as if this were an evil plan, worthy of the twins.
“When would I have had the time?” Harry asked, a smirk forming on his face at the thought of what had been taking up all his time.
“I do have an extra ticket, if you want to invite Malfoy.” Harry shot his head back up, in surprise and Ron busted out laughing. This time only joking.
“Well that was certainly interesting.” Draco heard Blaise say to Pansy through the closed door. Draco flung the door back open and gave his two friends a suspicious look.
Draco rolled his eyes, he was so childish sometimes. “Then maybe…”
“Fine.” Harry sighed, turning to go change, again. “Hurry. I don’t want to be late.” Harry shot him an angry look.
“Call me Hermione.”
14. Take Pansy to that Swedish spa
Draco didn’t move to get up, the silence that followed lasted longer than what Harry thought comfortable.
Harry looked to George for help, but he looked back down at his forms, clearly unwilling to get pulled into it.
Hermione looked even more unsure before continuing.  “The elder wand.” She said her voice low.
“Of course I like you.”
Draco traced the rim of his cup with his finger, he still didn’t look convinced.  “I don’t like being trapped.”  He repeated.
Harry shrugged, he shouldn’t of said anything, because he knew he would be completely unable to describe it.
“I can’t do any better.”  Harry whispered, his voice unsteady and breathy.  “When you are the best.”  Harry was thankful that his face was hidden against Draco’s neck still, so that he wouldn’t have to make eye contact after admitting something so cheesy.  Draco didn’t allow Harry to stay hidden, he forced Harry to face him, his hands on both sides of Harry’s face.  Harry looked up, shyly, but he was saved from being embarrassed for long, because Draco’s mouth was back on his and they were back to kissing each other with even more energy, which Harry didn’t know was possible.
“Whatever color Pansy tells me to.”
“Zabini goes to muggle casinos?”  Harry asked.
Potter gave Draco a questioning look, “To have someone with such a nice cock, only to keep it tied up in her purse strings.” This rewarded Draco with a half cough, half laugh. Draco would take it.  He leaned in closer to Potter and whispered, “I would know too. I once walked in on him at Pansy’s. Very nice.” Draco leaned out, “Of course it would have been a much better experience if I hadn’t also walked in on Pansy in a position, I would care never to see or remember again.”
“Sure. Night guys.”
“A one night stand!” Ron blurted out. “That Arsehole.”
Ssshhh. Harry tried to shush Ron. The last thing he needed was another article in the paper with the head line: The Chosen One’s, One Night.
“Friends say that they have known about Harry’s preferences for years, but until recently he has kept it hidden from the public. Apparently the Chosen One is no longer hiding, this dark secret, as he has been seen out with multiple men the past few weeks, including Quidditch star Ezra Reed. They were seen at multiple places last night together, their demeanor, more than just friendly. Both have refused to give a statement confirming or denying their relationship, as of yet. See page 7 for an interview with, classmate, Zacharias Smith, who tells all about Harry Potter’s relationships in school and how Potter stalked him in sixth year at Hogwarts.”
Harry forced his eyes up from his food and shrugged. “The other team captain is going too.” It wasn’t a big deal. It was an annoyance, but not the riot Ron was making it out to be.
The dinner was a success and now people were left to drink too much and mingle. This was usually Draco’s favorite part, but he just couldn’t muster up his usual enjoyment that came with social scheming. He was on his third glass of wine and was feeling content to stand back and watch from the warm wine haze he was in. As usual though his plan was ruined by no other than Potter, he was also a few glasses in Draco had noted. It also hadn’t passed his attention that Potter kept watching him, which wasn’t an uncommon habit of his. Draco felt like he was back at school, with Potter’s suspicious eyes following him around the room and himself trying to pretend like he didn’t notice Potter at all. It had seemed to be working like it had in the past, that was until Potter broke with habit and approached him. Draco had of course taken the rational path and had fled to the men’s room before Potter had gotten a chance to release his wrath upon him. If his eyes were any indication, and Draco felt like they were, than he was in for a not so pleasant conversation about the other night. Not that he didn’t expect it. Potter wouldn’t be able let it go and so conversation would be unavoidable and most likely yelling and the discussion of feelings. Something Draco liked even less than apologizing. It maybe unavoidable but it could be delayed.
“Oh.” Ron said, and maybe seeing something in Harry’s eyes or hearing something in his tone. He for once didn’t drag the paper, he knew Ron was carrying on his person, out to force Harry to read about himself on the front page. “Nothing interesting.” Ron said, which Harry knew was a lie, but appreciated it nonetheless.
Draco never received a direct response to his letter to Harry, but he had gotten an owl the following day with notes about his previous Quidditch practice and a few more plays that he was expected to familiarize himself with before the next practice in three days. The notes were direct and unbiased, which he supposed was the best he could expect. Harry wasn’t going to withdraw from the charity and although short, the notes were professional and lacked any kind of malice. Draco read over the plays once more, before sighing and tossing them onto his desk. His attention going to the list that was sitting on the edge of his desk. He hadn’t been able to bring himself to crossing item 19 off of it. The entire list suddenly made him furious.
“Ok, I’ll uh call or we could go to dinner.” Harry suggested hopefully. Draco’s eyes went wide and his jaw twitched.
Harry groaned and snapped. “They need to learn what fact means. We are not dating.”
“That’s how I defeated Voldemort.” Harry admitted. “He tried to kill me with my wand and it backfired and killed him.”
“So he didn’t want to fall into bed with you?”
“No need to push.”  She muttered, throwing a grape at the back of his head.
When Harry awoke, it was still dark out, but he felt too alert to be able to fall back asleep.  His alarm showed it was 2:30 in the morning, he rubbed his face with a groan and decided to get a glass of water and use the loo.
“I guess I shouldn’t be surprised, you have always seemed to have a thing for blondes and you were always obsessed with him at school.” She continued, her eyes watching Draco over Harry’s shoulder.  “He better treat you good, or else.” She said, her eyes, sharpening into a threatening glare.
“Are you still dwelling on that article, mate?”
Draco sat on Potter’s lumpy couch and looked around his flat. It was surprisingly...atrocious. It wasn’t that Draco had envisioned it with high hopes based off the lack of style Potter showed in his wardrobe, but this really went above and beyond. It was like he was trying to make it look horrible on purpose. Not a single piece of furniture matched. The coffee table looked like pale pine, the woodwork was a medium darkness and the end table was almost black the wood was so dark. The room had two couches one had creme and green stripes and the other had large red flowers. The scheme was all brought together with mustard colored walls and a ratty blue blanket. He passed the time by looking at a moving picture hanging on the wall that sported the golden trio smiling with their arms draped over each other.
“What if they put up anti apparation wards?  They’ve done it before, when...with The Dark...with Voldemort.”  Draco said, sounding determined to call him by his name.  Harry knew it was something he was trying to work on.
“We will celebrate! Tonight.” Draco said, so that Pansy wouldn’t have to and could continue to pretend indifference, like she preferred.  “This is amazing Pansy.” Draco said, walking into the next room of the tomb. The tomb had numerous chambers for each Pharaoh. This room had a small hole in the ceiling that splashed light onto a dark crystal in the center of the room. The crystal glittered, dark purple and black. The plaque speculated that the crystal was believed to focus the energy of the moon, to help the soul of the the dead take a solid form and walk on our plain once again.
“I would bet the same couple to break up and get pregnant.”  Harry said.
Harry shrugged. “We can go by after this and you can see for yourself.”
“But my parents wouldn’t.” Draco said.
“Good.” Potter said, finally looking up at Draco and fidgeting with the sleeve of his shirt. How could he stand to be wearing long sleeves? “That’s good.” Potter repeated.
Draco scrunched up his face in disgust.  “I don’t want to picture how Weasley babies are made.”
“If you recall there was this one person who tried to tell you so, but that you refused to listen to.” Pansy’s voice helped draw Draco’s thoughts away from Potter and back to the situation at hand. He let out a high pitched yelp that he was glad Harry wasn’t around to hear and shot into the bathroom.
“Everything is in order.  I suppose relaxing a second before everyone arrives would be nice.”  Draco lounged next to Harry on the settee, making it look comfortable.  Harry meant to just hand him the drink, but ended up kissing him and almost spilling the drink on him.  The sound of the floo didn’t allow the kissing to go on for long.
“Nope, some guy named Finn Pinkerton”
“Only this has to be ten times worse, with all of Quidditch cancelled until who knows when.”  Draco said, his brow furrowed into what looked like genuine worry.
“It’s from Malfoy.” Harry said.
Harry changed the word hobby to addiction in his head, but said nothing else.
The List:
Saying Harry didn’t sleep well, was an understatement. Harry tossed and turned all night, his mind taking turns: evaluating what happened with Malfoy, arguing with itself that he didn’t care, and running what Ron said about the life threatening Rubert’s Disease, which then led to wondering about why Malfoy would have a bucket list anyways. Oh and the occasional and very, very unhelpful replay of the night he had spent with Draco.
