The spirit drifted higher up the wall, but it did not leave. It examined him from above like some hideous chandelier.
The scratching of Hermione's quill stopped. She glared at him. "
“Er—shouldn’t you be telling me?”
Harry walked over and snatched up the parchment. It looked like a page torn from an old book. The language was archaic, and the contents weren't anything like they’d read in class. But there was one passage that stood out to him, and not just because Malfoy had outlined it in red ink:
At once, Harry was hyper-aware of every sensation in his body, from the cold-born goosebumps sprouting on his arms to the pain nibbling his cheekbone.
He continued up the staircase, irritated about something, though not quite sure what that something was.
A jet of water extinguished the small flame. The books lay soaked in a puddle on the floor.
When Harry lifted his head from the page, he saw Hermione and Ron staring at him.
For a long moment, Hermione squinted at Harry. Ron contemplated him, too; then he handed the note to Harry and returned to gazing listlessly at his Potions essay.
"Open," he commanded.
Bewildered, Harry stared. Then he scoffed, “Your funeral.”
"I trust you," she said simply.
“…Potter?” she said weakly. “Harry Potter?”
At that, the air turned slightly awkward.
Harry changed the subject. “What do you want me to say?”
The only soft part of Malfoy was his hair. Harry reached up and slid his fingers through the silken strands, reveling at the touch. His other hand grasped Malfoy’s collar.
Hot shame flushed Harry's face—humiliation that Malfoy could play him so easily, embarrassment at his own reaction.
Malfoy coughed, hiding his grin. His teeth flashed white.
“The poem…isn’t necessarily about God and a Man,” said Malfoy at last. “At least to me,” he amended. “It’s also about condemnation. And responsibility.”
Harry squinted at his book through the fumes. Malfoy was right. Harry stirred clockwise, counted thrice, and then stirred counterclockwise. The potion frothed and lightened a shade.
He charged up the dormitory stairs and threw open his trunk. Inside was a mess of clothes, schoolbooks, Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes products, and what seemed like every knick-knack Harry had owned since first year.
me you were studying.”
A moment passed. Malfoy cleared his throat. Harry looked up.
And suddenly Harry was tumbling forward, forward, forward…then, as if with a marionette string, a force pulled him upright, and he was drifting…
“Yes, well,” muttered Malfoy, coloring slightly.
The snitch’s wings beat uselessly against his clenched palm. Below him, he heard a loud curse. He looked down at Malfoy, indignant and severely windblown.
With another alarmingly wide grin, Potter left Draco’s office, his red robes catching slightly on the stacks of papers that littered the floor. Draco stared after him wondering if this was what Dorothy felt like post-tornado. He glanced down at the cinnamon swirl, which really did look very enticing before allowing himself a small, albeit confused, smile.
“Soup or tea?” Harry questioned, vaguely distracted by the gulp of Malfoy’s slender white throat as he tipped the flask back.
“You okay?” Harry asked, stroking his fingers down the side of Draco’s face. “This isn’t too fast?”
“I am,” Harry replied, “so long as we’re both in this room, Pewterfoot and the French will be none the wiser and I promise I’ll keep my eyes open in there.”
“I was
“Marlene,” Harry nodded.
Draco shifted and looked round the table as he realised that he might have potentially just sounded a little rude. Thankfully, only Potter and Hermione seemed to be listening in on the exchange.
Harry smiled and nestled back in the armchair, he had developed somewhat of a crick in his neck from the long hours bent over the department’s pensieve.
with a friend.”
Harry’s mind flashed back to the image he’d had of Malfoy pruning roses in his garden wearing a large sun hat, only this time the other man was brandishing at incredibly phallic looking hose, turning the spray pressure up increasing his grip on the testi –
“Not only are the Deutsches Zaubereiministerium saying the reports were incorrectly filled out but they’re also now claiming they were two days late!” Picklemarsh roared, flecks of spittle spraying his desk where he had at least three different motivational calendars.
“Is the food too spicy?” Harry asked. “Only you’re looking a little flushed.”
“And all this time you’ve just been ordering take out,” Draco muttered, moving over to the east wall and frowning. There were no cupboards on this wall, just unadorned bricks that occasionally flickered like one of Draco’s Pop Up Pals.
“I already have swimming trunks,” Draco huffed, “they’re under my shorts.”
Draco groaned, “Merlin nothing’s changed in thirteen years has it? At seventeen it was me crying in a bathroom talking to a ghost because a madman expected me to fix a cabinet and at thirty-one it was me crying in a bathroom talking to a charm because my hair serum isn’t working.”
Draco seemed to tense, straightening up in the doorway.
Harry eyed the assortment of takeout menus critically. Kreacher was never up for cooking anything other than a rather watery spag bol and Harry always felt too exhausted by the end of the working day to attempt to wrangle his semi sentient kitchen. He knew that wizarding houses had personalities of their own, but really, the kitchen was extraordinarily stubborn.
"Not much, but the copper will oxidize and lighten the shade of the potion, which will make it easier for you to make value judgments."
Malfoy contemplated the ceiling. "Potions, Quidditch, reading. Not much else."
, he realized.
"What?"
"Well, it's a big article for them," said Hermione primly. She appeared to be stifling a laugh.
“You’re on, Potter,” said Malfoy softly. “I’ll meet you on the hill overlooking the Black Lake at midnight—don’t need Filch spotting us on the pitch. And bring the Firebolt.”
Its eyeless face contorted with excruciating sorrow.
From across the table, Malfoy leaned forward. Harry froze mid-scratch.
"Immobulus wasn't designed for humans, even if it's used that way," said Malfoy, watching Harry closely. "Someone skilled in Occlumency could throw it off.”
“...Pat Rumple and John Steely,” Ginny was saying.
“Good,” said Harry, so firmly that Malfoy glanced up.
one, out of all the other fucked-up ones...”
Harry removed his hand from his throat and turned his head to the side. Ginny breathed, “Shit,” and Harry flushed. Then Ginny said something under her breath, and ice-cold gust of wind wiped the marks clean.
Finally, Harry entered the Observation Deck. He realized what had gotten Crookshanks so riled up.
A soft
Malfoy’s ragged breathing was just inches behind him. Pressing flat against the broom, Harry turned sharply upwards—he was zooming perfectly vertically
“Bollocks,” Harry retorted, “reality is what we make it. She helped you and that makes her real.”
Harry nodded dumbly as Luna got up and floated off towards the till.
and the lumbering oaf didn’t catch on either time,” Malfoy splashed the water, sending foaming droplets across the tiles.
“Well,” Hermione sucked thoughtfully on her lip, “he was always really rather good at potions and I suppose he is no longer in possession of a house elf after the Malfoys had the majority of their assets seized.”
“Do you have any lube?” Harry asked, pressing a kiss to Draco’s sweating forehead.
“Yeah you are,” Harry frowned. “Bill is too, Bill tell him about that thimble you found last week.”
Both Harry and Lisette raised their eyebrows at this declaration. Malfoy huffed as he turned over the scrubbing brush to the coarser side, its previous white colour now a muddied layer of grime. “I mean think about it, fresh potion ingredients are absolutely exorbitant and that’s if I can even get the buggers to sell to me. Plus, the mail order ones where I can use a different name always arrive wilted and bruised.”
Harry laughed, “I’ll bear that in mind. But for now, I was wondering if I could come in?”
“Looks that way,” Harry narrowed his eyes at the other auror before turning back to Malfoy.
“Right,” Harry agreed, frowning as they followed Malfoy into a cramped kitchen. The other man had changed out of his work clothes and was now wearing a pale cashmere sweater and black trousers, it was almost casual and only enhanced Harry’s sense that they were intruding somewhere they shouldn’t be.
Draco was still smiling as Harry suggested, seeing as they had finished their ice creams, perhaps they could take a walk. Harry had been half expecting Draco to reject him and point out that he had only agreed to come to Fortescue’s, but to his immense relief, Draco simply nodded and followed Harry out of the store and into the bright sunshine.
“Wait,” Potter said quickly, taking a step after him and causing Draco to pause curiously. “I, um, your hair looks nice today.”
Malfoy groaned, before stamping angrily over to the park, flinging himself down on a wrought iron bench that was partially hidden by a horse chestnut tree.
“Why?” Harry frowned.
“I’ll tell Kreacher to use his favourite toilet plunger to get it nice and ready for you,” Harry beamed, ignoring Draco’s squeak of disgust.
“What garden?” Ron looked confused.
“And you live there alone?” Draco enquired, waving a meandering wasp away from them as they walked through the park gates.
Along with something else…but Harry put that thought in a box and locked it away.
"Take your seats. We will be dissecting your duels, and I shall soon review your performance in
, Ron, I'm working on Arithmancy," snapped Hermione.
Hermione scowled and returned to her homework.
Then, to Harry's great amazement, she leaned down and
Her face was naked and sunken, robbed of its former beauty. When she smiled, it looked grotesque—as if the edges of her mouth had been tugged up by an invisible puppeteer.
“Ginny? Shit, what an
if you're going to be rude,” tsked the Fat Lady.
“What’s a Dudley?”
Malfoy turned his head. Harry’s lips grazed his cheekbone.
Acromantula feelers. Someone should lock you up, Potter.”
“I wasn’t—" said Harry hastily.
Frowning slightly, he said, “I just kept thinking...they’re not my family. They’re just people I happened to live with. I didn’t belong there. One day I’d get out and never look back. So, that’s what I did.”
They flew for nearly a half-hour without incidence, the snitch well hidden. One moment Harry thought he saw it—but it was only Malfoy’s sleek blond head far below.
, you old bat,” snapped Filch. He swooped up Mrs. Norris and, at last, left the classroom. The door
The gargoyle on the right drooled stupidly.
"Why're you asking anyway? Some Slytherin fifth year have a crush on you?"

But despite reason, despite the evidence, Harry couldn’t help feeling that Roman was capable of murder and more.
," he informed Harry.
"Parvati’s been very upset, you know, about Lavender…" said Luna, burying her fingers in the soil. "Lavender liked to make fun of me, but she stopped when Ginny told her not to.
a favour, Malfoy. I can leave right now if you’d like.”
“Oh, and Harry,” she leaned forward conspiratorially, “weren’t you ‘starving?’”
"Seeing as I have no intention of speaking to him again, you are," Harry said. "Feel free to drop a little gift into his tea at breakfast, if you feel like it."
Harry didn’t have a response for that. He was glad Malfoy couldn’t see him that moment, as he was looking very awkward indeed.
” said Harry through clenched teeth. “I don’t need your help
Harry raised a sceptical brow. "You read muggle stuff?" he said doubtfully. "
A long silence passed. The night’s stillness magnified the slight fall of their breaths; it seemed to fill them.
he’d stowed away at breakfast. Malfoy snatched it away.
and he and Malfoy were engulfed in a bubble-gum pink concoction that immediately smarted and sizzled. At once, Professor Boughbranch doused them off in an icy jet of water. They were left shivering, soaked, and thoroughly embarrassed.
It had been seen by the
“What’s to say?” she asked, incredulous. “
“Malfoy,” warned Harry.
As if it were all normal, Malfoy sauntered towards Harry.
The week before, while Harry was bent low over his Charms essay, Malfoy had leaned over and
Harry, who received daily bundles of fan mail and press inquiries, said truthfully, "I must have thrown it away."
And with a flick of his wand, the sachet transformed into a glass pipe. Malfoy lit a small flame underneath it. Then he closed his mouth around the pipe, inhaled, and breathed out. Smoke curled from his lips, the same color as the flames on the walls. Or maybe the smoke had no color at all, and it was only the torchlight painting the whole classroom faintly golden.
Panic flared on Malfoy’s face. Undoubtedly, he’d be in more trouble than Harry if he were caught lurking around after hours.
And...we've made a full circle.
“Shut up,” Malfoy said quietly.
Hermione straightened and shot Harry a glance, but she left with Ron. Soon, the noise of the classroom dwindled.
Harry looked up.
After classes that evening, memo in hand, Harry headed for the Headmistress's office.
“I don’t like you, Malfoy,” said Harry, attempting to steady himself. “In fact, I think you’re awful.”
—it never goes away. Not really.”
Malfoy lay there, eyebrows raised. Then they lowered. His jaw set. Harry wondered if he'd gone too far. But then Malfoy spoke:
From the depths of his trunk shot out a grubby velvet pouch. Grimacing, Harry shook off a chocolate frog wrapper. Inside the pouch were two wands: one of blackthorn, which the Ministry had recovered from Malfoy Manor, and one of hawthorn. Malfoy's wand.
He looked pensive. But he didn’t say a thing.
"Shouldn't be too difficult," said Malfoy confidently. He took out his quill.
"Okay—wait, Harry," she reached out a steadying hand on his chest. "Are you alright?"
Ron perked up from across the table.
“Er, what?”
“Family isn’t something you choose, Potter,” he said. “It’s
It had been instinctive: dueling was mentioned, and Harry thought of Malfoy. It was only natural, after all—the two of them had spent the last several weeks dueling in that dungeon classroom.
In fact, Harry was so preoccupied, he’d completely forgotten about his meeting with Professor McGonagall until Hermione brought it up during lunch.
"Er—right."
“I’m back,” she announced unnecessarily. “And guess who else is—Malfoy. I saw him leaving Professor Flitwick’s office.”
"Remedial Potions," he repeated, louder. "But," he continued, ignoring Ron and Hermione's twin expressions of pity, "it hasn't started yet, anyway."
“All I’m saying,” Ron interrupted, “is that we don’t know anything for sure about that family. And that besides the Ministry, the only people who saw Lucius Malfoy’s dead body—are Narcissa and Draco Malfoy.”
Harry heard the squeaking of Pomfrey’s chair, then the sound of her office door opening.
Harry arrived on the first floor—and paused.
"Yep," said Harry happily.
"Okay,
It wasn't a cat, Harry realized. It was a kneazle.
"—no, I've
Ernie sighed long-sufferingly and exchanged a look with Hermione, who, battling the flower's spiny tendrils, shrugged. Next to her, Ron looked pensive.

“Oh—” stuttered Harry, “you didn’t hear?”
"Okay," said Harry as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.
"Right,
"Just watching you fly," he said. "Walk with me?"
At that, at least, he expected Malfoy to whip out his wand and tell him to shut his fucking mouth.
In the dungeons, Classroom No. 10 had shifted slightly. It was now four doors down, so Harry turned three wrong doorknobs before finding the right one. Finally, he entered the classroom, locked it, and cast a Silencing charm.
Luna made a soft, surprised sound. Harry felt a weight settle next to him. Then, small fingers, cool on his burning skin, drew his hands from his face.
to understand.
At half-past one, nestled in wool carpet, Harry stared dully at his half-finished essay. He was comfortable and warm, and whatever he and Malfoy had smoked earlier, combined with the bath, did nothing to stop his eyelids from drooping once again. He was drifting...
Ruefully, Malfoy smiled. “After all, if you hadn’t sliced me open that day, you’d have been Crucio’d.”
The left gargoyle surveyed Harry hungrily. “You got a password?”
"No," said Ron indifferently.
“They’re saying Hawkes was in on it too,” added Seamus wisely.
It was as though Harry was transported to last night—icy air, cold metal, and Malfoy’s warm breath.
"Didn't know you had a cat, Malfoy," remarked Harry as Malfoy rooted through his bag.
Hermione trailed behind, distinctly disapproving. “
Malfoy swung his bag over his shoulder. Hands in his pockets, Malfoy bent over Harry's desk. "Want to come with?" he whispered conspiratorially.
"Where do you get off, Potter?" Malfoy snarled, jaw set. A tick pulsed in his cheek.
it, and you're afraid that if people find out, I'll stop."
"I might've," said Malfoy with an air of indifference.
It did something to Harry—set his nerves on end, launched a current across his skin.
Something thrummed in Harry’s stomach. He gripped his quill. “Malfoy. Let me ask you something.”
Malfoy lay bent over, clutching his ribcage. His breath came out in short gasps. Warm wisps floated to the dungeon ceiling.
At his desk, he grabbed a self-inking quill and penned a brief letter:
Malfoy hardly talked about himself, much less his parents. Harry held his breath and stayed silent.
He shrugged.
Fire shot from its end yet again.
of all places.”
"...I suppose I'll try that," Malfoy was saying to her. She tottered into the storeroom behind the counter, presumably to fetch whatever he wanted. Harry eyed the door.
bird is the question…a kinky one, no doubt.”
…" he trailed off.
“And you know everything about me?”
Thoughtfully, Ron remarked, "It's just as you said, isn't it, Hermione? That day at the lake. You said it could have been Aurors that killed Lucius Malfoy.”
“She’s actually got something to write about now,” said Hermione. “She’s having the time of her life.”
—if a photograph of them, hot and shrouded in the dungeons, wound up on the Daily Prophet. His mind conjured countless scenarios, each more appalling than the one before. But when he felt that rough hand glide across his jaw or slide under his robes, Harry’s body stopped caring.
It didn't matter that the dungeon was cold and dark; at times, the lights blinded Harry momentarily, and sweat trickled down his back.
“Better there than here,” said Ron, but he looked distinctly uncomfortable.
She swung open, and Harry climbed into the common room. Hermione and Ron were nowhere to be found. Harry supposed they were shacked up together in some remote corner of the castle.
Harry stood, knocking over his chair.
"Hm?" said Harry, preoccupied. He counted three freckles dotting Malfoy’s bare skin.
“Questions?” said Harry. “Er, I have one: you’re not going to give me a test, are you?”
Coolly, Malfoy surveyed Harry.
A pause, then giggles, then the sound of footsteps receding down the corridor. Harry heard the boy say, “…two schoolbags and only one Potter, did you notice? There must have been someone with him…”
to death.”
After a moment, Malfoy resumed stirring. “Perhaps,” he said with feigned lightness.
Harry’s meeting with Professor McGonagall had drawn close to dinner. Though he’d hardly eaten that day, Harry had no appetite. Instead, he went to the library, where Madam Pince was in a foul mood. Mid-Year deadlines were fast approaching, and Madam Pince was inundated with requests for books from the Restricted Section. Upperclassmen crowded the library, waiting for Pince to approve their permission slips and retrieve their books.
Harry hated it.
When he opened them again, he was back in the dungeons. The floor was hard and cold. His head ached.
makes sense,” he said. “Whatever. From now on, no Dark Magic.”
When they arrived, Ron knocked loudly. “Oi, Hagrid!” His breath left moist clouds in the icy air. “You’d better be home—it’s bloody
shut.
MIDNIGHT MURDER OF MALFOY MASTERMIND?
Harry's mouth closed.
“See?” Harry turned back to Malfoy who was still looking a little stunned. “Great things happen when you don’t hide behind your briefcase all the time.”
“Oh,” Nick replied, “No, I knew that, I just wondered if you guys were friends is all.”
“When do we go in?” Harry asked, he could already feel a headache coming on behind his left eye.
,” Harry bit out, immediately falling to all fours and desperately feeling around for it. He sat up as another heavy gasp of breath echoed through the otherwise silence.
“Thank god for that spell,” Ron chuckled, “do you remember the last probe we had to do? The suspect got food poisoning on the third night. I’ve never cast so quickly in my life.”
“Yes, well trust you to defend him,” Andromeda snorted as she dipped a gingernut biscuit into her steaming tea. “We all know the sorts of hijinks you lot got up to at school.”
The absence of natural sunlight in the basement was already making Harry’s skin feel sallow and shrunken. He wondered if it felt more like home to Malfoy? Having spent most of his school life in the Slytherin common rooms below the lake.
Malfoy seemed to have noticed the attention too, rigidity spreading through his shoulders as he kept his eyes firmly ahead, bracing himself for some sort of pointed remark. As if on cue, Malfoy’s free hand gravitated towards his left sleeve.
Harry always made a point to eat as much as possible before coming into Malfoy’s memories, considering how many mouth watering dishes the other man seemed to cook up on a regular basis. He tried to remember what
“Ah!” Malfoy’s tongue darted out to lick his lips as the movement of the hand on his cock sped up.
Harry’s hand curved over his hip before caressing his arse again. Draco looked down at the boxers Harry was wearing, they were tented and straining with a damp patch.
Draco fingered the business card that the legal affairs worker from the lift had given him, her name had been Odette, her blue hair reminding Draco of the merpeople that used to swim past the windows in the Slytherin common room. Perhaps he could bribe her with home cooking in order to help him sue the Ministry for emotional damage? Plus, he wouldn’t put it past Pewterfoot to leave the investigation on Draco’s permanent record, despite acquittal. Even if Draco’s hopes of career advancement had been slim before they were practically zero now.
“Draco this recipe serves four,” Magalie stood hunched over the age stained recipe book with a furrowed brow.
“Damn it,” Draco sighed, “you know my weak points.”
Harry had already noticed thankfully that Penny’s partner, Ed Winshaw, wasn’t present at the barbeque. He wondered if Ron had neglected to invite the other man after seeing him being such an arsehole to Malfoy in his memories? Probably not though, Harry couldn’t imagine Ron being that indignant on Malfoy’s behalf, perhaps Ed had already buggered off on his Italian holiday with Marlene.
“Thistlebarrow, the one who wrote about thestral bones, also proposed that the silver of occamy eggs could be used to enhance curses,” Malfoy informed them, pretty sure he had read that in a very obscure journal.
Draco looked up with a frown, “How do you know,” his face shuttered, “oh right, my memories, of course.”
been wearing cologne?
at potions!” Malfoy shrieked to the room at large.
“What, really?” Harry blinked up in surprise at his friend.
The item in question was one of the Pop Up Pals marbles, it was orange in colour. Harry leaned forwards to pick it up, rolling it around the surface of his palm. “Do you think maybe we could activate it?”
“Mate,”
Harry yawned widely, he was working overtime today to try and get through the last few vials of Malfoy’s memories. He knew the sooner he got it done the sooner he could file for the other man’s release.
you spend your school days?” Draco drawled before immediately regretting the question. He was already anticipating the entire table turning hostile as Potter bitingly reminded Draco that he had spent most of school battling for his life against one of the darkest wizards of all time.
Harry snorted, half wishing he could clap Malfoy on the back for support.
?” Draco squeaked.
. Not that I’m complaining mind you – it’s probably better for the world at large if Potter renders himself infertile and we don’t have to deal with any mini scarheads causing havoc all over the place.”
“What are you doing for your birthday?” Andromeda asked, her voice turning cheery and slightly teasing. Harry laughed despite himself, everyone knew he had little choice in the matter of celebrations. The Weasleys would undoubtedly hold some sort of large garden party, last year they had strung up snitch shaped fairy lights across the trees and, thanks to an extension charm, created a quarter sized quidditch pitch decked out in Gryffindor colours.
Harry clenched his jaw as Ron shot him a warning look, Pewterfoot could come in at any moment now and seeing as the French had mostly taken over the Dark Ring case in order to track down the Bianchi family, Ron and Harry, along with most of the department had been trying to angle for lead on the Datchet decapitations.
“He is rather handsome though,”
“Sensible woman your wife,” Harry grinned as Ron rolled his eyes. “Look, how about you take a break and I’ll go back in on my own.”
His mother would have surely shuddered at the vulgarity of the latter convenience.
range from Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes’ that had been another birthday present.
“Plus, there’s a rumour they’re going to make Patricia’s baby not even his,” Draco continued as he added chopped onion to the pot. In the excitement he had forgotten to cast a no tears spell and was now looking suitably devastated at Francis Featherhorn’s potential onscreen exit.
Draco arrived home at around eleven pm, he couldn’t believe he had just spent five hours voluntarily conversing to a Weasley. Without a fireplace he couldn’t firecall Odette or Matthew, so instead he hurriedly sifted through his marbles, opening a yellow one.
Draco sighed. “I know, it’s just he was always just this,” he flicked his eyes at Odette, “unattainable fantasy. It’s stupid but when we finally met again I wanted…I wanted it to be perfect. I would have worked my way up to a decent position and I’d be all shiny and impressive with perfect hair and…” Draco trailed off miserably, knowing how pathetic he sounded.
“That’s too many beans,” Draco frowned critically at his ingredient prep, it wasn’t going to be a proper cassoulet, just a quick approximation of the stew that he could make in a few hours. However, he had been so immersed in conversation with Magalie that he hadn’t even noticed himself accidentally opening the second can of beans.
“Draco, mon petit chou fleur, when was the last time you went on a date?” Magalie enquired. Harry found himself sitting forward on his seat, the onscreen drama all but forgotten. “How long ago was your last boyfriend?” Magalie continued.
“I wasn’t sure if you were coming,” Harry rubbed the back of his neck as he gestured for the two of them to walk towards the nearest elevator.
to being in Malfoy’s memories, watching the other man work or prep his lunch, listening to him crack jokes with Magalie or snort at the latest quidditch results, often at the expense of the Canons, which Harry secretly agreed with. It was just, familiar now perhaps, almost as if they were friends inhabiting the same space. Which was probably a stupid thing to think and perhaps Harry
“Oh wow,” Harry groaned, smacking his hand against his face, “I think I must have sunstroke or something.”
“You’d have to be lonely to order charmed imaginary friends,” Ron’s eyes widened, “I mean, it’s a bit creepy isn’t it?”
“You do look nice,” Potter whispered, leaning across to Draco and pushing him the bowl of crisps.
on holiday,” Draco snarled, gnashing his teeth together.
“Ah,” Luna nodded as if that explained everything. “Ron mentioned you were doing a Pensieve Probe at the moment. Is it Draco’s memories you’re exploring?”
,” Malfoy bit back.
“No, you can’t!” Harry protested with a pout.
Harry recognised a large cream coloured envelope as having Narcissa’s handwriting on the front. He settled down in the nearby armchair and watched lazily as Malfoy opened the letter, which turned out to be a card. There was a print of an oil painting on the front depicting a fancy looking soldier on a white horse. The soldier was wearing a huge bear skin hat and brandishing a curved sword, Harry supposed he was some sort of historical cavalry officer.
“Yes I know,” Draco panted, searching frantically for his wand before giving up and summoning his hair tonic wandlessly. “But I need someone to talk some sense into me.”
where Captain Peridot and the crew of the Nemean get stranded on the planet after Dr. Sangork sabotages their –“
Draco appeared to find this line of conversation too ridiculous to even qualify with an answer, instead he ushered Harry into the flat.
“Your godson is right,” Draco replied, turning round to fluff his pillow and pull the sheets back, “You are horribly ‘cringe’.”
“Yeah,” Harry chewed on the inside of his cheek, “I think he’ll be quite upset if he finds out it was me in there though”
“They’re quite short,” Draco said quietly, refusing to look at Harry or acknowledge the blush that was probably clouding his milk white chest. “I can assure you they were considered the fashion on the continent but I know in England now people tend to wear such items down to their knees like they’re going skateboarding or something.”
Draco snapped his eyes up to see if Potter was mocking him, however the other man was still smiling in a disturbingly fond sort of way. Maybe Potter was going through a mid life crisis and wanted to try and recreate their school days? Perhaps he was currently rounding up all the old Slytherins he could find? In that case, Draco wouldn’t disappoint.
“You’re amazing!” Harry cried happily, reaching out to drag Draco into a brief but tight hug. Draco gasped as Harry drew away, hurrying off to inspect a patch of venomous tentacula that was sprouting from a stone planter.
in Malfoy’s memories. In fact, spending the evening, albeit afternoon in the real world, with Malfoy in his little kitchen, belting out Charles Trenet’s ‘La Mer’ whilst Malfoy used a wooden spoon as a makeshift microphone had become somewhat comforting.
Malfoy clutched the marble tightly before quickly drawing out his wand and sending a flurry of tidying charms at his ransacked apartment. Once he was satisfied everything was back to order, Malfoy hurried into the kitchen where on the table was the cupcake he had bought earlier, only now there was a single candle stuck into its purple frosting.
“I,” Draco beamed, “I’m going to be a curse breaker. In fact, I think I’m already on a case.”
“Hah!” Harry laughed, looking out through the window. “George must have brought a box of his tongue lengthening lollies.”
“How do you know I’m innocent?” Draco muttered. “Maybe I tampered with the memories and am currently sitting on a thousand galleons worth of illegal potions.”
Harry cast another tempus charm, despite him not even having put his wand away from the last one. It was now 17:18. He should have suggested meeting Draco somewhere else, the atrium was far too crowded, especially as it was the end of the working day for most departments.
“Are you the one that reads all my reports?” Harry asked, raising his eyebrows. “If I’d known I would have tried to spice them up a little.”
“That sentence implies you’re not now,” Draco smirked with a quick flick of his eyes at Harry’s hair. Harry laughed, surely if Draco was up for teasing him then that was a good sign?
“It’s so wonderful to see the sun shining and such a full house here at the Hairy Gooseberry,” the witch was continuing talking when Ron leaned into the table with a sly grin.
“I suppose so.”
~**~**~
The meeting was predictably dull, a few reprimands regarding late reports and a couple of other issues were addressed. At the end Pewterfoot dismissed everyone with a reminder that there was a visitor from the U.S. Auror Division the following months and he wanted everything looking shipshape.
“It’s all adding up,” Ron tutted.
“Well that’s not exactly surprising,” Harry sighed, “you just said his mother lives there.”
“Yes,” Hermione huffed, “but that was before you went and snogged him in my spare bedroom…”
“P- Potter!” Malfoy cried, his entire body jerking and convulsing as he came all across the sheets.
Harry snorted, his shoulders shaking as he ducked behind Draco’s shoulder to avoid Ron’s wrathful glare. Draco grinned unabashed as he felt the heat from Harry’s body through his shirt.
“Magalie’s?” Harry cocked his head quizzically, “she always sings along with her in the kitche…” Harry trailed off as his face drained of colour. Draco felt as if someone had dumped a cauldron of ice water over his head. Pure, unadulterated horror was filtering through his veins and there was a panicked ringing in his ears.
“I,” Harry floundered, “I want ice cream.”
“Wasn’t Nachnebel’s work discredited?” Hermione asked, obviously also well read on the subject. Draco guessed she was also coming at it from the perspective of a Healer who used regenerative potions on a daily basis.
The garden had been completely trimmed back and although there was still some construction work going on down half of it, the other half had been completely landscaped. There was a beautiful kitchen garden with raised flower beds and an orchard area with apple and pear trees, even a haggard old cherry tree that they had discovered after cutting back the brambles. Everything was looking a little brown at the moment, however, with it being nearly December but come the spring, Neville had assured him it would be a riot of colour.
Since meeting the Pop Up Pals in Malfoy’s memories, Harry had done a little bit of research on the physics of the charms. Whilst each ‘friend’ was designed to best reflect what type of companionship was required of them they sometimes inevitably responded to the worries and concerns given off by the real wizard or witch’s aura. In such moments it was possible to reset the charm before they started embodying all your inner anxieties. Harry sat back on his chair, watching as Malfoy daintily licked the hummus from a carrot stick before crunching into it with relish
"You're in a good mood today," noted Harry as a gleeful Ron watched Tiny Leo pelt Tiny Xiao with Gobstones.
At last, he closed his hand around cold metal.
"He knows who killed his father," Ron finished for him.
"That doesn't change the fact that you did the same thing to me that Voldemort—" Harry ignored Malfoy's wince "—did to you," he said slowly.
, Harry shut the door. Malfoy looked up.
"There you are, Potter. Today we'll be redoing the Eye-Sharpening potion.”
“A lot of people did,” said Harry, chewing. “Malfoy isn’t special.”
. And so have you," she answered.
“You’d better not get us caught, Malfoy,” snarled Harry. Quickly, he ran to Malfoy and threw the cloak over them both. Then, suddenly remembering, he Vanished the orb of fire, and they were plunged into darkness.
Malfoy seemed to realize what he’d said before Harry did. He fell quiet abruptly.
"Er—sorry, Baron, sir."
Malfoy’s ears were ever-so-slightly pink. But when he spoke, it was without a trace of embarrassment.

The sick feeling came afterwards, when Harry had pulled away. The sickness settled low in his stomach, lurked on his shoulder, followed him wherever he went.
"I never said my parents didn't
“No? Pity," clipped Boughbranch. "You’ll both have to brew it again, won’t you? Here, at nine tonight.”
It wasn't until a half-hour later, settled into his covers with a heavily dog-eared copy of
With a soft
"Are you trying to ask for my help, Potter?"
Grey eyes narrowed, and everything went dark.
Malfoy drew a sharp breath. “So that’s it, Potter. Pity?
He turned to Ron. "See you and Hermione at noon in the Three Broomsticks?"
Malfoy was crouched, peering behind a suit of armour. He started when he saw Harry.
He shoved his wand into his pocket and strode around the corner. Filch scooped up Mrs. Norris and hobbled after him, wheezing and croaking threats.
Malfoy cast him a sidelong glance. “Well, I’m the one who brewed it, aren’t I? It’s not really nicking then.”
“I don’t,” said Harry, scowling.
"Haven' seen yeh all in a while," said Hagrid. He frowned down at them, wiping cold sweat from his brow.
Shivering, Harry stared at the unlikely pair as they poked holes in the soil. Their robes were caked with dirt.
He surveyed his surroundings. Ron was spooning baked beans onto his plate with gusto. Hermione and Ginny looked to be in deep discussion, likely at the current state of Harry's right eye.
Malfoy contemplated this. He frowned slightly, with clear skepticism. "More alone than being alone?"
"Yes, we all know it's Harry," said Ginny loudly, taking a seat. "Don't you girls have somewhere to be?"
, not a pork chop.”
“Shit—” said Harry. His arms felt useless, boneless. “Malfoy, are you—”
freckles."
That morning at breakfast, enchanted snow drifted from the Great Hall’s ceiling, dusting all its inhabitants with a faint iridescence. But at Harry’s corner of Gryffindor table, faces were anything but cheery.
insinuation," came a haughty voice from beside Harry.
Harry headed for the storeroom. Cod liver oil was nowhere in sight. The idea of asking Boughbranch (or worse, Malfoy) repelled him, so he just grabbed plain old fish oil and hoped for the best.
He couldn’t help but feel guilty, especially when Ron had ink all over his face.
Harry pinched his cheeks red, letting the pain warm him. He exchanged a look with Ron, who rolled his eyes and frowned at the chessboard between them.
"A bit of Calming Draught helps. About a quarter of a dose."

"The copper rod, not the wood," snapped Malfoy. He had apparently returned to normal.
The silence that followed felt too loud. Harry changed gears.
Harry looked at the note. Encased in an ebony envelope, it bore the silver words: '
The tip of Ron's nose darkened, but he couldn't help but look a tiny bit proud despite it.
At once, Harry severed the curse, and the desks crashed against the wall. Without thinking, he hurtled across the classroom.
Harry. There was a deafening
to the floor.
Hagrid chuckled beneath his shaggy beard.
He couldn’t see the man’s face; it was much too dark for that. But the cloaked figure paused, merely a metre from where Harry stood.
The minute Malfoy passed him the note, he’d expected something of the sort...and yet nothing could have prepared him for how he felt. The tightness in his stomach shot up and squeezed his lungs; his chest burned; he was hot and cold and tingly all at once.
“I thought you knew,” Harry said awkwardly as Malfoy stared at the page. “It’s really not a big deal, I mean, it’s just stupid gossip—”
“What are you up to, boy, down here in the dead of night?”
"Because it's quite interesting, really," Malfoy persisted, evidently enjoying himself. "The wizard who thousands of witches would give their left tit for—for some unfathomable reason—couldn't give a rat's arse about any of them."
At that, Malfoy sort of half-smiled, and his eyes crinkled at the edges in a way Harry had never seen before. Something lurched in his stomach.
Stupidly, Harry said, “Oh, I thought Pansy was.”
Professor McGonagall studied him with an unreadable expression.
, Harry, it makes no sense," she said. "Look here—"
It was a thoroughly unpleasant experience, attempting homework while battling thoughts about his meeting with McGonagall, ignoring the incessant

"Whenever, mate," Ron agreed, though he still seemed perturbed by Harry's news. Absentmindedly, he brushed one of Hermione's stray curls behind her ear.

But when they entered Defense Against the Dark Arts, the class sobered.
Harry didn’t think about it too much. One could argue that he didn’t think about it at all. He just needed to be rid of it, this overwhelming
Looking scandalized, the girl flounced away. Her friends bowed their heads and hissed angrily.
Silence filled the shadowy dungeon classroom. It became nearly unbearable.
The handwriting struck Harry as vaguely familiar.
Harry felt awkward, like he was intruding on some bare part of Draco Malfoy.
“You’re the one who insisted on talking,” Malfoy murmured.
He kissed Harry, deep and slow, until Harry felt himself dissolve. His hands clutched Malfoy’s face, his sharp jaw, his slightly scratchy skin. He felt Malfoy’s smirk form against his lips.
do you care so much about that case, Hermione?" he groaned.
He drew a deep, rattling breath. Then, swiftly, he skidded down the staircase to safety: the dungeons.

Why didn’t she tell me—"
until little Angie Winkle walked by, heard Neville, and burst into tears.
With a soft
, thought Harry. At once, Malfoy was surrounded by a dark, swirling fog.
Shaking his head in disbelief, he stirred his potion. It darkened at once.
“Malfoy’s my father,” he said quietly. “Call me Draco.”
And yet, despite everything, Harry reached his arm out. He shook Malfoy’s hand.
Hermione continued to stare at him. Breathily, she recited, “
Harry didn’t know what motive Roman would have—if he were a vampire or a Dark wizard, why would he want a Death Eater like Lucius Malfoy dead?
This time, there was no mistaking Malfoy’s low snigger. Harry's relief at brewing a passable potion dissipated, gone like smoke. Embarrassment replaced it in a hot wave.
"Where first?" she asked.
Harry groaned and decided to let Malfoy have that if it meant he would shut up. He supposed he deserved it for Ginny, anyway.
“Well, I’m Harry then,” retorted Harry.
The page featured a photograph of Kingsley Shacklebolt wincing at a camera flash. Together, Harry and Ron read:

Malfoy stood in front of him, frozen as ice. His wand lay at his feet.
That night, Remedial Potions took place. When Harry entered, he found Boughbranch and Malfoy in deep conversation.
“It’s faulty,” repeated Malfoy, frowning at the deep crack. The snitch’s gauzy wings fluttered tiredly. “Supposed hero of the wizarding world and can’t even afford a proper snitch. Why’s that?”
For a second, Harry thought Peeves was staring right at him, but then he heard a muttered “
“Harry!” said Hermione, her expression clearing. “We were waiting for you—what took you so long?”
Harry continued to scan for the snitch; Malfoy might have grown distracted, but that didn’t mean he would too.
"Re-me-di-al Po-tions," singsonged Luna. "Bye, then. I'll save you some plums."
Malfoy raised an inquiring brow.

“And the peacocks?” said Harry. “Who’s taking care of them then, if no one’s at the Manor?”
Malfoy pulled up his shirt. His stomach—the inches Harry could see—was pale and hard. Red scratches crisscrossed across the skin. Below it was Malfoy’s navel, followed by a trail of dark blond hair.

“I haven’t got time for you,” snapped Harry, taking a seat.
“So, Harry, what do
Ron was muttering to himself, in the depths of his Potions homework. He glanced up as Harry speared two chicken breasts and three sausages onto a plate.
Finally, after an excruciating amount of time, the clock reached ten. Boughbranch inspected their cauldrons. Approvingly, she nodded.
, Malfoy?"
“Of course, Potter,” she said and composed herself at once. “And there is nothing wrong with that thought! But you see, teaching at Hogwarts should not be your first goal. However, if you are interested in pursuing academics, that’s certainly a viable option. And one day, an opening at Hogwarts may exist.
“Malfoy—”
Malfoy had nerve to ask Harry for something, after everything. And to guess—to
Harry scowled.
“Why are you telling
Harry didn't see what was so interesting about it. Neither did, it seemed, did Ron.
Now when he looked at Malfoy, he saw his face turn egg-white.
And then his hand slid down, underneath Harry robes, and palmed—
"Ow," he said absently. "Have to finish my Potions essay."
had direction. Ginny had announced that summer she was going to play for the Harpies, and Harry didn't doubt it for a minute. Hermione knew what she wanted too. She was headed for the Ministry, blazing with purpose to rid the world of house elf injustice or "blood purity" ideology, or both. Even Ron had decided on Aurorship.
"So, you've finished the essay then?" Harry asked, heaving down on the carpet next to him.
“If you needed my help, you should have just asked for it,” said Malfoy, scowling. “I’d forgotten how pitifully useless you are. Now, thanks to your fat head, my potion’s gone to the dogs.”
Perhaps it was Malfoy trying to
"Luna's a lesbian,” Harry informed her.
“What?” said Harry self-consciously.
, that Harry remembered what he'd read in the library the other day:
Malfoy’s hands were on Harry’s jaw, Harry’s throat. Everywhere he touched burned. Harry flushed deeply; he imagined what he must look like, patches of red spreading across him shamelessly…
Hermione shrugged and delved back into the book, but her nose seemed too deeply buried to read it. Ruefully, Harry pictured gears turning in her head.
“You’re sure, Malfoy?”
"Yes?" he tried again. "Yes. I'm fine."
Harry watched the kneazle curl its strange tail around the suit of armour's ankle. "Depends,” he said airily, “on what that hellebore is for.”
Harry scowled. "That's
Harry hadn't seen Malfoy like this since the day Malfoy had punched him—the day that Harry had seen inside his head, seen his mother lifeless as a corpse—
"Who are you trying to convince, Malfoy?" said Harry.
“Your father cared,” reminded Harry.
"Room's spinning," Harry muttered. His fingers were sticky.
And Harry had played into it like a fool.
“Shut up, you insufferable poltergeist,” Malfoy hissed.
“Oh!” Harry blinked in surprise, taking the proffered gift before peering inside. “Draco did you bake this?”
“You know the actual fossilized troll limb in the entrance hall might be to blame for that,” Draco commented wryly.
“Maybe it’s taken a fancy to you?” Harry grinned as he steered his friend past the lazily splashing koi fish and they knocked on Head Auror Pewterfoot’s door.
Malfoy gave a disapproving sniff as he finished with the report and slid it neatly into one of the filing trays.
“No,” Draco shook his head, chuffed that he might know some obscure knowledge that the other witch didn’t and they hadn’t even got to the quiz section of the evening yet. “That was due to Durchdenwald, who was Potions professor at Durmstrang at the time, claiming that Nachtnebel fudged his data but it was later revealed that Nachnebel had just had an affair with Durchdenwald’s wife so Durchdenwald bribed a house elf to slip sparrow entrails into Nachtnebel’s cauldrons when he demonstrated his theory at the European Potions Fair that year.”
“Oh here we go,” Ron snorted, clapping Dean on the back.
Draco groaned as he pushed away the remnants of his baguette and rested his head in his hands. He had barely been able to sleep for two nights now whilst making a mental catalogue of everything Potter could have potentially seen. It had been nearly a month of memories, Draco must have scratched his bum at some point or popped a pimple. He knew for sure he had gotten a little gassy after devouring a pot of chili and then attempting some yoga poses to help with his heartburn.
“Morning,” Harry grinned, stretching and yawning.
Harry and Ron strolled in as Auror Winshaw smiled in welcome, raising up a cup of what smelled blessedly like coffee.
Harry gritted his teeth before giving his boss a grim nod and exiting the room.
“Yeah?” Draco asked lamely, looking down and fidgeting with the buttons of the tight dark blue shirt he had on. It was silk, hand stitched from Milan and accentuated the slenderness of his waist without serving to make him look emaciated. He had also dragged out a pair of jeans that he had acquired a few summers ago. He had, upon Lisette and Magalie’s urges, decided he would reinvent himself as a confident young gay wizard who could get away with skin tight jeans and going into a bar alone.
“Fuck,” Malfoy snapped, staring hard at a trail of ants working their way up the tree’s trunk. Harry noticed that beads of sweat had gathered on Malfoy’s temples, where the skin was thin enough to show his spider-webbed blue veins.
“Don’t worry so much,” Magalie reassured him dutifully, “just stick to neutral topics like qudditch or the weather.”
Malfoy gave a gasp of surprise as Harry started forwards before remembering that this was just a memory and he couldn’t actually
“Bones?” Draco ventured tentatively. Maybe Potter was starting a cult and that was why he had invited Draco, everyone knew a Malfoy couldn’t resist a good cult.
During their third pensieve session Ron’s motion sickness got too bad for them to viably continue and they had to withdraw, leaving Malfoy munching on his singular lunch time prune. The reason for the prune, Harry had uncovered from one of Malfoy’s conversations with Magalie was a touch of minor bowel problems after accidentally eating some dairy cheese.
“Abdominal muscles?” Malfoy turned to her looking confused. “Magalie I thought we had established that there is little I can do about my lithe physique as evidenced by the infamous protein shake fiasco of last year.”
A small, golden speck whizzed across the field before coming into focus, revealing it to be a heart shaped snitch. The heart hovered above the two names,
“Do you think he knows who’s going to be looking at his memories?” Harry asked as Malfoy collapsed the mirror and sat down primly in his chair.
Harry sighed, “Wait, is this coming from Molly? Because I’m single over thirty and live in - ” Harry cleared his throat to affect his best Molly Weasley impression, “that big old rattling house all by myself.”
Harry laughed as he pulled himself back upright, grinning over at Malfoy who had inadvertently whipped up a large dollop of floating bubbles which settled gracefully on his head like a bonnet.
Draco shot his hand out and grabbed the knocker, rapping it suitably hard against the door. The door swung open a few moments later to reveal an alarmed looking Harry.
“Already there mate,” Ron huffed, “consider your position as my children’s godfather revoked.”
“Bunch of comedians, the lot of you,” Harry huffed. “And
“That some sort of stock cube?” Ron asked as Draco took a small orange marble like object out of a cupboard and murmured an incantation.
“Talking of dubious morals,” Harry muttered as Ron grunted in agreement. Barely anyone in the DMLE was a fan of the new memory laws that allowed aurors to sift through memories for clues or alibis. For one, memories could be altered, which is why they had always been discounted before in major trials. Secondly, it was a horribly invasive process and the long hours required during memory stake outs made even the most iron stomached of aurors prone to bouts of disorientation and nausea.
“Do it now,” Draco hiccoughed, brushing his hair back and looking delighted. “Rap something for me now.”
Draco nodded vociferously, “You should read Haggishead, she writes for
your faces when the Canons get through to the semis on Saturday. Not that I ever see that blond git anyway.”
After the table cheered for more cocktails on account of it still being hot and sunny, Draco cleared his throat to regain Hermione and Luna’s attention before realizing with a pleased flush that he had never actually lost it.
Draco nodded to himself and fished out an orange marble, rolling it carefully around in his fingers before whispering “
“Absolutely fine,” Draco replied, careful not to let his voice come out too high pitched. He still hadn’t removed his fingers from Harry’s chest, in fact they seemed to be moving of their own accord, gently feeling across the skin there.
“Well, what did you need me for?” Draco asked, grinning. His hair was tied back in a ponytail and there was a smudge of soil on his cheek that Harry now pettily decided he would wait until they had gone out in public to tell Draco about.
to was chilling enough.
“I’m just saying,” Ron shook his head, “the one week I could really do with being sent outside and all the criminals seem to have retired!”
“He’s really interested in all this theory stuff actually,” Potter continued, ignorant of Draco’s internal disparagement. “You’d probably get on well with him.”
“That’s right,” Bill piped up, the tension falling away as his posture changed and Draco could hear the rest of the beer garden again. “You can melt it down to use as ink on curse tablets or as edging on objects where you want the curse to be bolstered.” He turned back to Draco, “You interested in curse theory then?”
"Right," replied Harry. He stared at the empty bench where Malfoy usually sat.
Fending off Ron and Hermione’s concern, Harry left with them for breakfast.
Harry hadn’t expected to see her so soon. “No Arithmancy today?”
"Malfoy poison someone?
“Fancy meeting you here, Potter,” he said quietly.
To say Harry was perplexed by recent developments would be a gross understatement. Harry was
" Harry called just as Malfoy shouted, "
Grinning, Harry shrugged.
He'd woken in the morning to find that Malfoy had graced him with a large violet eye. He only hoped Malfoy's ribs suffered the same fate. Harry's pride was more wounded, in any case.
Harry looked like he wanted to say something back when the door burst open and a very frazzle looking Hermione jumped into his arms. “Happy birthday Harry!” she shouted before a young looking boy with strawberry blonde hair appeared and attached himself to her leg, staring shyly up at Harry and Draco.
Draco tried not to obviously look too smug as he reached for another piece of crusty bread. “Not to mention that I spent most of today trying to rework auror reports that wouldn’t even win a participation star in Kindergarten.”
“Oh, are we talking about our imaginary friends?” Luna interrupted with a beaming smile. “Mine’s a Horned Gobblefish called Ethelred.”
Draco laughed as Odette shook her head. “Ignore him Draco.”
Draco jumped as he heard the bedroom door open. He hurried out of the bathroom to see Harry standing there with a plate atop of which sat two very large burgers.
Since the last set of Ministry reforms however, more emphasis had been put on memories as evidence and there were new charms to try and check for retroactive alterations. It wasn’t water tight, but it was enough that every so often Ron and Harry would find themselves with their heads stuck in a pensieve for the day.
Harry could have kicked himself. “I know it’s fucked up,” he said, “that I know stuff about you now that you didn’t share willingly but please, give me a chance to share some stuff back. I’ll tell you whatever you want to know about me – I swear it.”
“Bloody Marlene,” Malfoy sniffed with a wry smile, “see if I ever do reports for her ever again.”
“I – I’m not finished,” Harry panted, “I don’t want to hurt you. Trust me okay?”
“Draco!” Harry said, jumping up as the other man walked cautiously towards him. Draco was wearing his periwinkle blue waistcoat, his robes tucked over his arm. Draco’s hair was in an uncharacteristically messy bun, as if he had untied it at some point during the day before gathering it back up with a plain black ribbon.
“Fig rolls today,” Ron stated miserably eyeing the platter of biscuits, “is this someone’s idea of sick joke?”
“Hey, how come Winshaw’s got a nasty black eye?” Harry asked. “I didn’t realise he and Solomon had any fieldwork this week?”
“Get all the girls running for the hills more like,” Draco retorted. He stretched happily out on Harry’s sofa, which, like a lot of the furniture in Grimmauld Place, was dark green and a darn sight more comfortable than Draco’s yellow one from the budget section of IKEA.
“How did you pass Potions, Potter?” Draco huffed. “The sand would need to be prebonded with the marrow which is impossible to do post mortem.”
Ron rolled his eyes dramatically, “You’d think the woman would have had enough of her children’s weddings by now, but nooo, apparently because it’s her only girl it’s
Draco concluded that he must have been distracted by Harry’s smile at the time, the man’s teeth were too white. Or perhaps it was his eyes, so stupidly green and expressive. Maybe it was because Harry had still been wearing his auror’s uniform with that tight white shirt and leather holster that just
“We’re meant to do it in pairs,” Ron groaned, “in case one of us misses something in the memory.”
“They aren’t half bad to look at though,” Theresa interjected. “I heard they’re thinking of doing a charity calendar at some point.”
“Don’t remind me,” Harry huffed. “My mouth tasted like frogspawn for weeks no matter what toothpaste I used.”
“Merlin,” Harry laughed, “well thankfully no, there’s no niffler erotica in these memories either.”
“So,” Harry cleared his throat, still very aware that Malfoy couldn’t hear a word he was saying, “Do you reckon that red headed witch will keep the baby even though it might be cursed?”
“Draco,” Harry whispered, moving his own hand to cup the other man’s chin and gently tugging so they were looking at each other. Draco’s tongue darted out to wet his lips as Harry’s face drew closer.
“Try now,” Draco whispered as Harry moved, achingly slowly, drawing himself a little bit out before burying himself again in Draco’s tight heat.
“Oh well that in case,” Draco smirked, “my co-workers make Morlocks look like a civilised species and my boss is one impotent bluster away from turning into a puffer fish.”
“Don’t tell me you feel sorry for the sod,” Ron groaned.
“Yeah, maybe,” Harry mumbled, watching as Draco continued to smooth out his shirt until seemingly content there was not a speck of soup left on it before he returned to his papers.
“Oh?” Draco raised an eyebrow, willing himself not to blush. “Is it just as fast?”
As a result, the jeans had never actually been worn and still retained a stiffness in the material, creaking slightly whenever Draco bent down. Hopefully, any embarrassing noises would be covered by a pub’s general ambience.
“Yes,” Draco replied, sliding his eyes towards Harry carefully, “I assume you had nothing to do with it?”
Harry took a deep breath, wondering if anyone would notice if he hurled a pair of cheeky hedge shears, the ends of the handles decked out in red stilettos, at his ‘previously’ best friend’s back.
more.
“Dear Lord Potter, how exactly
“Oh they are,” Harry grinned, “Ron’s very proud of his barbequing prowess.” The other man gestured for Draco to lead the way and when Draco glanced back a few moments later he couldn’t help but notice that Harry’s cheeks were red.
“Oh,” Draco said quietly, looking down at the pastry that he now knew was lactose free.
“Draco,” Odette smiled, “do you think maybe that’s overreacting? I mean call me selfish, but I’m quite enjoying your company and Patagonia’s a little far for you to still make Sunday brunch.”
“I don’t have a syndrome,” Harry grumbled petulantly. “I just think he’s a bit lonely and yeah, okay I guess I feel a little sorry for him.”
“I didn’t know you took six Newts,” Harry commented, watching miserably as Draco shuffled the pile before turning to grab his briefcase and glancing at the clock. “How the hell did you do that without even going back to Hogwarts?”
“Ron, do I have a thick arse?” Harry questioned urgently as his friend dropped the sugar quill he’d been gnawing on and pulled a funny face.
He imagined Malfoy sat on his ratty yellow sofa watching Lilac Close all alone, who would laugh at his ridiculous impressions of Francis Featherhorn? Who would he turn to in exaggerated surprise at the weekly inevitable plot twist?
Harry didn’t reply, the month of May could still be quite chilly and despite heating charms, the Ministry was mostly situated underground, allowing pervasive damp to creep through until the heat of summer finally banished it. Besides, Malfoy didn’t exactly look like he had much fat on him, perhaps he felt the cold more than most.
Draco could see that they were just no longer inhabitants of the same world. Harry, who had filled out admirably with age, with wide shoulders and a gleaming smile, caramel skin, unruly but charming black hair, was in a different stratum of society. One with excitement, intrigue, political connections, respect, adoration and friends.
“Right,” Potter looked like he was trying not to chuckle, “Of course, my mistake.”
“Once a week, because we all do,” Hermione huffed, “and going to the pub is not a ‘hobby’ Harry, or at least it shouldn’t be.”
“Harry!” Ron boomed, evidently well into his beer. “Glad you made it, I was just showing Penny the watering can George got me for my birthday last year.”
“No!” Harry replied, looking aghast and hurriedly shucking the new shirt on. It was navy blue with the yellow emblem of crossed brooms on the chest. “Merlin, no Draco, I was honestly just teasing. I’m sorry. That was shitty of me.”
“Hah!” Ron exclaimed triumphantly, “You lose.”
“Don’t,” Hermione warned darkly, looking vaguely ill.
Draco choked on his own spit as Harry flashed him a wink and he tried desperately to clear his mind of any of Harry Potter’s anatomy resembling fruit.
Harry stood frozen on the utility room doorstep of Hermione and Ron’s house, looking out onto their back garden.
“Uh, yeah,” Harry jerked backwards, sending small ripples through the water. “Sorry about that, the kids always get over excited at these events.”
“Cheers,” Harry grinned, “I reckon it’ll be alright. Luna tells me I’m the sort of ‘handsome’ that will get better with age.”
“Paris,” Harry nodded, feeling inexplicably disappointed.
“Harry, stop it,” Draco muttered in a strangled voice, “this is silly.”
“Crikey,” Harry winced.
Harry tried to make sense of what the other man had said whilst Lisette cocked her head and gestured, thankfully, for Malfoy to explain.
“Indeed,” Pewterfoot smacked his lips. “Only there are other factors.”
~**~**~
“Pssh,” Ron laughed, “still dresses like a wanker doesn’t he?”
“Smart boy that one,” Draco replied, “knew we were related somehow.”
Harry pulled out his wand to cast the fast forwarding spell, the sooner he got through these memories, the sooner he could get Malfoy acquitted.
more special – I mean what am I then? Chopped liver?”
“Ooh I think I’d quite like a glass of Merbrew!” Hermione piped up giggling. Merbrew was a trendy new Norwegian ale that was fermented from some sort of kelp that only merpeople could farm in arctic waters. Harry remembered Percy complaining about the number of import tariffs and taxes involved in creature – wizard trade deals, meaning that even though the drink was quite cheap if you were in Tromsø, the London mark up was enough to make your wallet quiver in fear.
“Yeah,” Harry laughed, nudging a patch of daisies on the lawn with his toe, “I’m a wizard of specific tastes.”
“Pretty much yeah,” Harry grinned ruefully. “And the way you sounded when you were talking French to Alexandre earlier.”
Harry took another gulp of his tea as he imagined Malfoy diligently scouring the pages of trashy magazines for animated coupons. It was such an incongruous image to the sneering boy at school who boasted only the best copper cauldron imported from Germany.
deducting an awful lot of points from Hufflepuff.”
“Oh fuck you!” Harry laughed, lurching forwards to dunk Draco’s head under the water and roaring with laughter as the other man came back up spluttering and thrashing.
“Because,” Harry swallowed and stared at the ground, “it’s my birthday.”
“It’s a lovely day isn’t it?” Penny stated valiantly as Harry stood there with all the social graces of a kumquat.
“Even better,” Terry Boot came up beside them, “they got a new one, look it can make lattes and cappuccinos and everything!”
“I’m not really…” Harry began but Luna clapped her hands together loudly as if she had just been struck by a brilliant idea.
“There is no relationship!” Harry interrupted with a squeak, regretting choosing Penny as the first name he could think of. The other auror was really rather attractive and for some reason Ron had decided she would fit in brilliantly with their group. Although Harry wasn’t quite sure that was the best criteria for dating someone, but still.
“Bloody –“ Harry panicked, “
Malfoy walked slowly over to the sugar pot as Harry held his breath when
“Draco?” a pretty woman in her early thirties was sat beside him. Her skin was dark and her hair was a mane of glossy curls, she was wearing a large cream cashmere sweater and her eyebrows were knitted together.
“Fuck,” Draco swore, jumping up and running out of the kitchen.
Draco rolled his eyes as he summoned the sugar pot and then brought the two steaming mugs over to the table.  Harry took a sip of his, smacking his lips in contentment before frowning at a spherical object sat beside a small pile of newspapers.
yet?” Harry asked Malfoy excitedly as they left the shop. “Apparently it’s the prequel to
“Yes, I should imagine he is,” Luna nodded, levitating the jar of sprinkles over to a table where a harassed looking witch was trying to calm down her two bawling toddlers. “I mean you have to agree to have your memories probed don’t you? Why would you ever do that if you’re guilty?”
“Ron and I think the potions smuggling is just a side operation,” Harry told Pewterfoot, “a way of funding a faction of the Twisted Gnosis.”
“Another thing just changed,” Harry informed him, his eyes sparkling. “I’m now thirty one.”
Draco shifted uncomfortably on his seat as Potter looked expectantly at him.
,” Harry insisted as the doors dinged open and they followed the other Ministry workers towards the floo ports.
“Just a moment,” Malfoy called out distractedly. Harry walked back to the sofa to read Malfoy’s note, he knew he should probably just be fast forwarding through the entire thing, this clearly wasn’t anything to do with the investigation but he couldn’t help himself. Malfoy’s handwriting was, as always, incredibly neat and stylish, slanting slightly to the right in tightly looped cursive.
“You can still get to know someone well enough through their memories,” Harry protested. I’m not saying we’re suddenly bosom buddies on anything like that, I just think that when this investigation is over it might be nice if we, well, if we all gave him a chance or something.”
“Harry,” Harry supplied, still looking determined. Somewhere from behind them a grandfather clock struck midnight. Draco would have to be getting home soon he supposed, but his body didn’t want to cooperate with him.
“Oh shut up you,” Draco smiled fondly, “besides we all know what’s going to happen. I’m going to absolutely outshine Granger in general knowledge and his entire bunch of Gryffindors will weep with gratitude.”
Draco nodded as Harry looked relieved, inching slowly out of Draco. Draco gasped, he felt so strange and empty but Harry quickly filled him up again with one of his fingers, it was just the right size to allay the ache without being too much.
“Oh my god, Harry,” Ron whispered. Harry looked up to see that Ron was peering down at the remnants of the orange marble that Malfoy had been fiddling with earlier. “I know what this is! George looked into charms like this to see if there was some loophole in the U.K. laws on it.”
“Um, yeah I do,” Harry winced, “I tend to do other things whilst I’m eating, like watch telly or read magazines and I got fed up with constantly getting spills on my clothes. Besides, when I’m home I tend to like to just hang loose you know?”
Ron wasn’t stopping with his irritatingly knowing grin so Harry quickly tried to redirect the conversation.
Draco could have hugged Hermione, as she took that moment to start up a loud conversation about governmental funding, distracting the rest of the table whilst Draco attempted to subtly sniff himself, maybe he had used too much of the tonic after all?
“Hey,” Harry said, leaning forwards, “shit, sorry, it’s okay. God, I know this has already happened and you can’t even hear me…” Harry sighed, at a complete loss of what to do. He had wondered when Malfoy was going to run out of the Pop Up Pals marbles, he’d been using them more sparingly over the last week.
“Oh god,” Harry winced, “sorry about that, I was telling him about a friend’s houseplant and I think he must have got confused.”
“Picklemarsh wants the Munich report on his desk by four pm,” Marlene informed him with a placid smile. Draco pulled a face before huffing.
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, pushing open the door, “think I’m just a bit tired. I was wondering if I should put in for some leave after this case. I’ve got quite a bit stored up.”
Harry blinked in surprise, he had assumed that a basement paper pusher wasn’t exactly Malfoy’s dream job but he hadn’t really thought about what
“Did you see the latest episode of Lilac Close?” Magalie asked excitedly as Draco plucked sprigs of parsley from his herb corner. He bit his lip in a smile as he turned slightly towards her with an affirming nod.
Draco stopped himself from rolling his own eyes, Potter looked so shocked to see him, the git probably hadn’t even realised that Draco still worked for the Ministry.
“Ed and I were just buying ingredients from the Italian deli up the road,” Marlene announced, turning a smarmy look on Draco, “thought we’d have a romantic dinner tonight to remind us of our lovely holiday in Tusca –“
“Perfect,” Magalie declared, jumping up and heading to the kitchen. It was always this way, Draco had made sure to send a sample of his memories to the store and a clever bit of charm work allowed a partial legilimens access for the illusions to know what to say and who to be.
“No, wait, please,” Harry reached out to lightly touch Draco’s hand, lowering his wand again. “I have something I want to say.”
“Harry,” Draco amended.
“They held a press conference in the atrium!” Malfoy exclaimed, waving his spatula about erratically as if he was quite enjoying himself. “As if the rest of us might not feel like being able to get to the Floo and go home at a sensible hour. And
“She’s not actually real, Harry,” Draco gritted out, his jaw clenched.
“Nasty rot infestation you’ve got down here Marlene,” Winshaw snorted as his girlfriend rolled her eyes. Harry watched as Draco’s face paled and tightened, screwing the lid back on his soup and staring intensely at the paperwork in front of him.
Harry followed Ron into the man in question’s office. Pewterfoot was indeed hunched over his fish tank which was a completely clouded black.
“Just a scratch,” Memory Harry shrugged with a smile, “this isn’t my first rodeo.”
“Right,” Draco cleared his throat.  “Well I suppose it’s for the best we’ve established you didn’t mean it.”
“Journey to the centre of the Earth,” Harry muttered as they finally arrived at an open office area housing about three other people, two wizards and one witch.
Draco froze somewhere between the A’s section of the bookshelf he was perusing, what in Merlin’s name was Potter going on about now? If he was angling for something it was still too nubilous for Draco to make out.
The first thing Harry did when he went home was order a new pair of uniform trousers.
Harry let out a sigh of relief as Draco’s wards allowed him to reach the front door of his flat. He couldn’t help but feel happy that the other man must have recently amended them. Harry rang the doorbell, waiting until Draco opened the door in his pajamas with a shocked expression.
Half an hour later another owl bearing the Gringotts’ seal, this time a Greater Sooty, came hurtling through the room before dropping a heavy A4 brown envelope in front of Draco.
“Sir,” Malfoy cleared his throat, “I was not in charge of the Krüger files, that would be Marl-“
~**~**~
“She’s not real,” Ron replied, looking up at Harry with a shocked expression, “I think she’s a charm.”
“Huh,” Teddy paused thoughtfully, “Does that mean
“I’m sorry?” Harry asked, coming up to stand beside him.
The two of them were dismissed, Harry pausing as he stood in the doorway. He glanced back to see Pewterfoot sprinkling some large squirming grub like creatures into the tank, each one plopping into the now murky depths before a flash of white tentacles grabbed them.
“It’ll be announced in the newspapers come Monday,” Penny said proudly. “Ed and I were able to get some information from one of the troll trainers after finding out his daughter broke her parole for illegal wand enhancements last autumn. He cut a deal and we got our names, apparently one of the main financers was Bernard Muddleford.”
“I go rock climbing,” Harry protested, before realizing that was the world’s biggest lie. He hadn’t been rock climbing in years and had only done it the once because his then boyfriend had insisted.
Magalie smiled at Harry, her eyes bright and knowing, “Yes Harry,” she replied, “I think I understand now.”
“Yeah, well the acoustics are better in my bathroom,” Harry muttered as Draco ugly snorted.
“Fine,” Draco replied as they exited out onto the back garden which had been extended into a fully decked out pool area complete with its own bar. It was also already swarming with people, all laughing and talking. A big cheer went up when then spotted Harry along with a rousing rendition of happy birthday, that Hermione assured him Neville had also had to tolerate when he had arrived.
“What on Earth are you talking about?” Harry asked, he had never heard of anything like this. “Are you trying to tell me that Malfoy’s girlfriend is the magical equivalent of a blow up doll?”
“Your secret garden can wait,” Ron laughed. “Swing by around one yeah?”
“Ah, what’s that other one?” Harry tapped his head, “
“Magalie,” Harry began, “I wanted to say thank you, for being there for Draco.” Harry ignored the small noise from beside him. “Thank you for telling him to believe in himself and that he was worthy of good things.”
“Yup,” Harry nodded, wondering if he could borrow one of George’s themed shovels to dig himself further into this hole. “Penny…Penelope Clearwater!”
“Nothing like a mother’s love to get past the fact your spawn has bat wings and a predilection for human blood,” Harry added jovially as Malfoy reached for another carrot.
“No!” Harry groaned as Draco jumped up out of his seat. He felt slightly woozy from all the Pimms they had knocked back and he clutched the rim of the table for support.
“You’re all dead to me,” Harry griped, reaching forwards to grab a bottle of Ogden’s from the garden table.
“What, like my wedding or something?” Draco snorted. “And now before hymn 58 we will have a brief reading by the imaginary maid of honour.”
That was when Draco had stopped cold and realised, he had never truly had any friends. And the chances of making any now were laughable. The closest he had was Marlene who worked in the office next to him and was dating Auror Winshaw. Marlene didn’t actively seem to detest Draco to the same extent as his other colleagues.
Harry rolled his eyes and tried to remember that he actually loved this man. “Yes, you’re right, insufferable but right.”
“There have to be rules right?” Draco murmured. “They have to fast forward through anything explicit?”
“If that’s what you want mate,” Ron shrugged.
“Oi – if you two aren’t going to pull your quiz weight I’m cutting you out of the prize money,” the other man chortled as Harry rolled his eyes.
All of the fight seemed to leave Malfoy at once, seeping out of him in a draining wave. The other man slumped further down the wall.
“So, Hannah – do you still play the French Horn?”
magic,” Draco interjected witheringly as Harry grinned. He knew the other man was only doing it to wind him up.
“Yeah,” Harry sighed, feeling very tired. He could still hear the rustling paper of the animation charm on the wedding invite above his head and wondered how many goals would be scored before it fizzled out.
“Surprised you haven’t gone after him,” Ron snorted, clinking his beer bottle with Seamus’.
“Well,” Ron put up his finger and grinned at his sister, “on account of my delicate constitution, we’ve decided it’s best that Harry does the memory dives whilst I get on with reports.”
“That she’d fit in well with our group,” Harry muttered, “Yes I heard.”
“Of course,” Malfoy sighed to the empty room, “Ackley Wendleson was trained as a chaser only to switch to seeker when he signed with the Ballycastle Bats. It’s pretty obvious in the way he plays as well.”
“You might like him now,” Harry continued, acutely aware he was just digging himself deeper. “Honestly, Ron, he’s not so bad. He reads science fiction books and plays chess, you know I finally learned how to execute the Jacobean Jolly? That move where you put your rook –“
Harry had half a mind to reach across the desk and strangle Malfoy’s boss. Uther Picklemarsh had called Malfoy in for a meeting at the unreasonable time of ten to five only to spend the next forty-five minutes blaming the other man for seemingly everything wrong in the department.
“Merlin, he’s a right berk,” Ron sighed, watching the other auror walk away to take a seat.
“Only on my birthday,” Harry grinned. “Plus, I had a plant based burger for lunch so I reckon I can afford to be a little unhealthy.”
“Hanky panky?” Harry laughed.
The perpetrator had been marched off by security towards some office but Draco knew it was all for show. Behind closed doors, the security guards would probably give them a firm handshake for their troubles. Being an ex Death Eater meant that Draco was used to the seething looks, the suspicious frowns, the jeers, the taunts, the insults, and on particularly bad days – the bodily fluid projectiles.
Harry snorted, leading them through the house to the kitchen, which was looking lighter and warmer than when Draco had found it yesterday. The magic appeared to be coming alive again as Harry took out a couple of plates and a knife from a drawer. “I can definitely promise that,” Harry grinned, “the headmistress is currently out of the country visiting the summer school at Ilvermorny.”
“Oh right, well, yours is one of the names on the front,” Harry frowned.
“Oh,” Harry smiled apologetically, “the shirt was feeling a bit sticky so I thought I’d change into a different one.” He held up his hand a moment later before saying, “Accio Puddlemere shirt.”
Luna had never really bought into the typical boarding school habit of calling people by their surnames. Harry prodded at the blue sprinkles, whose dye was now melting in with his green pistachio scoop.
“I’ve been thinking about taking a holiday,” Harry announced, “somewhere I haven’t been before. I’d like a beach and a pool, maybe one of those coconuts that you can drink out of.” Harry watched as Malfoy carefully sealed the lid back on his Tupperware and cast a freshening spell on his teeth.
have to bribe anyone with?” Ed’s eyes ran over Draco, zeroing in on his right knee, where Draco knew he had a floo powder stain from that morning, the type that only happened if you used the cheap variety.
Draco grimaced as he shrugged off his robe that had been covering his smart blue waistcoat and steam pressed suit trousers. There was a shiny globule of gunk smeared along the bottom of it where someone had spat at him as he had been queuing for the Floo network.
“Merlin I
Harry glanced up at the chalkboard above the counter in Fortescue’s. He had a strange craving to try fig ice cream but it didn’t seem to be on offer. In the end he settled for coffee and pistachio before sitting down at a small corner table.
“Dear Lord,” Malfoy exclaimed, although it sounded a little squeaky. When Harry glanced back over he was surprised to see that Malfoy was glued to the screen and sporting a faint blush.
“Yes!” Harry declared triumphantly. “A bloody massive one that never gets used.”
“Good lad!” Pewterfoot nodded. “Nice to know I still have some competent aurors around here. Now, let’s talk decapitations, apparently the head was actually pickled in vinegar this time…”
time, you are
Harry grinned before the fire flickered out, he was already looking forward to it, Ron’s barbeque skills were pretty legendary and it would be nice to be outside in the fresh air for once rather than being stuck inside the windowless pensieve room. Harry felt a strange twang of discomfort as he wondered how Malfoy was getting on in the Ministry’s holding cells?
Harry’s desiccated house elf had turned up at one point to express his profuse joy at finally having a Black by blood in the house. Even though Harry had rolled his eyes behind the creature’s back he hadn’t looked too offended.
“Plant problems,” Neville grinned, “Harry’s friend is struggling with their fern.”
“Laurent said the same thing,” Pewterfoot sighed, tapping his quill on his desk.
“Fuck, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” Harry mumbled, averting his eyes and hurrying over to the bed, underneath which he had finally spotted his wand. Harry made a noise of hysterical frustration as he leaned against the side of the mattress in order to try and extend his arm underneath the small gap. His face was only inches away from Malfoy’s. The other man was letting out rhythmic whimpers now in time with the thrusts of the arm half hidden behind his back.
Harry found himself smiling, stirring his remaining puddle of ice cream with the mini wooden spoon. “He’s funny and he’s still very clever too, actually,” Harry grinned, “he’s got one of your books.”
“You ever been to Hawaii?” Harry asked as Malfoy ran his fingers over his lips before frowning.
There was another pause as Draco fidgeted with his book, “Are you trying to be my boyfriend?”
by Claudius Onkel,
The latter was a criminal organization of European witches and wizards who were comprised of cult like political beliefs. In fact, only a week ago the Twisted Gnosis had been blamed for the robbery of a selection of dark artifacts from the wizarding wing of the Louvre. Two months before that, a cursed goblet had gone missing from the Uffizi in Florence, although the connection had only become apparent after the Parisian heist. The goblet and a necklace from the Louvre shared a provenance, having once been in the collection of a notoriously dark alchemist from the sixteenth century. An alchemist whose works were the founding manifesto for the Twisted Gnosis.
“Please, they’re doing loads of dairy free options too now,” Harry repeated, ignoring the pointed clearing of throats behind them, he highly doubted anyone was going to be
On Monday morning, he donned a lemon coloured waistcoat with a crisp white shirt and charcoal trousers before hurrying out of his flat towards the local floo point. Sure enough, the cold snap was decidedly over and Draco could feel beads of sweat soaking into his starched collar.
“What?” Draco asked.
“Right,” Draco nodded, wondering if he could ask Narcissa about some of the odd locked doors they had come across on his guided tour.
“No good ideas start with the phrase ‘those kinds of people’” Harry replied woodenly, ignoring Ron’s curious look as Pewterfoot promptly dismissed them.
“Yeah,” Harry replied, swallowing dryly. He had never given much thought to who Draco Malfoy would end up with. There had been some rumours before the war about pureblood arrangements but that had all fallen apart. The woman seemed so different to Malfoy, his polar opposite in nearly every way, but then again, what did Harry really know about this Malfoy?
Draco’s birthday. His awful run in with Winshaw to his own mother failing to turn up. Draco had gone half spare that day trying to find Magalie’s last marble. Had Potter and Weasley seen all that?
“Oh Harry, I’m sorry, it’s just you look like we’re back in school and Hagrid told us that flobberworms have IQs of 203.”
“How many times have you run into him over the last ten years?” Luna enquired innocently.
“Yes!” Harry whooped with a smile. “Yes you did you forgetful wally.”
“Potter, we haven’t spoken in a decade,” Draco affected his best apathetic drawl, “for what godforsaken reason would I be looking for
“Wait,” Harry smiled, holding up his hands placatingly, “I didn’t know cuddles were being offered, that changes everything.”
“Ron, it’s okay,” Harry managed a small smile. “We’re aurors, we’ve all seen the cells.”
“Do they?” Harry cocked his head curiously. “I’m pretty sure all my friends think I’m a bit of an idiot to be honest and I know for sure Teddy thinks I’m ‘cringe’, he tells me so regularly.”
“Fuck off,” Harry exclaimed as the other man exploded into howls of laughter, they were disturbing the other customers now. “God, you’re such a git.”
“No you silly duck,” Magalie rolled her eyes, “I mean you need a man with muscles.”
However, it didn’t look like Draco was going to be showing up anyway. Maybe Draco had already left early so as to avoid Harry? Perhaps he hadn’t even come into work today and there was a pile of uneaten pastries sat on a basement desk somewhere.
“Not much of a choice,” Hermione sniffed, picking at a scab on her hand. There had been a contagious burning curse victim at St. Mungo’s the other day and Hermione had been one of the few Healers who had been brave enough to get hands on enough with the patient in order to save them. Ron had told Harry with a fierce pride that his wife was going to be Head Healer before long, Harry didn’t doubt it for a second. Hermione, however, had stated that she might be more interested to focus on research as she spent a lot of time in the magicpharm laboratory now working on prevention and cures to rare magical afflictions.
Draco arrived at the steps of Grimmauld Place ten minutes early. He already regretted not casting an enlargement charm on the trunks he had on under his shorts, they were from when he was younger and a certain Harry Potter had been sending him fewer pastries.
“Alright, here we go,” Dean Thomas clapped his hands together eagerly, “there’s fifty galleons in the pot tonight lads, split between the nine of us that’s about five galleons and nine sickles each, not too shabby eh?”
“I did not,” Harry protested before staring down at his dessert. “You know if you don’t like the blue ones you could just vanish them?”
It was a bloody set up.
“Oof,” Matthew laughed. “Not a fan of those ruby robed heroes eh?”
“Did they do it on purpose?” Harry asked. “The aurors,” he explained at Hermione’s quizzical look. “Only,” Harry cleared his throat, “I’ve seen quite a bit of stuff like that in Malfoy’s memories, I reckon he still gets stick over his role in the war.”
“Ce n’est pas grave,” Magalie beamed. “Just make sure to let me know
“You make it sound like I drink too much,” Harry protested, “I’m always the one ordering pumpkin juice.”
“I suppose so,” Draco nodded. “How do I get to Weasley’s?”
“How long have you known?” Harry asked, pushing his glasses up.
“Sorry,” Draco grinned sheepishly, not feeling sorry at all.
“This ‘stuff’,” Draco repeated witheringly, hoping he was conveying to Potter quite how unimpressed he was.
“Oh!” Potter’s face lit up like his team had just won the Quidditch world cup. Maybe he was a huge fan of that particular restaurant? Although Draco had a hard time imagining Potter seeking out small French bistros in his spare time. “Okay, maybe another day!”
“No – you, you can,” Draco replied, his voice hoarse and his throat clicking together.
He rejoined the memory a few hours later and frowned at the scene in front of him. Half of Malfoy’s flat was in complete disarray and the man himself was on all fours rooting around under fridge. Malfoy’s hair was stuck up at odd angles and he had lost the waistcoat, his shirt now looking rather disheveled.
afterward
Harry turned back to the note. Though far from explicit, it felt dirtier than anything he had ever read. It took him more effort to breathe than usual.
said Malfoy, rolling his eyes. “Just never brought it up. So?”
Malfoy snorted. "Take it easy, Potter."
Ron sat up eagerly. From the window, Hermione groaned.
The portrait hole swung open, and Hermione appeared.
At once, Malfoy was encased in a large, transparent bubble that bobbed cheerfully around the room. Face furrowed in anger, he pummeled its walls, shouting soundlessly.
He found the Fat Lady giggling with a toothless old wizard. They were sharing a bottle of red wine, clearly inebriated.
Immediately, Harry slapped a hand over it and whirled around: Hermione was fretting over Ron, who still seemed somewhat Confounded. No one looked at Harry or Malfoy.
Uneasiness consumed him. In class, he found himself glancing at the door with alarming frequency. In the hallways, he’d turn, wary of a tall, pale-haired figure (Zacharias Smith shot him a perplexed look when Harry jumped at the sight of him).
Harry didn’t know what to say. “...Sorry,” he muttered at last.
Shaking his head, he shoved the magazine into his bag.
“Let’s hear it.”
Crookshanks screeched loudly. Tail high, he shot out of the room as fast as his piggy little body allowed.
Hastily scribbling an answer to his last unfinished question, Harry got up and turned in his quiz. He surveyed the room: everyone else, Flitwick included, was otherwise occupied.
Malfoy
Harry yanked his sleeve over his hand and glared.
"Now, please," said Boughbranch. She sat at her desk and squinted at them beneath bushy eyebrows.
“A man?” interrupted Harry before he could stop himself. “Not—a boy?”
Harry felt Malfoy’s eyes on him. Something must have shone on his face, because Malfoy said lowly, in a tone that Harry had never heard him use before, “There’s nothing wrong with it, you know.”
“Self-preservation,” said Malfoy.
"Your handwriting's
“Right,” replied Malfoy tartly, “that’s why you insist on staring into my cauldron.”
“Well said, my dear,” said Splog approvingly. “Take ten points. Now—”
," groaned Harry, dodging it. From behind him, he heard a yelp; he smelled burning fabric.
