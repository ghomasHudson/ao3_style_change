“Well, of course you do,” the man rolled his eyes. “That’s exactly what you’re doing now, isn’t it?”
“Oh Merlin,” Harry sighed exasperatedly, a hint of smile on his lips. He grabbed Ron and dragged him over to Charms classroom, deciding that maybe he’d try to put some effort into his notes today for Hermione.
Harry zoned out of their conversation not long after that. He wasn’t much in the mood to join their conversation, and he could sense his best mate wasn’t either. He seemed to still be suspicious of the new comer, and Harry had to admit that he felt the same, just slightly.
“Now, before we allow the new members of our student body in, I would like to prepare you in advance by informing you of the many new students that will be transferring in this year. Besides the first years, that is,” she said, and the hard-earned silence she procured just moments ago was blown in shambles.
“Nothing,” Neville said quickly. “I mean, we’ve gotten closer over the summer during the rebuilding and all, but I’m not sure how to get him alone now, especially since they tend to stick to each other like glue.”
There’s no way Draco would want to stay now, he sighed. Maybe I should leave a note that he can take his time getting his things and moving out.
Draco kept his eyes closed, but Harry felt him shake his head in his hands, which meant he was awake.
“I propose Firewhiskey,” Seamus said from the other side of Harry’s room. “Always paves the road to solid friendships.” Another perk of the Eight Year dorms were that they each got their own individual rooms due to the small population.
“No, I think I’ll be fine,” she eventually smiled once she saw Harry begin to fluster. At least she went with the script. “If the younger years don’t respect me as Head Girl, then at least I know I’ll have my work cut out for me.”
Like always, it didn’t take too long before Draco joined him. Really, if it didn’t take the man so long to actually drag himself out of bed, he would have considered arriving later than he did. And, like always, Harry had brought breakfast for the two of them.
Harry watched as Draco and Neville laughed merrily, unaware of the death-glares Harry was sending their way as they made their way down to the greenhouse, as per usual. It wasn’t that Harry hated either of them- not any more- but rather, he wished that he were there in Neville’s place instead, laughing with Draco and being on the receiving end of all his bright smiles.
“It’s fine. We could probably gather a few of the other Slytherins to study with us,” Ron waved off. “From what Neville observed, Nott and Greengrass are also pretty academic. And Goyle could use some help.”
“Alright, go rinse your hair off,” Draco commanded. “I’ll fetch you a clean spare towel since some of the potion dripped on the one you’re using now.”
“Well,” Zabini drawled beside them, getting up before extending a hand to help Davis stand, who took it gratefully. “That was interesting. Your girlfriend truly is something.”
Harry vaguely remembered that discussion. Both of them were kind of tipsy on wine, but he could still recall the important details
Harry was inexplicably charmed, and it took everything in him to not break out into the goofiest, soppy grin.
Harry was torn between prying for more information or letting it go for now and bundling the thinner man into his arms and buying him cocoa. He sighed. “It’s okay, you don’t have to tell me. Would you like cocoa?”
Ron gave him a light chuckle. “I guess you’re right. Why join some cultural exchange if you aren’t going to be open minded?”
“Stop that,” he commanded, sitting by his head once again. “I’ve already lost an hour, so we have to get to work soon.”
“By the way, we’re expected in the office in about five minutes,” Harry said casually. Draco barely reacted, giving Harry a small nod before opening the lid of the cup, with much struggle, mind you, and blowing on his hot drink.
“Can my future husband keep it in his pants for a few more hours, because I’m knackered,” Draco said after pulling away. Harry wanted to say that he didn’t want to wait another minute, except he was also feeling tired himself.
“Best call Hermione, then,” she sighed. “At least that way we’ll have a healer in the area. Are you staying for dinner?”
“Fine,” Malfoy shrugged. “It doesn’t normally happen unless I try to leave, but most don’t like to leave evidence for the police.”
“Oh really, Harry?” He smirked. He placed his hand on Harry’s thigh, causing him to gulp a bit. That’s when he realized he was applying pressure, trying to put them in a certain position. Once they were, though, he seated himself in between his legs and crossed Harry’s arms over his chest. “I can be pretty competitive, you know?”
To which Malfoy responded by blinking slowly then turning his head to face Harry. “I refuse to lose to Potter at this, of anything else. Quidditch, fine blah whatever,” He said, suddenly very animatedly. “I’m not losing this game, Potter. I will play until either you lose or I die.”
“Yes it-” Harry sighed, realizing that this was just going to drag on, making them even more late for work. “Okay, look. The point is I’m going to come in here every morning to make sure you make it to work on time.”
“Yeah, I guess,” she shrugged. “If I remember correctly, the program he joined in his fourth year was for Ilvermorny, fifth in Castelobruxo, and back to Ilvermorny in sixth.”
“I like you here,” Draco admitted before letting his eyes flutter shut. A slow, lazy grin found its way onto Harry’s face right as he fell asleep.
“Most don’t bother,” Draco shrugged, kneeling at the foot of what Harry presumed was his own bed and opening his trunk to rummage through it. “You can take a seat, it might take me a while to find it since I lost a book yesterday and kinda threw everything around.
“No, I won’t,” Harry said firmly. “What’s wrong? You’ve been acting strange all evening. Do you even want to do this, still?”
Soon enough, the stinging pain was relieved and replaced with a cooling sensation while his skin returned to its normal color in a matter of seconds.
Draco did his best to not worry so much to avoid stressing people out at the party. He and Harry had came together to the Ministry’s New Year’s Gala, but somehow he had managed to lose his boyfriend not long after it had started. He didn’t even bother to stop and listen to those arse-kissing officials try to butter him up for donations to support their campaigns. He was on a mission.
More people came in and left the restaurant, passing by the increasingly boisterous table of 6 that paid no attention to the stares and glances they were getting. They were just happy to be able to spend a night together as a family before leaving to see the rest of their extended families for the New Years celebration.
“Aw c’mon mate, just bring him. It’s not like we aren’t friends with him,” Neville said, coming in. “It’s Gin’s birthday, you don’t wanna miss that.”
“Would it be alright if I cast a silencing charm?” he asked unsurely, taking a subtle glance of their surroundings. “I’d rather not have an audience listening in.”
“It’s not?” Draco asked, his eyebrows furrowing. He’s always heard that it might hurt the first time.
“And pray tell, why would you do that?” he asked, pushing up his glasses to rub in between his eyes. Maybe they didn’t see it. Maybe it was an accident and his father figure and boyfriend were still mentally sound. Maybe-
Harry gestured to him multiple times throughout the song, but the other guests were too distracted by the sells going off, providing them with special effects.
“Be kind, Ronald,” Hermione scolded him. “He just apologized to us. It seemed genuine and we have no actual reason to dislike him because he hasn’t done anything to us. You heard what he said, that we can all at least remain civil while they’re here.”
“Their leaves are used in laughing potions, which causes hysterical and uncontrollable laughter,” Draco explained, and Harry listened intently. “If you eat their leaves alone, that can also trigger it but it would be much more potent.”
It seems they weren’t the only ones who thought so, because he even heard a bloke wonder what way he swung. Not that he’d admit it out loud, but Harry was curious as well. For no other reason than mere curiosity, of course.
Harry was sorely tempted to say something sarcastic or teasing back, but he noticed the light sincerity in the other man’s tone and decided against it.
"They don't make any noise!" He said, the wizard-borns nodding while the muggle-borns remained baffled. Ron rolled his eyes. "So you can eat them whenever and your parents don't know, because they can't hear the crunching." He explained slowly, like he would a child. "
"I've… n-never done it without… feeling like this…" he whispered, tears rolling over his nose. Harry stared at him, stunned.
Harry opened his present from Mrs (and Mr) Weasley, finding a wonderfully expected knitted jumper. It was a nice earthy red this time, almost orange, with a silvery stag on the front. He grinned and pulled it on over his bare torso, smelling the warm comforting fabric happily. He looked up to see Draco watching him almost longingly, but when he realised Harry was looking at him, he frowned.
“I'm starving…” he said to Blaise as they took their seats, slightly shocked, and the black boy grinned at him.
“Potter only threatened that… He made me undo Crabbe’s trousers and…touch -…um…” he closed his eyes, his jaw clenched like he’d be sick if he had to speak about it, and Blaise held his hand.
OK, this chapter got away from me a bit but I hope it's building well! It's been quite fun to work out how the original Gringotts heist could be improved by literally any adult supervision.
“You're on my list, by the way…” Harry said after a few moments of silence, staring at the fire’s reflection on the polished stone floor. Draco turned to look at him with a frown, eyes narrowed in suspicion.
“Now,” Dumbledore said, sitting down behind his desk, McGonagall standing beside him “what was all that fuss about? Blaise? Care to explain why you brandished your wand at a fellow student?” he asked calmly, looking at him over his half-moon spectacles. It irritated Blaise, but he conceded, wanting Potter to be punished.
“Draco,” Crabbe said in the Monster’s words “can you help me pick a present for my mum? It’s her birthday tomorrow and I dunno what to buy.” Draco frowned at him, while Pansy looked livid.
Draco faltered. He forced himself to sit up, drawing his long legs up and pulling Harry’s robes to cover himself. He moved a shaking hand to messily smear the small trickle making its way down his chest, coming from what could have been a bite mark, or a blade’s. He looked at the red on his hand, frowning at it. “Did you want that?” Harry asked him. Draco looked at him, then sighed, wiping the blood on Harry’s robe. He looked down, his expression sad. He seemed to think for a moment, then spoke.
Draco and Blaise were sitting together in the library, he'd spotted them immediately, then Draco had seen him and it made his chest tighten. His smile stayed, he was out of breath from running around obnoxiously with his team and the other cheering Gryffindors. Harry faked his continued mirth, encouraging them all to head up to the Common Room for drinks. They all cheered, fully aware of how irritating they were being to the few students in the library didn't care out Quidditch and its subsequent winners, and lumbered out in a cluster of noise and jumping. He gave Draco's panicked face one last look, the grey eyes now fixed on Blaise as he tried to breathe, and the Monster gave a small writhe of...jealousy? Enjoyment? Harry wished Voldemort would fuck off out of his head and let him wallow in peace.
They got ready in silence, Blaise selecting a designer polo shirt and jeans and Draco changed into a dark navy jumper and black trousers, and making his own bed to perfection, having left it in disarray last night. They left for the Great Hall, feeling very much at ease in each other's company, and Draco even afforded himself a small smile. The tables were laden with eggs, sausage, bacon, baked beans, toast, tomatoes, mushrooms and black pudding when they arrived, and the smell, rather than roiling Draco's stomach as it usually did nowadays, actually made it growl.
“No… Voldemort was your-…?” Harry wanted to cry, it was so awful. Someone so evil taking something so precious, and so young. Draco flinched at the name, involuntarily, and nodded stiffly, looking down.
Harry watched him move away, and a small, shiny pink tongue slip out. Hesitantly, with fresh tears rolling down his cheeks, Draco licked his tongue over Harry’s slit. He tried to jerk away, disgusted, but the Monster held him still and close, pulling him closer.
"Do you regret killing those people? All those people you can't count?" Ron asked. Draco opened his mouth to respond, but nothing came out. He took a deep breath, then forced the words from his chest.
When they arrived at the castle, the two Slytherins went straight down to the dungeons. As soon as Draco was out of Harry’s sight, the Monster went back to sleep, and Harry had to sprint to the closest bathroom to vomit. He thought he’d reached the pinnacle of how disgusting he could find himself after last time…but this was too much. He curled up in the bathroom stall under his cloak, and sobbed. A second year even came in, but was frightened off by the disembodied crying. He sat there for what could have been hours, sobbing and thinking about how he’d left Draco in a very similar situation just week before…and now he’d involved another person… He thought it would never happen again, he would have rather died…yet here he was.
“Yeah, before the shops shut. We’ll see you at dinner.” Crabbe said. Everyone looked surprised by his sudden decisiveness, but they all seemed too tipsy to care. Draco sighed as he pulled on his coat, and Goyle moved for him to get out.
He gripped Draco's throat and lifted him into the air, his feet leaving the ground easily, and the three watching felt their air cut off, a horrible squeezing, claw-like fingernails and stinking skin penetrating flesh and noses. Then the faceless Draco was thrown onto his own bed like a ragdoll, bouncing once before Greyback was on top of him, ripping at his clothes, all while the screams and pleas echoed in their own heads, their throats raw with their force.
"Hermione, talk some sense into him." Harry said, incredulous. Hermione’s hands gripped each other tightly, her nails completely white even as they dug into her flesh.
was a memory charm that implanted a fake memory into the victim's mind, but they'd found out that the real memory remained, suppressed but there. It was an extremely advanced spell, far beyond the capabilities of a sixth year; it was the kind of thing only Aurors and senior Ministry officials learn.
"Snape knows. She wants me to know she's got bloody Snape involved, so he can manage any information that gets back to
After a few minutes, both women reappeared, McGonagall clearly trying to keep herself together as Pomfrey firmly closed the curtains. Pansy and Blaise both looked at her.
Short update after a long wait - sorry! But things are happening and change is in the air (both in the story and IRL!).
“Oh, you've decided to fight now, eh, pretty boy?” Greyback rumbled, reaching out his bloody claws and catching memory-Draco's chin, wrenching his head up to look at his. Suddenly, for just a moment, Greyback became crystal clear, his face visible down to the last line of his wrinkled snarl. His eyes shone in the dim light of the room, glassy and yet filled with loathing. And lust. Then it was blotted out again, like someone dropping water on ink, the features swirling and bloating until nothing remained but that awful mouth.
“He’s using me to rape Draco?” Harry asked, horrified. The teachers winced at the word, perhaps because a ‘confession' confirmed exactly poor Draco had been subjected to, and that it was what Harry himself who had been the culprit, even if it wasn’t of his own volition.
"I think I'll miss this place though." he said and Blaise had to agree. It was small and the neighbour's were noisy but it had got them through some very trying times, always protected them from the outside world. It was their first taste of independence, first glimpse of normal life, life as a couple, life as adults. It had served them very well but, as often happened, they had outgrown it.
Harry had moments of true anger, where he would snap and say something cruel. Everyone had their limits and his ever present obsession with Malfoy had been a growing concern from the off, though she’d never entertained the idea of it being fuelled by anything other than suspicion. Learning the unspeakable, awful things Harry had done, even if it was under Voldemort's control, had made her realise that she'd always suspected Harry of having a much darker side than he ever showed outwardly. She wasn't afraid of him, she loved him unconditionally as her very best friend, but she knew his darkness may hurt others, and maybe those others deserved it, but not this, not what he did. No-one deserved that.
“I...I'm scared..” He admitted, needing to get it out despite how childish it sounded. It had felt amazing the first time, arms wrapped around him with nothing but gentleness, and yet he was afraid. Blaise nodded and offered his hand, which Draco accepted after a moment's hesitation. His grip was lax at first, then tightened around Blaise's hand like it was an anchor.
Blaise had decided to eat with Draco in the Hospital Wing, unable to stomach the glances and mutterings and the chicken in white wine sauce the elves had served for the Sunday meal, despite it being pretty delicious. Madam Pomfrey had set them up with a little table over Draco’s bed to accommodate his guest, and they ate in relative comfort and silence.
“Harry? Are you alright? You’re really pale…” Hermione was saying but he just waved a hand vaguely over his shoulder, and went up the stairs. He hardly even registered he was casting a Muffliato spell as he went.
“Ok.” He said, and Malfoy glanced at him. Harry noticed again that he was trembling, despite the warm cloak over him and the fire-heated room. “Are you…feeling ok? You’re shaking…” Draco sighed, ignoring the question.
As if hearing him over the blaring music, Harry’s eyes shifted to his slightly hysterical boyfriend who was on the verge of falling to the ground because of his laughter.
Harry froze, staring blankly at the paper. He saw a hand get the box and open it, before Draco knelt down in front of him and offered him the ring.
“C’mon, Harry,” Draco huffed from his place in front of the mirror, “We’re graduating today and you still haven’t gotten out of the habit of ignoring the alarm I set for you at least 4 times before getting up.”
“Well, it’s already glaringly obvious I don’t know him, so what’s he like?” Harry asked, trying to sound casual.
“A Malfoy,” Ron practically sneered, but he remained seated, for which Harry was grateful for. He didn’t think that the Headmistress would take too kindly to them fighting one of the exchange students on their first day here.
“Hermione!” Harry called out to her when he saw she was just about to step out of the portrait. “Wait up!”
“And he didn’t decide to continue there?” Harry asked, feeling bewildered. Surely there are some inconsistencies in how things are being taught across the different schools around the world, so it would theoretically be easier to have just stayed in the same place.
"You might be handling it," Harry said. "But who's actually taking care of you?" This made him pause. "I care, Malfoy, because even if you're a prat, this isn't fair, okay? If the Ministry had known, they probably could have provided you with an alternative."
He wouldn’t put it past Draco to use almost illegal spells, or at least ancient and obscure spells that people have forgotten about.
Draco’s attention was focused on the way Harry’s hands moved over his body, one hand rested on his hip while circling the pad of his thumb over the sensitive skin there while his other hand rested just above his chest.
before mustering up a grin and agreeing. “Brilliant! You can keep wearing what you’re wearing. I like seeing you wear my clothes,” and he did. Something about seeing Draco wear Harry’s clothes like he was his just did something for him.
“I’d rather you not marry a Neo Death Eater,” Ron rolled his eyes, some bitterness returning. “But no. Whatever happened between you and Ginny is your business, and she isn’t crying and heartbroken or something.”
“What do you mean unrelated?” Draco scoffed, heart fluttering a bit as Harry took hold of his hand again, bringing it up to his face and giving it a quick kiss before settling it in between his palm and cheek, leaning on it for support. “You can’t tell me that costume wasn’t part of your grand entrance.”
“I mean-,” Draco said helplessly, his brain scrambling to piece a decent explanation together. “What does it matter?”
Harry was sure that he wouldn’t be wrong, considering they were all classmates, and gave in with a final sigh.
“You really are bonkers,” Harry laughed, pulling Draco closer and burying their faces in each others necks.
Ron gave her a smile, the type of smile where you could just tell he was in love with her, his emotions laid bare. Suddenly, Harry felt like he was invading on something private between the two of them and shifted his gaze elsewhere until it finally landed on Draco, who seemed to be thinking the same thing.
“Anything to get that reaction out of you,” Harry replied cheekily, practically grinning from ear to ear. “Remember when I used to do this when we were back in Hogwarts? You were such a hard-arse about them too. I remember asking: Is your father a thief? Because someone stole the stars from the sky and put them in your eyes, and your reply was-”
“Your father is a Slytherin, and everyone in that house is just like him. Should explain enough for you,” Ron sneered. “They all buy into that Pureblood bullshit. That house is full of conniving bastards who only care about themselves, just like the founder of the house. In fact, that’s probably where they got it from.”
“I told you not to talk to much. All that running around in my head must’ve tired you out as well,” Draco managed to get out, trying not to shove his face into his pasta in regret.
“Oh, them,” Draco snickered, watching as another block went soaring for the wall, this time creating a small hole while half of them cheered with excitement while the other half panicked about the ‘destruction of property’ like they couldn’t just spell it fixed.
“Yes, sir.” Harry wasn’t sure on how, exactly, Draco might plan on waking up earlier now, but he was thankful that they would get away with it this time, nonetheless.
“Fuck, you’re really-” Draco zoned out the rest of his comment, parting his lips as he took the flushed member into his mouth. He tried to take it as deep as he could before gagging, forcing himself to stop. Harry groaned even louder, his hand settling on top of Draco’s head. He felt his fingers grasp his hair, but he wasn’t pulling hard enough to cause pain.
Harry gave him a questioning look. “You told me to wet my hair, so I figured I might as well preserve my shirt for later.”
“If I managed to pass 6 years without studying too hard, then I’m sure I’ll be fine,” Harry retorted, smiling good-naturedly. “Besides, I can always borrow Hermione’s notes if you manage to resist my charms.”
The song that was strongly unfamiliar to Draco started playing, and it sounded like it was playing midway, so at least he had that much more to be grateful for. Now that he was closer to the stage and not being watched, he had the perfect opportunity to observe Harry and his attire.
“You found it?” Harry asked, shoving away all the possible reasons and things they get up to when he and Neville are in here, because Harry was the one who was with him now, and he’d much rather savour the moment.
“You did buy me coffee!” Draco grinned, perking up considerably. The grin he sent Harry was so blinding that Harry managed to accidentally burn himself while he retrieved their food from the demon contraption.
“Honestly,” the girl looked exasperated. “Draco has some friends there! And when I went after him after you insulted him, he told me things and asked me to give some of them a chance. In fact, he’s given me ideas that I want to bring up to the Headmistress to stop all the Pureblood prejudices being passed in families that are predominantly Slytherin.”
“There!” Draco said triumphantly before bending down once again to check Harry’s reflection in the mirror. Seemingly deciding that the reflection was no longer good enough, he instead shifted a bit to the side and grabbed  Harry’s face, turning it to face him.
“You do realize that you were invited too, right?” Draco asked, still not getting up from his spot. Harry was well aware that he was invited too, of course.
And after that, it was silent. Everyone else found a way to escape the screaming match, leaving the common room abandoned, leaving only Harry and Hermione.
“Absolutely not!” she exclaimed, drawing some attention towards them. Draco gave them an apologetic smile before they decided to turn back to their own conversations. “You were
Harry rolled his eyes with a grin and tossed it back, only to realize that Draco was snickering behind him. “What?” he asked, refocusing his attention back to the blond.
Harry was laughing too hard to be able to reply to him. Maybe he did break him, but he wouldn’t change having Draco Malfoy as his boyfriend for the world. Eventually, he was able to control himself a bit while his worried partner just watched him.
he brought Draco coffee. In fact, he even bought him his favorite chocolate croissants from the little cafe near his flat; not that Draco needed to know that.
“You know that thing you kept saying you should buy?” The blond asked, bouncing with every stride he took into the house. Well, Harry certainly didn’t ask for a bus, so there was at least that much to comfort him.
Harry was sorely tempted to do the complete opposite, if not because he’d rather have Draco do it for him every day then for the reason of just spiting him in general.
“Say one more thing about ferrets or faeces, Weasley, and I’ll have you seated with mother, father, Xenophilius, Pansy, and Blaise,” Draco threatened, already moving the names to the designated table of torture.
“They’re quite hard to obtain but Draco was able to reach out to an old family friend to get some for us,” Neville grinned, placing a hand on Draco’s shoulder while the blond simply turned his head and grinned back at his friend. “Now we could grow more here and multiply them.”
“Me too,” Draco replied. They pulled apart and spent a few seconds just smiling at each other, drowning out the other voices around them which had become increasingly louder as the year came to a close.
drag out. He wasn’t sure of what else to say, nor was he sure he’d be able to string together a coherent sentence while Draco was looking at him like
“Alright, you do what you want,” Harry said. “But don’t avoid your friends just because you don’t like Draco.”
“Well yeah,” Draco shrugged, side-eyeing him before looking back up at the ceiling. “He asked me to come with him.”
“Besides,” Draco added, stepping into Harry’s personal space before wrapping his arms around his waist. “I don’t want to pretend that we aren’t dating.”
“Mate, you’re being kind of strange about this,” Ron pointed out, trying to give him an easy smile but also seeming a bit unnerved.
Thankfully, Sofia seemed to have that all covered. It seems she’s well aware of the prejudice against Slytherin since she didn’t seem confused, but her eyes immediately hardened once Ron insinuated that Draco was anything like his father.
“What do you mean by that?” Hermione asked, looking both curious and doubtful while resolutely ignoring the outraged expression her boyfriend wore.
“He’s off-duty. They cannot have him work during a party he’s not on shift for,” Draco rambled. “What on Earth could they-”
“Right,” Ron scoffed. “Don’t tell me you’re about to start worshipping the ground he walks on as well.”
“I know,” Malfoy sighed, eyes downcast. From this angle, Harry could see how gray they were. “I do apologize for my father’s role in the war. My mother was able to keep me out of it for the most part, but I’m well aware of the role my father might have played against you.”
“Okay so first, I’m going to need you to wet your hair. We’ll work in the potion after that and let it sit before rinsing it out. It should last you a while, but you should probably redo the treatment every week or every other week to maintain it,” Draco instructed, waving him off to one of the showers.
He could feel Harry pressing against the different areas inside him, seemingly exploring his body both inside and out, while scissoring his fingers gently, making sure to avoid doing too much too fast so Draco doesn’t get hurt. Suddenly, he felt a shock wave of pleasure shoot up from the base of his spine.
“No need to baby me,” Draco huffed, protesting weakly but not quite pulling away. This time, Harry blinked and realized just how close they were seating to each other. In what seemed like a desperate attempt to change the topic, Draco added “You know, they’re probably assuming things since they know I was here all day.”
Well, actually he could imagine what he’d have been like. He’d probably be exactly what Ron described.
“It hadn’t escaped my notice that you and your classmates are dressed to have fun,” she raised an eyebrow at him and he found himself flushing, reasons unknown to him. It wasn’t like they were going to do anything, at least nothing that can be said based on how they were dressed. “I just wanted to say thank you, and I hope you get to enjoy this night. You, of all people, deserve it.”
“Wait a second, we have house elves,” Draco groaned, facepalming. He called one of them over and had her Apparate the food to their rooms. “Nobody will notice if we sneak out now. They’re too busy with dessert.”
So here they were, rebuilding Hogwarts and trying to make it in time before the school year was set to start. The only times Harry was able to get Draco alone when they were rebuilding was when they were assigned to work on the same area. It wasn’t that he and Draco weren’t quite speaking to each other, because the times they spent together were all fun. Draco had a decent relationship with most students in their year now. It was just that Draco spent most of his free time with Neville, and when he was with other people, about 65% of the time Neville was also present. For the rest of the time, Draco was with the other Slytherins that chose to come back and help out.
Once the number was over, Kingsley went on stage to introduce the next set of performers, drawing the attention of everyone else as Harry stepped down and made his way over to Draco, who stood at the foot of the stage wordlessly.
“I’m simply saying that some of us are eating and don’t really need that sort of display at the table.”
“Shall we get ready now?” Harry asked, making no movement to get up. He threw his arm over Draco’s waist, pulling him closer.
“Well I knew you were going to be family for a long time. But since you insist, Harry.” She smiled at him warmly. He was glad that his relationship with his mother-in-law was never sour. Not if how the initial proposal-fail was anything to go by.
“Harry, I swear to Merlin you aren’t making this situation any more fun,” it was a partial lie, Draco had to admit. It didn’t make bumping shoulders with strangers any better, but it was enough to keep his mind from straying to a string of curses instead. “The kids will be on our backs if we’re late.”
“Alright,” Draco nodded, turning himself without getting up so that his head was rested on the pillow. “See you tomorrow, maybe?”
“Oh, Merlin, no,” Draco whispered faintly, but it was drowned out by the whoopings of Harry’s friends and colleagues, along with everyone else present at that party.
all the blood stop flowing through his brain and head southwards. Well, he was going to see it soon, that was for sure.
Whether he said it to calm Harry down a bit or not, it worked. Yeah, he was still a bit peeved and tired of it. But at the end of the day, nobody got hurt, and he did love his boyfriend.
His hand moved from Draco’s thigh to his nipple, remembering how he reacted to when Harry played with them. They were still pebbled against the cold air, making it easier to grasp between his fingers, rolling the sensitive buds and tugging at them playfully.
He started grabbing things and throwing them into a suitcase, sadly looking around. So much of the place was filled with Draco. The interiors of the house, the furniture and decor that Harry couldn’t be arsed to pick himself, the mound of products and potions in the bathroom. He couldn’t imagine what the place would look like if Draco moved out. He’d probably even reconsider redecorating the whole place because it all just felt like him.
“What happened?” he heard Draco ask worriedly, now somewhat more aware of his surroundings. Footsteps padded their way over to where Harry was standing before he felt another shoulder press against his, right before a pale hand reached out for his own and gently lifted it out of the water.
Harry felt his pulse quicken, a hundred questions buzzing through his mind for possible reasons as to why he might have been searching for Harry.
“Fleamont Potter, I believe was his name,” Draco explained in a non-condescending voice. “At least I believe he’s your grandfather, if I remember my family trees correctly. Merlin, Potter, you should at least be aware of the thing that probably made your whole vault. Actually, it’s probably still adding today.”
“I don’t do one-offs, Malfoy,” Harry responded firmly. “I’d like to take you on a date at least. Treat you well.”
As it turns out, the week Hermione assigned him to partner with Draco was among the last 2 weeks of rebuilding, and now they were celebrating with everyone before heading out to the party Draco and Neville had pulled together at the Longbottom Manor. Nonetheless, it was a great fucking week.
“We were hoping you could help us,” Arthur said, grinning and looking rather sheepish as well. “Just to check it out or maybe find a way to bring it to a Muggle repair shop.”
He untwisted it, taking off the top with a soft ‘pop’ before pulling out a small velvet box and paper.
Harry suppressed a shudder and leaned into him as well, this time facing him. “I don't know, Draco, I’m feeling pretty confident,” and he was, especially after seeing his grey eyes widen a fraction at the use of his first name.
They headed out, Draco guiding them to a further part. “They might not make it this far with the time limit and how thoroughly they’re searching,” he explained. The place was kind of hidden, anyway. Or at least for the kids, because of the relatively high hedges.
“I really don’t think that would be necessary,” Harry laughed. “But I’ll tell you how it goes. I still think you should give him a chance.”
“But…” Harry pondered, wondering if this would be the best thing to say. He had only just managed to calm Ron down about the whole Draco thing, so he wasn’t sure if he should push it; especially since he knew the red head still disliked him.
“Draco? Are you ok? Are you having another attack?” he asked. Even after a good night's sleep and nearly a whole day, he wasn't sure he'd be able to help Draco properly so soon. But Draco was shaking his head, one hand on Harry's arm as the other held onto the bedpost for dear life.
“Hey...” he whispered, eyes barely open and voice thick from sleep, yet he knew to move his hands away. “Another one?” he asked. Draco nodded, trying to get his breath back.
“I asked Crabbe and Goyle. They woke up in a broom cupboard at 4 in the morning, and you were always skulking arou-” he cut himself off, biting his lip to muffle a moan of pain when he tried to stand a bit taller. Harry helped him quickly into the Common Room, which was just as he remembered it – large, grand, and cold. “Through there…” Draco said, pointing a shaky finger to an ornate black door to the left. Harry nodded and they went over to it, Harry awkwardly opening the door and manoeuvring them both through. Draco pointed to another door and they went in, finding a dormitory with 5 beds. It was very similarly laid out to Harry’s own room, except the reds and golds were replaced with greens and silvers, and it felt much colder in here.
They watched Greyback run his fingers up the length of his wand in a slow, lewd stroke, thinking, then he chuckled and placed it on the dresser by the door. Both Dracos gulped and tried to breathe slowly, dreading the physical attacks far more than the magical ones. Greyback was a feral creature, animalistic and primal in the worst possible ways. His raw, incredible strength caused Draco no end of broken bones and excruciating pain; injuries they sometimes didn't heal with magic for weeks, leaving him broken and in agony. Just for fun.
There were a decent amount of people still in the Hall when Draco and Pansy took their unconventional seats and, as before, the effect was immediate. The rumours would start anew and only those present were likely to believe such a fallacy, even with previous evidence.
“Yes...given the option. You can't blame him for-” he immediately regretted his choice in words when Draco sent an icy look his way.
which made him laugh. Fred and George had given him a load of his favourite Wizard Wheezes products; Alistair Moody, he assumed, had sent an unwrapped Sneak-o-Scope. Remus had sent a lovely picture of the Marauders, excluding Wormtail, and his mum, Lily, at some formal shindig where they’re all dressed up, raising  champagne glasses and grinning away, in a nice silver frame. On the back was written
This time, Draco screamed. His fingers scrabbled fruitlessly against the smooth cubicle wall, crying out for Harry to stop, begging him. The Monster thrashed gleefully inside Harry as he pulled out, revealing his slightly bloodied cock. Harry watched what he could see of Draco’s bony back shiver and tense as his insides were ripped apart, his head bowed low as he sobbed, the Monster beginning to fuck him with a strength Harry, himself, did not have. Draco collapsed at some point, unable to hold himself up on quaking legs. Harry watched him as he fell against the wall, but the Monster simply held him up as it continued the use Harry’s body to rape Draco Malfoy. Harry vaguely registered how utterly disgusted he was with himself, how much he hated what he was doing to Draco. The Malfoy looked so fragile like this, so thin and in pain… But he couldn’t stop. The Monster had full control now.
"Sorry, petal, but you do. For this, you do. And you need us. And we need you." She said with a smile. He looked at her with a huff of a laugh, and smiled back.
“Wow!” Harry cried, getting up to inspect. He pulled off one of the covers to find a plate full of what they usually had for Christmas breakfast: full fry up, pancakes, bagels, and smoked salmon. “Wicked…!” Harry said with a grin, holding his hand over the food and finding it to be piping hot. “Are you hungry?” he asked, looking over his shoulder to Draco. The blond looked at him and nodded. Harry grinned and grabbed his wand, levitating everything over to the coffee table. They both sat down, Draco having brought his own presents over to the sofas, and dug in. Harry glanced at Draco frequently as they ate, surprised and pleased to see him wolfing the food down hungrily.
“Potter…” he said softly, his voice a little hoarse. They both looked at him, Pansy about to explode that she knew it. “But he…he wasn’t Potter, his eyes were red…- He…he…” he bit his broken lip, fighting more tears. He was so tired. “He r-raped me…” he said finally, looking down.
What do we think? 😁 This isn't over yet, not entirely sure how many more will come but at least one I think. I just wanted to say thank you to everyone who has left kudos and comments, subscribed etc.! I was nervous about posting this story at all, it's a lot of angst and violence but I'm so pleased people are enjoyed it and complimenting my writing, it means the world! 💕
Draco was crying silently, his pale eyes looking anywhere but at what was in front of him, like if he ignored it, it would go away.
“Potter?” Harry startled at the voice and looked back at the table he was pretending he hadn't noticed. Draco and Blaise were looking at him, almost smiling. Harry forced a surprised smile back, waving to them, and came a little closer.  He saw the way Blaise tightened his arm around Draco, and how Draco rubbed his hand soothingly where it rested on the table, wandless but ready to protect or attack.
Draco placed his wand on the bed beside himself, then moved his hand down between his own legs. He bit his lip as he pushed one finger inside himself, turning his head so Harry couldn’t fully see his face, clamping his knees together defensively. This made Harry wake up and he rejoined him, gently parting Draco’s legs. He kissed his knees soothingly, making him sob softly but relent.
Christmas went by happily, then New Year’s Eve with all the fireworks Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes could supply, then before anyone knew it, they were on the train back to school. Harry glimpsed Draco on the platform at King’s Cross, looking somewhat healthier and almost happy, saying goodbye to his mother with a hug.
“Pomfrey gave me an appetite stimulant…” he said, not really looking at them. “So…what’s happening?” he asked. Blaise sighed and told him the whole story of what happened the night before, starting from their own conversation that led to them taking him to the Hospital Wing, unsure if he’d remember. Draco nodded along with a slight frown as he listened, waiting until Blaise was finished before speaking.
"Well, that's the thing. Draco's mum is sorting it for us, and she's got Snape feeding the right information to them. We just need to not fuck it up." He said, sighing heavily. Ron let out an ironic laugh.
“Dunno, all day probably. And tomorrow if we don’t get it done.” The Monster gave Harry the urge to make sure they had tomorrow with Malfoy as well, but he tried to ignore it. Hermione shook her head.
“I don’t care what they do with him as long as he leaves me alone…” Blaise sighed and nodded, inclined to agree…but Potter feeling a little bit of pain wouldn’t go amiss either… “I hope they don’t get the Ministry involved though…what if there’s a trial and evidence…I’ll have to talk about it…” he said, shaking his head slowly. He couldn’t imagine anything worse, reliving it would be just as bad as it happening again, he was sure. He’d thought about it so much, trying to sleep against the nightmarish memories filling his mind at every moment. He was sure he was addicted to Pomfrey’s sleep tonics by now, being unable to cope without them.
“What else can I do...?” he asked softly, sad. Harry stared at him for a moment before making a decision.
“Charlie was exactly the same, darling, thin as a rake when he got home from school – they must not feed you enough! I’ll have to write to Dumbledore.”
“If Potter’s here, where’s Draco?” Pansy asked, watching Harry look over at them, then quickly head down the Gryffindor table.
Harry watched himself smack Draco hard across the face, then turn him around and shove his face into the wall with one hand. Reaching around Malfoy’s narrow waist with his other, he found the boy’s belt buckle and undid it slowly. He felt Draco gasp and try to struggle, pushing away from the wall.
“He laughed when I screamed…and he liked it when I bled…” Draco muttered, shaking his head. Harry felt like he was listening to someone’s nightmare, he truly couldn’t imagine anything worse. Draco sighed, like he’d been complaining about a lot of homework, something trivial, except his breath shook. “Every time I have sex, I’m being raped…I never want to. It’s my body, it…it’s cursed or… I need to have sex, or I start to feel…awful, like I’m dying, like I’m on fire. But I never want to. These…people I meet here, I don’t
“That bastard… Wait… he didn’t-…Crabbe didn’t…hurt you too, did he?” he asked, scared. Crabbe was at least double Draco’s size… Draco looked down again, shaking his head.
and couldn't think of anything worse than what he'd already been through. Other than Death or the Dementor's Kiss, she couldn't imagine inflicting more pain on him than he'd already suffered. The Draco Malfoy who had done all those awful things at school, and since, had been thoroughly kicked into submission. Now, they needed to act with more control and establish whether or not he was still a threat.
He felt rather than heard the slight intake of breath Draco took, shocked, then he leaned into the kiss, hesitantly moving his own lips against Blaise’s. Blaise vaguely heard the sound of a wand clattering on the stone floor but paid it no mind, overwhelmed with love and pride for the other boy.
“You may think something else occurred at the time. Something in Hogsmead, perhaps?” Snape said. Crabbe's mouth fell open, the sickle finally dropping.
"Why are the muffled?" Harry asked, frowning. Ron looked at him like he was the dumbest person alive.
At eleven o'clock, Harry excused himself from the Common Room, and headed to the Room. Draco arrived a few minutes after him, looking harassed, and thrust the letter he'd received that morning into Harry's hands.
time. They gave him a potion so he’d feel dizzy and not really notice – his body needs it, but he pretends he’s somewhere else.” he said, still so
“Some spells will last as long as the wand that cast it remains intact, even if its owner is dead. I've read about a few very rare spells that last forever, and there’s certainly ones where their
They arrived to find Madam Pomfrey eating at her desk, an almost finished plate of roast beef and trimmings in front of her as she read a book. She looked up with a start when the doors opened, her eyes widening further when she saw Draco.
"All they want is information." Harry added quickly, realising how this might sound to someone who had been through what Draco had clearly been through. He hadn't shared it with the others yet, what the bruises he'd seen meant, thinking it wasn't his to share. But maybe he should, if only to get Ron to be a bit nicer to him.
They stayed there, like that, for a while. Harry had no idea how long until he realised Draco had fallen asleep. His head was on Harry’s shoulder, his body curled up in his lap, fingers still idly holding Harry’s shirt where they’d previously been clutching it for dear life. Harry’s heart swelled unexpectedly when he saw Draco’s face, slightly pink and blotchy around his sore eyes, but so serene… He’d never seen anyone look so relaxed, it was wonderful to see after so much pain and sadness that had been there before.
"On the other hand… Draco is an intelligent person who knows that hurting people is wrong. He's hurt lots of people, killed countless - under duress, yes, but…-" she shook her head. "But, I mean,
They finished Potions and headed off for their lunch, where Harry was unable to stop himself watching Draco yet again from across the Great Hall. Blaise appeared to be trying to offer him a sandwich, but Malfoy wrinkled his nose at it and got up, leaving the room. Harry then watched Pansy and Blaise speak to each other, their faces worried, Blaise gesturing at the door Draco had exited from. Shit, Harry thought, if Draco’s friends started worrying about what was causing his change in behaviour then Draco might end up telling them what Harry had done, and then all hell would break loose.
Most of their stuff was packed away in the fabulously handy magical chest graciously loaned by Blaise's mother, including the furniture. Just the TV (they had fully embraced the Muggle lifestyle since Draco wasn't allowed to use magic) and the sofa bed remained, as well as a tea mug and plate each, a few books and research materials on the lonely chairless desk. They appeared in the almost empty living room, arms wrapped tight around each other.
Then Draco gave a very loud sniffle, his face crumbling, and he wrapped his arms around Blaise’s waist tightly, dropping his head onto Blaise's shoulder and sobbed his heart out. Blaise gave a small laugh, tears stinging his own eyes and cheeks, and hugged him back tightly, stroking his hair. “We’ll get through it, Draco…I’m here for you.” He promised softly, and they stood in that tight embrace, all alone in the middle of the Entrance Hall of Hogwarts, for as long as they could, before heading back down to the Common Room together.
“And finally, there will be a sorting that will take place after they arrive,” the chatter grew even louder this time, causing the Headmistress to finally cast a sonorous charm. “For those who have volunteered to serve as guides, do not worry. They might not necessarily be sorted into your house, as the results of the sorting may be unpredictable and unbalanced, so I will be providing you and your partners with charmed notebooks so you can communicate and reach one another from the different areas of the castle.”
Harry agreed and they both decided to check the lake since they already knew that there were students there and hoped she was among them. In hindsight, it might have been wiser to use the Mauraders Map to locate them, but Harry didn’t want to make the trip up the stairs just to come back down.
“That’s..nice,” Harry said, because what else was there to say. He was correct when he assumed there were new students, but he was more surprised to hear that some of them came back even after having to suffer under Death Eaters. “Wait, so what are you guys going to do?”
But Draco had no idea that someone messed up the food orders and they’re getting that sorted, so maybe it would be wiser to indulge him in more socializing.
However, he was stopped by a sudden yank on his arm, pulling him up until he was face to face with Harry, pressed against his bare chest. He must have taken off his shirt some time while Draco was sucking him off.
Harry had to stop himself from agreeing eagerly to the last comment, instead choosing to let out a huff of laughter as he followed the Slytherin into their bathroom.
you,” Harry emphasized, happy with the added heat that Draco was radiating now that they were close together. Draco blushed faintly, and Harry had come to the realization that he rather liked getting that reaction out of him. Perhaps he should do it more often. “Speaking of the party, we should probably head out soon if you want to make it in time.”
“Looks good,” Draco grinned satisfactorily before flopping down on his bed. Harry lied down as well so that they were side by side, their shoulders just barely touching. “And I would tomorrow, but I’m going out with Neville to Hogsmead.”
“And their partner is…. Neville Longbottom!” the Hat announced just moments after. Neville immediately stood up and smiled, ready to greet his partner for the next 5 or so months. He was one of the lucky ones, being assigned to someone in the same house while there were a fair few others who were in different houses.
“I hate you,” Harry grumbled, but found himself smiling at the sounds of Draco’s laughter. He watched him roll onto his back once again, matching Harry’s position, before pulling the blankets over both of them.
All boys present in the dorm had cheered triumphantly. They were about to discuss possible games they could play that wouldn’t be too heavy but also still help them get to know each other when a knock sounded from the door.
When he got back to the living room, Draco was back under the blankets, though not completely wrapped around him like they were a while ago, fiddling with his hands.
“Is this some sort of Gryffindor thing?” Malfoy asked. If Harry didn’t know any better, he would say that he was whinging. Thankfully he had enough self-preservation to not openly grin at the tone.
“Deal,” Harry felt a grin slide its way onto his face. He got to keep Draco and one of the few things that reminded him of his Godfather.
There were a few men and women who whistled in his direction and called him over, asking if he was interested, but Harry just politely shook his head and kept walking.
When he came back from the kitchen, Neville was gone. Probably going around to be a good host. This would have been great, if it weren’t for the fact that Pansy Parkinson now occupied the seat that Neville had evacuated.
“Alright, tell me what you’re up to,” Harry started, trying to ignore the fact that their faces were just inches apart.
“I thought you couldn’t be arsed to go,” Draco pondered out loud, looking at him with a raised eyebrow.
“Call in sick,” Draco shrugged into the mattress. “We finished up the case, anyway, and we’ve worked many hours overtime for it.”
“Later,” he confirmed, giving the other man another smile before they re-entered the classroom and took their seats.
They barely got to eat after the dancing, only able to grab a few bites during Ron and Blaise’s speeches. Any point after that was spent with the other guests and hopping from table to table, with the help of some alcohol, of course.
The game ended eventually, with everyone begging off one by one because they were starting to get tired.
“Harry?” She sounded a bit confused. “What are you doing up so early? I was half expecting you and Ron to sleep a bit more today.”
“If you’re referring to being the Undesirable #1 wizard, then I’m afraid to inform you that none of your children are such deviants,” Scorpius laughed.
“Sorry,” Harry said unapologetically with a soft smile,  still completely naked and exposed. There was another moment of silence, and Draco wasn’t sure of what to say to make the situation less tense.
“C’mon, I’m almost finished,” Harry whispered, pulling him to the front of the stage. Draco supposed he should’ve been thankful he wasn’t dragged onto the stage instead, happy to have the attention off him and back on Harry and the elves that accompanied him.
“Oh, nothing,” Neville flushed a bit once everyone’s eyes were focused on him. “I just… Okay, well I’m planning on asking someone out. I’m just not quite sure how to go about it yet.”
Draco lifted his head in question, looking to see what Harry was doing. As if sensing his movement, Harry looked up at him before giving him a smirk, sticking his tongue out and licking up the come that dripped out of Draco’s cock.
“I’m sure you’ll manage,” Harry replied breezily. “I mean, if it works, you’re going to have to teach me that trick after you show me.”
“A what?” Harry repeated blankly. “Did I hear you say ‘A Muggle Car’?” Please, for the love of Merlin, say that he misheard him.
“Are you sure you know what you’re doing?” Hermione asked him once he reached the Gryffindor table. Even if the Eight Years got their own dorm, they were still allowed to eat with their old housemates. Allowed being the word because others, very few others, would opt to eat with their friends from other houses.
He never realized that this was on one of his fairly used routes on the way home but, then again, he didn’t often take it and when he did, it was more likely because he wanted to take a stroll early in the morning.
“Assignment,” Harry shrugged and, at Draco’s - understandably - confused expression, he expounded, “Robards told me that you can’t keep coming late to work, so I’m here to pick you up.”
“I know,” he mumbled, curling his knees to his chest. “Neville said he was working on his date with Draco.”
Harry situated himself beside Draco and looked over at the strange, pinkish plants that were peeking out of the dirt.
“Really?” she asked, looking a bit taken back. “Oh, thank you, then. At least one of you is being reasonable”
Harry was vaguely aware that people have gone back to staring at them and that it looked like they were cuddling. They were, technically, but that wasn’t the point. They were given no choice but to play this game, technically. So instead of reacting to their strange looks, he tightened his hold around Mal-Draco while trying to ignore the rapid beating of his heart and the slight perspiration forming on his forehead.
“Mister Potter,” Narcissa Malfoy greeted him, opening the door a bit wider, but only for a fraction of a second. She quickly stepped in front of Blaise and Pansy, allowing them to narrow the gap once more. And once again, Harry was resisting the urge to pull out all of his hair.
“Thanks, Malfoy,” Ron beamed. He, out of all of them, took the longest to accept their friendships with the man, but once Malfoy realized the easiest way to reach him was Quidditch and food, it was smooth sailing from there.
His eyelashes were pressed against his high cheekbones, pale blond hair framing his face like a halo while his soft, pink lips rested in a small pout. Harry felt his heart stop and his cheeks heat up, momentarily debating the pros and cons of letting Draco sleep a bit longer.
Blaise knew when it was a bad day, seemed to be able to see it in his eyes, even if he was pretending it was a good day. He knew when to take Draco out of a situation, when to talk or touch and when to not. Blaise was his rock, his anchor. He didn't know if he loved Blaise, or if he was simply the only person he could stand the sight of. Either way, he was there and always close and warm and never hurt Draco.
“N-no… no problem…” he replied, before smiling. Draco frowned for a moment, confused, before he let out a soft laugh, and then they were both laughing, then kissing again. Harry removed himself from inside Draco, making them both gasp, and roll them over so he was on his back with Draco on top of him, legs still either side of Harry’s hips. Harry’s hands found Draco’s arse as they kissed, and then his fingers found the heat of his hole, leaking come and still twitching, the muscles soft and extremely inviting. It didn’t seem to matter that they were Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy, they were just bodies that wanted each other, chemicals in need of reactions.
“Well, go to the Hospital Wing if you need to.” He said, eyeing Draco in particular. “Potter, report to Mr Filch in his office after breakfast tomorrow. Draco, you will come here again. Just because you can’t be in the same room together doesn’t mean you escape punishment. Where are the lists of ingredients?”
It had been two weeks since Potter returned to normal school society, much to the Slytherins’, those in the know at least, outrage when Blaise woke up to darkness, his head aching from not enough sleep. He sighed and picked up his watch from the bedside table. He strained his eyes to see the slightly flowing face, finding the time to be 2.30 am. He groaned softly and sat up, putting his watch back and picking up his glass of water for a sip. As he drank, he glanced over at Draco's bed, his concern for his friend always heightened at night due to his constant nightmares. To his surprise, however, the bed opposite his own was empty. Blaise put his glass down and got out of his warm bed, padding over the Draco's bed in socked feet. Their dormitory was carpetted but the cold stone beneath always won out.
Hermione hadn't wanted to stop Ron attacking Draco, she hadn't felt that impulse, but she was glad when Harry did. She knew she had a vengeful streak inside her, ever since year 3 when Olivia Crisp called her the N-word on the playground, though neither of them really knew what it meant other than it was very mean to call a black person it. Hermione had put a frog in Olivia's book bag and had revelled in her screams. Magical life had been no exception, in fact making it easier and with more creativity; from deforming Marietta's face for betraying the DA, to blackmailing and keeping Rita Skeeter captive as a beetle for printing lies about them all.
The whole memory blurred after that, the agony making it difficult to recall, the sounds of another round distant. He could see that his companions had seen enough anyway. He would never be able to speak about such things, but he sensed that Granger at least had wanted some true proof.
He walked down the corridor with Dumbledore as if in a daze, discombobulated from being so isolated in one place. It was daylight, hence how bright it had been, but the light was strange, almost greenish beyond the diamond patterned windows.
"We need a good balance, not too obvious but good enough to get the message across. They're stupid, but not
The ache of his godfather’s absence in the vast house was still alive in Harry, as were many terrible things, but Lupin had shocked him by bequiething a portait of the two of them to Harry in his will. They were playing chess together in a garden under a beautiful cherry blossom tree, Sirius cheating at every opportunity and Lupin smiling good naturally, still winning.
Memory-Draco continued to hold the book tightly in both of his increasingly shaky hands, body tensing with every step of boots on the previously magnificent wooden floor. The house was rotting around them, neglected and filled with darkness, the Manor no longer his home.
“Yeah…just, you know, seeing you…like this… Being mistreated…” Draco pushed himself up on one arm at that, angry, though his face paled a little at the movement.
Later, Snape told Crabbe to stay behind after Potions. Goyle had frowned at him, Draco had gone pale and looked between Crabbe and Snape. Blaise had touched Draco's shoulder and made him leave with him, Crabbe thought maybe they were together now; they'd been spending a lot of time together since Draco left the Hospital Wing, plus the whole sharing a bed thing...
“We should head back, yeah?” he asked his friend, picking up the pretty little statue with a proud smile, shoving it in his pocket. He looked at Draco, frowning. “You alright?” he asked. Draco looked pretty awful, pale and shaky and clearly on the verge of tears. He nodded, clearing his throat and putting his Malfoy mask on.
“They don’t know.” he hissed back. “None of these stupid rumours are even close, they all think it was just a fight.” She sighed, looking tired. She’d barely slept that night, her imagination reeling with horrifying images of Draco being raped. “I told Goyle…but he won’t say anything…” he said. She nodded, knowing this to be true, and they didn’t talk for a while after that.
There are good days and bad days. Good days meant he can get out of bed, eat two or three meals without even thinking about chewing and swallowing. Good days let him talk and laugh and think about the future, do his homework and sleep through the night next to Blaise. Bad days stopped all of that. He could hardly open his eyes and stretch his legs without the sensation of true, debilitating dread and fear filling ever fibre of his being. Bad days could even start as good days, then something will happen that sent the good spiralling away like it was being flushed down a toilet, never to be seen again.
He felt trapped, knowing how this would end, how it always ended even if he wasn’t feeling the need for their company. It had happened a few times, despite his defensive and somewhat destructive magic. Whenever he hurt one, they hurt him back. They’d just decided they wanted to use him, practically carried him to the seventh floor and kept him there for hours. The most it ever did was reset the time he had before another attack hit him, but the experience was 1000 times worse when his body wasn’t begging for it. Then it was just
There was an audible intake of breath around the library, followed very quickly by a buzz of whispers. Like a field of crickets, Draco thought with a roll of his eyes. Harry was still grinning up at him, eyes sparkling with pride and… something. Draco didn't know, so he nodded once and returned to his friends, cheeks on fire. Pansy gave him a tiny round of applause and Blaise nudged his foot under the table, both grinning. Draco ignored them staunchly, concentrating very hard on his Arithmancy exercise. He felt hot and somehow weightless for the rest of the day, just thinking about Harry's eyes and smile trained solely on him.
"What? What do you mean?" Harry asked, ending the muffle spell, he and Hermione following at Ron's heels.
“It's alright, Draco, it's going to be ok, I promise…” Harry was saying, his voice sounding emotional too. “When this war is over...everything will be better. And I'm going to beat him...I have to…” he whispered, hugging Draco tighter and burying his face in Draco's shoulder. The blond was shocked to feel his shirt getting damp. He felt himself hug back, he was
"Baby?" He asked softly, his other hand brushing through his hair. Draco smiled at him and leaned up to kiss him properly.
“Where are we going, sir?” He asked after a few moments, vaguely registering their direction was aimed downstairs.
“Shut up, Potter...” Draco muttered with a very him eye roll, then sighed. “If...I require your assistance again...I might ask you to help me again. Do you have any coins on you?” he asked. Harry frowned slightly, not expecting this turn of events, and grabbed his trousers from where they’d been laid over the sofa. He pulled out a handful of coins, both muggle and wizarding, and showed them to Draco. The blond then selected one 10p and one sickle, waving away the rest. He then cast a spell over the both of them, Harry recognising it as the same spell Hermione had cast for the DA coins.
“Good answer. It's just gone 10 if you want breakfast, by the way.” He said before leaving. Blaise sighed, breakfast finished at 11 on Sundays. He woke Draco up with reluctance, wanting his friend to get enough sleep just as much as how pleasing he found his sleeping face. The blond looked confused as he blinked himself awake, then he seemed to recall the night's events and looked panicked.
“I just…wanted to make sure you’re ok…” Draco frowned, still staring at him. Harry sighed, deciding Draco would prefer him to be honest. “I was…worried about you. I
"Too many people...! The Room-" he cut himself of with a small sob, his knees buckling. Harry held him up, understanding what he meant, and hightailed it upstairs to the Room of Requirement as quickly as he could, practically carrying Draco.
"Draco!" Blaise cried, panicked by the intensity of his fighting, the volume of his begging and crying. His voice was strained and hoarse, just as it had been when he first greeted Blaise at the front door with a weak smile and nervous tug of his collar. "Draco, wake up!" He persisted, resisting the urge to hold him down to stop him hurting the both of them. He stepped away and lit the candles with his wand, vaguely concerned the house was being watched for illegal magical use. Probably why they didn't have house elves anymore. "Draco, it's me! It's Blaise!" Finally, he woke up, sitting up and away, back pressed against the wall. His eyes were wide as he looked around, then they rested on Blaise standing in the soft orange light, and relaxed, slumping slightly.
“I will ensure you won’t be blamed for this, Harry. It is Voldemort, and Voldemort alone, who is responsible for this. I only ask you continue with your Occlumency lessons and…stay away from Draco Malfoy.” He said the last part with definite pain in his voice, looking away from Harry for the first time. McGonagall was still having trouble meeting his eyes. Harry felt a wave of rage, wanting to shout at them that it wasn’t his fault, to stop making him feel like a rapist, but he forced it down, terrified the Monster would wake up. He wouldn’t put it past Snape to kill him at the moment, if he gave him any opportunity, even in front of Dumbledore.
They stood silently for a long time, the damp sea air making them all cold, each picturing the cycle over and over again. It was never ending.
“By the way,” Neville said, peaking his blond heat through at the last moment. “Take care of him, yeah?” then he left without waiting for his response.
“Just making sure,” Hermione said. “No need to give you excuses to stalk him this year. Surely you already have enough.”
“Oh great,” Ron scoffed from his seat beside Harry. “He’s already corrupted her. Has she forgotten everything they’ve done to us in the past years already?”
“I might be,” Neville said, tilting his head to the side, seemingly studying Harry. “But you’re right. I might also not be able to see him as much if I’m setting things up.”
Harry stripped off his shirt before stepping in, tilting his head carefully to make sure he didn’t wet his jeans before placing a towel over his shoulders before walking out.
He liked him, that much he was aware of. He also knew that he was pretty sure they’ve been flirting for the past week, ever since he unconsciously brushed his hair back when he was on top of him.
He did manage, though. Eventually. And when he turned around, he was surprised to see a pale figure standing in the doorway. He felt his jaw drop at the sight of his partner dressed in an over sized- overly fluffy sweater with a nice pair of trousers. His hair was still damp and messy from rubbing a towel over it, and his cheeks were slightly flushed, possibly from the heat of his shower.
“Look, Harry, you do you and I’ll continue ignoring him like I planned,” Ron said, bringing that argument to a halt. Harry hoped that Hermione would have a better shot at getting through to him now that they’ve both calmed down relatively.
“Maybe you ought to have asked the Headmistress,” Harry snorted. “It’s only the first day, anyway. They’ll probably just go over everything we need to learn before actual lessons start.”
“Come off it, mate,” Ron joined in on her teasing. “You’ll probably be too busy staring at him to even get a word out.”
“You wish,” Malfoy huffed, getting up from his spot. Parkinson squealed and clapped her hands from her spot next to where Malfoy had just abandoned his seat. “Do feel free to back out any time you can't handle it, Potter.”
“Ever since I’ve heard about you two at Hogwarts during our last year, really,” Narcissa replied, completely disregarding her son.
Malfoy nodded slightly before walking out and shutting the door behind him. “Why was Malfoy in the kitchens?” Harry wondered aloud once he was sure the man in question was far from range.
“I don’t either,” he admitted, bringing a hand up to brush his thumb over his boyfriend’s cheek. He gave him a lingering kiss, restraining himself from extending it as they were still at work.
Now, however, he was trudging through one of the back Alleys in the city in West Central London; a shortcut to his apartment that was in a Wizarding district- surrounded by several Muggle areas as well.
His dancing wasn’t horrible, Draco supposed, before bursting out into loud laughter, along with their friends.
The hall started emptying out in small groups, and Hermione looked rather put out by the fact that she’d be missing class for the day since she was accepted as one of the guides.
“Actually, I did a study on that when I went to Castelobruxo in my 5th year!” Draco explained, his gray eyes lighting up with excitement.
For all he knew, someone could be getting seriously injured. He knew that this type of work came with its risks, and he wouldn’t be able to sleep comfortable knowing that something seriously wrong might have just happened as he forced himself to walk by.
“Your jokes get worse with age,” Albus sighed, earning a nod of agreement from Scorpius. “You wish you aged like fine wine.”
It sounded quite strange, wanting to separate him from the rest of the group, but maybe it’s because they might slip and tell each other everything. Harry thought that Neville would prefer having their help in this, but apparently not so much.
“I could trip and you would say it’s because of my breathing,” Draco huffed, still feeling fussy about the wedding arch. It wasn’t even that bad, if Harry may say so himself. Just a few choice of odd flowers, no harm.
“But it’s different,” Harry could hear the pout in his tone. “I kind of want to see what’s inside, too.”
Harry tried, he really did, to not feel resentful for the interruption. He and Draco were actually getting somewhere, and he wanted to know what the blond was about to say, except Draco nodded and looked at Harry, a silent question of whether or not he was going to follow suit.
“Oh really?” A blond eyebrow was raised. “And how would you do that? Unless you plan on dressing up like Santa and dancing with a bunch of elves dressed like...Christmas elves, I don’t see how you could make it any more eventful.”
“Of course not,” Sofia managed to sputter out before forcing herself to calm down. “Draco, going after your
“Just a few more minutes,” Draco sighed contently, his eyes fluttering to a close. “They can wait a while. I don’t think I can be arsed to get out of this comfortable position,” he murmured drowsily, reusing Harry’s excuse from awhile ago.
“When I ring the bell, all of you should come back here,” The Malfoy matriarch commanded. “Then we can have snacks.”
She smiled back and opened her mouth to say something else but a pair of arms wrapping around him made her cut off.
“Harry!” Draco laughed, trying to squirm away, but Harry held him down by the hips so he couldn’t escape. He could feel Harry shake with silent laughter against his body, mouth pressed against his skin.
“Hey, Draco?” Harry asked after a beat of silence. Really, Draco just wanted to go to sleep. He was spent.
Classes were more unruly than normal that day. There were times wherein students who were giving tours would pass by, easily distracting the class as they stared at the Beauxbatons students who curiously peered into their classrooms.
“Hey!” Harry protested, before a weird, prickling feeling began at the back of his head. Like he was forgetting something.
“You’re supposed to pay the company for a subscription, and then they supply cable to our house,” Harry explained, doing his best to be patient once again. He needed to remind himself that Draco was making an effort, at least.
As if to further his point, Zabini walked in with Theo trailing behind him, both looking as if they were ready to go to sleep.
“Excited to get the rat’s nest off your own head too, are you?’ Draco teased lightly, leaving Harry slightly relieved that he didn’t think too hard on his disappointed tone, or he didn’t notice it. “Would it be alright if I did it after dinner, then?”
“I can’t believe you guys left me!” Ron’s voice sounded through the gradually filling Great Hall. “Eating! Without me! I’m starved,” he instantly settled down next to Hermione and began shoveling food onto his plate.
“Mate, we’re friends and I’m pretty sure you weren’t chugging down hard ale when we were 11,” Dean rolled his eyes.
“Tsk,” Harry smirked, placing a kiss on the spot between his thigh and his bollocks. “Patience, love. I’m just making sure that you’re nice and stretched for when I fuck you.”
“No argument there,” Harry eventually dragged himself out of bed, but not without the dramatics of groaning like he was about to take the walk to death, before standing behind his boyfriend and burying his face in his neck.
“I don’t want to go,” Harry groaned into his pillow. “I don’t want to socialize and you can’t make me.”
"Oh my, they’ve heard us quarrel, darling,” he sighed dramatically, covering half of his face in faux embarrassment. “We do sincerely apologize, we’re normally much better than this.”
“No,” Malfoy shut him down, but Harry refused to let himself feel too disappointed. He knew it was coming. “I’ll- And you have no problem with what I’m doing? That I'm a whore?”
Shaking his head, Harry pulled himself off the bed. He didn’t want to assume and get his hopes up over nothing. Instead, he made his way to the kitchen and began setting up their breakfast as he’d been doing for the past few weeks.
Yeah, they spent 3 years engaged, much to the surprise of their friends, who were somewhat expecting them to get married right away given how long they’ve waited for each other. But no, they wanted to take more time for themselves and do things they didn’t get to do when they were playing the game, not wanting to push the other too far. Like travelling, or something.
Harry shook his head and kissed him on the cheek. It was private moments like this that he loved, where even if there was nobody present, they still acted like a real couple. Like for a moment, Harry could pretend it wasn’t just for a game and Draco really was his.
The only thing left to check was the bedroom. The fact that he was invading one of Draco’s most private places was enough to make him hesitate once he stood outside the closed door, hands raised halfway before he could knock.
“Draco,” Harry said kindly, “It’s normal. Sex isn’t always graceful and clean. I mean, there are weird sounds too.”
“Look, I’m not saying it’s wrong to want to keep him in your life,” she said, “But I want you to take care of yourself. If you can’t handle it, there’s nothing wrong with stepping away for a while.”
“Er, we…” Harry scrambled to string together a reasonable excuse, a warmth creeping up from his neck.
“I know that,” Draco snapped with a weak glare. “I even watched Muggle movies and those short films on the internet.”
Without waiting for a response, he pulled himself back up until they were face-to-face, his expression mischievous. He inched his face closer, making it appear as though he was leaning in for a kiss, before turning his head at the last second, brushing his lips against the shell of Draco’s ear.
“Would it be alright if we did it in the Slytherin dorms?” Draco asked, his gray eyes peering at him through the blond strands of his hair. “Unless it’s inconvenient of course and you’d prefer your dorms but I-”
“‘Aside from that,’ Draco added, and Harry’s gaze immediately shifted to the Slytherin. “Since they didn’t exactly receive a proper introduction to the school, the Prefects were given a list of each new student so they could keep an eye on them. Answer any questions they might  have or help them keep up with classes, in case there are lessons they didn’t learn before and might need in the following years.”
“A party?” Harry asked. “Like with the Professors and everything?” He felt rather skeptical about how a bunch of teenagers and alcohol would mix with having their professors around. Not well, he surmised.
It wasn’t like they were bloody dating. Even the thought made him shudder, and yet he couldn’t wrap his head around why those two were so bloody inseparable.
They settled into a comfortable silence, Draco lifting his glass to take another sip. After a few more seconds, Harry decided to speak up again.
“That’ll do,” Hermione sighed, giving them smiles. “Now shoo. I have to meet with the other guides and you both have to make it to first period. Remember to take notes!”
“Harry, stop moping and get ready,” Hermione chided as she breezed through Grimmauld Place, picking up his haphazardly strewn clothes that essentially looked to be serving as his floorboard.
“S’charmed,” Draco mumbled, apparently also in a similar state. “So that it’s easy to fall asleep and stay asleep.”
“I don’t think so,” Blaise laughed. Draco hadn’t even realized he arrived, but his grip was strong enough to prohibit Draco from escaping. Not to mention the rest of their friends making some sort of barrier around him so he couldn’t escape.
“Right...” Draco said, uncertain, before following Harry. The Gryffindor could feel Ron glaring holes into the side of his head, but he did his best to ignore it. No, if Ron didn’t want to talk to Draco, then that was his problem. Harry knew apologizing was the right thing to do.
He took no offense to that and gladly let her get to work, but offered the help of Bill Weasley when it came to the curses. While he knew that she knew what she was doing, having grown up there, he didn’t want her to accidentally hurt herself while getting rid of cursed family heirlooms. She accepted, of course, and he told her she could take whatever she wanted from the house if she ever found anything.
“Nope,” Draco said, slightly pouting into his drink. “I’ll never hear the end of it if I do. Besides, I won’t be seeing her until January if I skip out.”
“Then explain why all the girls at the Slytherin and Ravenclaw table are trying to lean in and join his conversations,” Ron sneered. “He’s probably put some kind of charm on himself so other people would forget what family he comes from.”
“Are you alright?” he heard a soft voice ask him. On his left appeared Draco Malfoy, who he didn’t realize had been standing there. Merlin, how long had he been there?
“Because it annoys you,” Draco mumbled into his pillow. “I’ll get ready when you get out of my room.”
“You do what you want,” Ron said eventually. “But if you think I’m going anywhere near him, you’re wrong.”
Harry had forgotten that he and Hermione were supposed to do that. “Oh,” he mumbled, trying not to sound too disappointed. “It’s alright, I’m sure I can figure it out on my own.”
Sighing heavily as he gave the password, he entered the dorms and headed straight to bed, not bothering to set an alarm for when Hermione’s class was supposed to end so they could get onto revising.
“Honestly,” Draco huffed. “You’re like a dog.” That did not discourage him, however, from continuing. Instead, his touches became more gentle and soft- or rather, that’s how it felt to Harry.
to do it." He whispered, teeth chattering and lips pale despite the flush in his cheeks. Harry took a deep breath and lay down beside Draco, a little awkward, the blond boy watching him through the silver slits of his almost-closed eyes.
“Thank you, Harry…” he said. Harry stared at him, his legs shaking and softening, overly sensitive cock still inside Draco.
Draco stared at him, horror struck, then around like he wa trying to find an escape route. Slowly, he realised he was trapped, and seemed to shrink, his eyes going down as he pressed himself into the wall, even slumping slightly, defeated. It felt like a monster, something evil, stirring in his chest, waking up.
“Yes...I had fun too. Thank you, Potter...for everything. And, um, keep that coin on hand, alright?” he said. Harry grinned and nodded, holding it up to show him. A ghost of a smile appeared on Draco's pale face, before he turned away quickly to pull his shoes on.
“Malfoy? What was this argument about?” he asked. Draco looked at him, struggling to stay composed, and forced himself to straighten up, wearing the Malfoy mask as best he could.
"Let's go, quickly." Pansy said, leading the way. Blaise remained on Draco's other side, and an unsure Ron and Hermione brought up the rear. They made their escape all the way up to the 7th floor, avoiding other students and hiding whenever a teacher or ghost appeared. It wasn't a restricted time to be up and about yet but they didn't want to be confronted while Draco was so delicate and in such unlikely company.
“But…” Harry trailed off, not really wanting to spoil his boyfriend’s mood. “You don’t know how to drive, much less have a licence.”
And with that, they, too, had left him. When he looked around, he realized that clouds had formed over the school grounds and it was possible that it was going to rain soon, so he’d best head back to the castle as well.
“I’ll pay for your time,” Harry pushed, not sure of why he was insisting. Anyhow, he felt that it was too late to take it back, so he continued. “Or even move in with me after this, you know?”
“Perhaps I was just looking for an opportunity to see how long my magic trick would hold up,” Malfoy responded haughtily, and Harry nearly choked on his own spit. Then, in a sudden bout of bravery, he surged forward and pressed his lips against Malfoy’s soft, pink ones. He vaguely heard the surprised gasp escape the other man’s throat, but he was more focused on the way Malfoy felt against his body; how it just felt so right to be pressed against him and how their bodies fit together.
“Please give it up for our voluntary performances tonight,” a voice sounded from somewhere, cutting Draco off from his rant. “First we have Harry Potter, along with the House Elves of Hogwarts.”
Harry could sense Ron trying to fight back a glare as he stood and made his way around the table, allowing booth Hermione and Draco to take a seat in front of them, the latter sitting down with an easy grace that could make heads turn.
Draco marched into their living room which they had been sharing for about 5 months now. Harry, slightly exasperated at being disturbed from his knitting, looked at his boyfriend whom he had been seeing for about 4 years now. It was strange, he’ll admit, how they ended up together, but he doesn’t regret it. What started out as a bunch of awkward encounters, to silent confiding and conversations, turned into a relationship.
“Great,” Draco sighed, “Because Muggles are really hard to do business with.” And with that, Harry broke into chuckles again, holding the blond closer, and that’s how they fell asleep. With no cable, a car with a flat tire parked outside, and random staple holes decorating their walls.
