A short while later, the fort was finally set up and Draco was starving.
“Move your hand up too,” Draco said, reaching to pull Harry’d hand back up to his hip instead of where it was currently resting a little too low. By the smug smile Harry gave him, he had a feeling it was on purpose.
"What-" Harry began, suddenly confused.
"When you put it like that, I suppose you're right," Harry said thoughtfully.
"Sure, I don't mind. Will Pansy and Zabini join us?"
"I'm excited to see the fireworks and all, but I hope they're fast," Ron whispered to Harry and Hermione and they laughed a bit.
"All that over a book?"
"How about everyone else?" Draco said, "Maybe we can try to figure out a pattern."
"Alright, I dare you to use your best pick up line on Draco here," Pansy said, still struggling with Draco. Draco paused though at her words and looked at her with an expression of barely disguised horror.
Everyone was silent for a moment as they all seemed to take in exactly what that meant, waiting for someone to break the silence.
With that they headed out towards Hogsmeade. At first it was a bit awkward finding something to talk about as they hadn't really hung out together outside of the green house before, but it slowly became easier and by the time they arrived in Hogsmeade Neville was clutching his sides with laughter.
"Your brother didn't care in the slightest. I don't think they will either," Luna said, placing an arm around Ginny's shoulder as they stared down at a small envelope that sat on the bed.
"You can borrow mine when I'm done with it if you'd like."
Harry suddenly shivered for a whole other reason.
"What are the odds you'll kiss the person sitting to your left?"
"I'll be fine, Draco," Harry laughed, and Draco turned to leave.
The day had come for Harry, Hermione, and Ron to get back on the train for their eighth year at Hogwarts, something that Harry was both excited for and dreading all at once. For one, Harry didn't think he'd ever be returning and that thought made him sad, but it also meant coming back to people who were sure to gawk at him.
Finally it came to a stop in front of Hermione. "Sorry Ron, looks like I've gotta kiss your girl."
“Almost 10:30,” Draco said. They were silent a moment, not having moved away from each other yet and Harry’s hand had slipped lower again. Draco was sure he was doing that on purpose. His own dropped down to Harry’s elbow, tugging him foreward to meet him in an open-mouthed kiss.
"Malfoy, stop skirting around it. You know what I mean."
Draco started to scissor his fingers then, trying to stretch him out as best he could before adding a third and watching Harry shudder. Harry wasn't sure if he liked it or not and was trying to decide when Draco's fingers brushed against a bundle of nerves inside of him and he decided he liked it very much. Harry's head fell against Draco's shoulder as he moaned and Draco hit that spot again. Harry was sure that if Draco kept at it he'd come again before he was even inside him and quickly grabbed Draco's hand to stop him. "I'm going to come if you keep doing that," Harry breathed, "I don't want to come until you're inside me."
Then it all came rushing back.
“Oh?” Draco looked apprehensive.
“The pleasure is mine.” Draco shot Harry a quizzical look. He hadn’t expected such a powerful reaction from the elf.
The entire Wizengamot erupted into cries of shock and outrage. The roar of their voices gave Draco a headache. The Minister had to use the sonorous charm for the second time that day to call everyone to order. When at long last everyone was silent he resumed his seat at the high table.
No complicated feelings. Just pure lust.
The Wizengamot collectively gasped at the evidence of the damage Harry had caused.
“I’m afraid we owe you a rather large apology, Miss Granger.” His mother said softly. “I am truly sorry for not stopping my sister-”
Any conversation relating to Malfoy ceased as the old dorm mates greeted each other. It was always nice to catch up with the boys, but for whatever reason, his thoughts kept straying back to those haunting silver eyes and permanent scowl. The more he considered Ron’s ludicrous idea the more Harry started to think that maybe he was right. Malfoy had mentioned that he didn’t have any friends other than Pansy. In the few weeks since they had dinner he was sure that couldn’t have changed much. Other than Hermione, of course. She had practically leaped at the chance to mend that bridge. How was he supposed to invite Malfoy to lunch without it being weird?
“Oi, I don’t need you two ganging up on me.” He cried in mock outrage.
Her violet eyes drilled into him until Draco sighed and gave in with poor grace.
He pushed himself off of the dusty carpet and left without bothering to look at Dumbledore's portrait. He didn’t want to see those pale blue eyes x-ray him one last time. He let the office door slam shut behind him and raced down the spiral staircase. He couldn’t bear to stand still.
Thank you to my beta readers SandZhark and Precious Baby Puff Ari! They unanimously decided this chapter was good to post after their first read-through. I suspect they were just excited over the content, so any mistakes are my own. If you see any let me know in the comments below so I can fix them!
“What is there to talk about?” Harry grumbled evasively, sticking his hands in his pockets in an effort to resist the urge to hex them for simply trying to be good friends.
“Come on, our class is through here.” Harry pulled him into the brightly lit room.
“I did.”
“Kreacher knows better than to wait up for you. You is out late lots more than you is home at a proper hour.” The elf rolled his eyes and Draco almost had a stroke.
"Merlin’s beard, it's wonderful to finally meet you." Andromeda laughed breathlessly before letting him go. "You look extraordinarily like your mother. Except for your eyes." She placed her hand on Draco’s cheek and gently ran her thumb across his cheekbone. "You have your father's eyes."
He wanted to run to him. He wanted to be the one George was comforting. He wanted to be told to stay, that he was loved and needed and desired. That he didn’t have to die. He wanted so badly to reveal himself and give George one last kiss, but he would only stop him from doing what needed to be done. He pressed on, leaving George behind. This was a trip he had to make alone.
“Can Take Dating Two Weasleys.” Fred glared at Ron before continuing. “If there is anything we can do to help, you need to trust that The Saviour of My Heart, and the Wizarding World, will let us know. Alright?”
"Save it." Without another word, Theo walked out of his room and slammed Draco’s door behind him.
“I can’t... “ Draco looked conflicted. “I don’t really do...casual.”
“Or to bring a gift? It’s a housewarming party, Harry. It’s not like it’s the end of the world.” She sighed as she led him into some name brand store he was certain would be overpriced.
If you've stuck with me this long, I appreciate you with all of my heart!
"What's wrong?" She asked softly and Draco wrapped his arms around her shoulders.
“Here, Harry. Let me help you.” A familiar voice floated towards him and he smiled as Luna Lovegood slowly came into focus.
Ron moved closer, wrapping his arm around Harry’s shoulders and he let him pull him off of Fred.
“Oh yes, what was it called? The Black Center?” His mother chimed.
“I hated being locked away and cut off from the world every summer. It was horrible, even when it was only for a month at a time. Coming back to Hogwarts always felt like...I don’t know, it was just a huge relief. Malfoy doesn't have that, there’s no Hogwarts for him to go back to. So I figured maybe a Slytherin night out would be good for him.” He was tearing a napkin to shreds while he talked, a telltale sign that he didn’t want to deal with whatever emotions he was feeling.
“We could head back on foot. By the time we get back to the party the excitement over finding me will have died down.” Harry suggested.
They walked to the alley in silence and Harry wondered vaguely if Draco thought he was being rude. He was, wasn't he? He was going to drive Draco away too if he kept this up. Harry got lost in the implications of his behavior pushing Draco away and struggled to breathe as the panic slowly took over.
“Will do.” Harry chuckled, grabbing his things and rushing out of the cubicles before Zach could change their mind.
“What’s the catch?”
“I’ll be damned.” Draco clutched the book like it was a lifeline, devouring the information hidden within its pages.
A sharp stab to the heart made him gasp.
Without another word she carried the tea tray to the table and sat down, pouring for two. Draco stared after her numbly for a moment before following and taking the chair directly across from her.
"Absolutely nothing is wrong with you. Everything that you're feeling is valid, yeah?  That doesn't mean that it's all true."
"Well then, thank you." Harry held the front door open for him.
Harry didn’t hear the shouted replies. He could only see Fred and George. He wanted to run to them, tell him he loved them- but their need for anonymity kept him in place. When Fred caught his eye it felt as if the world had stopped turning. Before Harry could so much as catch his breath, George and Fred were both in front of him. Fred grabbed him first, crashing his lips onto his and Harry didn’t care. He didn’t care about the audience they had, he didn’t care that Ron and Hermione were right there, all he cared about was pressing himself into Fred as close as physically possible.
“No, it’s fine. It’s good, actually, because I know Pansy is trying to get on better with him, so I might as well start too.” When Hermione gave him a disbelieving glare he sighed. “Look, we may never be friends, but it would be nice if our first instinct when we see each other isn’t to draw our wands.” Draco said bracingly.
“Well, maybe you should. If you both can handle being friends with me and Pansy, you can handle being friends with each other.” She smiled encouragingly and then grabbed a sleeve of cups and walked back to the others.
Harry tugged at his shirt nervously, frowning at his reflection. He wasn’t entirely sure why he suddenly cared about what he wore. Maybe shopping with Hermione the other day had shamed some semblance of fashion sense into him. Well, if a clean Radiohead t-shirt and his nicest pair of jeans counted as fashion sense.
“I don’t-! That’s not- we didn’t,” He looked around the room helplessly for a moment before meeting Draco’s curious gaze. “We could go out for breakfast and avoid her?”
“It’s Ron’s dad, he’s been attacked by a giant snake. It’s bad, he’s bleeding everywhere. This is serious! I saw it happen.” Harry pleaded with her to understand him when she made eye contact.
He normally would not have told his father about his mortifying inability to enter a room in his own house, but their relationship had changed since the war ended. Still, he braced for the ridicule he had come to expect in years past.
“We figured your favorite things-” Fed started after giving him one more quick peck.
“Am I to understand that you will be speaking in their defense, then?” A tall, thin witch in the very last row asked.
Draco braced for the onslaught of ‘purebloods aren’t gay’ and ‘you need to marry and produce an heir’ lectures but instead his parents just looked at him with fond amusement.
“That’s only because we were with the girls and his parents. If I just waltzed up to him on his own I’m sure he’d hex me in half a second.”
“Later then.” Pansy snipped, leaving him no choice in the matter. Draco sighed as the room filled with the sound of his friends' excited laughter.
“Of course, sweetheart. I know that one was always your favorite.” His mother looked pleased. “I thought your home could use a bit of the familial touch.”
He really wished his heart would stop beating so erratically. Surely everyone at the table must be able to hear it.
Lucius made a strangled cry and she made eye contact with him. Blue held silver until he seemed to understand what she was trying to communicate. It wasn’t his fault. She did not hold him responsible for the atrocities she suffered in his stead.
Voices reached them from down below but Harry didn’t care. He only had eyes for Draco. He barely even registered that they seemed to be counting down.
"Alright?" Sirius arched an eyebrow at him.
He didn’t want to go back to his friends and pretend to be fine. He didn’t want to return to reality. He just wanted to stay in this small bubble of theirs forever. His head and his heart didn’t seem to hurt as much when Fred and George were there.
Draco rolled over and glared at the sunlight that was streaming through his bedroom window. It was much too bright for his liking. He was about to pull the covers over his head and go back to sleep when a jolt of excitement struck him like lightning.
“I know, I just- it’s embarrassing.”
“Alright.” Draco shrugged, handing the token back. “Now what is the point of this...game?”
"What happened?" Draco frowned, reading correctly into Harry’s tone.
“Aha! I knew it!” Harry crowed.
“Thanks.” He snorted and rolled his eyes, giving Draco a quick kiss as he crossed the threshold.
“Why not?”
“Thank you! I was properly shocked when I opened my present.” Parkinson was positively glowing. Harry had never noticed how pretty she was before. Being in love seemed to suit her.
“Harry…. The world isn’t divided into good people and Death Eaters. We all have a mixture of light and dark within us, fighting to break free. It is what we choose to act on that counts."
“Then I don’t need to know right now.” Draco smiled, laying back on the blanket and looking at the ocean. “I love living here. I don’t think I will ever get tired of this view.”
“He wouldn’t have let Draco live. Even if he did he would have made his life miserable- he would have made everyone's life miserable. He wanted to commit genocide against all of the muggleborns and halfbloods. Once I was free from his control I did everything in my power to bring him down.”
“Can you tell me why she wants you removed from the premises?” He asked sternly.
“Harry, I promise you that you do not have to go through this alone.” Draco placed a slender finger under his chin and forced him to meet his gaze. “I am here for you no matter what, alright?” When Harry nodded every so slightly he went back to massaging his shoulders. “Besides, my elaborate jokes are not this well planned out. You would have caught me out and kicked my arse into next week by now.”
“That doesn’t explain why she would use an unforgivable curse on a student.” The same witch snorted derisively.
A night out with his friends seemed to have been good for him. The unrelenting darkness was still there, hovering ominously, but it felt a lot more manageable with his old dormmates and his new boyfriend all getting along.
“I’m working on it.” He sighed.
The conversation flowed easily as Neville brought them news from Hogwarts. It was almost disturbing how much intel being the Herbology professor brought him. They had barely finished laughing about McGonagall swearing like a sailor in the staff room when Seamus launched into a convoluted but thrilling tale about the time he accidentally blew up his boss’s desk in a prank gone wrong.
"Hey, guys." Harry greeted everyone briskly before turning to face Draco. "You all know my boyfriend, Draco."
This sparked a rather spirited debate and they fell into the familiar patterns of their complex and unique friendship. They discussed all of the intricacies of Draco working in the gallery in between joking and poking fun at one another. It was almost like old times. Draco was so excited to be working that he almost forgot to whine about Harry, which did not escape Pansy’s notice.
“No, you’re being rash and reckless as usual. If it’s alright with you, I’d like to be on the same page here. This is over a decade’s worth of careful consideration on my part whereas you’ve thought about this for a mere seven weeks.” Draco said in an agitated rush.
“Of course not.” Harry smiled at some private joke. “Do you want to try some muggle fast food?”
The least he could do is make sure that they did not suffer alone. He turned his attention to the entrance to the courtroom as the door opened. A panel of roughly fifty witches and wizards in plum-colored robes filed in and took their seats in the stands. The entire Wizengamot acknowledged Harry with either a quick nod or a friendly wave and he marveled at how incredibly different it was from his last time in this courtroom.
“Fine.” Draco scowled, wrapping his hands around the glass reluctantly. “I’ll drink it, but I won't like it.”
She had to find her.
“You should have thought about that before telling Pansy you would, then.” She rolled her eyes at him.
“Hey!” Pansy grabbed his arm and pulled him off to the side while he was making a snack plate for himself.
“That’s all anyone can ever ask of you.” Bill said warmly, blue eyes sparkling in the firelight. “I’m proud of you for not giving up. I know this past year hasn’t exactly been a picnic.”
“He is.” Draco blushed.
“I accept the charges.” Narcissa said cooly, presenting as unruffled and dignified.
“You like him though.” It wasn’t a question.
"How do you plan to do that?" Draco laughed.
“I’m sorry.” Harry tried to stifle his laughter. “The Elite Three are powerful bloodlines.”
“It’s alright, I don’t mind. I just never pegged you for a cat person.” Harry scratched the precious kitty behind the ears and her purring intensified.
"So are you two still together?"
“You started painting after the war?” Harry asked him as soon as he walked back into the living room. He was standing with his back to Draco, studying his most recent painting. It was still drying on the easel.
Somethings never change.
“Fair enough. That doesn't negate the fact that when you realized that he had made horcruxes, you helped me destroy the diadem and you succeeded in killing the snake, making it possible for him to even die in the first place. Then, to top it all off, you dueled your own aunt to save three of my best friends-”
“Good, maybe you can help me reign in my chaos then.” Harry snorted, joining Draco in the middle of the living room. “Ready to leave?”
“Then there is no harm in asking.”
“I’m sure Harry wouldn’t mind adding you as part-owner of the Black vaults if you asked.” Pansy set down her cup delicately, fully aware she was poking a sleeping bear.
Repeat.
His heart broke for the Malfoys. He didn’t know what they had done to earn the Dark Lord’s ire, but he was certain it didn’t warrant that.
“Thank you.” Draco leaned his head against Harry’s shoulder, lacing their fingers together.
“You would.” Fred sniffed.
“I guess that would have to be Malfoy, then.” He shrugged.
“Supposedly the writer is some up and coming protege and the big boys from the big city are taking notice.” Draco took perverse joy in Pansy’s jealous expression.
“What did you want to talk about, Potter?” Draco sighed impatiently.
“What a bint,” Harry growled. “I’m sorry, Nev.”
“Here, I found this buried deep within the Black Archives. After I read through your family's books it made me curious.” Harry pulled out an ancient, black leather-bound book from his pocket and unshrunk it. “If you’ll reference the Genealogy Records from two centuries ago, you will find that the Peverell name died out because Quintus Peverelle never produced a male heir.” Harry opened it to the page he had marked before handing it over to Draco. “His daughter Temperance, however, married Cyrus Potter and thus continued the Peverelle bloodline, but not the name. The only reason this was even recorded in the Black Archives is that, during that same century, Dorea Black married Charlus Potter- therefore making the Potter bloodline important to them during that time.”
"You’ve also been downright chipper lately. It’s weird.” Zach shot him a sharp look before pulling the case folder closer and starting to fill out the required forms. “There is definitely something going on with you. So spill.”
"It was Malfoy," He muttered darkly, pulling away from Hermione when he could breathe without it hurting "he stepped on my nose."
“You what?” Ron challenged. When Harry stayed silent his face hardened. “I’ve had enough of this.”
"Who's this, then?" Seamus stared unashamedly at the newcomers.
“He said it wouldn’t hurt. He said he didn’t feel a thing.” Draco’s voice faltered on the last word.
"You two are so stupid!" she stamped her foot on the ground, tears spilling unashamedly down her cheeks. Before either of them could stop her she had enveloped them both in a hug and dashed away, wiping at her face angrily.
Maybe Harry just needed some time. He should take the night to think it over.
“Ma’am, please calm down. Can you point out the two that are giving you trouble?” He said in a bored voice.
“He didn’t exactly fight fair either,” Sirius growled. “Of course you didn’t see his glory days.”
Draco was standing in the doorway, looking uncertain.
Draco's heart felt as if it were about to fly right out of his chest. By the time he had caught his breath to reply Harry was gone. He stared at the empty door frame for a moment, replaying that last sentence in his mind over and over. He found he quite liked it when Harry was possessive.
“Is that it, then? Ravenclaw’s lost diadem?” He said instead and he kicked himself internally. What an idiotic thing to say in this situation!
“So, I’ve got to ask. What’s with the bowtie?” Harry grinned before taking a long pull from the bottle and trying to hand it back, but Draco shook his head. He placed it in the sand between them, which suited Draco just fine.
“Who is the she-snake?” Percy asked curiously.
“You can smell it too?” Draco asked before he could stop himself.
“I do not.” He said slowly. That was perhaps the hardest truth to voice. “I quite agree with my son, none of the marked should be allowed to walk free.”
“For Merlin’s sake,” Draco cut him off before closing the distance between them in three short strides “do you ever shut up?”
That was it then.
“Oh, but aren’t you glad I’m not your healer anymore?” He said icily and Harry began to understand why Draco always seemed so defensive.
Harry shot him a cheeky wink as they approached and Ron barely managed to refrain from rolling his eyes. He inclined his head towards Draco in greeting as they slid into the end of the booth next to him.
“Tough break.” Dean patted him sympathetically on the back.
It worked. He quickly vanished the molded bits of soggy root and continued on his way. At long last, the tunnel started sloping upwards and he could see faint light filtering down from an oddly shaped exit hole. He scrambled up it, desperate to feel the wind on his face.
“Yes, yes! Come here, Draco.” His aunt Bella sounded beside herself.  “You went to school with him, tell us- is this the Potter boy?”
She sat back in surprise when a waitress dropped off her favorite latte with a smooth wink before disappearing back behind the counter.
“Are you sure?”
“I don’t.” He whispered before he could stop himself. He grit his teeth, deciding to own it rather than cover it up. He would soon be dead so where was the harm in Dumbledore knowing the truth? “I don’t want to kill you. But I have to, or more people will die.”
“And there is our hour. Time’s up.” Draco was staring at the ornate clock on his wall with a twisted expression. “I am no longer your stand in healer.”
Draco looked mighty pleased at that and Harry realized it was probably too soon in the relationship to be brandying about implicit trust like that. Draco seemed the polar opposite of upset though, so Harry tried to not let it worry him.
“Everything alright?” Madame Juliette gave him a concerned frown.
"The best part of today was that I got to spend it with you."
Harry watched her go with some amusement. At least she had tried to be professional. He heaved a weary sigh and prepared himself for the usual “But you’re Harry Potter!” and “Oh I am so grateful to you, you saved my second cousin's sister’s boyfriend's third Aunt twice removed from being killed by You-Know-Who” preliminaries. He pushed open the door and froze.
“There isn’t a spell for that, but hold on-” She grabbed her green beaded bag and Harry smiled at the fact that she still used it. “I have some eye cream to reduce puffiness and some concealer and foundation to cover those up.”
“I appreciate your sympathy, Mr. Potter, but there is no use in pursuing the issue. It isn’t the bigotry of just one official. It’s the attitude of the vast majority of Wizarding Britain as a whole. Confronting one person isn’t going to help very much in the grand scheme of things, it’s just an unnecessary headache.” His father sounded resigned.
“Happy to help.” The man took it first, giving him a quick firm shake before stepping back.
“Are you as worried about him as I am?” She looked over at Ron.
“Of course not, Harry. But they have his actual mark-” Neville said timidly.
“I want to believe that.” He whispered. “I want to so badly, but you saw his face. If Potter ever-”
"I-" Harry looked torn. "We've both been drinking and we have to work in the morning…”
“Blimey, whose place is this?” Ron stared open-mouthed at the massive pond teeming with glittering water fairies.
“It’s alright, you’re going to be fine. I promise.” George’s voice floated on the wind and Harry almost stopped.
“When you say trapped…” Harry didn’t bother to finish his sentence.
“You didn’t know me at Hogwarts.” Draco frowned, finally turning to face him.
All feelings of lighthearted banter vanished as they reached the seventh-floor corridor. The Dark Lord's cruel voice seemed to emanate from the walls themselves and the three of them flinched.
“Thanks.” Draco rolled his eyes theatrically.
Grimmauld Place was quickly becoming the go-to place for whenever someone needed a break from their own home. Harry both loved and hated the constant company, but his pride that he had managed to make the old townhouse comfortable enough to turn it into an escape eclipsed his annoyance. Ron was here more often than not lately, and even Pansy and Hermione stayed over when they had business in town. George, Luna, and Neville also flitted in and out at their leisure, though they rarely ever stayed for more than a night. On a few occasions, Bill and Fleur also claimed a room when Bill’s job brought him anywhere near London. For the most part, it was nice having someone to share this big empty space with. Today, however, he could have done without Ron’s presence.
Draco shuddered as he watched him go, like a bizarre bat-like creature taking flight. They started marching silently towards the front gate so that they could apparate to Hogsmeade. Even in the Dark Lord’s absence, no one dared to speak a word.
“Where did you get this?” She bellowed at the remaining snatchers. “Snape sent it directly to my vault in Gringotts! WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?”
“Good. I’m glad you are able to have something you like.” Draco nodded in satisfaction.
“No, I love you. I hate parties, even yours.” Harry grumbled, finishing his neat whiskey.
“I do, but that won’t be a problem.” Draco smirked, downshifting to demonstrate his dexterity at being able to shift with his right hand.
Draco studied Harry with concern before taking the initiative to apparate them back to his place.
“What’s going to happen to me?” Draco looked up at him with unshed tears. “I didn’t use to be this angry. And it never stops. I’m just so frustrated all the time.”
“I will.” Harry promised immediately. “I’ll win. For you.”
“They did what they had to to survive!”
"Think nothing of it." His father turned, swishing his robes in a very Malfoy-ish fashion. When he caught Draco watching him he gave him a very formal nod in greeting and moved on.
Draco couldn’t even find amusement in the fact that the power-hungry prat referred to himself in the third person. A soft whimper arose from the prone figure shaking on the ground.
“We heard quite a number of interesting things from Mr. Potter just a moment ago, and I’m sure we all have burning questions for you- but what I’m most curious about is how you would classify your relationship with Harry Potter?” A raven haired witch asked from the far left.
Draco had let Pansy tag along while he went furniture shopping and she provided some surprisingly helpful insight. They had spent the entire day looking at sofas and bed frames and end tables yesterday, and with Pansy’s help, they had found everything he needed. He had arranged it so that everything would be delivered to his beach house in Rye by the end of the week. Draco wasn’t sure if the feeling in his chest, like he had eaten ice cream much too fast, was excitement or dread.
More muttering filled the courtroom and Kingsley had to call everyone to order.
He had made it.
“I know that now,” Harry said gently. “I didn’t know what a self-righteous prat I sounded like back then either.”
He was vaguely aware of Bill cursing up a storm as he was hit by the onslaught, but he couldn’t look away from the dark rows of shelves.
“Because I know how horrible it can be to deal with stuff like this on your own.’ Draco pressed a soft kiss to the top of Harry’s head.
“Everything looks wonderful, Mary.” Hermione greeted her with a quick hug.
The other part of him thought that the little voice telling him that this happiness wasn’t going to last might have a point.
“Nobody blames you, sweetheart.” She rubbed his back soothingly, whispering reassurances as he cried and choked out useless apologies.
“She would never.” Bill seemed amused.
The three of them dashed across the hall and through the door, shutting it firmly behind them. They could hear multiple sets of footsteps echoing through the towering piles of junk; bottles, hats, crates, chairs, books, weapons, broomsticks, and even a few live bats.
“It’s the mudblood!” Vince snarled  “Avada Kedavra!”
“Well, yes.” Draco’s eyes flicked up and Harry held his gaze. “About damn time, too. I constantly thank Merlin and Morgana that my mother married outside of the family or I might have turned out as simple as Greg and Vince.”
Harry retreated quietly to his bunk, rage at Ron’s cruel words and sympathy for Hermione warring within him.
“Ok.” He said breathlessly.
“For letting me keep it, and for sharing that with me. I know talking about the war hurts you. You normally go all stiff and change the subject.”
Draco missed Harry’s reply as some things clicked into place.
“No, no wait! We should make them say ‘Potter Stinks’ too!” Blaise snorted, almost falling over from laughing so hard.
“You’re on.” Draco rolled the ball up the table and was dismayed when it fell into the ten-point circle.
“Thank you for your testimony, Harry. You may step down from the stand.” The Minister was looking at Harry like a proud father figure and Draco idly wondered what the connection was between them. “The court calls Draco Malfoy to the stand.”
“Oh. I’m actually not very hungry.” Harry looked dazed.
She ducked out of the way of his next curse just in time and threw a blue jet of light in his direction which he easily sidestepped. He hadn’t intended on dueling his Aunt, but now that he was he felt a perverse sense of cathartic release. She was fast and had impeccable reflexes, but so did he. He held his own for a fair amount of time before she started bearing down on him, backing him into a literal corner.
“I could just wear it open, that would solve the shoulder problem.” He suggested hopefully. He didn’t want to have to try on another shirt.
"But it does?" Draco looked at him helplessly.
He took the parchment back and cleared his throat.
“What’s got Nott all pissed off?” Blaise asked nonchalantly as he closed the door behind him.
“Well, owls didn’t exactly make the list of the dead.” Hermione reached out to stroke the grey owl and it hooted at her happily.
"Yeah." Harry’s face was getting more red with each passing second.
“Fair point.” Draco conceded, untying the small roll of parchment from the bird’s leg. He unrolled it quickly and was filled with a strange sense of relief when he recognized Harry’s handwriting.
"That's alright. It's not your job to know. It's your job to get through it." Draco gave his hand a reassuring squeeze.
“Does this mean that when Lucius Malfoy was in possession of Draco Malfoy’s wand, he became the master of the Elder wand?” The same young wizard questioned.
Draco frowned and tried again, forcefully sending the ball up the incline. Apparently, it was too much power because the ball bypassed the circles and fell behind the scoreboard. He huffed in annoyance.
“How were you able to break the curse after two years?” A small wizard squeaked.
“But-”
“I thought-” he hesitated, trying to find the right way to express his feelings. “You said you stopped drawing after the war and picked up painting, and you’re super talented at both so I thought you might like using charcoal because it kind of combines the two. Best of both worlds, you know?” Harry scratched the back of his head anxiously, looking at the art kit instead of Draco.
Malfoy looked up at him with those eyes like fluid moonlight and Harry knew it was all over. He could feel himself starting to reach the peak.
Harry flinched at the slur and Blaise’s jaw dropped at the brazen use of such foul language in the presence of two ladies. Rage boiled in Draco’s veins and he was about to give a scathing retort when Harry intervened.
Four somber faces nodded back at him. He pulled Pansy and Theo in close and tried to draw strength from them. There was a second, blinding flash of blue light and suddenly Harry was holding Cedric to him at the entrance to the maze. Draco stood up. Something was seriously wrong. Harry was clinging to Cedric like he was…
“Now there’s a daddy’s boy if I ever saw one. Like father, like son there.” Dean chuckled.
It was strange, he reflected, that he would end up being friends with Hermione. No stranger than Harry Potter being friends with Pansy, he mused. It was certainly less strange than Pansy and Hermione falling in love, yet here they were.
“I love you too, sweetheart.” She chirped happily. “I’ll see you later.”
“I hate to see you like this.” She pouted.
Arimere watched as Draco and Potter headed in the direction of the nearest apparition point, grinning like a fool.
What had triggered it?
Draco had given it serious consideration. The way he saw it, there were two solutions to his Harry situation. Option one: he could quit the ballet, which would save him from both having to see Harry and having to come out to his father; but that also meant giving up something he loved over a boy which was asinine. Option two: he could spend as little time at Hogwarts as possible- show up mere moments before he had to be there, dance his heart out, and then disappear the moment the rehearsal or performance was over; but that would take precision and well-planned timing. The first option was very tempting. After careful deliberation, however, he ended up choosing the latter because he couldn’t bear to disappoint Madame Juliette. This line of thinking is what led him to sit in the studio parking lot reading his book instead of going inside until the last minute. He had even worn his dance costume beneath his street clothes so he didn’t have to waste time changing. When the clock read five till he got out of the Vantage, using the car to help him stretch. He knew he probably looked ridiculous to anyone who happened to drive by, but he would rather look ridiculous than have to face Harry.
“Let me help you out, Potter.” Malfoy said and hauled Harry up, sending sparks everywhere he touched him.
He felt so warm and at peace, why should he fight it? His cock was aching and that should be his only concern - it was his only concern.
Malfoy wrapped his hand around Harry’s cock. Harry’s mind tunneled; he could feel nothing but Malfoy’s hand around his cock and the building pleasure.
He pushed Harry against the wall and tugged Harry’s boxer’s down, exposing Harry’s cock to the air. Harry shivered.
Malfoy moaned. “Fuck, Potter! Who knew you were gagging for my cock.”
Quietly, but getting louder, an idea was forming in his head. He knew what would stop his cock from aching. He moved his eyes away from the dark mark and looked at its owner - Malfoy. A slow thread of arousal curled through his cock.
His cock throbbed. He wanted to take Malfoy’s hard cock in his mouth, run his tongue along that hard length, over the slit, feel it throb in his mouth. He wanted to taste it. He needed it; he needed to taste the salt on his tongue and -
Malfoy’s thrusts quicker and deeper into Harry’s mouth, and Harry’s entire body shook with pleasure. Suddenly, Malfoy’s cock pulsed and warm, salty liquid trickled down Harry’s throat.
His sore cock twinged, reminding him of how hard he was, how much he longed to cum. The fogginess returned. He wanted to swallow Malfoy’s cock, he wanted to feel how hot and hard he was against his tongue. He needed it. He needed it to cum.
He decided to think of nothing. He pumped his cock at a furious pace and focused instead on the feeling. His entire body was covered in a sheen of sweat. He could feel something but it was incredibly muted. Nothing like what he felt from when he used to masturbate before that final stand-off with Voldemort. The feeling began to build and before long he was reaching the usual crescendo. His balls were drawn up, his cock was rock hard, he was ready to cum, he was ready to finally get that release. Except, nothing happened. It was like he hit a wall. The feeling kept building but he couldn’t cum. No matter what he did. He pumped harder, held his breath and tensed his entire body. Still nothing. Just like every other single time he had masturbated after the final battle, he still couldn’t cum.
Harry made his way over and stretched out his hand, in apology and ready to help Malfoy get up.
Like they were attached to a magnet, his eyes fell on Malfoy’s dark mark. His mind went foggy.
“Get off me, Potter!”
Harry launched himself into the four-poster bed and waved his curtains shut with his hand, blocking himself off from the rest of the dormitory. Whilst simultaneously whispering a silencing spell, he pulled down his pyjama bottoms. His cock jutted hard and red against his stomach. His balls were purple and significantly more swollen than normal, the veins on his cock bulged. He ached. Maybe this time he’d finally be able to cum.
“Potter!” Malfoy shouted. The door swung shut behind him.
He knew what he had to do; he had to make Malfoy happy.
“Don’t,” Malfoy’s hand slammed against Harry’s shoulder, “speak about my father.”
Harry shot backwards, averting his eyes. He pulled his boxers up; he had to get out and away from Malfoy and his dark mark. He needed to do something, tell someone. He stumbled into the shower curtain and stubbed his toe on the rail but successfully made his way to his jeans and t-shirt. Harry pulled them on. He would have to swallow his pride and go to Hermione. He needed help.
“Do you want to suck my cock, Potter?”
Malfoy scrambled off Harry and pulled the shower curtains shut.
Malfoy’s cock stopped pumping and he stayed in Harry’s mouth for a while just panting.
Malfoy had a firm grip and rough calluses that brushed against the underside of Harry’s cock. Harry didn’t care; the pressure and intensity was perfect. Malfoy kept a fast pace and the pressure and orgasm was building quickly. Harry wanted it to last longer -
Malfoy’s feet slid against the tiles and he toppled backwards through the shower curtain, smacking his skull against the shower wall. Malfoy grimaced and touched his head delicately. The sound was so loud, Harry winced. Empathy subdued his anger. He hadn’t meant to cause a fight. Or put Malfoy in any pain.
Harry needed to feel Malfoy throb in his mouth; Harry grasped for the knot in Malfoy’s towel and it easily fell to the floor. Underneath the towel, Malfoy was completely smooth. Malfoy’s cock was beautiful; it was pale with thin veins running along the side and big.
When Harry pushed open the door to the showers, steam billowed out. Three of the shower stalls were empty with their curtains drawn back, however, the middle shower’s curtains were drawn and water pattered across them. The towel hanging over the shower curtain rail was a fluffy white one which didn’t identify the shower occupant.
He licked the slit and tasted the salt from the precum; it tingled in his mouth. It was the best thing he had ever tasted, salty and warm and Malfoy. He put his mouth around the head and started lapping up the precum. Malfoy groaned.
Finally, the waves of pleasure slowed down and Harry’s mind started coming back to himself.
And then everything reached a crescendo. His mind went white hot with pleasure. He was cumming. Spurts of white went everywhere. Waves of pleasure rocked through his body. His entire insides fizzed.
“Look, I apologise -” Malfoy managed to wrestle his arm free from Harry’s grip and he yanked on Harry’s hair. Harry’s face snapped round. His eyes fell on the Dark Mark underneath his knee.
Malfoy scowled. He wrapped his fingers around Harry’s hand and pulled, hard. Harry tried to keep his balance but the shower tiles were still wet from Malfoy’s shower. He slipped and fell straight onto Malfoy.
“So the chosen one really is just a dimwitted coward. Does the dark mark scare you witless, Potter? I never thought I’d see a Gryffindor run like a chicken when he caught a glimpse of it.” Malfoy said. Harry was not a coward; he opened his eyes.
“Potter?” Malfoy asked, reaching a hand out - the arm with the dark mark.
had wrestled control of his mind when he had looked at Malfoy’s dark mark.
He felt warm and gooey, like he’d just had a full body massage, everything was good except - except his cock was aching. His cock was straining so much, his balls so tender and swollen. He needed release, he needed to cum.
Harry’s cock leaked precum onto his stomach. He was still so hard. When Voldemort had gripped him by his robe and whispered into his ear that he was cursed to never find happiness unless he became enslaved to the dark mark, Harry had never imagined anything like this.
“Oh, Merlin, fuck.” Malfoy says and starts thrusting his cock into Harry’s mouth. Fuck, that felt even better. His jaw was spread so wide and the rhythmic thrusts sent trails of pleasure down Harry’s body. Oh yes, he needed to be used this way. With every thrust, arousal built in Harry’s cock, getting more and more intense like he too was getting his cock sucked.
He didn’t know when he had started to cry but the tears wouldn’t stop now. He lost the ability to form words around the painful lump in his throat and he lowered his wand. He carelessly tossed it aside to pull at his hair, desperately trying to find something else to focus on.
“Potions should be nearly empty this afternoon with most of our class taking their apparition tests. It might be a good time to soften Slughorn up.” Hermione suggested hopefully.
"Yeah. Especially when you don't style your hair. It looks better down." He scratched his nose awkwardly.
“You know me so well.” Harry laughed and Draco felt a thrill rush through him at his words.
“He said that?” Draco was shocked.
“No problem. My dad used to play all the time and he taught me growing up, so it should be easy teaching you.” Dean shrugged.
Harry glanced over at him, eyebrows raised. When Draco didn’t recant the pet name a delighted smile illuminated his face and made his jade eyes sparkle and Draco felt both elated and relieved. He had wanted to say something more intimate but went with sweet yet safe at the last minute. If things went well, they would have plenty of time to work up to using pet names like 'darling' and 'babe'.
“Calling the shots, Auror Potter? I like it.” Bill teased. “You heard the man, let's move out.”
"I only wish, Malfoy." Harry sighed, hoping that if he went along with it Malfoy would lose interest and leave him alone.
Once they were safely in the communal bathroom that the fourth years shared she led him to the closest shower stall and dumped him unceremoniously in the middle of the floor. Draco groaned as he tried to sit up, holding his head in his hands.
Bill cleared his throat awkwardly “Are we good?”
“What’s interesting?” Harry asked as he finished his last bite of beef bourguignon.
Voldemort.
“Your home is beautiful, I love what you’ve done with it.” She smiled.
“Yes, well. Pansy is terrifying, and when she pouts it’s impossible to tell her no.” Draco smiled fondly, running his fingers through the wet sand.
Pansy had left out her oil paints, so that is what Draco used. He had seen her mix linseed oil with the tubes of bright pigment in the past, so that’s what he did. It only took him a few tries to achieve an acceptable consistency and he was rather proud of himself. Once he had a pallet made up of his desired colors he found it incredibly easy to lose himself in the craft. He channeled all of his overwhelming emotions into each stroke, not even paying attention to the painting as a whole. He could only see the section of canvas that his brush touched. Apparently, he had lost track of time, because when a voice sounded behind him the sun had moved drastically across the sky just outside of the bay windows.
“Nothing. It’s playing billiards with Dean that’s the problem.” Ron guffawed, elbowing Dean in the ribs a tad harder than he originally intended.
“Well, go get him! He was down by the shore last I saw.” She looked exasperated, but her cheeks were flushed and she gave him a fond glare, so she must not have been too mad.
"You and Ron both, well at least he thought so after he started feeling better," Hermione sighed and rolled her eyes fondly, "What am I going to do with him."
"Ugh!" Harry groaned and flopped onto the bed, Draco tried to ignore how the sound made him feel. "I'm not asking you to go dying for me, I just mean being friends."
Harry let out a laugh, hurrying to the love-seat in front of the fire to strip it of pillows and cushions.
"Okay, good," Draco responded awkwardly and turned back to his book.
Draco found Harry already waiting for him by the entrance to the common room as he made it down stairs, "Hey."
"It's fine Malfoy," Harry said, the earlier humor from his voice was gone and it sounded hollow which immediately made Draco's stomach turn in a way that was not at all pleasant. What is happening to me? Draco thought, Just last year I'd be celebrating if I got that kind of reaction from Potter. Draco supposed that it was because he knew what it was like to go through a war and it wasn't all just petty digs anymore as they were when they were young. "Do you want to play the game or not?" Harry said, pulling Draco out of his thoughts as he sat up to look at him.
"That's code for 'I'm crying myself to sleep at night cause no girl wants me,'" Blaise said and Pansy immediately rounded on him.
Lavender Brown — chaser, keeper
"You want me to dye your hair?" Pansy asked, incredulous.
The bickering was back quickly enough though as the first goal was made and Hermione let out a long suffering sigh.
Harry sent him a glare as he finally got the vine to let go, "What great help you are," he muttered, "and I didn't sleep through the whole class."
"Yeah, I saw them a couple days ago, and they were both red now instead of pink."
After a moment Draco pressed a third finger in and Harry's eyes squeezed shut at the intrusion. "Am I-"
Harry pressed his lips to Draco's when the door to their room closed and Draco leaned into it almost immediately, his eyes fluttering closed. Harry could feel Draco smiling into the kiss and he let out a small laugh.
"Precisely"
"Yeah, I'm just worried if it'll do anything before then."
Draco noticed Harry's gaze and moved over to his bed as quickly as his stomach and dizzy head would let him. He grabbed some clothes out of his dresser and ducked onto his bed to change behind the curtains.
"We were always so worried about everything happening in the world through our school years. None of us really were able to focus on other things and Draco had the worst of it, he was so concerned with his parents' politics that he let that affect how he viewed everything. I know he wanted to have been friends with Potter first year, and now that he's older I know he wants more than that, and this is his chance at it," Pansy let out a long sigh, "I've noticed the looks Potter sends Draco's way at meals and the way he looks at Draco when they're together. Draco has a very good chance and I just don't want him to screw this up for himself."
"Yeah, just a bad dream. It's alright, you can go back to bed," Harry said, running his hand over his face.
"Why do you want me to go?"
"Yeah, it's pretty obvious. You look at him too softly for you to truly hate him," Dean said, setting his own armful of alcohol down on the table.
"Well as captain, I say Ron's keeper," Harry said clapping Ron on the back and smiling at him.
"And that's why you're going to be fat when your metabolism slows down. Being skinny and being healthy aren't the same."
"Alright, everyone ready?" George said, finishing setting up the last of the fireworks, "fifteen seconds till midnight!"
They found themselves pressing into each other’s sides as they walked, fingers brushing together, hidden behind the layers of clothing they had on to protect them from the cold.
"Come on, let's leave them alone," Harry said, pulling away a shocked Hermione and a still-laughing Ron.
"Oh thank goodness, you know, it's hard to find anyone when everyone's wearing costumes and masks."
"Mmm," was Draco's only reply as he seemed to slump further into Harry's side. Harry looked down to see Draco was almost asleep and he put his arm around his shoulders, pulling him further into himself. Draco let out a soft sigh and Harry leaned down to press a kiss to his forehead.
Ginny let out a breathy laugh, and breathed in shakily. "Even Ron?"
"Oh," Harry said, remembering that Hermione was talking to him, "They said that our potion had been mixed with amortentia."
"Not so fast, what was your plan you had."
Pansy returned with the pink notebook and resumed her position on the bed and opened it up scribbling in neat cursive 'Plan Blaise x Neville'.
"Yeah? I think it'd be a lot more enjoyable than being an auror. I've had enough running after bad wizards for a lifetime I think," Harry let out a dry laugh.
Draco's ears burned, he had no idea what any of the glowing meant, but the fact that he was glowing the most was embarrassing enough. "Do you have any idea what's causing it yet?"
"So? The water isn't bad with a warming charm."
"Of course I have, everyone has," Draco gave Harry an are you stupid look and held the door open for him.
Harry was getting frustrated and angry, "Is that what you think this is? That I'm just fooling around with you?"
"You think?" Draco asked, looking a bit unsure and vulnerable.
"And yet, you said you'd kiss him out of everyone in the circle."
"Okay, well I'm going to head to bed. It has got to have been an hour by now." Harry jumped to his feet, gathering his books and left a dumbfounded Draco sitting at the table.
"We can exchange Christmas gifts then," Harry said, sliding into the seat across from them.
"How do you want them laid out?" Harry asked, looking down at the pile, unsure what to do next.
Harry stared down at Draco's soaked robes on the bank that he'd forgotten in his rush.
"Hey-"
Draco was stirring the potion back at the table and had been for some time before deciding to check what had held up Harry. He looked the potion over to make sure it was okay to leave and then headed back to the store room.
"No, you're not. You've read all week and I'm getting sick of it. All you do is sit there and read and I'm just confined to the room as you do it. It sucks."
---------------------------
"Well, what are you working on?" Draco said, leaning over to inspect the book that Harry had not looked at once since he noticed Draco was in the library.
"Hmm?" Ron muttered, sitting up and looking over at the empty bed Harry normally slept on. "He's probably just in the bathroom, I'll go get him," Ron said, sliding out of bed and pulling on a shirt.
"Still..."
Ginny and Luna were sitting on Ginny's bed in Gryffindor tower. All her roommates were at lunch already so they had the place to themselves.
"I'm with Harry on this one Hermione," Ron piped up, "Malfoy always starts everything." Hermione glared at him, which promptly shut him up.
"What are we going to do now?" Draco sighed, giving Harry's hand a slight squeeze trying to express his nervousness of what is to come for them.
"And we all matured quite a bit," Hermione said, taking a bite of eggs.
Draco let out a sigh and dropped his hand, “Yeah, but I don’t feel like going.” With that, he muttered about getting left behind by their friends and hurried up to them.
Draco didn't reply, only stared hard at the door.
Draco suddenly got quiet and in a small voice said, "Take the dark mark." It was suddenly very quiet in their shared room as Harry studied Draco carefully who looked like he was trying to curl into himself.
"Yeah, okay. Good luck with Malfoy,"
------------------------------------
Draco's eyes were squeezed shut again, trying to block out the sun and Harry quickly noticed. Harry got up then and closed the curtains on the four-poster, leaving a slight gap on one side where he was sitting originally.
"Whatever you say Draco," Pansy said and turned back to her food, Draco hated the knowing tone to her voice and the sympathy in her eyes. He did not like Potter. Not one bit, those girls just annoyed him because they only liked him for his fame and nothing else, it just pissed him off.
Draco let out a long sigh, knowing he lost, and scooted closer to Harry who reached his hand up and placed it on Draco's neck. And then Draco felt lips on his and he shut his eyes tightly. I am kissing Harry Potter, actually kissing him, Draco thought and his stomach did a flip at the thought. Their lips were pressed together awkwardly, the exact thing Pansy said not to do.
"Why not? There must be someone you're interested in," Ron said, deciding to try and change tactics and use gender-neutral terms instead.
"You alright?" Draco asked, concern lacing his features, handing Harry a cup of water.
"You coming?" Draco said from his bed, patting the spot next to himself. Harry swiftly took the spot next to Draco and swiftly fell asleep to Draco running his hands through Harry's hair as he read silently.
After that announcement, it was like everyone completely forgot about the quidditch match. The hall seemed to explode with chatter. Girls were worrying about getting a dress and guys were talking about who they would invite.
"Yeah, it's obvious how much he cares for you," Pansy said.
Christmas is in two days! I'm actually kind of excited about it to be honest. It's been a while since we've had a normal Christmas here.
"It's beautiful," Draco whispered, wide eyed as he stared.
The kiss seemed to go on for ages, but it still wasn't quite long enough when Draco slowly pulled away. They both kept their eyes closed for a moment after, a sigh escaping Harry's lips. Then, suddenly realizing what he'd done, Draco's eyes shot open and he jumped up mumbling about being sorry. He quickly grabbed his wand and was gone before Harry could even react.
When they came back down, Harry looked up to find Ron redder than his hair from embarrassment and decked in a tight shirt. If the shirt was tight on Hermione it was constricting on Ron and he felt extremely exposed.
"You guys want to join us? We're just going to Zonko's and then heading back to the castle," Neville said.
"I had been in the potion's store room so I missed it all," Draco said, looking over at Harry, "what happened exactly?"
Hermione ignored Seamus' comment, "Yeah, okay, I'll make sure to let everyone know."
"What? It's not like this is the first time you've seen me shirtless," Hermione laughed as Ron's neck went red. "For goodness sake, take the shirt!" Hermione said when Ron continued to stare, and chucked it at his head.
"Not really," Harry sighed, readjusting his book-bag on his shoulder. He would switch shoulders, but he didn't want to jam the bag between the two of them. "I've seen a couple more colors: pink and green. I think there are only four colors total, or I haven't seen any others at least. Everyone has a color too," Harry said, trailing off and looking out towards where they usually sat by the lake. There weren't many people out there as it was October and getting cold. "Oh, and sometimes people will glow brighter than usual."
"For one, because we have that potions essay due on Monday - which I bet you haven't even started - and the transfiguration homework, not to mention all the other class work I'm sure you've been putting off. AND you have barely talked to either me or Ron all week, I was hoping we'd be able to do something today before you go off with Malfoy."
October 10, 1998
"I don't need help," Drcao retorted, reopening his book to a random page.
"Well I guess the secret's out then," Blaise said with a dramatic sigh.
“This still doesn’t explain why you got into a fight with him today.”
They ended up in The Three Broomsticks which was a great relief to Draco. They grabbed a booth in the back that was slightly hidden and a waitress showed up quickly after they sat down.
"It will! We can keep it quiet or-"
But it felt so good, and it almost felt like a sort of rebellion, even- the 'chosen one', fooling around in a hall with none other than Draco Malfoy. Man, if the press caught wind of this, he thought, but that was the glory in it, no one would ever know. To top it off, the whole thing just felt so right, that he was barely thinking about the rebellious nature of his actions when he was kissing Draco.
“Maybe only because he hasn’t been around us a whole lot,” Hermione said slowly, “but I assume you’re saying that because none of us exactly got along in years past. Though, if that’s the reason, you forgot Harry in your listing there.”
“Yep.”
"Best not to try and move around too much. The spell that caused that was dark magic, so I wasn't able to heal you. The best I could do was keep it from bleeding too much." Draco moved his hand to feel the bandages that were wrapped around his chest. "It's a good thing Professor Snape showed up when he did, I imagine it could have turned out a lot worse," Pomfrey said, waving her wand around and muttering spells. "Okay, take this for any pain and make sure to get some rest."
"This has got to stop Harry, we should probably call it quits or McGonagall isn't going to let anyone play. You and Ron have enough information to pick the team right?" Hermione said to Harry. She had come down from the stands to talk to Harry and they were both currently trying to figure out what to do.
"Nah it's fine, I'm sure they understand and we can write a letter when we get to Hogwarts."
Draco let out a contented sigh as Harry pulled the blankets around him, a sound that made Harry's heart twist and he was suddenly very glad he had stopped them.
Maybe this wasn't such a good idea, Harry thought miserably.
"I can carry that," Draco said, holding a hand out for it.
"What have I told you about not talking with your mouth full," Hermione said, "What he was trying to say was that Quidditch practice is in an hour and Harry still hasn't come down from his room. He needs to eat."
"Feel okay?" Draco said lowly, startling Harry a bit.
"The joke shop?" Draco asked as they made their way up to the entrance of the shop.
Ron yawned and stretched out on the floor and both of the Patil twins excused themselves to go to bed.
"You fell asleep and my mother saw you," Draco said, his panic rising as he talked and he could feel his throat starting to close.
"I asked who she'd have as a roommate if she could change it, besides Ron."
"How would you know I carried back bags every time? Were you spying on me? I think that says more about you than me," Draco said back, trying to act nonchalant, but inside he was freaking out a bit. He didn't know why, but the idea that Harry had been paying so close attention to him all those years filled him with a feeling of unexplainable giddiness.
"Yeah, but only as a best friend, you're the one dating him."
Draco Malfoy was bloody attractive. When did that happen?
“Right, you lot,” Fred addressed the rest of the room, not letting Harry go. He held him by the waist and George slung his arm around his shoulder and Harry was grateful for their support. “We heard the tail end of what seemed to be an argument about what Harry and the others need to do to win this war. From what I gathered, you all were giving the man we love a load of shite about completing his mission. Well, I’ve got something to say to you. Our darling Harry, He-Who’s-Kisses-Are-Divine-”
“Don’t get smart with me, boy!” He bellowed before opening the paper with such force he almost tore it in half. Apparently, he found the article he was looking for because he started to read aloud in a mocking tone. “Up and coming ballet star Harry Potter plays the lead in the debut of ballet protege Julliette Pond’s first original work.”
“Oh, come off it. The way ‘Mione tells it you two were actually nice to each other.” Ron rolled his eyes at Harry’s theatrics.
Draco glanced around, trying to mask his awe at the dimly lit room with hundreds of seats arranged into neat rows. They were facing a massive white sheet of some material Draco couldn’t name and he cast Harry a questioning look. Harry just winked at him and lead him towards the back, climbing the strangely lit stairs. The theater was already quite full and people were still filing in, making mad grabs for the best seats and saving spots for friends who hadn’t arrived yet. Draco and Harry had managed to snag seats in the middle of the second to the last row, something Harry seemed quite pleased about.
Everyone took turns buying a round for the table, and, as was their tradition, the buyer got to choose what everyone else drank. They had a very specific order that they followed; Ron was first because he usually picked beer, Seamus went second because, of course, he always bought shots and they needed to chase whatever torture he inflicted on them with the last of their beer. Harry went next because he ordered based on whatever mood he was in, keeping things interesting and mixing it up. Dean usually deferred to cocktails, making for a nice palate cleanser after whatever Harry ordered. Neville went last because he tended to opt for what he knew everyone liked, ending the night on a high note. It was a relatively inexpensive way to get sloshed and it was always fun watching the other guys try different drinks.
"Why'd you have a go at his dead mum?!" Theo demanded.
He wasn’t quite sure when he started falling for Draco Malfoy, but Harry realized quite suddenly that that is exactly what he had done. His soft lips burned across his skin as he kissed Harry with an intensity that left him craving more. When he bit Draco’s bottom lip playfully he was rewarded with a soft moan that made Harry’s cock twitch.
Harry had plenty of time to think over the summer. No matter which way he looked at it, Snape’s snide digs at Sirius about having to hide out whilst the rest of the Order was risking their lives had probably been a powerful factor in Sirius' decision to go to the Ministry. Harry clung to this notion, happy to have a scapegoat. It enabled him to blame Snape, which felt satisfying in and of itself. Harry also knew that if anyone was not sorry that Sirius was dead, it was the man now striding next to him in the darkness.
“I’d open it before making any judgments.” Harry grimaced.
“Hermione and I will throw a dinner party. Oh! Or we can invite him to your housewarming party! It wouldn’t be too hard to get him to come.” She felt the familiar fire of mischief ignite inside of her.
That had to have been one of the best things that had ever happened to him Draco decided and felt strangely empty as Harry pulled away.
"Hey, just a dream, breathe," Draco whispered, already climbing in next to Harry.
The walk down to the greenhouse was fairly quiet, but it was less tense than it was before. When they finally arrived, Blaise led the way over to his bubotuber.
After a moment of walking Draco seemed to finally realize that Harry wasn’t next to him. He started to turn around when Harry cleared his throat, startling Draco. He stepped backwards slightly, the back of his leg hitting something solid and he quickly ended up on the ground next to a kneeling Harry, holding a ring.
Harry looked up at him and Draco gulped, his face getting a bit hot in his nervousness, and he had to look away. "I have a feeling it wasn't a death eater," he said and Harry looked up at him, a questioning look on his face, "I just mean, don't you think it was a little sloppy? They could have just switched out the potion to something else, that probably would have had better results. Think about it, what do you think they wanted to accomplish by dumping veritaserum into the potion?"
"Would you like anything to drink, dear?" Molly called from downstairs.
"I brought some chocolate frogs," Harry said, pulling them out and handing one to Draco.
Thinking of Draco, though, brought a whole new issue to the forefront of his brain. Draco glows red. Not only that, but he always seemed to be glowing brightly, almost blinding at times. The only people who had out-shined him - literally - were Ron and Hermione.
"Ron was complaining that Zabini was talking in his sleep about someone and seemed totally whipped. I guess he was dreaming about Neville."
Relief flooded Harry as he said his thanks for letting him know, and headed back to the dorms. It was great to know that there was an end in sight to the potions effects. Even if it hadn't seemed to do anything bad to him, it still made him nervous.
"Oh, um," Harry looked down at his paper which only had about a sentence on it, "not much."
"Did-"
"Draco!" Harry said a little louder, with a shake of his shoulder, and Draco finally started to move.
He made his way down the train, peering into the compartments until he spotted Draco. He was seated next to Blaise and was talking to an animated Pansy.
"Night, see you tomorrow," Hermione said, heading inside the room.
"Yeah, it never works," Harry's eyes watched as Draco's hands ran over the sheets mindlessly. Draco had moved his eyes back to Harry and set to watching Harry's eyes as they stared down at Draco's hands. They sat like that for a moment in a peaceful silence.
"So what are the plans for the day?" Draco asked Harry as they walked down the street, a little too close to just be friends.
When they stepped out onto the grounds Harry pulled his scarf around himself a bit tighter, it was colder than usual for October.
"Yeah," Draco said faintly, leaning forward into Harry.
"Yes you did, non stop," Lucius said, "As soon as you met him and we've never gotten any ounce of peace since." Narcissa laughed lightly as Draco continued to try and save himself.
"Well, yeah," Ginny said, studying him, "but there are more than three sexualities you know, there are also people like Luna who are pansexual - meaning they don't care about gender - or asexual or androsexual, the list goes on."
As much as Harry tried not to show it, he was worried about what the potion meant for the safety of Hogwarts, Hermione could tell. Even if it seemed as though it may have just been an accident, with no evidence on the contrary.
"To feel better," Harry laughed slightly, "I mean, why would wizards take skeligrow when it tastes so bad? To heal themselves."
"Oh come on 'Mione, it's fine, trust me," Ron said, squinting up at her, "Though we should stock up on hangover potion before the next one."
"Really? You want to?"
"Are you okay?" Draco asked, coming closer to Harry.
"I'm not hurting you right?" Draco asked, fingers stilling and concern lacing his features.
Harry spun next and it landed on Goyle, who was dared to kiss Parvati (who promptly wiped her lips multiple times and took a shot of firewhiskey.) A few more rounds went by until Ginny spun and it landed on Draco.
"I love you, you know that?" Ron whispered against Hermione's lips.
"Shhh! Keep it down! Someone's going to hear," Blaise shot a nervous look at the door and they all turned to look for a moment.
"You totally skipped the first two steps!" Pansy said, getting out the notebook. "You went straight to step three, or I guess more like step four."
"Yes I suppose," Draco drawled, taking his time to get his stuff, "see you all later." With that both boys were headed out in silence.
My friend is kissing me.
Harry slowly made it down to the great hall after showering. A few eighth years were nursing hangovers around the great hall and McGonagall looked mildly angry at the staff table.
“Yeah, I uh-” Harry started, heart feeling like it was going to leap out of his chest, “I wanted to apologize to start.”
"Yeah, don't let Hermione hear you say that. She's already got it set in her head that this was a good idea, and you'd only reinforce it."
"You very well know that it's not my choice to be hanging out with him!" Harry defended, suddenly awake, "It's not like I enjoy his company Hermione. And I've already finished all my homework, Malfoy helped me with my potions essay." Hermione looked at Harry for a moment with shock written all over her face - no doubt from the fact Harry already had all his work done for the first time ever - but recovered quickly.
"That definitely makes a lot more sense, do you think McGonagall would say yes?" Ron said.
When Harry emerged from the shower he practically jumped, seeing Draco perched on his bed.
Harry gathered his things up and bade farewell to them, before Ron even recovered, and followed Draco out of the Great Hall.
"Oh nothing, Harry'll be down in a little bit."
"Oh trust me, I hate that place as much as you. It's horrid in there. I have more sense than to take you there when I finally get you to agree to go on a date with me," Harry laughed and Draco smiled, he liked it when he laughed.
"You don't like her I'm guessing?" Hermione asked.
December 3, 1998
"Fine, then what do you suggest we do?" Draco said, putting his book down on the bed. Harry blanched, he didn't think he'd get this far, and accordingly, didn't have a single idea what they should do.
"It didn't have any horrible effects, at least as far as I've seen," Harry said when they had sat down, "I have a pretty bad headache though, and everyone's glowing."
Before he could say anything, though, Draco interrupted him, "Before you say anything. Harry is my boyfriend and I like him and I'm not breaking up with him, no matter what you say." Draco's voice sounded sure of himself, but Harry knew otherwise as he felt Draco's hand tremble in his own.
Harry
"What no, of course not," Harry responded. Of course he didn't care, he was just too busy being shocked by the fact that Ron and Hermione had really not cared at all - the wizarding world really was very different from the muggle world - to have a big reaction.
"You can't only pick Gryffindors for the team you know."
"Never have I ever fallen asleep in Binns' class," Padma said with a laugh. Just about everyone drank at that and murmurs of how boring the class was circulated. Hermione - who was the only one who didn't drink - shook her head as Harry and Ron guiltily took a shot.
Molly sighed, "It's alright now, next time just leave a note though! I was worried sick! Now come along, lunch is ready!" She hurried out of the room to get the rest of the Weasley family.
Her cough had drawn the attention of not only Harry, but also those sitting around him and the girl's face colored as Ron and Hermione, turned to look at her.
"Real comforting, Potter."
"Yeah, I guess you're right, it just seems too simple. You know?"
The next day Harry woke up without a headache, but it quickly returned when he entered the great hall to see the mess of reds, pinks, blues, and greens.
"We just fell asleep and didn't have an alarm," Harry mumbled, trying to figure out what on earth he was supposed to be working on, and praying that Hermione and Ron would do the same. He wanted them to let it go, not to mention that they were both glowing brighter than Draco was currently, and it was hurting his head to look at them. He wasn't so lucky though.
"No you're not, you just don't want to listen to the lesson," Harry laughed slightly.
—————————————————————
"Ugh, it was that obvious huh?"
"Yeah?" Draco said softly, not making a move to sit up. Harry could tell he was sleepy.
"Think Gryffindor will win?" Hermione asked, looking around at the Quidditch players who were littered around the long table.
"Yeah, I thought I told you about it," Ron said.
"It's an all-day sort of thing, starts after breakfast."
"They didn't like me too much. They weren't fond of magic. My uncle hated the mention of magic and my cousin followed his lead," Draco stared up at him, he had a feeling he knew where this was going.
Seamus Finnigan — chaser
"Oh I'm not worried about people knowing about my addiction, that's common knowledge. The stash isn't though."
"You know it's only October right?"
"No buts. There's no excuses for your non-stop bickering! I've been thinking and the other professors and I have come up with a few ideas that might help promote better behavior from the two of you," Draco and Harry immediately shared frightened looks, whatever she was about to say, both of them knew they wouldn't like it, "in lue of inter-house unity, I've decided that you two will be those that set the example. I want you two to be spending at least an hour a day on school days and two on weekends in each others company. This can be simply studying together or actually doing something fun but you need to spend it together. Do I make myself clear?"
"Okay, so today we're going to play a different game," Pansy announced. She had seemed to have become the unofficial leader of the parties. "It's a game that the lovely Hermione suggested," Pansy winked and tilted her cup of firewhiskey at Hermione who lightly blushed; Ron looked mildly shocked, "called Paranoia. For those who don't know how to play, it's simple: one person will start the game off by whispering a question to the person to their left. Then, that person has to name a person in the circle as an answer. Then that person would flip a coin, heads, and they have to tell what the question was. Tails, and they don't have to say the question. Rules are that you can't talk about the question ever if the coin lands on tails. That means you can't tell someone else what the question was after the game." Pansy paused for a moment, "So, I'll give an example of how the game would be played now. I'd turn to Draco here and ask him who he thinks is the smartest and he'd say Hermione. Then I'd flip this sickle here," Pansy gave it a flip, "And it's landed on tails so I'd then tell everyone what the question was. Any questions?"
Luna and Ginny went next and Harry's turn came after. The pile of paper slowly dwindled as they went through all the papers.
Harry was suddenly worried "monitoring" him meant keeping him in the hospital wing, "You don't mean I have to stay here, right?"
Harry greeted them both, sitting down, "So what was your idea?"
Harry picked up one of the cups of alcohol and put it in front of her, "I dare you to drink that without using your hands."
When he entered the room, though, he quickly realized he probably should have asked what they looked like. His eyes traveled over the many jars and glass containers and then decided he should start looking on the left side first.
"Well I want to change that then."
Draco looked over at him for a moment and he seemed to glow a bit brighter which just confused Harry even more. "It makes even less sense that the potion seems to have no effect besides your headache and the glowing."
"Oh, Pomfrey told me that the potion is supposed to wear off by New Years day. At 7:51 to be exact."
"And green?" Harry asked, intrigued, "and brighter vs dimmer colors."
There were some nervous glances around the circle, but no outright objections and Pansy handed the bottle to Ginny. "You go first this time," Pansy said.
"Oh good, I just started on that actually, we could work together," Draco said, and Oh God, he was scooting closer to Harry so their arms were touching. His loose hair falling slightly in his face as he leaned over to look at his work and Harry could smell his lavender shampoo. He could feel his face heating rapidly and tried not to stare too hard at him.
"You're serious?"
"Yeah who did you go see?" Charlie said with a laugh.
"Hey! It's cool stuff."
Draco let a soft sigh out as he shifted his head on Harry's shoulder. "I have something I want to show you," Harry said after a few more minutes, "I think you'll think it's cool."
The hour passed very slowly for Draco, he could feel Harry's eyes on him and he tried to keep his face neutral. He felt horribly embarrassed about what happened at the party, and knew that given the chance, there was no way Harry would ever let him forget it. So, he ignored him.
They were both drunk, doing this would practically be taking advantage of Draco, Harry suddenly thought and grabbed Draco's hands as they were about to go under his shirt.
"Good morning, love," Harry said, placing a kiss against the back of Draco's neck.
"You know, I think kissing you would be more fun and Ron can always get new stuff," Harry said, eyes remaining closed in a silent plea.
"It's not a date," Draco muttered already headed for the door.
Draco laughed, pulling the map out of his reach, "I'm not done looking."
Harry had just gotten out of the shower about ten minutes ago and his hair was still dripping wet. Draco hated how Harry never seemed to take care of his hair. He never dried it and hardly ran a comb through it and Draco spent a lot of time wishing he had the courage to ask Harry if he could do it for him. At the same time though, his hair was part of what made him Harry Potter and as much as he said he hated it, he also really thought it was charming.
Draco could hear the birds chirping outside the window and he wished he was one of them at this moment, if only to get out of whatever kind of trouble they were about to get into. He knew as soon as Harry suggested it, he wouldn't be able to say no to him.
"Well, there was-" Pomfrey began but was interrupted by a ragged looking Draco bursting through the doors.
"Lavender," Ron responded with a snicker and Hermione went to flip the coin. Lavender watched very intently, overly curious what Ron had said her name to, but the coin landed on tails and Lavender sat back with a sulky sigh.
Draco had chosen to sit at the Gryffindor table, a little too close to be just friendly, just to keep up the teasing with Harry.
Harry was fuming now and shot back, "How could you ever think that?! Why would I go on dates with you and everything else if I only wanted to have someone to make out with!?"
Harry smiled widely and smacked Draco on the back, "Of course; I mean it!"
They both burst through the door to the greenhouse, out of breath and hair a mess. Everyone stared in shock at their messy, flushed, state as they both hurried to sit down, trying to ignore the looks. Harry could only imagine what everyone was thinking.
He raised his wand to Goyle's hair and whispered the incantation. The group watched from across the room as Goyle's hair changed color from the roots out. They could barely make it out in the moonlight and they resolved to enjoy the new color in the morning.
"I still can't believe you snuck into the Slytherin common rooms with Polyjuice potion!" Draco laughed leaning further into Harry and laying his head on his shoulder. He'd rather die than admit that he was quite enjoying it though.
Harry looked over to where Ginny was nervously shifting in her seat and immediately felt like it wasn't going to be good news. Hermione looked happy though, so he figured it probably wasn't too bad, she was usually good at telling how people were feeling.
“Well, yeah,” Harry said, suddenly nervous again.
"Where do you think?"
"Will you ever learn to eat with some table manners?" Hermione asked, looking exasperatedly at the sauce from the chicken Ron was eating, dribble down his chin.
"Have you ever dated anyone other than Pansy?"
"Well I'm not rooming with him, I'll just room with Blaise, not like McGonagall will know," Draco said, turning as if to go find Blaise.
Draco was cut off as Harry's fist connected with Draco's face and the next thing either of them knew, they were on the floor punching and hitting.
"Go to sleep, you're going to need it after all the alcohol," Harry murmured, he then bent down and pressed a soft kiss onto Draco's temple.
"Yeah, don't be late for your date," Pansy said.
"Yeah, but you seem to be really friendly."
Harry could feel everything, every bit of movement and when Draco grazed him with his thumb he came undone. His back arched almost completely off the bed and his fingers turned white as they twisted in the sheets, seeing stars as he came.
"Hey," Harry replied, taking in Draco's appearance, "You look nice."
"Climbed a tree," Draco muttered, and before anyone could question it he got up and excused himself to go to bed. Everyone followed his lead and Dean and Seams rounded up the alcohol before leaving.
---------------------------------------
"So where did you want to go today?" Harry said after coughing uncomfortably.
"No."
"Back to last names now Potter?" he couldn't help it, the use of his last name stung. He'd come and apologized, something he would never have done a year ago, and Harry was still angry; the thought made him frustrated. "In that case, I hope you remember I still know all the Slytherin prefects, I could easily get house points taken from you for being out past curfew and turn you in for having an invisibility cloak."
Narcissa was just finishing her eggs when Harry realized that everyone at Ron's house might be worried and looking for him. He didn't even know what time it was, if it was still early they probably weren't up, but who really knows. He had no way to know what time it was, he didn't know if the Malfoy family was early risers or not, so he couldn't even base a guess on that. He hadn't even seen outside yet today, so he couldn't judge it by how bright it was out either.
"Last I checked, it was," Draco smirked, "you were the one that kissed me if I remember correctly."
"Why?" Harry said; he had thought that it had been going very well between them.
"Don't worry, your candy addiction is safe with me."
"Is this how it's always going to be?"
"Stop calling him that," Harry said, returning Draco's glare. And we're back, Hermione thought, giving a slight sigh as she realized that it was too much to hope for that they might mellow out a bit.
October 5, 1998
"Answer."
"Of course," Ginny said, reaching out and grabbing Luna's hand.
"A few yes, but nothing giant and no one knew it was me. I just got fed up with some of the people in my house sometimes," Draco responded.
"Fine, I suppose it'd be better than Potter staring at me for another half hour." Harry shot Draco a look and Hermione couldn't help the faint smirk that crossed her face; even if both Draco and Harry were denser than rock, she certainly wasn't.
The bathroom door opened then and a soft light filled the room and Draco's eyes shot closed. Draco could hear the soft sound of Harry's steps as he crossed the room.
“Good on you,” Ginny said, giving Harry a smile.
"Mmhmm," Ron mumbled next to him and Harry shot him a glare.
"Draco?" Hermione questioned, her eyebrow raised a bit at him. Harry blushed, it was the first time he'd called him Draco in front of anyone. They were on a first name basis now, sure, but Harry hadn't actually called him Draco when it wasn't just the two of them.
"Spin the bottle," Pansy supplied, "Now hurry up and join the circle!"
"Where is our room," Harry said with a resigned sigh as Draco made a weird sound.
"Of course, thanks!"
Draco glanced at Harry and quickly looked away and reached for his silverware, cutting into the eggs on his plate and eating silently. Harry did the same but couldn't help but feel nervous. No one had said anything about the elephant in the room and it felt like he and Draco were currently sitting on cracked glass.
"So you'll pull one with me?" Harry asked excitedly.
Draco slowly pulled away to remove their masks, and casted them to the side and took in Harry's flushed face. Draco let his hands brush down his sides until he found the bottom of Harry's shirt (thank god he didn't wear one of those super complicated costumes like most of the others, Draco thought.) Draco reached his hands under the hem and ran them up the bare skin of Harry's stomach. Harry gasps and Draco takes the chance to brush his tongue against Harry's.
"Says you." Draco stuck his tongue out at Harry, "Oh very mature of you."
"Yeah, sorry about that," Draco smiled back, one of his soft smiles that seemed to be reserved for just Harry.
"Can you go get the Alihotsy leaves from the pantry? We need more than I have in my potion kit," Draco asked.
"Oh come on, why would I listen if there are much more interesting things to pay attention to."
Herbology was his second class of the day and by the time he got there he was well and truly annoyed.
"Alright, I'm okay now," Draco said, leaning back and wiping his eyes, "I want to get it over with."
"No problem, we have lots where that came from," Seamus laughed.
"Hey."
"I told you that I had to be with Draco for two hours today for the punishment," Harry laughed.
"There you are!" Hermione jumped up from the table, Ron groaned at her voice as it sent another round of pain rocking through his skull.
"Malfoy," Harry said, ready to just have the impending argument over with.
Harry felt Draco's lips brush against his neck as he spoke, growing more and more aware of how Draco was affecting him. He felt his neck grow warm.
“You’re not slick Harry, you can’t just hold someone’s hand in public and not expect anyone to notice,” Hermione replied, rolling her eyes, “Ron’s right, you really are helpless.”
"Oh hey Harry," Ginny said giving him a smile as he finally caught up.
Ginny saw him first and with a deep breath, tugged Luna along after her.
“I guess.”
When Harry returned, they headed down to the pitch together and found a seat in the stands near a group of students that looked like first years.
"And that's a problem now? Cause you didn't care when I told you I like girls," Pansy shot back.
Ron let out a relieved sigh and Ginny gave him a funny look, "Oh thank god. You had me worried for a moment, I thought you were going to tell me something horrible. You didn't really think I would care did you?"
I have four more stories that I'll be posting here now that this one is completed, so look out for those. They'll be titled “This One Hot Day”, “Halloween at Hogwarts”, "How to Anger a Malfoy," and “Summer Vacation.” All four are one shots.
"We should probably go down before Weasley comes up here looking for you," Draco chuckled.
"Exactly, it's part of the game," Seamus added, the shit-eating grin that had crossed his face when Harry was dared to kiss Draco still there.
"Thanks." Harry guided Draco down some back roads then, they had been aimlessly making their way through the streets and ended up down some alleyway when Draco had an idea.
"Alright," Harry said with a smile, reminded of when they'd work on homework together when they first got assigned their punishment by McGonagall. Now though, they were doing it as a study date and Harry couldn't be any happier.
"I've said it a million times: I. Don't. Like. Him."
Hermione was down reading in the common room when she heard a loud thud followed by a bunch of yelling which could only mean one thing: Harry and Malfoy where at it again.
"I'll be fine," Pansy said and Blaise shook his head.
"Stop messing it up worse. I refuse to believe that running a comb through it would make it worse than it already is," Draco huffed. "Go get your comb and let me try."
"Alright if you say so," Hermione said, giving him a questioning look as she turned back around to join the conversation.
"Chocolate Frogs and Bertie Bott's Every Flavour Beans." Harry reached out to a shelf and grabbed a package of Fizzing Wizzbees for Ron.
Harry and Draco had made a decision at the beginning of the year to set aside their differences and try a shot at being friends. This novel idea shocked Ron and pleased Hermione, but eventually Ron and Draco settled on a grudging friendship and they bonded over teasing Harry. Of course, both Ron and Hermione have been ignorant that there had been feelings other than friendship blooming, and Harry and Draco liked it that way. They both could hang out whenever, Hermione and Ron never questioning it. In fact, Hermione constantly praised Harry on putting their tiffs in the past and creating inter-house friendships; never once did she ever assume he might be getting something more than a quidditch buddy out of it.
“Then why didn’t you kiss him back?” Ron said and Hermione rolled her eyes.
Draco sucked in a breath at the sudden proximity. He could feel Harry's breath ghosting over his lips, and his wrists were still being held by Harry. "I would," he said, just above a whisper. Harry was silent for a moment and Draco couldn't help noticing the way Harry's eyebrows furrowed just slightly as he contemplated his next words.
"One...Two...Three"
Harry's hands go back to Draco's shirt as he tried, again, to take it off; Draco leaned back and pulled it off for him. Harry reached forward to run his hands across Draco's abdomen and chest, his touches feeling like fire on Draco's skin.
"How about a truce?" Harry said and held out his hand.
"What's the matter?! Harry, it's two in the afternoon! One would think you died, you missed breakfast and then also lunch," Hermione berated Harry. "Do you plan on getting up any time today?"
When they finished Harry paid for both of their drinks and they left where Harry spotted Hermione and Ron across the street. He cast a quick tempus and when the time showed 12:30 he muttered "oh crap."
-------------------------------------------
"Maybe she would've given you some if you weren't so mean to her."
"And what would we use to make said fort? We really don't have that many pillows and blankets."
"Then what's your worry?"
Draco saw Harry looking around the room uncomfortably, "Yeah, I know. I don't like this room much either. Let me show you the gardens since we have some time, you'll like them a lot better."
Realization dawned on Ron's face and his mouth made an 'ohhh' soundlessly and lifted his own glass to his lips.
Harry only tugged on Draco's underwear in response. Draco lifted his hips up to allow him to remove the offending article and sucked in a breath when the cold air assaulted him. Harry was back between his legs quickly though and soon Draco was back to wishing Harry would stop teasing him.
------------------------
"Oh stop being dramatic, none of us are dating anyone. I don't like Neville like that and Draco's too chicken to tell Potter he likes him."
"Well, not like there's much to do this late anyway unless you're dating someone," Harry said and then blushed a deep red when his eyes met Draco's before turning away quickly.
Blaise stared down at him, momentarily shocked that he even worked up the courage to kiss him. "I'm sure you didn't ruin everything," Blaise said, "It's Potter, he'd forgive the Dark Lord if he apologized nicely enough." Draco laughed a bit, a choking sort of laugh, like he couldn't quite get enough air. "And you're not an idiot for showing him how you feel."
"Sorry, Professor," Harry said, making his way to his desk quickly, Draco following, "We overslept, it won't happen again."
"Great! Now go to your room, I bet Potter is waiting for you!" Pansy smirked as she dodged a stinging hex.
"You two realize my class started over thirty minutes ago, yes?" Professor Slughorn asked, taking in their ruffled appearances.
"I said, why don't you go talk to him? Do you think he's up to something again like in sixth year? 'Cause if so, I want you to stop entertaining that thought right here and just go talk to him."
"It makes perfect sense. You're just an idiot."
Harry,
"What?" Draco asked, not following.
Harry bobbed his head and Draco's hands flew to his hair, tugging on the messy locks. Harry could feel when he was close by the way a shudder ran through him and his hands tightened in his hair and his thighs shuttered. When Harry was pretty sure he was about to come he let go.
"Okay what's first on your long list of stores you want to shop at this time?" Harry said with a bit of a teasing tone to his voice. Draco scowled back at him, but it didn't hold the same amount of venom as it would have held a week ago.
"Nah, I don't think so at least. Haven't figured out how to, if I am able to."
Hermione sighed and sat back in the cushions, crossing her arms over her chest and looking at the fire as it burned in the grate. "I'm worried about him. He's been acting funny, and I think something happened between him and Malfoy.
"I also like you, a lot. I want to try being your boyfriend too, if you'll let me."
"He could wait," Harry said, leaning up to kiss Draco again. Draco pulled away from him slightly.
Ron Weasley — keeper
That was when he knew that he was definitely not straight and needed to talk to Ginny.
"Yeah, yeah, but the first point doesn't determine the game!" Harry shot back.
“And if he tears it up?”
Ron was seated at a table in the three broomsticks, waiting for Hermione to return from the restroom when Ginny and Luna entered.
"For once I agree with Weasley," Draco said, his lips turning up. "Pansy, you can't be serious."
Pansy nodded her head at that, accepting this as a perfectly valid excuse.
"There you are, finally. I thought you were going to be with Malfoy all day," Ron complained
"Hey, calm down. You could go to Madam Pomfrey and ask for some pain killers."
"It's fine, Hermione, I keep good track of it."
"I was an idiot," Draco mumbled into Blaise's chest, "I kissed him and he ran away." Draco choked back a sob. "I was stupid and ruined everything."
"I'm not scared. Malfoys don't bottom."
It rounded to a stop in front of Ron, "What are the odds you'll swap shirts with Hermione?" Ginny grinned when Ron's face flushed as he looked over at what Hermione was wearing. Hermione had on a pretty, flowery, tight, top. It was something Ron wouldn't be caught dead in. Hermione gave a laugh at the look on Ron's face and counted down from three.
Both Draco and Harry were dead drunk though and without a second thought Harry was over in front of Draco and kissing him, in less than a second.
“I know, I’m just not good at this,” Harry said, forehead creased in concentration.
"Nothing bad, but Hermione, Ron and I are pretty sure we know what the colors mean now."
"Um- yeah?"
Harry jumped a bit, "Yes! Thanks!" Draco watched in amusement as Harry hurried to grab his scarf and jacket.
“Okay, say you’re right, why didn’t he ask me then? He knows I like him. Even if I hadn’t literally kissed him, he can literally see me glowing.”
"How about because we're roommates then, why don't we try and be friends because we're roommates."
Harry woke up shivering and his back hurt. He tried to sit up and when he couldn't he looked down to see Draco was laying across his chest. Harry had slid down the wall over night and Draco's head had fallen off Harry's shoulder as a result.
"Just checking," Harry laughed.
Hermione looked up at Harry's face to gauge a reaction over Ron's outburst, and her suspicions were confirmed when she saw the sad look in his eyes as he stared after Ron. Hermione sighed.
"Then, on the count of three both person A and B say a number from 1 to 10 and if the number is the same, person B must do what person A said."
----------------------------------
Harry laughed at that and then laughed even harder when he caught sight of Draco's completely disgusted face, "Don't worry, we're not going there. I hate it too," he got out around his laughter and Draco felt relieved.
"I guess we can't put off the inevitable huh...." Harry said trailing off and looking down at his plate again as if it held the answers. When it seemed like he wasn't going to be continuing that sentence, Pansy let out another scoff and rolled her eyes turning to Ron and Hermione.
As it turned out, luck was on his side and he made it down the stairs and outside without anyone waking. He turned in place as soon as he made it onto the lawn and with a crack he was gone.
They took it really well, Harry thought, maybe I could talk to them, they might be able to help. But what if I end up not being gay, I don't really want to cause a stir if I'm not...
"Dare," she said with a look on her face that said she was ready for any kind of dare he threw her way.
"Easy," Ginny replied, getting down onto her knees and putting her face up to the cup. Grabbing the rim of the cup with her mouth, she tilted her head back and downed it all in one gulp, before setting it back down on the carpet.
"You won't get hurt or die, I promise."
When Filch finally passed and they couldn't hear his footsteps anymore, Harry turned towards Draco with that lop-sided grin that he loved so much and he couldn't help himself. Draco pressed Harry into the wall and captured his lips. Harry sighed into the kiss, his hands coming up to tangle in Draco's hair. Draco kissed Harry with a fervor that rivaled their kiss in the woods.
“I told you, I was nervous and didn’t know what to do! I was also kind of freaking out!” Harry threw his arms up and some people around the common room were starting to look over and give them weird looks so he dropped his voice level again, “If he kissed me again now, I wouldn’t shove him away!”
Draco glanced over at Harry, he was a lot better at sneaking glances than he was and hadn't been caught yet. What would my mom say about this if she knew, Draco thought to himself. He wondered if she'd care, or if she'd lose her mind over it, like his father would be sure to do. He figured it'd be the latter.
Draco noticed the book she was holding then, "Oh, is that Cushing's new book?" Draco said excitedly.
"Alright, who is going first? I went first last time, someone's got to step up!" said Pansy as soon as everyone was seated.
December 5, 1998
"Of course it's be your house color," Harry rolled his eyes and let out a laugh, Draco didn't bother to correct him.
"The detention would have been better," Draco mumbled.
"Ahh that makes sense," Seamus said leading back and smirking.
"Oh come on, how much longer are you going to continue pretending you don't fancy him?"
Harry felt his appetite return as he looked around the room taking in all the colors. It still hurt his head a bit, but it was definitely bearable now. Up at the front McGonagall glowed blue and he wished he knew what it all meant.
Of course, everyone was on board with this game.
Halloween was here at Hogwarts and the eighth years had decided to throw a party, no younger students allowed, especially since about every table was covered in alcohol.  It was fun and all, but there had been one thing bothering Harry:
He looked up when he heard noise from the stairs to see Hermione and Ron heading down.
"You're going to give yourself a heart attack with all that sugar," Draco mused, following behind Harry towards the register as he picked up a couple things for himself.
Harry gave him a sheepish look, “Sorry.”
"And what were we planning on doing?" Draco shot back sarcastically, hoping that maybe if he acted normal, even if Potter heard something he'd let it go.
It was completely silent the whole way which was mostly Draco's fault in Harry's opinion as he usually refused to talk at all but he had to admit that it was also sort of his fault as well as he didn't exactly try and make conversation.
During his free period in the afternoon he managed to run into Hermione, quite literally.
Sandbanks beach was busy but blessedly not too crowded when they arrived. Harry seemed amused by the amount of sunblock Draco had to slather on before going shirtless in the sun. He teased him about being a vampire but obliged in helping him with his back regardless. At long last, they had reached the water and Draco was pleased to discover he had been right about Harry's reaction. Harry seemed awestruck by the infinite horizon stretching into the endless sky and the waves forever rolling in from eternity.
“That isn’t my problem. I didn’t ask for any of this!” He growled, jabbing his wand so violently the cushion tore down the middle.
“You do?” Pansy took a grateful gulp of her mixed drink as soon as the bartender set it down, already placing an order for a second.
Pansy smoothed her skirt as she walked into the brightly lit pub and glanced around. There was no telling where he might be. She went straight to the bar and was about to order a drink when an amused voice on her left demanded her attention.
“Cheers then,” Fred grinned. “We’re in love with you too, Harry.”
“Are you alright?” Granger asked in concern as she sat back down next to Pansy.
“I have my ways.” She winked slyly before grabbing her magazine and slipping away.
“He will be happy to hear that. You should invite him over for tea to thank him." Hermione's tone was much too innocent.
He was all alone. Lily and James, now Sirius. Peter was worse than dead. He was the only one left. He sank to his knees in front of the veil, bowing his head as his tears overflowed.
“Thank you for coming.” Draco met Harry’s eyes and flushed when he shot him a knowing smirk.
Not being forced to socialize? There was no way he could pass that up. Besides, the painting was rubbish. This bet was practically already won.
“What, seriously?” Ron looked flabbergasted and Harry couldn’t help but laugh.
“Merlin’s balls, Harry.” Draco went pale. “I’m sorry- I didn’t realize…” Draco took a deep breath. “It seems I owe you a rather large apology.”
“Oh, I think she would have loved Luna.” Andromeda set out all the makings for a proper tea.
“A sense of humor and actually caring? That describes over half the population on the entire bloody planet. Hardly a valid reason to like anyone.” Draco seemed insulted.
He was spared trying to make strained small chat by Draco emerging from the back. As soon as Potter caught sight of him he visibly relaxed.
“I don’t think so. I would like to run through Act II scene 3 with Riddle Senior and the Gaunts conspiring to hunt our happy couple down, but you and Harry are free to go.” She said as she shuffled through her notes.
“I think ‘Draco’ will do for now.” He gave Seamus a half-smile.
He blinked and stared at his coffee table in groggy confusion. The box and tea tray from last night were gone. In their place was a coffee carafe, teapot, and two mugs with a piece of parchment placed between them. He frantically cast his mind back, trying to remember if he had locked his door last night. Not that burglars would make him coffee after robbing him, but it was worrying all the same. A vague memory of locking up before stargazing with Harry surfaced and he breathed a sigh of relief. It must have been his mother or Pansy. They were the only two people with spare keys.
The look Draco gave him made Harry’s heart stutter.
“He doesn’t like electricity?” He questioned, glancing at the table waterfall Hermione was holding. It was beautiful, but sure enough, it had a plug.
"Too right." Seamus nodded eagerly. "Oi, we should go on a double before the next pub night."
“I don’t have to put up with you, it’s a genuine pleasure to be your friend.” She insisted. “I can’t believe we wasted our school years hating each other. Imagine the study guides we could have made!”
“Oh, this is much more you.” Draco breathed as he entered a grand entryway with a spiral staircase dominating the room.
"Draco…" he placed a trembling hand beneath his chin and forced him to meet his gaze. "I'm in love with you, Draco. Have been for years at this point. Just. Please…"
“Erm, which one is the teal one?”
“Not at all.” Draco finally tore his eyes off the moving pods and gave Harry a nervous smile. “I’ve just never been this close before.”
She would have to ask Arimere if he had worked calming charms into the walls. If he had she would beg him to teach her how. She knew of a nameless ex-death eater that could certainly use some calming charms in his new home.
He sipped his drink moodily, appreciating the buzz that had settled over him about two-thirds of the way in. He was just starting to think that this party wasn't quite as bad as the last one when he looked across the pool and almost dropped his drink. Draco was laughing with Theodore Nott and Pansy Parkinson. Hermione hadn’t said anything about them coming to the party. Although once he thought about it, he remembered that Parkinson had become an Unspeakable. That explained her presence here, but not Draco's.
“Healer Grey was adamant I take her cases.”
“Merlin, I-” Draco pinched the bridge of his nose and took a deep breath. “No, that is not what I’m talking about. Magical power is something you’re born with. Sometimes it can run in families, but mostly it’s determined by your personal potential. Surely you’ve noticed that Hermione is much more powerful than the Weasel, yes? She can perform spells that he couldn’t hope to attempt in his dizziest daydreams?”
The sound of the front door opening and closing was followed by an unnatural silence, broken only by Kreacher's muttering.
“I- wait, what?” Harry blinked in surprise.
“You wish.” George laughed.
They moved from room to room, repeating the process over and over again. Harry and Bill would chant and circle the room and Draco would hover in the doorway, ready to jump in if need be. They stumbled upon a few dark artifacts and Bill had to perform a powerful bit of curse breaking in the room the Dark Lord had used as his bedroom, but the two men took everything in stride and didn’t need Draco to step in once. Draco had been somewhat anxious when they went into his old bedroom, unsure of what they might find. Other than his bed and desk, however, the room was empty and devoid of any traces of dark magic. Harry seemed oddly pleased by that fact and Draco tried not to read too much into it.
"Oftly confident Gryffindor would win, huh?" Draco remarked, taking in the decorations.
He was met with a long pathway lined with stone and water features that lead out to what was clearly the green house. He couldn't help but think about just how much money had been put into the greenhouse, let alone the rest of the house.
Somewhere in the back of his mind told him this was important, that something wasn't right with this information. His head was spinning though and he felt sluggish and tired.
Harry watched his retreating form from the bed and then realized he was still in Draco's bed and hurried to get up and start getting dressed. He was supposed to take a shower but he decided he'd just take one tonight because he didn't think he could handle seeing Draco again when he came out. He spelled his teeth clean and hurried out the door where he met Hermione and Ron.
"Yeah, you're probably right," Hermione sighed, plopping down onto their usual spot on the couch in front of the fire.
"Thought you'd be more hungover too," Harry smiled.
"'Mione, they're in June. It's only December," Harry said incredulously.
"That's a map? There's nothing on it."
He was too far gone to care about it though.
Draco woke up at nine on Saturday, two hours before he was supposed to meet up with Harry.
After a couple minutes of that Harry let out a sigh and Draco turned to look at him.
"For Gryffindors, yes."
"You did though, all shocked and surprised. I don't get to see you show emotion very often," Harry got closer then, his mouth near Draco's ear and Draco was turning red.
Forcing his eyes forward Harry decided he had to ask Draco to the Yule ball.
Harry broke away surprised, "Wait really?"
"You have to hang out with Malfoy?? She can't make you do that!" Ron sputtered indignantly as they made their way down the corridor towards the Great Hall.
“Yeah, at the least he’ll be curious and open it,” Ron said, “It’s in his nature, he’s kind of a busy body.” When Harry glared at him he put his hands up in mock surrender, “Hey, I’m just telling the truth.”
"Hmmmm... I haven't really even thought about that actually," Ginny replied, looking over at Hermione, "think you all will have your own dormitories? Or maybe the dormitories will expand?"
"I dare you to take the pitcher of water over there and dump in over your head, the whole thing," Hermione quickly cast a spell to protect the carpet from the water that was soon to come. She only felt a twinge of guilt at the thought of the dare, it felt a bit like a way to get back at her for dating Ron and acting like a git about it to her. Lavender looked at Hermione a bit dumbfounded for a moment and then quickly walked over to get the pitcher off the table, wanting to get the dare over quickly.
His mind was still reeling over the turn of events though. First Dean and Seamus are dating, then Harry seems to like Draco, then Hermione might be gay...
Dean Thomas — chaser
"Hey!" Harry half heartedly protested, but Draco continued.
Hermione simply nodded.
"You're so beautiful, you know that," Draco said, slowly slipping another finger into him.
"We were fighting. If you hadn't done it I would have done much worse to you."
"If I were to ask someone out, I'd make it clear I meant a date," Pansy drawled, "so it is kind of your fault." Blaise snickered.
"We should probably head inside," Draco said between breaths after a moment.
"Well, thank you," Draco said, reaching out and gently giving Harry's hand a squeeze.
"Why not? There's nothing that says we can't use it for parties," Ron said, "It's the room of requirement Hermione, we can use it for anything we require."
"It's all about momentum," Draco said, "And by scoring the first point, we have a lot."
-----------------------
"Huh? Oh- yeah I'm good, I'm happy for you two," Harry gave them a smile and Hermione looked at him funny when everyone returned to eating.
"Well, we think that they all have to do with your romantic feelings. Like, red means you love someone, pink a crush, blue you don't currently like anyone, and green means aromantic or something. Green was Hermione's idea."
“Are you going to sit with me at dinner?” Harry asked.
"Thanks!" Hermione replied. Harry watched her walk over to the table and started to zone out again, but he didn't get much more thinking done, as a hand was placed on his shoulder once again.
"Common room?" Harry said as he came up behind Draco who was hiding at the back of the library with Pansy and Blaise as usual.
The feeling of pride quickly fled as he noticed Draco walking out of the bathroom: face slightly red and the towel wrapped around his upper chest. Harry's attention was immediately stolen by Draco and he felt slightly disappointed that Draco had the towel so high. Harry followed Draco with his eyes as Draco went over to his bed and quickly rounded up his night clothes and returned to the bathroom.
"Both," Seamus responded with a laugh.
"How can you still not be bored with the book? You've been reading it for over an hour!" Harry groaned and flopped back onto the bed.
“What time even is it?” Harry asked, Draco already casting a tempus.
"Harry and Draco," Dean snickered as Seamus wore a shit-eating grin and flipped the coin.
On Monday, Harry found her after classes finally ended for the day, he decided he needed to talk to her and the sooner the better.
"Yeah, very," Ron laughed.
"Unlike you, I watch where I'm going. I don't slam into others, though I'm sure you are just used to bumping into others, living at the Weasley's cramped house all summer. That's where you were for the summer, I'm sure," he knew if Pansy where around she'd only say that that comment proved her point as who would pay such good attention to Potter to know where he was for the summer unless he cared about him, but right now Draco didn't care, "with so many kids, much more than they have the money to afford things must have been cramped-"
Once everyone was back on the ground and in the locker room Harry stood in front of them to hand out the quidditch schedule. "Our first match is against Ravenclaw in just over two weeks, so no slacking on practice. While it's just for fun, it's still good to play your best and make it a good match."
"You're going to steal pillows. from the common room?" Harry asked incredulously.
Draco wasn't in bed with Harry when he awoke the next morning, and he felt a little sad until the bathroom door opened and he was rewarded with the sight of Draco in a bath towel. The towel was wrapped around his upper chest again, and he couldn't help but feel a little disappointed.
"It was good. My parents are still working on unpacking their things here, so I helped a lot with that. All our decorations were in boxes still," Hermione said with a laugh.
Draco looked up from where he was playing with his hands in his lap to meet Harry's eyes, "Green," he blurted out without thinking and when Harry laughed, his face went red.
"I can only imagine what sharing a dorm with them for six years was like," Draco grumbled, he didn't seem very intimidating though with the blush coating his cheeks.
"What are the odds of you dying Gregory's hair orange right now, while he's sleeping," Draco announced and when Seamus and him both said ten, Seamus gathered up his wand and the group followed him silently up the stairs to Gregory's and Neville's dorm.
"Yes, headmaster," they both said in unison.
Draco unbuttoned Harry's pants and pulled them down, revealing his erection straining against his boxers. Draco felt and saw him shudder as Draco pulled his underwear down as well, causing him some much needed friction. Draco leaned forward as he brought his hand to Harry's erection. Draco stroked him a few times as he kissed along his collar bone. At this point Harry was a moaning and panting mess, arching into Draco's hand. Standing up a bit, Draco leaned up to sink his teeth into Harry's skin right above his collarbone as he rubbed his thumb over the tip of Harry's erection.
"You figured something out didn't you," Harry said as him and Pomfrey made it to the infirmary to find Snape and McGonagall already there.
"I just said I don't like him!" Darco shouted glaring at Blaise.
How innocent is he exactly, Blaise thought to himself with a smile, "Never mind."
Ernie Macmillan — beater
"It's still October."
"Professor Sprout said not to water it!"
"Later," he chuckled, "We should go down now."
“Maybe he chickened out, this is Potter we’re talking about here.”
"Uh- yeah, yeah. 'Course, sorry," Harry shook his head and followed Ron to the Gryffindor table, mentally scolding himself for thinking like that, about Malfoy of all people.
"Stop just-" Draco groaned and then Harry's mouth was suddenly on him. "Oh god-" Draco moaned, throwing his head back down on the pillow, his fingers twisting into the sheets.
"Hey did you take the potion Pomfrey gave you, today?" Hermione asked, watching as Harry poked at his food.
"Maybe you could rope the Gryffindor team into letting you practice with them one day," Hermione joked.
"Bye," Harry said. He waited until everyone had gone except Draco before grabbing his bag and tossing it over his shoulder.
Ron looked down at her as she turned so she was facing him.
"Yeah, but it's just not the same, you know?" Ron said, grabbing Hermione's hand as he stood up.
Slytherin didn't win, much to Draco's chagrin.
"I love you too," Draco sighed, leaning completely into Harry's touch, letting himself enjoy the closeness. A year ago, he would have never let himself enjoy this, would never have said yes to bathing with another guy, would never have let Harry Potter kiss him. Draco allowed himself to savor the feeling now though. The way Harry's lips felt as they traveled up his neck and over his shoulder blades. The way Harry's hands wrapped found their way to his stomach, and pulled Draco further towards himself. Harry was gentler and softer than he'd ever thought and he loved every second of it.
The fire was warm and Draco was drowsy. Not even twenty minutes after sitting down, his eyes were struggling to stay open and the book was slipping from his fingers.
“It’s alright,” Draco rubbed his hand down from the top of his shoulder - where it was currently resting - to his upper arm, “Let’s take a break for tonight anyway. It’s getting late and my feet are sore.”
Harry followed Draco mindlessly to their usual spot at the top of the astronomy tower. "I figured you could use some fresh air."
"Hey, what's up?"
"Former. You aren't anymore, and it wasn't your choice." Draco gave him a sad smile.
Harry didn't reply, just shook his head in understanding. A moment passed in silence as Draco kept his eyes squarely on the mandrakes. "Sorry, that kind of ruined the moment didn't it?" Draco laughed awkwardly, "It's not all bad though, Blaise and Longbottom are making wolfsbane potion to give out to the people who were bitten during the war and I get to provide them with more wolfsbane for them to use. People wouldn't take the potion with my name attached to it, but Blaise stayed mostly neutral and of course Longbottom was well known for being against the Dark Lord, so people would actually take it coming from them."
"Yeah? Then try and explain why you're shaking like a leaf," he said, leaning his head to look into Harry's eyes.
When they arrived, Ron and Hermione were already seated at the table.
Harry trailed his lips down to Draco's jaw line, moving to gently brush his lips against Draco's neck when he shifted his head up, giving Harry more access. Draco let out a shaky breath when Harry let his teeth graze his neck, his breath catching in his throat as Harry lightly bit down. When Harry pulled back to capture Draco's lips again, Draco's head was fuzzy, all previous jealousy long forgotten.
“What did you do?” Draco asks when Harry sets down their plates on the table.
Ron looked up when Ginny arrived at the table. "Oh hey Ginny, Luna. How are you guys?"
He shifted his head to the side a bit to take in Draco's sleeping form next to him. He hadn't slept in his own bed since then and his favorite part was getting to wake up every morning to Draco's bed head and his face shoved in his neck.
Everyone stared at him, speechless. Draco had never felt more proud of himself.
"Uh- I was looking for Malfoy," Harry said from the door looking equal parts nervous and suspicious, he hadn't missed them slamming the notebook shut.
"We're still stuck together," Harry replied, "friends? I'm sick of dancing around one another," Harry stuck out his hand.
-------------------------
"Sorry, sorry. Want me to get Pansy? I'm sure she'll bring some alcohol. The best remedy for a broken heart."
He was also wondering how long Draco had liked him for, if Draco had thought he liked him back, if he did like Draco back.
Draco woke up the next morning to a knock on his door and he quickly looked down to find Harry there where they'd fallen asleep the night before. They were both still naked and there was no way he could claim they were only friends. There was no way he could possibly talk his way out of this.
"You will, we'll go ahead of you so that you can mope in peace though," Blaise said with a snicker as he and Pansy headed out the doors and into the mass of students in the hall. Draco tried to follow and soon found himself bumping into none other than Potter.
"I don't know- wait what? I'm not worried about that!"
Draco gestured to Harry's armful of candy, "Every time we've come here you've gotten an arm-load of candy."
"Great idea, Pansy," Hermione said, "I'll explain how you play it for everyone. One person spins a bottle and the person it lands on has to do a truth or dare - they get to choose which - and the person who spun gives them their truth or dare. If the person doesn't want to answer or do the dare, they have to take a shot of firewhisky," Hermione shot a look at Seamus who looked too smug for her taste, "Everyone understand?" Everyone nodded in the affirmative.
Love you,
“Wortcher, Harry.” She flashed him a sad smile as she helped him up, handing him the cloak. “We better get out of here quickly or we will be well on our way back to London.”
Draco just stared at him. He couldn't think of a damn thing to say. He wouldn't lie to Theo. Not about this. But the truth was too harsh to voice. As the silence grew longer and louder Theo's expression shifted. It went from open and honest to withdrawn and constricted.
“Draco.” Harry sneered and Draco flinched. “You went to school with him. What weaknesses does he have that we can exploit?”
“Like I should be dead.” He said flatly, wrapping his arms around Theo’s shoulders. “What happened to Potter?”
“You didn’t think I was going to just leave you like that, did you?” He smiled sadly.
“So do we.” Ron snorted, passing Dean and Seamus their glasses. “Drink up!”
Draco shook his head fondly before ducking into the kitchen and getting all the makings of a proper tea set up. He sat down at the table while he waited for it to boil, pulling the sketchbook and charcoal set Harry had given him for his birthday closer. He opened it to the half-finished sketch of the ocean he had done and started to add more detail. Charcoal was a new medium and he found that he quite enjoyed experimenting with it. He was just about done outlining when the shrill whistle of the kettle broke his concentration. He abandoned the drawing reluctantly, promising himself he would finish it this weekend. He poured the scalding water into his beautiful teapot before sloshing it around to warm the pot before dumping it out. He grabbed three sachets of Earl Grey Imperial and let them steep in the fresh water, automatically relaxing at the comforting scent. He had learned long ago that casting a warming charm on the pot will do in a pinch, the best tea was made by hand.
“She killed Voldemort’s most loyal follower, her own sister, during the final battle.” A brief flash of pain spasmed across Narcissa’s face and Harry's heart ached for her. Icy blue locked onto emerald green and Harry was trapped.
"Confess what?" Harry's voice was velvet in his ear.
"Your godson is coming here?" Draco queried from behind his own steaming mug full of rich-smelling coffee.
Draco reached up, holding onto Greg with one arm. Harry grabbed onto him, but they were too heavy. Draco’s hand slipped from his grasp and he pulled back around.
“Do you think we’ll be able to get a pod to ourselves?” Draco tried to lighten the mood.
Harry made an effort to explain what he should expect at the cinema while they walked to an apparation point, but nothing could have prepared him for the immensity of it. The sun was setting and the massive building struck an imposing figure against the blazing orange and powder blue sky. Harry didn’t seem to be intimidated by the sheer size of the theater, waltzing right up to a strange booth-type thing encased in glass. He greeted the person that appeared to be trapped inside cheerfully and then turned to ask Draco’s opinion on which movie they should see.
"Not broken, just coping?" Harry's heart felt a little less heavy at the prospect.
“I’m sorry.” Harry huffed, fidgeting with his glass. “It’s unfair and I wish there was something I could do to fix it.”
Rage.
“Terribly sorry, where are my manners?” Ari blushed and cleared his throat before squaring his shoulders and trying again. “Welcome to Arimere’s Art, I’m Arimere. How may I assist you today, sir?”
“What do you mean this is just the beginning?” Draco gave him a suspicious glare.
"Yeah, alright." Harry nodded.
“That’s it! You just need to get lucky, Harry!” Ron’s face glowed with excitement of having figured something out.
“Tonight, but I haven’t had time to plan anything.” Harry groaned. “I have no idea what I’m going to do.”
“Yeah, but I’m normally much more observant than that. How did you suss it out, Pans?” Theo stretched and settled his arm around Draco’s other shoulder. The biting cold seemed to lessen as he huddled into his friend’s body heat.
“Thank you, Mr.Malfoy. You may step down from the stand.” Shacklebolt cut off the incessant buzzing of the Wizengamot.
“NO!”
“Er, not exactly.” Harry gave him a shy smile. “I wanted to do something nice for your birthday as a kind of ‘thank you' for helping me with all of the wizarding culture tutoring. I figured showing you some muggle culture would be a fair trade, but I didn’t think we would be spending the entire day together so Canterbury Cathedral is where the official planning ended.”
He had thought Draco was interested in him too.
“Alright.” He agreed against his better judgment “What are we betting?”
It was in that moment he realized Harry might actually win this war.
“You can’t save my mother. The Dark Lord...he has her under the Imperius curse. He never lets her out of his sight.” Draco wanted to break eye contact but the eerie blue held silver and he could not look away. An expression of dawning comprehension spread over the old man’s face and Draco wanted to punch it right off of him.
"It was a combination of things, in the end." Draco sighed, "Pansy gave me a talking to after I pushed you into the pool. She called me an idiot and reminded me of the reason your words hurt my feelings in the first place. Then you literally run into me and offer to humiliate yourself for me. There was no way I could have passed that up, but then… the look on your face when you were dancing with your eyes closed… I couldn't help myself. All of my anger and resentment just...vanished. I can't really explain it."
