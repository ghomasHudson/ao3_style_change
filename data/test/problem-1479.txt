“How about you allow me in, and I’ll personally make sure every item of clothing fits you perfectly,” Harry let out a groan and silver eyes sparkled as he allowed the room to let Draco enter.
“Mister Potter, welcome to the Malfoy manor,” with a wave of her hand Missus Malfoy led them towards where Harry assumed was dinner, her hand lingered with her husband as if calming him from a potential fit of rage.
Walking next to her Harry appreciated the manor in the different light. It was still early morning and the suns rays caught the morning dew that was still clinging to the plants. The grey tones that spread out along the hallways and rooms looked less dreary and Harry could easily see how elegant the manor truly was.
Pausing to collect his thoughts Harry felt calmer as he looked into the reassuring faces of both Draco and Blaise.
Pulling out his Herbology assignment Harry waved it over to Neville asking the boy if he wouldn’t mind looking over what he had written.
He toyed with the idea of going to Madam Pomfrey but immediately pushed the thought aside, he didn’t need to explain what had happened with the Headmaster. Groaning, he turned towards the only option he could think of.
“I had thought you’d be much longer,” Draco pulled his best friend out of the room roughly and pushed him down the hallway as Harry’s cheeks tinted pink, still unaccustomed to Blaise’s taunting.
“Is there something you wanted to talk about with me Harry?” her tone was light, and Harry had always appreciated that she lost the know-it-all demeanor when he needed for her to be open-minded.
Walking back towards the corridor he canceled the disillusionment spell and found the nearest bench to sit on.
Knocking softly on the door of the Potion Professor’s classroom Harry had half a mind to turn around but before he could make a move to leave the door swung open and black eyes were trained on him.
“I need to see Draco, please, please, can you take me to see him?” he felt as if he were babbling, the words seemed sluggish as they rolled off his tongue; the man sighed and Harry felt as the hand holding him gripped him tighter.
Harry spent the remainder of the day, and the following three days at the bookstore. ‘Hermione would be so proud,’ Harry thought dryly.
“Oh, hi Mister Evans!” she seemed flustered as she rushed to collect the papers on the floor, Harry noted that she had three pens sticking out from her bun on top her head. Reaching down he collected the few pages that had went his way.
“Aren’t as close? You left me Harry, you left Ron, you left everyone in Gryffindor, all for the slimy, Death Eater snakes that will likely hand you over to You-Know-Who, you’ve befriended people who would rather watch you die,” she hissed out and Harry felt the stirrings of his magic underneath his fingertips, a book shifted on a nearby shelf.
Blaise had got Harry a new broom kit despite that he wasn’t playing this year but Harry had appreciated it nonetheless, it was the latest kit and Harry was already itching to use it with his Firebolt, even Draco looked at him enviously.
“Oh, I wanted my portrait to be in the Hospital Wing,” something in his face must have shown his surprise as she smiled at him fondly.
“Ginny, I might have liked you at one point, but those feelings were replaced with a sisterly bond,” he said, knowing that it wasn’t what she wanted to hear.
“Sir?” his voice must have waivered because Draco’s hand was on his knee in an instant; Snape caught the movement and pressed his lips into a thin line.
“Relax Draco, your mate is just fine,” Harry peered up at Blaise curiously as Draco reached out and pulled him into his side, “I’ve seen what can happen here Zabini,” drawled Draco and Harry looked towards Blaise with mild panic, the teen waved away his concern.
“Wow,” he took note at Lady Zabini’s longing look and the crestfallen expression that passed over Blaise’s features.
“I know that you boys have spent the day on a train and wish to retire for the evening, but I did have the house elves prepare a light meal we can take in the adjoining room,” pulled out of his trance Harry followed Blaise’s example and set his trunk down and followed the Lady of the manor as she turned and walked down the side hallway, her heels clicking with each step she took.
As they walked back into the study Harry watched as Mister Malfoy handed him and Draco a black robe and a mask, neither said anything as they put the garments on.
Dumbledore had been more reserved in the last few weeks than he had ever been. He’d wander the halls, nodding to students, but never really engaging with them. There were days he’d be absent from breakfast and lunch and arrive at dinner seemingly exhausted. Gossip spread through the halls that he was finding a way to defeat the Dark Lord, but Harry knew better, knew that the man so many trusted, was the enemy.
It was a strange sensation to share a bed with another person having never experienced it Harry had always believed that it would be uncomfortable, he had always enjoyed having his own space to sprawl out; but then and there, with Draco’s arms wrapped around him, Harry couldn’t imagine ever sleeping alone again.
“Yeah,” he whispered, dread settling in the pit of his stomach as his eyes traced his mock Transfiguration questions.
“I felt like I had Apparated, had gone through the Floo, I was standing in front of Borgin and Burkes and it was raining; people were passing by and I went straight through them. Then, I was whizzing through the buildings, down the streets, and I was in a house…” Harry felt the nausea creep back up as he remembered what happened next, “Inside the room was Tom strapped to a table, he was crying out for the Professor to stop, there was a magical orb above him and when I looked to see who he was talking too, it was Dumbledore. He was using his wand and cutting, what I assume, was Tom’s magical core,” clenching his eyes shut tight Harry breathed slowly out of his nostrils as the urge to vomit rose, he didn’t shrug away the hand that began to rub his shoulders lightly.
Screaming, Harry could barely hear the walls splinter and crack as the sound of rushing air around him consumed everything.
Yet as Dumbledore nodded his head as if confirming what she had said both Ginny and Parkinson looked pitifully between them, Ginny shedding a tear as she looked towards Hermione.
None of the books had any information on realistic dreams and what they could mean. Some passages indicated that he could be foreseeing his future life or that he was dying soon. The bookstore owner, Mister Spaulding, had finally introduced himself the second day that Harry had spent most of the day in his shop.
Peering up from where he’d been looking down at a spot on the table, Harry took a deep breath and then thrust out his hand. Malfoy seemed stunned but slowly extended out his own, Harry had been ready for the spark this time, so when their hands met, he didn’t jump, and neither did Malfoy.
It was Wednesday after dinner when Draco was finally able to leave the Hospital Wing. Harry had only been made aware of it as he witnessed a bunch of his housemates rushing around the common room in excitement while a few of the sixth years had gone to escort him down to the dungeons. He had always known that Draco was popular but watching the Slytherin’s drop their guard as one of their own returned solidified that belief.
Munching on a sandwich and flipping through his Charms textbook to the chapter on wards Harry spent the remainder of the evening reading up on the various wards and the techniques behind them, only succumbing to sleep as his eyes couldn’t stay open any longer.
Another turn and a spell hit the wall next to him causing the stone to shatter. Footsteps were getting closer and Harry hissed as a mild version of the cutting curse caught his shoulder; ignoring Esmelda’s gasp and the burning sensation as the blood trickled down his back Harry pointed his wand behind him and muttered
“ – and, Harry?” whipping his head around he looked at the concerned faces of his friends, shooting them a lopsided smile he shrugged off the oddity that was Ginny Weasley.
“Thanks for watching her Luna, she wouldn’t have been safe with me this summer,” nodding her head as if Harry told her something she already knew.
“Hmm,” was Draco’s only response as he went to the mirror and ran a brush through his hair, Harry noted that the blonde only did that when he was stressed.
“We’d like you to teach us the Dopplebeater Defense,” the boy on the left said, his brown eyes hadn’t left Harry’s and Harry choked on his bite.
“Welcome students,” Professor McGonagall paused, and gave one of her rare smiles, “when I call your name please come forward and have the hat placed on your head.”
He had expected Malfoy to confirm his suspicions, to use his Veela allure, but what he hadn’t expected was laughter.
“Well, that went as well as it could have,” Draco said, and without even looking at him Harry could feel the grin on his face.
“Has Hogwarts not taught the students about who founded the school? How has the head of the Slytherin house not shown my picture, taught my ideals,” the man muttered, and Harry furrowed his brows, founders?
“Harry enjoys fresh fruit, particularly strawberries. I think if he could he’d have a plate of fruit with each meal,” Draco mused, “I’m merely taking care of my mate, just like you have with mother. I vaguely remember you throwing a fit at cousin Atticus’ birthday because the seafood wasn’t the quality mother liked,” Harry watched as a smile pulled at Missus Malfoy’s lips, quickly concealed by her drink as her husband stabbed a part of his breakfast viciously so.
“Severus,” he said coolly and Harry elbowed him in the side, godfather or not, having an attitude right now wasn’t appropriate.
“Nott!” Draco snarled furiously having taken one look at Harry’s lack of clothing and how both boys wands were drawn. Harry was impressed that the Veela didn’t immediately attack his fellow housemate. Blaise stepped in behind Draco followed by their Head Boy who was looking equally angry.
Harry looked over as two boys chatted with their third friend, a very pensive looking girl, who, when she interjected her comments the boys just rolled their eyes and ruffled her hair, she scowled at them and the boys laughed coaxing a smile from her. For a second Harry imagined that was him with Ron and Hermione. Swallowing the lump in his throat, Harry looked back towards the entrance as a silence blanketed the room; there stood Professor Snape, robes billowing behind him as he walked in. His eyes immediately found Harry’s and his frown deepened.
“Yes, it looks here that Mister Bobeck suffered a minor concussion, I would assume from when you hit the ground after being stunned,” she said, frown marring her face.
Harry couldn’t imagine why she would be offended that he didn’t know her, many of the seventh years went out of their way to avoid him.
His steps slowed as he approached Draco and Blaise who were chatting off to the side as students walked past them heading towards breakfast. Draco caught sight of him and waved him over and Harry felt himself shrink back.
“Harry, my boy, I was unaware that the hat would choose this year as a resorting,” just barely able to control his eye roll Harry hummed.
He remembered Hermione explaining to him and Ron why there wasn’t a better defense when gaining entrance into that section of the library. She told them the Madam Pince kept a closer eye on that door as much as she did on the students and knew immediately if someone tried entering in. The punishment she usually dealt was worse than something Filch could come up with.
“Draco, I’m pretty sure that when Snape assigned me detention tonight that you were not to be a part of it,” Draco shrugged, and Harry was momentarily distracted as Draco pushed himself off of the wall he had been leaning against.
“You didn’t ask to be resorted, and despite what you or others may think, Slytherin’s aren’t vicious beasts driven to attack,” Harry felt the heat rise in his cheeks, “now that’s not to say your presence in the house has made every one happy, but for the most part, I’d say we’re just observing,” the boy said factually.
None of his magic had worked to heal it and he wondered if the cave had special properties that prevented healing.
“He’s used the Floo many times since first year, usually to complain about you,” Draco shot his best friend a dark look while Harry snickered.
He was the first one in the Charms classroom and Professor Flitwick waved his hello, the older man walked up to him with a stack of papers.
If Lady Zabini was surprised that her son strolled up to her with Harry Potter, she didn’t show it. The matriarch of the Zabini household was a beautiful woman, just a bit taller than her son with piercing hazel eyes. Her hair was pulled back and tied in a bun and Harry marveled at her deep purple robes that seemed to scream elegance yet in the moment she seemed to fit in with the individuals of King’s Crossing.
Their steps were the only sounds on the cobbled pathway and periodically Draco’s mother would stop at a certain plant and breath in its scent. Her fingers would trail along the stone as her other hand clenched her shawl tightly around her.
“Mister Potter, you’re next,” McGonagall waved him forward and as Harry walked towards the front he could see movement from the corner of his eye and as he turned to get in position for the spell Harry watched as Parkinson leaned over to his bag and snuck something inside.
Draco’s eyes were pure silver. Not just the iris, or the pupil, but the entire eye. Wondering what that meant and if it had anything to do with Draco’s Veela side, Harry was about to comment when the common room door opened, and Snape walked in.
As they stepped in front of the Floo Harry tentatively touched his wand in his back pocket underneath his shirt. While he couldn’t do magic outside of school, he still felt better having it with him. He discreetly felt the locket beneath his shirt and thumbed the chain hanging from his neck. It wouldn’t surprise him if with one look Mister Malfoy carted him straight off to Tom.
“Hermione, it’s more than that, it’s a special situation, you see he’s –” commotion from the end of the isle had both looking up; there were two Gryffindor’s rushing by cackling and Hermione immediately pushed back her shoulder’s.
“Ah, no one since this morning. One of the neighbor’s girls had come in picking up a potions manual for her mother, are you looking for someone particular?” The owner had kept his tone light and Harry could only picture the Malfoy sneer.
Walking the short distance to the handle he cocked his head to the side as he took note that there was a small serpent carved underneath the base of the handle. Crouching down he traced the outline of it with his thumb and hummed.
He grabbed the piece of paper folded on top of the box and as his hands shook and mouth dried up, he read the somewhat recognizable penmanship:
“I was so worried about you Harry,” Draco’s voice was deeper, rougher, than Harry had been used too, he sounded so vulnerable.
Panting hard Harry kept his eyes closed as he tried to regain some semblance of rhythm to his breathing. He could hear Draco murmuring something to him, then a spell being cast, then the sweat that had coated his body disappeared. Draco’s lips pressed against his own and they kissed slowly, each of their tongue’s gently massaging the others.
“Give him a shot or at least hear what he has to say,” not waiting for a response Harry watched Zabini’s retreating form head out the classroom, deciding he’d head outside Harry spent his lunch period wandering around the lake.
A piece of parchment appeared in front of him as it would have if a diagnosis was being cast over a patient and snatching it from mid-air Snape’s eyes flickered over it. Occasionally his eyes would seek out Draco’s and then back to the parchment.
“What made you think to shake his hand?” Blaise asked, amusement lacing his tone and Draco shifted to get a better look at his mate who had turned pink around the ears.
Still somewhat confused he opened the box, blinking once, then twice, he grabbed the wastebasket at the edge of his desk and threw up in it. Heaving again he brushed away the tears that were streaming down his face and looked at what was inside the box once more.
Watching Draco turn towards him Harry felt his knees go weak as their bond was flooded with a tidal wave of love and adoring, it was Harry who walked towards the Veela and pressed into the blonde’s side as strong arms wrapped around him.
“Veela’s can be very territorial creatures Harry, once they find their mate they can be possessive and controlling of their partner, have you thought it through what you’ve got yourself into?” it was her hesitant, non-accusing tone, that Harry appreciated as Draco didn’t fly into a fit of rage.
Not waiting for a response, he ran towards the entrance of the library with Blaise hot on his heels, ignoring the cries from the librarian that running was prohibited he turned down a hallway leading towards the stairs.
They had only made it to the Entrance Hall and Harry silently creeped up behind them, he could hear them whispering but not exactly what they were saying. Closing the gap between him and Draco he refrained from laughing at their obliviousness.
The remainder of class was spent discussing what students had done incorrectly; as the bell rang, she reminded them of the assignment due start of class the following week.
“I’ve watched you wander the halls here for awhile now,” springing up, Harry spun around, heart thumping, as he looked at a woman standing down the path from him.
“I don’t care Potter! You’re the Golden Boy, Dumbledore’s favorite, he’d do anything if you just told him, so leave Slytherin!” Nott flicked his wand and shot a stunner towards him; sidestepping it was easy as Harry was mentally putting together some of the pieces.
The next two days Harry had tried to distract himself from the thoughts of Malfoy; he had kept busy reading up on wandless magic and helping the two new Slytherin Beaters, but he still couldn’t get the feeling that something was going on with the Slytherin Prefect. Harry was feeling anxious about the boy and couldn’t understand why.
“Yes, Professor,” Harry spat, and left the room without looking back, unaware of the flickering lights and Dumbledore’s contemplative look.
The group chatted as the Hogwarts nurse approached them and ran on last test, when she finished reading it, she handed Harry a box of vials with strict instruction to see her if he felt worse or there was any unusual side effect.
Mid-terms were in full swing and the sixth- and seventh-year students were feeling the weight of it. Even the normally composed Draco was looking more frazzled than normal. Hermione had taken to the library with the rest of the Ravenclaws and he hadn’t had a chance to continue the discussion with her about what was going on between him and Draco.
“Draco,” he warned, the blond pushed his hair back only to have it fall in front of his face once more.
“Snape? I don’t know of any pure-blood line with that name,” the man waved his hand and continued to pace.
So, when a knock came at his door half after five, he assumed it was Draco. Toying with the idea that he could just ignore it the knock came once more with a bit more force behind it.
“I believe neither of us have rounds tonight, after dinner then Granger?” a warm feeling settled in his stomach as Draco and Hermione went over the potion once more and Blaise taunted Neville with more Herbology nonsense.
Rushing to clean up his space Harry made it to the front where Mister Spaulding was watching him with curious eyes and Harry groaned as the Malfoy family was making their way towards the bookshop. Not knowing anything better to do Harry rushed behind the counter and hid next to Mister Spaulding who had the better sense of ignoring him as the door chimed and the family walked in.
“Boiled for thirty minutes before adding it drop by drop within fifteen minutes from the first drop,” Draco said with ease.
“Yeah, I took uh,” he squinted as if trying to picture what the vial said, “something to fight off infection?” Draco hummed.
As they finally made it to the dining area Harry tensed as he caught sight of another individual sitting next to Lady Zabini.
As Draco’s hands found his hips Harry let out a moan and reluctantly pulled back, while the manor was big, he didn’t want to risk the possibility that Draco’s parents could see them.  Draco let out a gruff chuckle, eyes bright.
As Harry finished telling what had happened the snake had slithered and coiled himself near his hair, having always commented how warm it was.
Harry couldn’t make it to his dorm room quicker if he tried. He only stopped by the kitchens to swipe something to eat but the odd looks the house elves were giving him, as their eyes flickered to his badge, made him feel uncomfortable.
“I would advice you to never speak of breaking my bond with Harry, father,” Draco said icily and Harry saw from under his lashes that the blonde’s eyes had finally turned the Veela silver, matched equally by his father who was staring at him with an angry look on his face.
Tossing the apple into the trash he looked in the living room where his Uncle was still hunched over on the chair, deciding it was best if he left everything as it was he made his way into the ever so small cupboard under the stairs angling his body as best as he could so the pain was minimal but he was still able to get some sleep.
“I had asked him to take me to see you, I needed to know you were okay. Once we got back here your father had horded you in your room, not wanting anyone to get close to you, your mother said that he had completely let his Veela side take over,” Draco let out a visible wince and Harry nodded.
Sitting at the table as Draco collected the potion in two vials, Harry stared at the parchment of paper with a pit of dread settling in his stomach.
Silence settled between the two as they wandered the manor as the time inched closer to when they would depart. Dinner was tense and Missus Malfoy seemed to suspect something had happened, but the way her husband’s face was tight with worry had her hesitant to asking. Though as dinner ended and Mister Malfoy beckoned him and Draco to follow, she gave her son a hug which seemed tighter than normal and kissed her husband soundlessly on the mouth.
“I denied him, and he was furious, claimed that it would be my biggest regret,” Dumbledore chuckled.
“Hopefully this year all Trelawney’s predictions come true and you die, Potter,” Ron fled, and Harry noted that no one had witnessed the exchange.
Deciding he didn’t want to hide out in his dorm room the rest of the night Harry headed towards the library, he still hadn’t looked more into magical maturity. The first night he had gone there to study Madam Pince had followed him around assuming the worst, the following days she had relaxed somewhat but kept a sharp eye on him.
“What do you mean you felt something tied to me?” he asked, and at Draco’s diverted eyes, Harry backed up and crossed his arms.
Stepping into the warm spray Harry groaned as his muscles loosened. He stood under the water for a few minutes just enjoying the silence and the warmth. Making quick work of washing his hair and scrubbing down his body he was about to turn off the knob when he heard a click from the bathroom door.
Yet as Harry stepped up to the entrance Lady Zabini stopped him and motioned for him to place his hand in the middle of the door.
“I don’t know, at the start of term that hat sang a different song and brought up students and resorted a handful of us, the Headmaster was just as surprised as anyone,” rubbing at his chin Salazar looked thoughtful.
Draco had taken him to his own room and Harry let the blonde dress him in the Veela’s warm pajamas, he didn’t say anything as Draco pulled him under the covers and wrapped himself around him. It was a surreal feeling to be held in such a loving embrace and Harry fell asleep within minutes.
Heading towards Defense Against the Dark Arts Harry felt as if his spirits were lifted and sitting himself next to Neville, Harry tuned into the days lecture about Boggarts. Their Professor, an older gentleman who worked for the Ministry, had taken over the position for the year. Professor Murphy was fair yet firm and preferred the more practical side of the class rather than the application of what they were doing. So almost a month into the school year and they hadn’t cast a single spell, nor seen any of the creatures that they were discussing.
“Mister Potter,” she said to him coolly and Harry was reminded of the young version of his mate and his heart clenched, “Walk with me Mister Potter,” she barely gave him a moment to process what she had said as he scrambled to follow behind her.
“Mister Malfoy, I need you to take me to see Tom,” if the conversation wasn’t of such serious nature Harry would have chuckled at the complete loss of composure from the older Veela.
“C’mon you two, it’s Christmas!” Harry chuckled at the whine from the other side of the door as Draco rolled his eyes.
During his dreams Salazar was no help either, the man was more infuriating then Snape on a good day and belittled him any chance that he got. In a fit of rage Harry had destroyed one of the rooms to Salazar’s amusement and Harry had ignored him the following few nights.
“What, too good to participate, Potter?” the sneer on Parkinson’s face had Harry rolling his eyes. Ever since her and Nott’s failed attempt at hurting him she had been quiet, but Harry had kept his guard up.
“Thanks ‘mione, for the research,” he said and the trio split, Hermione heading off one way as Blaise and Harry made their way down to the common room.
“Now Lucius, there might be something else going on that we aren’t aware of, Draco love, why didn’t you tell us you found your mate,” his mother rubbed his hand gently giving her son a comforting smile.
Stroking the side of his face with his uninjured hand Harry watched as Draco seemed to fight to wake up. It was a few more minutes before the blonde’s eyes started to open and Harry was able to see the stunning silver orbs once more.
So, he didn’t move, stayed tucked into Draco’s embrace as the blonde’s Veela held an internal battle.
“I’m surprised father, wasn’t it you that told me once I found my mate that they would be my highest priority?” Draco’s salty tone didn’t surprise Harry but Mister Malfoy eye’s narrowed.
“I think I need to lay down,” he said softly, and Blaise gripped his elbow tightly as Hermione looked towards him worriedly.
Remembering why he needed to talk to the girl Harry shuffled nervously on his feet and Hermione immediately picked up the behavior.
The trio spent the remainder of the day working on various homework assignments, but Harry couldn’t shake the odd feeling of seeing Ginny so often.
The manor was built on a large piece of land in the what he could only assume was the center of it. The grounds were filled with flowers and plants which lined the various paths leading up to the entrance. It was nearing sunset with the suns rays hitting the grounds and illuminating them with a low light, Harry was stunned at the beauty of what he was seeing.
Harry eyed Mister Malfoy as he taped his wand in a complex pattern on the door. The locket was humming something fierce around his neck as if it knew it was getting close to who it belonged to. As the door creaked open Harry followed the two Malfoys inside, eyes darting at any whisper or sound.
Rushing back to his room Harry ignored Seviper’s concerned hiss as he snatched up the cloak that Draco had given him for Christmas. Shrugging it over his shoulders he headed out the door and towards Dumbledore.
“Draco, she just wanted to see how a Patronus was cast,” biting back a laugh as pointed nose nuzzled in his hair he felt as the muscles he was pressed up against began to relax.
Frowning at how he looked, the cuts and bruises that marred most of his body, Harry wished for freedom. He wished that the Dumbledore had never sent him to the Dursleys’ and that Sirius was still alive. Clenching his eyes tight as the tears began to fall Harry cried, cried for his missing family, for the pain and suffering this family had caused him, and wished somehow, someway, it would be better.
“I didn’t think anything had gone wrong, I felt fine, yet a man walked into my room as I was holding my son and I immediately thought the worst, that he was there to take my baby boy away,” Harry’s heart clenched.
It was the following day Harry found himself rushing up to the owlery with Draco and Blaise in tow. Harry had vowed to keep trying to reach Remus after his first two letters had returned sealed.
Tentatively opening the door Harry peered out into the low-lit hallways wondering how concerned he should be that someone else was in the manor with them, his wand never manifested in the dreams, but he wondered if magic would aid someone else.
“I understand Professor, I’m not sure if what I learned would be useful but it seems that Tom wants to utilize the Founders magic to attack Hogwarts,” he said solemnly, Blaise had suggested planting a fake attack but Harry worried that someone could actually get hurt if they mislead the story too much; Draco’s idea had been to see what the Headmaster knew about the Founders, in particular Salazar Slytherin.
It wasn’t until after dinner that Harry arrived back in his room and put away his new attire. He was more than happy to toss all his old, torn up clothes into the bags to throw away later. Opting to spend some time on his homework he managed to finish two of the essays for Transfiguration and questionnaire for Charms, it was nearing midnight before he finally found himself asleep.
If it was a Slytherin that was attacking them they would know the hallways better than himself, but if it wasn’t, Harry could have the upper hand.
The first years mingled with one another as they each scribbled out an outline of what they wanted to do while Hermione watched over them with an excited look on her face, she told Harry and Luna earlier that she had adjusted her own schedule to help out.
“Bisexual. The bond matches a Veela up with their ideal mate and doesn’t take into consideration gender of the mate, or even the age, I’ve accepted that I could either have a male or female partner,” Harry nodded.
Harry didn’t know what was going on as he reached out to try and loosen one of the straps though yet again, he went straight through it.
“No, no, she doesn’t know anything. The Malfoy manor has many ancient Potions texts and I know the potion we need to brew was in one of them. I told her, and then Severus, that I was just wanting to do extra reading,” Blaise rolled his eyes.
Sighing, Harry trudged behind the elf down a different hallway and up a flight of stairs. As they rounded a corner the elf stopped in front of door, Harry couldn’t tell if it was Draco’s or not and as his hand touched the knob the elf spoke.
“Ah, well, young love, what an exciting time,” Harry sensed an underlying bitter tone and for a moment a flash of sadness shone on Dumbledore’s face.
Two cloaked figures rushed by him and as Harry reached out to get their attention his fingers went right through them. Alarmed, Harry wondered if he was dead, that touching the ring had killed him.
“We were going to be together Draco! But you abandoned me, you didn’t love me anymore,” the brunette cried out and Draco growled, to Harry it was the identical cry he had heard from Ginny.
Strapped to the table, with blood running out of the corner of his eyes and the side of his mouth, and small trickle out of his nose, laid He-Who-Shall-Not-Be-Named.
“Come here Draco,” the man spat, and Harry heard the quiet steps behind him, Draco stood next to Harry with his shoulders pushed back.
Neither said any more as Harry cleaned his wound the best he could as his magic wasn’t healing himself. Wallowing himself up under the covers he dozed for the remainder of the day into the night. He vaguely remembered waking up to Blaise thrusting a sandwich in his face before he fell asleep once more.
“How was hanging out with Granger, Longbottom, and Lovegood?” Harry knew that Draco had no interest in what his friends were doing but appreciated the polite gesture.
So, it came to no surprise that one evening Harry and Neville were joined in the library by the two Slytherin Prefects and the group was interacting respectfully. Blaise admitted that he had become quite found of Neville after he was able to help Blaise with his Herbology homework.
It moved a little bit more. Shaking, he tried it again when a loud moan from his side had him stepping back.
“Do you know what a Horcrux is Harry?” watching the Headmaster cautiously, Harry’s eyes didn’t leave him as his thumbed through the various pages.
“So how is Draco, Harry?” caught off guard by Luna’s light tone and the question she asked Harry tripped over his feet, Neville reached an arm out to steady him, face full of confusion.
Struggling to his feet Harry glanced once more at the clock that had chimed four in the morning. Groaning he pushed open the door and turned to look down the hallways. He had no idea where he was let alone what he was supposed to do. He figured he could Floo back to the Zabini manor, but his heart clenched at the idea of leaving Draco.
The days that followed were the same and Harry found himself enjoying the time that he was able to spend with his mate. Blaise had stopped by on occasion to check in with them both and Severus had stopped by one afternoon, when Draco chided him for not checking daily Severus sent his godson a glower explaining he had better things to do then babysit. Mister Malfoy had immediately pulled the man aside and Harry could only begin to imagine what was being said behind closed doors.
?” snatching the book out of Draco’s loose grasp Harry flipped it over to see what the summary said, missing the pink look covering Draco’s face.
Dumbledore’s brows furrowed as he nodded his head solemnly, hand stroking his beard as his eyes surveyed the room.
“I know, but, I wasn’t afraid of the magic, I knew it wouldn’t hurt me, if anything, it was like the magic trusted me, it recognized me somehow,” he closed his eyes for a moment, his heart was racing.
Snape’s eyes flashed something that Harry didn’t understand but it was pushed in the back of his mind as he found himself in Draco’s arms, nose pressed into his neck, and soothing words whispered into his ear.
“I must ask you two to leave, he will not be having visitors for the duration of the weekend,” controlling the urge to grab the blonde’s hand Harry draped his cloak over the chair next to the bed and allowed for Blaise to guide him outside the Hospital Wing and around the corner.
Draco had admitted that he had been on a few dates before and Harry had confessed his crush on Ginny and Cho and it had been awkward because Draco’s face had hardened and it took a few hours of convincing by Harry that he didn’t still have feelings for them. Draco admitted later that his Veela didn’t like the idea of Harry liking anyone else.
“Better Professor; how are Esmelda and Anderson doing?” he could see Madam Pomfrey busying herself a few beds down and Harry could imagine her swooping in if he strained himself.
“You attacked first years Ginny, you hurt them, you hurt me, why – because I wasn’t your friend anymore?” a few books toppled off a shelf and Luna tugged at his arm, he didn’t move as the events that night ran rampant through his mind.
“I’m not taking my only son to be near the Dark Lord, it’s out of the question,” Draco stood at the tone.
“I just don’t understand it, if the potion says I’m his heir then something, any of this, would make sense,” he groused, mourning the lack of Hermione.
“Seriously Ronald, you’re being petty about this,” Ron snarled and stalked off to the Great Hall flanked by Seamus and Dean, both who shot their own dirty look towards Harry.
Harry didn’t say anything as Draco pulled him into his arms and buried his nose into his hair, he himself clenching the Veela’s arms, their bond was a flux of emotion and Harry felt dizzy trying to process it all.
“It’s fine ‘mione, I’m glad you’re enjoying the preparations,” trying to steer the conversation to a lighter tone his three friends still looked uncomfortable.
“Go, ‘mione, I’ll catch up with you later,” as the class emptied out Harry dragged his feet to the Hufflepuff head of house who was chatting with one of her plants, as she spied his arrival she smiled.
“Harry my boy, I feel we’re one step closer to finding and destroying Voldemort for good,” Harry nodded slowly as he watched the older wizard’s fingers reach out and open the envelope.
As students tried to approach to ask what had happened Harry could hear Draco’s snarl over the raised voices, touching the hem of his shirt that had his own blood stains across it the Veela immediately turned to Harry and crouched down.
“Magical maturity is what happens when a witch or wizard turn sixteen. Their magic reaches their full potential and it’s possible that when it happens it can change the person as well. Sixteen is an important age for many witches and wizards. Heir’s to family lineage come into their responsibilities and magical creatures typically go through physical and additional magical changes,” Hermione stated factually, Harry just gaped at his female friend, he had no idea.
What felt like minutes, yet by Draco’s gentle shaking, had been a few hours, Harry pushed himself up. Blinking, he felt more like himself, and not so drained.
Everything aside Harry was excited about tonight; it was his first time in the dueling club. Madam Pomfrey had given him a clean bill of health with strict instructions that she didn’t want to see him back for the remainder of the year.
“After we died we left the care of the school to the Headmaster and to the Deputy, it was on their shoulders that the students would be taken care of, pushed towards their potential, not to be put in harms way,” the man fumed as his robes billowed behind him and Harry couldn’t help but ask.
“I’ll find a way to get all of you back to your spot,” he said, determination lacing his words, and she beamed.
“Professor Dumbledore hasn’t said anything to the students about it Harry,” Luna said tentatively, and the others nodded in agreement.
The room was larger than what he had at the Dursleys, there was a queen-sized bed in the middle flanked by end tables; a desk was pushed up under the window overlooking the street he had arrived on, there was a closet, a bathroom, and dresser that Harry made good use of and unpacked what little clothes he had. The room was shades of blue and gave Harry a calm feeling.
“Let’s stop thinking about Blaise and Granger,” distracted from his thoughts Harry glanced over to watch Draco push open the Astronomy door, he wasn’t too surprised it was open as Professor Sinstra understood the need for some students to watch the stars for homework assignment.
“My Uncle has been the only one to craft these stones and when he died, he didn’t pass the trait on, so I’m very particular about who I show these too,” feeling his heart swell he felt extremely grateful.
It was the same path that he had walked down earlier that he was now following back towards his mate. He probed their bond and made a noise in the back of his throat, Snape’s eyes flickered towards him.
Making his way through the hallways Harry headed for the entrance to the common room when he noticed that both Malfoy and Zabini were hunched over whispering, neither would have noticed him had he not bumped into a chair a knocked it over. Both boys jump and Harry felt the blood rush to his cheeks, giving them a nodded he picked up the chair and made for the entrance in record speed.
But as Harry turned towards the person casting the spell, Harry felt as if the wind was knocked out of him, no, it couldn’t be.
“I wasn’t going to go out with her,” he said unsure of how to deal with a jealous Veela. Draco made a noise in the back of his throat and Harry wormed his way into his arms when it seemed like he wasn’t convinced.
“No, I won’t be going, I’ve never gone,” Harry said as he stared at the fireplace missing the looks of bewilderment from the other two.
“Feels good, pleased to have you withering underneath me for the third morning in row,” Draco said with a smug grin and Harry swatted his shoulder.
“Now I’ve always been very supportive of my son, as he hasn’t found a woman that he fancies in pursuing I can only begin to imagine that you are his destined partner,” choking on his tea he looked at her owlishly as Blaise spluttered next to him.
It wasn’t the first time Draco had wanted him to take it easy, during Charms the Veela had about rushed over to where him and Neville were practicing casting blue sparks. Harry’s had shot both green and blue and it took Blaise’s coaching for Draco to stay in place. Professor Flitwick had reassured him that it was because he wasn’t using his magic as often as he had prior to the attack and that there was build up in his core.
“I’ve spent the last few days wondering why my Veela choose you of all people, I couldn’t imagine how you’d be my best match, but,” he paused for a dramatic effect, “I get it.”
“I don’t understand why you have to like them, why do you have to be friends with everyone!” the girl cried out and Harry’s green eyes darted towards the direction of Madam Pince hoping the librarian wouldn’t hear this outburst.
“I would remind you that as you roam the halls of Hogwarts to never do so alone,” Harry frowned, Professor McGonagall had never given the Gryffindor’s that warning, “Ensure that you are always with someone, I will not tolerate disrespect to the Slytherin house and any point deduction or mishap,” Snape directed his look at Harry, “will result in detention with me. The house dueling club will meet up in two weeks lead by Mister Murphy and Quidditch tryouts will be held in a week, please see Mister Malfoy if you would like to be slotted for a time,” Harry’s ears perked at the mention of a dueling club, he had no idea Slytherin’s had such an activity.
It wasn’t until the following weekend that Harry managed to get two Ravenclaws, a Hufflepuff, Draco, Blaise, and himself in the Room of Requirement. It was tricky; between Hermione’s extracurricular activities, three Prefect duties, Neville’s Herbology obligations, and Harry’s wandless training, there was only a small window available for them to meet up.
Caught off guard Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s middle and squirmed to get more comfortable in the embrace.
“Her last letter said that Dumbledore had sought her and Hermione out to see if either had heard from you,” Harry leaned forward with concern.
Blaise smirked, “Impressive right?” Harry nodded and hid a smile at Blaise’s puffed up chest, he could imagine how important a manor was to a pureblood.
“I kept tabs on Tom in the time following our last encounter and found that he had been employed at Borgin and Burkes, but then, he disappeared,” tugging at his beard his eyes found Harry’s.
that annoyed Harry; Parkinson and Nott had taken a snake from its home in a feeble attempt at hurting him.
“Blaise I had the room nearest to yours set up for Mister Potter, I’ll be retiring for the evening as I meet up with Marlin tomorrow morning,” biding goodnight Harry leaned against the settee back and let out a sigh, only opening an eye when he had the feeling he was being watched.
“Boys this is Marlin,” said man gave them a tilt of his head in acknowledgement but didn’t say anything; he was an older gentleman, his hair was mostly graying and the wrinkles at his eyes were noticeable when he smiled. He was wearing a tailored suit and as he began to read the paper he patted at his chest, a frown suddenly appearing.
February came with more snow and an overwhelming pile of homework from all his classes and Harry fell into a routine to balance it all. Between his wandless tutoring, Occlumency lessons, dueling practice, assignments, spending time with Draco and hanging out with his friends the days had begun to fly by.
“Professor Dumbledore approached me about your request to visit the Zabini manor over the upcoming holidays,” their teacher paused, and Harry held his breath, Draco scoffed.
it was a nifty spell that Hermione had taught him and Ron the year prior, it was a great way to distract an opponent with a localized storm.
At one-point Harry had looked up to see Draco pink in the face and pupils dilated, Harry cocked his head to the side, unaware of what could be bothering the teen.
Harry’s room was as he left it with a few articles of clothing scattered around and papers lying about on his desk. Seviper was laying atop the bed canopy having enjoyed the height and the warming charms that Harry had put on it as well.
After he finished his bathroom routine and changed for the day, he was tying up his shoes as a knock sounded on the door. Opening it he grinned at Blaise’s smile and relaxed demeanor.
“I need to talk with you Tom, something has been brought to my attention and it’s important we speak about it,” Tom pulled out his wand and pointed it towards him, Harry could hear Draco’s breath hitch behind him.
His arm movement was jerky as he shattered the wall next to Bellatrix and her cohorts. She snarled and shot a spell at him. The protection spell he summoned shimmered brightly as it absorbed the incoming attack. She screeched as Rodolphus and Rabastan held up their own wands; absent of panic Harry’s mind was on Draco and how this vile woman had attempted to harm another of his loved ones.
“People say Slytherin’s are evil, are you?” The blonde boy ahead of him looked over his shoulder and for a moment Harry swore it was first year Malfoy.
“Then how did you guys know that something had happened?” Harry said, while it made sense that Draco and Blaise had known he was in the Hospital Wing he didn’t know how the others knew.
” Harry was prepared and didn’t move, he had told Draco he suspected that Tom would try to kill him, and the blonde couldn’t do anything; a zing of fear shot through the blonde and Harry grit his teeth together.
At hand reached to his chin pushing it upwards and Harry willingly looked up into Draco’s eyes; those eyes that were looking at him with comfort and reassurance.
Mister Spaulding had been nice enough to try and help Harry with his research but admitted quite embarrassed that he had struggled and disliked Divination while he was in school, Harry could easily relate, and both shared a hearty laugh.
“Let’s get them back to the common room,” as Blaise took Esmelda’s hand the girl let out a choked sob as she turned back towards Harry, the teen could only assume that she felt safest with him.
“Malfoy said it would come in time, but I can’t imagine being good enough for the first Quidditch match at the end of the month,” the other boy commented dryly.
“We’ve passed it Harry, you didn’t mean for it to happen and I hold no resentment towards you for it,” the blonde responded, and Harry pulled a disgruntled face.
“Interesting, it was Rowena’s idea to give the Sorting Hat the option to resort students though it was only once something triggered it,” that confused Harry further, he didn’t know what could have triggered the Sorting Hat into resorting the students.
Harry’s routine had been broken when he had received a message from Professor Sprout after Herbology that Dumbledore had wanted to meet with him. It had been weeks since they had last talked with one another and Dumbledore had been regularly absent from Hogwarts, enough so that rumors had begun to spread about what he was doing.
and be able to feel what you had felt. You can add as many memories as you can recall as you cast it but once you stop you won’t be able to cast the spell again,” the man warned and Harry’s heart swelled at the gift, it was something truly perfect for Draco.
Commotion coming from outside of the classroom was a needed distraction and tilting his head Harry picked up footsteps coming down the hallway.
As they walked out of the room Harry sided up next to his friend and gave him an uneasy look, “Blaise?” he didn’t know what he wanted to ask.
“I’ve been friends with him long enough to see the signs of him liking someone,” pressing his tongue into the inside of his cheek Harry tried to picture Hermione and her previous crushes.
“I’m not sure what trashy romance novel you’ve been reading Potter, but all of that, is a complete lie. You have a choice, you have a say in the bond,” biting the inside of his cheek, Harry was confused, he vaguely recalled studying Veela’s in Defense Against the Dark Arts and the interaction he had with Fleur, both had indicated an immediate, submissive, and permanent bond.
“Luna?” Harry reached out tentatively, brushing his hand over her shoulder he felt the girl jump and look up at him with wide eyes.
“Of course, Mister Potter, as Draco’s mate your always welcome in the manor,” Harry’s shoulders eased as she referred to him as her son’s mate.
“Veela’s want a family. Most Veela’s when mated with the idea partner, have as many children as the Veela side of them crave. I know of some families that have had a dozen children, yet some that have just the one child,” as she turned her head towards him her eyes were filled with tears.
Humming to himself Harry peered around the office noting that the stacks of papers that Dumbledore had out regarding the Horcruxes were absent; oddly enough, many of the portraits that were lining the walls were empty and Harry could only wonder where the inhabitants snuck off too.
As they passed the various housemates in the common room Harry trudge towards his room giving Draco a small pout as the other teen headed towards his room, they hadn’t been able to spend a night together since break and he had missed the warmth that the blonde provided.
“Yes?” he said as he glanced over his shoulder and cocked his head to the side with an innocent look on his face.
Draco couldn’t contain his gasp of surprise and Harry let out a sigh of relief as Draco rubbed his thumb over the cool metal, equally mesmerized by the wings on it.
“I’m fine Hermione, Madam Pomfrey said I could leave today,” when it looked like everyone was about to protest, Harry rolled his eyes, “she said I have to take a potion each night for the next week and to take it easy in all of the classes,” that seemed to settle the group and Harry felt at ease as a feeling of comfort washed over him.
his arm movement was jerky, and the chair came flying towards him, moving to the side he had to avoid the chair and the incoming spell. He had wanted to the object to intercept it, but the spell hadn’t gone the way he intended.
“Ha’rry?” the blonde slurred and as Harry nodded, he choked back a sob as the blonde’s arms wound around his neck and pulled him into his broad chest.
Harry hesitated. The locket that was on him was humming something fierce and without giving it another thought he pulled it from around his neck and held it in the palm of his hand. Tom’s eyes immediately picked up on the movement and stared at the object.
The trio spent the remainder of the day lounging around the common room and checking in on the potion. They only made it to the Great Hall for the Christmas Feast that evening, and Harry avoided making eye contact with Professor Dumbledore having not been summoned to his office since his horrific vision surrounding the ring.
“What do you mean he never showed,” Blaise snapped, but Hermione didn’t seem upset at the tone, her hands shaking slightly.
It took a moment to register the clapping that was coming from the sides, turning to his left he shot Draco a grin who had returned it back.
“I spent some time by myself this summer, and it did some good,” Harry didn’t feel like explaining the details of his trip, not now, not yet.
The day had been as normal as any other except for when Professor Snape held him back after Potions, the man hadn’t approached him since his return either and with a pinched face the man informed him that the Headmaster wanted to see him.
Both Draco and Blaise had Prefect rounds so Harry opted to tag along with a few of the seventh years that were headed in the same direction; none seemed bothered by his presence and Harry was grateful to follow in silence.
“Have you left the library Hermione, or would I find a nest where you’ve slept here nightly?” the girl rolled her eyes and smacked his shoulder with no real force behind it.
“I won’t let anything happen to him, just because it’s me and bad things always seem to follow me I won’t let Draco get hurt, I won’t let him be harmed, by Voldemort, by Dumbledore, by you or anyone else that could possibly hurt him. Draco gave me a choice to whether or not I wanted to accept the bond, he didn’t force me into it, I chose Draco and I’d choose him again,” Harry snapped and vials along the back of the classroom shattered.
“A few started questioning your relationship, some were impressed with Draco for saving you from Merkoft, most didn’t think much of it,” he shrugged.
“I’m tired of everyone thinking that they know my best interests, I watched my godfather die in front of me. I wasn’t able to protect my mind from Voldemort, I wasn’t able to save Sirius,” the light bulb above them shattered and Harry’s fists clenched.
After he had purchased the pocket watch Harry’s thoughts had been consumed on what Draco’s wings would look like; when he had approached the teen about it Draco had confessed that he wouldn’t be able to summon them until after they had bonded. He explained that when the bond was complete, and their magic had intertwined that his wings would take on a color that represented them as a mated pair.
Summoning his wand, he pointed it to where she was and removed the barrier between them. Sinking to the floor as she became visible, his legs collapsed underneath him, and he was starting to feel lightheaded.
“Can you please stay?” the question had come off quieter than he intended but Draco heard him nonetheless; with a wave of his wand their clothes had altered into something softer and Draco slipped underneath the covers tucking Harry back in his arms.
“When a Veela turns sixteen there can be a pull that they feel towards their mate, it’s unlikely that the mate lives in the immediate vicinity of them so Mother and Father took me to various places over the summer to see if I felt the pull. We were passing by another town and I felt drawn to Flagley,” still sounding smug it was Harry’s turn to roll his eyes.
“Did you see Hermione and Blaise?” he asked to fill the silence, while it wasn’t awkward by any means he had started to notice something between the two.
The locket underneath his shirt hummed with magic and Harry bit his lip. Though as he was about to say something the door opened with a bang and a maniacal cackle resonated in the room. Harry’s heart dropped as Bellatrix followed by the Lestrange brothers entered.
It was quiet in the halls and Harry wasn’t too surprised to see some Ravenclaws headed for the library, what for, Harry didn’t know.
“Draco darling, we must go if we’re to make the portkey,” Draco, who had wandered towards the back of the store sighed.
It was moments later that Harry found himself in a restless sleep back in the manor, wandering aimlessly through the halls.
“Well it looks like it’s healing, you probably have another day or so before it’s completely gone, did you take anything else for it?” he bobbed his head.
Watching Draco’s retreating form Harry stepped into his room feeling all bubbly. Seviper peered open an eye from the head of the bed and hissed a greeting. Changing and slipping under the covers Harry started to tell the snake what had happened after getting a firm
“HUFFLEPUFF!” Harry wasn’t as shocked as others around him were, Goyle was fiercely loyal to his friends and he was made for Hufflepuff. Sneaking a glance at Malfoy he was surprised that the blonde hair boy was looking relaxed.
Pricking the tip of his finger Harry waited for the blood to pool before letting a drop fall to the paper.
Harry didn’t have much time to process the mystery when two students sat down in front of him and pinned him with a dual stare. Harry recognized them as the Beaters from the Slytherin team.
Letting out a startled yelp Harry found himself dragged down towards the water his leg scraping against a jagged rock and he cried out in pain. He saw no more as the Inferius dragged him underneath the liquid surface. Fear like nothing he had experienced before took over him as he struggled against the grasp of the Inferius, terror-stricken, he went to say a spell and snapped his mouth shut as he inhaled a mouthful of water. Waving his hand, he haphazardly concentrated on a spell to send the cave dweller back. It wasn’t strong enough but had loosened the grip of the Inferius, enough that Harry could get away. Propelling himself up to the water’s surface he gasped for breath as he clutched to the edge of the island.
“I can’t feel Draco,” he whimpered, a nearby flower caught fire and with a flick of his wand Snape doused it with water, Harry’s emotions were still unstable, and his magic was reacting to it.
“Rowena asked to be in the library, so she could talk with the young minds curious about information. Salazar wanted to be hidden in the depths of the dungeons, so that those who wanted to seek him out would take the effort to find him,” she chuckled as if remembering a fond memory, “Godric had a spot claimed in the Great Hall, he said that he wanted to be near the action, but,” she covered her mouth effectively hiding her smile, “I believe he wanted to be near the most amount of people who would listen to his stories.”
“Perfect, keep an eye out while I harvest it,” Draco said as he pulled the ingredient bag from his pocket aiming his wand at the root of the plant.
“Evans, Harry Evans,” she nodded and had him fill out some basic information and he breathed a sigh of relief that he had enough money to cover his stay.
“Magical law Hermione?” his confusion was mirrored by Blaise and both peered at the pages she had turned to.
“Nott seems to have a problem with me being resorted into Slytherin,” Draco’s eyes narrowed at the door as if he was contemplating on following Nott to Professor Snape to ensure the teen was pushed thoroughly.
marks were given for wand movement, the amount of birds that were conjured, and the look of the bird.
Spitting out the password he barely waited for the stone walls to move aside before forcing himself between the crack. Eye’s skimming the common room he noticed that everyone was silent, and he didn’t wait a second before calling out to his mate.
“What?” he asked tentatively, she clearly was speaking to him as she stood directly in front of him, but he had hoped he had possibly misheard her.
Harry moaned and willingly opened his mouth and let Draco take control. He could only imagine the Veela side was distraught at hearing what he had been through. His eyes rolled back as Draco sucked and nipped at his neck and Harry faintly recognized the feeling of a hickey blossom.
“Oh Draco,” Pansy cooed, and Harry winced, her cutesy voice was awful, “you look stunning! Wouldn’t you like to be my date tonight?” Harry’s eyes narrowed but Draco didn’t miss a beat.
“I don’t understand, I can feel that the magic wants to be set free, what does it want an invitation? A gesture of good will? What?” as Tom paced the room aggressively Harry cocked his head to the side, he wondered if it could be something as simple as that.
Harry mulled that over, understanding quickly what Draco was eluding too, he couldn’t miss the morning classes and while he felt like he could attend the afternoon lessons, he still felt shaky.
Shifting on the bed he blinked a few times trying to get his eyes to focus. There was some light streaming through the window, and he realized with a groan that he had only been asleep for a few hours, which explained the sand-like feeling in his eyes.
“How long ago was this,” his mind was in overdrive, he knew that he could try to get Esmelda back to the common room, yet the absent Anderson was worrying him, and he hadn’t seen anyone on his trek to where Esmelda was.
His dreams had returned, and Merope had bombarded him with questions about his absence; when he had admitted to being injured after an attack a crazed look in her eye sparked.
A few days before break had begun the snake had come down with a magical cold that had made the normally sarcastic and witty snake reservered and lethargic. He needed to be watched carefully over the course of a week and Harry had left him in Luna’s capable hands as he knew he wouldn’t be able to properly take care of his friend. The quiet Ravenclaw had accepted the responsibility with a smile as Hermione had turned green when asked.
“It’s a basic tracking spell,” it had only taken a moment before a thin blue light left Blaise’s wand and headed left. Motioning for them to head that way the group followed the light as it twisted and turned down the hallways.
Turning to place the vials on his desk he waved his wand over the box and contained the items in a secure ward, it wouldn’t help if they were somehow damaged.
“I, uh, I don’t think I was supposed to say that,” he mumbled and jumped slightly at the laughter coming across from him.
It was strange after months of dreaming to have a night where he dreamed of nothing, waking up Harry felt groggy and his mouth was drier than the ever. Groping for his glasses on the table next to him Harry looked around, the students that were there the following night were gone as well as both Anderson and Esmelda, and by the look of the light streaming through the windows it was well into the afternoon.
“What is he doing here?! Draco get away from him!” the shout came and Draco’s grip on him got tighter.
“It got cut on a rock,” he said, and he observed as Draco pursed his lips giving him an unimpressed look.
Snape said nothing more as he escorted the teary-eyed girl out of the common room, a few of the students wandered back in but the trio didn’t pay them any attention. It was Blaise who nudged them towards the dorm room as Draco gripped onto Harry’s shoulder tightly.
“I want to know what’s going on Malfoy,” it was a glare match between boys, but Harry had no intention to letting up, he wanted to know what was going on. Pulling his arm from Harry’s grasp Malfoy pinched the bridge of his nose.
The two finished and after Snape dismissed them once he had checked their work, they headed back to the common room.
“So, you’re accepting of,” he waved his fork as if it meant something, “this?” she shot him an unapproved look as the utensil waved around, and he hastily placed it on his plate.
The group trekked through the dungeon halls and made it into the common room in record time. Harry made a beeline for his room to get his bathroom bag and head towards the showers.
“Even though there’s seven of us Bill is the Weasley’s heir, when he turned sixteen my parents explained what that meant for him,” Harry pondered what he had been told.
The three boys spent the rest of breakfast talking about the move and Harry promised that he would help them practice before their first match. Walking into Charms in high spirits Harry joked with Neville while keeping an eye out for the elusive blonde. Seeing the boy walk into class and sit next to the ever faithful Zabini, Harry felt relieved.
“My parent’s will be meeting us in a different room. I told them if they bombarded you as we Floo’d in it would be overwhelming,” Harry took comfort in Draco’s calm demeanor and wondered if perhaps the blonde had already alluded to his parents who his mate was.
Harry watched as Neville had an internal battle with himself, he had said a few words during their study session still too shy to talk much; but plants were something that Neville knew better than anyone else.
“Pansy seemed to be having a fit though, she tailed after Merkoft when she retreated to her dorm,” sharing a look with his mate Harry watched as Draco seemed to be processing that bit of information.
stopping in the middle of straightening his tie he looked down at the snack biting his lip with concern.
The rest of the night was spent with both teens thoroughly enjoying themselves and falling asleep intertwined with one another completely satisfied.
Harry’s hands settled in his lap and he stared at his fingers. Had he imagined it? Was there an enchantment on the ring that had given him that image, so he’d question it?
“Mister Potter,” jumping Harry looked to see an eyebrow raised of his head of house, calming his erratic heart Harry took a deep breath.
He couldn’t imagine how a relationship between them would work, having been enemies since their first year there was murky water between the two; Ron would have blown a casket if he knew, while Hermione would have thrown herself into the research. Shaking his head, he pushed aside what the others would think, it wasn’t their choice, it was his. He knew too, that he didn’t have to decide right then, but something in the back of his mind was telling him that right now was important.
“I’m sorry Harry, the idea that you’d spend time with someone else that you haven’t spent time with before, irritates my Veela to no end. I appreciate that you were willing to share that information,” Draco’s arms dropped to Harry’s sides and his thin fingers poked Harry’s own.
Yet as he crossed the threshold into his room, he turned towards Draco who was waiting patiently outside the door and Harry’s lips quirked up.
“Hi there! Welcome to Potts Inn. My name is Sophia, how can I help you today?” she frantically pushed the papers to the side and Harry gave her a reassuring smile, he sensed she was a bit disorganized.
“That fool of a Headmaster! What an absolute disgrace that he has brought the Hogwarts name, splitting someone’s soul for personal gain, splitting my heir’s soul,” Salazar roared, and Harry felt a tremble beneath his feet.
There was a ring sitting on a table off to the edge of the room. There looked to be other items as well, but Harry couldn’t tear his eyes away from the ring. It was the ring that Dumbledore had placed on his desk back in his office, the ring that he had reached out to touch.
They had made it across the bridge and Harry was convinced they would make it to the edge of the forest without a hitch, that was until Pansy Parkinson appeared around a corner with a few other Slytherin girls trailing behind her.
“Well, I’d better get to Arithmancy,” watching Malfoy walk away Harry couldn’t help that his eyes didn’t leave the blonde’s retreating form, a cough from behind him had Harry remembering he wasn’t alone.
For the remainder of the night Harry saw memory after memory of Tom. He saw when he was sorted into Slytherin, his skill in Transfiguration, and how the boy grew and developed during his years at Hogwarts. Harry noticed that they boy came back bitter and angry after his summer holidays and at one-point Dumbledore had overheard Tom begging Headmaster Dippet if he could stay anywhere else. Harry also saw the bad memories, fights that Dumbledore and other Professor’s had to break up between him and another classmate, the occasional stealing, and one student had even claimed that Tom had put a real snake in his bag.
“Look Nott, I don’t know what you want, I don’t know why you’re obsessed with bothering me, but I don’t want anything to do with you,” Harry shot at him, Nott’s eyes hadn’t left his own emerald ones.
The weeks leading up to Easter break started to blur together and dread started creeping up, Harry was less nervous about meeting with Tom than he was about meeting Draco’s parents.
Harry felt dejected as they walked into the common room, Draco hadn’t said anything, but Harry didn’t feel any distress coming from their bond, so he wasn’t worried that the blonde was upset with what had transpired.
Draco didn’t say anything but pulled up his own chair next to Harry’s and went through the smaller boy’s Potions essay, while he had improved greatly since the beginning of the year Draco still coached him in what exactly Snape was looking for. The man had been ruthless since term had resumed and assigned weekly essays.
The first set of students to walk by them were handful of fifth-years, Harry immediately found a few Slytherin’s who waved as they walked by. Next were the majority of the first years and Harry’s face lit up as he watched Esmelda rush towards him. The small girl had written him a few times during break and had even sent him some of his favorite chocolate; he had written back thanking her as Blaise and Draco teased him about his admirer.
He had never tried to execute something like sneaking into the Restricted Section alone, but he had to know if there were any books in there that talked about Horcruxes. Walking to the other end of the library he skimmed over the students that were studying; there were probably twenty or so students present and of course Madam Pince. Draco and Blaise were the only Prefects seated and there weren’t any Head Boy or Girl’s that Harry recognized.
“This is nothing Draco, you have not fully bonded, you know that your Veela can find someone else, anyone else and you’ll survive,” biting the inside of his cheek Harry tasted blood on his tongue, Draco hissed and Missus Malfoy’s eyes flickered from her son to her mate with worry ebbed deep in her blue orbs.
“We saw Death Eaters at the Ministry at the end of the year,” Harry’s brows furrowed as he was piecing together what she was implying.
“That could work, they might know something, we could also seek out the Founder’s portraits and ask them what they know,” it was Blaise’s look that caught Harry’s attention.
There was something behind the door that he was meant to see; he stared at the handle for a few moments before he reached out and just as he clasped the knob in the palm of his hand, the door swung open and he stumbled in.
“A mutual friend of ours was going to meet up with us,” the Zabini heir responded coolly and Harry watched as if the older man hadn’t recognized he had said something inappropriate.
“Zabini…” the warning tone was evident, and Blaise raised his hands in surrender, a small smile still lingering on his lips.
Harry was about to push her for more information when Draco nudged him and nodded towards the Great Hall, he frowned.
“Well Harry, once I talk to Severus I’ll let you know, as you can imagine we couldn’t have anyone in close proximity of the Zabini manor while you were there and with Voldemort at large this could be risky,” Harry nodded with a somber look on his face, there was a gentle prod at his mental barrier and he immediately felt himself tense, the prodding increased and Harry coached himself to relax.
Nothing more was said to him, but their Prefect filled the silence by explaining the different hallways in the dungeons and Harry was impressed that for the most part there was always a way to find yourself at the house entrance in case a student was lost.
Harry was convinced Draco knew how to make his body look more alluring in just the right moments. Feeling the drool pool at the side of his mouth he pulled his eyes away from the Veela’s arms that had been exposed seeing as Draco had his sleeves rolled up, the muscles were flexing just enough that Harry briefly pictured them holding him tight as his dominating lips descended on his own.
Classes with the Slytherin’s was vastly different from how it was in the Gryffindor house, many Slytherin’s kept their heads down and quiet whereas the Gryffindor’s were as loud as ever. Ron had started in on him a few times but after Professor McGonagall had docked fifty points, threatened his Prefect position, and assigned the red head detention for the remaining month, Ron had been silent.
After a few minutes when the door didn’t move the matriarch sighed, shooting the man next to her a look she shook her head.
Inside of the box was a deep emerald cloak with silver clasps, there was a slight shimmer to the cloak and as Harry ran his fingers against the fabric, he felt his heart jump into his throat, it was a stunning garment.
“I’m actually looking for books about dreams and what they could mean,” for a moment Harry saw that man look surprised.
It was hours later that Draco had eased up enough to talk with Harry about what had transpired, neither had pegged the girls to be the ones behind the attack though Draco had admitted he had felt like something was off with Pansy from the start of the year.
It was memories of being with Draco that flooded his mind as he calmly said the Patronus’ incantation and a silver stream flowed out of his wand before his father’s Animagus form appeared in front of him. It pranced around the room and it was then that Harry realized he had an audience as the common room had gone silent and stared in awe at what he had conjured.
Harry took a hard look a Malfoy who was shuffling some of his papers around. The teen was attractive, he’d grown over the summer and his voice had deepened; there was no gel in his hair so his blonde locks frame his cheekbones, it was a sophisticated third year look. Harry had never given the consideration that he might be attracted to guys, deep down though, he knew he just wanted to be loved.
“I needed to know about the Horcruxes, I’ve been trying to figure out where you were buried to see if I can find the information that you left and what do I learn? That you were buried here the entire time,” he snipped, and Salazar’s eyes regarded him attentively.
“It’s possible, but it’s also possible it was a Slytherin, or,” he shrugged, “it could be someone from Ravenclaw or even Hufflepuff,” the tension simmered as each of the group was lost in their own thoughts.
“I know, I haven’t been a good mate at all, I just,” Dean looked hopeless as he stared at Harry with sad eyes.
Harry readily agreed and confessed that Hermione was typically the researcher of the group and that he dragged his feet when he needed to go to the library.
There were a few couches, a fire, and a coffee table in the middle. There was enough space for three to a couch and as Harry settled on one, with Draco and Blaise on each of his sides, he faced towards his friends.
“Draco,” he murmured, laying down next to the Veela he ran his fingertips lightly over the blonde’s cheek, gently grazing over his collar bone, and finally putting the weight of his hand on his mate’s hip. Tucking his head into Draco’s shoulder he found himself closing his eyes and quickly falling asleep.
“Professor Dumbledore said it was best that we didn’t talk to one another, to give each other space,” Neville commented softly from his side.
Harry was surprised to see Ginny watching him with a mixed look on her face. She seemed to want to reach out to him but held herself back. She stood at the end of the row for a few minutes before another girl whispered in her ear and ushered her away.
“Most pairs don’t experience anything extra with their bond, but some can feel what their partner feels, whether or not it’s their emotions or physical contact, and it has only been rumored that a bonded pair have been able to talk telepathically, but,” Draco gave Harry a sheepish smile, “in some cases a Veela can feel a pull to where their mate is,” Harry took a moment to process the information.
“He’ll get over this Harry, you two have been best friends for so long,” the smile she sent him lacked conviction, Harry shrugged.
His eyes scanned the room but stopped at the figure in the window. It was Merope, and from what Harry could see, she was clutching a toy to her breast with her forehead pressed against the windowpane.
“Daddy loves Dumbledore, if you stayed with us, he’d let him know the moment you left,” Luna commented, her sad eyes trained on him and he gave her a soothing smile.
“What time is it?” he asked muffled and squirmed as Draco poked him in the side, peering up his glared at his mate who had let out a chuckle.
Slipping to the floor Harry wondered who had intervened when strong hands picked up him by his arms and the familiar shock ran through his body. It was Malfoy; blushing Harry tried to focus his eyes to see him better.
For a moment, Harry had completely forgotten the talk he had with Dumbledore or the detention that he had with Snape. His pants had become uncomfortably tight and his heart hammered in his chest. He was feeling warm and tingly all over.
Another book flew out from behind a corner and students began laughing as this one showered them with pink sparks.
“Draco, Potter, glad you two could join us,” Harry recognized the boy as Conner Murphy, Snape had said at the beginning of term that he was leading the club.
“Well after the ritual was completed there was a mark on the person, a mark that wouldn’t go away with spells or potions or even over the course of time,” her eyes flickered back to his scar and he stared at the wall unmoving.
Turning down the hallway to head up the stairs it was the knock-back jinx that sent him flying back and crashing into another suit of armor, both his bookbag and glasses had landed out of arms reach.
“Please, he’s my mate and he was hurt because of me, I promise I’ll go to the other room, I just want to see that he’s okay,” the house elf shot him a look and motioned for Harry to follow.
“Don’t move it, when did this happen? How did this happen?” Harry suddenly felt very exposed as the older teen looked down at him. When Harry made no notion to explain how he had come about his injury the blonde tugged him out of the shower and made quick work of getting both dry and into clean clothes.
“The Founders?” whatever the Headmaster had expected to hear Harry caught a glimpse in his expression that it wasn’t that, Harry shook his head.
“Well, our rounds are almost up, we just have to sweep the Great Hall and then we can head back to the common room,” Harry started to head towards the dungeon when a hand at his elbow stopped him.
As his thoughts trailed to the older woman Harry felt an uncomfortable sensation wash over him as he didn’t immediately spot her upon his arrival; she was normally nearby waiting for him.
But then his mind wandered once more, and his eyes traced the area leading to the Restricted Section. Then, in a split second, a plan began to form.
The trio headed down to the huge doors of the school’s entrance and waited patiently for the wave of students to arrive. It was a little bit before dinner and Harry knew that they didn’t have long to wait.
The shield shimmered and vanished immediately after the spell had hit it, “Concentrate, Potter!” came the snarky order from across the room.
Arriving at the Apparition spot that they had left from not a mere two hours ago Harry felt a wave of exhaustion coarse over him. The adrenaline that had fueled him not thirty minutes ago had bled out of his body.
“Mister Zabini, I told you that Mister Malfoy needed his rest,” she sighed, her eyes immediately clocking the new visitor.
“ ---and I mean even though they were betrothed to each other the terms were to be canceled if Draco had ever found his mate,” Harry turned sharply.
“He wasn’t there, he never showed, we were going to go over chapter thirteen because we debated about it, but not chapter twelve, he said that one was too easy,” she was rambling and Harry reached out and put a hand on her shoulder, his heart was pounding, and he felt sick to his stomach yet he attempted to give her a reassuring look.
Trying to not squirm underneath Draco’s adoring expression Harry slowly peeled back the wrapping and held his breath, lifting the lid Harry’s eyes went wide.
“Here,” taking some solace that the man didn’t want anything to happen to one of his only two heir’s, regardless of being in a dream, Harry edged forward and pressed the lid of the tomb off. It fell with a clatter and Harry’s stomach eased as he realized that the tomb was void of a body, yet a small leather-bound book was in the center.
“I’m not even sure what I’m suppose to do when I give Tom the locket, will the Horcrux just reattach to him?” Harry asked out loud; the group had found a different empty classroom and transformed it to a study room and Hermione had ward the door so that it only recognized the six of them. Blaise had displayed his Transfiguration skill and gave everyone their own table and chair; at Draco’s whine he had even put together a mini potions area.
“Interesting, and you just readily accepted a relationship with someone that you have fought with for years?” she sniped.
“Why are there so many rooms?” Harry asked as Draco turned around another corner, the blonde tilted his head to the side.
Harry had aimed the explosive spell at the wall next to one of his attackers, while he knew they were aiming to kill, he wasn’t.
“Curious,” peering towards Salazar’s voice Harry couldn’t make of the man’s face as he watched his chin jut towards the door.
It was the third of June and just two days from Draco’s seventeenth birthday and Harry had finally managed to find time to put memories into the stone and wrap the gift. They’d have exams on his birthday and the day after, but he knew he could coax his mate into an hour or so of time to themselves seeing as they only had a few moments in between exams to spend with one another.
“I need you to find out more information from the Slytherin’s, whose families have direct ties with Tom, better yet, if you’re able to get a confession from Mister Malfoy regarding his father’s ties with the raid’s that have been conducted we may be able to bring him in for questioning,” biting his tongue until he tasted blood Harry had to control his anger at the blatant disregard for the Slytherin students.
Nearing the restroom Harry’s stomach did a flip as he noticed that Malfoy and a few other Slytherins were standing in the doorway, expecting some sort of spectacle he crept by doing his best to go unnoticed.
“I’ll need your help in destroying the Horcruxes as you’re destined to defeat him Harry,” the nauseous feeling came back and the hair on the back of his neck prickled.
“Have a seat Harry,” the blonde whispered and with another flick of his wand two candles lit themselves, Harry fidgeted as the air between them sparked.
“You’re skilled with that voice Draco, you should ease off it for the night,” he said sweetly and ignored the growl coming from the teen beneath him. Trailing kisses down the blonde’s neck he nipped at Draco’s sensitive spots, eliciting groans from under him, letting go of Draco’s wrists he pressed his mouth against the blonde’s ear.
Flagley was small with only a few shops lining the main street; a handful of people were milling about, and none seemed to pay him any mind as he took in the various buildings. There was a bookstore, a coffee shop, an Optometrist, and a few clothing shops; spotting the Potts Inn, Harry made a beeline for the entrance taking note of the vacancies sign next to the front door.
It was half of an hour later that the trio headed back to the Slytherin common room; Draco’s hand hadn’t left Harry’s shoulder and Blaise was acting as a buffer trailing a few steps behind them. Only a few students were wandering about and Harry ignored their surprised looks, there was something bigger going on than house rivalries.
For weeks Harry had been having unusual dreams. Not dreams of torture or of the death of his godfather, or even of his parents, but dreams of a manor he had never seen before. Hallways leading to various rooms; the library, a study, a kitchen, the banquet area, countless bedrooms and rooms filled with valuable trinkets.
Enough time had elapsed where it was nearing the early hours of the morning. Harry’s wrist was throbbing from his earlier incident and the bond between him and Draco was still numb. Tom’s frustration had escalated, and he had set fire to the drapes hanging in front of the window, Harry had winced and only hoped that Missus Malfoy wouldn’t be too angry.
The five believed that was due to his nightmares from Voldemort and Harry didn’t correct them, Ron groaned that he had been doing more studying then relaxing all while Neville and Hermione commended him.
There were a few steps, then nothing, then another few steps, and it was after the third time that the pattern repeated that Harry realized that the person was checking in each of the shower stalls, taking a deep breath Harry pushed aside the curtain and turned towards the footsteps with his wand raised.
Hello everyone! I know it has been a while, this story hasn’t been abandoned I promise. I’ve struggled with my mental health this year and have found many things difficult to do. This chapter was equally as frustrating because I felt like I was rushing the plot just to fill a word count.
Harry spent the next week leading up to his first date feeling happier than he had in a while. Hermione had tried prying out of him what had put him in such spirits, but Harry just waved away her questions, he still wasn’t ready to tell his best friend that he was a Veela’s mate. Neville was less intrusive and since the beginning of term the two had become closer than when they both were in Gryffindor. Luna kept shooting him perceptive glances and Harry was convinced she somehow knew everything.
Draco stood up and tugged at Harry’s hand and he stood up slowly, not completely sold on the idea that they should leave then for Malfoy manor. Though as Draco pulled him towards the door, he cocked his head to the side.
“I can’t imagine that it would be easy,” voiced Neville from his spot next to Luna; Harry had glanced towards Hermione, but she was too engrossed in her discussion with Blaise to have heard him.
“No sir, it had apologized for the inconvenience and that was it,” when Dumbledore didn’t respond Harry snuck a peek and the man was staring off behind him, thinking.
Walking up the curved stairs Harry took a deep breath as his hand settled against the wood door, he relaxed his mind and pressed at the boundaries surrounding his thoughts. He had discussed it in depth with both Draco and Blaise what information that he would tell the Professor as saying that he didn’t learn anything would raise suspicion.
Making his way down towards the end of the Slytherin table Harry sat himself as far away as he possibly could from the other students. He didn’t dare look up. He could feel every eye on him in the Great Hall and he barely registered that Dumbledore had stood up, encouraged the students to enjoy their meals, and retire for the evening.
As Harry sat down in one of the chairs nearest to the front of the classroom he watched as the Potions master sat at his desk with a raised brow. As the minutes ticked by Harry fidgeted in his seat and the man let out an exasperated sigh.
“We don’t know what happened, he was flying one minute and then the next he had stopped and seemed to be having a fit and he fell off his broom,” bile rose in the back of Harry’s throat and everything that he was feeling was replaced with heavy guilt.
“Fine, whatever you think is best Draco,” he said sweetly, and he watched as Draco shifted nervously in his spot.
Draco sighed, “Plangetine is a magical flower that has to be picked as it blooms, which is only during the moonlight in the winter months. While it’s somewhat rare, only found in certain areas in Europe, we’re in luck and some should be found in the Forbidden Forest,” Draco paused, “and well, our best chance at finding some is tomorrow night.”
“No, Mister Potter, you haven’t done anything wrong,” she didn’t say anything more as she turned and headed into the manor.
He cried himself to sleep that night, mourning the lack of Draco, but curled around his snake who had hissed his comfort until he had fallen into a deep sleep.
The room looked the same as it had earlier that morning when they had checked on the potion. It needed to simmer for twelve hours before it was ready to be used.
“Having a mate that’s incapable of feeding themselves is beneath a Malfoy, Draco,” the younger Veela rose an eyebrow.
” said Harry and he could feel his emotion channel through his spell and the results were something he, nor anyone else, had expected.
“Harry, Professor Snape had said that you were attacked in the dungeon?” worry laced the man’s tone and Harry tried to sit up from where Draco had held his shoulder down, the room spun and Harry laid back once more.
There were only light touches along sensitive skin before sharp raps at the door had them pulling apart. Blaise appeared as Draco opened the door, dark eyes skimming him with concern.
“This is a Portkey Harry, it’ll be activated if you say Muggleborn, and take you to the Apparition spot down by the lake. I want you to have this in case you find yourself in a situation where you need to leave immediately,” he said gravely, and Harry gave his best reassuring smile as he pocketed the item.
“Well Mister Potter, due to that little outburst, I expect you and Mister Malfoy to clean up the remnants of the ingredients. Once that is completed you two are dismissed,” retreating back to his office attached to the classroom Harry sagged in relief as the door shut with a click.
Blaise was hesitant to separate from them as Draco maneuvered Harry back to his room but only walked off with the promise that he would see both first thing the following morning.
“I’ve noticed your grades have improved drastically Harry, your parents would have been very proud of you,” standing somewhat shakily Harry nodded his goodbye as he walked down the spiral stairs.
“Professor! Professor, what is going on here?” a cry from the table had Harry inching his way around a figure whose back was turned towards him, he could just make out the straps that bound the person’s feet.
“I’ve never seen a student display magic like you did this evening, I could feel the power behind your spells. How far along are you with your wandless skills?” Harry fumbled; he hadn’t been prepared that anyone would have figured out this secret.
Seeing stars Harry staggered upwards, vision swimming, as he tried to make out who was coming towards him. The red hair was a giveaway and bracing for a spell Harry was caught off guard as he felt a burst of pain blossom on his cheek from where Ron’s fist had connected with it, followed shortly by another.
“Draco, I – I’m, Draco, I’m so sorry that you wound up in the hospital wing, that you got hurt because of me, I’m an awful mate and I understand if you didn’t want me anymore and I should have told you where I was going but I didn’t want to distract you during your Quidditch match, I know how important Quidditch and winning the house cup is to you, and I,” Harry hated that he had tears in his eyes, the Dursley’s had literally beat any emotion out of him from a young age so whenever he was overwhelmed with any feeling he didn’t know how to cope.
His magic put up one of the strongest wards he had spelled to date; instinctively his magic sought out Seviper and warded his friend, though after that Harry succumbed to his emotions.
“I know Hermione, I didn’t think any of this could be real, I wanted to be sure that it was before I told you, any of you,” Neville gave him a weak smile as Luna’s lip trembled, Hermione tugged at the strands of her hair.
It was two short steps as Draco neared him and Harry couldn’t control his mirth anymore, stepping backwards he turned to make his way to the bathroom as strong arms wrapped around his middle and he let out a bout of laughter as Draco pulled him down onto his bed and his mind was immediately consumed with the taunting lips and the fingers that played with the zipper on his pants.
“I need to talk to you guys,” he whispered urgently, enough time had passed that students were making their way towards dinner and Dumbledore’s speech.
The four moved slowly, Harry’s labored breathing and Esmelda’s sniffles filling the silence and after a few turns Esmelda inhaled sharply as they came up on a motionless figure. Blaise transferred Esmelda to Draco as Harry gripped her shoulders, hearing a sigh Blaise waved his wand over the boy.
“I’m out of town and wasn’t really wanting to bump into anyone while I was here,” Harry said as casually as he could muster. Walking towards his stack of books Harry reasoned he could read for another hour or so.
“This is a Pensieve Harry; witches and wizards have the capability of pulling out memories, storing them in vials, and then,” Dumbledore uncorked the vial and let the contents drip in, “going back to look at those memories,” the liquid began to shimmer and Dumbledore had Harry get close to the magical artifact.
More awake than he usually was on the first day Harry made quick work of finding his shower supplies and heading towards the bathrooms. Malfoy hadn’t pointed it out but after getting turned around a few times he finally found it. Grateful that he was the only one around Harry went about his morning routine in some semblance of normality.
Tossing on one of his few outfits that hadn’t come from Dudley and wasn’t torn in random places Harry made his way to Sophia who looked just as frazzled as the afternoon he had arrived.
A chorus of greetings rang out to him and even Blaise and Draco as the first years chatted about their holidays, it was the fifth year Prefect that had come over to them and reminded them about dinner in the Great Hall and Harry watched with amusement as the five, eleven-year old’s rushed to the dungeon’s to drop their things off.
The trio spent the remainder of the evening working on homework and talking; Harry found out that Blaise wanted to be a Curse-Breaker while Draco was undecided between a Ministry official and an Arithmancer. Harry had explained that while everyone assumed that he would become an Auror and face-off with evil, he was undecided about that line of work.
“Well, that explains your stay with us here,” she tutted lightly and snapped her fingers once more and Harry watched as Luci took the empty trays and disappeared once more.
Snape’s eyes immediately found the group on the couch and for a split-second Harry swore a flash of panic washed over the man. Both Rupert and Adaline, who had followed him inside, were giving him a brief rundown of what had transpired in the last few minutes and the few students that had been sent to retrieve the Professor were ushering the younger years into the dorms.
When the screaming finally stopped Harry forced himself to stand and swayed on his feet. Looking towards Draco’s body heaped on the floor he took a wobbly step towards him; a flash of blue came in between him, and his mate, and furious silver eyes stared down at him.
The following week Harry had been in such high spirits that Blaise had sworn there was a spring in his step.
“I want everyone out, NOW,” the shrill to her voice didn’t go unnoticed and students were quick to pack up their items and head for the door.
“You’re mine,” the blonde roared and in a blink of an eye Harry found himself pressed up against the closed door and Draco’s tongue pressing against his own.
He had seen Draco topless before and he had seen Draco naked – though typically in lower light, but seeing him now, hair skewed and his lean body walking towards him, Harry felt as if his body was on fire.
The dungeon space wasn’t large, only a handful of rooms; some were locked while others just opened to an empty space. As his fingertips trailed the cold wall of stone he paused at the door at the end of the hallway. It was one that didn’t open, and he never felt inclined to force it.
“I am aware of your adventure to Flagley this summer Harry and I’m most disappointed in your choice to leave the safety of your family. Mister Spaulding is a friend of the Order and was kind enough to reach out and make me aware of your location,” Harry’s hand clenched the doorknob tight enough that his knuckles turned white, “I’ve reached out to the Dursleys and they were most upset that you left and will be happy to see you return home at the end of the school year,” his tone left no room for discussion but Harry didn’t care, he was angry, he was mad, he felt so betrayed.
