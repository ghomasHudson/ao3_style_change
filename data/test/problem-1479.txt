"Yes, it seems like they can't make up their minds as to whether that goes in the column for
Harry sat quietly for a minute, wondering how best to phrase it. "I mean, Muggles can be the same way. My aunt and uncle couldn't tell what they hated about me more—that I had magic, or that I was odd."
"It's not a big deal
"They clocked your coat as Muggle," Harry smoothed a finger over the black line of Draco's lithe body in the photograph. He kept catching the baseball cap Harry tossed to him, wind rustling his dark hair. The image was a little fuzzy—likely enlarged, the three of them caught initially in the background of someone else's family photo. Harry internally chastised himself—they likely wouldn't have been recognized at all if he'd kept the hat on, pulled low to his sunglasses. He’d been selfish to take it off to go up on the air. The front page, because he didn't want to use a sticking charm on the hat. He felt a need to be punished for this oversight, and stewed in the feeling, hoping it would pass. Maybe so—maybe not. Maybe, probably, it was the sort of thing he’d bring to Martin and have him explain why that reaction was normal, but not healthy for him.
He eyed Harry warily while shovelling an enormous portion of steaming curry into his mouth. When he went to reach for his wand, Harry remembered himself and shook his head.
"Buck up," he whispered.
"You want me how?" He smiled, devilish, teeth gleaming in the moonlight. "You have me right now, pet; I'm trying to—"
"Do you want me to go into detail?"
Draco's only saving grace was that because he worked in Mysteries, his name wasn't on any official scrolls of employees, so his movements were difficult to track within the building. By the end of the first week, Hermione suggested that they come over and spend the evening in, which was a much-needed break for the monotony of hiding inside Grimmauld. For his first-time visiting, Draco made himself at home instantly, claiming the corner of the couch that was usually Harry's as his own, and surprising his friends when he suggested that they eat curry
"We can’t, erm. How do we, uh." Harry ran a nervous hand through his hair. They couldn't be seen leaving together—far too obvious. And where was it that they could go together?
"Er. No. No, I've never done any drugs."
“Harry, come on now, readers were dying to know. How’d your ex take the news? Is it true she caught you with her brother, causing the breakup that shook wizarding Britain? Harry! Harry!”
He teased Harry about his own workload—
"Based on your injuries I'd hazard a guess that you fell over a storey, managed a fracture on both sides of your jaw, and bit into your cheek—don’t get me started on how difficult it was to knit that hole back together. You've an impact fracture on your right wrist that is going to take weeks to heal properly—no training for a month—and we might as well take out the bruised ribs, the way you treat them.” She tapped her fingers on the steel piping of the bed frame. Cold, exposed so that handcuffs could easily be employed on any part of the beds. Cruel efficiency for the Ministry’s finest. Penelope’s look softened. “But I suppose they keep saving your internal organs from constant puncturing, so we'll let you keep them, this time."
Ron flicked his wand, sending a dribble of water to splash him in the face. Harry was fast and sent up a shield charm, dispersing the stream into a fine mist.
"I will not leave the cottage," she looked at Molly when she said that. They were thick as thieves—Harry assumed that when the end came, Molly would be the friend Andromeda counted on to handle the affairs of her estate. "That's where I married Ted, it's where I raised my child, and it will be where I die. I've been very clear on that in my will, and St Mungo's has a plan in place that includes palliative home care. I'll be comfortable. The question isn't about where I will live out the rest of my days, but when the time comes that I can no longer care for Teddy, where will he go?"
"Sure you do," Ron frowned at his empty drink and grabbed Harry by the arm to drag him back to the bar. "Here, help me get a fucking round and bring these over and stop your scowling." He leaned over the bar, yelling, "Oi! Harry Potter down here, and he's mighty thirsty," which had the beneficial effect of getting the bartender to look at them and walk over, and the negative of every other set of eyes within 50 paces doing the same.
Harry shrugged, though his heart had started beating heavy in his chest. "Beats me."
Malfoy sniffed and shook his head. "We won. He won it. I think he collected a memory or two from some Muggles who know me."
"I don't want to—it would feel like cheating." Harry's heart and stomach swapped places at the thought. He loved Draco, and Draco loved him. It was simple—they were together, them, and anyone else entering the picture was an intruder on their lives. Other people were threats—simple.
His arrival at Grimmauld was announced loudly with a string of fierce cursing as his thigh knocked into the kitchen table's rough corner.
"Harry, before you go. I've meant to tell you—your friend was excellent with Edward," she said, a knowing smile on her face. Harry was careful not to let his surprise show on his.
that he somehow, through osmosis, knew the words to. It lasted until the gentleman at the cashier informed him that he best buy the hairbrush he'd been spit singing into or to move along. And while he wouldn't call the effort a lost cause, it seemed that Draco's store of smiles had been used up in the morning, and nothing Harry did in the shop could change that.
There was little talk of brooms though once they reached the house, many winter layers peeled off, and so very many mugs of tea and coffee and mead and hot cider doled out. Conversation quickly moved on to empty, growling bellies and who had control of the wireless, and where-did-I-leave-that and the real showstopper of the holiday—The Wedding. Every other word was about the when of it, and how the proposal had gone and were Hermione’s parents not simply thrilled. It was joyous and pure and helped Harry push thoughts of Draco almost completely from his mind as he relaxed into the casual conversations and lazy games of the late morning, and he really would have barely thought about him at all until Andromeda caught him on his way upstairs for a sneaky nap before lunchtime.
Not that he wanted it to be a big affair. Harry was as surprised as anybody that it was still a secret. Considering how much slagging around in Muggle bars he'd managed to fit into the latter half of his days of Auror training, it was a miracle in and of itself that the story hadn't broken already.
Malfoy held his eyes a moment longer before erupting in belly-deep laughter, the sound pounding Harry's brain into submission.
“Simply wan.” His voice was pockmarked, throat abraded by too many tubes.
"So the story goes that once upon a time, I looked the stereotype of a twink. And it was easy to lean into, so I did, even though it meant that nearly everyone also assumed that I bottomed—"
Harry didn't bother to try to flounder for reasons. "Yeah. I wanted to ask about it earlier, but it hadn't come up. You're so good with kids, and with him, I thought—"
Harry looked to it, imagined the fit in which Draco had chucked the device, how he probably hadn't been aiming for the window. How everything was back in order now, the pane replaced, smooth again. A dark mirror that held them both in the darkness of another bleak night in the city.
It was nearly midnight, and the party was winding down, giving Harry the chance to slip out of the Great Hall on the falsehood that he was popping to the loo. He'd prowled around for a specific hallway, one that he hadn't visited in over a decade, and of course, Justin had to get in the way of his searching.
"Why?"
Harry felt his shoulders rising, indecisiveness building in him. He pulled the blanket tighter around his side, wishing for something to fiddle with.
charms above to glow up, low, as he reaches every third step down.
"Let me remind everyone because Harry won't do it for himself," Ginny said, giving Neville's hand a squeeze, "that who he dates is his choice, not ours. Which is a blessing, because if it was in all of your hands, he and I might still be together and that would be awful for everybody."
charms incrementally in the rooms Draco liked to study in.
Harry swallowed the fear rising in him, walked over and dropped back onto the floor. He drew his wand and attempted a few spells before landing on one that electrified the device in his hand, causing Draco to gasp when Harry pressed the ON button, and the box flicked abruptly to life.
Like hadn't learned the sounds he made when he came.
"Yes. Twelve." Draco stopped his pacing and wiped his hands down the front of his shirt, looking at where they pressed over his flat stomach. "Here I am now, still stuck in this fucking body." He cracked his knuckles and looked around, up at the eves, down to his feet, then at Harry. "It's hot in here, isn't it? Can we go outside? I need air."
Draco paused from pulling off his shoes to look at Harry. They were glittery boots, something exceptional that Harry hadn't seen before. "Are you sure about that? It's going to hurt."
"No," he said hoarsely. He coughed into a fist and placed the hand back onto Draco's chest.
Draco started to smooth his thumb upwards from Harry's wrist, edging slowly up. Then he did it again, gently pushing as though he were wringing nervousness out through his fingertips. When he finished with one hand, he laid it down and started on the other. His eyes didn’t leave this work. Harry watched too, as hands burned and smooth took his, broad and callused, and caressed them.
More breathing. Rushed. Shallow. Harry's stomach shrank to the size of a walnut. He needed a full sentence out of Draco, to make what was happening make sense.
Harry gestured at the chair but the healer pursed his lips.
“What did you swallow?”
"Has anyone ever told you that sometimes you eat like a—”
Harry stumbled into the blackness, immediately poked and prodded by branches.
"What's this about a party, Harry?"
"Enough talk of other people for one night," Draco said as he held out a hand, his eyes latching on to Harry's and refusing to let go. "Come to bed with me."
, not me."
Harry was about to ask more about Draco’s abrupt appearance but he was on him in an instant, his mouth practically spicy with the mint of his gum, which Harry felt as his tongue roamed his mouth.
"I'm not joking," Harry said, and he held his eyes this time. "I'm serious. You're amazing."
"How you get him back, obviously," she said, flicking a glance to Ron. "They'll drag Justin in with the full force of the law, make sure he never touches you again. But the news media, we can't control. Frankly, without you on the cover of the goss rags, they've been grasping around for scandals, and this is going to be awful."
Harry fidgeted. His skin felt weird. He couldn't tell what he needed, other than for this conversation to end.
"So," Hermione summoned a quill and bit of parchment from the side-table next to her and pulled an ancient tome from under the couch to perch it on. "What's the plan?"
help. If you break my concentration, I'll force you through my stretching routine with me, and you'd likely lose the use of your hamstrings, permanently."
He booked out the back-room to the Leaky Cauldron for Ginny and Neville's return from their holidays, hosting most of Dumbledore's Army and the Weasley clan for a casual evening. It was an overcompensation, and he knew it—going above and beyond to radiate that his relationship with Ginny was healthy and normal and that he wasn't in the least jealous that she'd fallen in love within six months of their breakup, gotten engaged within another three.
Harry mouthed a silent
"No, don't do that—it's
"How's that?" Harry asked as he wrapped his fingers around the shaft and worked it up and around, spreading the meagre lube around. Draco made a high sound, cut off too soon in his throat, and nodded.
"Uh, yeah, sorry," Harry removed his glasses and washed a hand over his face. "Sorry. I've been, erm, distracted lately. The Burrow." He replaced his glasses, took a deep breath, and started running through the memory like a film he had watched, rather than a night he'd experienced.
"Exhausted, but alive. Wong's got us trying this new Muggle system for development called
"Letters are the way to go," Ron said. "With a mobile, if he doesn't answer, he doesn't have to listen. But he's far too curious to burn a letter. Don't worry, mate—Hermione's right on that front—he won't be able to help but read them."
"It doesn't matter what it's like! It's going to look like I rode your dick for a promotion, and you know what? Now they won't be half wrong."
Malfoy looked from it to him, puzzled and sour, and snatched it to push it into his eyes.
“Thank you for returning this.”
"I mean—
"Honestly, you give me a hard time for being difficult to speak to, and all the while you could be Echo reincarnate, yes, running, the activity by which—"
"Okay," Harry nodded, thinking it through. "We could try for dinners too, sometimes. And, I—I’d like it if you would stay the night."
"Plain?" Harry supplied. Draco scrunched up his nose.
"Dress, please."
"When is that?"
"Relax," he answered, and Harry shifted, bringing his knees closer to his armpits, pressing his forehead into the mattress, which only served to give him a front-row view to his untouched cock.
"Yes, start times," she said, her annoyance clear. "Some of them have a morning start, and for a few, you'll need to work with Reza on outfit changes; I'm sorry, but yes, sometimes it's better if you stack a couple of events in a single day and don't give me that look. We'll do the tell-all interview in a few weeks."
"You're leaving?" Harry asked.
"What do you know about him?" This time, Justin laughed intensely. It echoed back at them from a brick wall at twenty paces, a chorus of laughter at Harry's expense. Harry bristled, and something else exploded. Another streetlamp, though within the park, this time. Darkness was fast descending all around them even though the scene on the street only grew louder, but he didn't have the energy to spare caring about all the evidence of outbursts he was leaving behind in his wake.
"What's on the menu tonight, pet?" he asked, and a surge of erotic energy pulsed through Harry, from his spine to his lower belly to the base on his cock. He shivered as he one took one of Draco's hands in his own, interlocking their fingers.
"As if you can transfigure a linen-silk blend."
The right leg was worse than the left. Harry vanished the gloves and set a quill to take notes.
It was quick; Draco panted into Harry's ear as he slid in and out, and Harry had a wonderful view of his arse tightening up as he came on a sigh, trembling, inside of him. He loved watching the tendons and muscles of Draco's back working in time while he fucked him and then, with a spasm, relax after he came. Harry sometimes found his own green eyes disconcerting in the mirror, but he didn't spend much of the time looking at himself, no matter what Draco asked of him. When Draco pulled out he lingered, kissing the black hair at Harry's temple; Harry felt rich beyond measure at that moment; sated, well-fucked. He certainly looked it, his hair a halo of black frizz on the white coverlet under him.
“What are you going to do about it exactly? These boots wet dream of a pirate-turned-figure-skater for God’s sake, watching you pick at the knots is like watching a toddler attempt to julienne, will you just fucking—”
"What if I told you that even before I knew what we know now, I hid your response to the realtor from going out with the post on Friday because I wanted you to have a few days to back out?"
Harry swapped them out for his old pair and was astonished at the immediate difference.
, Harry realized,
"Hmm. I guess I think about what belongs. Like, sweat is fine. And then I think about what doesn't belong, like come. Or spit," he shrugged, "you know."
"I’ve had my fun, Potter. More than most, less than some. And so far as alternative arrangements are concerned, I’ve never much minded being the other man. Nobody’s ever been under the delusion that we were to run off together into the sunset."
, that it wasn't the feat of wandless magic that had caught his attention. Harry opened his eyes to both of them, staring back from the full-length mirror conjured by his subconscious to reveal them to themselves.
"Don’t be like that," the person who’d walked into him said, and though his eyes were watering and his glasses fully askew, he could tell that the face coming close to a second time was that of Justin Finch-Fletchley. And he wasn’t coming in close—he closed the distance between them, hand to Harry's cheek and locked onto Harry’s lips with a cold kiss that tasted faintly of pennies.
"It's called ask the damn question."
"You can lick up your spunk next time," Harry said with a sly smile, that Draco returned with his eyes closed. He watched as Draco's panting body make the shape of the letter
His toes curl in black socks, his spit on your cock inadequate for this job, but you say nothing. What can you say? You both know you've got other options, but are too heady for this, now, to care to figure out what they might be.
Harry looked up at the words, incongruous with the situation they found themselves in. "What?"
"I—I do," Harry stammered. He wiped his palms down his thighs, exhaled. "I was a git. I should have known better, and I'll do better. I'm not great with words, though, so if there's something I've missed, you'll have to let me know."
He'd been nervous as soon as he woke, staring up into dark eaves above his bed. His shower wank was indecently focussed on blowing someone with an Etonian accent, a turn-on he hated admitting even to himself, and then, to top it all of, he'd been inordinately nervous as every combination of t-shirt and trousers that usually felt comfortable suddenly didn't work, were too shabby, too old.
"Anything I can to make you look at me like that," Draco said, and then he was moving, straddling him, rubbing his wet, leaking cock against Harry's and doing things with his teeth at his neck that made him shiver. Harry squeezed his eyes shut again, face twisted to the side, and he wished for only one thing, and as he thought it, it came into being.
His stomach was full of churning stones. He hadn't felt fear like this in so long.
Harry attempted his most innocent look at the witch, doe eyes in full-force. He batted his eyelashes a few times for good measure.
Harry read and re-read the words. There was the name he was searching for, today's date and the time left vague, though they'd be forced to wrap up and break by end-of-day—Ministry employees wouldn't go into overtime on a Friday afternoon, not for some little hearing. It was nothing less than a gift from some higher power—a sign.
variety.
"Something like that."
"That ponce back there cut me up over nothing when we were kids.
Draco bobbed his head languorously as the air in the room began to grow warm from the combined heat of their bodies. His tongue applied just the right amount of pressure to the vein along the underside of Harry's prick, something that would fast be his undoing.
"He's the reason people died; how can you forget that?"
The moment dragged out until Malfoy abruptly continued pulling at his laces.
Harry dressed slowly; he didn't have anywhere to be. When they said goodbye, Oliver told him he was welcome over any time—to find him on the chat board, or to text him.
"Life's not fair! Tough shit!" Draco's breaths heaved out of him as he stalked over to the sink, and Harry wondered if he was going for the wine glasses too, but he just stood there, a hand on either side of the white tile and gulped breaths, his head low and shoulder blades high, like wings escaping his back.
, if only they tried, that things, one day, would be normal. This would be normal—they would be able to rib one another, and Draco would slot in alongside Harry's friends who were indeed his family, and Harry would come to know more of Draco's very secretive past, learn the names of the friends he rarely mentioned, peel back the layers until he was invited to know the Draco that existed at the core of the one that the world got to see. Harry could picture his future, and it was wonderful.
bravado and swagger over for a chat with the Minister about what could come up related to my position," he said. A change in subject as self-preservation. "I don't feel like losing my career over nothing twice. And while you're at it, perhaps it would be worthwhile to get your barrister—"
Draco’s heart is suffused with tenderness to see him behind those bars. The way he kneels, holding still and oh so quiet, is a quiet kind of respect. Draco’s glad he’s done this today, after a string of accidents the week previous. Regurgitated chicken liver on the Savonnerie carpet Louis XV gifted to the Malfoy’s seven generations past wasn’t an ideal situation, ever, but it was worse because he’d shat on it the day before. The manor was large, after all, and full of secrets. He hadn’t been in the house long enough to learn its halls, and the carpet-ruining seemed to be connected to hearing Lucius’s voice. They’d work on that.
"If you want to talk about forgetting, how about the fact that I forgot your birthday this year?"
Then, "Draco."
"Have this if that means that you'll fuck me properly, for god's sake," she ground out. Her cheeks were red hot, eyes unable to keep from falling to Harry's prick, shining all over, the slit wet with milky precome.
"That's one way to put it," Andromeda scoffed. "I didn't know that your parents kept the place in Toulouse."
“Xu’s an institution,” he remembered being told in training shortly before he met her following the lorry incident.
"I’ve gathered as much," Harry said.
"Just put the bloody coat on so we can go. It's a Muggle club. No one will recognize you anyway—I can guarantee it. Now hurry up before I decide to leave without you and dance up on some miserable, miserly old man who hates fun, who would make an entirely acceptable replacement for you."
first times, which Harry could do without overhearing. Luna frowned down at the ground, pretending great interest in the sod between her fingers. Perhaps she wasn't pretending, but Harry was quite sure that Draco's words had found their mark.
"What," he grumbled, turning over to face away.
"Something wrong?" Ron asked, piling rice and peas onto his own plate and levitating it over to Hermione. "Is it cold? I can heat it right back up."
"Just popping out for a minute," he said to the empty dining room, walking its length to peek into the kitchen. "Oh, running errands in Diagon. Won't be a minute. Want me to grab you anything?"
“I could do without that part, but those were learning experiences.” He looked away when he added, "If you wanted to, you know—explore, you could do that, too. Conduct your own experiments."
brought up. There was a pair of seasons tickets to the ballet already purchased, sitting idly at the bottom of his sock drawer, ready for the occasion. Pansy was working with him on a dinner reservation at the Shard—it would be exorbitant to book the amount of private space they'd need, but Harry didn't care. It was a new year, and he wanted to make the most of any and all excuses to bring their loved ones together and celebrate.
as many times as he had, or been cut, or fallen, or burned, the meaning of a pain scale changed. Yes, there was a strain in his right shoulder—a building pressure, like it might be liable to pop out if pressed. But he didn't want Draco to stop. Anything less than an eight he could pretend didn't exist, anyways.
Kreacher made some grumbling noises, wringing his hands. As much as he hated Harry's cadre of friends, he adored Draco, would do anything to please him, and it clearly tore him up to agree, but in the end, the choice was obvious.
"I really am sorry," Draco continued lazy circles around the nipple and slid his other hand purposefully back over Harry’s shaft, pulling the foreskin up over the head and then stretching it down. Harry opened sleepy eyes and tossed the blankets back so they could both watch him do it, the swollen red head of his prick revealed on the downstroke.
The feeling of foreboding settling throughout Harry's body lifted a little at the mention of Luna. He clung to this one piece of good news among the din of Victoria's demands.
With Kreacher’s help, he'd installed raised beds in the rocky space, visibly empty but teeming with seeds that promised snap peas and green beans and varietals of tomatoes they hadn’t known existed until a week prior. The spiky bushes of tea roses had crawled around the corner from their secret origin in the earth, and that's where Draco sat, staring at something that looked like a small, rotting onion, brown skin fluttering in the breeze.
"Then, why?" Harry asked, returning to the table. "Why did you stay away all this time? It doesn't make sense, Draco. Make it make sense for me."
Harry placed his ring on the side table. He didn't have to check to know that it would be a perfect fit. A crash was coming—his elation was the latest in a series of waves of emotion that were leaving him exhausted. There was so much to talk about, and feel, and plan—but not tonight. Tonight was only the end of one day, and tomorrow another day would break, and then another after that.
"Oh pet," Cissy panted, let go of his hair and patted it down. When Harry opened his eyes again, the coughing over, and looked up at her, it was up and into a gaze of absolute worship. He was lightheaded, had to close his eyes and rest his brow on a slip of that wonderful, smooth white skin of thigh revealed above the sheer perfection of tights held high by satin garters.
"Yeah?" he breathed. "You want to?"
Harry’s fingers itched to tug his bandages higher, but he couldn’t trust himself not to unwrap them and trace the edges of the newly knitted skin. In the years since Draco graduated from former schoolmate to constant patient, he’d constellated himself with scars. There was one forming on his face from the crash, a crash Harry had carefully avoided details of. A switchback and a cliff and a tree, and the fact that it wasn’t an accident or a suicide attempt but what Draco thought of as a
A toasting seed on the stove popped, and Ron turned to take over from the automated movements of the spatula, breaking something stuck to the pan off and lowering the flame under it with a flick of his wand. Hermione looked from him to Harry, back again, and huffed, entering the room properly.
“That’s quite enough,” he said. “Thank you,” offered quietly.
of Kreacher Apparating into the room that they each jumped twice; Ron letting out two, successive, tiny screams.
"I'm serious." Ron was looking directly at him now, doing a poor job of containing his anger. "Answer the goddamn question."
"Malfoy," Harry started.
"In the magazine? I did," he said, innocently as could be. "Your godfather has perfect form on a broom, you know. He’s a natural—just like you."
"You stole that idea from Hermione, you know."
"Oh, pet," Draco cooed, "come here to me." He held out a hand, and Harry walked to him and took it in his own, threading their fingers together once more.
"Good luck," Harry breathed, and Andromeda guffawed.
That was for one day, though. A someday that probably would never come, but who could see the future, right?
"Here, here—" was his shouted warning, and then he was coming, groaning as come flooded Draco’s mouth. Harry's entire body was like one hot, exposed nerve, his pleasure all-encompassing and complete as Draco dutifully swallowed around him.
Hermione scoffed, "Nonsense!"
"You don't have to, I—wait for, I mean, do you want—"
Harry couldn't help but guffaw.
“I'll see you?" Draco asked. He was either going for nonchalant and succeeding or was genuinely unbothered, and Harry was fucked if he was meant to be able to tell the difference.
Harry sucked lower, waiting for Draco's breathy sounds. He pulled back and off, fascinated by the slick wetness he left behind on half of his prick, a line of saliva connecting his lip to the tip.
, which was a recipe for disaster for anyone other than Malfoy, of course.
Draco leaned in and captured his mouth with his own like he too was parched for a kiss. Harry groaned and groaned and Draco pulled back, whispering, "Better?" and Harry moaned a
Harry took the hand, feeling as though he’d done something wrong. He was always doing the wrong thing, wasn’t he? He was too strange, that's why it wouldn't work; it never worked with him and anybody, not for long. But for some reason, his strange only seemed to amuse Draco, who made the disgruntled sound of sucking his teeth as he began pulling at Harry's erection, and leaned forwards so that they were pressed forehead-to-forehead, both sets of eyes cast downwards.
"How the fuck did this happen?"
"Glass, if you like. I'm at my limit," Draco said. Harry scoffed.
A place for Harry to tap a finger and listen for an echo at Draco’s chest when they were alone. Checking to hear if behind it was only air and feathers.
"You can be such a prick," Harry said, a flush burning the back of his neck. Ron only grinned, giving their order and ignoring the waves of mutiny rolling off Harry in his direction.
"Uh. Yeah. Yes. Your man introduced it in cloistered chambers, so it's not public knowledge."
"Yes," Harry rasped, "yes, I'm yours."
"He does, sometimes. Why?"
"Mmm, is 'Girl Weasley' taken?" Ginny shot back, "Or wasn't it 'She-Weasel'? I forget."
"Sure," he said. He knew it was surlier than he ought to be with her.
Harry hadn't been over to his flat since the Quidditch match nearly a month previous. He felt as though to start calling on Draco would overexpose the weak spot in his heart, the foolish part of him that craved something more even as his brain railed against the concept. In Draco's coming over, Harry held a modicum of power. He couldn't give that up, at least not yet.
"Dra'o?" He struggled to make sounds without choking. "Zatchoo?"
"Someone's about to be reamed out for 'borrowing' that karaoke machine," he said before planting a kiss to Hermione's forehead and slouching out the door.
"Oh," the word puffed out of Draco. Harry looked down at their hands, still entwined. Draco’s grip had intensified, his knuckles starkly white, the blue cast of his veins clearly visible. Andromeda raised a hand to touch his cheek. She looked at him more tenderly then than she ever had before.
"Yes, sir." Harry gasped, needing touch again. "Please, won't you—"
"Coffee, at La Caffeteria," Harry said. Draco's eyes widened a touch. "I could hardly sleep, and I worried over my outfit for ages. Over a t-shirt and jeans. I—" Harry cut himself off for once, as he decided to keep the memory of how he'd gotten hard under the table to himself. The blush that came along with the thought crept across his cheeks nonetheless.
"Stealing my greatest hits and calling them your own. How original of you," Draco groused, and as he opened his mouth with another pithy remark, Harry caught him in a languid kiss that tasted as salty as the sea air from his tears. Harry kissed him until he couldn’t taste them anymore, the kiss becoming heated until finally, Draco pulled back.
"I only mean to say that I've had my chances to fool around and figure out what I like and don’t so much, and I don't want to deny you that same experience."
Harry opened his mouth and was promptly shushed by a look, Draco's almondine eyes drawn tight.
Harry froze in position, holding Pansy's overlarge purse open for her as she scrounged around in it for what, he wasn't sure.
If Harry weren’t blindfolded, this would be the moment that he finally blinked his eyes closed. He won’t let Draco see them once he folds. Never gives him that pleasure.
Harry was too surprised to breathe, but he somehow managed a
Harry continued down the path. He gave a play by play of the sounds, the confusion, the darkness. Blood, and cold, and then the hospital.
"They say the best test of a relationship is to go on vacation together," Draco said.
When he spoke again, he stretched for emphasis, a comfortable silence having descended in the room.
"Ron," George said in a tone without compromise, "outside. Right now." He stood and stalked out, throwing his napkin to his chair with alacrity, leaving Ron to drop his head behind his shoulders and sigh.
Ron shrugged and settled in, rubbing his jaw thoughtfully. The beginnings of a proper beard were coming in, no longer the boyish wisps they'd clung to as teenagers.
"'Tis. I used to be one of those practically hairless gays. When we met, I still was. Thought I had to, to be attractive."
"Old news. Just a shock. I'll uh, be seeing you again soon, I gather."
"I um. Yeah. I think. But nothing absurd."
"Don't say that," Harry's voice was rough, the want to cry rubbing at his throat with sand. They were going to have to leave before he lost control and the evil thing in him was loosed in this room full of innocent people. "I don't want you to get hurt again."
"Kept hush," Ron supplied. Harry swallowed thickly. Sweat beaded at his temples as the temperature in the room soared.
that I prefer—"
Healer Annan's smile didn't falter. "With comprehensive rehabilitation, I'm hopeful for a strong recovery."
"What, Draco," Harry directing his question into his lap. Well, Draco's lap, with his prick still clearly visible, straining behind his fly. Harry felt almost overwhelmingly sad, even more-so than embarrassed. The put down was coming; he could feel it.
"He didn't kill anyone—"
"No plans," he answered Draco. "Breakfast in a minute, and then I'll faff around in the gym for a bit. Can we be lazy until anyone shows up? I'm sore, and I could probably nap unless that ruins things for you?"
“Let me take this one, won’t you?” Harry asked. “I’m ready.”
"It's not that," Molly said, pulling Harry’s jacket from the bannister and worrying it in her hands. Harry was terrified for a moment that she’d hand it to him and ask him to leave.
"Fuck," Draco said, momentarily losing himself as he stared openly at Harry's exposed cock. His soft prick and bollocks hung heavy between his legs, the shaft just beginning to thicken under Draco's salacious stare. Draco palmed his own through the thin wool of his charcoal grey trousers, the outline growing mouthwateringly thick.
Harry spluttered as Draco held his hands in front of him as Harry had to mock-inspect them.
"Yeah." Harry let his hand drift under the blanket, as though it were making the journey of its own accord until two fingers traced the outline of Draco's hipbone. Draco gasped, and Harry shushed him.
"You shouldn't be so trusting of everyone," Draco said finally, putting the book down gently on the table. He smoothed its cover flat and rested his palm on it like it was an animal in need of soothing.
Harry let his shoulders sag a little further, rolling them back to release the tension they held, cracking his neck.
Harry pinched Draco's side, which only served to make him wriggle and swat at the hand that had done it.
“Don’t be cross,” Malfoy sniffles.
"Somebody ought to tell the Prophet," Draco drawled as he loped into the room and collapsed into the sofa next to Harry. He smelled faintly of accelerants and smoke, the ghosts of fires clinging to his clothes. "Here I thought I was dating a war hero, and instead I've bought into the tales of an
he’d become used to casting over his room before sleep, to keep from waking Kreacher with his screams. "I’m an active sleeper," he added, and Draco made a sound of understanding. He didn’t prod, and Harry was grateful. Draco understood the euphemism; Harry knew he wasn’t the only one their age with nightmares.
Gay bashing
Harry watched as the smile drained from his face, knowing it was put on. There was tension around his clear grey eyes, and he looked pinched. Tired, especially for the morning. Everything seemed so calm on the surface, and he knew then that it was time, finally. The scrabbling thoughts were pushing at the lid of the box and it was getting hard to breathe again. He saw Draco's notes, the pluses and minuses, each time he closed his eyes.
"You can kiss me whenever you want to," Harry whispered as Draco's lips roamed his skin; forehead, cheeks, until finally, he stopped, his fingers brushing Harry's lips.
"Blaise and Tilly send their regards. I told them I'd try to bully my way in and report back, so they won't bother trying on their own. Owl Blaise if you need anything."
"Whatever are you on about," Harry whispered, shaking his head. Were they about to watch something about dragons?
, then,” he grits out.
He sat up, head throbbing in time with the rush of blood through his veins. His glasses were lost, but he didn't need them to see the flash of white to his left.
"Nine."
Draco stared at her for a long moment, in his intense, silent way. "How often do you wash your hair?"
"I'm hungry and cranky, but whatever it is you've made, it smells incredible. Can we be terrible and eat on the sofa?"
. Just thinking it made Harry’s mouth pucker like he’d been sucking on a lemon. Ever since his therapist had first introduced the concept to him the week before it had become a thorn in his side, and lucky for him, Hermione read its definition only a few days later. He hated it because it confused him. It implied that both parties in what they thought was a charming relationship could, in fact, be wrong. It turned acts of devotion into the pitiful return of a beaten dog, offering itself up for its latest lashing.
Harry squinted at the clouds gathering before them, a swirling mess of darkening greys and mottled purple and blues, the colour of old bruises, trying to make sense of it all. "But why pretend, you know? Why capitulate to his bullshit at all? For god's sake—you don’t even talk to one another—"
"It is," Harry said. "Also, they don't give new employees offices. Even a dunce like me knows that." Draco shrugged, the closest Harry'd get to having him admit he'd been fibbing.
"Mmm?" She looked to him, one brow raised in question.
"They're your favourite, aren't they?" Draco didn't say anything, but Harry thought that had more to do with tightness in his throat than for lack of wanting.
"Oh, Harry, don't make me blush." A witch with a shock of waist-length salt and pepper hair replied, her tone more bored than teasing. Harry appreciated that she seemed to hate her job about as much as he disliked her for doing it.
"Can I kiss you here?" Draco asked, touching the spot where ear met jaw. Harry nodded, words sticking in his throat.
"You've been throwing up since you were twelve."
"Good."
"Don't care." The smirk had a life of its own now. He had Harry off-kilter, just where he liked him. "Now, back to the fidgeting. You must do something with all that pent up,
"Feels good, pet?" Draco let go of his cock to hold Harry fast by his hips, control all but lost.
Harry stepped out onto the stoop, Draco following behind him, nattering about how he needed to find the right pens, needed Harry to remind him to buy new ones. A flash went off, blinding white, like a clap of human-made lightning. Draco had turned to face the closed door and said the incantation to reinforce the wards, his wand arm lowering slightly as the light enveloped them.
"Six."
"What's so funny?" he asked.
"Circle your fingers around your hole," he said. Cissy nodded, a rush of air slipping through her puffy lips. Her lipstick was gone and still, she looked perfect, absolutely perfect to Harry.
“I’d like to go back to bed, now.” Malfoy spoke softly.
It was a rare thing to surprise Hermione into silence, and the sound of it brought Harry an even more occasional feeling of absolute joy.
"Er, thank you? I think." Draco's eyebrows remained firmly low, his scowl hardly lessening. "I came from my agent’s. You know, Victoria? I told her about you. About us."
"We know," Hermione said into the quiet that followed. Ron nodded grimly, turning away to reduce the flames on the burners behind him down to a bare flicker.
"Unbridled magic is for babies, Potter," he said, lowering his wand. "You need to get a bloody grip."
“Go back,” he says, a blood bubble popping on his lips, and Harry, wide-eyed, stops his crawling. The stomping upstairs reaches the landing, and Draco swallows hard against the rasp of metal on the hardwood.
Draco let out an enormous breath and smiled then, his brilliant smile.
Unfortunately, there was nothing for it. He'd given Victoria his word, and his word was his bond. He shook a few pain pills free of a bottle and knocked them back dry before pouring a liberal three fingers of Firewhisky (passed through the Floo by a very understanding Ron) into a cut-crystal tumbler and left the rest of the pile of sadness to disassemble later. Harry had gotten used to glomming onto Neville's birthday celebration in years previous, but as he was out of the country this time around, he was perfectly happy to save most of the celebrating for the weekend.
“What do we want, boy?”
"That's a wonderful sentiment, dear," Molly said, and he looked up and held her kind brown eyes, and took strength that the love he felt in that room would be more robust than memory or prejudice, hatred or spite. He took a deep breath and looked back to his spoon, stilled it with a motion of his hand.
Draco's eyes flared, the look going straight to Harry's cock. "Oh, how I want to make you pay for that," he said, low.
It was more of a struggle to complete this task than Harry would have understood was possible before he'd started playing these games with Draco. The light seemed like it had intensified since he'd closed them, though, in reality, Draco had dimmed the
"Try," he said, stilling Draco when the crown of his prick slipped past his hole. Draco looked ready to say something, and Harry opened his mind, thinking his thoughts loud and clear, so Draco would not just hear them, but believe them.
Draco leaned back into Harry, a new show of familiarity. They'd developed unspoken rules about touching, like how they did not kiss hello or hug goodbye, but this was the third time Harry had wrapped his arms around him this way, and so far, he hadn't been chastened. This time though, Draco flinched under him and recoiled when he tightened his grip.
"Feelings and everything. He's, uh—he's done a lot of therapy, and he's right that I need it. Need someone to talk to that isn't a friend, or—or him." Harry sighed, raked a hand through his hair, green eyes meeting blue and then brown in turn. His friends looked impossibly hopeful, rapt for his next words. "I'm going to find a Healer I like, maybe one that's also a psychologist, or a psychiatrist or—I don't know. Just go back to it. And cut back on this," he wagged the bottle for emphasis.
Harry’s eyes lower to the knot of pale blue silk keeping Malfoys meagre attire together at his waist and then they lower further still.
"Words beginning with
Draco shook his head; eyes squeezed shut. "Nerve pain," he said and then pursed his lips on a long exhale.
Blood runs hot down the back of Harry’s hand, and Draco’s heartbeat surrounds the digit, and he grunts and seizes—coming a river down Draco’s knuckles. He convulses and Draco shushes him, pulling until there’s nothing left but dribbles wrapping their way down his wrist.
"You're not in charge, pet. You're my good boy, and I only need for you to trust me, and I'll take such good care of you if you'll only let me."
The first was a blind item from an unnamed source at Bagman's party, basically citing without naming him that he'd left the party early and staggering. The source was quoted as saying it was a well-known fact that he brushed his teeth with Blishens whisky in the mornings. This was a half-truth—he detested Blishens—but landed close enough to home that Victoria had warned him off being seen with so much as a single drink with supper through New Year's eve. This was not going to happen, as Harry continued his habit of drinking as much as it took to pass out any night that didn't involve Draco, but it didn't stop him from being sore about having to hide it slightly better than he had been.
"I'll never hurt you, Harry," he said, and Harry kept nodding even as more tears fell. As he tried for a smile that failed him, corners of his lips pulled down. As his breath shuddered, and he didn't know why it was this gentleness that undid him, but he could feel the cracks in the dam spreading as he tried to pull away from hands that held him all the while.
"Alright?" Hermione watched him curiously. He nodded, gave a squeeze to the fingers in his grip and then let them go.
"That fucking bastard."
Draco didn't know that there wasn't a chance in hell that Harry could sleep before these visits, but he made a great fuss of pretending to; he greeted Draco in boxers and tattered band t-shirts, hair mussed and glasses missing. When he was especially impatient to get on with it, he opted for joggers, no top, and a dour scowl.
"What?" Draco whispered.
"I, er. I can't tell you that. Yet," he added, at her raised brow. "I'm waiting until I'm sure it's serious."
He laid his sweating bottle of Coke against the side of his neck and gave a little sigh of relief at the cool touch. It was all a little too pornographically nice to look at, and the combo of annoyance and horny admiration ratcheted Harry’s irritation higher. Draco was too self-satisfied for Harry's liking. If he was going to be thorough, Harry could be
"You. Fucking me."
"Right-o," Draco said. "See you soon."
"I’ve been saving it all up for you," he said on a push back in and didn’t that fucking do it for Harry. He'd meant to take it slow, make this first blowjob back a long, erotic ride, but he was equally happy to be used by Draco, and quickly.
Draco raised a brow, flipping back the tails of his jacket as he lifted up and took a seat on the stiff bed. Harry removed his jacket and sat in the visitor's chair in the corner. He undid the top button of his shirt and loosened the tie, Draco's
It was the caffeine; definitely the caffeine, he thought, even as his eyes flicked from pale grey ones to pink lips and back again. Malfoy had really excellent lips, a full bottom one that he could perfectly imagine suck—
"He's an addict," Harry spoke slowly, dimly aware of the swish of Healer Xu's scrubs as she returned from the front desk. He looked at her, noted her frown. It wasn’t good, to get her frowning. "You can't just
He turned back, brow furrowed. "You just did. Spit it out, won't you?"
right there off the top, but ignoring that, I think it's a lovely colour."
"Oh, no." Harry barely mustered the breath to speak the words. He turned to Draco and could see it—the spark of a smile, almost, almost dimpling his cheek. He turned back to the spluttering Noah and screwed up his face with as much mock concern as he could manage.
"Of course." Draco discarded his dishes to the side and crawled over to nibble at Harry's ear, a surefire way to wrack his body with shivers. "Any other thoughts clanging about in that enormous head of yours?"
"Alright." The tension that went out of Draco's shoulders belied how good that explanation made him feel, and they stayed like that, connected in this new way.
"Well, I think pink suits you, Ted. Though, have you considered yellow, like a highlighter?" Teddy scrunched up his nose, shaking his head. "Noooo, silly," he said. "You're silly, Harry. I'm allowed pink because Dwaco's allowed pink cause he's a grown-up."
"Yes, yes, Potter, it's all hilarious from where you stand, fiddling with your, your
"Yeah, well, that's a lot less surprising when everyone fucking hates your guts, now isn't it? Do you want my help or not, because this whole arguing bit isn't doing it for me."
Revelations, good and bad.
Teddy gave a knowing, "Ahhh," and sat back into his chair to spoon another portion of pudding up, thoroughly satisfied with this answer.
Draco rolled his eyes. "Yes, but—"
Something about how resigned to his fate Malfoy sounded resonated in Harry, and it must have shown in his face because the way Malfoy looked at him morphed, became shuttered again. Malfoy cleared his throat and stood, steadying himself with a hand gripping the back of his chair. Harry took this as his signal to get up too, swigging the last of the whisky in his mug and levitating it over to the sink.
"And you're doing Truth?"
Having eaten its body weight in treats, the owl stood at attention as Harry tied the parchment to its leg.
His fear was so great that at first, he didn't turn to look at Draco, though his head rested no more than a foot away. Instead, he did some panicked breathing, waiting for the acid response.
Harry felt the question as a pang in his heart, and he wanted to effusively answer that,
“I don’t know that I agreed to a new study,” he said. He liked the things—he’d said so himself, and Harry knew when he was lying. He'd deflected a bit from how much he liked them by talking about the need to shop for Teddy—linens and toys, and healthy treats, and second sets of clothes. But still, this irksome holding out of total acceptance. It rubbed like sandpaper against the soft part of him that was reaching out, waiting for an answering hand to grasp onto. All he needed was
"Take me home," the words tumbled out as Harry crashed into him, hands gripping Draco's waist. Even in the club's humid heat where each breath felt heavy with moisture, Draco's silk shirt was cool to the touch. As his now-familiar smell filled his nostrils, Harry could weep.
"I'd rather stand, thank you. It's better for my back," he added. He had a melodious voice, tinged with the lilt of West Africa, and though Harry had never met him before, his voice alone engendered trust right off the bat.
“Sweet god, Potter. Is that a maraca in your pocket? I could hear you rattling all the way down the hall.”
"Well, I—" Draco's fingers continued to play with Harry's skin, stroking the muscles of his shoulder. He spoke slowly, as though he were deciding while speaking aloud. "I don't normally bottom for anyone shorter than me, but," he hesitated, and Harry realized that he was about to be made the exception. "If you don't want to, I've been known to make allowances..."
Harry ignored him and blundered on against the alarm bells going on in the back of his mind. "I think it’s a win-win-win, as I recall someone much cleverer than me once putting it.”
"Course," Hermione said, breaking the yolk of her egg with a butter knife and then quickly pushing the plate away. Harry raised an eyebrow at her as he brought a bite of rocket and eggs to his own mouth, not-so-secretly amused at how green she'd gone all of a sudden.
Malfoy’s leg stopped at the bottom of a swing and held still.
"How do you do it?"
Another clap went up, this time with added whooping. Kreacher stood as straight as Harry had ever seen him, crooked nose held aloft. The elf had outdone himself—the
Dean Thomas approached him from across the hall, shrinking down the camera in his hands to slip into his blazer pocket. He wore a visitors badge in blue, the colour reserved for visitors on work permits. "Working on spec. Guess who I got assigned to cover?"
"Where've your Seeker's reflexes gone, Draco?" Harry teased.
Draco seemed totally unaware of the turmoil this touch generated in Harry's body as he leaned in and Merlin, but he smelled incredible. Harry could bury his face in Draco's hair and never tire of that smell. Almonds and orange oil? Did he cologne his hair in the morning, the better to intoxicate lonely men like Harry?
“I’ve never had your hair before,” Draco said. His eyes were rheumy, the delirium of fever turning them vacant.
horribly, terribly, cringe-ingly, new.
"I want to get in-between those beautiful legs of yours. I'm not going to fuck your hole, but I am going to come all over your back, and then I'll wash you clean too. Is that alright with you, pet?"
Returning to the quiet of Grimmauld would have been overwhelming without Ron there, Harry realized as soon as he shut the front door behind them.
Harry swallowed. "Slip one in and tell me how it feels," he said. He licked parched lips, wishing for all for the world for a glass of water.
It didn't work. Returning to the kitchen in a new change of clothes, neck sore as ever, Harry summoned Kreacher to beg for a bit of toast and tea.
No, not one pair of feet. Two—one in boots, the other in something cushioned. He could hear them both over the muted dance music pumped in through the speaker system. Tennis shoes. Trainers.
"Well, I'm here to apologize on his behalf, for— He said—I can't believe I'm saying this." He took a deep breath, pushing the words out quickly. "He told me that he accused you of turning Harry gay and that you'd probably been bent by Fenrir Greyback, to begin with."
"Don’t be rude," Draco swatted his shoulder, gave him room to breathe again. He replaced Harry’s glasses on his face, a finger lingering as it traced from ear to jaw, tapping his chin. "If you’re done with me, you can put everything back together the way you found it," he said with an eyebrow raised. He needed only to say the words and stand still for Harry to do the work of putting his spent cock back in his pants and zipping him back up, doing the same with his own hard-on, albeit with a wince at the sensitive skin forced back into unforgiving fabric.
"I'm broken," Harry said, tears welling up in his bottom eyelids from frustration. "There's so much in me that's wrong—"
Draco beamed, jut his jaw at the ceiling.
"How so?"
The voice said something Harry didn't care enough to hear and left as Draco leaned in to kiss Harry again, scooting closer so that they sat hip to hip, thigh to thigh. He had enough decorum to separate before the bartender returned, taking the little plastic tray and pen given to him. Harry watched him, slightly dazed that Draco was such a functional person in everyday society. Which, of course, he was. He had to be. Anything he did, he did well.
"Could you tell? I've never been to a masquerade before."
delivered with a smile and a breathy kiss, but he wasn't going to get that, so he breathed. In through the nose, out through the mouth, each tiny shift reverberating through his entire body. Every muscle in his body was strung tight, and each breath brought a new loosening as he relaxed around the intrusion, learned to accept it as needed and not a painful nuisance.
" Draco arched his back, trying for a centimetre more, "please, pet, please—"
his second favourite mugs went missing, suggesting that they'd been chosen
"Wonderful, caring, stubborn man that he is, he's refused gifts, so I had to get a little creative. I thought it would be nice to do something collectively that he fancies, so I've set this space up so that we can all watch a film together."
Draco bent his head and sighed. "I know. You know George's taunt, what he said? It wasn't so baseless. I mean, it was baseless, but—" He rolled his shoulders and sat up taller. "Jesus, I've told you this in my mind so many times, and it's so much more eloquent. I mucking this all up."
"Fuck. I’m sorry."
He swayed precipitously on the spot and grabbed hold of Harry's shoulders; the shoulders everyone else seemed all too happy to slap lately. Harry was glad that Malfoy seemed content with squeezing instead.
"As you should," she replied before frowning over at the kids, likely readying to ask them to kindly stop trying to wrestle one another from their respective seats.
Draco answered too quickly. "It's worth it if it keeps you from worrying."
Harry stopped again so suddenly that the Muggle couple trailing behind them nearly crashed into them. The man held an armful of bags from posh shops, his female companion's purchases, and as they sidestepped Harry and Draco, the man spluttered, "Fucking faggots, learn how to walk," before Harry could apologize. He stood, stunned, as they walked on, the woman's barking laugh loud in his ears.
"My birthday."
. Though Harry stared directly at him, Draco wasn't looking at Harry at all, so Harry could only see the crown of his white-blond head and the twinkle of silver at his throat, and drink in the deep huffs of his breaths as they both watched the purplish stopper of his cockhead held between Draco's legs.
"Your mouth goes on my arse," he said plainly. Harry rolled his eyes and thought of the necessary charms, enjoying Draco's surprised gasp as the magic rushed over and into his body.
, he thought, watching as the Dream Draco whispered a lube spell—his were better than Harry's, lasted longer, probably even in the dream world—which pooled in his palm. The body couldn't relax, though. It seemed to tense up just as Harry did, as he listened to the squelching sound of Draco spreading the oil on his prick, slicking the excess at the entrance to the dream body, and Harry wished it wouldn't do that.
"Yes. Whatever, Potter, just shut up and let me tell the story. I visit my mum once a week. Don't," Draco held up a finger to silence Harry, who dutifully closed his mouth around the question he was forming, "listen, it'll only take a minute."
"Okay, Harry. For future reference, you can just say
"I don't, with you," she said, bumping his shoulder and turning to look out at the assembled crowd. It was strange; Harry still got nostalgic whenever he caught a whiff of her smell, Clinique
"No?" Harry arched a brow. It was more than alright if Draco wanted to prep him instead; his tongue in Harry's—
Harry was grateful that the topic of the party didn't come up until he was tucking into rice pudding. He was so busy picking cardamom pods from Teddy's portion that he didn't hear Arthur the first time he asked about it.
was fresh enough to Teddy that he perked up at it. Pre-school was, quite literally, still all fun and games to him.
"Champagne is a girl's best friend" glowed out from a pink neon sign behind the bar, its colour reflected in the mirrored walls and floors. It was bewitched to emit tiny, sparkling bubbles that floated lazily across the room. These occasionally popped atop the heads and shoulders of patrons, releasing a faint dusting of glitter. It was airier on this floor, and Harry took a moment to breathe deeply.
"Mum, are you actually being serious? How many weddings are you and Dad planning to pay for?"
Harry nodded, ate the bacon, forcing normalcy. Draco stole an orange slice, and Harry wanted to ask if that was breakfast, but that wasn't how this conversation was supposed to go.
"Don't you dare start with me—you
Harry heaved a sigh of relief. “Okay.”
“S’okay,” Harry bit his lip to keep further sounds from coming out. He really must be getting soft, if pain like this could make his eyes water. Truth be told, he hadn’t suffered a grave injury in a long time—almost as though it wasn’t normal to nearly die once a season.
"And you two call yourself friends," Ron broke the silence with a huff, "keeping stories like these to yourselves. Well, let me tell you, next time something really juicy happens, I'm going to keep it to myself." He pointed at Hermione, swung around the point at Harry, donning his most serious look. "For years. Give you a taste of your own medicine, I will."
tired of squares of dark chocolate."
"Noted. I'll be sure to bring you for dinner at the Shard."
Draco huffed. "You can’t possibly understand how annoying you are," he said.
"You use a mailing service, so this way will cut down on the chances of a third-party noticing something amiss. Using notes, and the Floo, when we have to," Draco elaborated.
"I wasn't thinking straight," Draco starting speaking again suddenly. "What didn't seem likely was that you wanted only me. I always thought I was a phase, deep down. People like me for a while, and then they tire of me, and it was hard to believe that this time things were different." He took another bracing sip of tea, which did nothing to soothe his rough voice. "I've been the dirty secret more times than I can count, Harry. I thought I'd invented us, you know? It was like we were living a fantasy, the stupid fantasy of a stupid boy, and I know it sounds crazy, but I didn't want to believe that what we had was real. To be honest, I'm still not sure."
Harry sighed, swiping his wand hand in its direction to levitate it under the armoire.
? What are you on these days?" Harry asked. Draco went back to playing with his face.
At that moment, enraptured in the timbre of Draco's voice, Harry felt something at his shoulder. He went to swat at it as Draco's hand darted out and caught his.
"I don't know half the standards, but I like the oldies. Wizard and Muggle," Harry said with a shrug. The bubbles of discomfort had passed, and now there was uneasiness in their place. Harry pushed peas around his plate with his fork, and when he looked up, he was astonished to see Draco ladling another portion onto his own.
"I dare you to kiss," he tapped his chin thoughtfully, leaned in. Harry was poised, heart pounding in his throat, slightly terrified to lock lips before an audience but also very, very willing to do so because he never didn't want to kiss Draco.
"Charlie said he's available, by the way. If you, you know. Need a chat."
Draco flicked his shoulder. "You can't be telling me that Muggles flick through all the films at random, in a circle, forever? It's so disorganized. Hasn't anyone explained a schedule to them?"
He barely remembered it all but knew that it was fun, that slip of time between coming to terms with his sexuality and rightly freaking out about how and when he was supposed to say, "I'm gay!" to the world at large.
Harry returned his barb with an eye-roll that might cost him his life. Something about the red glow of the lit cigarette was familiar, but he couldn't place it. It didn't surprise him that Malfoy smoked, somehow. He couldn't concentrate on these thoughts and instead used his newly found wand to transfigure the extra pillow into a glass and filled it with life-saving water with a muttered
"You don't think that was a little much, considering that ten minutes ago you were afraid that we were being followed by reporters?" Draco pulled on the cigarette and raised his brows but not his voice. He didn't seem particularly angry. Annoyed, perhaps.
Malfoy stared at him. It was not unlike the feeling of being watched by a cat, unblinking. Or a dragon, now that Harry thought about it. Definitely reptilian. If Harry thought he felt naked before, it was nothing compared to this feeling of being seen
He pretended it was because Draco looked better than he had in years. The short hair made him look younger, closer to his actual age. Thin, but no longer emaciated to the point that Harry scanned the obits for the
"You get all dressed up like you've somewhere important to be," Malfoy kept talking animatedly, utterly unaware of Harry internally falling apart. "Find a Muggle part of town with a gymnasium, though Hyde Park is actually quite nice in the mornings, anywhere will do. You Apparate there, change into the joggers that nobody knows you own—"
"Harry!"
They didn't say anything for a long while as Draco focused his attention on the man below him rather than the one in the mirror. As he knelt, held Harry's legs together, gliding his cock so it passed slowly over his hole each time before sliding through his thighs, rubbing his bollocks on the other side.
, Harry thought, Malfoy’s voice a permanent fixture in his mind after years spent in close quarters together. Malfoy squinted at him with his left eye because the right one didn’t seem to want to be open any longer. Odd, all of it.
"Bacon sarnie," Kreacher implored, pushing the plate closer to Harry's elbow, frowning as Harry sat with the magazine spread between his hands. "The Master's favourite."
"Against my best efforts, I've come to care for you, pet. Quite a bit, in fact."
“I am.”
"What do we talk about, though?" Draco asked through gritted teeth.
"And how is it that I am?" Harry asked, a flare of interest travelling directly to his cock.
"Ew, what? No! He's neither very young nor very old—"
, Malfoy, you're twenty-three," Harry ground out. Malfoy waved a hand.
Next was the sitting room, filled with the scraggly sunlight of an overcast day. A dark purple plant in a low pot pulsed with a soft, ominous light, throwing shadows around the simple furniture. Curiously, a television's blank screen acted as a mirror, reflecting Harry's serious face back at him. Harry backed out of the room and shut the door behind him—one wasn't friends with Neville Longbottom for as long as he'd been without developing healthy respect and fear of magical plants one didn't know the names of. That, and he didn't want to know how, or why, Draco Malfoy had a television. Whatever the reason, it couldn't be good.
The sneer was back, even as his chest rose and fell faster, harder.
Dawn to dusk to dawn again.
Pansy stared ahead at the painted number six. He was glad she didn't want to face him down; her aura alone made him ansty.
, and Draco took it that way, covering him with a sheet, going so far as to tuck it in around him before he got up and left. Harry wasn't asleep but felt like he awoke when Draco returned and sat at the edge of the bed, waiting for him to prop up, helping bring his own mug to his lips.
Harry paid no mind to the pandemonium erupting around him. Malfoy’s breathing rabbited, quick and shallow. His eyes opened to reveal a shock of black, pupils dilated even as he squinted to make Harry out not an arm's length above him.
"Draco," Harry said, a warm feeling spreading in him as the object of his affection kicked insolently at the pavement, marking up the thin layer of sodden snow that had fallen while they were inside.
"Okay," Harry agreed. "Deal. To...whatever this is."
Harry’d heard death rattles before, but none so good as this. Never accompanied by wet trails from eyes that held his. Malfoy’s scratching gentled and his wheezing could only barely pass the swollen glands of his throat, the bloated lash of his tongue finishing the job nicely.
Board meetings, presentations, lunches with bureaucrats, incessant requests from Robards on behalf of the Auror division, interviews with reporters, staying on top of the publisher's needs. His pet project—the only one he actually cared about—was "the home for lonely waifs," as Victoria liked to put it. The project was due to break ground in the spring, and it took a lot more glad-handing than he'd expected to get all the right people on board. Even with vaults near-to-overflowing, even with most of the money put up by him, money he didn't want or need from endorsements, from visiting fees, from showing face at events—it was more work than he'd expected. By the time Draco came over most nights, Harry's eyes were dry from reading, and his body ached from the way he threw it into training, pushing it during any spare minute. When he was exhausted, his mind was at its quietest, and he liked it that way. It was that or drinking, and he wouldn't let himself be drunk with Draco, or rather, he didn't want to be. When he lost that battle, he'd burn the alcohol off from his blood with a spell shortly before Draco exited the fireplace, swallowing the want to shout from how it set his nerves aflame. The windows cracked and popped in their frames whenever Harry did this, as though it upset the house, and Kreacher would avoid him for hours on end. Whether this was out of pity or annoyance, Harry didn't bother asking.
"I mean, well—first I was a freak because of my parents, and then my magic, and then for being a
Harry had to think about it. "A little," he said. "I haven't said it to some of the people that matter yet, though, to their faces. Or, you know. Held someone's hand in public." Harry looked to his own rough hands, hands he couldn't trust not to inflict pain. Over to Draco's, trembling gone now, covered as they always were in public. Protected from a painful world.
"I knew that. But what I didn't know was why you'd be over here, in the car park. Wouldn't it be easier to catch him if you were Disillusioned down on the street, like a regular stalker?"
"Did you read it?" He directed the question to his shoes, staring at his hands to keep from staring at Draco. The item in question was the interview—they both knew that. Harry knew Draco, knew that it would only be through an astronomical feat of spite that he would be able to avoid reading not just the interview itself, but every associated opinion piece about it.
Harry hadn't anything to say to that. His face got caught somewhere between a smile and a grimace.
Harry squeezed his eyes shut. "I care about him."
"Jesus, Mary, and bloody, fucking, ever-loving Joseph," Draco said, resting one hand across the pool of glistening come on his abs, the other letting go of Harry and curling around the top edge of the partition wall. He heaved breaths, looking at Harry like he was god's gift to hand jobs.
"But still, I'm a monster when I'm depressed, Harry. I'm mean and careless, and I couldn't—I can't
“Do you trust me?”
"I think I'm—" he said, dozy, leaving the sentence unfinished.
"Potter, my good man, honestly? Honestly? The best, happiest we've seen him in years has been during this whole clandestine tryst he started up with you. You've got to understand that you're not what makes him better, or what makes him worse, but that he clearly has an easier go of—I dunno,
Malfoy didn't say anything, just stared at him.
"Since when did you start smoking?" Ron asked. Harry took another pull and expelled it.
Persephone wasn't packed for a Friday night, per se, but there was a healthy queue at the bar, and the last of the comfortable seats were taken on the patio. Harry knew that the tide was turning, and the press of too many crowded bodies in one space would become too much for his tastes within the hour.
"Shit, I didn't realize this was...serious," Ron said from his seat.
"I might not be a seasoned club-kid, but I'm not that new," Harry said.
"To keep them in my life, even tangentially." Draco’s voice took on a cracked quality Harry had rarely heard from him. He realized that while he'd seen Draco upset, seen him collapse under an anxiety attack that couldn't be kept at bay, he hadn't seen him open up this way before. Purposeful vulnerability didn't come naturally to him.
"If Dwaco comes to dinner, can he sit next to me?"
"Actually,
But by the way he worried his lip, and how he couldn’t hold Harry’s eyes for more than a second—Harry could see that this plan full of sub-headers was already a loosening of Draco's code of conduct, and a stressful one at that. And it dawned on him that the things Harry and others did without thought, Draco couldn't. Nothing about this, for him, was easy.
"Fuck, pet, I missed you," Draco gasped as Harry swallowed his cock, and the words soothed him so much that he moaned with relief. "I missed you so much."
Bill met his eye and didn't waver.
Harry took a measured gulp of his drink, sweat building at the nape of his neck. What was he supposed to say?
"Well, it's the truth, and if you knew anything at all about me since we left school, you wouldn't be so surprised." Malfoy's pointed chin jut higher as he said this. If he had feathers, they'd be standing on end.
Hunger roused Harry from dreams of harried Ministry employees in high-heels tap-dancing to Celestina Warbeck standards. He was about to join a chorus singing before the Wizengamot and was saved the trouble when his stomach, shrunken to the size of a prune, woke him with an epic growl.
Harry found himself more relaxed in meetings with the Hogwarts Board of Governors or the Wizengamot Oversight Committee. His worries were about the cost of bricks and what to have for tea, and whether he'd have enough time to pop to the shops to grab the gingerale Draco liked before Weasley family dinner. He was still always the youngest person in the room, but when he spoke to people in the education field about what it was like to run a home or boarding school, they all told him the same thing—it was incredibly difficult with no let-up, but also the most rewarding work he’d ever know. He had McGonnagal on-side as a trustee, and kept busy hiring the best staff money could buy to ensure that his
include?
he said and stopped short until the rising tide of pain subsided. He rarely even spoke their names aloud.
Smut that's fluffy, fluff that's angsty, and of course, there are presents.
Draco dipped his head so that his face was covered by a sheet of hair. "Quite." He looked back at Harry warmly and with far too much kindness. "The point is that I took that with me and held onto it, and I let it hurt me for a long time."
Harry snorted into his glass. “Youths? What were you, eighteen?”
He bent over with a deep exhale, turning his face to the head of the bed, his vision nothing but pillows, and pulled his arms in, bent tightly to his sides. Draco stood behind him, a socked toe pushing one of Harry's knees outwards.
"That's nice, keep doing that," he said softly. His feet belonged to someone who worked with them—callused, his long toes bunched up into a slight curl. They felt nice, though, the soles oddly smooth in Harry’s hands.
"Look at me, Potter." Harry did, shame burning his cheeks.
Draco came buckets; it was absurd, and it was so fucking hot, each spurt punctuated by a small, heated sigh from Draco. Harry knew he would never forget it, would hear him in his wet dreams. The spurts gradually reduced in power as Harry slowed his frenzied pulling, hand slippery and coated in warm, milky come. Harry's body trembled as he pressed against Draco, and it was a miracle that he forced himself to go still, stepping away as he loosed his grip.
" to patrons who bestowed him additional bills to add to the fedora Alex gave him to collect the assorted cash in. Following his act, Alex was swept off for a chat with a burly man in leather chaps, and just like that Draco made his excuses to pull Harry away and lead him around the club, occasionally hooking a finger under the choker and tugging him in close.
The tell-tale dimple was there, though. The bugger was trying to contain a smile.
"Works for me. Lead the way; I never got the hang of this floor."
"I didn't tell you to dress me. I said that if you wanted me to
"We're all inside, ready when you are," Arthur called to Harry.
“Ice chips for tea, your highness.”
"I'll tell you later," Draco said before letting out a growl of annoyance. "I can't believe I let her corner me into anything, and now two weddings in one year. Two!"
"It's alright," Draco offered the hint of a smile, "I don't mind."
out of him?
"Alright," Draco said.
"There's a strong chance in my opinion that
"I think we can be good for each other," Harry said, and he meant it. His throat scratched, and he let the emotion colour his words. "I want to be good for you. And you make me better, Draco. No one has ever made me feel the way you do." He extended his fingers, waiting, and all at once the urge to make that final move welled up in him, spilt over, like it was steam held under pressure for so long and this night had opened the seam that would let the feeling spring up and out.
,” Harry whispered, killing all light in the flat. The bit that crept in under the front door gilded the edges of things in grey. It wasn’t enough for detail, but he knew the dimensions of their quarters by heart. Sitting in the empty space of the comma made by Malfoy’s curved torso, he tugged his hand away and spread the folded cloth across his brow and eyes.
Draco's jeans stretched tightly over his thighs, his body radiating heat even through the material to Harry’s hips, trapped between them. Harry threw his head back and closed his eyes, lost to all the things Draco's mouth could do to him and was surprised when three of Draco's fingers were at his bottom lip.
Harry swallowed thickly. He turned to look at Draco and found him staring, a little frown rippling his forehead.
"Let it be known that I kind of hate this, you two betting on my love life all the time. I feel like George's predilection for befriending bookies is turning you two into problem gamblers."
She nodded and Harry gave her an even look, gliding his middle and ring fingers over from where they'd been holding elastic back and towards Cissy's hole, the skin all strangely smooth, hairless, and her hole now slippery wet, full with her own middle finger.
Greg, with Very White Teeth, nodded, taking the lie at face value.
to become
He returned minutes later, tidied up, and the two of them sat cross-legged, moaning around the melting tabs of various confections on their tongues, the crinkling sound of the wrappers the only addition to the soundtrack. A thought came to Harry as the last bar was finished, and he rubbed Draco's shin.
"Does it feel like a hangover?" he asked.
"Um, not necessarily anywhere anyone at this table would know. I went to a Muggle school—Imperial College, in London."
"Eyes front, both of you!" Draco snapped. Harry was surprised that his tone got them to settle down.
Draco nodded, eyes wide like this wasn't news at all.
Harry took the glass of something from him and necked it.
Harry barked a laugh, surprising himself.
“You need to trust that I’ve got your back or this will never work.”Malfoy—he was still Malfoy, then—more serious at twenty than he’d be at thirty.
It was due to the added
"I'll be visiting my sister this year, as we've come to terms on a few...matters, and she wants to reconcile."
Draco would wear, and he ended up tossing off in the shower—too fast, coming hard as he moaned out Draco's name, two fingers slicked and pressed up inside him, not so hard when they were his own—and it was after that that he finally gave in and sent a call through the enchanted coin for a meeting early the next morning. It was a horny and, frankly, desperate move.
This time his shoes weren't so lucky.
"Come off it, Potter. I'm me; you're you. We couldn’t—"
"Why not Healers instead? I mean, it could be useful to talk to someone who knows you're a wizard."
fucking great. I haven't visited Hogsmeade as myself in years. I brought back your laptop, by the way," he gestured at the messenger bag between them. "It's a tragedy when Costa Coffee has better internet than you do. You should have the house re-wired."
"How's your birthday treating you, Harry," the shop owner asked him. She flicked her wand to the door, and the lock clicked as a "Back in 10" sign clacked into place against the glass.
"How long has it been since you've had ninety days?"
“If anyone asks if you’re collared,” he whispered, “the answer is that you’re mine.”
“I’m okay,” Draco whispered. Harry squeezed tighter to keep him from slipping his grip.
And damn, what a sight he was. Harry watched as he shucked a standard black travelling robe to hang at the entrance, revealing tight black jeans, low riding boots, perfectly shined, and a muted Tattersall jumper of greys and browns. It was his thing, Harry supposed, to ride the line between wizard and Muggle fashion, looking every bit the Muggle as soon as his outer robes came off, and it did something to Harry to see his willowy frame in tight clothing. Robes hardly did anything for a person's figure.
"Good. You can go now. I'll be along."
"You call her mum," Harry observed.
Draco frowned, breathing heavily. "Don't," he warned, but Harry was too gone. Harry met his eyes as his tongue snaked out for a testing lick of the blackened skin there.
"You're right," he said, eyeing the empty spot on the banquette next to Harry and moving over to occupy it, long legs outstretched under the table. "So we can hear each other better," he said by way of explanation for the move.
It also happened to be the day he'd died, and very quietly, without anyone noticing, been resurrected.
to see his partner undone with want, for once, rather than it being him.
"Did you play Harry Potter or Voldemort?" Harry asked. Draco made a pleased sound behind him.
happy to do it. Maybe it'll soften up Molly, my chipping in towards the next generation."
“I’m only just getting started,” he said. “I don’t know about you, but I haven’t got anywhere else to be.”
"I'm sorry," he choked out at last, hands covering his ears, as though Harry were yelling at him, "I'm so fucking sorry. I, I, I—"
"Nothing," he said. "It’s getting late. See you soon, pet." Harry watched, confused and strangely hurt as he walked out the door without a backwards glance. In this way, whatever was happening between them was complicated. They still found ways to break one another, but it was like playing that game
“Or is it the entire shin?” Harry stood and with the practise of a person who’d done this a thousand times, Malfoy took his movement as a sign to unlatch the button at his waistcoat and slide back, rumpling the exam table paper.
"That's what I want, just something
“You’re not supposed to use the journal like that,” he elaborated after both their breathing slowed and melded into one tempo. Draco’s heartbeat was steady and slow; Harry could fall asleep to it anytime, and he was close to it when Draco added, “It’s supposed to be about you.”
Malfoy sipped his coffee. "And?" he said. Harry sat up a little higher, leaning back against the padded headboard. He tried not to notice Malfoy's almond-shaped eyes darting low again, no doubt to the scars the public didn't know about.
Harry couldn't find words, so he mulled over Draco's as he smoked his cigarette.
"—love mushy peas, yes, I know."
"We went to Persephone on Friday, and Luna recognized the bloke he was with."
wasn’t so strong; it didn’t leave so much as the scent of Draco’s sweat on his skin. He watched absently as Draco leaned over the edge of the bed and fumbled around, taking the time to memorize the curve of his arse, where the cheeks grew fuzzy blonde like a peach.
"Mmph," Harry made an agreeing sound into his armpit, finding himself lying on the floor again. He forced another sip of tincture down his throat and finally felt the will to sit up straight, brushing dust from his skin.
Draco cleared his throat, keeping his head down. “He used to stick entirely to hexes. So much more civilized. Even he’s caught the Muggle fever, it seems."
, Harry. I'm not interested in them anymore." Ron bit his lip, weighing his next words. "What’s happened to you? All this? It’s not fair, and not your fault. You didn't deserve any of this shit. But you know what else isn't fair? It's not fair to us, you know. You doing this. We know what you do when you lock yourself away."
?" Harry asked.
hate him in that—it's my fucking dress, and I stopped fitting in it before I even met this whore."
"Oh, it's no trouble at all when the trip is worth it. Ready?" His eyes were the colour of bubble-gum ice cream—a searing, artificial blue. Harry noticed because they seemed determined to hold his gaze for longer than was necessary.
"Oi!" Draco shouted as he stalked across the street, the objects of his ire two boys, barely at puberty, sniggering and jostling each other into the alleyway.
His breathing slowed, gradually, and as a final test, he summoned the weekend duffle bag he'd packed. Commercially produced vials of Dreamless Sleep tinkled against one another—he’d been taking full doses, lately, to combat the torrent of Draco-related nightmares, couldn’t risk waking the entire Weasley clan with his terrors—but he ignored those as he rummaged through it, pulling out the brown paper bag he'd refused to open early.
Ludo Bagman threw the event every year, always within the weeks following the Hogwarts Express’ departure. Therefore, it was perfectly timed, as the parents and guardians left behind were especially inclined to celebrate their newfound freedom from school-aged children.
"Yeah," he nodded, "that'd be great. I'd really like that."
"I agree, but I think the lad is looking a bit of alright now, Molly."
"Draco," Harry said, sick of staring at the back of his head. Annoyance bristled his skin like a scratchy fabric—he'd burn a hole into his scalp through sheer force of will if he wasn't careful. "Turn and look at me when you're talking to me. Please."
Harry swatted at him, tossed the letter aside. "Could you not?"
“Oh. Okay."
"All better," Harry said. They were far too close and breathing deeply from the exertion of the spell. He could smell Draco so keenly—sweet, fragrant oils reminiscent of hot summer days spent in orchards, earthy tobacco, and under that his smell—clean, masculine.
He may as well find out if Malfoy was worth being pleasant to, next he saw him. If he saw him.
Harry looked up and found Malfoy expectantly watching him for just a moment before he schooled his features into his trademark smirk. If Harry didn't know better, he would have said his first look was one of hope, like he was eager to please Harry with this reveal.
He came-to at the bar, both Draco and the bartender looking at him expectantly.
, they said. Harry knew just how Draco felt because it was a look he'd given his friends a thousand times.
"Fancy a drink?"
"And? Is this going somewhere?"
Harry pulled his hood down and crossed the room in a few steps, offering a hand to her, which she took and squeezed. He didn't like being touched as a rule, but Fatima felt like a friend to him, a face that took none of his bullshit and kept all his secrets. He hesitated before answering, watched her smile flicker. She looked worried about him, he had to guess. He managed a small smile, enough to placate her at least.
"Who's that?" he asked. He hoped it sounded like he didn't care—polite rather than digging. A tiny alarm bell was going off in his mind.
"Sharing secrets out here, I see," he said. Harry rolled his eyes and dropped the spell. Ron gestured into the dining room.
still didn’t come to mind at all.
He rose to leave, fingertips emerging from a shirtsleeve to point at the room's far corner. "Floo's there in the corner. I've got to be going."
up all the way to the alley. So, we can keep talking to one another."
"Fuck," Draco said, frowning. "You weren't supposed to see that."
She trailed off, not sure how to finish the question. The table quietened again, and this time Draco answered while keeping his gaze firmly planted on the plate before him, where he'd cut his roast into so many bite-sized pieces, though was yet to touch any of them.
"So."
"Harry? Harry?"
The girl with hazel eyes gave a tiny wave, and his grin came easily. He peeled himself off the floor with minimal wincing and followed the nurse out.
Would hurt him, one way or another, in the long run.
"What about your name?"
"Which was..."
"Are you alright?" Draco removed his sunglasses and looked at him as he applied Chapstick, the furrow of concern between his brows. When Harry didn't respond, he shook his wrist to reveal his wristwatch and looked to the corners of the park.
"He's handling them this Friday."
When Harry spoke again, it was with calm in his voice. After this, after all, there'd be scones. No one was going anywhere, not anymore. There would be no stampeding away from one another, of this, he felt sure as bedrock.
He let his right hand go from around Cissy's shaft and placed it over her gloved hand, knotted tightly in his hair. Looking up, he got to witness Cissy’s eyes widen as he concentrated on opening his throat the best he could and forced himself that inch lower, spluttering without pulling free, eyelids wincing shut as he did it, and back off again.
Harry crossed his arms, playfully annoyed. Malfoy was still richer than the dirt Gringotts was built on, whether he was speaking to his father or not. Harry was confident that Narcissa Malfoy wouldn't keep anything from her son, whether he had carte blanche access to the family lines of credit or not. But he was clearly intent on doing things his way these days, sticking to the part of the reformed student, newly on his own, pretending his way through being independently wealthy and not a leach of the state like Harry. Frankly, Harry was intent on playing along if it meant their fragile truce could stand.
"M'sorry," he slurred the words together, smacking his lips together to try again. "I'm sorry.
Ron cleared the table and firecalled work, gently explaining to Harry what he already knew; that he'd have to go in and make an official report in the morning; that he should avoid all contact with Victoria and Tom until the details were cleared. Harry bit the inside of his lip, nodding, practicing his breathing. In, out. In, out.
"What do you mean?"
"Could you do the splits when we were in school?" Harry fiddled with the corner of a pillowcase, though Draco saw directly through him.
Malfoy's forehead smoothed as he leaned back, arms crossed loosely and legs widening ever so slightly. The pose telegraphed unearned confidence, was precisely the kind of cocky posturing that made Harry want to slap him and at the same time, sort of, sink down to his knees and suck his cock. Well, maybe not his cock, but the genre of men like Malfoy's cocks. The preening plonkers who thought they owned the world and took so naturally to taking what they thought they were owed from Harry, and oh, wasn't that fucking telling.
"It was what I needed then, more than wheedling on about my parents—"
"What?" They stepped from the elevator; Draco apparently unaffected by the trip taking them up and sideways, his hands departing from Harry's lapels as soon as the doors opened. They were conspicuously overdressed for the halls of St Mungos, and they caught a lot of glances and generated many genuine smiles. The two of them in tuxes and tails, Harry's black hair coiffed, slick as oil, and Draco's high and tight, the sides and back shaved down and only the top left long, slicked back all the same—they would draw looks no matter the place or time.
"Well. Anyway. That's why I'm wearing these. It wouldn't do to show up to Bagman's looking a mess."
Harry got up, swallowing his annoyance. He grabbed a handful of limes to set to slicing them up, summoned a glass pitcher from the cabinet on the wall, and eyed the bottles of gin, soda, syrups and bitters on the shelves.
," Ron repeated. "It's
"And it went...well?" Draco asked, dubious, and Harry snuck in to suck his bottom lip into his mouth to kiss him again, one hand wrapped around the back of his head, holding him there, the other pressed to the ridged bone where his ribs met in the middle, the spot that he sometimes drummed his fingers on at night before they slept, amazed that Draco could make a sound so hollow when Harry knew him to be so full of life. Harry tapped the spot and felt the dull thud, vowed that they would build something on the scaffolding of Draco's body, soft swaddling to protect him so that the thud would be dulled to something Harry could stand to hear.
Whatever the reason, Harry couldn't escape that Draco was smart—
He paused, but Draco didn’t look up. It was as though he knew scrutiny of any kind would be too much. Harry always did his best talking into dark rooms, or quickly, with his eyes squeezed shut.
"That's not right. You work too hard, Harry. Everyone deserves a break now and again," Justin nudged at Harry's shoulder. He hated it when people did that, touched him without asking, but he shrugged it off.
to drink from using a straw to his left.
"Grandma says I'm too little," he groused. Harry pulled a face at Andromeda over his head, mouthing the word
Harry felt so much more exposed without the haze of alcohol, like the fire in his belly was visible. But the desire hadn't changed at all.
"You’re half-Black; I’m not sure how much worse the inbreeding could get." A muscle in Draco’s jaw trembled. Harry pressed on.
"I guess that’s my signal to be off, then."
"He's done this over your scars?"
him being careful, that to not have been careful would have been to knock them both to the ground and hope that they lost teeth in the fall, but he didn't have the time to say any of that.
"I could finger fuck you forever," Harry whispered. Draco smiled, biting his bottom lip.
"What studio?"
"I can explain," Harry reached out for his hand, and this time Draco didn't flinch. He traced his thumb down the back of his knuckles, purpled from poor circulation and rough from work, and gods but Harry wanted to twine their fingers together and draw him closer. When he looked up, it was directly into the stormy eyes he'd come to know so well, swimming and tight with pain. He took a step closer, dared to place a careful hand at his shoulder, sliding it up to caress his neck.
They kissed in the loos and when he, Oliver, when he reached for Harry's fly, Harry pushed his hands away, because the feeling was off. But he didn't want to disappoint, asked if he had a flat they could go to instead and Oliver had given him a cheeky yes and brought him back to the place he shared with two other men, themselves no more than boys, both of whom eyed Harry hungrily, eyes heavily lidded from the joint they were sharing over a plate of nachos in their tiny kitchen.
"Of course, Victoria," he said. He zoned back out as she rattled off a dozen other topics to touch on during the interview. The mention of Hogwarts brought him out of his reverie.
