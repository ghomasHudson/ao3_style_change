“Don’t you dare, Potter. I’m not done with you yet.”
It didn’t look as if Draco believed him; he also seemed to find the concept rather amusing, what with the hiccup of laughter. “Sorry, that’s very hard to picture.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“I must be catching a second wind. I feel too tired to be tired anymore.”
“Sounds barmy,” Ron decided.
“Oh god.” Harry shuddered under a wave of nerves and desire.
Malfoy was already there of course.
“Er. You’re welcome?” Harry offered. “Not like it wasn’t a proper fucking for me too.”
Harry wasn’t sure if one or both of them had done it, they might’ve broken the door, but he didn’t care to stop long enough to sort it out. Draco’s feet hit the floor and Harry backed him to the edge of the bed.
“I’d thought about bringing the whole thing to you, of course, but I know you’ve both been very busy—”
Scrawling out a quick note on a small scroll of parchment, he sent it off late morning with Ginny’s owl—though he’d had to ply her with treats to do it. He was pretty sure she was annoyed at him for sending her back and forth to Wiltshire so often lately, but the treats were effective.
“For the hand—? Or had you meant for my mouth,” Malfoy taunted, effectively, as Harry went rosy all over again.
Draco glared fiercely, his every word cutting in sharp furious syllables, as if it hurt him to say them aloud. “Don’t be fucking
“Perhaps cinnamon?” He seemed uncertain about his conclusion.
Whispering a spell to relax him, one more to cover his eager cock in slickness, and Harry’s groan went growled shoving into him hard in three determined thrusts. Draco cried out a little at each, squirming against the mirror as Harry pushed flush to his arse, this particular position providing a near perfect angle for fucking right into his sweet spot.
Harry groaned, stumbling back a few steps until his back hit the side of the little glass shed he was using as a greenhouse—but he gripped at Draco’s arse, pulling him along, keeping him pressed right where he was. It
“You’re alright with me being…in you, like this?” Harry murmured.
“Essentially,” Draco drawled wryly. “If we manage to finish them before midnight, I might even crack open the good firewhisky.”
“Let’s go then. The night waits for no wizard.”
When he rubbed a bit harder, his fingertip popped past the tight ring. Draco wouldn’t stop kissing him long enough to let him whisper a lubrication charm, so Harry was very careful nudging his touch a little deeper, searching for a sweeter spot as narrow hips writhed down ever more frenetically on him.
Draco shivered, letting slip a very soft groan, and Harry was pretty sure he was about to get what he wanted.
“Well I didn’t know you were going to insist on a formal fucking restaurant, did I?”
Smirking, Draco caught at his hair, pulling his lips down to ravish thoroughly, rocking up to meet his rhythm when Harry's hips sped. Every kiss hurt, but as raw as his lips were he let Draco kiss them anyway, in exchange for all the throaty cursing he breathed over them.
“Yesterday—what did you come over for?”
He had to slide his tip around some to find it—and when he did, he thrust in hard, pushing past pliant muscle to sink himself in about half-way. He could feel the heat radiating off Draco’s body entangled with his, the press of tensing thighs on his arms as he sunk in deeper.
easy—the particularly perfect way their legs tangled, and the decidedly mind-blowing explosion of sensations when Malfoy arched up against him, wriggling and pressing until Harry was afraid to move for fear of actually moaning.
“Go first then. Prove it’s not actually poison and maybe I’ll think about it.”
The guilt usually would not hit him until he was home with Ginny, standing in the kitchen, or the sitting room, or flipping through books in the attic, when the thoughts, the memories, and all the urges would return to him.
“I will,” Harry agreed easily. “Have a good evening, Draco.”
The question posed itself to him again: what exactly was wrong with him?
Harry found himself at four in the morning in his kitchen mixing cinnamon into a mug of hot chocolate.
Wiping down an empty one toward the centre of the room, Sally waved at them as they passed through, insisting that they visit again soon.
Perhaps taking potions from Malfoy had been a poor choice on Harry’s part.
They sipped quietly, refusing to make eye contact in their uneasy silence for several minutes.
—” he sighed as Draco moaned beneath him.
“Thanks so much,” he snarked.
else? Aren’t we meant to be talking about your problems?”
Harry thanked her for the information, and thanked her again for her discretion in not telling anyone she had seen him before he made his way back out into the city again.
Harry’d meant it just to tease him more—only now that he’d said it aloud, it was kind of a compelling idea.
“Fine then, be a stubborn prat about it.”
“Er, I asked you to come…you’ve never minded that before.”
Draco had arrived in a perfectly fitted suit, with no tie or jacket. He came across shockingly professional, and somehow attractively casual all at once, resembling more a young banker, than a young Wizard.
The look Draco shot him then, the faint arching of an eyebrow as he merely leant back on the desk, spoke volumes. The fact he was still completely naked only added to the air of confidence.
“Salutations, Ginevra.” Malfoy couldn’t have sounded any less enthusiastic if he’d tried, but it was civil at any rate.
Blaise was still standing shocked on the bedroom side with a towel—and that look someone had a tendency to take on when incredibly juicy gossip landed in their lap.
Merlin but he was fucked, in the worst way.
“We can’t lose very much time; we don’t have—”
They were both moaning profusely when Harry bottomed out in his arse, rocking him forward on the bed—as though he could possibly get any deeper. Draco pushed back, tensing purposefully.
Without his glasses, Draco was fuzzily outlined in a dim halo of light emanating from the ballroom’s chandeliers, spilling in through the un-curtained bedroom window. It was remarkably enchanting, even if Harry was struggling to interpret a rather enigmatic smirk.
“Thanks.”
“Isn’t it Dark Magic?” Harry asked worriedly.
“What’s the matter,
“How long?”
“All in one piece?”
Harry’s crooked smirk went a bit self-satisfied, but he was much gentler pushing in. He held Draco’s gaze through every inch, if only to be sure he was truly alright. When he was in fully balls-deep he whispered an extra lubrication charm, and soon he was dragging slowly in and out of the tight hold of Draco’s arse as they both moaned in voices wrecked from a lot more moaning, and a bit of cock sucking too.
“Breathe, Potter,” Malfoy muttered offhandedly, and Harry let out a sharp breath he hadn’t even been aware he was holding.
Malfoy trailed off to eye Aberforth preparing his drink down the bar.
Draco scowled. “Give me the fucking coffee, Potter. Let’s get out of the fucking rain.”
“Do I
“So I’ve heard.”
“None of those points are as reassuring as you think they are.”
Draco didn’t need to know what he was saying to come over his hand and all over his shirt with a very deep moan.
“Harry? Please wake up, I’ve been looking for you everywhere! It’s so late, I’ve got a match tomorrow afternoon; we should really Floo home.”
Malfoy seemed to realise he may have overreacted. As he sipped irritably at his absinthe, Harry thought he could safely take a moment to consider him a little more closely, but Malfoy caught him looking almost immediately—and somehow, with only the deliberate arch of one pale eyebrow, Harry felt suddenly very flushed.
Seamus, too, seemed interested. He must automatically assume someone meant Dean, Harry mused. So, unsurprisingly, Seamus asked: “Well, then: Never have I ever fancied someone who was in a relationship with someone from the opposite sex of yours”. He was too drunk for proper grammar and was apparently trying to find out if a girl had a thing for Dean. To that, Dean shifted in his seat uncomfortably, but relaxed as soon as he saw that only two people drank: Luna and Draco. Draco. Again? Before he could ponder about what this could mean, Harry was nudged in the side. It was his turn.
Now there was music playing in the kitchen, joined by sporadic laughter that was only muffled when it reached Harry's ears. Deciding that he wanted to see whether he was missing out on something happening in the kitchen, he pulled the next best hoodie he found in a pile of clothes over his head and almost kicked one of his houseplants that was adjacent to the mattress he was calling his bed. Ron and Hermione had come up with the idea to get Harry a few plants to look after, obviously either guilty about moving in together or under the influence of one of Neville's inebriated, infamous plant talks.
Harry never finished his sentence because Draco's lips were pressing against his and his lips now had other things to do than talking. The kiss was careful at first and Draco's lips were just as soft as he'd imagined them to be, hell, even softer and when he started tugging at Harry's messy hair, Harry didn't see why they should be careful any longer and turned their kiss into a more determined one. It was messy and Harry was pretty sure he could feel a tear mixing up with their saliva. Their lips moved in unison, making Harry forget everything he ever thought he knew about kissing before. He could feel Draco's hand fumbling with the string of Harry's hoodie and in response he brought a hand to Draco's hair and almost melted when he felt the softness of it. He knew that Draco took great pride in his hair and feared that he might not like it when Harry made it messy, but the moan the blonde let out assured him that that was not the case at all.
“Isn’t that kinda lame?”, Dean asked, looking at Blaise who he supposed made the rules and therefore could answer his question. “Just wait until you hear her response”, Draco intervened, looking suspiciously content. “Let’s hear it, Lovegood. That is, of course, you do not prefer to kiss the person you desire most. Could be a welcomed change since you Gryffindor’s are all too fucking lame. You too, Dray.”, Pansy uttered, looking quite nonchalant.
His eyes found those of Draco and when he realized that the Blonde was giving him a smug smile with one eyebrow arched up to the sky it dawned on him that he must have noticed Harry staring at his nether parts.
“Care to elaborate, Blaise, darling?”, she cooed forgedly, knowing full well what he had in mind. “Why, yes, Pansy. This is a phial of the infamous
Luckily, the store had a small corner, the shelves surrounding it making it feel like a private living room. There was a couch Harry was 99% sure Sarah and Henry have had sex on on multiple occasions. Still, it was comfortable and the small TV was big enough to perfunctorily watch a movie on.
Draco stared at him, seemingly shocked from what had just transpired and he stormed off. Harry was alone on the balcony again, the door to Draco's room firmly shut and it was just as if none of it had ever happened, yet the aching in Harry's heart was too strong to convince him it had all been a dream.
“Bloody hell, Potter. I did not expect that”, Draco whispered, slightly out of breath just after they had run towards the grounds, laughing hysterically and occasionally shooting one another a look, feeling free for the first time in forever. “I’m just so fucking tired”, Harry said, surprising himself as the words came out. He couldn’t even explain, pinpoint a certain emotion that he was referring to, it just sounded right. And strangely, Draco seemed to understand what he meant and crushed his lips with an alacrity he hadn’t thought possible before on Harry’s, smiling.
“That’s wonderful! I’m so happy-”, Harry exclaimed, but Sarah had already slung her arms around him.
? Startled, he said: “Um. Sure. Yeah. Whatever, Tuesday’s fine”
“I, for one, happen to know in what predicament Draco here finds himself and therefore agree with you, Lovegood”, Parkinson declared, looking awfully smug. Hermione looked at Malfoy. He looked calm, but when Hermione looked closer he saw that his hands were shaking. He looked like he was about to pass out. “Fine, I’ll close my eyes”, she said reluctantly, “if you all promise to do the same”. She eyed her fellow classmates and received a few nods. “The hell, ‘Mione?”, Ron muttered, scrutinizing his girlfriend. “Just do it”, she whispered back, closing her eyes and praying everyone would keep their eyes shut. Soon, the group followed, leaving only Harry and Malfoy. Quickly, Harry closed his eyes as well.
(“I think I get it now, you know. The stuff that Willinger was so excited about. Remember the stolen flowers? Shit, I’d get excited about that now as well.”)
“Oh, right! I haven’t told you! My mind’s a mess. Henry and I are engaged!”
"Counterproductive?", Harry asked, wondering if she meant that a new phase of obsessing over Draco Malfoy would be a bad way to pass the time. "You're taking this sabbatical to relax for a while, remember? Malfoy would only distract you from coming to terms with what you want to do with your life."
"I'm Malfoy again, then, aren't I?"
, when did that happen?
“Draco. Draco and Harry. Sounds good”, she laughed. “I’ll see you later!”, and with the same ease that Draco carried she disappeared into the crowd.
. Harry was sure his blush had lasted for at least ten minutes.
, he was going to be the end of Draco.
“Salazar, you must really be scared to kiss the person you desire, mate”, Ron commented, looking at Neville with a hint of pity and at Malfoy with a hint of revolt. He eyed Harry, expecting to see an equally disgusted grimace on his best friend’s face. The look Harry was wearing, though, was inscrutable. He was looking zoned-out and completely focused at the same time, confusing his red-haired friend.
"Old habits die hard"
-----
The newly furnished living room was almost unrecognizable, since everything was pushed aside to make space for dancing. And that was what people did. Now Harry didn’t mind having come a bit later, since the awkward standing-and-holding-a-glass stage was already over. To his right, Harry discovered a table full of presents and felt suddenly embarrassed that he didn’t even think about bringing a gift.
He snapped back into reality when he heard someone say:”Draco, who do you pick?”. “Let’s think… how about Luna?”, Malfoy replied, seeming to have regathered his equanimity. Luna smiled sweetly at him, awaiting her new found friend’s response. When Luna had been incarcerated at Malfoy Manor, an unexpected bond had formed between the two, for Draco had snuck down each night to talk to her. Their friendship warmed the hearts of many Eight years, being moved at how open the two were with each other. “I dare you to tell us which teacher you find most attractive or to kiss the person you desire”, Draco finished, getting a beam from Luna in response.
to be interested in Muggle movies. “We should visit you there sometime! You could give us some recommendations'', Pansy beamed, still wearing that same look of expectation in her eyes. Harry looked at her and then to Theodore and Draco next to her, who both smiled politely.
would put it.
Harry was on his way from the restroom back to their table when Hermione came walking towards him, a gentle smile on her face. “Harry, darling, I really did not think this through. I didn’t expect them to propose coming to the videothek.. I know that it’s your safe space”, she said, laying one hand on his left shoulder in a comforting manner.
. Almost choking on his own saliva, Harry quickly went back to studying the floor, pretending to be awfully interested in the wooden ground.
Harry was just getting back into the usual flow that had evolved behind the counter at the store, rearranging movies and searching for new recommendations to give out to customers with oddly specific requests, when the familiar sound of the doorbell flooded his senses. He looked up from the cover of a movie he had been inspecting and was rendered speechless, well, almost.
Harry nodded. He was about to dive into some smalltalk like “This place is great, right?”, when he saw Draco coming from the kitchen area with two glasses in hand.
He did manage to get out a sound akin to “hello”. In front of him were Pansy, Theodore and Draco, all dressed casually and holding a variety of typical Muggle cinema-snacks. Draco, who was carrying a large bowl of popcorn in one hand and a bottle of coke in his other, was dressed in a button-up and sweatpants.
"No, we get along just fine"
“I love rewatching movies, it’s so comforting”, Harry said, facing Draco again. “Exactly, thank you! Plus you get to see all the details and the special effects more closely”, Draco responded in a tone Harry had never heard from him before. On their nights out, Harry either pointedly ignored Draco or caught him in moments where he was just sitting in his chair, cigarette in hand with a hauteur Harry was repulsed by. Mostly. Sometimes, though, this arrogance made Draco’s facial features even more flattering. But Harry would never admit that. He liked blokes, sure, but he could never experience anything other than superficial attraction towards the git.
------
Since Ron‘s method of waking someone included rushing them out of their house in nothing but sweatpants and a shirt, Harry looked disheveled when he made his way home to quickly get changed before going to The Bullseye. He could’ve apparated, but Hermione’s suggestion of waking sounded reasonable. („If Rita Skeeter’s photographers catch a glimpse of me looking like this, I shall stage my own death”, he had joked). So the last thing he needed was seeing Draco across the street, who spotted him immediately and waved at him. He looked, as always, meticulously groomed, in a tailored suit, hair slicked back in a way Harry hadn’t seen in a while. Draco pointed at the bags he was carrying and mouthed something akin to „in a hurry“, smiled, and rushed past an old woman in front of him. Getting smiles from Draco Malfoy was something he was almost used to now. Still, Harry was embarrassed by being seen like that on the street.
"Right now"
"I meant what I said yesterday. You really changed", Harry stated as if trying to placate Draco.
“I’m not as much of a plebian as you might think, Potter”, he stated, his gaze still fixated steadily on Harry’s eyes. “Oh don’t play that card Draco, we all know that you usually only rewatch movies because you have a thing for the actors“, Pansy laughed. Oh, this was getting more and more interesting, Harry thought. Draco was gay, everyone knew that. But having it confirmed over and over again did something to Harry.
They smiled at each other. It was so genuine it made Harry all fuzzy inside. He couldn’t let Draco leave without talking to him about Saturday night. There must be some pretense to have Draco stay with him for just a while-
? Of who though? Neville or Malfoy? Neville immediately stopped, quickly settling down on the pile of pillows he had been sitting on, the feeling of relief written all over his face.
“Lovely, Potter”.
“He’s 32. And actually, it wasn’t that stupid. It was very sweet. Sometimes I behave like a bitter old lady”, Draco now looked at him, deeply.
This was it. This was the single most humiliating position Draco had ever found himself in. Strutting around and constantly wearing a facade, occasionally allowing himself to be bold by glaring at Potter or, hell, even winking at him had been fun. His affectation protected him. But now? Now he almost had an erection and was asked to open the trousers of the most attractive bloke in the room. Fuck, even the whole school and incidentally the person he fancied the most.
He’d been at the Ministry non-stop for the past four weeks and balanced between paperwork, theoretical and practical lessons and studying for the upcoming exams and the new found bar in central London was something to look forward to. The name of the bar-
Shit, this was not how it was supposed to go, Pansy thought, shooting an alarmed look at Blaise, who was feeling equally nervous, yet he looked quite blasé on the outside. Pansy wasn’t so easily fooled.
And then, something magical happened. Or maybe it was just a coincidence. But suddenly, "Don't You (Forget About Me)" was playing from downstairs. Draco leaned in to kiss Harry.
Praying that no one noticed his problem at hand, he pressed his right hand behind his back, demonstrating that he would follow the rules. He had just wanted to start when he heard Potter whisper: “Relax, Malfoy”. Perplexed, he stared at the boy being as confused as Seamus was in Potions. Even though Potter’s words had bewildered him, he had also found some sort of comfort in them, finally starting to bring his left hand to Potter’s belt. He fumbled with the belt buckle, trying to loosen it while his breath hitched.
"This was all some kind of joke to you, then?"
. There still was no sight of Draco. Neither Asteria nor Francis had seen him leave the flat and both of them told Harry that he'd behaved normally when they saw him make coffee or read the newspaper.
“I’ve never been to one. How old is she, anyway?”
“Ugh, you never tire from drinking that, do you?”, Hermione protested, demonstratively sipping from her glass of white wine. Ron grinned and turned to face her and they smiled at each other in such awe it made Harry want to leave the table as soon as possible. Not that he wasn’t happy for them, he was. It just reminded him that he didn’t have anyone to smile at like that.
A few moments passed in silence, but it was strangely comforting. The steady inhale and exhale from Draco’s direction was calming and Harry experienced no pressure to talk. But still, he was glad when Draco started the conversation anew.
They were now standing in front of the couch, not knowing whether to sit down or not.
"And that from a Malfoy"
Harry eyed Pansy expectantly and she asked: “How did we not know you worked at a videothek? Hermione just told us”.
“We can just watch it here. I mean, we’ll hear the doorbell when someone enters”
he was feeling. To stress this, he moved a hand to the back of Draco’s neck and slowly moved it into his hair and let his fingers run through it. To that, Draco opened his mouth slightly and then they were kissing again, fiercer this time, with more deliberateness, more certain of each other’s feelings.
“I don’t even know how this could happen, I could’ve sworn it was supposed to be at five, not four… Anyways! Better hurry”
“Sorry, your card here tells me that you’re still missing 50 pounds”, Harry explained for the third time. The man wanted to rent a movie but still had an imbalance on his account that made it impossible for Harry to give out a movie to him. The man seemed to be visiting every night then, not only on Tuesdays. “I’m sure we can solve this differently… Harry”, he said, ostensibly having read Harry’s name tag. He now was giving Harry such a ridiculously lascivious look that Harry wanted to flee immediately. But then, a miracle happened. Well, not a
Harry was thrilled to hear his name in this inherently new context, in a plea, a demand, a need he was happy to fulfill. And just as he moved his hand towards the Blonde’s belt, the doorbell chimed.
"And also, Longbottom's always been obsessed with plants, so it's not really unexpected either. What do you say about Hannah Abbott who now has become an actor in Mollywood?" "It's Hollywood",Harry corrected, laughing, "but yeah, that really is unexpected. You win."
“Um.. Never have I ever.. had a threesome?” This was basic, verging on boring and he was sure this question had been asked a million times. “No, that’s boring. Ask something else!”, Ginny protested, “I already know who did and who didn’t.”
Harry inhaled deeply and noticed that a shiver ran across his back. He’d known that this matter had worried him over weeks now, but hadn’t been aware that it would be able to make him shiver like that.
"Let me light yours", he insisted, scooting to Harry and bringing his lighter to Harry's cigarette. Harry crampedly looked down, fearing to meet the blonde's eyes. He could feel the warmth coming from Malfoy's body and caught the faint scent of smoke and... chamomile?  "I have a rule, you see. I'm on a first name basis with any person I've ever had a smoke with", he said, bringing one hand to his oh-so-perfect-hair and smirked. "Fine, whatever...Draco",Harry replied, blushing slightly. He prayed that the darkness would veil it, although he felt as if Draco watched him so intently that he wouldn't have missed it. This was flirting right? Offering someone your first name might not be a common flirting technique but given their history it was. Harry took a puff from his cigarette. The feeling dawned on him that Draco Malfoy would more likely be the reason for a heart attack, not the cigarette. "Hey, I found something in the kitchen", Draco said, revealing a small white box that Harry recognised as Francis' sacred box of pralines. "That's Francis', you know", Harry mentioned, "he'll kill us both if he finds out". "He won't know if we both only eat one. Chocolate and cigarettes is a divine mix", Draco stated matter-of-factly. Harry doubted that Francis would not notice- he really was obsessed with his pralines-yet who could resist chocolate? (and Draco Malfoy, a traitorous voice chimed in the back of Harry's mind).
Harry had not realised that his obsession of trying to beat Malfoy at everything they did was still very much present when he declared: "Well, then I am, too." Francis, though still very much at a loss, gave them an approving smile and offered to help Malfoy get his stuff the next day but the blonde politely declined.
“Alright, who’s in then?”, Pansy asked, already ensconcing herself in an armchair, wrapping her arms around a pillow positioned in front of her stomach. A few approving nods and murmured “yes”s followed and soon all of them were sitting in a round, some on the floor, some on chairs and sofas. Well, all except Harry.
"Even though you have a fucking boyfriend"
“Well, I’m glad you’re not an old lady”
as well.
"That's not true. I just don't like when my personal space gets intruded"
"I'm glad you can see that".
“I don’t know why Pansy said that, like, it’s not even true. I only got you that drink because she told me to. Otherwise I wouldn’t-”
"I'll be off to bed now", Draco announced approximately half an hour later which they had passed with talks about what their former classmates were doing now, rating the unexpectancy and weirdness of it. Harry had conceded that he had always underestimated Neville and seeing him graduate top of the class (after Hermione, of course) had been a shock to him and many others. "But that he now runs a store for plants seems... expected but also like a waste of potential?", he had added. "Just because it's not academically challenging doesn't mean it's not fulfilling"
Harry was silent for a moment.
“I’ll have to disagree on that. I mean yeah, you’re father isn’t cute, but-“
“I was hoping I might catch you here”. Harry turned around, bewildered, to find Draco standing in front of him, two take away cups in hand. “I know you’d be nervous. So here’s something that helps me calm down”
---------------
“Malfoy”, Neville stated to the surprise of everyone, “either you kiss the person you desire the most or you undo the trousers of whoever the bottle lands on only using your left hand”. A collection of appreciative hums went through the round. “Which bottle?”, Draco asked, scrutinizing the various half-empty and empty bottles scattered across the floor all over the room.
“You’ve seen Forrest Gump?”
It was true. Ron had started Auror training without him and Hermione was studying to become a member of the department of Muggle liaisons. He himself, however, was currently doing tarot readings for fun with Asteria and playing board games with Francis, while both of them actually went to university, leaving him to be the only one completely clueless with what to do with his life. "Well, what do you want me to do? I can't tell him to leave now, he's unpacking his things as we're speaking". "How about giving him a chance? See if he's really changed. If not, we're always here for you, Harry. You could always move in with us."
“Yes! And you must be Harry”
The only thing reassuring Draco was that Potter wasn’t displaying a cocky attitude. In fact, it was quite the opposite. Potter seemed to be sweating an awful lot, his cheeks flushed and his lips slightly parted. Which, frankly, did not help Draco’s situation. Fuck, Potter looked like he had just been thoroughly snogged.
“Any will do”, Neville replied, picking a random bottle which happened to be empty and placing it in the middle of the circle. Blaise had to suppress a chuckle, being amused at how Neville played into his cards without even realizing it. He nudged Pansy, who was sitting next to the Slytherin, lightly. “Little does he know I memorized a certain spell…”, he whispered, only audible for her. She, too, felt an urge to laugh at how perfectly splendid everything was going but focused on staying solemn.
“Shall I get us something to drink, then?”
“My cologne?”
When the door closed with a plangent sound, Harry blinked a few times. Then he inhaled, exhaled. That was a lot of information to process. The customer had a name. Sally. And Draco was supposed to be his boyfriend. Well, shit.
Harry was hurrying to get to the videothek, still in his robes from the Ministry. He hadn’t got the slightest idea how to explain his very wizard-y outfit to a Muggle (Sarah), but right now, he didn’t care.
“32”, Draco then said.
Harry was ten minutes early, so he waited in front of Willinger’s office. He had informed him that they would quickly go over all the details before he departed.
Ten minutes later, the door to the store opened anew, and once again Draco Malfoy entered. This time, though, he was holding a big bag of popcorn. “The gas station was the only store still open, but I found popcorn!”, he said, triumphantly.
Harry laughed. “I almost died, but apart from that it was very tasty”
“Yeah. Here’s the popcorn”, Draco said again, unnecessarily.
Harry had never intended for his job choice to be so mundane that the hours he was working seemed to stretch across the whole day, making it impossible for him to do anything enjoyable afterwards since his energy was drenched to an extent he did not consider normal anymore. He filled his nights with movies, particularly bad ones with barely any plot. He did not dare to watch movies he’d never seen before because the prospect of a romance within the movie frightened him. He’d felt lonely before, but now he was feeling confused as well.
Blaise looked up with interest when Longbottom actually seemed to consider it and almost gawped when Longbottom gave Draco a questioning glance. “Have at it then”, the Slytherin in question retorded, an amused smirk creeping up on his face.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
He really didn’t want to find out. But could he handle it?
Harry had been meaning to owl Hermione anyway regarding his plans, as much as he could put into writing without incriminating himself. At the end of his summary, he worked in a request for all of the information she could give him on how she had used the Protean Charm, and anything else she could tell him about it.
They’d been engaged and living together no longer than eight months, but with Ginny on the road so often, Harry mostly took on the burden of fixing up the place himself. He’d even started doing some of it the Muggle way, though as a result, the whole endeavour was taking much longer than he had originally intended.
Malfoy’s second attempt went much better. The shoebox dropped down several meters by the looks of it—or at least, from the right angle. With the top on it looked perfectly normal, which was the desired effect.
Harry stifled a moan as Malfoy squirmed under him, overloaded. “Did you just come?”
“Or is it me you love getting fucked by Draco, and my—exquisite—cock?” He punctuated his last two words with pointedly hard, pressing thrusts into the sweetest of Draco’s spots.
“An emergency,” Harry finished for her, nodding. “Go on then.”
“How about this Saturday?”
The eyebrow Draco arched at him then was a touch challenging, and Harry wondered if they were thinking the same thing. Namely that Draco could actually be fucking him properly…if Harry wanted him to.
arrived, Harry was not ready for it. He had been so busy, distracted and sleep deprived that he hadn’t realised it was upon them until the weekend before, and he’d been dreading it every day since.
“Oh, don’t look so horrified. You can’t possibly be that innocent.”
Warily, Harry nodded.
“Any good advice for me?”
“Harry, we were so
“You can’t touch me all fucking sexy like that and tell me not to come,” Harry protested breathlessly, but it was suitable distraction to hold him off a while longer.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“We should. Are you free next Saturday as well?”
When the woman he assumed to be Cassie looked up, she appeared to completely lose the path of her question. She had curly blond hair and big eyes, and she was staring at him with a sort of shock that Harry was well familiar with—though it hadn’t happened in the middle of Muggle London since he was a small boy.
Harry got fantastically lost in hot kisses and seductive friction before he managed to breathe the spells they needed over Draco’s lips. His legs hooked over the backs of Harry’s thighs—but when Harry tried pressing in, even with the ease of the spells his moan went tight and pained and Harry held up, his tip leaking slickly on the inviting whirl of his arse.
He was grateful for the distraction.
“You really aren’t going to tell me what I’m about to eat?”
When he teased in with his tongue again, Draco clenched tight all around it, and Harry knew by now that he was fighting very hard not to come all over the mirror a second time. The slight whine in his moan was another clue.
Harry’s question was swallowed up, and Draco was kissing him again. It was a shock of the best sort all over again, caught up in the hot press of Draco’s lips on his. It was sparking desire all through him.
Harry chewed his lip. “I might’ve thought about it more than strictly necessary at the time.”
“Don’t threaten me with a good time, Malfoy.”
“Would you be that terribly bothered if I were?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Perhaps you missed the bit where he just called me a whore.”
“Why would he ever agree to do that?”
Draco didn’t touch him again, or bite him, but he didn’t need to, that low voice so close to his ear was enough.
“And I would be here for…”
“Is it still the Centaur Rights cases?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
—mm’so—
Malfoy’s eyes flashed genuine annoyance. “Is this some sort of punishment you’re inflicting on me? Have I not paid enough for my crimes?”
,” Harry sighed, and felt Draco tense pleasurably around his cock, throbbing under the overwhelm.
The chaise was quite comfortable, for one, and furthermore—
“Yes well. I’ve never had any siblings, but I imagine she must’ve missed her sister. They talked a lot about when they were younger, and very little about their husbands or politics. Father always called Andromeda the Traitress—and still does actually—so you can only imagine how mystified I was to be having tea with her.”
“…’S’pose I wanted to give you an out, Malfoy. We’re reaching a point here where there could be real legal ramifications for being involved in this. So.”
Hazily, Harry watched his once-rival nursing the last few sips from a nearly empty glass, and wondered how anyone could manage
“Cut it out, Malfoy. What is it?”
“I suppose not.”
“You drugged us at the
“You could make me shut up,” Draco offered, a challenge in the faint arch of one pale eyebrow.
“What about the Pygmy Puffs?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
A number of others waved and nodded at him, and Harry waved and nodded back. He was seeing a few more smiles than tears this year, and he supposed that was a good thing.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“You didn’t, and I nearly killed you too.”
Most of what anyone was willing to say was vague at best, and often only anecdotal—but that hadn’t stopped Harry jotting it down—just in case.
Harry couldn’t even open his eyes, he didn’t want Draco to stop stroking his hair, he didn’t want the peace to go away.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
When he did eventually look up Malfoy was long gone. He took a while longer finishing his own drink, but eventually he shrunk the books down to fit into his pockets and gathered their glasses up from the table.
now—but what was
you willing to take?”
Harry was asleep in minutes, and did not hear Draco’s sigh of exasperated resignation as he stretched out in the bed to sleep beside him.
Sleepily he grumped over to the window, only to freeze, his hand stilling on its rusty latch when it dawned on him whose owl was paying him a visit. An uncomfortable twist took up residence in his chest, paired with a rush of completely unnecessary adrenalin, all of which Harry tried to ignore.
Last year, only seven months off the War at the time, a push for normalcy and a desperate scramble to bury the proverbial bodies had driven the Ministry to hold a ball absolutely no one wanted to attend. It had been a rather depressing evening.
Harry sighed. “Alright. Where to next, then?”
“Very,” he admitted, having not bothered to eat before he left.
“What, as in…together?”
When they first arrived, he had surveyed the high-ceilinged ballroom in which the reception was being held with mild interest. He had eyed the hors d’oeuvre table with a great deal more interest, but on closer inspection most of the expensive-looking food on display did not appear to be very appetising.
The sound drew Harry from the kitchen, half-expecting to see Draco standing there.
It felt far too good to question what was causing it, but Harry endured several more shots of heat when Draco’s muted moan hummed against his back, the prod of a pointed nose into the curve of his neck—and the hard nudge of Draco’s cock against his arse.
Harry shrugged awkwardly.
“Harry.”
“You can say no, Potter. You won’t hurt my feelings.”
?”, the voice belonging to Draco enunciated pointedly. This was a show. Still, Harry blushed. “Um- I. No, don’t worry, he was just about to leave”. The man turned around, looked at Draco, turned to Harry, raised an eyebrow and left. Unfortunately with the movie in hand. But that was a problem for future Harry.
could sedate me with”, Draco replied and Harry could see him slowly sucking in a small part of his under lip.
-------
"Old habits die hard", Draco answered.
They sat in silence for a few minutes in which Harry shifted stiffly in his chair, rearranging his blanket every few seconds. "Do you smoke?", Malfoy asked, opening a pack he had been carrying in the pocket of his hoodie and offering one to Harry. Harry nodded, taking a cigarette in his hand and bringing it to his lips. "Wouldn't have expected that. But then again, you did kill Voldemort. Why should you care about the killing side effects of a cigarette?", Malfoy said in a soft voice, smiling again. Fuck, since when was Malfoy's smile so appealing? Harry couldn't help but (half) smile back. Malfoy, too, had put his cigarette between his lips. He held the lighter in his one hand and used the other as protection from the wind, drawing together his eyebrows in a manner that was just so attractive it was unfair. Harry was sure that if he tried to make a face like that, he'd simply look constipated. Malfoy took his first draw from the cigarette and let it evaporate in the night air.
“I’m going out for a smoke, anyone wanna join?”, Draco asked after a while, rummaging in his pockets for a lighter. “Sure thing”, Theodore said, just as Harry opened his mouth in an attempt of bravery. He saw Ginny arching up her eyebrows at Pansy and the latter said: “Theo, you were supposed to help me pick out a dress for my birthday party, you simpleton”. “
Thus, he made his way towards Willinger’s office, wearily and exhausted. The door flung open, just as he was about to knock. “Door charm. Charming, eh? Don’t stand there all flabbergasted! Do come in!”, Harry’s superior said cheerfully, his huge mustache distracting Harry. If he was getting fired, then Willinger would do it in a “look at the new opportunities'' sort of way. He was chewing on something that looked like a dried piece of banana, his little mouse-like eyes bobbing up and down in an infantile way. This man truly was something.
Draco had already opened the balcony door and was now stepping outside. There was always such a casualness in the former Slytherin's actions, a way of taking things for granted. Like there was no conceivable other option than Harry following outside. And Harry did. Draco was already sitting in his chair from yesterday and eyed Harry with interest. Harry, too, sat down, already regretting it. The shivers from before were present again and he feared any attempt at conversation would end in incoherent mumbling from his part.
-----
The next morning, Harry woke up with a sudden urge to sneeze. When the sneeze didn't come, he blinked a couple of times and searched for his glasses. There was a heavy arm slung around his bare torso and Draco Malfoy's hair was so close to his nose that Harry did not only believe he could tell what ingredients exactly was in the blonde's shampoo, he also found the source of his impending sneeze. When it didn't come again, he allowed himself to fully take in his view and how the sun made Draco's hair look golden.
The next morning, Harry found himself shifting awkwardly to and fro in his room, already fucking sensing that Malfoy would either be still fast asleep on the sofa or sitting in the ktichen slurping black coffee, looking like he owned the kitchen. "This is ridiculous'', he muttered to himself, deciding that he couldn't hide in his room all day, when there was a knock on his door. His heart made a jump and instantaneously there was a queasy feeling in the pit of his stomach and he couldn't help but feel betrayed by his body for acting like that. "Come in", he exclaimed, gathering his equanimity.
—————
“I know!! Anyways, we’re preparing everything for the engagement party now. I have to meet up with the caterers and- Shit, they’re coming in twenty minutes”
“Hey, stranger!”, a voice called. He turned to see that it was the girl from the shop.
“You wouldn’t mind me dropping by on Tuesday, right? I was a little scattered last week so I forgot to rent a new movie”
"Draco Malfoy. You are highly intelligent, yet you're lacking common sense and please, never become an Auror. You would make a terrible one", he made a quick break and breathed in slowly, "Francis is straight, Draco. He only talks about me because he's trying to set us up. He would be laughing so hard right now, knowing he achieved the complete opposite. I don't have feelings for him. The only one I have feelings-"
“Oh, fortunately, there are many sides to me you don’t know”
A lot of lost flowers, boredom and lack of enthusiasm later, Harry finally was on the way to dispatch the file he and Ron had been working on all throughout Tuesday, filled with detailed description of the lost flowers and recapitulating overly dramatic statements from the residents of the neighborhood. They had not managed to find the cause of the vanishing flowers yet but being in Auror training meant being stuck with writing boring assessments after each mission.
“What is it you want from me, then,
"I'll have you know that we're not sharing blankets, Ron!", answered Harry defiantly, realizing that We both have our own blanket wouldn't make it any better.
"Can I come in?". Harry was standing at Ron and Hermione's porch, shivering from the cold. The seasons had melted into another without Harry noticing, hence he wasn't wearing anything to protect him from the icy temperatures. "Harry, love, of course! I'm afraid we have to leave in five, though", Hermione explained in a rush. She was already going back to their small kitchen that looked like an outright mess and clearly expected Harry to just follow and close the door behind him. "I'm sorry about the mess. Ron's and my cooking really isn't improving." There were pans and pots scattered across the whole kitchen counter and Harry thought he could identify a... cauldron? "Where are you headed", Harry asked. "We're meeting my parents tonight. Ron's out buying flowers and I'm meeting him at the Apparition point in Chelsea. Is everything alright? You look..." Hermione was now staring at Harry's appearance that, frankly, was a little concerning. His hair was even messier than usual and the dark circles under his eyes were clearly not indicating something good. "Yeah, it's fine. You go ahead and meet Ron. Call me when you're free". "Harry, I'm terribly sorry... I'll definitely call you tomorrow evening, okay? And you're coming over the day after tomorrow for dinner, right?" Harry only nodded.
“I dunno.” Harry paused, thinking back. “He's still a prat.”
He swallowed as much as he could, trying not to choke a second time as he eased off slowly. Draco’s cock fell spent against his front, and Harry licked over it a bit longer, appreciating the prone tremors he was drawing out of the man beneath him.
“I thought Muggle Artifacts were underfunded, didn’t your father work for years to stop them raiding your house?”
about you—what happened?”
“Alright?” he checked, handing the bottle back to be stoppered, only for Malfoy to take another sip instead.
Harry ushered to the aisle where it was stored: Pictures produced by John Hughes. It was a popular choice, thus he found it immediately. Back at the counter, Draco was still leaning against it while Harry typed the number of the movie into the computer programme. Harry could smell the sweet, syrupy smell of the popcorn Draco had placed next to his elbow, but it was mixed with something more ebony and rich which indubitably was his cologne. The silence between them made Harry want to squirm in discomfort. He had to say something. “Didn’t take you for the sweet guy, Malfoy”, Harry muttered, now daring to look up from his computer only to fixate the popcorn in front of him. “Oh, I’m terribly sweet in the right spots, Potter”, he replied. Harry looked up and saw Draco staring at his fingers on the keyboard. There was a shade of red in the Blonde’s cheeks. What kind of innuendo was that supposed to be?
On his way home, Harry pondered about the two possibilities of takeout that were on his usual route: Pizza or Curry. Tuesdays were meant to be the only evenings where Harry bought takeout since the time span between Auror training and his shift at the videothek was too short to make something half decent himself. A year ago, Harry had stuck to said rule, but now both the waitress at the Pizza place as well as the owner of the Indian restaurant knew him better than Harry cared to admit.
“But Alison and the sporty one..”
Draco was staring at him, his eyes pierced to his own and Harry quickly looked away, but when he looked back after a second, Draco’s eyes remained set on him. “Umm, you guys?”, Pansy intervened, “we came here for a movie, not a staring contest, remember?”. Harry could feel his cheeks heat up and he focused on Pansy instead. “Yes, absolutely, right. Let’s see… Um, have you got anything… in mind?”. “Stop baffling us with your eloquence, Potter”, Draco uttered in a teasing tone and Harry tried his best not to pay him any attention, fixating his eyes firmly on Pansy. “Shush, Draco”, she intervened, “No, we were hoping for a recommendation, like we said. Genre doesn’t matter”.
Exposed, Harry felt the heat rise to his entire face and he was stunned, suddenly unable to move. Draco's chair was pulled closer to his own and instead of pulling out the pack of cigarettes, Draco brought his arm closer to Harry's and let it slowly wander towards Harry's shoulder, then his neck, his jaw.
“I had to attend this stupid thing my co-worker hosted”
“How was the milk? Hope you didn’t need an antidote”
"No, not really"
. Already preparing a shot of the
minutes. With a
"Would you like for me to leave?"
"I'm sorry".
The ceiling was covered in shadows from the tree on the street and Harry was lying completely still, trying to detect any kinds of movement or sound from the room next to his. Draco's room, he reminded himself. The conversation from the night was playing and replaying in Harry's head and he was searching for any signs, any words or any syllables that were not spoken but had hung in the air that Draco might feel the same thing he did. Hermione had once said that it surprised her that nothing ever happened between the two of them back in Hogwarts, remarking that the sexual tension between the boys had always been discernible and utterly present. Harry had only made a dismissive hand gesture, declaring her idea ridiculous. But now it seemed as if she had been the only cognizant, attentive person because suddenly it all made sense. Harry saw how there were certain features about Draco, small details, really, that did not seem new to him. He'd studied those pale blue eyes that were almost grey at certain times, hair that shimmered in the right light, bone structure that seemed so perfectly appealing in the right angle; observed his manners in a careful way and it was almost as if now he was finally letting himself see them without the haze of oblivion lingering over them.
- was not less cheugy than of those they had visited before, but something about it felt homey and welcoming to the twenty-somethings that was their friend group. Harry was glad to be surrounded by cheerful people at least one night a week. Not even Ron had been able to cheer him up or distract him at work. He’d been so set on becoming an Auror after school, mainly because helping other people was all Harry knew how to do and what he was sure he excelled at, but the abundance of mundane paperwork and the platitudes coming from his superiors made him doubt that decision not too seldomly.
"Well, he better not lay a finger on you, otherwise I will pay the git a visit", Ron concluded. Telling Ron that the only thing he'd been able to think about these last few days, was, indeed, Malfoy laying- more than one- finger on him, might not be an advisable move.
At this, Harry recalled last night’s excruciating headache for which he took 2 painkillers and one phial of Sleezy’s Sleep Potion. That probably hadn’t been a good idea. But then he remembered how he had felt last night, overwhelmed by the prospect of running a department, confused because he realized he wouldn’t actually mind being fired, guilty because Ron was so much better at their job and feeling that he should be the one getting this opportunity and, of course, relentlessly present: Draco Malfoy.
“Is it always so exciting with you then, Potter?”, Draco asked once they were alone again, Harry standing behind the counter and Draco leaning against it. Harry only grinned. “A pity we didn’t start sneaking around at Hogwarts, would’ve made everything a lot more interesting”, Draco continued. Then he leaned over, lightly pulled at the collar of Harry’s shirt and pressed a small kiss to his lips, let go of his shirt again, ran a hand through his own hair and winked. A second later, he was gone. Harry still stood behind the counter, dumbfounded.
-----
“Fine, Pans, I’ll kiss them but only if you all promise to close your eyes when I do.”, Malfoy announced, drawing out a few protests from his housemates. “What the hell, Malfoy? Why should you be allowed to kiss the person with no one watching?”, Ron demanded, looking almost livid. “I agree. It would be a little unfair. If you don’t want to, why not just do the other task?”, Hermione chimed in in support of her boyfriend. “Because, mind you, the other task is equally humiliating for me, Granger”, Malfoy conceded. Harry was shocked to hear him speaking in such honest tones.
"You pour the water into a small pot and let it cook, not boil, and then pour it into this teapot right here over here, let it steep for six minutes and voilà, you've got your proper English tea", Malfoy expounded. Harry chose to ignore the turn his stomach made when Malfoy casually used a french word with such a perfect pronunciation.
Harry woke up in waves, reality hitting him in phases. First, there was a sound. An intermittent dropping of a liquid met with a not-so intermittent banging on a door a few rooms away, followed by footsteps ascending a staircase. Then there was a faint odor meeting his nostrils, slightly moldy and wood-like. He remembered that the repairment charm for the leak in the bathroom adjacent to his bedroom must’ve let up. Well, shit. Lastly, there was someone hovering above him, shaking his shoulder gently.
“Or this time, we spice it up a little” , Blaise suggested, eyes sparkling with a hint of joy while revealing a little phial that he’d been carrying all night. Pansy, who had protested that after playing Truth or Dare once a week for months now it had gotten a bit boring, thank you very much, smiled approvingly. She did not want to see the Weasel make out with Granger for the umpteenth time, nor did she fancy having to watch another strip tease from anyone playing.
“Weasly! Ready when you are”, Willinger called.
The next two days, Harry kept dwelling on the fact that Draco Malfoy had used weird innuendos in front of him.
Back in his room, Harry opened the door to his balcony that had been ajar for a few hours now, letting in the sounds of cars, motorcycles and drunk people laughing and talking loudly outside. The sounds of civilization were soothing to Harry, letting him know that he was not isolated. He decided to step out on the balcony like he did most of the nights where he just couldn't sleep, no matter how often he counted to 100 or tried to concentrate on every limb of his body pressed to the mattress. Over the course of the three months he had lived with Francis and Asteria, the balcony had become his safe space, his spot, his anchor during long nights. The air was crisp, almost fresh but Harry didn't mind when goosebumps began to form on his bare arms. He watched a happy couple on the street, arms flung around each other and was able to relax a little when it hit him: The room adjacent to his was empty, meaning that no-one would disturb his peace on his balcony. Well, at least until someone would move into the room. There was a french door to this very balcony, too. And unfortunately, Harry now knew very well who this someone would be.
The next few days Harry felt as if he was living in a parallel universe where smoking and eating chocolate with Draco Malfoy was the most normal routine anyone could find themselves in. He spent his mornings laying on the couch reading or helping Francis with his studies-Harry made an excellent studying partner as it turned out, Hermione had always had too high standards-when an elated Draco Malfoy entered the flat, either after a walk or a run for errands, sometimes glancing over at Harry and Francis, his smile fading. Harry had accepted that the conundrum that was Draco Malfoy simply did not want to be solved, so he didn't pay these shifts of emotion any attention. In the afternoons Draco was always out, yet Harry didn't ask where he was going. Francis was off to uni or meeting up with his infamous study group, but Asteria normally revealed herself at around 2 pm. She always stayed up until late in the night. Her rhythm was very different but Harry found it awfully convenient for he always had someone to chat with and the range of topics that were covered with two individuals as different as Francis and Asteria was astounding. The evenings felt like well-rehearsed déjà-vus and if someone were to tell Harry that all of it had been a dream, he'd believe them. The only evidence was the slowly accumulating ashtray and the decreasing amount of chocolate pralines. Their conversations had been a little stiff but were now slowly but surely evolving into something natural, something comfortable. They talked about everything that came to mind, Quidditch, their former classmates, their plans for the future, carefully tiptoeing around the topic that felt imminent: the war. One evening, Asteria had convinced Harry that eyeliner would look "super hot" on him and Harry let her go along with it. "Don't squint your eyes! You'll ruin my art!", Asteria laughed as she applied the eyeliner on Harry's right eyelid. The liquid felt cold but oddly exciting at the same time. But right after Harry closed his eyes again to let Asteria apply the eyeliner on his left eyelid, he heard the door to Draco's door being opened. It was almost as if Harry could feel Draco's stare on him as he heard the latter's steps on the floor coming closer. Harry, he was sure, must have looked like a complete idiot, still Draco just raised an eyebrow at him when Harry opened his eyes again and the blonde stalked off towards the kitchen and the teakettle.
“You’re welcome. And remember, Potter, no one is forcing you to do this. You can still just say no.”
"No, nothing too bad". Only his feelings shattered and stomped on as
“In the entrance hall? I’ll have you know that I went to get drinks for us, Pot-”
“That was stupid of me to assume, sorry”
"You're quite fond of referring to me as anything other but my name today, aren't you?", Harry asked, hoping he'd get to the root of Draco's state. But he only got a muttered "hmph" as a reply. They spent the following minutes in silence and this time, Harry definitely interpreted it as an uncomfortable one. It was as if something unspoken was hanging in the air, as if the reason for Draco's behaviour would be the answer to the queasy feeling in Harry's stomach as well. Harry had almost given up about finding out and didn't protest when Draco lit a cigarette without asking him, too. "I was at my mother's, you see", Draco suddenly said. He sounded blasé but Harry didn't buy it. "Oh" was his response for he had absolutely no idea what an appropriate answer would be, seeing that his asking could be easily seen as prying. "Yeah.
It was past 11 pm and Harry could feel himself growing impatient. These past few days, Draco had always been back way earlier.
“Very well. Let’s see… Longbottom. You either kiss the person you desire the most or you give the person sitting to your left a hickey. A scandalously big one, might I add”, Blaise demanded, looking smug because the person sitting next to Neville was no other than
Harry was caught off guard. “Um. Sure. Yeah”, he replied and was blushing so heavily he was sure he could hear Ginny snicker. How did she always
Asteria had noticed Harry's fixated look on Draco's room and because he really couldn't be bothered to come up with a reason for his fixation, he excused himself and went back to his room. I can face Voldemort, I might as well face Draco Malfoy, he thought and pushed the queasy feeling aside and with all the feigned determination he could muster, he opened the door to the balcony and approached Draco's door.
Monday passed slowly as well, the only thing to look forward to being his shift at the videothek the following day. “Harry, mate, Willinger wants us to join Douglas and Marrow on their mission tonight, you know, the case with the vanishing flowers all across this Muggle town”, Ron announced while they made their way back to their small office space after lunch break. “Remind me again why he needs four people on that case? It’s just flowers!”,Harry protested half-heartedly, knowing full well that Ron didn’t want to go, either. “Something about ´Dark spirits destroying peace and serenity´- I really had to try my best not to laugh when Willinger told me this bullshit”, Ron laughed.
Harry had been all alone that evening. He'd bought take-away at his favorite Indian place downtown and had listened to some of the Muggle bands Francis had on vinyl, still in awe of their unique sound, glad to have something other than the musicians the Dursley's had listened to all these years ago. He was glad he'd finally managed to find solace in spending time alone, not minding his own company as much as he used to. Surprisingly, he had gone to bed at around eleven and even managed to fall asleep. Well, until someone (Francis) had burst into the kitchen.
Ensconced in one of the chairs of their incongruous set of chairs, holding a glass of white wine in his still so awfully veiny and pale hand and looking as smug as ever was
, Harry thought.
“I’m- I’m not even sure this is the right job for me. Ron is so much more invested- Hell, everyone is so much more dedicated than I am, yet Willinger chose me. I don’t want to take something I have not earned”
“Well, go! I’ve got this”
once”, Ron asked, but Blaise just shrugged. “Luna, pick the next one and we’ll just wait”, Blaise suggested. “Okay. I pick you, Zabini”, Luna said while smiling, still wearing that dreamy look on her face, “You either perform a strip tease or you try the potion, too”. Without a second to spare, Blaise immediately poured himself a shot, expecting it not to work on him either. He, too, drowned the shot and tried to sit down again, when he said “Fuck, my legs are forcing me to stand”, he groaned.
at him. A small voice at the back of his head kept telling him that it had indeed been flirting. But no. Even if Draco had intended to come across as flirty it was only meant in a teasing, joking way, Harry was sure. Or worse, to mess with him.
They sat like that for what seemed like hours and the soap-opera (Francis' guilty pleasure) was actually quite amusing. "I must admit, it really isn't that bad", Harry said after a while. "All the derision from your part has been pointless then,eh? You officially are a fan of Champagne and Roses?", Francis laughed and Harry couldn't help but laugh, too, when he heard the infamous sound of Draco Malfoy's door knob being turned and his laughter died in his throat but Francis kept shaking with laughter. The look that Draco shot them then was officially worse than any he'd shot Harry's way before and given their history, that was fucking bad.
Malfoy quirked up an eyebrow. "Yes, Potter, I do or will be as soon as Francis asks me to". "See, then you have every right to be here on this balcony as well"
Draco scoffed. "Of course you'd say that. That saviour complex of yours is still present then, huh?"
"Chocolate?",Draco had stored the pralines under his chair and was now opening it to reveal that the exact amount from after their nightly indulgence was in it. Harry selected a dark chocolate one and was about to pop it into his mouth when Draco suggested that they might as well have a smoke, too. It felt strange, almost like they were having some sort of routine. Like a couple, the traitorous voice chimed in once again. Draco was taking a drag from his cigarette, accentuating the veins on his hand. His buttons-up shirt was long enough to veil both of the blonde's forearms, leaving Harry to ponder about whether or not the Dark Mark would still be visible. He must have been staring, because Draco stated: "It's still there, in case you're wondering. Reminding me every day of the ubiquitousness of my evil self". Harry noted a hint of sarcasm in his voice. "I didn't mean to stare". "You're not the first and you most definitely will not be the last, Harry". How Draco pronounced his name was almost as if it was something sacred, something worth to be enunciated fully and at all costs.
“This is great, Dray”
"I got kicked out of my old apartment and really need a place to live, Potter. If that's not okay with you...I would understand, given our history.. I would even encourage you to kick me out, if I'm being honest." Harry was taken aback by this sudden sincerity and show of vulnerability from Malfoy, slowly understanding that he must be really desperate if he could deign to accept an apartment with two muggles and his ex-nemesis. Although, Harry had to concede, nemesis really was a little of an overstatement. "You are aware of the fact that I live here, too, right?", Harry asked sarcastically. "Of course", Malfoy answered, sounding all solemn. That's it, Harry thought, If he's okay with it, I can be too.
? It’s insanely popular amongst Muggles and came out in 1985… so about 18 years ago”, he suggested, already walking up to the aisle where it was stored. “Nah, we’ve seen that one already”, Theodore said. That was surprising. They actually were serious about this, then. Harry had now left the counter and was standing near Pansy and Theodore. Draco had gone towards the counter and was leaning against it with his elbow so that he was facing Harry. He remained silent but that smug smile was still imprinted on his lips. Harry’s face was flushing once again. “We all really liked it.. Especially Draco, he watched it again the next morning”. Harry turned to face Draco, still bedazzled by this side of him he’d never known until recently.
“Sorry?”
“Hi”, Harry breathed.
"Oh, it's you", Harry uttered, extremely relieved. "Don't worry, I'm not the hot blonde still sleeping on our sofa that has a weird obsession with calling you by your last name", Francis smirked, closing the door behind him. He immediately flung himself on Harry's bed, beaming. Harry was rendered speechless.
“Yeah, I think I get it, Potter, thanks. Now, if you don’t mind, I’d like to finish my cigarette in peace.“
The blonde's finger found Harry's lip, softly caressing it. Their eyes met with an intensity that made him shiver when he saw it. The thumb on his lip was soft and warm and Harry opened his mouth a little, excruciatingly slow. Draco's eyes were now fixated on his mouth. He could feel the distance of their faces decreasing and his pulse increasing, heart pounding in his ears.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
He had felt the worst for the people, of course, forced to so regularly live under the Dementors oppressive emptiness, with no idea at all what was causing so much of their pain.
“I’m surprised you haven’t asked to split it,” Draco drawled across the table.
Harry nipped purposely just beneath his navel and watched the shock of pleasure cross pointed features. The kitchen’s wooden floorboards creaked a bit under his knees as Harry worked Draco’s trouser buttons open by hand.
Was a lie of omission as bad as an outright one?
He checked the push light, which was off—acknowledging Cassie had seen his message—and when Harry clicked it on again her reply was short and clear.
It took Draco the better part of a half hour to finish it, and he looked unusually uncertain when he finally lowered his wand.
It was late to be having dinner, but Harry had undeniably worked up an appetite in the few hours since he turned up to the library. He let Draco lead him to the kitchen—down several narrower corridors and one particularly curvy stone staircase before they approached a large wooden archway that opened up into the kitchen.
Harry hesitated, and shrugged indecisively. “I wanted to forget for a while.”
They cast in tandem another two hours, until Harry began to feel a bit woozy once again, and knew he couldn’t possibly push himself through another spell. Now it was his turn to cross the room and wait for Draco to finish the careful steps of the charm.
As it turned out, the owl was not terribly urgent.
It was not doing him any favours that so many small moments of his erstwhile evening with Malfoy would return to him, at the most inconvenient times, bringing with them a plethora of shame and unquestionably—desire. Harry tried his best to ignore that last bit, with varying degrees of success. If he threw himself into his other endeavours, he could mostly manage to shut it all out, for a time.
“Oi, Hermione’s not exactly fitting in either, she’s—” Ron broke off when Hermione elbowed him.
His voice carried, weighted with deadly seriousness. He was so focused on Draco that he didn’t spare a thought for the fact Zabini was there to hear everything they said. Draco’s lips flattened to a tight line, and Harry wished he didn’t want so badly to bite them swollen-red.
He let another hot sharp cry when Harry pulled out to slam back in as Draco’s hips bucked under the weight of Harry’s. Gasping, Draco locked pleasure-blown gazes with him and Harry felt the telltale tremor of Draco’s impending climax deep inside.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry was quiet a moment, biting at his lip thoughtfully.
It was becoming clear to Harry they were talking past each other, and getting nowhere.
“Do you honestly believe either of us would be here right now if you hadn’t lied for us when you did?”
“Actually, I was referring specifically to myself.”
“Right.”
. Please.” Harry could see a tinge of pink at the tips of his ears.
He might’ve internally debated with himself whether it was the best idea to be having wine so early in the day, but as an astute grey gaze narrowed at him knowingly, he was rather glad to have it.
“You wanted to see it. It isn’t a fancy topiary garden with peacocks and a massive greenhouse, but it’s mine.”
Knowing he would always be an easy handful of Floo powder away, Harry wasn’t sure if he had the fortitude to stop—but he knew he would need to find it if he wanted to keep his life with Ginny from burning to the ground. He would have to go back to normal, as if none of it had ever happened.
He picked up a rhythm, teasing a touch up to rub just behind his bollocks, and Harry’s humming muffled around a slight choke when Draco started pushing more persistently into the back of his throat.
“What a surprise. I meant how was your practice going?”
Draco barely looked at any of it, leading Harry toward and up the spiral staircase on their left like he did it every day, probably because he did. When they reached the door, Draco tapped its crystalline knob with his wand and it swung open to grant them access.
"You don't need saving, Malfoy. I do believe that one day people will accept that you've changed or at least that you're trying really hard."
"Yeah".
“Fine, I’ll elaborate. Never have I ever wished to be in a threesome with someone from this table”.
"Morning, Harry", he heard Asteria say. She was busy watering the plants and herbs situated in their kitchen. It left Harry in awe every time he saw her do it, touched by the amount of love she poured into each and every one of their plants. Harry scanned the kitchen area after he'd found the living room empty, not yet ready to admit to himself what he was looking for. "There's coffee in the pot", she stated, shooting him a smile. Harry nodded appreciatively. "I'm sorry, by the way. I didn't know Draco was close enough to hear my remark about him having a crush on you. It was meant to be a joke, darling". She sounded a little embarrassed and Harry had absolutely no clue what to respond, so he didn't. "Seems to be a touchy subject", she added, clearly hoping to get something out of Harry. "Yeah, there's a lot of history between us, you know". "Still, you could have said no to his moving in, yet you didn't. I don't mean to pry, love, I'm sorry". Harry couldn't help but be endeared by her excessive use of endearments. He usually cringed when someone did it as abundantly as she did, but somehow didn't mind at all. "It's fine. i just don't know how to put it in words".
They hadn’t gone very far, and Harry was just pondering how to word his question about the weird magic something that’d just happened, when the snappy sound of Draco’s footsteps abruptly halted.
He caught a betraying snicker from the man beneath him and Harry smirked tiredly, his cheek squashed into the sweat-damp fabric of Draco’s shirt where it rode up on his back.
“Of course you would when it’s entirely focused on having your cock in my arse all day.”
In heels, Ginny nearly had to lean down a bit to press a short kiss to Harry’s cheek, shooting one last look of confusion in Malfoy’s direction.
With a badly stifled moan he pressed back on the bricks to keep himself upright, and then Draco started teasing with the edge of his teeth, and it was too fucking good.
It was getting toward evening by then, and Harry supposed they ought to head back to his house—if they were going.
Harry looked at him bewildered, and Draco shrugged.
“You’re fucking incredible at kissing. I’ve hardly slept this week,” Harry admitted. “I’m barely conscious, honestly.”
Harry choked slightly on his tea.
Harry had expected it to feel strange, maybe even uncomfortable, and instead—
Harry had already forgotten. Draco was very distracting—and he had Harry’s wand now, arching an eyebrow as he twirled it gracefully in his fingers.
He thought he saw an imperceptible flinch cross Malfoy’s face then, but he couldn’t really be sure—and had been trying not to stare overly long at him for most of the afternoon anyway.
Undeniably they’d made a mess of each other last night.
let’s move on.”
“I dunno, Harry. If it were me I might just lamp him and be done with it. Screw the bloody community service, rehabilitation nonsense. He’s always been fully rotten
“Right, thank you. We’re very excited.” A slight exaggeration, nervous being the more overwhelming feeling when Harry spent any prolonged period of time thinking about his impending marriage.
“Well?”
After taking time to rest, Draco summoned some sandwiches and they ate quite quickly in the kitchen of the same tent they’d been resting in.
“And I’m meant to pretend you didn’t just imply you give a toss whether or not I’m attractive?”
It took him longer than it should’ve to formulate a response that was just as aloof and impersonal as the one Malfoy had sent—or as close as Harry could manage.
He whispered a spell to undo the buttons, and took his time sliding in his hand to squeeze at Draco’s cock. Draco tipped his head back onto Harry’s shoulder with a hitched sigh.
Harry snorted. “I’ll sort it later. D’you think that was your magic or mine?”
It felt an odd thing to do, especially as he was still dreaming about him on a semi-regular basis. Far too often, he found himself revisiting what Malfoy had said about the way Harry looked at him—and when he did, his mind’s eye produced a pair of silver eyes, sparked with challenge.
“I wasn’t.. Thank you, Draco. This means a lot”
Even though Harry had rushed to get to the pub on time this Saturday, he arrived when the whole table was already invested in a highly inebriated round of Never Have I Ever, or so it seemed. There were several emptied shot glasses all over the table and Seamus was laughing so hard Harry feared he might pass out. “Oi, Harry! Come sit down! Hope you’ve got a few good questions ready, we’re running out of ‘em”, Dean half-shouted, clearly as drunk as his still laughing boyfriend. Again, Harry was seated next to Seamus and the wall, and again, Draco was sitting across from Dean, so enough space for him to breathe normally. Or so he thought. “I’ve got a good one! Never have I ever fancied someone who is in a relationship. Or was, at that point”, Luna said all excited. Several people drank. Harry didn’t. Draco did. Interesting.
I brought you? Fuck, I was so embarrassed afterwards because I thought it was too much. And to be honest, I was a little disappointed that you didn’t tell me you were giving the position to Ron. So I thought…”, Draco stopped talking then. Harry got up and put a hand on Draco’s waist, now wearing that same soft smile. “I’m sorry I didn’t tell you”, he muttered, “Do you need me to explain everything from my perspective before or after I kiss you?”
He was leaning against the facade, away from the other small groups gathered outside. The music from inside was still audible, the air reeked of cigarette smoke. Draco looked lost in thought, so Harry cleared his throat to diverge the Blonde’s attention to himself. Draco gave him a perfunctory nod but color had risen to his cheeks. “So, how was the mojito, then?”, Harry asked, emboldened by Draco’s taciturnity. “It was fine, thanks”, Draco said, not looking at him. This was odd. Draco still wasn’t looking at him. Had Harry misinterpreted the blonde’s preceding attitude towards him?
“Where are you going?”, Harry asked. If he was covering her shift, he might as well know for what cause.
. And something in his heart told him that Malfoy might have the same problem he had.
“Zabini, you’ve come up with this ridiculous idea, do us the honor and start.”, Hermione suggested after noticing that most of her housemates seemed a little overwhelmed at the prospect of playing a new game, including Harry and Ron. With the right amount of firewhiskey intus they behaved, quite frankly, a little daft from time to time. Although Harry was wearing a different look on his face tonight, a look Hermione could not entirely make out.
"You expect me to believe that spoiled 11 year old Draco would love to go vegan and eat chocolate with his rival, counting stars?"
“Don’t leave us hanging, Granger. How does it work?”, Pansy asked, leaning forward in interest. “Before I do, I’d like to see some more people try”, she declared, smiling almost in a mischievous fashion. Draco was surprised, hell, even a little intrigued with Granger’s sudden Slytherin-behaviour. “It’s my turn to pick someone”, Ron half-stated, making it sound like a question.
“You mean a baby shower?”
“Fuck, that’s what you focused on?”, Draco laughed. It felt bloody amazing, knowing that he was able to make Draco laugh like that.
"So he hasn't hexed you, then?"
The group quickly grew bored from this game that they had been playing for months now, so they launched into private conversations again. Harry was talking to Dean and Seamus about their plan of moving in together. Seamus told him about a small flat outside of London, while Dean had his hand on his boyfriend’s thigh. This casual touch made Harry ache a little, but that was okay.
“Is this man bothering you,
The following days were hell. Added to his feeling of confusion was now the feeling of betrayal, and worse, the feeling of being played. Had it all been a challenge to Malfoy, a game? Had he only wanted to prove that he could get Harry to fall for him only to leave him dumbfounded and hurt? "You look like a lost puppy, mate. Cheer up! What happened to you anyways?", Francis asked on the third day as he made his way into his flatmate's room only to find he hadn't left the bed yet. Francis opened the curtains to let in some natural light. "I've a headache", Harry mumbled into his pillow. "You should go out, get some air", Francis suggested and sat down at the edge of Harry's mattress. Harry shook his head vehemently. "Imma call Hermione, see if she can help. You're acting weird, mate". Francis made it sound like a warning, as if Hermione was some authority figure he should fear. "No, she's busy with work", Harry protested weakly but couldn't even be bothered to lift his head from the pillow. It was true, his story about the headache. It was pounding and utterly abominable, yet he barely noticed it underneath all the questions swirling around in his head.
. Judging by his hysterical coughing induced by either Harry or white wine down the wrong tube (or both), Malfoy was as shocked to see Harry as he felt seeing the blonde all relaxed and unperturbed in his kitchen. Malfoy had never been relaxed. In their time spent at Hogwarts, Malfoy had always looked fucking frantic, at least in their last three years.
His eyes, oh his eyes, one of the many things about Malfoy Harry simply could not resist, were devouring Harry. Not thinking it possible, their elaborate staring-contest intensified when Harry saw Malfoy lick his lip slowly, indulging into the act. What he would do to taste those lips-
“We should have played that game months ago, would have spared me a lot of pining”, Harry laughed, catching his breath.
The next few days, Harry spent silently cheering on Ron when he was giving out orders in the mornings with feigned confidence that had evolved into real one in the span of two successful days. It was great to see his friend thrive at something he was so passionate about and Harry admired Ron for having that spark in his eye whenever they were able to close a case, even if it was just a small one.
Harry couldn't believe what he was hearing. He had interpreted Draco's look earlier as slight judgment and now his stomach made an unbearable turn.
“It’s special effects right? That’s how Muggles call them?”, Draco asked. “Right, yeah. Well, how about
Slowly, he parted his lips, not daring to open his eyes, now or ever- staying here in this very moment forever sounded just fine. Hoping that his parting of lips would be interpreted as consent, he moved his head slightly forward, when soft, hot lips met his and everything seemed to explode. Harry hungrily met the pair of lips and brought his right hand to Draco’s hair, seemingly burying it in the soft, blonde hair that he had resented for so long. He wanted to open his mouth even more, give away his all but he pulled back for a second.
He tried to recall what the misunderstanding had been about, but the general feeling of a constant undulation of his heart surpassed that rationality. He would just have to wait for Tuesday evening.
“Wait- What?”

“Salazar, the queue for the gents was
"You can stay on the sofa for tonight, mate", Francis offered. Him calling Draco his "mate" made Harry's head hurt even more. He'd developed a head-ache in the last five minutes. Understandably, he told himself. "Alright, I'm going back to sleep", Harry announced, half to himself, half to Francis who was carrying a duvet and a light blue pillow towards Malfoy who was busy throwing magazines and vinyls off the sofa, looking composed but Harry spotted a hint of sheer panic in the blonde's eyes. Harry had always guessed that Malfoy was a tidy person, but having it proven was oddly satisfying to him.
After contemplating his options, Harry chose to leave his room in order to get Francis not to call Hermione. Not that he didn't want to see her, though. He just really did not have the slightest clue of what to say and lying wasn't an option since she was able to see through him at any point. His head was aching more than before and his vision almost faded from all the sleeping. He poured himself a glass of cold water and sat down next to Francis who was watching a TV-show on one of their three channels. No-one in their flat could be bothered to try to access more than these three but as far as Harry was concerned, they sufficed. "Hey, enough with the long face! Come on", Francis complained amicably. He soon understood that he would not get anything out of Harry and just scooched a little closer and laid a protective arm around Harry. As a response, Harry laid his head on his friend's shoulder.
"I meant the balcony".
This waiting that Harry had been veiling as simple tedium throughout the day had earned him a myriad of strange looks from Asteria,who was used to Harry being a little calmer, was progressively turning into giddiness as the hours passed. "I'm going for a walk", he announced to no-one in particular and he began to cuddle himself into a thick woolen scarf that Molly had given him for Christmas last year and pulled a beanie over his head. It was colder that day, much colder than the days before and he could practically feel the people outside anticipating the transformation from autumn to winter. Harry had never really minded the cold, yet he did not want to catch a cold, either. He'd found himself shivering all day long, more so when he was thinking about last night and had tried to comfort these outbursts with a soothing tea only to find out that even this beloved antidote of his did not help his current state, either.
It was also clear to Harry that Draco was really enjoying mercilessly torturing himself on Harry’s cock—in that he would seem to find just the right spot, press Harry in hard, and rock with his hips until Harry could feel him tensing all over.
“That’s not making it hurt any less. And also not an apology.”
“Er. I could show you instead?”
“Alright, you?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco shoved him by the shoulder into the corridor wall and Harry only laughed at him in a smug sort of way—and caught him around the middle from behind.
“Sort of hot,” Harry murmured against his ear and felt Draco’s fleeting shiver in response.
Harry was immediately uncomfortably hard. “Draco, fuck. You don’t have to—”
“Are you quite sure?” he checked sardonically.
“Alright then…untwist your knickers.”
“I’m not a pet, Malfoy.”
Blaise muttered something inaudible, and when Draco arched an eyebrow threateningly, he quickly changed the subject. Sort of.
All of which was conspiring to make him feel like an absolutely shit person, because he was
Harry tried to shake it off.
Suddenly, he wasn’t in a terrible hurry to get up.
“I had considered it.”
She wished them good morning, and they returned the greetings, and then Harry had started to introduce Draco—but Cassie was already beaming at him.
“Harry.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Get up here, then. I’m not coming down there.”
He dropped panted bites at Draco’s ear, struggling to control the urge to rush and fuck him until they both exploded.
Then there was the gnome infestation.
Pulling his gaze from Harry’s, Draco cut right to the heart of the matter.
“You’re certain we don’t have time for a bit of—”
“Fuck me harder, and I’ll come all over your charming little bed again,” Draco drawled throatily, full of lust.
“Have you got a loo?”
Harry agreed to Floo in to the library at Malfoy Manor the next Sunday, the second weekend in July.
“You’ll have to remember to check, it hasn’t got a fancy Muggle light on it.”
“I suppose.”
Harry’s glare was half-hearted at best. He did his utmost to tamp down any embarrassment and instead took a proper drink.
“Nearly.”
“It’s not Dark Magic. It’s…sort of, Muggles,” Harry blurted.
“Sorry. I hadn’t noticed,” Harry lied poorly.
“Oh, shut up,” he snapped, and Harry smirked at him.
“Surely you can’t have destroyed every prophecy the Ministry’s ever collected.”
As he entered through the iron arch he heard the rattle of a doorknob, Draco’s bedroom door opened, and he glanced up to the landing, obviously expecting to see Draco emerge. He was instead stunned to see none other than Blaise Zabini, in a bath towel, shouting across to the open door of Draco’s potions lab on the other side.
Did he really feel that way? Was there something more behind the dismissiveness of his shrug, or was Harry overthinking the whole thing?
Was that a
Harry sat shoulder to shoulder with Ron and Hermione for the early ceremony—and they had not been given a choice to sit anywhere but in the front row.
“Potter. Wake up.”
“You expected any less?”
Draco began at the center of the spiral and Harry went out to the edge and they worked their way through them all, unshrinking then charming each to erect itself.
Still sat square in his lap, Draco’s eyes narrowed suspiciously, but he didn’t press, charming the bottle to pour another careful splash into their glass instead.
“I’ll be fine!” he answered reflexively, and immediately wished for a hole to crawl into, to hide from how badly he was bungling this. He thought he heard Ginny sigh, but it might well have been the wind—even if he knew it probably wasn’t, he wanted to believe it.
“Fucking hell,” Harry breathed to the cloudy London sky.
Shushing him, Draco dove down to kiss him more slowly.
They changed in the bedroom together relatively quickly, if not a bit drowsily, neither of them bothering with shirts.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry took the stairs two at a time, probably not the wisest choice given the spiral went up quite high—but he was pretty excited, and a bit breathless when he reached the top of them.
“One more,” Draco ordered, following a tight breath. “And rub with them.”
“I don’t really have to imagine,” Harry pointed out.
As close as they were now, it became very clear that just the vibration of Harry’s voice alone was causing the body against his to shudder softly.
There was a hungry look in the flickering silver-grey of Draco’s eyes in the firelight, and Harry couldn’t say no to him. However, it was also around then Harry decided this could actually be a bit of fun.
“We’re pretty good at fucking marathons,” Harry taunted cheerily.
He knew she liked to stretch out on the sofa and read the papers when she got home on the weekends.
It occurred to him he ought to brush his teeth then, and he took off up the stairs to the bathroom as Draco’s careful scrawl went on beneath his first message.
“Where
Harry was a touch concerned himself, and it was embarrassing as well. He’d had to apologise, and explain that he hadn’t been sleeping well.
? But—well I guess I
“So noisy, Potter. Think of all the neighbours I don’t have.”
Draco deposited them within a small iron-fenced garden, beneath a rather old looking tree.
Just as he disappeared in a swirl of flames, Harry noticed his own bitemarks still all over Draco’s neck. He hadn’t bothered to heal them.
Glancing back at her, just before he tossed his powder into the flames, Harry frowned in tipsy thought. “He must know that. Maybe… I dunno, maybe that’s part of the problem.”
Savage hummed an affirmative.
Then he just kept them there, fingers tracing lightly over rough fabric.
At least it was a private one.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry frowned. “I know she cares about the people; she’ll want to help.”
He was also slightly sore yet, what with all his activity over the weekend. The longer they stayed in the air he could feel his thighs threatening to cramp where they hugged to his broom.
Harry immediately wrapped his lips around them, brushing with his tongue to taste the bitter salt of Draco’s come on the pads of his fingers, and they moaned together. Irresistible lips soon covered his again as Draco arched to kiss him, and ease slowly off his cock, only breaking the lock of their lips to whisper a couple quiet cleansing charms.
Draco summoned a couple of chairs to the table, then started in charming a selection of notes and books to float over as well. Harry watched the process, sipping his tea, and finishing off a sandwich and a half.
“—but not yet,” Draco finished.
He looked quite vulnerable there in the clouded-over moonlight flooding in through the atrium’s glass—vulnerable in a way he hadn’t been before, even when he was arse-up for Harry and about to come. This was very different—and it was twisting something up in Harry’s chest he was far too intoxicated to reign in or deny.
He needed to pull it together.
In the frantic interplay of their heavy panting, Draco’s broken moan cut through loudly as he released between them in several twitching shots, all over Harry’s front.
Harry shot her a look. “I’m sure. Twat’s pretty unmistakable.”
Even despite the horrors in his dreams, he couldn’t help but to be quite excited that they were getting closer to actually seeing their ideas come to fruition. Draco had said they might only need a few more weeks of practice and refining.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Harry hummed, his hand migrating to circle the proud length of him and stroke as he washed away whatever honey he’d failed to suck off. He let out another low noise of encouragement when Draco caught his cock in a fiercely tight grip, tugging in perfect time to Harry’s hand on him.
“Wait—what’s risky? What about the ICW? What’s that got to do with Malfoy?”
“Er. Thought I’d stop for a chat…but you were asleep, so I picked up a book.”
There was no denying Harry was interested given the faint twitch of his cock—although he had some concerns as to the wisdom of this endeavor, Draco did not appear to have any concerns. Summoning one of the armchairs closer to the center of the carpet, he brought it to a stop right in front of Harry.
“Mother and I’ve had tea with my aunt here once or twice, and I’ve since come on my own as well. They do a brunch with absolutely spectacular crepes.”
That Friday, Harry and Savage started their usual sweeps quite early.
Whatever pretence he might’ve had that this was not actually a date had fled his mind about half-way through the meal. It was far too much like one to deny it, even to himself. They’d shared a bloody dessert.
“I’m not in trouble. I’m trying very hard to stay out of it, actually.”
Harry got a better idea of what all the Protean Charm involved on the casting end of things—for a half hour or so—but as before, when Draco was standing so close to him, guiding Harry’s wand in motion, all his many doubts came rushing back to him.
Harry read for a while longer while they waited on the tea, and Draco charmed a scattered jumble of many notes into a more manageable pile of neatly rolled scrolls.
He waited until Wednesday of that week to send him a short owl with some instructions:
“—Harry,
Some of his classes Harry liked better than others. His Trace Magic class was particularly insightful, and he’d discovered he was pretty competent at the sensing required for the method to work. He’d enjoyed his recent class on memory charms as well. Mind-twisting stuff that, but it was fascinating.
Well, this was fun.
There were other classes he completely dreaded, like Poisons and Antidotes, because he was abysmal at them. He had reached a point mid-June where he very nearly owled Draco for advice on one of his papers, but Harry sorted it out on his own in the end.
“Er, no?”
Harry—that’s enough, fucking
Harry took a deep breath.
“Nice trees about, aren’t there?” Harry remarked.
At the moment, he appeared to be closely considering the fit of the trousers over Harry’s bottom.
“I don’t think it’s hideous.”
“By the way,” he added quickly. “I wanted to say, I do honestly appreciate your helping with this. I know I’ve said it before, but I never expected—”
“Yes, obviously. I need to inspect—”
“Have a little patience. This was your idea.”
They wouldn’t need to have identical interiors, so long as the rooms and furniture were all there, but it would probably be best if his weren’t so obviously clashing. As with their conversations on spellcraft, he felt a bit out of his depth, but he trusted Draco’s judgement so far as it related to taste level. He certainly knew more than Harry did.
Draco’s moans turned desperately demanding, pressing his forehead to the mirror’s surface and gripping the back of the chair to push back on Harry’s mouth harder.
,” Draco murmured, and the chandeliers in the ballroom went out, bathing them both in total darkness.
“How’s the training going then?” Ron inquired.
He sucked gently at them, when he wasn’t teasing all over the sensitive skin with his tongue. As his mouth worked over them, Harry caught Draco’s cock in a tight grip, still somewhat slick from Harry’s mouth, and stroked him roughly.
Draco huffed in utter exasperation. “Will you be sucking my cock any time in the next century, then?”
As requested, Harry retrieved his pyjamas from the floor, and summoned a shirt from his bag. Draco didn’t bother with a shirt, but he retrieved Harry’s glasses from the bathroom sink, turning the rounded frames over in his fingers a moment before he handed them back.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Honestly, I’ll need you to stop being a hopeless altruistic twat now, as it’s ruining my evening.”
A few of the portraits did try to chat him up, one of them was even quite flirty. There were also a fair number of scandalised looks as Harry passed through the corridor—but he supposed that might have something to do with his fashion choices.
When Harry sighed against his lips, Draco let out a softer noise that almost sounded like relief to Harry’s ear. Whatever it was, he liked the sound of it, playing at Draco’s lips with his own in an attempt to encourage more of them.
“Well, what can I help you both with today?”
Harry quirked a faintly amused eyebrow at the commandeering of his wand, but he didn’t question it. It appeared to obey Draco as it did Harry, and Harry had certainly used Draco’s before.
“Potter? Where the fuck’ve you gone? You look fathoms away.”
“Something peach… with—”
“You have some snakes you need to speak with, Malfoy?
Chuckling tiredly, Harry yawned again, and he was giving in.
“Distractions like me shagging you senseless?”
When he returned home, Harry went right for the shower and set it to run almost all cold.
“Fucking Merlin that is dark, Potter. And wrong. I’ve always loved my parents…I’ll grant you I might’ve been happier and more well-adjusted if they hadn’t fallen in with the petrifying snake man…Now could we talk about literally
“I’m really sorry, Gin. I needed some time to myself so I—well I went off for a long walk and sort of…lost track of time. Then er—sort of fell asleep?”
Draco finally pressed down to kiss him, hard and very slowly—swiftly fanning the flames of tension between them. The wet humid sound of it, the hot press of Draco’s tongue and the taste of him was irresistible—and they both drew it out, unable to fight the draw of lips and dance of tongues—
“I take it you aren’t considering the finer points of the meeting we’re about to have?”
He pushed in deeper yet and they moaned together in mutual desire. A hard shudder foreshadowing the abrupt spurt of bitter heat into Harry’s throat, lust-darkened green shifted to watch the part of Draco’s lips around a breathless cry.
Harry’s self-control would not last hours, and he knew it—yet he found himself following suit, hanging up his robes as Malfoy had done, and settling into a sitting position beside him on the grass. Hesitantly, Harry removed his glasses, and slowly lowered himself down to lie on the forest floor beside his former rival.
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
His head swam with a fading fog of whisky, but the ferocity of heat Draco was fueling all through him was wearing at the edges of his buzz, and bringing the absolute perfection of the man beneath him into incredibly hot, vivid clarity. He couldn’t stop looking into the dark dilation of black on silver—couldn’t stop watching the part of Draco’s lips when he gasped and the long stretch of his throat near-begging Harry to bite it when Draco tossed his head back to moan.
“See you around, Potter.”
When Draco finally let him up, Harry was the one reluctant to move—but he did.
“Harry, can I speak with you a moment?” Hermione was frowning thoughtfully at him.
“How is Ronald.”
They made it once to dinner at the same time, and Harry and Ginny had sat with them at the end of the table, but there were so many conversations happening at once, they’d barely spoken to each other at all.
Huffing a laugh, Harry felt caught in the relentless tug of sleep, and for several long beats there was only the perfectly soothing sounds of their tired breathing.
“Goodnight,” Draco threw out offhandedly, already back to scanning his book, and apparently not intending to put any clothes on any time soon.
“If you want them to be generally uniform, then yes, and it’s going to take rather a lot of practice, I think.”
“You could do with a lesson or two,” Draco drawled with understated disinterest. “We can start today—you’ll need it where we’re going.”
found him standing in the Ministry’s atrium in mildly uncomfortable dress robes yet again.
The sleep was deep enough he didn't notice Malfoy leave, and only woke when Ginny shook him to consciousness well into the night.
“If he wanted to hurt me, he could have done it ages ago.” He ignored their looks of faint horror and went on. “As I said, none of it was even his idea—it was all mine. I know what I’m doing.”
Harry sucked a nipped kiss to the curve of his neck, and went on nipping steadily harder, until he’d coaxed out Draco’s quiet moan.
He didn’t mind too much, and he was a good enough flyer to pull it off, but Harry occasionally missed the solitary nature of the Snitch hunt—all the focus required to block out the chaos of a game, pinpointing his target quickly and efficiently before the other Seeker could. On some sleepless nights he’d considered sneaking up to the orchard alone to chase a Snitch through the dark—but he’d only done it once or twice, and found himself often too busy to entertain the idea in daylight hours.
He spent all of his Saturday morning and most of the afternoon practising and reviewing Draco’s spells. It was actually going fairly well, he thought. He didn’t have the space to set up a tent to check, but he was developing a better understanding of patterns, and the long ritual of the casting was starting to become muscle memory—usually a sign he was well on his way toward mastering a spell.
“I feel like I need a shower after this bath,” he mused dazedly.
Blinking at the simplicity of the statement, Harry wasn’t about to disagree. However—
In fact, the room was almost all mirrors, and disconcertingly it reminded Harry of a carousel, only without all the painted horses and lions and such. The mirrors were edged in ornamental gilt carving, and three twinkling chandeliers cast a warm glow, echoed back in an infinity of reflections all around them.
Draco blinked at him with an odd look of panic. It took a beat for Harry to sort out why.
“Of course I’ve fucking tried. I tried a lot after I heard you could.”
Harry spends his Sunday morning at Malfoy Manor, and also a bit of his Tuesday evening.
“HELLO! MR. POTTER! Might I have just a quick word with you? I’m from the Chocolate Frog Company, and we’re in the process of designing our
Scoffing a disbelieving laugh, Draco spun a larger plate and murmured a few lines of quiet Latin as an array of neatly-chopped vegetables arranged themselves. With a few more precise wand-waves, he enchanted the same plate under a shimmering dome of translucent orange magic.
He spent his Monday off with her, and they’d had tea in their tiny back garden. Harry had talked with her about her upcoming final games of the season, what players they were looking at for next year, and how excited she was to be home more often over the summer.
“The trousers are too tight.”
Harry had been up against the painful edge of arousal for a while now, but he fucked Draco as thoroughly as he could—grabbing at the arched curve of his back to help pull him harder onto the swell of his cock.
After they finished eating, he finally got around to volunteering to go home.
As he wandered through the long stone corridors, past the many snoozing portraits of Draco’s platinum-haired ancestors, it took Harry an embarrassingly long time to find the large atrium with the upper levels, where Draco’s bedroom was located.

“No hands below the waist—mine or yours—and I’ll allow it.”
“Shrunk down in here.”
On the other hand combining them with the Dementors tell-tale cold became indication enough they were on the right track.
“What’s all this? I thought it was going to be something magic.”
That Tuesday would mark the two-year anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts and—if it were anything like the last—it would be something of a memorial and a wake, all in one.
Closing the door to the round room behind them, both men now knew to close their eyes as the room spun all around. When it had stopped, Harry nodded toward the door opposite them.
When they had finished eating, and Draco enchanted the dishes to do themselves, they returned to the library.
Harry was trying to counterbalance him past the strong burst of heat it was sending all through him, suddenly so much closer to climax.
“What are you doing here? I really don’t have a lot of time, I’m fully backed up on my reports after last week, and I can’t—"
Only now, almost two years on, were the trials even finally beginning to wind down. Harry’d had to testify at far more of those than he would’ve liked, but sensing how vital they seemed to everyone’s ability to move on, it had felt like a responsibility he couldn’t shirk, even if they hadn’t legally required him to participate.
“That’s quite clever,” Harry admitted, with a bit of soft smile.
“Right. See you later then, Malfoy. Thanks again.”
Just at the end of the corridor, a low balcony overlooked the neatly tended grounds of the manor house, which Harry could only assume belonged to either the Waddell or Lester family. The balcony’s tall glass doors had been thrown open, allowing in a cooling night breeze, and several long splashes of bright moonglow.
“You’re lucky she interrupted when she did.”
Harry sighed, nudging back.
It took them several panted minutes leaning on the wall through the curtain before they had the energy to get on with the washing they’d deviated from—yet still they hadn't entirely stopped kissing.
“Draco…”
“You have company or something?”
“You won’t if you stop overfilling your spoon. Honestly.”
“One of your suggestions seems somewhat less essential than the other,” Draco pointed out wryly, but he was also pressing closer. “How long is this all going take?”
he’d said that night at the ball was a shock, given he was not generally well known for his charitable nature, most especially when it came to Muggles.
That night he fell asleep on the settee with his book on patterns, and slept through most of the night—though not all of it. By about three-thirty he’d woken from another dream he couldn’t remember, just on the periphery of knowing but still too far to grasp it.
“Yes, lovely trees,” Draco drawled sardonically.
“And here I was planning to take out an ad in the papers.”
“Fair,” Harry answered quietly, and felt it curiously natural to curl his arms around Draco, pulling him back more securely. Fighting off an impulse to nuzzle into the soft hair tickling his cheek, his heartbeat thumped so loudly in his ears then that he was sure Draco could feel it, just as he could feel the nervous shift in Draco’s breathing.
“Scarhead? You’re bringing that back?”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
“Oh.”
“It sort of… came up in conversation. ‘Suppose I thought it couldn’t do any real harm to ask. It was all my idea really; he’s just offered to do some of the research. Said he liked the challenge of it, I don’t know.”
“If I’d known you were going to be such a bore, I would’ve come alone. Didn’t they give you an office or somesuch? You can show that off, if it will make you feel better.”
“Not sure I’d be very good at designing cards.” Harry was trying to make a joke, but it clearly did not translate.
“Say it again.”
Malfoy snickered beside him. “If that is what the potion seems to be telling you… who am I to argue?”
In the space of a heartbeat Harry came with jolting thrusts and a tight groan—entirely lost in Draco and heat for the duration, before he gently lowered himself into collapsing atop him.
Harry frowned. He needed some space; the whole day was becoming a bit too much for him.
Even before they’d made it through the doors, the stark contrast between where they’d just been and where they now stood waiting for a table was jarring, to say the least, and only grew more so when they finally got inside. At just after two in the afternoon it was well past any sort of lunch rush, yet the restaurant remained packed full with people in posh clothes, who obviously had nothing better to do on a Friday afternoon than indulge in wine and expensive French cuisine.
Probably he should’ve considered the likelihood this would happen, but there wasn’t time to berate himself about it now. Without thinking twice about it he interlinked their fingers tightly to pull Draco out of the alley, down another long narrow road.
“Worth waiting for?” Harry murmured tiredly.
“I’m afraid to ask.”
“Oh, alright. Have a good afternoon then…and I’ll keep a look out for the light!”
When Harry quirked a half-smile, some of the tension in Draco’s shoulders visibly relaxed.
“Perhaps,” Malfoy conceded.
It sparked heat like lightning right to his cock, and he moaned deeply. “
It was difficult to modify the existing structure once it was all cast as one spell. If there were any major problems, they would have to start all over again—which they’d already had to do once, when one of Harry’s bathrooms had come out with no shower. He wouldn’t be making that mistake again.
“No one taught me calligraphy, Potter. I taught myself.”
“You’ve been here before?”

. Harry had the time to wonder how he was expected to go about this before Draco lifted his hips and wordlessly guided his hand down between them, finally pressing far smoother lips more firmly to the well-bitten swell of Harry’s.
"I don't know, Malfoy.” Harry felt very tired all of a sudden. “Hermione’s completely absorbed in her Centaur Rights cases now. Ron’s busy too, with the shop, I almost never see him… Surely you must be getting bored stuck in that dusty Manor with all your books and alchemy bollocks."
“If you’d made the same soup twenty times, you’d’ve perfected it too.”
“Westminster’s latest shelter, I imagine. Just ‘round the corner there, probably giving out breakfast or somesuch.”
“Potter.”
Malfoy arched an eyebrow. “A handbag, how thrilling. Let me get on with it then.”
“Fuck’s sake, Potter,” Malfoy expelled in some strange mix of disgust and amusement. “Nevermind—only sit down before you fall down.”
“Shut up,” Draco muttered, nipping at his lower lip with the same gentle sharpness he’d used on his balls. “I know.”
🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪 🙪
Draco looked at him with wry amusement. “Pick a tent, Potter. There’s beds in all of them.”
Harry snorted tiredly.
“The water enchantments and a lot of the protective charms will need refreshing regularly as well, so we’ll have to sort it out either way.”
Harry smirked a little awkwardly sliding them back on, and Draco scoffed a pretentious sort of laugh, flicking at his lightning scar before he was slipping out the bathroom doorway.
As the day approached, he found himself increasingly wracked with annoying bouts of nerves and concerns over his own abilities to show restraint. On the other hand, it would also be a perfect opportunity to dig into his spells practice—with so much free time in the evenings after work, he was sure to get a lot more accomplished.
“Did you do anything interesting for your birthday?” Draco questioned idly from where he lay sprawled just behind him.
“You alright?” Harry whispered, sure he might’ve blacked out for a second, but not so far gone he didn’t realise he might’ve hurt Draco slamming into him so hard against such an unmoving surface.
“Oh no,” Harry teased slightly, though his mouth was partially full and it came out rather muffled.
“What’s this here?” Draco was pointing to a spot in Harry’s notes that was particularly messy.
“As it is your birthday, I suppose I’ll indulge you,” Draco drawled in a hushed voice.
Draco growled a frustrated noise and bit into the soft skin just above his nipple, and Harry hissed in a tight breath at the spike of pain. Caught under an impatient mouth, he only wanted more.
