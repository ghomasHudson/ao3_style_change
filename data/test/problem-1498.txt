"I wouldn't dream of it. That's gross, Potter." He wrinkled his nose in disgust. "Now that you finally can eat, this is what you want?"
"I've asked him already and he was glad to help, but," Harry blushed a little, "since he and Hannah are trying to get pregnant on their own, it turned out to be a bit awkward, to say the least. In the end he had to say no, for her sake."
"I think I'm going to be sick," Malfoy said, his voice was strained and muffled. There was a loud scraping of chairs and a retching sound close to the door.
"Sure, that's fantastic for you, Gin. Lily and I'll be alright." Harry put the spagetti in the pot of boiling water. He liked to cook the Muggle way. It was familiar and he could lose himself in the calming monotomy of chopping and stirring. It helped him relax.
"Harry?" she called out and hauled the heavy velvet aside. A whoosh of the cold Scottish autumn-air swept in from the dark dorm-room.
"I brought some food," he continued while he took out a pie, bread and all kinds of stuff and placed them on Harry's coffee table. "There's some chocolate fudge here that is to die for when you're in a gloomy mood. My house-elf Pipsey made them for you." He opened a box and retrieved something round covered in cocoa between his forefinger and thumb and put it to Harry's lips. Harry automatically gaped and as the rich taste exploded in his mouth he slipped a small keening sound.
Harry drew a shivering breath as he looked at the blond man and his neat appearance, his perfectly clad body. "You know, Malfoy, you look exactly tha same as you used to, but how you talk and what you do, it's like you're a totally different person."
Adam inspected Harry up and down. "I can see that. Come, let's get you out of those horrid rags and see what we have to work with." He steered Harry towards a changing booth and pulled the curtain.
The boxes were packed and wrapped, and even Harry's old school trunk stood ready to be removed on the floor of Harry's living room. It was an embarrassingly small amount he wanted to bring with him to his new start. Sad as it was, most of his things and furniture were crap and only reminded him of his bleak and lonely life. It felt strange to think that it was only a little more than a year ago he sat here and sweated over the note he had sent to Draco. The note that had changed everything.
It took another two days until there suddenly was a furtive knock on the front door to Grimmauld Place. Harry flung it open.
"Alright," I replied, almost choking of the hoarseness in my throat. "But it's not easy, you know, when you sing every word I've ever felt or thought about you." I don't know what possessed me to say that to him, and I felt my ears redden in embarrassment.
Malfoy gave a short humouless laugh. "You see, I'm all that's left of our once so glorious Slytherin gang." There was a strained set at his jaw.
"As what? Some permanent house-guest?" Harry winced at the thought, as a cold grip encircled his heart.
"What's this?" Malfoy asked. He looked suspiciously at the glossy cover with its un-moving Muggle pictures.
"Now, all you have to do is to fix this bloody mess you've made, apologize to the whole world, including Malfoy, and win him back." George rolled his eyes. "Good luck to you."
At first glance the room was rather small and empty. There was no window nor any light other than what spilled in from the open door. Malfoy closed it and lit a couple of floating candles high up at the ceiling. When Harry got used to the gloom, he could see a small plain wooden table, a chair, a low bench and some shelves on the wall, that also seemed to be empty. He turned to Malfoy with a puzzled look on his face.
With one swift move, Malfoy shoved him around and made him bend over on the top of the desk. He kicked his feet to make his legs spread a little wider and continued to work his finger inside Harry's puckered hole. Harry yelped. He shivered. He moaned. He felt the tight ring of muscles relax and his body push backwards to meet Malfoy's eager hand. Harry heard him laugh, "Oh, Potter." Malfoy pushed in another finger and Harry let out a load groan, as Malfoy scissored his fingers to strech him wider, and Harry could feel his ragged breath aong his neck. Harry whimpered, as his head was spinning and his heart was doing crazy twirls in his chest.
Harry sat and tried to collect his thought and feelings. This wasn't going to be easy and Malfoy didn't exactly help.
"After all the time we've spent together... I just want more, Harry." He shifted towards Harry, but didn't move forward.
"She says you're working a lot of overtime," he went on a little more tentatively. "I work at that department too, you know."
Hermione hugged him and tousled his raven black hair a bit. "I think we all could use some sleep now."
Like the night before, they lay facing eachother in the weak light, silent, but in a comfortable silent. After a long while, Draco said, "I can't talk about the war. I'm not sure I ever can."
"I'm sorry, I'm really, really sorry. I'm such an idiot," he gasped when Malfoy entered the kitchen. "I made us tuna-sandwiches, which I happen to like, and I
"We knew it was a bloke. Harry told Hermione and me right after New year's, and that it's been going on for a while. But he refused to tell us who. It had to be someone at Hogwarts, and my first guess was you."
Harry squirmed. Malfoy was right, he'd made a scene after their last encounter. He had yelled and threatened, all because guilt and shame had ripped through him as he came down from the high. He had sworn he'd never set foot there again.
Harry tried, he really tried, to keep his attention to his friends and his girlfriend, but he couldn't stop his eyes from drifting over to see what the Slytherin was doing. Right now, he had his fingers in Parkinson's hair, playing with it, pulling it up to his lips. His grey eyes met Harry's and he flicked his tongue out to moisten his lips. Those lips. Those pink lush lips... Malfoy turned back to the girl beside him and started to kiss and lick her throat and neck. She screeched and giggled loudly, and smacked him on the head. "Stop that, you spoiled prat, it tickles!" He lifted his head and looked over at Harry again, with a wide smirk across his face. Harry heard Zabini's loud laughter and felt his inside boil. That son of a bitch! He hurridly turned his attention to his Butterbeer in front of him. A moment later a distant shuffle made him threw a glance at the door, and as Malfoy stopped, with his hand on the handle, he made a small beckoning movement with his shoulders and neck before he walked outside.
"I never intended to be only a Mum, a little house-wife," she said. "You know that. I want to play, it's what I'm good at."
"Of course, I didn't. What straight man in his right mind would do such a thing? I did it because of the baby, which I
In two swift strides Blaise was at her side. "Salazar's saggy tits, Pansy, what was that all about?"
"I'm sorry to hear that." It struck Harry that Malfoy must be very lonley. He lifted his glass. "Time to drink, then," he said.
"Why didn't you tell me about the syringe, then?" Malfoy peered at him with a small knot between the brows.
Neville sucked in air between his teeth in a reversed sort of gasp. "Blimey, I think you might be right."
"Well, maybe you should." She cupped both of her hands on his cheeks and made him look at her. "Harry, I know things between us haven't been great, and maybe we both can use a break, now that school's over." She bit her lip. "I've often felt there were something missing when we've, you know… Perhaps this is what's been wrong. You always have your eyes on him, do you know that?"
"I try to... you know, not... let it get out of hand, but the truth is, I kind of like it. It makes me feel comfortable, at ease, safe in my own body." Harry sighed. "Ginny hated it, hated what I had become, was embarrassed about it. She couldn't understand. She stopped touching me a long time before Lily was born."
"What about... cocks?" Harry's hand was shaking but he moved it anyway and put it ever so lightly over Malfoy's crotch. He could feel Malfoy swell under the fabric and push against him.
They didn't part well when they finally decided to let go. When the rows over trivial things got out of hand, developed out of its proportions and became unbearable for both of them. When shouting over toothpaste was easier than talking about the things that really hurt.
Malfoy placed the wand on the table and walked up to Harry, put his hands on Harry's upper-arms and turned him. Harry could feel the heat of his breath at the nape of his neck when Malfoy chuckled softly. "That's where you're wrong, pet. In here I have everything I need right now. Tonight, it's my turn to indulge."
I guess that's how I got myself a boyfriend. He's a snarky self-indulgent pain in the arse and I'm totally crazy about him. It feels as if I can make it my lifelong mission to piss him off on a regular basis. So much for options and opportunities. Not that I mind. We're very happy together.
Harry stood and stared out into the empty room where the elf was a second ago. He would try to make this work, he had to. He had to get Draco back in his life again. Not only for the baby, he felt confident enough to care for his child alone, as he once planned it, a long time ago. No, for himself. He needed Draco, craved him, like he never craved anyone before. He must have been in his system for years without Harry noticing. Suddenly everything became so clear.
Malfoy's face transformed; it was like a sunrise over a misty meadow. "I have the most beautiful little boy," he said, smiling. He reached out and grabbed the spoon from Harry's hand. "Give me that pie instead of trying to stab it to death." He took a piece. "I have to get back to work, and so do you, I suppose," he said chewing.
Hermione pursed her lips. "I'm actually surprised you haven't heard of this before, Ron, since you're from a wizard family. I thought most Pure-bloods grew up with this story."
Harry braced himself to a doorframe and held his head down for a moment. Someone came up beside him, and he knew exactly who it was merely by looking at the shoes. No Auror had shoes like that, slim, handcrafted in shiny black leather with just a tad of heel.
"Good, huh?" Malfoy smiled. "She always makes them for me when I'm sad. Pipsey, she's Dobby's sister, by the way, was very insistent that I'd tell '
"Not a bit," Harry grinned. Then he frowned, "I'm really sorry about your nose. I'm not sure it's broken, though. Does it still hurt?"
I know I've been tampering a bit with the birthyears of Ron's and Hermione's children, Rose and Hugo, but it suited my story better this way, and hey; it's a fan-fic!
A crack and the ugliest living thing Harry knew stood in the kitchen. "Master called for Kracher," he said and preformed a low ingratiating bow. He still had the fake gold locket around his neck and it dangled in front of him as he bent. Then his head flew up, and with wide astonished eyes, he croaked, "Master!"
Harry drew three steadying breaths before blurting out. "Years ago, I took some sort of potion, and I think… you might be my soulmate."
Harry rolled his eyes. "Having a child means something to me too, thankyouverymuch. It's not something that comes un-noticed, you know."
"I'm sorry to have awaken you, Arthur," McGonagall said and crouched down on the floor. "No, no, everyone's all right, but we have a little situation here. Can I speak to Molly, please?"
Years of training in how not to show weakness kicked in. First at home with his father, later in Slytherin House, where your position as a leader could be overturned by a blink of an eye, and finally, staying under the same roof as the Dark Lord and his horrendous snake had made him an expert. He evened out his breathing and willed his heart to slow down. He forced himself to collect his thoughts and memories, but this time, it was no use. A tremor shook him and to his embarrassment he could feel a sweat break on his back.
Neville shook his head. "Thanks, but I have students to attend to. There's probably a lot of upset children here, and as I am the Head of Gryffindor…" His cheeks flushed pink, but he shone with pride.
The three students that entered were no strangers. The ones returning to re-do their last year were not children anymore, they were of age almost adults. She still treated them with the same firm motherly spirit, though, and they seemed to find that reassuring.
Malfoy cocked his head and studied Harry silently for a while. "Ever played with magnets, Potter?" His voice contained an amused tone.
Ron had to decline. Hugo had gotten a rash that maybe could be Dragon-pox, and Hermione had a late last-minute mysterious meeting with some of the Unspeakables about a case she was building.
Harry opened a door. "This is where I plan will be the baby's room." It was bigger than the one he'd chosen for himself, but he liked to sleep where he once had stayed with Ron when the house was Headquarter for the Order.
Harry let his breath out in one relaxing sigh and allowed the potion to work in his system. Sleep, he only wanted to sleep and not to think for a long time again.
"Hello, Molly," Harry squeezed her in return and nuzzled his face in the red hair that now was dusted with greys and always smelled of vanilla and lavender. "Merry Christmas. Has anyone arrived yet?"
She walked away, back to the castle, her slim back very straight and her red ponytail bouncing at every step. Harry followed her with his eyes until she was gone. Then he turned and walked towards the lake.
Potter shook his head. "Oh no, nothing like that. Not after the alley. You were really drunk and fell asleep as soon as we got home." He gave a stifled laugh and wiped his face with his hands. Draco realized it was the first time he'd truly seen him without the glasses obscuring his eyes. Except for that time when his face was all swollen.
Hermione entangled herself from Ron's squid-like embrace and pulled her wand out from under the pillow and dissolved the spells. A quick look at her wristwatch told her it was 3 am.
And Potter gave as good as he got. He withdrew a second from Draco's fierce kisses and ripped the glasses from his face and threw them aside, before he dove right back again, kissing and biting Draco's lips, starting over the battle of their tongues. His hot hands roamed the sides of Draco's body, pinching and caressing on their way down. At the top of Draco's trousers, he slipped a finger inside and followed the waistband to the front, but there he lost his patience.
After yet another wave of contractions had subsided, Harry looked around the empty room. The flat was barren except for the boxes and the shelf above the fireplace, where the jar still stood. He came to his feet and managed to grab a pinch before he sunk down on his knees on the floor.
Now Draco was truly afraid. With trembling hands he opened the letter. It was clearly written in haste, but with his mother's distinct handwriting.
But when he was left alone with her and saw how messy she was, he more than doubted his ability to handle a small child. On a whim, he tried the only way he knew from his own upbringing. "Kreacher!"
We all hugged her and assured her that we were perfectly all right with it. The Ravenclaw-girls welcomed her to their dorm and planned her move right away.
Harry swallowed. "For one, you're Draco Malfoy. I'm afraid you'd make me feel like an awkward first-year and mock me and make fun of my shortcomings."
"When you close your eyes and picture yourself in the future, what do you see? Let yourself drift and tell me the first things that comes to mind." Healer Hestia Donner pushed her pink glasses up on her nose with a brightly varnished fingernail and peered down on her patient laying sprawled out on the couch, his unruly black hair fanning out like a dark halo.
Well, that's it. I lived with this story so long now that it feels a little sad that I finally finished it. I hope you enjoyed it to the end.
"Justin, Terry, Michael and Anthony," Ron said, "all very nice guys, but half-bloods or Muggle-decendants, all of them. Ernie MacMillan's pureblood, but last I heard, he was somewhere in America." He sighed and scratched his red hair. "You can't think of anyone you've made friends with in the Auror-corps, I suppose?"
was totally out of the question, so my parents arranged a marriage for me that was based on the mutual interests of blood-lines, connections and wealth. And I had no reason to disagree with them."
Draco locked Harry's eyes with his piercing grey and shook his head. "I can bitterly understand that." He chewed nervously on his lower lip, but straightened up and his voice became very formal. "Harry," he said, " I'm so sorry for what I did. I can assure you that nothing in your behaviour towards me gave me any reason to think that what I did was in any way desired by you too." He held up his hands to stop Harry from interrupting. "I'm so sorry," Draco continueed, much lower, "but with the risk of making a complete fool of myself here, and this is so un-Slytherin of me that I almost combust, I have to tell you. You have to know, that this wasn't some alcohol-indused lust. I'm in love with you. I've been in love with you for ages."
per se, he only found it a bit strange, that's all. Could it be because Malfoy was gay and Harry not? Back in his mind, though, the thought lurked that he found this too pleasurable. But he pushed those thoughts back again and concentrated on the baby that hopefully would be conceived tonight. That, and the way Malfoy's dick filled him up and how he was about to come just as hard and mind-blowing as the other times.
"That didn't stop you from doing all that other stuff, though," Harry jabbed his finger at him. "Poisoning my best friend, letting Death Eaters into our school, almost killing the most important wizard in the fight against Voldemort."
"Potter." Harry heard an unfamiliar drawl and turned to the three men that entered the hall. The darkskinned man at Draco's side extended his hand. "How in Salazar's name were you able to Apparate directly into the house? I thought the wards around this place were impenetrable."
"Yes, it is. I can't believe how fast time flies." He grinned at Draco. "It feels like yesterday when we stepped off that train. Everything magical was new to me."
"You can get dressed again," Healer Towler said, and the light-blue projection disappeared with a pop. "Make another appointment with the Medi-witch outside, about three weeks from now. I'm sure she can fit you in some time right after Christmas. We like to monitor magical pregnancies more frequently than ordinary ones, but since you're young and strong, there's nothing to worry about at this point. I'll also prescribe a potion for your morning sickness and another one with all the vitamins and minerals you need, but please, Mr Potter, even if it's difficult, try to eat some more. Both you and the baby need the nutrition right now."
"No?" Draco could hear his own voice high pitched and insecure. Why did Potter always have this effect on him? When he was at his weakest, with all his defences down?
"You're doing so well," Malfoy's lips tickled as they moved down Harry's throat and ghosted over his collarbone. "You're so obedient, so pliant, aren't you, Auror Potter?" His hand moved up and down on Harry's cock in slow firm strokes that made Harry shudder and whimper. Malfoy and his expert lips moved further down on Harry's torso and licked and bit at Harry's left nipple while his other hand pinched the right one rather hard. Harry yelped and his breath hitched.
"A long time has passed, yes, that's true, but some of us still feel there are things that divide us. When we no longer separate ourselves by what side we stood in the war, in good or evil, Light and Dark, then, and only then, can we say that we have moved on."
I could watch him more closely this time, since the shock of seeing him had faded somewhat from last week. I watched his face as he sang, ripping my soul out of my body with every word.
"You're bossy, I might say," Malfoy sneered and remained standing. "I really don't know what to expect here. I'd decided not to come, I even went to bed. Is this some hilarious prank on my expense and all your Gryffindors are hiding here somewhere, waiting to jump on me?"
Harry shook his head. "It won't happen. I'm sorry." There was too much buried there, too much water under that bridge. He could never go back.
I took the shirt off and straightened the Gryffindor-red I was wearing underneath. "It's not what you think," I sighed. "I've never even kissed a boy." I summoned one of the other chairs and sat down beside him.
Malfoy's face was bright red when he spoke into the wall. "Don't be absurd. You'll always be someone people look up to, their Saviour, the Chosen One, no matter what. Besides, I think you look good."
Hermione had studied the list of potions she'd managed to extract from Seamus. She knew the different ingredients and what they did. It now seemed plain as a day what had happened. She still felt the need to make something clear.
"A bit bruised and battered, but don't worry. I've had worse, I guess." Harry shifted a little on the bed. "Who else is out there?"
It wasn't his first blowjob, but he'd only been on the receiving end before. This was also one of the reasons he washed alone these days; the communal shower-stalls reminded him too much of his former self. Some of the younger boys had obliged eagerly, others...
"I guess it doesn't matter anymore." He let out a deep sigh. "They found out, you see. It was when Blaise got his hands on that bloody Veritaserum. I knew I shouldn't have played that stupid game."
They went to Honeydukes, of course, discussed the latest Quidditch equipment on display at Spintwitches Sporting Needs (all but Hermione), rushed to the bookshop Tomes and Scrolls (only Hermione) and decided (all of them) that Zonko's had nothing as good as George had at Weasley's Wizard Wheezes. Hermione needed a new quill, so they also popped in at Scrivenshaft's. She chose carefully, taking her time. Meanwhile, Harry and Ginny browsed the diffrent quills on display at the shelves. Ginny looked longingly at a self-inking quill, which was far too expensive for her, and Harry let his fingers strike on the softest white quill he'd ever seen, from a Goffin cockatoo. It was sharp at the tip, and fluffy and slightly curled at the top, and he knew from the moment he saw it, who would look good with that quill. When Hermione was finished, and they were out on the street, Harry shouted a hasty, "Wait here!" and dashed into the shop again. He bought the self-inking quill for Ginny, and before he changed his mind, he also threw the cockatoo-quill on the counter.
"Just great," Ron grunted and rolled his eyes. "In the Great Hall, where everbody's watching. Dean, will you get Ginny out of the way. I don't want my little sister to see him like this." He took a firmer hold of Harry, who had started to sway.
The duels and sparring with Potter had come like a warm blanket of normality, and he had embraced it thankfully. He had the suspicion that Potter felt the same need for everything to be as it'd always been. And to his surprise; as Potter treated him exactly like before, so did everyone else. But everything was not the same, it could never be. Not after the Fire, not after the Battle and not after the Trials, were Potter had witnessed in favour of him and his mother, and most likely, saved them from imprisonment.
It was still dark when Draco woke. Through the high windows a grey haze was the only thing that indicated that dawn was approaching. He could barely make out the contents of the room or the form of the body in the bed next to him.
Socrates cast the first part of the spell, the one where every child born had a soulmate bonded to them for life, but before he had the chance to cast the second part, where you would be able to identify your love, he was arrested and condemned to death by the Athenian authorities, for corrupting the youth.
He turned to the nightstand, picked up the small vial and emptied it. Then he ripped off his own t-shirt and pants, got rid of the glasses, before sliding back again beside the blond. Malfoy's legs were covered with dusty light hair that felt coarse and soft at the same time. Harry let his fingers trail up and down them, going a little bit higher with each stroke. He touched the firm muscles of Malfoy's thighs, the slender hips, where the hip-bone jutted out, the v-line that led down to the crotch, the patch of dark-blond curls that surrounded the long shaft. It lay soft, resting on the right thigh. Harry scooted down and ghosted his breath over it to see if it would respond to a little attention. It did, so Harry tried a lick. And then another one, and a kiss on the head and a lick on the slit. It tasted a bit strange and salty, but not in a bad way. Before he knew it, he had a cock in his mouth and was sucking.
Robards nodded thoughtfully. "You're right. Weasley would do very well as a team-leader. So, what are your plans now? I assume you want to leave right away."
"These things happen," Healer Smith said with a concerned look. "As I most clearly told you, Mr Potter, wizard pregnancies are difficult and uncertain."
Hermione put her quill down and gave him an angry look as she reached out her hand and pulled the collar back down again. A long line of various red bruises was revealed. It happened to be Malfoy's favourite spot. "Stop lying to yourself," she said. "This is no way to treat Ginny."
Longbottom shifted awkwardly from one to the other, clearly struggling with conflicting wills, but in the end he gave Pansy a shy smile and took a few steps backwards.
and he got to lead as well, the presumptuos bastard." He slung his arm around Harry's shoulder, chuckling of restrained merryment. "At one point I thought you were done for, mate, with all those Slytherins hoovering around you like vultures."
It wasn't as if he was especially keen on knowing what Malfoy's been up to, but there was something about the insufferable git that always made Harry's toes curl and his mind lose all reason.
"Harry, get out." Draco's face had darkened. "If that's what you still think of me, then get out, right now." He kept his voice low, more of a growl than a whisper. He took a step up to face Harry. "If you feel you can just throw away what we've become to each other like this, then get the hell out of here and don't come back. You can send your precious wife to pick up your son tomorrow."
"I don't want to tell you yet, if it doesn't work, but it includes my mother. Would it be alright for you if she came here?" He worried his lower lip between his teeth.
He locked the office door and pushed the button to the lift. "Do you live with someone?" he asked while they were waiting. "I don't think you should be alone."
Harry took Hermione's hand and moved to look at Draco. He was shifting nervously and refused to meet Harry's eyes.
"Harry Potter, are you saying that you like my hair?" Malfoy was smirking but there was a warm glimpse in his eyes.
It was so obvious that he had a crush on her, and he seemed totally unaware of how fit he'd become this last year. He still acted as the fumbling boy, pudgy and clumsy, when he was nothing of the sort anymore. Pansy found it quite adorable. She had gone with him, a few steps in front of him, making sure her hips swayed sensually with every step. Her own bum wasn't too bad either.
Malfoy snickered, but his gaze drifted away and with an effort to sound nonchalant, he said, "Maybe I can visit him sometime, talk to him about the old days and such."
"Not just one." Malfoy's eyes met Harry's and they were solemn and steel grey. "Four times, and the last, my older brother I suppose, was stillborn. They're all laying on the burial-knoll at Malfoy park. Mother planted different shades of pink roses on all of them. It's quite lovely when they all bloom."
"This is my own concoction," Malfoy said. "It'll help you relax. It's mostly sandalwood, geranium and a dash of cinnamon." He started to unbutton Harry's shirt.
"Have to. As if you only worked office hours when you were out in the field." Draco pulled up his trousers and buckled his belt. "I have too much to do."
The House-cup game had been going on for hours and the Slytherin seeker had been on his tail the whole time, knocking him about, chasing him, playing dirty tricks the entire match. Of course, it was supposed to be rough sometimes, but this behaviour was more childish, and frankly, he'd thought they were beyond that at their age. Hell, it seemed like he didn't even bother to catch the Snitch himself, only to stop Harry from doing it. They'd been tumbling around all over the pitch, Harry trying to reach the Snitch, Malfoy kicking and tugging to get him off balance and hopefully fall off his broom. Ginny, who was captain for the Gryffindor team, tried to get Madam Hooch to interfere, but nothing out of the ordinary was detected. Finally, Harry managed to lay his hand on the golden sphere and it was over.
We kissed, tentative at first, but we both deepened the kiss soon enough. My heart made somersaults in my chest when his tongue slid into my mouth and started exploring. He tasted of something chocolaty and a whiff of mint, and his hair felt just as silky as I'd imagined it would as I ran my fingers through it.
"Pipsey will come and help. And Pipsey will bring food for Harry Potter's baby every day." And with another pop, she was gone.
Harry turned to his friend. "Really? Seriously, you wouldn't mind?" He felt his heart take a giant leap up his throat.
Harry chewed on his lower lip. "When I learned that it was possible, the thought kind of stuck. I really want this, if I can. Are you willing to help me after all?"
"I meant what I said, though," Harry continued, his voice a little softer now. "I did it for you. I thought about you, all the things you've done, tha man you are today, so far from the boy I thought I knew."
Malfoy bared his teeth towards the man in something that could be excused as a smile, but in every sense of the word, wasn't.
"Since I was about thirteen. That's when most parents start looking for appropriate spouses for their children. Finding out the childs mate is preferable, it might not be acted on, but if the person your child is bonded to is otherwise suitible, there's no reason not to take it into consideration."
"Ron!" Hermione cried out and swatted his hand away. Harry glared at Ron, clenched his jaws, that was covered by a dark stubble, and buried his face in her hair. It tugged on the roots a bit, but no more than she could handle. Hermione threaded her fingers through the tousled dark locks on Harry's head. "You don't have to tell us if you don't want to, Harry, but we're here for you. We'll always be, no matter what. You know that, don't you?"
It would have been a lot easier if they all could just leave him alone. Draco worked hard to keep a low profile; he didn't speak to anyone, tried not to bother anyone. He only wanted to get his N.E.W.T.'s and get on with his life. Such as it was.
It was a wild shot, a challange, and anything could happen. Or nothing at all. But he was waiting still, staring into the dying fire.
"You mean to say; I wasn't even your first choice?" Malfoy seemed to straighten up. "Let me get this clear, shall we? You want me to bugger you in your arse, so that you can get pregnant with my superior semen?"
She yanked Seamus off his seat and dragged him up the staircase to the third floor. Ron and Neville started to frogmarch Harry out of the Hall, up the to the first landing, down the corridor leading to Gryffindor Tower, when Harry suddenly sprang to life. He squirmed and resisted, and clearly had no intention to follow them in that direction.
Draco quirked one shoulder. "It's what I make for Scorpius when he's in a state." He took a sip and Harry did too. It was rich and perfect and had a wonderful soothing effect on him.
Harry looked at the four of them around the table and realized they were all waiting for him to talk. Harry fixed his eyes at Molly, it seemed easier to speak only to her. He cleared his throat.
"That's a very pretty dress, Pipsey," he said and rubbed his tired eyes under his glasses. "Now, I need you to help me with something. I made Draco very upset today."
The tears welled up and Harry cried. He allowed himself to let the shame and all his fears take over, as he cried in the arms of the woman who was the only mother he knew.
Harry slumped down at the table, pushed his bowl aside and buried his face in his arms. "Brilliant," he conceded grumpily. "Now what?"
He listened to Draco complain about the inferior brand of tea in the larder, of how a hundered little things were arranged the wrong way in Harry's kitchen and on the mantlepiece, where the Floo-powder was. Harry saw how on edge and nervous he was when he finally threw a pinch in the hearth and called out for the Greengrass estate.
Harry walked to greet the tall elegant woman who'd just Apparated in front of his doorstep. "Mrs Mafoy, welcome in. I can't tell you how greatful I am that you're willing to give this a try." He took her hand and led her inside the hallway. Her eyes wondered around, taking in as much of the old place as she could. Harry turned to Draco, who was at her side, and gave him a nod and a smile as well.
Five minutes past three Harry hurried inside the office door, slightly out of breath, since the Apparation-point had been two blocks away and he'd been late to begin with.
When Malfoy arrived at Harry's Floo in the evening he found Harry in a state of panic. His hair was still wet from the hasty shower and his old glasses sat askew on his nose.
It had been a mistake to bring the good claret from the Manor's wine-cellar. It was far too nice and smooth and ran down your throat so easily that you completely forgot the amount of alcohol it contained, and how it numbed your inhibitions.
"And you, Potter? Still saving the world, I hear." He turned his head and his silver-grey eyes pierced Harry's.
"Harry, darling!" The young dark-haired waitress greeted him with three kisses on the cheeks. "A table for two this time?"
With a pounding heart and slightly out of breath I stopped at the door to his dorm-room. I gave it a knock and felt the handle. It wasn't locked.
"What?" Ron shook his head. He sometimes felt very stupid around Harry and Hermione and their Muggle expressions. He tried to learn, but it was hard to get a grip of them all.
He stood and squeezed Harry's shoulder before he turned to walk towards the house. Harry called after him. "Ron!" He swallowed. "What if there is something? Something much worse." Harry held his breath, bile rising in his throat.
Malfoy rose, pushing Harry down from his lap with firm hands. "I'm sorry, Harry, but I just can't. It's been a nice thought, a dream, but it can never be. I'm so sorry." Before Harry could react, Malfoy gripped the jar on the mantlepiece and threw a handful of the glittering powder into the fire. He turned to Harry, fixated him with eyes as sad as Harry's own, and in a second, he was gone in the green flames.
"Of course, I know about the Black family house. I was there with my mother several times when I was a child. In the end, my mother was the only living relative Great-aunt Walburga had any respect and toleration for. Horrible old woman." He shuddered at the thought.
Speaking of the witch, the doors flung open again and a very agitated Headmistress marched in with her robes billowing, her pointy hat askew, and with Minister Shacklebolt, Head-Auror Robards and a few of the Hogwarts staff in toll.
The front page produced a picture of Harry and Draco at the Charity Gala for the war-orphans last week.
The following Monday I entered Hermione's office with our usual caffeine choices and a bag of newly baked croissants.
Harry flipped the card over and saw the name of a street close to Russel Square. He groaned a bit inwards. The law aspect of his work was somewhat intimidating to him, and the attorneys always managed to make black into white, and white into a foul grey and this case was a bit delicate, to say the least. He was going to be grilled, he knew that, and tricked to say things he didn't mean, just because he had a hot temper. But he guessed it was good to get it out now, instead at the actual trial. Head-Auror Robards never seized to hope that someday Harry would learn from his mistakes and be able to control his anger against the criminals, at least in a courtroom.
Hawthorn-wand!" he pronounced high and clear. Draco turned his eyes wide-open at him and stared. Did Potter still have his old wand?
It'd felt good at the time to have a go at Malfoy with his fists, but now Harry felt like a huge idiot. It was ridiculous really, how fast they'd both resumed to their old habits, worse even, and Harry didn't want that. Not anymore.
"Why this sudden interest in Draco and Astoria? You know, back in school, I used to have the feeling that someday… Oh, never mind. More tea?"
"What are your plans now then? I heard you left the Auror-corps," Draco asked, his eyes held firm ahead. "What will you do?"
"Draco!" Harry roared into the green flames, but there was no answer. Draco wasn't there, not in any of the rooms with a fire. Harry started hyperventilating and a cold sweat broke all over his body. He cursed his own reclessness for going alone without any other means of communication. He could at least have brought the mobile phone Hermione had given to him as a birthday-present but never used. He moaned, "Draco, where are you? Get your bony pureblood arse over here."
"Well, it had a certain Malfoyish tone to it. Ron thought Ginny had sent it at the time, but I don't think it was her. I don't think it's her now, either."
Potter lay silent but cleared his throat. "I'm also sorry for a lot of other things," he said and plucked a little at the top of the blanket. "I never meant to hurt you with the
"Oh, for Salazar's sake, cover yourself," she retorted after his departing bum. A genuinely nice bum, it was too.
He shook his head. "She's my friend since we were children, like a sister. And dating," he gave a humourless snorting laugh, "I guess we could say that my mind's been occupied with other things these last couple of years."
"No, but from what I've heard, there's no talk about you, no jibes about what happened floating around. Only about Potter being a dog or something. I just think you got it all wrong."
Draco shut his eyes and inhaled the comforting scent of Potter, felt the heat radiate from the other boy so close to him. When the morning clatter surrounded them, Potter made him take the cloak again, to sneak out.
In the soft darkness Malfoy's hair shone like a beacon and he lowered himself closer to Harry, removed Harry's glasses and put them on the nightstand, and whispered, "Now, let's make a baby, Potter." With that he let his fingers slide under the elastic of Harry's pants and pulled them down. Malfoy's dressing gown slid apart and Harry could feel the naked skin of Malfoy's thigh against his own and Harry's newly freed cock pulsed with interest, the treacherous thing. Harry closed his eyes and hoped Malfoy didn't notice.
Harry paused. Then he got up and ran stark naked down the stairs. When he returned he had a quill and parchment in his hand. "Then, write," he said, a little out of breath. "I'll make us breakfast. I could use a shower and a good strong coffee right now."
"How are you feeling? Are you all right?" Draco's brows knotted into what Harry had come to recognize as his 'worried-frown'.
The kiss that Harry gave him was nothing like their first. This was deep and fierce and demanding, this was tongue and teeth and spit, this was biting and sucking and devouring, this was bodies who didn't know how to be close enough.
He hadn't chosen this. He didn't want to be here, but the alternative was worse. He loved his home, he really did, but he could never live there again, ever. At the Malfoy Manor his mother walked from room to room, looking mildly surprised that her world had shattered around her, that nothing was the same anymore. Draco couldn't deal with it. Even if he never willingly would've returned to Hogwarts, it was infinitely better. He had to get away somehow.
"So, what's the matter?" Draco asked. "You've been tense and resistant ever since you got here, no fun at all. Tell me what's on your mind, except for the obvious." His silvery eyes bore into Harry's.
"Well, that settles it then," father said. "I'll send Greengrass an owl, telling him that anyone of his daughters will be suitable for us."
"That's all right," Potter said. "I find that hard too. Everybody wants to talk to me about what I did, how it felt... things like that. Later, maybe we can talk about that later." He tucked and patted the duvet over Draco's shoulder. "Why don't you try to sleep instead?"
He discarded his Auror-robes on one of the wooden chairs at the table. Today had been a good day, though. He had followed Hermione home from the Ministry to see Ron, who was on parental leave.
Harry huffed. "You know I don't. Would I have testified in Malfoy's favour if I did? Or his mother?" He felt a heat creep up his neck. He was treading dangerous waters here. He had done that, saved the Malfoys, all those years ago, from Azkaban, without really knowing why, only that it was the right thing to do. Lucius Malfoy was condemned to a lifetime's imprisonment, but his wife and son walked free, thanks to Harry.
After the event of the potion, when Hermione and Seamus had returned to the common room, Harry had stubbornly refused to tell them anything and then he'd stayed in his room for days. Ron told her that he and Neville had found Harry in Slytherin, that he must've had some sort of fight with Malfoy, but that's all he knew. Oh, and that Harry had taken off all his clothes at some point.
Harry pulled away. "So, what are you saying? That you don't want to start a family with me? That you don't want to be with me?"
Malfoy's flat wasn't the vast luxurious patrician home Harry had imagined. Instead it was modern and welcoming, with a dining table in the kitchen, two plush sofas facing eachother in a small living room with a fireplace. "This flat is connected to the Floo," Malfoy said as he gave Harry the tour. The walls in the bedroom were crammed with overflowing bookcases. Malfoy shrugged his shoulders, "I like to read before I sleep." As they went back to the kitchen they passed a closed door next to the bedroom. "And what's in here?" Harry asked. Malfoy stopped and gave him a solemn look. "Not today, maybe later."
The rivalry among the different Houses had, if not come to an end, at least lightened. They all made efforts to get along with the interhouse-unity Headmistress McGonagall had spoken so long and passionately about at the start of the term.
He'd know that posh drawl behind him anywhere. "Malfoy?" He turned to face his former antagonist. Even as he also must rapidly be closing in on thirty, he looked the same. Still tall and slim, with razor-sharp cheekbones, pointy nose and steel-grey eyes. The shoulder-length blond hair seemed a bit thinner, though. "So, they let you out now and again, huh?" Harry couldn't resist the smirk.
"Promise you won't laugh." Harry almost whispered, but since they both decided it was safe to have the booth under a mild
Harry hugged him back. "Merry Christmas, Teddy. Now, I can't take you flying on it." The boy pulled away and gave Harry a sullen look, but Harry continued. "I'm sorry, but I can't. I have no magic at the moment, but if you tell uncle Ron, that you've got the latest edition of the Nimbus X-series, I'm sure he'll be more than willing to help you try it." He squeezed the boy hard once more, then let him down to see him run out with a broom taller than himself in a tight grip. It was Christmas morning and most of the children in the extended Weasley-family were already out in the garden playing with their new toys.
"It's where I live." Potter squinted at him. "Sirius left it to me." The magic in Potter was obvious too. Draco would never have mistaken him for a Muggle if his head had been clear, though Potter's magic wasn't anything like that steady buzz. Potter's magic was like a murmuring storm, like cascading waves, omnipresent and slightly intimidating.
"I'm thinking about staying the night in Cardiff on Friday," Ginny said. "The Harpies has invited me to cover their training match and I'll get exclusive interveiws with all the players. It'd be nice to spend some time with my old team-mates again and to get to know the new ones. What do you say?" She hopped up on the counter beside him and put her hands under her thighs.
There is, of course, a background story to all this, these horrifyingly mixed emotions I apparently still felt for him.
Luna was sitting with Goyle's hand in her lap, drawing lines and patterns with her index-finger at his palm. Harry couldn't hear what she was saying, but he could see her lips move constantly. The look at Goyle's face almost made him laugh. He was totally lost.
Draco laughed, loud and mean, and he finished his drink in one big gulp. "I haven't celebrated my birthday since I was fourteen. Why in Merlin's name would I do it now?"
She took a few steps closer to him and added more seriously, "If you take this, Harry, you don't have to worry about it anymore. As soon as you take Ginny's hand, you'll know."
Draco picked up the samples. "The wallpaper's lovely, but niether of your colours go with it. They're both too bright. Here, let me." He took out his wand and transfigured the blue more turquoise and the yellow into a much more pastel version.
I felt a sweat brake as I clutched the t-shirt in my hand and watched Ron and Hermione with the words
Harry glanced at Malfoy's socked feet. It looked stangely intimate. "I could use something stronger," he muttered as he toed off his boots.
"Oh, no." Zabini pushed him back again. "I've got a feeling this is quite the story. You see," he added to Harry, "I happen to know all about Draco's little inclination about scar-headed Saviours."
Ron nodded. "She said it probably was inevitable, thatwe never got the chance to experiment sexually as we fell in love before we had any experience at all. That it was only human to be curious. We got together again, but I had to promise that she'd be allowed to do the same, if she ever found that she wanted to."
"No house-elves, never. Hermione would kill me. No, you just have to get used to the smell, mister."
He got up and in one swift move he went down on his knees in front of Harry, pushing Harry's legs wider apart. Harry made a sound, high-pitched and needy, in the back of his throat. His hands trembled as they moved of their own accord and opened the button and pulled down the zipper of his jeans. Harry's cock was now fully erect and strained at the containments of his underpants. Malfoy held his head very close and ghosted his warm breath over it. Harry bit his lip to hold back a moan but rolled his hips a little.
"Believe it or not, but I thought I'd like to get to know you a little better. And not only because of the baby."
"I'd say they're responding very well." Malfoy's head fell back and he closed his eyes. The top buttons of his shirt were open and revealed the long slender column of his throat and the smooth pale skin at the dip of his collarbone. His eyelashes fluttered on his cheekbones as his lips parted and he exhaled a deep ragged breath.
"Where did you go, Harry? You were gone so long your food was getting cold. We put a spell on it to keep it warm." Harry slid down in the booth and forced himself to meet the questioning faces of his friends. He was a little out of breath and his cheeks had a suspicious tang of pink. "I just went out for a breath of fresh air, that's all." He tried to sound as detached as possible, but the gulping feeling of guilt hit him as he met Ginny's disappointed eyes.
Harry felt confident while he gave her the tour around the house. She'd claimed her right as a mother to investigate how her children were going to live, but Harry suspected it was mostly curiosity that made her poke around.
"Do you like Italian?" Harry asked as they stepped out on the street. "I know a very nice Italian restaurant." He grabbed Malfoy by the arm, and without waiting for the other man to protest, he Apparated them both.
The Headmistress rose from her chair behind the desk as they entered. "Mr Malfoy, would you please sit down. Thank you, Horace, but I think I need a moment or two alone with Mr Malfoy. Would you be so kind as to wait outside?" She gestured to Slughorn, who gave Draco a glance, that Draco couldn't interpret and then he left.
There was a long silence, except for the piano-player, who crooned something about everlasting love.
Malfoy dropped the knight he was currently moving and turned to stare at Harry. Hermione, who sat at the nearby desk, studying Ancient Runes together with Mandy, put her quill down with shaking hands. "The baby?" she asked, her voice quivering.
Harry rolled over on his back and stared up on the dirty ceiling. Now, he was thouroghly and truly screwed, in more ways than one.
Ron grinned. "You're a wizard, mate. Yeah, it's possible." Ron bit his lip and gave Hermione an apologetic look. "It was him, wasn't it? This would never've happened if you haven't always been so bloody obsessed with Malfoy. I can't believe you let that tosser bugger you."
"Best intentions?!" Draco twirled around so fast it must have hurt. "I bet you can find loads of people who's willing to say that my father also had the best intentions. It's ever so convenient to hide behind 'best intentions' when one does something iniquitous."
"Well, I've been dating Muggles mostly. Don't look so stunned, I haven't exactly been 'out' that long, since I was basically still engaged to Astoria until a couple of years ago."
The heavy oak-door flung open and a herd of laughing boys stormed inside. They gathered around Al and chatted as if they hadn't seen each other in months instead of one day, before they took off up the stairs in one smattering legion. At the top landing Al paused at the banister and grinned down at Harry. A blond boy at his side also stopped and gave Harry a furtive wave.
Harry hadn't planned on taking Malfoy directly up to his bedroom, but here they were. He took an embarrassed glance over Malfoy's shoulder, but the bed was made and the pile of dirty underwear Harry knew he'd left on the floor was miraculously gone. The room was seductively lit, warm and... inviting.
Harry squirmed. "It's a bit of a blur. I don't really know. I remember Seamus mentioning something about a joke." He gave a nervous giggle and mentally slapped himself in the face for his inhability to handle the situation.
"Squib, actually. And she's my assistant, not secretary." He tore a piece of naan-bread and put it in his mouth and smiled as he chewed. "But sometimes she fusses over me more than my mother."
"Well, they're both asleep. They can deal with what's a head of them tomorrow," McGonagall stated, "but for now they need to rest. Can I offer you a nightcap before we call it a day? I certainly know I could use one." The soft voices drifted away out of the door.
"Yep." She tilted her head and locked eyes with mine. "Do you want to know what he was singing about?"
"Certainly," Blaise said accommodating, and filled three more cups. He handed the first two to Granger and Weasley. "Thanks, mate," Ron said and grinned, but Potter shook his head when Blaise offered him the third. "You don't happen to have any pumpkin-juice, do you?"
"Yes, let's sleep," Hermione yawned too. It had been an exhausting day. She cuddled up against Ron as Harry got out of his jeans, then she pulled the bedcovers over the three of them.
After their return from the Christmas break things started to change. Neville thought it was weird, not in a bad way, but still.
He never showed his left arm, not if he could help it. He always wore long sleeves, always got up early in the dorm, to shower and change when he knew he'd be alone. He'd almost forgotten how ugly it was, how black and blotchy it stood out against his pale skain. It didn't hurt anymore, none of his scars did, but they would always be there, a constant reminder of his stupidity.
With a small pop the little elf appeared before him. "You came?" Harry was a bit astonished that it had worked.
"Maybe not," Harry winked at his friend. "Draco's so enveloped in being a dad for the first time, so I stand back a little. I have a plan of my own, one that I know he's going to support whole-heartedly as soon as I tell him." He took a swig from the beer. "You know the girl from the war-orphanage I've been telling you about, Doreen?"
"Pansy insisted I came up to apologize." There was some amusement in Zabini's voice. "She claimed that you were hurt and insulted, and that I shouldn't have pressed you the way I did."
Malfoy evaluated Harry silently for a long time. "This is a bit unexpected and I don't know what to think," he said very slowly, taking a sip of his wine. "But let's play a game. I tell you three things about myself, that I think you don't know, and then you tell me three. If I find what you say the least intriguing, I'll take you out on a real date. Agreed?"
He sighed and added tentatively. "Later, after... everything... dating was the last thing on my mind. I wasn't well. I spent some time at a specialist Mind-Healer in Bern." He gave Harry a furtive glance. "It helped a lot, but I still have trouble using the Floo. Reminds me too much of Vincent and... you know, the fire."
"You're earlier than usual, it'll calm down in an hour or two, but don't worry, I'll find you and your beautiful friend a more quiet table." She winked at Malfoy as she hurried away.
"That's settled then. Hold out your hands." A silky kind of rope pulled Harry's wrists together. "Lay down. On your stomach." Harry's arms were thrust over his head and secured at something. Hard, but not so hard it hurt.
He knew that this bickering, pompous, smart-mouthed git was worth getting to know. That it was something about this boy that had always tickled his curiosity, and that he was ready to face it.
She must have felt Neville's eyes on her, for she lifted her head and winked, and he felt his face heat up and turned away at once.
The door opened and Blaise came in and threw his schoolbag on the other occupied fourposter. The three empty ones stood as a constant reminder of their missing classmates. It was only the two of them left, with Vince dead and Greg with eight weeks left of his six month sentence to Azkaban. They'd heard that Theo was home again from St Mungo's. The cuts on his wrists had mended fine but he didn't want to see anyone, didn't want to speak to any of them. Draco was convinced McGonagall had left the three empty beds in their dorm on purpose, so he wouldn't forget. As if he ever could.
It was almost midnight when Harry woke from his slumber by the roar from the fire. He'd been reading a Quidditch-magazin while he waited for Draco's call, but must have dozed off on the sofa. He rushed up and fell clumsily down on his knees in front of the hearth. "Is everything all right?"
Malfoy gave Harry a quick glance. "That disgrace of a wizard that has occupied my home." She turned to Harry. "I can still hear you, you know, roaming around, moving my things, casting spells, you fat half-breed slob." She looked back at Malfoy and narrowed her mean black eyes at him. "You're a blood-traitor. My lovely niece's child, from the very best of bloodlines. Revolting!" She sat back in her seat again and her eyes moved back and forth on the two men.
The Burrows garden was full of people, chairs and sofas scattered around in various inviting groups where they all sat and chatted merrily. The buffet was crammed with all kinds of delicious foods, and decorated, like Harry had anticipated, by Luna with the oddest things among the lights and candles. The sound that greeted them was the sound of happy friends getting together and catching up, laughing. Children ran around, playing and squeaking, and from somewhere further down by the garden shed, where Arthur proudly had set up his Muggle record-player, soft music was heard.
"What is it this time, Potter?" she faked a sigh and gestured him to sit up on the bed. He obeyed reluctantly.
"You're just worried 'cause you love 'im," Goyle went on. "You always has." He stood clumsily. "I gotta be out there." And then he patted Draco on the back and sluggishly hastened to the door.
Draco's heart almost stopped. Hope, the most dangerous thing of all, tried to press itself up from the abysmal place deep inside, where Draco long ago had placed it.
Harry raised his glass and they all stood and saluted the dark-haired boy. "To James, and good luck on your first year as a Hogwarts student."
Malfoy shrugged a shoulder. "We've all changed in different ways." His eyes raked over Harry. "You look different, though. You're not wearing your glasses, I like the beard, and your hair seems somewhat tamed." He tilted his head. "And you've filled out a bit." Harry embarrassedly felt his waistline. It wasn't much, a softness around the middle mostly, but even so... Malfoy, on the other hand, appeared to consist of legs only.
"No," Harry said. "Not like that. Not on purpose." He drank some coffee and tried to collect his thoughts. "Have you heard of the soulmate-spell? Or, as Hermione calls it, the Split-apart spell?" Harry fiddled with his cup, turning it in his hand.
Draco hummed. "It was pretty obvious from the start, from that very first time. You were far too eager to get my mouth on your cock."
He opened the fridge and the light that turned on almost blinded him. It was mostly empty, except for the basic ingrediencies Hermione told him he should always have if he wanted to cook. He could cook, he just didn't. Harry sighed. He should have accepted Ron's invitation to stay and eat. Not that he was very hungry, he usually wasn't.
"No, and that leads to my other demand. When the child is born, he will have my name. It can be Malfoy-Potter if you prefer,  but he will have my name. He will know me as his other father, no matter that I won't participate in his daily upbringing. He'll be my first-born and therefor he's intitled to be my heir, whether he's born in wedlock or not."
"No." His tone was cold and in total lack of emotion. "She wants me to wait until it calms down a little." He stood. "Can I be excused?"
"Yep," Harry responded. "I finally got Kreacher to agree, to meet up at the platform at Kings Cross with my pack. Then he can take my trunk to Grimauld Place until we get back. Draco's mum insisted on going with us to Waterloo station and see us off."
"Wait a minute," Ron said with a frown. "I thought this was someone you just met, someone new. But you said that he'd known you for years. Who is this guy?"
Zabini shrugged. "Astoria? Smart and funny. Far too pretty for him." He gave Harry a searching look. "You
He led the way down a long corridor, past a row of closed doors and multiple sinister-looking portraits of what Harry presumed to be Malfoy's ancestors. They scowled and huffed indignantly at Harry from their frames. Malfoy stopped and took out his wand. There was an empty space on the wall, but Harry could feel the soft buzz of heavy wards and a disillusionment charm.
Goyle appeared to be Spello-taped at Malfoy's side, out of fear or insecurity Neville didn't know, but where Harry and Malfoy were sitting, Goyle was there too. This seemed to spur other Slytherins to join them at the Gryffindor table; Zabini, Bulstrode and Pansy Parkinson.
"I've been asking around at Diagon, and a lot of people I spoke to there, said that you seemed to feel so much better lately. One even claimed she saw you smile." Harry laughed and Draco snorted and rolled his eyes.
"Scorpius is  decent flyer." Draco handed Harry a drink and their fingers brushed ever so slightly. "But I doubt he'll ever be Seeker. He's more likely a Chaser or a Beater."
without him noticing? He gave Potter a furtive glance to see if he was smirking, but his bright eyes were just solemnly fixed on his. "I was a constant disappointment to him," Draco went on. It felt good.
Draco shook his head. "Of course, I like you. You're Harry Potter. You make my heart beat faster and my magic hum and only you can rile me up like no-one else can. I never wanted anyone else the way I've always wanted you. I've wanted you since the first time I saw you."
"Oh, thank goodness! You're a life-saviour, Draco. Here," he said and handed Lily over to him. "She needs to be changed and I have to deal with these two immediately."
"Of course, they are, you half-witted moron," Malfoy snorted. "If anything should happen to me, how else would mother..."
Draco plucked a little on the top of the sheet. "By doing this, the whole world will assume that you're gay." In the statement was the underlaying question Draco didn't dare to ask.
"Well, wouldn't you like to know?" Malfoy leaned back with a vicious grin playing at the corners of his mouth. He looked amazingly good and he knew it. "Believe me when I say I find no joy in partisipating in this charade, Potter, but I can assure you that I will make the most of it for my own benefit."
"But I wasn't, thanks to you." Harry got up and stood right by him. "You saved me, Draco, when you didn't identify me, and that changed the outcome of the war. And when I snatched those wands out of your hand, well…"
Harry gritted his teeth but did as he was told. He couldn't understand why Draco behaved like this tonight. Harry glanced at the unused manacles at the bedside table and muttered sullenly under his breath, something about self-absorbed prats. He could really need a little tension-release right now.
Oh, did I mention that Seamus, Blaise and Justin got top remarks on their Charms-Project. Professor Flitwick even put on a t-shirt, over his robes and all. What it spelled out? Well, it certainly earned him applause from the whole class.
"Why can't people just leave it be. As I keep saying, NOTHING HAPPENED!" He yelled the last part and hoped the lie would still hold. So far, nothing indicated that Malfoy had told his part of the story, no jibes, no innuendo, nothing. Harry slammed his book close with a bang.
"It's fine, you know. For both of us, I guess." The grin she forced didn't hide the moist in her eyes. He loved her for not looking defeated by it. "Now, I'll have to go and find Dean," she said, "and tell him he's got a date next weekend."
"I can see that you still harbour an overly high opinion of your own worth," Malfoy sneered. "I'm through with this, I want nothing more to do with you."
Harry popped one into his mouth and grinned. "They're fantastic. But you're still not getting any. There's some stew in here, you can have that, but save some for me. I want to have that too after I've finished these." He picked up the contents of the wicker-basket, that once more stood on his kitchen table when he got home, and since it was Friday, Draco had come over to join him. They still met up twice a week, not necessarily doing much more than spending their evenings together, watching telly, eating, talking.
They had all been so supporting and understanding, even the Slytherins. Pansy had hugged him until it almost hurt and had said, "If you don't make me Godmother of the little brat, I'll hex your balls off, Harry Potter. I want to spoil this baby rotten."
"You're far too gernerous with that boy, Harry. He could do very well with the broom you gave him two years ago." Andromeda Tonks sipped her tea. He sat alone with her in the kitchen, greatful for a quiet moment after the booming chaos that Christmas breakfast at the Burrow always was. He had spent a long night talking to Ron and Hermione and reconciling with Ginny, not that she'd admitted being wrong, but she spoke to him again and he was content with that.
Ginny rolled her eyes. "Well, you've never been good with words, now have you, Harry." She gave him a solemn look. "If you change your mind, if you really want me, you'll come back."
They stood face to face, Harry and Malfoy, just like they had seen them through the years, in fights and duels, but now Harry slung his arms around Malfoy's neck and grinned like a fool. "I love you too, you wanker," he said and kissed him.
"You were forced. You were cleared at the trials." I laughed, a little uncertain. "I know, I was there, remember?"
There were applause and cheers, and Ron Weasley dashed over to the barbeque at the garden corner together with his brother George, where they started to hand out the grilled meat to everyone. The farewell party was in full swing and everybody they knew had come to celebrate what Harry had told him was one of the happiest days of the year. Draco couldn't agree more, but he also felt a little sad. The house would be empty with Jamie and Teddy gone. He had grow used to the chaos that now was his life.
He twirled, grabbed his bag and steamed off towards the door, bumping into desks on his way out. Draco couldn't help but shout after him, "Well, fuck you too, Scarhead."
Harry couldn't get Malfoy out of his mind. Then, when had he ever? Now, Harry thought about him all the time, watched his every move, even dreamt about him. Dreams that made Harry wake rock-hard and wank himself raw over.
"Well, you're wrong there," Harry beamed. "Sirius told me he loved to change me and wash me, and nagged my parents to let him do it as often as he could."
Harry hesitated, but when Hermione smacked Ron to get him to shuffle over and there was room at her side, he climbed in.
"But I do." The honesty in the snappy retort made something inside Harry preform a somersault. "I want that very much."
"The things we've done to each other," Potter said. He looked so sad, so vulnerable, so young. Draco took a deep breath and removed his shirt altogether.
Ron stared at his wife with eyes wide as plates. "Are you telling me, Hermione Jean Granger,that you actually stayed
Harry heard himself moan and whimper. He had never been this loud with Ginny, but then, this was a totally different sensation. Every stroke, every thrust Malfoy made had Harry gasping for air. His head was blurred and his heart was pounding, and a pool of warmth was steadily building at the pit of his stomach. It suddenly wasn't enough. Harry sneaked in one of his hands and gripped his leaking cock and started to pull.
"How can you say that?" Draco came to his feet and clenched his hands into fists. "After what happened, that lovely little prank Potter played on me."
Ron chewed on his fingernails and Malfoy had a sheen of sweat on his brow and his blond fringe got stuck on it as he sat bent over the board. His queen was furious with him and shouted contradictive directions, but he ignored her.
Draco looked away and he felt his ears go red. Had it slipped, or had he really wanted Potter to know. "I thought it was obvious, especially after Aunt Walburga's outburst that first day. I'm sorry if it makes you uncomfortable." Draco swallowed, a big lump had suddenly appeared in his throat, and rose from his chair. "Maybe I should leave, then."
Harry searched but couldn't spot a certain blond among them. Whenever he and Malfoy met these days they greeted each other with a nod. They never spoke though.
Harry shoved his chair back and stormed out of the café, and in a second, he Disapparated without caring how many Muggles that saw him.
Harry crouched a little under the stare the Headmistress gave him as he was standing in front of her desk with Malfoy at his side. Blood was dripping from the git's nose and Malfoy tried to hold his head high and still keep eye-contact with the furious witch. Harry's lip ached and had swollen to its double size. He could taste blood in his mouth and his knuckles hurt. Malfoy had a black eye.
The bed was narrow for three people. Hermione could've easily enlarged it with a simple spell, but she chose not to. She rather liked the way they were forced close together, like a litter of pups. This wasn't the first time they'd shared a bed like this. Sometimes, during those long months on the run, being pressed between these two boys, with their warm bodies, listening to their breathing, feeling their hearts beating, was the only thing Hermione felt could keep her sane in a world that scared her so much she almost lost the ability to function. She loved them both; differently, but just as strong.
"I know." Harry gave a little embarrassed laugh. "I think I fell for you ages ago, back in school. I couldn't keep myself from staring at you, following you, and all the while I kept telling myself it was because you were my enemy."
Draco needed an anchor, something to hold on to, and Potter's hips were right there, on top of him, gyrating slightly. Draco didn't know if he'd ever been this turned on in his entire life. He lifted his pelvis and his throbbing cock pressed against Potter's. He was equally hard.
"Don't worry, I won't embarrass you in front of your rightious little friends," Malfoy hissed very close to Harry's ear. "Trust me, I'm not that keen to make my presence known." With that said, he spit in his hand and gripped Harry's cock together with his own and with them aligned side by side, his hand started to move.
"Nice to see you again, Harry. It's been too long. How are you?" Her honey-brown eyes gleamed warmly at him, her round cheeks were rosy, and she smiled. She was more beautiful than ever.
They went to the new little teashop just around the corner and sat down at a small round table. It felt a little awkward sitting there, so civilized, with his school-nemesis, but luckily for Harry, Malfoy had no problem with starting up a conversation.
"Yeah," Ginny squeezed his arm and tried to capture his eyes, "you don't have to see any of theose people ever again. We can all go home now, Harry."
The nausea that ripped through him most of the day was now replaced with a raging hunger, and Harry had a suspicion that the snugness he felt in his jeans was more due to him sitting on his arse all day and eating like a pig, than his three months baby-bump.
A bolt of anger shot through him. What nuisance that boy could be. The quarrel three days ago had been ridiculous, and the things Draco had shouted at him. Preposterous!
Al pulled his fingers through his messy hair in impatience. It really was an atrocious mop of raven black, Harry thought. His own had turned salt and pepper by now.
Harry cringed at the over-enthusiastic former Slytherin. "I don't remember us being exactly friends, Zabini," he muttered.
"No, you've only just got home, and it's such a short break. You'll see your friends in a few day's time." Harry clenched his teeth and forced every thought of the Malfoys out of his mind. He had traffic to focus on, God damn it, and it'd been a close call with that bus.
"I found it was very similar to brewing potions, a lot of chopping and stirring, not half as complex." He drew his fingers through his hair and a few strands fell over his face. "But there was a lot of burnt stew in the beginning," he said with a sheepish grin.
on their shirts, Zabini, Parkinson and Goyle. They were forcing the item on him, but Malfoy gave a haughty snarky laugh and threw it in Zabini's face and took off up the stairs to the dorms.
"You've never dated?" I studied him. He had a small mole on his upper lip I've never seen before. "I always thought you and Parkinson..."
He lifted his head and our eyes met. "You felt?" he said. He looked rather astonished. "Haven't you realized, that these songs are all for you? How I feel about you? I'm pouring my heart out every week, only for you." He lifted one of his hands, and cupped my chin and tilted my face up a little. "Oh," was all I managed to say, as it dawned on me. Then the world stopped spinning for a while, because he kissed me. The applause and cat-calls from the bar made me surface again, and he threw a quick smile at me on his way to the stage.
"All right." Malfoy stood. "But in this kind of house there probably already is a nursery at the top floor where the Black children used to stay."
Harry felt his lower lip wobble as if he was about to start crying. "I'm sorry, 'Mione. I'm sorry, everyone," he made a sweep with his eyes around the room. "I never meant for it to happen, it just did."
Neville understood. She was in love with Malfoy and this must be a terrible blow to her, to find out like this, in front of all these people. He had to protect her from their curious eyes, take her somewhere safe where she could fall apart without a bunch of gloating bystanders. He had to act now.
"You shouldn't." Malfoy glared a little and sighed. "But the things I did, the consequences it had, it's something I have to live with for the rest of my life, so I better get used talking about it. Especially to someone like you."
It was late and he'd had far too much to drink. There weren't many left at the bar at this time. Apart from himself and the grey-bearded old wizards at the corner table, engaged in a loud argument, apparently about something that happened fifty years ago, there was only the bartender. And the blond man at the far side of the counter.
Harry turned to McGonagall, whose eyebrows had knotted together. "I know it's quite late, but I need to get this done right now. If I don't, I'll probably never will and that wouldn't be right. But I feel I need a little help and support to do this, and in all fairness, maybe Malfoy should have that too." Harry stood and braced himself with a few steadying breaths. "Professor, could you, please, fire-call Molly Weasley and ask her to come over for a moment?" Harry turned to Malfoy again. "Are the grates at Malfoy Manor open to the Floo-system?"
"Of course, you did," Draco snorted and picked up his quill, pretending to pay attention to his star-chart again. "You always lose at chess, Blaise."
A sky-larch darted up in front of them and started chirping its warning song, soring high up in the air. "Let's go back," Draco said. "We'll have tea in the Winter-garden with my mother and I don't want to make her wait." He put his arm around Harry's waist, slightly stroking a thumb over the small swell at the side of Harry's tummy. "And we'll tell her about the baby."
Minerva McGonagall twisted her mouth into a thin line. "You can use the Floo in my office." She held out her hand and helped Harry up. "What were you thinking, boy? What possessed you to do such a thing? You meant well, no doubt, but it was unwise and foolish. And in your condition, too."
Malfoy snorted. "What did you expect? For everyone to fall on their faces in awe as soon as you raised a wand, Oh Chosen One?"
Harry picked up his spoon and started pushing it into the lemon-tart, creating very small pieces of it. "You have a boy?" he asked quietly, giving Malfoy a glance.
Harry felt compleatly out of his mind. Malfoy held still, giving Harry time to adjust. When Malfoy moved again, he brushed something inside of him, that went straight to Harry's own cock, making it leak and wobble. His eyes filled with moist in a mixture of pain and desire. He felt he couldn't hold back much longer. He cried out, "I love your cock inside me. I love you."
"Of course, there is," Hermione said. "We read all about it in History of Magic, 5th year. Don't you remember?"
Draco swallowed hard and placed the wand carefully beside him on the bed and pulled the sheets up. "Why are we naked if nothing happened?"
"Calm down, mate," Ron said carefully. This was unexpected, but he quickly decided to go along with it. "You don't have to see Gin if you don't want to. Just come with us, we'll help you get what you want."
They Side-alonged into the entrance hall and un-shrunk the sleeping-bag and Al's satchel. Al bent his head back and gaped at the high ceiling, the marble staircase and the many paintings in golden frames of disapproving Malfoys on the walls. "Wow!" he breathed.
He was tired. He was tired of throwing up almost everything he ate. He was tired to the bone, but again, nothing to worry about, all part of being eight weeks pregnant. It irritated him that he felt so grumpy, that he wasn't happier. He
"Why can't he go, Harry?" Ginny asked and held up the neat invitation-scroll Al had given her. "It's only for a night. I know Malfoy's not your favourite person in the world, but surely you're not blaming the boy for what his father and grandfather are responsible for?"
"Will never understand," Draco finished the sentence. "He will never give up, he will keep forcing me until I'm bound to someone who will help restore the family name. He can be very persuasive and completely unyielding. You know how he's like. I'll have no say in the matter, never."
Ron gave her a questioning look and then he put a hand on my shoulder. I drew a steadying breath and pulled the blasted shirt on and closed my eyes, afraid to look. When I peeked, it was only two letters. Was that even a word?
"What are we going to do about your non-existing career choice?" Malfoy lifted his shot and peeked at Harry. "I'm sure you can pick whatever you want and they'll all cheer and applaud."
Ginny relaxed at his side and surveyed the surroundings. "That's an odd pairing," she said and put a fork full of pie in her mouth and pointed with it empty towards the couple under the apple tree.
"Yes, they were the same as in that horrid singing Valentine's I received second year. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you?"
"Nobody speaks in those terms anymore, Draco. The rivalry among the Houses is in the past." Blaise paused. "You know I'm seeing a Ravenclaw-girl, right?"
They sat on a row in the back, Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny. Harry was greatful that they were all there, that he could feel their presence by the heat of their bodies, as they were crammed so close together on the visitor's bench.
"Well, since I'm paying for it," Harry said. He stood and made his way over to the bar. When he returned he carried a tray filled with six small glasses of clear liquid. "One shot for one question truthfully answered. What do you say?"
In the bottom of the basket Pipsey had placed a box of heart-shaped chocolate biscuits. As Harry placed them on the table it reminded him.
Harry thought that Malfoy would've had the decency to keep a low profile, to go out of his way, to be a little more tentative, but no, it was like it always been between the two of them, perhaps even worse. But there also was something teasing and a feeling of pretence to the hexes they threw at one anonther, the stares across the Hall, the endless verbal fighting, that just kept on and on. It was like an itch, that constantly needed scratching.
Potter's lips were soft and searching, they nipped and nibbled, tentatively asking for something. Nothing like the hard frantic kisses they'd shared that time in Draco's bed, not so long ago and yet in another lifetime. Something warm erupted inside of him and Draco heard a needy whine slip out of his throat.
a long time ago, Ron, and he was cleared of all charges, being underage. He was a child then, same as us. Lucius is in Azkaban where he belongs, and will no doubt never see daylight again, and what I've heard, his mother's not well. It's not fair how he's been treated over the years."
"Because, you're my fucking soulmate, that's why. And I wanted you." He buried his face in his hands. "Salazar's saggy tits, I wanted you."
There was a silence, then with a crack of magic the door flung open and Pansy found her friend standing in the middle of the messy room. His hair looked dishevelled and his clothes were haphazardly put on. Not at all the neat, carefully composed boy he worked so hard to be these days, with his voice calm and his head down, always on the guard not to offend anyone. His arms hang at the sides in a totally defeated way. The ugly Mark on his arm, otherwise so carefully covered, fully on display.
"Go, I can make it. It's not that far to the Infirmary from here." Draco supported himself with one hand against the wall and proceeded down the stairs.
"I've been thinking about it ever since," Potter said breathlessly, "and I want it. I want you." He fumbled around a little at his bedside table and handed Draco a book. "Ginny got me this for Christmas. She's a menace. It's a spell-book for same-sex couples and there are preparation spells and... lubrication spells." He smiled goofily. "I seem to have lost my glasses, so you have to cast them. I've marked the page."
done all those things and said what he'd said. He had stomped on Harry's nose, bullied his friends, tried to kill Dumbledore, and been a cruel spoilt brat through all their years together.
"Hey, I call the shots here. I decide what counts and what doesn't. Right now, my top priority is to make you a little less embarrassing to be seen with."
Harry was seated right behind him in Transfiguration class, and he couldn't stop looking at that long slender neckline, fragile and unyielding at the same time. His eyes were locked at it and he had difficulty concentrating on the textbook in front of him, when Malfoy lifted his hand to scratch his neck; no, not scratch, he trailed a finger up and down, almost caressing against the grain of the neatly cut blond hair. Somehow this made Harry's blood rush to his groin and a sweat broke on his upper lip. Malfoy tilted his head slightly forward and a strain of the long fringe fell in front of his eyes, and Harry could sense, rather than see, the smirk at the corners of his lips. The bloody bastard was doing it on purpose. He knew Harry was looking at him. Later that afternoon, Harry had no choice, but to assault him outside the boy's bathroom and drag him into one of the cubicles and run his hands all over him.
Arousal thumped in his veins and roared in his brain, and Harry had to let out a loud moan and prey that the Silencing charms still held around his bed.
at my father and at everything and everyone. There were a lot of drinking and a lot of not so legal potions, and I discovered I had a very strong reason not to get married." He met Harry's gaze. "But I came through, more or less undamaged, with a strong yearning to
"Hey, George needed me at the shop, you know that. And Harry couldn't see the point of an extra year, since he was all ready accepted at the Academy."
She paused. "What's the matter with you? You skip classes, you're not sitting with us in the common room anymore and you've been a far more than a little distracted lately." She bit her lip. "Look, Harry, if you're seeing someone else…"
He got very red in the face when he continued. "I'm not saying we should get married, but being engaged means we could see more of each other and maybe do what we just did a bit more. I sure would like that." He stopped and bit his lip. "Can you, please, say something."
"So, you want to be with him, is that it? If that is so, why aren't you already?" Ginny's eyes pierced Harry's again.
He climbed the stairs, careful not to make too much noise as he passed the covered portrait of Mrs Black and sighed again. That had to go before any child of his stepped foot in this house, along with a lot of other horrifying heirlooms from Sirius' family. He stubbornly jutted out his jaw when he saw the mess in the bedroom he had once shared with Ron.
Harry just sat there, his arm still stretched out and his glasses a little bit askew. Finally, he lowered his arm and nodded. "We're gonna have a baby, Malfoy," he said. The thought suddenly felt so wierd, so unrealistic, so totally preposterous now that it had happened, that Harry started laughing. He tossed away his glasses and laughed and laughed, tears formed in his eyes and he rolled around in the bed, gasping for air.
Malfoy furrowed his brow. "I don't know. When they couldn't work anymore, they just disappeared. I suppose my father got rid of them somehow."
"The thing about Draco," Zabini stated and put his cup down at the desk, "and I'm surprised you haven't noticed this about him yet, is that he's so irritatingly loyal. He values family above all things, and blood-lines. Underneath all that smirking and posing, he's always had this core of strong moral standards. He never backs down on his word, no matter what the consequences will be for him."
"Did you know," Draco continued, "that last week, when I visited Diagon Alley, I was actually treated like a worthy member of the human race? No one sent curses after me, or crossed the street just to avoid meeting me. Shop-owners nodded politely at me when I made my purchases. What we've been doing these last months had actually worked. Being associated with you worked." He drew his hands over his head, making a few strands loosen from the ponytail. "This stupid sentiment of yours today ruined everything. They'll hate me more than ever after today."
It stung a little, and a drop of blood welled up from his wrist. His father took his arm and let the drop fall into the
A few days later Harry stood in the dark hallway of number 12 Grimmauld Place, unshrinking his bags and brushing the snow off his shoulders. He looked around at the old townhouse and sighed.
Malfoy nodded. "She's a piece of work, I say that. Let me work on the sticking charm for a while, se what I can come up with."
Harry went red as a beetroot. "I just can't." He lifted his head and met his friend's eyes. She took his hand in hers.
"It's a long time ago now, but I guess I never told you what happened that week when I was staying undercover in that shithole with Auror Patterson. She was assigned a new partner after that."
"Well, it grows on you, I suppose." He winked at Malfoy, and Harry wasn't sure, but he thought he saw Malfoy's cheeks heat up before he turned away.
"No, that was just a stupid notion I had at the time. I don't want to talk about it again, it's not who I am."
Harry startled as Ginny yanked the drapes of his fourposter open. "So, this is where you're hiding." She sat down on the bed beside him and flicked the cascade of red hair to her back. "We missed you in the common room," she said, "and you didn't come down to dinner today either."
Draco sighed. "I honestly can't say. I know for a fact that she never shared my father's faith in the Dark Lord, but she's very proud of her heritage. As I am too." Then his grey eyes glittered as he looked at Harry. "And I will be very proud of my son's heritage, as well. He'll be part Malfoy, part Black, part Potter and part Muggle. What better combination could there be for a young wizard in our times. But for the most, he'll be his own, with his own choices to make, his own mind and his own pride. And I can't thank you enough for giving me this wonderful gift." He stood and faced away from Harry, and with a short laugh he wiped his eyes. "I thought you were the one with the raging hormones. Come, before I make a complete fool of myself and start bawling. Are you up for a tour around the house?"
Harry busied himself with making the tea, the Muggle way, as was his habit; one strong and sweet for himself, the other one weaker with only a dash of milk, just like Draco liked it. He concentrated on his breathing before he turned and faced the other man.
There was a big tree in the middle of the room, lights in every colour, food and snacks, and one of the Hufflepuffs, who was good at Weatherspells, had enchanted the ceiling to make big snowflakes slowly fall and dissolve as soon as they touched the floor. It was beautiful. There were tinsel, garlands and music, and Draco was in the worst of moods.
The whole situation was ridiculous really. What was a bunch of fifteen-year-old schoolboys to the Dark Lord, to all the things they had encountered? Against his will Draco felt the corner of his mouth twist up in a smile. Amazingly, Potter smiled too.
made his eyes glitter behind the spectacles. But they were filled with concern when he leaned forward and put his hand over Draco's. "We all heard. Have you been out all day? What were you trying to do? Make you freeze to death? It's still February, you know."
"It was a prank! I thought it'd be funny, but then I got shit-scared anyone would figure out I wrote it and get the wrong idea. What do you think I was doing in that blasted corridor? I tried to take it back, but it was too late."
In the small hours of the night Harry woke up with the blond man sleeping beside him. He put on his glasses, picked up his wand and cast a faint
A scattered few hands were seen in the air, but the majority kept their hands down. "A six months hous-arrest, could that be sufficient?" Shacklebolt asked. Immediatly the rest of the hands shot up.
"What a lovely surprise." In one swift move he shut his book and came to his feet. He put the book down beside the wine glass. "May I take your coat? And take off your shoes. Would you like some wine?"
"Why don't you want to see me anymore?" Potter continued. "Is this some Pure-blood racist shit again?"
"So," Harry waved his hands around the bar and cleared his throat. He wasn't at all certain how to address this. "This is a gay bar."
"Come with us, Harry," Ron coaxed. "Up to Gryffindor. Ginny's waiting," he lied, hoping that Harry would fall for it, despite leaving her a minute ago in the Hall. But Harry started to thrash around, fighting off Ron's hands. Swiftly he had them at wand-point, something wild gleaming in his eyes.
Harry whipped his head around and saw a distant figure slowly walking along the shore, hands in his pockets and the white blond hair shining like silver in the pale moonlight.
Potter shook his head. "Not if we're doing this, not if we're... lovers. Besides, you've called me Harry before."
"Something's already happened!" Harry whined. He pressed the heels of his hands against his eyes. He must have dropped his glasses somewhere. "Something is always happening to me. Why can't my life just be normal for once? Why did it have to be me who drank Seamus's stupid potion and get pregnant?
Harry pushed his glasses up his nose and took a deep breath. "The thing is... I've not been doing well lately. My Mind-Healer tells me I work too much." He gave a little strained laugh. "Practically everybody I know tells me I work too much, even before Ginny left me." Malfoy's perfectly groomed eyebrows flew up to his hairline. "She told me I should date Head-Auror Robards instead, since I seemed to prefer his company over hers." He liked to tell it as a joke, which is wasn't at the time, but it made it hurt less.
Shacklebolt tapped his wand again and asked for order. A few more hands were raised, and a count had to be administered. Harry held Malfoy's gaze across the courtroom. Shouts and yells were heard all over the place until Shacklebolt's magnified voice was raised over the ruckus. "Six months house-arrest for Draco Malfoy it is then. This court is adjurned."
I've seen many more of Draco's shows since then. He still plays the sad songs, because they're popular and people request them, but there are others now. Newer. Happier. I like those, but I secretly prefer the old ones. They remind me, how precious what I now have, is. That, I never want to forget.
"And you're okay with that? This idea about Malfoy was the worst idea Hermione ever had. I can't believe you're actually going through with it. What possessed you to give in to him? Why him, Harry?"
Suddenly the Floo whooshed and a tall figure flicked the soot away with the tip of his wand on Harry's living room rug. Harry sat up with a start. "What are you doing here, Malfoy?"
"Don't tell me you don't think about it. Don't tell me you don't want this too." Harry's voice was very low, barely audible. He tilted up his face and finally locked eyes with Malfoy. His pale eyelashes fluttered and his breaths came uneven.
"Surely you can see, Malfoy," Ron said, in an attempt to be diplomatic, "that Harry only had the best intentions."
He dared a glance up at Malfoy's face and was met with eyes that shone like silver in the night. "Are you molesting me in my sleep, Harry Potter?"
They started quite a buzz when they entered side by side, but Harry forced a smile around the room, was handed a glass of Prosecco and they made their way around the store. At some point, after Harry'd been held up by an elderly wizard, who apparently had played Seeker for Gryffindor about seventy years ago and had a very long anecdote about it, Harry lost Malfoy to the crowd. He eventually got loose after endless attempts and began to servey the room after him.
"I know you were old enemies, but that was such a long time ago," Al went on, completely unaware of how his words affected his father. "Scorp's dad is also sitting at home brooding, like an old man. Just like you."
When Harry returned after midnight to his flat later that night, he had to try something. He called out into the dark living room. "Pipsey!"
Ron and Hermione exchanged startled looks, when they saw Malfoy make a cringing face and they heard Harry's ringing laughter
WIth shaking hands Harry lifted the little flask to his lips and swallowed the required amount. It tasted a bit of soap and something metal that reminded him of blood.
And the sensation of being filled. Stretched out. Touched on the very inside. Once more, something slick stroke a bundle of nerves deep inside of him, that had him gasp and whimper.
"What's it to you?" He almost spitted out the words, fixing his eyes on the reindeer's nose, so he didn't have to look up.
His long fingers danced easily over the keys, the tune slightly sad. His blond hair looked almost fluorescent in the spotlight. The long fringe fell over his eyes as he bent down over the piano, and his features were just as sharp and pointy as they always been. He was still beautiful.
"Not according to my Father." Draco said and continued. "For being a coward, a fake, for being weak and... being gay."
After a while he said, "He never gave me a chance to make my own choises in life." And with a quivering voice, he added, "I loved him very much."
Harry winced as the thought of what he just done made him queasy. He felt exhausted alright. Malfoy was excellent at playing this game.
Little Rose had been the most wonderful baby, and Harry had sat with her on his knee, burying his nose into the soft red curls at her neck, inhaling her sweet baby-scent. Sometimes he just wanted to grab her tight in his arms and run, run far and fast into hiding, and shield her from the world. He knew it was a silly notion, her parents were the best people in the world and more than capable of taking care of her themselves, but still. It was a sick thought, and he despised himself for having it. He gave Rose back to her father and stood.
Malfoy pulled away from him, and cast a quick look around, but since nobody seemed to be taking too much notice, and the others weren't exactly queuing up to be his assignment partner, he shrugged his shoulders. "You better not screw everything up for me, Scarhead. Just shut up and do as I tell you, all right?"
Malfoy gave a disbelieving humourless chuckle and shook his head as he closed his bag and swung it up on his shoulder. "They all think you're so righteous and noble, don't they? The Golden Hero. But I know how full of shit you really are, Scarhead. No more, this is it. I won't let you deceive me one more time."
We stared in silence at each other, until he turned back to the window again. "What are you doing here, Potter?"
"Damn you, Potter, I can't marry Astoria now." Draco was still quite out of breath and his heart hammered like mad in his chest.
Harry squinted his eyes and tried to concentrate on the man's face. "But not Malfoy here," he continued with a small hiccup. "He's good, much better tha'evryone thinks. But, d'you know the best thing 'bout him?" Harry turned to Adam and failed as he tried to keep his voice low. "The best thing 'bout Malfoy, 's his cock."
"I can't see why I can't have the time to bond with my child at any other time. What's wrong with house-elves? That's what they're for."
He'd known since their Summer Solstice-party, that the Greengrass family had made inquiries about him. Mother had sighed and said to father, that it was time to find out, and this morning his house-elf brought him the message to meet them here.
"You're very quiet," Malfoy said. "At least for a loud bombastic Gryffindor," he added with a smile.
"May I ask, Mr Potter," she demanded and her piercing eyes bored into Harry's, "what in the name of Merlin and Morgana was the meaning of that?"
Malfoy lifted his beer to his lips and let his eyes survey the room. The three men next to them were involved in a wild discussion about something work-related and their new boss. The two women at the table on their other side were obviously gossiping about a friend's divorce, and at the bar a big screen showed a football-game on full volume. No-one was paying them any attention.
"Hmm, all right," Draco mumbled, his voice hoarse. "As long as I don't have to change another diaper again."
"You like children, don't you?" Harry continued. "We could have another baby. I know you still care about the bloodlines deep down. We could investigate the possibility of a surrogate. And we could adopt. There's plenty of children out there in need of a loving home, believe me, I know. I wouldn't mind having a dozen or so." He laughed a little nervously. "You're very quiet. Am I totally out of line here?"
"Answer the question, Malfoy," Harry bellowed, but found himself being pushed back through the door by a couple of strong hands on his chest. Janice closed the door behind them with a small apology to the grey-haired man.
Hermione clapped her hands together. "Oh, this is such a brilliant idea, isn't it? Come on, let's get ours." She grabbed Ron's hand and me by the arm and pushed us forward. Brilliant, my arse. What was I supposed to do? If I refused it would look suspicious and if I pulled it on, who knew what it would reveal. STRAIGHT didn't feel  quite right anymore, but how would it know? I'd never done anything but with a girl, so if the shirt sensed that, it would send out the wrong signal, wouldn't it? And if it said GAY? Well, that would make it very difficult to ask a girl out.
Ron cooked dinner. They became a party of close friends who felt the neeed to gather and talk, Seamus, Dean, Luna, George and Ginny. They all sat around the large kitchen table, drinking wine or beer and casting furtive glances at Harry and Draco. Harry had a coke, Draco nothing. A silence spread after a while, and then suddenly Draco broke it. "You have no idea of what you've done today, have you?"
Malfoy's eyebrows shot up and Harry heaved a sigh. "All right. I have no idea of what I want to do with my life, now that I won't become an Auror, so right now I'm doing nothing. I spend most of my days sleeping late, then I go pestering my friends while they work or study. I go over to Andromeda Tonks a lot to play with little Teddy. There, happy? Can I have my shot now, please?"
"Well, congratulations," Mandy Brocklehurst cheered and some of the others chimed in, but Neville could feel how the girl in his arms started to shake, and she gasped for air as if she were about to cry.
The thought was probably not that farfetched in McGonagall's mind. Draco closed his eyes and rubbed his temples. This made him uneasy, lying here talking to Potter in the dark. It wasn't normal. "Our wands are probably locked away in the Headmistress's office right now," Draco muttered, mostly to himself.
"As you must have been told, Mr Potter," Healer Towler continued, "I specialize in wizard-pregnancies here at St Mungo's. You're quite safe under my care, since I'm the one with most experience in this field of magic." He gave a short laugh. "As a matter of fact, my partner and I are expecting our third child in a few weeks' time, so you see, you can relax, and I'll be with you all the way through this."
"Maybe we ought to be." Harry reached out and put his hand over Malfoy's at the table. "The war is over, and even if you were a total prick at school, I can tell you're not really as intolerable as then. Hermione told me you apologised very sincerely when you met her at Hogwarts. But if you don't want to," Harry trailed off.
"Don't you remember? The potion I made in the summer after the war, to help us identify our soulmates. I took it and you took it. It helped me identify Ron as my true love, but in your case, nothing happened."
Harry had heard of Malfoy's difficulties, sure he had, and that he'd been abroad for a while, but Malfoy had returned and sat for his N.E.W.T.s at Hogwarts along with Hermione and a few others, who had been allowed an extra year of studies. According to Hermione, he did very well on his exams. But apart from that… He studied Malfoy, who leaned against the wall with his eyes shut and a strain set at his jaws. Malfoy wasn't in robes; he was dressed in a pair of black trousers and a light-blue jumper. On a whim Harry said, "Come on, Malfoy, I'll buy you a drink." He made an effort to keep his voice even and uninterested.
"Would you mind if I used your shower?" Malfoy asked as they stepped inside Harry's narrow hallway. He had wrapped his arms around himself, looking a bit lost and uncertin. "I can still feel the prison smell in my hair and clothes." He winced.
With Socrates dead, people were left with half a spell and a longing for a completion, that they could not easily find. It stirred the minds and created a lot of wondering, which we all live with up to this day. One of his desciples, Plato, created the myth, as an explanation to Muggles on what was going on, the myth of the Split-Aparts."
"I can take over from here, if you like," Harry said. "A fragile truce is set, which I hope will last 'til bedtime, in the other part of the Potter family." He squatted down at Draco's side. "I'm sorry you had to witness that. The boys are both a bit edgy and tear up about almost everything these days. I think they miss their Mum." He rubbed his neck. "It's a disappointment for them, for all of us really, that she's not been able to have them as much as we thought she would lately." He lowered his voice into more like a whisper. "She was supposed to have them this weekend, but it turned out she got on a portkey with some of her team-mates to Milan instead. They're be meeting up with the local Quidditch-team for some friendly training matches and dinners."
"Don't insult me by confusing me with my father, will you. I've had enough of the man to last me a lifetime."
Apparently, Draco also felt dissmissed like a schoolboy, if the bashful look on his face was anything to go by. "Mothers," he muttered.
"I can't believe you talked me into this. My figure is completely destoyed forever." The elegant woman in the fitted purple dress held her cheek up to him to be kissed.
Harry walked out to the waiting area. His friends were on their feet at once and rushed up to meet him.
"Oh, Harry, that's wonderful." Hermione gave me a hug. "We know there's been something on your mind for some time now. Isn't this better, to have it all out in the open?"
Draco pressed his face harder against Harry's neck and said nothing. But then he cleared his throat and Harry could feel the dampness of tears on his skin.
Harry felt slightly dizzy when he stepped out on the pavement. The noice from the pub lifted from him in the relative silence that was the busy London street. Malfoy beside him turned his face up and closed his eyes as he inhaled deeply. The light from the lamppost behind him turned his hair to gold.
Ginny bit her lip. "But that's just the thing, I promised her she could spend the night at her friend Suzy's. You know how she's been nagging us about that. You'd be on your own."
Poppy kept scanning the list of potions and tried to analyse what the different ingrediencies did to one another. Finally, she walked over to the cabinet and retrieved a small glass beaker. She gave it to Potter. "I need a urine sample, just to clear something out. Could you fill this for me, please?"
Malfoy removed his hands from his grinning mouth. "I told you. The elves and the house are connected by magic. Of course, he knows there's a baby of the old bloodline. Although it's mixed with the Malfoys and the Potters."
He drew a reassuring breath and walked the few paces down the corridor to the study Pipsey had assured him Draco was in. He pondered if he should knock but ended up just opening the door. This was an ambush, after all.
Harry felt his ears turn red and he caught a glimpse of Draco's flustered face before he turned away with a cough. "Would that be so bad, then?" Harry asked. "I might find someone to be together with again, you know."
Harry took off his glasses and rubbed his face with both hands. "I knew this was a stupid idea. The most stupid of all stupid ideas," he muttered to himself.
Malfoy had stumbled out of the Floo late last night, dead tired and mumbled something about 'slaughter the yearlings', but Harry couldn't make any sense of it. He was, after all, still on sick-leave and even if Malfoy was involved in some fucked up Dark Art sacrificial ritual, he'd deal with it later. For now, he only wanted to watch him.
"Well, since you stopped talking to me, HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO KNOW?" Potter yelled. He was working himself up now. "Everything is going straight to hell for me. Ginny  HATES me. She threw her famous Bat-bogy hex on me and made me leave the Burrow the day before Christmas. I can't say I blame her, though, since I've been treating her like SHIT, and it's ALL your fault. And since you don't want to see me either, I have absolutely NOTHING, no friends, no home, no family. I spent two and half weeks alone in that dreadful house Sirius left me."
Malfoy leaned closer over the table and lowered his voice. "In here? At a Muggle establishment?" His eyes flickered nervously around. "About the war and the Dark Lord?" he added in a hoarse whisper.
"Mr Malfoy, Mr Potter, please, I must ask you to behave like gentlemen," Slughorn aimlessly called out to the classroom. Draco turned back just in time to see the neglected cauldron boil over and he heard Blaise snigger behind him, "Seems like your little Gryffindor flirt is over, Draco."
His warm breath whiffed over Harry's face. He smelled of the wine, but not sour, only slightly intoxicating. Harry closed his eyes. "Just get on with it then," Harry croaked out through gritted teeth and opened his belt-buckle with shaking hands.
Harry lifted his head and tried to focus on the grey eyes in front of him. He shuddered his shoulders. "I slept bad and I haven't eaten today," Harry said. "Do you want to get out of here before I get thoroughly sloshed?"
Draco looked at it and then met Potter's gaze. "I can't believe this is for real," he said. "None of it."
So, they danced to the sound of the rush of water against the shore, to the faint rustle in the leaves, to the sparkle of the stars and the light of the moon and it was wonderful.
They sat in a booth, Harry and Ginny on one side facing the door, Ron and Hermione on the other, with their Butterbeers, waiting for their food. Ginny eased herself closer to Harry, as she spoke, rather vividly, about last evenings Quidditch practise. Harry put his arm around her and smiled. His heart filled with warmth for her and he was very pleased about buying her a nice present. Ginny was strong and pretty and fun and... safe. Her long red hair swept over his face as she shook her head, as to emphasize what she just said. "Don't you agree, Harry?" She fixed her brown eyes at Harry. He hadn't heard a word of what she'd said.
Blaise's dark eyes narrowed to slight chips of black stone. "Oh, I most certainly would, my friend. But, as you know, there's a price for everything." He leaned back and relaxed his stare. "Even so, this wouldn't reflect too badly on you, you know."
"Send an owl, stop the Prophet from publishing." Potter sat up and looked at him. "Then explain to Astoria. I'm sure she doesn't want this any more than you if she knew. Your father on the other hand..."
Harry reached out and took hold of her other hand. "I took a potion," Harry begun. "There is a baby, Draco's baby." He placed her hand on his small prodruding belly. "I'm pregnant and Draco's the other father."
"What if Malfoy wants this baby? How do we know he's not planning to take it away from Harry once it's born?"
"Obviously." Malfoy rolled his eyes again but hid a smile behind the rim of his cup. "I'll bet he'll be pleasantly surprised."
Seamus and Dean were in Paris, preparing for Dean's exhibition. They'd love for Harry and Ginny to come to the opening next week, though. The new paintings were absolutely spectacular, according to Seamus.
The Healer read from a scroll of parchment, hummed, then attached the scroll to a clip-board and held out his hand. "I'm Healer Kristoffer Towler. It's a pleasure to meet you, Mr Potter. We've recieved an extensive report from the Hogwarts Medi-witch. It's quite an impressive medical history you have there. It seems she's been treating you for something every year you've attended." He walked closer and hummed again. "And then the war on top of that."
"He fainted," Granger said, "on our way to class this morning, and he's not eating properly." She crossed her arms over her chest.
"I met this guy..." Harry started and felt the rush of blood colouring his neck and cheeks. "A couple of weeks after new year's, at Flourish and Blotts." He never mentioned to them that he'd met Malfoy, for some reason he'd kept that to himself all this time. "We… erm… been spending quite a lot of time together. He's been helping me with the house and... such."
"Why wasn't the Ministry informed," Kingsley almost interrupted her, "of your change in your speech? That was a very dangerous situation you just put us in, Harry."
"Harry, he knows. No point in arguing it, is there?" Draco's grey eyes met Harry's. But Harry had no intention to give himself away that easily.
Harry climbed the podium and looked out over the mass of people gathered on the Hogwarts grounds. The remembrance-day of the Battle of Hogwarts drew a crowd every year, but this being the 10th, exceeded them all. There was a mild drizzle in the air, but over the audience a thick protection charm hovered, and from where Harry was standing it looked a little peculiar, even if you were a wizard.
