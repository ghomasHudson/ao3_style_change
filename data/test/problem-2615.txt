Harry rarely ever went clubbing, was the thing. He rarely went anywhere these days.
"It's Tinkerbell that's supposed to be jealous, not Captain Hook," Draco said, tucking his mokeskin pouch beneath his green tunic.
"It's fine, Potter. You are under no obligation to compensate
"So, that's why you were skulking at the bar here. Looking for clues and evidence of my evil deeds."

people that had come tonight. It seemed to be that 'anything went' when it came to a dress code, and for some people everything had indeed gone: in fact it appeared they'd left half of their outfit at home, Harry thought as a bloke walked past him in a cropped hoodie and matching booty shorts.
“I’m not going anywhere until these beds and hedges and this lawn looks like it did this time last year, before you moved in and ruined everything,” Draco snapped.
"Ah. I suppose that could make it harder, yeah." Potter twirled his wand in his fingers. "So, we find you a properly happy memory."

But Harry Potter was waiting for Draco when he finally emerged from that horrid green Wizengamot chamber and casually asked if Draco was hungry and said he knew a nice place close by that did the best chips. And, unbelievably, it was as easy as that just to

"And," Mrs Potts continued, "if I learnt anything from Mistress Molly during my time at the Burrow, it's that one cannot maintain a peaceful and flourishing home and family without help from one's attendant familiars."
Draco's heart swoops, and he rolls on top of Potter, chest to chest, legs to legs, groin to groin. "I do hope you have your wand handy, then, Potter."
"So, you and Harry, then."
“I did wonder if it might be because… well, because of my past allegiance to You Know Who.”
"Quite," Harry agreed, sullenly.
"Alright, sir, you can turn over now."
"Yeah!" James agreed. "We've got a cool idea for our poses." He and Teddy jumped in the air and high-fived.
After a stressful few hours at the hospital and a hastily pulled together dinner where more went on the floor and Teddy's clothes than in his mouth, Draco offered to put Teddy to bed while Harry cleared the spaghetti hoops and buttery toast crumbs and yoghurt splodges from every surface.
And it

Their hands had brushed while reaching for a towel, and Draco jumped at the sudden jolt of pain and snarled "What the fuck?" while Potter just closed his eyes and looked dreamy, before returning to his room without a word.
a first name?
he didn't know about Potter and all his friends—he would have to have a word with Pansy, he relied on her for these things—and worst of all, how could he possibly go out with a man whose favourite cuisine was Chinese takeaway? Those were all things that could not and should not be ignored but, right at that moment, Draco couldn’t find it in himself to care. Harry Potter wanted to take him out to dinner, despite everything.

“I'm sorry, I'm droning on.”

He decided his best bet was to talk to Potter politely to try to find out why he’d let his garden get so bad. He’d explain about the Tidy Streets contest, and Potter would realise the gravity of the situation and get it back to its original state. There was still time for their street to be in with a chance of winning the contest.
Harry felt the frustration in Draco's voice as well as a sharp pang of guilt. "Sorry," he mumbled in reply.
“I’m sorry that it didn’t work out. If you ever want—”
"Well, we can't do

Draco sits down next to him on the rooftop. “It attacks every Lunar New Year and the only things it fears are the colour red and loud cracking noises.” A swish of his wand and the pops and bangs of fireworks burst above their heads. “But you needn’t worry. I’ve got you.”

"W-what?" Potter gave in to the laughter, and Draco narrowed his eyes.
Potter looks as dumbfounded as him, but his expression quickly turns to anger. "I won't be distracted from the fact that you're cursing young adults for the simple crime of being attracted to one another!"
“I look like I swallowed a bloody Quaffle.”
Draco groaned. Dietary requirements complicated things, and he wondered if this was part of the 'test'. Nevertheless, he was hopeful he could handle anything this Epicure threw his way. He nodded and took off his apron, making sure to wipe his hands well. It wouldn’t do to make a bad first impression.

It had always bothered him obviously, but it hadn’t been in the slightest bit necessary for his work at Scents and Sensibility, so he had learned to just accept that he’d never be able to do it.
Potter gives Draco a puzzled look and then crouches down and puts a hand on her arm. "It's okay. We're just trying to find out what happened. Are you saying this curse was on the wards to your room when Trista was still alive?"
Light and dark.
Potter laughed too. “Sounds like someone’s angling for a foot rub.”
His lips were so warm, and soft, like silk, like butter, and tasted of pineapple and salty sweat.
The next morning Harry crept downstairs to make breakfast in bed for Draco. Before long, he had poached eggs on the boil, sourdough bread in the toaster, a bowl of mashed avocado on the counter, and thick rashers of bacon and juicy vine tomatoes finishing under the grill.
“Of course, of course, the Spring Equinox Ball. I’d almost forgotten that it was this weekend. Just a moment, Potter. Do you know, I think that earring would look wonderful worn with your formal robes.”

As the last golden strands of sunlight began to fade and were replaced by various coloured lights from the nearby eateries and other shops, Draco decided to call it a night and head home. He stood, bidding the bartender farewell, Ismaya his name was, as Draco had learned over the past few futile days. He had to raise his voice a little over the steady bass pulse and the repeated question of

. More than Draco had ever imagined he'd be. And Draco finds it hard to articulate any more than that. Being lost for a pithy description of his feelings is a new one for Draco, and ironically he's not sure how he feels about that.
Potter rubbed at the back of his neck and looked around and then sat in a chair at the table.

Draco fixed the pair of them with an icy glare. "Certainly not! Far be it from me to be unhelpful, but if you think I’m going to carry all—"
When he returned Mrs Potts was still missing, and on top of that, Draco was nowhere to be found. After roaming the house to no avail, it wasn't long before he felt the same old resentment brewing. Why should he put up with this bigoted nonsense? He and Mrs Potts had been nothing but polite and lovely since arriving; brief incidences of swearing and pointed grumbling notwithstanding.
Draco raises an eyebrow. "Maybe. Because it certainly couldn't be that you're attracted to me, could it, Potter?"
“Not anymore, though.”
"Everyone
“Bloody hell,” Potter was still swearing away. “How in the name of Merlin’s—”
I’m ready for you to know that.
“I could.”
There was no way Foxglove Close would win the contest with Potter’s garden in such a state. Draco needed to do something, and he needed to do it fast.
Pineneedle sashayed in a few moments later with table four's empty starter plates. “How did it go with the critic?” he asked Draco, looking a little worried. Pineneedle knew how important getting a good review was for the future of the restaurant. He, too, had been there from the very beginning and didn’t want to see the place go under.
“Is he okay?”
“Same? What, mannerly and respectful?”
Draco grimaces. He adores Harry, but he doesn't adore seeing Harry's breakfast moving around inside his mouth. "
Harry stopped them at the kissing gate at the corner of the cemetery and addressed the children. "Now, you've heard the story of what happened to your grandparents. They were so very brave, and they gave their lives to keep me safe. And I know that they would have dearly loved to meet all three of you." He turned to Draco. "And you, Draco, and our little pumpkin you're growing in there." He patted Draco's tummy, and then Lily patted it too, smiling.
Draco hated to admit it, but he was growing rather anxious about Hestia's disappearance. It just wasn't
His ruminations were interrupted by Potter exclaiming, "Oh, I love this one!" and waggling his eyebrows, then singing along with the lyrics: "
And to be honest, he didn't feel too guilty about treating himself, considering that every morning for the past three weeks he’d been virtuously eating the organic muesli that Healer Rorschach had recommended to him for his digestion. Awful stuff it was; it looked like it had been swept off the floor of Hagrid's hut and straight into his bowl—minus the hippogriff droppings, though they might have actually given it a bit of flavour—but, to be honest, it was marginally better than the prune potion which made him gag.

"D'you know, Potter, at her funeral there were only four people? Me, her sister Andromeda, a woman I recognised as a friend of hers that I'd not seen or heard from in ten years, and a Ministry official. I laid my own mother to rest alone, and really at that point I decided there was nothing worth staying in England for."
“Yes, I- Shall we go this route around the pitches and loop around?”
Draco shifted position after a few minutes, and Harry cracked an eye open. People were hurrying past them on their way to work, cutting through the park as a shortcut to… somewhere. A man in a Muggle suit eyed him and Draco with a sniffy disdain. He was so...
“Merlin,” Draco said, monotone. “That is grim. And then you spent your Hogwarts years trying to avoid ‘Death by Gryffindor-ing’.”
Of course, she recognised Grimmauld Place straight away. It had been the primary Black family residence for generations before all that ‘war' unpleasantness had torn the family apart.
Harry looked Malfoy in the eyes. "Can I call you Draco?" Malfoy looked at him in surprise, and Harry felt his face crumple a little. “Oh, shit, I’m-”
"No. Not exactly, but—"
"It feels very possible. God, your hands on me. I think I could feel your magic… entering me." Honestly, Harry felt like it
“Maybe we can sit this one out?”
“Nah, it’s okay. I should stop avoiding talking about it. I don’t know. I can feel the baby moving in me. I know it’s in there. Bloody hell, do I know. I just can’t... connect with it. In my head, it's always ‘the thing’ inside me. It hasn’t hit me really that this thing will be a little person, with a gender, and a personality, and emotions. Malfoy, I can’t even contemplate giving it a name. I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”
“Yeah, I properly went for it there, didn’t I?” Potter grimaced. “You weren’t expecting that much baggage dumped on you, I reckon.”
"Things might be pretty mental for the four of us," Harry mused.
“Right! Of course.”
of training?"
The dimly lit area was filled with people sitting together in small groups or in cross-legged pairs, lounging and talking and touching each other lovingly but not sexually. Across the room a girl with an angelic face stood over a seated guy with vampire incisors and gave him what looked like a chiropractic adjustment, twisting his head, cracking his neck, her cigarette and long earrings dangling over his face.
"Well, sir," Potter says. "Er. We were sure we could figure it out and break the curse and not need to alarm anybody."
“I'll take that,” Draco holds his hand out for Harry's jacket. Then adds. “Nice t-shirt,” and Harry looks down, having lost all memory of what he was wearing.
“I think, yeah, I see what you mean. Your parents did seem a tad…
Jeffrey lets out a soft gasp, visibly trembling under Potter's stern tone. He looks down the hallway, and they follow his gaze, and there's Magister Placid walking towards them looking harried.
"Oi!" Harry's voice came out thick and muffled. "What's going on?"
"Okay," she says in a small voice.
Potter’s eyes widened and he flicked his gaze to Draco’s left arm. “You think the Mark is preventing you…? No, that can’t be.” Potter was shaking his head. “
James delighted in telling Teddy when he came home at mid-term, the day before Halloween, and Teddy's hair turned red with enthusiasm. Lily didn't really know what was going on but she was excited to be going on a family outing. But Draco was worried. He knew he shouldn’t be, but he was. It felt like they would be intruding on Harry’s grief.
“Everything’s fine, thank you. I was just hoping to speak to Potter for a moment but he’s in demand today.”
Very handy for conditioning people against such cravings and infatuations. The Muggles call it Aversion Therapy I believe, and it's a perfectly valid form of—"
“Is it time to go home now?” A cold rock had lodged in Harry’s stomach at the thought.
Draco got dressed and walked outside, resigned to seeing the judges’ disappointed faces. The last thing he thought he would see was Potter’s garden looking immaculate, even better than it had been before he moved in. He couldn’t believe it. The grass had been cut, the weeds were gone and there were colourful flowers bordering the lawn. The buxus had been trimmed into a mercifully un-phallic spiral shape, and there was even a stone birdbath in the centre of the lawn containing a merrily splashing blue tit.
Draco laughed. When had Potter got so deliciously
The brief jolt subsides, and Draco breathes out and strokes his thumb gently over the raised letters on the smooth skin on the back of Potter's hand.
free, but actually, if he thought about it, the very people he'd felt so responsible for were now also free… to make their own mistakes and not worry about Harry Potter swooping in to save them.
“—because at least it’s got them off that blasted Baby Shark."
Of all the people who had a reason to hate Draco, Potter was surely the top of the list. He hadn't seen the man since the day after the trials, when he'd returned Draco’s wand with a handshake and a "that’s for saving my life at the Manor" and not two beats later punched Draco squarely in the jaw, declaring "and that's for being a bastard to everyone I love." Draco had deserved it though, and he’d refused his mother's healing charms, instead watching with morbid fascination as the bruise bloomed and changed—pink to dark purple to green to yellow to brown—over the following days. He was even a little sad when it finally faded away.
Harry groaned. How the fuck had he managed to get himself into this mess within hours of landing on the island?
Once up, Pansy leaned forward to grab Ginny for a kiss, and Draco wobbled with the unexpected weight shift.

The man wasn't wearing his glasses, and he had a short stubbly beard, but he was still unmistakably Potter. And if Draco wasn’t mistaken, that was Cho Chang he was sitting with. Dear Merlin. Were they an item again? Potter had always gone for the athletic Seeker build, so he really didn't know why he was surprised.
out—to the front step, stuck his wand in the air, and moments later boarded the Knight Bus and went home.
He turned and began walking away.
Harry and Draco look at each other and shrug. "Pretty impressive work, Jeff," Potter says. "If you, er, decide not to stay in this cult—"
"Fuck. Actually..."
“And it’s got sparkly green eyes.”
Potter. Draco needed to fix things. Or to try at least. But right now that felt too hard. He wasn't sure how to navigate this thing that had barely begun between them. And he didn't know if or how it would ever really work, them both being who they were. He honestly didn't know if it was worth the heartache of falling for someone all over again.
“Yes, but—”
"A lovable nightmare," Draco concurred. "Now, let's go join our evil clan and watch your Australian wizard movie."
“I felt so much more… charitable towards him. Father and I… well, it’s never been an easy relationship, and I’d despised him at the end, when all came to all. But when I visited him, I genuinely wanted to hear how and what he felt about what he’d done during the war. Without judging or making him out to be wrong, just
Madam Kite entered the room just then. “Ah good, you’re awake.” She began casting, muttering incantations and gliding her wand in the air over Harry’s legs and stomach. She Vanished the gooey bandages, declared the poison to be all gone, then dealt with the bruising on Harry’s forehead with an efficient swirl of her wand.
Harry hadn’t realised he’d groaned out loud until Malfoy laughed, “Yes, Potter, me too. Let’s take a break, chill out. I’ll get us some water.”
"Malfoy?" he croaked out, staring up from the floor. His head was pounding and his eyes stung from tears and the abrupt influx of light. Harry cleared his throat. "What

"So you'd planned this?" Potter smiled.

“Potter, do you have a moment?” Draco said, and Potter stopped walking and turned to him.
"Remind me why we're dressing as Dementors again?" Gregory frowned.
Hestia jolted violently in his grip. Cold water splashed across the counter, showering Mrs Potts. She yelped, jumping backward reflexively and sending her own lid skidding across the countertop into the base of a plant.
"Absolute piffle!" Hestia puffed. "The temperature of the water is the most crucial part. I'll have you know..."
Both appliances whistled meekly.

“Well, I never,” Potter replied. "So, you're the legendary Marco Floyd. You look so… different. I almost didn't recognise you with the..." and he gestured to his own beardy chin.
If you haven’t read the fic then you are in for the best treat ever (not counting Kreacher’s homemade scones, of course).
“I’ve been thinking about it. And you and Molly, you were right,” Harry announced when came downstairs after a three-hour sleep. Draco had busied himself while Harry was taking a recuperating nap, and set about the task of clearing up Harry’s house and making it more baby-friendly. He used all the spells he could think of, and a fragrant room spray of his own design, to declutter and clean, and before long had the place looking, and more importantly
He's jolted awake though by Potter stuttering, "W-what?" And Draco realises Potter’s fingers have frozen in place in his hair.

owl). At least he tells himself he’s used to it, but there are days when Potter catches him on the back foot, like yesterday morning when he called on Draco for his opinion. When Draco entered Potter's room there he was, bold as brass, twisting and turning in nothing but the skimpiest of briefs (knickers, really, Draco thought, high-cut on the leg with a mere triangular scrap of cotton clinging for dear life to his buttocks) and asking Draco if his bum looked big in them. Potter actually had to ask three times, in fact (the third time with the beginnings of a raised eyebrow), because Draco was hopelessly distracted from coherent thought by the unbearable pertness of Potter’s arse. Unbearable! Too much to
“Malfoy,” he said. “I— What are you doing here?”
“You’re barmy,” Potter said. “All this for a stupid contest.”
It was as if there was some filmy barrier obscuring the scene before him. Like peering through a frosted window. Or, like he'd not got his glasses on. No. A quick prod to his face told him it wasn't that.
“Vanadium?” he asked, already knowing the answer. Despite the heat of the day, the ring was cool in his hand. That was one of the peculiar properties of the metal, almost impossible to counterfeit.
“Yes, sir. And those are genuine goblin emeralds as well.”
"I think I've let a lot more slip tonight than I'd planned," Draco said.
Written for @drarrymicrofic prompt "Flood".
First there was a round of introductions which was blessedly quick; Draco couldn’t have endured a long, drawn out ‘ice-breaking’ session. There were three gay couples and a straight couple. The very attractive Sam and Francesco introduced themselves first. It turned out that the dad-to-be Sam was the younger brother of Oliver Wood and was as ruggedly handsome as his brother, albeit with a slighter build. Jericho and Laurence were an older couple, both in their sixties and expecting their first child, having found each other later in life. They spoke so emotionally that Draco felt his eyes prickle. Neil and Langston were newlyweds, and Draco was most interested to learn that Langston was Minister Shacklebolt’s nephew. Langston certainly had the same intimidatingly capable look about him, and he seemed fiercely protective of Neil. Eoin and Allison were the final couple, young and cheerful and grinning, and Draco wondered why Eoin was carrying rather than Allison, but they didn’t offer up any explanation, and he certainly wasn’t going to pry.
"Muggle artefact!" Draco screeched. "Hestia is a highly

strong," Potter exhaled loudly beside him, finally breaking the silence. "Good, though."
"Not at all," Draco admitted. And it mortified him quite a bit to lay out his shortcomings like this, especially to Potter, but he'd learnt over the years that humble pie only tasted bitter on the first bite. "And yes, I know what to do. The theory I know, only too well." He thought of the hours he'd spent researching and researching. "It's just the execution I can't seem to get right."
"This is my flat, you ungrateful bastard. I could turf you out."
“For not replying to your owl. I just wanted a bit of time to think about things. I- I suppose I felt foolish for thinking that we were... that we were maybe going to be... a thing.”
Draco couldn’t believe he’d been thinking about kissing Potter a few minutes ago. What a fool he was. He strode out—alright,
Draco whips out his wand and casts Expelliarmus, but Magister's Placid's wand doesn't fly towards him. Instead it sails right into Jeffrey's outstretched hand.
Even though it was Draco’s suggestion to meet at his place for a cuppa, questions treadmill through Harry’s mind. What will he do if Draco thinks it was a mistake to kiss him?
She began ushering Granger towards the door, all the while Granger pleading. Draco’s petty thrill at her being turned away soon turned sour when he caught the look of devastation in Granger’s large brown eyes.
guest towels—trying for Potter's sake to be as discreet as possible about the reason. He really didn't know why he'd bothered, or why after all these years, his logical brain still failed whenever Potter was involved.
? You had time to talk about Martin Miggs, for Merlin’s sake. You were in there for over an hour!”
"Ah, right. Hmm." And to Draco's dismay, Harry looked at his watch and said, "I'm going out today for a bit, lads, if that's okay."
Potter pulls away, and takes Draco's hand, and then walks them over to his big unmade bed, the one he'd clearly been lying naked in when Draco called. He pushes Draco back onto the mattress and straddles him. Draco can't even appreciate the vision of thick muscled thighs and the outline of what's clearly straining beneath Potter's underpants, because his mind is still racing around trying to piece together all they've just confessed.
They walked along Brixton Hill and Harry felt a shiver of wards as they passed into the Muggle side of town. People with headphones and Discmans hurried by them, some with large sunglasses and flared jeans, some with long skirts and tattoo chokers, every one of them toting a large takeaway coffee cup.
There’s always music playing, mostly grime and hip hop that Draco doesn’t particularly care for, and CDs strewn about
Potter scoffed. “I just knew you'd be the type to focus all your attention on my front garden and completely ignore my back garden. I do keep it quite tidy round there, I'll have you know. If you really want a closer look, you only need to ask.” Potter smiled cheekily, and Draco grit his teeth to stop himself from spewing insults. “I’m late for work, see you later, Malfoy.” And he spun in place and disappeared with a sharp snap.
But Malfoy shouted, "Hey, Potter," over the din of the music, as if Harry was just anyone, and in fact Harry had never actually heard Malfoy say 'hey' to anyone, ever—it had always been ‘hullo’ to his friends, and a stiff ‘Potter’ or ‘good afternoon’ to Harry the occasional times they’d encountered each other since Hogwarts—and Harry thought ‘hey’ sounded really nice shouted in Malfoy’s aristocratic voice. Malfoy was smiling, on the edge of laughing. All sweaty and pink-cheeked, with fluorescent teardrops painted on his cheeks.
But at least sewing was something Draco could do at night when he couldn’t sleep, something that wouldn’t disturb the patrolling Death Eaters or make anyone worry about him. He repaired robes and gloves and breeches for his father, for the other Death Eaters, for Voldemort. But he also discreetly smuggled a shawl he'd patchworked to a shivering Luna Lovegood, and later, in the quiet of his bedroom, Draco repaired the dark green pullover that had got torn when Dean was captured by the Snatchers. Risking everything, but determined to copper-fasten his allegiances in his own mind, even if it came to naught, he embroidered a small silver stag on the inside of the neckline of Dean's jumper.
“Why, I’m a generous and kind individual. Don’t scoff! Granted, I may have been friends with some murderers in the recent past, but I’m reformed. I am! And I’ll take this opportunity to apologise for being horrid to you. What’s that? Oh… and to your Gryffindors.”
he care what Potter was doing here?
One of the things the residents of Upper Itchington particularly enjoyed was a contest, be it the best Victoria sponge, or the largest marrow, or the bonniest baby. But there was one contest, held every Midsummer’s day, that was especially popular: the tidiest and most charming street. There was even a highly-coveted prize.
“I’m awfully sorry, darling. I got so distracted by the biscuits and his charming chitchat,” Pansy said. “I could go back in now and say it to him if you want?”
“But you’re up next,” Potter reminded him.
Not to be shown up, Harry stepped into the cellar, lighting his wand. "Prat," he grumbled as he passed.
"What do you bloody mean by that?"
Potter moved his arm again, twisted it and clasped Draco's hand in his. "Thank you, Malfoy. I mean it."
"Really, really good,” Harry said. He took Luna's hand. “Luna. Ginny. Draco and I... we're friends now. Right, Draco?"
Draco found his voice. “What the
“Gentlemen!” called Fordus. “If I can have your attention, I’m about to go through general healthcare pointers for wizards in their final trimester. Ah, have you two met before?”
“Harry! Don’t give him ideas!” Allison laughed.
“What does it mean?” Draco asked. “Eww, and the bandages,” he added, noticing they were soaked with a dark purple ooze. “We ought to call for Madam Kite.”
"You two okay?" Luna asked, talking to Draco but stroking Harry's back. They broke apart, blinking.
And then Potter begins to laugh. Or giggle really.
Though… as they all stepped through the Floo into a pumpkin-and-zombie-themed Shell Cottage, Draco couldn't help himself—he was already planning their outfits for Christmas… and Merlin, wouldn't Harry look amazing in white fur?
Draco nodded. "Yes, Harry, this is Hestia. She's been in my mother's family for many years and is very dear to me." He gently stroked the handle of the appliance. "Hestia, this is Harry Potter and he's come to live with us."
"I know," Draco said. "I know what you want to say. I already know."
Potter swallowed down his dry mouthful, and then took a quick sip of pumpkin juice. “Ah. Do you? Can I ask—”
"Off you go, then," said Potter. And Draco was just about to say the incantation, when he felt a jerky movement from Potter's stomach. "Oof, sorry, you probably felt that. Merlin, that was a hard kick."
“Oh, I’m sorry, I’m interfering.”
Potter looked back at him, eyes stony. "No. No, I don't think I will. Apologies for interrupting. Best of luck to you both."
happy, thank you, Potter," Draco gushed, and then pulled himself together. "I knew if I persevered you'd see sense. And, if we win, I'll invite you over for dinner to thank you, and we can gloat together over the look on Smith's face," Draco promised.
“Oh my god, shut up, this is getting worse.” Draco pulled away from him. “Now, drink your tea, I have to show you something. I hope you’ll like it.”
For the last week Hermione had prattled on about Bali definitely being a worthwhile destination. He'd learned her parents had gone there several times while they were living in Australia. And a few times more since they'd returned to England. According to Hermione, it was a very popular tourist destination for people who were looking for an inexpensive way to unwind and rediscover themselves (she ignored Harry's crude quip that he already

, let's just say Harry's extremely glad he's wearing his smart black pulling pants (and not the faded orange ones with the Snitches).
Draco pulled himself free of Harry and curled over onto his side, pressing his head silently into Harry’s rising and falling chest, cuddling in. A comfortable silence descended, and he slid his hand down Harry’s stomach, fingers gentle, and closed his eyes, overwhelmed with exciting new feelings for Harry, and also with tiredness.

Then Draco sat back, eyes closed, and let the smoke trickle upwards from his lips, over his pointy nose, a nose Harry was finding inordinately lovely, over the yellow and turquoise teardrops on his cheeks, over his closed eyes with dark lines where eyeshadow had gathered in the creases. Harry was transfixed.
His eyes keep catching on a phrase: '
The curse

"Yes," he laughed, ruffling Al's mop of curls. "Dolores, too." At least James had accepted Draco's suggestion of a name; wicked really, but worth it—according to his husband—to see Minerva's open glee when she'd heard.
“You do remember that I’m the same Draco Malfoy who used to terrorise you when we were at Hogwarts? And insult your friends? And who sided with the Dark Lord?” Bringing it up was probably not the cleverest idea, but Draco wanted to make sure Potter wasn’t sleepwalking during some sort of fever dream.
"Ah, Madam… Kite," Granger said, peering at the woman's badge. And then said, “
Two days had since passed, and Draco was beginning to feel rather stupid. He'd hoped that Potter would have come to find him by now, but he was running out of ideas as he sat at the same beachside pop-up bar for the third evening in a row with the sun casting long shadows from behind the trees on the shore and the ubiquitous dance music steadily growing in volume.
“No, Daphne told me. She said it curls all the way up his ear. It's so weird. Potter's become very, I don’t know,
Harry took a gulp from his bottle of Bintang and then bit into a crunchy

A deluge of pleasure up his spine, and he's dimly aware of a pressure in his pelvis. When he comes back into his head, Potter's buried in him balls deep, an arm around his waist barely holding him up

I sort of love it. I love my round belly, how it looks, how it feels, rubbing apricot oil or cocoa butter into my skin. It... I don’t know... it makes me happy. Is that... odd?”

Draco hadn't really thought about
"And with that, sirs," said Kreacher, motioning them toward the table, "it is most important that you are sitting, eating and enjoying a delightful cup of tea."
, thought Draco as the team left the building. He was certain that Chang had got horribly ill because of his food, and his reputation would be ruined forever.
Naturally he was nervous too. Bringing up a child by himself wouldn’t be easy. He’d never known anyone that had been raised by a single parent. It wasn’t the pureblood way. But he had support from Mother, and Blaise and Pansy, and of course Greg, though he was little use, except possibly to do a portrait of them. One of those arty black and white father and baby poses perhaps, all muscles and soft lighting.
"That's the drawn-out poison that you managed to get yourself stung with," Draco said. "You gave us such a bloody scare, you git. And made me miss the last baby class, including a talk on baby's first bowel movements. I may never forgive you."
Draco had nothing against Potter. Not any more. Nine years had passed since the Battle of Hogwarts, and the interactions they’d had since then had been polite and blessedly brief—mostly consisting of small talk at charity functions and various 'family' occasions (such as Blaise and Luna's wedding)—though there

—because of who he lost Malfoy to.
They said goodbye to Eoin and Allison, and Draco couldn’t have sworn it but it looked like Allison winked at Potter.
Potter wondered if it was something about Draco’s wand and gave it a test with a couple of simple spells, Lumos and Leviosa, and then
"So, wait. You do fancy—"
Draco looked away, clearing his throat. "Speaking of kettles, where is Hestia?"
Potter looked up from his menu. From the second they locked eyes, Draco knew: Potter recognised him. If Potter’s green eyes opened any wider, he’d be mistaken for a Mooncalf. And just like that, any hope of pretending not to know Potter evaporated, together with his dream of getting a good review.
And that was his excuse. For everything that came after.
“Oh right, sorry about that.” Harry looked around the room in confusion. “So. Er. What exactly did I do?”
Harry arranged all the kids' flowers, plus his lilac asters and Draco's blue delphiniums, into a big bouquet, conjured a white ribbon to tie them, and together they trudged through the quiet village towards the little cemetery, the kids kicking piles of wet leaves as they went. It’d be baths for them all before they went out to Bill and Fleur’s this afternoon, Draco made a mental note to remember.
To say the situation rose to a rapid boil would be an understatement.
Draco's toothbrush wobbles in mid-air and then falls to the ground, bristles-down in the carpet, and Draco's mind oscillates wildly between thoughts of
meant.
"I- I-" Draco stammered. "I think you're drunk, Harry Potter. We've only just met… after not seeing each other for the best part of five years. And before that we were hardly on friendly terms. Why on earth would you—"
And Draco said, "Yes," and smiled back at Harry just as big and unselfconsciously, because actually it was.
"Toodle pip," said Draco. "See you both on Sunday."
“My god, look at you, you're huge!” Gabriel said, gawking at Draco’s bump. Draco couldn’t move his throat let alone form words. “Well? Aren’t you going to ask me in?”
"You snogged me back, you prat! And yes, as a matter of fact, I'd love one."
Draco takes a large breath. "We're still cursed."
"I'll not hear a word against the man, be he Wizard, Muggle, Goblin or otherwise—” Draco declares.
“It looks perfect, Draco,” Harry said as he walked around the room. He trailed his fingers along the light ash of the cot rail, then picked up a bright fabric covered rattle.
“There you bloody are!”

Draco draws Harry close as bright colours arc above them.

“Thank you, Uncle Draco.” Teddy ran his hands over the stitches. “Mr Gnome is my only friend,” he admitted quietly, and his little cheeks flushed, and his hair turned the same sandy-brown as Professor Lupin's had been.
“Malfoy!” he cried.
"Are we?" Harry said sleepily, laying his head back on the pillow. "We're not at the Manor though. Can't I just have five more minutes? M'cosy."

Draco shook his head and dragged a startled Pineneedle to a quiet corner of the kitchen.
“Who but me is going to defend you against the terrible Nian monster?”
. Everything was a jumble of boxes and badly folded fabrics, and there’d been no attempt to make it look anything other than a spare room. So he’d used a little magic, bit of transfig here, a few charms there, and made a fairly decent fist of it if he said so himself.
Draco appears in the room, moments later, wearing a sensible maroon polo shirt and dark blue jeans and stripy green socks. This is
"Cool? COOL?!" a high-pitched voice said. "I'll have you know I'm quite the opposite, young man. I have never delivered anything short of piping hot water to my masters and mistresses in 75 years." A sharp blast of steam emitted from the spout of the kettle to punctuate the statement.
It seems nothing will relieve the burning.
Merlin, it had been a day, he thought, walking the narrow pathway from the street back down to the beach. And it wasn't over yet. He had three more hours until sunset, three more hours to comb the beaches for custom, before he could head home to his small flat in the centre of Denpasar and have a much-needed shower, light a few incense sticks and read another chapter of his book.
tight. He didn’t want to hurt him. But Harry squeezed back and Draco was overcome with relief that he really was okay. Reluctantly he stepped back to let Granger smother him in kisses too.
Five days before his departure date, Harry was debating changing his tickets to
Draco laughed in disbelief. “That’s the best I’ve managed… ever. It’s not enough, of course—”
Draco smiles. "Because I've got a wand at your throat and I'm not afraid to use it. We're authorised to use 'reasonable force', and today, the definition of reasonable is nice and slack." Draco presses the tip of his wand more firmly into Placid's neck to emphasise his words. The Magister's Adam's apple bobs sharply, and he shifts against his bindings.
"Kreacher!" Harry took a step towards the indistinct blob that was his old house-elf. There was a time when he'd have recoiled from the shrivelled, wrinkly and frankly cantankerous old elf, but right now he couldn't be more relieved to see him. Harry had actually grown rather fond of Kreacher. The old house hadn't been the cheeriest of places, but at least once he and the elf began to sort out their differences and agreed a division of labour in the house—working hours were agreed for Kreacher, and Harry was strictly forbidden to cook or clean during those hours—it had sort of felt like home, or rather like he was actually welcome in his own home. Finally tearing down Walburga's shouty portrait had helped in that respect, and after all the spells Hermione had tried—even the

“I came to thank you.”
“Oh. Thanks, it’s a Muggle band, Pulp, er, it’s their Different Class album cover.”

“Yes!” cried Potter and squeezed Draco’s hand.
"Umm," Potter mumbles, scratching his cheek. Draco wants to scratch his own, but resists.

So in the morning, at Bullshit o'Clock, he made the short Apparition jump to Highbury-Islington station for the Overground to Stratford, changing for the Docklands Light Rail and finally arriving at London City airport. Then onto the first of three flights: London City to Doha (
Harry stared at the now empty counter. "Where's she gone?" he snapped. "Oh bloody hell Malfoy! That was mean, even for you!"
The dog barked silently then loped away and vanished seconds later.
thrown them together on a disproportionate number of occasions).
Why, he wondered, had Malfoy come looking for him after that embarrassing debacle? No doubt to complain about his behaviour just as everyone seemed to be doing these days. Harry's face burned thinking about how Malfoy had oiled him up and rubbed him down and made him so very bloody turned on. And then he'd done a runner and Malfoy had bloody well come after him. How had Malfoy even known where he was staying? That was suspicious in itself. There was something going on, Harry was sure of it. He just had to figure out what.
"You are, darling, aren't you?" Pansy said. She got up and kissed Harry on the cheek.
Thankfully, Pineneedle seemed to have understood the seriousness of the situation and nodded. “I’ll try my best, but you know how much critics like to talk to the head chef. I don’t think you’re going to be able to avoid him all evening. Maybe throw in a free bottle of wine once he realises it’s you?” he suggested.
By the time they reached the end of their loop around the park their pace had slowed considerably, and they were both out of breath. And as usual, Draco’s feet were killing him. They weren’t far from Draco’s flat so they walked the short distance along Bethnal Green Road, stopping briefly for a takeaway tea from Fuckoffee’s.
His emotions are scattered and fierce:
feel a little ashamed at his outburst, but really, did Harry need to be so rude? And well, hadn't he and Hestia had become accustomed to doing things a certain way, and if Harry wanted to go and fly his broom for the next three hours, who was Draco to stop him? To be honest, stewing for a bit might be just what he needed.
In the morning Draco jerks awake with the realisation he's pressed chest to chest with Potter. He must have turned over in his sleep. The flood of relief, both in his own body and radiating from the still-sleeping Potter, is all kinds of intense.
trip. He doesn’t feel quite so wary around people, or intimidated. He’s beginning to feel a bit more… sure of himself, and there’s definitely been a growing resolve. A desire to share with others, a desire to be involved with people, a desire to maybe let someone into his heart.
Hours after that the feeling of their accidental contact was still persisting, a low tingling sensation on Draco's skin that developed into a very unpleasant itch the following morning.
Draco pauses the kiss to whisper, “I’m sorry, are you sure you—” and Harry answers by kissing him more and walking him back against the speckled granite worktop. Harry kisses him and kisses him and then presses their foreheads together and says in a hoarse whisper, “Maybe we could...” fingers playing at the waistband of those sensible jeans, and Draco licks his bottom lip, and his face is still a bit blotchy, and he says, “Yes, please” and then,
Potter laughed delightedly, causing several heads to turn and shoot them filthy looks. Laurence looked particularly annoyed and Draco could see that Jericho’s cheeks were wet with tears.
cocktails a young Balinese lad at a pop-up bar had been feeding him earlier, all combined to make a heady holiday feeling. The sun was warming his naturally tanned skin, and his mind was emptying slowly of all responsibilities. Within a short while, thoughts of case files and stakeout protocols had faded completely into dreams of blue skies and surfer guys.
She'd attempted to scream for help as she was grasped firmly by the handle, but the air had barely left her spout when she was pulled into the unmistakable twist of Apparition.
of sorts into the house of that Malfoy lad, he had made it sound so wonderful. A delightful terrace cottage in a magic-friendly village, with a lovely private garden overlooked from the kitchen windows. It sounded a lot like the Burrow, and they had both been sure it would make a vast improvement on the dank and cramped chambers of Grimmauld Place.
seen Potter’s body before. He found he could not stop staring at his prominent collarbones, or the scarred planes of his ribcage, and that he was helpless to avoid his gaze sliding down to the obscenely sharp v-cut of Potter's pelvis. Things were made worse when Potter turned to get something from the fridge, back muscles shifting as he reached for something on a low shelf. That morning Draco had to back out of the kitchen to get a large gulp of air.
Healer Thornberry tells them it's very likely a type of Equilibrium curse. That the constant itch and burn compels them to touch, that when they touch one will feel pain and the other pleasure, and that on touching the pendulum swings the other way, reversing the effects for the affected persons.
He rolled around in those thoughts for a while.
"Janky will pass the Master's message along," he confirms with a small bow and then Disapparates with a snap.
So when Luna and Ginny dragged him along to Stasis—a nightclub in a tiny wizarding enclave around the corner from Brixton tube station—with pleas of
“I’d do you too, Potter…
Draco’s shoulders slumped. Why did he think it would make any difference if Potter was there. He wasn’t telling Draco anything he didn’t already know.
“Oh, fuck off, now you sound like Molly.”
“Loon, I think the blokes want to be left alone.” Ginny waggled her eyebrows pointedly.
Draco continued to giggle, and Harry felt his face heat. "Oh no. Oh no no
. Yes. There's every possibility..."

Draco sagged back against a table. “You don’t know how much of a relief that is to hear.”
Along the way Draco asked something that had been niggling him for a while.
sorry?" Draco said. "Why?”
Harry disappeared momentarily, and returned with a large white and gold porcelain teapot, with a pattern of twisting flowers and leaves around the body. "Hestia, meet Mrs Potts! My faithful teapot, and a gift from Molly and Arthur. She's sentient too and makes the most wonderful tea!" Harry placed Mrs Potts on the counter and pushed her gently forward. "Say 'hello', don't be shy now."
"Yeah, and I can't claim the thought didn't cross my mind. Being a single dad isn't quite how I imagined my life going. Never mind the press are going to have a field day when it gets out."
Draco erupted in laughter, flopping back onto the bed, and Harry enjoyed the mirthful echo of it in the room, not to mention the view of Draco's shuddering midriff where his t-shirt had ridden up.
"Do you think? He looks a bit like—"
'Go on,' Weasley said. 'It's ok.'
A narrow stony path took them to the neatish rows of headstones and stelae and tomb lids, some new and smooth with sharp inscriptions, some rough and weatherworn and tilting at all angles. There appeared to be an enchantment keeping all the graves free from autumn leaves, and they lay in piles at the foot of each one, like small proud mottes.
And that's when Harry went and made things worse, Draco informed him later.
"Trust in Kreacher," he grinned—a truly unnerving sight to behold—and he began to outline a plan.
Posted: 24 July 2021
Potter removed his ghastly cap and set it on the table and then proceeded to stick both of his hands into his rather long hair and ruffle it wildly, then try to tame it down a bit with his palms. Draco was a little bit charmed by the idea of Potter not wanting to have hat hair, about him perhaps wanting to look
"You've always been a stupid spiteful bitch, Draco. I used to find it cute but it's just fucking pathetic now."
, more likely.
"Yeah," Draco agreed. "Although…" He swallowed. "Although I found I actually wanted to… with you."
And Draco's back to replaying it all in his head again. They'd gone for dinner that evening like Potter proposed, to a little Italian place on Diagon, with naught but pizza and pasta on the menu, and not a sausage and onion stew in sight, much to Draco's relief. They shared a bottle of Montepulciano and a large Quattro Stagioni pizza, and because it was a work night and they'd had a long day (not to mention two orgasms) (or three in Draco's case, he thought, remembering the shower wank, but he kept that to himself), they went their separate ways after paying the bill—but not before a long, slow and very deep kiss against a lamppost, after which Draco pretended not to notice Potter adjusting himself as he said goodbye and Apparated away.
“You’re supposed to be critiquing restaurants, not going out on dates with the owners.”
Draco took a deep breath and looked Potter in the eyes. “I would love to.”
Hermione had insisted that the mode of transport was all part of the plan, and just the beginning of the relaxation, that it was going to be cathartic and enjoyable, that he could read a book or have a long sleep. Or both.
Draco had tried the wand out for himself in the privacy of his flat—because
They begin watching Midsomer Murders and it isn't long before Draco is shuffling a little closer to lean his shoulder against Potter's. They do this. All the better to exchange commentary on the program and give each other little nudges and digs when appropriate. The glass of wine Potter put out for him has been drunk and Draco’s starting to feel a wee bit blurry around the edges. The show is a repeat that Draco’s seen before but he’s decided not to say so, because it means that he doesn’t need to concentrate too hard on the plot. He puts his head on Potter’s shoulder and closes his eyes briefly. They do that as well now.
good, it
So, for the first time in years, Harry decided to just let the world be, for now; let it lie where it lay. Just... put it down.  He'd been trying to hold it up, trying to keep it in place, for so very long. He realised how
He closed the doors and wandered around the room, grazing his fingers over all the surfaces. He went through a doorway into a very well-appointed kitchenette, shiny with chrome and lacquered surfaces, and poured himself a glass of water.
“Come, you dingus, let’s sit down. Fuck all this whataboutery. Tell me what
And it was dark. So dark. The air felt stuffy. Claggy, almost.
Draco was proud to say that his street, Foxglove Close, was always one of the prettiest, and took any opportunity to talk about it. Everyone on the croquet team, in the gobstones club and even at the bingo hall had heard all about how Draco and his neighbours had won the prize three years running. It was no secret that Foxglove Close was aiming to make it four in a row, and Draco just

He was staring into the bottom of his second, or third, Banana Hammock cocktail—spiced rum, banana syrup, lime juice and just a dash of bitters, in a glass rimmed with brown sugar—and there was still no sign of Potter. It had been a relatively slow day on the beach, and he'd tried again to make subtle conversation with some of the other locals to see if they'd seen Potter around. He had received a few raised eyebrows and knowing smiles for his enquiries, but no useful information. He knew that his interest in this mystery man would be the height of tomorrow's gossip, if it wasn't already.
"I don’t know," said Potter. His face was open and kind.
big thorns. I don’t trust Dad’s Healing spells.”
"You may be made of copper," said Draco waspishly to his kettle, sipping his tea, "but you've got quite the brass neck."
Placid nods in acceptance, and Draco hands him his wand. The Magister grits out a Finite Incantatem, and a stream of blue magic engulfs Draco where he's crouching, before floating upwards to surround Potter.
. At another they were kissing with tongues in the queue for the unisex loos, a tall muscly woman telling them they were a perfect couple. And there was definitely a point where they had their shoes off and were dancing to the Bee Gees in a cosy carpeted side-room under a row of twinkling disco balls.
Harry hummed in reply, "Give me the works, yeah?"
Draco moans, shocked, “Oh fuck.”

And once Potter had become Harry, Draco had felt the threads of his life start pulling together, one by one, and he had a hope that he might one day feel one pull tight and realise that they created a tapestry that he could be proud of.
Harry slammed the door to his villa behind him, grateful at last for the smallest amount of privacy. He pressed his still oil-slicked back into the smooth painted surface of the door and slid slowly to the floor, willing his breathing to steady and his heart to stop shuddering in his chest.
He feels Potter’s arm which had been draped across the back of the sofa move infinitesimally and just barely land on his shoulders, and he opens his eyes and stiffens for a split second only to relax again into its warmth and security. They do this, too, sometimes. All the better to get comfy and relaxed.
And now, holding a ring that looked like it could be an heirloom of Salazar Slytherin with its magnificent deep green and brooding grey, he allowed his sibylline senses to open wider than usual, flooding his mind with images: Harry’s tearful smile as Draco offered him the ring and asked Harry to bond with him; the deluge of love pouring into Draco’s mind as Harry made his declaration of commitment in front of their friends and family; the exquisite and overwhelming raw connection as they moved together as one, rocking in unison, coming in tandem, sealing their bond forever; both of them walking hand in hand on a pebbly beach, grey-haired, trousers rolled up to their knees, and laughing, laughing, laughing.
Draco feels the prickle of a light Protego, and he's momentarily awed by Potter's ability to exercise such subtlety. He's grateful for the protection too, and he fights to keep the fond smile from his face at Potter's neverending thoughtfulness.
“Yes, thank you Potter. I’m aware just how handsome he is… he is a model after all.”
"Shush, shush, shush!" Harry hissed. "Trying to make a pot of tea for Draco,
Right now though? He was still half in shock.
, Potter. They gave me the things I wanted. It’s… it’s not the same. Don’t get me wrong; I had a charmed childhood… toys and sweets and elves doing my bidding and Princess Kitty Sunshine, but—”
Walking into the kitchen, he saw Tiptoe and Titpie plating the fish and smiled. They really had come a long way in ten months (they'd never so much as cast a boiling charm on an egg when they started), and he felt lucky to have such a dedicated team, not least to have his back while he dealt with Potter-slash-Epicure outside.

She turned to look at the teapot, just as Harry and Draco turned to look at each other, mouths agape.
. The best amenities you could hope for were a working kettle and a few dusty tea-bags or sachets of instant coffee. And there was seldom time for relaxation or sight-seeing, much less anything else.
“Yes! The potion... it just, it makes people so touchy… so tactile? Everything feels so soft and amazing.“ Draco looked Harry in the eyes, and Harry admired the thin silver ring of his irises. “Would it be okay if I... hugged you? You won’t believe how good it feels. I don’t know about you, but I need it. And I think that maybe you do too. Is that… would that be alright?”
In any case, she now found that she was in the mortifying position of having to ingratiate herself with one Mrs Potts. And if that wasn't the most ridiculous name too! Why did she deserve an honorific in place of a first name? Did she even
Harry brought the teas to the sunny spot Draco had snagged on the pavement outside, and Draco dragged his chair around the little table and pushed it right up against Harry's.

Draco laughed, and felt something loosen in his chest. "It is rather insane, isn't it?"
Draco’s words shook Potter out of his stupor, and he hurried to the kitchen door to hold it open so that Chang’s limp body could pass through.
Draco's annoyed, frankly, that Potter's been so reluctant to get this curse or whatever it is sorted. He knows Potter likes them to solve things themselves—they're a really good team, the two of them, skillsets matched perfectly—but this seems overly stubborn, even for Potter.
