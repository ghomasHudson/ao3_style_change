Harry pulled away first, breathing heavily. Draco looked exactly the same, panting a little, skin flushed, eyes bright. “Fucking hell.” Harry breathed.
Draco didn’t say anything, staring wide eyed at their hands.
“No, it doesn’t. But we both know what good you can do, and if bigots keep believing in the past rather than the present, then let them. I’ll still be here.”
“Thank you Harry, you’re a good lad.”
“Oh! I’m so sorry!” Draco ignored him, turning to Potter. “Harry this is Balveer, Balveer, this is Harry Potter.”
"Nah." Harry gave a watery chuckle, knocking shoulders with him. "I'm only joking."
“I’m not. You don’t need to be so defensive.” Why were Gryffindor’s so quick to jump to conclusions?
Harry grimaced. “No thanks, I’m sick of talking about all this shit.”
“How do you...want to do this?” Draco asked.
"What would you prefer? Want me to push you up against a wall with my fists in your robes like we're back at Hogwarts?" Draco choked on his drink, an all too enticing image dancing in his mind.
Harry sighed and shook his head, moving onto the tomatoes. A sharp snap sounded across the room, and then Kreacher’s long, bony fingers were sliding the packet of cheese across the counter towards him.
Harry was silent, taking it all in. First Hermione, now Neville. Could it all be true? Surely not. Malfoy had still been rude to Harry twice this year already. But then again, had Harry not started it, both times? It was too much to take in, too much to absorb, this potentially new Malfoy.
The shop was lined with shelves holding jars and drawers, bottles and plants, cauldrons and books. Candles floated just above head level much like in the Great Hall at Hogwarts, and a curtained off area in the far corner held a sign that read “consultation room”. It felt welcoming, surprisingly so for a shop. The whole place was empty, except for a cat lounging on the counter to Harry’s right, next to the till.
Harry sat at the counter. "Biscuits."
"No problem, Harry. I was just enjoying the sunshine." Luna smiled, her face turned up to the spring sun. It was the warmest it had been in months, the sun beating down. Maybe he should've worn shorts, Harry thought, feeling the sweat starting to form on his forehead - or was that just from the anxiety? Merlin, he hated stuff like this - there were bound to be reporters. At least he was with Luna; she had a way of reassuring people even when she didn't say anything.
“Merlin, mate. That’s one messed up owl.” Ron said, shaking his head as he held out his arm for Pig. He was referring to Alfie for once, who was sitting rather happily on his perch just a few feet away, seemingly unaware of the effect his magic was having.
The Gryffindor thought over his argument with Malfoy, and the one before that, and the one before that… “Is it bad that I quite enjoy being angry?” He leant closer, his voice low. “The arguments, the adrenaline.”
Malfoy watched him leave, both angry and embarrassed. He hadn’t meant to upset him that much, just add a little tension. Maybe he should have settled for the banter. The bastard hadn’t even let him finish what he was going to say.
Barely a minute later, Kreacher’s voice called out again. "Master, Mr Malfoy is being quite insistent-"
“You’re going to cause a scene, Draco.” Harry hissed, stepping closer as the witches and wizards around them stopped to watch.
Harry stared back into the silver orbs, conflicted. After a long moment, he spoke. “Am I next?”
He was greeted by the eerie silence of Harry's apartment, and the thrilling view of his coffee table. "Harry?" he called and watched as a pair of legs wandered in, crouching down to reveal a rather disheveled, pyjama-clad Harry Potter.
He was so caught up in his thoughts that he almost missed the flash of hurt in the other man’s eyes.
“Unless you don’t want me to?”
"Are you alright? Why are you being so weird?" Harry asked.
“To be fair, you’re not lying.” Harry tried to smirk but the nerves made it wonky.
"Milk, one sugar."
“Well, you weren’t supposed to find out.” Harry dragged his spare hand through his hair. Fucking bollocks.
He pushed open the door to the shop, the wind chime jingling softly above his head, the warmth of the shop a welcoming reprieve. Malfoy appeared from the back, gold rimmed glasses perched on his nose, apron on, a smudge of (what Harry assumed to be) soot on his cheek; it was almost endearing. Almost. The second he saw Harry, Draco’s face soured.
“Wouldn’t put it past you, Parkinson.”
“All right.” Potter pulled a leather pouch from his pocket and Draco stood, holding up a finger to signal that he would only be a minute.
The healer stared pointedly at the desk before him, pushing his glasses up his nose and clearing his throat.  "There is no delicate way to put this Mr Malfoy," He looked up to meet Draco's eyes. "We have detected a kind of rare disease in your blood. There is no current cure for such a disease, nor has modern research found a cause. It just, simply, is."
“I’m not joking.” Harry took another step forward, until they were only a few feet away from each other. He summoned his Gryffindor courage. “I’ve been thinking about your arse too.”
"What was I supposed to say?"
“Am not!” Both Harry and Draco denied her at once, voices overlapping. They looked at each other, and Harry released Malfoy’s shirt. The Slytherin stepped away, raising his chin as he smoothed his clothes.
Draco sighed, turning over for what felt like the hundredth time. He couldn’t sleep, his slowly-sobering brain racing around the memory of their kiss. He’d left his school-boy crush behind him long ago, content with their friendship. But all his resolve had come crashing down the moment Harry’s lips touched his. How long had he yearned for this? To finally know what the darker man tasted like, how he felt pressed against him? He groaned into the pillow, his eyes flicking up to the clock on the wall. It was just past 4 in the morning. The kiss had probably meant absolutely nothing to Harry, just another drunken adventure. What was he talking about - probably? He was sure of it.
"One, two, three!" The two slytherins downed their shots one by one, shivering at the burn in their throats.
"And you're about to take my cock up your arse." Draco whispered the words teasingly. Potter visibly shivered at his words and Draco smiled. He kissed him again, much more softly this time, and the two seemed to hum in unison.
“What’s going on?”
“Which brings me back to my point.” Pansy paused, eyeing up the two intruders; maybe it was fate that they were here. “Granger, Weasley. I may require your input. Take a seat, won’t you?” She flicked her wand at the next table over and two chairs danced towards them.
“Right, sorry.”
Potter laughed then, a bitter sound, that sounded like he found it all absurd and made Draco’s insides twist. “Oh, please, Malfoy. We both know that I’m not perfect. We both know just how angry and stupid I can be. Don’t spit your lies at me.” He stood, his hands balled by his side.
Hermione laughed again. “Looks like you don’t have to worry about your bed, Ron.”
He grabbed the rest of the ingredients from the fridge, and waved his wand at the muggle radio. "Sonus initium," he murmured, as the music poured out. Too much silence reminded him of dinner times at Privet Drive, the scathing stare from his uncle that he could feel on the back of his neck as he cooked dinner.
"Careful, Potter. Someone might overhear and think you're flirting with me." Draco's pulse was echoing in his ears and it suddenly felt too hot. What in Merlin's name was going on? Maybe he was passed out drunk at home and simply dreaming.
And, oh, Merlin, he was right; so right. Potter’s hair was so soft, and smelt so good, and - he wasn’t breathing too heavy was he? Draco dropped his eyes to Harry’s face. It was a lot closer than he thought. Shit.
Harry winced at the use of his old name. He had been 'Harry' for weeks now. He took a step forwards, peeling Draco's hands away from his chest and holding them tightly. He took a deep breath. "What are we, Draco?"
Malfoy paused, narrowing his eyes and thinning his lips. “Her name is Sylvia. What does this have to do with anything?” He quirked an eyebrow.
He soon spotted Narcissa Malfoy, chatting with a group of other over-dressed women. Harry looked down at his button up and jeans, frowning. He felt very underdressed. Thankfully, there were no reporters that he could see. What was he doing here? He turned around to ask, but Luna and Pansy had struck up a conversation, walking away, leaving him feeling completely lost. What on earth was he here for?
Harry tried to pull away, but Draco wouldn’t let go as he backed him up against the wall once again. He probably could’ve gotten out of it if he wanted to, but he didn’t - not really. Now he had had his epiphany, it was all Harry could do not to melt at the other boy’s touch. No wonder Malfoy had noticed; it was like a switch had flipped overnight. It all made sense now. How could he have been so stupid to miss it? What he felt for Malfoy was a lot less hatred and more… fuck knows what. Lust? Harry wasn’t sure. All he knew was that he wanted to be closer to him.
“You did what?”
"The Read sisters are opening a wizard club!"
Draco touched his head in confusion. "Don't be ridiculous, Potter."
“Come along, Harry.” She linked her fingers through his, walking ahead and pulling him along.
“Well I’ll tell you what I told Mr Potter here, and that is; you won’t be getting any special treatment from me. Understood?”
Harry swung their arms between them. "Sure. Do you know anywhere nice?"
“You’re right; I don’t.” Harry took a deep breath. “Thanks for saying it anyway.” He shrugged, his emotions raw. He was trying his hardest not to cry again, and it felt like Draco was trying his hardest to make him.
Chapter 3
Malfoy pushed the door open, looking around curiously. He was dressed in dark wash jeans and a pale grey button up, untucked and slightly unbuttoned. Harry had to stop his jaw from dropping. He’d never seen Malfoy look so… normal. Well, normal was an understatement. He looked straight out of the pages of a magazine, all tall sophistication and aristocratic cheekbones. Harry had accepted his attraction to men a while ago, and the familiar thrum of excitement heated his veins. He was absolutely, without a doubt, buggered beyond belief.
"Who else?"
Was he…flirting? No, he couldn’t be, surely? Draco flicked his gaze up to Harry’s eyes and found them eerily cool. The ball was in his court.
“What? I quite enjoy mocking you for the fact that Snako said we should get a room.”
Draco grabbed Potter's hand and pulled himself onto the broom behind him, wrapping his arms tightly around his waist. He was going to live.
"Two….Two months…" Draco repeated quietly, mostly to himself. So this was it, this was to be his final time in this world. It was almost funny how he had spent so many years fearing he would die the next day, and now he had just started to manage to enjoy life, it was all to end.
“Am not!”
"Really?" Pansy sat up with a bright smile.
The Slytherin smirks, hooking his finger’s into Harry’s belt loops and pulling him flush against him. “I thought it was obvious, given the amount of time I spend making you moan my name.”
"My pleasure.” Draco’s tone matched his own frustrated one.
"You do know I'm gay, Pansy."
“Tea?” Andy called from the kitchen.
Harry didn’t know why he felt so angry, but he did. Watching them converse, the timid yet friendly nature of their chatter, the way Malfoy seemed to be helping Neville with his notes, all of it just rubbed him the wrong way.
“Ah, ah. Play nice Tedster.” Harry said, running his hands through the boy’s black hair. It was much like his own. He supposed Remus' must have been the same colour when he was young. “You say ‘old hens’ as if you’re well into your seventies.” He shakes his head in mock disappointment at Andy. “You haven’t even reached your forty-eighth birthday yet.”
Harry turned to her, trying to calm his racing heart. It’s not as if she was a legilimens, she couldn’t read his mind. His Malfoy filled mind. “Um, yeah. I don’t know why I never thought about her being Malfoy's aunt.”
“Yeah, yeah, I’m fine. Just some unexpected news.”
Rita nodded, scribbling earnestly. "So much to deal with at such a young age, it really is tragic."
"What the fuck do you mean, Potter?" Draco's voice was cold.
"You're a sneaky bastard, you know that Draco?"
"I can't."
Draco didn't know where his legs were taking him, but he knew it was far away from where he was. He took off at a sprint, down the steps, and out the doors.
“You still didn’t answer my question.”
"Do you want to go up?"
And there on the floor was the boy who had haunted Draco's thoughts for the past six years. His skin stretched tight, shiny and pink. He was ugly, barely recognisable as the boy who lived, but Draco knew. Draco knew the face of the boy he tormented, and who's face tormented him every time he slept.
Draco ruffled his white hair out of his eyes and hung up his suit jacket. The sound of a muggle ice cream can sounded below, the playful tune ringing out. A wonderful idea popped into his head.
Draco took off his apron, tucking his glasses into his breast pocket. Going to the back, he retrieved his jacket and scarf. Maybe his stomach was doing somersaults, and maybe his palms were slightly sweaty. And yes, maybe fifteen year old Draco was cheering in his head at the prospect of amicable alone time with Potter. But it didn’t matter, because they weren’t even friends. Yet.
Harry snorts. “More like snobby git.”
She marched ahead along the cobbles, hips swaying and wedges gently clapping on the ground. Luna and Harry followed, around this corner and that, until the chatter became louder and louder, and the hedges parted in an arch to reveal a sprawling lawn filled with guests; most of whom were questionable purebloods, waiters and a large gazebo with tables, chairs and a buffet table. One of the waiters came up to them, tray filled with champagne flutes, and offered it. Harry took one, looking around.
"Yeah, no, really stressed." Ron frowned at his glass. "Be thankful you didn't become an Auror, Harry. Far too much bloody paperwork."
Draco licked his lips, about to retaliate when the waitress showed up with the drinks. Harry sat back, taking the straw out of the glass and licking it in the most sinful way possible.
"I beg your pardon?" Draco spun around to meet Potter's eyes. He just smirked and took it from his hands, looking through it.
Draco sat Sirius on his lap. "What do you think he's doing?"
Harry looks up at Draco curiously. “What’s that?”
"Uh-huh." Draco hummed, continuing his trail down Harry's neck.
Draco put his hands up to his face in mock horror. "No, please!"
The Slytherin’s face was bright red now, their noses nearly touching. His eyes practically sparkled and he wet his lips almost nervously. He was silent for a moment, apparently considering something before finally shoving Harry away.
“It certainly will, as will the next one.” He drawled. How long could he put off talking to Balveer? Unless he found somewhere to hide, the answer was ‘not as long as he’d like’ - and Malfoys didn’t hide.
"You're being ridiculous, Malfoy. Just sit back down. Your sandwich will be here soon." Harry reached out to grab at his sleeve, but Malfoy pulled out of his grasp, marching past him. He cursed, grabbing his own coat to follow the Slytherin back out of the cafe. "For fuck's sake, Malfoy!" Why couldn’t they just talk?
“Oh fuck off, Potter. Forget I ever said anything.” Malfoy sneered down at him before spinning around and striding away with a flourish.
“A Mr Malfoy, I presume?”
“Turn all the lights on, please.” Harry asked, dreading the undeterrable shadows of the house. It seemed as though when he was home alone, they never completely disappeared; no matter what he tried. The least that could be done was to turn the lights on. “And put the kettle on to boil.” He added sheepishly, feeling bad at asking Kreacher for such a menial task, but all he wanted was to be out as quickly as possible.
“Don’t be a prick.” Potter’s words were right on cue and Draco stopped. “I’m just trying to be nice.”
He held out his hand. "Good, morning, Mr Malfoy. I am Andrew Moors, Head of department."
The air had a slight chill to it as they stepped outside the restaurant, both full and warm and content. Draco couldn't remember the last time he had felt this happy. They walked on in silence, but it wasn't awkward. When Draco peered at Harry, he found he was already staring at him. "Your hair is glowing,"
“You named your snake after me.”
“No, I just let someone else’s cat lick themselves on my counter.” He rolled his eyes.
Luna kissed his other cheek, offering him the brightest of smiles. “I’m here to ‘sweeten you up’”.
“So he got your address from Andromeda?” Hermione asked, sipping at her wine.
“Oh." Luna raised her eyebrows. "I turned the open sign to closed when we walked in so no one would come in. Your arguing might be bad for business.” She explained with a shrug, putting Sylvia down.
WHO'S READY FOR SOME PANSY PARKINSON AND GAY CLUBBING WOOOOO
Ginny paused, thinking over Harry’s words. “Are we talking about arguing with anyone specific?” Harry nodded and Ginny grimaced, as if uncomfortable with her next words. “I mean, I might be wrong, but…” She leaned in closer, “...are you sure you’re not mistaking passion for anger?”
And with that, Potter dashed off down the hallway, leaving Draco’s fingers tingling and his stomach fluttering with butterflies. They were both doomed, surely, so why were they both so excited about it?
“WHAT!” Draco stood up so quickly he spilt his tea.
Chapter 4
"I've - I've got to go." Harry blurted out, reaching forward and grabbing the cloak from Draco. The slytherin frowned, watching as Harry dashed for the door.
“Oh, I thought you were crying.”
Despite insisting that Mr Malfoy's murky past did not involve murder, Mr potter conceded that the pureblood had been a tireless brute at school. Thankfully, the pureblood’s talent for potions opened the door for his redemption at Mr Potter’s hands, as a last resort, our saviour had asked for his skills to be used to treat his anguish.
“Yeah of course, mate.” Ron waved him off, not looking away from the TV.
“I just…” Harry picked at his nails, struggling to find the words. He did not want to have this conversation. “I just...I dunno.” He raised his right hand to bite at the nails, but it was caught by Malfoy. He gasped at the touch.
"I'm trying really hard not to smack you round the head." Draco whispered, only half joking. He tugged again, and Harry finally let him, his arms falling to his sides. Draco squeezed his hand, letting go and sitting back down. "I'm not used to it, you being mad at me, not anymore." He watched as Potter sat next to him, swiping the tears from his quickly drying eyes. "We've been too nice recently."
They pulled away and Harry looked at Draco with a new kind of intensity. It wasn't lust; it was… something else. Something new.
She sucked in a breath, eyes wide with scandal, and smacked his hand away. “What the fuck, Draco?”
Harry squeezed his hand and smiled sadly. "Kind of, but none of us did, did we?"
"Okay," he cleared his throat. "Okay, Malfoy. Let's see what you've got."
Potter's mouth was warm and sweet, his lips slightly chapped. Draco kissed him back and hummed against his lips. It was better than he had ever imagined, and Merlin, had he imagined this a lot.
"You're right. I don't. Here’s what I do know: you’re an arrogant arsehole who can’t even sit through one conversation!” Harry took a step closer, jabbing a finger at him. At this point he didn’t know what he wanted more, an actual conversation; a chance to be friends - or this fiery confrontation that he hadn't realised he’d missed so much.
Potter went up to the counter, returning a few minutes later with their drinks.
"Thank you."
Potter gulped. “Yes.”
“What?”
“Potter, I said it was fine.” He took Harry’s hand off of his arm and squeezed it. “This is a much better alternative.”
Harry thought it over. What bad could come from it? He’d simply owl Rita Skeeter (no doubt Hermione knew her address) and request an interview. She’d jump at the chance. And, this way, if it went well, Malfoy might actually owe him a bit; which was always a good thing.
“Pansy Bernadine Parkinson. What. Did. You. Do?!”
“...and then we spent the next thirty minutes chatting! Like friends! It was weird as fuck, guys. But we get along really well.” Harry said, his voice slightly slurred as he waved his half empty beer glass around. He was sat in the pub his friends frequented, two and a half pints into his rant about Malfoy.
"I think you bruised my ribs." Potter half-chuckled nervously.
When he had begun rearing snakes, it was hard not to become attached to most of them, but even harder with this particular corn snake. Snake-Draco was clingy and a little bit rude, not hesitating to talk back to him whilst also asking for food or wrapping himself around Harry’s nearest appendage. That’s what he was doing now, as Harry signed off the sale of six of his snakes to the new pet emporium. Snake-Draco wound himself around Harry’s arm, his head dangling off of his hand.
Draco’s eyes shot open, focusing on Pansy as she sat on the armchair, hair brushed, face washed, sitting in a fresh set of pyjamas. “Why the fuck are you okay?” He groaned, rubbing his face.
“You cry very quietly, you know. I would’ve expected you to be a howler.” Draco said as he poured them both tea.
Harry felt like he was missing out on something obvious. Like Malfoy wasn’t actually discussing charms notes. “Oh fuck off, Malfoy.” He spat.
“Can you please not have an entire foreign conversation in front of me? I feel very left out.” Malfoy raised his eyebrow, crossing his arms.
Draco blinked at her slowly, trying to register what she had just asked through the fog of anxiety in his mind. “He deserves it, no doubt about it. I should be there too, but Harry spoke for me.” His words faded quieter and quieter.
“I’m not sure.” Harry’s words pulled him from his thoughts, and Draco focused on his lips. “A lot of things, or nothing at all. I’m a strong believer of making the most of what you have.” He turned to face Draco fully, his head blocking the sunlight, his curls glowing like a halo. Fuck, he was gorgeous.
“Why don’t you take a picture? It’ll last longer.” He winked up at him. Potter took a few steps back and held up his hands like he was taking a picture.
"I shouldn't be enjoying myself as much as I am." Potter conceded with a coy smile and Draco blushed deeper. What had the world come to? Was this really happening?
“I know.” Hermione scooted over, pulling Harry in under her arm and giving him a squeeze.
“What in Merlin’s… Oh my god.” Harry looked at Lucy with wide eyes. “Are they sisters?”
1st May 2001
Draco turned away, trying his best to blink away his tears. He turned back to punch Potter in the shoulder. "So much for Saint Potter, did you just call me stupid?"
So why was he staring at said posh pompous pillock’s hand outstretched in an unlikely truce? Unfathomable, unlikely, unexpected.  A strange, stupid, silly, idea. And yet here it was in practice. Harry’s eyes traveled up the long, slender digits encircled in silver family heirlooms, up the sleeve of the freshly pressed grey shirt, past the adams apple, up to the pink pouty lips, and finally, stared straight into the narrowed silver eyes of the git he’d long since hated with a passion.
“I know you’re not.” He thought about their school days. “You just need to be careful, you have a habit of being reckless.” Draco said quietly, unable to stop himself.
Draco flicked his gaze back up at him. “Yes.” He took a breath and rolled his eyes. “I’m not a monster. If there’s a way to help out, I will.”
“Bully for you.” Harry said, rubbing his forehead. “What do you want, Malfoy?”
Harry smiles cheekily. “I love you back, you oaf.”
“That’s because it is!”
“Well then, I’ll call you it more often. On one condition.”
“Is that a yes?”
{I hope this reads okay! I just realised I can't have italics and oof.... I hope you can fully understand what are Draco's thoughts and what aren't!}
“Parkinson. What are you doing here?”
"And you?" Harry turned to her. "You knew too?"
"I can't- I can't be sure."
Draco grabbed at Harry's shirt, tears in his eyes. "I'm…" he gasped for air.
Draco wanted to roll his eyes at him, but couldn’t stop the blush in his cheeks and the butterflies in his stomach. He patted the space beside him and the darker boy sat down, resting his head on Draco’s shoulder. They had the common room to themselves, with the rest of the eighth years either in DADA class or the library studying for NEWTs. Harry didn’t have to attend the class, with assurances from McGonagall that he would receive the qualification in full without the need for exams. Draco had opted out of DADA, focusing instead on potions, herbology and alchemy.
Draco pried open the box carefully and selected a piece, popping it into his mouth. He had never tasted something so good. He peeked at his father out of the corner of his eye and schooled his features. "Thank you, Mother. It is most exquisite. Would you like some?"
Rita Skeeter sat across from him, digging in her handbag for what Harry assumed was her Quick-Quotes Quill. They were seated in one of Harry’s favourite muggle cafés, not wanting to be disturbed as they most likely would have been in a wizarding one. Harry had offered to pay, not wanting the awful experience of watching Rita flounder with muggle money.
“Dwaco!” A high voice squealed, and the blond turned around to see his young cousin.
Draco pressed his hand to Potter's cheek and used the other to bring him closer. He gasped into the kiss and Draco took it as an opportunity to deepen the kiss. He licked Potter's lip carefully and he reacted beautifully, moaning and kissing him harder.
“Don’t make me a sop, then.” Draco replied lowly, leaning in closer.
“Two galleons, please, madam.” Malfoy said, smiling politely as he held out his hand.
“You’re both wrong.” Luna said simply, and both of them looked over to her as she stood to the side, stroking the purring cat in her arms.
"Yes, you pillock. Unless there's anyone else you'd rather go on a date with?"
Draco was still more than ten paces away from her, but could feel the older witch’s eyes practically piercing his soul. “Uhm, yes. Nice to meet you.” He walked forwards, extending his hand. Peason shook it briskly.
I could go on and on, but the point is this- you still plague my thoughts. You still fill my head. You’re in my dreams, my nightmares, my desires…
“I have a friend like you,” Luna said, fixing her big blue eyes on him.
"Don't do that. Don't go into defense mode."
“That’s such good news, mate. I’m so happy for you.” Ron raised his beer to Harry.
His own cock hardened at the thought, and he looked into Potter's endless green eyes to see an excitement that was echoed in his own. He closed his eyes, and with a sharp crack the two landed with a bounce on Draco's bed.
------
Harry snorted. "Next you'll be having to draw a fart chart."
Harry smiled. "That would be nice."
Draco looked at the parchment again, stroking the tawny owl's head. Right up his street. He wondered what Potter meant by that.
But he couldn't cry, he couldn't scream. There wasn't time for that.
“I’m sure he already knows.”
“You have? Why didn’t you tell me?”
"AUROR POTTER IS NEEDED AT HEADQUARTERS IMMEDIATELY."
Draco knew they looked a force to be reckoned with. They were wearing matching black makeup, the cloud like smudges across their eyes were much like masks; making the two look both terrifying and mysterious. Draco was wearing all black too: skinny jeans, button up shirt and leather jacket. A real bad boy is what Pansy had said, though Draco reckoned if they weren't so close and he wasn't so gay he'd be perving on her all night in her skin tight lace and latex dress. He'd taken two anxiety pills before coming out, and he reckoned he could deal with the night ahead.
"Fuck off. As if you don't say horrible fucking things when you're mad."
"Yeah, you know…" Ginny rolled her eyes at Harry’s befuddlement. "Like, you just feel so strongly for this person that you don't know what to do with all that emotion, so you get frustrated and it comes out as anger." She explained, sitting back in her chair.
“Completely.”
"Never."
Harry sipped at his tea, trying his best to copy his memory of Malfoy’s perfect air of nonchalance. Face blank, apart from mild interest, posture relaxed but not bored. He'd decided against a pint, imaging the headlines: HARRY POTTER: HERO TURNED ALCOHOLIC.
“Ah, excuse my rudeness, Mr Potter.” Balveer extended his hand.
Harry grimaced. He was right. “You really like me?”
"Touché." Draco gave him a peck. "Do you want to go out?"
“No, it’s quite uncommon. He wrote back in excitement about Draco, though. They got close in eighth year, did you know?”
"Why did you leave it in the house, you daft bat?" Draco sighed dramatically as he stepped out into the sun, coming towards the giggling figure crouched over on the grass.
Andy came running in, bottle of milk still in hand, eyes wide. “What’s happened? Is everything okay?”
“What do you mean?” Draco didn’t open his eyes.
“Yes..” Malfoy said slowly, almost mockingly. Maybe he hadn’t changed much after all.
“What do you mean?” Andy asked, quirking her head.
Harry felt almost elated with the exhilaration of arguing with Malfoy again. This must be what adrenaline junkees feel, he thought, chasing the high. If only his high wasn’t going blow to blow with Malfoy.
“I’ll let you into a secret.” Potter said quietly as he raised his glass to his lips. Draco watched him swallow and gulped. “The longer we talk, the longer I’m saved from talking to other people.” He whispered the words, his green eyes dancing with humour. “So please do me a favour and get it off your chest.”
“I see him every week, you know.” Luna piped up.
“I’ll pay for the ingredients and research or whatever.” Potter said, trepidatiously, obviously still a bit pissed off.
17th May 2001
“Piss off!”
“How on earth is it your fault? I may not have known Remus and Tonks, but I know they died for a good cause. I know they died for what was right.” Draco unconsciously reached towards him again.
Harry unconsciously took a step back, feeling suddenly strange at having Malfoy’s face only an inch or two away from his. It was his turn to snort. “Jealous? What kind of bullshit are you on, Malfoy?”
Draco watched Potter flounder, his own amusement tainted with a nervous ball in his stomach. Lunch, with Harry Potter. Were pigs flying? Potter’s visit was certainly unexpected, and the fact that he was asking him out to lunch? Completely fucking unprecidented. Fourteen year old Draco would have creamed himself right then and there.
"Can I get you anything to drink, gentlemen?" Draco frowns at the menu, realising that muggle wine is much different to wizard wine. He passes it over to Potter.
“Really? But it’s such a nice day.”
“Never thought I’d say it, mate.” Both men fell onto the sofa, Pig taking off to look out the window. Lucy watched with interest from her scratching tower.
Malfoy smirked, watching Harry carefully. They held each other’s gaze, each other’s stomach filled with butterflies.
Harry wiped the dust from his eyes, breathing heavily, his heart hammering in his chest. The wind howled in his ears, echoing around the ruins of the castle. Broken glass and rubble crunched under his feet as he staggered towards what should have been the courtyard. He squinted at his surroundings as his vision shook and shivered, trying to make out the spottings of colour around him. He screwed his eyes shut before opening them again, blinking rapidly.
“So you are?”
They lay panting for a moment, before Draco slid off and curled into Harry's side. Potter slid his arm around him and kissed the top of his head. Is this what heaven felt like?
Draco lifted his head and wiped his eyes, kissing her on the cheek. "I'll come visit over Christmas break, mother. Promise to write to me?"
Draco pretended to gasp as he leaned in dramatically. "She's back with Tony?"
“Just go and fuck off, Malfoy.”
“I’m not!” Draco reached for his hands again, and when Harry didn’t move away, he gave them a squeeze. The touch made his skin tingle, and the butterflies once again appeared with urgency. “I like you, Harry.”
“Thank you. Most people don’t. He says that that’s okay, but I know he is still annoyed about it.”  Luna replies.
I hold a rather large grudge, fuelled almost completely by my own damaged pride. Pride bruised by a lack of you in my life, and pride bruised whenever you are in my life. It is quite the conundrum, I tell you.
He shook his head, struggling to make sense of it all. He needed to clear his head, desperately. If he was careful, there was just enough time to take to the quidditch pitch before curfew.
"Ginny Weasley! I need to talk to you!" He shouted.
Draco snorted. “Oh mon Dieu, it’s to celebrate my shop.” He chuckled. “Mother wanted a reason to throw a bash, and my shop’s newfound success, owed mostly in part to you, is a good enough one.” He sipped his champagne with a shrug.
“Hello, sweetheart.”
Draco's chest tightened as he thought about how that would never happen, but shook his head to clear his thoughts. He had to focus on the now. Shit, he really should have taken his pills.
“Thanks, guys.” Harry said, suddenly having to blink back tears. It was such a relief to feel this kind of optimism again, after having resigned himself to having nightmares indefinitely. “Anyways, Ron, How’s training going?”
“Tea?” Andy called from the kitchen.
Harry smiled at the two of them. "Wait there!" He ran back to the house.
Pansy slinked in beside Draco, looping her arm through his. “The saviour returns.”
“Told him what?” Neville asked.
Pansy cast a quick tempus. 8:11.
“Okay, yeah. I’m starting some new potions to help with it.” The previous night had been just as Draco described. This time, as Nagini had slinked towards him in the rubble of the castle, Hermione’s screams had been replaced with laughter. When he turned to her, she was sitting on his sofa next to Ron, glass of wine in hand.
Harry sat on a bench in the park down the road from Grimmauld Place, Teddy in his pushchair in front of him. He opened the chocolate mousse, licking the excess from the lid. “Don’t tell grandma, Tedster. This little treat is just between us.” He scooped up a little onto the spoon, offering it to the toddler.
“You’re asking me to ask you to dinner?” Draco shook his head in disbelief
Draco poured the water into the cups, stirring. "We should go together, sometime."
"Why not? I know you want to go." Draco shrugged.
“Merlin, I’ve really cocked up, haven’t I?” His laugh was somewhere between embarrassed and amazed.
The potion was one of his own making, and he was extremely proud of it. Every peaceful night over the past few months, every good morning, was thanks to it, and now he didn’t even need to take it anymore. He sent out a silent prayer that Potter wouldn’t pry too much - he did NOT want to have that conversation.
Draco couldn’t help it; he let out a chuckle. “Since when am I your preferred match for conversation?”
"Oh, um." Draco peered at the flavours through the glass. "I'll have mint-choc chip, please." He smiled at the server.
“You do?”
{This chapter contains explicit smut, but also some key things. I have highlighted the beginning and end of the explicit content with this >>> _-_-_-_ -_-_-_-_}
"We're both top of the class, it doesn't matter." Draco smirked, nudging Harry's chin up. "It's fine." He murmured, his voice filled with lust. He kissed Harry and the darker boy groaned into his mouth.
Malfoy snorted. “What do you mean, what am I doing with Neville? All I did was help him with his notes.” He leaned forwards, scrutinising Harry’s face. “Merlin’s tits. Are you jealous, Potter?”
Harry felt his own tears threatening in his throat, thoughts of losing another pet owl too much to bear. “Don’t worry, Paeson.” Harry crouched down, pushing a treat through the cage door and watching Alfie eat it nonchalantly. “I’ll take him back to my house and speak to some friends of mine. Hopefully one of them will be able to help.”
Harry pouted and walked towards him, shoving him into the wall. "Don't be mean, Malfoy." He pressed his chest against his.
Malfoy walked towards him, and Harry watched him warily. “For the moment I knew you wanted me too.” He reached for Harry’s hands, but the Gryffindor withdrew.
“I don’t know what you’re on about.” Harry ducked under his arm, but Draco caught his sleeve.
Draco's vision began to swirl at an alarming pace, and his breath was knocked from him. When he found it again, it came in short, rapid bursts. His therapist said this was hyperventilating, and that he should try and take longer, slower breaths. In, two, three, four. Out, two, three, four. He did his best to do so, and swallowed thickly.
"Mr Malfoy's ample inheritance no doubt-" Draco started, his glasses perched on his nose as he read the newspaper. Harry grabbed him by the hand, and the blond gaped at him as he dragged him through the Auror department, and opened a door which read "filing room". Had it been anyone else except the saviour of the wizarding world, the two most certainly would have been stopped.
“Yeah, who doesn’t get turned on by caffeine jitters.” She looked at him pointedly and he frowned. Luna wrapped her arms around Ginny from behind, silently putting her chin on her shoulder. “We’re all here for you, Harry. Maybe you should try the mind-healers again.” The red head added.
“Yes,” Draco agreed, shuffling closer on the bed and using his other hand to grip Harry’s chin, tilting it up towards him. “But I’d make it again,” he whispered, “If only to spend the night in your arms once more.”
“I would, I really would.” Harry reached forwards to grab the blond’s hand, suddenly full of Gryffindor bravery. “You can ask me on another one once we’re done.”
“I think you mean intoxicating.” Draco chuckles and Harry narrowes his eyes. “You’re so cute when you do that.”
"Merlin, Malfoy. You really can't help a healthy dose of drama, can you?" Potter said, shutting the door behind them. The small room was lined with shelves of boxes, and more boxes and stacks of paper were scattered across the floor. A single yellow light flickered above them.
"Stop stressing." Snake-Draco hissed, winding his way up the desk leg.
The blond raised his eyebrow. “And what would you know about passion?”
Harry turned just in time to see him disappear with a crack, leaving him to growl at the empty space where he had been, cursing loudly.
“Harry?”
With a crack they disapparated, landing in a small, shaded alley. The sound of splashing water could be heard. Potter took his hand. "Lead the way."
(See the end of the chapter for
As he watched, Potter turned and met his eye, a small look of shock crossing his face. Luna turned too, and waved eagerly at him. He nodded back with a small smile and turned away, not wanting to draw any more attention to himself. He took a large gulp of his wine, memories of the past few years flooding his mind.
As he began his tale of post-war sorrow, my heart bled for him, so burdened with stardom and grief. What should have been a period of freedom and bachelorhood for our handsome young star was laden with pain and suffering. He poured his heart out to me for some time, and once his shoulders had been lightened, he further confided in me his newfound solution.
Fucking shit, Draco thought, as he raced through to his bathroom to brush his teeth. He popped some pain medication for his pounding head before pulling on some clothes.
“I don’t know. But you certainly make a change from these other posh gits - I can at least remember your name.”
Draco watched as Potter licked his spoon clean, dropping it into the storage compartment of the pram before tossing the empty cup into the bin. He had thought the golden boy couldn't look better, but the way he smiled at Edward only cast an even brighter light over his features.
“I sent it to Potter.” She whispered, eyes wide.
“It’s a surprise, you twat.”
Let me know ASAP.
“I trust your judgement mate, most of the time at least.” Ron said, taking a swig from his own pint. “If you say he’s changed, I’m sure he has. But he owes Hermione an apology before he can be let into the group.”
Harry took his hand carefully, enjoying the way their fingers locked together. “Is this okay?”
“Merde! (shit!)” The slytherin pulled away. “I can’t do this. I really can’t bloody do this.” He muttered, rubbing his head as he stood up. Bloody Saint Potter, calling him by his first name. It was like he’d just taken all of his emotions and shoved them into a muggle blender. Draco’s head spun, reeling with the anxiety of the day and his stupid boy-ish fantasies of a man he could never have.
“I’m so sorry to interrupt, Andy. I, erm, just wanted to collect my coat that I forgot.” He lied, running his hand through his hair nervously.
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco looked at Harry in horror, grasping his chest as he coughed, and Harry was barely out of his chair in time to catch him as he fell out of his chair.
Harry followed him over, ignoring the looks from the other guests. Just through the archway was a beautiful garden, filled with flowers, lined with willow trees. A stone path wound its way through the long grass, and just at the edge of what could be seen was a large, ornate water fountain with cherubs carved into it. “Wow.” He breathed, the first time he had ever been so breath taken by nature.
“Absolutely lovely.”
“I just..I didn’t think-” The darker man’s voice cracks, and he takes a deep breath. Draco feels strangely proud as he does this; proud that Harry isn’t going to run away like he had done before when his emotions were too much. “I didn’t think anyone could love me.” The words come out small, and the Gryffindor buries his face back in Draco’s chest.
The sound of buttering toast ceased, and Draco looked up to see Harry frowning at the jam. “It’s how I was brought up. If I was too loud, they’d make me skip dinner.”
The last thing he saw were Nagini’s fangs.
“No, well, I mean, yeah. I wanted to ask you out. To lunch. I want to buy you lunch. As a thank you.” Harry stuttered, his heart racing, suddenly incredibly embarrassed. Maybe this had been a bad idea.
"I'm going to spin you now." He murmured.
"Yes alright Potter, no need to be condescending."
“Bloody hell, Malfoy. I didn’t realise it would be this hard to take you out to dinner.” Potter crossed his arms. “And don’t speak french at me, you know full well I don’t understand.”
He was proud of Draco as well. He’d only seen a snapshot of what he was going through, but Harry was still in awe of his strength.
“My eyes!” Ron squealed, immediately covering his face with his hands. “My eyes!” He screamed again.
“You make a wish.”
5th March 2000
Draco passed his mug over and gestured towards the balcony, where streams of dying light were pouring in. "The sun is setting, we should go watch it."
Harry frowned. “You should go back.” His mind swirled around the most important thing Malfoy had said all night; ‘him’. Was Malfoy gay?
"Were you watching me?" Draco asked, and Harry looked back to see his cheeks tinged with pink.
“What did he just say?” Malfoy asked.
"What? Why? It's like 10am."
"Death eater? Don't give me that bollocks Malfoy," Potter huffed. "You know full well that I don't blame you for the war."
“You’ll do well with them, you always do.” Harry clapped him on the shoulder.
"Harry," Rita began with a sickly sweet tone of pity, putting her hand over his. "Is it possible he's lied to you? Given you a potion to trick you into being on his side?"
He could feel a slight thrum in his veins and had to fight the urge to hum a song to himself. Just lovely, he thought. Perhaps he should spend the next two months drunk.
"It's okay." Harry pushed his chair back, eager to leave. "Good Afternoon."
Draco looked back up, searching his face as he blinked back tears. “What have I done to deserve forgiveness?”
Draco didn't respond, stepping back and lifting his arm as Potter spun around. The other man let out a surprised chuckle and Draco found himself smiling. He brought them back together, pressing their bodies against each other once again. Potter smelt incredible, earthy and spicy, and Draco wondered if he could get drunk on his scent alone.
"We were both horrid gits." The blond nodded.
Draco took deep breaths to calm his nerves, taking another of his anxiety pills as he looked himself over in the mirror. He was wearing a tailored grey suit with blue hues, no tie and a couple of buttons undone on his crisp shirt. He had left his hair natural, with a slight curl. It looked longer this way, but was probably just the same length as it had been in school.
“It suits you too, most days.”
“I prefer the term ‘self-indulgent honesty’.”
The familiar pull of apparition tugged Harry along, and when he opened his eyes again, he was staring at the front gates of Malfoy Manor.
At that, Draco looked at Potter with an expression somewhat like a gaping fish. "You don't?"
“Oi.” The two men looked at each other with laughter in their eyes.
Draco bit his tongue and ignored him, his ridiculous fear of banter with the Gryffindor driving him away. He gave Sylvia a scratch under the chin. “You must persevere with the potion. After a week or two, the nightmares should stop. You need to finish the full thirty nights taking the potion, and then the nightmares should be gone.”
They were all having lunch in the Great Hall, chattering away, when Hermione caught sight of Harry and her face dropped. “What’s happened?”
“Sorry, I’ve got overtime at work.” Hermione patted his shoulder consolingly.
“You can't..?” Draco pulled him to a stop. “You’re telling me that you just insinuated a made up relationship to my ex, practically promised him a show on the dance floor, whilst also telling the whole bloody world that you like men - which will be in the papers all year by the way; not least because you’re with me, just to save my embarrassment? And you can’t bloody dance?!”
“I’m a useless gay and he’s a useless straight.” Draco whined, throwing himself back against the sofa. Yes, he loved a bit of dramatic flare. But he wasn’t wrong, was he?
"That would be nice."
"What use are you? Everyone is dead because of you!"
“Oh, I understand.” Draco sat forward abruptly. “Just forget I said anything.” He smiled weakly and stood up.
Potter smiled and took off, pulling Draco with him. "Come on, let's get some ice cream." He went right up to the store front. "What do you want?"
"A top, Potter? I am, when the mood takes me." Draco ran his thumb over Potter's lips. "And it seems to have taken me now."
Harry sucked in a breath, turning to watch her retreating back. What the fuck? How in the world did she know that he was on about Malfoy? Was it really that obvious? And if so… Did Ginny really believe he was -passionate- about Malfoy? What did that even mean, anyway?
“Muggle?” Malfoy chuckled and it was like music to Harry’s ears. “I thought I’d try it out. Always a good day when I’ve done something that would piss my father off.”
The two had never spoken much, despite working together. Amicable acquaintances was probably the most appropriate term for their relationship. Of course, that didn’t mean that a highly-inappropriate workplace crush hadn’t developed. Harry was, as always, oblivious to Malfoy’s returned feelings. He didn’t dare at that moment to think about how nice Malfoy felt against him, or the way his heart raced. Would he help him?
Draco apparated away, his blood boiling. His emotions were everywhere, and he felt like Potter had just confronted him with every single one of them. Of course he regretted everything he had done, and of course he wanted to be friends. He had spent so much of his time over the past few years thinking about the golden boy, but with every mistake he made, every cruel and jealous word muttered, he sunk deeper into the quicksand of his own demise. By the time he had reached his limit, had wanted to change, wanted to set things right, Voldemort had returned; and he had to choose between his family or doing the right thing. Maybe his choices made him a coward, but he couldn’t change it now.
--------
Neville hummed. “Do you want me to pour some cold water on you?”
"As lovely as that would be, sweetcheeks, it's not needed."
Thanks again!
The waitress points to something on the menu. "I'd recommend the Chapelle d'Ausone, it's a lovely French red with a merlot base."
“Or three.” Hermione grumbled, sipping her wine. “I love you, Harry, you know I do. And I'm glad Malfoy has helped you out with your nightmares. But he hasn’t apologised to me yet.”
“Ha! He’s got you there, babe.” Hermione chuckled as she watched them over the rim of her wine glass.
“You think all wizards are ugly.” Harry rolled his eyes.
“Oh shove off, you great big git.” Draco gave a small smile, trying to pull his hands away.
"How would I have known that you would even talk to me?" Draco avoided his eyes. Understandably, whenever he had even considered the idea of talking to the Gryffindor, he had been dissuaded by images of black eyes and broken noses.
“What do you want?” Potter sniffed the glass. “Scotch?”
"Oh yes, the saviour of the wizarding world likes cock, isn't that a shocker." Potter’s voice was surprisingly tight.
“Because Pansy gets off on scheming.” Draco snorted. The two men walked slowly towards the water feature in comfortable silence, taking in the garden. They reached into the water at the same time to trail their fingers in it.
Harry admired her a lot. She didn’t make a fuss about who he was. In fact, when he had first applied for the job, she had raised a single eyebrow at him and told him he wouldn’t be getting any special treatment from her. That was more than fine by him, and as time went on, he found they got on well.
“Not a chance.” Was he slurring?
Harry sighed loudly, reaching down to grab Pigwidgeon from where he had been standing facing the wall, slowly walking into it, over and over again.
“My apologies, Mother. I have been rather busy.” Draco’s voice was tight and Harry couldn’t tell if he was on the verge of tears or shouting.
Draco squeezed his eyes shut, pinching the bridge of his nose as he resigned himself to the whims of a stubborn, drunk heiress, with a loud groan. “Fine.”
“Only a sprinkling. Hopefully we’ll get a rainbow.”
Draco pulled at his curls gently. "You're ridiculous, Potter."
Please comment if you can't distinguish them and I'll try and fix it!
"Shit, please," he hissed as Draco gave him a gentle squeeze. "Please suck my cock, Malfoy."
"No. It was made by an old school-friend of mine: Draco Malfoy."
“Lovely to meet you.” Potter nodded, half dragging Draco towards the dance floor. They left the poor man in shocked silence.
Maybe it's okay. Maybe they're going to tell you they got it wrong. Maybe you're going to live.
"How?" her voice had come out surprisingly steady, though she didn't recognise it.
Draco choked on his drink. “Pans!” She never ceased to shock him.
“Your father’s in Azkaban, yes?”
Draco took his hand. "Does it bother you? That you didn't get a normal childhood?"
“As eloquent as ever, Potter.” The man smirked, pushing his glasses onto the top of his head. He untucked the mask from behind his ears. “You must excuse my appearance, I had forgotten I was wearing my brewing mask. One can never be too safe when working with angel’s trumpet.”
“Oh, Harry.” Hermione squeezed his hand. “We won’t let him forget them, or the love they gave him. He will be loved by so many, have so many friends and family, and he will know his parents died for the sake of the good.”
"Half-wit? Just because I make mistakes, it doesn’t mean I’m stupid!" Harry joined the blond in raising his voice and shoved the other man in the chest.
-------
"You invite me clubbing, but all you do is sit on your arse."
“Ron!” Hermione reprimanded.
Draco smirked and put on a high pitch voice. "Oh Merlin! It’s Harry Potter!" he squealed, tapping him on the shoulder. "Can I have you autograph, Harry?" He poked his shoulder repeatedly.
Draco stepped back to let Harry go, who made no attempt to straighten himself out and Draco couldn't bring himself to tell him. He kind of liked the idea of Potter showing up to work looking like this, knowing he had done it. "Don't die, Potter."
“What..?” Harry stuttered, looking to Luna cluelessly.
"I don't think I've ever seen you so dressed down, Malfoy."
“Am I supposed to be flattered?”
“I am not cute!” Harry pouts and Draco chuckles again. He walks forward, putting his hands on his boyfriend’s hips.
Harry took a deep breath, steeling himself. “I’m just not as perfect as everyone thinks.” He said quietly. His next words came out in a tumble, “I let everyone down, they all died because I wasn’t fast enough, wasn’t good enough.” His voice broke, tears pricking at his eyes. “Teddy will never see his parents again, and it's my fault.”
Draco lifted his hips, struggling against the hot, firm body of Potter, who had the gall to smirk down at him. They were both panting slightly, and… was Draco hallucinating? Or was that the hard length of The Saviour pressed against his thigh?
“Mother insisted.” The man rolled his eyes playfully, before his face grew more serious. “I was wanting to talk to you.”
Draco’s head had been swimming with ideas since he had left Harry’s three days ago. The potion was relatively easy and wouldn’t take more than a week to make and perfect. If all went well, the combination of peacock feathers, valerian root, snowdrops, wiggentree bark, armadillo bile, and crocodile heart would serve well to help calm Alfie’s magical condition.
“I work at the owl emporium-”
Harry nodded towards the doors. “The kids will be out soon, follow me.”
Grabbing his broom and invisibility cloak from the dorms, Harry crept back through the common room and out the portrait hole, making his way through the castle. The sky was clear, the air crisp, and the Gryffindor team captain was eager to make the most of it.
Hermione turned to him. “At the end of last year, Draco apologised to me too.”
“PANSY!” Draco lurched forwards, his stomach doing the same. Merlin, anxiety and alcohol did not mix well.
“Oh, sorry, mate.”
“Yes, master?”
If Draco was lucky enough, he’d wake up before Pansy tomorrow, and could burn the blasted thing before she could bully him about it.
“What did you do to his hair?!” Draco asked, eyes wide in alarm. Why on earth would she modify his hair - or worse - use muggle dye?!
It was just the usual, a copy of the day’s Daily Prophet, a copy of The Quibbler, a letter addressed in Hermione’s writing, no doubt reminding him of the Weasley spring get-together, and...another letter. He didn’t recognise the handwriting. He pried open the seal curiously, unfolding the letter inside:
“It’s true.”
“Bye-Bye!” Teddy waved earnestly at him, making Harry smile.
Harry Potter with a scowl on his face when they got a new assignment. Harry Potter with a distinctive glow on his face when he flew in the eighth year Quidditch games. Harry Potter in tatty pyjamas rubbing his eyes as he came out of the bathroom. Harry Potter shooting Draco a thumbs up when he got his NEWT results in the Great Hall, and Draco just rolling his eyes in return, struggling to hide his smile.
His godfather smiled happily, picking him up and putting him on his lap, casting a gentle warming charm over him now he was out of his blankets. It wasn’t too cold in the spring air, but he still wanted to be careful. “You want some more?” He scooped up another bit, offering it to the toddler, who managed to get it all around his mouth. Harry leant forwards, using the cuff of his sleeve to wipe it away. He could have done it with magic, but sometimes it just felt more natural to do things the muggle way. He wonders which way his parents preferred to use when he was little.
“Exactly, it’s your mother, Draco. I thought I at least meant enough to you for you to tell her about me, about us.”
"How in Merlin’s name do you know that?" Ron asked, taken aback.
“Yeah, but we agreed that it was probably just some horrid trick, remember? Ron and I threw eggs at him at dinner and got detention for a week.”
"For once, I think you may be better off choosing, Potter."
“I need to head out, babe.” Ginny kissed her on the cheek and pulled out of her grasp. “Let me know how it goes, Harry.” She squeezed his arm.
“Absolutely.”
“Draco, what’s going on?” Potter’s voice held concern, but Draco ignored it, rubbing at his head as his heart raced. “Draco?”
Draco reached up and grappled with Harry’s tight fist around his shirt. “Do you even know what pressing a shirt is, Potter?” Finally, Harry let go. “I don’t know what matter you’re discussing, but I can promise you that your tiny little brain is wrong.”
Draco passed it over, looking far too perfect in Harry’s bed. He appeared almost ethereal, the sunlight streaming in through the window illuminating his ruffled white locks, his silver eyes locked on Harry’s throat as he drank. Suddenly, all thoughts of a cold shower went out the window, and all Potter wanted to do was pull him in for a kiss, taste those sweet lips of his.
“No, the mother barn owl is off her meds now, so all is back to normal.” Paeson stretched her hands above her head, cracking her neck. “I’m gonna make a cuppa, you want one?”
"Well, you've certainly come to the right place, Mr Potter. I'll get your story heard." She gave him a wan smile and he tried his best to return it. "So do tell me, what is it you have to say?"
How had it taken him so long to realise this? Teddy was nearly two! Harry remembered Lupin saying something about his hair when he was born, but everytime Harry saw him, Teddy had had black hair. Once or twice, he had caught a glimpse of lighter brown hair, but had blamed it on a trick of the light, because whenever he was there, his hair had been black. He supposed it should be a compliment. Even when Hermione or Ron had visited, Teddy’s hair had always been black. And since he lived with Andromeda, he probably didn’t find her brown hair very exciting.
“I offered you a truce, Potter. You’re the one who refused.” He said, walking backwards with his arms out. “I’m trying to change, it’s your choice to remain stuck.”
Harry collapsed into the chair opposite her with a big sigh. “Do you think I’m too angry?”
“I did mean what I said a few months ago. Just give me the word and I’ll lock those bastards up in that bloody cupboard to starve to death.” Draco tries to keep his voice light and joking, but the anger flares in his stomach, images of Vernon Dursley writhing in pain flashing through his head.
The two watched him walk away, before Draco pulled Harry back towards the door. They stepped outside into dying sunlight.
He nodded. “Sure. Let me drop my bag in the back first.” He didn’t spend much time in the front of the shop, except for things like swapping the owls over. They swapped them every three hours so that they all had a chance to stretch their wings. He spent the majority of his time in the aviary (If you could even call it that - it was so huge), caring for the owls and training the younger ones.
“On your list of apologies.” He said, studying the freckles on his nose.
After winter break, the slytherin gang returned anew, often found in fits of laughter in the eighth year common room - or pelting each other with snowballs in between every class. They would sit at their desks casting drying spells, their eyes bright. By the time spring rolled around, each one was as outgoing as they had been before, and had even formed some delicate friendships outside of the traditional house groupings.
"Nice, classic. I think I'll go for a four cheese toastie and a latte. Anything else?"
“Are you really trying to get a child to pick favourites?” Harry asked, trying to ignore the butterflies in his stomach as he watched Draco fawn over Teddy.
Draco looked up at her, an enthusiastic smile on his face. "Can we do that thing that the muggles were doing?"
Harry slowly raised his head and met the sight of the Slytherin’s knees. Since when had he got so close? He craned his head up to look at the blond’s face. Then Malfoy did the strangest thing, and that was saying something after the past few weeks. He crouched down to Harry’s level, taking in his features with a frown.
"No one can tame you." Draco chuckled. Pansy winked at him and leant back in her seat.
“So you’re not excited?”
Maybe he was wrong, maybe it wasn’t Malfoy. Sixth year had certainly proven that he wasn’t the best at handwriting. But it added up, the ‘limelight’ , the ‘cowardice’, the ‘family’. And who else had been close enough to him to comment on his freckles, or lips, or eyes, and still matched the things that had been said like Malfoy did?
“Fuckkk…”
Dreams of Draco’s lips chased him relentlessly, only for him to wake up breathless, his legs tangled in the sheets. Each time he woke, he was quickly dragged back under, finding himself once again pressed in the doorway of the shop, pouty pink lips pressed against his. The taste of Draco lingered in his mouth, sweet and bitter all at once.
There was one bird that never went to the front of the shop. Alfie was a middle-aged barn owl, with a friendly nature, but his magic didn’t quite work. Pearson had told Harry of how he had been one of her first hatchlings when she inherited the shop, and how she had grown fond of him. And so, Alfie was the resident VIP.
They continued on, lips swollen, warm with drink. When they finally reached the flat, Harry dug out a spare set of pajamas and a towel, and left Draco in the spare room. He went through the motions of getting ready for bed, the whole process taking far too long and making him feel nauseous. He downed half a glass of water before climbing into bed and falling into a restless sleep.
It was clear that Mr Potter was overcome with emotion, and so we ended our discussion there, parting with thanks.
Let me know your thoughts, thanks for reading!
His breathing came fast and the room spun around him. He kicked off his shoes as he fell onto his bed. He closed his eyes, counting his breaths until sleep fell over him.
"You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want to go making friends with the wrong sort. I can help you there."
"Fuck yes! The way you said une belle vue. Shit!"
“Exactly!” He exclaimed, sitting back. “That’s what Potter did to me!”
"Who?"
~You should really clean up Teddy’s toys, Harry.~ She had laughed, and when Harry turned back to Nagini, all he saw was a toy snake on his rug. Hermione picked it up, shaking her head. ~If I’d had anymore to drink, I would have thought this was real.~
“What’s their name?” Harry was having a difficult time remembering how people normally spoke.
“Completely?” Ron asked.
“I told her how you saved my life! It’s not my fault she twisted my words!” Harry said, stepping close to the counter as his anger rose. Why did Malfoy always rile him so?
23rd May 2001
He was incredibly excited to see the results. Images of Harry’s proud face flashed through his mind, making his heart stop and stutter.
“I think witty is a bit generous.”
Harry huffed. “Well it certainly wasn’t to stay up all night grading mock exams.” He pulled a plate of pancakes towards him. “I had more than enough of my own bloody OWLs and NEWTs.” He grumbled. “Should’ve thought this through more.”
“I’m good. Got a whole day of first years today, you’d think they’d be better behaved this far into the year, but they can still be a bit tricky.”
Ron held his hands up in a helpless gesture. “You’ve seen how they look at each other! I feel like they’d fuck on Snape’s old desk if the mood took them!”
Draco smiled at him, taking Harry's face in his hands, kissing his forehead, then his nose, then each cheek, then finally his lips. It was slow and tender, sweet and yet still needy. It was perfect.
“Are the nightmares recurring? Often the same dream or dreams over and over again?” Draco propped his chin on his hand.
"As much as I'm happy to fuck you in a French hotel room, Malfoy, that is kind of the point."
"Have you told Draco?" Luna asked.
"What we were discussing earlier." He flicked his eyes over Ginny's shoulder at Luna, undecided whether or not he wanted her to hear what he had to say. The Ravenclaw was a nice, kind girl, and they were friends, but he didn't really want anyone else knowing. The only reason he was telling Ginny and not Ron or Hermione was because she basically already knew.
“I’m not homophobic. In fact…” Draco looked down at the floor, running his hand through his hair, seemingly suddenly anxious, “I’ve been waiting for this exact moment.”
He had already almost knocked the bottle off the table at the start of the meal (thank god for them both having a seeker's reflexes) and had to ask Draco about half of the dishes on the menu.When the food had arrived and Draco had seen Potter's face go funny, he had asked the waitress to bring an extra portion of chips. It seemed he was right, as by the time they had arrived Potter had eaten everything on his carefully put together plate. Draco had insisted they share and then sadly exclaimed how he had overestimated his appetite and insisted that Potter eat the rest for him.

"Mitchel…. What?"
Somewhere inside, Harry felt bad for putting him on the spot like this, but couldn’t find it in him to care right at that moment. “Since when were you friends?”
“They didn’t want any unnecessary reminders of my existence.” Harry had said with a shrug.
A shower - that's what he needed. And maybe a coffee too. Yes, he just needed to wake up a bit.
Harry didn’t know what to say. Lucius had been sent to Azkaban after the war, thanks in part to Harry’s testimony (amongst countless others). Clearly, though, Malfoy held no hard feelings about it, nor no warm feelings towards his father.
"Still, thanks so much!" Harry resisted hugging him again.
"Merlin tits. Bring him up if you must." Harry snapped. He almost felt bad, but he didn’t have the energy to process the guilt as well as his anger at that moment.
“It’s hard not to, given all the saviour behaviour.” Draco joked.
Harry snorted. “Yeah right. What does daddy think of all of this, huh? Cavorting with muggleborns and the children of the people he fought?”
How we feeling, folks? ;)
“You’re welcome.” Draco said smugly. The waitress brought over their drinks, placing them down in front of their respective drinkers. “I agree with him, anyway.”
"Look at us, huh? Scar head and scar chest…" He chuckled slightly.
"It's quite obvious, Harry." She said.
"Ah yes, I remember the day I chose my own name."
"In my bedroom? Yes Potter, we are. On my bed."
"Narcissa Malfoy, I sentence you to exile. You are not to return to Great Britain without express permission of the Minister of Magic. You are also to pay a fine of 500,000 galleons to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to help pay for reparations."
“Good. I’ve been crafting this bad boy image for years.”
He caught a glimpse of Luna and Tonks at the next table over. Walking over, he shook his head. “You should tell your husband not to be so rude.” He joked, sitting down. Again, nothing.
Harry lifts his head, looking at Draco with red eyes. “People don’t believe me when I tell them you’re a sop.”
McGonagall nodded goodbye and the two women swept out of the portrait. Draco sighed loudly and flung himself onto the sofa, rubbing his eyes.
"Ah yes, Granger," Draco murmured.
Harry Potter could be his boyfriend. How long had he wanted this? Nine years? He could go on dates with Harry Potter. He would know how he took his tea, how his day at work was. He felt giddy.
How had it taken him so long to realise this? Teddy was nearly two! Everytime Draco saw him, Teddy had had white hair. Once or twice, he had caught a glimpse of lighter brown hair, but had blamed it on a trick of the light, because whenever he was there, his hair had been white. He supposed it should be a compliment, though since he lived with Andromeda, he probably didn’t find her brown hair very exciting.
"Malfoy!" Potter waved as he crossed the street. He was wearing a black button up shirt, untucked over some tight black trousers. Draco wondered what his arse looked like. He looked smart, sexy. He hadn't managed to tame his curls, but Draco actually prefers it. He wondered if he'd ever admit it.
“So, what can I do for you?” Draco tried not to giggle as Sylvia licked his cheek. When he looked back at Potter, he was watching him with something akin to affection. How odd.
“How in Merlin’s name did you come to that conclusion? I did nothing but sing your praises!” Harry ran his hands through his hair, his barely-contained emotions starting to spill out. “I even told her about the bloody manor and the stinging hex!”
Tonks looked at her glass, taking a sip of champagne. “I really admire your Father’s work, you know.” She said.
Draco joined in. “No, but it would lump you in with the majority for the first time in your life.”
“Bloody twat, you’d think Dumbledore would’ve found some excuse to kick him out by now.” Ron cut in, scowling at Malfoy over Harry’s shoulder.
He headed to the changing rooms, wanting to shed his cloak before taking to the skies. As he entered, the sound of running water greeted him and he stopped. Who was in here at this hour? He caught sight of a pair of pale slender hands as they hung up a towel. Malfoy?
And that was all he needed to hear. Draco kissed him fiercely, running his hands over Potter's top, trailing his fingers over the bare skin where it had ridden up. Potter wrapped his arms around Draco and sat up, Draco straddling his lap as he pulled his top over his head. He ran his fingers over his chest hair before reaching round to scratch his back. Potter hissed into his mouth and Draco felt the noise go straight to his cock.
Draco watched as the hazy figure of his best friend strutted over to him.
Harry slipped under his arms, taking a deep breath. It was always so hard to think with the other boy so close. "I mean," He started, looking at his feet. "That we've been doing all this-" He motioned between them, "for the last six weeks, and for what?"
“Lovegood, how are you?”
Malfoy visibly brightened, seemingly having only just noticed the Ravenclaw. He came around the counter to kiss her on the cheek. “Luna, ma chérie. What brings you here?” Harry tried not to snort at how much Malfoy sounded like a nosy housewife.
“Would you like me to use those words exactly, master?” Kreacher asked.
"Do you want my mouth around your cock, Potter?" The darker boy moaned loudly at his words.
“That’s a yes.”
“You do realise it wasn’t a gift, Potter. It was an exchange of goods. You paid. That’s the end of it.” He shook his head patronizingly, turning around as if to walk away.
"Thank you for doing this with me, Luna." Harry said. The anger from earlier sat just barely contained inside of him, after having read the Daily Prophet article. It was full of lies and mis-truths, exaggerations and embellishments. Why had he thought he could trust Rita Skeeter?
No.2 Snorkel in the Red Sea
None of that could happen right away of course, he still had to sort through artifacts, photos, abandoned belongings, furniture,  strip the carpets and wallpaper, scrub all the nooks and crannies, fix broken floor boards, repaint, retile - the whole bloody works. He preferred to do it the muggle way, it felt so much more rewarding. It should have been daunting, but as Harry sat on the floor of one of the spare rooms, old clothes covered in grime and dust, sipping a beer as Lucy wound her way around his legs, he only felt hopeful. It was a refreshing feeling, having so much time ahead of him, and so little to worry about.
Harry emerged, camera in hand.
Draco smirked and took a sip of his drink.
“You never asked.” Harry deflected. Jeez, was this really the conversation they were having?
“What do you mean?” Draco finally broke the stunned silence.
"Cheers, Malfoy. So do you, although you always look smart." he blushed as he said it. That just won't do, Draco decides. He looked far too adorable.
“You Slytherins, you’re so quick to be aresholes.” Potter answered.
Harry let out a loud groan as he stretched his arms above his head, his eyes screwed shut as he shook off the sleep from his muscles. Draco watched him from the corner of his eye, his gaze drawn to the sliver of dark skin that peaked out from under Harry’s t-shirt as he stretched. As Harry dropped his arms and opened his eyes, Draco turned away - not wanting to be teased by his boyfriend for being caught staring.
“What lies? We both know what I did." Draco sneered. "We both know what a huge fucking cock I am.” His voice broke, his eyes cast to the ground as his shame crashed down around him.
"Evening, mate." Ron called.
“Thank you, Lovegood.” Pansy smiled devilishly. “Now listen closely, because this needs to go well.”
“Shut up.” He chuckled, his shoulders easing a bit.
“I miss them.”
"We can't! We have classes!"
"I'm good, thank you. Is my medicine ready?"
"Since I've been missing DADA classes all term."
“I’d like to apologise for um, well, what my snake said the other day.”
Harry stopped a few feet away, looking at the two of them affectionately. "I never want to forget this." He lifted the camera to his face. "Say cheese!"
A short rap on the door signalled Draco Malfoy's entrance. The short, portly man spun round in his chair with a tight smile, gesturing to the seat before him.
"Thank you." Harry said as the elf bowed out of the room. He didn't know how Kreacher got the things he asked for, if he could disguise himself or something, but the elf always managed to fulfil the task.
“Alright! Merlin, can’t a girl bully her best friend every once in a while..?” She muttered, sipping her wine again. “How many times have you seen him now?”
Pansy cackled in glee, smacking him on the chest. "You're so bad!"
Maybe he should just forget the whole thing. He could just avoid Malfoy; it wasn't as if they bumped into each other regularly anyway.
-----
“I mean, it's not so bad, right? You could still make it.”
It was then that Draco saw the hoard of bees, not ten feet away.
Draco almost choked. “How did you know?”
Grabbing a flask and dropping a tea bag into it, he called out: “Kreacher, do we have any pastries? Donuts or something?” Barely two seconds had passed before a paper bag appeared next to his flask as he filled it with water. “Cheers.”
When he returned, he was carrying a rather large potion bottle, stoppered with a cork and sealed with wax. “You are to take three spoonfuls each night. No less, no more. Understood?” Sylvia was sniffing Potter intently as he leaned against the counter.
Water half-dripped, half-poured from their bodies, their chests pressed together, Harry’s fists still balled in Draco’s shirt.
Harry, on the other hand, felt queasy, the beer sitting in his stomach lurching at the man’s advances. The man was persistent, and had been for the past 20 minutes. He couldn’t see a way out, the oblivious bartender serving other customers and chatting away happily.  Harry could’ve taken him in a duel, sure, but not a fight if it came to it. It wasn’t as if he was going to use magic on an unarmed muggle.
The question was peculiar, coming from a man who hated Harry’s guts. But there Harry stood, panting, probably looking as frazzled as he felt.
“Of course, master.” Kreacher’s voice crept in from somewhere in front of him, but by the time he opened his eyes, the house elf was gone.
"Is that a threat Potter?" Draco teased.
“But I don’t even know what to wear.” Harry mumbled. Luna had invited him to a garden party, murmuring something about not having a rainbow. He knew that the 30th anniversary of The Quibbler was coming up, and so assumed it was for that. He was more than happy to support it, but wasn’t too keen to meet so many people. He’d done a good job of avoiding reporters and oddities in the past year or so, and wasn’t trying to change that anytime soon.
Harry looked at him quizically and Draco looked away with a cough. Something hot and wet splattered on his hand and he looked at it with wide eyes, coughing again as the taste of metal hit his tongue.
“Is too.” Harry’s voice is muffled as he leant over the bed, searching for a top.
“Language.” Snake-Draco reprimanded, watching his human counterpart. “This is Draco Malfoy?”
Pansy rested her hand on Draco’s knee, making him look up at her kind smile. “We’re still young, Draco. It’s easy to fall into the traps of immaturity.” She gave his knee a squeeze before sitting back. “At least you’re aware of what you’re doing, and ready to change.”
“Merlin, Weasley. Do you think I’m holding her at wand-point or something?”
“Alright, alright. Potter, I’m sorry I was an arse. I’ll help out, okay? That’s what I came here to say.” Draco looked down at his hands, unable to look at Harry any longer.
“Oh, Merlin.” Draco winced. “Fine. Do you want to come to dinner with me?”
Harry tried to smile back, but his mind was racing. “Edward can morphe? He’s a metamorphmagus?”
“We’re fine, Jolie garçon (pretty boy).” Malfoy copied his expression, steeling himself. “I’m sorry too. I say vicious things sometimes.” He looked away, his nerves too much. “If I get through these customers without getting my bollocks hexed off, I’ll even take back all of the things I’ve said.” He chuckled, nervously.
His feet carried him down to the dungeons, to where he knew Slytherin common room was. He had no way of getting in, and no chance of anyone letting him in. What would he say anyway? ‘Please let me in so I can punch Malfoy in his stupid face’? Not likely.
Draco shrugged. “I just hope it’s not Weasley. Luna would be- Holy mother of Merlin!” His jaw dropped, his wide silver eyes locking on Edward.
“I’m telling you, ‘Mione, if they’re having sex on my bed, you might have to stop me from killing them.” Ron took his arm from around his girlfriend’s shoulders to make a strangling motion. Hermione just rolled her eyes at him.
“Draco! Draco!” Harry burst into the shop, beaming from ear to ear. A witch and her child in the corner looked over curiously as Draco stepped down from the ladder where he had been restocking leaves.
The gryffindor blinked, before seemingly nodding to himself. He looked back up at the slytherin with a warm, joking smile. “Hey, if even a master wanker like you can change, I’m sure others can.”
“They’re beautiful together, aren’t they?”
He cleared his throat awkwardly as he tried to settle his nerves. "Sorry about last night, Potter." His voice came out much more timid than he intended and he frowned slightly.
Draco attached the letter and sent the owl back. Now he needed to find something to wear.
-----
“Does it work?”
Yeah, that's why he threw up blood last night - because he's perfectly healthy. Not. Draco stepped into the fireplace, flooing straight to St Mungos. He took the steps up to the second floor, pulling out the letter as he rushed up to the receptionist. He handed it to her, and she looked up at him with a perfectly generic smile. "One moment, please."
Draco’s heart was racing, Harry’s body heat behind him only making things worse. They’d never done this before. Never spooned, never even slept in the same bed. He knew it was only because Harry was half asleep, and still probably half drunk, but still his heart was in his throat. Draco listened to his breathing, trying to focus on anything but the growing warmth in his loins. Soon, Harry’s breaths lulled him into a shallow sleep.
His brave face lasted all of the sixty seconds it took for Potter to arrive and let him in, before he was struggling with the clasp of his cloak, struggling to breathe.
"Yes, he-"
Harry chuckles and pulls the sweater over his head, walking over to Draco. “What? Are you too much of a coward to admit how much you like me?”
“Why aren’t they coming in?” Harry asked, brows furrowing.
Harry ignored him, walking forwards to grab Draco’s sleeve, dragging him out of the shop. They stopped a few feet away. “I did not name my snake after you.”
Draco smiled devilishly. "Hmmm… I suppose so." The teasing didn't work however, as Potter beamed from ear to ear.
Potter gasped like a fish. "You're…?"
Potter looked like he was about to say something but changed his mind. He unscrewed the lid and dipped a finger in. Draco undid his own shorts and pushed them and his boxers to the floor, kicking them off. He took his cock in his hand and stroked it languidly, watching carefully as Potter spread his legs and traced the puckered point.
“Merlin, you sure he’s not poisoning you?” Ron said, eyebrows raised.
“I’d call that a job well done, Lovegood.”
“No, I’m here to stare into your eyes and profess my love.” Harry rolled his eyes, looking far too cute for someone Draco was supposed to dislike.
The sight of Potter's flabbergasted face was both adorable and hilarious. He really was easy to read.
Harry thought it over. Passion? The reasoning made sense...for anyone but Malfoy. Harry certainly felt strongly for him; a strong sense of hatred and loathing. But what Ginny was describing was different. She was describing something other than hatred…
"Will you be my boyfriend?" Harry asked, stepping close, so that they were breathing the same air. Both boys shared the same wide-eyed expression.
“I want to.” The darker man shrugged, as if his words hadn’t just sent a jolt of lightning through the blond’s body. He wanted to?
"Let me in."
“Oh, um, well..” Neville gulped. “We got chatting last week, after he, um, apologised to me.”
“Eh, same as it always is.”
“It’s okay, Harry.” Fred repeated.
"Hello, Hogwarts too?"
Draco tugged him along, leading them away from the crowds and into the streets. They walked for a few minutes before Draco lead him into a small restaurant, giving his name to the waitress. She smiled and nodded, leading them upstairs and onto a relatively private balcony.
“July, I think. She’s around eight months or so.”
“Ah-hah! You just admitted that your room is on this floor. You better lock your drawers, Monsieur Potter.” Draco sipped at his drink, his nerves settling as he allowed himself to relax a little into the banter. He took in the sight of Harry James Potter, his thigh just a few inches away, his dark skin glowing, his green eyes bright, his lips slightly chapped. He was gorgeous. Without thinking, Draco reached over to tuck a stray strand behind his ear. Maybe his emotions were heightened, but he just had to touch that jet black hair that he couldn’t stop dreaming about. Dreaming about touching the soft curls, pulling on them, the way Potter’s pretty little face would gasp. But he didn’t need to know that.
"Make that two," Harry said as he pulled out his wallet. Draco smacked his hands away.
-----
Lucy followed him diligently as he took the next flight of stairs down to the basement and into the kitchen. He put his coat and shoes down on the table before grabbing a pouch of food from under the sink. He squeezed the contents into Lucy’s bowl and then filled up her water bowl as the kettle whistled on the stove. He kept her bowls at the head of the dining table (though still on the floor), the small gesture making him smile every time he realised. Maybe he wasn’t ready for kids, but that didn’t mean he couldn’t spoil his little girl.
"All out, I'm afraid." Draco switched it on and pulled out two mugs. "How do you take your tea?"
“Sure, I’ll be one sec. Head up to the lounge if you want.” Harry looked at him curiously before heading down the hallway.
“I’m sure.”
“You can say that again.” Draco frowned.
“Yes, you are. You’re cute, and brave, and awfully stubborn. You have a ridiculously good arse, and horrific fashion sense.” Draco doesn’t know where the words are coming from, but he can’t stop them. Not when he’s never been so happy. “You snore like you’re trying to wake up the entire street, and you have an obsession with mixing foods that shouldn’t go together. You are more than people realise, Harry James Potter, and I love you for it.”
In the heat of the moment, neither had bothered to look at anyone else; too absorbed in each other. Prying eyes and low whispers followed them as they moved to the edge of the dance floor, and Harry worried at his lip.
Draco nods appreciatively, reaching to look at the wine menu as the waitress comes back.
“See, I told you.” Hermione nodded at Harry.
I hope you're free. I said we'd do something more low-key next time - how about a canal-side walk and an icecream on me?
Chapter 6
“Mmmm, I like that a lot; you calling me love.”
“Hey! I’m just stating the truth.”
“There’s nothing to sort out, Potter. That article is completely your fault.” Draco sniffed, walking back around the counter, wanting to distance them.
“Non, does that make me a bad cousin?"
“Please.”
Pansy shrugged. “I had a pint of water and a sandwich after you passed out. Woke up feeling perfectly fine.”
A place like this was always booked up months in advance, but the owner had a hunger for money, and Draco could easily persuade him to open up a table for them.
"But I'm sure we can get you some gillyweed - once you're old enough that is."
His red-headed friend nodded to himself, going over to the sink as he washed his hands.
“Just.. Sit back down, okay? We haven’t even finished our drinks.” Harry tugged at his hand. Draco obliged, sitting back down across from Harry. The two men sippied in silence for a minute. “So, this is a date?”
The afternoon had passed quickly, and the gryffindor couldn't help the smile that crept across his features as he remembered the looks he and Malfoy had shared. It was like they'd been friends forever, and was almost bittersweet when Harry thought about the time they had wasted hating each other. But things weren't that simple, were they? It wasn't just some school boy rivalry. There was a war, lives at stake, and what was done couldn't be changed.
"I'll tell you once I've got some of that in me." Draco nodded at the waitress as she dropped off the drinks. He passed two shots to Pansy and took two for himself.
Pansy hooked her arm through his and winked up at him. "Come on gorgeous, let's show the world what they're missing."
“Ah, Harry. Just in time. Could you help me swap them out?” The older woman greeted him with a nod. Paeson was probably in her early fifties, and was fit for her age. She was a very straightforward woman, who could easily be mistaken for cold; which was not helped by her grey hair being shaved short in a typically masculine style.
He let out a half-hearted chuckle. “Don’t be a sop.”
By Rita Skeeter
"To the future."
“How can I be excited when you won’t tell me what we’re doing?”
“I really don’t mean to be rude, but Draco’s been promising me a dance and Merlin knows he’ll wiggle his way out of it if he can.” Harry chuckled, giving the Slytherin a playful smack on the arm.
A bucket list. That's what the healer had called it. A list of things he wanted to do before dying. The finality of everything weighed heavily on Draco's chest. Breathe.
The blond held his hands up in surrender. “Okay, I won’t help you with your notes.” He laughed again.
He reached into the drawer to his right and pulled out a file, opening it up. "Your previous meeting was on the 15th May, and with today being the 24th, nine days have passed." He closed the file and frowned further. "You have our deepest apologies, Mr Malfoy."
“Hey.” What was he supposed to say?
"That's not what we were going to- ow!" Ron yelped as Hermione slapped him on the arm with a deathly glare.
Swooning didn't happen in real life did it? Draco was sure he was about to find out. He cleared his throat and settled a smirk on his face, slowly raking his eyes up and down Potter. He was wearing black denim shorts and trainers, and a red shirt that said "melanin king".
"Do you feel pressure to speak well of him?" I had asked.
“And leave you here all alone? You could have been rummaging through my underwear.” Potter smirked, throwing himself down next to him.
“Thank you.” He said, wiping his shoes and going through to the kitchen. It was impeccably tidy, as always. He looked around for his coat, finding it hanging on the back of the utility room door.
“Can’t sleep?” She plucked one from the bag, biting into it and leaving a smudge of sugar on her lips.
“Promise.” Harry nodded, heading towards the back.
"I don't want to get in trouble." Harry groaned, trying to ignore the tingles that were left on his skin by the blond's lips.
Draco turned to him, gaze cold as steel. "Don't come back to my shop."
"Nothing, Harry." Hermione turned to him a disconcerting smile. "Just that you seem to be spending a lot of time with Malfoy recently."
"Now?"
It's the climax baby ;)
They moved together for another few moments, their breaths falling in sync, their faces close together as they watched each other, silver orbs staring into emerald ones. The two men lost themselves to the music, to the feel of each other. Draco felt like he was floating, like there was nothing in the world except for this completely insane, yet perfectly sweet, moment. Finally, the music came to a close. They broke apart, joining in the applause for the musicians.
“Yeah, he apologised for always being so horrid to me.” Neville shrugged.
"I wouldn't go quite as far as that." Potter had the audacity to wink at him.
Potter suddenly pushed him away, the two of them panting. Draco was sure his cheeks were pink. "For fucks sake, Malfoy," Potter practically snarled, grabbing his arm and pulling him between the houses and pushing him up against the wall.
"No we don't. I'm more than happy to keep our relationship to a professional one." Malfoy looked pointedly ahead, refusing to look at the Gryffindor as he tried to walk away.
“Well when you say it like that, it sounds badly-thought-out.”
Harry Potter asleep on the sofa in the common room of the eighth year dorms when Draco came down to try and walk off another nightmare. The way the dying embers cast shadows across his cheekbones.
“Don’t use my full name!” She whined. “You know how much I hate-”
“Sure.”
There’s a pause, and then; “He’d crush Petunia to death.”
“Lucy?” Draco repeated, and at the sound of her name, Lucy jumped down from Harry’s chest. He peeked over as she trotted up to Draco, sniffing him intently. “When did you get her?”
“Yeah, why not?”
He looks up at him as he blotts the table cloth with his napkin, and frowns. "It's not funny Malfoy, I've really fucked this evening up." He sounds somewhere between pissed off and petulant.
"Merlins tits. So official! It's like I can't take a shit without having to write it down."
“You know what, Potter, everytime I see you it seems more and more likely.”
I wanted to portray the after effects of the war without it being the main plot, whilst also showing you guys the budding relationship of these two fools. I hope you liked it, and I hope I did it justice!
“Not really, we’d seen them about together though, do you remember?”
“How are you sleeping at the moment?” Andromeda’s voice pulled Harry’s gaze away from where he had been playing with Teddy. He was sat on her living room floor, surrounded with toys as he watched his god-son with adoration. He hadn’t spent as much time with him as he wanted in his eighth year, but he’d been quick to remedy that. Now he never went more than a few days without seeing them. Andy was a fantastic guardian to Teddy, and Harry found himself looking at her like a second mum, or maybe like a wise wine aunt.
Harry blinked away the water from his lashes, taking in Draco’s silver eyes tinted blue in the light, his pale skin glistening, his lips pulled up in an unsure bite. He looked exquisite, otherworldly, beautiful, dashing, gorgeous, so many words that he would need to learn and more, to even try and describe how incredible he looked, gazing up at him. His whole body felt the most alive it had in a while, his heart pounding, his skin tingling.
They moved through the crowd, followed by those endless whispers, and Draco spotted Pansy waiting at the bar with a smirk. "Good evening, gentlemen." She nudged their two abandoned drinks towards them, having obviously been watching their interaction with Balveer. "Quite a show you put on."
“Of course, dear. Are you sure everything is alright?” She asked concernedly, leaning on the counter.
“I’m surprised you haven’t seen him morphe; he only really does his hair at the moment. It usually changes to match the person he finds most interesting.” She shook her head. "Harry was just as oblivious, he only realised a couple of weeks ago."
Malfoy placed the coins on the counter, swiftly picking up the pouch with a nod. "Good afternoon, Miss."
"Yes, master?"
Potter,
Harry's eyebrows drew together as he thought it over, more confused now than he had been before. Why did he always feel out of the loop?
“Can I help you with something, Potter? Or are you planning to just stand there gaping?” The blond crossed his arms across his chest. Harry had to fight the urge to pinch himself after not seeing him for so long. This had to be some kind of joke. Why would he come to Malfoy for help? Of all the people in the world, he doubted anyone could top the list for "Most Awkward Person To Discuss Trauma Nightmares With" except Malfoy. Then again, there weren’t many people Harry did want to discuss them with. He mentally cursed. If it had been anyone except Luna who told him to come here, he would have marched right out and sent them a very 'expressive' owl (as Hermione would put it).
“I insist.” Potter looked over his shoulder. “The bar’s just there, right?” He said, taking off with a wave of his hand.
“This better be life or death.” Harry grumbled.
It didn’t really matter, as Harry slipped off of his stool, out of the grasp of the drunkard. “Draco!” He rushed towards Malfoy, ignoring his shocked expression. He pulled him into a tight hug, whispering one word in his ear:
He watched as Potter slowly slid his finger in, millimetre by millimetre, with a soft gasp. He got to the knuckle and then began pumping it slowly, his eyes closed and eyebrows knitted together. Draco thought he'd never seen something so beautiful. He watched as Potter pulled it out, slicking up another finger, before pushing the two in with a wince. Draco knelt next to the bed, his head between Potter's legs and kissed his way up his thighs.
Draco stood beside him, leaning casually on the bar. “You really don’t have to.”
“You’ve changed.” Harry held his gaze as he walked slowly forwards. “You didn’t give me empty apologies, you tried to do better. You are doing better.”
Harry finally knew the feeling in his heart. Maybe he had known all along, and had been unable to accept it, unable to accept the way he felt about Draco Malfoy. It certainly wasn’t anything he could put into words - and that's how he knew.
Draco looked to Harry, offering his hand a tight squeeze. He couldn’t believe how fast things had moved, but by Merlin, he was glad they had. He was looking forward to the future, and all the possibilities it held.
“Well, I’m not calling him by my own bloody name.” Draco smirked again. “Nice choice by the way.”
Harry spent the next couple of hours clearing all of the stuff from the grand bedroom into it’s private sitting room, airing it out and placing two hundred bloody sheets of newspaper on the floor. When he was done, he brought Alfie in and opened the cage, letting him free. This would have to be his home for now, until he could get him better. Sadly, he couldn’t trust Lucy with him, so he was confined to the room. Although very large for a wizard, it was still much smaller than the aviary, and only had about twenty feet of flying space. He unmagicked the door, making sure to not let Lucy in, and fastened the windows a couple of inches open so that there was plenty of fresh air.
"Sorry, I didn't mean it like that. I meant we should get away from all these eyes and go do something less… on show. More relaxed. We could go for a pint? Or a coffee?"
“They don’t want you.”
“Yeah. I think we were all too exhausted to go after each other.” The darker man chuckled, and the redhead joined in. Eighth year had been hectic, redoing their NEWTs whilst still dealing with the immediate after-effects of the war. Despite the remaining students being joined into one house, they struggled to regain closeness until the end of the year, and even then the Slytherins had kept on the edges of the group. Harry had seen Malfoy a lot, of course, but they had barely spoken apart from when needed, the occasional -can you pass the jam, please?-.
“Then why did you call it Draco a few minutes ago?” The slytherin tilted his head. “I know you didn’t see me.”
Draco's eyes fell closed, and his hand slid down Harry's face to land on his chest. Harry howled, a guttural, painful sound, as he held Draco's lifeless body. Their story was over, a book that had ended. It would be revisited often, the pages worn at the edges as Harry went back to remember it. One day, the book would be put on a shelf, never to be read again, and when someone asked him about it, Harry would smile sadly and think about what could have been.
Draco couldn't stop himself as he began sobbing, curling up in a ball on his bathroom floor. The tears left black smudges on his hands and shirt, and he gasped for breath, pulling at his hair. He cried for his mother, for the times he had shouted at her, not realising how much she loved him. He cried for his friends, for the times he had ditched them. He cried for his future, one that he would never have. He pressed his face into the floor, as his breathing slowed, his eyes screwed shut.
Draco took another swig of his wine, barely avoiding spilling it in his position. “Harry Potter, le garçon qui a survécu (the boy who lived). Rumoured to have had more than amicable relations with Hermione Granger, was seen with Cho Chang on multiple occasions, took Parvati Patil to the Yule Ball, dated Ginny Weasley.” He listed, holding up his fingers one by one.
“I’m sorry I hurt you, baby. But even you can’t be so dim as to not see how tense it is between me and my mother.”
"Now, you spend your remaining time however you wish." The healer smiled sadly at him. "We estimate two months, Mr Malfoy."
Pansy was in stark contrast to the Ravenclaw, her shoulder length black hair hanging pin straight, her eyes framed with carefully perfected eyeliner. She wore a tight fitting black dress and heels. The two opposites stared at each other.
“Uh-huh.”
“Andromeda gave it to me. I didn’t realise you were Edward’s god-father. I went and asked her on the off chance she had it from when you were in The Order, but apparently you see each other regularly.” Draco explained, raising an eyebrow on his aristocratic face. He walked over and sat in one of the plush armchairs.
Draco placed his bloody hand on Harry's cheek, a single tear falling from his eye. I'm sorry.
Andy came running in, bottle of milk still in hand, eyes wide. “What’s wrong?!"
Wait. Did Draco speak parseltongue?
“Yeah, something about ‘focusing on his NEWTs.'” Harry made air quotes around the words.
“You sure? You look a bit frazzled.” Neville’s eyebrows drew together in concern.
"You've never shown any inclination that you do."
“Alright. I can do that.” He agreed, offering his hand to Malfoy. The blond regarded it silently, his pointy features perfectly blank, before stretching out his own pale hand. Why did he have such nice hands?
After finishing their NEWTs, the trio had seemingly been on paths set for separation. Ron was training as a Junior Auror, and was soon going to start work on the field shadowing more senior Aurors. Hermione had gotten an apprenticeship working as an intern for a member of the Wizengamot; Herbert Thornley. He was an old half-blood, seemingly quite traditional, but very tired and more than willing to let his work be done by an enthusiastic young witch like Hermione. It seemed that on most matters he could quite easily be at least half-persuaded to change his opinion - and the rest of the time he was probably just eager to have her off his case. Harry, of course,was working part time at the owlery. This left him with a lot of spare time, which he usually spent with friends. Every so often, a burst of motivation would hit him and he would tackle another room at Grimmauld Place - there just happened to be a lot of them.
Snape studied his face for a second with a frown. "Get back to your dorm, Potter," he finally said.
Harry pulled open his bedroom door and Lucy jumped down from the bed with a soft meow. All the doors inside the house had charms on them to allow her to move freely about. “Kreacher.” Harry called as he walked down the hallway. The elf appeared in front of him, a grisly frown on his face. When his ‘ownership’ had officially passed onto Harry, he had gifted the house elf with one of his old tshirts; setting him free. Kreacher had confided that after spending all of his life working for the Blacks, he didn’t know much else, and wished to remain in the house. He had been more than happy to take up residence in the attic, and still offered to serve Harry. Harry hadn’t felt very comfortable with it, and had asked him more times than he could count to not call him master, but Kreacher had insisted. Still, Harry didn’t call on him often.
He shushed her, stroking her hair. Pansy had been a lot more tearful since the war, but that was usually after a glass of wine while she gushed about how much she loved everyone. Draco walked her to the sofa and sat her down.
“Since when were you so astute?”
“Shit! Did I miss the celebration party?”
Draco had watched the boy on the train, chatting to a girl with frizzy hair and a boy with bright red hair.
He locked the door behind him, and leaned heavily on the sink. He felt weaker by the hour, and it was harder than he thought to hide it from Potter. He poured a glass of water and downed it, his hands shaking. He would have to tell him, he knew he would. Later, he thought, taking another two pills. He was really only supposed to take one at a time but he didn't really care.
"Merlin, I cannot be dealing with you two teaming up against me." Draco groaned.
Draco's jaw dropped as the other man threaded his arm through his, feeling the heat radiating from him. Where did this man get such bloody big balls? He hadn’t even asked to link arms, just dove right in and grabbed him.  Draco wondered, not for the first time in his life, what it was like to be an unmannered Gryffindor. A second passed as Potter offered him a cheeky smile before catapulting them through the air, Draco squeezing his eyes shut to the churning in his stomach as he was apparated to fuck knows where. When he opened them, Harry was pulling his arm from his, walking ahead with a wave.
