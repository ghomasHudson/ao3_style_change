Over dinner at Ron and Hermione's that night, Ron simply gaped at hearing the news, muttered something about 'bloody Malfoy' and fished a Galleon out of his pocket and handed it to his wife.
It teetered, but settled back into place. Phew. He didn't want to smash it, not really. He needed Harry to pay attention, so he barked. Harry whirled around and Dog pushed the penguin gently with his paw, whining as he did so.
So, what to do with us? There was talk—fairly terrifying talk—of us all going to prison with our parents, but our salvation finally came—and I shouldn't have been surprised—in the form of Harry Potter and Professor McGonagall.
Draco nodded, and Harry unscrewed the lid, and coated his fingers. Dropping his fingers past his own balls, he pushed one finger into his arse. One eventually became two, which quickly became three, until Harry was gasping and writhing as he fucked himself with his own fingers. All the while, Draco lounged against the door, watching intently with a grin on his face.
If Harry had had a drink, Draco would have been showered with it. Harry wished he had; the bloody git would deserve it. To just come out with it like that? And how did he know, anyway? What should he do? Lie? Tell the truth? Run for the hills?
It was brilliant, though, how close he still was with the family, especially Ginny. It proved what they'd talked about when the first separated. They were better as friends.
Harry looked at the bottle and couldn't help but grimace. He was no wine connoisseur, but after months of dining with Draco, he had picked up a few preferences. And a Chardonnay was not one of them; especially not after that night at Pansy's. “Sorry, mate, I'm going to have to pass. I'll be bad after drinking that.”
of thanks. It was huge and like nothing he had ever experienced before; he never would have been able to  manage without her implicit—and written—instructions.
Draco's breath was taken away by the next couple. He was easily a Ten. Thick, dark hair. Bright eyes and a body Draco wanted to do shots off. His gorgeousness was only made more apparent when viewed next to what could only be described as the One stood next to him. Now, Draco was more than aware that he wasn't an expert when it came to finding women attractive, but, Merlin, the poor woman had nothing going for her, looks-wise. Her hair was lank and greasy, she had pockmarks covering her forehead, and the nose. Gah. You could house bats in there.
Draco looked torn between standing up to greet Harry and Disapparating on the spot. Harry didn't feel much better. He sat down in the chair opposite Draco for no other reason than if he hadn't, he would've fallen to the floor.
An awkward silence followed Glinda's words. Her smile didn't falter, she simply twiddled her thumbs on her lap.
, Zach.” Harry stood up straight and crossed his arms over his chest. A quick glance at Pansy and Draco told him that they had adopted the same pose. Harry knew he wouldn't fancy standing in front of them.
“I know,” Harry grumbled, rubbing his sore cheek. “Pansy already told me so this morning. Hermione, where is he?”
“Yes, heal it.” Draco chuckled again and stood up. “Why suffer when you don't have to? I'll just go and get my wand.”
Draco had been gone for two weeks, and Harry was miserable. True to his word, Draco fire-called him at least every other day, but Harry still missed him dreadfully. He hated sleeping alone. Harry had been busy, though; the café was as bustling as ever, and he was getting on well with decorating the house. Harry was determined to have it finished by the time Draco got back home.
Due to handy sunscreen spells—and the fact that he had never been out of Britain—Draco had never had to suffer with sunburn. But with the mid-June sun unreasonably hot, and the lack of a wand, Draco thought he was about to.
A small round of laughter bubbled from around the room, but Draco couldn't join in; his earlier hope was fading fast, and a quick look to Potter told him that he was feeling just as bad. Holding Hands Therapy. It
“In that case,” Draco said, reaching into his bag, “I have a bonus for you. You were awfully close to getting that Snitch, after all.”
Hermione had been very happy to explain the workings of the Muggle airport. She had tried to wheedle his destination out of him one last time before Harry finally snapped '
he looked, but he was pleased to note that it didn't bother him. His assumption had been correct; it
Glinda stood up straight and adjusted her glasses. “You'll just have to make the best of it. Maybe it will be of help anyway. See you at lunch.”
As Tilly banished the fifth mountain of balled up, scribbled on parchment—I could swear I saw her roll her big, bulbous eyes as she did so—I realised that I couldn't write down what I needed to say to you. I wanted to speak to you in person.
“Congratulations,” Fawkes said when the crowd was fully assembled. “Bob tells me that we have Hedwig and Darius to thank for such a successful mission.”
The children were—after being assured that there was no animosity between their parents—perfectly fine with the divorce. James simply wanted them to be happy, Albus wanted to know the in and outs of their future living arrangements and Lily was happy when she was told her new room could absolutely be yellow.
Draco didn't say anything, he just took a sip of his drink and gestured at Harry to continue. Harry laughed grimly.
Throwing his fork down with a clang, Draco took Harry's hand and practically carried him out to the thankfully empty gardens.
The members of BAHAHAHAH groaned. They didn't like to be remembered of that particular mission. It had taken five agents and a lot of work to fix the harmony in Gryffindor after that debacle.
Refolding the paper, Draco nodded to Harry and grabbed a piece of paper for himself; he had one more admission up his sleeve. He wanted to tell Harry as this was his only—and probably best—chance to do so, but Draco was still desperately worried that Harry would simply laugh in his face.
Harry noticed the insecurity in Malfoy's—Draco's—face and quickly shook the offered hand before  making a decision. “Draco, would you like to join me for dinner?”
“Keep them talking. Someone must have heard the ruckus and called the police. If not, damn the consequences—they're getting Stunned,” Harry whispered back, patting his pocket where he'd placed his wand.
Harry's smile fell. He would've much preferred Draco to come instead of Gerald, who was not the cleanest of people, and was currently picking at his belly button. Harry
It was about time he had payback for Harry kicking him out of the bedroom last night. He had been lovely and cosy. And they hadn't gone to sleep anyway. Dog had heard them for ages, playing about while he was stuck trying to get warm again in the cold living room.
to get to that ball. Harry ignored his team mates' shouts of encouragement as he concentrated on nothing but the Snitch and the man on the broom beside him, also flying expertly towards their shared goal.
“We should go and get dressed for dinner,” Malfoy said, placing his empty glass down and standing up. “I don't particularly fancy dining in nothing but a towel. And I highly doubt anyone else would want to see that either.”
Harry had never seen himself as a prude, but Ginny and Pansy's teasing about how his right arm would be stronger than ever after six months had made him blush harder than he ever had before. Which, in turn, caused the girls to collapse into laughter once more.
Harry turned slowly to look at the smirking face of the man who had spoken. He forced himself to not automatically look down at the man's waist.
Harry laughed awkwardly. “There's nothing to talk about. Sorry, I didn't mean to make it weird. It didn't mean anything. We were just tired; it had been a long day. Are you finished? We have the first appointment; I don't won't to be late.” He finished by standing up and holding his hand out for Draco.
All Harry could think about was the feel of Draco's lips against his own, the taste of Draco's cock in his mouth and the feel of Draco's arse pulsating around his cock. His mind was definitely
All in all, the rest of the year passed without incident. Of course, whenever we stepped foot in public, the papers were there, clambering for a quote and taking a few too many pictures. Throughout it all, Harry was brilliant. More than once, I asked him if it was worth it, and he always answered the same way: with a hurt look on his face, followed by a big kiss and a 'don't be an idiot'.
Draco soon realised why. They'd barely got through the first barrel of beer before Harry brought up the film.
“That feels ni—better, but I don't think it'll work. You're two feet taller than me; how about this?”
. Apparently the revolting pus was the main ingredient used for treating severe acne which was, you know, good to know. The work was more than a little bit disgusting but also inexplicably satisfying.
From the other side of the door they heard a loud booming voice call for silence from the students which had previously been causing something of a racket before requesting,
An excited rumble of students announcing to their friends that they were going to put their names in filled the air for a long moment, Fred and George sharing a blatant high-five where they sat further along the Gryffindor table. Even the Slytherin's, normally so cool and composed, had been caught up in the excitement and were whispering back and forth. At the Ravenclaw table it was obvious that students were trying to justify why they would make the best Hogwarts Champion, using logic and facts, whilst Hufflepuff was rapidly descending into a mess of giggles and nudging as they put each other's names forward.
Lucius finished closing up the house by locking the front door and strengthening the wards around the vast property. Linking her arm through his the couple shared a loving kiss before re-joining their son who was busy regaling his godfather with the latest adventure he’d had with
“Now, as I was saying we are to have the honour of hosting a very exciting event over the course of the coming months, an event which has not been held for over a century,” Dumbledore continued, drawing their gazes away from Moody and over to where he stood positively beaming down at them, his eyes twinkling bright. “It is my very great pleasure to inform you that the Triwizard Tournament will be taking place at Hogwarts this year.”
Technically speaking students were permitted to decorate their rooms but, as Ramona had been reminded on several occasions since her talent as an amateur interior designer had begun to blossom during their fourth year, there was a limit to what was actually allowed.
They'd been together for almost two years, ever since Draco had come out as gay, and he'd thought their relationship was only going to get stronger as they grew older. Apparently his ex-boyfriend hadn't felt the same way, being two years older than Draco, and had dumped him the day before he'd graduated from Beauxbatons not the previous year but the year before, publicly informing the younger teen that he “wanted to be free to see whoever he wanted as he pursued his chosen career path” and that he “didn’t want to be tied to an underage wizard who couldn't contribute to his future plans.” It had been humiliating…
“I think the muggles call it bisexual,” Ron supplied with a shrug. “He's dated witches and wizards. In fact his most serious relationship was with a wizard. Mum was sure he was going to be the first one to settle down but then something went wrong and he's single again.”
“You are preoccupied, my dear,” Professor Trelawney announced mournfully as the class took their seats, standing over them and blinking down at Harry through her thick glasses. “My
Javier held on to his annoyance for a barely a moment before tilting his head to allow Claude better access to his neck and thus demonstrating his forgiveness. Rolling her eyes towards her brother Ramona missed the moment when, as he turned to leave the Great Hall, Viktor Krum paused to shoot the smallest of smiles towards the startled Miss Granger.
If it hadn't been for everything that had happened at the Quidditch World Cup during the summer the way everyone had been behaving might have been amusing, the half-sentences a sign of an amusing or exciting secret but as it was they just served to make him all the more paranoid about the coming school year. His only comfort was the fact that Ron and Hermione, his best friends since their first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, were just as confused as he was by everyone's strange behaviour that morning.
Hopping down from her lap the little boy tore out of the room, his smart little shoes thudding on the stone floor of the hallways until he reached the stairs at which point they heard him thudding up the wooden stairs as quickly as his little legs could carry him.
He loved the feeling of being so high up, something that he had come to love ever since discovering flying and Quidditch, and the way the wind moved around his body, turning whatever he was wearing into a second skin. He hated the smell, the fact that with every step you risked crushing a tiny skeleton beneath your foot and the hundreds of eyes that were constantly watching your every move. Hermione, on the other hand, hated pretty much everything about the Owlery and so had been happy to leave him to write his letter.
He couldn’t stop himself from glancing back over his shoulder at the still silent fourteen-year-old, meeting the stunning pair of green eyes with his own for the briefest of moments before he turned his attention to where he was going, following his Headmistress back up the stairs. A high-pitched squeal was all the warning he received upon re-entering the
Draco giggled softly as he watched her wiggling her feet, safely ensconced in a pair of sturdy but stylish high heeled boots which were most definitely suitable for walking in, a pair that would have been perfectly impossible for her to
Dinner was a tense affair, everyone anxious about the ceremony that was too follow, and Draco wasn’t the only one left with little to no appetite. Javier hardly ate any of his main meal but polished off his desert in record time whilst Claude was the opposite, skipping the sweet treat entirely. Of their group only Ramona seemed in fine appetite, even going so far as to help herself to Draco’s leftover desert after he’d picked out the bits that he fancied.
’ from those convicted of witchcraft, a legal device that spared anyone from hanging who was able to read a passage from the Bible. This statute was repealed by Henry's son, Edward VI, in 1547.”
’ whilst Harry and his fellow Gryffindor’s made their way to the opposite side of the castle for their ‘Charms’ lesson.
Several of the paintings on the wall nearest to him gasped fearfully, disappearing from their frames, whilst others called out to demand he silence himself. Harry sighed sadly, wiping his eyes briskly before pushing himself up to his feet so that he could begin his journey back to the tower. It seemed that even the paintings were afraid of hearing his name spoken aloud.
Eventually Dumbledore climbed to his feet, effortlessly silencing the entire room as he offered the gathered students a smile and spread his arms wide, his palms facing up.
Draco joined in with his friend’s laughter as he watched the twin nearest to him turn and pounce on his brother, his hands grabbing for purchase on his robes as they rolled together.
“Perhaps another time…” he mumbled, offering the deputy headmistress an apologetic smile before focusing on the students gazing up at him once more. “Where was I? Ah, yes, the Triwizard Tournament…well, some of you might not know what this Tournament involves so I hope those of you who
As they began limbering up, going up onto the pointes of their baby blue ballet shoes, the rest of them took their places. Formal etiquette was part of the curriculum at
“That’s the rumour,” Cedric Diggory responded softly to his mumbled query. “But my dad says that most of the rumours about Professor Moody come from people he’s arrested.”
Hermione was disgusted by them, muttering about the death tolls which had been mentioned, whilst poor Neville had seemed utterly terrified by the prospect of entering.
“I would have gone to Madame and suggested that Josephine and I share with Nina and Adelaide were it not for the fact that Skye, Desiree and the ‘
were led across to the table farthest away from where Draco was sat, the boys waiting politely for the girls to take their seats first before dropping down onto the benches alongside them.
Stepping into the sitting room she was unsurprised to find her parents sat on opposite sides of the room, her father sitting at the writing desk going through official looking papers while her mother reclined on the sofa in front of a roaring fire. Druella Black, nee Rosier, did not look her forty-nine years thanks to the potions and charms she used daily in order to maintain her appearance which had led to her being confused with her eldest daughters, Bellatrix and the twins, Andromeda and Apolline. Unlike her sisters Narcissa took after their father, at least in looks, and had had a lifetime of unkind comments about her blonde hair.
she responded, smiling as innocently as she possibly could. None of them were fooled in the slightest; they’d seen that smile too often.
“Look, it’s always you who gets all the attention, you know it is,” Hermione had explained her reasoning earlier when Harry had expressed his disbelief regarding her assessment of Ron’s behaviour. “I know it’s not your fault. I know you don’t ask for it but, well, you know.”
use transfiguration as a punishment!” McGonagall cried, rounding on Professor Moody once more who reached out to grab hold of the back of Fleur’s robes when the Slytherin attempted to storm off with an indignant huff. “Surely Dumbledore told you that?”
“You could come with us,” she pointed out softly, rubbing a hand across the ribs she had hurt which were now tingling strangely as they healed. “You did what was asked of you, Severus. You became a spy for the ight at your own expense. If anyone deserves the opportunity to wipe the slate clean and get a fresh start it’s you. Lucius, don’t you agree?”
The Triwizard Tournament was all anyone could talk about on the way back to their dormitories, packs of excited, frustrated, disappointed or just plain angry students hurrying along the corridors or up and down the changeable staircases. Unsurprisingly the twins were still determined to enter despite being underage and Ron was wholeheartedly encouraging them, his eyes glazed over with the thought of the prize money.
“Well…it is amazing,” Bagman began, his voice shaking as he rubbed at his smooth chin, all the while smiling down at Harry. It made Harry feel particularly uncomfortable, like a pawn in a game of chess. Sadly, this wasn’t an altogether new feeling for ‘
student who had caught his attention rose gracefully from his seat, smoothed out his uniform and swept up between the Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff tables. His sharply defined features gave nothing away in regards to his feelings about being chosen, unlike Krum who’s joy had been clearly evident. Draco Malfoy was all about refined composure. “It’s him...”
“Don't worry, Madame Maxime,” Dumbledore was quick to reassure her, gesturing with one of his hands towards a man who looked as though he would be as tall as Madame Maxime as he continued. “Our gamekeeper, Hagrid, is more than capable of seeing to them.”
His immediate instinct was to get angry but Claude’s words were still lingering in the back of his mind and so, with a deep sigh, he forced his anger to recede and offered Fleur a smirk.
“You should’ve told us you’d entered!” Fred, the owner of the too tight grip bellowed as he pulled Harry around to stand between him and his twin. Both of them looked half annoyed, half impressed as George demanded, “How did you do it without getting a beard? Brilliant!”
Chaos descended upon the room as the grey haired twins rolled around on the floor, wrestling with one another over whose fault their predicament was whilst the majority of the
Well, apart from that time when some of them believed Harry was the heir of Slytherin but to be honest they could be excused for thinking that as the evidence against him had been pretty damning for a while. But unlike everyone else the Hufflepuff's had at least apologised to him for believing the rumours, even Justin Finch-Fletchly who had been on the receiving end of the infamous snake incident. And they had a

None of it is literally copy/pasted as I consider that to be cheating (and borderline plagiarism which is not acceptable in my book.)

Just wanted to warn you.
It was because of the school song that Draco was finally able to locate his elder cousin due to the fact that she was one of the few students, even amongst the Slytherin’s, who wasn’t singing. Fleur DeLacour, just like her younger sister, had inherited the delicate looks that were common place within the Black family. Her hair, an even brighter shade of platinum blonde than either Draco’s or her sisters, was cut into a bob and styled into messy waves.
Even as he smiled down at the now bouncing boy he couldn't help but share a slightly terrified look with Hermione. Colin he could handle, in small doses, but
“I'm not sharing with Fabian,” Javier reassured his boyfriend with a fond roll of his eyes, pausing to throw a handful of sweets into his mouth, grimacing at the taste the mixture of unusual flavours had created. “I'm sharing with Jan, Jan Boerefijn not Jan Mattheson.”
“Well, yes, I suppose so,” Crouch agreed, equally as mystified as Draco’s fellow champions by his decision to willingly add to his workload. “It shall be left up to each champion to decide whether or not they wish to sit the exams. Now I really must go, I’ve left young Weatherby in charge…very enthusiastic…a little bit over-enthusiastic, if truth be told…”
Harry's attention was drawn away from his best friends by the concern he could hear in Hannah Abbott’s voice, prompting him to twist his body so that he could look back over his left shoulder to where the boy she was addressing was sitting. Neville was pale, unusually so, his hair and clothes looking more unkempt than usual, and his hands were trembling.
Normally the fact that he had Care of Magical Creatures next would’ve cheered him up but the fact that it would be the first lesson he shared with the Slytherin’s since the champions were selected meant that it was the slowest he’d ever made his was down to Hagrid’s hut.
“I should never have let you go by yourself today,” Lucius murmured, his voice noticeably choked as he followed his wife out of the room. Simultaneously they raised their wands, both made of smooth black wood, and began casting spells to lock all of the windows and close up the shutters, to cover the chandeliers and any furniture they weren’t taking with them in dust sheets. “I knew how they were react and still I let you face them alone.”
“So she thinks Durmstrang would have suited her, does she?” she huffed angrily as she returned to her seat, producing a worryingly thick book seemingly from nowhere and opening it on her lap. “I wish she
, but nothing happened. Instead he found himself thinking that the grey of his eyes was all wrong, that the colour was too bright, and that the shape wasn’t right, too soft and round. “I didn’t put it in. I was telling the truth.”
“I'm sure Professor Dumbledore will tell you,” Mrs Weasley responded calmly before fixing her gaze on the two identical faces appearing and disappearing behind those of the others. “Now, behave, won't you?
“This one’s free,” Hermione announced, relieved, and ducked into the compartment. She settled down onto one of the long bench seats, the ancient springs protesting loudly. “Come on, Ron. No point worrying about it now. We'll just have to wait and see what happens.”
All but tumbling into the fourth year boys dormitory Harry spun around to shut the door behind him as quickly as possible, pressing his back against it when he was done. It was only then as he leant back against the unrelenting wood that he noticed Ron lying on top of his bedcovers, fully dressed but for his shoes which had obviously been carelessly kicked off.
“Sorry,” Harry murmured, pulling himself away from the blushing thirteen year old girl even as the twin’s demands went unanswered and the platform disappeared completely from view. Letting out a huff the twins pulled the window closed with a loud bang and stormed off to find out what their group of friends knew. “Let's go and find a compartment, guys.”
when we travel or you might lose him,” Lucius, the first of the three adults to recover, informed him. Draco nodded so vigorously his platinum blond hair fell into his eyes. “How about you say goodbye to Uncle Severus whilst mummy and I get the house all shut up? It’s almost time for us to go to our new house.”

Professor Snape was a nightmare at the best of times but since his name had been drawn from the cup it had become even worse, as though the foul-tempered Potions Master had decided that his purpose in life was no longer to teach but to make Harry’s life miserable.
plunged into silence, no one daring to make a sound as they all listened to what he had to say. Even the various teachers seemed to be frozen in place, none of them moving to intervene and put an end to the confrontation. “Niece of Bellatrix and Rodolphus Lestrange…or should that be Bellatrix and
“It is also my painful duty to inform you that the inter-house Quidditch Cup will not take place this year,” Dumbledore’s apologetic voice dragged his thoughts back to the address being given, prompting him to react loudly along with his fellow pupils. No Quidditch? That…that was unimaginable… “This is due to an event that will be starting in October, and continuing throughout the school year, taking up much of the teachers’ time and energy.”
Battling his way through the overeager crowd he finally made it to the winding staircase, climbing them two steps at a time in his haste to get away from the exuberant celebration.
Ramona was the first to respond the loud announcement which echoed magically throughout the entire carriage, Madame Maxime's easily recognisable voice calling for her students to assemble in the common room. It seemed that the time had come for the, to make their way to the why there
Offering the younger student a parting nod Cedric turned and disappeared through a door to the right of the grand marble staircase, rapidly descending down the stone steps which had been concealed behind it and before the door could swing shut completely Harry heard him let out a joyful whoop, announcing his presence to his housemates who began to cheer.
“Just because you'll be in the same building as them doesn't mean you'll actually have to talk to them,” Javier piped up, correctly pinpointing the thing holding him back. Of the four of them he was the most perceptive at reading other people, gauging their moods in no time at all and somehow always knowing what to say. Unfortunately the same could not be said about the rest of them so when Javier himself was the one upset or in a foul mood it took them a little longer to pinpoint the reason and find a solution. “Honestly, if they're as brainwashed as your parents think they are then they probably won't want to talk to you anyway. You're a
His mother had always helped out in the shop when needed, even more so now that Lucius was in charge of brewing the various potions and ointments and couldn't therefore man the counter all of the time, but she had also managed to add to their regular income by creating illustrations for a magical children’s magazine, sketching and painting little scenes when they were needed and had even turned her hand to creating humorous cartoons just recently.
“You seem to have given this a great deal of thought, Moody,” Karkaroff pointed out. “And a very ingenious theory it is…though, of course, I heard you recently got it into your head that one of your birthday presents contained a cunningly disguised basilisk egg, and smashed it into pieces before realising that it was a carriage clock.” Here he paused briefly as Madame Maxime let out a loud titter. “So you’ll understand if we don’t take you entirely seriously…”
His uniform, bought on a trip to Diagon Alley with Mrs Weasley, fit much better than his pyjamas although as was his habit he purposefully left his top button undone and wore his tie as loosely as possibly, the knot small and tight. Running his fingers through his messy hair he regretted not letting Mrs Weasley cut it before school had started, the long strands even more difficult to tame than usual, but Ron was trying a new style and wanted “a bit of support” so he'd let himself be talked into leaving it to grow out a little bit more. First chance he got, however, he'd be having a couple of inches taken off to help tame the mess.
, both of whom decided to age themselves up a little, too. Though I must say, neither of their beards is anything like as fine as yours.”
“Oooh,” Hermione literally shuddered as the three of them climbed into the relative shelter of the carriage behind Neville. “I wouldn't fancy crossing the lake in this weather.”
“Dad says that you will never find one at the scene of the crime, though their fingerprints might be all over the guilty wand,” Ron continued after swallowing his food, focusing on scooping up some of his scrambled eggs which were covered in beans. “Mum says they’re disgustingly rich and think themselves above working for a living. She says that Lucius Malfoy was always happy for others to do the hard work and then take the credit for it even when they were at school. And supposedly they were only allowed to leave the country after they bribed the judge presiding over their case with an
“Oh, Professor, look!” Lavender suddenly cried out as the end of the lesson approached rapidly, gesturing to her chart with the feathered end of her quill. Trelawney leaned over to study the page. “I think I’ve got an unexpected planet! Oooh, which one’s that, Professor?”
She had intended to walk off her meeting with her parents but that wasn’t possible now and so, raising her wand with her trembling hand, she apparated herself home to Malfoy Manor.
Hermione’s query drew all of their attention to the top table which had several more empty seats than usual, McGonagall and Hagrid predictably amongst the missing faculty members.
“Your own family is no longer good enough for you, is that it?” he mother demanded, dragging her into the extravagant dining room which took up most of the ground floor of the house. One wall was completely filled by the ‘Black Family Tapestry’ upon which ever member of the family was magically recorded at birth or marriage, depending on how they entered into the family ranks. “Fine. You always were a weak little bitch, ungrateful of the advantages life’s given you. You’ve never belonged in this family and so now I
“I didn’t,” Harry defended himself, staring up at the older boy who somehow appeared even more attractive in the low candlelight. In the past Harry would have expected his body to respond with an awkward feeling of arousal when their eyes met, just like it had when they had been introduced at the
Hagrid had seemed genuinely confused by their lack of enthusiasm for the creatures so after sharing a pointed look with his friends Harry, Ron and Hermione put on a rather impressive performance, giving the illusion that they were not only enjoying themselves but that they thought that rearing the new breed of monster Hagrid himself had bred was a fantastic idea.
even if he did appear to have no sense of fashion or style whatsoever given that, as well as the birds nest on top of his head, his clothes were in desperate need of tidying up. It might be the end of the day but that did not mean that you should go around in such a scruffy state, or so Draco thought; you shoulder either wear your school uniform with pride or change into your own clothes.

“Which explains why you're already here taking over my room like it was your own,” Draco chuckled as he resigned himself to having absolutely no privacy in his private room, not that it would have been any different back at
Claude grumbled softly, annoyed that he wouldn't be able to play matchmaker with his single friend…until he remembered that Ramona was as footloose and fancy free as Draco.
And most importantly as the figure in his mind shrank from 6’1 to 5’7 at the most the baby blue eyes which had always sparkled with self-assuredness transformed into a mesmerising pair of emerald green orbs concealed behind thin panes of glass surrounded by a wire rim.
Most of the students seemed very excited by the prospect of the Tournament and Harry had to admit it did sound like it would a fun thing to witness. He couldn't imagine putting his name forward as champion, however, given that his life was already difficult enough as it was. What did he need with most exposure in the media and a dangerous contest to win?
Claude, the only one of their group not actually working on his schoolwork as he had already finished everything he needed to and was now just keeping them company, huffed loudly.
It was another mad dash at the other end of the short journey, the four of them sprinting up the stone steps in order to get inside the grand building which served as their school without getting too wet in the torrential downpour. Unfortunately a run in with the schools most mischievous poltergeist left Ron completely soaked from head to toe anyway, Peeves delighting in causing chaos as he dropped enormous water balloons down on top of them.
He wanted to become a Healer, a difficult task in of itself, but as he wanted to specialise in Mind Healing he needed to achieve top grades in order to get onto the courses he needed.
Someone snorted behind him, the sound drowning out a shocked gasp from someone else, and Harry watched as his enemy floundered for a moment before reaching for her wand…
Harry really couldn't blame Ron for slamming the door shut with enough force to break the glass in the window following the Slytherin gang’s departure, heading off in search of the trolley and poor students to torment, not after what had been said regarding his family.
Odette eagerly danced forwards to the front of the line, fussing with the layers of stiff tulle which made up the skirt of her baby blue tutu until they sat exactly how she wanted them to. She had laced the bodice of her dress as tightly as possible to give her ample cleavage.
Originally he'd intended to lounge about the Gryffindor common room until breakfast but he found himself struck by a need to be outside and so, making his silently through the deserted castle, he slipped out of the nearest entrance into the courtyard. From there his feet took him on a meandering walk around the lake, past the
Harry didn't know why people ignored Hufflepuff or hoped that they wouldn't be sorted into the yellow house with almost as much fervour as they hoped not to be placed in Slytherin. All of the Hufflepuff's he knew were all hard-working and loyal almost to a fault. They got along with everyone, even some of the Slytherin’s, and never seemed to listen to rumours.
“In the hopes of fostering positive inter-school relations,” Claude added with a smile so charming that Harry couldn’t stop his gaze from lingering on the soft looking lips, a fact which neither of the older boys failed to notice. “You are in your Fourth Year, correct?”
Unfortunately they had taken this, somehow, to mean Ramona. They had been convinced for years that he and Ramona were dating in secret and had done everything to make her life as difficult as possible out of nothing more than petty jealousy and, although they had now accepted the fact that they weren't dating, they still envied her for their friendship.
been this bad before. She feared that her ribs, where the pain was only increasing, were in fact broken.
“Tell us what's happening at Hogwarts?” Fred bellowed out of the window after forcing his way through the others, literally pushing them aside in his haste which left Harry pressing Ginny up against the partition wall. George followed his twin, plastering himself to the others back as he too leaned his head out of the window. “What rules are they changing?”
Harry and Ron fell upon the food like they hadn't eaten in days rather than the mere hours it had been whilst Hermione, as per usual, took a much more sedate pace and loaded up her plate only after careful consideration of what she wanted to eat. Harry loaded up his with anything that was within easy reaching distance. Ron didn't bother to load his plate at all.
This time the silence that fell was preceded by a startled gasp which spread throughout the crowd like wildfire as eyes flickered back and forth between Draco and Fleur, each of them cataloguing the similarities between the two of them even as she reared back in shock.
Also, because there is no reference for what he looks like due to him being cut out of the movies I have imagined Charlie Weasley looking like Richard Madden only with red hair.
before he found himself with an armful of his best friends, all three of them trying to squeeze the life out of him at once as they congratulated him in their native languages.
Dieter had been just a fraction taller than Draco and had had a habit of crowding him in when they were together, be it in a bed or in a shower stall, so it wasn’t surprising that he quickly found himself wedged into the corner of the stall, the tiles surprisingly cool on his skin. As his hands moved, one working to bring himself to completion whilst the other stroked across the curve of his thigh, the plane of his stomach, his pectorals, all the places that Dieter had liked to touch and fondle when they’d been together, his mind effortlessly pictured his ex-boyfriend standing before him, his trademark smile on his handsome face.
students feasted on everything from an array of delicate pastries with glasses of freshly squeezed juice to churros with thick hot chocolate or even cold cuts of meat, cheeses and freshly baked bread. It was vastly different to the milk and cereals, toast or “full English breakfasts” that the Hogwarts students were devouring.
They thought he’d been sent down with a message, he realised suddenly but what could he say? How could he explain to the three rightful Champions what had happened just now?
As her voice trailed off the flames inside the Goblet of Fire suddenly turned a vivid red colour, spitting and writhing as though it had suddenly been turned into the gates of hell.
Of the twenty-seven students who had put their names up for consideration only sixteen had been selected by Madame Maxime to represent
and they will be joining myself, Professor Karkaroff and Madame Maxime on the panel which will judge the champions’ efforts.”
Following lunch Harry trudged up to the top of the astronomy tower to join the rest of the class about to suffer through three painfully long hours of
fitted but definitely weren't excessively loose around his long legs and a pair of black Italian leather shoes. As far as colours went each article of clothing he wore on a daily basis was a different shade of blue; light blue, sky blue, powder blue, pastel blue with the darkest part of the entire outfit being his tie and the piping around the various edges of his blazer which were both a royal blue.
“I thought we agreed that we wouldn’t think of him in that way anymore,” Draco grumbled at the offending part of his body which only caused it to pulse wildly. “Ugh. Fine. Last time.
This was his standard cue to begin his ablutions; firstly he used a tiny amount of body wash to scrub his face clean with his hands, next he shampooed his blonde locks twice and put in a decent amount of conditioner which he left to do its job as he took the sea sponge to his body, creating a remarkable amount of bubbles with the body wash as he scrubbed every inch of his skin with particular attention being paid to his underarms and the soles of his feet. Only once all of the scented body wash had been rinsed off did he set about washing the conditioner out of his hair, combing through the luxuriously soft locks with his fingers.
blue for some of them, were the house pins each of them had been given upon being assigned to their house during their first welcoming banquet which were worn beside the school crest. Draco, as a member of
In fact only the three students who Harry had come to assume were Draco’s friends seemed to be celebrating at all, applauding wildly as beaming smiles all but split their cheeks open.
“I didn’t put my name in,” Harry found himself mumbling, glancing back and forth between Ron and Hermione as he begged them to believe him. He felt numb. His fellow Gryffindor’s looked so betrayed, particularly Ron. “You know I didn’t. I couldn’t have…I
turned red, wild sparks showering out of it for a long moment before the tongue of flame they had all been waiting for shot his into the air in order to deposit the last slip of parchment in Dumbledore’s hand.
Draco's parents had never tried to hide their “past affiliations and indiscretions” from him, always willing to answer his questions openly and honestly from a young age although it had only been in the last few years that they had been willing to share absolutely everything with him. He understood shy they'd held a few things back; no young child should have to know that their parents had been forced to torture others or risk being tortured themselves, shouldn't have to learn of the “plan” which had been laid down for their life which had included joining the Dark Lords followers as a loyal puppet, shouldn't have to learn how twisted and evil their grandparents, their aunts and uncles, even their cousins truly were.
For the next two and a half hours the students were forced to complete a complicated circular chart upon which they were expected to record the positions of the planets at the moment of their birth. It was proving to be quite a challenge, one that only a few of them were enjoying and Harry was most definitely not one of them as he found himself faced with the problem of having two Neptune’s upon his chart and nowhere left to put Pluto.
Harry was pretty sure he wasn't the only student who had stopped paying attention as soon as Mr Filch’s name was mentioned. Given that the caretaker had had it out for him and his friends ever since their first day of school when he and Ron had gotten lost and ended up in an area which had been deemed “out of bounds” (a polite way for saying that there was a three-headed dog protecting the secret entrance to a series of tests which had been designed to protect one of the most powerful and rare magical gemstones on the planet) it was hardly surprising that with his continued efforts to make their lives a misery they had all settled into a mutual hate/hate relationship. Thus was it really any wonder that he had several much better things to do than listen to notices from the sadistic Argus Filch.
He paused once more, struck by the urge to say something about the anxiety he was feeling regarding the
The familiar sharp voice of Professor McGonagall rang out over the noise of the entrance hall, silencing the titters and the giggles as she advanced on the spectacle taking place.
Given that he’d been expecting to spend his lunch alone, everyone but Hermione keeping their distance out of distrust, respect or fear, he nearly jumped out of his seat when a pair of bodies sat down on either side of him so close their thighs ended up pressed together.
Ron’s cry of dismay was completely drowned out by the uproar of approval which came from the Hufflepuff table as every single member of the friendliest house jumped to their feet, screaming and stamping, as Cedric made his way past them, grinning broadly, and followed the previous Champions down to the side chamber behind the teachers table.
Reaching out he encouraged Claude to snuggle into his side, wrapping his arm around the Frenchman so as to effectively pin him in place. Claude sighed happily, rubbing his cheek against the soft fabric of his boyfriend’s pyjama top whilst tucking his leg between Javier’s.

Silence fell upon the crowd as, with a wave of his wand, the unsteady Professor sent the ferret flying up into the air, high above their heads before allowing it to fall freely towards the ground, only catching it at the last possible moment. Next the ferret was sent flying from side to side in the space available, over and over until the Professor tired of this.
“Although it is somewhat ironic,” Claude chuckled, slipping his arm through Draco’s other arm, his boyfriend linking arms with him on his other side. “Out of all of us the
“But I am sure you will all enjoy it immensely,” Dumbledore continued, his tone reassuring as the students slowly calmed down from the state of uproar. Some students still looked almost murderous and Harry wasn't at all surprised to realise that most of them were the seventh year players for whom this would have been their last year playing Quidditch at the school. He felt for them. “I have great pleasure. Announcing that this year at Hogwarts – ”
Madame Maxime was perched on one of the chairs looking surprisingly elegant considering the fact that she was a half-giantess and therefore towered over everyone. Beside her Lara, the Head Girl, looked positively elfin as she sat on her own chair, her petite frame and delicate features making her looked significantly younger than her seventeen years.
“Antidotes!” he announced grandly, tapping his wand against the blackboard. The chalk rose in response, moving rapidly across the board as it covered it with the information from their previous lesson that would be relevant for them today. “You should all have prepared your recipes now,” he went on, his eyes scanning the room as students retrieved their recipes from their bags, some written out on scrolls of thick parchment whilst others, like Harry’s, scribbled on a page of muggle notepaper. He hadn’t had time to copy it out properly. “I want you to brew them carefully and then we will be selecting someone to test one…”
“I quite agree, Madame Maxime,” Karkaroff crowed triumphantly. “I shall be lodging complaints with the
mother, DeLacour?” Harry enquired, tightening his grip on his best friends elbow in order to stop the volatile redhead launching himself towards the Slytherin’s. Now, how to suitably retaliate… “That expressions she’s always got on his face, like she’s got dung under his nose? Has she always looked like that, or is it just because you were with her?”
“Narcissa, darling, what a pleasant surprise,” her mother murmured, placing her cocktail glass down on the coffee table before rising to her feet as swiftly as he restrictive corset would allow. She, like all the fashionable women of her generation, was still content to dress as though it was still the 1800’s. “What brings you home so unexpectedly?”
, a globule of spittle actually bursting from the Professors lips and landing on Bagman’s lapel. Harry wasn’t the only one to openly grimace. “After all our many meetings and negotiations and compromises, I little expected something of this nature to occur! I have half a mind to leave now! At
“Just thought you should know that your father made it into today’s paper,” their arch-nemesis announced, pretending to offer Ron the copy of the
Getting to his feet was difficult, his body feeling equally as numb as his brain, and his foot caught the hem of his robes which caused him to stumble as he set off along the gap between the Gryffindor and Hufflepuff tables. His fellow students gazed up at him, slack jawed, as he passed them by although as more time passed by some of them recovered their senses enough to adopt looks of pure envy and in some cases disgust and annoyance.
Draco smirked to himself, holding back his chuckles so as to keep the attention away from him for the moment. Perhaps it wouldn't be so bad spending a year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with his evil little cousins, so long as he had his friends with him.
He could remember waking up presumably on the night it had happened to find his parents sat on the floor beside his bed. They’d been facing away from him so he couldn’t see their faces, his mother’s head resting on his father’s shoulder as they talked softly of
in the subject which, although an honourable career, had never rally appealed to him. He might have a
Draco fled the library mere seconds before the irate librarian de ended on his friends to give them a lecture on proper library etiquette. He could feel the boys gaze upon him right until the moment he slipped out into the corridor which made him smile to himself and shake his head as he began traversing the corridors which would take him to the nearest exit to their carriage; the boy was obviously inexperienced in dealing with whatever feelings he had as his attentions were more than obvious. In fact Draco would go so far as to say they were positively blatant. Whereas Draco had purposefully allowed the other boy to catch him staring he knew that him noticing the Hogwarts student hadn’t been part of the plan.
No one but Professor Dumbledore who, after a long pause during which he did nothing but stare at the parchment in his hands, looked up at the students, cleared his throat and read,
“This is a measure we feel is necessary, given that the Tournament tasks will still be difficult and dangerous, whatever precautions we take, and it is highly unlikely that students below sixth and seventh year will be able to cope with them. I will personally be ensuring that no underage student hoodwinks our impartial judge into making them Hogwarts Champion,” Dumbledore continued, fixing his gaze pointedly on the Weasley twins who had already begun discussing different ways they could still get their names entered. “I therefore beg you not to waste your time submitting yourself if you are under the age of seventeen.”
and everything he’d been through. Draco could remember being confused to find his parents in his room and why they sounded so sad, wondering in his innocence who it was they were talking about, and he could remember asking them what was wrong. The conversation that followed was a complete blank in his memory, however, as were those of the day that followed when the world had celebrated the disappearance of the Dark Lord.
“How come Draco gets fairy lights and I don't?” Claude pouted from where he was stretched out on the ridiculously soft rug in front of the roaring fireplace. He'd stripped down to just his undershirt and uniform trousers, kicking off his shoes, and was meant to be working on his History of Magic essay but had been doodling for nearly an hour already so obviously it wasn't going well. “Ramona? Am I not your favourite anymore? Am I so easily replaced?”
Of course there was always the option of following in his father’s footsteps who, having turned his back on his family and their considerable fortune, had entered into business with Marcel Devereux,  the ageing apothecary who's shop was one of the fixtures of
One by one the students, most of them taking the advantage of the sofas although no one stretched out on the chaise lounge, arrived until finally they were all assembled bar two; Claude and Javier. Ramona, who had moved to stand beside Draco near the exterior door, was dispatched to find them just as the carriage gave a little lurch as they finally landed.
“Why not?” he finally responded to the redhead, folding his arms across his chest as he met the wide eyes. “It's just a name. A word. What's the point in being frightened of a
Whatever he had been about to say was interrupted by the enchanted sky above their heads going completely an utterly mental, thunder crashing, lightning flashing and real rain pouring down on top of the students who reacted loudly in fearful surprise, covering their heads even as a magical spell was shot up into the ceiling from the corner of the large room.
“Ron’s got all those brothers to compete against at home,” she’d gone on, adding to her explanation as he’d munched on the slices of toast she had brought him from breakfast after he’d failed to appear before the tables were being cleared. “And you’re his best friend, Harry, and you’re really famous. He’s always shunted to one side when people see you and he puts up with it and he never mentions it but I suppose this is just one time too many…”
I had actually planned to carry this chapter on a little bit further than this but it ended up working better when I ended it here. Comments & Suggestions welcome. X
It would’ve been bearable if Ron and Hermione had been at his side but they were nowhere to be seen. Did than mean they believed him? That they disapproved of the celebration? Or did it mean that they were so disgusted with his supposed actions that they could face him?
It appeared that word of their decision to enter their names that evening had reached almost every student currently residing within the castle walls as from the moment they stepped out of the carriage to the time that the doors of the
A bell chimed signalling the end of breakfast and as one the student body rose from their seats, most of them abandoning whatever food they hadn’t managed to eat in favour of making it to their first class on time. Some, such as Ron, gathered up whatever they still wanted to eat and took it with them, stuffing the buttered toast into his mouth as they hurried down to the dungeons for their first class of the day; Potions with Professor Snape.
Making her way along the muggle street she stopped in front of the house she had grown up in and been thankful to leave following her marriage, waiting for it to fully appear once the concealment charm had recognised her as a member of the Black family. Reaching down to lift up the front of the long black skirt she wore underneath her stylish emerald green coat the elegant young woman ascended the steps at the front of the building and, after tapping the tip of her wand on the door to unlock it, slipped inside the long entrance hall.
Moments later she was thrown out of the front door with enough force to send her tumbling painfully down the steps, landing with a pained cry on the pavement below them. Only the magical charms on the front of the house stopped the muggles going about their daily business from noticing the young woman clutching at her bleeding cheek and bruised ribs, staring up at her parents who didn’t say another word to her before shutting the door.
Unlike before, when the doors had opened smoothly and gentle, this time they were flung open with an alarming amount of force so as to admit the representatives of
“Miss Narcissa,” the creature murmured whilst performing a deep bow. The dirty pillow case it wore slipped to reveal the creatures grotesquely scarred back. It had always amused her sisters, Bellatrix and Apolline, to torment the poor creatures whenever they could or to order them to punish themselves for no real reason. “May Narbey be of assistance?”
All four of their group were eligible and more than capable of competing. Javier and Claude had already put their names down on the list, full of eagerness, and Ramona was planning to do so come the following morning. It was only Draco who had any serious reservations and although most of his peers assumed it was because of the well-known dangers involved in the contest (which had put off some students) it was actually because of the location;
“Come on, Draco. You know you're an attractive man. It can't be a surprise that I might like you.” Harry couldn't believe he'd said it. He must be drunk, to be admitting such things.
As he exited the shower, Harry heard somebody walking around downstairs. Automatically thinking it was Draco—as he always did whenever he heard a noise—Harry quickly threw on some clothes and ran down the stairs.
With a sudden pang of horror, Draco fashioned a bib of sorts from some napkins to save his new shirt. He looked like an idiot anyway, there was no need to ruin a perfectly good shirt in the process.
Draco turned up two hours later, still wearing his Healer's robes, thrusting a bottle of wine into Harry's hands whilst apologising profusely.
“Right!” Harry shouted, slamming the door behind him. “Don't you fuckers have your own homes to shower in? Get out, you useless bastards.”
Neville and Ginny didn't even see each other for an hour a day; Neville was teaching at Hogwarts, and Ginny was constantly up and down the country with her Quidditch team. But every few months, Ginny would take some time off when the school was having a break, and they would go on holiday somewhere, just the two of them.
When they'd reached the dining room, Draco was overjoyed to see the other guests eating their own breakfasts. If anything could have made the morning worse, feeding Harry his cornflakes would have done it.
On and on it went, with Draco getting more frustrated every time Harry knew about something he'd written. He really didn't want to say it, but when Harry told him exactly that he knew what ballet he'd watched the month before, he couldn't hold it in.
“What? Go along with it? Same, I suppose. I got to have you and not lose you as my friend. Why did you let it go on for so long?”
Malfoy was going on about future selves and whatnot, Harry had second thoughts. It was as if he was taking advantage of a person under the influence. It wasn't right.
To an outsider—even to Harry—they had had a perfectly easy-going day. They'd watched a great game of Quidditch. The Cannons had even scored a few goals, which made Ron happy even though they'd eventually lost by 350 points. He and Harry had then joined Hermione for a lovely dinner in a great little restaurant that Harry had told them about. After all that, Harry had joined them back at the Burrow to enjoy a lovely bottle of wine that Draco had sent as an apology for not being there.
else to go along with it. Last year, it had been to announce the first annual Harry Potter day. Ron still thanked Harry—to Ron's amusement and Harry's embarrassment—for his extra day off work. The year before, it had been to award Harry his Order of Merlin. He hadn't minded that year so much, as Ron and Hermione had been on the podium with him, receiving theirs. The year before that had been just after Voldemort's death, and no one had really felt like celebrating. The Ministry had, rather stupidly, thought that throwing a Celebration Ball while most of the wizarding world was still grieving their loved ones was a good idea.
“Kingsley gave him free reign. Harry told him flat out that he'd quit otherwise, and he knew the Ministry wouldn't like that.”
enough, he thought. He was going to get Ginny back and for that, he needed to up his kissing game. Practice makes perfect and all that.
Dog retreated back to the sofa while Harry rummaged in the boxes and then sat on the floor untangling the lights. Harry never minded him being on the sofa and he might as well get comfy. It usually took Draco ages to untangle the—in Draco's own words—Muggle piece of crap.
“What things? No, I don't want to know because this isn't fucking real. I'm going to wake up in the morning and this is all going to have been a dream. Maybe I
Right on cue, as the last light was turned off in the bar, the policemen turned to one another, nodded, and jumped into their car. Harry rolled his eyes at them before sighing in relief. He had a quick look to ensure that they were alone, took out his wand and cast a Warming Charm over the two of them.
The day of Harry's birthday dawned bright and sunny. Harry wearily stepped out of bed and crept downstairs, ready to scold anyone jumping out at him. To his shock and delight, there was simply a small pile of cards on his kitchen table and a steaming cup of tea from Kreacher.
The one thing that had been at the back of his mind since the meeting with Kingsley reappeared as soon as he was comfortable.
Hedwig couldn't talk; she could only nod meekly as she watched her owner snogging the face off Draco Malfoy.
Draco couldn't help but grin as waiters brought out bottles of wine along with the platters of food. If he was going to have to talk to people other than Harry, he was glad he wouldn't have to do it sober.
Harry led the way to their usual table, pleased to note as he passed that the windows had already been replaced. He waited until Grumpy Waiter came to serve them before starting to talk. The sight of Grumpy Waiter's black eye caused Harry some measure of surprise.
to feed himself. Shaking his head to dismiss that, quite frankly, scary, thought, Draco simply said hello to his neighbours and looked at Glinda when she clinked her glass.
“Did you?” Hedwig felt resigned. She couldn't even bring herself to feel indignant at her friends' desertion.
“Glasses? What the bloody fuck are you going on about? Last time I saw you—with my perfect eyesight, thank you very much—you were going home to change your ketchup stained clothes before we went to the bloody pub. Have I missed something?”
Even Darius couldn't keep a straight face at Hedwig's words. She didn't actually believe it herself.
Draco knew exactly where his partner was at all times when on a case, and instinctively knew exactly how to work with him. They fired spells in perfect harmony and they moved around each other as if in a choreographed dance.
The potion worked instantly and Harry, not for the first time in his life, thanked Merlin that he was a wizard. He had a holiday to be enjoying, and spending the day in bed recovering from an abundance of alcohol and good food was not on the top of his to-do list.
“A reputable source, that I can confirm to be close to the Saviour, has come forward with pictures of Mr Potter's new beau.”
With the SAS not finding anything tangible they could use to find the writer of the letters, Harry wouldn't leave my side. The SAS were working on a new spell that could detect minute traces of magical signature, but it was still not perfected and I was getting pretty desperate. I wanted them to find the anonymous bastard so Harry would leave me alone for five bloody minutes.
He knew that it was the same for Potter. On more occasions than Draco could count, Potter had slid in to save him from a stray spell or projectile.
“Truthfully, I was scared. I hadn't seen you for months after the war, and then there you were: bright eyed and eager on the first day of training. You looked fantastic, but you were still you. I was supposed to hate you.”
Harry did as he was told, and sat up straighter, crossing his legs so Draco could perch opposite him.
had been on the right track after all. Even though Draco had agreed immediately to move in, Harry hadn't seen Draco alone for much more than an hour a day. They always managed to have a quick cuddle in bed in the morning before they both ran out to work, and they made sure they had dinner together most nights, but most of the time Draco was out at work until late.
Harry was brought out of his belt-induced daze by the sound of Draco laughing. “What is it about this thing?”
“Okay, you two,” Glinda said, rolling her eyes, “enjoy the rest of your day. Go on, get out of my office.”
Draco shifted in his seat. He wanted to talk to Harry, but he thought that should probably be a conversation they should have in private. “No,” he said.
Draco cut him off. “No. You did. And we were extremely grateful. We might not have shown it, but we were. Those bastards were looking to throw us away without even hearing what we had to say.”
The drinks had been flowing all night, and Harry was feeling more than a little tipsy. Jokes were flying around the table non-stop, and Harry couldn't think of a better send-off for his boyfriend and best friend. The main subject for the group was what Ron and Harry would be getting up to while their other halves were off gallivanting around Europe.
with Ron in the evening. Harry didn't mind; he had already planned to make himself scarce for the lovebirds to have some privacy.
The other students were another matter. Some—mainly the younger students who didn't really know what was going on—didn't seem to care. Then there were those—mainly sixth and seventh years who couldn't or wouldn't forget—who were quite vocal in their distaste. But with Professor McGonagall's previous warning still in place, we didn't hear
Malfoy jumped up from the lounger and wrapped his towel around himself; Harry had already done the same. They both spoke over one another, and quite loudly at that.
Draco Malfoy. I can prove it;  please, put the wand down. I shouldn't have just come out with it like that. I'm sorry.”
Once they were seated, Draco wasn't sure of the etiquette. Nearly everyone was in the room—only Ten and One were missing—and he didn't want his food to get cold, but no one else was eating.
“Are you gay?” Harry had blurted out, causing Draco to spray wine everywhere. He really needed to start checking if people had mouthfuls before he spouted off.
Harry let out an audible sigh of relief as the sound of police sirens filled the air, but didn't move back to the manager and the remaining guests. As the sirens got louder—and nearer—the attackers, after aiming a few last kicks at the whimpering man on the floor, ran off into the night.
Draco? Harry couldn't find an answer without hearing from the man himself. There was only one way to find out. He was ready. He needed to talk to Draco.
The paper stopped, as Harry asked them to, printing complete lies and rumours. It instead printed the small picture of us together that Granger insisted would sweeten the request and an apology to me in particular.
“This afternoon,” Glinda said, drawing everyone's attention, “we're going to have a bit of fun. I need you to split into two teams, if you will.”
“After you have done that, please sign the guestbook, which will also ensure you get what you need from this weekend. That's it, that's it. Thank you.”
Draco’s eyes lit up before he hastily complied. Harry grinned. He was going to enjoy every single second of this. Harry drizzled the flavoured oil down the centre of Draco’s back, causing Draco to gasp and wriggle slightly. Harry stilled him by placing his hands on Draco’s hips and licking a stripe straight through the puddle that had settled on Draco’s arched back.
“I was in work, getting a cuppa from the canteen, when some little pimply kid came bounding up to me; Merlin, you'd think he'd won the Prize Draw, the way his face was lit up. He said he had some bad news for me, and handed me this.”
Glinda held her hand up and coughed, getting their attention. “Are we all comfortable? I just have some small things to go through, and then we can get you settled into your rooms, and get on with holding hands!”
It had been the most ordinary of days when it happened. Harry had got up at half past six, had some tea and cornflakes, had a quick bath and thrown some clothes on. Work had been the same as ever. The hospital chit chat was banal as usual and the paperwork was abundant and tedious. He'd met Ron for lunch like he'd done almost daily since he'd started work at St. Mungo's. He'd had fish and chips, the same as every Friday. Back in the ward, Malfoy had good naturedly ribbed him about his  ketchup stain on his tie.
“Why are you embarrassed?” Draco asked once he had fixed Harry's nose. “I don't recall you being embarrassed when you snuggled back into bed this morning.”
“I've always known. It was a real problem for my parents, Father in particular. He wanted me to marry some pure-blooded witch that he would pick for me, have an heir and keep my
Hermione sighed. “Are you still on about Ginny? And to answer your question, while Ron's technique has improved recently, do you remember what he was like with Lavender? I do. Vividly. You could hear the squelches from the other side of the room.”
As Smith was led away by his housemate, holding his red cheek, Harry stood up. If I hadn't been so angry I could've screamed, I might've laughed at Smith trying to hide behind little Irene Howard. Harry ignored him completely and walked over to me, holding his hand out.
“Never mind those two; have you seen the time?” Hermione said, pointing at the huge clock. “You're on now.”
“Two minutes, Brewster,” Harry told the cat, crouching to give his fur a ruffle. “Let me get changed and I'll get you some food.”
Harry cut him off with a kiss. “I know you have one, Draco. I saw it at your trial. It doesn't bother me. It's just a scar, like mine.”
“Yes,” he finally said. “That makes sense. I never realised before; I just thought he hated me. I just get so tired of being treated like shit.”
He didn't fancy Harry, he told himself. It was just a natural reaction to being touched so intimately. An involuntary response, that's what it was.
I was not ready for the crowds to part for an extremely calm looking Potter to pass. I wasn't ready for Potter to hold his hand out to shake mine with a smile on his face. And I definitely wasn't ready for him to shake my hand, pat me on the shoulder and say, 'Good game, Draco,' before leaving towards the showers.
“Why would I be mad? You know I'd gladly tell the world what great sex we have. Did you forget about my exhibitionist kink?” Draco laughed and gestured at the book. “Well, obviously not judging by that chapter in the changing room. That was hot… I am torn, though.”
If it wasn't for Potter, there wouldn't be any problems. Well, apart from that whole Voldemort business; Draco would give him that one.
Ron slammed the door to the Burrow as soon as Harry Disapparated, nearly missing Harry's small wave of goodbye. Hermione was by his side instantly, smoothing the back of his neck to calm him down.
“Darius, you take Arnold to Draco. Just keep an eye on him and listen for anything that may be useful. Both of you. See if you can find out what the bloody hell has happened with them this week.”
As Harry wrote, Glinda called everyone to the front, and Harry dropped the parchment and collected Draco's notes. Draco scooped up Harry's parchments from the table, noticing the one he'd just been writing.
“Well, yes. He's Tony Stark, for Merlin's sake. Billionaire genius. Saves the world on a regular basis. Of course he's the best.”
Harry turned towards the door on hearing his boyfriend's voice. “Hi, love,” he said automatically, blushing slightly when he realised he'd used the endearment in front of someone else.
Harry was so focused on Draco's upper body, that he had nearly missed the part he had been most looking forward to. Draco had obviously taken off his shoes and socks—that must have been when the arms had been flexing, he thought with a happy sigh—as he was now unbuckling his belt.
“I would like you to talk about whatever you want: Quidditch, the weather, what you want for dinner. Anything you want. But as you do—and no one will be eavesdropping; don't worry—I will call out a body part and you need to touch that part on your partner as you talk. Like this. Face.”
Harry slumped onto the sofa and accepted the large Firewhisky pushed into his hand by Ron. He didn't know what else he could do.
Harry gaped before standing up from his seat and grabbing his cloak. Taking Draco's offered hand, Harry all but pulled him out of the pub; the cold air hit him immediately, sobering him up slightly. Pausing to put on his cloak, Harry turned to ask Draco where he wanted to go next, but instead his breath hitched at the sight of Draco lounging against the wall, biting on his bottom lip.
The elderly couple were, well, elderly. The pair of girls were giggly and too concentrated on their gossip to be any real threat. The middle-aged couple looked as if they'd played a few sets in their time; they were the ones to watch. There were also a couple of teenagers and other couples mingling about; Harry didn't even know if they were playing or not.
Hermione turned around in her seat to look at where Ron was pointing. Sure enough, there was Ginny sitting on Dean's lap, kissing for all to see with barely a squelch to be heard.
Draco looked around his bedroom and frowned at the clothes strewn across every surface. He couldn't decide on what to take. Under normal circumstances, Draco would simply take everything with him for a trip away, no matter how short. Who knew when one would need a certain shirt or pair of shoes. It was far easier to just shrink his entire wardrobe and take it along.
Hermione began to recite the words on the page, taking her reading as seriously as she did the readings she was called upon to perform in several of their classes.
By the time they alighted from the train, calling out a cheerful greeting to Hagrid as they did so, the weather had taken a turn for the worse and it was a bit of a mad scramble to get to the carriages before they were all soaked to the skin. None of them envied the poor first years who were being herded towards the lake which currently looked like something out of a horror movie to Harry, the water churning unpleasantly, by the schools resident half-giant.
, is practically a saint in comparison even though she has more clothes than the rest of use combined. At least she asked before she started filling up the wardrobes and drawers with her things. Skye didn't even bother.”
“Yes, Harry, were ok with you being gay,” Hermione announced. Ron nodded his head in agreement, his face returning to its normal colour. “I'm not ok with us being late, however.”
“The moment has come,” Dumbledore announced once the song had finally reached its conclusion and the students dropped down into their seats. “The

in Potions but his favourite subjects were Transfiguration and Charms so if possible he'd like to find a future career which would utilise his skills in those areas.
In the end the meal which had been so long in coming passed by far too quickly with only one incident happening to disrupt them in their endeavour to fill their stomachs, that being when Nearly Headless Nick had brought up the fact that Hogwarts was home to the largest number of House Elves dwelling in Britain. Hermione had been utterly horrified, refusing to touch another bit of the delicious meal in a show of disgust for the careless treatment of the House Elves rights. She wouldn't listen to Ron or their house ghost when both of them tried to reassure her that most House Elves were more than happy with the way they lived, that the House Elves at Hogwarts were some of the best rested in Britain if not the world.
Dumbledore’s unusually serious voice drew his attention away from the empty doorway through which the
“There’s no one else it could be,” he reasoned with himself as he instinctively navigated the moving staircases so as to ensure he’d end up at his desired location. “It must’ve been him.”
“But he can’t compete,” Draco pointed out, shaking his head as Krum frowned deeply. Cedric was frowning now as well. “He’s what, a Fourth Year? He’s far too young for this.”
He hated Halloween at the best of times, the celebration holding an unfortunately special place in his heart now that he knew when and how his parents had died, but with the eerie feeling created by the candles having burnt low and the stressful event of the evening he couldn’t help but shudder, picking up the pace and overtaking Cedric so he could get out.
She hadn’t imagined it would hurt so much to see her mother draw her deformed looking wand, a reflection of her own deformed personality perhaps, and blast her image from the tapestry. Her sister’s face had been removed similarly shortly after she’d been thrown out.
It took him a moment to get over his genuine shock but when he didn't he could help but scoff loudly, drawing the attention of everyone in their vicinity as he enquired coldly,
“The delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang will be arriving in October and will be remaining with us for the greater part of this year,” Dumbledore continued calmly as though he hadn't just dashed so many students dreams of glory and riches. Some were visibly upset although most still looked angry. “I know that you will extend every courtesy to our foreign guests while they are with us and will give you’re whole-hearted supported to the Hogwarts champion when he or she is selected. And now, it is late, and I know how important it is for you all to be alert and rest as you enter your lessons tomorrow. Bedtime! Chop chop!”
right. Could Sirius be in trouble? Could he have been captured? That was, after all, what Harry had been fearing the most recently…although he supposed she could also have been referring to his growing fears about his less than straight sexuality…
“Thanks for having us to stay, Mrs Weasley,” Hermione murmured politely as they climbed on board, closing the door and leaning out of the open window in order the squeeze in their final goodbyes. Only four of them could fit, however, so the twins were pushed back and were forced to jump and down in order to see their mother over the group at the door.
“I thought he had been sent to live with his relatives,” Lucius pointed out as he helped his wife to her feet, pressing a kiss to the corner of her mouth. He then carefully shrunk his armchair, the last piece of furniture in the large room. “Muggles, or so I had heard.”
“Think of the possibilities,” Ron chuckled, slumping down and stretching his legs out to rest on the seat opposite, much to Hermione’s disapproval, as his hands absentmindedly brought the other half of his sandwich to his mouth. “It would've been so easy to push DeLacour off a glacier and make it look like an accident…shame her mother likes her…”
