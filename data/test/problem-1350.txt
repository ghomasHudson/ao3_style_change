Draco flinched at those words, and he looked down at the table. The Slytherins on his side of the room grumbled at him, but it was too quiet for Harry to hear.
“The mirror is dangerous. Many people have died in front of it.” Professor Dumbledore said wisely. Harry wondered what Professor Dumbledore saw, since the aged wizard hadn’t looked away from the mirror yet. He too seemed tranced by it.
"Oh thank you. Both of you." Hermione murmured. She wrapped her arms around Neville and Harry then, and squeezed almost tight enough they couldn't breathe. Neither were going to stop her though, because they wanted it.
Harry only noticed when there was slobber on his shoulder. He didn't need to look up to know it was the dog. He'd seen the dog drool last time.
"I'm not your friend just because you're smart and help with homework; you're interesting to listen to and you're great for conversation. Not to mention you are there whenever we need you. I
They waited a few more moments, and then the hat tipped back where a huge rip appeared. Harry gasped quietly as he thought the hat would be torn apart, but no, it started to sing. It said what Professor McGonagall had said, except it put more depth to each of the houses. The Gryffindor House was brave and daring, the Hufflepuff House was loyal and patient, the Ravenclaw House was quick witted and well learnt, and the Slytherin House was real friended and cunning.
"N-no... You seemed eager back there." Neville said quietly. He flushed to his forehead not soon after.
As soon as Professor Snape's attention was on his robes, Draco got control of his broom once more. He corrected his position on the wooden stick, and set off to the sky once more. He might have wanted to jump off right then in that moment, but he couldn't until someone found the snitch.
"C-can I have that back?" Neville asked hesitantly. Draco smiled cheekily, and tossed the glass ball back and forth between his fingers. The smoke in the ball began turning red as Draco stopped smiling and he stopped tossing the ball. Draco sighed with the rest of them.
Draco walked briskly through the few feet that parted them and wrapped his arms around Harry awkwardly. The meaning was still there though in the way Draco seemed to cling to him.
Hermione didn't look any closer to believing him, but he didn't care. Or at least, he didn't care until halfway through dinner when Professor Quirrell came running in shouting about a troll in the dungeon and promptly fainting. Then he cared, and he tucked his tie into his shirt and tossed his robes with his emblem aside so he could sneak into the crowd of Gryffindor's to get to the very one that had asked him where Draco was early that day.
Professor Snape's black eyes landed on him, "Potter!" he barked. He made his way along the side of the room to the back, with his steady gaze, "What would I get if I added a powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
"At least it's better than sitting between classes." Draco answered. The three to one stared at each other for a moment.
"... and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything about being a wizard or about my parents or Voldemort-" Harry continued. He stopped when Ron gasped.
Harry hadn't ever seen such a place in his dreams or in movies. The entire hall was filled with floating candles that had no melt marks; they floated over the four long tables just feet above where the students sat. The tables were filled with gold plates and goblets with nothing on them, which was a strange sight indeed to the young boy. At the front of the hall, farthest from the doors, was a long table with a line of people sitting behind it. All of them gazed at the incoming students, some with delight, and others with intrigue. Professor McGonagall shepherded the grouplet into a line that extended to the front of the hall, and turned to face the body of students rather than the professors. Hundreds of faces stared back at them, and the light of the floating candles reflected off of those faces in a way that made them appear to be faint lanterns. The opaque and luminous shimmer of ghosts could be seen widely dispersed throughout the students. The eyes that bored into them unnerved Harry, so he looked up at the ceiling. He had expected to see nothing, as he couldn't in the entrance hall, but instead he found himself looking into a deep silkin sky stippled with little twinkling lights.
Harry got up from the floor and turned to the door just as Professor Dumbledore walked in. Harry tried to cover himself up as quickly as possible, but Professor Dumbledore had seen him. The Headmaster stared at where Harry was, and Harry thought he was in trouble. Surely he was. He was out after curfew with an invisibility cloak in front of an unknown mirror.
The pointy faced boy continued to swagger his way to the table of Silver and Green, where he sat with his friends, Crabbe and Goyle. Harry continued to stare at the boy until his name was called, baffled by what he had felt.
As the evening waned and the student body had their fill, the food disappeared from the table and was replaced by desserts. Ice cream in every flavor you could think of, pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, strawberries, Jello, and rice pudding, to name a few.
Draco walked briskly through the few feet that parted them and wrapped his arms around Harry awkwardly. The meaning was still there though in the way Draco seemed to cling to him.
"If Professor Snape was whispering anything, it would have been a counter spell, because there are many curses that could knock someone off their broom." Draco said airily.
"Goodbye Harry." Draco said, still with that same laced smile. Harry waved at the Slytherin as he left cooly with his two friends.
For those who read and for those who commented. Thank you, sincerely. These two chapters are for you.
Ron had taken out a lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one of them apart and said, "She always forgets I don't like corned beef."
"Worry not Draco. They may not cheer loud for us, but they don't know what's different this year." He encouraged. Draco tilted his head dully.
,” Harry remembered the note said. Suddenly that was all Harry wanted to do. He got back to his feet with the cloak around his shoulders and made his way out.
The next morning Draco did sit with them at the table. Space was made easily for the blond Slytherin, and none of the other Gryffindors questioned it verbally. At least, not for the first day or so. After about a week of congruent sitting with them it did raise questions, but none of the Gryffindors in first year would explain it. He was a friend to Harry, Hermione, and Neville, that should have been reason enough.
At one point they found the third corridor, which was when they got really careful. No one was supposed to be here. Around that same time Mrs. Norris found them. She stared at them with twinkling eyes for a long second, and all three begged her to stay silent. It fell on deaf ears as the cat let out a mighty "MREOW!". They didn't wait to hear Filch.
"Cut!" The director shouted. "Reset the scene. Harry, good first time. Try not to turn your body and head in two different directions though."
As they got onto the pitch and did their rounds to flaunt their house Draco got to see that his friends, Gryffindor or otherwise, waved green flags for him along with the red that was their house. He smiled and waved to them before he went down to his seat. He watched the Gryffindors on their
"I vote we never go back." Neville mumbled. Without any hesitation Hermione and Harry agreed. No treasure was worth nearly dying for.
The next gift he had was from Hermione: A book, “Cooking and Potions”, and a box of chocolate frogs with a smiley face for a note in it. Harry thought the idea of the book was sweet, and something he could probably use in his muggle home. His aunt liked to have him cook a lot, and potions shaped up to be one of his favorite classes.
"Don't do it again." Professor McGonagall ordered. Draco schooled his face and nodded, though in the back of his mind he wanted to point out that had he not helped Neville he could have hurt himself.
"You're asking me? Nothing even happened to my broom besides a little wobble in the beginning," Draco answered. Hermione nodded like that answered a riddle she'd had for a week. "Why did you set Professor Snape's robes on fire?"
“Who would give this to me?” Harry asked. Ron went diving for the packaging and looked. His upturned face slouched down at whatever he saw.
The game continued after that with Shelby in position. It was clear she wasn't used to a Chaser position, but she never complained as she soared with Adrian Pucey and Marcus Flint through the sky. A few goals were made by the Slytherin team, which put them 60-10, and with no sight of the snitch things continued.
“Depends on how much you know.” Professor Snape said very quietly. The hackles on their necks raised and there was a pause as the four thought.
"I do... It's usually one of the signs of a seer," Neville explained. He side eyed Harry. "You don't happen to have any other abilities do you?"
"Alohomora." He whispered. It clicked, and Harry pulled the door open. Hermione and Draco followed him into the room slowly, and they closed the door behind themselves.
The Headmaster looked down at him with twinkling blue eyes once more. Harry felt see-through and all-important at the same time in the face of the greatest wizard of this century.
He looked down at Harry, and his eyes did a little dance. Harry looked down and saw he was still see-through.
Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog, which jumped out free in the compartment, and he picked up the card. It showed a man's face; he wore half-moon glasses, had a long, crooked nose, and a flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath the picture was the name Albus Dumbledore.
"Longbottom, Neville!" Professor McGonagall called out. Neville passed Harry a willful smile, and walked up the stairs with a face as red as tomatoes. He sat down and the hat was placed on his head. And continued to sit with the hat on his head for many multiple minutes afterwards. It was clear Neville was aware of the time passing too, because he kept growing redder and redder as time went by.
At breakfast Thursday morning Neville got a gift from his grandmother. It was a small orb with white smoke in it, and he called it a Remembrall.
"They're turning on me for being friends with you. All except Blaise and Pansy." Draco told them as he helped Neville back into a steady standing position.
He went in through a doorway that was slightly ajar, and inside was a mirror. It was a gold mirror as high as the ceiling, with two claw feet that held it up. It had weird words along the top that left Harry confused as he crept closer.
It couldn't have been ten minutes before the first mishap happened. Brook Ivanovok, a seventh year Chaser on the Slytherin team, was scooted a foot up her broom as she reached for a quaffle. The ball began to fall, and was picked up by the Gryffindor Chaser.
"Welcome," Headmaster Albus Dumbledore said. "Welcome to a new year at Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like to say a few words, and here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak! Thank you!"
He heard noise from inside the locker, and pushed the Gryffindors off to the side while the older team members of Draco's House came out. They didn't pay mind to the first years, like they'd expected a crowd, and the group watched them go.
They reset the scene after the kids were done with their giggle fits, and Draco and Harry stopped having red marks where they hit the stairs.
Harry turned to Neville as soon as he was sure the professor wouldn't be able to hear them and asked, "How exactly do they sort us into our houses?"
“He’d see it.” The Professor answered. He shuffled up though, to feign giving more of his attention to them than he’d already given.
Professor Dumbledore bid him goodnight and closed the portrait. Harry quickly wrote three letters out and put them in a cubby hole to dry for him to send out the next morning. He laid in bed after that, and fell asleep.
"I did? I did! Thank you Draco." Neville said as he got up. He snatched the Remembrall out of Draco's hand, which stunned the blond, and the normally clumsy boy began the long trek back to his dorm before first class. Draco looked between Harry, Hermione, and Neville, and then took off to follow the Gryffindor with a 'wait, don't go alone!'.
It looked like Professor McGonagall was going to speak, but then she stopped, and watched the two interact. It was definitely a slow descent, but Professor McGonagall could see Neville's face now. It was terrified, and he stared unblinkingly as Draco slowly lowered them.
The day continued normally after that; Charms and Transfiguration with Ravenclaws, lunch, and Herbology with Hufflepuffs. Immediately after the group of all the first year Gryffindor's walked to the quidditch field where their first flying lesson was. Neville had already lost his Remembrall, and couldn't remember the last time he'd seen it after that morning, but it was now something to worry about after he'd survived flying.
Quirrell tilted his head confusedly, and Ugoki spent the time walking to the dungeons explaining the story of Lord of the Rings to the wizard.
The rest of that evening and weekend was boring. Sure they had homework, but nothing that a little reading and Hermione couldn't fix. The most exciting thing that happened that weekend was that Ron introduced Hermione and Harry to wizarding chess, or as Hermione called it, Barbarian Chess. Most of the time was spent outside or scoping out the rest of the castle, and there was a
The hat was chuckling at him right off the bat, "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes- and a nice thirst to prove yourself... Now that's interesting... You can see the future of yourself with others, that'll make your friendships very hard... So where shall I put you?"
"Ah, yes. Harry Potter," Professor Snape set his sights on the offending person. "Our new celebrity."
Fred, George, and Percy came in right then, and Harry flung the cloak into his bed to hide it. He didn’t think about it until a little later as they made their way to breakfast, where he suddenly worried the cloak would turn invisible on his bed and he’d never find it.
Along the way towards one of the larger staircases, the two boys tried to slip by a group of Slytherins. By try, it means Harry bumped shoulders rather painfully with one of them, and was brought around quite suddenly to face Draco Malfoy. The two stared at each other for a good long second, and Harry watched as emotions danced across Draco's face. Disbelief, anger, surprise, a glitter in his eye, and immediately it was all put behind a mask. Harry was impressed by that last part.
Professor Snape stalked his way back to the front of the room, and turned to the silent students dramatically.
potions homework to get to that night, so they all simultaneously agreed to leave the bathroom to see what was taking so long.
“The Tales of Beedle the Bard,” Harry said aloud as he pulled out another book. He ran his finger over the blue cover where a man with a pointy beard and hat sat staring at you with a quill in his hand.
“Who’s there?” The Fat Lady asked as her portrait swung open, but no one responded. All she heard was the patter of feet, which thoroughly freaked her. Invisible ghosts! What a new one.
The whispers surrounded him as he walked up to the podium. He turned slowly to face the crowd of curious faces, and in the next moment, things went black as the hat was placed on his head.
"Where is he?" Hermione asked Blaise as he helped her with the broom behind Madam Hooch's back. Usually Draco helped her and Neville, but he wasn't there, so Pansy and Blaise were doing what they could. They weren't the best teachers, in fact this was the first time Pansy and Neville had even talked to each other, but they were doing it for their missing friend.
"Well in that case..." Professor McGonagall said slowly, "Mister Malfoy, you were a fool. How could you think of tackling a mountain troll on your own?"
"Want to play charades?" Hermione asked them all as a way to pass time. Harry's eyes lit up, and he nodded his head vigorously.
Harry shot the occasional glance at the table of Silver and Green, and made eye contact with Draco a few times throughout dinner. Each time he did, he would smile, and received a smile back.
“We can’t ask for more than that,” Draco replied respectfully. He kicked Harry’s foot under the table when the golden boy tried to speak, and Harry snapped his mouth shut.
After so long people had forgotten about Brook Ivanovok's rogue broom, Adrian Pucey's broom began to act weird. Draco was instantly on his feet to warn someone this time, but Adrian noticed it before it could do anything more than jerk him a few feet. He swooped low to the ground with the quaffle in hand as his broom began to act up, and let it buck him off when he was a few feet from the ground. He tossed the quaffle up to Marcus, and then went rolling some ten feet. When he finally sat up again, he shook his head like he couldn't get his eyes straight, and was off kilter when he stood.
That left only one gift left. It was the lightest, and from an unknown sender. Harry opened it cautiously, and out slithered something fluid-like and silvery. It gleamed in the light, and Harry wasn’t sure what it was.
"Neville, Harry, Hermione..." Draco began, and then he saw the two Slytherin's behind them. "Pansy... Blaise where is your tie?"
"It's ok if it means we helped a friend. We can go out for flying." Harry said easily, and then grinned at the idea. He loved flying, and was going to try out for Quidditch that next year.
"Harry," Said the other, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later."
Harry walked over to the mirror to see his lack of reflection. He stepped in front of it, and nearly screamed. He clapped his hand over his own mouth to stop himself and spun around to see the two adults that stood behind him.
The train lurched forwards, and Harry looked out the window as the station moved past him. Soon after, there were houses outside.
They chit chatted their way to the first class of the day, Defense Against the Dark Arts, which was joint with Hufflepuffs. Rather than learn hexes and curses, the entire period was spent asking Professor Quirrell questions and receiving vague answers. They heard about vampires and zombies, but not about to how defend against them. Except for the garlic smell which infused the air, apparently meant to ward away vampires. Harry had thought that that was going to be a muggle myth. Professor Quirrell's turban, a gift from an African prince, though nobody believed that, also had a strange scent that Harry couldn't place; neither could his peers.
he was Harry Potter. That thought concerned him, but Harry wasn't going to question it just yet. What he felt last night was still very vivid in his mind.
A girl with blonde pigtails broke from the group and bounded up the stairs to the hat. She flounced down into the seat and the hat was sat atop her head for only a moment before it shouted out: "HUFFLEPUFFLE."
Draco winced and turned his head down. He didn't try to explain himself, and Professor McGonagall didn't let him.
"We went looking for you after." Harry backed. Hermione's face twitched between sad and happy, and Harry walked forwards to wrap his arms around both of them.
"Yeah..." She said quietly, and then pointed over her shoulder. "We should get back to looking for Trevor. Everyone that way said they hadn't seen a toad."
A few of the Slytherins sniggered behind their hands. Draco wasn't one of them, though Professor Snape didn't seem to take notice. He successfully finished taking roll without pausing on any other student.
"Well... if you want to stay with them, we understand." Harry said finally. Draco had been raising himself up for their response, and looked very prim and proper in that moment. Until what Harry said sunk in, and then very much like the first time they talked his face went through a range of emotions.
"Five," Ron corrected glumly. "I'm the sixth in our family to go to Hogwarts. You could say I've got a lot to live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left; Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a Prefect. Fred and George mess around a lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me to do as well as the others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, with five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat."
A loud crash followed, and all the students turned to the noise. Harry gasped, as did the people around him. About twenty people had just jumped through the back wall. They were milky white and semi-transparent, and they glided across the room whilst talking to one another, and hardly glanced at the first years. They seemed to be arguing, though of what was hard to discern.
The hall uproared with the response from the hat. Hufflepuff and Ravenclaw cheered, the Slytherin's clapped politely, and the Gryffindor House stood upon their feet and hollered. Harry could clearly hear the Weasley twins shouting that they got Potter.
, near this.” He answered, deathly calm now. Hermione got the memo then, the reality of their age versus what they were up against, and she sat back where Draco was already leaning. All that was left was Neville and Harry to convince, but they didn’t have anything to say. Neville slipped back, and Draco reached over to pull Harry back as well. Professor Snape watched that interaction with mild interest.
"It made you famous. What's better except a famous friend. He could go anywhere with you. Same for his family." Ron explained.
"Yeah, I did." She answered as she casually flipped her bushy hair over her shoulder. The other three watched her like she was crazy, but she didn't care.
"You had no control of the broom," Hermione finally pointed out. "Had he not helped you might have fallen. And you were really high up."
"Cut!" The director cried, and slapped his version of the script on his knee as he smothered his howls of laughter with his hand. "From the top!"
They waited with baited breath for someone to do something. Were they supposed to pull something out of it? Maybe they were supposed to use their wands on the hat? Harry wasn't prepared for anything like that.
“You got one from Draco,” Ron said with a tone Harry couldn't pinpoint. He took the package up from the ground and looked it over. It was a bit bigger than anything else either of them had gotten and had a strange symbol on it. Ron explained, “It’s the Malfoy crest.”
"What has your house been doing?" Harry asked as a sinking feeling entered his stomach. Draco looked at Harry once more, and then wiggled to help Neville from his endless sliding to the floor.
"C-can I have that back?" Neville asked hesitantly. Draco smiled cheekily, and tossed the glass ball back and forth between his fingers.
"Go on, have a pasty." Harry said again. He never never had anything to share before or, indeed, anyone to share it with.
On the front in bold characters and splotched ink was his name, and Harry could only imagine one person writing that messily that knew him.
The student whose name was called walked forward, and with that the flood of emotions in Harry disappeared. It was the platinum blond boy he had stood behind when they walked in. He swaggered up the stairs to the hat with a smug look across his face, and had barely sat down with the hat on his head before it shouted, "SLYTHERIN!"
"Heads down!" Hagrid yelled as the first boats reached the cliff; they all bent their heads and the little boats carried them through a curtain of ivy that hid a wide opening in the cliff face. They were carried along a dark tunnel, which seemed to take them right underneath the castle, until they reached a kind of underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.
Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt to his feet at the opportunity, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry had never had money to buy anything, but now that he had coins loaded in his pockets, Harry was going to buy as many Mars Bars as he could. The woman didn't have any Mars Bars though. She had Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs, Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands. Many strange things Harry had never heard anything in his life, but he wanted to try all of them. He paid the woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts, and entered the compartment carrying all his food in his shirt. Ron stared as Harry brought it all back into the compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.
"So you know what it is?" Harry asked. Neville nodded, paused, shook his head, paused, and then shrugged.
a friend yet, and only hung out because they were in the same house. Draco was entirely different; he was in a different house, and Harry had just asked.
"Not really... But he's friendly." Harry answered. He glanced at Neville, who was the only one who knew about his power still, and Neville got an "oh" look for a split second. He nodded to himself like Harry had answered an old riddle, which left Hermione and Draco confused. Harry felt guilt that they didn't know.
"Not that simple. The broom listens to Mr. Longbottom's magic, if I go near him he might shoot off into the sun. Mr. Malfoy has it under control, and I'm watching from here." Madam Hooch responded. That last part was definitely not what Professor McGonagall wanted to hear. She turned up to the sky where the two eleven year olds floated ten feet.
Except... The woman placed her hand on Harry’s shoulder. In the reflection, his shirt crinkled, but in real life, nothing happened. He reached up and placed his hand on his shoulder, over her fingers. He felt nothing. They weren’t really there, it was only an image in the mirror.
The trio made into a quartet traveled down to the dungeons for a four hour long period of potions. Draco knew the area like the back of his hand already, so they took shortcuts to get there faster. They were ten minutes early, which was alright for each of them. They didn't want to learn what happened if they were late.
He stared at the Headmaster a little differently after that. He hadn’t considered the wizard would be a big piece of his life, just a background figure. But according to what he felt, which had never been wrong before, Professor Dumbledore was much more of a piece of Harry’s future than he’d imagined.
When she stopped humming to breathe, Draco began to hum. His was just as shaky, but it picked up where Hermione stopped. Together they hummed, and Harry slowly dropped the trap door back into place. Not a moment too soon either as the dog fell over once more from falling asleep. It pushed Harry back, and he scrambled back to his friends. They fell over backwards themselves as Neville opened the door, quite possibly alerted to the crash of the dog.
Chilly silence reigned in the chilly room, which only served to make the room feel even more so. Harry took a subtle glimpse at his friends, as he did not want Professor Snape to think he wasn't paying attention. Draco looked slightly amused, Neville looked terrified, and Hermione looked offended that anyone would call her a dunderhead.
that if I ever needed you, you would be there for me." Harry explained. Hermione smiled a little less watery that time.
The raven haired boy dragged his way through the sea of bodies as he tried to find a way on to the red train before it blew its horn and left. His owl, Hedwig, fluttered her bright pristine wings in her cage, which wobbled a little on his suitcase, and swiveled her head around slightly to get her own look at the station. The trunk was too large for him to carry, but he wasn't going to ask for help. He'd already gotten a lot of it from the red-headed wizarding family just moments prior.
"I know you, you're Nearly Headless Nick!" Ron said from a few seats down the table. Sir Nicholas went from a decently pleasant smile to a stern expression at Ron's words. He turned to Ron.
Everyone was following the quaffle, so no one but Draco -probably- saw that Brook was having trouble with her broom. She kept scooting farther and farther up her broom, and he could still see the worry take her features. Seconds after it began Brook was dangling from her broom with one hand as it shook violently. Draco could hear Lee Jordan try to call attention to her as she began to jerk the broom closer to the ground, so if she fell it wasn't one hundred feet above the ground.
"He doesn't like the two of you, and if I wasn't your guys' friend I wouldn't tell you this at all," Draco paused to look around at the table. "He probably won't like you either Hermione, because you are a bit of a know-it-all."
Harry stared at the professor who had so sharply asked him to answer a question that seemed impossible to answer. Was that supposed to be obvious? Was it common knowledge? Was it something in the book he had yet to read?
"C-can I have that back?" Neville asked hesitantly. Draco smiled cheekily, and tossed the glass ball back and forth between his fingers. The smoke in the ball began turning red as Draco stopped smiling and he stopped tossing the ball.
Hermione file that information away later. The portrait swung forwards to reveal a hole in the wall. Percy helped them through one at a time, and then led them into the Gryffindor common room, a cozy, round room with many squishy armchairs. While the First Years wanted to oogle the room, Percy knew they were all tired, and directed the girls up their tower -he couldn't go with them because the stairs to the girls dormitory were charmed to turn into a slide if boys tried- before he led the boys to their room. It was at the top of a long staircase, obviously the top of one of the many towers Harry had seen outside, and inside they found what they all were hoping for: Beds. Five beds with thick red curtains surrounding each of them for privacy. Their suitcases had already been brought up, which made getting into their pj's all the easier. The Gryffindor first year boys fell asleep very quickly after.
Chilly silence reigned in the chilly room, which only served to make the room feel even more so. Harry took a subtle glimpse at his friends, as he did not want Professor Snape to think he wasn't paying attention. Draco looked slightly amused, Neville looked terrified, and Hermione looked offended that anyone would call her a dunderhead.
"I've never had anything like that. I touch people and I get a rush of emotions that foretell my relationship with that person." Harry explained.
Harry laughed, because after everything else he'd seen, this didn't surprise him. Still, he made a mental note to find out where the 'third floor corridor on the right hand side' was so he could safely avoid it at all costs. Along with a note to see the forest, so he knew the parameters of the area he could walk during his free time.
“Oh, I think I know what that is!” Ron gasped. “It’s supposed to be very rare and valuable. Try it on, like a blanket.”
“Mom...” He whispered. The woman nodded, and waved. The man wrapped his arm around her to comfort her as her eyes welled with tears, and he too smiled. “Dad?”
Draco was next. He mounted his broom and went up. He scanned the crowd for his friends as he rose far from the ground, maybe to take some of their Gryffindor courage and give it back later. He couldn't find them though, not for a long time. He was doing his round and trying to keep the quaffle from the ground before he finally spotted them. His broom jerked -and his heart entered his throat- and he spun around to see the teacher stand. Hermione had set fire to Professor Snape's robes. Draco was stuck between terror, laughter, and sheer surprise, and didn't know whether he should smile or shout at her.
The other five students tried to pu on the best believable faces they could so as to now downturn Draco's story. Professor McGonagall watched them as Draco spoke, and looked at Draco as he finished.
"All I know is it's not Professor Snape. It has to be someone else." Draco said, as if that finished that. The other three didn't have anything to say that hadn't already been said, so it did finish the conversation.
“Is-Isn’t he like this be-bec-because o-of an encounter with a v-vampire?” Neville asked. Professor Snape looked at the boy sharply, then walked away over to his desk. The students didn’t move until he told them too, all too afraid they would mess up what felt like a delicate situation.
They left a long while later, with rock cakes weighing down their pockets, and a bit of slobber on each of their cloaks. When they entered Hogwarts, Draco parted from them. Not that it was surprising, he did have his own house to go to. Now that Harry thought about it, he wondered if they were allowed to walk into each others common rooms. He hadn't seen anything that said they couldn't, but nothing said they could.
"You needed an unlocking charm to get in." Harry said, not to soothe Neville but to point something out. Hermione stared up at Harry for a split second at his words, and then went back to staring into the fire. Harry shrugged off her weird reaction to continue to help Neville where he could.
"Mister Malfoy, five points will be taken from Slytherin for this," Professor McGonagall said. Professor Snape twitched, like he wanted to take far more than just five. "I'm very disappointed in you. If you're not hurt at all, you'd better get off to the Slytherin dungeons. Students are finishing the feast in their houses."
"It doesn't matter what you focused on, Severus Snape would not purposely cause his students harm to get me on the field. He didn't want me on the field to begin with, he just knew my father would hear about it if he didn't, and when it comes to what I want, my father is very picky." Draco explained to them. That clearly put a damper in their thoughts about his head of house, and he would admit he was a little peeved they even went there to begin with.
The grin Harry gave Neville was probably the brightest look the boy had ever had directed at him, and while Neville followed Harry with confusion, Harry was happy to help the boy. He left Ron without a word, who continued to work through the cards. The only interruptions Ron experienced after that was a pale haired boy knocking on the door.
"Swap you for one of these," Harry said, and held up a pasty. Ron hesitated at the offer, so Harry encouraged, "Go on."
None of the houses fit, and he wondered if he'd be cast out, because he didn't fit. What if he was already a failure in the community? It hadn't even been one day.
"I bet Draco is being nice to be your friend." Ron said to Harry helpfully. Harry jumped at the noise, because he hadn't seen Ron before he spoke.
Hermione turned to Harry, who grinned at her. The feelings he got from Neville hadn't completely faded yet, and he was ready to take whatever happened in stride.
"Sure. You can help yourself to the rest," Harry said. "But in, you know, the Muggle world, people just stay put in photos."
Harry looked ahead of his suitcase and saw one of the red headed twins from before. He was all pale and freckled, and his brown eyes just twinkled with underlying mischief.
The first few seconds were peaceful and fatherly. It was over the course of however long they knew each other that things like distraught and confusion took hold. He began to feel a syrupy mix of frustration and love for the man in front of him, and it was only as he let go did he get put back in the present.
“Yeah, an alert charm. Rig it to a teacher so they’re alerted when Professor Quirrell goes down.” Draco backed.
"Er, yes, I think so," Ron said. "I think Mum's got a second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk about him."
The hall burst into applause after the hat sang, and it sank back into its original form of complacent seating. Professor McGonagall came back up to the front, this time with a long scroll in her hands.
On one hand Harry agreed with Neville, but on the other hand he thought that Neville was forgetting that Draco had
of hesitation and distrust as well. He wasn't sure why there was trust and distrust with the friendly giant, but he didn't trust any of it yet.
Out came a tall, black haired witch with stern features and prim emerald green robes. She screamed 'do not cross' with a simple look in her eye, and the first years bristled under her gaze.
"Draco's housemates didn't like that he went in with me. I think it's not allowed." Neville answered quietly.
Adrian was taken off the field for concussion worry, and Bartholomew Vaisy, a second year newbie, took his place. When Bartholomew took the field, all that was left in the reserves was Draco. They'd never needed more than two people in reserves, Draco wasn't actually ever supposed to play. If things continued though, he definitely would.
"I'm sorry-" The two started as one, and then they stopped. They stared, and Harry jostled his weight while he thought of what to say.
"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all the chances he deserves? He gives us all a bad name and you know, he's not really even a ghost- I say, what are you all doing here?" A second ghost, one that looked like a failed jester, took notice of the grouplet.
"No." Draco said, straight up. His response made Hermione pull an even more sour face, and he imagined that would be the face she made if she ever got a question wrong.
On Thursday there was buzz between the Slytherin table and Gryffindor table. It was the first flying lesson for them, and it seemed to be all any of them could talk about. That and the sport it plays, Quidditch. Ron and Seamus were over the moon for quidditch, while Dean was more into soccer, and Harry was confused how Dean knew about soccer. Turns out he had a muggle TV at home, and it was a past time for him and his dad to watch soccer.
"Oh, of course, you wouldn't know, Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, to collect, famous witches and wizards. I've got about five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy."
“I think the fact that she is willing to put time into something says a lot about her love for you,” Harry mumbled. He didn’t know if Ron heard him though.
“His father used to work for You-Know-Who,” Ron whispered. Harry still heard him, and he looked at Ron. Ron stared at the Malfoy emblem with a lace of malice in his eyes, and it didn’t take Harry long to put two and two together. Ron had been happy to meet him when they first met on the train. He’d made it clear he was against You-Know-Who with how he looked at Harry’s scar. Harry was friends with the children of one of the followers of You-Know-Who.
After Herbology was lunch for every student. There, Draco approached Harry near the end of lunch to see if they even had classes together that day. It turned out, rather conveniently, that the next class they both had was one and the same: Transfiguration. Draco apparently already knew where the class was, and offered to take the Gryffindors. The group agreed, some less enthusiastically than others, and it was seen, for the first time in many years, that Gryffindors and Slytherins walked in a decently close group. At the head of it were Draco, Harry, and Hermione, in a questionably awkward silence.
"You're supposed to ask me if I want it back," Neville provided helpfully. "You're not going to forget again, are you?" he teased.
"Because you're Harry Potter. You're the Boy-Who-Lived. That's a good friend to have in his mind." Ron explained. Harry tilted his head. The group stopped before the Fat Lady. While Hermione gave the password, Harry responded.
"Aren't where our rooms are located supposed to be a secret?" Dean asked from across the table. The three looked up at him and Seamus, who had been listening in.
"You want it back?" Draco asked as cheekily as his grin. Neville nodded slowly, because he couldn't figure why Draco was acting so... Bullish. Draco had never acted like a bully though, not even way back in the beginning - even if that was just last week - of their friendship.
Ron opened a lumpy package from his mom, and out came a maroon sweater that his mum made him. Harry thought it was sweet, but Ron stuck his tongue out at the gift.
"My teachers... I'm only ever around them for a year, so our relationships were short lived... I learned a lot about my teachers." Harry explained. He wouldn't go into much detail, because some of his teachers really hated by the end of the years. Except for Mr. Quinn, who really liked him the entire time he was a pupil.
"Keep quiet, maybe it'll walk by." Hermione whispered. As one, the group faced the entrance of the bathroom, each with a wand out.
Nerves took him once more then. He could play. Everything he'd learned now could be put to the test soon. Frantically he considered everything Hermione had told him, and then covered what his teammates had said. He repeated it to himself until Marcus Flint went down, very slowly mind you, he did not go down easily like Adrian. He fell the farthest as well, he didn't lower his broom when it started to act up. It was Professor Dumbledore's quick reflexes that kept him from hitting the ground hard when he fell one hundred feet.
"We don't know yet. Professor Quirrell has gone looking for him." Blaise answered. He nodded to where the teachers were waiting for their turn to enter the scene, but only two could be seen. The four first years sighed.
"Surely they aren't so cruel." Hermione admonished. Neither twin responded, but they heard distinctive snickers. Ron knew what that meant, and slumped into his seat in relief and began to eat normally once more. Seamus took in Ron's form, and followed suit.
“Yes. I taught him years ago. He’s much more than the quivering mess he portrays.” Professor Snape sneered. The teacher could remember the old Ravenclaw well.
"Mr. Malfoy," Professor McGonagall began. She stared at the Slytherin first year for a long moment. "That was a very brave thing to do, to help a classmate with his rogue broom. Ten points to Slytherin for your fast reaction."
The instant their hands came in contact, a worm of joy settled into the back of Harry's head, which he poked at before it could fade away, and recieved what could be considered opposite to the feelings he got from Ron. A wash of acceptance and excitement flooded in to pool around Harry's brain, which made his mind feel as if it was submerged in a sea of warm sap, but not uncomfortably so. A blanket of sympathy and comfort would often find a way into their relationship; friendly love turned into it's brotherly counterpart; the thrill of adventure swamped around - Harry could've sworn he felt an echo of cheerful laughter in there.
Ron didn't seem ready to get up from the seat until he needed to, but Harry held sympathy towards the boy who was in obvious distress, even if he himself had never had a pet to lose before Hedwig. Harry stood up from his spot.
"Because you set a fire in the teachers' section. That doesn't mean it was Professor Snape." Draco told them.
"Why?" Harry asked. They didn't get to figure it out when they felt Neville tug on their shirts, and they turned around to see if he needed help.
Professor Snape's black eyes landed on him, "Potter!" he barked. He made his way along the side of the room to the back, with his steady gaze, "What would I get if I added a powdered root of asphodel to an infusion of wormwood?"
"I'm not trying to be brave or anything, saying the name, I just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads to learn... I bet," He paused before he said something that had been worrying him a lot lately, "I bet I'm the worst in the class."
“You would get to him too late,” Hermione replied back, and Professor Snape wanted, just for a moment, to be able to
"I don't remember my line." Draco whined after the silence had gone on for more than a couple of minutes, and ducked his head. The class groaned, none of them wanted to be subjected to Professor Snape's spiel again. He took way too much joy in that.
Eventually, when breakfast was well under headway, Ron and Seamus made an appearance and took all the food they could get before it disappeared. They looked a little winded, and it only took a short comment to find out why it took them so long.
As a unit the six students began to make noise. Harry and Neville shouted at it to keep its attention, and it wobbled its head back and forth as it listened to both of them. While they did that, Hermione and Pansy were attempting to take the club away from the troll by using the levitation spell they'd learned throughout that day, and Blaise and Draco used the fire hex they'd learned from Herbology to get him to back away and keep him from attacking.
"Because he's a Prefect," His mother said. "All right, dear, well, have a good term, send me an owl when you get there." She kissed Percy on the cheek and he left. Then she turned to the twins.
Harry looked over at the Slytherin table once more and saw what could only be the Bloody Baron, a horrible looking ghost with blank eyes, a gaunt face, and robes stained with silver blood. He sat next to Draco Malfoy, who did not look happy to be there.
Before them, once more, was the giant dog. Draco wasn't going to go near the thing as soon as he saw the three sets of maws, but Hermione and Harry ventured farther into the room. The dog was asleep, and pushed back away from the trap door Hermione had definitely seen that night. It had a handle with no lock, and when Harry pulled it, it opened easily.
"Gran knows I forget things," Neville explains once he'd identified the object. "It tells you if there's something you've forgotten to do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red -oh..."
It was quiet for a very long time, because none of the students knew what to say. Then, a small voice spoke from the back.
"I thought I was when I saw Professor Snape... It would have been ok though," Draco answered. Neville glowed under his words even if he still grimaced at the thought. A few of the Slytherin's bristled around him, which Draco saw. He continued, "Private tutors would be much better than this school."
"Poor dear, no wonder he was alone. He was so polite when he asked how to get onto the platform." The mother reflected.
“No, but you will do a great many things. You already use your father’s cloak.” Professor Dumbledore answered easily. The old wizard suddenly wrapped an arm around Harry and tugged him down a different corridor as sounds of voices came from the hall they were about to walk down. The new corridor would take them longer to get to the Gryffindor common room, but Harry wasn’t about to question the man’s decisions. It seemed clear Professor Dumbledore wanted to keep Harry out of sight from others.
"I can promise that. No more hiding." Draco responded easily. Hermione let go of them, and they began to creep in farther away from the bathroom. At splitting point, where Gryffindors went upstairs and Slytherins went downstairs, they stopped and said goodbye to one another.
“Why?” He asked. He looked at the mirror once more, and his parents were still there. Professor Dumbledore was in the mirror now as well, but his parents didn’t look at the teacher. It was like they had no idea he was there, right in front of his father. Professor Dumbledore smiled at Harry through the reflection.
That's exactly what they did too. They only had to wait about thirty minutes, which Harry and Neville used to boost Hermione's confidence, and then they left for flying class. When they arrived they found the person they'd been looking for the night before wasn't there: Draco Malfoy.
"Who was near him?" Harry asked Hermione eventually. Hermione opened her mouth to answer, but no words came out. She closed her mouth as her ears turned red.
"Hmm," said a small voice in his head. "Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty of courage, I see. Not a bad mind either. There's talent, oh my goodness, yes- and a nice thirst to prove yourself... Now that's interesting... You can see the future of yourself with others, that'll make your friendships very hard... So where shall I put you?"
"What's that?" Said one of the twins suddenly, and he pointed at Harry's lightning scar. Harry brushed it with his fingers and watched their reactions.
"We went down the hall a month ago trying to find you and saw what was behind the door at the end of it." Neville said in a rush. The other two looked at him like he'd betrayed them, and he shrugged. Draco raised an eyebrow.
“They were my students, and later great friends of mine,” The Headmaster explained. He looked down at Harry. “They would be proud of you.”
At the end of the chapter is a bit of a "blooper" for the story. This story will have darker moments and themes, and we want to provide you all with fun scenes meant purely for laughs. This could be done after any chapter we have bloopers for, or after every five chapters, etc. Let us know how you guys feel about this.
“Happy Christmas, Harry.” Professor Dumbledore answered. Harry stared at the old man in wonder, and followed him as they began their trek upstairs.
"Horrible... well, not all of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers." Harry said.
“And you’re sure it’s not anyone else?” Draco asked. Professor Snape looked at the four for a short time, studying them now. He never actively watched them, he only ever saw Draco with them. This was his chance to see how they worked.
Draco was allowed on the reserves for the Quidditch team, if they ever needed him. He wasn't allowed on the team yet, Professor Snape thought he was too young still, but if no one else could, he was allowed to play. It made his house go wild, they were the first house in decades to allow a first year on the team.
"Bye." Harry said and Ron with varied degrees of enthusiasm. The twins slid the compartment door shut behind them, and disappeared farther down the train. Harry saw Ron's fingers tap at his knee, and he relented himself for the soon to be questions.
"And don't get into trouble again, I don't think my heart can take it." Neville moaned where he leaned against the wall with his hand on his heart. Harry patted him on the shoulder as best as he could, and hoped it helped.
"Oh, hello Hermione." Neville murmured. Hermione stopped in front of them, and looked between the two.
He looked down the steps to see Draco being helped up by one of the Slytherins, who was giggling too hard to really do anything. Neville, who was also lost in a fit of giggles, held out a hand for him to take. Harry took the offered hand and stood up. The giggles within him began to rise up as well.
He stepped into the library, where his red eyes scanned for a large figure. It didn't take long to find Ugoki, who was leaning back in his equally large stage chair with a newspaper from that week's edition of
"Nonsense, we're friends." She answered easily. She smiled again, more to herself this time, because she could say that and it would be true. In reaction to her smile both Neville and Harry smiled, because neither of them had really had friends before either.
“Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi.” He whispered to himself. It wasn’t anything he’d ever learned, and he wondered what it meant.
Harry set the package down and picked up the blanket. It felt like water to the touch, and was far bigger than he, so big he thought he and his friends could use it comfortably to hide under. He threw it around his shoulders and watched Ron.
"Run!" Hermione whispered to the other two. They took off down a long hall, and not too soon either as they heard Filch.
The three of them were happy to forget about the dog, but remembered which hallway it had been in. They retired for the evening, and vouched to get to Draco the next day, on Halloween.
"Would you like to be friends? Or... Acquaintances, maybe?" Harry asked. Draco drew himself up like he'd prepared a response already to this, and then he paused.
They were quiet for a time as they watched the fields and lanes flick past. Around half past twelve there was a great clattering outside in the corridor and a smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, "Anything off the cart, dears?"
Professor Snape stood from beside the troll with a slight limp, and stared hard at the six. He had a look of disappointment for his Slytherins, and a look of discontempt for the Gryffindors. Professor Quirrell watched them from behind Professor McGonagall.
Harry reached out and touched Hermione and Draco. They both looked at him weird, but he didn't answer why. He felt the flood of emotions that overcame him to make sure that they all survived and their futures with him didn't suddenly disappear. They didn't, and his head swirled with emotions that stretched for what felt like eons.
"If he's expelled it's my fault." Neville whispered to Harry and Hermione once thirty minutes had passed. They tried to comfort them as they could, but there was little to say. It would be, technically, Neville's fault, and they couldn't say Draco wasn't expelled.
Professor McGonagall proceeded to turn her desk into a pig and back again. The students stared in wonder and a whir of excitement filled the room, but this was quickly shot down as Professor McGonagall went on to have them take elaborate notes. The energy picked back up again when they were given needles to turn into matches, glad to have something practical to do even if it wasn't on the same scale as tables and animals. Harry found the task difficult, and succeeded in only making his needle a bit more rounded. Only Hermione was able to transfigure a needle by the end of class, which earned her a smile from Professor McGonagall. Draco seemed genuinely impressed by that, but never said anything. Harry got the distinct feeling that it wasn't because the task was difficult, but he didn't know what else it could be.
"None that I know of... Well... I swear I heard a snake talk." Harry admitted as the memory came back to mind. Neville tripped in his step, which told Harry that, no, that was not one of a seers' abilities.
Harry overheard to conversation around him, but had grown too tired to really enthuse such talk. He looked up to the teacher's table to see how likely they were to be let go soon so he could sleep. Hagrid drank from his goblet as if in a drinking match, though no one was playing with him; Professor McGonagall was talking to Professor Dumbledore; A wild looking professor with frizzy hair talked to a squirrely looking professor in a turban. Harry had seen the man in a turban at the Leaky Cauldron, over a month ago, and could swear his name was Professor Quirrell. On the other side of Professor Quirrell was a teacher with greasy black hair, a hooked nose, and sallow skin, overall an unpleasant looking teacher to say the least.
"There are s-stronger locking charms. The simplest one s-shouldn't have opened that d-door." Neville responded. Harry didn't know that, though he suppose he should have. Not everything in the wizarding world should be so easy. Their first year were the basics. Which made Harry wonder as well why the door was so easy to open.
Draco was in the dungeon bathroom, and Blaise didn't know enough spells to take on a troll. Hermione would though, and even if she didn't know enough, having more than one person against a possible troll while they got Draco out was better than just one person.
"C'mon, follow me. Anymore firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!" Hagrid crowed. They slipped and stumbled their way as they followed Hagrid down what seemed to be a steep, narrow path. It was so dark on either side of them that despite Hagrid's lamp Harry thought there must be thick trees everywhere. Few children murmured as they went, most just kept to themselves. Neville, the boy who lost his toad, sniffled once or twice.
"I thought I would have to choose. Between you and my home. It's all my housemates ever said." Draco said quietly. It was then that they realized that Draco had been facing this the last two months of school, and not just the last two weeks he'd been avoiding them at all costs.
"Best get food down then, the food disappears from the entire table, not just the platters," Fred said from farther down the table. Panic struck the pair, and they began to eat quicker.
"You are here to learn the subtle science and specific art of potion making," Professor Snape began. He spoke quiet enough that the back of the class barely heard him, but they all caught every word. Similar to Professor McGonagall, Professor Snape had your attention with every word without having to try. "As there is less wand-work in here, many of you will not see the magic within this craft. I don't believe you will truly understand the beauty of the softly simmering cauldron with its shimmering fumes, the delicate power of liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the senses... I can teach you how to bottle fame, brew glory, even place a stopper death - if you aren't as big a bunch of dunderheads that I usually have to teach."
"Welcome to Hogwarts," said the professor. "The start-of-term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats in the Great Hall, you will be sorted into your houses. The Sorting is a very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes with the rest of your house, sleep in your house dormitory, and spend free time in your house common room.
Only once his name was called did he look away. As he looked away he was aware of a disturbing silence that had fallen over the room. It appeared his name did not go unnoticed by anyone.
"Alright then. Thank you, Draco." Harry replied. He and Neville shrugged their own shoulders slightly. Draco nodded to Harry, and then seemed to perk up. He sat up straighter and began to eat his muffin more.
The first years ducked into the stalls as the troll came tumbling down, and only as the rubble settled and the troll stayed down did they leave. To see Professor McGonagall, Snape, and Quirrell.
"That doesn't say anything about me." Harry said once more. Ron shrugged, like that ended that. It didn't though.
"Mad?" Percy parroted. "He's a genius! Best wizard in the world! But he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?"
"It seems like you're the one that thinks this and not Draco." Hermione said. Ron looked over at her finally, and then he flushed red to his hair.
“His family are... dark. It could really be anything.” Ron explained cautiously. He was aware of how the four friends stood up for one another, he didn’t want to make Harry mad by saying the wrong thing, but he didn’t want to hide the truth from Harry either.
The green eyed kid turned around and continued with Neville up the rest of the stairs. It was an awkward silence that followed, that Harry didn't want to exist.
November came and with it, the first Quidditch match of the season: Slytherins vs Gryffindors. Draco was taught how to play every position, in case he was ever needed for any of them, was given a uniform, and a broom. He would never tell anyone, but he wished he could jump for joy. Him, Draco Malfoy, was the first Quidditch team member that was a first year, for the first time in a century. Even if he never played, he would always have that title. His father was, definitely, proud, if the Nimbus 2000 was anything to say for it.
