“I dunno,” Harry says laughingly, standing up and coming over once more, “magic?” He kisses Malfoy gently, pressing his hand over the curve of his now enormous bump.
“Careful, Potter. Your children already think we might be friends.”
“You call me and I’ll happily come drag the little bitch away.” He smiles sweetly around his fork.
“You worry too much, darling,” Narcissa says gently, dabbing at her mouth and smiling at Draco over the rim of her wine glass. “The elves can bring you some stewed fruit for the little one when she’s hungry.”
Harry moans roughly, thrusting madly as he comes, fucking his come into Draco with rough, jarring strokes that knock the breath out of him.
me,” he says dangerously, “why you hate Tristan.”
“I don’t know,” Malfoy said once more, and Harry was completely certain that he was smiling – he could see it when he closed his eyes; pink lips spreading into that slow smirk, grey eyes sparkling with mischief, pink spots of excitement high on sharp cheekbones. “I was just doing my job, Potter.”
“Is this the...?” Potter holds up the vial and inspects it closely, his eyes crossing slightly as he peers at it. The vial is only about the length of his finger and slightly slimmer in girth, and for a moment Draco is worried Potter might end up inadvertently snapping the fine glass. “It’s not blue,” Potter finally comments, after inspecting the vial in silence for a long minute.
There was a crack like a gunshot. The boys screamed something out. The dementor holding Lily immediately began backing away. Footsteps charged on the floorboards behind him and the next second, someone sailed over Harry’s head, jumping right over him.
Draco feels his face heat startlingly quick. “Oh my god, fuck
His eyes flutter open and the long, pale lashes are damp. With my heart thudding painfully, bitter guilt on my tongue, I watch as he clumsily straightens up and half-sits up against the armrest. He looks at me, mouth open like he wants to say something but doesn’t know quite how to frame it.
,” Malfoy murmurs, turning his head to regard Harry steadily. “It’s the holidays, Potter, where’s your generosity of spirit?”
Potter doesn’t talk again for a bit, flipping the page again and smoothing a hand softly over the next photograph – his parents, clearly just wed, standing and beaming at the camera alongside Sirius Black, Remus Lupin – bright-eyed, far less burdened in appearance – and – Draco realises with an unpleasant start – Peter Pettigrew. He’s
“That’s...kind of--” Draco fidgets a little, fiddling with his cuffs, “Cool, I guess,” he finally says lamely, fully prepared for Potter to frown unhappily and walk away.
Potter grin is predatory and humourless. “Oh,
, that’s just something I made up to stop the press from linking me with literally anybody I was seen with!”
Slapping his cockhead against Potter’s arsehole a few times, Draco considers in silence, his vision doubling before him as he waits. Potter holds very still and Draco can hear his own heart thumping in his ears, his mouth dry and his breath slightly choppy. He doesn’t know what he’s doing, not really, but he resents Potter for how well he had fucked Draco a week ago and he wants to

Harry threw the receiver back onto the base and went back to his Earl Grey, somehow thoroughly irritated with that smooth voice.
, doesn’t he? Do you suck his cock every time he flips his hair at you?” Harry guffaws loudly and throws her off. “Have you written over all your money to his greedy arse yet?” she asks on a throaty giggle.
Still scowling, Draco leafed through the book again and found the recipe he’d been reading, carefully noting the techniques and any unheard-of methods that he could introduce into his own potions at Mungo’s. Just as his eyes landed on a paragraph that described a particularly interesting way to extract natural oils, he saw a familiar-looking white cloth being dragged across the floor.
. I don’t need your help, period. I was merely being polite when I told you about this. I can do this by myself. And I was just being courteous when I agreed to this Healer’s appointment, Potter.”
“That won’t be necessary, I didn’t plan to stay anyway,” Draco says quickly.
“I haven’t seen him in over three years. I think he’s engaged now, on top of that.”
The screams were getting louder, more hysterical.
beyond a grunt, and we fought in a War together; he’ll likely look right through you.”
“Do you want it to happen again?” Harry interrupted. This time Malfoy just swallowed thickly, fidgeting slightly and licking his lips, leaving them wet and Harry hard. He leaned forward and traced a little shapeless design over the back of Malfoy’s wrist – Malfoy didn’t pull away.
“I’m scared.”
Harry set out three bowls and poured some chocolate buttons into each of them. Then he cut up some apples and pulled out a pack of chocolate digestives, placing a couple alongside the fruit for the boys. For Lily, he took out a small tub of creamed rice.
“Yes, fuck please,
Lifting his delightfully sore arse off Harry’s sticky cock, Draco flings himself into the crook of Harry’s arm which then automatically curls around his waist. Cleaning Charms are murmured, Draco’s lip is Healed and the lights are spelled off, so that in the shadowy darkness of their room, the half-moon playing shameless voyeur, it’s just them, Draco and Harry, entwined mind and body.
“What do you mean?” Narcissa looks absolutely horrified. “What do you mean by that? Where did you go after you left that boy? Draco, we thought you were working –
“No,” was the immediate answer.
“Oh, yes. Are you coming?”
Malfoy snorted. “I assure you, Potter, even
, you’re about to be a fucking parent yourself! And I’m not doing
He’s lifted right off the floor, Harry bending his knees slightly to receive the dead weight of Draco slamming into him with the force of a fucking freight train, and scooping him up, so that suddenly, Draco finds himself with his legs coiled around Harry’s waist, practically crushing his sternum with his thighs. He pants down at Harry, whose eyes sparkle at him, his mouth curved into that smile Draco yearns to see every day, his hands crushing Draco to himself.
“Harry.”
“I—” Malfoy fidgets vigorously now, “I read to...it, alright? Every night – every night that I’m alone,” he hurries to clarify. “I just read whatever I’m currently reading because it’s not as if it can understand anyway.” Malfoy sighs when Harry just gapes at him with his mouth wide open. “It’s alright if you don’t want to, Potter. I just thought you might like to—”
“I know,” said Harry. “I—The kids are devastated about Ginny.”
But they weren’t friends either and Harry wished... it were somehow different.
He doesn’t have to open his eyes to know that Potter is smirking like an utter arsehole. “Yes, Draco?” he prompts gently, fingers dancing over the inside of Draco’s left thigh, tickling and stroking him through the silk of his trousers.
“Harry.” Ron looks at me beseechingly, failing abysmally at trying to control his own helpless laughter. Draco has one leg wrapped around him and is rubbing his cheek on Ron’s shoulder, singing the chorus from Celestina Warbeck’s ‘Hubba Bubba Bubblin’ Heart’.
He’s had months,
“I think I might have to. It sounded a bit threatening.”
“Psh, no, he isn’t even gay,” he clarifies, rolling his eyes and picking up the menu again. “His brother is, though,” he adds casually, glancing up through his lashes at me with a completely debauched grin, grey eyes sparkling. “So,
“The bloke’s fine, love,” Ron answers her, rolling his eyes. “He danced for a straight hour at the club last week. Much to Malfoy’s pleasure,” he adds the last bit to me under his breath.
“Yes.” Harry kept his eyes wide open and fixed on the rain outside the nearest window because every time he so much as blinked while thinking about it, he could clearly recall the dementor bending over Ginny as she lay sprawled out and helpless. He’d left her there like that. “So how can she be gone?” he said out loud.
. Now if that’s all you’re here for—” gestures at the door, “—such a pleasure talking with you and everything.”
“It’s after
“The wolfsbane and silver stay in your bloodstream and keep the wolf suppressed,” Draco explains, “and along with it, all of its base instincts. It’ll also, to an extent, make your transformations less painful,” he adds, smiling hesitantly as Potter stares in utter disbelief. “You’ll also notice a more regular sleep pattern now, as well as an increase in appetite. You can imbibe your dose at any point in the day, as long as you take one vial
, you arse.”
Harry’s breath whooshes out of him and he finds himself back on his feet, hands in his hair as he gapes at Hermione in disbelieving, incredulous confusion. Hermione’s own mouth is pursed tightly and her eyes are slits as she stares thoughtfully at Malfoy.
ingly messy. The fact that he seems nearly incapable of having an ulterior motive for doing something; his almost frustrating transparency, his brutal honesty.
Malfoy was oddly silent under him now, his breath forced out of him in hot bursts with each of Harry’s thrusts, his hands resting uselessly on Harry’s back, his legs wrapped around Harry’s waist. When Harry muffled another helpless groan into Malfoy’s neck, he whispered, “Deeper.”
“Nothing!” he insists creakily, emerging red-faced again, “I’m—I’m really

“Are we doing this or what?!” Malfoy sounded beyond annoyed as he helplessly arched into Harry’s mouth. But Harry didn’t know how to tell him that he was a tad bit terrified. He didn’t know how to tell him that he’d never done this before. Until, “Have you ever fucked a guy, Potter?”
Draco snorts, brushing his mouth over Harry’s scar, his temple, his cheek, his hand curled around Harry’s neck, his pulse a strong, rhythmic drumming under Draco’s palm. “Tell me truthfully – was last night at all even slightly more tolerable than usual?”
Draco isn’t quite certain how it happens, but the little outing he’d enforced upon Potter somehow ends with Potter and he going back to Draco’s flat, where Draco proceeds to start brewing a light Sleeping Draught Potter mentioned wanting in passing, and Potter sitting there and watching Draco.
with.”
“Baron?”
The dementors formed a wide circle around them. Behind him, his sons were whimpering. One dementor broke free of the others and glided to a spot a few feet away from Harry. One scabbed, grey hand emerged from the depths of its black cloak and reached out, seemingly closing around nothing, and pulled.
“Harry, you f—” Draco tried to speak—tried really hard—but failed miserably, his voice dying in his throat as Harry released his arm and peeled him open with one hand, wrapping the other arm under Draco’s abdomen and jerking his hips upwards and forcing Draco onto tiptoes.

He put away the bedding as the children padded around, their socked feet getting drenched in dew. He knew he needed to get them cleaned up a bit– maybe clean up a bit himself – and feed them breakfast. But his mind was on overdrive; half-formed plans tumbled over one another and for all the urges he felt to do something constructive, he felt unprepared and naive.
the one who’s been known to strut around flanked by bodyguards. Sure.”
Then Malfoy sighs too. “I’ll...think about it,” he says softly.
Granger nods to Draco on their way out while Weasley just stares at him, and for a while, as he hears Weasley’s humongous feet clomping down the stairs, Draco just stands there, shifting from foot to foot, feeling awkward and intrusive.
It’s a Weasely jumper, and Harry almost doesn’t want to take it off for how insanely happy it makes him to see Draco clad in the misshapen, woolly white jumper with Molly’s signature letter on the front. The ‘D’ that Draco has only his is a lot fancier than the standard square ‘H’ that Harry and Hermione always get, along with Ron’s slightly lopsided ‘R’.
Harry snorts and this time he kisses Draco’s mouth, slowly parting his lips with his own and sliding their tongues together. Draco clutches at him, pouring himself into the kiss until there’s nothing left to give, yielding completely within the circle of Harry’s arms.
“I’m fine,” Draco whispers at once, laying one warm hand on Harry’s cheek; he feels scorching hot, just like he had that day that he’d pressed his nose into Draco’s neck and sniffed him. “Is your leg okay? I’ll ask Kreacher to bring you a dose of Skele-Gro.”
Minutes passed and Potter still hadn’t spoken. Draco was sitting close enough to him that he could smell Potter’s cheap Muggle deodorant, a smell that he most certainly did not find oddly erotic. When he stole a glance at him, he saw a single drop of sweat trickle down the side of Potter’s face. Draco could feel himself starting to sweat beneath his arms and resisted the urge to sniff his armpits. The crowd around them went on chattering and drinking, completely unaware of the enormity of the situation Draco was in.
There was pin-drop silence on the other end.
But then the sound came again, slightly louder, and this time it was a pronounced
“Malfoy!” Fox snarls.
Potter looks exasperated. “I’m only asking to know if it’s a powerful enough memory,” he says. “I had to switch a few memories before one worked.”
“What,” Harry said blankly.
“So, we get to take full credit?” Draco laughs. “Brilliant. Maybe we can blackmail them into naming their children after us.”
“Tristan and me.”

Harry feels a huge, freezing ball of fear settle in his throat. “What if it’d transformed?” he whispers, voice cracking.
“Okay,” Draco replies coldly. “I’m going up to bed now.” Potter releases his hand slowly and Draco scrambles to his feet, picking up his book and the mug of milk Potter had brought him before striding away.
“He wouldn’t shut up about his fucking

Hermione had seemed rather grateful for that.
he was whispering in the first place. “Malfoy, is that you?”
not as fancy as you are, you git.”
Just as the magnitude of the fact that this very friendship is probably over is sinking in for real, there is a series of thumps on the front door, hard enough that I hear the doorknob rattle. I start, my vision clearing, my clogged brain registering the infomercial playing on the TV, and look around to check the time. It’s a quarter past two.
“And so what if they are,” Harry brushed aside huskily, releasing Draco’s arse to reach between them and unfasten his trousers, finally releasing his own flushed thickness, damp and streaming with slick. Draco moaned and closed his hand over Harry’s, stroking him in quick, practised movements that had Harry tossing his head back.
But Draco has launched himself at Potter, crashing into him hard enough to send him slamming back into the pillows with a grunt, their mouths meeting in something resembling a kiss, teeth clacking, tongues jabbing. Without lifting his lips off Potter’s, Draco kicks off his pyjamas, wrestles Potter’s jeans down his thighs, and lines up their cocks together so he can wrap one hand around them.
I unclench my fist and look down. The wings immediately unfurl and beat weakly, but the little gold ball stays in my hand, glinting softly in the afternoon light.
Draco attacked his throat at once, leaving his own set of marks on the sun-bronzed skin, smiling against the jutting collarbones as Harry let out gritted grunts of pleasure into his mussed blond hair, jerking as Draco cupped his balls, rolling them in his hand before giving them a little squeeze--
For all the patience and uncertainty I’ve held on to since I got together with Draco, I find that I am no longer in the frame of mind to wait.
Luxuriously gyrating his hips in slow circles over Harry’s groin, Draco bites his lip as Harry’s dark, esurient gaze traverses down Draco’s svelte frame to land on his slender, pink cock as Draco rubs it over Harry’s stomach, leaving shiny trails of precome over it.
for you and you bloody well
Harry swallowed, licking his lips and sitting up straight. “We... We went to look for her but...” Harry floundered for sophisticated ways to put it but in the end just said, “But she was gone.”
We barely talk through it.
But Harry just shakes his head again, eyes falling shut as he sighs softly. When the tremors don’t stop even several minutes later, Draco draws the covers up higher, tucking it firmly below Harry’s bare body. “I’ll see you later, okay?” he whispers, not expecting a reply and not getting one.
“Draco!” Harry splutters, grinning despite himself.
“Tell me what you’re thinking,” Draco murmurs plaintively when, several minutes later, Harry still hasn’t said a word.
“Lily,” Harry whispered. “Expecto...”
Draco steps inside as Potter flattens himself against the front door instead of just stepping back; Draco’s shoulder brushes against Potter’s front as he sweeps past him and for a moment, Draco has the bizarre urge to press further against him, into that heat Potter’s body seems to emit through his clothes.
“Draco,” Harry groaned, and it was with no small amount of satisfaction that Draco let himself be snogged breathless for the next several minutes, winding long arms around his neck and keeping him in place this time, kissing him back hungrily and guiding Harry’s hands down to his arse once more.
“No, not smug.” George looks slightly panicked as he pulls his hand away hurriedly. “He kicking around in there again?”
“Why?” Potter does it again, licking along the curve of Draco’s ear as he gently plucks at his nipple, “You seemed to like it earlier.” He sniggers quietly when Draco whimpers, sliding down to curl his tongue around the tightened bud.
Harry was silent, his arms tightly wound around Draco’s trembling form. “Malfoy.” A little confused by the sudden reversion to his family name, Draco leaned back to peer into the bespectacled face that shone seriously at him. “We’re not going to lose this.” Harry paused. “Ever.” Draco licked his lips slowly, shutting his eyes against the glare of the fierce promise in that declaration. “Draco...” Harry kissed his name onto his forehead.
“Why did you leave?” Malfoy blurts out, leaning in helplessly towards his mother, his voice cracking. “Mother, why did you just—?” he breaks off suddenly on a dry sob, biting his lip and staring at the floor. Narcissa claps his hand with both of her own, her eyes filling again.
“Fuck off, Potter, I know you’re practically having a party right now, having learnt what you have about me.”
. You’re no fun.” He releases Draco only to shift to his side and take his hand, pushing his nose into it and pressing kisses to the palm.
“Sometimes. There’s a survivors camp some ways from here. The idiots don’t realise how dangerous it is to group together and wail about your sorrows and offer each other hugs and tea. It’s as if they

“So...you’re actually going to enjoy working in the Department for Magical Beings?” Draco asks sceptically.

Ron frowns, peering into my face. “You all right?” I quickly nod. “You got the Snitch then?” He grins down at my hand.
Draco bares his teeth, thrashing under him before yowling in agony – Potter’s got one leg twisted around one of his own and has it bent at an awkward, excruciatingly painful angle, so that Draco has to thump his free foot into the mats repeatedly to fight another scream of pain at the way his left knee is being contorted.
“He’s only stealing
“And what was it for?”
“Where are we?” Harry thought to ask suddenly.
“You gave her earrings last year,” Hermione reminds him.
“That night in the hospital wing, the time I got hit by a Bludger.”
“Are you listening to me?” Draco hisses. “Why don’t I have any socks? What the fuck am I supposed to do without a pair of clean, matching socks?”
“No, I’m
Eventually though, Malfoy reaches for his cock again, his hips swivelling and dancing with increasing fervour as Harry picks up the pace. Whipping his hips, Harry knocks aside Malfoy’s hand and folds his fingers around his bobbing prick, twisting them under the head and pulling the foreskin down on a sharp tug the way he knows Malfoy loves. With a broken cry, Malfoy spills over Harry’s knuckles, gravelly grunts of pleasure muffled into the pillow with each thrust of his hips, his arse rapidly convulsing around Harry’s cock.
“I am,” Potter mutters, now looking at the ceiling, one knee bouncing restlessly.
Draco goes back to Grimmauld Place with Potter’s freshly brewed muscle relaxants the following Saturday after breakfast. He’s somewhat of a dab hand at muscle relaxants, and he’d even brewed them for professional Quidditch players at one point back when he’d owned his little store in Diagon, and he can't wait to preen smugly as Potter marvels at the efficacy of the potion.
“I’m close,” Draco says raggedly. “I’m going to come, Potter. You want that?” Potter nods. “I’m going to come all over the
Draco scowls, still absently combing his fingers through his hair. “Why?”
Potter sets his fork down and wipes his mouth before neatly folding up the sports section, throwing Draco yet
And all those things cast a pretty fucking huge shadow.
Harry felt like complete shit. His magic hadn’t felt this depleted in a very long time. The effort to cling on to consciousness and attempt to open his eyes seemed monumental.
Malfoy shuts his eyes for a moment, looking thoroughly worn out. “I don’t know,” he finally says, flapping a hand carelessly. “A pot of Everlasting Ink – it’ll never fade – unlike whatever this has been written in,” he suddenly scowls down at the scroll, peering closely at the faded, slightly smudged old writing on it, “But that’s only if he invests a lot of time in researching and theorising magic, Potter, which I doubt,” he adds snidely. “There’s this amazing place in Diagon – sells the best dragon hide items; Self-Organising Folders, lightweight briefcases, handcrafted, bespoke shoes, you name it. You could simply go look around there actually, you’re sure to find something suitable.”
My stomach does an odd flip but I don’t pause to ponder. “Nah. I’m barely ever home anyway.”
“Great. Thank you again, Potter.”
“Peasant,” he muttered.
Ginny glances at Draco before turning around to give Tristan a look of exaggerated horror. “I am
“You know.” She waves her hand vaguely. “You get along brilliantly for two individuals who spent most of their teens trying to get each other killed.”
“Did I mean any of wh--?”
He got to his feet and turned to head over to Malfoy.
Malfoy simply nodded, lifting both knees to his chest, turning his face on the pillow so he wasn’t looking at Harry anymore. Harry swallowed hard, his saliva thick and his throat dry; he simply could
He leans back over Draco, smiling at the sight of his marooned cheeks and pouting mouth. “One look at you is all it takes to see how unattainable you are, Draco Malfoy,” he whispers, thumb swiping over Draco’s mouth. “And I definitely never saw myself securing someone as...” He doesn’t finish the sentence, just leaning his forehead against Draco’s with a broad smile. “No. You’re definitely not the sort that has flings.”
like Cinderella, isn’t it?! Like Cinderella, but with cock. Cock instead of slippers.”
He couldn’t stop thinking about what it’d be like to kiss him, to feel their chests press together, heart thudding in unison; to brush the hair out of his eyes, to have those grey eyes regard him with something akin to what Harry himself felt for Malfoy; to hold his hands and press honest words into his forehead, and to have them be believed.
Potter blushes but is barely able to hold back a smile. “Shut up, Malfoy,” he replies just as lightly, nudging a present wrapped elaborately in bright gold paper and dancing ribbons that’s sitting beside Draco’s plate – upon which sit two crisp, perfectly golden, enormously puffed

“Do it,” Harry bites out, spanking him again, over and over and over, with his free hand before grabbing one cheek pushing it inwards, against his cock, tightening the clutch around it. “Come now, do it now. Come for me, Draco.”
“Lily bear,” he whispered.
Instead he says, “Take it out.” He swallows hard, his throat suddenly parchment-dry. “Take my cock out and suck it.”
Harry had glared so viciously that not a single Healer came back into his room right up until he was discharged.
He’d wanked twice in showers after training the previous evening, Potter’s hissed insults, the feel of his body pressing Draco down, the weight of it, the hard
“Yes,” Harry whispers without hesitation. “Draco... Please.”
“Okay, then I will,” Ron pipes up.
“In all probability,” Ron agrees, nodding and grinning as he lifts his mug to Harry. “So, you want to put out an ad to help you find the arse that best fits your cock?”
And then James and Albus were there, whole and alive and tearful.
“Why’s the ferret
.” He presses Draco’s wand into his hand and curls his fingers around Draco’s. “Let’s just go get an early dinner? Then we can head upstairs to the dorms while everyone else is eating.”
Draco had expected the question days, if not weeks, ago but even so, his stomach clenches with embarrassment along with a faint hint of dread at the prospect of mentally reliving his past, however briefly. Potter almost seems to be holding his breath and for some reason, this eases the knot in Draco’s belly just a little.
“Potter, you bastard—” Malfoy’s long back dips inwards, a keening gasp sounding from where his head hangs between his shoulders when Harry pries his arse open and lays a firm lick up the crease with the flat of his tongue. “

,” Hermione sighs, “can we reserve the name-calling for another time? Malfoy,” she pats the table again, “if you please. You simply need to undo the buttons over your midriff; you are not required to strip completely.”
Instead Draco now
By the time Harry sinks into Draco, they’re both trembling violently. Draco is completely silent, arms tight around Harry’s shoulders, eyes shut as he pants quietly. When Harry leans in kisses each eyelid softly, Draco opens his eyes, dark and hungry, but still somehow serene – content.
Harry then made a little
“Merlin, you really are still an arse,” Malfoy says, picking up his tall glass of something clear and lemony, taking a long sip. Harry watches as his throat bobs when he swallows – and then he’s simply staring at Malfoy’s neck – the long, graceful length of it, the pale, unblemished skin. It’s that sort of neck that would only look prettier with half a dozen hickeys dotting it.
“Good for you. Congratulations in advance.”
“Pft, still no.”

Thoughts?
“We—We can’t save her, James.”

Then he heard a long, shuddering breath being drawn in. “You wish, Potter.”
, mate,
“Mr. Potter.” It was a sharp snap.
“Tastes so good,” Potter garbles at one point, wetly licking up Draco’s crease like a dog. “You’re so hot, Malfoy.”
“I want in,” Seamus says at once. “Fifty G’s on Ron.”
“Yeah, just waiting for my receipt.”
“Okay,” said James, wiping his eyes with the heels of his hands. Harry’s heart broke all over again at the innocent trust his children had in him.
“Yes, I was born a Veela,” he says quietly, looking away to somewhere over Hermione’s bushy head. “It skipped about six generations in my family and they thought the gene had died out but...apparently not.” Malfoy bites his lip, throwing Harry a swift, innocuous glance before flicking some imaginary lint off his robes.
They spin again, perfectly timed, and in that moment, they’re blissfully alone.
“Master Harry is not being Master Harry now,” the elf replies solemnly.
Until Harry, who’d stood there helplessly the whole time, suddenly stepped forward, curled a hand around Malfoy’s elbow and dragged him firmly away in the opposite direction, Ron still yelling after them.
“Potter, I’m focusing on casting a fucking Patronus,” Draco spits after seething in stunned fury for several seconds.
“Thanks a lot, Father,” Draco grumbles as he gives up and goes back to his own lunch. “I told you she wouldn’t eat if you give her chocolate so close to lunchtime.”
He’s still masticating like a cow, choking a bit every few seconds as he swallows, moist eyes fixed on the painted bowl of wildflowers placed at the centre of the table, when Potter leans in and closes one startlingly warm hand over Draco’s, which is still curled in a death grip around his fork. Cheeks bulging, lips gleaming with grease, Draco looks up, finally horrified at how he must probably look like a very blond chipmunk on the verge of violently barfing and then bursting into tears.
“What’s the bet?” Tristan asks and I clench my fists as I try really hard not to roll my eyes again – sorry, but the git has the most nasal whinny of a voice.

“Sure it is,” Malfoy says blithely, flapping a hand carelessly. “This is a huge responsibility you’re planning to take up, Potter.

Malfoy shifts a bit in his seat. “Around three days ago. I... I went to the self-help counter at the free clinic in Knockturn Alley.” He rifles around in the folds of his cloak and fishes out a crumpled piece of parchment that he hands to Hermione, who for an instant looks rather pained.

Draco rolls his eyes again, turning away as his face colours beet red. “Charming as ever,” he drawls, striding over to the stairs. “See you soon, Potter.”

curious though. Malfoy had mentioned having been on the run with Scorpius for three months now. Scorpius had mentioned his mother but she hadn’t made an appearance yet.
and then years later
“Why did you kiss me back if you don’t care about me or what I do?”
Ten minutes later, he’s still sat in the parlour, glaring out of the French windows as Lyra drools in his lap, when Narcissa glides in.
Another long pause. “I really don’t know
“That I’m no good at fancy shit, I get it.”
Harry grins, pursing his lips and narrowing his eyes as though keenly considering what Malfoy’d said. “
“Do you...
“Potter, I’m
Harry lay in bed, his hands under his head, Baguette pressed into his hip, warm and furry. He’d been lying there for over an hour, wide awake. He was tired – his body ached with fatigue – but he couldn’t fall asleep. He also couldn’t stop thinking about Malfoy.
“What just hap—?” Draco, still panting noisily, turns and leans most of his weight on the door, feet slipping forward as his legs nearly give away. Potter appears terrified as he gapes at Draco’s stomach and after a moment it hits Draco. “No, what I meant was—” Draco starts, throat rasping dryly as he pulls in lungfuls of air.
“Stay,” Potter says softly.
And then with a deep breath, Harry starts to move, soft, throaty grunts sounding from him as he snaps his hips back and forth, sweat sliding down his temples, face and neck flushed with strain from holding onto his climax.
“Malfoy,” Harry leaps up, wrapping a hand around Malfoy’s wrist and giving him a little shake, “Stop yelling. Sit your arse down and tell us what the hell is going on.”
Potter shrugs and pulls a face, pushing his face back into the crook of Draco’s neck. “Stop calling him ‘Dark Lord’,” he murmurs, lapping gently over Draco’s jugular. “He’s literally a wispy bag of bones buried under multiple wards somewhere off the North Sea; nothing dark about him anymore.”

Here’s where your Alpha magic will come in handy, Harry; I doubt you’ll even feel any of the strain that comes with sharing magic.” She ends the spell and walks back to her seat as the lights come back on. Draco holds his breath as Potter and he stare at each other a beat, gazes wide and somehow

“Yeah, listen, I needed to ask you something,” Erickson leans back in his chair, thick forearms resting on the armrests, one meaty, ham-like hand rubbing at his scraggly stubble. “I wanted to know if you—whether you’ve you know...
“Shit, Potter, I’m so sorry!” He’s got tears in his eyes as he holds my face with warm, long-fingered hands and I hope the tears are at least partially from the pain in his foot because otherwise I might feel more than inclined to stomp on it again.
“Why didn’t you stop me, then?!”
!” he says forcefully, with not a trace of shame or hesitation, his hand coming to rest on his stomach for the first time since they’d arrived, his robes folding in around the round bump. Narcissa lets out a small gasp, her hands flying up to cover her mouth and Lucius looks absolutely stupefied as he
Spurting out another pulse of come onto Potter, Draco sags against him, breathing heavily through his mouth, his lower back now throbbing. “Fuck,” he whimpers weakly when Potter drags his fingers all the way to the tips before scissoring wide just inside the rim.

Harry nods, gaze fixed on Malfoy’s pink mouth. “Yeah, those sound great. Anything else you can think of?”
you’re using to cast the Patronus.” Eyes narrowing thoughtfully, he adds, “What memory have you been using, Malfoy?”
Turning his head slightly to be able to wrap his lips around the head, Harry sucked it into his mouth with a noisy slurp, salty-sweet precome spreading over his tongue as Malfoy’s hips lifted off the bed and his hoarse gasp rustled over Harry’s skin, making the hairs on his arms stand up.
“It’s for the baby,” Weasley says loudly and unnecessarily.
He knows he’s never going to be able to willingly pull himself out of Harry’s arms.

was flying too.
He’s still unkempt and barefooted, his hair in a knotted mess around his head, stubble having thickened into a light beard, but he now looks rested, like he’s had a few good nights’ sleep and a meal or two.
“Shit, do you realise how pathetic your social life is, mate?”
“Oh, because

“Beyond uncouth,” Draco declares heatedly. “I don’t even have
I sigh, massaging the nape of my neck with the tips of my fingers, Draco’s smile, his open laughter, his half-lidded, glazed eyes and pink, parted lips dancing behind my eyelids. Then I just say it. “I’m scared I won’t be good enough for him.”
I’m tiddly myself and those words, perfectly innocent by themselves, make me choke a bit on my own saliva as I find the double meaning in them.
Potter gives him a little grin. “I won’t spontaneously turn into a wolf and kill anyone if I miss a dose, Malfoy.”
Potter enquiring as to whether Draco is all right. He doesn’t want Potter to willingly sink to his knees, suck Draco off and then hold steady so that Draco can come all over his face.
“Potter,” Draco moans before sucking Potter’s thumb into his mouth, slurping loudly around it as Potter fondles his throbbing cock, slipping the foreskin all the way down before squeezing under the head. Draco scrabbles wildly, rutting into his fist and letting his eyes fall shut, still sucking on Potter’s thumb until he growls and yanks Draco into another kiss, wild and fervent.
you. It—it really does mean a lot, Malfoy.” Harry stares rather desperately into Malfoy’s lovely face, grey eyes soft and, for once, unshuttered, rosy mouth curved in a gentle, friendly smile. It’s only when he slowly closes a hand over Harry’s that Harry realises he’s touching Malfoy’s belly again.
And he’s dressed in nothing but joggers.
“I don’t regret what happened,” he says at once, quiet and firm, turning around with his hands on his hips. “I’ve been dying to touch you for

Draco scoffs loudly.
I’ve left my wand somewhere on the sofa and so I snap my hand to wandlessly block his Stinging Hex, staring at him in shock. He follows with one more, which I dodge, approaching him as I do. He throws out a third one which flies over my shoulder as I finally reach him, snatch his wand from his grip and fling it, with all my might, across my flat. I hear it clatter to the floor somewhere in the kitchen.
“I did.”

can claim being a werewolf is not a big deal and get away with it, Potter,” Draco studies his fingernails with an air of exaggerated nonchalance before glancing up at Potter who’s grinning rather exasperatedly at him, “The Werewolf Who Cries When He Drinks His Medicine,” Draco adds with a smirk that’s more jocose than anything else.
“I need to sink down there to get my mouth on his bits, darling,” she replies calmly, her many rings glinting in the strobe lights as she lifts her martini to her glossy siren-red mouth and sips delicately.
“You little shit!” Draco yelled, stomping forward.
“Have you slept with anyone at all since th--?”
“Because
Ron scrambled into attention; sitting up with his spine stiff, blue eyes popping, mouth twitching on the very verge of a grin. Hermione looked up very slowly, a slight pink tinge appearing on her cheeks as she put her quill down and laced her fingers together in a rather businesslike fashion.
He led the children inside and shut the door behind them. The kitchen looked just as they had left it – two half-eaten bananas and a little bowl of Froot Loops on the table. The drapes were still drawn shut. Harry remembered the terror in his neighbour’s eyes from the night before.
“Won’t they be back? They know there are people here now.”
,” Harry pulls back and says seriously, dark gaze sweeping over Malfoy’s flushed cheeks and wet mouth, his pupils round and black within the pale grey irises. “And I haven’t snogged you yet.”
What the fuck?
“’s a good story, though,” Harry chuckles, “You should tell it to people tomorrow.”
“I swear to
“Then stop going there,” she tells him, not looking the least bit sympathetic. “You only go there because the mirrors are bigger.”
When he lets Malfoy’s sticky, half-hard cock slip out of his mouth and looks up at him, he finds him heaving for air in a flushed, sweaty sprawl, limbs askew and hair spread out across his pillow in an exotic mess. Harry leans forward and presses an achingly gentle kiss to the lower curve of Malfoy’s belly and Malfoy looks down, winding careful fingers through his hair again, expression slightly dazed as Harry presses a more kisses up the dark line that runs up the middle of his bump.
“Oh.” Harry heard quick breathing. “Yeah, you were saying you’d...”
with it, Malfoy.”
Harry laughs quietly as Malfoy sighs once more and tucks himself into Harry’s side, his breathing evening out in seconds to the deep, steady pulls of sleep.
“Draco is pregnant,” Harry says plainly, shocking himself even as he speaks. Malfoy’s neck clicks with how fast he turns to glare at him with his teeth bared and his eyes bugging out much like his father’s had a minute ago.
haven’t asked for a single thing from you.”
!” The moment he says it, Draco feels his neck prickle with embarrassment.
This time, their kiss is downright feral, Harry emitting sounds that are part-growls and part-whimpers, but his hands staying on the pillow all through it. When Draco pulls away, Harry makes a sharp, hungry sound that has Draco shushing him gently, their lips still brushing lightly together.
I snort. “Right.” I don’t say anything for a few seconds during which Ron fidgets with the drawstrings of his pyjamas and Hermione’s gaze fixed on me never wavers.  “I would try,” I finally say quietly. “I would try to make it work.” I don’t tell them how it genuinely feels as if I’ll never get a chance to.
. Now, can you confirm whether this piece of shit was
Silently unravelling, mind and soul, Draco breathes in and out, deep and deliberately, forcing himself to maintain eye contact until he’s able to think through the hoarse roaring in his head. Potter gazes back at him, blinking slowly, and Draco is suddenly hyperaware of the way their thighs press together, warm and firm.
It was a long, wide room, completely bare. More torches burned at intervals along the walls and as Harry watched, Malfoy stood at one of the arched windows in the walls, wand raised and muttering warding spells.
“Yes, well, I’ll be going now,” Draco babbles, placing the case on the polished, mahogany console he’s standing next to. “I’ll see you next month, Potter.”

“I thought you went to bed,” Potter says.
Draco reaches down and starts to stroke himself. “Not really, no,” he confesses, pointing his cock at Potter as he eases the sopping wet foreskin off the sticky head. Potter licks his lips, exhaling in a shudder as he watches Draco’s hand, eyes wide and staring like an owl’s. “But it gets me really fucking hot when you go off on me with that filthy mouth of yours –
“It’s never bothered you before.”
you to know if I’ve bent over and let some other guy I ran into at some club fuck me until he’s filling me up wi—” Malfoy’s crude little rant is abruptly cut off as Harry lunges forward and knots a hand in his hair, fist closing over the small, stiff little ponytail at his nape.
We have been for nearly seven years now, ever since that cringe-worthy failed attempt at a hook-up in that wardrobe (something we’ve vowed never to bring up), and I complain about his continued presence in my life almost as vehemently as I’m secretly thankful for it.
“What’s going on?” Draco presses.
“Moved
“Any of those things you said about me,” Draco cuts in. “Those things you said about
Malfoy nodded feverishly. “Oh god, yes, fine!” He parted his legs under Harry, wide enough that they hung off the bed. “Do it. Just
“Just saying, mate.”
He wanted to reach out and grip Malfoy’s shoulder to show solidarity because that just seemed like the normal thing to do. But Malfoy just seemed so...untouchable. Like even when only two feet away, he was somehow out of reach.

So now, nearly two hours later, Draco was practically bursting with the need to just

“Yes, a therapist for PTSD after each time I talk to you.”
But then Potter is releasing him and that look has vanished, leaving behind a serene sort of friendliness. Draco’s hand falls limply to his side and Potter smiles at him. “Thank you,” he repeats.
“Well, yes,” Harry turns to her impatiently, “but you said the paternity test is just a matter of an additional spell, right? And can you please, for the love of fuck, stop calling it ‘foetus’? It’s a
Malfoy howls and I hurriedly clamp one hand over his mouth with a frantically whispered, “Shit, I’m sorry, I’m sorry, I’m sorry!”
“Oh, you know,” he says with forced airiness, shakily twisting the cap off his butterbeer. “Growing in every direction and waddling around on feet that won’t fit into any of the shoes I own anymore.” Granger laughs merrily and Draco finds himself grinning back despite everything. “I’m doing okay,” he adds with a shrug, drinking some of the creamy beer and licking it off his lips, heart still jumping in his chest.
“You have a
“No.” Then he added, “Not right away.”
It feels incredible. Potter sucks cock like a proper slut and Draco wants to stay inside the wet warmth of his mouth forever. It feels like an incredibly lavish indulgence – the Saviour himself sucking Draco’s cock as if he’d rather die than be doing anything else except kneeling in a dirty alley with Draco’s cock going deeper and deeper into his throat with every bob of his chaotic, raven head.
Malfoy snorted. “It was a decent attempt, Potter.”
Draco’s just about to lift Scorpius’ head off his lap and go investigate when Narcissa carefully takes Lyra from Harry, arranging her head carefully on her shoulder and checking that she’s still asleep. When she walks over and blows a kiss at Scorpius, Draco gives in to his curiosity.
“You going to come for me?” Harry murmured, thumbs tracing Draco’s hipbones as he dipped down to run the flat of his tongue over the length of one of the scars across Draco’s chest. His cock was pressed ruthlessly against Draco’s prostate and when Harry shifted his head to bite down over one tight, pink nipple, Draco shuddered all over, crying out helplessly.

self-satisfied.
“Shit, Malfoy, I’m glad you called back. Listen, I’m really sorry about earlier, I didn’t mean to embarrass you or anything, alright?”
“I might not be a very good student,” Draco blurts hurriedly, resisting the impulse to reach out and grab Potter by the arm. “We’ll likely lose patience and end up flinging hexes, Potter.”

Clearing his throat, Harry raises his fist and knocks on the door to his left, holding his breath, one hand closing around his wand in his coat pocket.
, initially misreading ‘Malfoy’ as ‘Maltoy’.
But he hasn’t yet seen Potter’s cock, no. He’s felt it against him though – against his stomach, his hip, his thigh, his own cock, rubbing and grinding and rutting until they’re both groaning with need. But he hasn’t
“More,” Draco pants, sharply slapping one hand down onto Potter’s flexing bum and dragging him closer. “More!
I try again, and this time, make more of an attempt to sound convincing. “I just – I’ve only just met him, yeah? I’ll be okay once I get to know the bloke somewhat.”
Harry’s sharp, choked cry is more grateful than aroused and Draco’s heart swells when Harry still doesn’t move his hands down to guide Draco’s head. Easing the stretched foreskin all the way down with one hand, Draco sucks lovingly at the head, briefly thumbing the slit open wider before licking into it, humming into the saline burst across his tongue. Working the tip along the insides of his lips a few times, Draco finally lets the bulbous, slippery head slide down his tongue, and then lower, pinning Harry’s body to the bed as he squeezes it with his throat, swallowing deliberately around it.
“You had no right!” Malfoy howls, slamming a fist on her desk, causing her to jump in her seat.
Potter doesn’t comment and simply continues flipping through the pages, quietly letting Draco in on the only existing memories of his family. When he gets to a photo of James and Lily Potter, a tiny, rotund baby with wispy black hair and vivid green eyes, sat on Lily’s hip waving fat little fists at the camera, Draco lets out a slightly strangled sound of wicked delight and drags the album closer.
“Get them off,” Malfoy repeated, his voice sounding slightly nasal from talking with his head thrown back. As Harry watched he wriggled around until he was pulling his shirt off, dragging it off his arm roughly. “Potter, get them the
That by itself is sufficient to make Harry release his mouth and drop his forehead onto Malfoy’s shoulder, letting out a rough sound that comes out as more of a sob. Malfoy swivels his hips, repeating the firm grind into Harry’s cock and Harry
Lucius snorts and holds out his hand for an excitedly wiggling Scorpius to take, leading him over to the Floo. Narcissa bends to press a kiss to Draco’s temple before darting another
drunk. I already know it.
Harry turned, already running. Ginny was on the floor, backing away, sliding backwards on her bum, her wand falling out of her hand as Harry watched. James pounced after it. Albus was howling, mouth open and drooling as he sobbed, clinging to the curtains.
The contrast between the clean, homey warmth of this room and the dingy, dank hallway he’d just come from is startlingly stark, and it throws Draco a little as he stands there blankly, turning around on the spot and blinking around the room. He feels a little lost and a lot stupid, not to mention nervous and suddenly, quite out of nowhere, scared.

“Is it that the
It was the sight of the remaining two students aiming relentless kicks into Malfoy’s sides, probably still tender from last time, and the sound of Malfoy’s pained, stifled grunts, that made Harry take three long strides forward, and Stun the whole trio with a single, wordless spell.
“Not everybody knows ancient magic, Potter,” said Malfoy, dripping with self-satisfied superiority.
And then Tristan pulls Draco closer with an arm around his waist, leans down and kisses him slowly, deeply – the kind of kiss you share with someone you’re comfortable and familiar with; the kind of kiss that hinted strongly at what they might get up to once they’re alone later in the night.

“Ron can take care of himself,” Potter chuckles. “It’s not like he’s the kind who’ll shut up either.”
“Father, it’s
“Oh.” Potter fidgets with a hole in his horrible, clichéd Gryffindor t-shirt, staring down at the book Draco had bought himself on the way back from his first appointment with Granger. The baby on the cover has a perfectly round head and looks incredibly happy as it beams toothlessly and Draco honestly doesn’t know whether reading about sensitive nipples, swollen feet and the eventual increase in flatulence is helping him wise up about the pregnancy or simply fuelling actual nightmares.
“Damn it,” Draco breathes, pushing his hands into Harry’s knotted mane, finding more oatmeal there, “I knew I should’ve refused.”
Malfoy was still standing where he’d been and so Harry simply trudged on. The farther he walked, and the longer his solitude persisted, the stronger the mental images of Ginny’s limp form became. Vision blurring again, Harry blindly walked towards nowhere, tears dripping off his chin, ankle throbbing, mind whirring.
Fucking Malfoy.
His cock is given a slow, feathery little lick, Harry’s tongue tantalising up the vein underneath the long, pink length, before his lips descend around the damp head, enveloping it in that tight heat, Draco’s hips once again lifting, this time in time with Harry’s slow, lengthy suck.
Albus gasped and James grinned proudly. Malfoy was shaking his head again, smirk still in place.
Because Draco is not about to let himself hope, to daydream about the possibilities – to open himself up to heartbreak.
“Potter,” whispers Draco, moving his feet just in time when Harry guides them in a slow circle.
“How is it weird? This is Malfoy we’re talking about.” I realise it sounds absurd the second I say it – Malfoy hasn’t been viewed as ‘Malfoy’ in a long, long time now.
what to do.
When Harry looks back around, Malfoy is lying down, the pale stretch of his belly visible under Hermione’s elbow as she waves her wand in circles. Malfoy has got his hands clasped over his chest and is staring determinedly at the ceiling, his face and demeanour anxious and oddly soft now, from where Harry watches.
his mouth until they were both scarlet in the face and gasping for breath at which point Draco had made a quick, completely dazed escape so he could Apparate home, get in the bath and stare at his little rubber dragon for half an hour while wondering if Potter had tasted his own come on Draco’s tongue.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Come again?” Seamus prompts, Dean thumping Ron on the back as the latter coughs violently.
It’s right bloody there. I can see it; I spotted it from dozens of feet away.
This time when he reached out to shove at Harry again, Harry ended up grabbing him right back, clutching handfuls of his blood soaked collar and shaking him. “Stop it, Malfoy! What is
“How are you?” Granger asks softly several minutes later, and Draco jerks slightly, hurriedly closing his mouth where it had been sagging open, licking dry lips and breathing deeply to collect himself, the fairy lights and Potter in his stark black robes still dancing behind his eyes. Granger, however, seems more than willing to let the topic of his birthday go by without further comment and Draco is absurdly grateful.
“I was just being polite,” Harry says calmly. “You’re welcome to pay for yourself.”
“I thought I asked you to fuck off, Potter?” Malfoy snapped. “Why exactly are you still here?”
“Can we—
“Sleep it off, darling,” Granger says. “You’re alright.”
Harry let out a mirthless chuckle of exasperation. “It’s pointless trying to argue with you. I should’ve known before I offered. Never mind, then.”

“Well, of course I fucked him,” Harry replies blandly, pulling the day’s load of paperwork towards himself with a sigh. “Sort of the whole point, wasn’t it?”
The hospital wing was dark and pleasantly cool and most of the beds seemed empty except for the one beside Harry’s own, its curtains firmly shut all around. Sleep took over effortlessly and Harry sighed again as he let it, blinkingly slowly as he watched the blurred form of Madam Pomfrey bustle over to his neighbour’s bed from the other side. He heard the rustle of the curtains being drawn aside and then Pomfrey spoke softly.
Malfoy didn’t take up the challenge Harry threw at him, strapping on his sword in silence instead with his eyes on Harry the whole time. “All right,” he said at last.
“Get the fuck off me,” Draco hisses instead, twisting his wrists in Potter’s grip, bucking his hips uselessly in an attempt to throw him off.

I can’t help it; I smile back. “Sorry for just standing there holding it like a dunderhead.”
Half an hour later, Harry was standing in the middle of his kitchen and yelling at Baguette.
He watched as Harry eased himself back in and did up his fly, leaving his shirt un-tucked. Draco made another sound of disapproval as, to add to his general unkempt appearance, Harry raised both hands and gave his hair a vigorous, completely unnecessary ruffle.
“Ever heard of a Summoning charm?”
“I didn’t accept Theo’s proposal. We—we broke up.”
Harry laughs, cheeks still pink. “That’s fucking ridiculous,” he says, grinning. “Because while I’m a fucking
He’d known their first time would be significant, would feel meaningful, and when Harry lays him down on the edge of his bed and finally breaks the kiss, Draco knows with one look at Harry, with not a single spoken word exchanged, that

“Mhmm,” she hums serenely, sipping delicately on her wine, watching the breakfast cereal commercial playing on the TV.
“He’s
who did the breaking up?”
He can see Potter’s come dripping out of his hole before his tongue, in a flash of vivid pink, swipes it up, Potter pushing it into the sloppy hole without bothering to pretend that he’s utilising any particular technique or skill. His rim flutters and clenches and Draco fucks that tongue as he comes all over himself, holding Potter’s head firmly in place so he can eat Draco right through it, tongue and teeth and lips not ceasing to work his arse further open until Draco groans and pushes him away instead.
“Fuck.”

“Why is that funny?” Potter demands grumpily. “It’s
is my room?” Malfoy asks, voice no louder than a whisper, disbelief laced with uncertainty. He takes everything in with wide eyes as he walks in, running long fingers over the high, glossy vanity, poking at the bowl of chocolates. “Potter, I—I don’t...require all this space,” he says weakly, tracing the carved patterns on the gigantic, ceiling-to-floor length wardrobe.
Determined in his plans, Draco soaked for over an hour, gradually cooling off while also sulking about his ruined robes. That fucking ferret and its fucking nest full of Draco’s fancy things. It was all Weasley’s fault. No, wait—it was all
Draco laughs quietly. “The whole damn castle smells like Christmas, Potter,” he says, one hand running through Harry’s hair the way they both liked, dextrous fingers gently combing out the tangles. Harry makes a low, gurgling sound and burrows deeper into him. Then, slightly wryly, “Don’t think I’m not onto your pet ginger and his bushy girlfriend, Potter. I know they’ve only stayed back here to make sure I don’t drown you in the eggnog or something.”
. Fuck yourself with it maybe?”
She sighs. “Because you men think other men don’t take offence to the same things women do.”
“I want to,” I say quickly. Merlin, I want to so,
But the swooping joy that Draco had felt when that gleaming cloud had burst out his wand had dissipated right along with it. “Don’t patronise me, Potter,” he says quietly, temper suddenly flaring.
Desperately, Harry tries to elbow his way through the semicircular throng of people who have pinned him to the entrance of Flourish and Blotts.
I furtively gaze at Draco, wondering if we’ll ever be engaged some day. I swallow, my mouth dry, as I realise just how brilliant that sounds. It’s unbelievable how much I want to be with Draco, how much I think of him when he’s not around, how difficult it’s become to look away from him when he
“You’re almost at ten weeks and this is around the time that the foetus starts rapidly developing,” Granger tells them, voice quiet and unobtrusive. “The vital organs have started to grow and function, and although you can’t see it,” she points out the miniscule fingers and toes, “even the nails have started to form.”
“What, like, you don’t think he’s fit or something?” Ron asks, still looking incredibly shocked. “How can

at Harry.
Draco promptly loses his grip on their cocks,
If anyone could make servitude appear smug, it’s Harry Potter. Draco can’t even bring himself to resent him for it, though.
“What do you think?” Harry deadpans, grinding his still-hard cock against him. “We’ll pick up some roses on the way if you like. You can shred them up and toss them all over the place while I eat you out and fuck you again.”
Harry watched in perplexed amusement as the boy dug around in his pocket and pulled out a rumpled handkerchief, dabbing his eyes primly.
It pisses me off.

Harry looked at him, and then raised his wand. “
His eyebrows shoot up, disappearing under his fringe, and his nostrils flare in irritation. “I’m not going to stand here and enable your innate obnoxiousness, Potter.” His lip curls into that ugly sneer and for a moment, it’s easy enough to remember that he’s Draco
“NO! EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
“Hey,” Potter puffs, scrambling upright and pulling himself closer to Draco. “You okay?”
Potter slowly slides an arm around Draco’s waist, looking as terrified as Draco suddenly feels. Their chests bump together and Draco feels the breath leave his lungs.
Harry promptly stops grinding, slumping forward with a groan. “What do you think, Ron?”
“I can tell you miss him, y’know,” Ron says wisely. I don’t respond. “Especially because you’re like...y’know? In love with him?”
Potter’s own full head of hair is right there and his left hand is still on Draco’s hip and his eyes are shut as he smells Draco’s hair and Draco is so painfully hard that he’s on the very verge of actual tears. So it’s not something he’s able to stop himself doing when he yanks Potter’s head up and crashes their mouth together, flinging his arms around his shoulders.
“What; this is something that you ought to be shouting from the rooftops, Potter,” Malfoy says, a tad impatiently. “You don’t hide something like that. So, how good are you anyway?”
“Beg pardon?” But Malfoy only shook his head. Harry snorted and took a gulp of beer. “Have you even tried any?”
forget even if they tried. Your name is synonymous with the peace and security our world is currently thriving in, Potter. There’s a reason every generation henceforth will learn about you, study you, and all your foolishly heroic acts.” When Harry snorts and looks at him, Malfoy is smiling a crooked but genuinely warm smile at him. “It’s be
“You’re lying,” Draco said weakly, suddenly shivering from head to foot like he’d been out in a snow storm without any clothes on. At this, Harry looked so outraged that Draco hurriedly babbled, “If you’re serious, I mean if you really want to then yes, I will, but if you’re playing a trick on me to embarrass me and make me think that you’re—” Draco broke off and stumbled back a step because Harry got to his feet and took one bold step towards him.
Granger never looks away and it’s Draco who finally breaks eye contact, his heart racing and his head filled with some kind of hoarse hollering.
Potter scowled. “Do I resemble the fucking barkeep?” he asked, pushing his stupid glasses up his nose.
Octavia delighted smirk is completely evil. “Oh, you really
“Did he make a fool of himself when he first saw you or is he one of those who have more control over themselves?”
“Do you want to buy a fucking torch or not?”
Draco loved them all. He could spend hours running his fingers over each outline and silhouette, every patch of colour, every graceful curve and curl of ink. They all looked beautiful on the background of Harry’s tanned skin, each one telling its own story. When they indulged in leisurely sessions of lovemaking Draco always found himself pressing soft fingertips and softer lips over each one, watching Harry’s muscles jump and shift under his touches.
“Stop saying fuck in front of the baby,” he says at once, scratching his toned stomach with his thumb without looking up from the book.
,” he says dryly, leaning down and pecking her cheek quickly. “I’ll be fine. Not my first full moon,” he adds over his shoulder with a smile as they start walking in opposite directions.
Malfoy emits a squeak of surprise, shoving futilely at Harry before suddenly letting his mouth move along with his. When Harry pulls back, he stares at Harry with a mixture of impatient confusion and curiosity.
just because of the baby either.” Leaning forward a bit, Potter lifts his hand off Draco’s knee to take one of his hands instead.
They end up finding a perfect two-bedroom flat in less than two weeks and by the end of the month, they’ve moved in. The reporters who’ve caught a whiff of it go wild, their articles speculating everything from a hurried engagement to a spur-of-the-moment private marriage ceremony in the Bahamas.
why I did it,” I repeat. Draco doesn’t respond, now just looking at me with both eyebrows raised, his expression openly challenging. I swallow hard, gritting my teeth. “You’re gonna make me say it, aren’t you? Right here in front of everybody we know.” Draco lifts his chin, nose in the air, mouth set in a stubborn line. “Sometimes,” I say, “I honestly can’t believe that I am as helplessly in love with you as I am,
“He’s got all sorts of shit back there,” laughed Harry, turning to peer behind the fridge again. “Oh my god,
I’m so fucking uncomfortable as I look down at my new formal shirt. “New, yes. Do you like it?” I ask smiling too widely.
“Who even knew one can fit a whole—”
When Harry had finally turned around and come over with two plates loaded with sausages and eggs, the sunlight had caught on something unfamiliar on Harry’s chest. Draco frowned, leaning forward and grabbing Harry’s arm and pulling him around the table until he was standing next to Draco.
have accepted them.”
– instead moving his right heel in sinuous circles over Potter’s crotch, biting his lip as Potter squirms involuntarily, barely even acknowledging his stirring cock.
I was in there, but that doesn’t mean I have any actual control over the bloody
Wordlessly, Draco kneels and starts unlacing Harry’s heavy, dirty boots; there are splotches off blood on them as well and Draco presses his lips tightly together, trying not to acknowledge the queasiness rising in him. Throwing the boots under the coffee table, he peels the stained, sweaty socks off, briefly squeezing Harry’s large, square feet with both hands before he feels one sturdy, grimy hand gentle over his hair.
“Serves me right for not noticing,” I say savagely.
Scoffing, “I see. Because you would? Risk it for me, I mean?”
It was properly dark inside the hall even though it wasn’t very late. The rain never stopped pouring and after a while the children began to get restless. Scorpius had his father dig out a book from their trunk, and Albus and he sat and pored over it. Lily ran clumsily around the room, trying to catch the shimmering bubbles that Harry conjured for her entertainment. Malfoy sat in silence and wiped his sword clean, over and over again.
He grins, his gaze wandering to my mouth as he clasps his fingers at the nape of my neck. “Maybe,” he says again.
Tearing his pants off, Harry licks a hard kiss to the inside of Malfoy’s thigh as he hooks it over his shoulder and straddles his other thigh on the bed, holding his cock tightly and walking forward on his knees until he can line up against his gleaming wet, furiously winking arsehole, his mouth watering at the sight. Pushing the tip in, Harry inches forward until the head is seated inside the rim; then he’s shuddering and reaching frantically for control because Malfoy’s insides
Draco grins slowly to himself, his own cheeks slightly pink. “That’s not a technique,” he says, perusing his own menu. “That’s just base, human reaction to...above average...attractiveness.”
“And they believed you?” Draco’s asked scathingly.
Draco snorts. “Right,” he says nastily. “Mind telling me why you bolted out of here like were possessed? Right after we’d...done that, no less,” Draco spits, barely mindful of the heat flooding his face. “You can’t fucking
“Then why d’you do it?”
“It’s dung, mate,” Ron lifts his pint to him.
“What are you doing here?” Draco asks tightly.
I just stand rooted in place and all I can feel is a sense of complete defeat. The look on Draco’s face is still hovering before me – astonished, hurt and betrayed, before the resignation had taken over right before he’d left. Like he couldn’t believe, at first, that I’d think that way about him, and then as if he’d realised that of
“You heard me,” Draco turns back around with his drink, leaning back once more, his hip against my thigh.
With the weak selfishness of those immersed in grief, Harry wondered if she too had been left an empty shell.
the wicked smirk in his voice. “Oh, Arthur would be so
“I apologise,” he said again. “I don’t mean to embarrass you.”
“Malfoy, fuck,
. A few days after I broke up with him, I’d learned (after a hysterically shouted firecall from Simon) that someone had cursed his mail so that it exploded in his hands and caused pus filled boils to erupt all over his face and neck. He’d spent a week in Mungo’s.
“I want what you want!”
But Harry, jaw set stubbornly, just looks away, leaning back in his seat and crossing his arms. Draco gets up, throws his napkin onto his hardly touched plate and storms out, taking the stairs two at a time as he makes his way back up into that dank, smelly corridor, turning towards the front door only to belatedly remember that he’s left his briefcase and cloak up in the living room.
“You couldn’t
“I thought we decided it was for the best,” he says slowly after a long beat.
Hermione frowned thoughtfully; Ron was wheezing hoarsely like he’d just been chased across the grounds by Aragog and his whole family, his eyes wide and sort of unseeing, his mouth open and slack.
– so close that he’s practically in his
“Don’t you have any work to do?!” Draco asks irritably. “Where are the files I asked you to pull out of the archives for me?”
Harry grins, tugging his sweaty, mud stained t-shirt off and mopping his face with it. “I think it’s just a general consensus among them that witches have wrinkly, green skin and are fatally averse to water.”
Malfoy breathes steadily, the pause stretching on and on before he says, “Another couple of drinks, and I think I will be.”
“Oh, that old man had issues,” Draco dismisses, cleaving out large slices. “He’d cursed it so only his daughter could open it. And
He was also not a believer in the artful concealment of one’s true feelings and intentions. The way he spoke to, looked at, touched and kissed Draco left absolutely no doubt in his mind about how Harry felt about him – and frankly speaking, that as well as the realisation that he himself likely felt the same way about Harry in return terrified Draco like few other things did.
“Doesn’t stop you any from fucking it as often as you do,” Draco murmurs, leaning down and pressing moist, open-mouthed kisses up the inside of one thigh, Potter’s legs immediately falling open. “Don’t try to convince me that you don’t just
Draco stares as Potter trails off, looking slightly sheepish but still mostly determined as he looks around Draco’s room once as if to draw some confidence out of the walls. “Okay,” Draco says.
“Merlin, you’re annoying,” Potter says laughingly, grabbing Draco’s wrist and hauling him close.
And then Malfoy sagged into him, completely collapsing and letting every last ounce of his weight rest on Harry. His arms fell limply next to them and Harry’s cock fell sadly out of him, sticky with his own come. Malfoy panted roughly, quivering atop Harry for several more seconds before he finally slid off Harry with a low groan, throwing himself beside him so they both lay side-by-side, squashed uncomfortably into each other.
. I can’t imagine what life was like before Draco. That’s how I see life now: Before Draco and After Draco.
The nearest one was six feet away.
“We sell
Malfoy wanted Harry to fuck him.
The dementors, as one, began to glide away, back out the kitchen door, the one carrying Lily bringing up the rear, Lily’s body flailing weakly as she tried to wriggle free.
He’s barely done swallowing before I’ve crossed the space between us, wound an arm around his waist, my other hand landing on his hot cheek, and kissed him. I hear the tinkle of breaking glass as he drops the flute, and then his arms are around my neck and he’s kissing me right back, tilting his head and pushing into me with his whole body. There’s a crazed sort of rushing sound in my ears but I am aware of the hoots, the screams, and the applause around us. I
bum as he grabs two handfuls of the taut, supple flesh and
“Yeah?”
“With a bloke,” Harry added. Ron’s hands scrabbled through the mess of books and parchments on their table as he made a dramatic grab for the edge, looking very much like he was about to faint, vomit and laugh for a week all at once. Hermione’s eyebrows disappeared under her fringe and she pursed her lips up very tightly.
“Potter,” he waggles a finger, still clamped around the files, in the vague direction of his specs, “if you’d be so kind?” Carefully remaining seated, Harry waves a hand, levitating the delicate spectacles onto the top of the pile Malfoy holds. He receives a tiny, businesslike smile for it. “Much obliged. Aren’t you supposed to be indisposed and on leave?” he asks Harry, head tilting slightly so some more of his neatly combed fringe slides further onto his face.
From outside he heard the soft gasps of Albus and Lily and knew they felt the swooping sensation of the spell. But no other human being revealed themselves.
going to tell them?” Draco asks at once, crossing his arms.
Malfoy had looked every bit like the dream Harry was sure he was in the middle of. Pointy as ever,
It’s just sex, Draco thought, lifting his hips and letting Potter tug his jeans and pants off in one messy bundle. It’s just a drunken shag, he told himself as he let Potter press his knees back onto his chest. This is where Potter belongs, he mused: between Draco’s legs with his tongue up Draco’s arse.
” Malfoy chortled for a few seconds before asking, “11AM, you said?”
!” Harry gestures wildly across the field. “Just cast a Cushioning Charm and sit comfortably, for heaven’s sake. I’ll be done in about half an hour and then we can go home.” He stands up and stomps down the stands, shaking his head vigorously to throw off the familiar, restless buzzing that fills it.
Potter either ignores, or doesn’t seem to notice, any of that. “Thank you,” he says softly, almost in a whisper, looking at Draco with wide, shiny eyes, expression tender and almost disbelieving. “That...means a lot Ma—Draco. Thank you.”
“The Yule Ball,” Malfoy says, grinning as he nods. “Don’t cherish the memories of that one, then?”
knows the answer but can’t be sure but also has a good idea as to what I’m feeling and just wants me to say it out loud and be done with it.
I’ve remained surprised about this. I’d always imagined Draco to be loud and very vocal about his pleasure. This quietness that he practices makes me want to wrench sounds out of him.
that’s currently residing inside him and isn’t just a grey shape on the wall of Granger’s office.
going to brew--?”
“Wardour Castle.” When Harry didn’t reply, he added, “We’re back in Wiltshire.”
“A room to practice in,” Potter answers as though obvious. “Shall we?” He strides over and pushes open the door, sticking his head in and looking around before shooting Draco a grin over his shoulder. “Come on, then.”
“Yeah, I mean--” Potter swallows hard, one hand jumping up to his hair; he has a shiny spot of grease on his forearm as well. “I could, you know—Kreacher could...make us dinner. I mean, he’ll make
They’ve danced before, pressed up close and sharing the same space. They’ve been close before, hands tight on each other. Harry knows what Malfoy smells like by now, what his sweat smells like, what his breath smells like after a few drinks.
There’s the faint, rattling breath of something inhuman echoing around the room when he crawls back into consciousness, a feeble croak sounding every now and then. He’s way too hot, his skin feeling scalded, and his insides feel wrung out. He’s shaking against something very warm and pliant, his cock compressed in gripping, wet heat that further tightens around him every few seconds. His whole being feels wrecked, as though he’d gone out into a hurricane unprotected, got violently thrown about, and has to now pick himself back up even as the storm still lingers, looming right over him.
Suspicion immediately intensifying, Malfoy tilts his head back to peer at Harry down his sharp nose. “About?”
“Well, I’ll tell you what,” Potter says matter-of-factly, eyes twinkling, “When you’re stinking rich again someday—”
to try one,” he says feverishly, licking chocolate off the corners of his mouth.
Draco’s gaze on me is white hot. I can feel disbelief, disgust and most of all, betrayal.
for a possible tumour or foetus?
Draco’s belly at this appointment after silently seeking permission with an entreating tilt of his head to which Draco had responded with a single nod. Potter’s large, slightly rough hand had rested warmly on Draco’s stomach, just to the side of his navel, and they’d, along with Granger, watched as the baby had responded to the touch nearly instantly with a surprisingly strong kick, prompting Potter to yelp and pull back his hand as though bitten, Draco trying to glare at him through their shared, exhilarated laughter as he’d rubbed the spot on his belly where he’d felt it.
Granger sighs, exchanging a fleeting look with Weasley, who looks just as disappointed.
“Come now,” said Malfoy, brisk but kind. “Harry Potter? Defeated by dementors? Not possible.”

for one evening.
Potter snorts again, and then he’s laughing right in Draco’s face. “
“What have you been craving?” he asks Draco, who rolls his eyes.
Harry bit on his lip to hide his grin and nodded. “Well, for what it’s worth, I think your mother is absolutely right.” His eyes slid over to Malfoy again; after a brief moment of guilt, he said, “So, will she be joining you and your father soon?”
Draco had only just finished his course on medicinal potions and had been applying for jobs at apothecaries before Harry, newly appointed Junior Auror himself, suggested he apply at Mungo’s too. Draco had been extremely doubtful of his chances there considering his background and when he’d received the owl telling him he’d been appointed as assistant brewer to the head potioneer at Mungo’s, it took every bit of self-control not to violently confront Harry about whether he’d had anything to do with it.
“You don’t have to explain,” Draco insists.
Draco simply nods, licking his lips and spreading his legs as Potter reaches down and prods at his arsehole, slicking up the tight furl thoroughly before he starts edging a finger in. And as he slips in the first finger, Potter chooses to look up, gaze burning into Draco’s as he works his finger in and out, and just
‘we’, Albus.”
“Because you’ve warded your Floo, you arse.” I take in the sight of him in his stupid poncy black dressing gown with some sort of bright blue gunk all over his face and burst into a loud hoot of laughter. “Did a Crumple Horned Snorkack shit on your face?”
“Harry.” Her voice is so soft that it’s barely heard over the television. Ron promptly turns it off, the idiot. “It’s alright, Harry,” she says gently.
“I didn’t realise,” Draco says, voice low, staring somewhere over Potter’s right shoulder, “I—I knew that, but I...forgot I guess. I’m sorry.”
His expression clears slightly and he licks his lips, looking away and sighing. “I suppose I shouldn’t have waited this long to introduce him.”
Malfoy looked decidedly pink in the face now. “Don’t be a silly child. Come out and say hello like you were taught to.” And then that fond expression returned. “Like we know you’re dying to.”
“We’ll get there,” Hermione assures him, no particular inflection in her tone, but that knowing glint back in her eyes. “What else, Malfoy?”
As Scorpius protests weakly about being allowed to stay up late on his birthday, Draco looks around, doing a double take when he sees his mother standing with Harry and murmuring softly to him, Harry’s face very red as he glances at Draco over her head before looking down and nodding wordlessly.
“Tea?” the server asks, setting down a little pot of cream next to Harry’s elbow.
“Rude, blond thing,” the witch nods, “Did go and find Marvin when he slipped out once, though,” she says, scratching her cat’s ears.
I pause, blinking at him in surprise. He goes pinker than ever.
“Finish what you fucking started yesterday, Potter,” Draco says snidely, grazing his teeth up the taut chords of his neck, laying a wet lick beneath his ear. “It’s the least you can do after abandoning me and our unborn offspring the way you did last night.”
“Why? D’you’ve to be somewhere?”
“He’s really surprised me, though,” Ron goes on and I grit my teeth around a mouthful of ale. “Malfoy, I mean. I can’t believe he’s been with that guy for as long as he has now – what, two months?” I don’t reply once again and just sit there hoping he’ll drop it. “I mean, one minute he’s taking home three guys at once, and the next he has a steady boyfriend.” Ron sounds more confused than anything and I suddenly wish I’d refused when Ron had asked me earlier today if I was up for impromptu pizza night.
“I’ve been to a ball before!” laughs Harry.
“Either way,” Harry laughs. “Oh,
Potter
Potter chose to chime in.
From the floor, Harry watched Malfoy raise both arms over his head. In his hands there was a sword of pure gold.
Draco squints, lips turned inwards as he tries to stem the wild surges of excitement and warmth that are filling him up as he watches the darling little buds shift from snow white to bright bubblegum pink to pale lilac to a maroon so rich and deep that it’s almost wine red before flashing a pretty, butter yellow.
Malfoy remains staunchly silent as they Apparate onto the front porch of Grimmauld and make their way inside, Harry babbling away as he leads them upstairs, pointing out the rooms that lie in between. Malfoy simply follows him wordlessly, expression inscrutable as he takes in the curiously staring portraits and the spasmodically moving landscapes in their gilded frames.
“You did take some sort of hex that left you permanently disfigured?” Malfoy confirms curiously. Ron hacks loudly through a mouthful of limp crisps.
Harry looks up once more and Draco’s stomach drops several feet when he notices the gleam of moisture in his eyes. “You left,” he mumbles suddenly and Draco is unable to remember why he left at all.
Malfoy makes a tiny sound of complete shock but Harry hunches over him, dragging his head back roughly as he holds up a finger to his own mouth.
Ron and Hermione don’t comment but Harry catches them exchanging knowing glances on more than one occasion.
“Pardon?” It comes out sounding overly polite.
“I’ll spell his cage shut so he doesn’t get out tonight,” he promised, running wet lips lovingly over Draco’s face. Just barely mollified, Draco sighed through his nose with a scowl, bleary-eyed as he traced his forefinger over one of the tattoos on Harry’s chest.

Their mouths still locked together, Harry slid his hands down Draco’s sides, his skin still warm from the bath, Harry’s slightly rough hands making him break out in gooseflesh. Gripping Draco’s arse firmly for a brief second, Harry then proceeded to slide the robe over Draco’s shoulders and toss it aside carelessly before cupping Draco under the bum with both hands and just as carelessly flinging him onto the bed.
Harry was exhausted, and the sight of Malfoy’s thin, grim face pissed him off. “For heaven’s sake,” he snapped. “What, you think I’m going to
But Harry didn’t move – he was back to staring at Malfoy’s scars again. He was still hard.

he’d agreed to accompany the other Eighth Years outside to ‘enjoy the first snow’, but a half hour ago he’d found himself muttering wearily under his breath even as he’d readily pulled on an additional jumper, gloves, earmuffs and his house scarf before following the small crowd down to the courtyard along with Pansy who had then promptly ditched him when Ginny Weasley had popped up out of nowhere, sly grin on her stupid, pretty face at the sight of Pansy.

“It’s the Finals tomorrow,” Harry pulled away and panted out of the blue. Draco blinked slowly, wet lips parted.
“Wh-what?” he whispers at last, looking very much like he’s fervently praying he’d misheard Harry. “What did you just say?”
“They might, you never know,” Harry says lightly.
Draco observes Potter in silence for a long moment, mind whirring. Finally, “I have a better idea, Potter. Go change into something that doesn’t have
Draco calmly sets his glass on the bar. “Yes.”
First he had to figure out what this cruel new twist of fate he’d been dealt was.
“Not at my father’s, you didn’t,” Malfoy spits at once, baring his teeth for a moment but still somehow managing to look unbearably lovely.
Harry deliberately doesn’t permit his brain to process that. “No,” he answers at once.

Potter shrugs, waving a hand idly around the room. “You know just...be.”
“Will we find her? Ever?”
!” Harry says loudly, taking another step towards him. But Malfoy is spinning on his heel, his hair flying around him, and almost running for the stairs, the shine of tears on his cheeks unmistakable in the bright orange flare of the fire. “MALFOY!” Harry immediately lurches forward.
“You see, Scorpius?” he said without looking away. “What am I always telling you?”

“Is Potter home?” he asks quietly. “I’d like to meet with him.”

Malfoy is still grinning widely as he stops laughing and stares at Harry, shining eyes widening slightly. He tilts his head expectantly, face still open and smiling as he seemingly waits for Harry to laugh as well. “What?” he finally says blankly, when Harry just waits nervously.
“I’ll make tea,” Ron grunts, ears pink, before wandering away to the kitchen, the sound of the kettle filling slightly jarring in the ensuing silence.
“Expec...”
“Just—just go away, Potter.”
“EXPECTO PATRONUM!”
An injured pause. Then, “That’s not true, Harry.”
“If one of you doesn’t—” Draco begins loudly.
“Potter.” The sharpness in Malfoy’s voice sounded forced. “Potter, are you fucking

, not quite.”
“I make no such promise,” Harry says stubbornly.
“Draco Malfoy,” she said brightly. And then, “You have been highly sexually active lately.”
“She’s here! Dad, where’s Mum?!”
“Malfoy.”
Draco Malfoy, apparently still asleep, was (presumably) experiencing a wet dream as Harry stood and watched.
“Who the actual fuck still wears gloves?” Potter rasps, his eyes on Draco’s primly clasped fingers. His gaze travels higher, to the delicate skin of Draco’s exposed wrists, up his silk covered arms, to his long neck, which is slowly flushing pink under his appraising, clearly admiring, gaze.
“Don’t touch anything, please,” Draco replies tersely, putting on his glasses and peering into the cauldron and sighing in relief when he sees that the valerian root hasn’t overheated and turned purple. He lifts the Stasis and gives the cauldron a light, careful stir, the silver ladle a solid weight in his hand.
“Does that do something for you, Weasley? ‘cause I’m doing a little spotting of my own from over here, and if that’s not a boner between your legs then I—”
Harry doesn’t answer right away and so Draco blinks at him in the semi-darkness, tracing the faint upward curve of Harry’s mouth with his fingertips. “Did I scare you earlier?” he suddenly asks.
beautiful brat who just
a Veela?” Harry blurts when Hermione doesn’t move to ask anymore questions.
Draco blinks and waits but when Potter’s silence continues, he goes on. “After we completed the course, Richard asked me to move in with him – he’d been talking of renting a place in London for weeks, was so excited about it. And well,” Draco’s insides twist uncomfortably as he says it, “I thought we were in love.” Potter’s expression hasn’t changed at all and his flat stare is starting to unnerve Draco. “Father didn’t approve of us,” he blurts out hurriedly, now wanting to just be done with it. “Wanted me to break it off with him and Mother wasn’t exactly offering any kind of support either so I—Well, I was nineteen and stupid, alright? I left the Manor and moved in with Richard and—and things were alright for a bit. We started apprenticing under William Gnopf – have you heard of him? Brilliant potioneer, Professor Snape hated him,” Draco smiles softly to himself for a moment, “About a year in I found out that Richard had been sleeping with one of the other apprentices, a Julio someone,” he says quietly, even the back of his neck burning now, his insides roiling with mortified shame. “It took me all of two hours to pack and leave, and...that place was the best I could find if I didn’t want to spend the night in a Knockturn back alley with my Shrunken trunk in my pocket.”
The Invisibility Cloak came away to reveal the tiny figure of Lily crouched on the floor, face wet with tears, hands pressed to her ears. As the Cloak fell onto the floor in a puddle next to her, she squealed in misery and desperately reached for Harry.
Finally, breathless and flushed, they pulled away, beaming at each other, laughing in disbelief and exultation until they were interrupted by a bout of indignant chattering.
“You can fuck off right now for all I care, Potter,” Malfoy says nastily. “
“Tristan,” the man replies holding out a broad hand.
Harry’s head spins as Malfoy’s scent fills his senses. He can’t think beyond the words Malfoy whispers into his skin, he can’t see anything but the marmoreal perfection of Malfoy’s skin, his limbs long and bare; can’t hear anything but the soft moans Malfoy muffles into the pillow and couldn’t taste anything but the sweet, musky taste of Malfoy’s puckered arsehole, the heated throbbing of Malfoy’s cock in his mouth.

“It’s hard not to,” Harry blurted out before he could think. Feeling his face heat, he quickly turned to his bag, pulling out three text books at random and a wrinkled sheet of parchment.
“Fancy,” he mumbles, slowly approaching and then sitting down at the table, side-eying the flowers and candles, the napkins folded into swans, and the brand new cutlery. Then he suddenly looks up at me as I bring over and pour the wine. “Are—are you wearing a new shirt?”
Harry walks past the nondescript, unpolished oak double doors twice before finally pausing to peer at the little, dull brass sign on the wall - Department of Magical Theory and Research - and with a deep breath, pushes in.
“No, Potter, the lube is just for moral support – to sit there in your hand in case you need something to hold—
do anything when he behaves badly,” Draco said heatedly despite the fact that he was beginning to feel stupid already.
They headed for the living room and every fibre of Harry’s being dreaded the sight they might see. Ginny lying there, sprawled out; would she have the ability to feel sad at having been left alone all this time? Could she feel
“It’s rude to be this nosy, Draco,” Narcissa chides.
“Are you coming back in there,” he jerks his head in the direction of the club, “or do I tell everyone you left?”
“Tristan said he loves me,” he replies bluntly.
Granger had only just asked them, with a mysterious little smirk, whether they’d like to know the gender of the baby when her stupendously oafish husband had barged into the office, freezing at the sight of Draco with his belly out, and had almost fallen backwards out the door when Draco had begun bellowing expletives at him, Potter hurrying out after him with an apologetic grimace.

“I don’t care if I have a few creases in my robes, Malfoy,” he says.
He grins, turning back to the mirror to gingerly dab at the blue crap on his face with one stiffly held finger.
Harry was also infuriatingly tenacious, impressively witty, and was also funny with a sassy sort of confidence that left a person momentarily speechless before they laughed. He was consistently,
James thundered inside and Harry sprinted after him, his panic enough to mask the mild twinges of discomfort in his ankle.

“What’s this about?” I hurriedly ask, looking at anything but the way Draco’s tongue curled around his fork, pink lips shiny with thick sugary syrup.
I never ask Ron and Hermione about Draco, even though I know they do meet him on a semi-regular basis. I don’t ask them what I’m dying to know – does he ask about me? Does he mention me at all? What’s he like...without me?
“Why would you think it acceptable to ask
rather irritated, when Granger does actually come in, shutting the door behind herself and following him into his lab.
Blinking, he looked around to see Moody scuttle past with his own little soft baby blue flannel blanket clutched in his pink mouth. Draco scowled. That fucking ferret. He still couldn’t believe that Harry washed his gross, fur-covered blanket along with the rest of their clothes.
Harry’s knuckles crack from how hard he clenches his fists.

a--!” before kissing him once more, demanding and desperate, but still somehow tender, yearning.
“What’s wrong?” Harry demands breathlessly, hopping off his broom before he’s even landed fully. “What the fuck happened?”
Lip curling, Draco raises his sixth tumbler of scotch at Potter and downs it in a single gulp. Potter doesn’t even blink.
I turn around with a snort, grinning at the sight of the snooty arsehole at the door, huge white cardboard box in one hand, wand twirling lazily in the other.

“Again,
“Everything’s going to be all right, Malfoy,” Hermione says gently, before she straightens in her seat, visibly struck. “You... You do intend on keeping it?”
I blink, my spine instantly stiffening. “What do you mean?”
Finally, Draco grew nervous enough that it translated into impatience.

“I’m being
Weasley on the other hand simply beamed at Draco, holding his big, ruddy hand out. Draco looked down at it; he had very fine red hair on his arms and some sort of marks that looked like he’d at some point had thick ropes wound around his them tight enough to leave permanent scars. There was a sprinkling of freckles across the back of his hand and fingers and his nails were surprisingly clean and neatly trimmed.
fault that you shagged Malfoy ten minutes after running into him for the first time since the War.”
“How do we know that?” I ask at once. “
Around us, the party has resumed.
“Your hair.” I lift one hand to fondle a strand of the shiny silk and then tuck it behind his ear. “’s pretty.”
I laugh. “Be my guest. I’m never the one to put them up, anyway.”
I’m not sure I have one.
“It’s Tristan’s birthday!” he says brightly just as we walk up to the birthday bastard who grins and nods at me.
Come to think of it, Draco

Octavia wiggles her bejewelled fingers at the poor bastard, Draco rolling his eyes as he sifts through his messages.
“He owled me,” Draco supplies. He’s not smiling anymore. “He’s at Mungo’s too. I’ve convinced him not to press charges, by the way.”
Potter leans back and crosses his legs, gazing steadily at Draco as he picks up his own cuppa. “I think you’d submit to me either way,” he quips, mouth quivering before he takes a sip, eyes locked with Draco’s.
He woke with his mouth, tongue and throat parched so dry that his attempt to swallow through it was
Malfoy was discreet about his own social life and thankfully managed to stay out of sight of the press, and Harry went only on a few half-arsed dates if and when he could be bothered.
“Go home; you’re beyond pissed.”
I grab him by the collar and slam him into the wall so hard that he gasps in pain. But he has no time to recover from that because I’m already kissing him.
“So, I can stare at you?” Potter’s voice is rich and low, eyes gleaming with something that makes Draco’s heart trip.
? Fuck, you’re making this whole thing
be with him, alive and whole, than her.
“What, what is it?” Harry demands at once, staring between her expression of awed disbelief and the projection on the wall.
“You as good as admitted to it that one time,” he says. “And Hermione says that this fight you two have had has something to do with—with you, y’know...the way you feel about him.”
“I—I need to shower first, I have cake-vomit all over me,” Draco says shakily, head falling back.
worse,” he warns me. “I know you’re too decent to put him in danger like that.”
“Shit!” Scorpius chimes at once and Draco hears Harry curse under his breath again.
“Well... I haven’t,” Draco replies blandly and Potter rolls his eyes.
Harry’s on his feet quite suddenly and is radiating that same raw, undefeatable power that Draco had felt emanating from him that first time he’d walked into this house weeks ago. He remains frozen still where he’s sitting, looking up at Harry with a calmness he doesn’t really feel.
“’ere you are, love.”
“I could, you know,” he blurted out and Malfoy sighed as he turned back to look at him with one eyebrow raised expectantly, waiting for him to explain. “Could—help you with that... that situation too... Gladly.”
“Excuse me?” Draco asks incredulously.
I simply frown at Draco’s small, round ear and start a rough mental countdown for how long I believe this idiocy will last.
“I know what I said, Potter,” Draco snaps.
“He doesn’t
“Draco?” Narcissa’s voice is a tremulous, her tone requesting immediate answers.
--” Malfoy breathed his name into his neck over and over again, his thighs visibly trembling from exertion. Harry could feel hot tears in his crook of his shoulder, running down his skin and onto the sheets below. His fingers clenched into the soft flesh of Malfoy’s
Albeit rare, these unmitigated breakdowns render Draco almost paralysed with shock and fright when they occur, and although he’s had over seven years, he’s still not managed to learn how to efficiently deal with them, still hasn’t learnt the right things to say; and
The elf tilts its head, the hallway too gloomy for Draco to be able to see its expression, but then it nods and sweeps one skeletally thin arm down the corridor, bowing Draco further inside.
A soul: precious, irreplaceable, gone in an instant.
,” he ordered gently and Draco, now perspiring all the way down to the small of his back, realised that although his grip on his own bum was painfully tight, his arms were limp and his arse wasn’t as wide open as Harry liked it to be. “Here.” He eased Draco’s hands away at the little whimper that escaped him, grabbed him and opened him up mortifyingly wide, pushing his face back in with an eager growl.
I scramble to my feet as he’s turning away. “Hey.” I grab his arm.
Harry almost spits out his beer as he bursts out laughing. “Did that actually
Harry could feel Malfoy trembling under him – or was it Harry himself who was trembling? Malfoy was moaning roughly, guttural sounds of satisfaction as he bit down on Harry’s lower lip and stretched it out, letting it go and then nipping it again. He opened his mouth as Harry sunk his tongue back in, panting roughly every time Harry gave him a second to breathe.
“For the reporter, yeah?” Malfoy gasps out when they pull away.
“Just answer me.”

“Cold,” she whimpered, weakly slumped against him.
forget to take your doses, Potter,” Draco says, eyes narrowing. “I’ve brought you thirty doses and it’ll be plenty, seeing as we’re already a few days into this month’s cycle. I’ll bring you a fresh crateful next month.”
“No.”
“Thus adding the dreaded, pungent aftertaste that Wolfsbane is known to possess,” Draco finishes, surprised and more than a little impressed. Not even some seasoned brewers know this little hack.
“I only ever smoke with you, Potter.”
“Thank god,” says Draco, relieved as he puts his menu aside. “I don’t know what the hell all these mean anyway, so I’ll just have what you’re having.”

“You just want to fuck me again, is that it?” Draco asks flatly, his limbs beginning to tremble.
“Hello, grumpy.”
“Don’t put this on me,” he shoots back, frowning. “Since that fucking
When the rumours of him and Malfoy moving in together start doing their rounds, it’s almost like having an epiphany.
More than anything else Draco can still feel that ache in his chest that he’d felt every time Potter said his name with something akin to fondness. The way Draco’s every resolve to be sharp and aloof dissolved under the bastard’s touch. The way his eyes had lingered on Draco’s mouth, making Draco’s heart fling itself around his chest, and the way his fingers brushed over the sensitive inside of Draco’s wrist, making his whole body tingle.
“Why would I do that?” Draco asks, raising one eyebrow haughtily. “It isn’t even my sub-department. Why would I care who replaces you?”

let myself be swayed.
But Harry’s cockhead has barely breached him before he’s pulling out again, barking a laugh at the murderous glare Draco shoots him. Pressing in again, Harry pushes halfway in before yanking back again, grinning wickedly when Draco thrashes and kicks out violently.
Bill shrugs and nods, one ear still tilted towards Hermione as she spoke.
But it’s always that first time I think about. The first time my best friend turned lover had finally admitted that he loves me. Just as I love him.
And Draco’s knee buckled. He collapsed with a gasp of shock, arms flailing wildly, but Harry caught him, fingers pulling out of him and both hands firmly grabbing on to the cushiony softness of Draco’s bum, giving it a teasing squeeze as he positioned him to straddle his thighs, pants and trousers still tangled around his ankles before Harry pulled off one shoe and then tugged that leg free from the constricting garments so Draco could spread his knees open wider.
Malfoy abruptly sets his fork down, eyes gleaming with something as he looks up and slowly leans back, mouth slowly ticking up in such a derisive, openly hostile smirk that Harry instantly feels his hackles rise.
Hermione grimaces discreetly. “Er... I suppose he should wait outs—”
“Thank you,” he whispers.
“I suppose I wouldn’t, no.” Harry leaned in a bit. “Malfoy, it took me
“Malfoy,” Harry murmurs, nuzzling into his sharp collarbones before running the flat of his tongue up the length of his neck, kissing his jumping Adam’s apple and gnawing at his perfect jaw. “Fuck, are you okay? Did I--?”
“I won’t tell anyone.” Malfoy spoke softly but sounded weary – detached. “Don’t worry.”
it means?”
Ginny was flat on her back, sprawled out.
“Draco, babe, I—”
Then, quite suddenly, Potter seems to become aware of a set of eyes on him. Whipping around, he takes in Malfoy standing there, naked and wand held aloft, and he grins.
“Fuck me properly, you incompetent shit! For fuck’s sake,
“Sorry!”
“I’m—I thought you might be tired,” Draco pants when he pulls away, mouth tingling wetly. Harry’s hands, until now on Draco’s hips, slide down to cup his arse and
“Wait, you’re serious,” I lean forward with a frown, “You’re not joking about this?”
Gritting his teeth and holding back a strangled sound of pleasure, Draco picks up the pace. Potter is meeting him thrust for thrust now, his crease turning wetter from the precome Draco leaks into it. There’s a soft slapping sound and Draco realises that it’s Potter’s cock bouncing against his own belly. He’s not come yet, Potter, and he’s been hard since they were in the alley. The fact that Potter doesn’t complain about this and lets Draco have his way nearly sends him flying apart.
“You...you saved

“What’s that supposed to mean?” I demand irritably.

Draco thrusts the last bite of the chocolaty pastry at Potter, fingers smeared with chocolate, chin lifting as though extending a challenge. Potter stares at Draco, not even looking at what he’s being offered before slowly extending an arm out to him.
. “Kreacher will unpack this for you later,” he says. “Have you eaten breakfast?”
Draco shudders, mouth twisting. “You’re going to make me lose my lunch,” he declares flatly. “And stop lounging. Have you finished drafting the invitation letter to the Bulgarian Minister? The conference is in three weeks, the letter needs to go out today.”
!” Draco shouts, face twisted into something far from attractive. “Stop it, stop talking! You’re ruining
Even Draco couldn’t help but heave in silent mirth as he’d watched Finnigan shriek and scrabble at the centaur’s hindquarters, Thomas almost pissing himself, judging by how hard he’d laughed, before going to rescue him while the rest of them, Potter included, had roared with helpless,
“Who you lookin’ for, dearie?” the old witch eventually asks Harry in a quavering voice.
“Do I?” Malfoy raises an eyebrow, “I’m not sure, Potter. What
Harry runs a frantic hand through his still wet hair, rolling his eyes. “I don’t give a flying fuck about the bastard, and you know it,” he says flatly. “I can’t risk putting Draco through any kind of stress at this point. Just make sure they get back to that Manor of theirs by tonight and get them to lower the wards. I’ll drop in tomorrow and ask them to owl their fucking son. Draco doesn’t have to know about any of this.”
“Fuck,” breathes Draco.
“Fine,” Harry cuts him off.
“Dad, where’s Mum?”
Draco waits for him to elaborate, and when he doesn’t, says, “Seeing as I possess full, functional use of my eardrums, I heard a lot of things, Erickson.” When that gets nothing but a curious, vapid smile, Draco sighs. “What are you talking about?”
He bucks his hips forward and I groan at the friction, denim covered cocks rubbing roughly together, bony fingers in my hair, and sharp teeth at my jaw.
Yes, Harry decides, definitely his happiest Christmas ever.
Kissing him quiet, Harry braces his forearms on the floor, lifting up on them and shifting his hips back and forth in the slowest, most gentle rhythm he can, barely pulling out of Draco before grinding back inside, Draco’s arse happily clutching at him.
“What else does Hermione say? What is it that you both think about me and my alleged feelings for someone we grew up hating?”
“Sorry,” Harry says hurriedly, ire abruptly draining out of him at the subtle threat. “I’m—Malfoy...sorry. Just... Just let us help, yeah? Thanks for—thanks for agreeing to see Hermione,” he adds lamely, shoving one hand into his pocket and the other into his hair.

of me,” I groan.
of it, so far. The afternoon they first kissed, they snogged until they’d broken out in sweat, and had then gone and gotten lunch at the little Italian joint in Draco’s neighbourhood. The day after that, Draco had gone over to Grimmauld on the pretext of delivering the Sleeping Draught he’d finally managed to brew successfully, without Potter having been there to distract him, and Potter and he had promptly relapsed into frantic snogging, which eventually led to some even more frantic rutting on Potter’s sofa, followed by some more snogging, this time less frantic. He’s since been back to Grimmauld every evening after work because they’re apparently no different from a pair of desperately randy teens who want to spend all their time kissing each other senseless and coming in their pants, and no time at all talking about what it all means.
Tilting his head, Harry latches his mouth over the wet hole, sucking with loud, crude slurps, mumbling unintelligibly into Malfoy’s arse as he shoves his tongue back in, joggling and bobbing his head as he goes back to fucking him with it. Malfoy moans throatily,
“What store?”
,” Harry says exasperatedly. “Draco, I don’t know what I’d
! Potter, there, don’t stop, keep--” he groans helplessly into one arm, “—keep going, Potter!” he manages in a high wheeze.
Harry doesn’t bother reading the article although he does spend a full ten minutes staring at Malfoy’s unreadable expression in the moving picture while his bandaged arm tingles and throbs.
“I remember Weasley mentioning something related to the Ministry,” Draco says cautiously. “Something about you...considering something, or...whatever. What was that about?”
“You think I’m charming, Malfoy?” Harry’s cheek is resting in one hand, his body leaning into Malfoy’s personal space with no conscious effort to do so.
We don’t talk anymore. We don’t hang out anymore. We don’t interact in any form or way anymore.
A fucking
But Draco has answers ready – he’s already made up his mind.
Harry stands there, blinking slowly, expression serene and untouched, not even slightly aware of the silent meltdown Draco is experiencing at the moment.
Potter looks rather charmed. “What’d you name her?”
“I’m not sulking, this is just my face.” Draco dumps the honey into the cauldron and stirs vigorously, the potion inside sloshing up the sides.
on me and can see exactly what’s going on in my head.
Draco is incredibly tense when comes back over an hour later, although he realises only after Potter immediately beams at him that he’d been tense not about their guests for the evening but because of the mood he’d left Potter in earlier.
The D is in a glossy, almost silvery, grey thread, edged all around with black to make it stand out more, and has a lovely little flourish, the style almost calligraphic. Harry had immediately written to Mrs. Weasley when they’d received their parcels earlier that day, thanking her for making Draco one as well.
Malfoy.”
“Yes,” Harry says, gulping before adding, “because we live together, you idiot.”
It’s still early, he realises when he peeks around the thick, velvet curtains, drawing them properly shut so there aren’t any gaps, glancing back at Harry’s sleeping form as he soundlessly pads out of the room.
“Yeah, because he’s a big, scary werewolf and would likely jump you if he didn’t properly reign himself in,” Octavia waves a careless hand, “Heightened sense of smell and everything – and you’re a
get a few wide-eyed stares, but then, he’s used to those.
“I—nothing,” Draco babbles quickly. “I don’t know—it’s nothing, Potter,” he repeats, tugging him back down. Potter, however, resists, ducking out from under Draco’s grip and gently catching one of his wrists.
“Yes.” Malfoy licked his lips – Harry actually
He’s laughing now. I cannot describe in words the perfection of the sight of Draco Malfoy laughing wholeheartedly. It’s almost ethereal.
All of that had been a week ago. And it still hasn’t gone away.
“The students, yes.”
His gaze tilts up when there’s a creamy flash at the window behind the folds of the thick curtains. The moon floats lazily, blurred behind the sheet of rain but full and round in its brilliant whiteness, mocking Harry with its deceptively serene presence in the agitated firmament. For once, for the first time in
Draco shakes his head, sighing when they step up close enough to let their brows press together, Draco’s breath fogging Potter’s glasses. “I just...” Draco bites his lip, mouth curling down unhappily. “I just want it to work
Malfoy looked visibly disappointed. “Oh.”
!” Harry bellows, causing Malfoy to splutter wordlessly at him, his blush spreading right up to his delicately rounded ears.
“Oh, good.”
Nothing sounds worse. “I promised Hermione,” I say vaguely. “I’m really sorry. I’ll owl you later, okay?”
I want to say to him. He stops and turns around halfway, the look on his face haughty and sharp. “I didn’t mean to snap,” I finally tell him. He doesn’t smile or relax his rigid stance, simply standing there in silence until I shift uneasily on my feet.
“Put your cock in me.”
“What?” Draco snapped, wondering if it was another jab at his Dark Mark.
“Aberforth
And then Harry felt as though he had walked out into a snowstorm. Behind him, the boys gasped in unison and Lily burst into tears. Harry felt as though his feet were frozen to the wooden floors.
at him; about the way Draco’s head was nearly always full of him, all day every day, and about the way Draco sometimes deliberately went to bed still smelling of him, refusing to acknowledge what it meant – because he already fucking
I feel a sort of blinding happiness coupled with amusement spreading through my chest. “All of them?” I ask.
He packed the trunks and carefully slipped them into his pockets which he had laced with Undetectable Extension charms. When he huddled the children together, still mud-streaked and grubby, he felt a hollow emptiness inside him; he was voluntarily bringing his children back to the place of danger they had barely managed to escape from not twelve hours ago. But he knew James was right; and there was no way he’d ever manage to leave England without at least
A month ago, when Ron and Hermione had invited us over for Sunday brunch one weekend and Draco had arrived late and slightly out of breath, Ron had asked him just where the fuck he’d been and he’d smirked that
“Would I admit to that in front of two Aurors?” Draco deadpans, taking a long pull of whiskey.
I suck him off, bobbing my head and pressing my lips as tight as I can, holding his thighs open with one hand and fiddling with his balls with the other. They’re soft and very sensitive and I can’t believe how every inch of him is so beautiful, so appealing to me, how every bit of him just drags me in and holds me captive.
Simon looks surprised although I have indeed told him not to fucking call Draco that.
He pulls off again when he starts to get dizzy, licking up along the bulging veins and pulling the foreskin down hard towards the base, fluttering little sucking kisses over the shaft when Potter whimpers and writhes. Holding his cock by the base with one hand, Draco reaches for and gently tugs at Potter’s balls, lifting the heavy sac on one palm and rolling it around, closing his fingers around it on a teasing squeeze every now and then.
Harry accidentally snaps the thin neck of his bottle and looks down in surprise before lazily placing the pieces aside and pushing his way into the surging, wildly moving crowd. It’s hot in here, despite the time of the year, and the press of so many bodies as well as the rising fury inside him, has Harry breaking out into an instant sweat.
I scowl as I watch Tristan grin down at him and then turn to indicate something to the barman, who in turn passes him two pints of beer, one of which Tristan hands to Draco – but Draco
Though not spick and span, Potter’s room is reasonable tidy and, surprisingly, isn’t as
“Yes, it’s not my father you’re afraid of,” Draco says pointedly, lifting Scorpius off the counter after prying a tiny bottle of very expensive vanilla syrup out of his hands.
Malfoy nearly shuts the door in his face but ends up slamming it into Harry’s booted foot instead. “
“What makes you think I’m still hung up on him?”
“I—I forgot,” Malfoy says, voice hushed and eyes very wide, his face a stark white. “I’m sorry, Potter, I meant no disrespe—”
“Yeah?”
“I agreed to no such thing,” Malfoy replies looking away, his face set in an obstinate moue.
Potter actually rolls his eyes, the merest hint of an exasperated grin flashing across his lips. “Couldn’t be more wrong even if you
Draco stands up and grabs her elbow when she makes to follow Lucius. “What did you say to Harry?” he asks, now slightly annoyed.
“You can’t just
...Wait, what?
“It’s not the same thing!” Draco exclaims incredulously. “You shouldn’t be taking up a job you don’t want for someone
“You’re
but then I notice that Draco’s left hand is firmly entwined with Tristan’s right and I want to shrug his head off my shoulder in irritation.
“What do you mean
“I owled you,” Malfoy says, swallowing desperately. “I owled you dozens of times after I broke up with—” This time when he breaks off, Malfoy stares fixedly at his own feet, his cheeks slowly colouring. Across from them, Lucius’ mouth curls into a small smirk.
“Can you unknot your fucking knickers, mate?” Ron says exasperatedly. “It hasn’t got out and I’ve got them in a warded holding cell here. Nobody knows but Paulson and me, and I’ll release them after I’ve had their wands scanned.” He looks slightly disappointed as he stares at Harry. “Didn’t think you’d stick up for Lucius Malfoy, to be frank,” he says lowly.
“It was not ten minutes!” Harry says loudly, swelling angrily. “More like...twenty, I dunno,” he mumbles, deflating abruptly. “I dunno, okay, he was just—fuck, I can’t tell you if it was the booze or what but he was—there was something
“And speaking of gay,” Draco continues, “have you met Tristan?” He nods towards the newcomer.
Then his cock is allowed to gently slap onto his heaving belly, and Harry cups Draco’s arse with both hands and hefts, lifting it up before resting his elbows on the frame of the bed straightening up off his heels, standing up on his knees, holding Draco up in the air.
His forehead is too big, I decide. His eyes are set too close. He’s definitely hiding a bald spot on one side of his head.
Scowling, Harry obligingly angles his hips away before scrounging through the files on Ron’s desk. “Piss off,” he grumbles when Ron continues to stare almost
“You’re rather horrible.”
“Always the victim,” Draco mutters, looking away, and Potter laughs again, this time elbowing him lightly in the flank. Draco’s heart skips dizzily and he makes a deliberate effort to keep breathing.
“Hard to believe,” Malfoy says lightly. “I was under the impression that the Weasel was your personal bodyguard.”
He was also shirtless, clad only in joggers, and his hip bones distracted Draco long enough for Harry to pull his toothbrush out of his mouth to ask thickly through a mouthful of foam, “Wha’?”
,” Potter says, mispronouncing the word, “in Paris?”
He pulls off on instinct, blinking as some of the warm, white streaks hit his chin, his gaze traversing up Potter’s twisting form to his face, scrunched up and red with pleasure. He keeps one hand moving along the shaft, squeezing and twisting relentlessly under the head until Potter makes a wet sound of incoherence and reaches down to clamp a hand around Draco’s wrist, eyes flying open.
“Harry?” Draco eventually whispers. Except to turn his head to face Draco, Harry doesn’t move or react. “Are you...alright?”
“But you do,” Potter reminds him blandly, turning to look for a waiter.
“Git,” Harry says fondly and thrusts out the rest of his dragon egg at Malfoy.
Suddenly he can see Malfoy smirking at him under those strobe lights in the club, can hear Malfoy’s helpless, breathy moans, the way he had sucked over Malfoy’s pulse point, unable to get enough of his scent. It’s a scent he has imprinted to memory, and as he stands there, Harry wants nothing more than to bury his face against that slender neck again and scent him; inhale him until he can smell nobody and nothing else.
,” he tells her pointedly, stuffing the rubber nipple into her mouth and watching as she instantly begins sucking ravenously. “You wouldn’t be so miserable if you’d just eaten your breakfast.”
touching Draco – and it’s more than just a friendly hand on the shoulder this time.
Harry’s stomach tightened and his throat closed up. He kept his eyes squeezed shut and let shudder after shudder pass through his chilled flesh. “She’s—”
“Yes, because the
” Draco is more annoyed than impressed now – she wasn’t even a professional and she knew more than most of his fellow brewers did. “This is additional to that. It’s beneficial to the end result. Granger, what do you want? Why are you here?”
But Draco Malfoy is not someone you dismiss in a conversation. Because he’s the one who usually does the dismissing.
“So demanding,” Harry sniggers, lubing up and thumbing his cock into place, the tip of it tickling Draco’s rim. “You’ve barely touched me all these months, baby, I’m entitled to a bit of teasing.”
Dinner is a hit, and the pot of chicken curry I’d spent all evening making is wiped clean by the time we’re done eating. Everyone is eating the fancy ice cream Draco brought and he seems very pleased with our reaction. He’s sitting across my lap, one hand absently fiddling with my hair, as he loudly informs Seamus and Dean how clichéd their engagement is because Seamus had proposed on Christmas.
“’cause I’m less likely to attack you if there’s a table between us,” replies Potter, gaze zeroing in on Draco’s cock.
, but he, more than anything, wants to suck his golden cock until Potter’s very
“What did you do?” he wheezes, reaching forward and grabbing a handful of his son’s ludicrous, neon purple and vomit green robes, “How did you change them?
“I know your plan now, Potter,” Draco says calmly, tossing his napkin down, pushing his chair back, gathering the mahogany box up and rising. “You’re just going to keep spending money on me until I am so deeply drowned in debt that I’d have no choice but to submit to your every wish.”
?” Draco scrunches his face up and mocks, getting up and irritably pushing his plate away, just to hear it clatter noisily against the scratched wood.
Yup, this wasn’t a good idea.
sky-blue robes, furry white gloves and cold-pinkened cheeks, munching on a chocolate frog as he shakes his head at Harry.
“Why did you do it?”
“Harry.”
he is; how his skin is nearly milk white and yet glows pearly pink, how his smile doesn’t seem slimy and malicious anymore but genuine and alluringly wicked, how his hair gleams fucking
“It’s the safest place I can think of to bring my kids to right now.”
“Okay, let me put it this way.” Harry was done going in circles. “
Potter had
,” Harry hisses, whipping him around by the hips and lifting one of Malfoy’s long thighs up to curl around his waist. “I’m saying once I decide you’re mine, there’s no way I’m letting you go, so if you ending up wanting to leave, we’ll have a problem.”
“Well, they’re not exactly lining up to put themselves through it, are they,” Hermione laughs, “but I think there
He’s taken a look before and not one of them is worth a second glance, he knows.
“Ferrets are not rodents,” Harry mumbled, tugging at his earlobe, examining his shoes. When Draco only swelled further, rage building to a dangerous level, he hurriedly held up his hands. “I’ll—I’ll ... erm ... have a word with him ...?”
Harry whirled around, wand in hand. Albus sat eating his banana, swinging his legs energetically, but James was watching Harry with wide brown eyes, mouth slightly open.
smart, I mean—Hermione thinks he’s
Potter swallows hard, his sweat-shiny throat bobbing as his hands loosen around Draco’s. “Use your--” he murmurs, but his voice cracks and he quickly clears his throat discreetly. “Lift yourself using your free foot and use your knee against my side to throw me off.” He speaks so softly that his voice is merely a puff of air against the damp skin of Draco’s neck.
“Don’t worry about it, Potter,” Malfoy smirks, tossing the rest of his drink back and setting it on the bar they’re leaning up against, “Tell me, d’you ever dance at these places, or d’you just watch
“James, we just ate dinner.”
“A lot of things do something for you, Malfoy,” Ron says loudly and the glare Draco throws over his shoulder is directed at me, not Ron, and so I quickly smack Ron up the back of his head, dragging him away firmly by the sleeve while I sneak quick glances over my shoulder at the pair of them – Draco is standing a whole lot closer to him than he’d been three seconds ago.
Potter had worn a pale, mint green button down under his black leather jacket, buttons left undone up to his sternum. He wore an oxidised silver pendant shaped like a stag on a long black thread around his neck. Potter had smiled at Draco and had laughed at things he’d said. He’d bought Draco drinks. He’d played with Draco’s hair.
“Not exactly,” he said.
“I’m not being defensive!” Harry claims at once, narrowing his eyes at Draco’s grin and kissing him on the mouth. “You’ll be okay to take them by yourself?” he asks, and Draco nods.
“Sounds like begging to me,” he says amusedly, moving over to nibble on Draco’s other nipple.
He scrubs out the silver bowl and ladle with dragon-fire ash, crushes the wolfsbane and measures out the powdered silver to mix into it. Once he’s set the bowlful to mature under the shaft of moonlight, he washes out the valerian roots and starts slicing them up neatly.
Harry glared right back before shrugging exaggeratedly. “Fine,” he said without looking at him, using the remaining lube on his left hand to roughly coat his cock, shivering at his own touch. He then shuffled forward on his knees, leaning down to brace himself on one hand before pausing. “Like this?” he confirmed, one eyebrow raised, his heart feeling like it was about to explode inside him.
I don’t give a fuck; it’s not the first time he’s seeing me in just my boxers. “What do you want?”

played professionally for a bit, Potter, you know the importance of scoring as many goals as possible before the Snitch is caught.”
“You think you could carry one of those torches with you?”
“Use your free leg for a bit of momentum, Malfoy!” Professor Fox barks loudly. “Break his grip and push yourself into a roll.”
Weasley waits through Draco’s caustic rambling, his expression bored more than annoyed. “Are you done?” he finally asks.
Harry did not expect an actual answer, but asked anyway. “Can you produce a Patronus, Malfoy?”
“Potter, fuck,
“Ready to lose again tonight?” he asked cheerfully. “I bet I can beat you in eight moves or less.”
Well...
them. Things definitely aren’t as dark as he’s making them out to be.”
“I want to see,” Draco says simply. “Cast your Patronus for me.”
“I’m not taking the fucking job, Draco,” Harry growls warningly. “And this is why I didn’t tell you. I knew you’d jump at it like an excitable Crup at that prospect of me working in that fucking
Draco’s cock, sticky and half-hard, twitches and
you get involved if this isn’t even your child? How
Potter doesn’t need further encouragement, apparently, because with a groan of relief he draws his cock out and fucks back into Draco, free hand cradling Draco’s arse he saws in and out of him on a wild, rather uncontrolled rhythm. Draco is screaming his throat out, scrabbling at and raking his hands down Potter’s back, pressing his heels into Potter’s tailbone and savagely nipping at his clammy throat, Potter’s hips pistoning away frantically, crashing roughly into Draco’s groin.
The stands heaved, as if overcome by the breathtaking energy of the thronging students. The players shot through the air in streaks of cobalt blue and rich crimson, the Quaffle switching hands with electrifying speed, Beater bats smashing into Bludgers with enough force to send them rocketing around dangerously, each player’s face indecipherable from the other.
It was just the one word, barely sufficient, but Harry decided not to push for more.
He lets out a derisive huff. “What? Not going to let me crash here anymore?” His eyes are still shut and his chest is rising and falling as he pants softly. “I just want to know what I did wrong,” he says suddenly, so softly that I almost don’t catch it.
Scorpius went maroon in the face. Malfoy was staring very intently at Harry.
“Do you know him?” asked James.
As he watched the kettle come to a boil, Scorpius approached the other children. He seemed a slightly meek child, but wonderfully pleasant natured; Harry couldn’t help but think that Malfoy’s wife must be (or have been) a very nice woman – because obviously Malfoy himself couldn’t at all be responsible for such a sweet kid. Probably.
And fuck, but the bastard got Draco going when he did that. Even if it did make something twist in his chest.
“I don’t know,” Malfoy mumbles, “anything that moves and is remotely decent looking, probably.”
“So? Finally got what you wanted?” he continues sourly. “Can’t blame you, I suppose. Can’t blame anyone who wants to fuck a slut like that.” He pauses while my fingers tingle for my wand. “Wonder how long he’ll last with you before he gets bored of your heroic cock.”
understand why he’s unable to keep his eyes off him. Nothing about his current appearance is worth a second glance and yet, Harry sits, trying his hardest not to blink very often so he can stare at him that much longer. There’s a certain grace about Malfoy, a muted glow, and Harry is part confused and part mesmerised by him.
Potter snorts. “I know your face, Malfoy, I’ve stared unblinkingly at it for about four hours now.”
Angelina shifts in her chair with a groan, one arm curved around her large bump. “I’m not eating again until I’ve got this thing out of me.” George pats her rotund belly with a wide grin and she glares at him. “Did we just have a smug moment?” She narrows her eyes at him.
Malfoy smirked. “It’s interesting you ask me that because, as it happens, the Malfoys do in fact own the majority of Wiltshire.”
The Tempus he casts in his state of semi-consciousness informs him that it’s just past six AM and Draco immediately tears himself out of bed, swaying on the spot for a moment as his body struggles to register that he’s awake. He slams open his bedroom door and, stumbling only twice, marches down the corridor to Potter’s room — Potter’s back home, he can tell from the way the very walls of the house buzz with his magic.
for help with something like that?” Malfoy asks irritably, hitching the trailing scroll up off the floor as he scowls and throws his quill into the inkpot like a dart.
Harry yelped and hastily stuffed his prick back in, wincing as the zipper caught. Malfoy was on the other side of the water, leaning his shoulder on a tree, expression bland.
– he’s incredibly witty, surprisingly generous, prone to random outbursts of pure, belly-warming kindness, is pretty darn skilful at what he does and above everything else, is fiercely loyal.
Malfoy didn’t glare at Harry anymore; he didn’t spare an eye-roll when Harry was accosted by a bunch of giggling fifth years in the corridors or when meek first years requested him for his autograph. He didn’t ignore or avoid Harry either, no.

still not over the Veela thing, though,” he murmurs warmly. “It’s still overwhelming.”
“Never,” I say at once. I dunk another biscuit in my tea. It breaks off and plops to the bottom of my mug. “Perfect.”
“For Merlin’s sake, Father,” Malfoy starts exasperatedly.
“Your father was a dreadful show-off.”
Malfoy sighed irritably. “I don’t
know where to look for it.”
sweets and clothes and—and—” He inhales deeply, his palms and temples starting to bead with sweat, his gut twisting with the way his insides burn scorching hot. “Go knock up a whole bunch of people, Potter! Start a fucking collection of us, why don’t you? A collection of one-night-fucks! Then we’ll all gather in here every night and sing songs about the wonder that is Harry Potter with his super magical, Alpha sperm!”
“What do you want from me?!” Harry slams his fist on a siren red button and fresh cream, full-fat, thick and yellow starts to pour into the clean vessel.
“Hey,” he says, tugging on an earlobe before abruptly stepping forward and pointing eagerly behind Draco. “Look! That’s Ron and ‘Mione’s gift; neat, right?”
Harry swallows and nods awkwardly. “Thank you,” he says, trotting up the cracked front steps and pushing the broken door further open. The stairs creak beneath his feet as he climbs up, wondering if he’s walking into a trap of some sort because Malfoy cannot be living in this sort of—
I think about it in flashes, every now and then, all day, as we watch TV, play Exploding Snap and kiss like seventh years. I think about it as I spread him out in front of the hearth later that evening and eat him open. I think about it as he watches me leave to quickly pop into my flat the next morning, his reluctance to let me go clear in his eyes.
“Could you turn up the volume?” I nod towards the telly and drink more beer. Ron complies, increasing the volume by about two bars and then continuing over the chorused laughter of the studio audience in the show.
Harry rolled his eyes as he said, “Relax, Aberforth isn’t like that. He barely even acknowledges
“No, Malfoy, it’s not like--!” Harry hurries forward, placing one knee on the bed and grasping his cock. Excitement and relief of such immense magnitude fill him that he doesn’t quite register grasping his cock and half-shouting, “My cock! Look at my soft cock!” and waving the damp length in floppy circles at Malfoy.
Slowly, he wandered into the field, wandtip lit and held a few feet above the ground. He peered in the semidarkness, wondering if a Summoning charm would work.
Draco comes to a halt and stares long and hard at the door, throat going dry as he randomly imagines massive, red flames licking out from underneath, smoke billowing out in thick, black clouds.
“Tell me again how you don’t care,” Potter murmurs, voice barely rising above Draco’s own whisper.
; it’s not
Harry clicks his tongue irritably as he picks up his tea. “
Scowling, but looking resigned, he leans up for a kiss. My first instinct is to flinch away and look back wildly just in case Draco is watching. But I make myself lean forward and peck him on the mouth before Disapparating.
Harry lifted his head just enough to be able to look up at him – to check if Malfoy looked smug about the fact that he would be
“What are you asking me to do, Pans?” he murmurs. “Are you suggesting I never speak to him again? Stop all interaction with him?”
“But this is
I don’t answer him as I shove a forkful of sausage into my mouth. I can feel his gaze fixed firmly on me and chew steadily until I finally relent and look up, swallowing and then clearing my throat.
“But why would you invite him to

“You absolute

to look at Potter, not right now, when he’s (not) dressed the way he is, not when the current sight of him is making Draco’s heart race and, the hairs on his arms to stand on end and... Other things to start to stand on end too.
Draco shuts his Transfiguration text books, taps his finished essay to dry the ink and rolls it up neatly, putting away everything in his bag before silently getting to his feet and walking over.
making me do this.”
day, I am so fucking disappointed right now. I believe I’m about to throw a huge strop about it.”
He belly clenched with a mixture of excitement and apprehension when his gaze squarely met Malfoy’s; he was half-sitting up, his weight resting on his elbows as he gaze-glared at Harry with narrowed grey eyes.
The man simply smiles at Draco before looking over at Ron and me. “That ought to have pulled a muscle or two – you alright?” he asks me and something about the (what seems to be genuine) concern in his eyes
His legs feel weak and overused, quivering under him, and his hips are creaky and sore. His back aches, spine clicking dully every time he stretches it out, and the long tracks that have been scratched down the length of his back burn under the extreme heat.
“Yeah, it’s unpossible, James,” Albus said. But his voice trembled.
But Harry wasn’t about to give up on the idea; after he’d left Malfoy’s decrepit place that evening, despair and sympathy bubbling up inside him, he wondered rather wildly if he ought to just go back and simply throw Malfoy over his shoulder and bring him to Grimmauld, kicking and screaming.
“Settle down,” said Malfoy. But not unkindly. In fact, Malfoy simply looked fondly exasperated.
“I don’t want to leave without her!”
“You asked me to...get the fuck out of your face, as I recall,” Harry swallows hard, “Several times.”
, because the silver absorbs what’s required,” Draco repeats, rolling his eyes. “Practically nobody uses the powdered silver because it’s more expensive than all the other ingredients put together.”
“This was a bad idea, Potter,” Malfoy drawled, but his voice trembled a little and his jaw was clenched tightly.
There’s an odd, quiet buzzing inside his head as he heads downstairs, his mind curiously devoid of thought. He can’t think of a single thing to focus upon and give thought to, as one would expect to be doing after they spent a night in the secluded company of their lover in his werewolf form.
“How are you though? It’s been a while, Malfoy.”
“Yes,” Hermione confirms simply.
Draco, I realise.
He placed lube sticky hands under Malfoy’s knees and pressed them back onto his shoulders, planting his own knees firmly under his arse. With one hand, he reached down to line himself up, a nervous buzzing filling his head, Malfoy’s quick pants rather loud now.
There’s nothing idiotic about the kiss, though, and as their lips lock together, Draco wants to fill several volumes describing it and the instant, ecstatic explosions in his belly – preferably in Everlasting Ink.
“I don’t like him,” Potter says softly, but Draco can’t relax because Potter’s whole form is still alarmingly tight with displeasure, his face still drawn and carrying a slight hint of betrayal. “
.’ “You is visiting this humble abode after all. Kreacher wonder if you might.”
Next to him, Potter stifles a snort and when Draco whips him a glare, dips his head between raised shoulders, hurriedly rearranging his face. When he turns, Granger is looking between the two of them with a small, twinkly-eyed smile. A little flustered, Draco reaches out and grabs a little sugar toffee out the pink, glass bowl on Granger’s desk, unwrapping it and sticking it in his mouth before carelessly dropping the wrapper into Potter’s lap. Potter catches it gives him a little grin.
“Caesar,” Draco answers grumpily – Potter is kissing the cat’s face now, even as Caesar puts both his front paws on Potter’s face and holds him off. “He doesn’t like being cuddled,” Draco adds sulkily, as Potter settles down on the armchair in the corner, holding the now purring feline to his chest.
“Lube. Conjure some right now.” There was a soft whine and Harry shut his eyes, picturing Malfoy – long and blond, probably dressed in perfectly tailored clothes, fumbling around for his wand in a fucking toilet cubicle in some Muggle building with his pants around his knees, stunning, round arse exposed; his hand tightened around his cock. “Yeah?”
Potter kisses him, slow and deep and so
“Has it only?” Draco chews thoughtfully. “Feels like longer.” He pauses, giving us both conspiratorial looks. “I really like him.”
?!” Harry
“Why is he crying?”
for an embarrassing situation,” Malfoy gasps when Harry’s hands slide down and begin fumbling with Malfoy’s flies, peeling the clingy leather down the curve of his naked arse. “
Potter’s smile finally flickers a bit. “No,” he says, eyes glinting in warning.
“You want to humiliate me,” Draco blurts at once, one hand tightening reflexively around the cool glass of bottle of ink.
Draco registers the loud crash of skull against steel before he actually registers the pain blooming across the back of his head – Potter still has his arm shoved into his throat, his teeth bared, his nostrils flared. His arm is sweaty too, and is damp against Draco’s freshly washed skin, the fine dark hair pressed flat under the salty sheen. Draco can smell the musk of Potter’s sweat, a hint of his spicy antiperspirant under it, all thrown together with a hit of peppermint from the Toothflossing Stringmints he’d been sucking on all through training that day.
need you to do me any fucking
“I miss him,” admits Draco in a whisper.
“Malfoy,” he croaks, helplessly, guilt burning through him like acid, “Malfoy, I’m so, so
“Yes,” Potter replies, just as flatly.
It was getting cold again. Harry couldn’t bear listening to the word ‘dead’ over and over again.
Draco has a hard time hiding his grin of amused exasperation. “Potter, would you just drink the damn dose, already?”
“What’s this about?” Ron asks curiously. Neither of us answers him.
“What is it, Lily?” Draco asks softly, walking over and picking her up. She screeches hysterically at once, kicking at Draco’s chest and pounding her tiny fists into his throat as he walks over to the polished rocking chair by the window, Summoning the bottle of warm milk from the dresser as he sits down. “You’re
All these years later, Draco’s belly still clenches with heated excitement when Harry threads strong fingers through Draco’s hair and holds his head in a gentle but unyielding grip as they kiss, Draco surrendering wholly to both the kiss and to Harry himself. Draco doubts it’ll ever fail to thrill him inordinately when Harry has his way with him – with an easy sense of entitlement that Draco never has, and never will bother to challenge.
“I thought you said you got off work?”
This time the silence stretched on long enough for Harry to believe they’d laid the topic to rest. He wasn’t going to force Malfoy to learn how to cast a Patronus.
Malfoy rears up in shock, his hoarse gasp loud in the darkness, his nails raking down the naked brick wall in front of them as he scrabbles. Harry’s already fucking him steadily with his tongue, thrusting it in and out indelicately, and for so long, that by the time he pauses to give his aching jaw some respite, Malfoy’s cock has already started to leak onto the seat. Harry’s own cock, meanwhile, is steadily getting more and more painful as he keeps it confined as tightly as it is, while it’s as
“’m fine,” Malfoy interrupts, twitching as Harry’s teeth move further up to graze against the sensitive little cranny below his ear, sighing as his earlobe is then suckled at. “Should’ve known you’d be like this in bed too.”
Hermione lifts a hand to her mouth, eyes round with shock, and Harry pushes himself off the wall, jaw tightening automatically. “Who was he?” he asks, rage seeping into every pore of his being.
“That, Potter,” said Malfoy, “is what they call the million galleon question.”
“Which is why you should
“He couldn’t stop talking about you,” she says, and Draco starts slightly at the abrupt way she threw that in; his cheeks heat, and not entirely because of his proximity to the iron cauldron. “Now I see why,” she adds lightly, hitching her handbag higher up her shoulder, giving him a sly little smile.
“Fuck,” Malfoy wheezes, “Potter, fuck.” He’s wiggling and rutting, one foot now and then kicking at the ground as he slips down a little before being unceremoniously hauled higher by Harry.
you feel all right, Harry?” she’d asked repeatedly, until Harry and whirled around, glaring, the bulge in his jeans twitching menacingly at her.
Harry looked over James’ head and watched as Ginny wrestled a stack of clean sheets and thick blankets from the cupboard outside the bathroom and chuck them, with beautiful aim, into their trunk, as she dashed to grab their pillows off the bed. Harry would not have thought of all these things; this is why he’d asked her to do the packing.
“Sure,” Draco says, still not looking back at Potter.
“Oh my
“MUM?!”
“Malfoy.”
When he looks around, Harry is staring after it with an expression so thoroughly, comically gobsmacked that Draco bursts out laughing, heaving great big shouts of mirth that makes his sides hurt.
“I feel fine, Potter,” Draco hurries to say. “No need to call on Granger.”

“So... You were
The door thuds softly shut and there’s a brittle silence.
Swallowing hard once more, Harry looks away, mind whirring, unable to blink away the expression on Malfoy’s face just before he’d walked off – the look of someone who’d dared to hope after ages of deliberation, only to have their hopes immediately crushed.
someone out there for me.”
“Or would you rather we crawl like an octopod?”
Draco still has a tiny limp the next day, his knee throbbing whenever he shifts his weight to his left side or walked too fast. His hand aches as he makes notes in class, sore after the way Potter had bent it back on itself. His neck and shoulders and arms are knotted and painful from the way he and Potter had heaved and grappled, fighting to throw each other off.
“Both,” says Harry calmly. “But tell me why you lied first.”
“I do what?”
It’s nothing like Draco imagined it would be – Draco doesn’t think he’s even capable of imagining something so formidably phenomenal, doesn’t think his mind can stretch that far. The way Harry fills Draco up, fills his whole being up, extends beyond just the physicality of Harry’s cock in Draco’s arse – Draco feels a fullness, an intangible sense of completion that brings about the realisation that he hadn’t even known until now, how incomplete he’d been all this while.
Two days after the Witch Weekly article, Draco reads the Prophet over breakfast, his heart about to dive out his mouth and into his porridge, his hands shaking where they’re clenched in the newspaper.
When Harry’s fingers moved up the inside of his thigh, Malfoy’s breath left him in a shuddering exhale and there was a soft

“Do whatever you want, Potter,” Draco rasps, his throat dry as parchment.
“Ginny,” Harry called, striding across the kitchen and flinging the cotton curtains aside.
Once inside, the smell is even worse and Draco lifts one gloved hand up to his face, clamping it lightly over his nose and mouth. He glances around and sees several large portraits, all of them hung shut with thick lengths of black velvet. There are about three candles sputtering on three different brass, snake shaped sconces on the wall, which is in turn covered in grubby, Victorian style wallpaper in deep green and silver.
I watch the way one pale eyebrow hitches its way up his forehead under his blond fringe as he notes the ciggy hanging between my fingers – he’s never approved. I’d given it up
Lily looked thoughtful. Then, “Daddy coming with us?”

, but I expect a quality present, Potter,” Draco said, sniffing snootily before immediately ruining the effect by planting a wet kiss on Harry’s cheek.
Draco doesn’t respond anymore, sitting in still silence for several minutes, his brain feeling sluggish and overworked suddenly as he recalls, in intricate detail, the astonishingly perfect evening they’d had on his birthday. Potter had planned and taken Draco out on a Parisian
“Did you hear me?” he asks softly, his nose in Malfoy’s hair; it smells of fresh sweat but there’s the lingering sweetness that Malfoy seems to carry about his person all the time.
“We could,” Harry says hoarsely, gulping before adding, “But not for a quick fuck that we’d likely then regret for the rest of our lives.” When Malfoy doesn’t reply he goes on, “Risks can be taken, but for something meaningful, Malfoy.”
Draco sighed again. “Harry, we’ve been over this—”
now anyway.
“Disputable,” Draco says, taking another sip of cider, but readily accepting the wet kiss Harry plants on his temple. “This has got to be the dullest birthday celebration I’ve ever been to, Weasley, congratulations.”
Harry shakes his head; or rather just jerks it against the pillow. “It’s already healed, I think; it just throbs a bit now. I always end up twisting a crack into a bone or two while transforming.”
“A while.” Hermione shrugs.
Potter’s body quakes, a rough sound leaving him as he shuts his eyes and drops his face back into Draco’s neck. “Fuck,” he mutters, stopping his mindless grinding with what seems to be a huge effort.
was in control of the situation, not him. Even as he kicked Potter away and turned over, wordlessly daring Potter to fuck him, it felt like
“I thought Wolfsbane is only consumed during the week leading up to the full moon,” Draco says enquiringly.
“Malfoy, stop being an immature little shit,” Harry snapped, standing up and holding out a hand. “Get the fuck up so I can take you to Pomfrey.”
Instantly turning hot all over, Draco almost hurls the wooden box at him before turning away with a huff as a grin of mortified thrill spreads across his face. “
, the ends dipped in molten chocolate – towards Draco.
“Well,” Hermione sighs, “nothing to do but wait, I suppose.”
“Hi,” he said hoarsely. “Hi, Malf-ack!” He suddenly relapsed into coughing and Draco stood there and seriously considered putting Potter out of his misery and just rejoining his friends.
“Yes, well, I didn’t think you’ll actually

Malfoy shrugged again, thumbing the burnished gold hilt of his sword. “A while.”
“When did you get back?” he asks as Harry crawls on and throws himself next to him, immediately placing a hand over his tummy.

“And from what I last heard, you’re not an Auror anymore.”
“Yes, but
“Harry, what the fuck is going on with you tonight?” He doesn’t sound angry – just bewildered. And a tiny bit like he wants to laugh at me.
“Better yours than mine,” he says, lips brushing Harry’s sweaty temple. “This is why I didn’t want to sit on your cock.”

rather not, thanks,” I’ve shot back before I can reign myself in to answer more diplomatically. Draco now looks astonished
“You do realise I am an Auror?”
“Fuck,” Draco mutters, hurriedly catching himself with one hand on the wall, the alley swimming around him as that last tumbler of scotch finally hits him. The brick under his hand is grainy and unyielding, grazing the softness of Draco’s palm. Potter’s head bobs back and forth, his lips turning pinker with each second he spends ravenously sucking Draco down.
“Oh, so you won’t tell me where you’re going in case we follow you and you’re saddled with the responsibility of saving my arse again?”
, to move in here with him. Potter and he sleeping in the same bed and living like an actual couple, Draco never once feeling like he doesn’t belong here.
“Still want to read to it?” he asks quietly, voice thick and grainy with sleep.
“Why?” he asks finally.
let me come, Draco!”
“Because you love him?”
Potter is
“Fuck,” he whimpers under his breath as Harry makes a rough sound and fucks up into him on a completely unrestrained buck. When Harry’s hands scrabble wildly at the sheets and then slap onto Draco’s thighs, he takes him by the wrists, hunching over to hold them pinned above Harry’s head and, in the same move, lock their mouths together.
, Potter!”
“I...met a guy,” Draco says eventually, “It was about a year after the War; we were both taking the same diploma course – Potions,” he adds when Potter frowns enquiringly. “Richard and I—well, it was new for me, he was my first relationship and he was rather irresistibly charming and well...I slipped, I guess.”
“What?” Potter blinks. And then, warily, “Okay...how?”
Draco’s stomach does another flip. “Because we complicated things,” he replies, voice unsteady.
And so the day after the full moon, Draco finds himself standing outside a truly awful looking mansion in Islington. The name Grimmauld Place brought about the same stirrings that the old house-elf had, and Draco is surprised as to how easily he’d found the place.
“I know, but Malfoy’s a bloke, isn’t he?” Ron says. “Are you into him, then?” he repeats.

Ron shrugs. “I suppose, yeah. My great-grand uncle lived to be about a hundred and eighteen, I think. I dunno what happened to his family though.”
Draco has gotten so used to just
“Come up here,” he says coolly and Potter looks rather taken aback.
, throws Draco off kilter for a moment. He regards Potter in silence, taking in the way he stood there, tall and effortlessly graceful, hair falling into his face, expression pleasant but carrying that hard edge Draco’s noticed since term began.
“You mean
“What for?” Draco asks, equally softly, as he makes his way over to him, slow and unimposing as he approaches and then sinks down beside him, sitting sideways with one knee on the sofa so he can face Harry.

He’d known, he’d
I look up, startled. “Ginny?”
“Such an arse,” he hears Harry mutter on a laugh, and turns, lewd retort on the tip of his tongue before he abruptly reigns himself in and sticks his face back into his coffee. When he sneaks a glance, Harry is darting him a curious, thoughtful look and Draco feels his face heat some more.
“It’s
“Pervert,” Malfoy snarls at him. “You think I’m going to undress in front of you?”
, with the lube!”
The headboard is slippery beneath Draco’s sweaty hand as he clenches at it, tightening his fist around their cocks and whimpering against one bronze, saliva-shiny nipple. Potter undulates against him like they’ve done this a thousand times, like they’d not spent their teens despising the very sight of one another, like he’d not almost killed Draco in a girls’ bathroom, and like Draco had never looked into his puffy, misshapen face and claimed he didn’t know who he was.
on the dance floor, I'm gr—” He breaks off on a strange, gulping sound, cheeks going from pink to crimson as he clamps his mouth shut and takes a huge swig of beer.
Malfoy’s gaze, fixed on the way Harry’s holding up his trunk, snaps up to his in a flat glare. “That better be a fucking joke, Potter,” he says dangerously.
Malfoy is sat right at the very back of the endlessly long room, and as Harry bursts out of one of the aisles, looking around rather wildly, having been slightly worried that he’d be forever lost in this maze of whispering books, Malfoy looks up from the long, curling scroll he’s scribbling on, eyes widening in genuine surprise at the sight of Harry before narrowing in characteristic suspicion.
“Awfully sure about that, are we?” Draco deadpans. “So confident I’m going to have significant wealth to my name again, eventually?”
“I do not need an

?” Malfoy instantly shoots back, narrowing his eyes at the cluster of loudly cackling women in the middle of the enormous, oval field.
“I’ll say what I like, Potter,” Draco says, chuckling breathily, one hand reaching down to claw over Harry’s arse cheek. “You going to start moving any time soon? Sometime before New Year’s, perhaps?”
