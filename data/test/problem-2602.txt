Draco groaned and settled back onto the ground, each ragged breath making one of Draco’s sides throb.
They were now in view of the water pump.
"He's good?"
"Sure," Anthony replied, but his nose wrinkled with distaste.
“You what?” No!
“Why would I hate you? It was Anthony and Terry. Something about the House Cup, but Harry... I think of you... you are... you’re… my best friend, okay?" His face felt uncomfortably warm again.
Nil must’ve seen Draco’s shift of emotion because he narrowed his eyes angrily, his nostrils flaring. “Freak.” Fletcher spat, pushing off Crabbe and Goyle’s hands and stomping through them, going further and further down the train opposite of where Harry and Draco were heading. The blond turned to see Harry’s brow knit in question but Draco shook his head.
“What could we say, Draco?!” Terry asked. “We didn’t want to meddle!”
"Not because of them. You're kind of famous, you know? There's not many 'Harry's in the Wizarding world."
“Says who?”
“It’s Ron’s pet rat. Scabbers they call him.” Draco answers tiredly as he laid him down on his four-poster bed.
“You expect me to wear the horrid thing I have? No way! Everyone's going to have normal ones. Even Harry has normal ones.” Ron grabbed Draco’s shoulders. “Mate, they smell like my great aunt Tessie."
"I'm going to get my wand."
Tonks and Draco reached the door when footsteps thumped towards them. Harry stopped in the hallway, puffing out a short breath.
“Tell that to the car
“I… might’ve.”
(See the end of the chapter for
“Uh, to other students. I wasn’t worried about your experience with injuries.”
Draco looked down at it with confusion. “What are you doing?”
Draco was seething. Does everyone want to ignore him? To think that they knew better? To think Draco was just being foolish? To pretend they care? He made a frustrated noise as he paced around his room, but his anger didn’t wain. Merlin, he wanted to throw something.
"Draco, when are you going to learn, my friend?" Terry shook his head. "People have friends for a reason. To talk to, to help out with one another, to cheat on homework with--or so I've heard," he added hastily at Draco's frown.
“I’m the not best person, either.”
Draco felt his nerves strain worse and worse as February approached and the second Triwizard task was upon them.
Draco was about to start talking about the current standings for various national Quidditch teams when he saw Severus Snape walking towards them. He stopped instinctively and said a pleasant, “Professor.”
of all people would know that, right?”
"Draco, it's fine," said Harry. "The basilisk is dead and Riddle is gone." Harry pointed towards the dead snake and dropped the dairy into his lap, the fang-sized hole gaping in the middle. "He's gone, Draco."
“Why would you say something like that?!” Harry asked suddenly, shifting away from Draco. “I know what I heard. How could you even think of defending him?”
Anthony furrowed his brow as he unfurled his paper. He gasped as his eyes blew wide. “What the--How does she know?! This was just last night!”
Terry opened his mouth, paused, then closed it. “Alright, I stand by your decision. Are you doing okay?”
They stopped walking so Harry could look back at the boy. The corners of Draco's mouth was lifted up. Harry abruptly realised that he and Draco were
Tonks kissed the top of his head. “Now, get some rest.” she cradled his jaw and brushed his hair out of his face. “I’ll see you this summer.”
“Fine, but we're still going to find a way around this," Ron promised, digging out a homemade sandwich out of his pocket and unwrapping it.
“Mrs. Weasley apologizes if Errol makes a fool out of himself,” Narcissa added as a disclaimer. "She also apologizes if the jumper's too long."
"It's a cruel world out there, Harry." Lockhart placed the truck beside the others. "Now," Lockhart's elegant wand was picked up from his desk. "I'm afraid I'm going to have to erase your memories. Can't have you exposing me, I'll never sell another book."
Draco let his gaze dart to the posters hung up on the wall and the school trunk that had wrinkled clothes and spellbooks spilling from it.
“I have... no idea.” Draco snorted. “Why do
"I'm going to see what section he was in," said Weasley. He came back a minute later with a pile of books in his arms, slamming them onto the table. "Dragons! Hagrid was looking up stuff about dragons!" Golden letters glittered on various volumes on the depicting the word.
“Well, it’s not like I liked our family that much anyway,” Andromeda said. “I was willing to leave.”
The Great Hall filled with Hufflepuffs and Slytherins, all in various stages of confusion and annoyance. The Ravenclaws wasted no time to tell their friends about the Black break-in attempt.
"Hurry, we have to get you out of here. Ron should be here--"
"Hello, Ron, Harry," he smiled then he saw the blond. "Draco, right? Shouldn't you be on at your own table?"
“Draco, do you know?”
"Right," she straightened with a sniff. "That gets rid of
"What?" The blonde forgot that they were here for books.
Even now, Draco knew that there was a slim possibility that someone could actually care for him like that. Him, an apprehensive asocial that had too many sorrows that he was only beginning to sort through.
"It was sent recently so I guess you didn't know."
"Who could've stolen it in the first place? Only a Gryffindor could know the password," Hermoine said when Harry sat down with her in the Common Room.
. All he did would laugh at others and spend a lot of time alone in the cold dungeons. Glancing at Slytherin table, he saw Crabbe and Goyle stuffing their faces.
“How would it work?” Cho asked with a furrowed brow.
Draco turned back to Harry. His stomach turned over as he turned away towards the window. “Well, I’m not exactly the best outlet.”
Mr. Weasely came down the stairs, alerting the group. “Draco, my boy." He clapped the blond's shoulder. "Why don’t you come back to the tent with us?”
"Do you know anyone who might be?"
EDIT: I did some research (not really) and decided to throw in what Ravenclaw Tower looks like.
“Harry,” Draco only said.
“We would like for your cooperation along with you three for the Second Task.”
“I’ll see you on the train then, Draco?” Harry asked.
Draco walked into the kitchen one morning to see a new picture tacked onto the fridge. A girl with spiky hair was winking at the camera while Mad-Eye Moody grimaced, seeming to try to pose seriously.
“Er,” Draco hesitated. “Will do.”
Draco peered through the doors and found his mother’s back ridged as his father stared out the window, motionless. His reflection showed hollows were developing under his eyes.
Heady feelings were still constricting Draco’s chest and stomach as they returned to Ravenclaw Tower. He could
The drawing room was filled with voices. Draco stopped suddenly, thinning his lips as he peered around the corner.
; he just didn’t know what to do
“Viktor Krum is not going to ask Hermione. It's Viktor Krum!”
“Draco, we’re heading out to the Halloween feast. Are you coming?” Anthony was fiddling with his hair, Terry and Michael already at the dormitory door, ready to leave.
"Are you telling me you aren't seeing this!?"
“Your smile’s beautiful,” Harry blurted out.
"Wouldn't kill you to pick up a book instead of copying from one of us," Draco said, rereading chapters in his Defense the Dark Arts textbook.
Harry was mentally preparing for Oliver Wood to yell after the Quidditch match, because his mind was in dozens of places and he knew that he was going to completely lose for his team. However, before Harry could get to a high altitude, McGonagall appeared with another student by her side on the field.
"Draco, what are you talking about-"
Harry shook his head. “I really don’t mind. I figured it’d be a long shot.”
Trelawney’s gaze passed over the blond’s face before she swept away, wiping tears under her glasses and sniffed wetly. She continued her introduction with ease as if she didn’t leave Draco to calm himself silently at the table with a thudding, panicked heart. Her request to do tea leaf readings seemed laughable at that point.
“'Dromeda!" Edward's voice chided.
Fleur, as promised, was waiting at the bottom of the staircase. Her white-jewelled speckled bodice flowed into her silver-grey satin dress with a matching chiffon shawl. Her golden blonde hair fastened in a star-like hairpin.
Ron’s eyes blew wide as he slammed his hands on the table and stood. “HERMIONE, WILL YOU GO TO THE BALL WITH ME?” His voice echoed in the quiet common room.
“Terrence!” A woman’s voice called.
“You don’t need to protect him, son, I’ve already sent a complaint to the Ministry to have that beast put on trial and if all goes well, that creature will be gone by the end of the year.”
Lupin’s back broadened, tearing his robes, his spine jutting out as his skin began to thicken with fur. His shoes splitting apart from sharp nails, his gaping mouth filling with pointed teeth, pupils expanding to animalistic black.
Scabbers was still well alive as Halloween morning arrived. He was still in Draco’s care and the blond was still indifferent to him after all the nights he slept on Draco's nightstand. Draco wondered how Ron had such an attachment to a rat that didn’t do anything.
His stomach tightened. He didn't like the sound of that.
It was as if Draco and Harry had repelling entities around them.
Moody gave him a long look. “I spoke to Professor Trelawney the other day." He began circling Draco. "She says you’re proficient in Divination. Says you have a real gift for it.”
"No,” Harry coughed. “I feel nothing. I can't feel anything."
! And let’s not forget the
“No, er—Professor, can’t I do something else?”

He shook his head. That wasn’t what he was talking about. “My parents... my father..."
those.”
So what did happen?
“Nonsense! Hippogriffs are righ’ gentle. They’re really just beautiful, magnificent, gentle creatures.”
“I bet Bill or Charlie never had such a year. And, look! We won the House Cup!" He was practically bouncing in his seat.
“Right,” Draco cleared his throat. “Yes, that’s right. I don’t know why I asked that. Forget I said anything.”
“Yes.”
“Wouldn’t be so sure about that,” Granger said and Weasley’s face dropped. “These ingredients are very rare.” She took the potion book back. “Plus, some need to be collected at a certain time. Like fluxweed needs to picked at the full moon and lacewings need to be stewed for twenty one days….”
"Oh look, we're here." Dumbledore stopped in front of the Hospital Wing's oak doors.
! Right in front of us! After mentally scarring me, he makes us go to bed--just to pull us out to tell you were in the Hospital Wing without a
“Of course not, Ronald.” Hermione snapped. “I meant like a family member. Is there anyone who could be related to Black?” Hermione glanced over to the huddled small groups of Ravenclaws.
"It's nothing. Don't ask." Draco said flatly and he sat far from the rest of the boys, still taking deep breaths.
“I mean, I can ask later—“
Draco’s hand was wrapped around Harry’s fist, a moment too late to win.
He stepped on the platform and he could hear Hagrid gathering up the first years as the other years went up to the castle to get into the carriages.
Michael started to pick up Draco from the ground before promptly dropping him at the sight of blood. “That’s a lot of blood.” Michael gagged and let Terry and Anthony crowd Draco.
“You were
The next morning had students buzzing and only Granger was seen at the Gryffindor table. Roger Davies was talking to the Ravenclaws that Harry Potter and two first years he hangs out with went to the third floor that was strictly
"So, Draco, what do you need to talk with Harry about that it couldn't wait till the party tomorrow?” Sirius asked as he slid into a chair.
“Oh, right,” Ron gently took his rat back, keeping the wiggling rodent close to his chest. “Thanks for watching him all this time. Harry’s still asleep but I can get Hermione—“
“I’m just—happy. I don’t know how else to explain it. I’ve never had a summer as great as this one before. It feels like everything’s coming together. I just…” Harry trailed off as his gaze settled on Draco.
Harry sighed and laid back on the floor, still grasping onto the frustration from his interrupted dream. He rubbed his hands over his face, feeling an underlying burn in his cheeks. This was getting out of hand. Way too out of hand
” Harry reached up to grasp at Draco’s shoulders…
Draco turned and ran towards the door. He needed to get to Harry, Snape, Dumbledore—someone!
“He didn’t even take points away.” Harry stage-whispered when the boys started walking once more. “We broke the rules and didn’t even get punished for it.” Harry looked over at Draco as if he was a mythical creature. “It’s never
“Bugger off, Nil. I’m not asking again.” Harry said forcefully and pushed passed the surprised Slytherin boy, Draco following closely behind him.
"No!" Draco said out loud, trying to stop himself from another memory attack. Anthony and Micheal stopped their conversation. “I mean—I haven’t seen anything like that.” Some other Ravenclaws were looking at him from his shout. He glanced all over the field. “Oh look—Dumbledore came to watch!" That caused all eyes to move away from him.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Of course, Father," Draco mumbled. “I remember each and every expectation.”
“Why’re looking at me when you say that?” Ron called after him.
The Ravenclaw door burst open. Dozens of giddy third years poured into the common room, disturbing the previous silence Draco had for studying.
a crazed murderer?” Terry asked after Draco told them what happened.
Anthony looked over the banner. "Where's the 'A' in her last name?”
him...
“...Yes.”
“I didn’t help him!”
That got Ron riled up immediately and Harry broke his quill.
“No time, Harry! Maybe some other time!”
"Draco--!" Snape called out and Draco was a few paces away from the Potions classroom when he heard a quiet
“How’s your summer going?” Harry asked, hitching up his filled bucket against his chest.
"Thank you Mr and Mrs Boot," Draco nodded before taking up a fork and knife. “Why didn't you wake me?” Draco hissed to Anthony.
A conceited part of him wanted to ask if Harry still liked him. But he couldn't do that. Draco inherently thought of low expectations when he was thinking about this conversation. Harry already said he’d try to move on from him. He was the one that told them they were going to stay as friends.
“Ted, who was it?” A woman called out.
"Let him have his moment, Hermione," Draco said. "Who knows when it will come again?"
Anthony still looked half-asleep, his eyes not even open. He pointed to the window where a bird silhouette moved. “Owl,” he said. With that, he turned around and crawled back into his bed.
Draco was once more pulled into the busy grounds, food-scented smoke from outside campfires made their mouths water, booming live music from each tent battled which can be the loudest, a few wizards having the confusing task of setting up their tents “the Muggle way," there was a scuffle between an Irish supporter and a Bulgarian supporter about infringing on each other's camping space.
“Sorry,” Draco waved a hand. “Just remembering something Harry said about Michael’s spelling habits on the train.”
“What? No—I just mean—who sent it?” Harry was fumbling with his words. Harry stopped looking at the letter and finally realised the puddle of ink his bag was making and set it down on the floor to repack. As Harry took out the dripping textbooks and quills, Draco finally felt pity and started helping him.
They both turned back to Draco.
"My son, talking with the Dark Lord... the
Feeling embarrassed, he turned his attention somewhere else and found Fletcher Nil glaring daggers at him. Right, he was the crush of the girl
"Gone?" he muttered, trying to get to back on his feet.  "You killed the basilisk?" he asked when he found the sword in Harry's hand.
“I’m not over you. Of course I’m not.”
Draco glanced down at his feet, clearly within the Age Line and clearly hasn’t been forced out.
“That doesn’t make it better!” Narcissa rushed out. “You were my sister. And I let them hate you for trying to be happy. I should’ve at least tried something. You never got to see the family ever again.”
“Tsk, tsk on that poor door, am I right?” A voice cackled overhead. Peeves hovered above the crowd, lying on his back with his legs crossed and arms tucked behind his head.
Draco felt himself tip his chin upward to show his dignity. “Yes, Mother, I’ll be careful. You can trust me.” He liked that his parents have taken a more... ‘emotional investment’ in him after the Chamber of Secrets Incident, but the coddling had to stop.
Harry brightened. “It is?”
He even called Draco out of his room to get a new ink bottle from a cabinet that was across the room Lucius himself was in.
Draco shook his head. Merlin, he was getting maudlin about a family owl.
Aunt Andromeda smiled, satisfied and busied herself with refilling her cup.
He pointed his wand—once again—at Potter’s forehead which made the other boy's breath hitch and his eyes go wide. "Relax. I'm not going to hurt you." Without warning, Draco muttered, "
"Grrr," Michael grumbled. "You're smart
"A likely story."
“Thank!” Gabrielle piped up.
Draco bitterly thought. Still, she continued. "Change takes time and it takes work. And not everyone is going to see it right away. But one of the hardest things of changing yourself is making sure that you yourself are aware that you are making that change. And it's not for others, love. It shouldn't matter about other people’s opinions. You don't need people's approval to be kind or helpful. It’s for yourself. For yourself to know that you’re doing you’re best and that you’ve grown. And you've grown
“That’s not the point! The point is that Harry Potter is not supposed to have feelings like that. Not for me.”
“It’s just that Tonks doesn’t seem like the person that would respect a man like Moody. She says he always looked after her but..." Draco shook his head. "I don't know."
“But that wouldn’t make sense because I
“I mean all you do is sleep nowadays,” Michael reasoned. Harry, Weasley and Granger also stood by him as well.
him Harry). How did he go from that to
"Shush, Draco." As Draco gave him a bewildered eyes, Harry edged closer in his seat closer to Hagrid.
Trelawney’s shriek snapped him out of his rose-tinted thoughts. Harry’s cup was in a white-knuckled grip as she clasped a hand on Harry’s startled shoulder. There was a grim in Harry’s cup. A Grim means an omen of death she explained shakily, gaping at Harry as if he was already dead.
And it filled him with terror.
Potter stared up at them, looking properly defeated. "Yeah?"
Granger didn't joke when it came to exams. She kept nagging the other three to start working out study schedules and color coding their notes.
Honestly, it still boggles my mind that such talented people decided to create something for this story or share this story on other platforms like thank you so much for these amazing creations from over these years!
“And this time, with all this new evidence, Pettigrew can’t
"I'm fine I'm just--" Harry's eyes roamed the pub and settled on the entrance. Harry's eyes widen in surprise. Draco turned to see what it was.
Draco and Lucius were in Knockturn Alley. At first, Draco would've boasted that he was allowed in the shadiest part of Wizard London, now, he knew that everything down here should not be treated like an honour and more like a sickening secret.
“Would I ever want to do what?” The blond repeated.
His eyes were blood red.
“Ginny Weasley?”
“I don’t believe that.” Granger getting cold feet, give me a break. "I know for a fact that Millicent doesn't sound like that." Days in the Slytherin Common Room burned her gruff voice into a distant part of his brain. Minutes ticked by, the silence never wavering. Minutes…minutes… Draco was leafing through the potion book when Granger gave a strangled groan.
"Of course, sir."
“That’s why you said it was a misunderstanding…” Harry whispered. Draco never saw Harry’s face look so betrayed. “You were helping him…”
since the first day. It couldn’t all be a coincidence.
Draco lost his footing trying to walk off the stool. Small arms caught his even smaller body.
Ted tried to show Draco popular ‘films’ at home with VHS tapes but Draco got distracted at the shiny, smooth strips he could pull at. (He wasn’t allowed near the VHSs again.)
“Alright! Alright! I yield.” Harry managed through his guffaws.
"You've been ignoring Harry and them. They miss you, especially Harry." Draco's face burned in embarrassment. "What's wrong? Did they do something?"
“We can forge it--I mean, like Fred and George--”
“What?”
“No, not really.” Draco backpedalled. “It’s very bad.”
"That Harry likes--" He still can't even finish saying it
“No, there’s this creature right here,” Draco said, looking up and down at its body.
Draco made a face. “No?”
"There’s a potion we’re making." Granger held out a moldy looking book and started turning its yellow pages. “The steps and ingredients are insanely complex and we—mostly I— wanted to ask for your help to make it. I’ve seen the grades you get in Potions. It’ll be easy for us if you helped.” She held out the book to him and Draco saw a long list of ingredients with ‘POLYJUICE POTION’ written in faded ink.
Anthony snorted. “How embarrassing for you.”
While Granger and Weasley’s eyes widen for one reason, Draco’s did so for a whole other reason.
“What brings you here, Potter?” Michael asked, leaning back and crossing his arms in an attempt to look cool. He flipped his bangs in a dramatic flair.
Draco rolled his eyes as the two firmly shook on it.
Moody started to go down the corridor before his clunking metal boot stopped. “Mister Malfoy. I know you’re there. Come out now."
He brought the butterbeer bottle to his lips to avoid answering.
Draco turned to Harry. “You really haven’t been having nightmares?”
good pureblood in this house. You deserve to be on the tapestry, yes.”
Shakily, Draco climbed back into bed. It couldn’t be Sirius Black. Why would it be? Draco doubted that he paid attention to family lineage, and he hasn’t been near Harry in weeks. Scabbers cried out again.  Hastily, he gathered the frightened rat, trying to soothe him.
On the day before the next Hogsmeade trip, before the holiday break, Draco walked down to the study hall for his weekly study session with Harry. (Draco had indeed kept the promise of helping Harry out with homework.)
“Absolutely! We know you. You never would’ve done that to Hagrid.”
Buckbeak’s pupils shrunk as he reared up, his talons sharpened and screeched loudly. He stood tall on his back legs before raising his claw and swung down.
say that term ended somewhere around the 19th which means Anthony had to celebrate/observe Hanukkah before the term ended.

If any can give support to the victims of the Tree of Life Synagogue shooting and their families, it can be donated through a
"Oh, why not?" Fred snickered.
“What? He bit me,” Draco said.
“You don’t seem all that happy to have it back. The air around you is distressed and went fuzzy.”
“Yes, Mother?” Draco rose up, rubbing his eye.
“I will not disappoint you again."
Draco’s steps faltered, turning back to the boy. “Why?”
It was a much brighter day than when Slytherin and Gryffindor Quidditch match occurred and Ravenclaw was celebrating their victory. Draco was breathless, buzzing with excitement. Merlin, he hasn’t played a game in years. It felt good. The Ravenclaw team moved away from their Seeker and Micheal, Terry, and Anthony came upon him instantly.
“Good.” Harry withdrew his hand. “I, er, I think I hear Sirius calling for me.” He awkwardly walked around Draco to get to the door.
"What? No way. You've seen her notes when you pass her in the Common Room, right? Doodles of badgers.
. Draco smirked, but quickly put on a blank face before anyone saw.
"Mr. Malfoy?" A sharp voice almost made him run into the wall again.
Draco lowered his hands. “It would be something.”

in the common room. Draco would see all these relationship rituals happening around him and sometimes--sometimes--wonder how it feels. To be beloved in such a way.
"Flourish and Blotts. Needs all these 'Lockhart' books." His fingers were getting tired of holding the journal too tight.
“You’re joking!” Ron wheezed.
Draco looked at the scene with a smile on his face before he got up from the pile. He tiptoed around the sleeping boys to get downstairs. He crept into the living room to get on the large window seat Draco noticed on arrival.
Draco turned on his side and closed his eyes to force sleep. There was a sudden sense that he was being watched. Draco opened his eyes and Harry hurriedly turned away from him to face the other direction. The blonde went to lay on his back, staring at the Great Hall’s starry night sky.
His breath wavered when the train shrieked to a stop. As soon as he stepped outside that door, he was going to be faced with his father.
“No, Draco. Listen. You’re amazing, I’ve never seen a wizard like you before.”
“You certainly could! I can make up a bed in Ronald’s room right now—“
Hermione spluttered, going pink. "Who says
The Hogwarts population's speechlessness transformed into amazed gasps and awes as Durmstrang students in fur-lined red capes marched in with spinning poles and creatures of flames circled the hall. There was an extra surprise when Viktor Krum entered with Durmstrang’s headmaster, Igor Karkaroff.
“Terry!" Anthony almost shrieked. "Blimey, you scared me.”
you have to do.)
Friend. Friend.
A long pause.
The buzz of Sirius Black still held the castle’s interest the following days. Wild theories developing from every house and Draco not even having an idea of how Black broke in the first place. The bronze eagle door was healed and repainted the morning after, but that still made students uneasy. The teachers to proceed with classes as usual, and ever since the first day of class, Professor Trelawney doted on Draco, much to his displeasure.
"Alright, I'm taking your word for it. Bye, Harry. You need some rest to be at the End of the Year feast and I don’t want to get caught by Madam Pomfrey. I’ll be looking for you.” He saw Harry wave slowly and he turned around. A loud
"That's none of your business."
“How about you watch it!” Anthony shouted at him. “Actual prick, he is.”
"Oh... you look like a first year."
"Are you familiar with phoenixes, Draco?” A new voice came in the room. Dumbledore was at his office door, a gentle smile twitching his beard upwards. “You do not seem that shocked to see a bird spontaneously combust.”
." Anthony cracked a doubtful smile. "No, he didn’t. Potter wouldn’t--”
“I don’t think we know how.” Terry finished.
“From what I’ve heard,” Ron started. “Black’s family is one of those crazy pureblood traditionalists. Strictly Slytherins. I’m sure Black was Slytherin, too. There’s no way someone related to him would be in Ravenclaw.”
"Harry, it was Tom, I--I tried to tell you at breakfast, but I couldn't--it's the diary--I'm such an
“You know any of the Unforgivable Curses? I know that your father--oh, your
Snape’s eyes snapped back to the boy but he didn’t say anything about his interruption. “Yes, he said he’d like a chance to speak to the both of you privately.”
Draco pinched a thin amount of pages and flipped the textbook open. He still landed in the introduction and was going to repeat the process when he caught a long paragraph on the page.
He looked around to see he was alone, the torches were burning low and that he was in his pyjamas. Draco felt a strange sense of déjà vu, like he’d been in this situation before, but he couldn’t remember when or why.
“What happened?”
“Really! I’ve forgotten! Honestly, if she’s all you talk about then I pity Ginny.”
"I never wanted this to happen." His body felt like lead.
Draco looked down the table before to catch Harry laughing. He leaned back at once. "Of course it is. So we don't need to talk about it anymore."
Draco felt his frustration abruptly seep out. He moved his hands to drag them over his face.
Far away from Grimmauld Place, Draco smoothed down a red and black long-sleeved shirt in front of his mirror, making Bulgaria’s Quidditch crest properly visible. After a once-over and running a quick hand through his hair, he went over to his bed to gather up the various letters spread across it.
“I can… talk to you about all these… things?” Draco’s writing was slow, his thoughts all jumbled that he couldn’t tell what to put on paper or what to keep for himself.
Harry, Parvati Patil, and Ron were idling outside the entrance of the Yule Ball.
"Hogwarts arrived today? Wonderful, love! What's the permission slip for?"
"How are you here?"
"You and Draco don't even need to study. You both know everything!" Weasley moaned.
“Yeah, we looked everywhere. What are you doing?” Goyle inquired.
"Two?" Draco saw Luna get polite clapping as she went to sit at the Ravenclaw table, far from where he was sitting.
“Draco,” Potter said.
"As soon as I find the Weasleys," Harry said.
“Draco!”
Professor Vector paced around the front of the classroom. Her heels clicking rhythmically against the flagstone, red robes smoothing behind her. She had the sophisticated look of an intelligent witch with her black hair knotted into a formal braid at her neck and with her shoulders pushed back with refined practice. Her sharp eyes enforced her “no-nonsense” aura. Her wand suddenly slipped out of her sleeve and into her hand and she waved it lazily. A stick of chalk rose and started writing on the board. The chalk created a chart with a sophisticated compilation of numbers and letters.
“It’s not you, Draco. Ron and I are sort of fighting ourselves—“ Hermione hurried to explain.
“Which means scared, Potter.” In an attempt to follow the trend, Draco went in to hug Harry. “It’s great to see you,” he said into Harry’s shoulder.
Draco listed off new facts about himself.
“I missed you…” Harry said after a beat. “When we weren’t talking.”
Anthony repeated in a grizzled shrill.
"What's what?" Michael asked, stopping halfway of grabbing the door.
him. It made him feel sick. Shame from all the immature threats and fights he had made his stomach heave.
"Do you think it had anything to do with the Stone?"
“What did Professor Lupin want?” Anthony asked when Draco rejoined him and the group.
Feeling Harry's hand go around his wrist, Draco pulled both of them, running past small, forest-floor creatures, tripping over tree knots out of fear until they heard someone shout. "Harry! Draco! Are you alright? Neither of you looks well."
There, in a far left of the tree, were two Black brothers named Regulus and Sirius. Cousins to Draco, once removed. Regulus’ photo was decayed the worst on the tree, dried specks falling onto the page to further emphasise that he’s been dead long before Draco could think of meeting him. Sirius’s still held a human-colour, his photo had a smoother shade, his young face far more handsome than the mugshot all over the
"Fine, fine." Harry didn't look at him in the eye.
interest to even be an infatuation for Draco. Relationships weren’t necessarily something he wanted. He saw everyone else get girlfriends and boyfriends, but it wasn’t a novelty that he tried to seek out.
waiting for Professor Binns to become entertaining), traded new interests they picked up over the summers ("
“I’m paying attention! See?” Harry shuffled around blank pages of parchment. “Er…”
Fred and George had their feet on a large table, throwing peppermints at one another's mouth. Hermione and Ginny were lounging on a bottom bunk in the far side of the tent. Ron and Michael were sitting around a coffee table, unsurprisingly talking about the match. Draco and Harry sat on a couch across from the two boys.
"Just..." Draco looked into those eyes, watching them grow older in his head, remembering all the times they were filled with hatred and anger. "Just all over the place." Using his fringe to cover his red face, he slowly leaned back to his stool, ignoring the hands held out to him by the fitter.
he noted idly.
think she was? This was… She knowingly harmed
"Oh, er, right. So, where are you going?"
"I don't know, Ron said that he was a Prefect here at Hogwarts fifty years ago when the supposed Chamber of Secrets was opened."
Draco shrugged helplessly, unable to actually answer. “It’s what I felt was true. I hated myself. I hated… how my life turned out to be. I wasn’t happy with it. Wasn't happy with me. I was frustrated because I felt the need to change something. I felt like,” Draco shrugged again. “I could never go back to the way life was. And it never did. But, I know it’s fine now.”
Draco surged forward to capture Harry’s mouth again. He wrapped his arms around Harry as the kiss grew deeper.
"So, what did he want?" Terry asked.
Terry placed his head in his hand, not paying attention to Dumbledore and Ministry representative for the tournament, Barty Crouch's, explanation. “Well, this is underwhelming considering we already know this. No wonder you’re always grumpy, Draco.”
“It’s a map that my dad made with his friends back in school. It shows secret passages, and shows locations of people around the school.”
Each meeting was somewhat organised with Hermione's planning, but it was really just a bunch of students trying out spells in semi-unity. But it showed Draco how well Harry took to the teaching role... and often he found himself looking at Harry helping others when we was supposed to be spotting Terry's aim as he levitated Michael. Cedric being seen at these meetings were always a shock to Draco as if he was still trying to see a ghost in Cedric's place. But Cedric took to teaching others as well and Draco saw Harry and Cedric become closer friends.
“You didn’t see her right? No one else knew what we were talking about. How on earth could she know?” Anthony asked.
“Why are yeh thanking me? Didn’t drink a thing. Didn’t even touch it.”
at one another. Draco felt strangely breathless. There was the same shift. The shift of something vulnerable and soft in the air, the same way it was during the night in front of the Mirror of Erised. Draco felt the ghost of Harry's fingers brushing hair out of his eyes, of his face hiding in the crook of a thin neck. The air sharpened with
Harry grinned, snuck a glance at Draco before going to open the egg.
“Knowledge is a wonderful thing, Draco, but it’s very dangerous as well. Tell me, how have you been coping with knowing the things you know?” His mind went though all the sleepless nights.
Draco felt the corners of his mouth turn upwards. "Thanks."
“Friends?”
“I’m not—“
Narcissa emerged from the hallway, resting her hands on the bannister. Her eyes were red-lined and puffy, but she was smiling. “I’m going to stay at home. I feel a bit under the weather. Enjoy the match for me.”
“Because if you are then… Then…” Harry paused. “Then will you go with me?”
"Father," Draco said, noticing Harry tensing behind him.
"Of course, Dobby has learnt his lesson. Took a pan to his head for many days, he did. Dobby'll never do it again."

“That miserable half-giant couldn’t keep his monster in check and it landed you in the Hospital Wing! It is a very big deal!” Lucius shouted, bewildered.
what happened in the maze based on what little he knew. It was enough--it has to be enough. Must be.
Snape was in front of a smoky cauldron. He plucked out a vial from the assortments of glasses and bottles beside the concoction. "Yes, Mister Malfoy?" he greeted without looking at the blond.
Michael dropped his head into his silver plate.
Draco drew his legs up and wrapped his arms around them, no longer caring about the stains his hand would most likely leave. He sat there, the faint sound of torch flames flickering made a shiver go down his back. He felt like he was there for hours. Draco tried reasoning with himself.
scare a Malfoy like that." Percy said. "Could you pass me the rolls, Harry?"
“He said he was meaning to say that…”
Draco sniffed wetly as he grabbed the sweet with slow reacting hands. “Thank you, Professor.”
He could barely hear Weasley and Granger’s voices as they came up to the scene. He could barely hear
Draco felt the Dementor before he actually saw it.
"But, what for?"
As they made their way towards the back of the Hogwarts Express, Lucius easily stuck Draco's trunk into the corner of the compartment rack, then was off before Draco was even sitting down. He stopped before he got too far, though, turning to give one final warning.
OF YOU?”
“I… honestly don’t know either.”
“‘When we were first years’?” Terry craned his head up. “Mate, you’re still lost without him.”
“Harry, what’s wrong--”
“No, nothing's wrong. Just… I need to say something. Something that I've been meaning to say.”
Harry shrugged a stiff shoulder. “Kind of.”
“Hello... Mrs. Weasley.” He hasn’t spoken to her since their first meeting at Diagon Alley last summer. He could still feel his waxy smile pinching his cheeks as Mr. Weasley eyed him wearily until a breathless hug from Mrs. Weasley that claimed him to be “a good boy and a best friend of Ronald”.
When Draco replied to her sentence one day in broken fragments, she sat him in a chair and gave what became the bane of Draco’s existence: a French workbook that came with a ceramic songbird that served as his instructor. The bird would come to life and perch on Draco’s shoulder, monitoring his progress. It would chirp a phrase and rewarded Draco with a lovely tune if correct, but if not, it would peck at his ear and he’d have to try again. (The same would happen when writing phrases.)
“Easier said than done. I swear, one of these days, he’ll get what’s coming to him,” Anthony said before noticing someone in a compartment. He pulled open the door. “Terry!”
worried."
“No more escaped convicts right?” Terry piped up, gnawing at a Liercorce Wand. “What about the dress robes on the supply list? Don't tell me we’re going to actually
“But Michael said--”
When he closed his bedroom closed behind him, Draco realised he should’ve eavesdropped on his parents.
"Another year of Hogwarts. Welcome, new students and those returning. Before the banquet starts, I'll like to say a few words for—"
Draco’s heart soothed at the admission… but his head didn’t want to fully understand. “But… they did…”
“No, but—“
Tonks stared at him with large eyes. “So if it’s no longer your parents that have you upset, then what’s making you take all my butterbeer and giving you wrinkles on your brow?”
“Okay… then what is it?”
“Me?” Anthony sighed and turned onto his back. “I’m taking Luna Lovegood.”
“Just say what you want to say, Hermione.”
"That's the thing," Harry moved his schoolbag to the side, the floor streaking with ink as he leant closer to Draco. "It's a feeling I have. Something is important about this diary. I just need to hold onto it."
Draco continues to stare at his tea in silence.
The blond watched his fingers tap on the diary, seeming lost in thought.
There wasn't much time to think about Qudditich matters when the school was hit with an onslaught of homework and the impending notion of exams.
"I haven't been able to talk to Harry since the twins decided to suffocate me."
Draco blinked at the sudden contact.
“It’s… It’s just so stupid. Making a big deal out of nothing.”
“Sirius Black tried to break into the Ravenclaw Tower,” Draco said.
He stood up with a huff. “Got you, you wretched—“
“I’m sure nothing serious is going to happen.” Hermione insisted.
"Mate, talk to us. I thought you said you'd try to be better with talking with us.” Micheal said carelessly.
“He’s told me himself. ‘My reward for my servitude will be that my son will be special to the Dark Lord. My family will be unpunished.’ It was about you.”
The focus of the final task made every wired around him, especially Fleur with their usual walks around the castle filled with concerns about her performance.
Crookshanks started hissing wildly. The Dementor moved its hood as if it was looking out into each compartment. A spindly long-fingered hand emerged from the cloak. The Dementor opened their own compartment door.
“How about—“ Harry interrupted. “I mean, how about we
"Yes, Father? Need something?"
“What about your feelings?”
“Of course, Draco. A person’s dairy is sacred.”
“Moody! He--He
“So… what do you see in your visions, then?” Ron asked.
“Narcissa…”
“Thank you, Professor.” Hesitantly, he sat down as well.
“I’m fine, Hagrid.” Draco rubbed his arms under the guise of warming himself up from the cold outside. “I’ve heard about the news about Buckbeak. My father--I tried to say something but it didn't work… I should’ve stayed away that day.”
"What is that?" The creature huffed and shook its head.
And Harry seemed to agree.
It seemed like a blink of an eye when Draco saw Hogwarts once more dyed in champions’ colours, preparing for the Third Task. The castle buzzed with speculation and anticipation as the champions began to look more nervous as the remaining days dwindled and the task arrived at last.
"It's nice to see you." Draco turned away from the window to go up to a bookshelf, trying to look for the new Potions book. "How was your summer?" he asked, looking at the other boy. Harry was not looking at him but glaring at Ron, waving an arm towards him as if shooing off a stray dog. "Harry?"
“Yes, that competition,” Draco said.
“I don’t.”
He flushed a dark pink.
!” Terry grimaced as a beetle scurried by his shoe and darted unevenly down the stairs and into the shadows of the corridor. “Does Hogwarts got a bug problem now?”
"Yeah, of course. Bye." He heard Potter’s soft 'bye' before he melted into the crowd.
“Expectations, Draco.” He pointed a finger at him with a firm glare. "Do not forget them.”
thing I want to do.” Terry tucked his arms behind his head. “If I think about it, no one at Hogwarts or otherwise has caught my attention.”
“It’s not like I don’t,” Harry said. “But… I have to go.”
"Are you okay?" Someone asked Draco. He turned to see another sorted Ravenclaw watching him.
Anthony blew out a long breath. “I think I’m with Terry on this. Dating is something that I’m not thinking of doing anytime soon.”
And so third year ends and the wonderful fourth year begins!
“Let’s just say for the time being. I’ll bring more of your things later.”
"Thank you." Draco took a sip of his tea immediately to avoid speaking first.
Minister Fudge was there, out of place in the pub with his expensive robes and bowler hat. Hagrid followed after him, looking just as out of place as the other wizard did. Madam Rosmerta walked up to the two and whispered in the minister's ear and waved her arm to have the two men follow her.
"Where are you taking us?" Michael whined as they began to climb a hill. "We've been at this for
The blond's eyes roved over the parchment. “You can see
Sharp thumps battered at Draco’s sides. He gave a startled cry when a foot stomped ontop of him and forced air out of his lungs. He crawled out of the mainstream of people and scrambled to get back on his feet.
Draco was defiantly not looking forward to it.
"Buckbeak? Oh, yes, the hippogriff. Well, I say that this development takes priority over something so trivial as a complaint against a creature that hasn't repeated the offence since... Consider it dropped. I'll deal with the paperwork tomorrow." Fudge turned to the executor that Draco didn't even know was there loitering in the shadows. "Er, sorry, for wasting your time, Walden."
Harry glanced over at Draco and Draco pretended not to see it.
"Good. I need to talk to you.
“You do?” Harry started, glancing at their surroundings. “Right now?”
"Let's hope Madam Pomfrey can heal you quickly," Anthony grumbled.
"What? But you just told me to tell—“
“Are you sure you want me to fix those robes, Ron? They look pretty stunning to me.”
“Draco, look out!” Harry shouted.
“Draco!” Setting the mirror down, Michael rushed towards the blond and marvelled at the sight of him. “Wow! I can’t believe it worked!” He cried out before giving him a hug. “It’s great to see you!”
Narcissa was sticking out a jewelled hand to a surprised Molly Weasley when the platform went out of view. Draco lugged his trunk into the hallway, not ready to start the search for a place to sit.
"Use your strengths, Harry," Draco said, moving past them to start walking back to Ravenclaw Tower.
Harry stopped thinking about Saturday's Quidditch match that was tomorrow and whirled around to face Ron.
“In a Muggle village. Or is it called a suburb? A neighbourhood,” Narcissa said. “Turn in your school trunk so the crest doesn’t show.” She added before taking off down the pavement.
“Well…” Draco didn’t actually know about the mandatory dance partner. “You know now, don’t you?”
“It’s great to see you,” Anthony said after a beat, shaking Draco’s shoulders.
“No! Them muggles are bloody awful, mate. The things they did to him! You won't believe what they did to him last year! They put bars on his windows! Starved him too! Kept him locked up in his room!” Ron cried. “Me and my brothers had to break him out!”
Draco was having a dream that he was ratting out the Gryffindors to McGonagall.
Draco snorted. Harry Potter would never willingly go to the library for
“We can’t be. It's too early to be there yet.” Hermione said seriously. “It seems liken we got stuck. I didn’t even know that the Hogwarts Express could do that.”
She snickered. “It

Yet a rational part of him was wondering
Day one and already everything's already screwed up. He still needed to figure out if the story of Quirrell was true, find a way to avoid Snape (who knows what he'd say about Draco being a Ravenclaw?), ward off Crabbe and Goyle, while finding a way to still interact with the Golden Trio to keep an eye on them. He can't be having flashbacks or letting it slip out that he knows something. Finishing the list, he went over and over it again.
Draco felt him be sent into an emotional riot. Intense surges of shock and confusion—so much
“Alright, you’re healed.” Madam Pomfrey said, pocketing her wand back in her apron.
He couldn't be. It was too easy, way too easy. There had to be a catch.
Before the task began, Hermione squished passed them to take her spot beside Ron, muttering about how Skeeter was probably going to take a hug out of context. When Cedric stepped into the ring to signify the start, Draco stood up straighter.

Ron’s head popped in. “How about we all sit together now?” He asked, already letting himself inside.
When Draco was opening Anthony's gift, a loud crash startled all three of them.
“Terry,” Draco said.
“Right, right. So you mentioned countless times. After all, who can deny thy immense beauty of
"Come down with me then."
“You save me too much.” Draco took the offered hand and let Harry haul him up. “I thought you weren’t allowed to come,” he asked, brushing off the snow.
“Harry,” He said, not really caring if she knew.
“Help you with homework?” Draco asked. Since when did Harry Potter care about schoolwork?
a savage voice hissed inside his head.
“Okay, yeah... I’ll go back... Good night, uh?”
“You’re also a freak, Malfoy. You know that?” Fletcher interrupted, finally turning toward the blond. “I never interacted with you in my life. Ever. I never even heard about you until Hogwarts.” Fletcher gave him a distrustful glare. “Yet why do I feel like you know everything about me? You don’t! You have no idea who I am! You know NOTHING!”
.) He was still confident enough. So he shouldn’t feel his stomach coil with nerves of possible awkwardness.
“Well, it’s when I started to—“ Harry paused. “when you called me a true friend. That never happened to me before.” Draco turned to give Harry a short grin.
EDIT 071520:
“Will do, thank you…"
"Yes..."
"I'm fine, Weasley," he snapped. "Sorry, sorry. I, I just lost myself."
"Mister Potter? Mister Potter!"
Mr. Weasley, who was shooing the twins into their seats, finally turned around and faced Draco's father.
As soon as they were out of ear-shot of any passing students, Draco turned around, having to look up to see the beady eyes of the Slytherins.
"No," Draco's voice wobbled. "No, no, no."
by trash000 (and can i say… your username… same) give it a listen!
“This is getting me nowhere." He needs to stop dwelling on this.
Michael jumped up for his Snitch which flew up higher in response. “Spending time with Potter, of course.”
A bolt of green light exploded in the crystal ball. Draco shot back in his chair, chills running down his back.
Draco squinted and hurried over to her. “Scabbers? You're alive?"
“I can, Professor.” Hermione’s hand shot through her air.
"Harry is still a boy. To
Dumbledore didn't look any different. From the distance, he could still see the same silver beard, the light-coloured robes.
“Yes,” he answered, getting frantic to find his wand, blinking his eyes rapidly.
"Are you... getting books for this year?" Draco asked. The manager seemed to despair at the question.
“Look, I'm not like him, alright?"
Once again, all eyes focused on him.
“He’s exactly right, we have time.” Granger looked impressed then turned to Harry and Weasley.
like girls? Did he like… neither or even… both? What even was it to like someone?
Draco looked around until his eyes noticed a large tapestry taking over the majority of the walls. It reminded him of the family tree in his mother’s family book. Yet there were more faces on the tapestry. Faces that were angrier, more detailed.
“Do you feel disgusted? Is it because Harry’s a boy?”
Draco expanded and collapsed the Marauder’s Map, mystified at the intricacy of the object. “I can’t believe your father made this. And all so they could slip away from professors? Stunning.”
An old memory connected. The secret organization that Umbridge sent around Draco and the rest of that nauseating Inquisitorial Squad to go find. It was this year? He barely remembered it. Draco also didn't know that it was Hermione who thought of it, but he shouldn't be surprised that it was her.
) Potter was looking at.
“Graphology. The interpretation of a person’s handwriting to determine a person’s well-being and personality traits.” She explained before tittering and returning to the front of the classroom.
“Students,” Dumbledore raised his hands up for silence. “Welcome, to a new year at Hogwarts. I hope that you find yourself learning lots in between this year of exciting events.” That made the students whisper amongst themselves. “For this year, we are the humble host for one of the most timely competitions in history. The Triwizard Tournament!”
Draco was in the library, looking up spells to help with oversleeping amongst the many other problems he has been finding about himself. That morning, Michael pointed out that Draco was “looking very pale”, and so he was looking for a spell that would fix that problem.
Over the booing of the cancelled match, Harry went back to the ground and saw it was Draco by the professor's side, looking more sickly than he ever had. Despite Wood's argument, McGonagall focused on Harry and told him to follow her. Ron saw this happen and broke away from the crowd to know what Harry was in trouble for that time.
“Draco, it was your father’s decision. Not yours.”
“Oh, I know. But I worry." She closed up the paper. "Also,
"Can I see it?" Draco asked, his hand stretched out.
"Hagrid, this is Draco. I met him in the robe shop."
"S-sorry, sir." He looked everywhere but the professor.
"‘Warn you?’ It’s a
“It’s just that… besides Slytherin, no one really likes him…” Harry said slowly. Draco shrugged his shoulder in understanding. “Like... your father, Snape… these people aren’t very likeable but you’re nothing like them.”
Draco brought Scabbers up to his eyes. His beady eyes looked lifeless as he squeaked raggedly. Luna must've been a little looney for her to call Scabbers adorable.
"At this point," Hermione said. "I don't think we need to focus on that but more on the fact to prepare Harry for the First Task."
Draco watched the fight in shock. With a painful struggle, Draco pulled his wand out of his pocket. When he looked back up, Harry had his wand and was pointing it at Sirius Black who was wandless with Hermione and Ron watching them in bated breath.
brought a small house-elf with a dish of what was requested. Lucius jaw was tense, but he didn't say anything.
“Your father has been through some changes after last year. Didn’t he tell you that he was going to try to be a better father?” Draco closed his eyes and shook his head.
Draco turned around and was knocked down to the ground once more. He looked found himself being stared down by a Death Eater. Their impassive silver mask glinting in the flames. Before Draco could begin to get up and run away, the Death Eater's wand was in his hand and with one flick of his wrist, Draco was sent into darkness.
"Let's get him out of here," Michael muttered. "Professor Lupin!"
An overwhelming awkward pause.
“I don’t even want to know what happened.” Hermione shook her head. “It was… madness. Terrible, there was so much screaming and…”
“I didn't really know until you just told me. But guess what.” Anthony gave a pause. “We met up with Potter’s friends! They explained his situation and we sorta connected got it from there. We got to know them quite well. We’ve even bonded over being friends with someone like you and Potter.” He pointed an accusing finger at Draco.
Draco spun to keep Michael’s Snitch in his view. The Snitch twitched away and, when it noticed Draco following, continued to lead him.
Fleur pursed her lips, eyeing Harry over Draco’s shoulder. “I find zat very hard to believe.”
“Sorry,” Ron said, pulling back a dripping tea towel. "Did I wake you?"
“Could you even sign it?” Creevey asked.
Draco couldn’t help but be pleased that Lucius actually remembered Michael’s name. He turned towards his father. “Can I not anymore?"
“When?”
Draco was sighing in relief as the songbird was reverting back to its lifeless state when the fireplace erupted in green flames.
Draco glanced over at Harry who was pointedly not looking at him. Irritation burned through him. He pursed his mouth and felt his nose upward as he redirected himself towards Hermione’s table who seemed just as worried as Ron.
For once, Draco held malice feelings for Fletcher, a very pretty Fleur Delacour that was willing to talk to him notwithstanding.
“I saw Cedric dead, Harry,” Draco yelled. “And… it would’ve destroyed you, Harry. You were… screaming and everyone was just—Cedric is a good person that didn’t deserve to die and more than anything I wanted to make sure that you didn’t have to go through that pain because seeing someone die right in front of you… You’re never the same.”
Draco sat on the fallen tree trunk and set down the lantern beside him. “What happened?”
"Why don't you play for Ravenclaw? See if you're good enough to get on the team."
“Now that’s because the actual gift of Sight is not something you can achieve by a book or by a form of academic study…” Trelawney’s huge eyes landed pointedly at Hermione who was visibly startled. “It is a Gift that is so scarcely given to mortal beings as of recent past. It is something that you can’t just be achieved by a sudden anomaly--
“What girl?” Terry asked.
Hermione’s nose scrunched at the mention of the woman’s name.
"Fleur knows," Draco said.
“That one night. The one where we went to the Mirror of Erised. In first year. You said-You said ‘is this my punishment’ and you didn’t want this. I never understood what you were talking about.” Harry turned to him. “What did you mean by that?”
"That--That toad!" Hermione hissed.
I say yes?”
“Still, it made me so angry at the time. I still don't really regret it.” Harry blew out a long breath. “Why did you want to know this?”
"Oh." He didn't know anything about this.
"He's fought over hundreds of Dementors with his Patronus," Ron piped up.
“Then... Why are you freaking out? Isn’t this a good thing? It finally happened! We've been waiting for this day! Shouldn’t we be downing some punch?”
“Sorry,” She shook her head. “It says that you ‘life line’ is connected to your ‘heart line’ and your heart line is mostly straight… You’ve experienced ‘emotional trauma or heartbreak’ thus you will have ‘twists and turns in romantic endeavours... But I find this whole course to be complete rubbish so--”
Tonks smirked. "Yeah, those kiss-puffy lips of yours tell me much."
wake me up?” said Draco, exasperated.
They registered the sound of running footsteps too late.
A lifeless tree trunk that was toppled over and there were hushed sounds of someone trying to keep in their crying quiet. Draco walked slowly to the tree trunk before kneeling in front of the crying sounds.
Tom’s dairy tightened in his arms.
Potter looked as if he was punched. For a brief moment, his face was devastated before it twisted into fury.
Ron groaned over a mouthful of soup. "'Mione don't bring that up!"
Draco tried to keep a frown off his face when Flitwick pulled at Pansy Parkinson’s robes to stand before him to be his next dancer partner. She looked beyond pleased to be standing in front of Draco.
for them like that. If Draco liked boys, he would know… wouldn’t he?
Harry was nowhere to be seen, but Ron and Hermione were there. They were sitting beside one another, deep in conversation. Draco could see their shoulders were pressed together.
“A dare?” Ron suggested.
“Freak,” Fletcher muttered, his brow still furrowed as he walked away.
"Harry, why are going so fast?" Draco huffed.
His fingers stayed in his lap. Harry his shoulders shake as he buried his face into Draco’s sweater.
“I’m not associating myself with any Slytherins since I see it pointless for me to even try. This will be the last time either of us talks to one another. It’s time you find someone new to hold your leashes.” there was a faint tolling of the bell. “I need some air.” Draco quickly left and stared heading towards the courtyard.
“I never really was mad,” Harry said. “Are

Hermione peeked over at the

"Tonks! You've made it!" Harry glanced over to Draco and paused. "Draco..."
so I think I can get a free pass.”
When Draco was out of sight he bypassed the staircase to walk further along the hallway until he reached a set of double doors. He pushed one open, minding the creak, to peek inside. Finding no house-elfs, Draco shuffled inside and closed the door behind him.
"My whole family is. They are one of the few wizarding families who still stick to rules about blood purity and are known to be all Slytherins, myself included."
“Let’s get to the feast before they kill one another.” Anthony grinned.
—a headache started forming on the spot.
"What happened?”
Draco’s eyes widened. Then he grinned that amazing smile that’s captivated Harry since he was eleven and on the cold floor in front of the Mirror of Erised.
“Arthur,” Lucius started then cleared his throat. “Er, Molly decided to stay home, then?”
“He killed them. Sirius Black.” Harry’s voice was shaking. “He killed my parents. He was their friend and he killed them.”
"Well, that's stupid. But if your dad is really the way my dad always goes on about, I'll be wishing you luck." Weasley looked out the window of the moving train.
“She... hasn’t told you anything about me, right?”
“Uh, Draco? Mate,” Ron went over to Draco bypassing Harry for the moment. He wasn’t sure whether or not he could wrap his arms around the shaking boy. “Are you alright? Uhm, take a good breath, right? Do you want me to count or something?”
“Now stir it the other way,” Granger said and Draco almost grabbed the cauldron to throw it across the marble floor.
“No, wait—“ Hagrid’s large hand prevented him from actually escape as he was lead to Anthony’s group of Terry and Michael who parted excitedly. “Hagrid let me go—“ Draco was now standing in front of the creature.
his way out of it,” Ron added sharply.
“Mrs Boot invited us over for a weekend during the holiday," Michael announced.

“You don’t have to say anything, Hermione,” Draco said stiffly. He forgot that Harry was just as bad at holding a grudge and how bad
"The Halloween Feast?” Draco was still a little winded after rushing to change out of his shirt and slip back into bed. “Where is everyone?” He asked, as no one else came in with them.
“And he used his power to help Lupin to get him into the castle!” Hermione jabbed a finger to Black.
Draco blinked nervously.
Michael would be with his father. There was a very little chance that he managed to get gravely injured. He would have to write a letter as soon as possible.
Why hasn't Draco ever heard of her? Draco filed that question in the back of his head to come back to later. He scanned the tree for a particular face.
"Wouldn't hurt for them to at least
Draco thought in a flat tone.
Moody took too long to respond.
“But it’s true!” Michael cried. “I don’t think I’ll ever have something like this without anyone else. You’re all family to me.”
"Well…” Mr. Weasley said.
They idly waited for the match to start. Other important Ministry wizards climbing up and taking their own seats, Lucius dutifully greeted them all. There was a commotion as the Weasleys, Harry, and Hermione shuffled into their seats in the Top Box.
It was claustrophobic under the cloak. They seemed to walk around under it for hours, and the cold night was starting to get to him. "Harry, it's freezing. Can we just forget it?" the blonde asked, his teeth chattering.
"You can tell someone. Tell someone who can help."
How are we supposed to ask one of them?”
The four stepped in Professor McGonagall's office and Harry was hit with a smell of expensive perfume before it brushed past him and Draco was swept up in a hug by a woman. Snape appeared behind her.
to stop the overwhelming sense of hurt.
“Was it a potion? It was, wasn’t it? We’ll pay you for the recipe,” George said.
“Brunch is now ready, Master,” Dobby reported as the Malfoys went into the dining room.
"I won't."
“Professor,” Harry regained composure.
Draco snorted.
"You got quiet."
Yet, can he really say no to a Beauxbatons girl in the first place? And not just any Beauxbatons girl but
"Where are you going now?" Potter asked him, slightly out of breath from chasing after him.
“I could get rid of it for you.”
"Me neither so don't stress yourself out."
“No, wait. You don’t understand—“ Draco tried to push himself up.
“Thank you. Your robes look nice as well. Thank you for taking me to the ball."
“Alright, more time with us then!” Ron gleamed, knocking his elbow into Harry’s arm. “Great, isn’t it?”
” Draco shouted.
Draco gave a brief smile and walked back to his table.
"Yes, Mother, I will be careful. Thank you." he took the permission slip with care, not letting his fingers smudge as he left the room to let his mother and father go back to their not-secret whispers.
“Is… Are we still talking about your father right now?” Narcissa asked.
Draco's jaw locked. “That’s not true.”
"Come on," Sirius let them inside and closed to door behind them. "Harry's still out and about around London."
“Dear child, do you see anything in particular?” Trelawney’s harsh voice came above from the two boys’ heads.
towards him.
”No, no! Merlin, no.” Draco
“Thank you, Professor.”
Ron shoved him past a Beauxbatons boy who turned and reached out his hand towards them. “Ah,
“What?”
“Cedric, come on!” Justin Finch-Fletchley cried out.
“Draco," Anthony rubbed a tired eye. "You said so yourself. Nothing is written in stone. You said you can take the future into your own hands. Nothing is telling you to do exactly what it says. Why are you now so insistent that you have to follow whatever you’ve seen?”
In one of the tall windows, an owl fluttered back into view. Draco was the first to get his bearings and get up onto his feet. He unclasped the hook and pulled at the window pane, letting in the freezing chill along with the postal owl.
Snape slowed to stand in front of them. He eyed the upturned corners of Draco’s mouth, his gaze darted to a silent Harry before looking back at his godson. “Mister Malfoy.” Snape’s dark eyes held some semblance of warmth. “Potter,” he said with less familiarity.
“Her name’s Fleur Delacour. She seems pretty nice."
Narcissa smiled down at her son. “Of course, love.” Draco lifted himself off of her lap and she stood up.
“Are you sure you’re alright?” Draco asked Harry again, unwarranted guilt sparking in his stomach.
Draco didn't know how to reply so he took a long sip of his tea.
Draco knew it was cowardly to run after the Task, considering the
“Oh. That. Right. I’m alright. Nothing’s happened after that day. Over the summer they almost wouldn't let me outside, but I’ve been fine.”
"Oh, well within that viewpoint yeah, but what about Weasley?" Terry questioned.
someone…
The class of Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs found themselves at the pin that held half a dozen hippogriffs. All were various shades, from jet-black to the light grey, speckled hippogriff that Draco moved his gaze from immediately.
"Relax. The attacks are not going to be that common.” That Draco remembers quite well.
indicated that someone was in his room. "Dobby has brought a snack for young master Draco." Dobby showed off a silver platter. Draco found himself staring at the house-elf.
Draco finally pushed his trunk on the rack above him and dropped himself on the seat. He watched as students hurried on the Hogwarts Express, desperately trying to get seats with friends.
"Found it 'n the snow," Hagrid gruffed. "Seemed to be out there fer a while." He looked down at the dead rooster. "Second one I found. It’s either foxes or somethin’. I need to ask if I can charm the coop. Wait a minute!" Hagrid suddenly said. "Why aren't ye in class?"
"You, you can't be serious?" the professor gawped.
Draco took a deep breath and the tension seeped slowly out of him. He absentmindedly wiped under his eyes.
Cedric’s face instantly scrunched and he groaned as he opened his eyes. He raised to his elbows, eyeing the many faces staring at him.
“I didn’t know any of that…” Draco said to himself.
"For what?"
“Harry, I like you,” Draco said. “I really, really,
“What about Michael? Where is he going?"
Draco opened his mouth to protest his father’s treatment of Dobby but thought better of it. He quietly deposited himself on a couch.

“Well, I don’t feel ridiculous at all.” Draco droned, wrinkling his nose as he took Harry’s drained cup, their fingers meeting briefly. His heart was finally slowing down.
Fleur squealed and gave him a side hug. “Ah, good! Meet me at ze bottom of your Ravenclaw Tower on zat night.” She kissed his cheek and bid him goodbye.
He felt like an intruder. When they invited him to have breakfast, he barely ate anything, feeling like the wasn't enough circumstances that allowed him to be at the kitchen table. He kept to the bedroom, hesitantly pulling out an innocent book and skimming through it. Draco messed around with the 'light switch' that he had a distant understanding of. He flicked it on and off with mild amusement for a few hours.
"Professor—It's—It's—"
I’m so sorry! I planned to have multiple updates last time and totally dropped the ball! Things in my life just got way too hectic and I’m so very sorry! I have something that can be somewhat of an apology… make sure to read the endnotes if it sounds appealing! I'm also making some slight edits in the previous chapter to answer the questions about the status of Buckbeak and having a cleaner movement to fourth year so look out for that as well.
"Do--Do you even know
Her hair was still falling to her shoulders, a tiny bow awkwardly clipped at her temple. It was this year that Draco mentioned she would look better with shorter hair and if she lost the bow. The next time he saw her, her hair was trimmed with the bow exchanged for a headband. He complimented her on it and she didn’t change it ever again. Why would she listen to him that easily? Because she liked him? Would she really change her hair just for him? He didn't warrant such a thing. It felt strange interacting with someone he knew had feelings for him... Was
Draco switched his gaze to Anthony's arms and to his concerned face. Draco sniffed and swallowed the lump in his throat. He didn’t have to think too long; he nodded.
“That’s so lovely to hear! Let us have the great Pythia continue our journey to clarity. There’s also a side lesson which I like to teach fourth year students,” she whispered excitedly.
Draco cleared his throat (and refrained from clearing it again). “Hi.” He already hated this conversation.
Either way,
He saw Harry looking sad throughout the weeks and that made him want to just forget about things and help him out. He was close one time, but Anthony hauled him away.
"Yes, Father. Of course." Draco turned to Harry who was still staring at Lucius. "Harry, my books."
Draco took a frightened step back. Then, Draco started running. Terry pressed into the alcove as Draco ran past him, fleeing to the bright Great Hall. He turned back to see Potter’s reaction.
"Don’t think too hard about being on time. You're becoming stiff. Just relax.”
Draco scoffed and slammed his book shut. He tossed the book onto the living room’s coffee table. He still hasn't figured out what to do with the Harry situation.
“Oh…” Harry thinned his mouth to a line as if to keep his face from taking on an emotion. “Okay…”
“You’re…” Draco felt himself shrink away. Why did he have to draw attention to himself? “You’re in the Black family book.”
“I’m—fine.” he felt something cold roll down his cheek. Dammit, he’s crying. In front of other people. He was supposed to be
"You’re not going to do it?” Weasley said as he and Harry returned from plucking Crabbe and Goyle’s hair for the Polyjuice Potion. It was Christmas night, and everyone has finished going to the feast and now were at their dormitories, stomachs full.
"I need to..." Draco mumbled. He shook his head as if he lost the words he was going to say. "I need to tell you something," he finally got out. His hands were running over one another. That wasn't like him.
“I know I am. Is that all? You’ve learnt to dance, right?”
Sirius gave a grimy grin when Lupin helped him up to his feet before hugging him tightly.
that’s what happened. Draco actually said no?”
“So glad that you’ve been blessed by titan goddess Phoebe to be here with me.” A misty voice called out through the opaque air.
“I think you were suddenly alarmed if anything,” Harry said matter-of-factly.
“You’re what?” Terry asked. “What’re you going on about?”
“I myself would’ve broken down from all the stress if it wasn’t for Ted..."
“I don’t want you to do anything so serious as going to the Ministry. I don't want complaints to the Ministry, no more… using status. I just want…" Draco's eyes stung and his throat felt thick. "I just want you to try to keep your promise that you’ll try to change. To
"Don't worry, mate." Ron suddenly punched Draco's arm. "Me and Hermione are here to balance it out." Ever since Anthony, Terry, and Michael discovered a friendship with Ron and Hermione, they had no problems hanging together in a big group. (Whether it was a good or bad thing was still up for debate.)
"Okay?”
Draco thinned his mouth, a chill swept down his back as his spine. He thought of how his mother's maiden name was Black, and that would technically make Sirius Black and him related in some way. Draco thinks they might be cousins, second cousins at least.
fine.” Draco moved towards the Hogwarts Express and stepped on. “How have you been?” He asked over his shoulder as they walked down the aisle.
” He shoved past the blond.
“If you ever send Michael to get me I’ll be after all of you,” Draco grumbled, sliding into a chair next to an eating Anthony.
The three Gryffindors pulled seats to their tables (drawing more annoyed looks with the bustle of noise).
“He didn’t?” Does Draco remember that from the time before?
and that
The clattering sound of wood echoed in the room.
“I’m fine, Hagrid. You didn’t think about it. It's okay. I'm already fine."
There are many strange things at Hogwarts, but there’s probably nothing more jarring than Snape trying to lead a Yule Ball dance practice of a combined class block of Ravenclaws and Slytherins (much to the displeasure of both houses).
“‘I will be burned'," Penelope stated, making everyone look up. “He said ‘I will be burned’ and the king was so confused he had no choice but to let the man go."
With one last look at Potter moving with the Gryffindors, Draco got up to follow his fellow Ravenclaws.
Draco bit at his lip. “Harry, I need to tell you something. There’s going to be a professor this year sent from the Ministry. She’s going to be more vicious than she looks."
Draco locked his jaw. “How long will I stay here?”
“You also didn’t mention that the champions are supposed to have the first dance and
Draco took it up without a response and took a longer swig than necessary.
Hogsmeade day with Potter?” Michael brought the topic back up he piled another pumpkin pie slice onto his plate. (His Snitch was safely in his own robe pocket.)
A throat cleared at the doorway. Harry was standing there, patting at his messy hair. (Draco always wondered why Harry did that, he meant it when he said his hair was fine.)
The three were silent, seemingly taken aback.
Draco's chest was overwhelmed with warmth. His fingers tingled, his smile grew wider. One of his hands tried to cover up his
“I don’t have proof,” Harry said.
There was another commotion as Hermione clambered out the portrait hole.
“Don’t have such a smug face,” Anthony said as they watched Harry held up the golden egg to the crowd of Gryffindors. They were hanging off to the sides to not show that Ravenclaws were in their midst. “You’re insufferable when you get that face.”
"Okay, it's a promise." He held out his hand. Harry quirked up his mouth, lifting his hand to place it in the other boy's. They did an exaggerated shake, sealing the agreement, both breaking into laughs and wide grins. Their movements slowed until it was only them, holding on to each other's hands, their smiles falling off as they both just
“You bet I did.” Terry closed an eye and pointed across the dance floor. “Right there.”
Draco desperately clung to her. “I’m so sorry, Tonks. I’m so sorry…”
“Ah, it’s quite alright,” Tonks said. “Kids can be a handful. I sure was one. Of course,
“Aren't they--Isn’t there going to be someone to see if he’s okay?!” Hermione asked no one.
“Whoa, Harry Potter was dumped?!”
“I can get rid of stuff very easily.” She tucked it between her chest and arms.
“What do you have against Scabbers?" Draco asked, exasperated. "He’s nothing but a—“ A sharp bite stung of his finger. “
." His wand lit up with a bright light. “
“Of course I remember; it’s important to me,” Harry insisted.
“Hold on,” Harry interrupted. “I don’t want to be a part of this tournament if it’s going to be dangerous!”
“He’s been Stunned,” Tonks said. “This part’s easy.” She pulled out her wand and pointed it at Cedric’s chest. “
The three Ravenclaws looked at him. Their faces turned weary at Draco showing an emotion more than unusual for the blond.
As if it was in slow-motion, Draco saw Lucius surround him in a hug. It was stiff, alien to both people. Draco never remembered his father hugging him.
A muffled thump and the splintering of firewood made Draco open his eyes.
Fletcher frowned, his gaze darting back and forth between Malfoy’s eyes, scrutinizing. “What’s wrong with you?”
He curled himself in the nook, peering up to the sky to see if he could catch stars alongside the moon.
“Bloody hell,” Ron muttered when they were close enough. “What’s going on here?”
One week past before was shoved against the wall at wandpoint. “Granger, move your wand."
pass him up?
It’s just… I know that he's out there and being…”
He stared at the telly… watching the people talk. Or were they arguing? They were arguing weird. Were they stuck in the box? The man said something and he could hear disembodied laughter. Where did that laughter come from? Why weren’t they reacting to it? Was Draco supposed to laugh too? He felt himself get lulled into a telly-induced trance.
“What, like who else does Black want to murder?” Ron raised an eyebrow.
“What is this again?” Terry asked, fighting with his own scarf.
doing? Draco, we’re just wondering what happened last year. You were acting…” Crabbe stopped as if he forgot what word he was going to use.
"He's not a child. If he managed to hold on to his own against Voldemort, then he can handle a few muggles."
Checking the time, he left his room to meet his father at the bottom of the staircase for the portkey’s activation to take them to the venue. He topped off the last step and noticed that Lucius wasn’t there.
"You're in luck, we know where the Chamber is and what's inside. Let's go." Harry also pointed his wand at Lockhart.
In the early morning, Draco wrapped himself in a coat and made his way to the owlery.
(See the end of the chapter for
“This
"There's nothing that I can do considering that Nymphadora already told Draco," Snape said but also looked slightly crossed.
Harry also flew down to the ground and tried to head towards Draco’s direction, but intercepted by a mass of Gryffindors. They swarmed the pitch and gathered him up, bouncing him on top of the crowd. Harry only stared at the back of Draco’s head as the boy walked to the changing room with the other Ravenclaws.
"No. No, I just needed--wanted to say goodbye and, and nothing," Draco forced a smile. "I don't know what I'm thinking."
Truly?”
"Shouldn't you do that? He'd listen to the smartest person he knows."
A bird chirped overhead.
"No, really, what were you two talking—“ He couldn’t be heard anymore when the teams stepped out onto the field.
“Draco, why are you defending him? I know he’s your godfather, but please—“ Weasley and Granger came out, saving Draco from speaking.
Lucius pushed up his sleeve to reveal his forearm. The Dark Mark was a stark contrast against his pale skin.
He dropped down at the–-
"Follow your mother," Lucius said and turned away to the brick wall. Draco's mother went next to him and put her hands on his arms, rubbing his left arm as they walked.
“The original price for it!”
"Can I have it back?" Harry held out his hand, but the diary did not move. "Draco, are you okay?"
“Oh, no, I’m sneaking out."
“You two just--Leave me alone!” Draco shouted. It came out more sharply than intended but it let him continue down the corridor without their questioning.
"I will never be over you getting Ravenclaw."
Draco took Lupin’s advice and decided to blow off classes for the day. The blond climbed up the stairs to the bronze eagled door. A red puff of fur was sitting outside.
Tonks' brow furrowed and she rushed to kneel at the boy's side. She gave him a once-over and sighed.
“Harry, what did I say?” Draco hissed.
He shook his head. “It’s alright, professor. I’m just really glad to be back here for another year. “
Draco squished the dangerous developing thought and stood up. He felt lightheaded and emptied of tears. Leaning his shoulder against the wall, he dragged himself towards Ravenclaw Tower. When he reached the corridor he stopped.
“Didn’t feel like going to Hogsmeade. There’s nothing stopping me from staying here.”
But Draco knew he shouldn’t be that surprised that the three were snooping around, but they were talking about sneaking into the
Harry shook his head. “He never left anyway. He was always out there, waiting. There’s nothing that could change that. Draco, you never sought out to make my life terrible.”
Distracted, he bumped into someone. “Sorry, Draco!” Hermione called out, still walking hurriedly in the opposite direction. Draco shrugged it off until someone shoved him to the side, this time flying past him. “Sorry, Draco!” Hermione called out again.
The world around him got enveloped with dark, his hearing got plugged, his blood felt like ice. His father helped Voldemort come back.
“Thanks. Yeah, Sirius is amazing. I can do homework at the kitchen table, don’t have to serve breakfast anymore, I have clothes that fit me!” Harry pulled at his (damp) shirt in emphasis. He quieted. “I’ve also learned a lot about my parents. What they were like. Especially my dad. It finally feels like I’m normal…”
Michael snickered he caught up with the group. “That was
“Nil wasn’t even phased when you fell off, he went and won for Slytherin,” Ron explained as Draco walked closer. Harry made an abortive movement to sit up when he saw the blond.
"Harry Potter is at the door asking for you," Cho said, her voice held envy and other people who were studying turned to them. Draco decided to wait till the time comes to worry about Chang.
Tonks shrugged. “It’s something impulsive and provides stress relief. Plus,” she wiggled her earlobe with a finger, “it looks pretty sick.”
and Draco had to see Harry’s saddened face everywhere.
"Yes, that would be my first intention, but—"
Draco’s body felt like lead. It was so ridiculous. He was Harry’s... He shouldn’t be. Why was he? Why couldn’t he wrap his head around anything?
“Hermione! Please," he begged. "Don’t do this. I'm sorry, but not now. I’ll explain it later, I promise.”
"Sir, you wouldn't want Harry to be in the Triwizard Tournament, right? You like him now, don't you?"
? That’s the
“...And then Hagrid came and told me that I was a wizard on my eleventh birthday. After he gave Dudley a pig’s tail, I was then taken away and went to Diagon Alley to get school supplies. And I met… you. That’s as much as you missed.”
"Professor, I didn’t—“
Draco eventually found the staircase and, after arguing with the eagle knocker, he climbed up to the empty dormitory. He cleaned his hand to the best of his ability in his confused state and crumpled his ruined robes in a bunch on the floor next to his trunk as pulled out a new shirt for himself.
"Alright, I can't find it," Anthony said, brushing down his robes. "Let's get out of here."
Snape frowned but didn’t reply.
Hermione studied his face. “You’re lying. You knew before that didn’t you?”
Hagrid talked through the basic introduction of hippogriffs. He carefully repeated all necessary precautions and how they
They sat down on a fallen tree beside the Great Lake. Neither Harry nor Draco said anything for awhile.
"Wait, did he say 'Harry'?" One of the twins asked.
"Y-yes?” Harry stuttered.
“So... the Second Task!" Harry cheered. "Do you know what it is?”
"Yes, Mother." He quickly ran off to Madam Malkin's.
“Now!” Professor Vector’s sudden clap shocked Draco out of reading more. “We will now start with the simple exercise of filling in your name and see its numerical value on your character, heart, and social numbers with the Chart of Meaning. Can anyone tell me who first proposed the method of the Chart of Meaning?”
Hermione's brow creased. "He didn't tell you? Harry had a nightmare that Mr Weasley was attacked. Everyone's gone to Grimmauld Place already."
“That’s such a sudden intrusion. I couldn’t.”
Terry gasped. “No, I don’t!”
"Dobby... Dobby... Dobby would be lying if he said young master Draco was kind to Dobby before he started Hogwarts." the platter rattled heavily at his words. "But something happened to young master. Young master is no longer rude to Dobby. Dobby feels grateful for young master Draco. Swore to protect young master Draco, he has." Dobby shuffled foreword, pushed the platter on a table, bowed until his nose brushed the floor and vanished.
“Why?” Draco asked.
“Oh. No.” Harry smiled too widely. “No, no way. I’m not jealous of you.” Despite saying this, Draco noticed that Harry’s eye twitched. “Just curious.
“Sir?”
"Why? Voldemort was after your time."
“All the more reason to go with her. I’d like to go with a friend.”
He swore that he finally knew what this year had in store and he was going to put that knowledge to good use. To finally put forward change that would benefit others. But his mind felt like it was on fire, constantly combusting and reassembling hastily and made his thoughts scatter and make them ten times more intense. Suddenly, Draco felt impending doom constantly, obstacles and blanks of knowledge were now
Harry himself felt his entire weight sink as he slid down to the wardrobe floor. Everything seemed muted. Everything felt...
"'S probably nothin'. Come on, we'll switch groups so Neville will be with me." Glaring at the back of Longbottom's head, he followed until he met Harry and Granger were standing in the clearing. "Neville just got a bit scared. How's about we switch up the groups? Hermione, with me 'n Neville. Draco, you can go with Harry."
impossible
“As if I'd actually be scared by you,” Harry said, still plucking at his drenched shirt. “I was suddenly alarmed if anything.”
“It was nice to see you, too,” Hermione said. “I guess we’ll see you at the start of term?”
"Professor, please. I need to tell you this a soon as possible—"
“Trying too hard to look cool?” Anthony finished.
“Aha, here we are!”
"Draco." A voice at his door made him stop unpacking his trunk.
“I have to go," Draco said, turning away from the paper and standing. He didn’t need to think about this today.
“You’ve ever thought to take Muggle Studies, darling?”)
“Seriously, why sliding doors?”
"You're coming with us, but do you know what's Hagrid up to?" Granger asked again.
“How did you figure that out?”
“What are you bringing the rat for?” Terry asked, breaking the accepted silence.
“Honest?” Anthony chuckled in disbelief. “Alright, I won’t question it. It’s great to see you, too. But you’re really okay, right? I saw the papers about the World Cup. You’ve heard from Michael, haven't you?”
"You're probably right." Draco wanted to ask what's wrong, but it was late already.
Draco woke up with a startled shout.
"And it turns out it was him that made me miss the train and enchanted that Bludger.”
“To the point of unnerving.”
“I’m going to search for my friend, Michael. The one who wrote to me this summer. I told you about it,” Draco said.
“But I really don’t know how I—" It was stupid to keep fighting. "Of course, professor."
"You sure about that?" The Weasley twins were behind Potter, giving him curious looks. Draco found that he wasn’t as completely over time travelling as he had thought, knowing what the fate for one of them would be. He closed his mouth and stared at them, not even saying anything as they stuck Potter’s trunk in the compartment.
“Hermione?” Ron echoed as she reached the bottom step. “Is that really you?”
visit Harry
Draco watched as a group of Ravenclaws crowded against one with a light golden coat, himself still firmly behind the fence. Hagrid noticed and shuffled over towards him. “Oi, Dra—I mean, Mr. Malfoy. Why’re still standin’ ‘ere? Yer group is out there." he gestured to Anthony rubbing
He just felt a kind of resistance since he was going to be rid of Tom.
to know.” Michael simpered after Draco dropped into his seat.
Madam Malkin's should be boarded up, not fitting him for robes. He should be seventeen, not eleven. He should be a worthless Death Eater, not a firstie preparing for Hogwarts. He should be living in fear in his own home, not waking up to— he needed to get out of here.
Dinner ceased and Dumbledore stated the rules, his twinkling eyes sweeping all over the room before pausing briefly at Draco. He called the night over and students rose from their seats.
There was a tap on his shoulder. Draco turned back to find Hermione, her arms ladened with library books.
"For Hogsmeade. The small wizard village. Third years are allowed to travel there now. I'd love to go." Draco faked a smile. Both his mother and father looked at one another, locked in a silent conversation. His eye twitched at that. "You
Draco was suddenly overwhelmed with bone-chilling cold. A fleeting thought was that he’d never be warm again. His chest suddenly felt as if someone was pressing against it, making it difficult to breathe. His increasing heartbeat thudded awfully against his compressed rib cage. Screams pelted at his ears: the Dark Lord’s anguished prisoners, Aunt Bellatrix’s shrill laughter she did when he was tormenting, the Dark Lord when Harry Potter was getting in the way of his plans. He felt himself shaking. His heartbeat felt like it was exploding. Uneven shapes blurred his vision until Tom Riddle whispered closely in his ear. Memories of pale, icy hands grabbing at his shoulders and holding his wrist in place made Draco flinch horribly.
"I'll leave it to you to tell the story." Dumbledore turned to leave. "Draco, when you and Harry are done could you please tell Mr. Weasley and Ms. Granger that he's awake?"
"It's this mirror I found. I can see my mum and dad in it." Draco wracked his brain, finding nothing in his memory that served as a magic mirror to see dead people.
“I do not believe that you attacked those people.”
Moody?
"I think he's... fine. Why?”
Narcissa grabbed Draco’s shoulders to guide him inside first.
and went into a trapdoor that held the
Sirius Black was an... animagus?
"Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want to tell us, but you do know, you know everything. Otherwise, Dumbledore wouldn't trust you to help with the Stone." she used a sweet voice. Draco tried to push Harry's hand away, but it clamped tighter on his mouth. He shot him a glare; in return, got a red-faced Harry with an apologetic face.
“We’re both fine!” Harry said a little too loudly. “I mean—we weren’t hurt,” he said in a lower voice, looking from side to side.
“Because--” Ron spluttered, looking imploringly at immobilized Harry. “Because it’s
"Yeah and I wish we didn't," Ron answered. "I see what you mean, Draco, Umbridge is way out of line. She's worse than I thought."
doesn’t need to know what we do. Go in your corner and read your stupid books like a good Ravenclaw.”
He opened his mouth to defend himself but Ron had a point. He
“You’re… Malfoy, right?”
“Now, join me in welcoming the students of the Beauxbatons Academy!”
Harry and Draco's footsteps slowed when they noticed the compartment door was cracked open and Ron and Hermione we’re caught in a conversation.
“Dobby needs to ask a question. Would you say that Master Draco is friends with Harry Potter?”
Although, no one ever caught
"Gilderoy, you were quite during this entire exchange. Are you alright?" McGonagall questioned.
” Terry aimed to pinch Draco’s cheek.
Draco learnt that the surge of noise in the Great Hall never meant anything good. As he neared the Ravenclaw table and noticed that students were pouring over newspapers, his head filled with possibilities. He only hoped that it wasn’t another special edition of
"Goldstein, you're not even going to
“Well…” Lucius repeated.
“Professor Lockhart asked for you particularly. Eight o’clock. Don’t forget to send Weasley to me.”
“And how doing what you think you’re planning on doing is going to help with that?”
Draco held open the tent’s flap for Harry and followed him inside to see people scattered across the expanded space.
Draco felt him blush at the newfound nickname Tom created (and seem to take a liking to). “
“If that’s true then
"If I knew, my emotions would tamper with the plans. I would want my student to be free from harm, but that could make others suffer at my selfishness.”
Draco’s mind was working at half-capacity. He fumbled in his movements as if he completely forgot how to play Quidditch. Thinking of nothing else to do, he circled the pitch, waiting for a sighting of a speck of gold.
Draco was dancing at the Yule Ball. He was dancing with a blurred figure. The figure held their hands high and their other hand settled on Draco's shoulder.
“Creevey,” Draco called out.
haven't yet. Yes, you're right, you cannot change the past, but Draco," Narcissa looked down at her lap. "the future is still untold."
“Of course.” Draco straightened in his seat, rubbing a tired eye. “You don’t have to ask.” Harry let himself sit on the remaining chair.
"That's fine. I needed time to adjust to the school," her whisper-like voice said. "I also noticed that you're pretty busy yourself."
"Mum, who's Sirius Black?" They could here the girl ask.
“It’s none of your business.” Draco’s voice was muffled under the blanket.
"How did you know about the dragon?"
Draco actually
He didn't know if Hogwarts even had chickens! And he was missing class.
“You need to forgive him.” Michael declared.
“Following us?”
Bidding her a quick goodbye, Draco shoved his way through tall shoulders to reach the train. "Can--Could you keep an eye on Ronald, please? And Harry too?" Mrs. Weasley called after him, wagging a finger. "They don’t need to draw any more attention to themselves this year!”
Snape pulled out his wand and levitated Pettigrew up. In a line, they walked back up towards the base of the Whomping Willow, Crookshanks leading the way.
“Come on then, Harry!” Sirius called out again. “One can’t waste any time on a day like this!”
Brilliant.
After a long lapse of quiet, Draco asked, “Mother?”
“There you are!” the other blond appeared, leading both Draco and Harry’s friends. Anthony’s smile wanded with he saw Draco’s fast pace was not letting up. “Draco, what happened—“ Anthony started before Draco breezed past. The blond would’ve knocked into Terry if he didn’t move last minute.
“How come you’re not running away from me like everyone else?”
Anthony groaned tiredly. "I have no energy to lecture you. At least you're okay. They announced a feast before we came down here. Come on, I bet there'll be sweets. Better than chocolate." There was a glance at the crushed wrapper that fell to the floor.
“She is... She also says--"
"Harry does like to undermine his achievements. Which is him being ridiculous because how can you undermine the incredible things that he's done? Why doesn't he consider that they're rightly impressive and he's done things that full-fledged wizards can only--" Draco cut himself off. How did that come out of his mouth? "Why are you coming with me with this again?"
"It's fine." A moment of silence went between them. "I'm Harry, by the way."
He pushed down the urge to cry. He couldn't do that. Not now.
"Why—why would you think that, professor?"
"Yes. I am."
They went through the entire extended song and one restart before Draco was beginning to get satisfied.
"We don't have time for this. We're in the

“Someone get that owl off of the rug,” Lucius ordered and a house-elf appeared and helped the owl onto their arm before exiting the room.
Madam Pomfrey poked her head out and her eyes bugged out. She did a once over Draco and Ron's filthy faces and dirty clothes. “What in Merlin’s name happened?!” She flapped her hands to get Draco onto a bed.
Nil shoved Draco away. He heaved a frustrated breath and turned away to stalk out of the classroom without sparing Draco another glance.
the sliding doors you want!”
Hermione scooted closer to take Ron's spot. She pulled a blanket up to Draco's chest.
The dark-haired boy ran a hand through his damp hair. "I know that we really can't trust Trelawney, but she seems to know something about you. I can't help but think I might..."
“Welcome to Divination.” Trelawney spread her hands out to the smoky room, sunlight peeking through the thick curtains. “Now, Divination is one of the hardest subjects taught here at Hogwarts.” Draco’s eyebrow twitched at that. He’s never taken this subject before but it couldn’t be
“Can I… Can I get a hug from one of you?”
“Alright, I already hate the new Defense Against the Dark Arts professor,” Terry proclaimed, jumping into his four-poster bed later that night. “I mean, can you actually believe she interrupted Dumbledore? I don’t know if she’s bold or plain stupid.”
Draco pointed behind him to the direction Fleur headed. "She asked me to double-check if she was choosing the right books from the library. They were from the magical creature section."
"Dobby, stop! Enough. Do that somewhere else and leave me to sleep." It was getting harder and harder to keep talking. He wanted to go back to the nameless warm body he was dreaming about.
“Harry! What was that all about? What’s going on?”
“I think it doesn’t change that you’re family and that I’d do whatever I can for you.”
outside.
Divination was already tense when Draco found Ron was sitting with Harry. Ron seemed uncomfortable, his eyes wide and apologetic.
"Do you see?" he whispered. Draco walked closer and saw a blank mirror, their own reflections in pajamas staring right back at them.
happens.”
(See the end of the chapter for
Draco wasn’t stupid, the evidence was there. Tonks' letters said that Moody’s behaviour wasn’t typical, his hyper-awareness of Harry, and his insistence that Draco made sure that Harry won first place. Barty Crouch was there that night and he was found by Moody before the Triwizard champions were announced. The overall feeling of
“Come on, pick something, we all know you love your sweets.” Ron picked up a jar.
that he was being seen like this.
"You'd look... different," Draco answered, his brain trying to imagine Micheal with long hair.

Draco tensed but nodded. “We probably should.”
there you are." He opened the door further and showed Anthony and Michael behind him. "Where’d you go? The Yule Ball’s still going on. I hear the Weird Sisters are about to do their last set.”
"I don't see anything."
“Harry, hate me all you want after this but you have to listen to me now.”
“And what’s being friends with us like?” Draco shot back, shrugging his now stuffed book bag onto his shoulder and lead the way to the dormitory.
Snape's eye twitched at that.
The group pulled Draco into Honeydukes. Students seemed to almost crawl over one another at its fullness, but Ron elbowed his way to the shelves, hauling Draco with him.
Draco explained Harry’s misplaced feelings for him, how he knows that he’s hurt Harry in the process, how he wondered how this would affect Harry’s feelings if he doesn’t get his act together.
you, Malfoy."
During palm reading, in the corner of his eye, he could see Harry staring at Hermione and Draco’s hands cradling one another.
Ron kneeled down in front of Draco. “Well, my mum won’t be friends with your mum if she didn’t think she was an alright person. And Dad says that your dad keeps to himself now and lets the actual department heads do their jobs. They seem less…. insufferable.”
“Er, I’m sorry for not talking to you…” Stop right now, Malfoy.
Errol looked better, spreading his thawed wings towards the furnace in the middle of the room. Draco’s own owl seemed to stare hard at the other bird, unimpressed with the demonstration. When the blond walked over to pet at his feathers, the bird affectionately nipped at his finger. Draco moved around to watch Errol stretch out a leg.
“What?” Prophecy? Oh, yeah, he says he’s a Seer. Draco should really stop forgetting that’s what his cover story is now. “No, nothing like that. Just…” He shrugged. “Cedric Diggory.”
Draco.
Ron promised that he'll go easy on his girlfriend for Hermione to shoot him across the room and Cedric was pleasantly surprised that Cho didn't hesitate to disarm him, and, after much pestering, when Harry called Draco to duel he looked wildly at the blond when he silently blocked his spell and made him stumble and fall with a spell they weren't taught.
“Mister Potter.” Professor McGonagall seemed to appear from thin air. Harry jumped and almost tripped down the steps.
Ron was still trying to close his mouth when the door opened again, and Lucius was standing there, his hand still on the doorknob and his breathing laboured. His eyes darted to everyone in the room before they landed on Draco.
“Bloody hell, he’s back on it again.” Ron groaned behind them.
Draco has the perfect view of Fletcher Nil. The boy was in near the entrance, far from Draco, slipping in a handful of unpaid candy into his pocket.
Odd.”
, head bowed. “Take my son’s suitcase to his room.” He didn’t wait for Dobby to straighten and dropped the heavy trunk in Dobby’s arms. The house-elf swayed back and forth, trying to find balance with the new weight before cracking out of existence.
“Are you alright?” Anthony slurred.
“Are you still thinking about trying to get prefect next year?” Draco asked, thinking back to their recent conversation in their letters.
, you didn't seem to want to stop being friends even if I seemed... weird at times." He smiled. "I know I have an awful way of showing it, don't I? But, this year made me begin to understand. I'm still trying to get the whole... friend thing in order. But, Harry, just know that I... really do care about you. And I'll never forget what you did for me. Is there any way I can thank you? For saving my life?"
