“Mrs. Anderson, may I offer some assistance?” The smaller woman looked at him near desperately, looking at her kids with the most heartbroken eyes. She moved closer to kneel in front of the children cautiously.
He didn’t know what the Carotid Artery was, but it seemed important and a turning point as belt lashings and iron burns turned into minor burns and ice skating accidents. Tom briefly remembered Draco mentioning that he’d met Hadrian rollerblading (he spoke as if it were an insult that Hadrian had crashed into him, but he always recounted the tale with the smallest of smiles) and saying he missed the ice. Severus himself mentioned ice skating when he’d peeked into the boy’s mind and saw the snowy forest ice rink in the boy’s mind. Odd for someone of a desert culture, but nothing about Hadrian was completely normal, was it?
Potter’s expression was openly brash and loud, large grin as he talked with a ginger beside him, Ronald Weasley if Draco remembered correctly. People were watching and whispering along the sides of the two and Potter seemed unbothered by the attention. Even flourishing under it. He looked slightly shorter than Harry, more stout with his chest puffed out. His hair was a shaggy and wild mess on his head with dark brown eyes that looked shone a slight gold in the torchlight. He was so Gryffindor Draco could feel a head ache forming from here.
Hadrian blinked with mild surprise as the adults were already seated at the table, looking a little worse for wear. Tired and worn down. The man smiled at them gently and ducked past Tom, his father, to get into the kitchen. Pulling a box of pastries out of the fridge and tossing them on the counter for everyone to pick at. The pot of coffee was already brewed to Hadrian’s delight. Tom or Severus must have made coffee for them.
“We’ll take care of it. It’s all a misunderstanding that can be cleared up nice and quick.” Sirius felt ill listening to them plot and plan against his innocent godson. The child who did nothing wrong, at least, nothing bad enough to warrant the abuse and the
Cons- Underage Magic (might get the Ministry here quicker if they have to arrest me and everyone here. Not a bad idea).
With that, Severus drew his wand and felt the familiar tug of being pulled into someone else’s mind. A blink later and Severus was in a snowy forest, it wasn’t warm, but the cold was comforting. The dark-haired man looked through the trees and saw a large ice rink, a figure was gliding easily on the ice as he approached. He could feel content, calmness, level-headedness. Severus waited along the edge as the boy skidded to a stop in front of him, a wide grin on his lips.
“Immediate dismissal! Custody stays with Hadrian Potter-Dragma’s mothers! Potter I want to see you up front
Severus, Sirius, and a man named Remus were also here, arguing at the grill and taking turns working on dinner. Tippy popping in and out to assist them and sending him glances as if to make certain he were still there. Tippy was familiar and deeply loved by him. Remus and Sirius were too, though he’d only met the last two recently. Sirius it turned out was his godfather from the Potters, and when they abandoned him; he rejected the Potters and disappeared with his husband Remus to France. He was also the man that arrested Albus and killed James to protect his honor and his life in a duel supposedly. Though, Sirius refused to say what it was that had set him off so badly and never told him anything about it. Never said anything about why Sirius had seen fit to kill James rather than let him live. Only that it was in Hadrian’s best interest.
Dumbledore couldn’t participate in the proceedings in as a judge. It seemed he was working to be the Potter’s legal counsel, irregardless he still held a lot of personal and political sway as a witness. Hadrian’s skin crawled as he felt those blue eyes fixate on the side of his face. Alex’s gaze had less power than this one. Every time Alex’s eyes threatened to have him get a flashback to James, the memory of Snape dragging his ass like a misbehaving toddler dispersed the memories. Albus’ eyes were more dangerous. They made him feel like it was his fault, that he deserved everything he suffered.
The tears fell silently down his partner’s tan cheeks as they always have. Draco took a step back to give his partner some privacy as his Uncle, Hadrian’s
“I’m Draco Malfoy, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle. I’m going to be a Slytherin, what house do you think you’ll be?” Laney’s tight red curls bobbed in the corner of his eye and he looked at Draco’s face. Sharp silver eyes. Hadrian paused, watching as they continued to converse.
Silence, until of course like the pop-up book from hell, his sister bolted up right and whooped. Clapping loud and clear which egged on the rest of the Slytherins and Hufflepuffs to join as he let the female professor remove the cap and he smoothly walked to the empty seat between Laney and Draco. Ignoring the incredulous stares easily as he ignored the gaze of his brother borrowing into his back.
“Lucius, Hadrian is selectively mute. Would his sister be allowed to be present? She often helps him get his message across and keeps him grounded.”
“No. Now get out.” Crabbe as the one closet to the door and on alert with Draco’s attention and aggression rose up and slammed the door back shut easily with one hand. Silencing her yelling and protests. “Good job Crabbe. You were saying Hadrian?”
“Has anyone seen a toad? A boy named Neville has lost one.” Her nasally voice was the nails on the chalkboard. Making him bristle and any contentedness in his chest die quickly, both at the interruption and the high and loud tone of voice. Draco basically growled at her.
Dark and murky, the water beneath the ice swirled agitated and aggressively. Severus placed a foot on the edge, cracking the surface slightly and gasping as the memory washed over him.
“Harry? Are you awake? Lunch is nearly ready! I’m calling your brother and father in from flying, it’s a shame you couldn’t join them.” The doorknob bent and stopped with the lock, jiggling and the door shuddered as it was tugged on. “Harry? Harry are you there? It’s Mum.”
Draco looked impressed with his knowledge, giving a nod as if pleased. “You seem to know what you’re talking about. I do hope when you say biological family and ex-brother it means you won’t be hounding to be one of those bumbling Gryffindors. I’d love to see some competent students in a more, respectable house.”
Throwing one last torture curse at Hadrian, the raven bit back a scream with a gasp. Body convulsing on the ground until James disappeared around the corner and Hadrian coughed wetly. Dragging in harsh breaths. Hadrian reached for the pieces of his broken wand and pulled them close to his chest. Not daring to move his leg.
“Okay. Draco wanted me to try something. If you know it, it’s called Legilimens. This is going to hurt unless you are aware and accepting of me going into your psyche. Would you like me to do so?” The brunet brushed his hair over his shoulder and relaxed against the table with a gentle smile.
“Forgot to warn you guys about that, sorry. If you can lock Hadrian’s dorm room Suni can’t open locks. You’ve no idea the frights I’ve gotten at three am when I heard a slam in the kitchen and found Suni attempting to pry the pantry or the fridge open.”
“I had a dream that we had a son once. He had Severus’ hair, and my eyes, the color before I was devoted to the dark arts. I don’t remember his name, but it had felt so real. I could vividly see him playing with Nagini on the floor with a stuffed dragon that had a handkerchief. I almost thought it was real when I’d woken. I think…. If we ever did have a son. I think he’d look a bit like young Hadrian does.” Severus squeezed his bicep, ignoring the twinge that screamed in the back of his head.
Pushing open the door, no elves bothered him at all. Either they were gone, or they were hiding away from the turbulent family magic. The dark haired man paused, voices were carrying down the stairs. Probably from the study. That was always where James went when he needed to brood or was stressed. It was where he hid the fire whiskey too. Sirius drew his wand and crept up the stairs, easily drifting through the halls like a silent breeze until he was peeking into the study.
Where Alex giggled madly and wrecked havoc on his broom, Harry had always looked up with those carbon copy eyes and happily sat in her lap. Listening to music or letting her read aloud to him from her charms book.
“He’s probably stalking the floo like the dungeon bat he is waiting for news, I’ll come with you. Draco? Can you go run to Gringotts and get some money out for dinner?” Mother stood up.
“Ask your son, his best friend’s father is the best lawyer in wizarding Britain. However, I am rather close with Malfoy senior as well. I’d be happy to give him your address and arrange a meeting if need be.”
Narcissa was obviously smitten with Draco’s significant other. Severus silently snickered, if she were twenty years younger she’d probably have been all over him. As it stood, she was just enamored and very pleased with the man his son reeled in.
“Laney used the distraction to catch an extra episode and stay up later. So far Anna’s keeping the tradition. Though more creatively. I found it in the freezer last night.”
Albus had been… concerned, with Harry’s attitude. He was still her sweet boy, but he seemed to resent James. Lashing out at him every time James even got close to him. Distancing himself from everyone. Even his brother. Then, when Harry had left Alex slowly began missing his brother, clammering for stories and wanting to see him again. Losing all his animosity. Just as Albus hoped Harry had.
It felt like chains had cracked and slipped off his shoulders. Leaving him raw and sore where the shackles had bit into him, but lighter than he’d ever been before. He felt free.
With a start, Laney was the one to notice Alex creeping closer to her brother’s free left side. A small tap got Anna’s attention as Laney flicked her head to the intruder. It was easy once Anna connected the dots and jealously moved to Hadrian’s left side and held her arms up. Bless his heart, the long haired brunet caved thoughtlessly, ignoring Alex and easily hoisting the tiny girl onto his hip and holding her with both arms. Alex gaped.
First was easy, Alex always bothered him at dinner, the only meal all the houses could attend at the same time. Therefore, it was fully in his rights to have his familiar. The fact Suni was under his clothes and basically out of sight was only because she loved skin contact and warmth and certainly not because of the fact the second Alex tapped his shoulder and Suni poked up and glared at him to poking her he jumped nearly a foot in the air and shrieked. His little sycophant follower run cursing up a storm about how ‘slimey snakes needed to die’ ensured disruption of the peace and got them four dentitions a piece for disruption and bullying. The point loss was devastating, but the Gryffindors seemed annoyed but indifferent.
“We have house elves do the chores really. Alex and his father fly in the backyard however, Alex is quite excited to join the Quidditch team for Gryffindor like his father.”
All his life he'd known nothing but to bend and break his own spine for the sake of others. Now forced into a marriage he never wanted, with a man who hated him beyond belief. Harry could really only see one way out, and that was throwing himself at his enemies feet and letting Death soothe away the humiliation and the pain.
The box fell open, revealing the shimmering platinum band with small diamond crusting and the ruby that was traditional for Dician weddings. It was in that second, Hadrian knew he’d been blessed. This caring, sweet man that was looking at him like he was the reason the world turned. Hadrian grinned.
“Firstly, how are the boys doing? Settling in alright?” Minerva, who’d been watching quietly started first.
Ignoring the whispering, the anger simmering underneath his skin like a boiling kettle. The eyes boring holes into the back of his head from a boy who looked to much like his nightmares for Hadrian to ever be completely comfortable. Ignoring the boy beside him who was trying to be nice and a friend to him when
One bed. Which is what he was laying on. With a dresser and a desk it looked like. The window was shut and lined with burgundy drapes (they only had blinds at home, and there was no water. Definitely not the dorms). The whole room was ivory with dark wood, gold accents, and warm red fabrics.
“C’mon, let’s’ go back down. You promised desert.” Hadrian laughed and they went downstairs and host their guests. Draco was pleased with their desert and for a small while, the war didn’t weigh so heavily on the families.
“Oh Harry, Slytherin? That’s a surprise, Alex had mentioned he was a bit upset that you weren’t his house mate too. Most of us Potters end up in Gryffindor. But how do you like it?” His chest clutched tighter, but he forced himself to choke out at least a few words. He couldn’t look weak and he couldn’t let them disrespect his house like that.
The image of a happy baby with big green eyes. Not seeing him anymore as James pushed and pushed Alex at him. The last time he’d seen his godson was the image of Hadrian looking out from the window. Eyes obscured by the window panes, hair messy long waves and laying his head down on the windowsill. Next thing Sirius knew he was gone.
His chest clenched and he felt light headed. Throat constricting painfully as he met his Head of House’s eyes. Those hard eyes softened just a bit as Hadrian’s well hidden panic and struggle. “Ah, your
Carefully, Tom handed the paper to Severus, not letting Hadrian look on it too much. It was enough to know his little boy had lived it. He didn’t need to be reminded of it. Tom watched his husband flick through the pages, as a Potions Master, Severus knew the human body much better than Tom. Severus already fair complexion went white as a sheet as he lingered on a single page, his hands brushing Hadrian’s neck. The teen stiffened and glanced at the paper.
Hadrian gagged as his twin laughed in his expense. Annabee stared confused before mirroring her brother’s look of disgust on instinct. His words were still bland, but they bounced with more cadence that Snape had heard yet when he spoke. “I love the both of you. Keep it in the bedroom and away from my eyes.”
The other boy seemed to falter when he caught sight of his biological twin, before he waved and made a motion for Hadrian to come closer. A small grin on his face and a light in his eyes that spoke of glee. Hadrian for his part gave a slow blink before turning his back to their other boy, face smooth and blank as glass.
“This, will it purge out the blood adoption? How much change should I expect then?” Tom, Dad, looked him up and down curiously, Papa was more matter of fact as he tapped the vial in Hadrian’s hands.
Hadrian hadn’t been kidding when he said he was going to use the end of school to spruce up the place.
“Be calm my boy. He’ll have been returned to the Malfoys and his adoptive mothers, he’ll be back to school after they feel it is safe enough and then we can try again. We’ll do a blood adoption and perhaps a compulsion potion just to keep him put. You shouldn’t have given him access to the library, nor kept his door unlocked.” Albus’ voice was soft with a gentle cadence, he was in a similar state of undress.
The shorter woman gave him a sweet smile, “Call me with that lawyer’s number. It’d be nice to meet Draco’s father. Hadrian and Laney positively gush about the lad. If that’s all, expect all these ‘meetings’ to stop. I’m considering you a threat to our family and I will file a restraining order if you push me or my son. Good day.”
“Brother, can we blow up a sink?” The little one cooed, Snape marveled as the cold boy he was getting to know smiled again. Hadrian held her head in his hands.
“It was so real. It had felt so real. It was real, is real.” Immediately Hadrian was swept up and crushed into the other man’s arms. Sandwiched comfortably between the two lovers as Tom hovered over both of the shorter men. His princes. The most important men in his life, Tom still stared, as if his senses were lying to him. Like Hadrian was going to vanish if he blinked. “Why can’t I remember you?”
Hadrian sighed softly as Draco’s arms wrapped around his waist and joined in his sister arguing about what and ever with the two vassals. The raven hadn’t the energy to try and even understand what Laney was trying to convince them of this time, so he just relaxed and focused on meditating until finally breakfast was finished and Professor Snape came to collect them both, Laney pouting about delaying he first day off with her kitten and new friends while Hadrian tried to float in his happy mental place.
I thought it only fair that if I posted a filler chapter, that I hurry up and bring the substance to the plot a little bit quicker than usual. I hope you all like this early update! :)
“Oh? Then you will have no issue with me lawyering up then. Just for precautions. Can never be to careful when someone’s trying to
Immediately, it felt like shackles had dragged him down. Holding him in a vice grip and leaving Hadrian no choice but to collapse to the floor and wheeze. “Crucio! Give me your wand!”
Hadrian blinked as Draco tapped his cheek. “Eyes up. You look sharp. Your mothers are the kindest people to exist that I’m not even sure their real. Severus is on our side and respected as a no-nonsense man who’s rescued countless Slytherin’s from abusive home. Laney’s a good holy terror and attached to you like an STD. And my father’s the best lawyer that exists in this country and everything is going to be alright. Don’t you trust me?”
, but Hadrian walked in from the kitchen and any soft disappointment faded away. Hadrian’s long dark hair was held up in his signature high ponytail, bangs and fringe gently curling around those wide cheeks. A short apron tightened his waist to an impossible angle and hid a good portion of his sinfully tight light blue jeans and his maroon V-neck.
If Hadrian had shorter, lighter hair, the lord and he might look similar Draco mused. But that’s assumed Hadrian would ever wear his hair short voluntarily. Draco had asked once if Hadrian would even morph his hair to be shorter than his shoulders; but the venomous reply that he was forced into one gender and one short hair-cut for nine months at school was enough even if he didn’t remember anything of school once he came home.
An icicle had formed in his chest, sharp, cold, and aching as he held his husband. His magic lashed out dangerously, shattering one of Severus’ empty vials while leaving the impromptu cauldron alone and brewing in the corner of the room. His baby. His son had suffered, and Tom was going to make sure every guilty person was punished thoroughly.
“Oh I know, this one time Laney-“ And the two were bending their heads together and grinning amusedly as they traded story after story. Erin calmly drinking coffee beside her wife and occasionally making quiet conversation with Severus across from her about various odds and ends.
.” Draco thought it was a little unfortunate that Dragma (male Dragma? They would figure this out. Maybe middle names?) didn’t laugh again or continue talking with that deep rumbling voice. Alex seemed to stew angerly at the two basically ignoring his existence. Ron, a Weasley, stayed quiet and watched with confusion.
The platinum blond looked so bewildered it made Hadrian tear into loud giggles, a hand clasped over his mouth to be as quiet as possible. Obviously understanding that he wasn’t getting it, Draco blushed a bright red all the way to his ears as Hadrian and Laney laughed hysterically, tears glittering in the brunet’s eyes when he finally calmed down and placed a hand on Draco’s shoulder. The touch felt searing in the best of ways when he got a crooked grin.
In the same house, another pair of lovers were mutedly speaking. Tom rubbing his partner’s back soothingly as his partner weathered through the anxiety attack they both had known was coming after the reveal at the bank.
The circle folded itself to create a small path that Hadrian stumbled out of. The wards were buzzing curiously at him, still recognizing him as well as not really remembering the taste of his individual magic without the family blood. They poked and prodded at him. But as he’d been here so long and still tasted of Lady Magic’s influence, they ultimately left him alone. The raven grinned, bloody and victorious.
“Well Sara, Erin. You’ve raised a well mannered and charming young man. He is visibly quite happy with you in your home, and well taken care of in it. Safe to say if legal action is attempted, we can be swift and thorough in shutting it down. That said, please do keep in touch. My wife and I would be happy to invite you to dinner, and Draco is already bugging me to invite you over to visit during the Yule break.” Sara took his hand firmly and gave a massive grin.
For a moment, Sirius remembered how it once was. Charles’ puffing smoke behind the desk, bookshelves stuffed to the brim on the wall behind him. A book on heirship in front of two young boys in front of the desk. James had groaned and whined about having to study during the summer. Sirius had barely paid attention. He wasn’t going to be an heir when his mother disowned him in favor of Reggie, so to him it didn’t matter. Sirius blinked back to the present.
Irregardless of the name loss, accio was an intent spell. And Hadrian could feel it fighting him. Trying to pull him towards James open hand. No! Nononononononono. He was so close. HE WAS TOO FUCKING CLOSE!
“You’re first years, one’s your brother and one is my godson so for tonight I’ll allow this exception. Breakfast is at eight, hurry to bed now.” Laney grinned at all four boys and snickered as they all snuck down the first year hallway to the dorm room. Hadrian rolling his eyes and brushing shoulders with Draco who stared at him with that strange look, flanked by his two vassals.
“Severus! You could have been so adorable! Look at those cheeks! I keep telling you two, once the wars over you should have a child. Mix your devastating good looks and you’d have a drop dead gorgeous son or daughter.” Lucius smiled at his wife’s teasing, but the adults quickly went quiet as both of the men in question stopped smiling. Only Severus managed a softening in his gaze.
“Really? Last I checked I’m the one who grew up with him. Oh my god this is a Twitches moment, isn’t it?” Hadrian snorted, a rather undignified sound, but it made Draco smile before listening mesmerized by the low, smooth drawl that left Hadrian’s mouth.
“Anything else we should know about sweetheart?” Hadrian took a sip of his coffee, before letting a hand wander down to slip into Draco’s back pocket cheekily. Giving his parent’s a sly wink while Draco simultaneously wanted to grin like a loon and crawl into a hole and die before his fiancé’s parents murdered him and hid the body.
“He’s also a Metamorphagus to give you a heads up.” The Lord sighed, a hand on his forehead as he leaned against his Uncle Severus’ frame. A smile was on his lips though, betraying the exasperation he tried to put forward.
“Years with no letters, no phone calls, when Hadrian was adopted your parents didn’t even look up the records and send a letter to us. And you blame me for Hadrian being disinclined to speaking with you? Maybe look at yourself, the sun doesn’t shine out your ass Potter and not everyone likes you.” Alexander spit hate right back as Hadrian felt dizzy, struggling to breath in the face of someone so like his biological father so angry. Flashes of pain and hurt and humiliation coming to the front of his mind.
Flicking a long ponytail over his shoulder, he blinked and turned his head when there was a knock on the train door. Pulling away from his thoughts he stared at a boy with platinum blonde hair stood in front of the two of them, cocking an eyebrow at his and Laney’s intertwined hands.
“My son doesn’t have to talk to anyone he doesn’t want to.” Sara turned to look at Snape, “I do want to let you know that he sometimes gets overwhelmed and let’s Laney talk for him. He’s quiet and quite sensitive despite his matureness, he doesn’t mean to be rude.”
“Oh, I know you hate James Potter, Hadrian wrote me a letter nearly hysterically laughing about how much you hated the Potters. Said he saw it, James was a cruel git to my son growing up and Hadrian remembers
The relief was like getting dumped with a bucket of ice water in the summer heat as Hadrian jotted down the answers swiftly and passed it to Laney who squinted and bit her lip.
“Met him. Didn’t like him. His ego crowds a room. Thought you didn’t want to associate with a bunch of
James had been indifferent, more focused on Alex. Alex had been distraught and angry that his brother had disappeared when they had promised he’d get to see him. Lily had been equally distressed. Searching all over Wizarding Britain and finding nothing. Until her baby showed up to the sorting. With a sister according to Albus.
Draco swallowed heavily, hands finding the brunet’s waist, careful about the snake still wound tightly around his lover’s body. He looked powerful and regal, his smile both made Draco’s heart race and his legs melt to useless jelly. Nagini hissed.
. This was the first step into learning and growing into his magic, this is where all his possibilities would blossom and grow.
Lucius shooed Severus and the women out of the door swiftly after that and made his own greetings to the first-year students. “I’m Lucius, Draco’s father, and your mothers’ new lawyer. Do you two know why you’re here?”
They were in Charms when he found out. Laney was maniacally giggling and having a bit to much fun learning the fire charm, Vince and Greg dutifully pulling books out of the radius as she experimented happily. Draco was watching with no little amount of awe and a healthy dose of fear when Hadrian felt a tap on his shoulder.
Their reputation untainted and in the clear from the hurled accusation, Hadrian had two weeks to figure out the plan to end his brother’s beloved social life and turn it into a PR nightmare when Alex did all the work for him.
The two were a sight to behold. The shorter woman was more stout, with caramel skin and brown curls that seemed to bleed warmth like a beach sun, her smile was easy and bright as another woman loomed over her. This woman was lean, with skinny but strong limbs and pin straight blonde hair that was held in a high ponytail on her head. Her eyes were cool and lips firmly in a blank scowl. Snape had to pause for a moment when the resemblance got a little two uncanny towards his newest duo of troublemakers. The shorter woman reached a hand out to him.
“Ah, none of this ma’am business. If you must call me something, you can call me Cissa for right now. Maybe something more familiar later though, hmm dear?” Draco blushed bright red at the implication, but didn’t fight it. In fact, his hand seemed to hover over the pocket furthest away from Hadrian where Severus could see a small bulge. His eyebrow raised again, he knew Draco had mentioned the heritage test, was he so confident he’d bought the ring before introducing his parent’s even?
"Are you okay? I’m sorry you had to see that.” This boy, was more worried about him witnessing his memories of abuse then he was about being forced to remember what was probably a traumatizing time in his life. Severus grabbed the teen’s forearm, firmly but not aggressively.
“If so why do you always speak for him! He’s got a mouth, but you are always putting words in it for him. Leave him alone!” Obviously the wrong thing to say as Laney became enraged. Eyes burning like a raging fire as she spit out vitrol like it was going out of style.
The raven tightened his ponytail and gave himself one last glance in the mirror. He really did look sharp. A white button up paired with a liquid black vest that clung to him like a second skin, Draco had fitted him with a sleek tie that matched his eyes and slacks that hugged all the right places. He looked good. (And his ass looked fantastic).
“I’ll stick to the basics because you’re more familiar with Dicai Wizarding Traditions, but in the British World. Which, do you remember any of that from school?” Hadrian sighed.
“You are with Crabbe, Goyle and I, I presume so. Laney can stay with us and her brother for the night.” The two siblings nodded easily, Hadrian’s arm slung around her waist and she grinned brightly.
A soft touch on his shoulder jolted him out of his spiral and he looked into Draco’s silver eyes. Concern was evident in his eyes, but Hadrian just gently shrugged it off. Ignoring his food to drape his head onto the blonde’s shoulder. Ignoring everyone else and letting the idle chatter of the other Slytherins wash over him.
“He’ll visit if that’s what he wants. And only what he wants. I won’t force my son to see the people who abandoned him.” With that the two women brushed out of the office. Severus and the Potters hot on their heels where outside the office Severus had to smother the chuckle that threatened to escape.
stood above them all, and easy smile and strong lean arms. Laney batted her eyes back and forth between the two of them.
Hadrian grinned at his Dad, “Now, since we have this all sorted out. How about you and Narcissa help me with wedding plans for after you all win that stupid British war against the old man? We have a lot of work if we’re going to win a war and pull off a marriage in a timely fashion!”
“Lucius has to ask you some questions without us around. He’s here to help us though in case the Potters try to pull some nasty actions to get custody of you. But we’ll be close by alright? Laney, take care of your brother. Hadrian, keep your sister out of as much trouble as you can.”
Hadrian surveyed the room with a quick glance and sharp eyes. Four beds, a large bathroom. Cool with dark elegance, but no windows, no escape. It both soothed him and made him crawl up the wall. Laney’s nails dug into the back of his neck and he blinked back to reality, memories of cupboard neatly shoved back into a different corner of his mind for now. Draco looked around as well, a small frown on his lips.
He tugged on Hadrian’s ponytail softly, lips pressed to his beloved’s crown. Who knew he would find his Veela mate so early in life and fall so deeply in love with him before even the bond kicked in. Draco’s fingers twitched, it was nearing the end of summer and he hadn’t even gotten to introduce his parents to Hadrian.
“Now that we’re all awake, there is something I would like to talk to you about. I was brewing last night and I brewed a purging potion for you, this is all your choice however Hadrian. Only take it if you want to.” Severus placed the bottle onto the counter and the raven studied it. The color was a nearly clear blue and it smelled like a flower field, it wouldn’t taste nearly as pleasant however he knew.
“Incareous.” Immediately ropes bound Albus helpless and Sirius stepped up from behind the two of them, wand drawn. James jumped back, wand at the ready. The man snarled at him, his forehead was still bleeding. Obviously from where Hadrian had chucked a vase at his head. Sirius gave a proud smirk. Go Haddy, he hadn’t seen that from the doorway.
I'm going to be working on a new project, however, the difficult part is deciding which project I work on first. So I'll give you two summaries and if you have an opinion. HMU in the comments! The summaries will be in the chapter notes, I'm running out of room here.
“It’s not that rare.” His voice was smooth and level, the blonde blinked quickly, staring intently as Hadrian leaned his head back. Stretching his shoulder’s back elegantly and confidently as Mother taught him commanded attention and consideration. “My biological family were all Gryffindors. I’m certain my ex-brother will be vying to go to their family house. The Weasleys are another traditionally Gryffindor house hold, like the Lovegoods are traditionally Ravenclaw. Many old wizarding families in Britain have family expectations.”
The dour man bit back a grimace, Sirius Black. Hadrian original godfather, who was enraged enough at the Potter’s actions to actually break a centuries old alliance and leave for France. Fucking over quite a few of Albus’ plans in the process. For all his faults he knew Sirius adored Hadrian and would do anything if he knew Hadrian was back. Longbottom had quietly mentioned to him while he was interrogating the Lords and Ladies that she’d overheard Sirius screaming that if Hadrian was a squib he’d forsake his magic and raise him muggle himself with Lupin.
“Suni, Hadrian, how are you this morning?” Suni scented Draco affectionately, but refused to move off of her human. Choosing to be difficult and force the raven to squirm out of his pajamas, Suni unhelpfully constricting to keep her balance.
“She’s very high up in an international bioterrorism unit. Very influential and very powerful, she’s learned to have a firm hand and an even firmer scowl.” Sara shifted and brown curls tickled under his chin. “Thank you, for watching over my children. And tolerating me snotting all over your robes.”
“I hope you have all your things of value brother. You’re coming home now.” He shrugged his shoulders, he never had anything. Harry glanced down, he could see the glittering of glass in his skin, Docile and dazed. He didn’t fight her as they weaved their way through the crowds and the people until they were at her home. Their home. Dragging him up the fire escape on the side of the building to their apartment on top, Laney went running into the house yelling and dragging a petit woman with soft brown hair and honey brown eyes holding a baby.
“Five years and I hadn’t heard a word about this?” Draco looked for help but found all three men sipped their tea and avoiding eye contact. Even Hadrian wasn’t paying real attention, instead looking intently at the snake that had slithered just beneath his crossed legs. Hadrian was obsessed with snakes and a Parseltongue, so Draco really wasn’t all surprised.
He looked so different too. Her eyes on a face she didn’t recognize. So tall as well, he’d be taller than his father if he continued growing. With long limbs and creamy pale skin, long dark hair and eyes that weren’t hidden by glasses. So cold. He looked at her as if she were a disliked stranger.
I figured I'd update because I work open to close tomorrow! Enjoy! (Also Imma ask for help picking which fic I work on next so be on top for that my friends)
“Long day.” Smiling, Hadrian didn’t look up from where he was braiding his hair for bed. It was already near three in the morning and they were all exhausted. Nagini was slumped, sleeping blissfully on the charmed heated blanket she’d insisted having on one of their nightstands after she realized Hadrian was her ‘hatchling’. It seemed she felt as if she’d failed him and Tom, now determined not to fail once more. Draco stood behind him, they’re eyes meeting in the mirror, he didn’t even blink at the blonde’s nervousness. He knew his nerves were shot, but the… abuse he’d survived allowed him to outwardly brush most things off for later.
“He has an anxiety disorder, however we put him in weekly therapy for it. Have since we found out after we adopted him, and he showed trauma from his past abuse. Otherwise, I can’t see anything. He’s a normal kid, played football, went to school, played in the park with his baby sister and his twin. Got phenomenal grades, Sara was quite proud.”
“I don’t like what you’re insinuating. My children aren’t spoiled with material goods, I want them to learn hard work and humility pays off.” Her fingers flicked, and like soldiers, Laney and Hadrian stood up. The little one smooshed between the pseudo-twins to stand in front of their Mother as their Mama watched intensely, the blonde pulled them all close against her hips. Snape watched Lily’s face blossom red with rage as her eyes glared venomously and protectively. “Money and possessions mean nothing when you’re rich in love.”
A sudden fear gripped Sirius. He knew what a horocrux was. If it was ever released. If Albus or James ever released it out of spite or to try and gain control of Hadrian it would be over. The press would call for his blood and the Ministry would stop at nothing until his little boy was thrown through the veil or kissed. They wouldn’t look for a solution. They would be like James and think only of themselves, rather than a little boy who deserved to live. A victim.
Godparents in wizarding society were as good as third or fourth parents to a child. They held nearly all the same parental rights to any child under their care. It was the reason their mothers were pleased that Severus took all three of them as his godchildren, it meant in the event of their passing Severus was next in line by the eyes of Magic. And Magic wasn’t to be trifled with in the matters of children. The fact that the Potters had denied visitation and custody to someone who
“Annabee, been a good girl for Mama and Mother baby girl? Have you? Have you!” The girl squealed happily. Grinning when her brother nuzzled her cheek, soaking up his attention and love as their Mama and Mother walked in closer, stopping to stand beside Snape.
“Mr. Potter.” Hadrian didn’t respond at first until the man behind him repeated it again and Draco tugged his sleeve. The five of them turned around and there was the dark man, Professor Snape, Head of Slytherin House. “It would do well to answer to your name, Mr. Potter.”
“He talks to her, Suni by the way. We decided if he had a gift that let him talk to snakes that he deserved to have the chance to let his gift flourish. It also helps him to have a confidant that isn’t one of us. Instant bodyguard too. He drapes her over his little sister and instantly she’s kidnap proof if he has to dart away for a minute.” Erin snorted.
Another smaller chapter, but if it makes you feel better! The next chapter was so big that I had to split it into two separate chapters lol! So you're in for a treat once I upload that!
The red head glanced around and grinned like a lune when she saw no one, keeping the Cheshire grin locked on. She pointed her own wand at her face and shot herself with a stinging hex. It sent her wand flying and her directly to the ground with a thundering smack.
“No. no.nononono.” Hadrian froze beside him, obviously hearing the screaming coming from the office. Laney was gripping at his robes anxiously, even Draco looked nervous though he hid it quite well. Pressing Hadrian behind himself and throwing on his pureblood mask. Huddled into him like scared children. Snape paused.
“Promise not to tell or make fun of me? Also, I apologize in advance Mom, I was really hoping to introduce you in much better circumstances.” The dark lord looked quizzingly at him as did his mother as he pulled out a small black flip phone from his bag and dialed the first contact. Ignoring the way his father stared at the odd muggle object in his son’s hand. He picked up on the third ring.
A knock interrupted him from his thoughts. Hadrian’s head snapped to the door. His hands immediately reaching up to worry at his tie. The door knocked again and his throat constricted, instinctively Hadrian dropped down and crawled under the band. One hand clutching at his wand, the other grabbing one of the bed posts.
In the end, there was little she could’ve done, besides what she was doing now. Getting her son his twin brother back.
Odd, but boys were reckless, and if he were Harry Potter… Harry Potter. Why hadn’t Hadrian recognized them in his home? Severus had been his professor for years, Voldemort had even seen the boy during Albus’ set up in the Tri-Wizard Tournament. Harry Potter. Oh god, Tom had almost killed his baby. That’s why Harry had lived. The Boy-Who-Lived. Magic was more than intent, it would know if he were unsound. Even under compulsion upon compulsion and induced madness, his magic knew he’d never hurt his blood. His magic had probably recognized Hadrian and had backfired to prevent him from killing his son. Thank Merlin.
Alex was nearly vibrating in excitement. When Harry had gone missing, he’d hounded for stories and pictures from his mother when his father failed to procure his brother back or give any descriptions. He was a little annoyed that he got ignored so easily, but maybe Harry was just shy. His mother had always said Harry was quieter than he ever had been. Soon enough Harry would be in Gryffindor with him and Ron though! Then he could room with his twin and they could catch up. Alex could just picture the stories they could tell each other deep into the night, Harry could apologize for leaving him.
Lily Potter disappeared with her widow’s inheritance and Alex in tow to America. Alex would only be returning for his duties as the Potter Lord. Now only a Most Ancient House. James was buried in one of the Potter family plots (Hadrian took sick glee in convincing Laney to bring him there and spitting on his grave. After all his cruelty, Hadrian was the one who had the last laugh).
“I thought I was going to say screw it and get expelled before I was even sorted when they prick started talking to us and trying to steal my brother. If he tries anything I’m severing off his limbs and beating him to death with his still bleeding arms.” Violent, the three pure bloods turned pale at the grotesque threat, but it seemed Potter- Dragma, the male Dragma, was unimpressed. Or rather unaffected.
“Oh! The Italian!” Lucius smiled indulgently as they recollected themselves, Hadrian looked a great deal calmer, legs down on the floor again. The red head had splayed herself practically across the sofa in the patent ‘take up as much room as possible’ way of sitting. One of her legs hooked over her brothers lap.
“I was hoping you’d know!” Sara laughed again. “He’s such a sweet boy, Laney’s a little devil. He really blossomed you know? When I met him he was this skinny and quiet, so quiet little boy. Bones that jutted out of his skin like they were trying to run away, bruises all over his face, and a glare that honestly unsettled me. I knew though, I knew that hurt people hurt others, usually not on purpose. So I pulled him into my fold, gave him a home, and watched him stitch himself back together. I never regret it. I love him so much.”
“I think I graduated, no one came to pick me up this year like the last few years. It’s been relieving.”
“Hadrian Dragma-Potter!” Hadrian winced as all the eyes turned to him. Shocked and confused, including the angry eyes that had been previously trained on his blood brother. He chanced a glance at the man. Onyx eyes met his and just stared. Not softly like his parent’s, but also not bitterly or angrily. More as if Hadrian were a puzzle.
James stayed quiet. The judge glared and the brunet grit his teeth agitatedly before resignedly spitting out.
Draco looked satisfied and his companions were too busy with treats from their bags to care for the conversation. “So, not twins because your adopted with different birth parents. How close in age are you to be the same year?” Laney giggled as Hadrian slumped onto her head, his boney chin digging into her crown.
“I want to go home.” Lily flinched at the cold and quiet words. James glowering at him from behind his wife and Alex looked crestfallen and upset. Looking up at his father for comfort and guidance when Hadrian glared at him more harshly. Rebuffing any attempt Alex would have made to get closer to him. Evidently, Alex remembered getting his ass handed to him and kept quiet when Hadrian drew his wand.
Draco shrugged, “I mentioned it. I didn’t want to press my luck. Especially since I’m going to be wrangling him into a heritage test at Gringotts soon for my parents.”
After breakfast James would throw him into his room, Lily had warded the door against being locked by James.
“A bad seed? Jealous monster? Waste of space? Disgrace? Squib? It’s alright, don’t panic; I see that face you’re pulling. I’m joking. I just hear the rumors. But yeah, I’m the ‘lowly’ Harry, twin of the Boy-Who-Lived.” Hadrian smirked. “Shame I’m not so lowly anymore when I’m going to show people just who they’re gossiping about. I’m going to make my family, the
Padfoot had been distraught when Harry had gone missing, he’d only visited a few times compared to his near daily visits with Uncle Moony when Harry had been there. Dad had said he was just working through his emotions, throwing himself into the Order. Now, Uncle Sirius didn’t have to grieve anymore! Harry was right there and now once he penned Mom and Dad, they could bring him back home.
Potter Manor stood proudly just as it always had when Sirius was younger. The wards curling and embracing him like an old friend, even where they were scorched at the edges. His godson’s brilliant work. The sky was dark, but when Sirius closed his eyes for a moment, he could still hear Charles’ laughter as he sat on the porch. Dorea yelling at them to come inside for dinner. James and him flying on their brooms and giggling madly as only misbehaving children could.
Harry could use his guidance in seemed, spending so much time away from home had changed him for the worst. The girl next to him, he would have to phase her out of his brother’s life and the Malfoy’s son. Malfoy had been a death eater, one of his inner circle, before Voldemort’s demise and so he was both arrogant and dangerous. Alex also couldn’t deny the curl of jealousy and anger that rose up when Malfoy stepped closer to his brother. Occupying the space that should be either his or Ron’s. The girl he didn’t know, but he did know that he didn’t like the way she was hanging on his brother. Holding hands and wrapped around his arm like an octopus. It was shameless and disgusting, especially when she whispered next to his jaw and hoarded his entire left side. She was probably a muggle born that was hoping to leech off his fame through his brother and that just would not do. Especially as Alex watched his brother lean closer to her when she spoke and roll his eyes playfully. Gifting her all of his attention.
“Malfoy Manor is out of bounds. The Prince Manor will probably be under close watch, and our other properties have been sold or destroyed.” His lord sighed softly. “I can’t think of anywhere that would be inconspicuous. An inn could turn us out, anyone have a house, not on the records?”
Instantly, she knew he was gone or injured. Annabee would never be alone and crying like that if he were able to get to her. Most of her childhood was lazing on the couch or a park bench as Hadrian kissed Annabee’s boo boos or soothed her to sleep or fed her a bottle. Hadrian never let Annabee cry for longer than a minute if it wasn’t a temper tantrum or misbehaving. And no injury, especially a bleeding one, went unaddressed for longer than it took for her raven haired brother to get his hands on the toddler.
The letters were large and done with a magenta marker, but it was perfect to Hadrian; at the bottom of the paper was a child’s drawing of two stick figures and a yellow squiggle, labeled with their names. Hadrian smiled fondly and pulled out his own parchment as his friends minded their own posts and Laney was reading their other letter.
“There’s memory loss. There isn’t a doubt about that, if it was due to any tampering either you or they covered any trace of it very well. Was your last blackout your school year?” A nod. “Then seeing as you’re out of school, I wouldn’t worry too much. If you have another blackout, let me know as soon as possible. As well as give me any people who might have been around you.”
“What’s your middle name. Both of you.” Hadrian looked vaguely curious and Leandra looked startled. Draco just smirked.
“You must call me Sara then! I’m very thankful to Severus for suggesting we meet and more thankful to you for coming. My own son has only glowing reviews about your son, and my daughter is no doubt terrorizing him. I apologize for that.”
Hadrian cocked an eyebrow. “Does that mean I need to cause a scandal? The only ‘closed door’ quirk I can think of is how shameless our mothers’ are with PDA. And that’s just so cute it’s sickening.”
Laney herself right now was kicking a football, dodging between Greg and Vince as she both taught them football and proceeded to curb stomp them at the sport. He knew later they were going to be teaching her Quidditch and it’d be their turn to dominate in a game.
“It’s common knowledge how much the Potter’s value family and their children. The Potter’s quite obviously love their son, and they love Harry just as much. Any actions made were regrettable, but it was all to protect what they thought was a squib sibling from dark wizards that targeted the family. If you believe in the love of family, you’ll return young Harry to his parent’s loving arms and let him learn to regain his place in his rightful family.” As Albus sat down, Lucius smoothly got to his feet. Hair neatly pulled back.
“Oh.” Hadrian opened his mouth, but it almost looked as if he choked on air before he clamped his mouth shut and drew his legs up to his chest. One hand beginning to tug anxiously at his ponytail and his gaze settled just over Lucius’ shoulder, glassy and unfocused.
Dumbledore cleared his throat, “Yes, I see. You mentioned Alex was quite upset when he met his brother again after so long. Do you know what happened?”
He remembered quite a bit from before he was abandoned and then was adopted. He remembered getting ignored by them all Mother and Father fawning over his brother. Sirius playing with his brother, Remus reading to him. Dumbledore showing him magic and teaching him theory. While he sat and watched. No one coming to play with him, or read to him, or teach him. Eventually even watching was above him and he was locked in his room for
“This may not offer much comfort, but all my charges are under my care. They are my snakes and as such I won’t let anyone hurt them. Hadrian may have been my godson when he was a Potter if Lily had forgiven me for my mistakes. I owe him for not seeing what they’d done and letting my hatred of his father blind me to shielding him.”
Well, that was one way to announce their arrival. A barely there look of scolding crossed his eyes, before he painted on his blank mask. Hand still clutched in Laney’s, his chest froze though. A bubble filling his throat and leaving him dizzy and breathless. He couldn’t do it. Oh god. God. God. Laney squeezed his hand. And stepped to break his line of sight easily and protectively. Snape stood steadily behind him as the world spun slowly.
Hadrian gently shut the book and pushed it away from him. It disappeared with a pop, back to wherever Tippy had pulled it from for him along with the empty plate. The raven tugged nervously at his misshapen ponytail and got up. Limping back to his room and resecuring the tie against his calf. Making sure he left no mark of his night wonderings. Hadrian sat down, regathering the pieces of his shattered wand, he held them against his chest as he let his thoughts gently circulate.
“I’m technically a half-blood. Muggleborn mother and Pureblood father. I disowned myself from them however due to… circumstances. And I lived with the worst of muggles that were my relatives, but only for a month or so. Laney’s always had accidental magic, so even though no one’s got a clue her blood status there was no doubt she’s a witch. That being said, any help would be appreciated. There’s a difference between knowing the basics of a society and culture and actually being immersed in it.”
He could hear James thundering footsteps getting closer as the front door flung itself open and Hadrian tore himself out of the wards. Momentarily stunning James as it shouldn’t have been possible with his Head of House Order. Shouldn’t have been possible if Hadrian were still a Potter.
“Hey Draco, where do they put our luggage? They kept both our animals with it and I’m worried for them.” Draco gave a firm pat on her shoulder before maneuvering to walk between the two siblings. Crabbe and Goyle flanking behind by a step and forming a protective ‘V’ formation. Hadrian was rather impressed with the practiced smoothness of the gesture.
Something about that didn’t sit right with her. But, he husband was an Auror, he knew the law better than she did. And she missed her little Harry. Everything would be okay, if Albus and James agreed nothing could go wrong. So, she didn’t question him. Only smiled warmly, brightening as he smiled back.
“Laney wanted to play and those two are attached at the hip so naturally Hadrian joined to be with his twin.” James’ smile fell, turning into a scowl.
“Mama, it’s expensive. But, I’m going to need so much more therapy.” Mama laughed with him loud and unhinged, gulping in breaths between laughs and sobs with him and rocking him in her arms and her lap. Kissing every strand of hair on his head and every piece of exposed flesh. Careful not to touch his profusely bleeding leg.
“Stop manipulating your brother Anna, we both know you have him wrapped around your finger.” Her cold eyes glanced toward the family sitting next to her kids and Hadrian felt the temperature in the room plummet at least fifty degrees. Immediately she and her wife were firmly planted between their kids and the other family. Sara was the first to speak, and even she’d lost her care free smile.
Hell, if Hadrian hadn’t met Draco, he might have been ‘Potter’ full time. Slipping into whatever twisted role and mind-melding was forced on him. He’d never known his birth parents, maybe never even known his mate.
“Haden! Haden!” Alex’s chest burned when that gained the first ever full blown smile he’d ever seen from his twin in all of their days together at home and now at school. It didn’t feel fair. He was his brother. He should get Harry’s smiles. His attention and doting. Instead, he watched as his taller brother curled around and coddled the tiny girl with his whole body, sharing his space with both girls that were
Finally, the feeling ebbed and faded away, leaving Hadrian a little shaky but otherwise fine. Hadrian opened his eyes to look up at his Dad who froze, he stayed still to let the older man trace the skin just beside his eyes.
Lily frowned and James sighed, watching her lightly pick at her food. Dark rich summer red hair curled like a waterfall around her face. Framing adorable freckles and those forest green eyes he’d be enraptured by since first year. Seeing her so unhappy always broke his heart. Which is why he couldn’t tell her everything. It would only upset her. If he kept it quiet, then he could wait until Albus let him tell the whole truth and she’d understand it was what he had to do. What had to be done.
Severus was sat on one of the chairs beside Lucius, the two mothers were sat in front of them on the couch in his office. Tea and coffee sitting and ever warm mugs on the coffee table between them as well as a pile of documents in front of the blond lawyer.
There was definitely a resemblance between the two. Potter had the same general facial structure and their hair was the same shade of dark black-brown. That was about the end of their similarities however.
“Oh, I’m leaving. And you’re not stopping me.” Alex’s eyes widened, before he began screaming his head off for James. Hadrian only grinned wider. And slapped him. Alex paused with wide eyes.
“I remember the basic governing style. Some goblin wars from history class. Honestly, I barely remember the classes, most of what British wizarding skills I know I taught myself from my school books. I only remember the creepy headmaster really. It’s like from the moment he picks me up to the moment he drops me off is a giant blur.” Draco frowned.
He tried to use that time to nap a bit as he’d stay in his room, James too busy with Alex to remember that Hadrian wasn’t there to eat dinner or lunch. Lily often drifted towards his room, holding one of her books and asking if he’d like to read with her.
Was gonna wait to post! But I got too excited. I'm going to try and wait a few days between updates, but what harm can one early update really do?
“I always wanted a sibling, but my mother said I was blessing enough. I really think she just can’t have more children and didn’t want to think about it. Having a kinda twin must be cool. I never caught your name however?” Hadrian blinked. Oh right. He just assumed Laney introduced him.
Laney cursed, “Damn it, I wasn’t done plotting. Oh well, we only have double potions then we can do and hide out in the common room can’t we? Or grab Suni and use her to ward off any of the Gryffindor.”
Hadrian leaned back and examined his lists. Every second here was a chance for him to be injured. And even complying meant suffering under the hands of James cruelty and Lily’s ignorance. What did you pick when there were no good options left?
Instantly the waterworks started again full force. “T-they want to ta-take my son. My son! They want to take him away! I can’t, I can’t, I can’t…” Severus was prepared for it when the woman collapsed. Grabbing her and holding her up as she sobbed incoherently, rage began licking at his heels like a loyal lap dog.
“Erin works in a dangerous job, we have all her ducks in a row. I admit though, there’s a bit of lack of plan if both of us were to pass anyway… We want the kids to stay together and have all of our assets going into a trust for their care. However the only back up plan we have are my parents and they are getting quite old.”
With a cruel snarl, James threw a cutting hex from the safety of the wards. Hadrian gritted his teeth and held back a scream. Why did that man fucking love destroying his leg so much. Luckily, Hadrian had practice ignoring pain. So he kept running.
The rest of the trial went about the same, Albus touting the idea of family and love as well as trying to destroy any credibility the Dragma-Anderson household had. Which didn’t work as Lucius viciously and expertly destroyed any doubts and turned back the accusations on the Potters, who were much less prepared for such accusation. Hadrian rolled his eyes discreetly as many Lords were beginning to look at the Potter’s with distain. Especially when his therapist brought up his PTSD and abandonment issues from being tossed at his relatives when he was old enough to remember everything. The few purebloods who agreed with tossing a squib relative always did it young or obliviated the child of the magical world. Obviously, the Potters were hoping Albus and their fame would be enough to ride the coat tails to victory.
Outcast at home, outcast at school. There's never been a break for him. Not for the Freak of the Dursley house, until unexpected people brings pasts to light and suddenly. It seems that he finds the chance he'd been waiting his l I f e for.
“Don’t we have to get sorted now? Oh! They’re calling names! Boys let’s roll!” Leaning out of her brother’s arms, neither boy had time to react as Laney grabbed Hadrian and Draco by their robes and shoved them forward merrily. A skip in her step as she separated her brother and friends from the massive prick. “Vincent! Gregory! Let’s go boys, we’re holding up the line!”
“The twins are doing well in my care. I was short a bed on the first night. But it seems Laney and Hadrian made friends with my godson earlier in the day and they had no problem sharing a room until another bed could be procured for Laney in the dorms. Draco seems rather thrilled to have brought the two into his friend group. However, Suni has been terrorizing some of the students by, opening doors at random?” Sara snorted.
“Then tell the aurors where Potter Manor is and let them check on the Potters, if they’ve done nothing wrong there is no harm in that?” Snape finished it was a satiric smile that had even Albus pausing nervously. They all looked extremely guilty. Severus was only one of many who were hounding him. The Potters were behind wards, he was in front and center at the school fielding Auror Inquiries and Howlers from many Lords and Ladies.
“Come out on the balcony with me.” Hadrian didn’t fight or question it as he let Draco pull him up from the vanity and lead him to their small master patio. Hadrian’s herbs swayed softly in the brisk night wind, still blooming in the beginning spring. The stars shone brilliantly above them, making Hadrian smile with tired eyes. He’d never get sick of this view.
“Perhaps I’ll talk to Uncle Sev after classes today, we can’t spend the rest of first year hiding in various alcoves and being sandwiched by Vince and Greg, as much as your protection is appreciated.” The boys grunted in agreement as Laney patted their arms. Her wavy auburn hair fanning out behind her.
“I still think I could punch him.” Hadrian pinched his sister’s arm. She simply ignored his silent warning and continued plotting with Draco and his vassals. The raven sighed softly and continued twisting his ponytail between his fingers, food untouched on his plate. His chest was too tight and knotted to even think about food right now, and it gave him better focus to swipe at Laney each time she reached for something with dairy in it.
“Alex is doing wonderfully, the Weasley boys and him have been thick as thieves, the loud and rambunctious lot they are.” Snape figured this was his turn now as he kept a vigil on the two mothers’ side.
Sara walked closer and gently massaged her wife’s arm. Leaning into her partner and humming quietly. “Hush my love. We adopted Hadrian legally and have provided for him and raised him since he was seven. If they want to fight us. They can fucking
McGonagall reappeared in the doorway of the school, “Students! Come in, it’s time for the sorting to start!”
Draco was sitting beside him as Laney sat across from him. Crabbe and Goyle sandwiching her protectively. The lunch table was crowded, pressing the blonde tight against his side in a way that made Hadrian hold back a blush as he enjoyed the warmth. The blonde was chewing slowly as his eyes wandered speculatively across the hall.
“Or you won’t touch this ass for a month.” For emphasis, Hadrian slapped his own ass and swayed his hips enticingly as the brunet sauntered to the kitchen. Draco gaped quietly before reaching out both his arms.
“I gotta use the restroom first.” Mama looked around the hall, it was beginning to wind down, and everything looked safe enough.
Hadrian cocked his head to the side, sitting on the bed that had his trunk in front of it. Laney was kneeled in front of it, rifling in it for nightclothes. “I prefer showers, wonder where they put my trunk. Oh! Suni, hi! Go to your daddy I need his clothes.” The three purebloods watched with wide eyes as a large yellow snake flopped out and quickly slithered up to the boy on the bed which made him smile. Looking so calm and so… powerful. Draco drank in the sight as Hadrian leaned back, all lean muscle and gentle motions as he stroked the large snake’s scales, contented hissing erupting every now and again. “Marissa! My cuddly baby.”
“Harry… we just want to be a family. I’m your mother! I’m sorry I wasn’t there for you, I want to be here for you now.” She tried to step closer, but Hadrian shuffled to keep the bed between them. James loomed behind her staring at something, Alex was looking at him beseechingly. Lily had enough sense to stop trying to get closer.
Settling down. Hadrian stripped to just his thin button up and his slacks. It was better to do it naked, but if he needed a quick escape he’d need clothes so he didn’t streak through Potter Manor. (Though the idea of escaping James while buck ass nude did inspire a delirious sort of hysterical amusement). These were the lightest clothes here. Plus, he couldn’t bring himself to put on the hand-me-downs in the closet. He’d rather feel disgusting physically than subject himself the mental torture the past would conjure up in his mind. The circle was blood, but just in case, he held his hands up and keep his weeping injury skyward and began to mutter, feeling the circle closing and encasing him. Unable to move until it was finished.
“Now, I hate to say this. However in the event of your untimely death do you know where your children would go?” Sara patted her wife’s knee.
Scrambling, The raven grabbed the concrete walkway with both of his hands and dragged himself forward and squirmed until he was in the ward lines. He felt bad for bleeding all over the Malfoy’s nice walkway and leaving what were probably startling drag marks. But he was finally safe from any of the Potter nut heads. Though, he probably had some time before James or Albus came calling to the Malfoys either way.
The young boy didn’t look much like Snape would have expected at all if he were honest. Alex was the James’ clone he’d hated to see, but his supposed Squib twin looked similar but not the same. He looked more like Lily’s father, with those haunting green eyes. Hair neater than any Potter he’d ever seen. Female Dragma’s hair was wilder than his, bright red hair that looked like a more groomed rat’s nest. A handful, and he just seemed quiet.
Hadrian felt a similar grin tug at his lips to read HAYDEN in bright pink crayon on an attached letter. Handing off their mother’s letter to Laney he decided to read his baby sister’s  letter first.
“HADRIAN!” The boy blinked tiredly and jumped when arms looked around him like a vice. Nearly struggling until the scent of brown sugar assaulted him like a brick to the face. Tears hot and burning welled up in his eyes as he desperately wrapped his own arms around her. Feeling her hands clawing nearly painfully at the back of his head and his back.
Snapping back, Hadrian bit his tongue hard. Shit. Maybe he did need more therapy after all if this was what happened when he stopped going… The raven shook it off. He just needed to survive this meeting with the headmaster and take it one day at a time.
“Twitches has a completely different context, different age, was a muggle movie of magic and I’m a man if you hadn’t noticed?” The red head giggled into her brother’s shoulder.
Green eyes shot open, blue skies were replaced with the smooth ivory ceiling of their dorm room. The covers were heavier than normal on his, which made sense when he felt a snoot nudging at his jaw from under the duvet. Hadrian let a hand reach up to massage Suni’s head, eyes still locked onto the seeing. Mind running and not really comprehending that real life existed for a moment.
“You’re so fucking beautiful, never talk about yourself like that again.” Hadrian finally cracked a smile, Draco could feel it hovering just under his bottom lip as Hadrian looked at them with those mesmerizing eyes. The scars, the emotions, the strength Hadrian had for enduring them; they were all Hadrian’s and it was all beautiful to him.
There was a certain humiliation in being trained in defense from the age of six and getting curb stomped by your ‘squib’ brother who decided silent casting the entire time sounded like a great time.
The headmaster’s office was cluttered and messy, it gave Hadrian hives and made him nearly twitch at Laney’s side. Even his more messy and excitable twin seemed a little discontent with the mess, and then she was downright murderous when she looked at the desk.
“Shh. Sara, it’s okay. No one’s going to take Hadrian from you two. He’s Dragma-Potter on the registry, which means you have a claim on him How you adopted him is binding and legal. He’s your son no matter what lies Albus and the Potters try to feed you. He’s also your son in his heart. He looks to you like you hung the moon and all the stars. I caught him helping Laney pry off room sign to give to his little sister.” Sara gave a water laugh into his collarbone.
“Bodies are fluid, so I tweak myself depending on my mood. Kinda like when I’m working out and I get rid of the dick to be more comfortable. As for me now… sort of effortless, my scars are ugly so I smooth them over. But everything else is
“It’s a pleasure to meet you Hadrian.” The crooked grin looked so innocent in that moment that Draco almost laughed hysterically as Hadrian grabbed her hand with both of his.
“No one’s going to expect us to be up for a while now, so I think we can spare an hour or two…” Dray looked up at him, flushed and looking so adoring and lovingly at him, with a healthy amount of pure love and lust. Hadrian squeezed his thighs against the hips underneath him, admiring the shudder of his lover and letting their joy bleed deep into the night.
“Biologically? No clue. Mama and Mother are aware of magic, Mama has none. Mother might, but she was never schooled and I don’t think she’s ever been interested in pursuing it more than she has already for herself. But both of them worked really hard to work both the wizarding world and the muggle world into our home. Especially when this moron was adopted.” Laney jerked a thumb at him. Hadrian picked up the que.
“Think nothing of it. I’ll get your rooms ready. Draco, let’s leave them to relax for a moment. You’re going to be helping me.” Draco went to protest, but Hadrian only had to glance at him with a single brow raised before Draco was standing up. Abandoning his plate.
So, this is the part where I tell you last night I basically got possessed and wrote the entirety of the fic. There is four chapters left and I'm debating to publish chapters and wait for a moment between each or if I'm just going to hail mary it and post them at one a day and wrap this up swiftly.
“Boo-hoo.” A ghost of a smile fluttered on his lips when she tugged his ponytail with a swift tug in irritation at his bland attention. It was at least his full attention.
“This school year is going to be hell. That insufferable headmaster is still in charge even though he’s been bedridden. I want to stay here.” Hadrian nuzzled into his arms, making Draco sigh. The warm sun was kissing his skin comfortably as they sat on the beach’s bench.
Soon the brunet was moving back into the room, grinning past the snake vying for his attention as he placed down the big dish in the center of the table. Draco almost drooled, but stuck to look at Hadrian with utter admiration.
“See? It’s ugly.” Severus looked at him with such sorrow and Tom’s arms squeezed tighter against his waist. But both were overshadowed by Draco finally butting in and stomping over. Grabbing his mate’s face and slamming his lips over the other’s forcefully until he yielded, melting against his long time boyfriend’s grasp. Draco pulling back with a sharp gasp.
The only thing that held him back from lunging at the little prat was the pain in his leg, the fear of death, and James Potter glaring at him as if daring him to disobey. As it stood, Hadrian found it easier at each meal to ignore the food and everyone there. Let himself waste away and laugh as the ones who ‘loved’ him. Simply watched it happened.
When Hadrian explained what his goal was Laney was immediately on his side. A mad grin on her lips. Draco was resolute as well, Greg and Vince were basically Laney’s whipping boys rather than Draco’s vassals anymore so they were obviously not going to object. He’d let Lucius destroy the Potter’s legally.
“You’re just pissed that you can’t find your brains behind your brash courage. My brother is fine where he is and the sooner you accept that the happier we all will be.” Alexander’s temper finally snapped.
Draco wishes the summer had stayed forever. His body ached from running, his mother and father were on either side of him. Their lord and his Uncle Severus were running close behind, shouting defensive spells and shields until they were able to get out of the Hogwarts wards to apparate with a loud crack.
“That’s… awful. That’s like Urbosa wanting me dead when I was declared to have a dark affinity. Magic is of the soul and the body, morals of evil and good are of the heart and mind. They have no link besides how you use them together. The most evil king in our history was a light sorcerer, our greatest had no magic at all. Why would he want you dead?”
Eventually, they finally ended their trip at Gringotts. Draco was nearly vibrating with excitement. Hadrian just rolled his eyes and dismissed his hyperness easily enough. His mother and their lord decided to go to some of the clothing shops, he could hear them debating color schemes the moment they had separated. Uncle Sav and his father had decided to accompany the boys to get Hadrian’s test. Because of the Malfoy status at the bank they were given a private room to get the test. It was a rather easy one. Hadrian was given a dagger and instructed to place seven drops of blood into the quill so it would begin to write on the various pieces of parchment.
Hilariously enough, the killing blow didn’t even come from Lucius, but rather Dowager Longbottom, Neville’s grandmother. She was wearing a lace trimmed dress with a large hat as was her usual appearance. She had a stern frown on her face with disproval heavy in her eyes, Hadrian suddenly remembered that Neville had grown up suspected to be a squib until nearly age ten. Draco grinned beside him.
A loud crack startled Hadrian. The raven whipped around only for something hard to smash into the back of his skull. Dropping like a rock, he hit the ground with a loud smack, Annabee falling from his arms. Distantly, he could hear her screaming and crying, but he couldn’t reach her. Moaning in pain as his head spun and pounded, he blindly groped the floor. Trying to blink the blood out of his eyes and find his baby sister as she continued to cry. Before he shrieked as a foot crushed his leg underneath its weight and a wand fell into his squinted view.
“Making sure I’m not horrifying our new godfather, that my grades are fine. Oh, and that that little pleb isn’t bothering you too much.
Laney and Annabee giggled as Mama swooned under one of Mother’s arms. Leaning her body against her wife’s side. “You’re such a charmer Er-bear. Keep this up and maybe I’ll extend my break to go a little while longer when we get home…”
Laney was soon in front of him, but he firmly held the smaller girl to his chest when Laney tried to relieve him. Hadrian looked up at his friend with a bright smile that she’d never seen on him, eyes more alive than any fire and misty as his voice cracked and rasped.
“How did you raise them, they’re obviously magic and you’re…” Not was the unspoken word, as least Lily was semi-polite about it.
He was supposed to be brought back home when he went to Hogwarts. Hogwarts was the safest place on earth, and keeping two preteens safe when they could listen and understand the things at stake as easier than trying to keep two children safe. James hadn’t been so optimistic. He just didn’t understand. Alex was his son. Harry was
“I think I graduated last year seeing as the old coot never showed up to get me for school. Which means I can finally work full time and get the house ready. Actually build up savings for us. No, using your parent’s money is not going to be included in my mind. I need to meet them by the way. We’ve been dating for five years and mates for a year, when will I not be your side hoe?” Draco chuckled into his love’s hair, letting him ramble on and on in the sweet sunlight.
“Yes, that should be fine. He can speak with Hadrian’s therapist Nina too if he wants a better overview of his history.” Lucius jotted some notes down with his quill.
Still, nothing, even sweet memories could compare to the soft humming that was coming from the kitchen. Voldemort looked wary, hand at his wand with Severus also at the ready. Nagini curled around both her masters’ feet. Draco stepped forward, letting his school bag drop to the floor noisily.
All those lonely nights, bleeding, starving and locked in a cabinet because they were ‘his only living relatives’. All the scars on his face, on his back, the hatred that they had instilled in him so much so that he hated how he looked without morphing in the mirror. Running for his life when he was nine and losing the careless childhood he could have had.
She was a true task master. In charge of his physical therapy and healing, she pulled no punches. Forcing him to do his exercises daily and dragging his ass into doing the most helpful and horrid things imaginable. Whether it was forcing him to walk up and down the manor stairs until he was shaking from the effort, or tossing him into the pool with his arms bound and a bubble head charm to get him to tread water with his bad leg. He probably wouldn’t have healed as completely if it weren’t for her firm but well intentioned love.
Laney’s jaw was hanging out of her head as she stared, openly gawking before shutting her mouth and grabbing onto the side of his robes. Easily, he threw an arm over her shoulder. He’d gained a decent amount of height when he joined his real family. When a tap on his shoulder had him breaking his reverence to glance behind him. Breath freezing like ice in his throat.
but Laney had wanted to see him at least once a week since… then. So, his feet had dragged him out of his cupboard and came back to her as promised. Blood was dripping from a cut on his eyebrow, dripping into his eyes. His skin was almost white as a ghost, tainted with water color purple bruises over his jaw and arms, breathing hurt. He looked like death walking. Laney had grabbed his hands as he stayed silent. Fury lit in her blue eyes like a raging inferno, it shrieked and screamed like a dragon, almost too big for her body, bulging at the seams. His hands were bloody and ice cold in hers.
His Papa choked as Hadrian skipped out of the room and tackled his beloved in his arms. Nagini hissing delightedly and the Malfoy’s snickering quietly at his parents.
The magic of the place whisked away the time all through the female professor’s speech until she left them to prepare for their sorting. Hadrian was peacefully listening to Laney questioning Crabbe and Goyle with Draco’s help when he heard a voice that made his heart pound in his ears. Blood rushing and loud. It made him angry. It made him feel powerless. It made him feel vicious. Hadrian snatched Laney’s hand as Draco immediately picked up his new friend’s worsening mood and saw exactly the cause.
“What do you want?” Snape rolled over the thoughts in his head. Seems the mildly terrifying anger was on both sides. Good to know. Lily looked cowed however, holding a sulking Potter clone in her arms tight as James frowned deeply.
Snape felt any lingering doubts of Hadrian being his father’s son fade away from the back of his mind. He more had to worry about the adoptive twins being like their mothers than his tormentor.
“How long have you and my son been together?” Hadrian peeked at him, a hand squeezing his knee under the table.
He bounced Annabee in his arms as he wondered what restaurant his mothers were going to choose to celebrate; he hoped it was going to be a sushi place. Honestly, there was nothing more he loved than a spicy tuna roll and Suni was always happy as a clam when he brought home some smoked salmon for her to munch on. His spoiled little girl. She was probably lazing around in the Malfoy’s sunroom, she was going to adore the self-heating basking spot he got her for Christmas (now Yule). If Marissa didn’t harass her too much to share in the warmth.
Snape rolled his eyes, “Basil is hatred. The original meaning was, before it became love. However I favor sticking to what flowers meant before people tried to beautify their meanings with false pleasantry.”
“Of course it is, I have magic too you know. We’re letting the adults work over whatever issue they bumped into, and besides. You promised me an explanation. Not that I’m not delighted to house your relatives, you know I love guests and hosting. Even if my ‘other’ needs fall to the wayside.” Hadrian’s nails dragged down his boyfriend’s chest, he grinned at the shudder his actions elicited. “So. Talk.”
The castle loomed in the night sky like a fairy tale. Grand and so beautiful it was like a light house, beckoning them home. Hadrian’s lips pulled into a smile that his sister quickly mirrored, giddiness welling up in his chest.
“You have the adoption papers?” Sara handed over her file of copies. “Perfect, and what can you tell me about your professions?”
The courtroom was already packed with the Lords and Ladies as they shuffled their way to the defendants area. Hadrian bit the inside of his cheek, glancing either way, paling a bit when he caught sight of the Headmaster.
Alexander lit up as Hadrian’s gaze slid over to him. “Harry! Why have you been sitting with the snakes, come on. You should be with me don’t you think? We should be catching up, I haven’t seen you in years. Please?” Draco snorted.
With a blink of Draco’s eye, Hadrian had whipped out his wand. A rather plain, but efficient weapon as with a flick of his wrist and a murmur all the candles in the house flickered to life. An impressive show of magic, Draco had half a mind to swoon. Especially as the tension seemed to relax and dissipate almost immediately once Hadrian’s wand rested innocently on the table. His mother smiled brightly.
. It was unnerving really when Alex tapped on his shoulder and received that look. His eyes held nothing in them, not even a twinkle of the bright light that was in his mother’s eyes usually. He was unfocused, and Alex felt particularly insulted when instead of talking to him, the girl basically glued to his brother answered for him.
The hat seemed to give a pleased hum at not being shoved any particular way and shouted loud and clear.
The blond was leaning against the tree with him. Their hands were intertwined and those grey eyes covered with some of the most uppity muggle sunglasses Hadrian had ever seen. Suni was splayed across his lap, her golden scales creating a contrast to the other boy’s porcelain skin. Hadrian glanced at the couples and groups around the garden and back to Draco’s hand, twisted so firmly in his own.
“You’re a little tanner, but not unrecognizable from how you looked before. Would you like to see?” Hadrian nodded swiftly, letting his father, Dad, (Having two fathers was slightly confusing with titles, he could finally sympathize with his sisters in the homeland with multiple mothers) support him to the bathroom. The Malfoys stayed quietly in the kitchen. Hadrian peered into the mirror.
“Narcissa would be disappointed if you didn’t bring the child. She’s rather smitten with them, our biggest regret is not being able to have more of our own children. Although even just one child was a bit of a handful to raise with accidental magic.”
“Dining tables in the kitchen, gimme your coats.” His father almost abolished him for his rude abruptness, until their lord laughed. Long and deep, it rumbled in the air.
Though, as a Veela, Draco only had one mate for the rest of his life. It made sense that he was unafraid of commitment, especially with someone he already felt attached too. Severus smiled into his coffee. The adoring looked Hadrian kept sending at Draco made his feel reassured that his godson was in good hands. Lucius leaned forward.
“You act like our son isn’t just as pussy whipped by his baby sister. I seem to remember him insistently taking some of her midnight fusses, even if we were already awake.” Albus quickly interrupted, this wasn’t going the way he’d planned at all. He was going to have to recollect and regroup. Perhaps a little more forcefully this time.
Hadrian shrieked, his back arching to an extreme angle. There was no fight in him left when James manhandled him and yanked his wand out of his wrist holster. Snapping it in half right in front of the younger boy’s eyes. Hadrian felt like his rib cage had cracked. Watching his wand fall to pieces before him. It hurt more than any beating James could dole out.
“Alexander Potter!” The hall and its boisterous energy hushed as Alex sauntered onto the stage. Evidently, he was quite used to the spot light as he didn’t even bat an eye to the feeling of everyone’s attention on him. A small glance showed many faces, all curious, a couple scornful and glaring. He’d ask Draco who the man with long dark hair at the head table was later. He looked positively murderous with that sneer.
‘No, he wasn’t. Laney was a little bit. She was just neurotic and didn’t care about other people’s opinions of her though.’
Apparently, Laney had not stolen a sink. But she had gotten away with taking a faucet by Halloween. Uncaught by everyone except the Weasley twins, who were in the midst of stealing a toilet seat.
“Hadrian is much scarier than you, if Potter weren’t so obsessed with him we could probably get Hadrian to cow him into submission with a glare.”
The blonde fell to the ground, panting as the adults followed him. They all crowded into a small dark alley. Uncle Severus was bleeding from a small cut on his forehead, but overall, they were safe. For now.
“You corrupted him. He’s a lion like the rest of us Potters on the inside.” Laney rolled her eyes and pressed into Hadrian’s side as he struggled to breathe again. He sounded so much like James it was scaring him. Soft hands gently intertwined with his and squeezed.
“My parents bought us a house near base as a wedding gift. I make a decent income from my business, but Erin makes quite a bit of money from her job. 60,000 a year roughly, more if there is an attack and she’s deployed to get it under control. So our bills are rather low, her sec is international, so her superiors give us some money for housing as well. We have a decent savings and investments in both Gringotts and the muggle world. I also bought stock in Microsoft when it was founded in 1975,” Sara winked. “Sufficient to say in a few more years my net worth is going up.”
“Because Alexander and Potter are right di-“ Hadrian elbowed his sister swiftly in the ribs, making her wheeze. “very annoying people I meant. I’m assuming something happened with the Potters and our parents?”
“Christmas, when he was nine. You screamed when I told him to let her wreak havoc on the neighbor’s mouse problem.”
“Tutoring. Eight o’clock Friday night Esmerelda. Piers, eloquently written. Twenty points to Slytherin for teamwork and correct answers. See me after class, both Dragmas.” Laney’s head dropped to the desk with a thud and Hadrian just nodded easily and continued taking his notes. Draco snickered quietly and later on in case Hadrian and Draco watched in awe at the complete failure Vince, Greg, and Laney were making of their potion. Their own was simmering and giving off a soft silver vapor. The other’s had black billowing smoke.
“Children.” All three of her kids stilled and looked at her immediately, Snape was impressed. He wished his snakes were as easily to wrestle into submission. Lily just glared jealously at the ease the woman showed in commanding her daughters and Lily’s son when she herself struggled to wrangle Alex and her husband under control on a daily basis. “No fighting. Why don’t you wait outside? I’m sure Annabee wants to tell you both all about her first day of kindergarten.”
Alex and Harry hadn’t gotten along as children, especially when Alex began his tutoring. Harry had always looked at her with such sadness when she had to stop reading to him to work on teaching Alex to read. James hadn’t helped. Not understanding how his sons could be so different from each other, and one so different from him.
His husband shook his head slowly, watching carefully as Severus pulled thin and callused fingers against his pulse point. “It’s the artery that leads to the brain, a laceration the scroll described would have killed him in minutes. That’s why he was magically exhausted that year, his magic was the only thing that kept him alive. We could have lost our son Tom! And we would have no idea what we’d lost.”
Snape rolled his eyes, “I’m aware. Draco and Laney ganged up on an unfortunate Gryffindor yesterday in Potions when Hadrian continued to be unable to speak in my class. My house is filled with more introverted students so I don’t expect it to be an issue. Your daughter’s rowdiness is definitely the more… noticeable quirk between the two.” Erin gave a half smirk that mirrored Laney’s easily.
Hadrian’s own presence was quieter, like a calm stream without a sound, it soothed Draco’s still sensitive capacities as an empath. His hair was pulled into a sleek and long high pony tail, falling smoothly down his spine, the only hint of any messy curls was nestled under his ponytail and the baby hairs that skewed down his hairline and the gentle curves on Harry’s fringe and bangs. Harry’s eyes were a bright and intelligent green, with a tall and lithe figure that spoke of grace and easy elegance. Not standing out like a peacock, but still commanding respect and attention.
“Of course Lucius, I’d be delighted to do dinner with you and your wife. I have a toddler if that’s okay?”
So Alex not only was responsible for points lost (an extreme 50 points) and detention for a month, Laney was also extremely well liked by quite a few people in all the houses. She was fun loving, and chaotic while still being sensitive and kind. Social rating for Alex plummeted. The most important consequence was one he hadn’t seen coming.
Albus was quick to try and do some damage control. “Now, we weren’t insinuating anything like that-“ Erin glared at him and Sara grinned.
“Stay still, I need to fix your tie.” Draco was in his space, long and thin pale fingers working at the tie around his neck. Basically sharing the same breath, but Hadrian didn’t want to pull away. It felt warm and comfortable.
It took ten minutes for them to get ready and another ten to drag Laney out from her dorms. (Another five to get her to stop mooning at his bare arms and making suggestive comments. Draco pointedly tried not to stare at what were some nice biceps for a preteen). They made it to breakfast on time however and sat next to Crabbe and Goyle on the end. Marissa was on Laney’s lap mewing up a storm and demanding bacon from his sister’s plate. Hadrian hid a smirk. Simply eating and relaxing until the post came swooping down. Draco got his customary letter from his parents and Laney grinned as a letter from one of the postal owls dropped into his hands.
Draco huddled between his own parents lost in his own thoughts as his parents murmured above him. Anxiously, Draco fingered the box in his pocket with a mix of relief and fear. His plans were a little ruined, but hopefully for the better. This also meant instead of praying to his partner’s dead parents he was going to have to not get ripped to pieces by two men who just found out they were fathers that had their little boy ripped away from them and obliviated.
Draco gave another barking laugh. “Your presence this year is going to be scandal enough. I’m almost disappointed I won’t get a front row seat to the show you’re going to make when they call your name. I want to see that stupid headmaster’s face when you’re sorted.”
Laney was uncharacteristically quiet; she knew it was worrying everyone. But she couldn’t bring herself to do anything other than stare blankly at the squirming toddler in front of her or the strands of red hair that were slipping into her line of sight. Annabee was being nearly impossible to settle. Incoherent and inconsolable as her little limbs failed and sobbed in absolute hysterics. Hadn’t stopped crying since she’d fallen and Hadrian had disappeared before her eyes.
The sun was gloriously warm against his face, and his torso was also comfortable warm as Annabee slept sounding against his chest under the large tree. The sky was clear and a bright blue, not a cloud in sight in the garden of the Malfoy Manor.
His leg had healed amazingly after his ordeal and the ministry. The best part was Lucius insistence to replace his wand with a custom wand. He mourned his holly and phoenix feather wand near daily, however the Malfoy Senior had gotten his hand on a search warrant for the Potter Manor and found the feather his core was made out of in Potter’s office, in a warded desk drawer. In France, his new wand was born, a birch wand with his phoenix feather core responded more beautifully than his premade holly wand ever had.
Gathering himself up, Hadrian glided up to the stool and sat down as gracefully as he could. Long limbs gave him a lot to practice with that when he’d hit that large growth spurt when he was ten. The hat soon covered his line of sight with the crowd and his mind eased a little bit.
“With all the respect in the world, why are we here? You say the Potters regret their actions, but it was to protect Hadrian. But what child below Hogwarts age needs magic for protection? Alexander was at much at risk in their care, yet he was the one they kept. There is also the fact that we are trying to tear a child away from two mothers who have raised him and housed him with no aid from his parents who even after the adoption sent no letters, no yule gifts, no visits. Here we are trying to tear a son from the family that raised him legally and uncontested for four years and who is vocal in wanting to stay with his mothers. One who has even protested visitation with the family who abandoned him to muggle relatives without a glance back. Parents who are trying to use the effect their neglect had on him as a weapon in this trial against the parents who have done nothing by heal and treat Mr. Dragma as their own. Do you really want to destroy a family and return a child to a place they are afraid of going back to?” Albus looked enraged, especially as the thinly veiled ideas of disregard and the blatant proof of neglect had many of the Lords glancing piteously at the two mothers who were holding their three children tightly. Lucius suppressed a smirk, he was certainly confident off the get go Hadrian thought.
Mooney was a quiet and kind man who was working with Severus to make sure Hadrian stayed up to speed with his schoolwork. The two men were ruthless of making sure Hadrian went above and beyond on his studies, until Padfoot interrupted to ‘save Hadrian’s brain from the book worms’. Watching the three bicker brought Hadrian a special joy and he rejoiced when Mama and Narcissa locked them in a closet together and they came out blushing and holding hands. All three of them.
“I wasn’t going to, I was going to make myself, what did you call it? Melt your dick off chicken, but I went for a safer option again. Tatertot hot dish is more of an American dish… but most people like it just fine.” Severus leaned forward a little bit.
Hadrian and Laney both frowned, Hadrian stayed quiet though as Laney was more vocal about her displeasure. “He’s my brother, a Dragma, he’s only Potter because it’s illegal for me to beat some sense into the Ministry of Magic. By the way, is that one person or many I’ll have to beat up if it continues on like that.”
“The hot dish!” Hadrian immediately was out of his seat, uncaring of the human-sized snake curling across his waist and shoulders like a sash. Draco sighed dreamily as the adults eyed the boy warily in the kitchen.
“Tell me Lord Potter. Isn’t it true, that Sirius Black, the boy’s godfather through you before his adoption, petitioned to raise the child and you denied the rights he had as the child’s godfather in even telling him Hadrian’s whereabouts? Wasn’t that the reason the Potter Black alliance was broken and Lord Black left to France, heartbroken with his husband in tow?” He had another godfather? One who
Lily would come back to an untouched plate sitting outside the door. The only reason he didn’t throw it was because Tippy would have to clean in. James beat him for the offense anyway when Lily ran downstairs crying.
The next morning when Severus stumbled out of their bedroom, he was caught by Draco before he could even ask their host for the location of the nearest coffee shop. He glared at his godson grumpily who just rolled his eyes.
“It’s our home Draco, you don’t need permission to bring guests over. Though, I am making dinner, so a headcount might be nice? I hope we have enough chairs…” Draco didn’t even try to stop himself from smiling like a loon. Our home. If he weren’t afraid of getting murdered by the Order the pure domesticity he was feeling might tear him apart. His Uncle Severus looked at him curiously and sharply as he hung up the phone.
, so we joke that we’re pseudo-twins. Both of us just turned eleven last month.” Draco nodded thoughtfully.
“You may be my godson, but that is my little boy and I will poison you in your sleep if you hurt him. Are we understood.” Draco relaxed, smiling down at his fiancé.
.” They hesitated, especially Hadrian, but Draco the more tactful of the bunch grabbed both his friends and dragged them away. Visibly down the stairs as if to prove they weren’t eavesdropping.
“That’s an understatement. We started with wanting a heritage test for me to see my bloodline and we ended up uncovering that I’m both the Boy-Who-Lived, stupid name, was mind raped and manipulated by an old creep, and taken from two loving fathers who were alive and grieving unaware while I was being beaten and starved. It’s… been a day.” Hadrian hadn’t meant to sound so bitter, but the soft smile Draco gave him soothed any worry he had. Letting his lover give him a chaste and soft kiss. Rubbing his shoulders over the loose tank top that Hadrian slept in.
Hadrian’s adopted parents resembled the two Dragmas. It was made more difficult when physically Snape saw the uncanny resemblance James held toward both his sons, but expressively wise was nowhere near like Hadrian.
“No. He hasn’t spoken to me since we sent Harry to his relatives. He’s in France with Moony, I don’t even know their address to send him a letter. There’s also the chance he’d be pissed at me enough to grab Harry and run. As the legal and blood-adopted godfather we gave him, he would be harder to fight than the lesbians.”
Hadrian was going to reply when the door to their cabin was rudely forced open. A girl with frizzy brown hair barging in unapologetically. Hadrian gave a displeased pout as Laney smiled fondly and patted his arm. A tight smile on her lips as Draco sneered at the intruder.
She was next up, the court hearing apparently was scheduled before Yule, so she was on a timeline. If Laney was anything at all, she was good under pressure. Hadrian watched from the library as Alex bumped into her in the hall. Obviously, he couldn’t resist spitting vitrol blaming her for Hadrian’s desertion. He was waving her wand around.
Laney squeezed his hand. Draco took his other side, caging him in and Laney was more than happy to glare at the Potters and hide him from view. Hadrian squeezed her hand back just as the gavel banged and the case started. Albus stood up and motioned to the Potters who were making obviously glances to Hadrian.
And he was right. Alex glowered at him, but when he tried to get him into detention he got points removed for picking on his brother again. After all, it was well known that Alex tormented him and his sister. And it was ‘well known’ that Hadrian didn’t retaliate unless pushed and often did do in quiet harmless ways.
The blood would stain deep and wouldn’t smudge when he had to throw the rug over it again. If he were to keep this a complete secret and only work at night, he would need at least three nights with clear skies and moonlight to finish painting all the runes. Then one night to do the ritual and run.
“As I stated earlier, they only requested your brother’s attendance, however as you are family and I his head of house. I deemed it prudent to drag all of us up here. I fear the havoc you and Draco could wreak if Hadrian nor I were there to witness and fix it.” Snape sighed despondently to which Laney giggled brightly. Hadrian blinked as Snape caught his eyes, but quirked his lips up into the best half smile he could. As their professor gently grabbed both their shoulders Hadrian knew he understood.
. His brother was sitting there looking nervous but still animatedly speaking to anyone who would listen. Lily was beautiful as ever, dark and rich red hair flowing smoothly as she quietly chatted with the headmaster, one hand absently stroking her son’s hair.
“Am I not?” The silence was telling enough. Hadrian smiled apologetically. “He has a point though. I’m sorry. I think it’s a good ice breaker before anyone steps on it thinking it’s an issue. They died when I was a baby, lived with my muggle aunt and uncle until I was… nine? My mentor took me in when… circumstances made living with my relatives difficult. She gave me this house and let me work at her restaurant to maintain a life. I still work there and go to the homeland with her occasionally.”
Certainly one his easier custody interviews. Lucius hummed, shuffling his paperwork around again and sorting it neatly into relevant folders. Waiting patiently until the two mothers and Severus filed back in. Lucius straightened his back and greeted them with a nod.
Draco was more than pleased to escort his mate through the alley. His hand on Draco’s arm as they looked at all the sweet shops, the quidditch store, that stupid joke shop run by the Weasels that unfortunately Hadrian seemed to adore. Draco’s favorite was the apothecary, listening to his Uncle and his boyfriend bicker about the proper way to brew (potions for his uncle and elixirs for his boyfriend, the same thing really, but Hadrian insisted a few elixirs differed from potions) before they bound together to spout theories on how to improve each other’s concoctions. Their lord seemed pleased to visit the book store, where Narcissa, him, and Draco were arguing on the legality of Dark Arts textbooks versus Defense Against the Dark Arts.
“Of course Laney.” The girl grinned, slow and long. Lucius had the smallest twitch of memory about Cheshire Cats in that squib’s fairytale. Hadrian simply gave her the blankest expression, occlumency? No. Basically muggle raised and too young. Lucius would mention it to Severus later perhaps.
And James wand flew out of his hands into Sirius’ where he snapped it with barely a thought before forcing James to his knees at wand point. “Now, before I arrest you and Albus, I get to do this. WHY?! WHY DID YOU HURT MY GODSON?! HOW COULD YOU DARE LAY A HAND ON AND ABANDON YOUR OWN SON YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT!”
“Erin here is a little magic, she never tried to be an active part in the wizarding world however. She’s a high ranking officer in an international anti-bio-terrorism unit, but she was certain to bring both muggle and magic culture into the house when Harry joined our family. Also the books certainly helped us understand that our other two daughters were showing signs of accidental magic as well. I was wondering why the hell I kept losing the TV remote when it was time for bed.” Snape raised a brow. Erin answered.
“I think it’s stupid they don’t let you drop your last name if you don’t want it. Did you see the way Potter and the Weasels were looking at you like you were their next victim? It was like indoctrination, it was barbaric.” The girl, Laney Dragma from what he remembered scowled.
“Lo there I call to you, lo there I call to you, lo there you call to me. Lady Magic hear my plea! Cast me off from this tainted blood, for I feel no love in this home, no taste from its food, no warmth from its shelter and no kinship to its inhabitants. I am estranged within this blood and offer up my own to rid myself of that which binds me. Lady Magic I renounce the Potter Family for its negligence, for its abuse, and for the terror it inspires and the crimes against your gifts. With your blessing free me. So mote it be.” The circle glowed beneath him and he could feel hands. Curling around his core deep in his chest. The feeling was both heavenly and hellish, feeling eyes studying him like a bug under a microscope. It burned him from the inside out. Until it stopped and there was a tug and suddenly Hadrian felt a rush of relief.
“Diffindo.” The skin and muscle of his calf parted easily with the curse and James paid no mind as Hadrian screamed and writhed on the ground. James opened the trunk in the room and stuffed anything he could find that could serve to send a message or entertain the piece of shit, making double sure to swipe the phoenix feather from the floor. Slamming it shut once he’d finished.
The house was quite ever since their son went to school, she hummed and gently stirred the stew that would serve to be their dinner. She still hadn’t adjusted the recipe to feed less mouths, so there would be a lot of leftovers. Though, if the number of mouths to feed would soon go up again. She hoped.
Although he griped about wearing an uncomfortable glamour their lord was quickly swayed with the promise of a relaxing and
“Good morning love,” Hadrian smiled. Draco grumbled but smiled back. Glancing around the room at all the adults before his mate handed him a cup of coffee with his left hand. Right still clutching his half eaten pastry.
parents wouldn’t care as long as he tried his best and worked hard. It was a deep hidden fear he never realized still lingered in his chest until it released. Leaving only a gasp of fresh air in his lungs. It left him high and joyful as his smile spread into a grin.
James gave him a dark look, hauling up the trunk stuffed with all the parchment, quills and ink in the room. Leaving no books or utensils behind. “Perhaps if you have time to do nothing but reflect. You’ll realize how good you have it by even being welcomed back into this house.”
“I’m shaking.” The bland statement mixed with the pure look of boredom on Harry’s face made Draco internally lose his mind. All that came out of his mouth was a garbled and choked laugh. But immediately Laney’s head whipped around from her discussion about vassals and serving families.
Draco laughed, though he had no clue what his love was saying. His lord was immediately sitting up and leaning in excitedly.
Immediately those pink lips split into a grin and Hadrian was pressed into his side. Draco’s face burrowed into the crown of the smaller’s head. Squeezing him tight until he let go. An arm still wound around his beloved’s shoulders as Hadrian’s nimble fingers gently traced the small of his back, unseen to their guests. Draco could feel the blush on his cheeks as he introduced them.
Alex was sitting nearly six feet away from the other three and each time he tried to scoot closer Laney simply turned towards him spitting proverbial fire and glaring. Hadrian was laying on his back with the little one using his chest as a pillow and seemed more than happy to just lie there and let it happen. Severus had to bite his lip hard as Alex crept forward and Laney threw a pen at him while hissing viciously.
“No, conflict of interest. Albus is a well known family friend, especially when we let him become Alex’s godfather. Any court case with us bars him from voting or having anything to do with the jury or hearing.”
Hadrian held back a scoff. As if she didn’t always do that anyway, even before he escaped the hellscape that was this family. James rounded on him the second her footsteps disappeared, snatching the lists of Hadrian’s desk and hissing viciously. “What’s this?”
Mama and Mother were sitting on the edge of the outdoor pool. Nuzzling each other lovingly as their feet dipped underneath the water’s surface. Mama hadn’t let him out of her sight for weeks after his escape, watching like a hawk from his bed side. Reading while he slept and making sure he was comfortable as he weathered the healing of his injuries and bouncing back from tearing himself out of the Potter Family Magic. Coddling him perhaps a bit too much out of love. Mother was just as overprotective if not more so. Hadrian had woken up in the middle of the night more than once to Mother slumped over in front of the door. One foot on it so if it opened she’d wake up. Handgun held tightly in her grasp.
Or, rather, actually cared for him rather than some image procured of him. A fantasy son that would never exist except in the mind of Lily. Nor the monster that James seemed determined to make him out to be. As if he, a grown ass man, was ever in the right to kidnap, torture, and abuse a child that happened to be his biological son.
Hadrian’s went up the stairs with Draco hot on his heels, meeting the blonde’s parents and Uncles(?) had been nice. Even if it was a little tense and worried. He was glad that he finally got to meet them, seeing as Draco had already met his mentor a few times now. Hadrian grabbed his lover and shoved him into one of the guestrooms, Draco gaped at the fully clean and furnished room.
“Yes. God, Dray, yes. I’d always marry you.” Draco grinned, a hysterical laugh bubbling up as he grabbed Hadrian in his arms and spun him around until they were both dizzy. Hadrian looked up at him and let his morph bleed away, uncaring of the scars as he kissed his
“Be quick, Hadrian wait with your sister for your other sister. I’m in the room across if you need me. I’ll be right out once we drag your godfather out of his lab or his rooms. Then we’ll choose where we’re going hmm?” Mama gave him one last kiss and disappeared down the hall with Lucius.
Photographs of all their friends and the five years (summers and one holiday technically) they’d spent together. Hadrian’s paintings hung on the wall, with little knick-knacks they’d collects strewn on shelves. The blanket Draco had given Hadrian for Christmas when they were thirteen laid on the living room couch.
“That’s a bit like basketball on brooms, right? Not really, but sort of? Hadrian, I think has been interested in the dueling club, he doesn’t like heights. Laney however I think likes the idea of fly tackling someone in the middle of the air. She was quite good at football when she and Harry were on their pee-wee team. Oh, how cute they looked in cleats and Harry wore his hair in braids. I miss those days.” James smiled finally.
“I figured your guests might prefer it, seeing as the first time I made you tea from my home you sputtered like a nun at a strip club.” Draco was surprised to see him mother muffle a laugh at the raunchy joke, but the amusement was quick to fade. Uncle Severus was the first to speak.
Ah, Hadrian didn’t notice the mini circle that had formed around Alex and them. That was nerve wracking. Still, he pushed it away in his mind to focus as name after name was called until Crabbe was the first one up, heading to Slytherin and quickly followed by Laney who was happily Slytherin with Draco and Goyle. The red head threw her legs over the bench next to her with a cheeky grin. Ever confident he’d follow her.
Sirius had been important to the arrest and the trial, damning Albus with a closed confession of what went down that night and nailed the old man with compliancy to child neglect, abuse, and attempted murder. He would die in Azkaban and Severus had taken his place as Headmaster. McGonagall was seen as too entrenched in Albus’ ideas to be suitable. Lily Potter escaped charges, but with the fall of Albus, the ‘Boy Who Lived’ worship fell. Criticism and hate came from all sides to a mother who abandoned her child and ignored abuse. Alex was let off as he was only a child.
After a minute his Uncle covered his mouth. The dark eyes, usually so calm and even were red and misty as he kept glancing from the parchment up to the boy beside him. Hadrian cocked his head curiously onto his shoulder as even his own father looked at the finished stack of paper and went sheet white, looking at Hadrian with a new reverence reserved for very few people. Severus’ hand-dipped low enough that with a squint Draco could read the scrawl on the top.
“We’re going to get him back Anna. We won the court hearing, the ministry can’t ignore his kidnapping. Even if they did, Hadrian’s smart, he’ll figure a way out and then he’ll be sitting on the patio smirking at us with that quiet smugness asking why we’re freaking out so bad and don’t we trust him? Then, we’ll make a plan to
“I wouldn’t worry about me ma’am.” Severus could see the shorter man’s hand squeeze Draco’s thigh under the table and held back a spit take. Internally he was cackling, Hadrian was still smiling like a church boy as the hand squeezed again when Draco wheezed quietly. The young man would’ve made a good Slytherin, Severus mused.
Morosely, she set the table just as the floo sounded and she perked up with a quick, but weak, smile. Her husband came strolling into the dining room, still wearing his Auror robes and his brown hair windswept gorgeously. He gave her a heart stopping smile, looking behind his glasses with warm hazel eyes. At least some things would never change. A quick kiss and then they both sat down to their dinner before Lily pounced.
Tom gave a smile and leaned into Severus, Draco pressed a kiss onto Hadrian’s temple as the oven dinged.
If you have any opinions about how you want this posting schedule to go, lmk and I hope you enjoy this little angst fest!
It was like being in a house of over emotional toddlers. One didn’t understand basic human decency, one wanted everything to go her way, and one liked to hit. Hadrian was grateful Annabee’s tantrums were far and free between and that her biting phase was extremely short lived when he played the big brother card and told her how disappointed he was. Her little sobs had been heartbreaking when she’d realized how upset hitting made him, but she’d never bitten another kid at the farmer’s market again and Hadrian had showered her in kisses and cuddles after timeout.
Even his father looked up with surprise before a pleased smile stretched across his face. His Lord and his Uncle stayed quiet as Lucius leaned over to shake Hadrian’s hand. Who looked absolutely delighted at the gesture. Shaking the older’s hand happily.
Hadrian was Draco’s heaven outside of the wizarding world. Though, he was definitely a wizard (and god he hoped he was maybe a half-blood because then he would have half a chance at convincing his father that this was okay). He was still Draco’s.
“Let’s call this meeting adjourned for the time being as it seems the children have gone away. Would you all be amenable to meeting again soon? Alex is Harry’s brother and even if its just visits, don’t you want your son to know his birth family?” Erin frowned at him.
“No! He’s my brother and I’m not going to let some muggle born gypsy steal him away and corrupt him to the-“ Snap. The anger cracked and popped like a strike of lightening in his chest, his body moved faster than his mind. The three other purebloods startling as he beat them to the punch. Hauling his former brother by the collar and shoving him against the wall. Hissing venomously next to his ear.
“Imagine having such an ego that you take a losing case to court under the delusion you win and you muck it up so badly that you’ll be lucky to say a Most Noble House by the end of the PR nightmare that was just unearthed?” Laney gave him a confused look. “I’ll explain why later, it’ll help you understand why Sev is such a big deal to all of us here and why the Potters are going to lynched in the newspapers.”
“Once the order goes into effect, he won’t be able to get sixty feet of you and as for revenge, we can do interview with the paper and absolutely ruin his day that way.” All the papers were swiftly signed and immediately Mama was sweeping him into her arms and planting kisses and whatever skin she could reach. Mother watching fondly and squeezing his shoulder with a proud smirk. Lucius was packing away his brief case with an equally triumphant and proud look, “I say we celebrate with dinner before we go back home. What do you kids think?”
“I don’t know Lily. And I’m not going to chance it until Harry is in our family firmly and we’ve won both the court case and gotten the boys to settle their differences. I won’t risk Harry manipulating Sirius into thinking he needs to get away from us or using Sirius against us. His word in court could be the difference between a loss and winning and Harry is being extremely bitter towards us right now, who knows what he’d tell Sirius to get him to let him stay with those women.”
“There will be time for pleasantries later, so let us get down to business. Is there anything the Potters might use against you?” Erin curled a hand behind her ear, clearing her face of any stray strands, Sara was relaxed underneath her wife’s arm.
“A what?” Hadrian rolled his eyes, getting up and flanking Draco as Laney tried to describe their mother’s job with the international bioterrorism group as a high ranking soldier in wizarding terms that Draco could possibly understand. However, that conversation was interrupted as they were stopped by two lions standing in front of the Potions Labs.
“Yeah! Dad told me you were coming home for Christmas. You won’t have to go back to those women’s house, you’ll get to come home again! Dad was saying that your adoption wasn’t real so we got custody of you again!”
“Harry was attached! I didn’t want Suni to get sick from wild rodents, he would have been heart-broken! Then you know Laney would have been upset and Annabee would have a downright melt down that her brother was sad.”
“Don’t be sorry, I was being careless. That was my fault, but I’ve seen enough for right now.” With a blink, he was back in reality. Hadrian didn’t even bat an eye, taking a sip of coffee as if he weren’t mentally violated just seconds ago.
Shoving the pieces of his wand into his pocket, he darted out the door. The halls were dreary and oppressive, but the magic still enveloping him was intoxicating and left him feeling high. As if nothing could touch him. Whipping around a corner, he slammed into a small body. Sending them both careening to the floor. Alexander lay under him, shocked.
They won the courts, they won’t get away with this. He just had to be patient. Patient. Patient. Patient.
“He can’t be gone, he can’t be gone he was just there! I was only gone for a couple minutes. I was only gone for a minute.” Mama was freaking out, speaking frantically to herself and clutching Hadrian scarf that had fallen off when Anna had tried to use it to grapple onto their brother. Narcissa was beside her, holding their grieving mother upright.
With that, James grabbed the dishes and disappeared into the kitchen whistling a soft tune as he left.
“Mama!” The red-haired girl whined; Hadrian only gave a firm nod. His arm slung around his sister’s waist. “I swear, terrorize one elementary school and you’re called a trouble maker! Please! They were all amused and you know it!”
“Hadrian! Oh my baby, my baby, my baby.” The raven sighed, hands digging into his Mama’s back. It wasn’t a dream this time. He was here, he made it. Nuzzling into her shoulder, he let out a hysterical sobbing laugh. He used his arms to haul himself when his legs proved useless, trying to get closer to where he felt safe. Squirm closer into his Mama’s safe arms.
Though, with how the day was going. She had little hope for him, she’d thought by the end of the day she’d get her boys to work out their problems and things could go back to how they were once. Peaceful, with Harry and Alex living and balancing each other out. James could have two sons to spoil rotten, losing Harry had been a hard hit. James hadn’t meant to be so hard on the boy Lily was sure. But he had gotten into the bad habit of resenting his brother like Albus had warned them about. That he might be a squib only seemed to heighten the animosity.
It felt like an eternity, but it was really only a few minutes when Draco saw his love turn from the stove. Six mismatched mugs balanced on a tray with a small jug of milk and mason jar of sugar. Draco didn’t even blink when Hadrian plopped his favorite mug onto his placemat, tea already a dark milky color, evidently, Hadrian had made his tea for him. He took a sip and was a little surprised.
Severus gently brushed his fingers through her hair. More shouting was beginning to echo down from the room. Along with a cold rumble that sent shivers down his spine. “No one will take your son. Sounds like your wife is going to freeze everyone with sheer will power.”
James was in a room, barren of many books and filled with Quidditch memorabilia bent over in conversation with an old man with white hair. Albus. Sirius pressed himself further into the wall and held his breath. James shoulder’s shook, revealing his agitation in his nightrobes.
“Good, how’s school going?” The raven was still blinking back into focus, but he gave a thumbs up. Laney snorting beside him.
“Don’t worry about it Hadrian, not like these guys are big talkers either and at least you got the intelligence and competence to pull it off. I’m more surprised no one’s ears are bleeding from that harpy. She could have at least knocked. It’s only polite.” Draco checked the scenery and looked into the hallway.
“Come on. Let’s move quickly, the address is 320 St. Dineral Ave.” Immediately, Draco stepped back and let his mother hold his shoulder and apparate them to the spot just outside the property. The street was dark in the night, but the soft glow of fireflies and the occasional street light made Draco smile again as he hopped up the porch with no hesitation. Keys clinking as he hurriedly opened the door and let his family and the dark lord inside.
“Amenable. It seems I don’t have to add you to the list. That little prat is still on there though.”
“We need to get a picture for the moms. Mama would lose her god damn mind. This is just her aesthetic.”
“Shouldn’t we be getting to bed?” Draco nodded and slipped off the bed, all of them getting changed and wandering off to their beds. Hadrian didn’t even bat an eye when Suni snuck up onto the bed for a cuddle, nor when Laney attached herself to his back, a fuzzy bundle squished between her chest and his back. The raven just closed his eyes and accepted it was going to be a family cuddle. Not the worst thing in the world.
“Don’t worry about that Lily-flower. Just spruce up Harry’s new room. We’ll be teaching him what it means to be a Potter whether he likes it or not. All children have a rebellious phase after all. Harry can’t be led astray by the dark. Alex needs to defeat the Voldemort and having Harry on our side is paramount according to Albus. Alex adores Harry already, so it will be wrestling Harry into not being so difficult and teaching him to that family comes first.”
Draco gave a large grin. “That’s my godfather Severus Snape. He’s the head of our house actually so you’ll get to meet him in just a minute when he joins us in the Slytherin common room. He can be a bit grumpy, but he’s cool once you get to know him. I think you’ll like him.”
, when Alex couldn’t even get a bloody wave. Cooing with a disgustingly sweet and devoted tone that didn’t match the apathetic boy he’d seen Harry twisted into.
Remus had stayed behind the second they’d gotten the letter. Packing up their house, preparing to move back to Britain if only to be close to him again. Sirius was ready to work his ass off to find his godson and then spend the rest of his life on his knees begging him and his new family for forgiveness and for a second chance. Severus, Lucius, and Mrs. Dragma had been prepping him on barging into Potter man and searching the place when there was a crack and Mrs. Anderson had run out the door.
, said he would work on brewing a memory potion immediately. Though it wasn’t likely to work on Hadrian, it was fine. He didn’t want to remember school if he was the Potter that Draco had whined about and cursed constantly. His fathers were desperate to remember though.
“She likes skin contact. It was an experience to wake up the first time with a boa slithering up my pants and into my shirt whining that she was cold.”
All the students stepped into the beautiful hall and as a ratty hat started to sing, Hadrian glanced at his companions. Laney had a dreamy smile full of wonder and excitement as she held his hand. Draco caught his eye and gave a confident smirk with Crabbe and Goyle gave him firm nods. It bolstered Hadrian immediately as he looked up at the head table with determination.
“She is an attention whore. She adores wrapping around Anna because she knows that Hadrian will absolutely spoil them together. A snuggle slut as I like to call it.”
“Piers and Esmerelda it is when you two are together and not in the common room. I will not be made a fool calling a shared name. It would do well to answer to those names if it is amenable to you?” Hadrian glanced to his ‘sister’ and she seemed to look him up and down. Sizing him up, it was oddly amusing to see a child act so tough.
“Those two don’t, I have a black owl named Akumu. He was my mother’s but she got him when I was a baby and he imprinted of me, so she gifted him to me when I was ten so I could send my own letters. I wanna meet Hadrian’s snake though, what breed is it?” The long hair brunet answered for his sister.
Severus still dug around, finding nothing incriminating anywhere in the office. Or any papers unrelated to school and students except a single letter from the French Aurors that made him pause. There was only one man in France aside from the congress that Albus would attempt to speak with after the trial. Digging his hands into the envelope he wrenched the letter apart desperately.
“Oh do tell?” The Potters looked confused, only Lily and Albus were perceptive enough to look wary with their Slytherin banter.
“Merlin willing I have been waiting for this.” With that Hadrian brought his fist down and broke Alex’s nose in one swoop. Stopping his screaming abruptly as Hadrian hauled him up by his collar and hissed directly into his face. “Maybe this will give you some food for thought when you think its okay to watch your father kidnap and beat a child he lost custody of for a
“The way my aunt and uncle sometimes spoke I think they were. I don’t know for sure though. My mentor let me have her last name when I moved here, it helped keep social services off our back. But, it also means I don’t even know where I’d start looking.”
“You’re the other Potter twin! I thought you went missing? People said you were…” Hadrian gave a bitter smile.
Eleven and performing a ritual, especially this ritual. Hadrian wondered if he was breaking some sort of record as he bled and darkened a couple of the symbols. It would be difficult to scrub off the blood if it didn’t work and he’d be set back another week at least if he needed to sneak into the library and see what he’d gotten wrong.
The dark-haired man gasped and stepped back, Hadrian looked at him, slightly haunted and pale. But the boy still looked into his eyes and stepped closer to him.
Tears were clearly visible as one of the twin’s mothers paced agitatedly, hands shaking and still muttering under her breath. Distressing the children further as he pushed them further behind himself. Hidden behind his robes.
Hadrian held back a whimper of pain at his leg, flicking his head up and using a hand to clean the tangled mess out of his eyes. To find himself looking up at the grand entrance of Malfoy Manor.
“That would make a scene! I almost want to see that. But I rather like you two, so I think sticking with me would be in both of our best interests. I’ll teach you how to mix with the right sort. Are you… muggle-raised?” Draco said it with a slight grimace, but Hadrian appreciated the effort. A lot of pureblood families like the Malfoy’s had strict beliefs that would take time to break down. Laney spoke first.
A sigh echoed through the halls, “Maybe you’ll feel better for dinner.” And her footsteps echoed down the hall.
“Grand castle, soft and warm yellow lights and a night sky with a lake? This is basically Mama’s photography wet dream.” All five of the eleven-year-olds stumbled out of the boat. Crabbe and Goyle talking between the two of themselves as they helped out the three distracted students out of the boats, gaining grateful smiles in return.
“Suni wouldn’t let him get dressed. It’s a Saturday anyway so, it’d probably be more exhausting to try and fight her on it.” Severus reached into his desk drawer and threw it at the half naked eleven-year-old. The raven shrugged it on without a single complaint, not even flinching as Severus shrunk it to fit him snuggly with a flick of his wand. Laney sniggered behind her brother’s shoulder, only smirking when Severus gave her a withering glare. Sara was all over them quickly enough, checking on them and kissing their cheeks. Lucius watched a little surprised as neither preteen tried to squirm away from her affections as many older children did, only basking in it. It was refreshing after three years of Draco’s ‘I’m a big boy’ attitude at being ‘coddled’.
outing with his closest confidants and his husband had the man trudging out. Cracking his first smile when Hadrian decided to mimic his glamour with rich blond hair and bright brown eyes and mockingly sulk around the man. Draco and his mother was nearly in stitches, almost falling over when they apparated into Diagon Alley.
With how their evening went, it was a surprise when an irate Potions Master stopped them before breakfast the next day. A sneer firmly in place on his lips as he handed them a note with a candy name on it. Laney looked at it confusedly while Hadrian raised an eyebrow at him.
“You’re gifted in making explosions.” The near maniacal grin that split the girls face made it difficult to keep a blank and straight composure. Hadrian seemed to have drifted back to reality as well, giving a barely there smirk.
The dark haired boy didn’t even meet his gaze however, too busy staring at other people as the hat above him yelled Gryffindor and he was off to join Ron and wait eagerly for his brother as McGonagall continued to listen before yelling out with a small tone of confusion.
Quickly he fixed a coffee for him and his beloved (his fiancé his mind grinned) before settling down at the table and grabbing a French curler as Draco stumbled down the stairs, Nagini nipped at his heels.
“Now you know how I feel when you whisper in French to me bastard.” Draco laughed before giving a soft sigh.
“Maybe he won’t notice if we bolt to our next class, he can’t try to corner us if he can’t catch us.”
“Worry not child, I won’t allow the Potters to interfere with your life. That’s why I’m here as your mothers’ legal counsel and I assure you in any legal battle I will win quite firmly. Draco would be rather cross with me if I didn’t. So, try not to worry. Be a child and have fun, study hard. I’ll finish up with your parents.” The red head girl grinned happily and bounced up and away, dragging the raven haired boy with her. Long ponytail flicking behind him like a cat tail.
He looked both different and exactly as Alex had pictured. His eyes were Mom’s shade of green, but everything else was all Dad. With fair, but not pale skin and lean, sharp limbs. A seeker’s build, or chaser. Alex didn’t expect the lack of glasses however, in every picture Harry had been a quiet frown with wide green eyes, hidden by glasses and unruly black hair. Harry now however had no glasses, his eyes were big and long, framed neatly with bangs and hair pressed into a long ponytail that made him look kinda girly. Alex would have to convince him to maybe trim the hair, or at least wear it differently.
And he was left in the ashes. A grown man going to face another grown man, one who’d changed for the worst. One had thrown one of his children away and allowed him to suffer and be hurt in ways no child should. The other had begged for that child, unable to have his own, and now could only avenge the child and all the time that was lost from him.
The dark-haired man gave a swift nod. He knew what it was like to worry, even if it might be nothing. Following gut feelings were very important and it wasn’t like it was difficult to check as long as the boy consented. “Have you talked to him about this?”
Dumbledore, motioned to two chairs in front of him. “Sit, Mrs. Dragma and Mrs. Anderson will be here as soon as Minerva has gotten them both. Lemon drop anyone?” Alex grabbed one happily, but hesitated as the two students opposite of him said nothing. Unanimously staying silent and united. Alex swallowed the bitter feeling in the back of his throat.
“He skipped dinner, he won’t be skipping breakfast.” Well, actually Tippy had served him dinner. He’d simply avoided dining with his kidnappers. “I’m going in.”
“Annabee is just plain smitten with her brother, he could say the sky was green and she’d adamantly defend him against anyone who tried to say it was blue.”
“The Greater Good, you mean what suits you and your agenda rather than the law or the good of my traumatized godson. You will lose Albus, that court loss and this media circus is only for your loss. I hope losing everything reminds you what you’ve taken from me and the mothers you are so callously ignoring.” Severus finally relented, allowing Albus to scuttle towards the Great Hall. His glare following him the entire way until his frown melted into a smirk. Minerva should keep him busy enough. “Cockroach Clusters.”
Draco’s shock spread into a deep grin. “There’s some Slytherin ambition, you had me worried for a second Dragma. I knew that goody-goody light family had to have some closed doors nonsense.”
“You have my eyes. Just like I thought.” A warm smile broke out onto his face. “Looks like you have Severus dark hair though, and his cheeks.”
He could see why they wanted to remember, however. All the little moments had been taken from them. His birth, maybe even his first word, the memory of whoever attacked them and took their little boy away. Made them unable to get him back until all these years had passed.
“Good morning! Severus, right? Coffee?” He nodded, and soon a cup was pressed gently into his hands. He gave a grateful nod as the young man sauntered over to the table and plopped down, leaning back and looking through the window with an effortless grace and power. He could see why even before Draco’s creature inheritance kicked in that he was so taken with the boy. Strong, while still being lithe and elegant.
There was a time crunch, but there was also no reason to rush like a Gryffindor. He’d sleep on it, look at the lists in the morning to see if he’d miss anything and a make a decision. The back up plan as always was to throw himself out the window and crawl to freedom in the dead of night. Hadrian sighed softly and got up, yanking off the duvet and pulling it under the bed with him as he crawled into the safe space.
Weeks passed with school work, the world's most interesting Halloween feast, and cramming as many politics lessons into his head as possible. Hadrian was exhausted and more than content to simply exist. It was another one of those meetings the Headmaster had to arrange with his mothers and the Potters, where more arguing and useless bantering happened. Severus was escorting the children, Draco tagging along like a lost puppy with Hadrian (the crush his godson had was disgustingly cute). Severus was quick to grab the children and place himself in front of them as Sara slammed open the portrait door gasping for breath.
Draco was sitting across from her, being the one to hold her baby sister. He was like her, quietly distraught as he tried his best to soothe the five year old. Dodging floundering limbs with impressive grace and pressing Annabee’s face to snuffle into his robes pathetically. Vince and Greg were on either side of her, caging her in and keeping her propped up when she felt like a marionette with no strings. Suni laid on her lap limply, sulking with her eyes closed in despair at the loss of her speaker. Laney didn’t know what she was thinking, and she couldn’t ask how to make her feel better.
“I wouldn’t blame you. It happens you know.” Hadrian could see the understanding and between the lines words in Draco’s eyes. The blonde mulled over the words, before he stepped closer to Hadrian.
“Your Metamorphagus traits will have stopped most physical changes, but you might notice a slight difference in your bone structure, eye color, and or skin tone. Maybe even hair color. This is to both clear any lasting compulsions, and possibly some of the memory charms and potions, and void out the blood adoption so that we can keep custody of you, should Wizarding Britain not recognize your foreign magical guardian. The last thing either of us want is you caught back into this war too. You had no place in it, you have no obligation to try and clean up the mess that Dumbledore caused.” Hadrian looked up at them, his parents.
“Would you say you make a proficient amount of money for raising three children?” Sara nodded resolutely.
First, he gently sawed off a chunk from the ends of his hair and fashioned it into a decent brush head. Using his ponytail, his hair hung limply down and around his head as he hyper focused on wrapping it around his broken wand and the tip of his new brush. Useless for magic, but perfect for painting precious lines.
