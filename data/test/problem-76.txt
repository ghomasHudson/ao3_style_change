A comfortable silence dawned upon the small committee which had been formed to select Harry’s Second Consort. Harry initially thought there was no need for a committee with such a ridiculous purpose, but the moment Hermione asked him who he would propose to, Harry came up with a blank. The committee had proved very useful indeed.
“Greetings, Your Majesty and Your Highness… No, I’m sorry. Greetings, Lord Malfoy,” Blaise Zabini gave a short bow, his voice cokesure, Cupid bow’s lips curled in a confident smirk.
The room fell into silence.
“We need to make this mansion fit for a visit from the King and his fiance, after all.”
The other three agreed.
It was not proper; at this point, Draco was just a fiance of the King. He had not been appointed as a Prince Consort. But Slughorn had suggested, and Shacklebolt agreed, that the gesture of commitment would be much appreciated. Nobody could afford the 9-month wait.
“I wasn’t lying, Gin. I don’t want to if we can avoid it.” Harry turned his pleading gaze to his wife. It was far too public to be having this argument in front of their courtiers, regardless of the fact that only members of the Order of the Phoenix were in the room.
“This Noctilucous jade has such a beautiful shade of translucent blue…”
Malfoy stopped and stared at the King for a couple of seconds, before he retrieved his hand. “Thank you, Your Majesty,” he said gracefully, as always.
Theodore Nott looked taken aback. Fear for his life was apparent on his face for a moment, before he bowed again so low his forehead nearly touched the floor. “Your Majesty, Lord Malfoy, I swear that I am committed to you! In fact, I have a present that proves my devotion!”
“Yura,” The ex-Transfiguration Profession sighed. Some of the weariness left her expression. “I can’t possibly express how much I thank you for the assistance.”
Young Nott looked relieved to be having Malfoy’s attention. “Of course, the suburbs of the city with the best climate in Petra… Mesaro.”
Count Slughorn, whose assistance had been requested in the endeavor, endorsed Shacklebolt’s choice readily.
The younger man did so… and cocked his head. A cold smirk crossed his face. “As expected.”
“I’ve prepared the necessary gifts,” Viscount Nott snapped to attention. A House Elf popped into existence next to him, carrying an open chest with glass bottles of clear liquids and a well-shaped turquoise vase inside it. “I have procured the Silk Flower Three Poignant Perfumes from Scent of Spring shop in Han, as well as the most beautiful Glaze Lily imprinted porcelain I’ve seen.” He handed the chest over to Malfoy for his inspection.
Hermione grimaced as she made a suggestion. “Millicent Bulstrode.” She didn’t know many conservative purebloods their age.
Harry imagined the memories weren’t all that pleasant for the elderly witch… they were memories she’d rather buried, and he wasn’t going to force her to dig them back out…
Harry and Malfoy stared at each other fixedly, neither side budging, before Harry decided to be the one taking a step back. There was still a few weeks’ margin to Ginny’s due date. “I’ll trust you this time, Draco.”
Harry took a deep breath.
Arthur, Bill, Percy and George turned to look at the King at the same time, blue and hazel eyes keenly observing. Judging.
Hermione had perked up. “Oh, is he a scholar from Han?”
Harry gave Hermione, who was all packed and ready to go, a grateful smile. “How do I live without you, Hermione?”
Harry exited the room wordlessly.
For a moment, Harry was thrown back to the memory of Myrtle’s bathroom in sixth year, where Malfoy was also crying. Only this time, he wasn’t crying alone. He had Li.
Petra’s smartest witch of their generation sighed. “I couldn’t find out much about him other than that he married Guizhong Li, the older sister of the previous Marchioness, Ningguang Li, around fifty years ago. Before that, he was said to have worked at the prestigious Wangsheng Funeral Parlour. Lady Ningguang is the mother of the current Matriarch Yelan. Guizhong died fifteen years ago. The couple was childless. Zhongli stayed with House Li for about a few more years before he just…disappeared.”
Neville hesitated, before he ploughed through, “It is slightly concerning that some of the Sacred Twenty-Eight Houses which were not deeply involved with the former King… chose not to return to the court. Like Houses Slughorn, Greengrass or Nott… They are just Counts, well liked by the residents of their fiefs...”
Petra needed balance.
Harry turned to look at his godson wistfully one last time. “Bye, Teddy. Bye, Andromeda.”
Harry raised his eyebrow. “... I have fully pardoned you for the…” He hesitated to release the word into the air again. The knowledge of horcruxes was better off fully exterminated from the world.
‘Mind what?’ Harry wanted to ask, but Malfoy didn’t wait for an answer in the first place. Harry felt the blonde’s deft fingers pinning something onto his collar, near his breast pocket.
Zhongli also turned to the windows. “...Indeed,” he looked at his guests apologetically. “I’m sorry, I have to handle the chore personally. The flowers are very sensitive and temperamental…”
The words died in his mouth when Malfoy put his hand on the lapels of his black robes, his brows creasing. “Your Majesty, would you mind?”
Malfoy himself had opined that the Aurors’ decision was unwise, but did nothing else when Harry didn’t budge. He came to morning assemblies as usual, accompanied Harry to functions with overseas dignitaries as usual and cooperated with Harry in managing various internal affairs and the Castle’s household matters as usual.
Harry sighed inwardly. “Gin,” he reached out for her hand. “I’ve promised you that I won’t give my heart to anyone else, haven’t I?” His voice was placating.
“That’s after curfew,” Hermione frowned as the Headmistress stepped down from the podium. Her face changed soon after, though. “Must be because of the time difference.”
God, he was just so tired.
Well, he can’t have the cake and eat it too, can he?
Regardless, the outcome favoured Harry. “I echo Draco’s sentiment, Lord Zabini. We’re happy to have you here,” he raised his glass for an informal toast.
The blonde caught it, but he did not appear perturbed. He merely turned to Daphne Greengrass to respond to what she said, as though what had transpired between him and Ginny didn’t occur.
Petra’s King raised his head. He surveyed the room with the same tired, lifeless eyes, before he reached out and took his wife’s hand.
In the end, he settled with, ‘
“There is no getting out of this, it seems,” Hermione heaved a loud sigh. “Pansy Parkinson.”
Harry straightened up immediately. Count Shacklebolt was the elected ‘Hand of the King’, the leader of a small council whose job was to oversee the House of Lords. Harry respected the wizard immensely. “Speak,” he commanded.
Malfoy was quiet for a moment. “You know, when I saw Lord Zhongli over a decade ago, he looked the same. Didn’t seem to have aged one day. I’ve never felt any disillusionment charms from him, either. One does wonder…”
“Harry?” Hermione touched his arm, snapping Harry off from the memory of his Godfather falling through the curtain, never to come back, repeating like in a loop. He looked around, and realised that he was nearly alone. His other schoolmates had passed through. Luna was waiting ahead of them, and Malfoy was standing by the door, one hand on the frame. Harry noted an odd set of tension in his back, before he too, disappeared in the mist.
The committee fell into silence again.
A House Elf appeared in the drawing room, wrinkled and stooping. Harry suspected she wasn’t that much younger than Kreacher. “Master call Lizzy?”
A series of “Yes, Headmistress,” or “Yes, Professor,” were murmured by the teens.
Tartaglia’s smile as he leaned on the windowsill still looked like it could devour Malfoy whole. “I look forward to your invitation.”
“You made the right decision,” McGonagall reassured him. “Petra has always been a divided Kingdom. Now, and a hundred years ago. There was a reason Tom Riddle was able to worm into the hearts of those purebloods… he exploited their fears. Power will continuously swing between the two factions until something is done to bridge the differences.”
Malfoy’s face brightened. “I won’t let you down, Your Majesty,” his pitiful mien transformed to that of determination. “Get me Ulysses!” He turned to the guards and ordered them to bring the blonde’s eagle owl to him. The blonde stood up and made to leave, presumably to prepare for the trip, but before he reached the door, he surprised Harry again by bowing his head to Luna and Hermione. “Lady Lovegood and Lady Granger, may I please request you to join this short trip as well? I think Gre… Lord Zhongli is a knowledgeable man whose presence you will enjoy.”
The wizard
Harry narrowed his eyes irately. “I said not to disturb me this afternoon.”
“...Stop it,” Malfoy’s voice finally entered the fray. He sounded tired.
“Mrs Zabini is possibly the richest woman on earth. Forgive me for saying this, Your Majesty… but there is no compelling reason for Blaise Zabini to accept your proposal…” Slughorn looked apologetic as he offered his opinion.
(See the end of the chapter for
“...I see,” judging from the dumbfounded expression on his wife’s face, this must not have been common knowledge.
Harry frowned. There were so many things he wanted to ask. “Lady Ningguang inherited the title even though she had older siblings? Was Lady Guizhong… ill?”
The young King looked up to see the wise old face of Headmistress McGonagall, his former Head of House in Hogwarts. Some of the older members of the Order also stood around him with concerned expressions on their faces. Harry caught sight of Fleur and Charlie, still seated at the table, and a little relief filled him.
Harry tapped his fingers against the white tablecloth. “Is that all?”
“I am very thankful for the high-quality gifts you prepared, of course… and your presence in the court,” sounds of furniture scraping against the floor and fabric swishing could be heard, followed by high-pitched clinking of metal and porcelain. The familiar aroma of earl grey wafted out of the room.
Luna looked pleasantly surprised to be invited. “Sure, Draco,” she replied casually. Luna claimed that Malfoy had been kind to her during her captivity in Malfoy Manor and she had treated him like a friend since he joined Harry’s court. It was Malfoy who maintained a distance with her, seemingly afraid of the dreamy former Ravenclaw student. Harry didn’t care as long as Malfoy treated Luna with respect.
The redhead was knitting a tiny red romper with yellow hems. She looked up when he opened the door. “Hey,” she smiled softly.
Malfoy flinched at Harry’s casual use of the former tyrant’s name, but he obliged. “Yes. Quite a few Death Eaters never came back from that meeting as well.”
“Nobody will give you the truth outright,” Malfoy remarked idly as he casted a cooling charm to his handkerchief and placed the folded piece of fabric on his eyes. “But from his aura and magical power, you could probably tell, right? Besides… King Riddle did visit them, you know.”
He almost said, ‘for me. For my dream of uniting Petra.’
“Good morning to you too, Harry,” the brunette said idly. She’d always been saying that Harry had gotten more and more rude the longer he’d been King. “Did you have a good sleep?”
“Long time no see, Great-Uncle-in-law,” Malfoy replied reverently, his head remaining bowed as the Han Chinese approached. “I am glad that you seem well.”
So Harry kept quiet.
It was a beautiful piece of jewelry. The oval peridot that made its centrepiece was as big as a grape, vibrant and brilliant in its lustre, the warm olive green colour blending well with the rectangular diamond petals that surrounded the peridot in a ring, as well as the gold-plated ivies design of the velvet choker. The symbol of ‘李’ could be seen faintly through the clear jewel.
As Harry was leaving the Banquet Hall, he could hear some whispers from the floor.
, and were going to put their plans in motion after they were prepared, regardless, but finding someone with legitimacy to the throne didn’t hurt at all. A throne won through the right of succession always stabilised faster than that won through the right of conquest.
Lady McGonagall cleared her throat loudly, and it seemed to snap Ginny back into motion. “I apologise for my ignorance… I didn’t mean to be rude…” she gave a small bow with her head.
The golden light of the sunset streamed into the room, illuminating them. The smile on Zhongli’s face looked so precious it could stop someone’s heart. “It’s been a while since I enjoyed myself like this.”
“It’s House Black’s tradition to name their children after star constellations, right?” Zhongli remarked serenely. “May she fly as freely as celestial birds, and shine as brightly as Ursa Major.”
“Congratulations, Your Majesty,” his paranoia was interrupted by a beaming felicitation from the Healer. “Her Majesty is pregnant!”
“Oh?” He straightened up, putting a tiny bit more of distance away from Harry’s fiance. “Let’s have it, then,” he gestured.
Malfoy peered up at the tall, tall man. “I’m sure you know about the current situation at Petra.”
What followed was a bloody war that culminated in the dictator’s death in a duel against Harry.
“Your Majesty, stop,” Malfoy’s voice was shaky, and his face was pale, but he never averted his eyes from the red-haired monster in front of him. “You’re right, Lord Tartaglia. There is something we would like to ask of you.”
1) Something like this? https://www.shinyjunglejewellery.com/listing/620184760/watermelon-tourmaline-ring-bi-color
“It’s fine,” Harry took a seat, and his guests followed suit. “How are Lucius and Narcissa? Are they living well in Han?”
Harry could pinpoint the moment those questions scattered to nothing in his best friend’s mouth.
Harry frowned. Too formal.
For the first time in his life, Harry learned that not only had he the rights to succeed the throne of the Kingdom of Petra… he also learned that magic existed, and that he was a wizard.
“Oh Merlin, I can’t even think about that” Draco shivered.
Harry has a bit of a breakdown and then he's forced to face the one place that still haunts him.
Here comes the family fluffiness.
“I’m exhausted,” Harry said with a yawn.
“Goodnight boys, we love you!” Harry and Draco said as they walked into the hall.
“Not yet, They said that they were able to determine that it was a horcrux made around the same time as Voldemort’s second rise to power, but they are waiting on the go ahead to try and release the part of the soul that is contained inside. Their lead magical forensic scientist is on assignment and they want to wait until she is back before they let it out. They said it should be done in a day or two. They are also still running traces on the other items we gathered at the shop but so far no magical signatures have been matched to the items. They are sending a team of magical forensic scientists over to the shop to check for other items that may be magical or may point us to the identity of the person who either created the horcrux or donated the items. We have also gotten the purchase logs from Pansy and we can start going through those to see if we can find who sold Spencer the snuff box. As Pansy wasn’t sure if it was purchased at the auction last week with the rest of the items we collected, we will have to go back a few months if not a year to see if we can find it. Luckily it’s not a shop with a huge amount of turnover and he kept meticulous records, so it shouldn’t take too long. Here, I will give you this list and I will start with this one” Charlotte instructed. Harry took the sheets of paper and headed back to his office. He began searching through the items and while this kind of work was tedious, Harry didn’t mind it so much as it was like finding pieces that fit together to solve a larger unknown puzzle. He kept working until he heard a knock at his door. He looked up as a head peeked through the open doorway.
Malfoy approached his face dangerously to the point in which he could feel Malfoy’s breath against his cheek.
Potter also buried his head in his free arm.
Malfoy begins to lazily rub his cock through his black and tight underwear and oh Godric Gryffindor, Harry
A couple of minutes later of just walking aimlessly, the ghost left them, claiming he had to do his ‘job’. They were left alone in a rather comfortable silence.
After what he felt like hours of Pansy applying many things to his face (the worst part being the mascara), Pansy finally finished. She brushed and accommodated Draco’s long hair neatly and walked backward away from him, looking at what she had done. She seemed really satisfied with herself.
“Father?” he whispered.
“Draco- need to- move,” Harry begged, slightly rocking his hips, seeking for more friction. The pressure around his cock was overwhelming.
“You… you put your lips together as close as possible, if nobody chickens out you may…” he hesitated and looked around the room, “you kiss, you can…” Harry saw how the words struggled to leave his mouth, “dirty talk, you can touch, grab, hump and do whatever you can to make the other person chicken out,” he explained loudly enough so the whole room listened to the ‘rules’ of the game. “The first one to say ‘I can’t’ loses.”
When they split apart Draco saw straight into Harry’s green eyes. “My parents and I being happy, that’s what I see,” he whispered. Harry made a surprised expression. With a knot on his throat, he painfully whispered, “I love you,” caressing Harry’s left cheek. He directed his hand with his wand towards Harry, pointing at the back of his head, a tear ran down his cheek before he whispered, “Obdormiscere.” Harry’s eyes slowly closed and Draco grabbed him from the back as he fell asleep.
can help you.” Draco didn’t answer, his whole body shivered.
LOVE YOU!”
The next morning he realized how stupid he had been. Letting Potter
“I consent if you consent,” Harry finally said.
“Because you’re straddling me and I can’t move,” Harry replied simply.
McGonagall stopped between them. If she could, she would be drawing flames out of her body.
“Potter, please,” he begged.
Draco’s walls tightened when he came and the feeling along with the view of Draco arching his back and his piercing moan was enough to make Harry come harshly inside of Draco, stream after stream of his thick cum filling him.
“I told you there’s no need to let me down slowly, Potter. I
in his trousers. He can feel his underwear getting wet due to his cumshots. He feels his orgasm through his whole body, weakening him. He tries so hard not to fall on his knees because he isn’t sure his legs can hold him longer.
But he couldn’t help it. This moment, this feeling, everything felt so… intimate. Just the two of them. Together. Finally.
“I’m not,” Potter said as he approached him.
way towards him, it was hurtful because Harry could never feel the same.
“Fuck,” he listened to Potter complaining under his breath.
Harry eyed Clover with a confused gaze, the plant just did what could be considered a shrug with his leaves.
“Release your arm from my grip, then. I’m not holding you tight and you know it,” he whispered because they were closer now. Draco’s breath became irregular. “What do you see,
“I’m close,” he told Draco while thrusting harder against Draco’s spot.
“If you don’t get me out of here I’ll tell Potter your little secret!” she threatened.
He begins to unbutton his shirt and Harry feels a little uncomfortable by the view, because even if he dislikes Malfoy, he respects people’s privacy. When the shirt is out, freeing his milk-like white chest, he proceeds to unbutton his trousers and Harry feels he shouldn’t be there anymore, but he can’t get out now because Malfoy would
They turned their backs and walked again towards their seats.
He flicked the wand near Draco’s arse casting a spell.
“Draco?! What the hell?!” he said looking confused.
Draco tensed at the mention of boggarts. He didn’t even know what his boggart took shape of now that Voldemort was dead, but he had an idea. An idea Potter couldn’t know about… Fuck.
He felt such a horrible pain in his chest and he could barely breathe correctly.
He shouldn’t. He really shouldn’t ask. It would probably just end up destroying him even more. But he couldn’t contain himself.
“Fuck you,” Draco told him and began to walk. Potter quickly caught up with him.
He soon remembered he was still gripping Draco’s waist and let it go.
“Mr Potter, your drinks,” said the bartender, and Draco cursed him internally.
“Anyway, I’m going to bring some Firewhisky, I’ll be back in a bit,” Draco said, standing up and making his way to the bar table.
He pressed one finger in Draco’s hole making him shiver and a few minutes later, he inserted the digit making Draco moan low due to the sudden intrusion. It felt wet and slick due to the lube and it slid easy inside of him.
it’s not Clover. I thought you were smarter than the rest of your race, Draco.” Harry figured out the other voice came from Malfoy’s plant, which he had never heard talking until now.
He looks skinnier, something Harry believed impossible. He has grey circles in the bags down his eyes. He has not been sleeping well.
They were all making their way towards Herbology with the Slytherins. Actually, Harry, Ron and Hermione were walking at Malfoy’s and his gang’s back. The path was really noisy, but few students were actually talking.
The salon was so big it had two stairs at each side that led to the same part. They took the right stair and began to walk at each other’s side. The stairs creaked and Draco grabbed Potter’s arm by instinct.
split apart and it was honestly getting tiring and annoying for their friends.
plant, not mine!” Harry heard Malfoy’s voice hissing. He was about to interrupt when he heard another voice, rougher than Malfoy’s, almost like Clover’s but softer.
“You knew about this?” Draco asked with the letter in his hand.
“I don’t think that’s Pansy, Draco… Hermione wouldn’t have let her here…” Harry hesitated.
“Harry!” yelled Granger.
When they reached the place the cloaked figure had previously been in, it had disappeared. Instead, a centaur was accompanying the brunette boy.
Perhaps because he had been so stupid to believe he would be brave enough to ask Potter for the Yule Ball. It was the most stupid thought that had ever crossed his mind: ‘
They looked at their chest to find some flowers around them with a sign that said ‘
Theo was waiting there for them at a table. They walked towards the table and when they arrived, he couldn’t take his eyes off Draco. Draco played along and winked at him seductively, internally laughing.
“Yeah, ‘cause you’re a slut. Tell me how many people have fucked you?” This time Draco managed to contain the slap he wanted to give Potter.
Harry pulled him down with the grip on his jaw and kissed him. It was rough, needy, his tongues fighting. The pleasure was overwhelming.
“I think it’s a sandstorm, fuck. Should we keep walking, or return?” Potter asked him, turning back to face him. Even though they stopped walking, the wind became harder, and Draco felt even more sand hitting against his skin, some of it hitting his face.
“He lost a bet to us,” Blaise explained.
” FUCK.
He continued shivering and hyperventilating on the floor while the strong arms were around his body holding him tight, his own arms pressed against his chest.
He composed his posture, straightening and he cleared his throat. Trying to hide his embarrassment and to sound secure he said, “Well Potter, you finally showed up. I was just about to leave. Now if you care to give me my…”
“Would you like to be my boyfriend?” The heat that had long abandoned his cheeks came back again. He bit his lower lip again and nodded shyly.
“Really?” Draco asked sarcastically, “What made you think that? Your prick inside my arse or our two orgasms in one night?”
That was the first time Harry’s plant made him look at Malfoy in a different way.
weeks
Draco grabbed his face and made him look up, closing the space between them in a messy but gentle kiss. They had never kissed like that before, it was always messy and violent, not messy and gentle.
Inevitably, he tried to hold himself from the nearest thing next to him, which soon he realized happened to be Potter’s hand.
“I want you- I want you to fill me with your cock. Fuck me.”
“If you say a word Peeves, I swear-”
” asked his plant roughly, looking at Malfoy.
“Be my boyfriend,” he repeated simply again.
He caressed Malfoy’s abdomen, coating his fingers with his spunk, which was starting to dry in his skin. When they split apart he directed his fingers towards Malfoy’s red, wet and plumped lips from their previous kiss. He quickly understood and opened his mouth. He began to lick and suck Harry’s fingers, looking deep in his eyes, leaving his fingers clean of cum but wet in his saliva. Harry pulled them out and Malfoy sucked one last time so they left his mouth a ‘pop’.
He pulled Draco down and wrapped his arms around his neck, closing the space between them in a fervent kiss. Harry licked Draco’s lower lip and Draco gave him access inside his mouth, where their tongues began to swirl around the other. Draco began to move his hips slowly.
“Hermione Granger & Pansy Parkinson” at the center, and at their side: “Harry Potter & Draco Malfoy” Something about the sign and their two names together made Draco’s heart pump faster in his chest. “Seamus Finnigan & Dean Thomas”, “Neville Longbottom & Theodore Nott” and “Lavender Brown & Parvati Patil” at the ends.
Draco tried to pull his hand or stand up from the chair being unsuccessful again.
“Why are you still wearing the bracelet I gave you then?” Harry teases. He had also been wearing his.
He tried to grab his cock with his free hand but Potter stopped him, pinning his arm to the bed and receiving a pissed look from Draco in return. His cock was aching and he
“Are you sure I’m even going to feel it right now?” Draco teased.
“I’m the whore? You have a hard-on just by looking at me you pervert. Who would have thought blokes in dresses it’s what gets the ‘Chosen One’ going,” Draco teased.
“Oh, just Avada Kedavra me!”
“Do you reckon we’re close?” Draco asked him.
Everything happened so fast, in one second he was kneeling, the lantern shattered in pieces on the floor and the fire extinguished, leaving them in total darkness except for the moonlight. He attempted to grab Potter’s motionless, bleeding body on the floor, and in another second, arms were wrapping tightly around his shivering body preventing him from doing so.
“Draco…” he whispered, attempting to get close to him again.
He turned to face boggart-Panasy and pointed his wand at her. “Ri- Riddikulus,” he tried to say but nothing more than a couple of sparks came out of his wand.
anything
That was apparently all he needed because soon he felt Harry’s streams of his thick and sticky cum filling him. Draco fell on top of Harry’s chest, letting him fill him up with his spunk. He was coming so much he could feel the sticky liquid dripping down his thighs, coating Harry’s crotch and probably wetting the bed. There was
He collapsed against the wooden backrest of Draco’s four-poster and Draco collapsed against his chest, resting his head on top of Harry’s messy curls again and wrapping one arm around Harry’s shoulders, the other one resting in his lap, probably staining his white chest with his own cum as well. Harry wrapped his arms lazily around Draco’s torso and rested his head on Draco’s shoulder.
“Yeah, well… You know mine. Do you mind if I ask yours?”
“You know I can’t just let you walk back in my life and forget that all of this happened,” he whispered sobbing.
He slid one of his hands dangerously through Harry’s worked out chest. He straddled him again and lowered his head and licked from Harry's v-line to his sternum in a single lick, making Harry gulp. He was so damn hot.
She also gave him a kind smile and placed her right hand on Draco’s left shoulder. They all looked so… happy.
“Look—” Potter said, getting him out of his thoughts and putting a hand on his chest to stop him from walking further.
“Please tell me we did not just…” Draco said exhaustedly, his voice being muffled against Harry’s skin.
“So what? Isn’t that point, the first one who chickens out loses. If Potter doesn’t want to play then he’s chickening out. He loses without even trying,” Malfoy replied sarcastically with a sneer on his face looking directly into Harry’s eyes, his blush was not there anymore, as if he had the ability to hide it.
And like that, clothed, with their shoes on and their pants sticky, they fell into the arms of Morpheus.
“I hope that Spencer is safe wherever he ended up. I hope it was just a latent portkey and not something more sinister. I just can’t get over the fact that there was a bloody Horcrux in a Muggle shop! Like how does that even happen?” Harry sighed with frustration.
“I agree, your plan was much better than mine. Such a smart man” Draco kissed the top of Harry’s head as Harry’s breathing evened out and he smiled at how amazing his husband was and how proud he was to be married to such a caring and passionate man. Draco drifted off with a soft smile on his face.
“Hey buddy, Papa is ok, he’s just a little worked up over some sad news about a friend. Can you go get Jamie for us and then we can go have some hot chocolate before bed?
“Yes I do, and you know I hate using my name to get favours!”
“Alright, I will go and request the registry to be delivered to the conference room. They will be sorely disappointed that you didn’t come with me but I will tell them that you had an important call to make to the Minister for Magic and the Queen of England and were simultaneously saving a baby kneazle from a tree” Charlotte skipped out of the office easily avoiding the paper ball Harry threw at her as she left laughing. Shaking his head he went into the break room to make tea for himself and his horribly annoying partner. When Charlotte returned ten minutes later she told Harry that when the records staff found out that the request was for a case Harry was working on they made sure that it would be delivered promptly. Harry rolled his eyes and handed Charlotte her tea without putting sugar in it. She took a sip and almost gagged.
“Ok, I will try Scorp” James promised with another yawn and snuggled under his covers.
“They’re not so bad, besides how much trouble can they get into, we will be right there” Harry countered with more confidence than he felt.
“AWWWWW, we’re not sleepy, are we Scorp?” James replied fighting a yawn as he looked at his brother.
“I’ll see what I can do Jamie” Harry promised with a fond smile.
“Both” Draco replied with a smile, “always both.”
“Are you going to help Papa’s friend, Daddy?” Scorpius asked sleepily after the story was finished.
“Swoon worthy, it’s annoying is what it is” Harry muttered bitterly.
“Daddy, can you not be working this weekend so we can see the lions, please?!” James looked up at Harry beseechingly.
“She seemed down, but managing I think. It’s hard to tell over the phone though. I will make sure to tell her that if she needs anything to just call us. I know that you aren’t supposed to have a personal interest in your cases but I doubt many people at the ministry will be banging down your door to take the case, unless it is to see their skewed sense of justice handed down and to make it worse for her.”
Harry reached the lifts and headed back to his office. He hoped he could finish going through the list from the morning so he could start looking into the sellers. He walked towards his office, but then he heard Charlotte call his name. He walked to her office instead.
“I’m almost done. Give me thirty minutes and I will come to your office with my list” Harry replied.
“My hero” Harry fluttered his eyelids and smirked
“Lots of plants because Daddy says veg makes you strong. I think milk and chicken too” Scorpius added knowledgeably.
Harry turned back to Draco and pulled him into a tight hug. “Breathe Draco, we are going to do everything we can to find Spencer, and Pansy wants you to call her as soon as you can. She is a strong woman and she will pull through this, just like she has before. Now that you know, you can help her and be there in any way she needs.”
“So much for relaxing” Harry whined.
“Not yet. The magical forensics team has to wait for their lead scientist to get back from another case and they are still looking at all the objects we brought back. Charlotte and I are looking into who sold the snuffbox to Spencer but no real leads yet.” Harry answered with a sigh.
“Alright lads, time for bed!”  Draco announced
“Sounds good. How about we start with Gladstone in the morning around 10 and then we can drop in on McTavish after lunch” Harry suggested.
“Remember” Harry corrected smiling. “Thank you for apologizing, now you and Scorp need to go to the powder room to wash your hands because we are going to make our own pizzas for dinner.”
“DADDY, PAPA, not time for hugging! It’s time for hot cho’late!” Scorpius’ voice broke through the moment and the two men smiled turning towards their boys who had their hands on their hips and a long suffering look on their faces.
Harry watched his boys from James’ bed with such awe and love spilling out of his heart. It never ceased to amaze him that this was his life. He never wanted to take moments like this for granted. Especially knowing that they could change in an instant. Draco looked over at Harry with teary eyes and Harry returned his watery smile. James on the other hand was not aware of the sappy moment that was happening around him, so he said, “Can we go to the zoo this weekend? I want to see the lions!”
“Oh that's brilliant love, can you tell me what potion that is?”
“I didn’t use your name for a favour, they noticed your name on the case file you plonker!” Charlotte replied shuddering at the bitter after taste in her mouth.
“I’m sleepy Jamie, and the faster we go to sleep, the faster we will wake up and play!” Scorpius said sleepily.
“I have no idea, but you will get to the bottom of it and you will find a way to solve this mystery. Not just because it’s someone we know, but because you need to make sure that that kind of evil is destroyed completely” Draco replied emphatically.
“It’s ok, just calm down a bit buddy. Now go wash up and then come to the kitchen”.
“And back” Scorpius finished.
Charlotte and Harry interview Mr. Johnson. They then return to the ministry and are met with a tiny crisis in the lab and Harry reveals a secret to a colleague.
Harry wraps up the case and Narcissa surprises the family.
“I will try my best sweetheart, thank you for believing in me! I love you to the moon” Draco whispered.
“Right, aprons and sleeves boys” Harry blushed lightly. Once they were ready to get a little messy, Harry put a pizza crust in front of each boy and he and Draco helped them spread the tomato sauce and add the veg and cheese. James’ pizza looked like a cheesy mountain and Scorpius had a lot of fun putting one of each of the vegetables on his pizza to create a face. Then he covered the top with cheese for the “hair”. Harry and Draco made their pizzas, less artistically, but more in keeping with a traditional pizza and then they put them into the oven. The boys sat on their knees staring through the oven door as the pizzas cooked and Harry and Draco cleaned the counters. Putting the leftover ingredients into the fridge, Harry looked at Draco with a raised eyebrow, “So, was it as bad as you anticipated?”
PANSY?! That’s the craziest story I’ve ever heard!” Draco replied after Harry had given him a quick run down of his day. “I wish she had gotten into contact with me, I could have been there for her! I could have helped her in some way! I can’t imagine what she has gone through. I hate that those bastards got her. We need to help her get justice Harry! We need to find her husband! You need to help her!” Draco’s voice started to get louder and more desperate as he continued to speak. He took a shuddering breath and was about to continue ranting when a small voice called, “Papa?”
“I love you too, you sap” Draco smiled as leaned forward to capture Harry’s lips in a quick kiss.
“That’s the spirit” Harry said with a dry smile.
“Hey, don’t blame your anti-social ways on me you recluse!” Harry replied with feigned indignation.
Draco told Harry that he had a bit of paperwork to catch up on for his latest orders and Harry said he was fine with that as he wanted to prepare for his interviews tomorrow. They sat together in the study and finished their respective tasks. Draco finished first, so he went into the kitchen to make some tea and brought it back just as Harry finished the last of his questions. They settled into the lounge by the fire and talked more about the little domestic things that needed to get done in the next few days and then decided to turn in early as they were both tired from their days.
Scorpius toddled out into the hall and looked at his fathers, with worry and confusion.
Harry shut the door almost all the way and cast a monitoring spell so they would know if either of the boys stirred in the night.
“Hey, I would have stopped eventually, but you’re probably right, it wouldn’t have been of my own volition” Harry shrugged.
“Yes, but one of our sons is a menace and the other is not far behind!” Draco said
Harry recounts his day and the family spends time at the zoo.
“It’s one I made up, it gives you the ability to be super strong so you can lift heavy things like cars or Hippogriffs” Scorpius explained.
“Hey, any news from the lab,” he asked as he sat down.
“James! He is right behind you! You don’t need to yell,” Harry sighed. James was so impulsive and loud. He loved his son but sometimes he could be too much to handle. James mumbled sorry again and Harry kissed his head.
“It was great. Did you stop for a break yourself?”
“This is going to be interesting, wherever did you get this insane idea Potter?” Draco looked at the ingredients dubiously.
“I was thinking of a good book and maybe a neck massage” Draco managed to gasp out as Harry began pulling their shirts off.
They finished their food and began walking back to the Ministry. When they reached the entrance to the atrium Draco kissed Harry goodbye and Harry walked through the doors.
“I was watching a show and a family was making pizza together. It looked fun and easy enough and I thought it would be a good way for the boys to start learning how to cook” Harry replied
“Now I can’t tell whether you’re talking about me or my arse.” Harry grumbled
“We’re all clean!” Scorpius announced as he and James came into the kitchen. Their eyes grew wide as they saw all the pizza ingredients laid out on the counter.
“They got some traces they are investigating further and one magical trace they think will lead to a person of interest. I told them to keep me updated and they should have something by the end of the day” Charlotte replied.
“You’ll get there, you are one of the top investigators for a reason, love” Draco smiled at Harry. “You have mayo on your cheek by the way” Draco said reaching across the small table with a napkin to wipe Harry’s cheek.
(See the end of the chapter for
“Wait, wait wait, first we are going to put on aprons and roll up our sleeves”, Draco cut in. Draco shook his head at his husband. Sometimes Harry was just as impetuous as their sons in his enthusiasm to try new things as well as find ways for them to have new experiences as a family. He loved him for it, but also found it endearingly exasperating.
“Great. I’m off. The boys wanted pizza for dinner so I will have time to get the ingredients instead of calling for a takeaway” Harry smiled at the thought of make-your-own pizza night.
Harry grabbed his chin, wiped a bit of tomato sauce from the corner of his mouth and leant in closer. “I always win when it counts” and before Draco could reply, grabbed the empty plates to start the dishes. The boys came over when Harry called them and helped to put the cutlery in the drawers once they were dried. Then they went into the study to watch a show and play before bed. Harry and Draco had established a no work time between dinner and the boys bedtime so that the boys never felt like they were less important than whatever work their fathers needed to get done, so Harry and Draco settled on the couch to chat quietly while the boys drew and coloured while watching a cartoon.
“I did get to the canteen for a bite, but my favourite person wasn’t there so I ate in my office” Charlotte joked.
“Daddy?” James called, “Can you help me draw a lion, I will colour it, but I can’t get the face to look good”
“You bet your arse I would if need be, but it wasn’t” Charlotte replied throwing a snarky grin over her shoulder as she walked to the conference room.  Harry again rolled his eyes and followed. The registry appeared on the table a minute later and they began using scrying spells to find if any of the names on their sellers list were witches or wizards. The repeat sellers were not in the registry, but two names came up as having attended Hogwarts.
“Er, um, I was actually hoping you could convince them to let us look through the records here, you know so we can have peace and quiet and… You know how they treat me there!” Harry’s voice burst out, “So much adulation and way too many dewy eyed witches. They know I’m married to a bloke, but does that stop them! NO! I have kids for Merlin’s sake!” Harry started to get more and more exasperated.
“Percival Gladstone and Elaine McTavish. Not ringing any bells as former death eaters, but we should go check them out” Charlotte said.
“Brilliant. I have a few errands I need to run beforehand so I will meet you there” Charlotte countered.
Draco meets with Pansy. Harry and Charlotte are hitting dead ends.
They made their way to a little sandwich shop a few blocks away from the Ministry that they went to every once and while. They ordered sandwiches and crisps and water and sat at one of the tables outside. They settled into a comfortable silence as they started eating their lunch.
“That’s why you have me and I will always take care of my most precious possession” Draco grabbed Harry’s arse as they made their way into the lifts.
Will Harry be able to save Spencer?
“YAY! Scorp we might be able to see lions!” James clapped his hands.
“You’ve had a long day! Let’s get some tea and watch a fluff show to unwind”
“That's why they love you. A hero and a father with adorable kids. It’s totally swoon worthy”
“It’ll be fine, because they made them they will be more inclined to at least try it and if not we can always share ours with them, they won’t eat tons anyway” Harry replied more enthusiastically than was warranted. Once the cheese was melted, they took their creations out of the oven and let them cool a bit. Then they all sat at the round oak table and tried their pizzas. James declared that his was a cheesy masterpiece and Scorpius enthusiastically ate each topping on the “face” and then he ate the crust with just the sauce and “hair” left. Harry smirked when the boys had finished their meal, much to the chagrin of Draco who conceded defeat and said,
Harry rolled his eyes and stepped out of the lift. “It’s a good thing I love you because you are incorrigible”
“That’s something at least. So here is my list. I have five names, three of which sold to Spencer on multiple occasions. I also have two auction houses that he buys from regularly”. Harry took Charlotte’s list as she looked over his shoulder. “You have those three names as well and only 4 names I don’t have.  I know Pansy said that the Horcrux may have been with the auction deliveries but without Spencer to confirm where that particular item came from we’ll just have to check all of the sellers and narrow it down. So we have nine names to cross reference with the school registry and to see if any are wizards or witches. If we get any hits we can interview them tomorrow and Friday. We can also go to the auction houses to see if they have records of what Spencer purchased there as he didn’t always have a complete sellers list from them.” Harry stated.
“Hey! You didn’t put sugar in my tea, you know I take sugar!”
Some more family fluff and the creator of the Horcrux is revealed.
“That sounds like a great potion to have” Draco replied with a smile. What ingredients do you need to add to make the potion?”
“You’ve won this round Potter, but you may not be so lucky next time”
“Yes, once we find out who made it, we are going to make sure that it is the only one, and that they can’t pull a Voldemort” Harry shuddered.
Draco and Harry smiled at each other again shaking their heads in amusement, and Harry said, “We’ll see Jamie, it depends on if I’m needed at work or not”
“No Daddy, I sorry, I just wanted to beat Scorp to the TV because he said he would make us watch Peppa Pig and I ha-do not like Peppa Pig” James caught himself. They had a rule that hate was not a word that they used lightly and that there were better ways to voice their dislike of something. Harry crouched down and brought James into his arms. He looked into his son’s eyes and said, “I am not fond of Peppa myself, but we still do not run in the hallway. We could hurt ourselves or someone else”
Fifteen minutes later Draco announced that it was time for bed, and after a few seconds of pleading to stay up later the boys headed upstairs followed by their fathers. They had their baths, brushed their teeth and got into their pajamas. Tonight was Draco’s turn to read a story and the boys chose Robin Hood. They loved the illustrations in the book and always asked to have Draco spell them to move. After kisses and hugs, Harry and Draco stepped out into the hall with a final “good night” and headed back downstairs.
“I know, I just feel so guilty that she had to go through that and didn’t feel like she could call on me to help.”
“You can as long as my husband doesn’t find out, he’s very much the jealous type” Harry answered coyly.
Well, that's a wrap, I hope you enjoyed this little fluffy adventure! Thanks for reading!
Harry sighed into the kiss and then buried his nose into the crook of Draco’s neck breathing him in.
“I love you so much Draco” Harry leaned his head back to look at Draco.
“...None of us practices pureblood customs all that seriously, though...” Luna commented.
Harry shuddered. “That is the one thing I agree with.”
“Oh?” Zhongli looked delighted. His face didn’t let out much, but somehow, he wore his heart on his sleeves. “That’s so thoughtful of you, Cousin-in-law.”
Of course, Daphne and Astoria had been transferred to Beauxbaton during the very early stages of the war, when the Order was still only engaging in guerilla attacks. Like Theodore Nott, they never returned to Petra, so Harry couldn't exactly pop in for a visit to meet them. So he sent an official letter to Lord and Lady Greengrass, requesting for their daughter’s hand.
, which had robbed Sirius away from him.
“No!!!” Ginny’s reaction wasn’t any less intense the second time around. If anything, it was the opposite. Her chair toppled as she shot to her feet. “I thought you said you don’t want to!”
The whispers all stopped when Draco Malfoy set foot in Petra’s Royal Castle.
Life was miserable for the scrawny boy, scorned by his guardians and treated like a servant, often going cold and hungry. Sometimes, Harry himself didn’t know how he’d managed to survive those years.
As Harry was musing over how he should get Malfoy to call him by his given name in public too, the King caught the sight of Ginny sending Malfoy what could only be described as a smug look.
Yet, Harry couldn’t shake the feeling that he’d shaved off his humanity, layer by layer.
As Ginny spoke, Harry could see Fleur cringing from the other side of the long dining table. She made some abortive movements with her hands, and the blonde part-Veela sighed at the end of Ginny’s questions.
Stepping through the threshold felt very much like the familiar sensation of being forced through a very tight rubber tube. Harry landed shakily on his feet on the other side, his face slightly green with nausea.
Malfoy and Li appeared to have genuine affection for each other. In fact, they suited each other so well - the picture perfect pureblood couple, much like how Lucius and Narcissa Malfoy were. The thought had strangely irked Harry, instead of making him sorry to break them apart.
“Welcome to Petra’s Royal Castle,” Harry spoke as he looked into those passive grey eyes, his voice sincere, “I hope this place can be your new home.”
She looked back at him, searching his face for something, before she sighed. Some of the tension left her back. “...All right,” she conceded.
The Queen flinched back visibly.
spat by that very same mouth lingered in Harry’s mind. [1]
The rest of the room turned their gazes to the man sitting next to the fuming pair of mother and daughter, the man who had a circlet of rubies and gold resting on his messy black hair. His green eyes were dull and unfocused.
His mind blanked out at pretty much the same time.
Draco felt queasy. He truly had no idea if his Father was going to kill him for this, but… the blonde took a deep breath. “Listen,” he needed to know. “The status of my family is no longer what it used to be, before the war. I don’t think my Father will begrudge your Mother if…” His Father likely would, but he might have preferred withdrawing on his own terms.
casual?
Harry sighed inwardly. Their relationship had been tense since the bespectacled boy’s birthday, when Ginny had offered herself to Harry – organising a night out without Molly Weasley knowing was no mean feat – and Harry
“Draco Malfoy,” Hermione suddenly said.
The court of Petra had swung from being strongly conservative to being strongly liberal too fast that the previous upper class felt that they had lost their footing.
The strange moment was broken when Luna arrived. “I’m sorry I’m late.” For once, the witch was dressed not in whimsical bright coloured robes and her favourite pink armadillo earrings. She wore form-fitting baby blue dress-robes that matched her eyes, and her flowy pale blonde hair was loosely braided and secured with a gold pin. She looked like a doll.
“Oh, she’s killing it in Goryeo,” Zabini looked pleased as punch, “If you need any spices for your engagement party, we would be happy to supply you with high grade pepper! We’ll throw in chillies as well!”
“Confirmation would have been nice,” Hermione scowled. “So, Lord Tartaglia really is the former Eleventh Harbinger of the Fatui.”
“Oh, does Your Majesty not know?” Slughorn looked surprised. “Draco Malfoy has been betrothed to Lord Li Syaoran, the heir of House Li from the Kingdom of Han, since before he started schooling in Hogwarts. He’s surely accepted the idea of being married to another wizard.”
Zabini chuckled. “Now, now Draco…”
Malfoy returned the smile. It was fond and genuine, like the smile he had returned Lord Li. “Thank you for coming, Theo. I need all the help I can get.”
“And of course, I am very, very grateful for the amnesty, Your Majesty,” Slughorn was quick to follow up. “Perhaps… ‘safe’ isn’t the most appropriate word… more like… ‘respected’?” He murmured.
“Rise,” Harry merely replied, “come here,” he beckoned the blonde to climb up the stairs. It was time to put the third throne, which had been placed onto the dais this morning and provoked a lot of interesting reactions, into good use. The court had not been this noisy since the very same blonde pureblood wizard dropped by with his prestigious former fiance in tow.
Harry longed to press his fingers against his temple. But he still had an audience. “I hear you,” the monarch settled with that response. “Thank you, Horace. Your opinion is valuable.”
“Greetings, Your Majesty, I am so sorry to intrude upon Your Kingdom,” Lord Li said pleasantly in a slightly husky voice. His Petran wasn’t accented at all. Every part of his speech, mannerism and demeanor screamed high-class, privileged conservative pureblood. “I merely worry for my betrothed,” Li peered at Malfoy visibly.
The dark skinned wizard dropped his persona and shook his head. “I can’t get over how fast you tie yourself down. I myself probably won’t have a child until I’m thirty, at least,” he leaned back on his chair languidly.
“Do you think they will do nothing as we threaten their livelihoods!? Even cornered animals will attack for survival!”
Harry wasn’t alone in his paranoia. A lot of people in the Order of the Phoenix appeared shaken by the implication of Walden Macnair’s foolish but bold move and his military resources. The idea of the former Death Eaters’ retaliation was always in everyone’s mind, of course, but it had been more of a distant possibility before the incident.
Few words were spoken after, only moans and grunts filling the air.
“Welcome, Your Majesty,” a gravelly deep voice spoke, and Malfoy dropped into a curtsy straight away, followed by the other two purebloods.
“It’s an honour to receive you in my home, Your Majesty.” Harry noticed Zhongli’s eyes straying to the lily brooch on his lapels when the monarch introduced himself, and those amber eyes turned soft.
It didn’t take too long for someone to notice that Harry was almost a carbon copy of the late James Potter, the last heir of the duchy of Gryffindor, who had famously eloped with Librarian muggle-born Lily Evans. James’ and Lily’s lives had perished in the hands of the reigning terror of a dictator, the last heir of the duchy of Slytherin, King Tom “Voldemort” Riddle.
Li looked alarmed, while Malfoy took a sharp breath. Malfoy’s expression changed, like he had seen Harry in a different light. For once, the blonde’s mind was clear for Harry to read, even without any legilimency whatsoever. ‘
“Greetings, Your Majesty,” Malfoy said, perfectly polite. Ghost of memories of ‘
Now Hermione looked annoyed. “I can’t find any details on that either… but rumours say Snezhnaya destroyed herself from within.”
Harry couldn’t see anything beyond the door as it was opened – just mist – and McGonagall disappeared through it the moment she stepped through. A part of Harry’s mind was frozen in fear by how much the door reminded him of
“You look beautiful,” it was Zabini who voiced out what was in everyone’s mind.
Harry should have known that Ginny would be in his bed.
“...I noticed there were no spicy dishes,” Nott spoke. Malfoy looked alarmed. “I heard you like them. If you don’t mind, may I please give you these?” He opened a box of red peppers which flared out at the bottom like flower petals.
Charlie Weasley uncrossed his leg and made to get up, but he was startled when Ronald Weasley banged his fist on the round table. “How about us?”
The King of Kasha, Francis d’Aumont, was a middle-aged man with chestnut blonde hair and an amiable smile. His voice was pleasant as he greeted Harry. “Thank you very much for the invitation, King Harold and Queen Ginerva. We are so happy that Petra has decided to open her borders to us again, after 30 years.” He gestured at his company, a dark-haired woman who was decked to the nines in shiny precious stones and luxurious purple silk robes, and a blonde blue-eyed man whose somber, dark robes couldn’t hide how gorgeous he was. He wore a bejeweled choker that one really couldn’t miss, a diamond almost as big as a pebble adorning its centre. “Please let me introduce you to my Queen, Maria Carolina, and my Maîtresse-en-titre, Timothée Clement.”
Ginny’s eyes turned glossy with tears, too, but Harry’s thoughts and emotions still didn’t come across. “The deaths are their fault, Harry! All the more we shouldn’t forgiv-”
Harry blinked and turned to stare at the wizard on his left.
The bespectacled boy shook his head. “I prefer them fried, too,” he chimed as he piled fish and chips onto his plate.
And a Gryffindor heir reigned over the Kingdom of Petra once again.
His grey eyes widened in surprise. “Great-uncle-in-law!? Are you sure? Where are they?”
Harry cleared his throat. “I’ll leave it to you, Draco.” They had agreed privately that Harry should call the blonde by his given name in public.
“Parkinson’s comment on financial distress just reminded me of it,” Hermione looked guilty, “It seems the marriage is a terrible prospect to them too… We’ll need to use everything in our disposal to realise this plan. I’m not telling you to coerce him… I am just laying the cards on the table.”
“I wonder if they use wands? Their branch of magic rely much more heavily on channeling the powers of familiars and spirits-”
“You’re too generous, Cousin-in-law.” Malfoy seemed happy that Zhongli was pleased with his gifts. Viscount Nott looked visibly relieved to be out of the woods. “Please, do stay over for lunch.”
“Your Majesty,” the King of Kasha’s smile looked strained. “Please forgive us… I’m afraid we have to decline your kind offer.” The middle-aged man leaned over to caress the choker on the blonde’s neck. “We are expecting.”
The Queen took a sharp breath. “I can’t believe it…” she remarked through gritted teeth. “You are all actually seriously proposing this… this preposterous idea!”
“Your Majesty,” someone spoke in a lyrical tenor voice. “I’m exhausted.”
“Hmm,” the blonde nodded, the items passing his keen discerning eyes for quality. “Blaise,” he called the other pureblood aristocrat without looking at him.
Harry blinked again. “I don’t know, Hermione,” he stared at his hands unseeingly. “I kinda want to spend one last year in Hogwarts. Ride on Hogwarts Express one final time, lounge around the Great Lake and catch a glimpse of a tentacle of the Giant Squid, feast in the Great Hall…. Going to this…this Maha-
Harry watched the blonde’s figure as he walked away; his head was… full.
Harry, Hermione and Neville frowned as they were thinking hard. Only Luna didn’t seem perturbed. “...Oh, how about Gemma Farley? She isn’t that much older than us, I don’t think...” the blonde young woman suggested.
Malfoy declined the offer with a shake of his head, his loose hair hanging limply around him. “Thanks, Blaise. But I have no appetite.”
(His head was too full of the Kingdom he’d inherited.)
A/N: Merry Christmas! Your comments would be lovely presents to me!!
“Thank you so much, Count Slughorn. I know I can always trust you,” butter wouldn’t melt in Harry’s mouth.
“What do you think about James Fred-” Ginny tried to reopen the topic on potential names for their child, but Harry interrupted her by grabbing her hand.
Harry furrowed his eyebrows. “Do we even know whether he’s…” His cheeks turned red from embarrassment. “Whether he… likes...men?”
“Thanks for your hard work,” Harry wanted to say more, but the words were all jumbled up in his mind. “Have a good rest.”
Draco nodded stiffly. “Yes, miraculously, I survived.”
Slughorn looked reluctant too. “Young mister Nott is certainly clever, but he has always preferred to be solitary. I do not think he has the social abilities to represent the pureblood faction… and I frankly think the boy will be happier not to.” He rubbed his temple, “And please do not suggest Gregory Goyle. Just… don’t.”
The King succumbed to his bad habit of running his hand through his hair when he was stressing over something, messing the bird nest even further. “Aren’t there other people? Zabini or Nott?”
To Harry’s relief, he did get to board the Hogwarts Express and feast at the Great Hall again.
Harry was then quickly taken in by a resistance group, the Order of the Phoenix. They had been plotting for a revolution for
Harry put down his cup with a clink against the porcelain saucer. “Yes,” he leaned back casually against his chair, every inch the King of a powerful Kingdom he was. “Well, I’m sure you didn’t need me to spell it out loud.”
“Don’t worry, I’ll entertain them!” Tartaglia chimed in eagerly. “I’d like to know your relative as well!”
Harry smiled wanly. He felt glad to hear that he didn’t just make a huge mistake.
“...so who?”
“So, after Viola Richmond also ignored your
“Your Majesty, please call me Horace,” The Potion teacher couldn’t help but preen a little. Harry didn’t miss the shadow of concern that crossed Slughorn’s blue eyes, however. Harry used to not be able to read subtle changes in expressions… it was surprising how much he’d changed since he’d taken the throne.
“Who what?” Harry replied without looking up.
Malfoy exhaled slowly, not in a hurry to talk. The conservative purebloods faction was always saying that the liberals were too direct.
She caught Harry looking at her, and reached for his hand to give it a squeeze.
“...Oh?” For a moment, Malfoy had lost all the colours on his face. Harry straightened up in his chair in alarm, thinking that the blonde would lose the content of his gut to the floor again. His morning sickness had proved more violent and volatile than Ginny’s.
Before the mood turned strange, Harry blurted. “Was it true that Wormtail lost an arm during Voldemort’s meeting with Zhongli and Tartaglia?”
“But I’m so weak-” Malfoy buried his face against Li’s shoulder and hid more of himself underneath the wide sleeves of Li’s robes.
“Milord?” Harry wasn’t alarmed, but he was surprised when Zhongli placed his bare hands on top of Malfoy’s pregnant belly.
The Order’s first recommendation was the Greengrass sisters.
Andromeda showed Harry a grateful smile. “... You are right…” she shuddered slightly as her grey eyes took on a faraway look.
And swayed on her feet.
He suddenly felt very touched. “...I…”
“He’s the one who wants your child, he should be the one to carry it!”
Simple and straight to the point.
“No,” Malfoy interrupted Harry for the first time during their meeting, but the blonde looked too horrified to notice. “Only magic can choose the heir. It’s not something dictated by the order of birth.”
“No!” Ginny’s eyes flashed with anger. “This is unprecedented!”
Harry blanched. “To visit this... former Great-uncle-in-law of yours?” He asked incredulously. Ginny was so close to giving birth; he didn’t want to be away from
Harry was unable to tell whether this error was deliberate or not. The elderly wizard appeared really shaken. “I still want to know
Any other day, she would be his picture perfect image of home, her loosely braided hair resting on her left shoulder, her lap and stomach covered in a cozy blanket. Harry would press closer to her, tucking his cold feet under her calves. She would shriek and smack him before they both huddled under the covers, and Harry would rub her stomach and chat with the baby.
Silence fell over the room.
” he suddenly said, his amber eyes luminous; they were glowing like fireflies. “May God bless you.” [2]
What would be left of him, in the end?
Harry did not bother to correct her assumption of his need for reassurance. “Yeah, it will.”
Harry looked down at the plate of treacle tarts he’d pilfered for himself. Would he have to go without these for months?
“Do you know, that out of all the wizarding communities all over the world, the Japanese community has the most harmonious relationship with the Muggles? This experience will help us learn something, don’t you think?” She smiled encouragingly.
“Our School has the space. The declining birth rate in Japan has lowered intake drastically, unfortunately.” The woman who must be the Headmistress of Mahoutokoro, despite how
The beautiful man turned to his companion. “What does it say?” His voice was deep and slightly husky, as wise and timeless as his gaze. He trusted the redhead enough to let him open his letters.
“... None of those customs showed up in my research,” Hermione was apologetic, but also sulking. “All books I have perused through say that Kasha has similar customs and culture with Petra-”
2) 天禽 Tiānqín, meaning celestial birds. It's a star in ε UMa, a part of Ursa Major constellation.
Harry had come to rely on Hermione tremendously over the war. He didn’t want to be with such a dangerous person without her.
Slughorn appeared speechless, before he coughed to regain his composure. “I’m afraid Quentin’s sweetheart has important commitments for the next five years… And my niece, Roseline, her work in Kasha-” [3]
The next morning saw Harry walking toward Malfoy’s quarters, pushing a trolley overflowing with food.
Slughorn could not emphasise enough the importance of the ring’s symbolisms.
Harry blinked. This was the first time he’d heard this. “...I see.” In any case, stipulating the minimum number of heirs for the respective Houses in the contract was enough. If Malfoy wanted to bear Harry more children, Harry would not complain.
“Why did you suddenly think of him, anyways?” Harry said dismissively. In any case, his gut feeling told him that Harry would be better off not meeting Draco Malfoy.
“Your Majesty,” Harry counted it as his victory that Malfoy caved in first, “I believe you mentioned in your letter that you would like to discuss about the settlement…”
Harry turned to the source of the voice, and inhaled sharply.
Ginny’s face turned almost as red as her hair. “Once is once too many!” She yanked her hand away.
Harry’s eyes widened. He’d been part of the wizarding world for eight years, but it was the first time he heard that wizards could get pregnant. There was always something new to discover, it seemed impossible to catch up.
“Little Wolf,” Malfoy replied the boy, his face less shocked than the Asian boy’s but grimmer, his grey eyes haunted.
Thankfully, Zhongli didn’t look disappointed. “I’ll show you next time.”
“We must meet again!” Hermione looked at the older man with bright eyes. She looked like she was on the verge of just grabbing his hands. “How about I invite you to my house for tea?”
His blood was boiling. “Do you want Petra to plunge into another war!?” He roared.
Yamato… an island Kingdom not unlike Petra, located in the Far East, further than even Han Kingdom.
He owed the couple some privacy for forcefully breaking them up.
“Especially about Durmstrang, where the Snezhnaya empire used to be,” Hermione crossed her arms. “Lord Tartaglia is obviously fond of Lord Zhongli. For some reason, Lord Zhongli can’t - or won’t, I don’t know - stay in Han. The two can’t live in Yamato anymore and it’s more… comfortable for them to move somewhere they’re welcome in the King’s court. So that is what we are offering them. Did I cover everything?” she asked the blonde.
As Harry helped Malfoy get down from the carriage, he held on to the blonde’s hand for longer than necessary, his eyes fixed on the long, slender fingers.
Harry and Hermione were looking around with wide eyes. Luna looked absently fascinated, as she always did. Malfoy, Zabini and Theodore Nott were expressionless.
Harry fought the blush that was threatening to invade his cheeks at being caught trying to eavesdrop. “Yes, I must have,” he mumbled.

“What does the colour of the robes signify? And…” she hesitated a little, “if I may ask, why you are not wearing one?”
Slughorn shook his head. “House Bulstrode is one of the Sacred Twenty-Eight, but Miss Milicent is a half blood. So is Miss Tracey Davies.”
The dark-skinned man seemed to ask that question quite often these days.
The widower returned his greeting with a wistful smile of her own, while Teddy remained asleep, his expression so innocent and carefree.
“I’m sure you know, Lord Li,” Harry interrupted, flaunting that he feared no threat of war from the Han Kingdom, although deep in his heart, he truly didn’t want another war. Malfoy and Li didn’t know it was a bluff, though. “That the Life Debt gives no leeway with respect to such provisions. If Draco Malfoy is to refuse, you will be married to a dead fiance.”
“Why not?” Hermione snorted. “You were certainly obsessed with him in sixth year.”
Malfoy’s face almost lost all colours. “It’s a difficult goal that may not be realised within our lifetime.”
“I’m glad that you like them,” from the way Malfoy suppressed his shudder, he didn’t either.
“You can’t,” The brilliant witch smiled wryly and shrugged, “Come, Harry, we have a war council meeting to attend.”
“Harry,” someone tugged at his sleeve.
And he was going to go through it at least three times.
Harry straightened up in his seat. It was a name that evoked many emotions.
Molly and Ron, who’d rushed to the youngest Weasley’s bedside when they heard that she had collapsed, gasped. “My baby girl!” Molly teared. “My first grandchild will be from my youngest… oh my!”
Sorry if the import of Genshin Impact characters came out of the left field. I've fallen into Genshin hell, so hard and fast, and there was no going back... RIP wallet!
Comment please!
,” the brown-haired boy interrupted her with a whisper, his brown eyes widening until a ring of white could be seen around his irises. A few Mahoutokoro students shot him disbelieving dark looks – it seemed they truly upheld politeness in high regards – but the Head Boy didn’t seem to notice. No, he only had eyes for-
“What compensation do you require?” He asked coldly.
Syaoran’s smile widened. “Me too,” his callous hand gave another squeeze. “Just drop the ‘little’, may be. We’re not so little anymore… Dragon.”
Malfoy twitched infinitesimally, but he remained silent. “Prophecy?” It was Harry who voiced the question. He was really not fond of prophecies that turned people’s lives upside down.
Slughorn perked up as well. “An excellent suggestion,” he rubbed his chin. “If I recalled correctly, he had considerable influence even before he became a prefect… He could even be said to be the leader of his peers…”
Harry caressed Teddy’s smooth cheeks. He had always loved children. “It’s our fault for not consulting you about the menu. We didn’t think of it. Besides,” he smiled when baby Teddy scrunched his nose, “You’ve not been following those customs for so long… It’s natural you forgot a lot of them.”
“Please forgive me for my rudeness earlier. Nice to meet you. I am Harry, son of James and Lily Potter,” the King gave a polite nod.
That was the one fate he wanted Petra to avoid at all costs.
“Yes, Great-uncle-in-law,” Malfoy latched onto the connection immediately.
The Malfoy he remembered from school had a huge sweet tooth. Harry thought he saw scones, muffins, or croissants with jam on the blonde’s breakfast plate often in Hogwarts; sometimes even pancakes, drenched in golden, syrupy honey. Not to mention, the care packages Narcissa Malfoy sent were notoriously famous for being filled to the brim with chocolates, and only about half were shared with Crabbe and Goyle.
The rage was gone as soon as it came, suddenly replaced with melancholy. “If we have to wage another war… What did Dumbledore die for? What did Sirius, Remus and Tonks die for? What did Teddy lose his parents for!?” Harry choked, his chest heaving painfully as he sobbed. He couldn’t stop the tears from falling. “What did your brother die for!?”
Malfoy’s owl was considerably more difficult to write. Harry mulled over it for days, words forming and disintegrating in the back of his mind even as he attended morning assemblies and meetings with his subjects on various national issues…
Malfoy’s grey eyes flickered as they met Harry’s. Perhaps, Malfoy was still not used to seeing Harry with black hair and having such a square face. Harry had looked a little different when he was in disguise in Hogwarts.
Still, heartened by their apparently enduring betrothal, Draco ploughed on. “I kind of like that I have this nickname for you,” he spoke, his voice coming out softer than he expected.
Yet, since Lucius Malfoy fell from King Voldemort’s grace because of his defeat in a guerilla attack from the Order of the Phoenix, Harry began to see Draco Malfoy as just a scared boy, trapped in a war that he did not truly want to be a part of, same as Harry.
“Shall we write the letters, then?” Luna’s quip broke the bubble.
Understanding finally dawned upon Malfoy’s expression. “Of course…” He sat back down on his throne like his knees had lost the strength to carry his weight. “Of course that led to a succession crisis. His heir isn't exactly…”
’ was Harry’s thought when he saw the blue gem Malfoy was inspecting in his hands.
“It wasn’t mentioned,” Hermione shrugged. “This sometimes happens in pureblood Houses. I’m not sure why.”
“Little dragon, please!” Big, tanned hands cupped Malfoy’s pale and pointed face and held it close, foreheads pressing against one another. Tears were also streaming down Li’s face. “I’m sorry I have to protect the interest of my House.
“Any news? Did they find out who made the horcrux?” Harry asked hopefully.
“Sounds good. I will go to the lab and see if they have made any progress while you do that”
“Ok ok, you little monsters let’s go and satisfy your need for sweets” Harry chuckled as the boys yelled triumphantly and ran towards the kitchen. Once the boys had their chocolate craving satisfied the two men shooed them upstairs for a bath and teeth brushing. Having finished getting ready for bed, the boys settled into Scorpius’ bed to have a story. It was Harry’s turn to read so Draco settled on the end of the bed as Harry snuggled between the boys. He took out their favourite book full of Muggle fairy tales and read them “The Tinderbox” which was James’ favourite. He loved the part where the dogs come to the soldier and bring him gold and silver.  When they got to the part where the soldier falls in love with the princess, the boys always squealed in horror making their fathers grin.
“JAMIE!” Scorpius screeched running back to the study where he and James had been watching a tv show, “we gonna have hot cho’late, come on!”
“Ya. I rang her on her mobile this morning. She was a little surprised that I called, but after the initial stilted pleasantries we fell into it just like old times. I am going to meet her for coffee tomorrow morning while the boys are at my mother’s.”
“Have a good night Harry and give those boys a hug from their aunty Char”
Harry turned with a mock salute and made his way back to his office. He got back to his list and thirty minutes later made his way back to Charlotte’s office.
“Night” Harry sighed as he snuggled closer.
“That sounds lovely and all, but no thank you. I have a much better plan” Harry panted as he continued to divest himself and Draco of their clothes. They fell into bed and after an intense session of lovemaking Harry felt much more relaxed.
“Well as you are the fittest man I have ever seen, he has every right to be possessive of you” Draco snarked back. Harry laughed and got up from his desk to give his husband a kiss and grabbed his coat.
“I wanna see! Can I turn now?” Blaise said from the corner.
are ridiculous, Draco. Thinking that somebody could possibly ever love you,” she said cynically.
Potter pulled his fingers out and with that same hand began to jerk his cock, covering it in lube and spreading the precome already leaking from its head throughout his whole length.
And that was all he needed to come. Streams of white, sticky cum coating and contrasting in his black silk dress. His arsehole clenched frantically around Harry's cock and that was apparently what took the other man to the edge. He felt Harry's thick seed filling him up so good he never wanted it to stop and he felt Harry's cock twitching inside of him as streams of cum shoot out of it. A few moments later, Harry pulled his now soft cock out with a squelching sound.
love you!”
being my… boyfriend?” Draco hesitated.
He climbed on top of Draco again and grabbed his hips, playing with the elastic of his boxer, and began to kiss him. He grabbed his boxer and began to pull them down.
‘Father’ looked… normal. As if he hadn’t spent the last few months in the worst prison in the world. He was wearing his usual black robes, his cane on his right hand, and his long hair as silver and clean as always.
“Hear me out,” he said now whispering and looking around to see if anybody was listening, he inclined a little bit over the table to be closer to his friends, “I’m going to spend
“... be his boyfriend,” Draco’s plant finished the sentence.
“Oh look! People are coming down now,” Pansy pointed at their backs, making both of them turn. A group of Hufflepuffs and Gryffindors were walking down the stairs.
Potter turned to look at him, and he felt the grip in his hand tightening. “It’s not like I’m asking you to marry me. And it’s true anyway, isn’t it? You like me, I like you, we’ve fucked each other multiple times. We’ve been playing around like that for a couple of months now and I really like you Draco. Do you like me back?”
“Stop it!” Draco hissed, grabbing Potter’s hand that was grabbing the dildo, trying to lower it. “You can’t just pull out a dildo in the middle of a hall!”
Professor Sprout had assigned them a terrible homework in Harry’s opinion. They had to take care of a plant that talked…
“Ugh, you’re disgusting Potter,” he complained, but the thought of Harry jerking with his underwear and coating it all with his cum made his soft cock twitch, but thankfully Harry didn’t notice this.
Draco Malfoy, eyes closed, tears running down his flushed cheeks. Hand milking his cock and a dildo fucking him. The best thing about it all is the words leaving his mouth in a moan, ‘Potter’ and oh, fuck, he is coming
. We are boyfriends now, unless you want to chicken out,” he teased.
They began to make their way back again to the castle. Potter at his side, Granger and Longbottom in front of them.
What a
Draco did so, and as the mist enclosed around them he felt the floor turning upside down.
“Oh, Merlin, Draco. You’re so fucking tight,” he said, groaning when his cock was fully in. He grabbed Draco’s hips and pulled out just to push back in hard, making Draco unable to hold a high-pitched moan that escaped his mouth.
for the mirror. It’s rare to see Father smiling, it’s even rarer to see him smiling
He opened the letter and clearly identified Pansy’s handwriting, confusing him even more.
“Draco?!” Potter kept shouting at his back, trying to push the door open.
“Have you ever touched yourself thinking about me, Potter?” Draco asked dangerously. He began to jerk Harry’s cock slowly and torturously.
you, plants are asexual,” Harry eyed Clover with an expression as if asking why the plant hadn’t told him this information before to which the plant just smiled innocently, “but maybe Potter’s plant-”
“I… think that’s enough guys… you don’t need to continue the game if-”
“I didn’t want to give you heels because you are already pretty tall and I wanted you to feel comfortable,” she explained almost in a whisper.
“Can’t I just wear a skirt because my arse looks absolutely gorgeous on it?” Draco said as he walked seductively towards the armchair in which Harry was seated, giving another spin.
When he entered the bathroom with Clover, he left the pot near the entrance door and told Clover not to move, receiving a groan from the plant which made him chuckle.
A hand cupped his jawline and he felt a thumb wiping his cheeks. He turned to look up and he met bright green eyes penetrating his grey ones.
“Sorry,” Harry murmured, trying to pull his pants down, Draco helped him when he saw Harry struggling. His cock also bobbed when freed and was pressed between Draco’s cheeks, drawing a squeak from him.
“Spit it out Peeves,” Pansy said.
While Malfoy was passing by with his cronies laughing at something Zabini had apparently said, Clover had yelled at him how pretty he looked when he smiled.
“What did you- Have you-”
“Let’s turn here,” Potter said, turning to a diagonal path.
“It better not be me,” Ron whispered annoyed, watching the bottle slowly coming to a stop, “poor of the soul that…” He slowly stopped mid-sentence when the bottle stopped and… it was pointing at Harry.
A long silence settled between them again in which Harry was now looking at Draco but Draco was just looking at his lap, not being able to face him.
It’s just so stupid. Everything is stupid. Stupid feelings, stupid Yule Ball, stupid suit, stupid Chang, stupid Diggory…
“You were crying,” Potter noted.
“That’s none of your business,” Draco said coolly. “Shouldn’t you be with Patil?”
Draco turned to the door trying to pull it open. “Get me out of here, Harry!” He began to hyperventilate again and he was sure that at any moment he might faint.
So he thought giving him a
“Is this true mate?” Weasley asked, shocked.
As he sucked his fingers, he stared directly into Potter’s eyes, which looked in a trance looking at his lips around his fingers. He took his fingers out of his mouth with a ‘pop’, a trace of saliva connecting his fingers with his tongue.
They were playing Truth or Dare, seated on the floor in a huge circle around the eight-year common room, the couches were pushed aside for all of them to fit.
He feels so pathetic. He had been crying rather a lot this year, which is stupid, and weak. If his father only knew he had been crying… If he knew the
He definitely couldn’t let Potter know him using his name had any type of effect on him, so he just replied as cool as he could, “Scared, Potter?” But as soon as he finished the sentence, some creature howled. “Did you hear that?”
“MALFOY! IT’S ME! I’M ALIVE! I’M HARRY POTTER! RIDDIKULUS!”
“I guess we are,” Draco affirmed. They spent a while playing with each other’s fingers in silence before Draco broke the silence again, “I’m still horny.”
“Idiot,” Potter said as he felt him approaching him. He couldn’t see anything, his eyes were painfully aching and unconsciously, tears were starting to form. He felt Potter’s big hands cupping his cheeks. “Give me your wand. I need mine to continue casting the shield.” What else was there more to do? It’s not like Draco had too many options.
He turned to face the big mirror on the table and… he was not him anymore. He was somebody else, but yet somehow he still looked like him. It was so confusing.
“Do you?” Harry asked. He grabbed one of Draco’s hands, slightly pulling it up.
He didn’t even try to give a comeback. He had actually never noticed those things.
“I’m fine!” He shouted and grabbed his wand, which had fallen in front of him. He got up and cast Lumos. “Pansy?” he whispered.
He put the hood again over his head and raised his legs and hugged them with his free hand, burying his head between his knees, his previous erection was now fully gone and he knew Potter’s was too.
Draco turned to look around the room when he felt Harry’s hard cock pressing in his cleft. The only thing between Harry’s cock and his arse was the black knickers he had on. His own cock was beginning to get hard. He grabbed the blanket with which Harry had been previously covering his lap and pulled it on top of both of their legs, totally covering Harry’s half-naked legs.
“What the hell?”
Draco’s heart started to pump faster in his chest, he was not sure if it was because of embarrassment or fear or Potter’s closeness or all of the above.
Potter grabbed his arm and turned him.
“Fuck. Faster, Draco,” Harry groaned. His hands quickly traveled towards Draco’s hips and began to guide his movements.
He turns his back and decides he’s not going to look at Malfoy for the rest of the night (he isn’t even sure how he is going to be able to ever look at him again without blushing), but he breaks this promise when he hears a low moan escaping Malfoy’s mouth and unconsciously, he turns and oh, fuck, he’s going to burn in hell.
“I dare you to play ‘Gay Chicken’ with the next boy the bottle lands on,” Ernie said and Harry saw how the dim blush in Malfoy’s cheeks intensified.
“Shut up Pansy,” Draco murmured loudly enough for her to listen.
“Shut up!” hissed Harry to his plant. He could feel the heat on his cheeks indicating he had blushed. His plant gave him a nasty smile and turned back to face at the front.
love you,” Harry said in front of him almost as if he were spitting poison and Draco began to hyperventilate even harder.
He had obviously not realized Potter had entered Slytherin’s common room, or else he would have hexed him like on the train. When he found out Potter was in the room, unfortunately, it was too late, he was already fucking himself and on the edge and he had
With his free arm, Harry placed his hand on his cheek and they both got close to each other, closing the space between them.
He kneeled at his side and slowly wrapped his arms around the smaller man. Draco didn’t do anything to stop him, but Harry felt him shivering more under his touch.
“Would you shut up for once in your life? I don’t give a fuck about the treasure, Pansy and Hermione probably have it already anyway. I might not have meant it — or I could have, I’m really confused right now-”
“You have lasted longer than what I thought you would, I need to give you that,” he teased and then laughed dryly against his ear. “Let’s test how much you can last.”
this was it. This was going to make Malfoy want to quit.
And Malfoy had replied something about how he should teach his plant not lie and that it was already time for him to learn how to shut his plant up, but Harry was furthermore focused on Malfoy’s face, whose cheeks had turned bright pink, it had been that way lately.
Draco placed a hand on his chest and pushed him to make him fall harshly on the bed. He didn’t even give Harry time to get comfortable, he just directly straddled his lap and began to move his hips, causing luscious friction between his arse and Harry’s cock.
“You won’t,” Harry says surely.
“I’m your slut, Harry!” he shouted while jumping, hitting his spot with every thrust. His cock bobbed with his jumps, drops of precome falling on his and Harry’s chest.
He turned to continue walking and Harry had to clear his throat and think for a moment what had just happened. He was sure Malfoy was going to hex him, but he didn’t…
Potter took his underwear out and Draco stared with wide eyes, he was right. His cock was definitely bigger than the dildo.
The night for the eight-year students had been loud and entertaining so far, playing different games, some of them drinking Firewhiskey, some others drinking water or Butterbeer.
He turned to face Potter, who gave him a kind smile, making his heart pump faster in his chest and he returned the gesture back.
He wanted to Disapparate right there but the stupid spells at Hogwarts didn’t allow him to do so, he was dying of embarrassment and sooner or later tears were going to start flooding his eyes. He has never been more embarrassed in his life.
When they split apart Draco looked at him deep in the eyes.
She didn’t have to repeat her order twice since both boys were following her without even looking at each other, too embarrassed to do so. “If you two are not ashamed of being found in intimate actions, I really doubt you would be ashamed of…” Before continuing her sentence she summoned two chairs. They were near the entrance of the Great Hall, the main white stairs being a little further. “Take a seat.”
“No, you’re not.” He pressed him more against the wall and suddenly he was falling backward. Potter wrapped one of his arms around the back of his waist, preventing him from falling to the ground. Draco noticed they were inside of the Room of Requirement now, but it was a room, with a bed. “You're just a slut for
He listened to footsteps approaching and he quickly dried his face with a towel paper, just to quickly turn around and find no other more than Harry Potter.
“Makeup? You only said I should dress as a girl, you said nothing about makeup,” he complained, backing away from his so-called ‘friend’. Since Blaise was not looking at him, he commented nothing.
“Sorry,” he said chuckling.
“I think I’m going to keep you like this,” he said, gripping one of Draco’s cheeks.
“What’s happened?” Draco was
The worst thing about the night is that he really thought it was going to be fun, with his Durmstrang friends and all. That for once he would finally forget about Potter. How naive of him.
Harry slowly slid his free hand through Draco’s arm that was not on Harry’s shoulder. He ran his hand starting up from his upper arm until he reached Draco’s hand, which he grabbed.
Hagrid fumed before ordering them to follow him.
Harry is sure Malfoy is about to do something that will prove his theory. He was sure if he had told Hermione he was going inside the Slytherin’s common room to spy on Malfoy she would have scolded him and told him not to do so. Fortunately, he hadn’t told nor Hermione nor Ron he was doing so.
Potter suddenly grabbed his thighs with both of his hands and harshly pulled him up, forcing him to wrap his legs around Potter’s waist.
“Why would you care?” Harry asked intrigued.
“I think we should take this one,” Draco repeated stubbornly and snatched the lantern from Potter’s hands, freed himself from his grip, and continued walking.
“Potter! Get me out of here!” Draco shouted. He listened to the door slamming at his back.
Draco looked into Potter’s eyes trying to find any hint that told him Potter was messing with him, but he looked serious about it.
Potter stood up helping him to do so.
“Know? We have been doing all we can to get you, two incompetent humans, together, of course we know each other!” claimed Draco’s plant. “You have no idea how tired I’ve been, your homework is to make us shut up but it’s been more this boy who just won’t shut up about you.”
“I’m sorry, Dray,” he heard Potter whispering at his side. “Hermione, please, be kind and bring my cloak.”
“Fine then,” Potter kept walking as the wind became stronger. Draco could feel the sand now hitting his face harshly.
“Yeah,” Draco agreed in a whisper just before falling asleep.
“Enjoyed the show, Potter?” he asks exhausted, turning to look at him and fuck, what is the point of covering himself with the cloak anymore? So he pulls the cloak from him and he looks deep into Malfoy’s flushed cheeks and he is sure he is blushing too. “You know, I could report you to McGonagall. What would she think of the ‘Golden Boy’ spying on other students? How many points do you think that would be from Gryffindor?” the git teases him.
danger… right?
“I told you to leave me alone!” He pointed his wand at an empty vase on a bureau next to the sofa he was in and then aggressively threw it at Harry.
“Please, don’t, Ron. Just- don’t,” Potter said sticking his head out of his hand.
“Great,” Draco replied in the same tone.
Malfoy and his gang slowly turned to look at him. Harry saw a intense blush on his cheeks and Parkinson, Crabbe and Goyle trying to suppress their laughs. “I'd be grateful if your plant stopped looking at my arse, Potter,” he spoke slowly with an air of superiority making Harry blush even harder, if that was possible.
Who was Draco to disobey this order now?
He had never realized that Malfoy’s scent changed throughout the day. Most of the time he smelled like vanilla and cinnamon. After and during lessons those scents still remained in him with some new scents of parchment and ink, and he couldn’t help but wonder how he would smell at night. Perhaps some expensive soap and toothpaste.
“I’m not going to-” Potter started his hand down, from the arch of his back to his arse and squeezed it with his whole palm. “Fuck, fine. I- I want you to fuck me.”
He soon felt he was running out of air so he had to split apart to catch his breath. With a squelching noise and a string of saliva joining their mouths, Harry ended the kiss, breathing hard; he rested his head on Malfoy’s shoulder, still gripping his waist, and licked his lower lip, still being able to taste Draco. He listened to Draco’s fast breathing and knew he had been running out of air as well.
He walks towards the balcony while taking a blow from the blunt and takes a seat on the floor, looking down at all the lights from the city, the bottle of Firewhiskey at his side.
“Come on Malfoy, make this easier for both of us and lose already,” Harry spat when they split apart from the wet and rough kiss they had been previously sharing.
When Harry got down from his orgasm, Draco removed his arm from Harry’s shoulders and slightly stood up from Harry’s lap, letting out a whimper when he pulled out Harry’s now soft cock. He could feel Harry’s spunk dripping down his hole but he was too tired to do something about it so he just placed his knickers back in place and sat again on Harry’s lap, placing the grey blanket on top of them again. He let himself fall on top of Harry’s chest, his head on Harry’s shoulder. They were both breathing hard, trying to recover from their intense orgasms.
When Malfoy gets to the portrait of the entrance of the Slytherin’s common room, he whispers the password and the portrait shouts open, letting him in. Harry quickly follows him and he enters Slytherin’s common room for the second time in his almost six years at Hogwarts.
Of course he was not going to be able to forget about Potter when he was one of the champions.
if he took a seat his lower thighs were going to be uncovered. Something he noticed was that the dress made his hips stand out. Black roman sandals with straps crossing a bit higher than his ankles. His nails and toenails painted in black. This was something he did of his own free will when he had time.
“Hello there Firenze. I see you've met our young Mr. Potter. You alright there Harry?” Hagrid asked calmly- calmly? Didn’t he listen to the cloaked figure thing Draco had described and the dead unicorn? Potter just nodded.
Draco looked up to Potter’s reflection with intrigue and then slightly turned his head to look at him directly.
“Your eyes are puffy and red. Of course you have been crying.”
“Hmm, fine, I’ll give you the privilege of taking me out on a date,” Draco teased again and Harry could feel his sneer against his skin, he chuckled and rolled his eyes in response but decided he was not going to argue with him.
to happen.
He grabbed Harry’s cock, which was already leaking precome from the tip, and aligned it with his hole, pressing Harry’s tip against his tightness.
Harry’s smile widened, seeing as his plan was going great.
Draco raised an eyebrow in defeat.
Draco slowly walked down the stairs looking around for anyone that might be walking by. When he saw the eight-year common room deserted, he quickly walked towards his boyfriend, who raised his sigh from his book to look at him. When he took a full sigh of Draco, his eyes opened wide in shock.
Draco just groaned in protest and said, “You horny prick.” Knowing that sooner or later he was going to give in.
“You’re so pretty,” Harry praised caressing Draco’s cheek which immediately took a pink-ish tone. Draco looked away and took his shoes off and threw them somewhere across the room and pulled his trousers down, revealing inches of white milky thighs and some black boxers.
He only nodded.
“Fine.”
He began directly with a hard pace, not letting Draco get used to his size. He was being really harsh and Draco loved it. Potter was fucking him desperately and ruthlessly. Draco had to grab Harry’s shoulders not to fall due to his harsh movements.
The seventh day, he doesn’t bring Goyle or Crabbe with him, probably not the safest idea he had had, but he has come most of the past week
He does the same thing the day after that, and the day after that one as well, and the rest of the week.
“What in Merlin’s saggy tits are you wearing?” Harry asked calmly, lowering his book to look at him. He had a grey blanket over his legs that reached from his hips to the floor.
The second time, he was resting on his four-poster after a Quidditch training session.
When the class finished he excused himself with Hermione and Ron, telling them that he had to use the bathroom.
“You don’t have to do it if you don’t want to, Harry, we would understand, I mean… it’s Malfoy!” Ernie said sarcastically.
“I said…
covered by some dusty blankets.
“Don’t be rude. Let me sleep if you’re going to be rude, and who the fuck is Sherlock? Are you cheating on me, you adulterous fucker?” Draco murmured and Harry wasn’t completely sure anymore if Draco was fully awake.
“Oh, please don’t shag in front of me!” complained Amare - Draco’s plant - making Draco blush even harder if that was possible. Harry chuckled on Draco’s neck.
Draco’s eyes began to burn, and his sight became blurry. He turned to look away, and quickly and roughly cleaned his eyes.
Draco pointed the lantern at the floor, looking at the…
“Your cock enjoyed the view.” Draco split apart from Harry’s body and bent down again on his chest, and licked again his cum from Harry’s chest, which was beginning to dry in his skin.
“Yeah,” he replied, not wanting to get into them right away, just wanting to enjoy the moment.
“Wha-”
“Please, just kill me,” Draco murmured.
“You know, the one in which I pretend I don’t know who you are and you pretend to be a girl called ‘Dee Black’.”
Potter laughed loudly at his back.
“Do it then,” he whispered.
“You haven’t told him?” Pansy asked, taking a step forward.
Draco slapped him.
He fell on his knees on the floor and began to sob on his hands.
“Don’t act as if you didn’t know! It’s Weasley’s fault that we’re here now.”
Harry smiled at him and stood up, offering him a hand, which Draco took and stood up.
? He looked away as his face turned red.
Tears start to blur his sight. He opens the Firewhiskey bottle and takes a sip. The sour taste reaches his throat when he swallows making his face wrinkle and he feels the tears running down his cheeks. He takes another blow from the blunt.
“You could have walked back again to the safety of the castle.” Oh… Draco hadn’t even thought about that possibility, it just seemed remotely impossible. He felt his cheeks heating again, so he turned to look at Potter’s opposite side, avoiding his sight.
“Consent what?”
“Not by
“AHHH! There Harry!” Draco moaned loudly when Harry hit his prostate.
“Belonging?” he said laughing. “Why don’t you say it, Draco?
The third time his plant made him realize something new about Malfoy was after dinner. This time it was not a question but a comment. ‘
With a screech, Harry knew Draco had come in his pants. The image was enough for Harry to come. Draco was just simply beautiful with his long lashes resting on his cheeks, his messy snow-white hair, his intense red cheeks and his eyes pressed close. Harry came in his pants with a loud moan of the name of the boy straddling him, wetting his underwear with his cum.
“He.”
“What?” he asked, confused. “Pansy, this is not the place, let’s get out of here.” he turned back to try to open the door. “Potter, the door’s locked, try opening- Hey!” Pansy grabbed his shoulder and turned him around abruptly.
Stupid, stupid, stupid Potter.
“You’re welcome, idiots!” Pansy shouted as Draco stood up. She had her arm around Blaise’s shoulders, who carried a grin on his face. “Now kiss. I want to see the results of my hard work.”
After what Harry saw were painful moments to Malfoy, the dildo was finally fully in and Malfoy’s whole body shook as he moaned loudly making Harry’s cock twitch again.
Their bodies were pressed against each other, rubbing their growing erections against the other. One of Potter’s legs was between his, and one of his legs was between Potter’s.
Draco bit his lip, not because he was indecisive of the answer, he knew to perfection the answer, but he felt like a 14-year-old who was about to have his first kiss.
“Oh…” Draco said when he understood, “It’s… nothing… really, it’s fine,” he assured him.
“Be my boyfriend,” he said simply, it was not even a question.
“Dray,” he listened to Potter murmuring and pulling his hand. “We are alone now.”
, that one day the great Harry Potter would actually love me.”
Draco remembered when McGonagall summoned him to his office to ask him what Pansy liked the most. He was really anxious to know what Pansy or Blaise had told McGonagall he liked the most.
Draco pushed the gate open with a horrible sound and they ran upstairs to the porch of the house. The steps creaked as they walked through them.
?” he whispered softly, pulling Draco closer towards him with the grip on his arm.
“Fuck,” Harry groaned.
“Just two straight guys snogging, nothing wrong about that,” Zabini joked, slightly releasing the tension, and a couple of people laughed around him.
“Why was I not invited to this party?!” Oh no. No, no, no, no. The last thing they needed. Peeves. He floated around until he was in front of them. “Oh but if it’s no other than Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy! I was wondering when you were going to make this public! I was tired of seeing you two snog in every corridor!” he
“Dare,” Malfoy replied simply with a smirk.
“Oh fuck!” Draco moaned loudly, not caring anymore who could walk in.
He slowly lowered himself on Harry’s cock drawing a high-pitched moan from the brunette when he felt Draco’s tight hole enclosing the head of his cock. Harry gripped Draco’s hips tightly, trying really hard not to pull him all the way down or to raise his hips and thrust his whole length inside of him at once, not wanting to hurt Draco.
He couldn’t even describe the kiss without making it sound cliché, it was just something they had both been wishing to do for so long. It was needy, in all senses, they needed each other. They split apart lacking air and breathing hard. Harry rested his forehead on Draco’s and for a moment Draco felt his heart doing a flip in his chest.
“Eh…” The ghost flew higher to look at all sides. “Well…”
“Pull your hand and I’ll pull mine,” Potter said. They both tried doing so, but their hands were still locked together.
real you
“Nah, I don’t we will, people should look at this,” Blaise said sarcastically. Potter returned him a killer look. “Anyway, how did you get into
Harry froze in his place, wishing to be able to Disapparate in that exact moment. Everyone turned to look at him and almost every plant was, magically, quiet.
“Draco? Draco! Please get me out of here! I’m stuck! The door won’t open!”
“Enough,” Harry said simply.
“Don’t come any closer Potter, or I’ll hex you!” he warned.
Draco’s eyes narrowed towards him and he knew Draco was trying so hard not to cry.
“What?” he asked, confused. “What does it do? What is it supposed to show you?” He didn’t lower his wand but his hand was shaking more than ever.
“You will stay here until dinner,” she said fiercely, ignoring him and casting another non-verbal spell, Draco felt he couldn’t stand up from the chair anymore, and then she left.
Suddenly, Draco felt a hand grabbing his hood, and when he tried to grab it, it was too late.
They approached the table and saw behind the small boxes their names in a folded paper. Draco opened the paper with his name.
It was almost diner time, soon they were going to be free and Draco would be able to throw himself from the Astronomy Tower.
Without Clover at his side, he was paying even more attention to what Malfoy did. Sometimes Malfoy would look at him back and blush and return his gaze to another side, which Harry found surprisingly cute.
ME DRACO! DON’T LISTEN TO HIM! I’M THE REAL HARRY! HARRY POTTER!
“Ahh! Fuck!” Draco groaned and continued frotting against Harry.
“Now raise your hips. I can’t fuck you with my trousers on,” Harry replied.
He could feel the sand beginning to hurt against his skin as it hit him.
He freed Draco’s hands and Draco placed them on Harry’s shoulders, Harry grabbed his hips instead and resumed his movements, pressing their erections together.
“Have you ever played this before, Potter?” Malfoy whispered against his ear.
“You kinky bastard,” Malfoy whispered, making him chuckle. “You know you need to leave. Blaise will come any minute now.”
Out of the shadows, a hooded figure came crawling across the ground. Draco, Potter and Fang stood transfixed. The cloaked figure reached the unicorn, lowered its head over the wound in the animal’s side, and began to drink its blood.
Slowly, he began to lower himself. When the first inch of what could easily be eight inches was in, he had to stop to sigh. He lowered a little more and he was surprised by Potter’s patience. When his cock was halfway through he freed the grip from it and placed hands on the brunette’s chest, supporting himself from there.
He bit his lower lip avoiding a sob to escape his mouth, his sight began to blur again. He had promised he was not going to cry in front of
“Sounds fair,” he said, getting out from Harry’s hug and sitting on the floor with his arms crossed on his chest.
Draco had the opportunity to continue Potter’s play and he took it. “You wish.”
“Oh look at you! You look so pretty! Just wait until we finish with the makeup,” Pansy said excitedly.
His heart was pumping blood so hard he feared it was the only sound in the room.
name. Couldn’t he come up with something better, perhaps more elaborated?
close.
“HE’S LYING! HE’S A LIAR! I WILL NEVER-”
“Is that a tennis skirt?” Harry asked, his eyes fixed on Draco’s body while he placed the book and the blanket aside on a small table at the side of the armchair.
“Come in our pants? We did,” Harry replied sleepily.
“Let’s test how good you are then,” Malfoy said and raised his hips.
Hesitantly, Draco guided his two fingers to his mouth and when Potter kept staring at him with hungry eyes, he introduced them in his mouth and began to suck them, coating them with saliva. He wouldn’t usually do this, he would usually cast a lubrication spell, but Potter didn’t seem to want him to do so.
Draco opened his mouth giving Harry easy access to it. Harry’s tongue invaded his mouth and their tongues began to swirl around the other. Draco began to give little jumps, which made him run out of breath quickly, making him split apart from their kiss, a string of saliva joining their mouths and he proceeded to lick the length of Potter’s wet mouth.
Malfoy cleared his throat before answering, “We do.”
“I really do not know what’s more stupid from those two options, but we can’t return, we’ll get lost,” Draco concluded.
“Oh, Ravenclaws are coming down now,” Draco heard Pansy say enthusiastically.
“Sounds like a good plan to me,” he whispered, surprising the boy in front of him. Malfoy raised his head and Harry could admire how his cheeks were all flushed.
Theo instantly turned back to his senses and got away from him. Draco was laughing with his other three friends now.
Harry saw how Ron was trying so hard to suppress his laughter and so was Malfoy’s gang.
Words couldn’t even come out of Draco’s mouth. He was fully focused on fucking himself with Potter’s huge cock. “I- fuck.” His eyes were closed and still, he could feel tears filling his eyes. He tried to grab his aching and red cock, to relieve the pain, but Potter stopped him, gripping both of his wrists with only one of his hands.
He instinctively closed his eyes and covered them with his hands. “The shield, Potter!”
“Merlin’s tits, Theo,” Pansy said, recovering from her laugh. “‘
Harry gulped and turned to face Malfoy, who again, had an intense blush on his cheeks.
And oh, Merlin, Godric and Salazar too. Malfoy arches his back and with a high-pitched moan, he comes. He keeps coming and
It felt so weird. He felt like walking on the roof but there was no roof on top of them — which now happened to be under them — it felt like at any moment they were going to fall into the vacuum.
“Pansy? Is that you?! How much of that did you listen to?” Draco asked, alarmed.
Once Harry had hit his spot, he didn’t stop, hitting it every time he thrust in. Draco could already feel his orgasm building up in his lower abdomen. Harry bent and began to suck his neck, leaving what would become hickeys in a couple of minutes.
Harry freed Draco from his hug and gripped his waist instead, slowly massaging it with his thumbs.
Both boys buttoned their trousers quickly while they heard steps approaching them.
like this. No students came by this corridor, but it didn’t mean they were not susceptible to anyone who randomly decided to take this route.
The worst thing is that this year everyone seems so happy, all the time. It’s not like the Triwizard Tournament was not exciting, but it doesn’t mean the competition will help him cope with his emotions. It has probably made them worse. With the pass of years, it’s been getting harder to keep his emotions for himself. He can’t believe how stupid he was, thinking he was going to be able to ask him out.
It was an uncomfortable position, so he placed his arm over Harry’s shoulders again, half-facing him now. Harry pulled him down by his neck into a fervent kiss and then proceeded to raise his hips, thrusting deep into Draco, making him drown a moan against his mouth.
He opens the door of his shared-room and enters, Harry barely manages to get in with him before he closes the door and… locks it.
’ Ridiculous.
In one of Potter’s hard thrusts and Draco’s jumps, his cock pushed against his sweet spot, drawing a loud and high-pitched moan from him. “Fuck! Harry! There, harder!”
“Well then, be my boyfriend.”
. He didn’t want the feeling to stop. It felt like being on a cheering charm and like if nothing could go wrong. Fuck. Harry fucking Potter made him feel this way, and he knows it's wrong, but he doesn’t want it to stop.
Potter didn't lose time. He lowered his grip on Malfoy’s arse and pulled him up, making Draco's feet lift off the floor and wrap his legs around his torso. He directed them to the sink, where he sat Draco.
stop looking now. His pants begin to tighten and he is sure he is about to get an erection for watching bloody Malfoy jerking himself, lord, he
Hogwarts had arranged a treasure hunting for the eight-years, which consisted of walking their way through a labyrinth which led to a ‘haunted’ house, but in Draco’s personal opinion, they were wizards who had gone through war and fucking Voldemort was dead now, so what could possibly scare them now, right?
Harry cast a non-verbal spell and then ordered Draco to raise his hips, and he complied again, uncrossing his arm and instead, supporting his weight on the sofa’s arms.
“Seriously Potter, you’re so oblivious about everything but you
Malfoy raises his hips and lowers his underwear, allowing Harry to appreciate his arse, and Harry had never noticed how… juicy his arse is.
“That means we consent this?…” Malfoy said almost slurring the words dangerously while he moved his hand towards Harry’s chest and slowly slid it through his worked out chest, making deep eye contact with him. Harry gulped. Two could play that game…
Harry felt his orgasm already forming by the heat in his lower abdomen and began to rub against Draco’s leg seeking relief. He couldn’t believe they were actually doing this but there was no way they could stop now.
Potter groaned under his breath and whispered, "Not nice, was it?" It was so low Draco could barely listen to it, but it made him feel stupid about his actions for some reason.
He pressed his hips harder against his and whispered again, “Say it correctly.”
. Harry can’t help but wonder if his father knows about that and he has to suppress a chuckle that immediately dies when Malfoy begins to jerk the dildo with his other hand, coating it with a bright liquid that Harry supposes it’s lube.
, now leave me alone!”
It was so uncomfortable seeing them grabbing hands as if they wanted to rip each other’s hands, seeing one of them sitting on the other’s lap in the common room while studying, seeing them share those chaste kisses that always turned into violent ones, as if trying to rip each other’s lips and tongues. On one occasion Harry had even drawn a drop of blood from Draco’s lips.
As the steps got closer, they heard murmurs everywhere around them. Draco placed his robes covering his crotch, which hadn’t got smaller and was just making his life more difficult, making him wish he was a girl, or gone.
He needed to leave. He had been too long in the bathroom and Pansy would probably be wondering where he was.
“We are not going to have sex in the middle of the common room, where anyone could walk in at any time, Harry James Potter.”
The silence that fell between them was not uncomfortable but it felt eternal. Draco didn’t want to leave. He could just ask Potter to move — because he was behind Draco, preventing him from turning around or leaving — but he didn’t want to. This was the closest Potter had ever been to him. He was trying so hard to avoid his feelings towards Potter but it was so hard to do so when he was just mere centimeters away.
Potter broke the kiss with a squelching noise, a stream of saliva joining their mouths, and began to unbutton Draco’s button-up. When his shirt was open, Draco slightly sat on the bed to take it out and as soon as the fabric freed his skin, Potter pushed him against the mattress again.
at least,” Draco said, smirking.
“It’s about to be,” he said with a smirk.
When Harry makes his way to his apartment he sees Ron’s concern in his eyes. He hasn’t talked to him or Hermione since they broke up. He hasn’t talked to anyone since they broke up.
Potter grabbed one of his thighs near his arse and began to massage it, his other hand stroking his huge cock.
“Go on then, finger yourself.” Draco felt his cheeks heating up. He was not expecting that answer. “It’s not like you haven’t done it before.”
Soon, the hall began to empty leaving only a couple of students walking by and their friends and Peeves with them.
“You OK?”
“We did it!” Potter exclaimed and then turned to suddenly hug him, slightly lifting him from the floor. Draco was shocked and his whole body was tense so he didn’t return the hug. Potter noticed this and slowly split apart from him. “Sorry,” he whispered. “I just got excited-”
When Potter freed his cock, it bobbed between their abdomens until it settled on Draco’s, the red head contrasting with his white skin.
Harry wrapped an arm around his torso and pulled him against his chest, his back now resting against Harry’s chest. The same hand that had wrapped around him traveled under his sweater, raising it up, exposing his nipples. Harry closed his mouth around one of Draco’s pink buttons, drawing a moan he was not able to control from him, the feeling of Harry constantly thrusting against him and his tongue swirling around his nipple being too much to take.
He didn’t even eat breakfast, afraid he might find Potter in the Great Hall and just die of embarrassment right there. But he knew he couldn’t avoid Potter forever, they had lessons together and sooner or later he would have to go to eat and face what he had done.
“You’re a Black? Who are your parents? If you don’t mind me asking,” he added quickly.
“Fine,” Harry replied.
They walked nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest. Their hands never stopped rubbing the other, but none of them seemed to be uncomfortable enough to say something about it.
Harry only chuckled in response. “Are you dilated?” Harry asked.
“Oh, Merlin! What is this?” A girly voice came from their backs interrupting their fight. “I knew it! I told you, Blaise, didn’t I?!”
,” and she made a gesture with both of her hands signaling all Draco. “It’s to be looked at, but not touched,” she said simply, as if she owned Draco.
Harry didn’t lose time, he pulled his fingers out, drawing a whimper from Draco due to the loss of contact and cast more lube in his palm, which he proceeded to rub all over his cock. Draco raised his hips as Harry grabbed his cock and aligned it with Draco’s dilated hole.
"I scared the git," Draco replied proudly with a smirk on his face.
He stared blankly at the bottle and then looked around the room. Everyone who had been laughing, talking, or giggling abruptly stopped, they were all extremely quiet, as if making the lowest noise could kill them. He could feel the tension coming from everyone and he felt tension invading his own body. With all his strength, he turned to look up at Malfoy, who was already looking at him with those piercing grey eyes.
She pretended that everything was fine and she always gave him kind smiles, but he could see right through all that. Her eyes were constantly puffy or red or both and she might not have realized it, but Draco had heard her a couple of times sobbing in her room. He didn’t even imagine how his father must be looking at this precise moment.
“You know he could never love you,” Pansy said looking at him deep into his eyes.
Another time, Harry, Ron and Hermione had taken their plants with them to the lake so they could catch some sun, because Hermione said it was really important for the plants to take the sun occasionally.
When they broke the kiss, Harry grabbed Draco’s oversized sweater by the bottom and began to pull it up. He abruptly stopped when the sweater was about to uncover Draco’s nipples.
Harry found it curious that none of Draco’s former Slytherin friends had said anything, so Harry looked at them and saw Pansy Parkinson trying to suppress her laughter and Blaise Zabini carrying a sarcastic smirk on his face, they were both looking at him.
“It’s me Malfoy! What happen’?!” asked Hagrid while placing his big hands on his shoulders, shaking him to react.
“Sand got in my eyes.” Draco rubbed his knuckles in both of his eye sockets.
Potter grabbed his hand and guided them through the sandstorm. When the sandstorm stopped, he broke the shield and didn’t say a word about what had happened before. Neither did Draco. They just walked at each other’s side without saying a word.
He opened his eyes widely, his brain still processing the fact that Potter had his cheeks cupped with his hands and they were so close Draco had to contain himself to not lean forward to kiss him. He felt his cheeks burning and suddenly the harsh wind returned.
“Make me your bitch,” Draco replied in a whisper.
He felt the back of his knees hitting a bed, he wasn’t sure if it was his or Draco’s bed but he didn’t care.
“You know, I think I’m going to keep it,” Harry said with a smirk. “I was thinking you would, perhaps, like something bigger,” he teased.
Potter’s grip guided him until he was jumping hard over his cock, his own cock bobbing with every jump.
“Boy, if Clover has been hitting on you it’s because he
He had come so far, he couldn’t change of mind right now.
“You two don’t seem to learn,” McGonagall's voice came out of nowhere, making them split apart immediately.
. And suddenly an extreme idea crossed his mind…
“Harry…” began Hermione.
A long silence settled between them in which none of them dared to look at each other.
The kiss quickly intensified and to Harry’s utter shock, Malfoy bit Harry’s lower lip and pulled it. Harry opened his eyes for a couple of seconds to see Malfoy staring deeply into his. Malfoy freed his lip and continued kissing him fervently, he was a good kisser, Harry had to admit. This time Harry was able to identify a vanilla taste on the other boy’s lips and he wondered if Draco used any sort of chapstick because his lips were also really soft.
He realized a couple of things, like how just one lock of his blonde hair would fall in the middle of his forehead when he was frustrated, and he wouldn’t try to fix it; how he placed his hand cupping his chin and jawline when he was bored; how his grip would get tighter on his broom when the opposite team scored a goal and how his eyes shined when Slytherins scored. He wrote with his left hand when he was stressed or in a hurry and with his right one most of the other times. Sometimes his eyes looked sad, when this happened, he usually had dark circles under his eyes. Sometimes, when he thought nobody was looking at him, he would murmur things in french under his breath (probably talking to himself). When he smiled or laughed, wrinkles formed at the side of his eyes; it was a pleasant view.
“I know who you are, everyone knows,” Draco replied in the lowest voice he could manage, getting his voice on a high-pitch again.
He collapsed to the front, his legs not being able to support him anymore. Harry’s hands grabbed him by the waist before wrapping his arms around his shoulders. He buried his face in Harry’s neck, sobbing uncontrollably. One of Harry’s hands grabbed his head, running his fingers through his messy silver hair.
“Grab. My. Hand.”
The thought just made a spasm run through his body, and he was unable to contain the moan that escaped his mouth.
’ The plant had asked him. He had actually never asked himself that question, but surprisingly the answer was yes, Malfoy was almost all the time in his training practices.
“You have been watching me. Good to know I’ve got fans,” he said, his voice taking a cocky tone. “I left Potions quickly because I had to use the restroom, Potter.”
“I’m in,” he said with a sneer, but this time the blush was still there.
When he got to the table he ordered three Firewhiskeys to the bartender and he quickly left to get his order.
heard Potter rubbing his bulge, the idiot was so imprudent and indiscreet.
“POTTER!”
“Now what?” Draco asked.
Overwhelming memories of them sitting there, looking at the stars immediately flood his mind. Memories of Draco drawing him while looking at the stars, because somehow Draco thought he was a better view than the stars.
He had stopped sucking Draco’s skin, just burying his head between Draco’s neck and shoulder instead.
He grabbed Malfoy’s wrists and pulled his hands away from his face and directed his mouth to the pale neck that had also acquired a pink-ish tone. He started giving kisses which quickly turned into licks and then he began to suck, drawing sighs from Draco.
“Are you in?” he managed to ask Malfoy.
Does Draco hate him that much? To the point in which he can’t even bear to look at him anymore?
“We have to go upstairs. The treasure is at the top of the house,” Potter said.
Usually, Draco wouldn't allow this. To be so…
“We have to solve a lot of things, you know that right?” Harry whispered.
Potter walked even closer, making himself a place between Draco’s legs. Draco didn't stop him.
” yelled his plant in a rough voice again.
The state of shock slowly abandoned Malfoy’s eyes but they still remained wide open.
want to be with you. I want to be with you for the rest of my life.” He grabbed Draco’s chin, and since the man didn’t do anything to stop him, he closed the space between them. For the first time in so long, Harry finally felt those soft and comforting lips against his.
“Let’s spin the bottle again,” Harry said, splitting apart from Draco’s body, “but we’re not done here,” he added looking at Malfoy defiantly.
He grabbed Draco’s wand anyway, reasoning that if one of Draco’s wand had worked perfectly before, this one could work perfectly now.
. All this time living without
“Draco!” Please!” Harry shouted as Draco walked away, but he returned.
“You can look at yourself in the mirror now, Dray. Oh, I’m so proud, you look gorgeous. If you didn’t have a dick between your pants I would absolutely date you,” she said smiling, making him blush and roll his eyes.
“If you had wanted to, you’d done it by now.” He stretched out his arm, grabbing Draco’s, he let him. The brunette lowered Draco’s arm and Draco’s whole body began to shake now.
need to know is how you got into this.”
“No, have you?” Harry whispered back.
. The dildo is not moving anymore but it’s still deep buried in his hole, Harry assumes it is pressed against his prostate, milking his orgasm even more. Streams of thick, white cum coating all the way down his cock, some of it spills in his chest and abdomen and it runs down his cock wetting his bed and is the best image Harry has ever seen.
trust you, it’s just… What am I supposed to do? And even if I
“I am
“It’s that- That can’t-” he stuttered until he cleared his throat and began to talk again coolly. “Draco?” was all he managed to say.
“You don’t have the only cock in the world, you know that right?” Draco said, crossing his left arm behind Harry’s shoulders and turning to look down at him. “There will probably be a lot of ‘The Chosen One dildo: Real Life Shape and Size!’ in the future,” Draco mocked as if he were actually promoting a product with his usual sneer.
“I haven’t.” What a stupid lie, of course he had.
He lays on his bed and Harry
“It is when you’re looking that hot and provocative,” he whispered in his ear. Draco could feel his hot breath near his neck making his hairs stand on end.
“Please Draco. You know this is hurting both of us. Give me a chance.”
“Er, I don’t think I will. I think I’ll take them for… recreational uses. Though I have to warn you that they might return a little wet,” he said sarcastically.
“Potter?” Draco greeted him confused because, what could Harry Potter be doing at the Slytherins’ table?
“Didn’t even have a clue,” Harry confessed and closed the space between them in a sweet and tender kiss.
“Remember McGonagall said there might be distractions.”
Now it was Harry’s turn to be shocked.
“Say it. Say you want me balls-deep inside you, filling you better than any other cock you might have had before,” he ordered.
At the end of the day, he was Harry James Potter, the-boy-who-lived, the boy who saw some ‘good’ in Draco, even though there was none. Harry was just trying to help him because that’s how he is, because either way he was dating the Weasley girl.
Draco rested on Harry’s chest, hiding his face in the other boy’s neck. He could feel his thighs and both of their chests sticky with cum.
“Are we close, Nick?” Potter asked.
“You wish,” Draco said with his usual sneer.
A mirror? That was all? It surely couldn’t be
With his free hand, Harry pulled Draco’s chin up and made him look at him. He grabbed Draco’s other hand and intertwined their fingers in both hands.
“Fuck! You could have warned me, idiot,” Draco complained when he felt Harry’s cleansing spell stretching his walls and slickening them with cold lube.
“You will certainly not be ashamed of the whole school looking at you grabbing hands.”
He gripped his stomach and when he stopped laughing he wiped his eyes with his index finger, cleaning the tears in there, his face was red.
Before he knew what he was doing, Harry grabbed Malfoy’s shoulder and harshly turned him around. He grabbed the silver-haired boy by the neck and closed the space between them in a deeper kiss than the chaste one that they had previously shared. Everyone gasped again and he listened at his back Hermione complaining and Ron exclaiming in shock, ‘Oi mate!’
Draco was so embarrassed. Even if he did want to be Potter’s… bitch (which he didn’t), it was still embarrassing to admit it out loud.
“Yes, but everyone knows that your parents are dead, it’s not that big of a thing if you see them as your ‘heart’s desire’. You know nothing about me or my family.” Draco’s voice began to shake and he felt a painful knot in his throat but he was not going to cry. Not in front of Potter.
“I don’t dress to provoke, you arsehole,” Draco hissed back with a sour tone of voice.
, but he was sure he was not going to be able to continue without all this things, without
“Potter, what the hell?! What is this?!”
He quickly found the distinctive silver-haired head and quickly walked towards him.
“That’s because you haven’t managed to train it. They are like pets, Ron,” explained Hermione almost yelling through the noise, holding the pot with her plant, which was one of the few who were not talking, making every student who wanted to talk have to yell so people could hear them.
“Oh look Potter, your friends are coming now,” Pansy whispered.
“Look, we can’t start fighting now. Just close your eyes and follow me,” Potter said, and he pulled one of Draco’s wrists.
“Don’t get so flattered. I was expecting to come with Blaise.”
“Who’s there? Please help me!” Pansy’s voice came from behind the door.
He begins to thrust with his fingers faster, moaning under his breath every time and Harry can’t help but slowly walk closer to him to get a better view of his fingers opening him and he notices Malfoy doing scissors movements to open himself even more.
They stayed like that, looking deep into each other’s eyes without saying a word. Harry could see Draco’s tension in his body. All eyes were on them but nobody talked.
He still has those drawings. The best part of them is that Draco folded them into paper cranes and blew them to him, just like he had had in third year. Draco ripped them when he left. He had to Reparo them.
“We’ll be lucky ter catch anythin’ now, with the racket you two were makin’. Right, we’re changin’ groups — Neville, you stay with me an’ Hermione. Harry, you go with Fang an’ this idiot.”
, the most prideful git of the whole damn Hogwarts owns a
Potter still had his chin gripped. His thumb began to caress against his skin and then it reached his lower lip. He moved his index finger below his chin and with his thumb, he softly pulled his lower lip down until his thumb reached his chin. They were looking deeply at each other the whole time.
A few seconds later, his mother appeared at Father’s side, at his back.
Pansy and Granger, whose clothes looked dirty and their hairs looked messy, especially Granger’s, looking bushier than normally, ran inside the old and scary house giggling.
to look like a girl, or else there’s no point on any of this. Plus, it’s not going to be that much, just a bit of blush, lipstick and eyeliner, your face is already pretty feminine if you ask me,” Pansy said with a grin on her face followed by a chuckle coming from Blaise.
“Let me remind you of our bet, Draco. I quote ‘the loser has to dress as a girl and go to a pub or pay the other two 500 Galleons’. Blaise won, he caught the snitch first,” Pansy said matter-of-factly, making him hate her even more.
Malfoy makes his way to what he supposed are the boys’ rooms and Harry follows.
“Come out as what, Potter?” Draco said, sticking his head out of his knees now and looking at him. He took the flower chain out of their shoulders and threw it to the floor. “We are nothing. We’re not dating.” It was true, they were just snog partners, none of them had… asked the ‘question’.
“I show not your face but your heart’s desire,” he said as he pointed at the inscription on the top of the mirror, making Draco grab his wand tighter.
“Merlin, Potter!” Draco hissed. “You can’t just say things like that out of nowhere.”
When they were finally alone, inside their room, Draco imprisoned him against the door.
“No, not yet. And Draco, these are the wonders of makeup,” she said smiling sarcastically.
When Draco’s hyperventilating decreased, he turned to look at Potter, their faces were
It was getting hard for him to breathe between his hard sobs, but between his blurry sight, he saw the image of his parents slowly fading. He crawled towards the mirror and began to push it with his hands, but nothing happened, the image of his parents was gone, but another figure appeared behind him.
“You feel so tight,” Harry whispered against his ear while thrusting his fingers inside of Draco while Draco moved his hips, expecting Harry’s fingers to push against his prostate. Harry proceeded to nibble Draco’s earlobe, and Draco had to drown a moan on his palm.
“Blood- dead unicorn- cloaked figure- Harry-” he stuttered and soon remembered Potter was alone with the scary cloaked figure. “Potter!”
“Well, you didn’t expect me to wear pants under a skirt, did you? It would show under the skirt,” Draco replied defensively.
His cock was aching painfully, still trapped in the knickers, it was already leaking precome, he could feel a little stain on the lace fabric. When he was about to pull out his cock from the knickers with his free hand, Harry wrapped his hand around Draco’s wrist and pinned his hand on the couch’s arm.
“Why are you mad at me? It was not my fault. Do I need to remind you who was about to take my prick out in the middle of a hall?”
Draco really tried to stop himself from slapping him, but he was unsuccessful.
Draco began to give bigger jumps which soon synchronized with Harry’s thrust, making both of them a mess of moans that they tried to choke against their palms.
give in then!” Hermione said.
Harry could feel his stupid sneer against his cheek even though their faces were not touching… yet. Their bodies were extremely close and Harry could feel Draco’s warm skin a couple of centimeters away from his.
about that Potter boy you fancy so much,” said Malfoy’s plant sounding desperate. Harry’s hearts began to bump faster in his chest. “If you are not going to trust me then why do you ask me for advice?”
“I know what will make him lose…” he said with a victorious smile.
“For whenever you’re ready, I want to start with this one,” he said, splitting their foreheads and guiding Draco's arm towards his mouth. He kissed Draco's worn out mark.
She continued walking, shaking her head and they walked to the closed doors of the Great Hall.
Harry had gotten a painful amount of uncountable boners that week and he had seen and felt a couple of Malfoy’s boners pressing against his crotch while they snogged in an empty hall and he rocked his hips against Harry’s.
“Brilliant,” Harry said sarcastically
“Oh, please. You're talking as if I hadn't fuck you and filled you with my cum. You would still be dripping my spunk if you hadn't cleaned yourself.”
“I think we are going through the right path,” he claimed. Their bodies were really close.
“No,” they both interrupted Ernie and turned to look at him. “He needs to lose,” they said at the same time.
“Draco? Are you fine?” Potter asked preoccupied.
Harry ignored them and stood up anyway, walking towards the Slytherin table. He was
Suddenly, Draco stopped feeling the wind and sand against his skin. He opened his eyes, stupidly forgetting about the sand in his eyes.
Inevitably, Draco wrapped his arms around Potter’s neck and pulled him down, closing the space between them.
Since then he started to pay more attention to small things Malfoy did.
,” he said now gripping Draco's arse with both of his hand, his big palms massaging his cheeks and Draco sighed under the touch.
He realized it was a terrible idea when he remembered how he was dressed. He tried to lower the dress as hungry eyes followed him coming from men and occasionally women and he felt uncomfortable.
“Professor-” began to say Potter.
“You’re so tight- Ngh,” Harry murmured incoherently.
“I swear Potter, if we get caught I’ll make sure this becomes your last shag,” Draco threatened.
“Oh lord,” Draco murmured. He turned to look back to the front and covered his head with the hood of his robes and buried his face in his arm.
Suddenly, a reflection of his father appeared in the mirror at his back and he quickly turned to look back but his father was not there.
Draco was seated on the toilet seat in a fetal position, his arms crossed on top of his knees, and his head hidden inside his arms. His plant was on top of the toilet tank.
Harry’s heart was pumping hard in his chest, but this was it, he was going to win.
A few moments later he pulled his head out and stared at the beautiful man in front of him. He helped Draco take his sweater off and quickly unbuttoned his trousers.
He crossed his arms on his chest and his eyes locked with Harry’s. That happened a lot during their lessons and almost at any and every moment.
“I asked you first, Potter,” Draco replied.
“It’s his fault, not mine. It’s
that.
“You called Hagrid and came back,” Potter noted, looking at him. Draco turned to look at him as well, Potter’s green eyes shining with the light of the lantern.
Potter slid nicely through the floor until his back hit the wall opposite to the one they were in.
“Couldn’t let the Golden Boy die, could I?” Draco murmured.
slut, you arsehole,” he hissed.
Draco looked at him with deep, red and burning eyes, expecting an answer. But was he ready to commit?
“Black. Dee Black,” he said.
“Yes, but you do nothing to stop it because you like it,” the rough voice said.
“Why were you crying?” Potter asked, looking at Draco’s reflection on the mirror. Draco was looking at Potter through his reflection as well.
Ron and Hermione slowly stopped laughing when they heard the seriousness Harry was talking with.
“Yeah? There’s always a first time for everything. This will be your first time losing,” Harry replied.
“Really, how many long-silver-haired, white, skinny, pointy-faced gits with a Death Eater mark that are not in Azkaban or dead do you think exist?” He turned to look at him and stood up from his seat, walking closer towards Draco. “Now, care to explain what you are doing in that slutty dress?” he whispered when he was close enough.
close to him, but it was probably just to see better the path, since Draco was holding the lantern. Their hands were slightly brushing each other due to their proximity.
“I didn’t take the person I wanted to take,” Potter confessed.
Draco let out a hard and sarcastic laugh before replying, “Yeah, really funny. Should I just go and tell him ‘Hey Potter, I really like you and would love to snog you. I hate to see you with that Chang girl because
He sat in one of the high chairs in front of the bar table and looked around the pub and he froze when he saw Harry Potter walking towards the bar table. He wanted to Disapparate right there but he couldn’t even move, nor could he think.
Harry rolled his eyes and climbed to the bed, imprisoning Malfoy’s body under his. He was sure he had stained his robes with Malfoy’s cum but he couldn’t care less. He grabbed Malfoy’s jawline and pulled their lips together. Malfoy opened his mouth in a moan and he took advantage to get his tongue inside, both of their tongues twirling around the other.
“Uh… nevermind.” Harry placed his arm around Draco’s shoulders bringing him closer. The crowd long forgotten by the group of former Gryffindors and Slytherins.
He stops suddenly and Harry is afraid he detected him just like he had had on the train but he just pulls his fingers out of him and Harry thinks that’s the best sound he has ever heard. He could

“Malfoy?” Potter shouted at his back behind the door.
someone is there, so he just turns to look to the window, waiting for Malfoy to put his pajamas on; but he doesn’t.
“Fuck, you’re so tight.” He began to move the digit slowly, a pace that rapidly became faster and a few minutes later he inserted a second finger, stretching Draco wide doing scissoring movements.
“That’s easy for you to say because you’ve got a nice plant,” Ron whispered trying to not get heard by his plant.
He got close to Harry’s face and gave him a kiss, allowing him to taste Draco when he introduced his tongue in Draco’s mouth.
Potter’s lips were rough, yet he moved them so gently against his, and unconsciously, Draco opened his mouth, allowing the other boy’s tongue to explore his insides. It was agile and soon their tongues began a war seeking dominance.
“Fuck. No shit Sherlock,” Harry hissed sarcastically and tightened his grip on Draco’s waist.
“I do, and I always win.”
He always tried to keep his feelings for himself, but sometimes it was just too much. Sometimes he would feel so overwhelmed by his stupid feelings that he would start hyperventilating. He was trying so hard not to think about it so it wouldn’t happen right now, but fuck, how do you get someone out of your mind?
“You’re not having a good time, are you?” Potter asked suddenly, pulling him out of his tangled thoughts.
what he had been expecting for a Halloween Treasure Hunt. But there he was, with Harry bloody Potter, in the middle of a labyrinth, trying to find their way to the house.
He covered the mirror with the blankets for what he promised was going to be the last time and walked out of the room making his way to the bathrooms.
I love you.”
“You have privileges when you are Harry Potter,” he said, walking away from between Draco’s legs. He made his way to a corridor Draco knew to be the bathrooms. He obviously got the message and followed him.
I was, I forgave you every time, thinking…
“Obviously no, Potter. My life doesn’t revolve around fingering and your cock,” Draco said, rolling his eyes again.
“No, it isn’t!”
“Draco! Please! Let’s start again! I miss you!” Harry’s voice breaks.
He handed Potter his wand and he listened to him casting some sort of cleansing spell, and suddenly his eyes were not aching anymore.
“Yes,” Draco replied.
“I thought it was pretty obvious honestly. How many people who have silver hair do you know?” Draco said calmly.
Every eight-year student already knew about their weird ‘relationship’ and naturally, the whole school soon knew about them too.
“I’m ready Harry, please, I need you,” Draco begged, slightly splitting his hand off from his mouth.
Harry took out his wand and as quietly as he could, he cast ‘Alohomora’. The door unlocked and he slowly entered the cubicle.
“I’m trying!”
Pathetic. That’s what he is.
Draco slightly pushed Potter’s chest so he would split apart from his chest. Draco began to unbutton his shirt and Potter took it out. Potter unbuttoned both of their trousers and he stood up from the bed and pulled his down and then quickly pulled Draco’s down as well, freeing his white, long legs.
“I- I would rather not answer that,” he said.
, how could he cry in front of
is Draco,” she whispered through the table.
“How do you play this?” he asked almost in a whisper without taking his eyes away from Draco’s, and he felt his cheeks heating up.
much bigger.
Draco giggled under his breath and wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck, closing the distance between them. Their lips collided together into a sweet and deep kiss. Draco’s lips were soft and they tasted like sweet spearmint. Draco slightly opened his mouth, allowing him to explore his insides, tongues fighting for dominance. His taste was intoxicating in Harry’s mouth, he wanted more of Draco and it felt like minutes before they were forced to split apart to breathe.
“Yes, you’re right, but you look prettier without something covering those pretty, milky legs of yours.” Harry’s right hand slid lower through his legs, slightly bending Draco until his hand reached Draco’s calf. “Up,” he ordered and Draco instantly understood when Harry tried to pull his leg up.
? Do you want
He slowed down, expecting Potter to take the lead.
Potter had Draco against the wall and was kissing him fiercely. Their tongues tangling and fighting for dominance in a rough kiss. Not even when kissing would they stop fighting.
Draco’s bracelet was made of black lava beads, with only one white one. Harry’s was the opposite. All white lava beads with one black.
A week had gone by since Harry and Draco wouldn’t give up on their game and Harry was starting to get frustrated. The whole week had been them pushing each other against walls of empty halls, with touching and snogging sessions and in one of those sessions, Malfoy had begun to rock his hips against Harry’s and by Merlin’s tits… Malfoy had caused him an erection that painfully remained trapped in his pants until he finally took a cold shower at night.
Malfoy’s cock is now out of his underwear and he’s jerking himself dry. Harry notices his cock is smaller than his but not by much and he
Another week went by in which both trios were forced to spend time around each other everywhere because the brunette boy and the silver-haired boy
Another silence, this time longer one, set between them in which they stared at each other without saying anything, their faces mere centimeters apart.
“Grab my hand,” Potter ordered.
“Well, what were you expecting? Hot chocolate and some muffins?”
. The
Draco wasn’t sure how he had expected this night to end, but if somebody would have told him a week ago he was going to end up kissing no other more than Harry Potter and that he would find out his worst fear was losing Harry, he would have laughed in their face and then proceed to go and tell Pansy about it.
If Blaise had been drinking something, Draco was sure he would had spit it out. His eyes widened and even though he didn’t want to show any expression, his surprise inevitably showed in his face.
“Wait, you know each other?” Harry asked, looking at Draco’s plant in front of him.
“That wasn’t you either. The one who told me he loved me. It was just your hero complement,” Draco murmured annoyed.
He throws some Floo Powder into the fire while murmuring Draco’s address and the fire instantly becomes green. He gets down on his knees and buries his head in the fire.
“He hates you, Draco. He hates being with you right now-” she whispered.
“I- I forgot I still had it.” He looks at it indecisive but suddenly he grabs it and pulls it. He breaks it. The black beads fall on the floor, echoing in all the room. Harry can feel his heart aching now. “Leave me alone Harry.” His voice came out shakily, and Harry is sure he is holding tears.
” yelled Ron’s plant, who had been previously loudly conversing with Harry’s.
“Can you feel it now, Draco?” Potter asked teasingly. Oh, the bastard. “Tell me how good my prick is filling you.”
He swipes his face with his hand, dampening both of his cheeks now, and he begins to sob.
He split apart from the kiss and began to give little jumps that sent shivers through Harry’s body. Soon he began to jump faster and higher, the sound of his arse smacking against Harry’s thighs echoed in the whole room along with both of their hard breaths and moans. Harry began to raise his hips in unison with Draco’s jumps.
“What’s that?” Harry asked in a whisper so only Ron and Hermione who were together at his right side would listen, while Malfoy spun the bottle again.
“Do you want to…” he said awkwardly, giving space for Draco to get inside the room.
“What?”
Harry grabbed Malfoy’s hips tighter and pressed him more against the door, rocking their hips together. He no longer cared if Malfoy could feel his erection or not, he was in a desperate need of relief and he knew Malfoy needed relief as well when he broke the kiss and moaned loudly and high-pitched when Harry harshly rocked their hips together.
“Draco…” Harry whispered against his ear. “Wake up.”
He throws the blunt to the floor and steps on it. He walks towards the fireplace with the bottle of Firewhiskey in his hand.
Harry imprisoned him against the table and he placed his hand at the back, on top of the table. He apparently had touched the pumpkin because suddenly they were spinning around and Harry’s weight fell on top of him.
Draco appears walking lazily towards the fire and looks unsurprised when he sees Harry. “What do you think you are doing?” he hissed, sounding pissed.
Draco placed his hands on Harry’s shoulders and lower himself painfully slow, inch by inch, until he was finally seated on Harry’s cock.
tried to hold his tears, but he knew he failed when he felt the first trace of hot and wet drops running down his cheeks, who were previously covered with dried tears.
“Potter!” he said surprised under his breath. “How much of that did you listen to?” he asked alarmed now standing up facing Harry. Probably not his best idea since the cubicle was really small and they were both closely facing each other now.
“Are we going to find boggarts, Nick?” Potter asked.
two years
Peeves didn’t say anything and just left. A couple of minutes later of listening to murmurs and feeling people pointing at them Peeves returned.
“Cast a cleaning spell,” Draco murmured.
“What did you do with my lips?” he whispered.
Potter grabbed his arm and forced him to pull his fingers out. He complained in a moan due to the emptiness.
“How could he love a racist bitch like you?” Pansy’s grip on his shoulder got painfully tighter.
“Touch.”
“Chickened out already, Potter? I guess I win,” he said teasingly and turned his back.
“My sexual life is
“It’s hard not to when a boggart is shouting about your little ‘secret’,” he teased again.
“Don’t you want to see me fucking myself with my fingers? You love to watch me don’t you?”
“You’re wearing knickers,” he noted.
“Says the boy who just licked his own cum.”
“Draco, just cast Riddikulus! She’s probably a boggart!”
Potter groaned in his ear while still rocking his hips, making Draco’s cock grow fully hard now, the bulge clearly noticeable and standing out from the silk dress.
Harry chuckled before replying, “Yeah me too.”
Harry just chuckled in response. He pulled his cock out with a squelching sound and began to lower himself on the bed until he was finally resting comfortably with his head resting on a pillow. Draco was still straddling him but lazily, his body relaxed on top of Harry’s. They were in the same position they had been previously sleeping in. He grabbed Draco’s wand again and cast a cleansing spell on both of them and then pulled a blanket over their naked bodies.
“What happened, Amare?” asked Harry’s plant from across the quiet bathroom making both of them chuckle.
“Ugh, just- finish with this quickly. The faster we leave, the faster this night will end,” he said, taking a seat in the chair in front of Pansy’s boudoir.
"What happened? With you and Neville?" Potter asked suddenly.
“You’ve got to be kidding, right? That definitely didn’t happen and you’re just playing us a really bad joke,” Ron said, still laughing.
Draco bit his lip trying to make a decision.
He didn’t mean to hurt him. He loved him. He
Harry was gripping Draco’s hips so hard now that he was sure it was going to leave marks tomorrow.
He began faster and harder jumps, their skins smacking being the loudest sound in the room. Potter lowered him so hard his cheeks were probably starting to get red every time his cheeks hit Potter’s thighs in every thrust.
Draco released his grip on Potter’s hips and moved his hands towards the button of Potter’s trousers and then unzipped it, putting his hand inside of Potter’s crotch. He grabbed Potter’s erection, trapped in his underwear, and began to stroke it. “Fuck,” Potter groaned under his breath.
He made his way downwards and took Harry’s shoes off and also threw them somewhere around the room. He unbuttoned Harry’s pants, looking up at him, Harry raised his hips and allowed him to slide his pants out, throwing them with their shoes and the rest of their clothes across the room. Harry took off his shirt and also threw it to the floor.
“Mother?” he asked confused. She looked… happy? How? She had looked so worried after the Dark Lord had set him his mission and now she was looking… happy?
,” he says as he grabs the sticky dildo between Malfoy’s thighs and he watches his face glowing even redder, something Harry thought was impossible.
Potter took another step to examine the dead body of the unicorn. Draco grabbed his hand to stop him and murmured, “Potter." A slithering sound made both of them freeze.
This was
He quickly unbuttoned his pants and then grabbed Draco’s thighs again, this time starting his touch up and sliding his hands down the dress. Potter looked surprised when he kept sliding his hand just finding smooth skin until he reached a thin strap of fabric.
“Fine.” Harry stood up and began to walk.
“Can I look now?” Blaise said, trying to hide his desperation under a cool voice.
Ron laughed in a loud snort and Gillywater squirted out of his nose.
He continued looking at himself. Pansy had done some contour (he knew it was called that because sometimes Pansy talked to him about how good he would look with makeup and she was not wrong) making his already slim face highlight more his already pointy features. He still looked like him… but different. He didn’t exactly know how to describe it more than fucking gorgeous.
Draco, or simply just
“I don’t! Why would I fancy a plant hitting on me?” Malfoy whispered. Harry was walking slowly and carefully not to make any sound towards the cubicle from which the voices were coming from to listen better.
“None of your business Blaise,” Draco replied sourly.
Between the murmurs, he could make out a couple of ‘Who’s the other boy’, ‘Is that Harry Potter?’ and ‘Why are they there?’
He immediately relaxed against the mattress, the orgasm had drained all his energy. He felt Draco falling on top of his chest and hiding his face on the crook of Harry’s neck.
Draco complained in a whimper, but he didn’t have enough time to protest because seconds later Harry thrust hard against his prostate and he had to bite Harry’s forearm to stop himself from screaming due to the overwhelming feeling.
“Well, you might have been a muggle, I bet there are thousands of muggle girls with silver hair,” Theo tried to excuse himself.
“You’re hard,” Draco murmured and moved his leg to press harder against Harry’s bulge, definitely intentionally.
“No you’re not,” Potter whispered more for himself while chuckling not so discreetly. “You know, I didn’t really order ten minutes ago. The bartender just doesn’t want to give you your order,” he said, confusing Draco due to the sudden change of topic. “But if I tell you why, I'll ruin our little lying game.” Draco, apart from being confused, was scared now.
“You’re going to fuck yourself with my cock, pretty” The brunette settled across the bed. “Straddle me Draco.” Draco did so.
Potter grabbed his wand from the floor and cast a lubrication spell on his hand and then left it on the floor again. He jerked his cock, coating it with lube. Draco grabbed his thick cock and slightly stood up, lining himself up with Potter’s cock, pressing the head on his hole without introducing it.
“You’re such a slut,” he said, with a grin on his face.
Draco’s heart was pumping so fast and he was feeling so many emotions he didn't know he was capable of feeling at the same time.
Hagrid came running and asked alarmed, “What happen’? Is anyone hur’?”
two weeks ago, he would have laughed in their face. There was no way he could have guessed how this dare was going to end, but from all the possibilities he had in mind, this was not one of them, but he was definitely happy with their resolution.
Potter took a place at his side and gave the bartender his order without even noticing him, which made him relax more, but it didn’t last long.
He grabbed Draco’s waist and pulled him close to his body hesitantly looking into his eyes, greens losing into silvers.
Just as he finished the sentence, they heard a deep scream. Draco was sure that it came from either Seamus Finnigan or Dean Thomas.
“What are you doing?” he asked nervously.
“I’m sorry, Draco. Please forgive me. I
All rational thought abandoned Draco while he continued jumping on Harry’s cock, trying to hit that spot again.
Harry freed his grip on Draco’s jaw and Draco began to jump fast again. With one more thrust against his prostate and a high-pitched whimper, he finally found relief. His cock twitched as streams of white and sticky cum coated his but mostly Harry’s chest. Harry’s cock is pressed against his prostate milking his orgasm just like he always does when he is fucking himself with his dildo. His hole clenched violently around Harry’s cock.
“I just want to let you know,” he began to say dangerously, “somebody’s going to lose, and it’s not going to be me,” he said looking deep into Harry’s eyes.
With one last thrust against his sweet spot from Harry and a loud, high-pitched moan from Draco, he had the most intense orgasm he had had in
He couldn’t leave things like this.
“It used to be Voldemort. I used to think there was nothing more terrifying than him before I saw Hagrid carrying your motionless ‘dead’ body,” Draco confessed in a whisper.
“Please fuck me.”
They continued walking upstairs until they reached a room full of doors. Each door had two names.
Harry wrapped his arms around Draco’s waist. It felt cozy and warm because of Draco’s oversized grey sweater and it was easy to hug him because he was really thin.
“I beg your pardon?” Malfoy said, still shocked.
“It’s extremely dark in here and you’re probably starting to see things, Potter.”
Malfoy grabs something out of the lower drawer and apparently is deep inside since he almost has all his arm inside it. Harry is sure he is about to get another cursed object but he is not able to see what it is because Malfoy throws it to the bed and covers it with a pillow, but it’s weird that he grabs it with his bare hand.
