Draco opened the door and took one look at me before he led me up towards his apartment.
dr Klein looks at me with pity in his blue eyes, "I'm sorry to tell you, but yes, you can get pregnant by having sex just once, If you're having sex without protection, you risk becoming pregnant." He looks stern again.
The following morning, I decide the best way to handle Malfoy  is to talk to him head-on. I send a message to Ginny, letting her know I won't be in the office that morning due to a Doctor's visit. Then I head straight to the peacock .
i should've seen it coming.
Draco's at work until 6 tonight, its unbelievable that he has to work on Christmas eve, he's the head auror so If something happens he has to be there.
"As for your first question, it's too early to tell. Right now the baby is the size of a raspberry. As the baby develops we'll be able to do more."
"You OK?" he asks.
he leads me upstairs towards his apartment, once I get threw the door I turn around to face him, not quite meeting his eyes.

1998'
'I think you should go.'
I think there will only be about 10-12 chapters left depending on how long they are.
'well remember Draco my assistant?'
Cedric sits beside me. "She has been taking the medicine, I've been making sure of it."
"Oh!" I blush. "No - well-" Oh Merlin. 'Cedric - my boyfriend and I have been talking about maybe, you know, trying for kids, but we haven't had great news and told that we had a really low change of it actually happening.' i manage to stutter out.
"We do have some questions though," Cedric adds. He leans forward, shooting me a sly smirk. "Haley, has been wondering how the baby, er, empties its bowls."
'are there anymore', I ask while he brings up more with varing colour themes.
and we lived happily ever after.
He releases my arm, it still feels warm from his touch. I need to get out of here. "Well, thanks," I say again. Draco looks amused at my clearly flustered state. Embarrassed, I move back towards the stairs, Draco following close behind.
let go."
Only three more weeks and we can tell people.
sorry but you'll find out who's baby it is in the next chapter i'm not sure when that will be as we have loads of exams to do but i'll try and upload it in a few days!
(See the end of the chapter for
my head was pounding i guess that's what i get for being a lightweight and drinking half my body weight in alcohol.
"We did do something." I pat my stomach and Cedric laughs.
'hypothetically' I rudely interrupt, not wanting to face the music and realise that there is a fair chance that the baby could be his,
(See the end of the chapter for
When they had got there the rest of the day was spent unpacking their essentials and the things that  would be needed first and building furniture in both of their bedrooms.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
It wasn't
'fine' was all harry could say before they kissed
I've decided the ending but I'm not sure who's baby it's going to be.
"It's Draco," is his calm reply, "You might as well call me by my name."
Just like that, everything clicks. Hermione's party was held at the peacock at barlow. Draco must be, must be — shit, shit, shit, fuck.
I mumble a response, which causes him to lead me over to the sofa. I sit down while he walkes towards the kitchen to make some tea, I guess. A few minutes later he comes to sit beside me bringing a tray with two cups of tea on it with him.
This part of the bar is eerily empty.  The long hallway im standing in is dim. Malfoy closes the door and turns right, up a steep set of curved stairs. I follow him, discovering that I am more out of shape than I thought and wondering how I'm supposed to climb these stairs while heavily pregnant.
ohh right cedric. my boyfriend of 5 years whom i know live with (am i using that right or is it who?) i mean there isn't anything wrong with looking at dashingly hot men right. it's not like i'm going to do anything.
"You may have a point."
my parents make me come every year no matter how much I protest as 'you have to keep up appearances harry no matter how much you hate it'
'yeah'
Malfoy nods his head. "Good. I have a friend that is a Doctor. if you need anything for the baby, let me know."
"What's up?" His voice is thick with sleep.
we sat down as he pulled out the medical records
when we arrive at the now familiar door, he holds it open and waits for me to walk through, instantly I sit down on the sofa while he sits on the armchair.
'i'm sure you did'
'she's pregnant she shouldn't be doing things like that.'
"Haley,' Klein looks concerned. "Lie down a minute."

'you know im a perfectionist, its just not what i'm used to... will you come and help me'
Anyway I think this should be finished around March- April time but it depends on how school is because I'm taking my mocks later this year and I have my GCSE's next year.
'to cedric,
I hesitate. "Alright." I take a deep breath. "So, she's married and pregnant..."
I drop my glasses onto the side table and rub tiredly at my eyes. I can hear our bed calling me. My bones ache and I am so very done for the day.
"Mhm," is the best I can do in response. I have a sudden image of me, walking up those stairs with a cranky toddler in tow. I throw an arm over my eyes, nope. That is a horrifying image. No child is going to want to climb those stairs.
a frown begins to form between his eyes and I sigh inwardly.
'well, ok if you're sure.' she still had that concerned look on her face. "You've seemed pretty out of it for a couple of days now."
'no I can't find out until I'm 18 weeks.'
There's only a week left until I can find out who the father is, I find out if my mind can be put at ease or my life will change. I know what I have to do but I'm not happy about it .
Usually i didn't drink so i would be teased about being a lightweight tomorrow but there was a pleasant buzz i was getting from the alcohol.
(See the end of the chapter for
the next time we saw each other at their engagement party he pulled me into a corner and said the strangest thing to me
they then started to whisper to each other. Annoyingly they had made it so we couldn't listen to what they were saying.
'Haley answer the next question honestly... are you saying you cheated on me and the baby might not be mine!'
i'm so sorry for what happened and how people seemed to forget, i'll never forget how you saved my life. You sound like a good guy for saving Harry!
~~~~~~~~
I drive home, hitting about as much traffic as i possibly can. when i get in i ditch my coat throwing it messily on the sofa. Cedric is going to have a fit when he sees it.
~~~~~~~~
Cedric's Pov
we went and asked the house elves to put some up around the castle politely even though they didn't have to as they weren't tied down to hogwarts and the students in it they did.
i can't really remember leaving, but to be honest i can't really remember much of last night.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
when his shoulder brushed up against mine, immediately he turned to look at me.
I pause to quickly poke my head into the bar area. There's a small crew of people working diligently, re-setting tables and chairs.
'i-, is... wait-... your pregnant' he eventually stutted out his voice reaching abnormal heights
thank you for reading
'clearly' draco muttered under his breath.
I like the sound of that.
I nod my head and take his offered hand as he walks me down the stairs ready to catch me if I fall.
I turned to Draco,'I love this but its way too out of our price range',
I feel him take me into his arms, wrapping them around my torso and resting his chin on top of my head while I break down.
'do you love her'
"Silly." He flicks my ear. "I'll go get it."
'what?' he asked clearly he knew what I was trying to say. After my lack of response he asked me again.
Kissing over my stomach (a lot of kisses there, warming my heart), he comes to stop teasingly at my crotch. I let out a low whine and Cedric nips at my thighs in response. My legs fall open and Cedric settles between them with ease and before I know i lose all track of my thoughts.
I shuffle into the doctors room, excuses ready on my lips.
Malfoy shrugs. "Thanks."
Almost like it was planned.
'anything else,'
"We can't wait." I lace my fingers with Cedric's, bringing his knuckles to my lips. He grins at me.
he looks at me confused but complies. i take the bears out of my coat pocket and place them on his now outstretched hands.
"We're gonna be the best parents ever."
once I had finally got to sleep around 4, my head was buzzing with what if's but I put them at the back of my head as they we're future me's problem.
He's smirking at me. "Malfoy, Draco Malfoy," he says. (A/n sorry i had to do it )
"I need to lock up after you go," he explains. Right, that makes sense. I hurry down the stairs, forgetting how awful they are.
'we've got the doctors again today'
it's my birthday today✨
i had to go and see him.
'if im spending christmas over here we need to change that.'
"But it tastes so nasty, it tastes of Banana" I complain and take another small bite of eggs. "These are gorgeous by the way."
(A/N if you can read this then we'll done if not it's just what happened in the story!)
It was a thing I would regret instantly but I did it anyway. I felt bad for kicking her out I was just so mad with what we did. Our whole relationship gone.
'do you want to help me' in a quiet questioning tone,
Once she was in bed I went into my wardrobe took out some sweatpants to sleep in and left.
'what's so special about the bauble?' draco asked harry and teddy with genuine curiosity.
The wind seems to go out of her sails, and she sits down wearily. I offer her my most professional attitude, flash her my most charming smile.
Klein smiles kindly at me. "The next step is a visit with the midwife and setting up antenatal visits."
It has been 5 minutes
(See the end of the chapter for
I'm sorry this took so long to get out but happy new yearrr!
I arrived at the hospital without a minute to spare and once I had made my way to the reception the doctor was ready.
*no ones pov*
An hour or so later...
*2 am*
and we got to talking
so I've come up with a manageable schedule and I've decided I will upload twice a week maybe more if I have the motivation, but I will be uploading Christmas drarry one shots in December!
I arrive at the pub with twenty minutes to spare on Saturday. This time, seeing Draco doesn't quite put the fear of Merlin in me, which is an improvement. The bar, of course, is closed, so I head to the employees only entrance.
I forgot about him.
Once I've calmed down the tea is cold, Draco obviously in shock mumbles something about making some more and heds off to the kitchen again.
Fair enough
In the next chapter well find out Cedric's reaction and what it means for Haley and Draco!
So myself and pansy decided to take it into our own hands.
At this, I feel my face drain of colour. Birth. Birth. I have not given a single thought about that aspect of pregnancy. Eventually, the baby is going to have to come out .
"She made a mistake - she slept with someone else and now she's not sure who the father is. On top of that, the other man wants to know if he's the dad so he can be involved with the baby. I'm just not sure what kind of advice to give her."
"How soon can you tell who the father is?" I ask. "It has to be Cedric, right?" My mouth is very dry right now. "You can't get pregnant by having sex one time."
~~~~~~~~~
'hello,'i say disgruntled. 'this isn't necessary, i just have an overprotective boyfriend.'
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry's pov
sweet merlin, he was looking at me, instantly i felt a blush spread across my cheeks. Standing here, my cosy life with Cedric felt a million miles away. there were no words were needed. he moved towards me, with a determined pace, i saw his eyes turn black with desire.
'ta-da' i say hardly containing my excitement 'open your eyes!'
I watch him leave and I only breathe out when the door slams closed. That was — too much. I want to go home. I want to go to bed and stay there until the baby is born.
"Haley!" Cedric beams at me. He's sitting relaxed in a garden chair a bottle of red wine open on the table. He rises to greet me.
once it was open he took off the lid, glancing at me before looking to see what was inside of the box
Cedric's desperate to break the news to his father and it's the cutest thing to watch. Every morning he picks up the bears on the dresser and excitedly says 'i can't believe we're going to be a family like this!' he has a sappy smile on his face and i can't help but smile at him.
'thank you'
'Ced, we have to talk'...
He hums softly to himself and then looks me square in the eye. "And you spent the night with me." It's a statement, not a question.
im supposed to by marrying ginny this summer but im gay and so is she. She's in love with a girl called luna from ravenclaw and just I'm confused
'no need to call me prince, prince Draco '
i’ll try to sort this out but schools been really stressful and i haven’t had time.
'you have to kiss!' me and pansy practically yelled together
"I'm glad you find this funny," I mutter, put out.
'okay,' he replied
Fred and George would be proud.
Looking at the time I realised it was now 9pm and I had work tomorrow morning. Without getting ready I got straight into bed. After 5 minutes I realised how lonely and cold this bed felt without her, compulsively I decided to go to the pub and get drunk.
He looks thoughtful. "A woman of her word," his eyes drift to my stomach and smirks, "sometimes." I resist the urge to scream at him.
'I know you do but-'
We were shown the building first seen as all the apartments Draco looked at were in the same place. I found out there was a gym, spa, sauna and a pool included if you lived here. I could already tell that it would be too expensive and I couldn't afford any of these even with Draco's help, since he would live here as well.
"Good." Draco relaxes into the single leather chair, throwing an arm over the back of it. "I like to make sure that the things that belong to me are taking care of themselves."
'dear mum and dad,
the end
I went into the room hands shaking with nerves but I was ready to put my mind at ease.
All at once I want to wring the man's neck, throw his arse out and know every single thing he's said to Cedric. It's hard to decide what I want to say or do first.
i put the bags down next to her so she could pack them away in time for us to move next week.
"So, I'll see you next year." I try to take the sodding pamphlets out of his hands, but he's still kneeling by the desk, turning them over to read.
this became a frequent occurrence whenever they're as a party.
"Want to explain what happened there?" Klein asks. No, is the honest answer.
Now Christmas is over I'm hoping to get more chapters out quicker, also in the UK we are having to isolate for 2 weeks before we go back to school so I should have more time to write.
I had driven over to Draco's, I don't know why but before I knew it I hafd arrived there.
I went to answer it the person on the other side still pounding on the door. However once I opened it I saw the man who stole my Haley from me. All i wanted to do is rip his head off, but my curiousity got the best of me so i asked him what he wanted.
"Because I know. It's not yours. Get the fuck out of my office."
'I'm not sure, would you?'
"I'm fine," I laugh him off. "I just haven't taken the morning sickness medicane yet."
"We were." I shrug, rubbing the back of my neck nervously. "It happened sooner than we were expecting, but..." I shrug, I really can't complain. This is everything we've wanted. Cedric's smile is still fresh in my mind.
or was I...
I'm so sorry this took so long I just couldn't write it down. We're on Christmas break now so hopefully I'll be able to upload soon.
Klein nods and writes something else down. "Have you been sexually active in the last eight weeks?"
Draco nods, though he doesn't look pleased. "How are you?" he asks genuinely concerned.
do you want it to be a dracoxharry story or a cedricxharry story because i know initially i said it was mainly drarry but now i feel bad for cedric.
'but won't i ruin it' harry whispered clearly ashamed of how it had looked before.
Alarmed, I flinch, I wasn't aware that I woke him up. "Nothing, go back to sleep." I say dismissively.
' i miss you mum and dad, i think you would have liked to meet teddy, And bought me ice cream!
I drag my feet out of the hospital slowly. The idea of going home and facing Cedric chills me to my core. I know one thing - there is no way I am telling him what happened at the bar. Nope. The baby has to be Cedric's, it just has to.
~~~~~~~~~
i just nod,
I flush, ashamed. "I've never cheated before," which is the truth, though I'm not sure he believes me. "It would break his heart."
2 o'clock in the morning.
'I think you should go.'
"Fuck."
'well,' he continues 'if you could just get a swab from each of the potential fathers...'
"Fuck," I swear. I hear him chuckle behind me. I turn my head and throw him a heated glare.
Cedric stifles a laugh against my chest. 'I forgot about license day, good luck.' He offers me a playful smirk but moves lower.
'so where are we going to go from here?' he asks unsure if he can talk or not
"How have you been feeling lately? Your notes say you've been fatigued?"
I move silently through the house, my wand held tightly in my palm. The quietness of the house has me feeling tense, alert.
At the top of the stairs, Malfoy opens a door revealing a spacious two-story loft.
'i can actually tolerate this one, play it again if you wish'
how many does he think there are,
i'm not ready
anf again
~~~~~~~~
also thank you 1k reads it's given me the motivation to write!
This is the least stressful part of the day.
'no i came to get her stuff,'
~~~~~~~~~
I stare at him, fear creeping up my spine. Oh no. I clear my throat. "Ahm, I think you have mistaken me for someone else. I am currently in a long-term relationship —."
"It's fine!" Please leave! I scream mentally. i lean down to pick them up but he's already kneeling down, one long pale hand reaching for them. Fuck.
Frick.
The bar is closed when I arrive. The doors are locked from the inside. I realise that there has to be a private entrance for the workers, so I head down the side of the bar. There i find a large wooden door with the word 'EMPOLYEES ONLY' I knock loudly on the door and wait.
Draco is leaning against the wall, a steaming cup of coffee in his hands. I watch as he brings the cup to his lips, purses his lips together and blows, before taking a careful sip. he is rather pretty.
'we can don't worry about it, you don't need to worry about money with me',
'prince harry'
'can you tell me?'
I play with the scrambled eggs for a moment, before taking a small bite. Cedric is by my side in an instant.
875 words
before harry could protest draco was already stripping the tree bare, taking the small baubles of the bottom and the larger baubles off the top, his nose turning up at each one.
The realter showed us up to the apartment (it was on the top floor; luckily there was a lift) we were then let inside.
Malfoy hands me a cup and I grasp it to have something to do with my hands.
They both laugh at Teddy's antics and think to themselves this is going to be the best christmas yet!
'i know, i can't wait to see our beautiful baby'
Harrys pov
For one heart-stopping moment, he doesn't move.
Also thank you for reading
'of course now go and lay down'.
"It's only a doctors visit," I tease.
' ced, we have to talk'...
Draco won't watch muggle movies,
'well were having a baby together so we need to talk about what you want to do' I reply
- teddy lupin and harry potter
Guilt washed over me as I nodded my head to his question slightly, I handed over the envelope and when he opened it his whole face changed into something I've never seen on his face before.
I decline the invitation to go out for a drink, promising to make it up to the team later, and finally escape.
I feel a light blush spread to my cheeks, I take a moment to gather myself then say, 'well thank you for that but I best me off, Cedric is making stir fry.'
I knew I couldn't raise another man's baby especially when we had waited for so long to have a baby together, I love her part of me always will but the other part cant look past the fact that she and that boy slept together. All because she was drunk, them she had the audacity to blame it on the fact she was drunk and couldn't remember any of it.
2001'
"Excellent!" My voice is so bright it sounds fake even to my ears. "You just need to sign this then." I pull the required piece of parchment out of the folder and pass it over him.
'what do you want, you've already taken my girlfriend do you want my house too?'
(See the end of the chapter for
"Excuse me, some of us don't get paid to daydream!"
it had caught them both off guard as they were in the middle of a semi-heated argument as we walked out of potions (now taught by Slughorn) when the mistletoe suddenly appeared from the top of the door way causing them to come to a sudden halt as magic bind them there until they kissed.
also if i write christmas oneshots would you read them?
Cedric comes back and notices my disgusted face.
Quietly, I'm panicking. Birth.
"Ah, so you don't want him to know?"
'Drink this you'll feel better' Cedric pushes a glass of water and a paracetamol into my hands. i shove them in my mouth and gulp down the water and almost instantly my headache eases.
Every Christmas Harry would take Teddy to go and buy a really nice bauble and write a message to either his parents, sirius or any of the fallen.
"Well," I manage to choke out, "I always do listen to your ideas, love, " I stress the final word, which only seems to amuse Malfoy .
it only took 3 minutes.
'Haley,' dr Klein looks at me with a sudden sternness that takes my breath away. 'are you using protection?'
when he returned he led me into his bed and wrapped the duvet around me as the t-shirt was only made from a thin material and only came down to my knees.
Once I've greeted him I cant take this any longer, I lead him over to the living room, the test results firmly held next to my side. once we've sat I turn to face him, giving him the first sight of the white envelope before saying.
'Ready?'
I cope, I somehow cope, until a letter is dropped of into my office. I'm instantly suspicious. No one I know has a this return address.
he does but his words follow me like a bug to a light.
I stay at Draco's most of the day and we discuss plans and what's going to happen, he suprises me. I totally thought he was just going to leave but instead he stay's true to his word, he's taking responsibility.
its not as if anyone has a problem with who you love but we have to marry as the contract was made as soon as ginny was born.
I feel like a bastard. "If you are, then I'd like you to be part of the child's life," I hesitate, "It would be beneficial to my life if you weren't - because of Cedric. Because if you're not, then mine and Cedric's life doesn't change."
when they got back with warm cream lights, matching rose gold and white baubles and a new frosted-snow green tree they got started.
Eventually, the door swings open and Malfoy stands there wearing a loose fitting pair of black silk shorts, shirtless and his hair mused as if he just got out of bed. Maybe he has.
I've been here for hours
my school finishes in 4 days for the christmas holidays so hopefully i'll have time to upload then
also i haven't checked the past 2 chapters so sorry if there are any mistakes
Once the tree was bare he turned to Harry and said,
I only leave when its 6 pm and i know he would be home any minute. As soon as I've sat down and change into comfier clothes he arrives home.
i will.
'are you ready to find out then mrs potter?'
As soon as I'm outside, I breathe in the fresh morning air. I lean against the cold brick wall of the bar and try to asses my situation. I need to keep Draco
'harry where are you I'm home'
I shake my head.
So i've just found out that harry styles will be performing at the Grammys and honestly it's the only thing that's keeping me going.
'well let's just get this over and done with, i don't have all day you know.' draco said sharply while turning to face harry.
Cedric kisses the top of my head. "You can't save everyone from their mistakes," he says kindly. "Just being there for her is enough. You're a good friend Haley."
"There's nothing to know." I'm flushed; I try to force myself to relax.
Omg you don't know how long it took to write that chapter and i still don't like it
I have to talk to Draco
"Congratulations Miss Potter, you are about nine weeks pregnant," he says gently. "I would say - and this is an early estimate - that the baby is due between early November to early December. I can't give you anything more than that at this stage."
Annoyingly, he chuckles to himself clearly pleased his words got to me, 'okay i'll show you out'
Cedric cuts me off with a kiss. "Hush, now get some rest."
"It's a busy day and as you no doubt saw, there are a lot of people waiting to see us. So if you could...," I gesture towards the door, my smile strained.
also we hit 700 reads which is crazy!
thank you for listening to my TED talk.
~~~~~~~~~~~
"Ced — I thought..." I shrug, as he walks over.
this was all fine until i got word that he was to be married late february.
While Cedric is out of the kitchen, I flip open the parenting book. Chapter Three: How To Potty Train Your Toddler. The picture is of a small child, his face screwed up and red as he sits on the potty.
I fake a calm smile, all too aware that there are baby-related pamphlets on my desk. I try to clumsily rest my elbow on the desk and knock the pamphlets to the floor. I need to get him out of my office. Now.
'well you'll be pleased to know your plan worked'
"Thank you." I can feel myself starting to sweat. Why won't he just leave? I snatch the finished license off my desk and shove it under his nose.
I drop my arm in horror. "I -," Shit, I didn't mean to say that last part aloud.
~~~~~~~~~~~
D.L.Malfoy.
"Looks good, doesn't it?" There's a note of pride in Draco's voice.
'come on then lovebirds you can finish your heart to heart later!'
I avert my eyes and clear my throat. "You wanted to talk," I say.
oops!
'yeahh' he dragged out his mind trying to figure out what I was trying to tell him
"Ced!" I cover my face with my hands, while Klien and Cedric laugh.
Meet me on Saturday at 3pm. You know where.
'yeah, let's go and get some, i don't own any,'
"Oh." There's surprise in his voice as he spots the pamphlets. "Congratulations."
'I've already told you that I can and will protect the things that belong to me and as you will be carrying my child...'
"Oh, Haley ." He sounds surprised to see me. "It's been a while."
'i like you'
"Well, at least I can trust one of you," Klien high fives Cedric. "So, you're entering into the world of sleepless nights and baby vomit. How are you both feeling?" Healer Klien folds his arms, half sitting on his office table.
I looked around the apartment once more while he was signing the papers, imagining what life living here would be like.
'i suppose that's why she's got you'
I breathe out slowly. "OK."
we talked for a while until the party was nearly over.
"Is there anything else I need to know? I can still work right?"
the tired-looking pregnant women peer critically at the safety requirements, while they're also trying to not to look too closely at the price tags afraid of what they might see.
"We need a name that won't get our child bullied at school," I tease. "I like the idea of giving the baby a name though, I don't like having to call the baby 'it' all the time."
Cedric meets me outside St. Mungos and engulfs me in a tight hug. I smile into his shoulder, laughing at his excitement.
I can hear warning bells in my head; something about that name seems familiar. I drum my fingers on the table as I try to place it.
The following morning, Cedric is up, dressed and in the kitchen before I am. There's a parenting book on the kitchen table, along with a list written in Cedric's neat script. I wander over and pick it up.
when he told me I wasnt expecting that.
*the Hogwarts annual ball*
The idea of leaving Cedric alone with Malfoy chills my blood.
he places the cup down on the rough wooden coffee table. "You know where I am now, so I expect you to keep me in the loop." He looks at me, his expression softening a little. "Speaking off, how are you?"
Cedric laughs as he places kisses around my jaw, and I close my eyes in pleasure. 'Do you have to work today?'he asks as his teeth nip at my throat.
as i'm walking home i decide to take a short cut ,as my feet are killing me, to a street that i haven't been through before. i'm lost in thought on how i should tell cedric, when i look up i can see a baby shop. immediately i'm drawn in because i can actually look for myself not one of ron's brothers baby.
i hate this but i felt like i needed to post,
and then for Dumbledore.
"Sure."
as soon as i arrived at Draco's i felt like i couldn't breathe.
i have to get out of here
That year the bauble said,
(See the end of the chapter for
"Right." I run my hand through my already messy red hair. "Thanks again." I promise to come back in two weeks so dr Klein can see how I'm doing and leave.
"But surely you don't shag them?"
he looks me in the eyes and says 'i hope so'.
while i called pizza hut to order (since haley was craving it) she started to go through her clothes as apparently there's no point taking clothes your not going to wear to a new house, i thought the point was to organise and go through what you want as your packing everything away.
'if you could come in same time tomorrow that would be great'
I gape at him. His smirk only widens. "Tea?"
I can't deny how much I'm looking forward to hearing and seeing the baby for the first name, to holding our child. A family. Our family.
i hate it
most of this scene is from Earth_Phoenix's nine months because i can't re-write it, they wrote it amazingly! (does that make sense ) go read the original i highly recommend it!!
'We should do something,' Cedric says as he turns back to the bed.
The question takes Cedric by surprise and for a moment he's speechless, then once he's processed what i said Laughter bubbles up from inside of him, and he's quickly holding his stomach as he laughs.
or was I...
I don't remember any of this. Was I really that stupid? I am never drinking ever again. Not ever. Not even a teeny tiny sip.
Then again I deserve it.
21 days.
Anyway thank you so much for 1.9k reads on wattpad it's unbelievable.
"Why don't you sit down Haley?" He pats an empty chair next to him. "After all, you have the baby to think of now."
~~~~~~~~~
eventually.
'i'll go if you just give me a key or something i can go for you'
"Haley?"
"It's not the strangest question I've been asked," Klien's voice is coloured with amusement. "Babies do poop, but it only happens in less than 15% of all pregnancies and most of the waste comes out during birth."
I don't want to get my hopes up, let alone Draco's; who feels like hes already failing as a parent, and as a husband.
when they first did this, harry thought it would be a one time thing until the next christmas came around and teddy asked if we could get a bauble for Harry's parents since it's only fair that they got one for his.
I frown at him. "I replied to your letter, I said I would be here."
8th year fic with minor pansmione which has become one of my favorite ships if you didn't know
"Are you just going to stare at me all day?" He turns his head slightly, and I blush.
"So, you're here to renew your license? Nothing has changed for you recently?"
First I got him to watch home alone as it's a classic then we watched the grinch which he thought was stupid as 'this would never happen Pottah it's not realistic' he said while a house elf pops up bringing him a hot chocolate with warming charms on it and he levitates it to and from himself and the table when ever he wants it .
Guilt washed over me as I nodded my head to his question slightly, I handed over the envelope and when he opened it his whole face changed into something I've never seen on his face before.
~~~~~~~~~~
Once they had finished the kitchen and living room they did the nursery; so it would be ready for the baby's arrival in a few months time, Haley caught Draco stood in shock in the nursery, barely believing he would have a family a few times but was considerate enough not to mention it to him, for the sake of his pride.
He gives me a dirty look and stands up. "Is it mine?"
'yeah, I just need to ask you about what will happen if the baby is yours,'
after we've finished up at the hospital appointment i tell cedric i want to speak to the doctor privately, having heard what his friends had said about pregnant woman and their mood swings he decided to let it go and said he would wait in the wating room outside for me.
And so i did
'I would take you out on a proper date, show you what you deserve... after all the baby should have two parents who love each other unconditionally.'
'we can go now if you want, maybe we could write in for Snape as he wasn't as bad as i thought'
i think you would have really liked to meet lily, we think she's going to be just like you!
i had started to develop feelings for him as much as i hate to say it but i have.
I really didn't want to go back to that house especially because there was a chance that Cedric would be there, I had a feeling that I wouldn't be his most favorite person in the world right now.
'Carry on, you told me you stayed at hermiones that night'
no matter what movie it is
It had started to get late, none of us cared- at least no one who was sober cared. It was Hermiones 28th birthday so we and a couple of others decided to go out to celebrate.
"Your relationship with him depends on me not telling him our little secret' he pauses, 'so yes, I do own you right now."
he passes me two swab kits and i quickly shove them in my bag,
It's has been lying there untouched waiting to tell me.
So i've planned the rest of the story and it will end in chapter 20, so for us in the uk we go back to school march 8th, hopefully i'll have finished writing this by then but i'm not sure (when i'm writing this it's Thursday) because i have my gcse's next year and we've missed a lot of school so i'll be focusing on that.
At least this time he's wearing clothes. He's wearing a sleek pair of dark grey trousers, with a matching grey t-shirt that is just tight enough to stretch across his chest in a way that shows it off nicely.
I scoff, "I don't think a quickie in a bathroom ranks up there as anything special."
"Hm," he says again and picks up a calendar of the small desk in the corner of the room. "Were you having sex around late February, early March?"
Countless doctors and appointments have told us not to get our hopes up but also not to give up entirely, we're just praying for a miracle. knowing the chances are low we haven't told anyone yet ,but it doesn't hide the fact how much we want a baby. something just feels like it's missing.
He pokes me in the ribs. "Yeah, our first as a couple!" His eyes are shining with joy and it's infectious.
I went into the room (with my hands shaking with nerves), I was ready to finally put my mind at ease.
'what'
so I finally break.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I cuddle closer to Cedric. "I suppose, I feel so bad for her though."
Over the next few weeks they would spend time putting together their apartment with each other; conveniently ignoring the thing that was between them.
No. Oh, sweet Merlin, he's walking around the desk. NO.
'I will. I'll tell him when he gets home from work tonight' I say more to myself than to him.
It was just after lunch and I had decided to get it over and done with. I knock on the door and wait for the deviously handsome but arrogant blonde to arrive.
"Sex," he says patiently.
'me either' i replied but what i really wanted to see was who the father is.
Howver recently every morning i've woken up feeling sick,
I can't get to sleep, knowing that tomorrow I can find out who the baby's father is. Cedric had to go back to work this afternoon which gave me just enough time to go and get the swab from Draco and deliver it to the hospital, which suprisenly he was cooperative about. As soon as we had got home cedric had already fallen asleep so it gave me chance to get his swab, so I already had his.
i see a little cove just out side ball room covered with a cream curtain.
soon after that i leave the room and me and cedric leave, I make up some excuse about periods and pregnancy; he buys it.
"Please leave," I plead. "Come to my office tomorrow and we'll talk."
My brows knit together. "Remember what?"
i'm so sorry for the lack of updates  schools been crazy and my mental health has just gone📉
(See the end of the chapter for
'Harry when are we going to get this years bauble!!' little 7 year old Teddy said rushing out his words clearly bursting with excitement of having another person to share their tradition with.
i come back home about an hour or so later to see haley sat on the sofa watching some sort of vampire show while eating probably the biggest bag of cheetos they make.
'and if you can deliver them to me before 6:30 tonight we can have the results ready for tomorrow'
The letter reads...
Harry was scared to tell Draco about his tradition at first.
after much research we found something called magic mistletoe which would lock them in place together until they kissed, no spell could help them.
I got the highest in my class in spanish!
sorry this chapters short but the next ones long to make up for it!
I bristle at that. "I am not yours."
Teddy Lupin, Draco and Harry Malfoy-Potter
he turns the laptop to show me a Pinterest board of nursery ideas, all based around 'gender neutral' tones.
Draco takes a closer look and reads one that says,
if i do finish writing them there should be about 2 chapters a week.
i hope you are proud of us
*9 weeks ago*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
'Haley answer the next question honestly... are you saying you cheated on me and the baby might not be mine!'
immediately i recognised him.
For the past week Draco and I have been packing up his apartment and going furniture shopping so we'll have it in time for when we move in which is only 2 weeks away. We've been on countless trips to Ikea and packed up all of Draco's stuff when I realised that the remainder of my clothes are at Cedric's house. the only thing is I don't want to go back. I don't want to see him, even though its my fault that we're here in the first place; I still can't forgive him for not hearing me out and kicking me out at basically the first opportunity he had.
He would think it was stupid.
"Would the cheating break his heart, or would the baby not being his do it?" Malfoy asks. His voice is losing the thickness it had as he wakes up.
'sure, now can i come in to get her stuff,' Cedric stepped aside to let Draco in, not before making sure his shoulder would hit Draco's as he passed.
I head towards the garden and my blood runs cold.
I'll be there.
'hey did you have a good day' he says absentmindedly then he says, 'look at this',
it was going to happen eventually, i just helped to speed it up. I saved them a lot of time in the long run. He should be thanking me.
'what are you doing'
'its an early present'
He scowls at me. "If it's mine, I want access. I want to be involved."
'but i can't go back i don't want to see him'
'what is this' harry said exasperated as he made no progress in breaking free,
~~~~~~~~~
"Hm, that's good. Not everyone gets morning sickness, but be aware - just because you haven't felt sick yet doesn't mean you won't ."
soon i found that he was a hopeless romantic
Also before you go thank you for reading, please leave kudos!!
Once they were finished, they were both satisfied as it included both of their tastes, each one complementing the other, just like themselves.
(See the end of the chapter for
'Harry...' knowing he had hit a soft spot he strutted over to harry and gathered him in his arms.
'do you love her, haley' cedric pauses while maintaining eye contact with draco 'or is she just a good fuck?'
A headache begins to pulse angrily behind my eyes. The tiredness I've felt all day is gone. I wrap an arm tightly around Cedric.
so literally half of my year is isolating but im not, so at school there is going to be basically no one to talk to but someone who is supposed to be isolating and has come into contact of the person who has it asked people to come around to hers,
~~~~~~~~~~
'we’re having a baby'
"That's true," I agree. "But," I chew on my bottom lip. "Wouldn't it hurt? I mean, if it was us..." I trail off.
We instantly fell in love.
'Draco but... how' I managed to stutter out.
he won't
Sitting on the bathroom floor.
"Have you ever thought about telling him the truth?" He walks to the kitchen and a comes back a teapot and two cups in his arms.
"It does," I agree softly. I tear my eyes away from the bar, so I can see Draco more clearly. "You've done a great job on this place."
Cedric slides a plate of scrambled eggs and toast in front of me, a happy smile on his face. "Me too."
Draco shakes his head at me. "You're right. This loft — the bar, none of it is very child-friendly." He pins me with a look. "Speaking off..."
'hey' cedric says without even looking at me as soon as i enter the house. after a few seconds he catches on, 'how was the doctors, come and tell me about it when we're eating!' as he leads me through the house he says cheekily 'though we really need to work on your punctuality!'
'still do' cedric mutters under his breath but loud enough for draco to hear, unintentionally.
'well remember miones party that i went to?'
He smirks, "We went upstairs — I live in the loft over the bar. It was... you were...," he trails off, clearly lost in the memories.
however he would never admit he liked it
"I will." This has turned out to be much more civil than I expected it to be. "Thanks for making this easy."
i could of sworn I saw tears of happiness threatening to spill, but he would dismiss them and tell me 'don't get all sentimental on me pottah'
He looks at me thoughtfully. "I haven't said anything — yet."
*8 o'clock*
He drops the pen in surprise, "Don't you remember?" he asks quietly.
'don't worry about it, I'll go and sign the papers now'
'i loved her'
Me and Cedric are going to the doctors today for a checkup so it means we can see the baby again. i'll need to make up and excuse to talk to the doctor alone so i can make an appointment for tomorrow.
He stares at my hand and remains seated. His blue eyes drift up to mine. "What's the rush?"
Two beautiful floor to ceiling windows dominates the left wall, drenching the room in sunlight. The walls are exposed brick.
this has Mpreg harry so if you aren't comfortable with this don't read, it also includes them struggling to get pregnant just incase any of this Is a tw!
"True, we need to pick gender neutral names for now - like Ashley or Ollie."
I glare fiercely back at him. I want to get him away from Cedric as quickly as possible. No, I need to get him away from Cedric.
When he first saw Harry's tree he was distraught with how it was decorated, how the colours of each bauble were mismatched. How the lights were all still tangled up. How there was tinsle on each levels of the branches.
"We'll ask the doctor." Cedric smiles once he's able to get a hold off himself.
"he is a twat," i write back,
the movie had finished but Haley had fallen asleep on me. Knowing it would hurt her back if she slept on the sofa. I carried her to my room and put her on the bed, I thought she could sleep in her clothes; I didn't think she would appreciate if I changed her.
we would meet up behind a curtain and talk.
"Look," I grind out, "I only have your word on that."
thats when they knew that this would be the best christmas they've ever had.
i couldn't really remember what had happened in the last hour-ish but the room was now buzzing and a girl with auburn-red hair in tight curls that fell down her back approached me I couldn't really make out what she said clearly but it was something along the lines of 'do you want to go back to mine or yours ' we got in a taxi and headed home, she payed the taxi fare while I opened the door up i can't really remember what happened but it ended with us laying in bed with no clothes on, breathing abnormally fast.
'well how do we get out of here' he sighed
I arrived at the hospital without a minute to spare and once I had made my way to the reception the doctor was ready.
I can feel my face draining of colour. "It was?" My throat is tight, my heart is hammering in my chest.
'Haley!', he laughs 'we can't we have work'. he protests though he makes no effort to move me.
"I'm fine," which is true, "The baby is fine too, the Healer is pleased with both of us."
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
when i get there i feel like i can finally breathe
A hazy image of me, pinned against a bathroom wall, my legs wrapped around a strangers waist as he pumps into me fills my mind. I instantly pale. "Yes."
i'm going to continue it but i'm running out of ideas.
"No," I manage, trying not to look at his firm chest. I stand awkwardly, and he rises to his feet.
"Thank you," is all he says.
Malfoy has really got under my skin, damn it. I force a smile, ignoring how much I've been doing that in the last half an hour and how much my cheeks hurt right now.
~~~~~~~~~~
'mhm, because they're going to fire us', i sit up on my elbows and pull his shirt off of him. "i'm sure that they can spare us for a few hours."
Neither would admit it though.
Thank you for reading!!!
'morning' he replies, his voice still think with sleep.
That this christmas was only one of many.
i knocked on the door, though it felt like my heart would beat out of my chest.
"You can sit up now," Klein says moving towards the desk. I sit up, swinging my legs back and forth idly.
'i would love that'
"I'd want to know," he says, "if I was the husband. You can't work on a relationship if people are keeping important secrets like that."
Draco raises an eyebrow. "Does Cedric know yet?"
unrealistic i'm sure go and cry to your flying broom and magic sticks.
In this the Potters are alive and happy. Harry's family are the gryffindoor royal family draco is slytherin, there isn't any hate towards each other and the kingdoms get along well but Draco was engaged to Astoria and harry was engaged to ginny.
I look down at the teacup in my hands. "I would rather not find out," I admit. "I know that makes me a coward, but..." I let my sentence trail off.
he looked like he had just woken up, aggravated with the fact i had woken up.
Draco,
That night, I lie in bed, my mind whirling. Cedric sighs and turns over, dropping an arm over my chest.
Draco would be home soon and I needed to find out before he got home to spare his feelings in case it's another false alarm.
*a few years later*
'I thought we could go to the Harvester as it's on the way to the houses I want to show you', he tells me as he open's the door for me so I can get in the car. Maybe he can be a gentleman.
I tried to tell him that male pregnancy's are rare and take a while but he wont listen to me.
'couldn't she come and get it herself'
'my tree' he replied almost sarcastically.
When I arrive home I call Cedric's name to see where he is, I follow where his voice came from, my mind still stuck on what Draco said and what he meant by 'he would show me what I deserve'. However I was pulled from further forbidden thoughts when I glance up to the table to see my boyfriend hunched over his laptop with tea still cooking on the hob,
he looks at me expectingly, 'well?'
We troop up the stairs to his loft. A week has passed and I do not feel any fitter than I did last week with these stairs. Once we reach the top and pass through the wards, I head straight for Draco's over the top white leather sofa and immediately sink down into it.
so we did
he opened the door, immediately his eyes went to the piece of paper i'm holding.
I walk through the employee entrance through to the apartment upstairs avoiding the subtle buzz of conversation from the late lunchers.
"you weren't on the pill and you slept with me — ,"
I ball my fists at my sides. "Shut up! No one is supposed to know." My voice sounds more pleading than angry.
'yeah Harry when can we go and get the bauble'
i was laying in bed lost in thought when cedric awoke, still unaware he was awake i almost jumped out of my skin when i felt his hand come to life and cup my stomach.
'yes',
Three more weeks before The Scan .
It had 3 bedrooms, enough for us and the baby, and 2 bathrooms including an on suite joined to the master bedroom. The kitchen was connected to the living room with full length windows that replaced the walls, giving the place a lot of natural light. There was a balcony that was only accessible from the master bedroom but it could be seen slightly from the living room, though it was mainly blocked by the large flat screen tv hung on the wall.
Once I've greated him I can't take this any longer, I lead him over to the living room, the test results firmly held next to my side.Once we've sat I turn to face him, giving him the first sight of the white envelope before saying.
I took a glance at the test and my heart stopped
Cedric walks back into the kitchen, his arms wrapping around my shoulders. He kisses the side of my face and neck, brimming with happiness.
I'm so consumed with panic, I miss a knock at the door and only come too when an angry female bar owner slams her hand on my desk, her face screwed up in a snarl.
I'm not sure how lying down is supposed to make me feel better, but OK. I lie down on the hard leather and feel, well, less dizzy.
The fact he knows where I live and feels confident enough to speak to Cedric is worrying.  One thing is for sure, I see a return visit to St. Mungos in my future.
~~~~~~~~~~~
Oh no. Oh no . hermione's birthday. That hot guy at the bar. Cedric. My head swims and for a moment I feel dizzy. Shit. Shit. Shit .
i braced myself for them but when the curtain was pulled back i saw none other than Draco Malfoy prince of Slytherin.
i saw his face display emotions of happiness to shock and confusion.
I scratch behind my ear. "Nothing has changed since last time." I drop my hands into my lap. "I won't be able to tell you anything new for another three weeks at least."
she gives me a doubtful look but turns away and leave. but by friday cedric has booked me an appointment to see our doctor. he ignores all my protests and assurances that i'm actually fine, thank you very much.
~~~~~~~~~~~
'don't stress it will only make it all worse than it actually is'
As i send the letter off first class with my assistant, I try to push all my worry about draco to the back of my mind. At least draco was sticking to his side of the deal.
we have been trying for a baby for a long time, a couple years actually, but we haven't had any look yet.
Klien presses a reassuring hand on my shoulder. "It's OK, we don't have to think about the birth just yet, but it is something we're going to need to discuss in the future."
since it's christmas i thought he would make an exception and watch a christmas movie with me but no.
Right, the Doctor. Keeping secrets has never been so stressful. I've convinced Cedric to meet me at the hospital. The idea of having him anywhere near the office where someone could innocently ask him how the visit went yesterday chills me to the core.
pleased with our surprised reactions they turned away and headed in the direction of the slytherin dorm rooms.
'yeahhh' he dragged out,
oh...' I vaguely remember hearing him say while I see him put them down before my vision is clouded with unshed tears.
this is the only part I hate about the arrogant selfish prick
I woke up to a light nudge on my shoulder, once I had rolled onto my side I saw that it was Draco. It took me a second to recall what happened last night however my train of thoughts were interrupted 'I brought you some tea and thought we could go for breakfast before we go to look around some house and apartment since the baby can't grow up here'. He placed the cup of tea into my hands and started to walk towards the door before stopping and turning around, 'oh and, drink your tea and get ready since it's already 10.' With that he left me alone in his room with a cup of tea and an overthinking mind.
'don't remind me'.
'in here' I called from, the living room when I sat shaking with anticipation, holding the carefully wrapped box with a white bow on top.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
640 words
this only last a few minutes until i hear someone walking this way. they would make me go back not caring how i felt.
"Sorry." He wraps his arms around me, but the tension doesn't leave my body. My eyes are glued to the blonde-haired man sitting in the other chair.
"You said you had a boyfriend," he says slowly. "Were you trying?"
"Hello, Cedric, pleasure to meet you." I watch tensely as the two shake hands. Klien turns to me. "I hope you've been reading those pamphlets, Harry, and taking your nausea medication ."
I'm about to head upstairs when I hear the sound of voices coming from the garden. Our garden is rather small — the price of living in London. We have a small table and chairs on the patio for when we entertain our friends during the summer.
Cedric blushes. "I was just toying with ideas,"
unable to get the words I take the test results out of the envelope, I had opened it at the doctors office so I knew what to do. I pass them over to him and see the range of emotions display across his face as he reads the results.
"No!"
I roll my eyes. "draco,
"Ah." Klein sounds like he's heard this all before, and maybe he has. Fabulous, I've become a statistic. "That would complicate matters."
'well do you want to find out when we can?'
"One time!"
"Let's get you sorted!" I say brightly, finding her folder. She seems pleased that I'm giving her my full attention, smirking in a maddening self-satisfied way.
'wait Draco we can't-'
Cedric leaves my side and heads into the kitchen, leaving me alone with Malfoy .
i haven't ever been one for one night stands, especially when i'm already in a committed relationship; but the feel of his hands on my hips, his mouth nipping, licking and sucking my throat. his strong but delicate  hands pushing my top apart and tracing over my stomach. i felt helpless against his touch.
~~~~~~~~~~
"This is Cedric," I say quickly, "the overprotective boyfriend I told you about."
after a moment he says, 'sure come in'
~~~~~~~~~
but it also means for my group presentation I have to do it on my own and my English presentation I have to do while others don't.
~~~~~~~~~~~~
As I as laying in bed I looked to my left to see cedric laying there peacefully unknowingly. I've never felt more guilty with what I did. It got us into this whole mess. I just hope our relationship is strong enough to get through this but I dont deserve it.
i split this into two because it's a long part also i had a maths test today which i definitely failed so yeah
he walked in chasing me out f my thoughts 'whats in the box'
he won't watch it.
'Right, of course'. I smile, or at least I try to, and Cedric comes to my rescue and begins asking his own questions.
I'm a professional quidditch player, I play a seeker for the holy-head harpies alongside Ginny who was 'not interested in boys, I would rather play quidditch than wake up every day next to a middle-aged man who tells me how to run my lufe'.
i heard the door to our house slam shut and Draco's voice immediately follow.
they both groaned while ron and blaise failed to smother a snicker.
'Well, every year me and Harry go out and buy a bauble and write a message on it and hang it up on the tree, look' teddy says while pointing at the previous years baubles.
part 2 should be up now and we finally have a draco scene whoop whoop!!
We cross into the centre of the room where Malfoy drops into a worn brown leather sofa. There's a matching armchair nearby, so I sit down on that.
I nodded in agreement as we finished our food in comfortable silence, After we had finished Draco put Netflix on and we watched some movie, well he watched the movie. I fell asleep.
when harry went to pull away after a few seconds but draco caught the side of his face and pulled him back in with his arms attaching themselves around his neck, Harry's arms coming to hold Draco's waist. this went on for a few minutes until they had to pull apart for air, their foreheads coming to rest on the others, a smile pulling from the corner of eithers mouth.
Harry just about broke inside but agreed anyway.
"we can put the dinner in the microwave when we're done' i'm done i want to say as Cedric places a kiss on my cheek. "Draco here came to let me know you were going to be late. Good idea hiring him by the way, I always said you could use an assistant."
We fall silent and I come to the conclusion he's fallen asleep, but then he speaks.
~~~~~~~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I scratch the back of my neck. "Well yeah - I mean, I've had a couple of headaches, but nothing I would be worried about."
I sigh, 'I hate to say it, but yes. It's license day.'
Haley.
'we’re having a baby' I repeated.
(See the end of the chapter for
"Mmm," Cedric prods.
it's was about 10am when Haley had left Draco's apartment for the foreseeable future and were on their way to their new apartment; the cars boot filled to the brim with extra things they had/needed to use over the past few days. It was only about 20 minutes away including London city traffic with a moving van following closely behind them.
As i walked up the stairs i noticed that the light was on in the living room.
"I'm very sorry," I drop heavily into my chair, "If I could take your name?"
Work drags by slowly. I jump every time Ginny says, "Haley, you have a visitor!" in a cheerful voice.
finally the pieces click into place and Cedric all but throws himself at me, still careful of my stomach. He buries his face in my auburn hair (just like my mums) and we laugh, wild and free. The future seems brighter and happier than ever before. Dinner lays forgotten on the table as Cedric takes my hand land leads me into the bedroom.
'what kind of question is that'
and again
Cedric.
"Come in." His voice sounds thick, he leans against the door as he yawns.  I step past him into the bar.
Ours.
I stagger forwards and sink down into a chair, my head in my hands. This situation is slowly slipping out of my control. Questions buzz around my head, mostly concerning Malfoy .
I wanted to tell her that this, this human life growing inside of me was so much better than some ring.
he can't move and he's whining non stop so i better make the best out of it.
He first did this the first Christmas after The Battle Of Hogwarts as a way to help him grieve. He and teddy went to a fair few shops until they found the one he wanted.
'hey',
constructive criticism is always welcome!!!
'haley, what?'
it became a tradition.
most 3/4 of my year at school are in isolation but i’m not
'You don't remember me?" He sits down in the chair facing my desk, his legs crossed, his posture relaxed.
-Teddy Lupin and Harry Potter
"No." Oh my God, I sound like a moody teenager. I clear my throat and try again. "Good afternoon Draco."
'what's this about Haley,' he asks clearly worried, 'is this about the baby, are you both ok?'
'hello miss potter, i'm dr Klein', he turns out to be a fairly handsome redhead man with a well-trimmed beard, an easy smile and kind eyes.
Christmas was coming soon, we loved Christmas usually but ever snce we have tried for a baby Christmas feels wrong,
Already there are lines of impatient bar owners with documents crushed up in their hands. I offer apologetic waves to my team before slipping into my office.
i make a run for it.
I hmph and flick through the folders on my desk. "You run the peacock at Barlow?"
" Nice place," I say.
also for some reason i can’t upload the photos, if you want to see them they’re on my wattpad yoursogoldennnn, but they’re just baby nursery’s from pinterest
"How do you know?" He looks at me critically and I cover my stomach my with my arms.
'well i got blackout drunk, then i remember going to the bathroom, but i don't really remember what happened after that and that's the worst part.'
514 words
'you still love her'
(See the end of the chapter for
i’ll try to update unplanned soon but i’m not sure when.
When it was about 10 in the morning there was incessant knock on the door; I finally had to get out of bed and stop wallowing in self pity.
i nod, not trusting myself to speak
Cedric hums beside me, "It really is a pickle," he agrees.
Haley,
~~~~~~~~
'thank you' she said barely understandable as she had a mouth full of cheetos.
'will you?'
"I don't." I hastily sit in my chair, "I meet a lot of people — "
i want to tell him, i really do but i don't know how. i hate keeping these secrets from him.
It's beautiful.
I slump into a chair. "Ah—erm, sure."
i'm sorry for this
'what is that'. Draco asked, disgust clear in the tone of his voice.
i pause, feeling nervous for what's to come. i lick my dry lips,'sure'.
Thoughts of home become thoughts of Cedric. My stomach twists in uncomfortable knots and I fight back the urge to be sick. I have to do something about Malfoy. What, I'm not quite sure, but something .
"It was more than just a quickie."
when he told me I wasn't expecting that.
He takes the licence out of my hand, dropping the pamphlets on my seat. "Expect my call."
Taking Draco's advice i decided to go and rest while he went to get my stuff, it's not like he'll need me while he gets it anyway.

'Haley... your scaring me tell me what's going on'
The question takes me by surprise. "I'm fine," I find myself saying and then figure he deserves the truth. "I have some morning sickness, but other than that, I'm well."
at first he didn't even acknowledge me.
'yeah i'll be fine by the morning, you know how much of a lightweight i am'.
I break down in his arms, I can't help it, all the stress of the past few weeks is finally catching up with me. I've been so focused on these results I haven't given myself chance to feel anything.
"Thank you." I slip the leaflet into my jean pocket.
'may i call you Haley?" he asks.
"i suppose you want to know who the father is,"
"Haley, i have some... delicate questions to ask if that's ok?"
I grab his hand and squeeze. Together, we walk into the hospital and head for the private treatment rooms. Doctor Klein is waiting for us, the door open wide. He raises an eyebrow at me as Cedric enters.
"So," he says, "When can I expect to see you back? It was quite a night."
*friday*
the key haley gave me was useless. all i had to go was go in, grab her stuff and get out, but i have a feeling that it wasn't going to be that easy.
"You OK?" He brushes my hair back to feel my forehead.
i grin lazily at him and say 'well I can show you what happened.' he looks confused and I can't help the excitement I feel. i move us into the living room and have him sit down on the sofa and i kneel at his feet 'close your eyes.'
"I - I, had unprotected sex with someone that wasn't my boyfriend."
but i want it to be christmas instead
He looks at me, his eyes dark and intense. "I'm surprised you're here, I half expected you to blow me off."
I screw up the letter and drop into the bin.
"Four times."
then he opened the door.
"Yes, we are," I agree.
