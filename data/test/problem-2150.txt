Tom nodded, acknowledging this as truth.
This time there was an outright explosion as the excited athletes and crazed fans (which included nearly everybody) chattered about the other Quidditch teams and argued over which members of the House teams should represent Hogwarts.
“Yes Master! It is ordered!”
“So, I propose we
“Great Merlin! He’s powerful!” he said, clearly pleased.
Draco leaned

Of course, someone like Potter…the most powerful wizard of several ages…married to a Weasley…Draco shuddered. What a

, and I want it. I’ll know it, or you’ll be my gift to the Dark Lord when I join him.”
“Molly will have dessert ready in a few minutes.”
Well. If that was the way he was going to play.
“Have you ever heard the term ‘pulling pig-tails’?” Lupin continued.
“Yes, you know I would. But it’s just not that simple.”
He had a favor to ask of the old man.
Draco would have to be sure to reveal all of what Harry already knew…but to reveal too much would also ruin his plans for the powerful Gryffindor.
Draco looked at his godfather in disbelief. He knew Severus was an ardent supporter of the Dark Lord, for him to concede the Boy Who Lived might have more magic, could become more powerful…was Severus having second thoughts?
Draco reached again and received a deeper truth from his ancestor.
The Black library was fascinating. Built along similar lines to the Malfoy library, and with a similar pattern of Neutral and Grey tomes and the irritating but not illegal revisionist historical accounts…all organized according to a system psychologically guaranteed to cause any uninformed searcher to give up on certain areas before they ran across the truly illegal Black tomes.
“Shut up Rose, it’s not James’ fault he’s freaking out!”
“He referred to you as ‘Malfoy’.” Blaise said with a knowing look. Professor always referred to his Slytherins as “
Draco didn’t return to Hogwarts until just after dinner, and immediately set out in search of one Harry Potter.
“I guess you’re too little to be my new friend.” The boy said, but was oddly not so disappointed.
Molly was clearly winning.
“That’s all very well and good if you’re Albus Dumbledore, or the sodding Boy-Who-Lived, Potter. He already wants you dead. Surely you’re not going to advise a
“But my uncles Fred and George did!”
“Maybe he can’t. There have been rumors that Dark Magic-”
A host of other symbols indicated various special boosts to Potter’s innate magical power.
“I do too. But your werewolf sent me to get you for breakfast.”
“Potter fancies…” his voice croaked, before he was suddenly lunging for his pensieve, enlarging it and grabbing up Snape’s vial, pulling the stopper, and pouring it in.
“You’ll have a real home with me.” He said softly.
Snape’s coughing intensified.
you trying to turn me Dark? Are you manipulating me?”
Draco put a finger on that sweet mouth, silencing it.
“He chartsssss the deepesssssst dreamsssss.” The Dreamer sighed, rather longingly.
“Shut up boy. You’re not going to have your little slick-tongued barrister here to talk you out of this.” Moody growled.
of magical power.
“Till then, Potter.” He commented.
“Ron! How could you be so insensitive?” Granger rebuked him shrilly. “I don’t see how you can even suggest something like this!”
“Well, yes, one. But he is so very much in demand, you see.”
“Headmaster, I know you’re thinking he’s just a boy, but this is also a Malfoy we’re talkin’ about, don’t forget! He’s as snakey as they come, that one, and now he’s caught out we can’t be letting him slip-slide his way out of it!” Auror Moody added.
“We’ll be discussing this more, later. Let’s talk about Black, now.”
Draco’s eyes snapped open and he looked at Harry’s earnest face, feeling something inside him glowing with some unknown magical energy as he continued.
“This is our last year, Blaise. We can be neutral, for now. But I don’t think the war will be over in time to avoid making choices.”
Potter’s blush turned pale.
“What? No…”
Potter dropped the small slip of paper like it had burned him.
“Fixing these. I don’t have the power levels needed to regenerate some of the components.”
“I would love to accompany to observe the fruits of our project, Potter.” Draco cut him off mercifully.
Draco considered.
Dumbledore, up at the Head Table, stood up to greet the men.
Dumbledore sighed again.
Potters eyes were glazing over. Draco hurried on.
, Heir to the House of Black!” she swooned dramatically.
Behind them, the strange boy reappeared, studying the door where they’d exited thoughtfully a moment before vanishing once again.
“We’ll be working on those. I’ve designed a series of exercises that will enhance your reflexes, my boy. We need you to have a spell ready to your lips whenever a wand is raised against you. And not the same spell every time. And yes, I think it’s time you began learning some custom-modified offensive spells as well.”
“No.”
“If I can persuade them, yes.”
good.
“So we need a fourteenth the mass of the nickel, that amount of the fourteenth element. Funny how that works out.”
Draco folded his arms, an eyebrow raised skeptically as he inspected them, a smirk tugging at the corner of his lips.
“Here, help me.”
Draco also stared, with newfound respect.
“Good.”
“What?”
. You’ve never held a baby, have you?”
“Whatever, Potter.” Draco said, and was suddenly looking at the back of Potter’s neck. Potter’s fingers tightened slightly on his wrist, pulling him closer until he was very nearly flush with Potter’s back.
Draco sighed and politely turned his back until the horrid noises stopped.
“So…you’re telling me there are a whole population of people who are capable of projecting a Gnossic waveform? And that’s where all the mythology of magic comes from. But a Gnossic waveform only has application to a few…”
Draco repressed a growl of annoyance as he realized the humiliating thought was making him hard under his robes.
raising your sons if something happened to you?” Draco pointed out, an eyebrow raised.
After many long years of being just too busy and stressed to write, current circumstances (COVID-19, basically) now leave me with limited available activities due to being stuck indoors. But, writing is something I still enjoy in my work, even from a more serious tone than here. I figured I'd break myself back in the habit of writing in the voices of my characters with a character I've been wanting to sink my teeth into!
“Harry.”
“Merlin! Potter

The same surge of magic seared him again.
“I want you to start spending more time with them. Perhaps make it seem there’s some distance growing between yourself and the rest of Slytherin. Find out more about Potter’s courtship for us.”

“What?”
“Chemistry for Dummies?”
He arched an eyebrow at Blaise, subtly inviting him to join him as he walked to his rooms.
“Responsibility?”
The Gryffindor was

“I asked if they could tell me about my father, and they were telling us that who I’m related to doesn’t mean anything, and Draco was saying that it does too.” Jamie informed the Head of House, ever so helpfully.
~Lily Potter~ (crossed out)
“I…I would like to go to Hogwarts.” He looked over at Scorpius, who was burbling happily at magical fireflies that kept evading his grasp. “But I don’t think I can be too far from Scorpius.”
Draco’s hackles raised. He would have preferred anyone but the creepy Auror with the prosthetic eye. But he nodded.
Then a list of Death Eaters. No surprise there, except that Severus wasn’t listed among them. Strange.
A swirl of the liquid with his wand, and Draco plunged his face into it, finding himself in Snape’s office.
“Of course he is! He’s a Malfoy!”
? Most wizards never even bother with girls until they’re married! Too much worry about bastard children or accidentally piercing the veil!”
“Yeah we do. He told her he was an idiot.” Weasley reminded Potter angrily.
Jamie stopped, blushed, and hastily rearranged her robes. Not nearly neatly enough.
What a strange place to draw memories from. People died. Or worse, betrayed you. Better to choose something immovable to draw from. Like an idea. Or the past.
But Jamie was right. Muggle-raised Potter would expect some kind of quasi-marital relationship
“He can’t even talk yet, we can tell him his name later.” Regulus urged.
Mr. Zabini’s eyebrow went up about four inches at Tom’s last name.
“Harry. I’m not creeped out. Trust me. I
Draco raised his wand.
“Of course it would! The Blacks can most certainly afford a pregnancy potion! Mind you,
Both nodded.
.” Granger growled, pointing at the letter.
There was a moment of silence, only broken by one of the twins coughing hysterically behind his hand. Draco glared at the offending bookend.
“Why did you not choose someone besides your son to bond him to?”
Well. At least outside the bedroom Draco could still be the cool and collected one.
“Of course not. The Dark Lord has no interest in that sort of thing.” Draco retorted. “Besides, he’s heir of only one founder. I’ve found an heir of Slytherin
“The Weasleys are
“…caraousing…”
“I didn’t know that.” Potter said, curiously.
“I’m not an heir of one of the Founders.”
“And live at Malfoy Manor during the week?”
“Well then. The heir of
. You’re
“I am.”
Harry frowned at him.
“Having glorious, uninhibited…”
“He’s…important.” Draco said.
He read the introductory page.
Potter snarled wordlessly at him.
“You look awful, mate.”
Jamie quickly fetched the potions, uncorking them for him when his single hand proved incapable. Draco quickly tipped one vial over his injured hand, watching as it formed a shiny coating over the ruined skin. A second and third potion he downed quickly.

“Oh, but they
Especially girls.
“Who?” Seymour breathed, sounding faint.
A little taller than him, inhumanly bright blue eyes, long blonde hair falling past the shoulders. The...was it a boy? A girl? The person regarded him kindly through a pair of sunglasses, liberally festooned with blinking and flashing LED’s.
Since some children have the foresight to exact specific promises from the parent who owns such a cloak, no such observation was possible.
“Weasley. Oh I’ve heard of your family, too! I’m Frankie. Frankie Longbottom. Wanna meet Phillip?”
Harry looked at him for a moment, then rolled his eyes heavenward and disappeared from the doorway.
Draco hesitantly smoothed the fabric of Harry’s sleeve, wishing he dared caress his face at this point.
“Cloud Zabini. I saw you come in with the Potter-Malfoys. Are you a relative of theirs?”
“And Potter will be yours.”
Then he carefully took off his robes.
Draco paused, examining the strange expression on Potter’s face just a couple feet from his own.
“I ssseee.” Voldemort sounded displeased.
inside in long, circular thrusts until all the burning was intensified with
“Meaning, illegal? Yes, I believe you’re right.” Draco smirked.
Step. Step. Step. Step.
Potter had, of course, been a long-absent member of this massive chess game. First James had incited controversy by marrying a mudblood, and then the two of them had gone into hiding under the Fidelius, and then been assassinated, and their only heir had disappeared into the Muggle world.
Below that group, in smaller print:
magic than either of them. Actual power is based on knowledge, however, and the boy is hopelessly ignorant.” Severus said carefully.
“Huh?”
Regulus tiptoed near his brothers bed and carefully took hold of the curtain to draw it back.
“Rules potion?” Harry asked quickly.
“Considering the timing.”
“Harry?”
“No. I’m a Slytherin. Slytherins are the clever ones that make the plans. Some people think we’re sneaky, because some of us make good spies. And the Ravenclaws…well, these students are Ravenclaws.” Draco waved a hand at the bookworms. “They’re intelligent too, but in a different way. They do research.”
“You’re teaching him Occlumency. And I’m pretty sure the Dark Lord doesn’t know it. You’re Dumbledore’s spy.” Draco said, stating it as a positive fact.
And then he heard Potter let out a roar as he finally came, surge upon surge of his magic firing into Draco in pulses, and Draco found himself collapsing on the floor under the waves of Potter’s magic, exploding in his own pants with each pulse…and then Potter was climbing out of the choppy bathwater, crawling naked towards where Draco had collapsed, dripping water and suds on him as he frantically separated Draco’s burnt hand from his wand.
Draco wished he hadn’t changed the charm.
“After reading that Chemistry for Dummies book…abominable title, by the way…I’ve decided to fund such a research project.” Draco said casually.
This time the ghost took a while to come up with something.
Something had moved. After so long, something had moved.
, Ron. I
“Oh, but Master Draco! The magic is so
Fenrir laughed.
“Fuck!” he exhaled into the back of Potter’s neck.
“Hi Lysander!”
, and neither do
“Burden Carrying” (a disgustingly physical muggle practice, for which I intend to substitute a Wingardium Leviosa)
The world shrunk around Draco and he looked over to meet green eyes, Harry also fully restored next to him.
The sweater did in fact have a warming charm, along with several others, including protection charms, luck charms, cheering charms, and…well, of
“It sounds like all of you are correct, in different ways.” Tom suggested.
The noise of a hundred some students hissing under their breaths as they read this was interrupted by the “thunk” of Harry Potter’s head hitting the table in despair. Draco looked over with concern just in time to see the doors to the Great Hall slam open and the Minister of Magic, Rufus Scrimgeour, strode in, accompanied by several Aurors.
“Then how do you explain it?”
“Placitum Perago” A chime sounded magically.
Harry frowned.
“Hmm. I thought so.”
in their cosmetic potions?” Draco asked, stunned. His own shampoo set consisted of five steps, one potion to clean his hair, one to serve as the basis for various styling spells, one to heal any breaks or brittleness, one to remove the harsh smells left by the previous potions, and one to imbue his hair with his trademark vanilla scent.
The atmosphere was tense as the First Year Hufflepuff boys prepared themselves for the ritual ambush and pillow fight that the Second Year boys traditionally sprung on their successor “sprogs”. It wasn’t a secret, exactly. Not even the ambush part.
“Potter did not die from the Curse, due to some ancient protection I don’t understand, and neither did you, because you are powerful enough to be immortal. As a result, your souls remain connected – you will have passed all your magical inheritances on to him as your heir, through his soul, as most of us receive this through our blood. Potter
Still. It didn’t do to sit around admiring house elves. Even such skillful ones as Dizzy.
Tom looked the other boy square in the eye. The duel would be easy, of course, this was no warrior before him. But, there was an iron in Heroditus’s eye, a solidness there that Tom knew would make him a truly worthy confidant, once his honor had ensured the kind of loyalty Tom could truly trust. He looked from him to Orpheus, feeling pleased with himself. Both were works in progress, but they each would have talents and potential that would be a pleasure to unlock and exploit, building them into the kinds of deeply loyal allies Draco had informed him must be his first priority in Slytherin.
things!” Kreacher whispered triumphantly.
Hopefully
Black has taken on dirty blood so close to the source, Draco! Our ancestral magics will be diluted!”
Their eyes widened as their dad put a fatherly hand on the strange boy’s shoulder.
The last he saw was Harry’s horrified face turning towards his aunt in absolute fury, and the thunderous magic blasting over his shoulder as his husband cast the killing curse in his defense.
“If it were the two of us, sure, that’d be no problem.” James said carelessly. “Without him…huh…I don’t know. I’d have to train you, and there’s not much time.”
Draco looked up into the green eyes. Honesty was so damnably difficult, no wonder his family tended to avoid it.
potions, right under our very noses! You know which cabinet that alarm is for, some of those potions could be dangerous in a student’s hands!”
“Harry Potter, will you marry me?”
“I just don’t get why you’re…look mate, he tricked you, alright? He used the whole courtship thing to get what he wanted.”
Potter, in addition to being Lord Potter, was also the Lord Black, as the chosen heir of Sirius. Although Sirius was not his blooded father, he was his godfather, with the magical connection forming a surrogacy in place of the standard blood bond, as was typical for confirmed godparents. And as Heir of Black, he would of course love Jaimie, as the only blooded child of Sirius, technically Potter’s magical sister.
Draco hesitated only a second before he pushed his hand into the churning cauldron, pain searing up his arm as it ate away his skin. The next incantation came out as an agonized scream.
“Mr. Weasley. I have targeted your children for vicious hexes, unkind jokes, and I have attempted to gain trouble for them at every turn. I have sneered at their clothes. I have made cruel comments at every opportunity regarding their lack of wealth, their number of siblings, their magical prowess. I have called your daughter a slut. I have taunted your son for being unworthy of his brothers and his friend Harry Potter. I have in every circumstance made known my assessment of your family as worthless and disgusting.”
She nodded in understanding.
“I can’t see him,” James whispered in disappointment.
“Yeah.” Harry said, looking dazed.
Nagini shifted, her coils holding Potter up to face Draco directly.
“It’s not the same!” Harry burst out, turning on Draco in fury. “I can’t believe you think I’d actually give up all my memories of the man who was like my father, just like that!”
“I am aware of the complexity, and confident.”
“I don’t want to be Dark.”
- - - - -
Draco laughed harshly, cradling his hand.
“I know you could have. You’re extremely clever, you had him wrapped around your finger from the minute he came over here at Sorting. And actually, you still do. So don’t waste it. Let me be the evil Malfoy bastard, I’m good at it. You’ll be able to pull on his Gryffindor sentimentality for something else. And this way, you’ll be doing him a favor by settling for the estate instead of what he thinks is really valuable.” Draco told her.
knew I were considering it, I’d be greatly embarrassed. So I would like your agreement to keep it quite confidential, whether you decide to help me or not.”
“She is learning quite well. I expect we can start looking for potential alliances for her rather soon.” He observed.
Dumbledore looked straight at the two students, then turned his head away deliberately, that annoying all-knowing twinkle in his eye.
together, Harry!” Draco said, intent.
Oh well, one couldn’t expect the Boy Who Lived to gain fashion sense all in one day.
“Sorry! So why did the Dark Lord want to pick on you if you were just a kid? I thought the only kid he was after was Harry Potter?”
“Oh.” Potter seemed to become somehow smaller in his chair.
“Oh no, my Lord. One Malfoy shall be ample proof of our support. I myself would ask a more intimate appointment.”
“What big question?” Harry asked.
“I don’t know what I mean either. It just feels so wrong.”
This beat the miracle of Diagon Alley hands down.
The diadem, in the quadrant opposite it, below the Dark Lord’s other arm.
give it to Helios before dinner.”
“They have really long hairy arms and their pillows are really big and hard!” Frankie informed him, gravely.
But Potter was, if nothing else, notoriously stubborn. He’d have to work on him some more later. For now, he inclined his head slightly to acknowledge the standoff.
Black!” the elf groveled eagerly.
Lucius nodded in realization. Once again, his old instincts to raise the wards and strike down any threat were proven to be the lesser of his ambitious son’s genius for co-opting the opposition.
Another sob.
The man was a disgrace to his house and knew it, a failure in all but the upbringing of his son – who had brilliantly rescued the Malfoy name and fortune from his own horrible miscalculations and then maneuvered the family into unprecedented prestige.
Draco smiled enigmatically.
Draco had clearly evoked his interest, and endangered a family secret. He put his hand on his wand to help focus him, allowed himself to snap into a momentary trance just long enough to open a tiny hole in his outer shields…letting the weaker probe slip in…then snapping the shields closed again like teeth, a very nasty counter-spell jolting up along the length of the probe and into the older man’s psyche.
founders will certainly qualify as an overriding prospect for Beneficium Superus. I hope you haven’t started negotiations before consultation from counsel.” Seymour said, all business.
“What did you bring us?” the boys immediately demanded once the greetings were complete.
“If we succeed.”
Draco reached forward and turned over the scrolls, finding the names inscribed.
“Just…the magic part of it. You know…when you touch me like
“Don’t worry about it mother, I know where they are.” Draco said dismissively, then leaned in to kiss his mother’s ivory cheek. Her hand rested on his arm, just above the elbow, thumb tensing inward between the first and second vein.

Cloud wasn’t deterred.
“No, not that. It’s. I would rather have it out to start with – the war was over our relationship with your world, and I grew up within and fought for the ideological camp that lost that war, with the result of us having this conversation now. Do you see? I was a, as you would say, a wizard supremacist. All my life, this was my core belief, and yet today, I find myself speaking comfortably to a muggle, feeling comforted by your unmagical hand. I, you cannot possibly understand the horror this had for me, near all of my life, and now, it is nothing. The things I sacrifices! The things I

“Oh. And he’s Heir to a Founder through his father!” Pansy gushed. “Imagine all that raw magic channeled into

“This
“Ugh. Just
, Harry?” Granger retorted.
“Wobbly.”
With the Oath settled and the goblin gone, Draco set a quick security bubble over the two of them.
And James wasn’t there.
Not necessarily far off the mark, really.
“But…but…that’s not what happened!” Weasley was imitating a fish.
“What recipe?”
He turned to his concerned Muggle friend.
perhaps Potter’s friends would know him well enough to be aware of the rituals that were proper to his status and bloodlines.
There was a long silence, which Potter broke to summon a rather familiar-looking house-elf to bring them popcorn of all things – a wizarding tradition that seemed rather out of place in their current circumstances. Draco held his silence, refusing the offer to partake in the autumn delicacy but leaving Potter to his eccentricities.
“Really, ‘
“Ta, Potter.” Draco paused as Potter walked away.
“No. Lucius ordered you to make yourself
of them onto his plate.
- - - - -
“I so swear.” Another loop of red.
“I understand, Malfoy.” Potter said quietly.
“Benedict. Yes, and a few others two, I’ve seen what I’m sure are some converted Muggle artifacts as well.” Murdoch said. “Yes Lord Malfoy, we can make some discreet inquiries. From what I know of the Muggle world, their traditions seem to be divorced from their technicalities, it’s likely the answers can only be found by questioning actual Muggles.”
The man shook Cloud in his outrage.
“Umm…that sounds like a really bad idea.”
It was yellow, with a non-moving picture of a man tinkering with some concoction in a glass beaker below a gaudy black banner bearing the title.
“You haven’t beat me yet Malfoy, try to keep up with the statistics, yeah?”
“Very well then. We shall be in contact regarding…wedding plans.”
Draco looked at where his two sons were deep in eye-to-eye communion.
“Three transfers, one from the Continent, Italy, one from America, New York, and one from India, Dharamsala. I think the American has potential to become a pretty powerful witch. Six orphans, two of which are Muggle-raised purebloods who are going to need some guidance in the wizarding world.”
“My Lord?” Draco asked politely.
“Because I’m making sure that Harry Potter will win. And you’re getting close to the sorts of secrets people get killed to keep.” Draco added meaningfully.
Lucius pulled out the jar clearly labeled 98:Cf and handed it to Jonas.
“May I ask the significance of that signal? I’m afraid I haven’t been taught that yet.”
’,” Draco let his first name drip with sarcasm, since he had no choice but to use it anyways, “we both know you’re not capable of transfiguring moss into a mouse, much less a Malfoy into a small rodent.”
The Headmaster’s eyes narrowed carefully for a moment, assessing him before the eyes twinkled knowingly.
“You’re Narcissa’s boy! Draconis!”
“I appreciate the consideration.” Thomas said, politely. He reached into his trunk and, yes, there ready to his hand was the promised book.
“~~The shelled creature looks delicious this way…~~”
“I believe that was
“Hmm. Interesting. Yes, I suppose that would do that, he seems a bit panicky, which the sopohorus would dampen a bit. Excellent work Mr. Malfoy. Ten points to Slytherin.”
“Lord Draco Malfoy-Potter.” Draco smiled at him and released his hand.
“Nobody’s here, let’s just give it to him already!”
…and then Harry was on him, rough fingers clutching around Draco’s waist and pulling him forward and Draco felt the silky heat of Harry’s penis pressing into the crease between thigh and groin and his own painful erection was rubbing against Harry’s soft, soft skin as the raw energy burned and burned and
Hermione frowned, “Actually I wanted to talk to you about him. When he wrote the note, I offered to involve him in researching it but he was very… he seemed to want to hand it off and forget about it. He said he’s made too many mistakes already and he trusts you two to deal with the Dark Lord. It seemed very… uncharacteristically humble. Draco, is your father quite well?”
“Your Weasley twins. They sell plenty of proximity-triggered hexes, now that I’m a friend of the family it was easy to have a combination made to order.”
Draco issued more instructions.
Harry leaned down, careful to keep from brushing against Draco’s flayed back.
“Got it, let’s go!” he huffed.
Draco watched a slightly smug grin slip onto Jamie’s face. She’d mentioned Granger on purpose, knowing it would distract the Slytherins from the bald-faced lie she’d rather clumsily uttered. They’d have to work on that, of course. Though her misdirection was admirable. But still…better that it’s not necessary.
“No! I can’t let all of Slytherin see me with
hereditary. And you are the only other known Parcelmouth living. The Killing Curse involves a close wending of souls, which normally terminates upon the death of the recipient.” Draco told him.
“I know many things you don’t know.” His mentor said scornfully.
Bill nodded, and opened the door to let a goblin in to administrate the Oath.
“I said
Lucius nodded and produced the canvas bag, the dark stain of blood clearly visible seeping through its bottom.
“That’s…no…that’s impossible.” Tom quavered, clutching the infant closer.
“We have to, Potter. We’ve gone too far, we have to pull back. We have been acting as if we were married in private, and it
“Very much mine.”
“Never fear, our lady damsels!
“My great-grandfather Longinus cheated your grandfather Gerald by-”
There was no escaping it. Rituals as ancient of Heirloom, Magic, Blood
Severus inclined his head in thought. While a young Harry, with the heart-rending green depths of Lily’s eyes set in the exact visage of his tormenter, had most certainly triggered a wash of old impotent loss and rage, he had deliberately channeled those feelings to improve his cover at the time.
Pansy was gazing at Blaise speculatively, however.
“What?”
James.
“Right there.”
Draco decided to fund a research project to develop the theory immediately.
Potter’s magic had recognized his.
“You put her in her place, all right.” Harry grinned.
“Potter is a Gryffindor, dear Aunt. Jamie is quite adept at using Potter’s feelings on family to her advantage, even if he doesn’t understand blood-ties.”
He felt warm, balanced, his magical core enriched by the incredible infusion of his husband’s raw strength held in the intricate latticework of centuries-old Malfoy magic…and the liquid heat of unfathomable Founders magic running like capillaries through the whole structure.
“Merlin’s College.”
Both men.
“Yes, I’m yours too, Draco.” He whispered softly.
Draco smirked, and reached down to open the small drawer to one side of the desk. He pulled out a narrow box of dark wood and placed it on the desk between them.
“Severus! What are you doing?” Draco protested.
“Yes. Yes I will.” Harry finally whispered back.
“Indiscreet? In front of me!?” Jamie glared at him.
“Convocoriri Heirus Malfoy”
“Precisely, my boy! But not just any combination. What were some good combinations in that match?”
The tiny table was suddenly crowded as the first course magically appeared.
why we had to wait until now. And if we hadn’t, we’d still be here today to get your fathers’ books.” Harry retorted. The ward was working…sort of. The path wasn’t exactly clear, but the crowd between them and the wandmakers’ shop was less closely packed now.
Was it his imagination? The hope that had sprung up started to fade.
Much smarter.
Draco felt the blood drain from his face as the page was revealed.
Draco sighed.
“That dog…it was Black’s animagus form?” Draco exclaimed in disbelief. He’d seen the creature too many times to count and never thought anything of it.
“Thanks, Lysander.”
“Keep your eyes closed, Harry. Just for a bit longer.”
!” Granger stammered.
“Why Potter, who would have known that you could clean up so nicely.” Draco greeted him warmly.
“He was so…so…powerful when I met him. And happy, he was always laughing and carefree.” He remembered.
“Okaaay…” Potter looked at him like he was one of Hagrid’s strange little beasts. “So?”
“We have a full kit.”
Draco sighed. He’d nearly forgotten about the movement of the more sacred Malfoy heirlooms currently going on in the house, his mother was doubtlessly frantic and paranoid with concern.
“See you tomorrow, Draco.”
“What?”
I can successfully court his contract, this union will be a powerful enhancement to Malfoys for generations to come.”
“What did they say?” Frankie asked, hesitantly.
“I should inform Pansy I’m ending my father’s marriage contract for me first.”
“You have successfully seduced him, then.” Voldemort gloated.
Draco looked at Potter for a minute. Then realized. The werewolf. Wolfsbane Potion. Right.
It was a sweater.
“Are you serious?” Blaise asked, stunned.
“Oh. Fine.” Draco thought for a minute, wondering if the house could read his mind. “What sort of secrets are in the sublevels?”
There was a light scuffing sound, like a shoe being scraped uncertainly against a stone floor, and then the door opened the rest of the way…a gasp as the boy obviously caught sight of the distractingly beautiful setting at the Head Table.
“And when the time comes, we will be wed, and you will be
“I think we are all well aware of the copy of him that remains.” Severus put in. “Draco, you are my godson and undeniably brilliant, so I will trust you when you say that this version was purified in the ritual and is no longer the Voldemort that was. That does not mean the same boy could not go down the same path.”
Was it when Draco offered to turn Harry to the Dark? When he said he’d make Harry use an Unforgivable on him?
Draco hoped that was the case. Pedophilia was one of the few sexual preferences that the wizarding world would not tolerate, even for someone like Potter, because it had the tendency of interfering with the child’s magical development.
“Well met, Orpheus. And, I don’t mind, Nott here had a question and I am as willing to give the answer to you as to him. Do you have a question for me? Beyond how to spare us all the sight of your cruder pastimes?”
“Bonded.” Draco corrected. “Just see that you do wait. In your room. No matter what.”
“What ever is wrong with sand-traps? Quite effective, I’d think. As much as I appreciate all the flashy effects of your wards here, I’m quite content with simpler ones that will prevent a thief from entering. In any case, the consultants I’ve hired are quite competent and trustworthy.”
“And do you also swear to withdraw the selected memories from your mind, and place them into a set of durable vials, and deliver them safely and discreetly to Draco Malfoy within one hour of this Vow?”
What was he thinking? How selfish could he possibly be?
Harry, of course we didn’t. You would have obsessed over it, don’t you try to tell me you wouldn’t. Draco took care of things like a reasonable person. You would have been afraid of it and afraid of yourself because that’s always been your impulse.” Hermione said briskly.
“But what is it?” Harry asked, looking distrustfully at the long, slender package.
“Well, yes. I’m not going to expect you to skip your NEWTS, of course!” Draco chuckled.
There.
“Malf-…Draco’s right. You don’t need his notice. But you shouldn’t call him the Dark Lord either. That gives him even more power than being afraid to say his name. Most people refer to him as ‘You-Know-Who.’”
?” he squeaked.
Draco nodded as he sat up, gingerly.
He sounded relieved.
Jonas started to smirk, then his eyes narrowed as the nitrogen began to froth and emit a slight glow.
Grabbing the boy by the scruff of the neck, he flicked his wand to open the washroom door and tossed him inside.
that would be.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
Harry looked rumpled and just-dragged-out-of-bed, as always, and Draco felt the sudden urge to pin the Gryffindor down long enough to see what a few neatening charms would do to his appearance. He offered the green-eyed boy a small scowl and received a grin in reply.
“Kreacher must obey Master Harry the filthy Half-Blood. Kreacher isn’t wanting to, but Master Harry insists.”
“I happen to know that Potter dreams of domestic bliss with a certain rival of his.” Draco smirked. “It’s simply a matter of turning them from empty dreams to a possible reality in his mind.”
“Of course, since I’m giving your
“Uh…they argue sometimes. And when Harry gets mad the air starts crackling and sometimes there’s wind and spontaneous levitation. I haven’t seen them hex each other or do any…you know, sex stuff.” Tom made a face.
Without Regulus at his side.
“Granger-Weasley,” Harry corrected his husband automatically.
As he spoke into the curly hair between Potter’s legs, Draco watched Potter’s penis moving…slowly…reluctantly…rising an inch with each heartbeat and falling a half-inch…rising and falling…tipping ponderously over to rest on Potter’s other thigh, hovering there on each heartbeat and coming down to rest farther along on an arc from the inside of his thigh…up the tops of his thigh…to point sideways along his hip…and then finally take its proud place pointing upwards towards Potter’s chin, bouncing an inch above his stomach.
“Ron?” Potter looked at his friend pleadingly.
Suddenly Potter’s eyes had opened and he was
The twins were arguing in furious whispers behind them.
CHAPTER
“Malfoy.” Zabini said formally, as he took himself from Draco’s room.
He rolled his neck from side to side before nailing Ron with an evil glare.
The boy had his head in his hands, but looked up at the familiar voice.
Draco swallowed. It had only been two generations, and she was only a Weasley by marriage. She should be the easiest to win over.
“I smell…there are
“Improper like what?” Harry giggled.
There was dead silence as the Notice-Me-Not charm Harry and Scorpius had been under melted away as all eyes were drawn to the shaggy-headed figure at the Head Table.
“No.”
“I dunno. He just feels like he’s waking up a bit.”
“Yeah!”
Still. Harry Potter’s equally unprecedented contribution to their bloodline would make up for his father’s horrendous decision on this matter, hopefully.
This was a maneuver he’d only ever seen his father and mother accomplish, and he’d been wanting to dance this way with Potter since he’d first tasted his magic that first day under the Invisibility Cloak.
Harry sighed and closed his eyes.
“Your father was Sirius Black. My mother’s name is Narcissa Black. They were cousins.” Draco told her.
Weasley.”
No, no. The Dark Lord had still been skeptical.
“Well…no. I’m an only child.”
“I CANT, Malfoy! Damn you, I would but I just can’t do it.”
And if Draco was going to consider changing sides, he wanted to be sure his current animosity with that blazing light was turned into something much more amicable first. A marriage relation sounded like an excellent start on that project.
“Draco?” Potter asked, unbelieviningly, his eyes staring up at Draco with complete betrayal in them.
“I don’t know. I know I was trapped in some place, I remember being there so long that it seemed like forever, but there wasn’t really a concept of
“That’s fine, Molly, I’m quite hungry actually. Harry and I would be happy to have lunch with you.” Draco said placatingly, while edging away, pulling his husband along.
“Was there any physical pull to go back to him, when you tried to leave with us this morning?”
“Didn’t you hear it? The house
“Draco…um…okay. So you got a bit creeped out.” Harry said gently, as if he were part of the psycho-ward at St. Mungos.
“My opinions and his will slowly merge to a centrepoint between us, weighted by the strength of our convictions. He has only even known of magic for a few years, and his experiences with muggles have been very unpleasant.”
“It’s better than to the death, I think. Ironic that your father put your family in this position in his effort at revenge, but I cannot do anything for that, I’m sorry.”
Heroditous Nott was a rather unfortunately skinny boy with stringy, brown hair. A bit unkempt, but the House of Nott had fallen upon hard times after the war.
“Slytherin, Thomas!”
Harry grumbled something and settled back on the bed the Room had conjured for him, watching Draco from amongst the pillows.
“I don’t know anything about metalwork. What are they, anyways?”
The goblin nodded in frantic agreement.
“Um. I’m Harry Potter. Sirius was my…my godfather. I didn’t know he had a daughter.” The last came out in a whisper.
The boys looked at their father with wide eyes.

of the scarab, despite being stirred in opposite directions. Understand, Potter? That acid would be boiling, and propelled in all directions. Right inside Professor Snape’s potions cabinet. Ruining all his work.”
Draco cut him off.
“Ready.” He said, breathlessly, unavoidably inhaling some more of that spicy scent.
“Well here, I’m sorry for scaring you, maybe you could give Phillip some nice reptile treats on me.”
“The Dark Lord does not, Draco. And he is by far the most powerful being in our world.”
Cloud quickly dispelled the enchantment, and the bloody plant dissolved into thin air.
The Slytherin table regarded him with guarded hostility as he approached.
Jamie gave him a calculating look before she obeyed.
first!”
The two barristers looked at each other fearfully. Clearly, wondering which side of the war they were on outside this office. The binding spell segregated their thoughts, they could only consider the matter of Malfoy, or of their own lives, but not at the same moment and never in reference to each other.
Draco studied his childhood friend, who was now his closest ally. He had been leaving Blaise out of his scheming of late, and the boy was clever enough to have noticed. And, no doubt, made various suppositions based on that fact. And perhaps modified his own strategic positions to reflect a perceived shift in their long-standing alliance.
it, reveling in the crackling strength that he could practically taste as it threatened to ruin his hair with static discharge.
Shacklebolt turned to scrutinize Draco carefully.
Diagon Alley was a beehive of insane activity.
“I’m not going to burn you at stake, Lucius. Or tell anyone. But…I think I need to sleep on this. I’ll be back, and I will have questions. So many questions. But…now it is all a jumble. I need to get away and…re-order my universe.”
“And I see that Allure has you very much in its grasp, too!”
“I think we can assume whoever instigated Heirloom, Magic, and Blood was quite sophisticated enough to calculate whether they could survive the magical levels of the honeymoon.” Blaise said dryly.
Draco’s legs squeezed his husband and his hands clutched desperately at his shoulders, his torso, the sides of his head as Harry moved in and his mouth was devouring Draco’s mouth and he was
“I so swear.” The final loop settled into place, and the three sunk invisibly into Professor Snape’s skin.
“I suppose it’s the same sort of thing. Only…hopelessly disgusting. Only a Muggle would think of carving their own flesh like that.” Draco shuddered.
“Why don’t we see how far you can walk?” Draco suggested. “Care to go with us to meet our guests?”
“Hurts…”
Draco approached, and slid the bag to rest immediately in front of the boy.
Draco felt his heart suddenly turn into a dead weight in his chest.
Arthur chuckled again. Draco was surprised to realize the man had a rather pleasant laugh. Was that the spell doing that?
“I’ll finish the ritual and we’ll get married, and notify the society papers of the new bond.”
Jamie nodded, and started to turn to the door, then stopped.
“DA members, get into the castle! Guard the younger students!” he shouted at the DA members.
“It’s called the Crystal Sceptre. It’s been in my family for 600 years.” He sneered at Weasley. “And it is
Harry recoiled in horror.
Tom spun out from under Harry’s hand and raced back to the bedroom, fumbling frantically with the doorknob before bursting inside to find the infant still safely asleep.
“You bonded him to
He waved his wand over the cauldron, causing its contents to swirl in the opposite direction.
Arthur Weasley nodded. His eyes full of tears.
“Protego! Petrificus Totalus!”
Two enormous swans, gliding in to land gracefully before the Golden Trio, each holding the end of a bright red ribbon in it’s beak, suspending the long, slender package between them.
“You’re already bonded to Malfoy?”
“Do you dare ssuggessst that your mere warrdsss could repel
“Beware of claims of objective truth. Convictions are worse enemies of truth than lies. A brief stroll through an asylum shows that faith proves nothing. Instead realize that all things are subject to different interpretations, and which interpretation prevails is a function of power, not truth. So beware, that when you declare someone an idiot, you will feel frustrated if they turn out not to be. Many fools remain faithful to causes for no other reason than that those opposing it continue to annoy.”
Regulus gave his new friend a shaky smile.
“Where is it?”
Tossing the box inside, Draco transfigured it into a comfortable pad that covered the stone floor of the small space, then crawled inside.
“Harry.” Draco choked out, his eyes shut tight.
“Will Molly Weasley be cooking?”
“He got himself killed saving Harry Potter, then Potter took over all his money. That’s why I’m poor. I don’t want to be in Gryffindor.” Jamie explained. “Can I go now?”
Cloud looked at him with bright eyes.
“The Dark Lord can’t know the full purpose of the spell. He is no Severus, but he knows potions and ritual properties. It must fully exceed his instinctual grasp of the situation or all will be lost.”
“Of course! Only, we couldn’t decide…”
“Yes.” Potter lowered his eyes.
Harry seemed to come back to himself then, his predatory grace turning to awkward shyness as he fumbled for something to say.
“…to kidnap you both!”
Harry looked upset at the question, but Draco nodded in approval.
“Either he assumed your line and one of the other branches of Black would merge, or he just didn’t care as long as
It was symbolic of the Malfoy reputation. Bad-faith. Twist everything for your own gain.
His Slytherins looked at him curiously.
“Not precisely. I would guess around one or two in the morning. Why do you ask?” Draco turned his head to see Potter staring at the back of his head as if contemplating something.
“What is it like, in your world?”
“I…I hope to convince you that I will be worth waiting for those things.”
“I know where they are.” Draco told him confidently.
“Harry, don’t ever try to give me fashion advice. You’re horrible at it. Now be quiet. I’m nearly done.”
“Now don’t be upset, young man. Many a set of twins has gone through these halls and not too many have ended up in the same house together.”
know! I bet
“We’re going to-” Jamie cut herself off.
“Almost…there.” Potter gasped.
“Potter.”
Harry looked at him.
Draco was suddenly seized with panic, pure fear that Harry had discovered his scheming and was now ending it, ending everything here and now. He seized Harry’s chin in his fingers and turned his face towards him.
Mrs. Weasley slapped a spoon firmly into his hand.

The older boys had been winking and grinning at the new additions to their house ever since their leader, a red-faced bloke by the name of Billy Haversham had casually informed them of their impending doom over dessert and told them they’d better at least put up a good fight or else.
“Merlin’s College was started in order to open a new frontier in our way of thinking about how the universe works on a very basic level. Einstein started mainstream scientists down this road when he propounded his Theories of Relativity, and many other highly-respected scientists have developed those loose theories into a much more evolved understanding of reality. But those scientists merely touched upon an area of study that is very, very old and was unfortunately disavowed by the scientific community for centuries.”
It was in Care of Magical Creatures that they appeared.
A surface ripple revealed Potter’s torso for just a second and he saw that Potter was touching his own chest, fingers moving across the sculpted skin in an absent-minded pattern.
“Our honeymoon…
“Avada Kedavra!”
At that, Blaise turned his head and met Draco’s eyes, shock and terror in his eyes. Draco gave him a tiny solemn nod. Blaise would have to choose soon.
Harry sighed and sat down on the edge of the bed, conjuring a comfortable rocking-chair for Tom to sit on across from them.
Severus studied him a moment.
“Escribamens Amicitia”
“Yeah but he’s your brother, you didn’t get to pick him, you just got born with him. So he’s different from a

“Thank you Zabini. Do you have anything for me?”

“So you won’t try to kill him, then.”
“And then?”
“Potter’s a Gryffindor, all he’ll care about is that they’re Light.” Pansy insisted.
“Okay, so we drink both of these and take turns asking questions?”
“Fine. See you don’t, Malfoy.”
“He’s here…” Potter hissed, and suddenly there was an explosion somewhere across the Hogwarts grounds, and students were suddenly running everywhere, the words “Death Eaters” being shouted frantically.
Tom was breathing hard from his momentary panic.
The pain was dimming. Apparently the nerves had been charred beyond functionality and it was just the surrounding nerves that were reacting now.
for herself?” Draco asked reasonably. “The dowry would, of course, reflect the value of your patience.”
Harry’s arms came around him from behind, and Harry was resting his chin on Draco’s shoulder.
For a moment nothing happened.
“Still. He’ll probably pass his Muggle fetish on to his children! It could still happen.”
“Did you see Draco? I’m a Slytherin too!”
“Let me see the note.” Granger said, then read it aloud. “For the very pretty boy in Madame Malkins, with the big green eyes…what?”
Cloud rolled his eyes.
“Oh. Who?”
He edged his way along the pillar carefully. He didn’t want to scare his new friend away.
“My understanding of the mechanics is limited. Suffice to say that a surreptitious magical test showed Potter to be full magical heir to the Dark Lord.”
“Something like that.” The smooth, cultured drawl said. “If several years of bitter rivalry can be classed as a kind of friendship.”
His godfather glowered at him for a moment before nodding.
Then the two adults each put a hand on a twin’s head, and together, they leaned into the bowl.
Harry looked defensive.
Harry gaped at the candles for a moment, then seemed to remember Draco.
“I never knew him. I grew up…you know…in the orphanage.” Jamie said quietly, eyes downcast. Draco watched her carefully. Was she really taken in so quickly? Perhaps he really should step in.
“My…position?”
“Yes. I am.” He said firmly. “I will call Granger right now.”
Potter jerked in surprise as Draco’s face blocked his field of vision.
“Oh!” Granger was turning as red as her Weasel boyfriend now. “Well, I mean, I don’t see how…surely they wouldn’t misuse the Prefects Bath for…that…?”
“I think you’ll be getting your vaults back pretty soon now.”
In the center of the room was a single table, upon which three scrolls appeared to have been placed with great care.
“I thought they decided what house to put you in when you got there?” Jamie asked.
a ssssymbol, young Lord Malfoy. Ssssymbols cannot be ssssimply ignored! Essspecially one that, to the average fool, ssseeems to offer hope of my defeat!”
Just a few more steps and he’d be decent.
“This is Tommy, he’s your age, and…he’s….uh….”
“He was mad.”
He didn’t sound upset, or even resigned…more like…wistful.
“You have to—“
“I don’t think I can be like you. I’ve watched you, you know. As much as you’ve watched me. You play games. With people. Use them, like Ron does chess pieces.”
“Oh.” Tom said. “I guess…it wasn’t good.”
“Potter!”
[Summon the witnesses]
The boy frowned.
“What’s going on in here?” The door swung open and there, at the threshold, stood Harry Potter, wand in hand, with Draco Malfoy ready for battle at his side.
“Am I going to have to get creative with a blindfold charm on you?”
Draco scowled at him, but had to concede the point.
Draco smirked.
“So Edgar…you know what happens next? Once they’ve all found their victim, and he’s standing over you with his big, hard pillow in his long, hairy arms, raised up ready to strike…and the leader….he gives the signal…and WHAM!”
spell, so I suppose this Tom is from before Hogwarts.”
“Don’t worry, look!” Potter said into Draco’s ear, causing him to shiver again. That damn “aftershave” was messing with Draco’s head again.
“Well no, it wouldn’t be. The Ministry took her at birth, Sirius never even knew of her. She showed up at Hogwarts to be sorted this Fall. I have, of course, begun teaching her proper pureblood culture, which she has been denied by her upbringing.”
There were more than one reasons Harry needed to keep his eyes closed, Draco thought, tugging on the boy’s arm to help him sidestep a rose petal. Just a few more steps and they’d be there.
Harry had gone completely silent behind him. His hand no longer absently rubbing Draco’s stomach.
“I need to talk to you about something important.”
“That sounds like a name for a circus animal.”
“Grandfather Lucius?” Tommy asked quizzically.
for this.” Harry said breathlessly, between kisses.
to attempt anything with the Pensieve without one of us there to guide you. Understand?”
“Can you just…maybe…hug me for a minute?”
shouldn’t be kept waiting.” Arthur protested. He turned to Draco, expecting him to confirm his impatience.
“Entertain Severus for now, Mother. I have some family business to take care of first.” Draco smiled at his mother reassuringly.
With a swirl and a shout they were all spat out onto the carpeted floor of the library.
“Harry. We have to finish the ritual.” He pushed at his husbands shoulder. Harry groaned in protest. “Harry,
! We can’t raise two children there!”
“Mrs. Weasley. I’m Draco Malfoy.” He offered. His arms were still firmly clamped by the evil twins, so he didn’t have to shake her hand.
“I will turn him.” Draco said.
“Another boy! This tall, black hair, he had a wand and said he’d adopted Scorp as his brother and we couldn’t be his brothers anymore!”
“What?” Potter seemed quite startled by the question. “I think she was planning on university.”
“Of course.”
Harry nodded, but still watched the twins. They squirmed nervously under their gaze. Somehow, their Daddy seemed to see right through most of their schemes.
“So open it Harry!” Granger urged.
“I so swear.” A loop of fiery red magic encircled the professor’s wrist.
Harry talked like he was in a trance, his voice wavering,
“It wasssss a foolisssh plan, to ssssneak into the nursssery during ssssssleeping time.”
“Great. The one time I get my fiancé all to myself away from nosy schoolmates and Rita Skeeter, some perverted old house means we can’t do anything here.”
“Um…Frankie…your turtle is growing…uh…neon pink…uh…hair.”
Harry squeezed his shoulders.
The young woman looked amused for a moment, leading him into a private alcove withdrawing the device from a small bag hanging from one shoulder.
“They’re both high-energy forceful spells, and Incendio requires your wand to point down after until the flames are gone so they can’t be bounced back at the caster.”
~Severus Snape~
Which explained the low rank Severus had in the enemies list. Right below Draco’s own position on the list. He may be on the Light side, and thus an ally to the Boy Who Lived, but was a personal foe of Harry James Potter.
“I couldn’t actually destroy it like the others. Not without…destroying
“Potter. Please try to pay attention. Memories of her father, remember? They’re a vital ingredient for the Childhood potion to give her a sense of the wizard. Do try to select the better memories, will you? I don’t think Jamie needs to remember her father’s death for example. You claim to have looked on him as a father, so those are the memories she’ll be needing to establish her sense of belonging in the Black line. Are you even listening Potter?”
ago?!?”
“Now. Look at your Blood gift, Potter.”
“This cloak isn’t meant for two people.” Potter said, placing Draco’s hand on his hip. Draco carefully put his other hand on Potter’s other hip. He could feel Potter’s stomach muscles twitching at the tips of his fingers.
worthy, Lord Malfoy!”
Scorpius was crying.
“I promise, this is for your own good Harry.”
“Shit!” Potter whispered in Draco’s ear.
“Are you going to Hogwarts?” James asked brightly, interrupting the solemn moment.
“Well, I guess I just have to accept that when you tell me things that sound insane, I should trust you because it’s your realm of expertise. Insanity, that is.”
“I’ll give you the literature you need as soon as I finish up your husband’s checkup.”
first year, ‘Mione. You never know, with them it could be some kind of initiation.”
Harry’s face was streaming tears now.
Draco met his eyes.
Clearly, it would be something designed to make him fat. Possibly chocolates. Draco cursed as his mouth watered at the idea of fudge made by Molly Weasley. The woman was a menace.
“I’ve got it. Easy, really.”
“Am I presumptuous to assume you had been raised outside the Slytherin traditions?”
Potter just clenched his fists and didn’t answer. This was too good.
Their fathers guided the boys to stand between them before the great stone bowl.

“Are you willing to try?” Harry asked.
Pansy gave a little laugh then.
“Stealing’s pretty serious business.”
“You said that…” Harry consulted his watch “two

They were also both masters of their expressions since toddlerhood. There was no revelation in Blaise’s brown eyes, and Draco was sure his own face gave away nothing.
. This one is for just us, remember?”
Draco smirked at her.
“Even as his Right Hand, you would have still been a slave, wouldn’t you?”
Harry sighed.
Draco was an odd sort of uncle to Potter.

, Ronald, I don’t even know why I bother sometimes.”
“Right, and I’ll try not to insult her friends right away either, dear,” Pansy reminded him sweetly.
“Oh my god what did Phillip eat?”
“Well who else would it be?”
Scrimgeour looked nervous again, but the Head Auror had a stubborn look on his face.
Draco clenched his jaw at the happy, encouraging look on his boyfriend’s face, and carefully unwrapped the gift.
The Aurors set about putting a chair in the center of the room, and Draco was unsubtly “encouraged” to sit in it. The Aurors lined the walls, except for Shacklebolt, who sat next to Dumbledore to the front of Draco.
“What are you doing?” Harry asked nervously. “What wedding prank!”
“The…the Dark Lord has expressed an interest?” Seymour asked, face pale.
The sound of water sloshing around beyond the fog made him draw his lips back in anticipation.
Draco dragged the body of Nagini over and placed it in the remaining quadrant.
“Hey!”
Granger’s eyes narrowed craftily.
“Are you okay? Madame Pomfrey should be here any second.” Harry asked anxiously.
The scroll was the older project. Fitting to view it in it’s completion first. Then the peak into the darkest recess of Potter’s mind, for the details the scroll was sure to miss, he decided.
“No?”
know whether Harry Potter would be safe to continue this…this thing you have initiated. You are a Dark Wizard. How can I possibly trust you.”
Harry came flying backwards and landed on Draco, knocking them both back into the alcove he’d placed himself in front of. Draco immediately buried his nose into Harry’s neck and took a deep whiff of that delicious “aftershave” potion he’d become addicted to lately.
“Would you care to explain?”
“Well…he has to, right? He’s eleven.” James said slowly, as if stating a painfully obvious fact to a moron.
Potter landed hard, sprawling on the floor.
Draco stopped pounding the fallen bureau and huddled on the floor, another low moan of anguish escaping his lips.
“So you don’t get along?”
Flint looked marginally pleased. The exchange was an old one but still common among purebloods, an old code for wizards to recognize each other in the world of Muggles. It was among the basic mannerisms Draco had drilled into Tom and his brothers.
“Royal weddings are always on battlefields, Harry. They’re too important to be draped in flowers and lace.”
“Professor Dumbledore?” he asked, confused.
Tom looked up into the big green eyes, so like Scorpius’.
“Not Thomas?”
“I know. Believe me I know. But it’s the best I can do.”
exciting.
“Hermione, then. Please call me Lucius.”
Draco staggered to his knees on the floor beside his workbench, heaving.
“Life-Debts” (Of course, this would be inappropriate, since calling in a life-debt during a marriage negotiation indicates a form of slavery rather than an alliance)
“He laughs like someone who hasn’t in years.”
to logically rule out certain suspicions.” Draco told him calmly.
“The boy on the platform didn’t like my name…the people in Slytherin are like that?” Tom asked.
His blood ran cold.
The twins looked at where the other boy had been, jaws dropping as they found he’d disappeared.
He looked around gravely at each of his year-mates.
“Just a minute Potter.”
“You met Jamie before the Sorting?” Weasley asked, surprised.
Cloud looked past him to where Thomas had darted in and swooped up the infant Scorpius into his arms, and was now cooing at him with a completely carefree grin on his face.
He looked up, noticing the silence for the first time.
Potter may have refused the symbolic bond of the ring, but he was still bound by his word.
“It works on everyone else,”
Sweet vengeance. And he had yet to even use the scroll in his pocket.
Five minutes later Draco arrived in the Slytherin compartment.
Professor Snape sneered mockingly.
Draco had taken it literally, as a precaution against allowing Potter to grow powerful enough to eventually take revenge for years of antagonism. But now the phrase had a backhanded double-meaning.
“Draco…you need to look at this…”
Jamie showed him the anklet resting against the top edge of her shoe.
“Great. Now it looks like you’re all getting to know one another, which is great. You older students should try to circulate and make sure the new kids know who you are. If anybody wants to talk, I’ll be in my office behind that door right there. Don’t be afraid to knock.” Harry said, pointing at his office door as he moved toward it.
, Potter. Is that the problem?” Draco asked sweetly.
“My Lord, your knowledge in other branches of magic is unmatched, I had not known any instruction was necessary.”
“There are other ways. But that spell is one no pureblood will dispute.”
Of course. Draco could almost hear the lesson in his father’s voice now. “Never rule out a possibility. A Malfoy is never caught unawares. A Malfoy has a plan in place for every possible outcome, no matter how improbable. Those who are caught unprepared reap their rightful reward, and good riddance.”
“And then they dessssstroyed the other headssssss.”
“Harry, no.” Draco said, alarmed. A knot of absolute dread was building in his sternum, and he found he couldn’t swallow properly.
“You’re right on one thing, Draco. I do love you. And I do want to marry you, too, once I know I can trust you.”
Draco frowned as he noticed the lion didn’t seem to move. Muggle.
Draco waited for his grandfather’s reply, then gave it voice, his own voice coming out sounding stunned.
And now, thanks to Potter’s actions, Draco had the clear mind he would need to make sure that Potter’s entry into that family happened in a way that was beneficial
Weasley looked chagrined.
“Brooms again?” Harry grunted.
“Potter. Trust me, okay? I need these working, and it’s very complicated. But everything I’m doing is to help you, so that we can get married as soon as possible. When the time comes, you’ll understand. But until then, I need you to trust me.”
Draco cursed his quick mouth. Shrugged elegantly.
“Remember, being powerless makes you contemptible, which is disgraceful. That is why every visionary who has been armed has been victorious, and each one who was unarmed was killed. It is much more secure to be feared than loved, if you cannot be both. But to inspire fear, if you must injure someone, be sure it is severe enough that you need not fear vengeance. So either treat men generously or destroy them.”
“What. Is. Wrong with you, Malfoy!” Potter hissed, reaching for his own wand.
Then he proudly presented the infant to her.
“Very well. I’ll come.”
Back straight.
“We’ll have a lifetime for you to learn how to be a better Slytherin. For now, I’ll be the Slytherin for both of us. Because you

“Romancing Real Life”...looked like a possibility at first, but quickly turned out to be a guide for maintaining the marital relationship during the hubbub of grinding daily life as a muggle, which Draco and Potter would most certainly not be dealing with
Weasley looked defeated.
Draco leaned forward and kissed the other thigh, a couple of inches higher this time, using his full mouth this time so his warm breath would burn Potter’s flesh, which bore goosebumps from the night air.
“Harry, don’t say that. It’s
loophole still required Notice to the other family, but his barristers had dug into the law and found that such Notice need not be public, and could be given to the promised party herself rather than to the head of the family to be legally sufficient.
“Harry, let’s get out of the water before the shrinking spell times out.”
.” Draco said, spinning to walk towards the hospital wing with his friends.
As was custom, Draco found something wrong about every room he entered, and soon the full contingent of Malfoy houseelves were busy, frantically scrubbing, polishing, sweeping, warming, cooling, painting, remodeling, rearranging, and, of course, simultaneously self-flagulating.
“You’d have state-of-the-art facilities, of course. I’d have a reasonably sized lab built according to your specifications, incorporating the very best of wizarding equipment and muggle technology. Then I suggest a research time of five, counting yourself. Two muggle chemists…preferably squibs unless we can get a special permit to get around the Statute of Secrecy. And two potions experts. And yourself, since you appear to know a bit about both.”
“My dear, there are simply things you do not yet understand. Do try not to get yourself too attached. Your father made the same mistake with James Potter, I’m afraid, and it quite ruined him.”
“I would never hurt him.
Draco sighed. Well, it couldn’t be perfect, could it?
Draco made his way to his room and found the regal eagle owl waiting for him. He sighed as he retrieved the black envelope from its sharp claws.
“You did. I felt it was wise to be sure.” He sneered, gliding into the room.
“I am
“~~May we eat the shelled creature?~~”
“Perhaps you would like to hold him?” Draco suggested.
Potter looked up at him, startled.
“That…hurt.”
Draco kissed his hand.
“The wards
“Um…he used Reducto and Incendio as a combination.”
Draco ground his teeth. He knew very well the Lord Lucius Malfoy and his father were two very different people. Nobody else, except perhaps his mother, was likely to agree with him on that, though.
“Draco. Grimmauld is

Granger that
“Only Placitum Perago, Weasel. Not a hex.” Draco informed the Gryffindor.
Nor was the center. A large lightning bolt, stretching from a Dark Mark at the top of the parchment, down to the portrait of Potter at the bottom. His connection with the Dark Lord was a point of vulnerability then, along with his protective heroic streak.
“Did you pack plenty of underwear and socks?”
And stared.
“You may,” Dumbledore said, gravely, and the Sorting Hat was lifted from her head.
Then…
He withdrew his wand and pointed it at the water, whispering a charm that had served him well in his early adolescence.
“What are you doing here?” he demanded.
Draco paused for a long moment.
“Harry,” Draco had a suspicion where this was going, and didn’t like it.
“I…I think I’d like to know about my father. But,” Jaime looked up and surveyed the Gryffindors, naked distrust written on her face. “maybe if…Draco could come too?”
Across the room, Regulus continued to stare at his brother, and Harry could see he was deeply hurt by James’ easy acceptance of and adaptation to the new situation. Even worse was when Regulus’ little mouth pulled itself into a bitter grimace and he turned stiffly away from his twin, not to join in the boisterous conversations around him but to apply himself mechanically to his meal.
“Ronald! I thought you’d agreed there’d be no more name-calling. He’s gone to great lengths to make peace with your family.”
And certainly, keep working to complete Potter’s scroll.
“But he has to know his
The boys instantly silenced themselves.
“Maybe I’ll let you feed Scorpius sometime, if you prove yourself worthy.”
OH, AND YOU RONALD BILIOUS WEASLEY, ARE NOT OFF THE HOOK! I KNOW YOU’VE GOT TO BE UP TO YOUR UNWASHED LITTLE EARS IN ALL THIS AS WELL! YOU’LL BE HEARING FROM ME WHEN YOU GET HOME IN A FEW WEEKS! HARRY MAY NOT HAVE THE UPBRINGING TO KNOW BETTER BUT YOU HAVE NO EXCUSE! I’LL BE WRINGING BOTH YOUR NECKS AS SOON AS I CAN GET MY HANDS ON YOU!
“Pretend. We’re here for negotiating, remember?”
“Oh, it’s nothing, Dragon, just thinking how time flies, and how you look so much like your father.”
Draco let a small smile tug his lips, watching him flounder, face turning redder by the second.
“It was an assymetrical energy exchange, resulting from a unilateral sexual event between two magically attuned but unbonded cores.” Draco said, leaning back and closing his eyes. He was still dizzy and definitely shaken from the near-catastrophe.
Jamie giggled.
“OH please don’t do
“I know all about your prophecy.” Draco waved a hand dismissively. “I took that into account when I planned everything. That’s part of the reason why we can’t be seen together.”
Actually, Draco wasn’t all that fond of all the bowing and scraping that seemed to go on in Death Eater meetings. Or Cruciatus, for that matter.
that, Potter?” He finally demanded.
after…after…
“I hadn’t planned to broach this subject with you Potter, at least, not until you had matured into your position a bit more.” Draco said calmly.
“I…want you to be able to trust me, Harry.” Draco said, his voice oddly raspy in his throat.
“Just a few hours, with that potion.” Draco said, not mentioning that the high-powered healing potion he’d bought for this purpose was also Dark, as it required skin flayed from a prepubescent vampire. Usually willingly, actually. A prepubescent vampire might still be over a century old, after all, and vampires as a group had a very different view on pain than humans did.
Draco just sniffed loudly to express his outrage and swirled his robe around him as he stalked away, steadfastly ignoring Harry’s ringing chuckles behind him.
But after a moment, Harry gave a quick press of his hand.
“Invisibility cloak. Tent-frame.” Draco said tersely, transfiguring the string into a roughly rectangular structure that would sit very low to the ground. Just enough room for two people to sit in, legs folded.
“In all sorts of exotic locations!”
The Manor told him.
And then, only then, Draco Malfoy exploded.
Draco considered his mother. She was right. Well, partially right. The wooing she had witnessed was the most recent one, involving both of Potter’s parents. It would form a basic map of explanations. But Potter’s Muggle upbringing would likely be somewhat different from what his parents would have provided.
“As this particular Draught is rather volatile, I will be assigning you in pairs to hopefully prevent
Harry seemed to sober, a tentative look on his face as he waited for the inevitable tantrum.
“What do you mean?”
. However, the nature of my gifts are such as to not only be valuable gifts to Harry, but also to allow
The boys shivered and nodded. Their father had a careful, enunciated way of speaking about grave matters that made the whole world seem to weigh more than usual.
Jonas lifted his hand away, watching Lucius carefully as he struggled to maintain the face appropriate to a mere acquintance.
“Hey, Malfoy.”
“I hate the ferret, mate. But he’s got a point. She’s his daughter,” the redhead shrugged.
“Masssster assssked us to invessssstigate the Other.” The Planner said.
Blaise nodded. The Dark Lord would be eager to regain access to the Malfoy family vaults and artifacts: Draco could take up his father’s former position any time he chose.

that he gave me. His power. This connection to him. When I’m in his head, sometimes it’s
“nocturnal emissions”.
Draco knew he had some thinking to do. All his life, he’d been taught that the Dark Lord would one day return, and that Draco would one day take his father’s place as his right hand. Lucius had apparently believed the Dark Lord to be immortal, no doubt due to his own scrying. And he had been sure that the House of Malfoy would benefit from a close association with the powerful wizard.
“Oh! I have it here.” Potter took a tiny book from his pocket and unshrunk it before handing it to Draco.
be scared. This is a very serious matter that we are entrusting you with.” Draco said in his serious voice. “And…I mean it when I say you should tell no one.
“Luuciusss. I hope you have a very good excusse for entering unannounced and unssssummoned.” Voldemort hissed at them from the throne set on the dais between two staircases. Draco stiffened in outrage as he noticed that the family coat of arms had been covered up by a banner depicting the Dark Mark, behind him.
He looked down at Scorpius and felt a soft smile warming across his face. What with Tom's intense protectiveness, he hadn't had the opportunities to hold Scorpius that he'd like. The drowsy warmth of the infant cradled in the carrier on his chest was a feeling he’d dearly missed since the twins had grown up.
Draco was on his knees, trying to catch his breath, his body feeling weak and useless with the magic that had sustained him his entire life suddenly stripped away entirely.
Draco sighed.
tool for a prefect, if anything! Why, if Draco had had the use of such a device back in his Hogwarts days he could have single-handedly put an end to all those late-night wanderers and troublemakers that seemed to trouble the student population so.)
“Granger been sinking her hooks into you, Potter? The old magic isn’t really up-to-date with the latest feminist propaganda, it really wouldn’t work with a girl. And even if you were willing to transfer the title to
Draco leaned back, stood up, and smirked down at him.
Arther Weasley paused, then seemed to come to a conclusion.
“What?”
“Please, Potter. How Muggle of you. How would such a conversation do anything but make her wish she could have known him. This way she
“James is in Hufflepuff.”
“Despite the fact that Harry Potter happens to be married to the gorgeous Draco Malfoy?”
There was a very protesting noise from Weasley, which Granger promptly quashed with a hand over his mouth.
Jamie’s laugh was musical as she assured him that it had been a splendid holiday but that she was glad to be home.
Snape opened the door and turned towards Draco, a displeased look coming across his face as he took in Blaise’s presence behind Draco.
! And that’s no fun at all!”
“It would.” He allowed. “However, if we were caught, he would find a way to kill us both.”
All three boys brandished their wands.
Harry shook his head in denial.
Bill nodded, a curious look on his face.
?” Blaise repeated, his eyes wide.
“How very interesting to meet you for a second time, young Tom! Not quite the same lad, though…interesting story there. I can see that this time you are aware of quite a bit more…and have far more to live for as well! But still that thirst for power…beware that, my boy. Power itself is not a bad thing but to hold it above all else…well, many have met an ugly end that way.”
“Yes. He has yet to understand its potential use, of course. And his Magic gift was a powerful Dark talisman soaked in my own blood, which will grant him some measure of protection from hexes.”
Draco leaned back then, carefully aligning Potter’s penis with his own entrance, hissing at the stretching and the burning as that most intimate of all possible contacts caused Potter’s magic to rush powerfully into his own core.

The teasing look on the Gryffindor’s face died away instantly and Draco felt a spark of that lustful magic snapping at his hand.
“Ch-ch-chastity spell.” Draco told him, backing away as Harry came to him for warmth. “No. We need distance or it’ll get colder.”
“Prolixe arbiter Severus Snape” Severus intoned carefully.

Severus frowned.
“Mr. Potter, I need you to take your hand away from your nose, please.”
“What?”
Draco pointed his wand into the cauldron and spoke the first spell.
“I can’t possibly be powerful enough-” he objected.
“I…for a couple years, yes. After he escaped from Azkaban. He was like the father I never had, for a little while.”
“Tom Riddle, as I live and breathe. How are you standing in my shop?” he gasped.
But what to do about it? The parents clearly hadn’t been thrilled to learn of their son’s protector. The two little thugs who’d woken the child had been downright hostile, in fact.
“Jamie! You missed half the presents!” Harry called.
Now it was Potter’s turn to stare at Draco in shocked awkward silence.
?!” Ron burst out “I can’t believe she said all that! I’m never going to…er…
Or at best the hiding knight.
“Professor McGonagall was the one who called my name out, I did not.” Tom told her coolly.
Draco watched with dread as an entirely too realistic bolt of green light trickled back along the line and created a lightening-shaped symbol next to the portrait. The portrait shuddered and cringed away from that side of the scroll, holding a hand over his scar…blood leaking out between his fingers?
“Nineteen thirty-seven…” Tom said, but his voice wavered with uncertainty.
“He hasn’t bothered with taking a wife.”
“Thisss is something you shhhould have been alert for, Luciussss! I keep you at my sssside to take note of detailssss I have no time to ponder! Crucio!”
, Potter. And most
“I suppose…I should be very sure about the security of the new locations before moving my gold there. That would be, perhaps…rash.”
But Potter seemed convinced of this.
Hissyfit chose that moment to lift their heads out of James’ collar and steal his punchline.
The Dark Lord laughed his horrible, hissing laugh again and Draco looked up at the snake-like figure.
“Huh, so if we use water, that’s helium or two, and oxygen or eight, which puts us in a base-six-plus-two mathematical system. Ugh, that’s going to get real complicated, real fast.”
“In the future, Potter. If I ever am so stupid as to take you into my confidence again, I expect to be consulted before you inform anyone else.” Draco said tightly.
“Father. I know you regret your actions, and Severus was a spy for the light. But you both still bear the Dark Lord’s magic in your marks. Magic that Tom here is intimately familiar with, and not in a positive way. I could not risk your involvement, even indirectly. Bonding magic is very sensitive.”
“He’s the one who bit you.” Draco realized.
“Who?”
“Yes. Shortly after rescuing me from the curse the Dark Lord had used to imprison me for several years. They’ve been preparing me to re-enter the world for several months now.”
Harry took the missive with a trembling hand, and cracked the seal.
“What…what do you mean?” he asked, weakly.
“I don’t see how something like that could interact with childish admiration, the ingredients are in entirely different categories. It’s possible, but only with considerable machinations to convert between them. I don’t see how that could trigger it accidentally.”
“But what did you promise? Exactly, Heroditus.”
“Severus. Nothing to be done about it, I think. It’s fortunate the door was locked, or we would have been in the midst of that.” Dumbledore soothed the distraught Potions Master until the explosions subsided.
“You spoke of secrets.”
Why had the Hat separated them? That was surely an awful thing to do to both of them, he thought. Would someone try to separate him from Scorpius one day?
“Let me know when you feel a weird buzzing chill at your extremities, it’s the warning signal.”
“That would be a secret between my father and myself.” Draco told him confidently.
An hour later, Potter’s hand was noticeably shaking as he held the small sample of Confusing and Befuddlement Drought in his hand.
“The One with the power to vanquish the Dark Lord approaches. Born to those who have thrice defied him. Born as the seventh month dies. And the Dark Lord will mark him as an equal, but he will have a power the Dark Lord knows not. And either of them must die by the hand of the other, for Darkness shall reign while both of them survive.”
“Is that what you want, Jamie?” Draco asked her, putting the game back in her hands.
, Potter…the Glumbumble reinforces and thickens the glass of the vial, causing the dragons blood to be more compressed and heat up more, further thickening the glass, and so on, until eventually the entire mixture is solid…and very, very, hot. When it reaches that point, it shatters.”
their first rite of passage, Harry. It’s good that they are so close, now they have to learn their separate strengths.”
Lovely. He’d been meaning to get some quality time with his dear Aunt for quite some time now.
“I hope so. He will need your guidance, too, Severus.” Draco told his godfather, who nodded in acceptance.
“Yes. I’ll stay right in here.” Draco told her.
“Slytherin House is named after Salazar Slytherin. One of the four Founders of Hogwarts. A
“Come on in Hermione,” Harry called out.
Draco crossed over to his husband and knelt next to him, taking his hand.
The bulge stirred, pressing back against Draco’s cheekbone as he rubbed his face against the crotch of Harry’s pajama pants.
Molly Weasley turned on her husband, a glint of something in her eye.
Harry pulled back and Draco found himself kneeling, perfectly still, eyes closed, not wanting to dispel the taste of Harry that lingered on his lips.
Jamie giggled.
“Diffindo! Langlock! Petrificus Totalus! Stupify!”
Before Draco could halt the stream of his magic powering the spell he felt a sudden tug along the spell’s line of force, and his magic was pouring out of him more strongly, feeding the spell and something
Heirloom, Magic, and Blood usually required a contrived meeting between the two children being contracted for, and the salutation of the Heirloom gift was normally the sole input from the suitor-child in the process.
“You were right. The Dark Lord is powerful. Very powerful. I’d like an update to which of his protections he’s managed to rebuild since his rebirth.”
“Well, I’ll be sure to Obliviate them after I remove their bits.” Draco said confidently.
Potter looked at Draco, closed his eyes, and swallowed the potion.
Well. Time to see this long-awaited little brother.
Potter had a crush on his best friend’s sister. So that was the source of the heavy angst clouding Potter’s emotional status. Hopeless, because Potter had said publicly many times that he regarded the Weasley’s as his family. And, by extension, Ginny as his sister. And no doubt, Potter would think it a horrible thing that he was having lustful fantasies about his best friend’s younger sibling. Thinking her
smart!”
“Will this take very long?”
It didn’t budge, and Draco found himself hurling his shoulder into the heavy oak door, rocking it back against the wall and bouncing back. This time his tug produced results, the massive structure teetering on an edge and slowly…slowly, falling with a crash that shook the room.
“Look. I really would like to get to know Jamie for myself. She’s my godfather’s daughter, doesn’t that give me some kind of--”
“This is what you get for putting it off to the last minute.” Draco informed his husband, who was laboring to control a subtle pushing ward that would hopefully gain them a clear path to Ollivanders.
Scorpius was fine.
Then Molly Weasley found him.
“Ronald! That’s exactly what I’m talking about! How can two people come to really love each other as equals with a spell like this hanging around their neck? Harry, you agree with me, right? This would ruin any romance you could hope for with him!”
Draco smirked.
It burned.
He pulled up his left sleeve and there, where the Dark Mark had previously gone dormant for eleven years was an irritation of tissues in the same shape of the skull and snake.
“My Lord. The Blood gift is traditionally a powerful enemy of the family whose son is being courted.”
if we were separated, and couldn’t survive each other’s death! Like the most profound soulmates, where we can’t survive without each other.” Harry said dreamily.
“Not at all. Look, I have this book, Hydroelectric Power for Dummies, that explains it all…”
Draco looked at the entire scroll again. Now he thought he could tell the difference between magical artifacts and glamour at a glance. And…what was that…an active spell to keep rain off. And that appeared slightly different than a listening spell there, or a customized Protego worn against the skin there. The old man had a lot of protections and spells around him. Draco ignored them.
“Oh yes! A very simple thing! These consultants…the wards they would have made would make
“I haven’t asked you for your
Draco focused on one of the glowing circles around Dumbledore. A talisman, a small pin worn over the heart. It had the effect of deflecting any heart-stopping curse. Draco looked at another one. A glamour, over his eyes apparently, to make them twinkle good-naturedly at all times.
Draco reeled as his back was suddenly flayed open by the spell.
“Scorpius, this is my new friend Cloud Zabini. Cloud, this is my brother Scorpius.”
~Tom Riddle~
“Sir?” Tom said, not understanding the tension.
“YES! Yours, all yours! And you mine!”
Potter looked at him, confused.
“I thought you’d made peace with the Weasleys?” Harry asked, confused.
Not deigning to yell through the house (it was, of course, acceptable for the lady of the house to call out to the Lord, as it indicated their eagerness to see the Lord return to his domain), Draco took the main staircase to the second floor, his footsteps measured, dignified.
Pomfrey’s other eyebrow joined the first as Harry meekly came over to sit on the bed beside him.
No. The Malfoys should be on the winning side. Even if that meant making nice to Potter.
Lysander shook his hand enthusiastically. “Hey, I’ve heard of you, our parents know each other! You have a twin too, right?”
“And after I’ve
Draco’s eyes narrowed. He hadn’t considered that.
The boy looked terrified, but raised his chin.

,” he said, sliding his hand stealthily under the table onto Harry’s knee.
“Now eat!”
“Okay. Bye Jamie. I’ll send you an owl so you can know when to meet the Marauders. Later Malfoy.”
“Mione…you don’t mean…” he said, gaping at her.
“You’ll be eating dinner first.”
“Draco, I may be young in body but my mind is not made for this new world you’ve created!” Lucius argued. “The son-in-law you speak of is a child I have hated from his infancy! The alliances you’re creating are ones I have always believed to be abominations. My instincts are
“Um…well…Muggles don’t usually think of ingredients in terms of their origin. Like, lacefly wings, captured during a full moon, or whatever. Everything is actually made of mixtures of less complex substances…Muggles have identified the most basic substances that everything else is made of.”
“Well even if you take them down quick, then you still have three others who’ll make you pay for that.” Regulus objects.
That done, he stood upright and looked down at the struggling Harry Potter.
“If you guys don’t mind, I’d like to have my fiancé to myself, now.” Harry interjected.
“After all, you showed up”
“Hey, I am
“I’ll tell her your…
“This is Lysander, my new friend.” Regulus introduced. “Lysander, come over and meet my brother James!”

Potter was silent.
“No, Mother. You’re very wrong. Until recently I hated and despised Potter.” Draco corrected her.
Smoke from various explosions and spell side-effects hazed the air, and the formerly crisp battle lines had become a series of sudden swirls of anonymous robes with spells flashing towards and away from each, in seemingly every direction.
“We’ll take care of that too. Please, just come on.” Draco coaxed him out of the Potions classroom and down the hall to the bathroom.
~Dolores Umbridge~
But if Potter was
“For those of you who did not witness it at Kings Cross, I will allow
“Friendship, like brotherhood. Great to make all feuds fade in memory.” They spoke in unison.
“Hush Ron.” Granger led the red-faced boy away.
“I’ll want your promise to actually deliver the items to me if you penetrate security and recover them, also.” Draco added, and when Bill agreed they both submitted to the Oath.
Draco allowed his smirk to transform into a rakish grin before he clapped his hands twice.
“You said Voldemort already knows anyways!” Potter said defiantly.
“Your Master?”
Their dad looked up at their papa.
A low moan came from Potter at this news.
“If we’re lucky!” James corrected, severely.
Tom shrugged.
“In conclusion of our ritual, I offer you the Blood gift – my wand shall ever serve to bring about the deaths of the enemies of your house, be they wizard, muggle, or squib.”
“The problem we have is, the closer we get to the truth, the better your story will hold up to any kind of magical investigation…but with a higher risk of someone guessing the truth. If you claim the Slytherin name, people will both want to verify your claim and be interested enough in your story to make guesses.”
“I never said I was nice.”
Draco sent the Heron away and went to his desk to write a quick note.
Potter blushed and hastily disappeared. The door slammed and Potter was gone.
Harry swatted his husband on the back of the head as Hermione started cooing and making faces at the infant. Tom watched it all with suspiciously bright eyes.
“There’s really only one way to fix it. For the future, of course. You’ll have to produce the next Black heir, and we’ll have to make sure
He pulled on Potter’s shoulder, and Potter thankfully took the hint, turning counterclockwise himself to cover the area Draco had turned his back on and Stupifying another enemy as he pivoted and stepped to his left, bringing himself once again back-to-back with Draco.
“He will be a

“That
It would work. He knew it would.
And wait he had, in alternating fits of glee, paranoia – outright terror.
“~~Uh, no that’s Frankie’s familiar.~~”
“We’ll make Hufflepuff history!” Frankie adds importantly.
Harry tipped his head to the side for a moment, then reached for the magical phone on the desk.
“Harry. You
“That’s enough. Why did you go to Egypt?”
Draco observed Potter out of the corner of his eye, and caught Potter doing the same to him.
Draco narrowed his eyes at them, before pointedly turning his attention to Harry.
“I’ve been everywhere, man. Shit. Are you a guy?”
?” Draco asked, eyebrow raised skeptically.
Harry nodded and looked at Draco expectantly.
“It has to be immersed in liquid state of course. So the components of liquid form the mathematical base, and we need a neutral vessel with no interactive components.”
“To be sure, it isn’t for the faint of heart. It certainly isn’t my preferred mode of transport! My son, on the other hand… well, we can’t all be athletes, but a Quidditch player at the grade school level will zip around at speeds upward of a hundred miles an hour.”
But that would be easy to do, by engineering a “menses” crisis – Draco was sure Granger was a good enough actor to convince Molly Weasley the girl believed she might be pregnant, which would make it very clear that Ron had given her some reason to reach that conclusion, of course. Not enough to actually void Virginity, but sufficient to make it a possibility…
Draco smirked, wondering what Daphne would say if she knew about Potter’s
Draco slowly, gracefully rose up out of the still water, ripples expanding in endless rings from the planes of his emerging torso, causing the teacup-sized floating candles to bob softly in an expanding circle of twinkling light around him.

“Because with power and wealth comes responsibility.” They said together.
Lucius paused at that. To admit surprise would reveal the level of his own exclusion within his own house. On the other hand, a second heir to Slytherin was a strategic development that was not necessarily a positive one.
“Mmm. I don’t think the spells would interfere if we don’t try anything improper.”
matter.”
Voldemort’s eyes narrowed even more now.
Draco moved in again only to pushed back.
“I’ve decided to seek a marriage contract with Potter.”
Draco shuddered, and distracted himself by looking over at the center of all this attention.
Tom held his breath as curious students and two shocked-looking muggle parents stopped what they were doing to watch the spectacle.
“I mean no disrespect! I… my father demanded it of me, on his deathbed.”
“Well…I think it’s really hot…but you can come up to my room to fix it if you want?” Harry said hesitantly, taking a step in that direction.
Ron Weasley buried his face in his arms, completely mortified at this point.
“Why the water?”
“What would
“Yes well, I suppose every artifact has its own range of subjective values, depending on the person. And Sirius Black has been a sore spot for Potter ever since he died. I think I’ll go on and push things a bit.”
Draco was suddenly drenched with freezing cold water, suddenly dampening the dangerous cycle of sex-magic they’d been caught up in.
“Don’t be”
“Slytherin!” The Sorting Hat cried.
Potter nodded, then froze.
Draco fished through his bag and came out with the “Chemistry for Dummies” book, holding it so Granger could see it.
“It’s perfectly understandable to have second thoughts, Draco.
“Looking forward to it. Draco.”
“At the Burrow”
The two looked up guiltily, and found a boy their own age standing on the other side of the cradle, wand raised threateningly.
know him.”
“Oh well. It sounded kind of fun to watch.”
“The one and only.” The old man’s eyes twinkled maddeningly.
Lord Voldemort was…very, very powerful. And paranoid on top of it. The number and complexity of the protection and countering charms and various other assorted magical preparations outstripped even Dumbledore’s.
“I’m sure you didn’t bring us in here
“I don’t want to go Dark, Draco! I don’t!”
hot!”
Draco felt the discomfort of a paintful throb in his already-hard member as Potter let out a long, low sigh, stretching out his long body underneath the suds as he leaned back against the edge of the bath, his back to Draco.
“Ahem!”
“Who did this, Potter! Who the fuck did it?” He snarled.
“It’s not that simple, Draco. The Dark Lord can’t be killed with just one Unforgivable.”
our blood with his contaminated blood? And Gryffindor? Have you any idea what would happen to our line if our descendants were influenced by the Gryffindor magic?” Lucius spat.
He pounded his fists uselessly against unbroken slab of oak, his blows swallowed up in its bulk with barely even a sound.
as breathtaking as the Atrium of Malfoy Manor, but then, it was only intended for a few generations of Malfoys to live in comfort for a time, and was
inheritances.” Draco told him.
“Crecio”
Potter looked at the paper.
Draco groaned. Of course the dumb git would be immune, the damn Killing Curse bounced off him!
The elf, and the cradle, disappeared.
“Legilmens!”
No. He’d allowed himself to develop feelings for
“Oh…god…Draco…please don’t stop…oh, shit…I’m going to, going to…”
“Hush, Ronald. I’m sure he has some ulterior motive, but we won’t find out what it is unless Harry goes there. I’m sure even Malfoy won’t try to kill him right in public, and in front of a first-year.”
Regulus exchanged fist-bumps with his twin and then with Frankie, exchanging a smirk for Rose’s disapproving frown, and then headed up to meet the Sorting Hat.
“Midnight tonight at Slytherin.” Draco said, graciously.
“Good morning, Great-Aunt.” Draco said to the portrait. The image of the aged Matriarch paused, her mouth frozen in the act of opening to shriek another series of epithets as her eyes frantically took stock of him.
“What we’ve all wanted to say”
“And who are we to pass up an opportunity to teach them to be
Draco took a deep breath. He would say as much as possible to be recognized as truth, but as little as possible to inform.
Draco jerked backwards in surprise.
“Even the Weasleys have still managed to remain pure. Though they do tend to take on new blood directly instead of waiting a generation, they’re not
there, along with various background information on the reasons behind each item. This should be no problem, even with the rather inept Potter in the mix.
“So what do we do about Hogwarts?” Regulus prompted.
“Looks like your plan is working,” Pansy observed.
“I suppose Dumbledore is using it for something and is protecting it his own way. That should be completely unnecessary. An ancient pureblood family home…is virtually unassailable. If the Lord of the Manor is managing it properly, that is.”
Draco leaned over, put his nose next to Potter’s jaw, and took a deep whiff.
The Runespoor, perceiving an insult, hissed their displeasure and started slithering their way out of the bedroom.
“Won’t he escape?”
It was to be the child’s own description of their proposed future spouse, upon first setting eyes on them.
Harry said nothing, but the look he sent at their Papa was very pointed indeed.
“Well yes dear, but they can’t be allowed to get out of hand! Take Mr. Potter’s little friend, for example. The girl is so busy trying to appear intelligent that she isn’t aware of her place in the scheme of things. She’s apparently content to bring her strength under the influence of a pureblood family, but her behavior is that of one determined to found her own original line!”
Draco turned to go.
Regulus sat in the corner of the Gryffindor common room and wondered why he was there.
“Scarab. Good! You’re catching on, Potter!”
The vacuum cleaner moaned.
“Oh yes, indeed they would! Yes, Lord Malfoy! We will send one of our curse-breakers to look at your wards, and you will see him penetrate them ever so easily! Gringotts wards are the only truly safe protections for your riches, Lord Malfoy!” the creature assured him.
Harry collapsed on top of Draco, still inside him, and Draco felt the universe right itself again as the waves of pleasure receded.
“I apologize for touching you, and for whatever memories that may have triggered.” He said, quietly.
would prefer to handle this matter appropriately.”
Potter looked into his eyes for a while, then smiled slightly.
“Regulus! James! Oh, it’s so good to see you little monsters again!”
“How foolish, to sneer at claims made by someone who has examined the list of his rival’s magical inheritances, when you have not.” Draco replied calmly.
Draco thought a moment. The contents of this room were beyond price. The things he could do with…
“Good morning Fishburne. I am Lucius Malfoy.” Lucius shook it firmly, giving the young man a measured smile.
“Well, he should get in trouble…”
Harry peered at him from a doorway, a small frown on his face.
“Stupid me.” He whispered brokenly.
“What?” Potter asked. Potter’s face was still flushed, and he was avoiding looking at Draco.
Harry followed suit by levitating the second and third, and the five of them quickly passed out the doors to the vehicle waiting outside.
Nott looked at the ground, abashed.
? I suppose you think
to me, Potter! And forget the Dark Lord! Do you know how many Light families would love to get revenge on a Malfoy? Do you know how many others would withdraw their support in the war if they knew? And what about my Aunt Bella – she’d torture me and send you a howler of me screaming for the fun of it.”

Master to Potter as a Blood gift, your return will be most helpful in smoothing the way.”
Harry opened his eyes as Draco’s arms circled his waist, and willingly allowed himself to be pulled out of his chair to sit on the rich green velvet tablecloth below them. Draco cuddled him a for a moment until he’d calmed down, then twisted to look at his face.
“Doesn’t look like much, he’s all wrinkly.” James commented.
“I don’t think-”
Harry recoiled.
“Okay…” Potter said.
“Slave to the Dark Lord, Draco! There is no higher position relative to such a powerful being!”
Odd. He didn’t recognize any of those names. He concentrated on the one in the middle.
“I apologize. You would have made a good wife, Pansy. But…well…it
~Severus Snape~
“True, but vague.”
Still. This would most definitely satisfy the Magic portion of the courtship ritual.
“I’m so glad Fred and George were right! I was so upset that I wouldn’t be able to make a sweater for Harry’s love, and it turns out I was working on one the whole time!” Molly Weasley said happily while enthusiastically suffocating Draco by pressing his face into her ample bosom.
“Teachers.” Potter replied.
“These will be magical scars, connecting us forever.” He told him as he finished the cut.
“I was only speaking the dreadful truth. Though…perhaps it was a bit impolite to point out that the sheets were cotton. Yet…Harry…I’m fairly certain they
“With that said, I’m afraid I can give you no more details until the non-disclosures are signed. If you haven’t already done so, please join the queue here and sign the documents. These are
At the incantation, the silver coat-of-arms shimmered with magic, and then words appeared firmly in Draco’s mind.
“Why’s it so awful?”
“Good. Until then, I’ll be with my Slytherins.” Draco announced, sweeping out the door.
Draco leaned in, tasting the strong magic just barely reaching out to his own.
The boys tensed, their ears straining as footsteps echoed outside, coming closer.
“I can’t, he’s my friend.” Harry said sadly. “He’d never forgive me.”
“Indeed he is.” A deeper voice agreed from the opposite balcony. “But who exactly are you, young man?”
Severus seemed to read his mind.
“Now now, Harry, I can’t have you ruining my perfectly lovely trap with unpleasant curses. Don’t you appreciate all the effort I’ve gone to?” Draco gestured at the lovely scene he’d spent so much time creating.
“Yes Master Draco! Wobbly is making haste!” The elf disappeared.
so there will be binding non-disclosure agreements to be signed by those who have not already bound themselves.”
Harry blinked, his eyes flashing the sudden pain of betrayal, and he opened his mouth to protest.
was looking a bit faint, staring at the swan he’d been petting as if it had bitten him.
“I…well, this is all my life, so I will not claim to understand your upset. But…I have seen my view of the world turned upside down before. Twice. I can sympathize. I will wait, and answer whatever questions you have for me.”
Draco threw back the sheets and tenderly cleaned the mess from Harry’s body.
The boys fidgeted restlessly in their seats. These family meetings were a dreadful bore.
“I’m his adopted brother. He chose me to take care of him.”
Of course, the latter was quite old-fashioned, as most Slytherins had evolved to more subtle ways of demonstrating their satisfaction with whatever plans they had hatched. Preferably,
“Harry…the magical traces...it was channeled through a phoenix tail core. And…yew.”
“You really meant it, when you said love is a family thing, didn’t you?”
There was also the fact that different types of Muggles probably had their own unique rituals that applied to them, according to status and bloodline. The chances of getting his hands on a Muggle of similar status to Potter was unlikely.
“Draco? What are you doing in here?”
Harry grimaced.
“Draco…don’t say that.” Potter said sadly, moving closer to Draco.
Draco held him firm, a strong hand on his wand arm. And then Draco reached out…and took Potter’s wand out of his hand.
“Just…oh! Just aftershave.”
Harry considered him, the big green eyes swirling hypnotically to swallow him up.
Muggles! Oh Merlin, a Founder’s blood could get mixed with undiluted Muggle blood and lost forever!” Daphne was hyperventilating. The Common Room was in an uproar over this conjecture, the older students properly horrified while some of the younger Slytherins looked about to cry.
“Ah, Draco, my fingers! Cold!”
“Kreacher
“You’re fucking insane! You could have killed me you stupid crazy Gryffindor!” Draco heard himself screaming as he grabbed Potter around the throat and slammed his head into the grass.
“We don’t know, exactly. But we’re fortunate to have allies who can help us find out.” Draco said.
Lucius raised his head to speak from his position prone on the marble floor.
“Father, if we might be excused, the train will be departing in only a few minutes.” Cloud interjected politely.
father since that inheritance is through the soul rather than through blood. After our marriage, the future Malfoy line will benefit from the combined gifts of the two most powerful Founders, never before combined. The Potter line will benefit from the refinement of our blood, which should calm some of the wild magic they are prone to, and the Black line will have the benefit of both.”
start talking about your debts yet! You’re only sixty-five, how
Draco finally managed to roll away, coming up to his knees in a defensive pose.
“The Mark is coercive in nature, of course, with a foundation of irrevocable consent twisted to a blanket agreement.” Severus said. “It’s ritual magic, so the emotions matter.”
“Is this a problem if it is true?”
“Be seeing you, Potter.” Draco sneered as the Boy Who Lived walked away.
The mortal insult successfully delivered, he grabbed his blushing husband by the hand and dragged him out of the hospital wing before the stupid Gryffindor could stammer out some sort of
The next part of the scroll was more or less useless to Draco, but it was only fitting the scroll would immortalize Potter as having a broken nose. Especially one from Draco.
The icon, when Draco had stared at it, had flooded him with feelings: desperate longing, mixed with bitterness and pain and, yes, self-
But…who?
Draco frowned.

“Scorpius is a very strong
Draco beckoned to his now-dressed husband and pulled him to stand over Voldemort, Draco behind him, wrapping his husband’s fingers around the hilt of the bonding knife, guiding his hand to the Dark Lord’s quivering throat.
“Sorry Frankie, it’s how I talk to my familiar. Here, see if Phillip likes this.”
“Severus Snape
“Disown him.” Draco was surprised at the lack of hesitation in his voice.
“Both raised by Muggles, remember?”
“Oh…Draco…?”
Sniffing at their clumsy attempts at self-punishment, the Lord Draco Malfoy mounted the grand stairs, the massive double-doors swinging wide before him as he entered his domain.
“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you about Thomas. I…I wasn’t sure how you would react. He’s an orphan, you know. And…well, we all know what happened to the last powerful Slytherin who was left isolated in an orphanage.” He told his father in a low voice.
explode, I’ll haunt you and make your life miserable, Malfoy.”
“Now you’ve done it, ‘Mione. Don’t you think Harry misses his parents? He knows exactly what she’s missing.” Weasley growled, throwing down his own fork. “I’m going after him.”
Severus frowned, watching his godson carefully. Draco’s face would be expressionless to most anyone, but Severus had watched this boy closely since he had been born. Something was skittering behind the corners of the boy’s eyes, something somewhere between panic and disbelief.
“Did you
Draco looked up at her.
it, ‘Mione!” Weasley protested.
“Thank you, but I’ve already found my brother. As long as those others don’t disturb his rest, I want nothing to do with them.” Tom said politely.
The newest section of the scroll was not what Draco was expecting.
“Only a few months, I’m afraid. I was only recently discovered, for reasons I will not go into.”
“He will resent being forced.”
Damn Potter.
“His mood? Oh! I mean, I don’t see why you think Harry’d be attracted to you, since you’re a boy. He’s shown no sign of being…homosexual.” Granger said. “Are…are you saying you’re going to defy your father, and not be a Death Eater?”
The Head Girl looked up at him, completely shocked at the polite request.
“What did he say?”
“Draco…I don’t like the sound of this.” Harry said uncomfortably.
that. We’re working on it. And you’ll be ready sooner than you think. But first I have to get these things in working order.”
Draco sighed, and performed a few quick cleaning and neatening and starching charms, restoring her robes to a reasonable state for a well-bred twelve year old.
Draco stood suddenly, his chair crashing to the floor behind him as he stared down in total shock at the passionate embrace.
- - - - -
Potter just nodded, a hand going up to touch the Talisman under his shirt.
“Why do this?”
They both looked up to see a smug Granger putting away her wand.
“You are far too skinny, Harry James Potter, I can see every detail under your skin!” Molly retorted, and grabbed possibly the most powerful wizard since Merline by the ear, dragging him to the chair next to Draco.
Much better.
“So. What do you think we should do?” Draco asked.
“We’re in my room, I assure you none of the Slytherins can penetrate my privacy wards.”
“Yes.”
Lucius’ face darkened at the choice of pronoun.
“Well, they do. It’s called Sorting. We’re not allowed to tell new students how it’s done yet. But you do get some say in where you’ll go. If you already know where you want to be, you’ll probably end up there.”
had given him this reminder.
“Tom would have stormed your compartment, you know.”
He kicked sideways at the amorous mop, knocking it away, but it returned quickly, now joined by an enchanted scrub brush which unfortunately had the ability to magically hover, enabling it to slide its bristles suggestively up the inside of his thigh.
“Yes, I am a first year. I am Thomas, and pleased to meet you.”
“He already thought it might be me you were dating.”
Parkinson”. And in private, usually referred to Draco by his first name. Unless he was very angry.
“That…that would…” Granger stammered, wistfully.
“We are going to be married.” Draco told him confidently. “I told you. Royal marriages are bloody.”
“That’s enough.”
“Exchange?” Potter asked, fists clenched.
“The Dark Lord demanded details about our courtship. I had kept this a careful secret from him before, so I had to make it seem I was still working on his behalf all along. I told him of your heritage, and that I thought you could be a powerful ally for him if I convinced you to become Dark.” He told him.
Tom turned to him last.
A few button pushes later, and the note disappeared in a puff of green flames.
“You’ll regret that. And about the other, forget I asked. I’ll find out another way.”
of magic, and it bled into a wizard in a way that wasn’t energizing at all.
is at the door, asking for you.” Blaise was not bothering to hide his curiosity, which was quite echoed by the rest of the Slytherins.
“Oh my god, it’s going to be bad, isn’t it!”
Draco sighed tiredly.
“Potter!”
Severus shook his head as if to clear it.
They all ignored the fact that the Mudblood’s grades were actually better than Draco’s. It was only due to the teacher’s prejudice against Slytherins, anyways.
Then…a rich green glow appeared around Potter’s hands, his insane, raw, powerful magic there, visible, and Draco reached desperately for it.
“Nor shall he be. Zabini knows what
“I shouldn’t…as far as I know it was a couple weeks ago.” Tom said.
, ready to confront whatever dark truth they might uncover.
“Oh he did. But not without having a huge debate with Ron and Hermoine about it.” Jamie said.
?” Harry asked, weakly.
“Draco…please, not like this!” Potter started to beg, struggling against Nagini.
“That’s a good analogy. My magic is fine-woven silk and yours is…tempered steel chain-mail. When you touch me that way, they are trying to join, the way they’ll join when we bond. When we do…to you it’ll probably be like you’re drowning in liquid silk, to me it’ll probably be like drinking absinthe while it’s on fire.”
Tom wanted it to be true.
E. Lucius Malfoy (leading a muggle uprising)
Draco didn’t reply. He was busy watching a certain dark-haired little girl with piercing grey eyes.
“Sure Draco.” The boy said agreeably.
There was a pop, and the diminuitive house elf appeared.
“Aahhh! A snake!
Then he gave one more hard thrust and Draco felt the universe disappear, sound sucked out of the world like a massive Silencio as Harry’s face moved back in slow motion to make eye contact, those big, impossibly green eyes widening as Harry’s body trembled with the force of his orgasm, his length expanding and jerking inside Draco as Harry’s seed and Harry’s magic spewed from his member deep into Draco. Magic exploding around them as they both shuddered and silently screamed their climax.
my father got his insane ideas about your family but he left out the fact that your wife’s cooking should be illegal!”
Draco set the bag on the floor and opened it, then stepped back, glaring at it in distaste.
“Um. He probably thought I wouldn’t know the variation of the shield charm to handle them both at once without tying up my wand?”
pull the strings that must be pulled, and
“Would we should take a look at it? Perhaps we could find some answers right now.” she motioned towards his arm, curiousity alive in her eyes.
Tom frowned at the Potions Master.
“I’m telling you, one of them will be guarding inside.” Regulus hissed.
Well, he
Potter looked down at him, flushed with arousal and remaining fury for his duplicity, an eye flickering towards the closed bag behind him for a second.
“I…um…actually reached climax without touching myself.”
“So…what did you want to talk about?”
Two little fingers popped up from his fist and waved crisply down the hallway.
“…we promise!”
“His eyes are already as green as Harry’s.” Hermione said, surprised. “It took even Regulus a couple days to show silver. You must be very proud.”
of this family now, father. And much wiser to recognize that I would never make nice with Potter if it were not a benefit to our family!”
“No…”
“Boltholes!”
“Well, it seems the boy isn’t a danger, at least. I believe my work is done. Mr. Potter, Mr. Malfoy, Mrs. Weasley. I shall take my leave.”
Lucius took out his wand.
“Thank you, I’m pleased you approve. Sit down.” Draco waved imperiously at the seat opposite him.
He smirked at the Dark Lord over his husband’s shoulder as he delivered the true final line of the prophecy into Harry’s ear.
“That is…
“I’ll have the tailor come by to get updated measurements while we’re out. You’ll need to get some Muggle clothes. You’re aware they’re integrated with the Cambridge campus, aren’t you?” Draco called over his shoulder as he walked out of the library in search of his sons.
“What is a familiar of James doing here?” he asked.
had been
Then Bellatrix was there, with Lucius next to her, and the horrible red streak of Crucio was flying towards them, Potter stepping in front of Draco to take the terrible curse…
Then an equally youthful Granger, frizzy hair half in her face, bent over a cauldron in…a bathroom?
Harry was curled around a pillow, his bare shoulder exposed, looking incredibly bronze in contrast to the white duvet. The adorable mop of black hair was even more ruffled than usual, and as Draco knelt next to the bed he observed the long eyelashes fluttering against a smooth cheek.
“That sounds extremely simple. Why can’t you do it?”
, no doubt.
the…unpoisoned head?” Tom asked slowly.
“You don’t seriously give that old Ministry propaganda weight, do you? You’ve come into contact with Dark artifacts just as I have, you know very well they have the opposite effect.”
“Oh? Why not?”
Draco leaned in to kiss his twice-over husband on the lips.
“Oh, Draco?”
“Not Dumbledore! Forget that old man! I’m talking about
Ollivander looked like he’d seen a ghost when he laid eyes on Tom.
James looked at his brother, puzzled, but Regulus only shrugged, already immune to Lysander’s random left turns.
“Indeed. Now if you could excuse me, I’d promised my fiancé I would greet him and his family for breakfast.”
“Oh!” Potter’s face suddenly lit up with realization. “Yeah I guess I understand what you’re saying. People tell me I look just like my father. I guess that must be important with old, really famous families like this, and-”
The bulge now pressed back very firmly, sliding to the side and around until it was pointing upwards towards Harry’s chin, bouncing up and down as it throbbed. Draco carefully pulled back the odd stretchy material at the waistband of the pajamas and revealed Harry’s brown penis, hard and silky and drooling just a bit from the tip.
Draco walked into the dining room and found it deserted. A rattling in the kitchen told him Molly Weasley was about, but he wasn’t quite ready to face her and her arsenal of tasteful time-bombs.
Draco, sitting on George’s shoulders, held tightly to Harry’s hand where he was sat on Fred’s shoulders next to him, the two twins giggling madly as they jogged through the crowd at an insane pace.
“WHAT!?” Granger sputtered again. “But…but Harry’s not gay! And your father is Voldemort’s second-in-command for heaven’s sake! And you hate each other!”
“Lucius…” Harry muttered.
That must have been Potter’s mother, on the night that made him famous.
The slender girl made her way up to the front and sat, ducking a bit as the Sorting Hat was placed on her head.
“I…I was angry! She was a Death Eater and trying to kill you! It was just what came to mind…”
Trust the Weasel to be an effective decoy.
“I mentioned the wisdom of reuniting the Black blood and title.” Draco said, nodding towards Jamie. “He was very offended at the idea of marrying for any purpose other than personal attraction.”
“I…Draco, she wouldn’t tell! Not even Ron. I tell her everything, and she would have figured it out when she heard about the explosion anyways. She’s not stupid, you know.” Potter hissed, trying to pull his arm away.
“Child’s play, you say?”
from Malfoy, it’s got to be something Dark.” Weasley said bitterly.
“Gryffindor...” the woman said in a hushed, horrified voice. “Well I hope you’ll be training her properly, even a Potter can be manipulated by a deft hand.”
Tom still cradled the infant possessively.
Harry Potter, powerful as he was, would fall before this wizard. Fall, and bring Draco down with him, since Draco had allowed himself to become so attached.
“I ssssee…you play a dangerous game, young Lord.”
“…Harry is smaller…”
“Well…she knows a lot about it. I can’t really talk to her about it without getting lost. Nobody can. Maybe you could-”
“It just means”
In his dorm, Draco held the silvery vial in one hand, and Potter’s scroll in the other. Which to examine first?
Draco looked up, and was thankful for the menu half-covering his face. He was sure his impassive expression had faltered for at least a second.
The kids giggled as they closed in on this new victim, little fingers working their energetic magic on his ribs as they commenced the tickle-torture, reducing him to laughing fits.
“As Potter is likely to be
grin at her. Draco blinked his eyes rapidly to dispel the disturbing image from his retinas. Sodding Potter may be powerful, he may even be respectable and perhaps even good-looking when he decided to dress himself like a grown-up Lord. But he was not going to be fucking
Tommy looked up at Draco, shocked realization on his face.
“Actually, blood magic is permitted for the purpose of verifying a claim of birthright.” Tom interceded.
“Very well. I will not stand in the way of your attempts to court Mr. Potter. For now. See that you give me no cause to change that.” He said.
“Of course I did! His scroll should have been one of the first you found!”
Snape looked between the two students suspiciously, then whirled around, robes billowing impressively as he led the way into his office.
The Dark Mark had it’s own line stretching upwards, up through the Gaunts and into the Slytherins, up to Salazar himself. And a host of silver trickles cascading down to the Dark Lord and then to Potter. More symbols, in silver. Parseltongue, Legilmency, Possession, and a
“I think we’ve discussed the social drawbacks of overt favoritism from the teachers.” Draco chastised his sons. “In any case, you wouldn’t get much use out of them.”
“Indeed. And here I am, still breathing. Let us retire to the library then.” He said.
The rumor that Harry Potter had received a beautiful artifact via two swans had taken only two periods to spread through the entire school, and lunch was now the first chance for everyone to openly compare notes.
“Well…I know you’re really big on pure blood, Malfoy. But I don’t agree with that. Blood isn’t that important you know.”
“I’m fine.”
“Nope! Phillip’s a familiar!”
Not “trust”. That would be an insult. An assumption that one’s allies were so foolish and sentimental that they would ignore a chance to increase their own fortunes if it presented itself.
“I…I think I can handle it.” Tom said, biting his lip.
know that’s not proper procedure. If you want to make amendments to the proposition you have to make a motion while it’s in committee, not in the middle of a vote.” Granger was lecturing.
Draco reached out to touch his face briefly before pulling his hand quickly back to his own lap.
“Until he turns blue.”
?” he sputtered.
“Granger is free to help out if she wants to reduce their workload. Though I expect the elves themselves will be upset by the invasion of their turf. Still, she’s
The Cabinet started glowing again, and Draco knew his aunt would be through in moments.
“Yes Ronald, I think it’s about time I let you get to second base, at least. Draco is quite right, the best way to respond to this sort of humiliation is revenge, and I’m quite sure your mother would never approve.” Granger said briskly.
“Nothing! Honest!” George insisted
“They’re everywhere!” Potter shouted as a Death Eater suddenly appeared behind them and tried shooting a bright red hex at them. Draco blocked the spell while Harry issued a fast Stupify at their attacker.
“Do you think I would be sending you this gift if I believed that?”
With that decision made, the boy carefully climbed the narrow stairs that led up into the strange beast, his wand clutched carefully beneath the small squirming bundle.
Tom frowned.
“Are we so bad? Am I that bad?”
Draco looked over at the Gryffindor table, a twinge of regret sliding through him as he saw Harry’s hunted expression as he read the article. Harry hated the attention of the Wizarding World on him, especially on his personal life, and now he had it in droves. And Draco had done that to him.
Draco paused, turning to look at the boy. His eyes softened at the sad look on his face.
“I am willing, if you come to me in good faith.”
Harry looked up at him, big green eyes luminous in the candlelight. Cheeks still a bit flushed.
Tom wordlessly held out his hand, cupped as if to hold water, and made a small cut in the meat of his palm with his wand. A few drops of blood quickly spread out on his palm.
He surveyed the rest of the spots. A multitude of moments, and all of them seemed to be people. People…doing what? Dying for Potter? No, only a few of those. What then? Maybe, being willing to? But Granger didn’t show that…but she certainly had to work hard to brew Polyjuice Potion at that age.
The Gryffindor appeared to still be in shock.
“They will polish and shine every inch of marble, and every cobblestone of every Malfoy path or road on the Manor grounds, before they eat or rest.”
“We have reason to believe your
“In case you’ve all forgotten, Potter is currently being courted according to the very finest wizarding traditions.” Draco reminded them. “Clearly, the Founders line isn’t going to disappear anytime soon.”
“Just because she’s nice”
Draco stepped forward. “Praenomen Draco”
- - - - -
“If I could have your attention, please!” a familiar voice boomed out from the door.
The three pairs of eyes swiveled to take, what Draco was sure they must have thought was a surreptitious look at the Slytherin table. Draco made a point to sneer back at them. They quickly averted their eyes and went into a huddle, whispering furiously…then gradually growing louder…
“But we know my reflection-wand is still in there, right?”
“You are out of place here, werewolf.” Draco sneered at him. “This is to be a royal wedding party, not a blood raid. Get back in the Cabinet.”
Potter groaned with pleasure, and Draco felt the pull on his magical core as Potter started drinking in his magic.
“So long as they’re also specific enough the boy can’t squirm out of telling the truth we need to know.”

heir?”
It wasn’t enough.
Draco found a genuine smile stretching across his own face at this greeting.
Harry interceded quickly.
Molly smiled gently at him.
Voldemort glared at Lucius.
The young boy shivered fearfully, his eyes darting nervously around the empty train station.
“You did?” Potter asked, his nostrils flaring with interest, eyeing Draco’s trousers speculatively.
“Three weeks ago, I convinced Potter to give the Black inheritance to Jamie. When he agreed, I initiated Placitum Perago. He accepted it with a wave of his hand. I don’t think he intended to, but it worked.” Draco told him.
The boy was a notorious ladies man, he’d never had any liaison that even hinted at a marriage contract, and most parents were sufficiently wary of his mother’s influence to avoid approaching the wealthy Heir for a betrothal agreement.
Draco raised an eyebrow. He supposed she was partially right. He gave her a small smile.
“He can’t count!” another chimed in.
And Scorpius had the features of each.
“And what
Draco made a dismissive gesture.
“Someone told me once, that there isn’t any wizard that went bad, that didn’t come from Slytherin.”
HAVE TO REMIND YOU THAT YOU HAD BETTER BE WASHING BEHIND YOUR EARS AND YOUR ARMPITS AS WELL, EVERY NIGHT, RONALD WEASLEY!
Draco spun on his heel and strode down the corridor towards the dungeons. One, two, three steps. Then he smoothly pivoted and pointed his wand at Potter’s retreating back.
“I need your help, Potter.”
The Dreamer seemed grudgingly content with this explanation, but the Planner snarled at them both.
“And I’m Regulus.”

Potters hair to the Targeting knot, silk produced and woven by a dark creature to the Defense knot, and Draco’s blood to the Transfer knot. Object, Purpose, and Power.
“Your father is going to prime the memory for us, and then we will all dip our faces into the bowl.” Draco coached them.
“I don’t think I can do this, Draco.” He whispered tremulously. “I…I’ve wanted you for so long, I never knew that it could literally destroy you. Everyone I love dies, Draco. Everyone. It’s a curse, I think. Part of the prophecy. ‘Neither can live while the other survives.’ If there’s even a chance that my love could…no, we can’t take the risk, Draco.”
Tom knew, from Draco’s instructions, that this was a very polite and artful way of inquiring as to his blood status and family. He smiled at the other boy in response.
“Jamie, did you go
“My grandfather, Abraxas, joined the Dark Lord Grindelwald and swore himself an enemy of the Light.”
“I can’t go, I’m a first-year.” Jaime said. “And why would we be meeting Potter?”
“You too, Jamie. You look beautiful. Um…wow. You have Sirius’s eyes, you know.”
“We need to talk.” Harry said seriously.
Potter grunted his assent, no doubt dreading his most hated class.
Draco turned to the boy.
“And you’ve left me enough hints, as well. In your ‘
“Harry!” Draco protested violently. The last thing he wanted was to attract the Dark Lord’s attention to an intimate dinner between his chief lieutenant’s son and the Boy Who Lived.
Draco paused a moment, then nodded.
Harry was shaking in his arms, and Draco though he must be crying until he realized the Gryffindor was laughing. His gut wrenched painfully as he realized the other boy was hysterical with shock.
“God, you purebloods can be so weird sometimes. You know you still creep me out now and then?”
“He will, when there is no other way to get what he wants.”
tramping around on my family grounds. You
Draco sagged, pulling Harry to lie with him.
Potter wrinkled his forehead, trying to think through the logic of that, then visibly gave up.
“Wha-…what?”
“Breathes fire, every morning.” Harry confirmed.
one of us, little boy?”
“Smell?” Potter gave a sniff, and shrugged. “I don’t smell anything.”
“Are you sure? You only saw him the once, in a memory.” Draco asked cautiously.
“Oh. Uh, a dude is just…a person. Like, ‘man’, except it’s not right to make assumptions about someone else’s gender identity. So I just said dude. ‘Cuz with the Spurts climbing all over you I knew I had to say something, but I don’t really know you, so I was just like, ‘dude’. You know?”
“I’ve decided that, given the state of the wizarding world, and your position with respect to Harry Potter, that the risk of any confusion regarding my nature and my intentions regarding the war and Harry Potter is counterproductive.” Draco said.
“I could transfer the title to Jamie.”
“Definitely Luna’s child.” Harry said, amused. He offered his hand. “I’m pleased to meet you…Lysander?”
Potter gaped at him.
At the same time, Rose certainly took after his godmother and would fit exactly into the role she had played.
“You’ll go to Azka--”
“You better watch your back, you vicious beast! I know who makes your medicine!”
Dumbledore looked at the incantation again, his face suddenly looking old.
He could feel his mother’s eyes boring into him as he turned his face forward again, and slowly mounted the stairs, his back perfectly straight.
The Lord Voldemort snarled up at him from his spot in the middle of the page, fearsome as any child’s worst nightmare.
“I don’t see anything.”
be observant enough to know how Potter will react when one of his precious friends is threatened.”
it to the Dark Lord?” Draco asked incredulously.
“My sincere apologies for doubting your word.” He breathed, clearly shaken.
“The same Gryffindor idiot he died for. Harry Potter.” Draco said bitterly.
, and
James leaned in.
Regulus gave him a disbelieving look, and James looked down at the pillow in his hands, ashamed.
“But dragon blood is volatile, of course, so it has to be countered by the sopohorus, which also slows the brain, and glumbumble bile, which of course is also counterbalanced with alihotsy to increase the befuddlement part of the potion.” Draco explained.
“Well. I suppose we’ll find out for sure when we have them over for dinner next. In the meantime, I’m not going to hold back just because those cretins might be watching.”
"I'll look forward to our next meeting. This is an adventure for me too, one I think I've been waiting for all my life. Thank you for…not living up to the nightmares."
Harry was babbling Parseltongue at the snake on Draco’s Slytherin crest, seeming hurt that it wasn’t answering him.
“He is the Dark Lord’s twin brother. The Dark Lord had…imprisoned him at a young age. You are aware of how the Dark Lord liked to take souvenirs from those he conquered.” Draco said in a very low voice.
The Dreamer hissed in agreement, and the Planner was forced to concede the point.
“No.”
“Don’t I get to meet them? And Scorpius?”
Harry seemed to sense when Draco left his side.
just yet.
Draco looked up at him for a long moment before answering.
Tom hesitated.
“And Dumbledore, and Severus, and your werewolf friend. That’s as far as it can go. Until it’s done, sealed, and the blood gift completed.” Draco pronounced.
Mrs. Weasley somehow had the spoon in her hand again, and gestured with it right under Draco’s nose. Damn her. Draco’s mouth started watering again.
Tom took his wand reverently and gave it an experimental flick. Blue sparks came from the tip.
“Right.” Draco paused a moment, not sure what to say. Potter had
He shivered. Strange things had gone on in that old house from the moment he brought Draco there as his fiancé. The disturbing scene in the broom closet had only been the beginning of a series of bizarre magical events directed by an increasingly obsessive sentience, culminating in the attempted kidnapping immediately following Regulus’ birth.
Professor Snape handed the parchment to Blaise and held out his hand to Draco. Draco clasped it.
Draco moved in until his face was inches from Harry’s.
“The heirloom needs to be appropriately ancient, but not Dark, obviously. I’m thinking perhaps the Crystal Sceptre for that. Given Potter’s situation
at me. We’re supposed to get married in just a few hours.”
“But Draco said Mudbloods are important!”
, remember? We’re already-”
“It’s possible. He doesn’t seem inclined to test the strength of his breeding blood, though.”
Potter turned to him, face flushed with excitement, green eyes sparking at the challenge.
And Draco was suddenly on the ground, gasping, feeling his magic draining as Potter let out only the smallest groan of pain, the majority of the curse deflected.
“What makes you think that? Am I not Gryffindor enough to convince you?”
Harry blinked.
Ron started sputtering with outrage at that news, and Granger was physically restraining his wand arm now.
“You’re right. This is just…harder than I thought it would be.”
Regulus and James took the opportunity to crowd closer to the bassinet, catching a glimpse of bright green eyes.
“Yes my Lord, it is true. Generational magic is cumulative, and as different from an individual wizard’s power as we are from squibs.” Lucius groveled.
“Precisely.” Draco agreed, stealing a quick kiss from Harry’s flushed lips. “And for me as well.”
“So, Harry. I’ve done a bit of research about the Muggle world, and I’ve come to the realization that no matter what wizarding ritual I use, even the greatest gifts in the wizarding world aren’t going to result in a marriage contract. You’re expecting…
“This again? Albus, that is a terribly and inaccurately simplified generalization to two very different feats of ritual magic.” Severus argued.
“I think that’s our cue to leave.” Draco said hurriedly, stuffing the muggle book into his robe pocket.
“Indeed, it has been many years since we last met, my boy. From your clothing I would guess, since the day I left you at King’s Cross Station, so many years ago.”
“Merlin.”
“Oh, Harry…you’re so beautiful.” Draco mumbled before taking the weeping head into his mouth.
“You’ll find that privacy spell you need in chapter three. Mind the twist at the start, if that’s not spot-on the whole thing will unravel at the precise moment when you need it most!”
“Good! So, my idea is…a decoy. A whole lot of decoys!” James crowed.
“Anyways, Moony showed up just in time, and told us he’s a werewolf. He’s the reason they worked so hard to become animagi. But that’s a different story. Turns out, Ron’s pet rat Scabbers was actually Peter Pettigrew, who everyone thought was murdered by Sirius. See, but the Map isn’t fooled by animagi transformation, so it showed Scabbers as-”
“Because Jamie trusts me as a blood relative.” Draco informed him curtly.
“What about the villagers…”
He’d been meaning to talk to the muggleborn witch anyways.
“Both. This is
“No my Lord. It is my responsibility alone to select a fitting gifts and present them to my future spouse.”
They all gasped at the demonstration and quickly averted their eyes, turning themselves to resume forced casual conversations that failed to conceal their continued intense awareness of his presence.
“MINE!” he growled.
“Tom is going to have a lot of money, Draco. And I’m concerned about an additional motive to sweeten the pot by killing off his brothers. Draco, I know Blaise is your friend, and Cloud seems like a sweet kid now, but I
This time the girl was quite genuine as she burned red and acted flustered.
“What
Draco just smirked.
And here was the proof. The mark, once again, sending its tendrils of magic into his consciousness.

Then he hit upon it.
“But…but…I thought we would just sit down and
“This is a Malfoy family bolthole, and tied by blood to each of us going back generations upon generations. It is magically impossible to sell or give it away. My father gifted you with the full measure that he had ownership of – control of the property during his Lordship.”
The goblin rubbed its hands together in barely-concealed glee at this.
, Draco!”
“I’m not going to impinge on Potter’s virtue, Ron. We just need to talk.”
Draco started to feel a low burn from Harry’s hard body behind him as the topic got them both thinking in that direction. Draco ignored the stirring under his robes and pushed the conversation back to topic.
Two exhausting hours later, the identical wands were lying next to each other on a long bowl with a flat silver mirror in the bottom.
, at least not as a young man.”
“Do you know anything of what was going on in the wizarding world when you met him?” Draco asked.
“Do you suppose they’ll make out in the corridors?”
“You know as well as I, Potter will never be punished for what happens during a Quidditch game. And you
“I won’t peek, I swear.”
Harry stopped, confused and then concerned.
“I believe he has a title now, my boy.”
“And that’s why we have to do the recipe.” James concluded, pleased that he understood.
Draco leaned forward, alarmed, hands reaching past dishes of steaming food to touch the Gryffindor on his face. Harry leaned into the contact desperately, tears escaping closed eyes.
He needed information, and he needed it now.
“I told you.” Draco said from behind him, his voice oozing smugness. “Worth the wait, is he not?”
“What’s the matter, Potty? Kneazle got your tongue? I bet that twisted half-breed Granger keeps around has quite a talent for kinky bestiality games! Well, Potter? Is that it? A bit sore from swapping furballs?”
“I think you boys need to think very carefully about this. We took a big risk telling you where Tommy came from, because you’re his brothers. But do you think most people in the wizarding world are going to bother trying to understand?” Harry said.
“Magic, Potter!”
Dumbledore looked at him disbelievingly. Draco felt the subtle tapping of the man’s mind against his Occlumency shields.
A solitary eyebrow raised to acknowledge her, the eyes – a silvery gray color, she noticed – not leaving the wild black-haired boy in the yard.
“Where’s Potter.” He demanded.
Draco swept out of the entry hall, leaving the portrait of his aunt uncharacteristically at a loss for words.
“You never did manage to get under the same roof as him, did you?” Draco asked quietly.
“I wont! I’ll just crawl in and shake him!”
Draco paused, annoyed. Then turned towards the door.
“Good. And Potter, Jamie is very pretty, will no doubt be beautiful…she
“I’m afraid I can’t allow that at this point.” Dumbledore disagreed.
Blaise let out a slow exhalation, breath whistling slightly through his pursed lips.
“It’s good.” Harry said, just before he took a bite.
“Tell him to bring his Cloak, then. And…oh, you should be the one to put the talisman around his neck. Make sure he wears it, then come back here. I’m sure this Room can make a pensieve.”
“I liked you waking me up.”
“Eyes?”
Potter’s eyes were suddenly going big in realization, obviously he was cluing in to the fact the proposal wasn’t about Jamie.
Potter smiled at him.

“Malfoy!” Weasley all but shrieked. “
“Your soul left Harry’s body with Scorpius, you’re probably magically tethered to him. Have you been far from his side?”
about this world, Granger.”
First he had to successfully secure Potter, himself.
you came in your sleep!”
Severus tossed back the glass of dragon whisky he’d poured, right before making the call.
“I’m going.” Potter decided, cutting the both of them off.
That decided, Tom turned his attention to the tyke in question.
Harry looked at him, a timid hope shining in his eyes.
The lines disappeared and were replaced by a single sphere around the dancing Albus, with several small symbols inside it. Then there was a box around that sphere, with many symbols and portraits inside the box but outside the sphere. And finally many symbols and portraits outside the box.
Potter performed the spell, causing the runes on each panel to glow slightly.
Draco laughed.
“What
“I am sure we all understand you are new to your family and must make up for much lost time. None of us in this house would begrudge that. Family before all.”
Draco looked disdainfully at the insulting title:
“~~Master? Why would you give our treats to the shelled creature?~~”
He looked each boy in the eye, his face very serious.
“You’re a suck-up!”
long…I’d like to see a proposal for your team members and some kind of outline of what equipment you’d need in time to have everything ready to start right after graduation, of course.”
-baby.” Draco scolded. “And he was able to help because he had both a magical and physical way out of your father, and young Thomas here was able to come out with him.”
?” he said incredulously.
“Wha-“ Potter turned large, betrayed eyes on Draco. He seemed to be aware something had happened but not what.
“Oh, Draco, you really had me! But who is it, really?” she asked.
Draco grinned back at his husband, then down at the twins.
Lucius smiled, a gentle bitter grimace.
“Yeah. Except I’ve got a headache like an elephant sat on it.”
Draco looked away from him, unable to meet those eyes.
“Of course not. I did mention to him the possibility of a contract between Potter and Black, suggesting a contract between Lord Potter and my newly discovered cousin Jamina Black. He refused outright…I was fortunate enough to learn some time later that he has a particular interest in myself, instead.”
“Now wait a minute, if you’ve got some kind of gadget watching us in here there’s no way I’m staying here!” Harry growled.
Draco started to turn around but Potter caught his wrist again.
“I think it would be much more efficient to forego the use of treasure chests entirely. The Malfoy family has, of course, our own ships, I’ll just need to arrange delivery of the contents of our vaults, including all artifacts and heirlooms, to your wharf location in Alexandria.”
“Then you must do me the same honor, Thomas.”
Potter got a very strange look on his face in reaction to the phrase, somewhere between confusion and amusement and absolute horror.
“Why?”
Draco nodded and turned to the table, taking one of the glasses in his hand. Harry cast an inquiring look at the concoctions on the table and Draco hastened to explain.
“Nothing important.”
Draco had been brooding all day.
“I want you to cuddle with me.”
Draco frowned.
Draco stumbled out of the closet, thoroughly creeped out of the erotic mood.
“Molly, Mr. Malfoy has come to put an end to a really horrible feud between our families! He
“But still! It’s the principle of the thing! She shouldn’t even
“You got stuck here too, huh? Guess nobody wanted you either.”
.” He informed the woman coldly. “I wouldn’t fulfil my adolescent urges on them if you begged me to.”
Jamie giggled, and Potter grinned the most horribly carefree and, damn it,
vulnerability, Potter. The moral of the maxim is that fully attaching yourself to things or people before placing them fully under your protection only makes them a target for your enemies.”
“Well. I suppose we’ve already eaten.” Draco observed, wondering what to do now. The dinner was supposed to be a time for the two families to reacquaint themselves with each other as friends…that particular spell always demanded a friendship that would rival the previous feud for intensity.
“So, the thing is, scarab and alihotsy if aligned together remain intact inside a potion, and over time, they meld to create an acid that explodes on contact with new ingredients. Remember that Potter, it can be a devastating kind of time bomb.” Draco continued.
“I’ll invite my parents, and Blaise and Pansy if they come out of the war intact.”
“Well,
Draco paused for a long moment, looking up at Potter’s face with a wicked look on his face before he spoke directly at Potter’s bouncing penis.
“Potter is the Dark Lord’s magical heir.”
Albus Dumbledore was his protector, his main support in the struggle against the Dark Lord. But Dumbledore was grouped with Severus which meant…
Voldemort hissed as he contemplated this.
“That must be
Ollivander held up Tom’s wand.
“Escribamens Fragilitas” he whispered.
Jonas’ hand was on his wrist, and Lucius stilled. It wasn’t uncomfortable, in fact the gesture felt kind, but he was suddenly dimly aware that this act, this physical contact with a muggle, of his very own magically imbued flesh being touched and warmed by the skin of a mundane, was in the context of his entire life a momentous milestone. Particular in the fact that, now the deed was done, he found himself entirely unaffected by a change of his status that his younger self would have viewed with such grim horror.
His eyes narrowed as he observed the slightly different slant of the ‘i’, the crossing of the ‘t’ whose ends curled up instead of down, an abnormal comma here, an out-of-character phrasing there. The coded message was something he’d learned before he’d actually learned the standard alphabet, and he read it instinctively.
“Now let’s not be hasty, lad. You
Harry looked him steadily in the eye.
complimented him before.
The infant Scorpius howled his anger at the situation in general, and the strange boy looked oddly conflicted between dealing with the intruders and comforting the child.
“Make him promise to never cast an Unforgivable Curse again.” Draco said, not looking away from his husband’s face.
Potter drew level with him, one hand reaching out to grab at Draco’s robes.
The two stared at the area around them.
Draco kneeled between his legs and stroked his thigh soothingly.
Draco crossed his arms, waiting for him to finish. Harry of course, was not so patient, and tried to talk between giggles.
“It was a rhetorical question. Just aim for red hair, can you manage that?”
“Your parent’s generation
“Then that’s what we’ll do. Who would you invite as witnesses?”
“Sorry. Muggle saying. They tend to joke about it because they don’t really remember it. I meant the parental interrogation.”
insanely dark magic, he said. And he’s a Malfoy.”
“Shh. Lucius is…can be…awful. I know.”
“What your father is trying to tell you is, you’re getting two new brothers instead of one.”
“He would have been in the Slytherin common room, proving the authenticity of his lineage, I have no doubt.” Severus said, dryly.
It was mostly blank, but in the center was a very unremarkable looking Harry Potter.
Draco paused and looked at Blaise, annoyed. He’d hoped to get into his room without delay, as this newest section of the scroll would clear up a mystery from the last.
Draco groaned, his tongue was stuck to the roof of his mouth, his body immobilized, and he was tightly bound with magical ropes.
“Ahhhh, my favorite little Lord! The powerful, glorious,
Jamina looked up at him sharply, then looked down. Draco reached out quickly and put a finger under her chin, pulling her eyes upwards.
But there had never been another person there either. He couldn’t hear now, the wind and the thunder too loud, but he thought he knew where his new friend was hiding.
Tom thought about that a moment.
“Isn’t it, though?” Draco sneered.
’s gone, if you’re sure we can make it safe, I’ll want nothing more. But while this curse is on me…this damn prophecy…I won’t take the risk.”
“Dominion, but,”
“Yes. Potter.”
He turned his irritated attention to Fred, who stood slightly in front of George, looking rather disgruntled.
Harry smiled back at his son, a little baffled by the ambiguity, but decided to go with it.
There was an intake of breath, and Draco waited for Harry to panic at the mention of a proposal. What he’d read made it apparent that the romance usually went on for months before mention of a proposal was made, among muggles.
The Floo took them directly to the Entrance Hall of the Malfoy bolthole. Not
was merely suffering the effects of Potter’s obnoxiously effective potion. Potter was the one with an extremely embarrassing fetish for incest.
“What?”
“He’s got his wand out.”
subtle at all, you know. I smelled it the second I got under that Invisibility Cloak with you. What are you wearing?”
Not for him. Not at all. Smiling didn’t do much good when there was nobody there.
Draco thought about it. Really no way to find out. At least, not using this spell.
Draco thought back to that night under the invisibility cloak. The burning magic that had sliced through him with every physical contact with the boy. Only the small taste of excess magic, the traces of Potter’s desire for him.
The twins turned as a unit to beg their other father.
“I…I think I’m going to-”
In the basement, the two faced off and cast at the same time. As Voldemort’s wand rewound through its long history of murders, Harry was almost disappointed that his parents and Cedric Diggory were missing from the litany.
“Draco.” He repeated.
Potter had taken out his wand, and was poking it carefully underneath the edge of the invisibility cloak, pointing it at the door.
He was fairly certain Potter was at the top of what must be a rather extensive list on the same section of his own scroll. But to Potter, the enmity with Draco was…just a little harmless school rivalry, apparently. Barely more important than intra-familial tensions. Obviously, logically, quite insignificant next to the greater struggle of the war.
“Not just the Gnossic. That’s one of several. But yes, some humans can control the passage of several kinds of emissions from and through their body. It seems to be genetic, although it also appears randomly for some reason. And it leads to an extremely diverse set of abilities, once an individual learns to focus it. I’m not entirely convinced your math can actually explain all of it, but there are people I respect, intellectually who insist that magic is entirely a function of this ability.”
“Are you sure all your books are in your trunk? I forgot my Potions book once and that didn’t work out so well...”
Draco needed an alibi. Blaise needed enough information to allow him to accurately choose the winning side.
Potter tore his eyes from Jamie’s face reluctantly.
“Blood. Means.
“I’ll help!”
“I think I’m going to be sick.” Weasley said, looking rather sick indeed.
“You idiots woke him up! Now you’ll get it!” he hissed.
“Huh? Oh yeah I guess it is!”
“Draco, what was that all about? She’s been very nice to me, you know. And she had a special potion that kept you from scarring from that curse.” Harry protested.
“Why, Draco? I…I loved you. Why would you…just…why?” tears, falling down his cheeks. Draco tenderly wiped them away.
“Draco!”
“Not entirely. Not yet.” Draco said, trying to smirk. His facial control was a bit off. “I
“The Marauders are a group of students at Hogwarts, who try to-” Potter began
And…yes…there were red-heads everywhere. Beyond the Weasley matriarch, the two fearsome twins who had pounced on Draco moments after he landed outside the fireplace were standing on either side of him, cracking their knuckles ominously. The dragon-handling Weasley was perched on the counter…
“I see a wand above the water, and two wands below it.” Tom said.
Kreacher spat on the floor.
The boy blinked.
Harry continued talking, not meeting his eyes.
“…go to waste, without partaking…”
Draco seized his jaw with his hands and squeezed slightly.
“Lucius. Father.” Draco spoke.
“Please?”
feel is what decides whether you’re a bully. Don’t be one. If you don’t know where the line is, don’t push it. Got it?”
“I…I see.” Ollivander examined the boy carefully. “You don’t look a day older than when I first met you.”
“Yeah, you’re right. But this isn’t a formal inheritance. It’s only supposed to be seen and used or even known of by Marauders. So if you want to see it, you have to become a Marauder, Jamie. And…you can’t tell anyone about it. That means Malfoy.” Potter said to her.
She quieted immediately, recognizing the gesture, but her eyes narrowed as she studied Draco carefully.
“Part of him?” Regulus pounced. “How?”
A quick vision spell let him check that the hex he’d set on the doorway was ready to do its clever little job as soon as the Gryffindor passed beneath it.
. And it’s not public. Just your parents, Blaise and Pansy, Hermione, Moony and the Weasleys.”
“Why, to kidnap the bride…”
Draco turned to him.
…you’re…you’re so-” Draco breathed,
Draco smiled and kissed him on the lips, letting his tongue just barely dance into his mouth before pulling back.
“Uhm. Huh?”
“We can provide you with all manner of charmed treasure chests, complete with lightening charms, anti-theft charms, state-of-the-art tamperer-imprisonment charms, and of course only for our most
to be protected from disclosure, which meant some other reason for that doubt needed to be put forward…an alibi of sorts.
Draco gasped as the greedy tugging on his magic jerked at him again, feeling like it would rip his core out of his body.
“Something I’m sure you can’t afford, Weasley.” Draco said condescendingly.
to a school full of children?
“Nothing to endanger anyone, I’ve written that into the agreement. See, Granger?”
He fired his seed into the cauldron, the lightning and thunder instantly stopping as the first drops of the substance hit the surface of the water. Draco fired three more loads before he noticed the cauldron was completely empty except for the tiny bundle of silk ribbon, stained with a bit of his own essence.
“I’ll consider it, Sir. Thank you.” Draco said, standing to leave.
Ah yes. That topic.
powerful?
“My grandfather, Abraxas, publicly declared your father, Bilius, a blood-traitor when he married the mudblood witch Alice Barclay.”
“Oh, ok, good then. Only…are you sure this is safe to drink for now?” Potter asked, his eyes already lighting up with the idea of setting off an explosion in his most hated professor’s potions cupboard.
involve sex, after all.
The old woman watched for a moment, drawn to the infectious sounds of happy youth as she leaned on the post that supported the roof over her porch. Ready to call the children and their exuberant guest in for dinner.
In seconds, Tom was staring into hypnotic green eyes as he fed his little brother for the first time.
Harry looked confused, looking down at the ‘H’ on his own chest.
“Oh. Good idea.” Potter said, throwing the invisibility cloak over it.
The two sat a moment considering it.
“…but Draco’s pregnant!”
Potter was more afraid of losing, or perhaps killing, everyone around him, than he was of the Dark Lord. How odd.
you?”
“I can read the label, Potter.” Draco snapped.
Draco nodded slowly, his head almost bowing in the motion.
Draco quickly conjured a small temporary mirror and checked himself.
“It means,” Madame Pomfrey announced, “that you’re pregnant.”
“Kreacher”
“I think I’d rather be held to my word more solidly, actually. It’s not an easy thing to restore a family name that means “bad faith”. Better to be seen to uphold my oath than to have the object appear out of thin air if I take too long.” Draco suggested.
Raised by Muggles, Draco reminded himself. Immensely powerful wizard, but raised by stupid Muggles. Of course he knows nothing of any of this.
“And he has to know
There was a protesting noise from Potter which quickly escalated as Pomfrey magically froze his arms at his sides.
Now if only Draco could find out what all his mentor had discovered inside the Gryffindor’s thick skull.
“Good evening students! I’m pleased to welcome you all to yet another wonderful year at Hogwarts! This year we have a few changes that I’m sure many of you will be happy to take advantage of. We will be offering two new elective courses, one in Ritual Magic and one in Hybrid Magic. These are available to students in fourth year and on, with exceptions made for younger students who can pass an entrance test.”
“My grandfather, Abraxas, humbly begs forgiveness. From his friend, Bilius. For being an unworthy friend. For not understanding the order of values to which such a friendship belonged. For not understanding what it was.”
“Blood-relative.” Potter snorted.
Already, Potter’s scroll had to be different from everybody else’s.
Draco snorted.
Regulus fought back the horrid tight feeling behind his eyes at the thought of his missing twin.
A beautiful red-haired woman with Potter’s same green eyes, flashing protectively as she shielded him from someone.
No. But Draco was a Slytherin, his arsenal not limited to the
Then he licked Harry’s cheek.
The boys all leaned in, eager to hear what would happen to Edgar.
making sure one Gryffindor was keeping his eyes closed as promised.
“Testor Paterfamilias Draco Malfoy. Cedo Paterfamilias.” Narcissa added.
Draco stormed into Malfoy Manor like an icy wind, his robes swirling crisply behind him as his feet snapped down harshly onto the polished marble.
The desk received several creative and violent spells, its magically-enriched wood absorbing their power until eventually a simple severing curse broke it cleanly down the middle, the two sides falling away from each other like a newly split cordwood.
of us, because we are cunning, and because some wizards have used their cunning in cruel ways.”
“If I succeed, the Malfoys will become more powerful than any family since the Founders.”
She turned and did a very good job of concealing the instinctive flinch as she recognized him.
Frankie nodded, recognizing this was the best assurance he’d get from only the one twin.
“Oh. Okay, then.”
“Lord Draco of Malfoy”
James just grinned, wriggling a bit as the hat’s brim fell down almost over his eyes.
The food disappeared.
Frankie looked at the diagram carefully.
Draco stood up and led the way to the office door, his father following.
“Draco!” Pansy squealed in delight, in full public empty-headed girlfriend mode. “You came to breakfast! Where have you been all evening?”
“The Wrackspurts. They’re all over you dude.”
The Slytherins finally decided that it was acceptable for Jamie to be tutored by the Mudblood, but only because it was necessary for her cover as a spy.
treasure chests, Lord Malfoy. After the first chest there is the matter of a quantity order, which involves additional fees, which I’m sure will not be a problem for one such as yourself-”
“Voldemort always feared Death more than anything. He thought it was ignominious.” Harry told him. “He never understood that there are far worse things a person could do to themselves.”
“I’d say it means he has a great deal more
Draco suddenly felt foolish standing there next to the sitting boy. He walked back and resumed his own seat.
“Kreacher.” Draco whispered.
“This isn’t my room. It’s just Hogwarts.” Draco said dismissively, kneeling before his trunk.
Draco glared at the interfering witch before pushing the very embarrassed Harry off him so he could get out of the hospital bed.
“My…my range?”
“~~Such a waste…~~”
“Isss this true, Luciusss?”
“Slytherin?”

could be as useful as an Imperious curse.
“But you said the Seeker was the key to the game, that their offense was shite, and if we just take out Potter we can run up the score until you catch the snitch.”
“It sounds perfect.”
at him!!!).
Lucius looked at his son in dismay. The use of his first name suggested Draco was speaking as Lord of Malfoy, rather than as his concerned son.
“Thank you for explaining so kindly. I’ll look forward to talking with you more in the future.”
Draco simply nodded.
“Well you know dragonsblood naturally raises the temperature of anything it touches, especially if it has no room to expand. Glumbumble when heated forms a rather strong crystalline solid that expands rapidly as it soaks in heat, attaching itself to the nearest solid anchor. So, when the two are unleashed inside a closed container, such as a
“Why do you think that?” she asked quickly.
“Well. I guess most of that’s true. Their main activity is usually pranks, and they do get into trouble a lot. The current set of Marauders does some other things though. In first year we prevented Voldemort from getting his hands on the Philosopher’s Stone.”
“Well it was because we were both heirs of Slytherin. Draco said the curse he used meant he could use my soul to protect himself, somehow.
“Whoa, them ‘Spurts got you bad, mate.”
“That’s not in any of the books…”
The boy frowned, raising his wand again, an invisible force pushing the two back from the cradle a couple steps.
“Declino a creator pestis omnis” he moaned, gagging.
“Yes Master Draco! Kreacher found the artifact Master Draco is wanting! Very powerful and Dark! Kreacher has never felt so frisky, Kreacher had to enjoy himself with the statue of the beautiful wood-elf Laliarana in the back garden after touching the wonderful, wonderful Dark magic! Would Master Draco like to meet the Lady Laliarana as well?”
want Zabini to be informed-” his godfather started.
“What was it like?”
Harry came bounding back down the grand staircase, silvery garment in hand.
James and Regulus paused.
Draco considered him for a moment, then pointed his wand down at him, judging carefully.
The man was red in the face, but carefully removed his hands from both boys.
. Do I make myself clear?”
Potter seemed taken aback by the distinction.
“Sure go ahead. He’s just lazy.”
“I have my sources.” Draco smirked.
Of course. It
“You would…allow us to take these memories home with us?” Murdoch asked, incredulous.
Jamie jumped slightly and narrowed her eyes at the blonde-haired man regarding them from the other side of the room.
The lightning suddenly shot upwards towards his face eagerly, through the steady stream of sick he was emitting. Draco went rigid as the lightning shot into his body that way, licking down to his stomach and causing the last bit of vomit to heave spectacularly out and into the cauldron in one horrible lurch.
. Case closed.
“Quite likely…most would not learn the totalis variation anywhere near your age, my boy.”
Draco raised a quizzical eyebrow at his husband. Harry quickly translated.
“I don’t care about those! I never wanted any of it! But I won’t give up the memories of the only father I ever knew!” Potter raged.
Harry’s eyes sprang open immediately, then widened dramatically, his mouth working soundlessly as he took in the sight Draco had prepared for him.
“Oh. Okay, Regulus then. If James gets into Gryffindor do you suppose the three of us will hang out all the time like your father and the Weasley’s did?”
“But I want a wedding!”
Potter closed his eyes, no doubt remembering how Sirius had died.
“Well we could access the ARSE but I really have no idea how to use it.”
“I promise, I’ll keep them closed till you say.”
“Do this? Do you want me?”
“Protego! Everte Statum! Alecto Fodius!”
“Yessss? And how can this be, when we disssaagree?”
“James, oh my god is that a WWW wrapper?”
“Would you spend Christmas with me? Meet my…adopted family?”
“I want you to. I…I never thought you could love me, this is all so impossible I feel like I’m in a dream…” Harry whispered quietly.
Harry smiled at him.
“And responsibility.” James chimed in.
He was rewarded by a blush as the Gryffindor suddenly avoided eye contact.
“Nooo!”
Bellatrix stepped out of the Cabinet just in time to see the green light hit Fenrir squarely in the back.

“You get me, Lysander.”
“True. You’re a shit actor, Potter.”

The chatter was cut off abruptly by a shower of sparks from Draco’s hawthorne wand.
That would be a

Draco shushed him again.
Thomas looked up and graced them a serene smile.

Ron was beet red at this point, and several of the Gryffindors were now poking each other and giggling over both having a pet Fuzzywuggum at the age of five,
He leant down and kissed him.
“Grindelwald and Dumbledore were lovers.” Draco said.
His blue eyes were bright with curiosity.
Draco nodded shortly and followed the Headmaster to his office, feeling Moody’s strange eye on him the whole while.
“No, no. My dad told me about them. What’s a dude?” Regulus said impatiently.
Draco took an involuntary step back.
“He knows I’m
“My son and Granger have started this, in our culture. But I gather they are here to gather the army of minds that will be needed to move this forward, and eventually, I am certain, their plan is to break this into your world. Maybe much later, after we are all long dead. But eventually, yes.”
“But isn’t that the same-”
Draco neatly folded his napkin and rose gracefully to his feet.
Draco paused, then nodded.
“Do you take me for a Hufflepuff, father? If there will be a wizard more powerful than Harry, or than our sons, it will be this one. I have given my son a powerful, utterly loyal ally for life. If they are inclined, they may transform the bond into a marriage bond one day and even further enrich our family line.”
His father was waiting for him outside the office door.
Harry and Draco clasped hands.
“NOT in my hospital ward!” Madame Pomfrey scolded, popping back around the corner without warning. “There are impressionable
“And this…magic. What can it do?”
“James! James, you’re a Potter though, right?
“No, just a plot to marry him and have his babies.” Draco was mortified at this point, thankful that at his age the Veritaserum at least gave him the small dignity of a flat, hypnotized-sounding voice and slack face.
“Harry…you said once that Hogwarts is like your real home, mate.” Ron reminded him. “Hogwarts is way bigger than Malfoy Manor.”
