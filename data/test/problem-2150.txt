She’s also sure of one thing. The man is full of experience and she dreads whether she wants to be scared at that or check it for herself. But as her body stepped closer to the man, she learned what her body chose.
“Wouldn’t you like that, little kitten?” Harry nibbled on that one sensitive spot. He hit it home and licked in a way he can make Draco bend to his will, “Fill you to the brim? Hmm?”
“Take your time. I do not wish to rush you” he knew how rushing omegas tend to be stressful on their side, “Tell me when you can, yeah?”
Draco’s whole body flushed furiously at his admission. Acutely aware of their conjoined hands below the table made it hard to eat with one hand. Harry’s hand was huge and calloused against his own. But warmer than any hand Draco had the chance of touching.
Weeks ago, he was this mysterious, collected man. Now, Dracy sees no one but a man who’s trying to change, trying to sway her off her feet. Beyond every possibility her mind could shape.
“Wait a second, kitten” he mumbled as he stepped inside the bathroom and fetched a damp cloth to clean them both with it. Gathering Draco in his arms, he began to dab the cloth along his skin, apologizing at the marks he left to his lovely client,
“Get away!” Draco tried to push him off but Harry gripped him tight, “Doll, listen. We need to leave, alright?” he whispered and nodded at the bartender before turning around.
He nibbled on his lower lip as Harry extended his hand on his spine, fingers now grazing the side of his waist and giving a light pinch before completely retracting, “Excuse me for a minute. I remember I have to call my secretary”
He’ll be late if he’ll wait until she wakes up. He had half a mind to eat alone then go to the Ministry right after but half of his mind wanted to go knock on her door and wake her up. Folding his daily supply of Witch Weekly, he stood up and decided for the latter.
See? He's still on his teens but fuck, Harry can feel his pulse fastening because the way Draco's fingers are toying with his cup is very inappropriate. He gripped his pants tight and looked away trying to retain the knowledge of the number three of the House of Potter rules.
Chapped lips lapping his soft ones. His warmth heating Draco in a nice comforting way as they move gently, sharing a lot of emotions and vigor.
Dracy, herself, is lying on his bed sleeping. He took a deep breath and reminded himself that she’s pregnant. Walking over to his bed, he gently nudged her awake.
Then they began to converse with such boredom Harry isn’t very much thrilled at. So, to get matters a little more exciting, he sits closer to Draco and occasionally throw in ridiculously attractive smirks then and there and winking at Star who sat in silence with a red taint on her face.
Draco was beginning to swim in the sensations. His cock desperate for release as it leaked precum to his lower abdomen, thighs trembling. He shivered profusely when Harry suddenly snaked a hand to his stomach down to his pelvis to the tip of his hand,
Someone coughed he didn’t recognize because his attention is all glued to this man, who is in all aspect of reality, a muggle but in some alternate world, must be the most powerful wizard alive.
Draco doesn’t care if Harry have a little knowledge that he’s a wizard or not, if he so much agrees to this nonsense, he will cast a very painful stupefy over his way.
He was about to knock again when he thought of just opening the door. He turned the knob and pushed the door open, eyes locked to the floor immediately as they were then separated from the outside world, the room muting the noises outside.
He found eyes were on the both of them and Harry glared. He had never felt disappointment in Gaydar before but now. Well, people around him love to gossip absolutely just about anything. Even things that really don’t matter.
Draco instantly closed his eyes and moaned. His hands encircling around Harry’s nape and kissed back. Their kiss was slow, not rush and harsh. It was nothing from the way they kissed few days ago.
He sighed for several times, he tilted his head to the side and stared at the door. His fingers tapping just above his lap, mulling over his choices.
“Professor,” he paused, eyes focused on the intrinsic lines of her desk, “What is really happening?”
And btw just wanna share, I saw this video on ig of voldemort pole dancing and I'm cry laughing!!! It was too hilarious lmao.
“Hmm. Already so wet, baby” he praised, fingers spreading her pussy lips before sliding a finger in, twisting and thrusting it expertly. Harry knows when to slid in and out, knows when to twist, knows how to explore and it’s driving her insane. The need to come has her moaning and sobbing out for more attention.
He gasped when he felt Harry brushing his knickers aside and engulfed the head of his weeping cock, his tongue licking the precum coming out and growling. He’s so hot. Harry’s mouth is so hot, felt so good and he had a hard time controlling himself.
“Harry, Harry, I-I’m. . .” she cut herself off, unable to finish the sentence as she arched her back into the air and gushed out her orgasm, moaning at her overstimulation  as the Alpha did not pause or even slowed down with his movements.
He cleared his throat awkwardly. Sometimes Luna just creeps him out. She’s too observant for her own good. Able to see things before others can. Almost seer-like but not really so— which is even scarier.
The two of them chuckled at Andy’s enthusiasm. They watched her waved a her hand and the image disappear, “For the next month, we will be checking you up twice and probably determine your due date”
He didn’t waste his time to devour her. His tongue slid to her covered pussy, tasting her through the cloth and teasing her clit above her. Dracy arched her back and gripped his hair. Her eyes shut and was mewling softly.
So, to hear Harry tell her she’s an equal, it was such a nice but frightening to hear. There were times she longed to have what Harry is telling her and finally, having the chance to have it now seemed to be too dangerous.
He was so ready to talk, face the issue, and only to find himself alone with Dobby. He left with no note and when he asked the elf, he doesn’t even know what to answer.
"We're going to the Nott Residence. Do your know where that is?" Draco asked him and felt Harry nodded.
He’d been taking to Pansy about Harry and the way he left him twice. She was mad but they really can’t do anything, can they?
He lick Draco’s nape and began to feel those cheeks against his palm. Fuck. So good. So plump. So sexy. And so sinful. Oh merlin, he’s sinful and he loves it. He can feel his mind clouded of pure lust. Clouded from right judgment because all he has right now is to make him his.
“Enough” he cut her off. Voice going cold and jaw clenched which thankfully, really did shut her up. He stood up from their couch and sighed. He can understand what Hermione is trying to point out and he’s not really sure whether he’s up for it.
“That’s what you want, isn’t it?” Harry grabbed his hand and Draco gasped as he guided it to touch his own hard cock. He gulped at the massive size and girth he can feel even with his jeans covering it
All throughout his time on the pub, he only served a number of customers, some who came in for a quick snack and coffee for afternoon time. He thought they’re taking a rest on the motel they’re staying at, considering they’ve been stuck at his pub for days and just wanted to relax on their beds.
“Sssh” Harry shushed her, his hands going to her ass and began to play with both cheeks while humping her to his lap.
She bit her lips when Harry began to sniff her and afterwards licked at her collarbone, “Ngh” she whimpered when he bit her on her neck and sucked hard.
“Tell me,” he paused, another inhale of his cigarette before tossing the remains on the ashtray, he blew a smoke out, eyes glued directly to his, “What would you want to do, Draco?”
He waved a hand on the both of them to clean them of the residue of the naughtiness they pulled at St. Mungos . He kissed her on her forehead before pulling back completely, “Feeling better?”
Sighing blissfully, he stood up from the dining chair and walked over to Harry standing shirtless by the stove, cooking their dinner. He hugged him from behind as the toll of today instantly melted with the problems Harry helped him solve, gone with the smoke, whisked away by Harry’s mere presence.
Draco beamed happily and instantly took hold of the dazzling bouquet. It’s so stunning and they are so creatively arranged. So pleasing and Draco felt so appreciated with the little gift. It may not be much but to receive something from him is such a nice feeling.
He raised back up and looked at Draco’s whole figure. So small in his broad frame, paler into the darkness and glowing under the moonlight that seeps in from the glass window around the corner. His eyes were closed and the way he would murmur things and call out to him, he wants to fuck him then.
He vaguely felt it when Harry pulled both of his legs apart to give room and began to grazed through his perineum before pulling back. Draco whined, wanting to feel it longer but Harry shushed him down and spat on his fingers before continuing.
“Uhm” Ron began, his palms rubbing over his jeans and sighing, “What makes you think your decision of buying her out of the place she used to work in wasn’t a big step?”
Harry seemed to be in deep thought so he let the man to his own mind. Watching the woods burn in the fireplace, he sighed.
It’s his favorite sight especially when he caught the ring on his finger, shining with the moonlight. Of course, he made sure to get one that displayed a real diamond. Nearly draining out his money with its cost but no worries, he could easily earn it back for the next few days.
He sighed. He needs to find something useful. After surveying the second floor, he decided to go downstairs and hope to anyone there’s something he could use because
Harry pulled back and smiled at her. He removed her clothes before he laid her down gently on the bed and dived to kiss all of her body.
What’s dress up for this little alone time for them both? Have been nothing but perfect. She wanted to thank him but what sincerity will her words hold if she do nothing to prove them?
Harry looked up at Draco and immediately felt his chest warming. That blissful expression he had while leaning his cheek on his palm, the smile, and that angelic beauty. How he would’ve love to take a photo out of it, put it in a frame, adorned with latin scribbling of compliments, with words of adoration, and his prowess.
He watched him took something out of his jean pockets and to say his jaw drop was understatement. His mind went slack and his body gone rigid as he took in Harry kneeling.
Draco frowned, “You like everyone” he pushed for his point. He has been Harry’s secretary for years and he knows how playboy Harry is. He changes his partners like how he changes his clothes. Frequently. And Draco will never indulge himself for a quick fuck even though this brickhouse has got the most delicious muscles he had ever laid his eyes upon.
Harry growled and fasten his movements. He was sure his eyes are glazed with pure need to cum inside his mouth, desperate to paint his face of his white and sticky juice and have him asking for it pleadingly but still trying to retain the image of innocence and purity even when the both of them knew how corrupted Draco is.
“H-harry. Nggh” she supported herself by the elbows and buried her head between them as she began to grow even more desperate and the next thing she notices, she was begging.
Harry handed the letter to Hedwig who flew away immediately. He sighed and looked down at his bulge. His hand itches to jerk off and release the pent-up urges in his system but tries to hold himself back.
But one problem she can see in this is, it’s Harry James Potter. The Alpha that’s loved by many, followed by everyone because of the known Potter Tragedy, the Alpha that’s idolized by many, and the Alpha she never expected she could ever have.
And when the door opened and one by one, people clad in such a depressing color of all black outfits came in. In uniform of their signature leather jackets. They instantly fill the whole place of their noises as they took their seats in anywhere the wanted.
He cried out when Harry bit on his inner thigh before he pulled away and pushed his body up. He pecked him on his stomach, his hand playing with his rock hard cock. The heat on his palm is rightly hugging Draco’s erection.
He peered at her, eyes looking past the dreamy smile. He stared at her face, the way there was softness in them as much as there was glow in her. There was no traces of the Luna before, the one who was bullied for believing in something different.
They walked inside the Great Hall, ignoring the looks they got mostly from the first year class. As they make their way to the eight year table, he noticed Seamus and Dean are beaming at them both.
Harry pinched the bridge of his nose and sighed. He looked at her straight in the eyes in silence for a whole minute before he spoke, “You’re distressed. You should take a rest”
She noticed the way her pussy seemed to throb and felt the little slick that oozed out of her hole and wet her lacy knickers.
His parents are no longer with him (that’s a story he isn’t prepared to cross) but Remus and Sirius are, who’s constantly getting knocked up. The two are already married and happily bonded for years.
“Hush, love. There’s no need to rush” Harry whispered but entered one finger inside, “Taking me so well, love. Daddy’s good baby”
It’s the process that started to build anticipation inside him. The one that started to steadily boil, not yet gnawing like a tiger is to its prey but was stirring him up with his nerves in frenzy.
“Nothing that concerns your idiot ass. If I get some useful info before you get to where I am, I get all the kisses I want”
Harry propped his chin on his palm and hummed calmly. Half a percent already regretting taking the job and the other half regretting letting Draco attend this cursed party of horny teens. This is wrong. So wrong. So indecent. Especially the way Draco is leaning his petite frame over the guy. It's fucking enough for Harry to see little red dots over his eyes.
She took a deep breath. She know she’ll be satisfied. But this line they’re going to cross would breach a subject they both need to talk to in the future. Her pussy gushed when she felt a kiss in her ear, lips barely touching her skin but it’s there, she felt it.
They looked at him as if he was a saint with no skeletons in the closet. Maybe they’re wrong as somewhere in his cabinet back at Grimmauld Place, he hides a secret only that well-confined furniture knows about.
“Nah uh! Mama, look at Scorp!” he giggled and pointed at Scorpius who was busy munching off the flour from his fingers. Dracy slowly padded to his side, careful not to slip on the mess all over the floor.
She had noticed how contrasting his statements are. The more sexual and non-sexual obligations will happen if Harry needs them and not when she want them but just now, he claimed she deserved to be treated as equal.
He grumbled annoyed at the prospect of not being able to tell that story. For now, that is. He giggled, forming a plan in his mind how to best tell the story and exaggerate it a bit.
“They aren’t just words. They’re words but not just words. Do you see me not smiling when you say you love me? Did you not see me cry when you told me I wasn’t worth it? Did you not see Hermione offended when I called her mudblood? Did you not see Ron angry when I called him blood traitor? Did you not see Pansy tried to sacrifice you to the dark lord just because?”
He hates Harry! And kisses? Meant nothing. This is for the mission. Just an angry kisses. Kisses for enemies. He was fast to locked his hands on Harry nape and returned the fire. He let out a keening noise when Harry slammed him to the left side of the aisle.
Draco sighed and regarded him for moment. He looked like he wants to say something but decided not to. Harry wanted to say something too, wanted to tell him that what happened last night was a mistake but also decided not to so he apparated to the Ministry.
Dracy didn’t want to look at how would those eyes are staring at him but she was compelled to. So, when she turned her eyes and gaze at the handsome man, she nearly gasped for the soft smile that took its place on his lips.
If he’s not so busy, he would call at night, talk to him and hum huskily ‘til he falls asleep and other times, he seduces him from the call, instructing him how to touch himself, edge himself, before he is allowed to cum.
Alright. That’s a little bit predatory. Red sign number one. Harry took note. His jaw clenched for a bit as they shook hands, noticing the tight grip this cockybee right here had with Draco.
Sometimes Harry is jealous of that but at times, he’s glad he’s not yet bonded to anyone. As some Purebloods who hates his name claimed that he doesn’t have a heart. At times he agreed with it if only they knew what happens behind closed doors.
He closed the pub after an hour with a sullen mood. Looking around to see himself alone like he used to. He began to walk along the gutter, kicking stones and constantly checking in on his phone. He was hoping that maybe Harry’s messages just got delayed and he’ll call up in any second.
Until a few seconds later, a green square hologram with black lines around it floated jut above her tummy.
He had a point. They’ve been weird all the time. Harry was regarded different and Draco was called freak. Why question this good kind of strange now? Because even if it is, would it be so wrong to let himself be a little selfish? Uninhibited?
Harry looked at it and shrugged, “Luna gave it to me. Saying something about keeping wrackspurts away. Why— oh”
But he cannot help the thoughts that dawned on him as he regarded the look on Harry’s eyes. He was acutely aware that what they need to do is to talk but will he manage to blurt out the truth? Will he be able to handle Harry’s anger for leaving him there kneeling?
Life is progressing. Time passes by and he wouldn’t wait around thinking whether these things are because of the potion, pearl dust or Hogwarts itself.
“I lost my parents when I was four” he started with a very personal topic. Something he’d never talked to anyone but he will with her just to make her at least a little more comfortable. She was so stiff when she was sitting in his lap. Harry may want a submissive omega but he doesn’t like forced submission.
Draco glared, cussed, and tried to bewitched every living thing in their office as Pansy, Blaise and even Harry’s bestfriends, bushy haired nerdy girl Hermione and redheaded bitter candy Ron Weasley looked at him with amusement.
She looked up from her plate when she heard Harry called her. Humming at him in question, she waited for what he has to say.
Andy was fast on her feet to greet with a smile as they stepped inside, the woman closing the door to give them privacy. Her eyes alternated between hers and Harry’s before it settled on her tummy with gentleness.
The hidden meaning and indication that came with those questions is something that tickled Harry's nape. The excitement is building and increasing inside him and what disaster and blessing would it be for the upcoming days he's gonna stay with the Young boy in their Manor.
His arms are encircled tightly around Harry's waist and he can feel how ripped he is beneath the shirt and Draco wanted to touch his bare skin. When he saw him opened the door and reveal him wearing that tight shirt, it's enough to drive him in need. He looks bloody gorgeous and he can only imagine his friends and friends' friends reaction upon seeing Harry Potter with him. The famous future head of the House of Potter.
She saw Harry rolling his sleeves to his elbow, his coat laying at the arm of the couch. He noticed her presence instantly and Dracy took note of his expression. Something hot and cold at the same time.
“Hand me the Ashwinder egg—Ashwinder egg, Potter, merlin that’s cricket’s balls” Draco rolled his eyes exasperatedly, “Yes, that’s it”
He took a deep breath, watching the muscles on Harry’s back flex as he moved and grabbed something from the cabinet. The way they danced along his skin on sync, as if there were some guide helping them.
Luna’s smile widened and she shook her head, “Blibbering humdingers? You don’t know that? They’re quite famous”
She cannot control herself as she let out moans after moans, her hips wanting to grind against his face but his strong grip stopped her.
True, he can agree with Harry’s statement that the time he chose to propose isn’t the most romantic of all neither is it extravagant but the thought that it came from Harry is perfect. And considering that beefy biker is his boyfriend makes it even more lovable.
Ron nodded and shrugged, “So, what’s your plan? Have you figured it out yet whether you want to mark her or not?”
He jumped in surprise, having the audacity to look embarrassed getting caught snooping around. He smiled sexily, masking his shaking nerves and crossing his fingers, “I was just playing around”
Draco perked up, hands encircling around Harry’s nape, “What is it?” he giggled, hands playing with the hairs on Harry’s nape, “I learned it from Seamus years ago when he was still crushing on Dean. Never thought I’d try to use it”
Not to mention, the eyes that can hold everything down effortlessly. The muscles, the strength and the kind seriousness written all over his face. Every little thing turns him on.
She sighed, “Oh, Harry.” she clicked her tongue, “Dracy have been through so much. Her home was taken away from her. Give her another”
"Don't challenge me, little boy" he said coldly, masking the way his cock throbbed inside his jeans. He refuses to act on it.
Harry chuckled once more, dipping his head low and peck a kiss on his cheek, “Already begging nicely for daddy. You sound so angelic, my love”
“Doll!” he smiled, carrying a huge heart shaped box of chocolates. He leaned down and was about to give a kiss on his cheeks when Draco raised a hand and slapped him.
Harry took his cock on his mouth, sucking in the precome and his tongue played with his crown. His fingers slowly finger fucking Draco, purposely avoided his prostate, he loves this. He loves how responsive Draco is to him and how loud he is getting.
She panted when Harry gave a feathery kiss at her nape, the exact place where he could bite his mark to claim her and left the place to get to the counter. She blinked for several times. These kind of moments are hunting her.
The way his tongue circled his nipples. All his efforts were worth it. He got him. He got Harry. The gentleness and roughness mixed in equally. He moaned loudly when he felt Harry rubbed his erection on him, the material of his trousers scratching his legs, he tightened his hand around him and pulled him closer.
"That's your guard?" Pansy asked Draco in disbelief as she pointed at Harry standing in the distance, leaning on the wall with hands on his pocket and looking over the window. He is wearing a tight auror robes that did everything to stir Draco's inner slut.
As their teams packed to get back to the Ministry for debriefing, they remained in the place. Tangled in each other’s arms as Harry ripped his clothes away. Lips nipping at the column of his throat, hands groping his ass, kneading the soft flesh in his rough palms.
They stared at one another as Harry fucked him through and through. His jaw clenched at the glorious sight as he stick his tongue out, catching his tear and groaning.
To have him on his bed is something that felt too impossible and yet, here they are. Kissing, moaning, writhing flesh touching rough skin.
“Move” Dracy cried out and Harry started to move slowly. Feeling her warmth and the slick lubricating him. Her pussy is perfect. The sweet scent enveloping them both and the reality that he had her under him, naked and writhing with lips parted and her nails digging through his back. Scratching and marking in some way ways.
hello! Okay so I used the character i invented, Valsken Vokbin from my oneshot Sing Me Your Nonsense. :))
“Can we come in?” Blaise asked though he didn’t bother waiting for an answer, he shoved Draco to the side and stepped in. Pansy shrugged at him and followed.
his mind supplied and he huffed. Even his own mind’s contradicting him now. And that maybe because he didn’t use it on the time he should.
Draco preened and within a second, his cum shoot out into the sheets, some coating Harry’s fingers and he felt his hole body shivered as how tight Draco was clenching around him. His sight white visioned as he came inside him, easily following Draco’s orgasm and he groaned.
He tense for a bit. What does that mean? But before they can even respond, Tom stepped forward and handed Harry a small square envelope that had their heart racing.
The man who prided himself with his big fat ego was no less than she is when she was still at the bar she used to work in. There were huge circles on his eyes, skinny and his hair was messy.
If it wasn’t for Harry’s agile reflexes, he would be on the floor right now. His thick arm encircled his waist to steady him and when Draco was able to process the action, he gasped and pushed him off.
Harry growled before tensing, his kind eyes flashing with heat that had Draco shuddering and goosebumps erupting in his skin. His jaw clenched as he let his eyes fall from Draco’s face down to his exposed neck to his chest.
He whimpered, gave control to the man known for dominance. He let Harry’s chapped ones touch his plump lips. He let his tongue control the movements, let his large callous hands grip his silky hair.
Up until now, she cannot believe how lucky she was to have someone like Harry on her life. Her savior. She imagined the day she can finally say those three words, three words that would bind her to him eternally. Never mind about marking for now.
“H-hello” she said and looked at Harry who smiled at her, “Hermione, Ron, this is Dracy, Dracy, these are my friends” he introduced.
“You don’t see your mistake, do you? When you bought her for thousands of galleons, what did she think? She felt she’s treated like a thing to be owned. And I hope you’re not going to treat her like that, Harry. Not because she’s an omega she should be someone who will only do what you need of her”
“Why don’t you go keep him some company, Harry? There was a reason the potion accident happened after all”
He was about to demand and say yes when Harry suddenly spat on his fingers and bringing them back down as he encircled his rim. He widened his legs cooperatively as he shuddered at being played down where he wants to be.
He was smiling joyfully, excited by the celebration that awaits them at the Great Hall with all the others who decided to stay back.
“D-daddy” he whispered, looking at him pleadingly, “P-please” he arched his back, hoping to entice a reaction from him but all Harry did was to growl.
She turned around and was about to rush to the kitchen when a hand around her wrist stopped her. Harry turned her around easily and met her eyes. He stared at her for a long time and slowly, he raised a hand and cupped her cheeks.
She didn’t take her eyes off of him when he massaged her feet, fingers softly caressing her skin, and his palm gliding at the sole of her foot before going back up to her ankle and pressed a gentle hand.
Harry chuckled before carrying him bridal style. He walked over to the driver’s seat and unlocked the car. He carefully sat inside with Draco in his lap. He helped the blissed out man stretch his feet to the passenger's and hugged him by the waist.
Draco bit his lips before he granted him of what he wanted, “I thought you’re coming back at lunch time”
Harry slid his hand up to grip the back of Draco’s head, not wanting his angel to hurt himself. He thrusted harder, milking his prostate and wanting Draco to come first before he lets himself.
“Chocolates for my sweet sugar! Excuse me, coming through” Harry announced just as he stepped inside his department after another exhausting meeting with Shacklebee who did not even let him give the chocolates to Draco first before literally dragging him inside that office.
“I wouldn’t want to disappoint you and fail her” he raised a hand, fingers gracing Draco’s wrist, skimming and brushing his soft skin. It was enough to rouse goosebumps at the nape of his neck, “I read your paper”
“My mom was pregnant when she was killed and w-when you told me you are, I j-just got this memories and thought a-about the sibling I s-should’ve—
She sobbed on her hands. She doesn’t think she can afford to lose Harry. She had grown fond of him and was hoping to bond with him but she really doesn’t know now.
“Oh, darling little one, have you seen yourself dance? I’m charmed” Harry smirked, eyes closing then a goofy smile erupted from his face. Completely different from the serious one he saw a while ago.
Draco nodded, taking his spent energy to pull his jeans up. His body leaned at the wall behind him as he watched Harry fixed himself before clearing his throat.
He even greeted some of the staffs he passed by, smiling at them, even the ones he’d never talked to since he started his post and most of them, if not all, were looking at him weirdly while the others respectively greeted him back.
She almost didn’t notice the song that began to play. The tune slow and sultry. It roared around like an alluring set of music to tone up the tension between them. She didn’t pay any mind when people began to dance around them, the way they were ignored as if they weren’t even dare but she knew, she knew they aren’t.
Draco tried to, he cleared his throat but Harry didn’t even look at him and when he was done, he stood up and quickly went to his bedroom to start on with his work.
She wasn’t sure whether she has the energy to be mad at her father now. She felt bad before, she often questioned his actions in her mind, as she lay awake in her bed, she doubted the love her father has for their family.
When the man came back, he was holding a first aid kit, a damp towel, new shirt and a soothing aroma of chamomile tea. He kneeled in front of him, his whole face illuminated by the low light coming from above.
She moaned loudly as Harry inserted another finger, gathering enough slick to coat his fingers and begin to thrust and twisting just the right way to prod at the spot. Dracy felt sparks shoot along her spine as she grumbled how good Harry is to eat her. Her hands began to feel numb from their hold on Harry’s head so she moved and fisted the sheets instead.
Harry hummed, continuing to cook their dinner. Draco raised his head and began to pepper soft kisses along Harry’s back, in all of his scars, the marks that tethered Draco to cry in his pillows every second of his absence. Praying he make it out alive, strong, and still brave like his daddy before he left with the determined look to come back with a win.
Blaise smirked and stood up. He grabbed Pansy by the hand and immediately kissed her deep. She gasped for a second before responding back and encircling her hands to his nape.
“H-harry” she stuttered, not sure whether she’s to catch her mouth or cradle her tummy to control that emotions rushing through her like a broken dam.
They haven’t talked about it yet. Not yet decided whether he’ll go to the Burrow or stay back in Hogwarts to celebrate.
Harry will hate her! He will throw her out! He will kick her out! And where would she go? How will she return from her former job? How is she going to survive in a rundown apartment? Or is she going to live in the streets? No! She cannot!
She removed the glasses and gestured towards the path, “I think we missed the carriages. I hope we’ll be on time to have some pudding”
Sirius’ smug smirking face turned into a serious scowl, “I knew that patronus is much more major than a telltale of what happened”
It wasn’t by fate or someone else taking control from him. No, this time it’s all a matter of personal decision. It was a matter of his own mind, body, and soul taking over what other people have been controlling.
“That doesn’t go there!” Draco gruntled exasperatingly, hands on his hips as he watched Seamus try to place the decorations on the huge Christmas tree in the Great Hall. Having given the job to put it up by Professor Flitwick and Headmistress McGonagall.
She bit her lips and sighed, fiddling with her fingers and continuously trying to ask Hermione if she knows anything. But she would easily say no and go back to what she is doing. Read.
He changed his glare into a daringly sweet smile as he inhaled the sweet aroma of coffee and the hush noises of people conversing to one another. There was also a soft mellow of lo-fi music filling the place and as he zeroed in, he saw their target waiting for his order at the counter.
Harry takes what he wants when he wanted them and Draco gave without complain. For Draco didn’t trust himself to confront the man. He isn't naturally a fighter but in this, he was. Not in a good way but surely in a bad way. He fought his own self, disregarded his dignity, for in fear of what he can hear in Harry’s mouth.
Dracy gulped before trying to open her mouth to answer the man who just bought her, “S-some men in the bar”
He nearly threw a fit when neither looked up. Crossing his arms to his chest, he stomp a foot to the floor, waiting for them to look up. And it took minutes before Harry turned his eyes to his, they were playful and challenging.
He shrugged. He doesn’t care anyways. Shacklebee loves him. He wouldn’t fire this exuberating Alpha who has been demeaned by the rumors outside his work life. He’s just a man, right?
Dracy cannot stop whimpering. The feeling of having a cock buried inside her, on heat is comforting and relaxing. For the very first time, she experienced what it is like to be in heat and having an Alpha try to ease you from suffering. She moaned wantonly. Harry’s controlled strength so he wouldn’t crush her followed by his pounding after pounding was fascinating.
Harry is surely messing with him and having fun with it. That man one day will going to get it! How is Draco acting like this with simple actions? He hates him! He hates him! He’s annoying and pissy and shitface!
She threw her pillow across the room and stood up. No. No. This is her omega hormones. She’s just horny. How could she honestly love that bastard? She can’t! That man is a galaxy out of black holes, the shine of her dim world. He’s handsome, chivalrous, nice, and a strong alpha and she loves him?! Ridiculous!
He’s been staring at the window nonstop and kept on glancing at the pendulum clock attached at the wall in the living room. It’s already nine in the evening and where is he? He’s beginning to grow worried sick.
, fuck” he tried uselessly, words coming out muddled because of Harry’s grip around his neck, “Can I cum? Please, need to cum, let me cum”
“Hush, love. Let me treat you” the man whispered as he opened the door inside the cabin. He locked the door right behind him and settled Draco down on the sofa before moving around.
“Alright but first, alcohol” Sirius winked and pulled two small bottles of firewhiskey in his pocket. He took his wand out and returned the bottles into its regular size and handed one to him. They both sat down at the ground and watched the whole view in front of them.
She jumped in shock hearing Harry’s voice. She looked up and saw him by the doorway, wearing black jeans and a fitted black shirt. He looked casual but so handsome. She felt herself blush at that thought. Harry is handsome?
Draco huffed and take threatening steps closer to him before he shoved the small notebook on his face, “Do you see this?!”
“I know, love. I know you will be” he whispered and Draco felt his whole body sagging at the statement.
The lot laughed. He ignored that. He was battling with war fueled rage. The need to yell nearly winning.
She looked to the side and weighed her thoughts. Public. It’s true. It’s the public. Diagon Alley. Basically a place where people wander, where all kinds of gossips go around and everyone would literally see them.
She gasped. The blush being replaced by the sheer panic it got to her. Child? Public? They are going to St. Mungos?
The perverted game, the art of uncalled seduction, the lips that mocks and charms at the same time. Harry definitely knows his way in and out of this.
He rolled his eyes. He brushed his hands away. How nice of Harry to ask him where the hell did he go when he didn’t even tell him where he went!
He fidgeted with his fingers as he let his gaze stare straight ahead. He wasn’t sure if this long wait was necessary but Pansy had told him it’ll take a little bit of time to organize things and find him the one perfect for his preference.
He was the angel among the strippers, the one whose name falls out of most of their customer’s mouths more often than other strippers. He had a name for his own but several others are preferred over the original.
“I just dealt with the meeting you walked out off yesterday because you were so desperate to fuck another omega in your bed” Draco answered sarcastically, walking closer and dropping the file in his desk.
She said a quick thank you when Harry pulled a seat for her before settling down beside her rather than across from her.
He was just starting to love the friction Harry was giving him when he pulled his hand down to his balls, cupping them and massaging it with light force.
He wants to feel that rough hands choking him, groping him elsewhere, touching him sexually, kissing him slowly, and then fuck him fastly. In his sheets, in the guest room Harry will be staying in and hell, even in the attic, it's fine.
Draco slightly propped himself in the table and stared at him inquisitively. Waiting for his answer and his expression displayed that he will be having endless supply of questions to amuse himself from the boredom of being left alone.
They didn’t waste anymore time as they walked back to the tower. Settling on the couch and sighing happily when they find the room all for them. The others are probably doing their own thing and teaming up with Seamus how to nick alcohol without being spotted by nosy elves.
“Harry?” he tried to call for the man in the living room but when he took a peek, Harry is also not there.
Merely because younger students who didn’t fight with him in the war looked at  him as if he hung the moon, pulled the sunrise, drew the rainbows and blessed some unicorns.
He saw Blaise raising at eyebrow at the television before looking around, “Yey, another pity party” he said lazily.
Arriving by apparition perhaps is not a good idea. She nearly stumbled to the pavement for the dizziness that strike her. Good thing Harry’s reflexes quickly caught her and helped her to stand.
The soft smile is back on, “You’re in control of what you want to happen for this night. Want yourself to dance for me? Go on. You want to just sit and talk? We can talk about fluffy rabbits and anything you want to. You want to drink? The check’s on me”
They didn’t talk and Harry did not bother to open up the topic. He needs to speak to him when he’s sure Draco is in a good mood and in an open mind. Harry’s so ready to hear his side and all he wants is for Draco to be as well.
. And for the past two weeks that he’s been caged in that place, he wasn’t. He was bratty, whiny, a sobbing mess. Pleading the man to let him go.
Draco’s breath hitched before it started to get heavy. He can feel his own arousal starting to pool up inside him. He felt his cock throbbed inside him and the way his asshole clenched, trying to hold onto something that isn’t there. . .
“Sir, you have a meeting with the DMLE in twenty minutes. Why don’t you go ready?” Draco raised an eyebrow at him, sliding his eyes down to look at his body, “Your tie is askew, your coat is missing, your sleeves are folded to your elbows. Make yourself decent”
“Moan, love. Wanna hear your pretty little noises as I touch you” Harry bit on the column of Draco’s throat as he began to pump his hand, “Ohh, can you hear that, princess?” he asked as the squelching noises from Harry’s hand moving along Draco’s cock fills their surrounding.
He can see a little bit of his chest and it is as pearly as his long legs. As hairless as his arms and unintentionally, his cock gave a throb.
But Draco, that young boy, would obviously kneel if Harry asks him to. No, actually scratch that. Draco will kneel if Harry tells him to. He would be so pliant beneath him as Harry gets what he wants.
Remus’ naked torso, all bared for him to drool at. The scars, the symbol of Remus’ strength, those pain he had to endure and came out a lot stronger, all the muscles on the rightful place. The height to tower him, make him feel so little in more ways than he initially likes.
Beneath his closed eyes, he saw what looked like to be images of a smiling woman and a giggling kid. Not unaware of the picture, he knew it seemed to be his future flashing before his eyes. And hoped it would be just so.
Perhaps he isn’t because he’d always been beautiful— it was just a quality Harry refused to acknowledge. Honestly beautiful and not ‘more’ beautiful.
The bartender sported the biggest smile ever and raised his hands, signaling his index finger as if to tell him to lean in so he could introduce himself. And he did.
It's irking to watch Draco playing with them with whatever distasteful dares they could think off. It's horrid to watch Draco who's supposed to be innocent and good and nice doing the same things the others are doing.
Harry groaned. He would’ve love to see Draco finger himself open ready for his cock. It would’ve been such a sight from his angel. His primal need increasing even more and taking the small flask of lube he kept in his jean pocket, he poured some to his fingers and rubbed it on his cock and Draco’s throbbing hole.
She smiled at Harry as he pulled a seat for her. As soon as they settled on their seats, they began to eat with Harry and Ron talking something about the Ministry and Hermione engaging her into a talk about pregnancy.
He got off from his bike and walked over to where he is. Sirius stood in front of him and studied him from head to toe.
Why did Sirius’ parents named him Sirius? His classic name jokes are really sometimes too annoying especially when Harry is trying to be really really really grave here.
He even had the thought of having him into total submission, have him lying in a bed, waiting patiently for the Harry to pounce, take his time to taste him. And by the time, Harry got him to where he wanted him to, Draco would be begging. With that innocent eyes, pouty lips, and tears rolling down his cheeks.
“We missed seventh year so I’m going back and besides, I cannot say no to the new Headmistress” He reasoned out, the respect he holds for the woman who always looked out for him was high up on the pedestal.
That sounded so good. Dracy’s heart fluttered as she looked up and smiled back dreamily. Her cheeks flushed as she leaned her cheek on Harry’s hand, “How was it?” she asked.
He let another hour pass before he decided to retire to the rooms to get a rest. Looming in front of the door for good measure, trying to listen if there’s something that may indicate Draco is still awake.
He see it in the way his angel’s eyes light up whenever they kiss, fuck, or make love. The changes Draco had shown him over their time together. From avoiding him to giving in and opening up to him, he thought somehow the love they feel for each other is enough.
Harry sighed in frustration. He needs a time-turner. He needs to go back and reject Mr. and Mrs. Malfoy. He should’ve just pushed in convincing them that he assign an Auror whose specific work is to guard witches and wizards.
Harry smirked and was about to tease when Flitwick appeared on their side, a stern but amused expression on his face. Draco knew then they really are doomed.
Harry pants before lifting her up for a bit and quickly unbuckling his belt and taking his hard leaking cock. He shoved her panties to the side all the while murmuring praises after praises, of how sexy she looks on her lingerie has her keening around his words.
He pulled away and plastered a controlled smile on his own, rubbing circles on Draco’s waist to ease him, “Tom, what a lovely party” he praised back.
“Daddy” he whimpered as he straddled him and kissed him in the lips. He smirked into the kiss as he felt Harry’s erection in the cleft of his ass. His hands removed Harry’s robes and opened his trousers, slightly surprised when he saw Harry wore nothing underneath.
She felt choking on air for his statement. Truly, he really was but it’s all forgiven but those arms around her, she just cannot seem to get enough. The warmth she can feel from it, the adoration and all the sincerity in Harry’s eyes. She cannot believe how far they have come.
His eyes started to his long blonde hair. Straight, silky, and shiny. Obviously soft to touch to that pale neck to the sharp collarbone visible to the eye because Draco decided to wear this off-shoulder blouse. Harry wanted to take a bite in there, lap it up, mark it with different codes of his arousal, appreciation.
He sighed and continued to read the letter which can be a good five thousand word essay if he’s exaggerating.
“It’s fine Dobby” Harry cut him off with a firm tone. Dobby smiled apologetically and got back to cooking.
Harry cleared his throat, “We’re both from Seattle. Though we just came back from our trip to Hawaii”
No, no. She can’t be! She cannot be! She looked around the area to make sure not even Wily had seen what she’s holding and frantically stashed it inside her pockets. Her trembling hands came up to gripped her hair tight and she screamed.
“Okay. That’s handsome” Pansy mumbled, eyes focused on the stairs and when Draco turned to inspect, his jaw dropped to the ground.
He didn’t bother opening his eyes even when he felt Harry’s lips just above where his fingers are wrapped, his hot breath hovering over his skin. He whimpered when he felt Harry’s beard prickled his skin. Lips beginning to slide up while his fingers began to hike his skirt up.
“Want to punch him!” Dracy pouted and walked out of her room to go to the library when her eyes stopped at Harry’s bedroom door.
“You know how he took the news. It probably threw him off guard. He’s just probably over at the Weasley’s, calming himself down”
He grunted. It’s not even eight in the morning yet and he’s already regretting his life and pretty sure if this goes on for another minute, he will surely have an existential crisis.
“I just did” he stated before walking off his office and looked at his secretary who was busy doing her work, “Julia” he called.
“To who? I’m engaged to who? Alden Pire? Or was it the Spanish chick we saw at Molly’s restaurant? Or was it the French heir I just made an acquaintance?”
It’s been days. And from the reactions he sees when he kisses her in the neck, forehead, and peck her on her lips, maybe it’s time or not. He can try or once again, not.
“Remember your safewords, darling” he reminded her, giving one more kiss on her lips before moving to nose at her jawline, "They're of utmost importance. Don't like it, use them"
The purse in McGonagall’s lips tightened before she inhaled sharply. For a moment Harry thought he offended the Headmistress. He was ready to take the question back when she opened her mouth,
The whole place fell silent and Draco's grin grew but wiped it after Harry glared at him once more, replacing it with an innocent look and a pout.
Ginny sighed and pulled away, resting her elbows on the railing as they kept the watch above, “I didn’t”
“I had reduced my house elves because their work is gonna be yours” Harry instructed just as they arrived at his house. The newly renovated and redesigned house he inherited from Sirius. It was located in the middle of Muggle London and Wizarding World.
Harry was silent all throughout. Letting him work on what he said and chose to stay silent even when Draco was done. Before doubts from on his mind, Harry pushed his head away so they could gaze to one another, “Angel”
“Daddy” he whimpered as Harry began to touch his cock, slowly tracing its head, wiping the precum from the tip, using it as a lube as he slid his palms down, the tip of his fingers teasing the underside of his cock.
Slowly, Sirius made his way to approach. He took Remus’ offered hand and smiled softly. Remus’ thumb grazed at his skin, easily holding his hand over his bigger one before pulling him to his lap.
For a stranger. Fuck, for Harry and just for this selfish night, he will. Maybe after this he can go back to being civil and do what he always do,
In all aspects, Harry is undeniably built like a good kind brick house. Pounds of beefcake and every ounce of gorgeousness buckled into one. Harry is your gorgeous next door. But the word
He wanted to be at peace, live a cadence of serenity, be at ease waking up. He wanted every bit of what tranquility can give him. It isn’t much, right? Considering he just had to defeat the darkest wizard of his generation. Not by himself alone of course.
It started when the famous matriarch of the Malfoy Family, the beautiful Narcissa Black Malfoy died. Her husband, unable to cope with the heartbreak, got addicted to muggle drugs, casinos, and basically, being drowned with lust of horny sluts around the town and neighboring ones as well. He gambled his life’s worth until he can no longer fend for himself and for their daughter.
“Love, don’t mind them” Harry whispered to his husband when he noticed the way he flinched yet still tried to keep his expressions stoic. He tightened his hold of his hand and tried to drag him to the nearest shop in Diagon Alley.
“Mind where you’re going, Potter” the venom in his tone didn’t sound much as his voice came out breathy.
“Y-yes, daddy, aah” Draco cried out, nearly shutting his eyes close as Harry fastened his movements and when Draco’s breathing got heavier, he slows his hand down.
He sighed. Harry didn’t find himself regretting what happened but he just think it was wrong. It is wrong. Maybe not in Draco’s eyes but it is in their family. And that’s what he should make the boy understand. But how could he?
“Baby?” he called, acknowledging the way the pet name easily fall from his lips. He’s just too soft for Draco, extremely too soft. He just melts like a puddle of goo because Draco feels a lot like hot lava.
Before he could control himself, Draco snorted, “My goals are trashed before I could even try to work for them. I’ll be lucky if someone wants to hire me”
He’s been running nonstop. Trying his best to get away but it was obvious he’s just running in circles, not really escaping. Just rounding the maze of this dark forest as his eyes sweep to one tree after one another. He wasn’t sure what to do but he kept his hope that maybe, maybe there’s still a chance for him to go back to where he should be, to where he want to be.
“You’re a boy and I’m an adult and I should be having good and right reason to tell you how this is wrong” he said truthfully, Draco whined and shook his head. He was refusing to listen to Harry’s point.
Does he need to know that the couples on his gang are having fun in their own cheap motel room while he’s basically a mess?
His hand cupped her breast and began to play with it. Massaging the flesh in his palms, intentionally avoiding her nipples.
A tone Dracy never heard from the Alpha even when that day when she entered his bedroom without permission.
Whether this be the Potion, pearl dust, or like Luna’s statement about Hogwarts knowing what to do, “I’m happy with you”
The silence that befell around them felt heavy and downright alarming.Well, It was for Dracy’s side and she doesn’t know how Harry feels about the question because he didn’t respond.
Merlin, bless her with strength. She begins to feel her body give up standing upright at the first touch of her clit.
Whining, she opened her eyes slowly and blink for several times to let her sight adjust at the onslaught of brightness. When she was able to clearly make out what was around her, she met Harry’s eyes peering down at her softly.
“ I wandered along the restricted section. . .” he bit his bottom lip, “I saw a curse I would like to try on you. When are you free?” he asked the seventh year nicely but he knew his eyes were far from nice.
“Did you really think I was that stupid?” Harry started, crossing his arms, “That I don’t know what you really want?”
Breathing heavily, he sagged on Harry and panted tiredly. Harry pulled his hands out before wiping them on Draco’s shirt. He tilted his head up and gave him one languid kiss, his tongue prodding Draco to open and when he did, his tongue found its way in and played with Draco’s lazily.
“It is so serene. I love this place” she murmured, stopping by a sliding wooden door and only to find a bathroom which consists of a sink, a shower, toilet and a circle shaped bathtub.
Harry smiled at her even more, his hand moving and brushed a finger at her bottom lip, “I can’t say for sure”
Harry looked at her from head to toe, taking in how small she looked and how stressed she is even at such a young age. Her clothes are slightly ripped on the sides and the neckline is dropping, providing Harry a small bit of her cleavage. As enticing as it was, it wasn’t what Harry noticed the most.
His brows furrowed as he looked at the bed beside him and there he was with all the savior’s glory, sleeping peacefully as if he wasn't the one to blame the cauldron exploded and hit them.
“Harry” she spoke sounding nervous, “I s-saw a library when I was cleaning and just wanted to r-read” she began to explain frantically.
He breathed heavily, his forehead resting at his shoulder. Draco cradled him close to his as they calmed themselves down.
“I’m staying with who?” he asked to be sure. Ignoring the laughter he can hear from Seamus and Dean.
He nibbled on his lips as he tried to forget the kiss Harry gave him. He wasn’t sure if it was a deliberate action or something he did absentmindedly. And if it was done consciously, Draco thinks it rouses more suspicions than one might think.
It's just been hours but a lot of things have happened already. He just owled Sirius a letter and maybe he still hasn't received the letter yet. He badly needs his godfather's words because fuck.
Not knowing what to answer, nodded smoothly, keeping his stare lovingly. Draco was always unafraid to voice his opinions even if Harry hold the opposing thought.
It’s not that Draco hates him. To be honest, he’s amused. Harry have this charming trait in him that makes Draco hard to say no.
He closed his eyes tight, trying to control the overwhelming emotions he’s feeling. The way he started to feel he’s floating once more. Lighter than he felt last night and in any other night. He bit his bottom lip and tried to grip the sheets for leverage.
“May I?” he asked and Dracy was unable to think clearly but managed to give a nod. She felt as if she was hit with a strong stupefy when Harry carefully wrapped a hand around her ankle and removed the shoes she’s wearing.
Oh. He's so fucked. Harry's so fucked. Just one word with two syllables managed to still him and imagine hundred ways to bend the little one with his will. He could ravish him, draw the loveliest of sounds and let everyone including Zayan know who Draco likes to call daddy. Him.
“Well, they encountered some problems with your minister and the protection that holds their family’s security has been destroyed”
“You do not worry inside here. You’re my omega.” he murmured, letting out a little bit of his Alpha scent to freshen her up, entice her to let go for a bit.
Lucius held his arm out for his wife to hold. Narcissa smiled at him, giving him a kiss in the cheek and squeezing a muscled arm, “It will be fine, Lucy”
Draco smiled. Getting on his knees and crawling to his daddy, making sure to sway his hips as he moved. He fluttered his eyelashes innocently until he stopped, eye level with Harry’s cock, steadily leaking and throbbing.
Dracy hummed when Harry stood up while carrying her in his arms and left the office. She cannot find her voice to ask where are they going now, feeling tired all of a sudden.
Harry is his complete opposite. He never visits the bar and he’s your iced tea in a world full of whiskey.
Draco whimpered, feeling Harry’s fingers inside him, scissoring him wide open as he slowly thrusted them, the obscene noises it creates was adding to the overflowing sensations and the warmth that’s pooling on his belly. His right hand slid up to grasp the back of Harry’s head and hold onto it tight.
“I’m not, ‘Mione. Can we drop the subject now?” he asked seriously. Not really wanted to hear Hermione’s opinion on the matter of how he should treat Dracy. He’s giving her as much as he could. If only she can open up a bit more.
Lucius’ gaze flickered something dangerous, his fingers tapping at the side of his cane, weighing what to say next and Sirius just know how to fill it to prompt a satisfying reaction out of his cousin’s husband.
To say her jaw drop was understatement as she perused the place they are now in. Stepping out carefully from the fireplace, she stood in the middle of what looked like a very homey cottage. The design wasn’t anything extravagant but it was entirely beautiful and inviting.
Harry panted as he granted Draco’s wish. Pulling out and thrusting back in in a rough pace, hand tightened as Draco clenched around him. As moans continuously rained down the whole room, Harry bucked his hips faster, balls hitting the cleft of Draco’s ass as he held him by the hips, raising it up a bit for better access,
Parvati shook her head, “On the house. Take that as a congratulations after being single for so long”
“Harry” she kissed him on his cheeks and brushed her nose at it after, trying to get his scent to hers. It was intoxicating and addicting, “Harry, please”
Her baby bump is nit that visible yet but she felt like she already have the roundest baby bump ever. She’s not complaining because it’s natural but sometimes she cries for feeling so bloated, and fat, and ugly then the next second, she’s eating chocolates, bread on a stick, and tea with coffee.
