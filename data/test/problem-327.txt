of because he was too distracted. He was in such deep shit.
"FUCKKKK HARRRYYY NOOOOHAHAHAAHAHA!" Draco cried out as Harry's fingers and the feathers went up higher, towards his nipples, neck and collarbone.
"Yeah, I'm fine. Please continue," he said rather breathlessly, slouching down in his seat and feeling his face turn red.
. It was pure torture, but still, his pride prevented him from breaking down and peeing behind a coconut tree. Thankfully, Harry didn't say anything else, if not Draco might have punched Harry if he tried to say any more encouraging words. Damn those pregnancy hormones.
"Oh, I'm great," Harry replied. He then launched into a retelling of the latest Auror mission, where a triad of illegal magical animal smugglers had caught on to the Aurors tracking them down and hexed Zacharias Smith bald. This made Draco laugh.
They launched into conversation easily, and Draco didn't notice someone else walking out of the lift while he and Flora were talking animatedly about Quidditch.
Harry grabbed his angel closer and deepened the kiss. Even though Draco was full of sharp angles, his skin - and lips - were surprisingly soft. When the blond opened his mouth slightly, Harry took this opportunity to let his tongue in. Draco tasted like Earl Grey, but Harry couldn't think of anything that tasted sweeter. He could feel his arousal grow as their tongues performed a slow dance, languidly exploring each other's mouths.
"We're not done yet. Put on the apron," Harry commanded, handing Draco his apron.
"Do you need to rest? The portkey doesn't activate for another hour," Harry said. They had a portkey to take them to their hotel for dinner, but both Harry and Draco didn't know where it was. The first portkey had dropped them straight at the beach, where a hotel staff took care of their luggage, telling the couple to enjoy the beach scenery first.
"What do you mean, you didn't know?" Malfoy flew up to Harry's face and shook a fist at him. "What if something goes wrong and I stay like this forver?"
"Mr. Potter, what brings you here?" Flora asked.
, for fuck's sake. Only bloody Aurors would hold meetings on a Sunday afternoon.
He looked to be around Harry's age, and had artfully styled platinum blond hair and a pale complexion, accentuated by high cheekbones. He was a bit pointy, but in a good way which brought out his aristocratic features. To top it off, he spoke in the poshest accent Harry had ever heard. He was the complete opposite of Harry, who had a healthy golden tan from exercising in the sun and messy black hair that could never be styled no matter how he tried. When the man turned around to get some ingredients, Harry's eyes stayed glued to his body and most importantly, his delectable bubble butt. Harry's breath hitched.
" Malfoy screeched in indignation.
Hermione giggled. "Mrs Weasley gave me some recipes, of course. But this receipe is from YouTube."
. He hadn't even made it into the toilet cubicle, when the sensation of his cock pounding into the invisible throat began. It was all Harry could do to clutch at his clothed erection and let out a hissed "Fuck, Draco!" before shooting his load into his pants.
"Shut up Potter," Draco blushed.
"You can have him on your team if you like," he told Harry.
"You did so well, baby. I take it you've learnt your lesson?" Harry laughed.
"You're such a
"Come in, I'll get you something to drink," Draco led Harry into a neatly furnished apartment. Harry's eyes slid easily from Draco's face to the glorious sight of his bubble butt walking in the direction of the open kitchen, and his breathing quickened.
Draco's response was to turn away and cry even harder. Harry was always so good to him. He didn't laugh at him or judge him the first time he wet himself at the club. Even when he was pregnant and throwing a tantrum (and Merlin knows he'd thrown enough tantrums when he
"Is this okay?" Harry asked.
Harry groaned. He looked at Malfoy, who was getting up as well, brushing the dirt off his robes.
"First of all, lady, you have absolutely no fashion sense. That dress is
Harry growled and grabbed Draco's hips, making sure to hit that sensitive bundle of nerves as much as possible. He looked down, enthralled at the sight of his erection disappearing into the tight heat, admiring the sight of his boyfriend's reddened hole clenching around him, as if refusing to let him go.
?" was the first statement out of the blond's mouth.
By then, the lips were sucking on Harry's cock hungrily, taking his erection in as deep as it could. Considering that Harry hadn't gotten off the past few days, it felt like heaven. It felt like he was fucking into a throat... Draco's throat, and Harry moaned out loud again when he imagined it was his sexy husband hiding underneath the table and sucking him off in front of all his colleagues.
When Draco came back with a glass of wine, Pansy the traitor had disappeared to a corner with none other than Terry Boot. Draco rolled his eyes when he saw her giggling at something he said. He sighed and started drinking again. And again. And again.
"I love treacle tart, it's my favourite!" Harry exclaimed. How did his angel guess his favourite dessert? "I don't have any experience baking it though..."
"Mmmmm, tastes good," Draco casually remarked and looked into the camera with half lidded eyes. Then he placed his index finger in his mouth again and sucked hard, releasing the finger with a pop, making sure to look directly into the camera as he did so.
Harry couldn't help it. He moaned, and instantly tried to cover it up by coughing loudly.
Since they lived so near each other, Draco had suggested meeting up next week to discuss and see where they could go from there. He said the video could be uploaded any time once Harry felt comfortable with their take.
"Wanna keep my come inside of you..." Harry smiled and fingered Draco lazily, enjoying the sensation of massaging his come inside Draco's tight heat.
Harry Potter had come into his life unexpectedly. He'd decided to hold a contest to celebrate 100,000 subscribers, and he picked Harry. When he first lay eyes on Harry, he couldn't believe his luck. The man was taller and broader than him, with what seemed like a permanent five-o-clock shadow, and looked like he worked out regularly. He wore a T-shirt that clung to his muscles in all the right places and had such a nice tan, Draco wanted to peel off all his clothes to see how far it went.
He had to admit he was too busy jerking off while watching Draco bake that he couldn't attempt to do any baking himself. When Hermione texted him to ask how his baking was going, he could only manage a weak "thanks Mione, tried out a few recipes but I'm still getting the hang of it" because there was
Another complication is that McGonagall has ceased separation by house during mealtimes in the Great Hall. The good thing is that most people ignore the change, the older students stuck in their ways and already having all their friends in the same house. The younger students, all looking to the older students for guidance follow their lead and stick to their own house. This does not, however, stop Harry from glancing at Malfoy at almost every meal we’ve had so far. It’s almost as if I’m not even there.
Harry scoffs and pulls his hand away “Ginny you are the one being ridiculous. If you actually talked to Draco, you would know he is different, and you would see how much he’s changes. He’s a good friend to me. Until you see that and accept that I’ll be going.”
comes up that I start to feel him slipping away again.
I would’ve been in Azkaban if it weren’t for him.
(See the end of the chapter for
I smile at that, happy to see my brothers doing what they love after the war and not letting their shot knee or lost ear, respectively, stop them.
Sometimes I think about all the things I want to tell you; think about the things I want to do when we graduate. I sometimes forget that this is all in my head. Because no, you wouldn’t want to know. I have only dreamed about taking you out on dates. I have been learning about cars and moving picture “movies” in my muggle studies class, mandated as per the ministry.
"I can play Chaser if you really want; it's up to you," Harry shrugged.
Harry didn't have time to dwell on that for long, once he saw the blond walking towards him with two cups of tea.
Sure, he still wasn't very popular with the wizarding public, what with his Death Eater past, but Draco didn't give a flying fuck. He had his Harry, after all, and he loved it when Harry got all noble and defended his virtue.
On YouTube, Harry could never ascertain what colour Draco's eyes were, but now he knew for sure.
"Told you you'd like him," Ron's voice was entirely too smug. "He's exactly your type."
Draco looked around. They were quite far from their starting point, and the tropical weather was making him all hot and sweaty. When Harry stood up, Draco reached into Harry's bottomless bag and took out a bottle of water. He downed it quickly.
Draco downed his Firewhisky at one go, getting up to find another drink. He was in no mood to explain his situation with Potter. He was also going to need lots of drinks tonight.
, he thought hungrily, eyes taking in the perfectly round globes while his hand began flying up and down his erection.
"Enjoy your food, Potter," Draco said flippantly without looking back, but before he went out he secretly pointed his wand at Harry and murmured a spell he had come across in the Malfoy Manor library years ago. Oh, Harry would live to regret this.
From then on, Harry dedicated all Friday nights to Draco.
"Malfoy, you better learn to keep your mouth shut if you know what's good for you." Harry brought Malfoy up to his dorm room and closed the door. He finally let go of the fairy, who flew around the room, examining his surroundings.
Draco found it quite surprising that it was very easy to talk to the black-haired man, when they were not actively trying to kill each other. Maybe age and maturity had to do with it. He told Harry all about his work and his visits to France, when Harry asked nicely how his parents were doing. He couldn't help but wonder what it would've been like if they had been friends at Hogwarts. He stirred at his hot chocolate absently and squirmed in his seat.
So, Draco roped Pansy into joining him. The rest of his housemates weren't as keen on socialising as she was. Pansy was suspicious, of course.
"You'd better hurry. I have an order to deliver," Draco said, ignoring the protest from his bladder.
"He recently started this channel. It's called Draco's Baking Delights," Hermione informed him helpfully. "At first, it might seem he's doing all these for likes and subscribers, but he does have some good recipes."
. He let out a whimper when Harry grabbed his hand and held it against the counter, his right hand giving Draco another firm slap on the arse.
When Draco came to, Harry handed him a glass of water, which the blond gulped down eagerly. Harry smiled at him indulgently and refilled the glass without asking. Draco tried to speak and nothing came out at first except a croak. He hit Harry on the chest, and managed to say "Next time, just stick with the spanking, Potter!"
‘See you at home.’ He doubted Harry had heard him since he’d already started walking away, but he needed space. He didn’t know why, but that morning when he’d woken up, he’d actually thought he might’ve had some good news.
‘I made peace with your choices a long time ago baby. Your father tried, but we can’t all be perfect.’ She smiled at him gently, and for the first time in a long time Draco craved the old times when she’d kiss his knees when he’d played too hard and fallen over, or she’d spend hours trying to tame the naturally wavy hair he’d inherited from the Blacks just because his father said, “it’s not becoming of a Malfoy”.
‘Hey Pansy,’ he said as they descended the stairs together, ‘how would you and Blaise like to put your heads together on an interior design project once I’ve got this place up and running?’ Pansy turned a huge grin on him.
‘I’m sorry, what?’ He said slowly. The colour drained from Hermione’s face.
“It looks rather complicated,” he mused as he read over Granger’s shoulder.
‘You seem a lot happier.’ Draco remarked. Teddy nodded after he let go of Harry.
‘No,’ Harry said earnestly, ‘it’s not stupid. We can go out. I just thought with everything going on you might not want to, you know, make a scene anywhere…’ He didn’t want to be angry. He knew what Harry meant. No one knew about their reunion. They’d been so careful to keep it that way, especially for Teddy’s first year at school. He didn’t need to hear about it the paper instead of from them. Still, it was difficult to ignore the niggle of doubt in his mind that told him Harry was ashamed.
“Ok, we might not have a lot of time, so we’d best get on with it.” Granger took off down the steps towards the arch and Draco couldn’t tell if she was totally unconcerned with the strange feeling in the room, or if she was feigning confidence for her own sake. He ran after her and when he reached the Veil, the whispering hummed in his ears like a swarm of bees, making his head soupy. It was difficult to think – or maybe his Pepperup was wearing off.
He and Harry stayed for lunch, although it was a slightly awkward affair since Draco was still reeling from Hermione’s research and Harry seemed put out by Draco’s refusal to let him help. He was quiet throughout the meal, and even when Harry tried to coax him out of his shell with a gentle hand on his knee, he pretended not to notice.
‘WE ARE NOT FAMILY! WE GOT DIVORCED.’ Draco looked down at the ring Harry had given him not 24 hours ago. Yes, they did get divorced, but as far as he was concerned that didn’t matter anymore. They loved each other…didn’t they?
Belatedly, Draco came to his senses and quickly pressed the close button, but Potter was too fast.
Harry produced a bottle of lube seemingly out of nowhere and coated his fingers liberally with it. He leaned down to kiss Draco as one finger circled his rim, and Draco moaned loudly at the sensation. It had been too long since he'd had sex.
"Baby keeps kicking... and I need to pee..." Draco leaned against Harry's supportive embrace.
. Harry's heart beat faster at that. Out of 100,000 subscribers, how many actually lived in London? Did he really stand a chance? Taking a deep breath, he typed in his comment.
Harry didn't give Draco a chance to say more before he spread his arse cheeks open and drove in again. "Fuck!" Draco cried out when Harry hit his prostate on the first thrust, hands grappling unsteadily at the counter, his pliant body being pushed forward at each thrust.
Draco was back at the Ministry again. He heaved a sigh of relief when the lift safely brought him to Level 9 without any accidents. He had been so mortified over the incident with Potter that he had to gather up all his courage to make the trip down to the Ministry, and he was seriously considering hiring an assistant to help with some of the brewing and deliveries.
?" He sobbed again and made to move away from Potter, but the man grabbed at Draco's arm.
"Then do it," Draco smirked, holding his legs up and giving the brunet a view of his pink hole, delighting in the sharp intake of breath that came from his boyfriend.
Harry remembered meeting the security guard - a big, hulking man - at the lobby, and knew what Draco meant. After showing Draco's address to the man, Goyle made him answer a lot of questions before he finally gave a grunt and told Harry to go ahead.
It turned out that Draco lived about half an hour's drive away from Harry, so it was very convenient. He googled the place and was pleasantly surprised to see a sleek, modern apartment in an upscale neighbourhood.
But Harry did not stop. "Accio feathers," he heard Harry summoning more feathers, goodness knows how many of them, and the tickling commenced on his other foot.
"Give me a break, Malfoy. Do I look like I can see through walls? How am I supposed to know you were around the corner?" Harry rolled his eyes.
Draco looked up and couldn't help admiring the fit, tanned body belonging to his boyfriend. He wondered what it would feel like to have that body pressed against him, on top of him,
"You'll pay for this, Malfoy," Harry smirked down at Malfoy who was panting and wriggling hard, trying to free himself from Harry's grip.
"Don't worry, angel. Just wanna ogle your arse from behind," Harry smirked and helped him down from the counter. Draco's legs were too wobbly and he almost fell, but Harry caught him. "Hands on the counter."
"I didn't think you'd care to know about Malfoy's whereabouts, Harry. Are you suspecting he's up to something again?"
"Nothing, come on, let's go," Harry led Draco out by the elbow. Draco's skin tingled at Harry's touch, and he was already thinking about the next time he could meet Harry.
Draco flew after the elusive golden ball as quickly as he could. The Snitch was hovering near a thicket of trees towards the other side of the field. Ignoring Potter and his protesting bladder, Draco aimed his Firebolt down and zoomed towards the trees. He heard a rush of wind, but he wasn't sure if it was Harry or his own imagination. All this time, Draco's bladder was screaming for release, and he was sure he had leaked a bit in his underwear, but he ignored it.
"So needy," Harry growled into Draco's ear. He pushed Draco's apron aside and began licking at one nipple, dragging his nails up and down Draco's inner thighs. "You're so good for me, Draco, so desperate and hungry for my cock...I'll fuck you so hard you won't remember your name by the time I'm done with you."
Draco usually released one video per week, and Friday night was the time for Harry to catch Draco's newest video, as well as binge watch the rest of his videos and wank to images of the blond angel.
Draco felt he had been pissing himself for such a long time, and when it finally trickled to a stop, he let out a contented sigh. He took out his wand to clean himself, checking his reflection in the mirror. And he was just in time, for he heard the sound of the toilet bowl flushing and the door opening. Draco quickly kept his wand.
. And secondly, I'm not a pet! Especially not Pot-mmmph" Malfoy's whiny voice was cut off when Harry grabbed him and clamped a finger over his mouth.
"Are you okay, Harry?" Ron asked.
The Snitch changed course at the last minute, flying straight up towards the sky. Luckily, Draco was alert and he wasted no time in flying upwards, his hand reaching out to catch the Snitch. When Draco felt the flutter of wings against his hand, he pumped his fist in the air triumphantly.
The door opened and Harry was greeted by the angel he'd been dreaming about.
Harry felt as if the day had gone by in a flash. When he went to bed that night, his dreams were filled with nothing but images of platinum blond hair and soft, pale skin.
A haggard looking man who resembled Hagrid stepped out of the cubicle, stuffing his phone into his back pocket. Draco sneered at him.
Whatever frustration Harry felt melted in that instant. He had been swamped with work the past few days. Not only did he not pay his husband enough attention, but he had been too busy for his son as well.
"Argh!!! Damn you! You're
"What was that?"
"He's...my new pet," Harry looked at Malfoy and smirked.
"Harry Potter. Nice meeting you, Draco," Harry finally replied. He stood staring at the blond for a while, before coming to his senses and passing Draco the bottle of wine he brought along as a gift.
"You didn't wake me up," Draco pouted, then added "Why am I tied to the bed?"
"Just like what I said. You're a perv-" Draco's indignant voice was cut off when Harry kissed him again and grabbed him by the waist, hauling him up onto the kitchen counter.
!" Draco wrinkled his nose. "You're such a heathen, Potter."
Draco and Harry go for lunch. Draco hopes it's a date.
to occupy his mind with, his phone vibrated.
"Oh, I'm so sorry Harry," Draco looked genuinely upset. His hand stilled midair, and Harry took it in his hand, rubbing soothing circles all around. He felt bad for upsetting his angel.
"Hermione, have you seen Malfoy around recently?" Harry hoped he was subtle enough.
"Harry...!" Draco gasped, placing his hands on Harry's shoulders to support himself.
As if reading his thoughts, Harry got up, walked towards Draco and wrapped his arms around Draco's waist. "I'm really sorry, Draco. Dark wizards don't necessarily rest on weekends. We have to finalise our plans so that next week can go as smoothly as possible." Harry pressed a kiss to the top of his husband's head.
, Harry thought with a grin, determined to see Malfoy again.
"Draco caught the Snitch!" Harry announced happily when they landed, his arm around Draco's waist as if nothing out of the ordinary happened.
Harry found Draco's place soon enough and moments later, he was standing outside the door. He hastily wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans, gathered up his courage and rang the doorbell.
"Hi, how may I help you?" It was the same witch from before.
"Nice day, isn't it," he remarked casually.
"Suit yourself. Posh git." The man made sure to bump into him as he was walking out.
"What about James?" Draco asked.
Draco just glowered up at him. Harry rewarded him with a long, slow kiss, then carried his husband to the bath. He had already filled the bath with water and set it under a warming charm, then poured Draco's favourite bath foam inside.
"No, love, you can pick as many shells as you want today. When we come back tomorrow, they might not be there anymore," Draco said.
called "The Scandal of the Century", although they had arranged a quick private wedding before the news got out to the public. Now six months along, Draco was enjoying his much needed vacation along with his beloved husband as they walked and admired the sunset.
"Dreaming about something, baby?" a deep voice sounded behind him. Draco jerked up in surprise and turned around. Turns out he was too busy thinking about Harry not to notice the real deal had crept up behind him.
Draco nodded, leaning down to kiss Harry again and absentmindedly trailing his hands along Harry's biceps. Harry smiled against the kiss, pulling Draco closer to him. At that slight shift, he could feel both their clothed erections pressed against each other.
Harry collapsed on top of Draco after that, but Draco did not move at all. Harry quickly undid the blindfold to see that his husband had passed out cold. Harry smiled to himself, taking a moment to brush away the hair covering Draco's forehead. He kissed Draco's swollen lips and cast a cleaning charm to clean the blond up.
"Harry?" he called again.
"F..fuck you, Potter" Draco retorted, one hand clutching at Harry's shoulder, the other reaching up to pull harshly at Harry's inky black hair.
"Oh!" the blond squeaked when he saw how near Harry was, then gave an embarrassing laugh. "You okay with tea?"
attractive, so it counted for something that differentiated him among most YouTube channels about baking.
"What the fuck have you done, Potter!" A squeak from above drew Harry's attention.
he wondered. Because Draco Malfoy was right in front of him, sunlight catching on his hair like a halo, mercurial grey eyes shining with mirth, as if he knew what Harry was thinking.
In response, Harry turned Draco's face gently and gazed into his grey eyes, shining with tears. "You're none of these things," he said firmly, pressing a kiss to Draco's lips. "You're so beautiful and strong, and now you're carrying my child, Draco. You're all I ever wanted and I love you so much."
The lift began moving down to Level 9. Draco lowered his tray to the ground and leaned against the side, stifling a yawn. He'd been up early to check on the potions, and he hadn't had much of a break lately. He only ate a few bites of his sandwich in the morning, but drank at least three glasses of pumpkin juice to curb his hunger. Come to think of it, he didn't even have time to go to the loo. He should really go find a restroom after delivering this order, and perhaps reward himself by having a nice lunch at Goyle's cafe later.
I thought he was camera shy?" Ron asked incredulously.
"My apologies, sir. We're doing our best," the witch assured him.
He couldn't see much due to the lighting, but he was pretty sure there would be a dark stain on his jeans right now.
As usual, Harry and Draco were too tired at night to do much. Draco kissed Harry, and told him to get an early rest so that he'd have more energy the next day. Harry almost forgot about what Draco made him go through.
Draco laughed. "That was all in good fun, Harry," he teased.
"Sorry, love. You know I have that meeting later. I really need to prepare for it," Harry sighed and rubbed his hair in frustration.
"Don't think I don't know what you're doing, Draco," Harry said, trailing his hands all over the round globes, soothing the reddened flesh. To his amazement, there was a bruise starting to form at the area where he slapped Draco. "Prancing about like that in your videos, bending down and giving everyone a view of your arse? You're just a naughty boy asking for trouble."
Harry watched as Draco squirmed uncomfortably on his broom. Strange, that was the latest Firebolt model, touted for its speed and comfort. Draco had laid claims on it the moment he spotted it in Seamus' broom shed, much to the Irishman's chagrin. So it made no sense at all. Unless...
Harry laughed. It was just like Draco to be offended over such things.
"Guess I'm too late," a familiar voice sounded behind Draco. Draco turned around and almost lost his balance when he came face to face with Harry.
"HHHHAAAHAHAHARRRY!!!!!" Draco was deep in tickle hell, this was by far the most torturous punishment given to him by Harry. He was on the verge of passing out, coming and wetting himself, and he didn't know if he would die in the middle of it. He couldn't even escape, trying to cover one of his armpits resulted in exposing the other one even more. Draco shrieked with laughter and struggled futilely while his husband and Merlin knows how many feathers tickled him mercilessly.
"If you weren't going so fast, maybe you would've seen me!" Malfoy retorted, rubbing his arse. "It hurts, you big oaf!"
It seemed that Harry's touch made their baby very happy. Draco could feel him starting to move around and kick more enthusiastically this time. He whimpered and bent at the knees.
an angel.
"Hi Harry," Draco stood at the door, giving Harry a wide smile. He held his hand out. "Draco Malfoy."
sensitive.
"Feeling good, love?" Harry mocked as his fingers trailed lightly along Draco's neck and sensitive nipples. His husband looked so good like that, pale skin flushed and glistening with sweat. The blindfold was wet with Draco's tears, Harry couldn't help it but adjusted the bonds on his feet so that Draco's feet were pulled up towards the top of the bed posts instead. The sight of Draco's winking hole undid Harry. With a wandless lubrication spell, Harry slid a vibrating dildo inside his lover.
The next weekend couldn't arrive fast enough. Saturday morning found Harry looking into his bathroom mirror and trying to flatten his hair, to no avail. He checked his watch and sighed, giving up on the messy black curls. He then spent a longer time than usual deciding what to wear, finally settling on one of the T-shirts Hermione got for him. It was a deep green, and people said it brought out the colour of his eyes. He matched that with a pair of ripped black jeans usually reserved for clubbing nights. Satisfied, Harry grabbed his car keys and left the house.
, you speccy git! Stop laughing!"
"Fuck," Harry muttered. "Get a hold of yourself, Harry. Relax. It's just another bloke," he tried to convince himself.
Fed up, Draco decided to leave the party after Merlin knows how many drinks. He hated being ignored, especially by his best friend and his crush. As he was about to sneak off to the Floo, he heard Seamus' booming voice announcing "Quidditch, anyone?" This was followed by unanimous agreement from the group and everyone started forming their teams. Pansy sidled up to Draco then, her lipstick slightly smudged. Terry Boot followed her.
"See you, Malfoy," Potter called after him.
Finally, the bedroom door opened and Harry's messy head stuck in. "You called, love?" Harry asked, eyes dancing with mirth as he took in his husband tied up to the bed.
look like after a round of sex and felt his erection jump with excitement. He quickly tried to will it down for now, hands coming down to rest on Draco's waist.
Draco frowned. "No, that was a week ago, what, is this just an excuse to tie me up like that?"
Draco ground his teeth and checked his watch. The lift
Harry spent the rest of the evening texting Draco, after they both agreed that it would be better to communicate through text message. Harry pumped his fist into the air and shouted "YES!" once he got hold of Draco's number. He knew he was behaving like a lovesick teenager, but then again, nobody was around to see him.
Unconsciously, Harry spat onto his own fingers and trailed a hand down to his straining erection. He kicked off his boxers, not caring where they landed, and wrapped a hand around his cock, giving it a few quick strokes and squeezing around the head. He closed his eyes and imagined it was Draco sucking him off, pink lips wrapped around his cock. Draco would want to start slow, but Harry would have none of it. He would fuck into that pretty mouth, grabbing onto soft blond hair and choking Draco on his cock. He would ruin Draco for anyone else.
"Yes!" he cheered, unaware of his predicament.
Hope you enjoyed this very smutty chapter! This story was originally meant to be a one-shot but I had so many ideas for it. Thanks for all your kudos and comments. You guys gave me motivation to continue writing.
Concentrating hard, Harry spoke the incantation and watched in delight as Malfoy grew smaller and smaller - and finally all that was left was a pile of clothes on the ground.
I find the display in the maze that my brothers call a store. As I walk up to it a nervous feeling grips me, suddenly tying my stomach in knots.

again.
? Him? Of all people?” I ask him with a firm but kind voice, taking his hand in mine on the table. Yet he pulls his hand away from me almost immediately.
I’m so confused. Every time it wears off, he starts acting cold to me again, and it is starting to wear off faster as well. Not only does his attitude toward me change but he also starts talking about
That’s what made this summer so different than others. Of course, he knew where to find me. I was sentenced to house arrest with limited magic use and mandated return to Hogwarts on September 1
Harry’s expression changes from its easy goofy grin into one of confusion. This was probably the love potion fighting with the spell
Is this really the right thing to do? Putting someone under a love potion without their knowledge or consent is frowned upon at best.
Fred yells after me “We’ll hold you to that!”
There’s no way he would do that. We’ve been together, we’ve been through a war together. I’ll bring him back to us, whatever it takes.
“Before we talk let’s eat!” I give him the piece of treacle tart that has it in it. He looks at it and while he appears unsure if it is a good idea, he eats it.
I have set up a nice little picnic, and brought his favorite treat, treacle tart, that’s what I put it in. When he apparates here I smile wide even though he looks at with caution, at best. I know I can save him from whatever
“Look Gin, I’ve been meaning to talk to you about some-” He starts to talk but I cut him off.
With all of this knowledge how could I not know who he was?

"I-" tried Draco.
Why did the day need to go on till night, he couldn’t comprehend. Again, Draco found his way to the dorm room. Again the same excited whispers.
"… Good for you!"
The sorting went on exactly the same way. Draco was still disappointed to see Potter go to red. But there was nothing he could have done about this, after all. A shame, really.
"Anyway, if you see a toad, come to us." Granger told them before leaving with Longbottom.
"Only for today, sadly." he confessed.
Harry nodded "Ok."
At the train station, Draco looked around. Never before had he noticed Potter or any of the Weasleys in the mess of people. And the Weasleys really stood out with that hair. Maybe they arrived late. That wouldn’t surprise him.
Draco lift up his face so fast it hurt. Potter readjusted his glasses on his nose.
"I can’t believe you… or I can, actually! Of COURSE a Weasley would say something this stupid!"
"Oh, he didn’t know he was famous until recently." Ron chimed in.
"Hmm, yes. Not on the first day of school, though. At first I thought it was fun it went on today! Hoped to sort kids different places. Alas, I was forgetting how stubborn eleven years old kids are."
"I’m flattered."
Draco had meant it as a favor. Really! He was trying to be nice here! Sure, he didn’t like the red head, but… since he was Potter’s friend, he had to make an effort.
"Yeah… it’s grand!" added Greg.
Draco could feel his cheeks get warm. And with a skintone pale like his, it was always very obvious. He wasn’t used to so much honesty with people he wasn’t that close to yet.
So this didn’t matter. At least not for the same reason.
‘This one’ was Weasley, easy enough to guess, but Pansy still felt the need to point him out with her thumb.
This time at least he wasn’t as upset. Annoyed, but not upset. He fell asleep without too much trouble.
"… Me too." Draco murmured. It felt bad to not honestly feel the same way as his mother. But he hadn’t been given time to miss them yet! It wasn’t his fault!
"No." he said.
And Potter followed Weasley in red. Again.
"Potter," he greeted, then after a second to show the level of importance "Weasley."
Vince who was the closest to him was curious about something else "What about a toad?"
Really? He’ll have to win Weasley before going anywhere with Potter? How tiring… Draco slid his hands under his thighs. This gesture helped him feel more comfortable. And he really needed that right now.
His parents looked at each other.
"Are you serious?!" Draco yelled although he hadn’t meant to. He just wouldn’t control his volume at the moment. "I’m nice to my friends! You can ask them! They think the gap to how I act with them compared to others is super funny!"
Vince and Greg slided on the seat to offer him a space. Draco happily fell there. Then, he decided he deserved to be as comfortable as possible. His back leaning on Vince’s arm, and his legs covering Greg’s laps. They didn’t say anything, but he noticed Greg smiling, using Draco’s legs as armrests. It was nice. Yes, he had really needed that.
And that was all Harry Potter’s fault.
So now, on top of everything, Draco felt guilty.
"Show off." Weasley huffed.
"So you never flew before?" he tried, turned to face Potter.
"You’re worried?" asked Vince.
But it paid off, because Harry patted his back just then. Probably for comfort. The way he went about it was a bit weird, though, like he wasn’t sure how it was done. Odd, but Draco didn’t mind.
He heard them wonder if it was the stress of the day ahead that was bothering him, and as much as he disliked worrying his parents, Draco was glad they talked about something new at least. How boring his day was gonna be…
She laughed "Yeah, right."
He was in his father’s arms then. It didn’t last as long. But when he straightened, it was to look at his son in the eyes.
"So..." started Vince.
"What?!"
The hat sighed "Kids I swear… never let me have some fun."
"Ew, why?" asked Blaise with a smile on his face. Clearly not believing him either.
"I’m tired too. But yes, still green. Also, why didn’t you speak up before if you knew?"
"And you’re annoying. We all have our faults."
"Draco," his mother sounded more grounded, like she wouldn’t permit him to ignore her "it’s true we expect you to be sorted in green. But please don’t worry yourself over it. Any house is fine. Right, dear?"
"Hello there!" he greeted Potter only, ignoring the Weasley.
Potter hummed while playing with his hands. First difficulty was to make himself so interesting Potter would forget to be awkward. Even just for five minutes!
With that she pushed Longbottom out of the way as he had came closer in hope of figuring out what was going on, and closed the door behind her.
"Yes!" said Longbottom with a big smile on his face. As he moved from behind the girl, Draco noticed the animal in his hands "That’s Trevor." he added, voice soft.
Draco went back inside, patting his hair down, but stayed by the door. He didn’t feel like going back to his friends. They’re the best, he loves them, but… how boring!
Draco laughed "Be serious."
"For real?!" Pansy screamed, needing Blaise to hold unto her so she wouldn’t fall on the ground with her strong laughing fit.
"Uh… hi." Potter replied, glancing between the two of them.
"And who’s Granger?" Asked Blaise with Pansy still in his arms.
"Oh, really now? That desperate to get closer to Potter… hmmm!"
"Oof." said Greg.
No matter the question, he answered with as little words as possible, rarely ever looking in Draco’s direction. What subject was he most looking forward to? He didn’t know. Had he tried some spells before? No. What about accidental magic? Surely, he would have some interesting tales! But he only shook his head. Draco was close to loosing it.
"… What?" he thought.
When he looked around him again, the other boys had indeed been talking. Happy to ignore Draco’s presence.
3… 2… 1…
And with that, he left them to join his friends again. Somehow, he actually was glad they had found the toad. Trevor. Longbottom happiness wasn’t what interested him here. But after a couple of days of them searching, Draco’s could finally put this thrilling mystery behind him.
"He was in the conductor’s cabin, can you believe it?!" Granger almost yelled, so excited she was.
A door was slammed shut.
"Oh, was that the reason?" asked Ron.
"What the-" Weasley started.
To open another door and pose dramatically in the middle of its frame.
"Narcissa!"
After he had calmed down, which took a while, Draco found his way to his friends, like a boat search for a lighthouse.
"Then do something about it!" the hat chuckled.
Both his parents looked at him strangely, and he took advantage of their confused stiffness to leave his mother’s arms to hug his father just as hard.
Vince shared some of his sweets with him when Draco sat down.
"Whaaaat?" said Pansy.
"We’re not here for you, don’t worry." said Draco before turning to Potter "Remember me? We met before."
"She asked you about a toad, right?" was the closest thing to an ‘hello’ he cared to give. He had decided he wouldn’t make an effort this time. There was no point, after all.
"Oh, it’s just due to the rivalry of the red and green houses." explained Draco "But it doesn’t matter! If people say anything, just ignore them!"
Weren’t they the same age? Why did she care so much to act like a mother figure to everyone? Weirdo!
When Draco had realized who the boy was, and how lucky that they had met once before, he of course proposed to be friends. You couldn’t go wrong befriending the-boy-who-lived! He was for sure going to get an approving smile from his father for his practical thinking!
"What are you doing here?" Weasley finally deigned adress him.
He knew. He knew already, so it was useless to be disappointed by it. Stupid feelings!
"Yes, really."
"Hey!" was the last of Draco’s thought the hat heard.
"Get ready, it’s your big day! I’ll wait for you downstair, don’t take too long." his mother said as he sat on his bed.
"Are you alright, son?" asked his father.
And his friends did. He could hear Pansy excited laugh, and Blaise trying to shush her with a smile in his voice that betrayed how close he was to start laughing too. Vince and Greg were silent, walking as close to Draco without getting in his way. Soon they arrived at destination, and Draco opened the door with confidence.
Draco looked behind the hat’s rim at the students waiting for their turn to be sorted. He caught Harry’s green eyes staring at him. Hands slid under his thighs. It wasn’t as comfortable on the stool. He searched for his childhood friends then. They were waiting for him. And while he could make it work, while being in another house… it would be different than what they hoped for.
No, maybe Draco was just… upset of being rejected because it had simply never happened before.
Draco simply nodded. However that happened wasn’t important right now. Since friendship was secured, he didn’t need to rush anymore. They could grow closer naturally. He wasn’t sure how much time they could spend together, as they wouldn’t go to the same house, but. They’ll make time. If Harry wanted. Him and Ron.
When they arrived to the conductor’s cabin, Longbottom jumped to his toad, holding it to his face, ew! Draco would never understand the appeal of these creatures, but at least the boy was happy now, and he was a lot more talkative when that was the case. Not as much as Granger, of course. Longbottom stopped before getting too annoying, and for that, Draco decided he was a decent fellow.
"What? Come on!"
Who sounded annoyed by his presence, judging by the loud and uncivilised "Ugh!"
He sighed "Anything but red."
"Bah, it’s fine. Have a good time in…" started the hat before yelling for the room "GREEN!"
"Because you can’t." his father thought to add then. Instead of his shoulder, an hand was posed on his cheek. It was warm. "I’m always proud of you."
"Looking for Trevor, right?"
"Yeah..." Potter smiled to him.
And so he tried. Since houses weren’t a safe subject, they moved to Quidditch. But Weasley had terrible tastes for teams so the two of them started bickering about it, leaving Potter confused as he had never watched a match before. The mood was getting worse.
Closing the door, he jumped, for Granger and Longbottom had apparently finished their round and were walking all the way back just then, almost crashing into him. Seriously, what was up with their timing?
Weasley’s initial confusion made place to anger "Seriously, what is this? Can you leave?!"
He could tell they all had a multitude of questions and would probably talk over each other, but it was at this moment that Granger opened the door. The timing this girl had!
"Oh! Yes."
Draco thought for a moment. Would it be smart to reveal everything? He already gave a lot away… and Potter was finally interested in him… might as well!
The hat announced his house. Blue.
Granger looked at him like a mother inspecting her child’s attire. "You have a stain on your nose."
When he came down to the breakfast table, both of his parents where waiting for him to start.
"What’s going on?"
When he stopped bombarding Potter with all of that, Weasley stole his moment.
"Often!" his mother added.
"I know you won’t disappoint me."
He sighed, then looked straight at Weasley.
"Me." Draco sighed again. "I already know what’s gonna happen today." he said, letting his head fall on Vince’s shoulder. That’s why he liked the two taller boys by his sides. They made good head rest.
"Oh."
"Seems like it!" Draco said as he sat down next to Potter.
A while later, Draco decided to stretch his legs. Further down the passageway he saw Granger and Longbottom opening a compartment door. Did they really bother asking everyone? And why was Granger involved in that? It wasn’t even her toad. Eh, whatever.
"Guess who…" he started by taking a step in the compartment, and giving his audience a twirl "just befriended Harry Potter."
Then Granger opened the compartment door. Ah yes, he had almost forgotten about her.
"Yes," Potter answered when it looked like his friend wouldn’t "I guess she’s asking everyone?"
The boy blinked rapidly behind his glasses "Why?"
His mother distracted him with a hug, and he squeezed her as hard as he could.
"Oh, you’re on!" yelled Blaise, grabbing his own and attacking the last boy in the room.
Potter was still looking at him. Lips slightly parted. Glasses askew on his nose. Expectant.
"Oh..." Potter breathed out, looking at his friend.
"Um..." started Potter "you can call me Harry? I guess."
Of course, he already knew the answer to that. But what he was curious about was Potter’s opinions so far. And if they could be changed.
"As usual." came Draco’s jab.
The hat sighed in his mind "I’m getting tired of it."
"I’ll miss you." she said.
Weasley already looked pissed at him. At least the stain on his nose was gone.
"Why would you say something like that?!" she scolded him.
How long was this dream gonna last? And why was it starting over again? Could his brain really not supply something better? Ugh!
Draco bit his lip.
"Has this ever happened before?" Draco asked afer a moment.
With the way he said that, Draco didn’t feel so confident about it. "… Right."
"Sorry I guess!" chuckled Draco.
"Madam Malkin’s shop. Hagrid. Ice cream."
Weasley didn’t take it that way, though.
His friends conversation went back to normal soon and Draco left their voices wash over him with content. Strenght left him, like he had just finished running a race. Now he just wanted to nap. The warmth coming from his friends bodies probably was part of it.
Draco stared at his feet. The pressure their stares put on him was impressive! If they didn’t stop soon he’ll definitively start sweating!
"Déjà vu." Draco said simply.
"Uh, no." the Weasley said, turned her way.
"Uh?!" Weasley finally found his voice again.
"I’m fine. Just want this day to be over."
Night darkened the sky as kids left the train.
"No." the boy had finally stopped readjusting his bangs.
Draco joined Vince and Greg at the green table. Sitting between them, as usual. Pansy and Blaise still had to be sorted.
"Guessing you don’t like stars then, Weasley?" asked Draco, but without giving him time to answer, turned to Potter "You?"
His mother laughed softly. "How sweet!"
He could… tell them again. But was there a point to it? They’d react the same way, and it’ll be boring, and probably nothing will be added. So, yes, it felt weird not to share, specially after it had been so fun yesterday, but Draco really didn’t feel like repeating too much. Instead he let himself slouch over Vince, his favorite pillow. Far more comfortable than Greg.
Greg went on first "Try to be nice."
Pansy seemed able to breath again, so she said "Are you for real… telling us you can see the future?"
"Fair. Tomorrow stop playing. You make me want to retire."
Draco smiled "And I wasn’t really asking you." before turning to Potter "So, tell me! What house do you think you’ll be sorted into?"
Weasley crossed his arms, annoyed. For a bit he glared at Draco, then looked away. Potter looked even more awkward than usual.
‘Draco.’ Kingsley greeted him with a sheepish smile. Draco took a deep breath, but it did nothing to calm him. His stomach was churning, and he was almost certain he was going to throw up his morning potion.
‘If you weren’t lying to me and hiding things from me, maybe I wouldn’t have to resort to desperate measures.’ Harry growled. Anxiety crept up Draco’s spine and sat heavily on his shoulders.
“Alright. Well, it’s best to start with curses obviously.” With a flick of his wand, Malfoy sends a stack of books zooming across the room to a large wooden table with a green leather inlay. Harry wants to point out that he doesn’t need to be able to use a cataloguing system to do that, but he keeps his mouth shut. Something in the back of his mind tells him that Malfoy might be keener on helping him than he’s letting on.
‘Hmmm. How about hot then?’ Draco rolled his eyes again but couldn’t suppress his smile.
Ron shook his head. ‘She didn’t tell me what it was, she just said you asked for her help for a new thing you’re working on.’ Draco was momentarily distracted by Harry who was standing next to Hermione who had just re-emerged. He was bouncing baby Hugo in his arms and waving one of his fists at Draco across the tent. He remembered when Teddy was that small and it seemed like it was both yesterday and a whole lifetime ago.
“But I don’t speak Latin.”
‘If you would kindly let go of me, maybe I’ll tell you.’ Draco told him calmly. It seemed Harry hadn’t actually realised he was still pinning Draco to the wall as he shook his head and released his collar. ‘Thanks.’
‘What is it about plants you love so much, Ted?’ He asked him out of pure curiosity.
She nodded and he let her go.
‘Calm down, I’m not done with you yet. But I’ve just remembered there’s something I want to show you before I go to my meeting.’ He took off out of the room and Draco thought about reminding him that he wasn’t properly dressed yet. But really, it wasn’t as though he was going to complain at seeing him wander around half naked, was it?
All in all, it was a very pleasant meal. Draco was glad turkey was saved solely for Christmas because he felt like he’d eaten a whole one on his own and that would certainly be enough to tide him over until next year, maybe even the year after. The constant talking and generally high volume around the table was a lot for him to deal with and even with four glasses of wine he shouldn’t really have drank, he was struggling to keep his calm and his energy. Harry, sensing Draco was flagging, excused them both before Molly could start dishing out dessert.
‘Where do I fit into this?’ Draco asked but he wasn’t sure if we wanted an answer.
He said nothing to Harry as he went through to the drawing room to take floo. Draco felt a little pretentious having a drawing room, but he hated the idea of the floo being in the living room and making a mess everywhere. When traveling together, Harry had started going ahead of Draco to catch him if he came out dizzy at the other end. It was sweet, since neither of them had actually said anything about it – it had just developed naturally. Harry winked at him as he shouted
“Would you like tea?” She asked him, almost before he’d finished his question, her voice sounding jittery. It was unbelievable to Harry that the serene woman he’d seen just minutes before was now flighty and itching to move. It was like someone had flicked a personality switch.
When they arrived, they found Ella in the playroom, sitting at a table crying with another of the orphans who was a couple of years older than her, standing awkwardly beside her.
Harry was still awake when he stirred again, as he’d half expected. They were still wrapped around each other as they had been when Draco fell asleep which was odd since he usually woke up as far away from Harry as possible. Harry was running his fingers gently over his spine and he really didn’t want to move. He lifted his head slightly so that it rested in the crook of Harry’s neck. He briefly wondered, if it all really were to go to pot, if it would be weird if he started wearing the same scent.
‘Yeah well, kissing will always be gross and there’s nothing you can say to convince me otherwise.’
‘You’ve been funny with me for days. I said I was sorry about the bathroom. What can I do to fix it?’ Harry’s brow furrowed.
“Um, no, I suppose not,” he muttered dazedly. He was too distracted by Draco’s tongue and long fingers to put up much resistance.
‘Like ripping off a plaster.’
‘Ok.’ He breathed.
An hour. An hour Draco had to sit in that damn coffee shop waiting for Harry and Leggy-Blonde to be done with their little date. Draco was fuming.
“Excellent! I’m sure your invite will arrive soon.” Pansy was bubbling with excitement at being asked to be one of Astoria’s bridesmaids. If he had been feeling his usual self, Draco would have pointed out that the only reason Pansy was asked was because as Daphne Greengrass’ only female friend, she was one of the only acceptable people to ask. Every pureblood family was careful who to associate themselves with now, and although Pansy wasn’t exactly Potter’s best friend after she’d offered him to the Dark Lord, she was one of the few Slytherins from respectable families who weren't directly associated with the Death Eaters. It was a wonder Draco was even considered for an invite, but he supposed if they ruled
“It’s nothing, you just let the clutch up to soon. Remember, you have to keep it pressed to the floor and you can’t lift your foot until you’ve finished changing the gear. And keep your eyes on the road!” Harry was convinced they were going to end up in a hedgerow, and they were already at least ten miles from the nearest town. Maybe he should have let Draco have a go when they were closer to civilisation and help would arrive sooner. He really should have made sure there was a repair kit in the back. Just in case.
‘I see your point, and absolutely that makes sense, but it doesn’t explain why none of the patients have been to the clinic within a week of their symptoms. In fact, the young girl hasn’t been a patient at this clinic at all.’ Draco explained. He got the feeling he was missing something.
One look at the prices and Draco suddenly felt overwhelmed. It was a long time since he’d been anywhere as fancy as this. Once upon a time he’d have waltzed in here like he owned the place, demanding a bottle of the most expensive pinot noir and generally being as obnoxious as possible. He wasn’t like that anymore, and for once he got a glimpse of what it was like to be Harry – to feel like a fish out of water.
‘I don’t know if I can. But I did do what you asked me to, if you’re still interested. The DMLE said that since your charges were over ten years ago, there should be no issue with any of it. All they said was that if you do go ahead, it will have to be reviewed by the Department of Public Relations first.’
‘I’m sorry. I’m so so sorry.’ He whispered into Harry’s neck. Harry, ignoring the mediwitch and just about everyone else on the ward, climbed onto Draco’s hospital bed and pulled him into his arms. Draco heard the curtains around his bed scrape against the railing as they closed around them, and the shutting off of the background noise told him the kind witch had warded them some privacy.
‘Merry Christmas Draco.’
Potter’s birthday. How hadn’t he realised? He grabbed for the cover sheet even though the lightening was gone. It made it hard to read the small newspaper print, however even in the dimmest of lights he would have been able to make out the headline:
“It sort of is, but it’s also very vague. There are so many words that I presume don’t exist in Latin that have been substituted. They don’t exactly fit in the context though.” She pointed towards the word
He was dancing with a faceless man who was supposed to be incredibly beautiful, but Draco couldn’t really see his face properly anymore. He had amazing dark hair, was wearing the tightest jeans Draco had ever seen – which left
“Muggle. Picked them up from a hairdresser’s in Hampstead.”
Harry, all credit to him, stayed quiet as Draco readied himself to say his piece. Things had been building up to this for a long time, he realised. Now he was in the moment, he knew he was so unbelievably unprepared for it.
He felt an unfamiliar twist in his chest as he realised that Harry was with someone. A woman. Draco shouldn’t be surprised, but it was easy to forget that Harry was equally as interested in women as he was in men. It felt like an extra twist of the knife lodged in Draco’s chest to think that Harry now hated him so much he was back to dating women.
‘I was dying for an excuse to be out of there. Kingsley had me at a Ministry networking event. It was so boring. Hello sweetie!’ She crossed the living room and picked up Hugo who started babbling away at her in a language only he understood. She laughed and kissed his cheek, pretending to know exactly what he was saying to her.
Draco wandered over to the kettle to make himself tea and he thought that it was probably some sort of fate which stopped him fulfilling his plans. This way he could be back in England for Christmas, without the weight of an apothecary across the continent on his shoulders, and he could be home for Teddy coming back just as he’d promised. Just like he had with Harry, he’d tell Teddy the truth at the first opportunity, and hope that his transparency and honestly earned him the chance he probably didn’t deserve. If it didn’t, then he’d just have to hope that one day his little wolf would grow up to understand why Draco had done what he’d done, and that it didn’t mean he loved him any less.
‘But you and father-’
‘SHUT UP! SHUT UP! SHUT UP! HARRY!’
She punched him in the arm as an answer.
‘Are you sure you’re ok with this?’ Harry’s pupils were blown wide in the dim light and it gave him an endearing quality which contrasted starkly with his James Bond-esque look. Draco would happily take both versions of him either way. Preferably without the risk to life of course.
Harry’s shoulders sagged with relief that he had, for now, tamed his new friend.
‘Actually, if I’m home for the weekend, do you think we could go to Kew Gardens? It’s ok if we can’t, it’s just I was talking to Neville and he said there are some really cool magical plants hidden in the regular ones if you know where to look.’ Draco appreciated Teddy’s interest in Herbology, he really did, but the second he mentioned Kew Gardens, every muscle in his body froze. He had that dream. Harry and Wood and his mother…
‘Missed you.’ He said more clearly, his eyes glittering. Draco’s chest ached. It was made so much worse when Teddy’s bright hair turned the exact silvery shade of Draco’s own. He felt like something was trying to claw his heart straight out of his chest.
“Harry mate, I’m so sorry, but the fox! He somehow figured out how to use the floo! I have no idea how he got the powder from the mantle. I tried to stop him, but I didn’t catch him in time and- oh.” Harry was vaguely aware that there was a bundle of silver in Ron’s arms, but everything was fogging over and he was getting confused.
“So, do we cast on the wand first, or me?” He asked, trying to keep his focus on the reason they were here.
He was almost sad as he saw the long strands of hair drop to the floor, but Ella didn’t seem to mind a bit and it really was much more convenient for her. If Daphne noticed he’d gone a little quiet she didn’t say. The truth of it was his mind had drifted off to Harry. As much as Draco hated the flip phone he’d bought, he didn’t really get calls on it very often. When he did, he’d never known any of them make him as angry as that. What could possibly have been so urgent? And on Boxing Day too. Surely no one was working in those kinds of places on Boxing Day. He guessed he’d just have to wait until later when presumably Harry would fill him in. At least, he hoped he’d fill him in.
It didn’t surprise Harry that Draco was easily enthralled by muggle food items. He’d laughed until he’d cried when Draco had discovered scotch eggs and thrown one out the window with disgust. He’d been truly amazed when Draco had professed his undying love for pickled onion flavoured Monster Munch, since the smell alone made Harry feel sick. Harry had even understood, sort of, Draco’s strange interest in dipping anything and everything in marmite just because he was determined to find something that actually went well with it.
“Can I help you?” He asked when the man continued to stare at him through the bars. His vicious smile faltered a little, but he didn’t rise to Draco’s bait.
‘I know what will help. Why don’t we put these decorations up?’ Harry smiled.
“We were just getting out of your way,” she said, straightening up to her full height like a puppet on a string. “Please excuse us.”
‘What is this?’ He didn’t want to jump to conclusions.
Things went smoothly after that. Harry had Draco drive in a long loop to avoid having to teach him to turn around – he definitely wasn’t ready for that on his first attempt. There were picking up a little speed, but not too much, and Harry was enjoying watching the trees go by. There were occasional sheep in some of the fields they passed, sometimes rows of thick hedges, other times low fences with little steps over. Harry felt rather lucky to live so close to nature, even if he was only enjoying it from inside the car.
"What?" asked Greg on his other side. The two of them had been sitting together at first but left a space between them for Draco as soon as he entered the compartment. An arrangement they had decided on years ago.
"You repeated today?" finished for him Greg.
The novelty wore off in the train, though. Draco didn’t feel like talking about all the same topics with his friends again. But did he even have to? It was a dream after all, so he could do just about anything!
"I said anything!"
"Ok, well, how do I befriend someone who already doesn’t like me?" he asked.
… He had meant to play the role at school, yes. Since he was so good at it, what a waste not to! Plus, greens had a reputation to hold unto. But that had to be his main problem with Potter. Clearly, the boy didn’t like the mean type. What a pickle!
It took a moment for Weasley to reply, where he just made more hilarious faces and gesticulated furiously "See what I mean?!" he threw Potter’s way.
Luckily, Potter stopped them before it went too far. Silence reigned for a moment, giving them time to calm down.
"Malfoy." the red head greeted back, but it sounded more like an insult.
In the great hall Granger explained the deal with the ceiling, and Draco found himself looking up again. Not as pretty as the real thing. But nice enough.
He still didn’t know what to do about Potter. Taking their time together more seriously than his last try, that’s for sure. But there was at least one thing he needed to do. Or wanted to do.
"… but I wouldn’t be against blue." he finished before locking eyes with the other boy "Why did you say it like that?"
"Yep!"
His friends thought he was joking when he told them he had a toad to rescue and a difficult wizard or two to charm.
He passed them and continued to the end of the train. Or this wagon. As soon as he got out, a brisk of wind attacked him and he had to close his eyes. Draco really didn’t want to imagine the state of his hair. He closed the door behind him with force when the first complaints were heard.
"Alright there, Draco?" asked Blaise, amused.
Waking up to see his mother face didn’t bother him any longer. In fact, he was glad to be greeted by her smile! She was pretty. And he wasn’t thinking that way only because he was her son. Narcissa Malfoy was graceful in everything she did, like it came naturally to her. Her husband equally proper, making them a fine couple indeed! Draco was very grateful of the genes he received. In a few years, he’ll be splendid! And Potter would be embarrassed to remember there was a time he didn’t like him too much.
His room.
"No, just… making sure, you know?"
Draco was very amused by the turns of events. So he asked "Anyone has a question?"
"What?" Potter looked his way with giant eyes.
Harry looked lost "Why?"
"Oh, I was serious about the study offer, by the way. Didn’t meant it to brag or anything. So, really, if you need help, I’m here! We could have a study group, with my other friends!"
Draco barely found air to breath out "Thank you."
"I went to sleep at Hogwarts," Draco started "and woke up in my bed." he looked at them one by one slowly "In my room." until he got to Vince and Greg "In Malfoy Manor."
"Ew, no!"
He rubbed his eyes to stop the tears from falling, but couldn’t do much against the quivering of his lips. What if he repeated this day forever, incapable of changing anything? This was torture. And he was so tired of it! So, so, so tired…
Draco sat down with his friends after hugging his parents goodbye. They went on to talk about the same things again. He sighed.
"That’s Harry Potter?" whispered Greg while staring at the boy with awful hair.
"You’re mental." was Weasley lovely addition.
"No, you were making fun of me. Which is rich coming from you. Don’t you also want to be in red because everyone in your family went there before you?"
They all turned to Potter. Who wasn’t particularly found of getting attention on himself. How odd.
"For fun! Ever heard of fun? It’s nice, you should try it."
"YEAH!" Pansy had to cough for speaking too fast. She always liked being first. "You said Potter would go to red, I’m guessing this one too?"
"How nice! You sure learned a lot from this experience… I almost wanted to put you in yellow."
Except Draco.
"But you guys like me, right?"
Draco felt a bit annoyed at that "Why is it funny…"
"We could." Draco said "I know I want to befriend Potter. And since you two like each other, well… if you could at least accept me…"
"Keep down the ego" Blaise proposed.
"Fun fact: my name comes from a constellation!"
There was no way Draco could win there. No place between them.
"Does it matter? I’ll keep waking up in the same bed anyway."
"Did you find the toad, then?" he heard himself ask and wondered why he had bothered doing that. Maybe he really was THIS bored.
He waved them goodbye and almost ran all the way to his friends. To tell them he would leave for a while once the train start, but he’d come back to spend some of the ride with them. Pansy pretended to be offended he had things to do. ‘What, we’re not good enough for you anymore? Hmph!’ she said with her arms crossed, looking away from him. Vince, more practical, asked where he was going.
Weasley distracted him with "Wow, are you done being a creep?"
"You were so excited yesterday..." started his mother.
