Draco got up as well, intrigued in the answer. He had been so wrapped up in comforting Harry that he had forgotten what they were doing.
“Draco,” Harry shifted to look at him. “I can’t imagine it being fair on you either. You had to go through all that knowing you would return to an uncertain future. I’m not upset…well I’m not mad. I would like my memories back and thankfully we do live in a magical world! I’ll call Hermione. After the war she returned her parents memories to them. She’ll be able to help.” Harry smiled. “In the mean time…want to go for a pint?”
Harry blushed as Hermione cleared her throat pulling the boys’ attention back to the matter at hand.
“I’m not saying it’ll be easy but I think that’s our best option right now. I know you think you found a lead with the 1800’s parchment mentioning something that seemed like what you went through but if there had been any actual information on how it happened it would be in the book…hell if there was a record of someone actually time travelling with no item it would be well known.”
“If we don’t do this, you’ll have gone through conversations I don’t remember. You’ll probably have to have those conversations all over again,” Harry said as he took Draco’s hand in his own. “We’ll have different memories on what our first kiss was. There might be moments where you think I know something about you but I don’t remember it. And I don’t know what it is that you know about me. I don’t want you to get bored hearing the same stories.”
“No,” Harry breathed. “I don’t want to forget it. I want to do it again but this time I want to actually participate.”
Harry turned to Draco, fully ready to embrace the man he loved and needing to feel him physically close to him.
At that moment Harry believed it so strongly. He was going to be alone. His fears would come true. He tried to catch his breath not finding enough air to fill his lungs. Hermione regretfully pushed on.
Hermione smiled miserably. “I’m so sorry guys. This isn’t just about Draco’s sanity. Any alteration to change a humane death could cause the end of the world. It would be cheating death which comes with dire consequences. We all saw what happened to Voldermort when he did it.” Draco recoiled at the name. Hermione continued, “The only way would be to use the resurrection stone but the logistics of retrieving it and getting it to Harry before his death are so magnanimous that I truly think it’s impossible.”
“No. Just sucked each other off. Honestly, I never went all the way with a guy when we were in school. I was too busy trying not to die every year.”
“Well we could use Van Gogh’s elixir. It heightens emotions but is very dangerous. Too much of it can drive you mad.” Why was she even suggesting this?
“I shouldn’t be complaining,” he said to the empty room. Harry was alive. That’s always been what mattered the most. The fact that he had to go through having a first kiss again was nothing compared to the idea of never seeing Harry again. Harry wanted to kiss him. Harry was breaking up with someone for him. Harry, the Harry of his current time, was into him! Draco grinned feeling elated.
“Agreed. Can I ask you something about the future? I mean…no harm in it since we’re obliviating me, right?”
Harry pushed the books away. “You’re right, I’m sorry. I just can’t help but worry how this will affect you once you return.”
Eventually Draco checked the time. Almost 2am. He didn’t want to go to bed, scared of what his dreams would bring. He wanted to be with Harry. Needed to feel close to him. He got up and walked over to floo and drunkenly called out GRIMMAULD PLACE.
Turning them to look at their spine, he took in the titles. Some were specifically about time travelling, some were about magical items such as time turners. One was specifically called Theories of poppycock magic. This last title, Draco read out loud.
Draco shrugged. “What part of my looks are you more attracted to?” he asked wanting to put back some levity in the moment.
“Well I get that you’re stuck here and would like to go back to your time but I would also like to not die if that’s possible.”
“You smell disgusting. Shower’s through there. I’ll have breakfast ready.” Harry turned to leave the room but Draco grabbed his hand. Harry turned around. Draco looked up at him with wide eyes scared to watch the man walk away. “It’ll be ok. I’m not dead,” Harry promised and with a squeeze of Draco’s hand he disconnected them and left the room.
Draco bit his lip. “Yeah. I regret calling Hermione a mudblood. I also regret the way I introduced myself to you in first year. Spouting ideas on social hierarchy and demeaning Weasley. No wonder you didn’t accept my offer of friendship.”
Harry got up and left the room. He returned with a copy of the day’s Daily Prophet. August 5th 2001.
Hermione understood. Even though she didn’t want to put her best friend through this it was ultimately his choice and if she could help him regain memories he desperately wanted back, she would help him.
“Unless you’re Harry of course. He’s the guardian of the stone,” Hermione added. “So to get it we would need to get Harry to access it, which won’t be possible without breaking time travelling rules.”
“I know but we have no idea how Draco time travelled and our only bet is to steal the Time-Turner from the Ministry.”
“Nothing. Showed up in a muggle farmer’s field. Signature on it is all cocked up, the Illegal Use of Magic division can’t figure out a thing.”
“It’s not important. Like you said you died and I rather not go back with confirmation that the saviour of the wizarding world could have never liked me. Hurts my head to just think about it.” Faced with the option, Draco decided it was best to go back still not knowing what would have happened if he had been brave enough to ask Harry out. Not knowing was better than having your heart crushed.
They decided it was best to do this at Grimmauld place. That way Harry would be in a comfortable setting. Ron had chosen not to participate.
Hermione smiled a little sadly. “As much as I would like my memories back to know exactly how you persuaded me to break the law and help you with that, you need to understand how dangerous it is. Returning erased memories can be very painful. Death eaters used torture during the wars to do it.”
They had chosen to keep all conversations to general, light topics. Draco didn’t want to get into serious subjects he might already know about until Harry’s memories were back. They had also stopped themselves from going any further than snogging…which was frankly driving but of them insane.
Draco got up and headed for the door. Harry followed suit but stopped Draco in the hallway to kiss him again. Their trek to the bedroom took longer then necessary as one kept stopping the other to kiss some more.
He appeared in a country field with cows munching on some grass. Draco looked up at the sky and took a moment to compose himself. H turned the item around his neck. The world started spinning.
He moved in to a one bedroom flat and continued on with his life. He slowly became more open to people’s invitations to join them for lunch or an after-work pint. He found that people could actually be kind. He started opening up, making amends. One day Luna asked him if he wanted to join them at the pub on Friday. Them involving the golden trio. Draco hesitantly accepted, a little worried of how the three would act towards him but he was pleasantly surprised when they had smiled and welcomed him to their table when he did show up.
“Like I was saying, I’m not complaining,” Harry continued. Draco whined and laid back down. “It’s just that we’re adults now Draco…getting old and all. I want to make it clear that I’m not just interested in you for a good snog…or shag. I want a relationship with you. Something serious. I still am very confused as to why you rushed into my flat and attacked my lips with yours all of a sudden but I want to do this right.”
“What do you care! Look, like I said I’m sorry I kissed you. I’m a coward Harry. Always have been. You know that’s a fact, you’ve witnessed me run away during the wars. I’m sorry, I had one foolish moment of bravery.  I won’t do it again. Forget it ever happened.” Draco went to close the door but Harry blocked him.
“I’ve found a few spells that could alter the Time-Turner. I think if I combine some of them, I might be able to make it go far into the future. The problem is, we won’t be able to test it. Everyone who has tried it has gotten caught because the magical signature caused by the Time-Turner going forward alerts the Department of Improper Use of Magic and they come swooping in to make an arrest.”
“No, I mean…why is this happening? Did something happen? Are you under the influence of something? Cursed? I mean why else would you randomly appeared in my flat and kiss me like that?”
Draco woke up the next morning with a naked Harry tangled around him. He looked at the sleeping figure, not wanting to wake him. His now alcohol-free thoughts realized that he would have to leave with the knowledge of what the man he loved tasted like. He now knew how his skin felt beneath his fingers, how the curves of his body fit with his. How they had wasted years not admitting their mutual feelings out of stupid fear. Draco bit his lip and closed his eyes trying to will himself not to cry. He deeply wished things were different. Deeply wished time travelling didn’t have so many rules. Maybe he could stay here. Hide away from everyone and never go back but still have Harry…at least for six years.
Harry placed a floo call to Ron and Hermione’s. The first person he saw was Ron who greeted him joyfully.
Once in what he figured was a guess room, he looked at the bed and then down at himself. Not having exactly planned out this lovely trip in time he hadn’t brought any spare clothes. How long would he have to spend in his funeral outfit? It would become a constant reminder of the day he left behind. He undressed, avoiding to look at his arm where the dark mark was. He very rarely stayed the night at other people’s places in order to have it not be seen. On those rare occasion that he did, he wore a long-sleeved shirt to bed, however warm and uncomfortable it was.
Harry wasn’t sure how to take this news. He just shook his head. “It’s not that simple. Can we come over?”
“I do.” Draco finished his glass and a fourth was poured. It loosened his tongue. “I’m not good enough for you, Harry.”
Alongside Harry himself and Ronald Weasley, Draco had become an auror in his adult life. It came as a surprised to no one when Harry and Ron became partners. Draco had gone through a few unsatisfactory partners himself before being paired with a witch named Cindy-Lou whose joyous nature drove him up the wall most days but damn if she was not excellent at her job so he never put in for a partner transfer.
The two men embraced again, kissing the way one can only do when they know they have to say good bye. Draco got up and extended his hand to take Harry’s. Harry took it, getting up from his chair. He was led to his bedroom where the door was delicately closed behind them. Draco started the kiss up again while undressing Harry. He pushed the now naked wizard to lie on the bed while he undressed himself. The passion that ensued was bursting with a desire that could never be expressed again.
“Yes. Luckily we now live in a word where it’s ok for same-sex couples to have children. We would have to adopt or use a surrogate though but that’s not a big deal.”
Draco waved it off, not wanting to have that particular conversation again right now. “Sorry, probably bad form to be talking about exes on a first date.” Draco took a solemn sip of his beer.
Harry reached out and placed his hands on Draco’s waste. He pulled him close so that the blonde was now sitting in his lap. Draco put his hands on Harry’s chest and felt his heart pounding. Fuck it. He brought a hand up behind Harry’s head and closed the distance between them. Lips meeting each other and instantly opening to deepen their connection. It was everything Draco had always wanted and not enough at the same time.
“The first keeper, the one that looks at the permission slip, it’s Cho Chang.” Draco announced as if that solved everything. Seeing the deadpan look on Hermione’s face he continued. “With all the history she has with Harry, we’re banking on her being so flustered that she won’t really look at the slip and just let him in.”
That’s until they were in the thick of things. Until he was asked to identify him. An act he couldn’t do knowing it would lead to the boy’s death. Throwing Harry his wand during the battle was just the right thing to do. Fuck the fear of dying.
“You’re the master of death?” Draco wrapped his arms around Harry’s neck. “That is so hot!” Draco pressed his forehead to Harry’s.
Draco sighed, exasperated. “Stop being so mature! But fine yeah I’m am all down for that. Relationship, marriage, kids!”
Draco didn’t say anything. Harry got up, set the dishes to wash themselves and set about to head to work.
He didn’t know how much time had passed until he heard someone was knocking on his door. Correction – banging. Fear gripped him when he realized it was most likely Mr. Potter here to talk because that’s what the git would do. Oh Draco, it’s ok, don’t be ashamed bla, bla, bla. Draco really didn’t want to hear it. He got up with the intention of telling the man to go away and slamming the door on his stupid scarred face.
“This makes it sound like you know where the stone is.” Draco quirked an eyebrow and Harry wrapped his hands around him.
“Malfoy?” the familiar voice slapped him in the face. This wasn’t right. Draco blinked a few times then rubbed his eyes. He couldn’t be seeing this right.
“Yup. First ever kiss was with Pansy and that just solidified it for me. Homosexual through and through.”
“Oh shut up. Also that doesn’t count as a question, you just repeated mine so it’s still your turn.”
That derailed their little question game as Harry needed to find out exactly how good a boy Draco could be.
“Hard part!” Harry took a seat at the table with them. “That wasn’t exactly an easy thing to do ‘Mione.” Harry shook his head.
“Pretty sure you were too young to even understand the fanatic bullshit on eugenics your father was instilling in you.”
Draco made love to Harry knowing that, once he found a way back, he would never see him again. It was intense and filled with unspoken emotion.
“Oh boys, you really will need a lot of luck.” Something dawned on Hermione. “Wait! That’s it. Liquid luck! I mean…it’s still probably not going to work.”
“I’m really worried you two are putting too much faith in me.” Hermione was nervous about how this would go down but looking between the two men she knew she had to try. “There’s also the matter of Harry’s death.”
Harry and Draco exchanged a look not knowing where to start. “Maybe we should sit down,” Harry proposed.
Draco got up and rushed to him, this time not stopped by Hermione. He pulled Harry into an embrace and caressed his hair. He positioned them so Harry’s back was lying on his chest.
Draco was once again pulled from his thoughts. This time by a cup of tea flying into a wall and smashing into pieces. He sluggishly inspected the seen and found that Ron had thrown it.
The boy who saved everyone wasn’t able to save himself. Or maybe it was that others weren’t able to save him. Draco didn’t really have the heart to find someone to put the blame on for this. Everything around him felt dazed. Everything inside him felt numb.
He had come to appreciate his life after Hogwarts. His father had been, thankfully, sent to Azkaban freeing Draco and his mom from his grasp. His mom had never really been the same after the war. She was more like a shell of what she used to be, never quite able to find happiness. Draco stayed isolated with her in the manor until she passed only a short three years after the war. The healers had said it had been something wrong with her heart. Draco wasted no time selling the manor after that. The memories it held of what had transpired there during the war needed to be left behind.
“Look Potter, I’m not sure I should tell you anything. Not until we can figure out the rules of time travel and how it can affect the time line.” This was unfortunately very logical. Draco pointed his wand at the books on the table. “Rules of time travel.”
“I think you’re right. We need Granger’s help,” Draco broke the silence before taking a sip of wine.
“None. I’ve always wanted to get to know you better and it looks like this is my only chance to do just that.”
“Maybe I just like seeing that sexy smirk you do when you’re up to no good,” Harry proposed, trying to lighten the mood.
They settled in the den, rearranging the chairs so Harry and Hermione would be facing each other while Draco would be sitting behind Harry, out of his line of site but still in arms reach if needed.
Draco and Hermione eventually returned and Harry got up to greet them. They stood there a little awkwardly.
You see the thing is, Draco had always rather been fond of Harry Potter. Muggle psychologist would surely inform him that his ill-natured relationship towards Harry at Hogwarts was a clear way of fighting his feelings for a boy who wasn’t returning them. All the horrible things he did to him was only to make sure he was hated back and never had to actually confront how he actually felt. That, paired with the fact that his father made sure Draco was on the opposite side during the war, just put them at odds end.
Harry and Draco sat down together on the navy loveseat. Hermione took place in a cozy purple armchair. Ron came holding tea pot with four tea cups floating behind him. With some tea and once everyone settled Draco and Harry gave each other a look before Draco started telling his story.
“It’s ok. Just go pick out a bottle of wine and have it aerated by the time I get back. Thanks love!”
Outside of Time-Turners, there are records of muggles also trying to time travel using lavish machines and what they call technology. It would appear that someone named H. G. Wells wrote an extensive account of a time traveller using one of these machines. Upon further research, I have found that muggles do not seem to take this account as real and it is an absolute waste of time to look further into it. Clearly if wizards who naturally have a superior intellect to muggles can’t figure out more than one way to time travel, muggles aren’t going to do it.
“See, ‘Mione, that’s where you come in.” Harry flashed her his best smile. “Since you’re the smartest witch in the world, we’ve figured you’d be able to alter it to go forward.”
He put the book down and abandoned his now cold cup of tea in search of something to right on, thinking it be a good idea to make notes of what he had found.
“What about the Weasley’s? Don’t you think they’ve become family?” Hermione hated having to go through with this but she didn’t feel Harry had gone far enough.
“I am not under any potions or curse or anything. I just…this is going to be a long story.” Draco was all of sudden very exhausted.
Draco sat silently listening to their exchange. He was reminded once again of how jealous he was of Harry’s relationships with people. He had such good, close friends. Friends who would do anything for him. Draco was certain that if he had been the one to ask Hermione to risk prison for him she would have said no. He decided then and there that if he found his way back to his time, he would try harder to open up with the friends he had, to build deeper relationships. Maybe not with Ron Weasley though…I mean he was a good guy, it’s just that he was annoying as f-
“At least the people that are dating you for the fame aren’t mentally messed up. Try dating people who want to be with you because you’re an ex-death eater.”
Once home, he locked his floo to any incoming visitors and went straight to his bedroom where he faceplanted on his bed. He tried telling himself that it was ok. That, at least, Harry was still alive. He knew that at one time he was loved. That was enough right? It had to be enough. Draco crawled beneath the blankets and pulled the cover over his head, willing the world to go away. He refused to cry. Refused. The tears coming out were completely irrelevant. Really.
He threw on his one outfit and went to the bathroom. He found a tube of toothpaste and used his finger to brush his teeth.
“I’m happy you haven’t been caught and arrested,” Draco reached out his hand to take Harry’s. Hermione knew now so there was no point in hiding it.
Right. Harry had forgotten about that decision of theirs to erase his memory of Draco’s visit. Well this sucked.
“Harry, you need to know I love you and I never want to leave you. Whenever you’re ready I plan on marrying you and growing old with you. I want to have kids with you and go through life experiencing everything with you.”
“Are you going to just repeat my questions to me the entire day? You should be a bit more original but ok. Theodore Nott.” Draco didn’t wait for Harry to comment before asking his next question. “Who was your first crush?”
He put the kettle on, not hungry for any breakfast but up for a cuppa. Once it was ready, he settled himself at the table and grabbed a book. Not really interested in Agnes Wonkerbats’ life stories he grabbed  Theories of poppycock magic. He looked at the index and found the chapter on itemless time travel.
“I have a theory that emotional torture could work instead of physical torture, but I don’t want to put you threw that. You would have to deal with past trauma and deep fears or insecurities.” Hermione bit her lip, she did not like this idea.
Harry eventually came back by floo. He went straight to Draco and kissed him before pulling the Time-Turner from his robes.
“Anything that involves you is worth it.” Draco rolled his eyes at how sappy that was but was happy for the levity it brought to the moment.
“No! Oh I’m sorry Harry. Oh where’s my wand?” She moved things around her desk looking for her wand to clear up the spill, making a bigger mess in the process. Harry did not move to help her.
“What do you expect me to do? Tell you my real feelings? Freak you out and have you act differently towards the current me, causing my memories to change and have me go insane?”
He didn’t really like his apartment. It was dark and drafty. The money he got from selling the manor accompanied by the Malfoy inheritance meant that he had way more money than he could handle. He could afford a better place. The thing is he never really felt like he deserved to be in a good place. His flat worked for him. Gave him a roof and a place to sleep. He never had anyone over so appearance didn’t matter.
Draco stayed quiet as he kept cooking. “I thought we were going to have a day without talking about this,” he eventually said.
Realization dawned on Harry. “The note! That was you! OH! Wow. A few years ago, me and Hermione found ourselves at my place really confused. We just thought someone had played a prank and used the confundus charm on us. I got home and found a note by my bed.”
“Sorry! I just realized how happy mum will be to know you two have finally hooked up. Now you won’t be able to say no to Sunday dinners.” Ron laughed. Hermione, who felt the seriousness of the situation gave Ron a pointed look but the red-haired man kept going. “Malfoy come on! Imagine your face if we could tell 11 year old you that you’d grow up to be surrounded by Weasleys!” Draco chuckled at that. “Are you guys going to get a ferret as a pet?” Ron asked. This seemed to have crossed a line as Hermione kicked him in the shin to shut him up. “Ronald that’s enough!”
He squashed down that last thought, no willing to entertain false hope. Death seemed like a rather finite point in a person’s life. He probably shouldn’t even have said anything to Potter about it. Or maybe he should say more? Give the man a warning to change the future. A non-alcohol induced headache took over. He felt exhausted in every way possible and since he couldn’t do much until Harry came back he opted to go back to bed.
“Um…my place. You drunkenly showed up last night.” Harry kept smiling as if this was amazingly and simply amusing to him.
Harry greeted him with a kiss. Draco asked for tea which he was denied saying they had no time to waste!
Went to work. Can’t really let people fall into comas just because you found your way trapped into the past. Help yourself to anything in the fridge. Don’t go outside.
“Yes, Harry. I want to kiss you. A lot. I like you. A lot. I’ve wasted too much time keeping my distance from you and if you think you feel the same way about me, I think we should kiss some more.”
The motion felt wrong. Too tight. The colour of the flames seemed off. It felt like his skin was being pricked all over.
Completely flustered (as planned) Cho got up to return the hand shake and in the process knocked over her cup of tea which spilled all over the permission slip.
As she stood in place confused, he offered to take her wand and suggested she take a seat. She did so trying to organize her jumbled thoughts.
Draco lit the stove and heated up some oil. “I thought we weren’t bringing anyone else into this? How many people are we going to have to obliviate?”
It was a cold, rainy day. No hope of sun coming from the clouds. It was fitting somehow, like the world knew what it had transpired. Like mother nature openly cried for the loss felt by so many witches and wizards.
Harry walked into the room and sat beside Draco on the bed. “Can you tell me what you think is going on? Did someone maybe lace your drink with a potion last night?”
“The spell I used on my parents did work but they hadn’t been living with the curse for six years. I’m not sure how much that length of time will affect it. There could be unknown risks.”
Draco blushed worried that Harry might be feeling a bit violated. “I’m sorry. Maybe I shouldn’t have said anything. Maybe I should have stopped anything from happening back then. It wasn’t fair on you.”
“He’s a muggle. I’ll have to apparate near his house. I’ll try not to take too much time. We haven’t been together for that long so I don’t see it being complicated.”
Draco fought to keep his composure the next morning when, at work, he and his partner were called to the boss’s office. He entered the room to see the Time-Turner he had used was sitting on Robard’s desk. Oh shit!
He used the floo to get home. Once inside his dingy flat he went straight for the Firewhiskey and took a sip from the bottle, bypassing using a glass. He fell to the ground and cried openly. Why couldn’t he have just found the courage to tell Harry how he felt when he still had the chance. Even if it was just to know if there was any chance Harry felt the same way.
“That’s different. Someone’s life is usually at stake and I’d be a pretty bad auror if I didn’t act to save them.” He took a sip. “You’re brave in many ways that I can’t be. Especially when it comes to your relationships with people. You’re not afraid to express yourself and trust that you can handle being hurt.”
“Drunkenly admitting to each other that we’ve been idiots?” Harry put his glass down as well. “Come here…please.”
“Draco, come on. There’s just way too much banter between the two of you. It’s obvious it’s to cover up your feelings. It’s also obvious that there’s something happening between yourself and Harry from my time.”
I place a hand on the wall closest to me and I take weighted steps towards the door. The hinges squeak as it budges open and a deep voice echoes off the stone walls, now silenced.
One part stumps me, however, where Mom writes about Dumbledore. This must have been during the beginning of the war, with mom and dad in hiding, but what did they know about Dumbledore. And why did they meet with Bathilda Bagshot?
The wand in my hand feels of a familiar evil as I Crucio the pale, dark-haired man crumpled on the floor, the man from the cafe.
I grin at Ginny’s words. I can always count on her to be a hopeless realist. I lean forwards to place a peck on her forehead, but end up at her identical height, and pull her in for a real kiss.
“Malfoy can wear Harry's clothing. I'm sure we all look rather suspicious already in these dress clothes…”
Most of the doors in the third floor hallway hang ajar; dusty old bedrooms and lavatories. The first door closed shut in the whole hall has a nameplate that announces the name of “Sirius Black” with the words “stay out!” scratched into the wood below it. I'm almost sure that Potter is in there crying his eyes out. Why not just leave him to it. Only one door in this whole hall even slightly intrigues me, anyway; it's the looming one on at the end, door shut as well. “Regulus Arcturus Black” the plaque above it reads. Now there's a familiar name, and an interesting one at that; oh, the stories they used to tell about Regulus Black.
Draco thought back and recalled noticing that Potter had barely touched his firewhiskey tonight, so he must not be more than slightly buzzed. An assent would be particularly interesting then - he also felt more comfortable at the thought of kissing Potter with lower alcohol levels in both their systems.
, Malfoy,” he growls. I grit my teeth and hold back the urge to spit. Fighting Weasley won’t end well, not now, because we aren’t tucked away at Hogwarts on either side of some petty feud anymore. This is real.
Hermione whispers a quick ‘Homenum revelio’ after gazing around the room with a cross look on her face.
Scrimgeour stands from his wooden chair, picking up a satchel from the floor. He extends a hand but his handshake is as unreturned as his remark. He let's out a barely perceptible breath and turns to leave through the front door, making me remember at a seconds notice that I am not merely a fly on the wall. I'm here, and I'm not wanted.
My voice cracking at the ends as I plead, “No, this is my job! Dumbledore gave it to me, not you. I'm not going to let you die too!”
“Ah yes, well.” The Minister keeps a placating smile on his lips while his eyes narrow, piercing through my skin. He releases my grip and steps away. “A good afternoon to you all.”
“Potter,” Mcgonagall squeezes my shoulder. I turn my head to see her slumped posture, her clenched jaw and fragile expression. The D.A. stands on the edge of the crowd, their wands spitting white sparks into the sky.
I shake my head and lament, “Snape was a spy, Hermione! He betrayed Dumbledore and who knows who else is working for Voldemort in the order. We can't share this information.”
"Nothing," replies Ron. "Harry's right, we can't do anything. We can go to sleep, and try to stay alive."
I step around the couch where the Mudblood and the Weasel sleep, poke into the room where Potter slept. It's empty now. Perhaps he's gone exploring as well.
The neighing of a thestral signals me from behind and my head whips around to recognize the scarred man and shaken witch instantly as they land on the edge of the bog. The creature raises up on its hind legs, bucking wildly as the two hold on for dear life. It’d be barely visible in the black of night if not for the moonlight that reflects off its leathery back.
He grinned, and silver eyes met green, “I’m Draco. Welcome to the wizarding world, Harry, you’re in for a lot of surprises.”
I now take a look at the rest of the ruined café, strewn with shattered glass and overturned tables. Coffee soaks through the stunned wizard near my feet. Closing my eyes, I concentrate on every memory around cleaning charms that I have. I cast all the ones I can remember, and when I open my eyes, the café looks to be in better condition that it was before our unfortunate arrival.
The locket now feels heavy around my neck and I pull it from underneath my nightshirt. I tucked it there last night, afraid that Malfoy, or the death eaters who are possibly looming, might take it. It glimmers like pure gold from the depths of Gringotts, holding immeasurable value. Through the crystal cover a snake swims through a green lake, frozen in time. My fingers shake as I hold it, my thumb pressed into the clasp as I open it for the first time.
Charlie and Neville fly into view, stepping off their broom down on the farther end of the bog. My heart stops for a moment before speeding up to Firebolt speed.
“Thank the heavens you're back!” Myrtle simpers, floating over the sinks, “Mad, that one is. Talked nonstop and wouldn't even let me get in a word,” Myrtle pouts, doughy eyed, then she sighs and slips into her stall. I walk further in, hanging off her every word.
Her face displays every bit of  the fiery  stubbornness that made me fall in love with her. She purses her lips, tucking a lock of hair behind her ear, “Tell me exactly what you'd tell any one of them, then.”
Overcome by a rage bubbling up in my chest I pull my arm from his grip, bringing it back and then swinging it forward with enough force to have Remus stumbling backwards and falling off his feet when it hits him. He falls back dazedly, dust devils swirling around him. His delirious gaze narrows in, making him look dangerous and ready to snap, like an unpulled trigger, and for a moment the fog splits and I can see right through it.
I spin around, smiling fondly and forgetting my worries at the sight of Ginny reaching helplessly behind her back for the miniscule zipper. Her hair is braided up into an intricate design at the nape of her neck above the plain, flared dress. It's a deep blue that matches her eyes. Despite her vehemently hating dresses, she does look quite beautiful dressed up in one.
Her lips are warm and soft for the moments they're on mine but she turns her head quickly, words on the tip of her tongue. The staircase creaks ominously and I throw Ginny back, pulling out my wand to find that it's only… Malfoy.
Potter nods. He emerges from the old bedroom looking red and snotty. “He didn't mention him much, though.”
I know, because that image later became ingrained in my brain, that that creature was barely recognizable as the professor I once knew and admired, it's face sagging horrendously to one side, pulling on a bloody eye, and the skin dripping off of its thin bones. The figure’s presence chokes me up, my tongue stopping short of any words, on the edge of asphyxiation.
Hope you liked this, please leave a kudos and a comment if you did. Seriously, any comment! Even if you hated it! Tell me! (Okay maybe not that lol)
It's been hours. The black sky’s dwindled to a dawn’s bittersweet blue and dew has begun to collect on the grass underneath us. Hermione’s swath of curls hides Ron’s shoulder almost completely, you'd think she was levitating off the ground in her sleep.
Hermione muses aloud to herself, an airy quality to her voice, “Now that’s fascinating. The wall must be charmed to display a familial disgrace once a family member has been declared a such? Or perhaps there’s a particular magical phrase that must be said to trigger the burn? Or –”
The door creaks open and I shove him forward. “We haven't got all night. They're still looking for us.”
I point to Black’s room and they rush inside, slamming the door behind them. Slowly, I tiptoe over and press my ear to the door. Gryffindors are always far too loud regardless.
“And what about you Harry! You can't keep putting everyone's life ahead of yours and think that's doing anyone any good! That's not how love works!”
The man sitting farthest to the left casts a glance at me, his eyes so blue they appear white, like blank orbs with small black pupils. As his hand moves oh so slightly inside his too long sleeves, my hand goes to my forehead, then my eyes to Hermione’s and Ron’s faces, and, worst of all, Malfoy’s, all unglamoured.
The spell hits me like a dunk into ice-cold water, pulling me straight through the haze and back to a rightful mind in one sharp, too quick tug at the temple.
Granger then proceeds to push him into a corner, whispering quietly, but intently. Her voice sounds soothing, almost, and Potter’s growling dulls to a low hum. Weasley looks at me with a side eye and I turn away.
Draco ached to do more. He knew he had intrigued spectators, but he didn’t care. Let them watch! He smirked to himself at the thought. He would never have expected an opportunity like this. Actually kissing Potter, feeling him in his arms, was so much
Dumbledore’s weight is leaning heavily on my shoulder. The man’s usually solemn, stoic face is contorted into a pained expression.
Ron must have yielded the couch to Hermione and lay now directly beneath her, so close they're almost touching. Her hand hangs off the side, brushing his fingers with every breath, and I despise them for it. Ron’s hair is bright, so fiery, so reminiscent, and yet she's too far. And they're too close. I'm so cold.
When it looked like Draco and Potter had completely forgotten where they were and looked dangerously close to progressing further, Theo cleared his throat pointedly.
So maybe I should have got out while I could? Refused to go through with the murder and taken the hand Dumbledore held out to me on so many occasions, but what would happen then? I'd get out and leave my family to suffer or else the Order would drain me of information like they are now and then throw me into Azkaban for the crime that is being me.
The got a corner booth and Draco went up to the bar to get a couple of beers. When he got back, he placed them on the table and settled himself across from Harry.
“I suggest we use Veritaserum during the…interview…that way you’re forced to face the truth regarding how deep this fear goes.” Hermione always coming up with a plan.
Harry and Hermione exchanged a knowing look. Draco sat up. “Wait? What? You know where the stone is?”
Harry sighed remembering how he had once died already. Maybe this was his punishment for cheating death once before.
“A few things can cause time alterations. I should avoid talking to anyone I know. I should not tell anyone what happens in the future. Altering the life of creatures is fairly safe for some boring reason.”
“We’ve already talked about this.” Harry gave her a look. “We need to just drop it, it can’t be done.”
“We better call it a night,” Harry finally suggested. “We have work tomorrow.” Draco nodded in agreement.
“Would she honestly blindly help you break one of the strictest laws without knowing why? Even if she knew it was to help me, she probably wouldn’t do it.”
They owled Hermione after breakfast thinking it would be a little slower than using the floo network, thus giving them more time alone.
Draco turned around and looked at Harry as if he had three heads. “Harry, witches and wizards way smarter than us have tried to make Time-Turners go forward for years and never succeeded.”
“Hermione please don’t push it. This is hard enough as it is. Our main focus has to be to get Draco back intact.”
Once in the alleyway Draco threw up. He felt to the dirty pavement, hyperventilating and not caring about getting his usually pristine outfit dirty. Harry was alive. Right? Draco had a hard time distinguishing which memory was real. He needed to believe that it had worked. He tried standing and apparated to this flat just in time to fall to the ground again. Draco felt stunned. Did this mean he was going mad? Did he care as long as Harry was alive?
When the world settled down again, Draco tried to catch his breath. He found himself chocking on air. Everything felt wrong. His skin was on fire. The worst was his head. It felt like it was about to shatter into a thousand pieces.
The second keeper was a witch just a little younger than Harry. She had clear skin and jet black hair. She reminded Harry a bit of the muggle fairy tale Snow White. Without looking up from her desk, she extended her hand for the paper. Harry handed it to her and she looked at it quickly to see which object was requested. As the second keeper her job wasn’t to vet the papers, that’s what Cho was for. All the information she needed from it was the title of the item.
“I didn’t use a time turner.” Draco held his hand out in a motion to tell Harry to stay quiet. “Yes, I know, there is no known way of time travelling without a time turner. I’m not a first year you know. We need to go to the Ministry, maybe talk to someone in the Department of Magical Anomalies…or even that boring research department.”
They knew the item in question was held in the secure vault of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, specifically the controlled section. As an auror, Harry had access to the vault but to remove and illegal item he needed special permission. The permission had to be presented to the first keeper of the vault who granted access to the second keeper. The second keeper opened the vault door and walked you to the item requested where only her wands signature could release the item from the spell keeping it locked up safe and sound. All they had to do was forge a permission slip, confundus the second keeper to get her wand, remove the Time-Turner, get the hell out of there and back to Grimmauld Place.
The next couple of days went by way too quickly for Harry’s liking. This was evidently going to suck but he had made up his mind. He didn’t know what conversations or experiences he and Draco had already been through and he could tell the other man got sad whenever something would come up that they had either clearly already covered or gone experienced. He also felt like Draco was holding back, almost like he was scared to relive certain things again and he didn’t want to push him. Harry needed to do this so once the potion was acquired, they set up a time for Hermione to come over.
“It’s ok to want to talk about it you know. Especially with the way you and Harry…you know…how things were with you two.”
“Not important right now.” Draco went back in for another kiss but Harry stopped him by gently placing his hands on this chest.
“Ha. Ha.” Draco started rummaging around the pantry not really knowing what Harry had for him to work with. This may have not been the smartest plan since he wasn’t in his own kitchen.
“Will you stop cutting me off like that! Apparently, I die in six years and apparently, I die not knowing whatever you mean by what your real feelings are towards me. That means I go six years thinking that you only tolerate me. What if I promise to continue acting like you only tolerate me with the present you…well past you…the you in my present.”
Draco looked down at his now less than crisp black outfit. He was going to burn it once he returned home. Hermione handed him the Time-Turner which he promptly placed around his neck.
Harry thought of the last few days and what they had meant to him. He was about to lose something he had wanted for years and the worse part is he wouldn’t even remember it. At least he wouldn’t remember the part where he dies in the not so distant future. He wasn’t sure which one of those things scared him the most. He wished he could do something to let the Draco of his time know how strong his feelings for him were. The risks were just too high.
“Fine, let’s just figure out how to get me back so you’re not forced to spend any more time than you have to with me.” Draco got up.
What the hell was taking Harry so long! Maybe after seeing Josh he decided he actually didn’t want to be with Draco. This sucked! He had already gone through the motions of declaring his feelings for the man once before why did he have to do it again!
His attention was taken away by a notification that Draco Malfoy was requesting permission to enter through floo.
Everything after that was a blur, a mess of this and that, of death and guilt. They were all walking towards the entrance. The death eaters were there. Voldemort was there. Hagrid was there. Hagrid was holding Harry. Harry wasn’t moving. Harry was pale. Out of life. Harry was gone. It was silent, so very silent. The only break they got was when Ginny Weasley pushed her way up to the front. “No! NO!” She wasn’t the only one who felt any remaining strands of hope, of light, disappear. “Just because Harry’s gone, doesn’t mean he’s left us! He's with us! In our hearts, in our memories. And YOU! He’s still with you, Voldemort. I’m not afraid of you!” Neville was holding the sorting hat, he reached in, and out came the sword of Gryffindor. He swung it around and held it pointed at Voldemort, who laughed. “You think a sword can stop me! Ha! Foolish child, just like your parents. I’m your leader now, Harry Potter is DEAD! So come forth and bow to me! The most powerful wizard in the world!”
"And I wasn't alone, I had toys and my imagination. When I was little and couldn't do any magic, or it was easily covered, Dudley used to play with me, but then my magic started growing stronger, so Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia had to make it stop." Draco let Harry talk, he knew by now that it was what he needed to do. Plus, on occasion, it was nice to just listen to Harry's voice, even if he was talking about unhappy memories or bad days that he'd had. Draco found it helped him, too.
Draco didn’t seem fazed by it at all… in fact, he smiled gently, and opened his eyes to look directly into gentle, and bold, green ones. Taking a breath he said, “It’s funny…”
“Yes, it’s right here in my pocket…” Harry reached into his pocket and grabbed the ring out of the box, and amidst his excitement, he flung it across the room and it landed in the fireplace. “BLOODY-” Harry scurried over to the fireplace and stuck his hand in the fire quickly to grab the ring.
“Why didn’t you tell her? Bellatrix. You knew it was me. Why didn’t you tell her?” The only thing Draco wanted to say he couldn’t. He wanted to say that he loved him, he wanted to tell Harry to not do it, to not leave him. But he couldn’t, not with Goyle and Blaise right behind him. "You know why, Harry. And do it again and again and again, if I had to."
Draco knew he was thinking about all the people they had lost, and yeah, it was a lot. Everyone knew that. He couldn’t lie, they lost good people. Remus, Tonks, Fred… he could go on. “Harry, look at me.” Draco didn’t know what he was going to say, and instead opened and closed his mouth trying to figure it out. Harry squinted at him and grinned. “What?”
“Thank you, Hermione. I just knew that these would be hard to find and I don't have anything at home and-”
As they walked up the street, Draco realized that he had forgotten the engagement ring at the shop. Deep in his thoughts, he failed to realize that he had facepalmed out loud.
They had both been to a mind healer, some appointments were together. Most of the time they spent together was after a really bad night.
things not to her but me and everyone important to me," he gestured to Harry, "also. Not to mention what they
"I don't know, Draco. It'll take a long, long time for everything to be okay, and I doubt anything will ever be normal, ever again. Not that it ever was," Harry traced shapes and random lines up and down Draco's arm and across his back. "Once, I thought that I'd never, ever, see what the real world was like, or have friends, let alone a boyfriend. I thought the only place I would ever be able to go, was a cupboard. Sometimes I wish I could go back there. It's, er, hard to understand, because the people I was with were abusive, but, it was a safe place. I could think about what living was actually like.
“Harry! You did it! It’s over. He’s… gone...” Hermione became less confident in her voice as she looked at Harry. Draco remembered vividly what had happened. Hermione and Ron ran after Harry. Harry who had just killed someone. Guilt consumed him. He drowned in it. He fell to his knees. He curled up in a ball, wanting the Earth to swallow him. “Harry. Are you okay?”
Harry was high on adrenalin, the air whipping in his ears, stinging his scar, his legs growing tired but not noticing because he was
They met in Madam Malkins, briefly, before Draco was called by his mother. Harry stared into his intriguing grey eyes. Draco stared into Harry’s marvelously green eyes. They reminded him of someone, sometime, before he could remember barely anything. They had not asked one another’s name, but they were instantly connected, even if Harry had thought that the kid was a prick. Draco had had a similar thought himself.
It took him almost the entire year to show up. Draco was furious and relieved to see him. They couldn’t talk to each other much, personally. Not in front of everyone, but when Harry had appeared through the portrait in the hideout others-mostly Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, and Ravenclaws- it was okay. They had talked for a couple of moments and Draco had surprised Harry by hugging him before they all had to leave. Draco cried that night. Harry was there for one day, gone the next. They would see each other soon enough, though, if not too soon.
Harry bit his lip, a memory- though not his- triggered, reminding him of a man he was not always fond of, but knew that in the end loved him. “Always,” and smiled at the jeweler. “Thank you. And, I never quite caught your name.”
“This place,” he walked into taller grass while Harry watched him. “It reminds me of... home. I mean, not the manor. A place we'd occasionally go in the summer. Before Hogwarts,” he looked at Harry, “Before you.” At this moment, Draco didn’t feel grounded, warm, cold. He felt, he felt like he was running, but not running at all. “Do you ever feel like-” Draco whispered. “Like you're running, but never really running, just the out of breath feel, but not? Like you’ve run your whole life and then, it just stops, you stop. And everything is just, floating…”
They had started 6th year silent to each other. But over time, and they had no idea how (especially after the bathroom, Malfoy was not only SO embarrassed, he was hurt), they became... friends? No- maybe. They were something. They met in the Room of Requirement (RoR) almost every day just to talk. It was nice. Tense, uncomfortable, but somehow friendly.
he stood for a moment more, watching. He solemnly walked up to Voldemort and was greeted in a most unpleasant hug. It was cold. Draco felt cold, empty, heartless. He wasn’t whole. He had never been whole. Not without Harry. Harry made him whole. He never had a home. Hogwarts became his home. Then it was Harry. Harry was his home. Have you ever felt so low, so lonely, that even just someone saying hi to you, can make your day? Draco had felt the exact opposite of that. He had felt happy, and peaceful, content. But now he felt torn and numb like his soul was torn into so many different corners and only left him enough to live. But he put on a mask, one that he had spent so long forming, the mask that he had only let fall in front of so many people.
Goyle was the one to start the fiendfyre. Harry was the one who saved him. Draco held on so tight it hurt. Ron had saved Blaise. Harry flew them out, landed, and immediately turned to Draco and kissed him. It was goodbye, perhaps forever, and they both knew it. It was a passionate kiss, fueled by hate and love, sorrow and joy, it was both hello and goodbye. Ron flew out with Blaise as they parted. Draco was surprised that no one had noticed by then, except for Hermione, but Draco had had the feeling that she'd known for a while. Before Harry flew off to the forest, and Ron flew with Hermione to kill the last Horcrux, Harry’s voice was filled with regret as he said, “I love you,” and kissed Draco one last time.
Harry hadn’t any idea when or how they ended up half an inch apart in the forest (the one strictly banned to all students) or how they had not yet noticed the increasing chill in the air. Possibly, it was because the heat was radiating between them, maybe it was because they didn’t care, because they were so, so, close that ghosts of warm breaths were shadowing their faces. When they had noticed, it was Draco who stumbled away, screamed, ran, who had left Harry alone, with no knowledge of how to protect himself against the hooded thing, but a simple, most likely ineffective, disarming charm. Yeah, he was mad, and he wouldn't have lived if it hadn’t been for the centaurs.
They finished their food and sat back-to-back, looking at the clouds as they passed. Draco realized that now would be the perfect time to propose. Harry was thinking the same, the sky was turning a darker blue but the sun was just above the horizon, setting off a gentle light and causing a ripple of different colors flowing out above them. They both simultaneously pulled their rings out of their pockets, without knowing they were in sync.
Dumbledore had said that to him. But he couldn’t help but feel some sort of... guilt, maybe. After all, he had just killed someone.
“Yet. We haven’t yet.” Harry gave him an accusatory look and Draco booped his nose, making Harry go cross-eyed. “Merde, Tu es tellement stupide. Mais Je t'aime.” Harry had no idea what he just said, but he smiled regardless.
“Hm… and it’s your stupid face that’s making me do this,” Harry turned and grabbed Draco’s face and kissed him softly, but using his magic he sent a whirlwind of strength, warmth, and as much love as he could before pulling away and resting his forehead against Draco’s. “I can’t help falling in love with you,” Draco smiled gently and rubbed noses with Harry.
. He was fighting. And he someone to fight for, someone other than his best friends, someone he loved and loved him in return. It felt
Draco, lo and behold him, had lost the coin when his father- quite literally- threw him in the dungeons. He had been through multiple crucio’s in a week, he couldn’t move. After the crucio’s stopped, he was starved. At least I can move, was his only thought. One day, after an ever-so-sparse meal that his mother had begged his father to give him, he sat up, and still recovering from the weeks of crucio, crawled over to where a shred of light was hitting something and bouncing into his eye. He picked it up, the coin, he remembered. It felt warm in his hand. Comfortable. He gently whispered,
As Harry walked out of the fire and dusted himself off, Hermione made a pot of tea. “So… did you find a ring?”
He heard Voldemort in everyone's head, he was in his too. He knew that Harry would be there. That he would die. Again. So he ran. He ran back to the once wondrous and safe, but now dark and deluded, castle. He searched. He went to the RoR, he put up a half-act. He didn't mean any of it.
“Nope. Here,” Harry handed him a bag that looked like it had clothes in it. “Put them on and then meet me in the garden.”
“I never said you did. I merely said I’m not the only person in existence that has a dark and fairly odd sense of what is funny to them.”
“Unreal… like it’s too perfect to be real… but it is- real. Almost like running on clouds or walking on water.”
Harry quietly sang a couple of lines from a muggle song that he had heard when he was younger, “Like a river flows, surely to the sea Darling, so it goes, some things are meant to be. Take my hand- Take my whole life too- For I can't help falling in love with you.” He set a flower crown on Draco’s head and looked at him. Draco looked content, and with the last bit of sunlight quieting, he looked quite- well- beautiful.
could make him. Draco had told him that he might not answer for a while but, Harry didn't think he meant
“Neither can I.” Draco linked arms with Harry and walked off to Fortescue’s, pushing off thoughts of the ring for a moment.
pissed Draco off. "Yes, I do have the mark, and yes, I did live with Voldemort." He felt sick. "But did neither by
"Oh?" Harry wrapped his arms around Draco- who was working on homework for ancient runes- from behind. He was trying to get used to touching, both receiving and giving, it was easy to accept Hermione's hugs, but it had taken years for that. "What did you mean then?"
Draco smiled and his eyes crinkled (though he would deny that later, for no particular reason). Harry folded his hands behind his fiance's neck and pulled him in for another kiss.
“Love, the truest and most important love, is worth more than any amount of gold, silver, life, death, money- could ever buy. And that,” she put the ring in the box, “is why you will take this ring,” bagging the box, she continued, “and only if you are 100% sure that he is the one,” she shoved the bag in his hand and took a deep breath to hurriedly spout the last bit, “give it to him, not to show how much you love him in objects, but to show that you will stay by his side and love him for who he is, till death do you part.” She took a step back and brushed herself off from her previous stance, which would be leaning over the counter and pointing her finger into Harry’s chest.
“Shut up Ron!” Draco ran over to him. Hermione gave him an understanding look and nodded. Ron, however, took a more defensive stance.
He was at the manor. He was there. In front of him. In front of his Aunt Bella, his mother, his father, Greyback… “Call him! Draco! Call him!” He hadn’t got the chance before Bellatrix was grabbing the back of his neck and forcing him down on his knees, snapping his head forward, in front of the three captures. None of which looked healthy, or well, at all. He didn’t identify them. How could he? But that had only meant that when they had found that it
Draco felt completely sick when he had been asked to use the unforgivables. How could he? They were innocent people. They had lived, probably families, loved ones. None of them deserved to die. None. And he couldn't cast the spells anyway, he didn't-
Draco raised his left eyebrow in suspicion and curiosity, but he listened. Five minutes later he was wearing black jeans, a tee, and a charcoal-colored jacket. I should grab the ring now, in case the time comes, Draco thought. He picked the ring up and flicked in the air, catching it smoothly.
“Shut up.” Harry playfully shoved Draco to the ground and sat down beside him. He pulled out the silverware, set out the tea sandwiches and croissants, and poured them each a glass of cider. After a while of eating, Harry reached in the basket, pulled out a radio, and tuned it to a station with slow music.
Draco had been busy brewing potions all day. As he closed up the potions and coffee shop he and Harry had named, “Deathly Hallows” for lunch, he wondered where Harry was. He was usually home for lunch by this time. Speak of the devil, Draco thought as Harry walked in, looking thoughtful.
Very early Saturday morning, Draco used the floo to get to Harry’s. He had been refusing staying over even though Harry assured him it was only to cuddle. Draco just didn’t have the emotional strength right now to go through the whole mutilated mark conversation.
“Yes. Not as good as I would like though. Which is my fault. I’m always keeping people at arms length.”
Harry returned home after work holding Indian take-away in one hand and a leather book back hooked around his other arm.
“Of course,” Hermione supported this decision. She got up and advised them to contact her tomorrow, when they were ready. She said good bye and took her leave.
“You died and I somehow traveled back in time to six years ago and saved your life.” It all rushed out.
“Yeah, mine never really last too long. I get a lot of people wanting to date me for the glory of being with the great Harry Potter. That’s why I’ve started dating muggles exclusively.”
He opened the book bag that looked like it could contain two, three books max. Of course, this was no ordinary bag. He took out seven rather large books from it. Thank Merlin for magic!
“DRACO! We’re supposed to ask her if it’s ok to obliviate her after we give her sensitive information! Not just dive right in and hope we get her permission after,” Harry scolded. Hermione looked from one man to the other trying not to let her panic take over.
“Oh lay off it. He was gorgeous and obsessed with Quidditch. Of course I was going to like him! Your turn. Let’s see…what could I ask…I can ask anything?”
“You know I’ve always hated your bravery,” Draco said while looking at the amber liquid in his glass.
“That actually sounds really great. I need to go to the loo first. I’ll then go get us some tea and come back to bed. We’ll stay here as long as possible until we absolutely need food.”
“Not really. We’re going to obliviate me remember so what do I have to lose from telling you that you’re the first thing I think about in the morning and the last thing I think about at night. What do I have to lose now by telling you that I wish you would look at me differently? Since sixth year.”
Draco grabbed the book and looked at the page it had opened itself up to. “Particularities of time travel. Do’s and Don’ts,” he read out. “Well that seems specifically important to my situation.”
“Are you done?” Hermione asked. Ron, who seemed to now notice the scalding look she had on her face nodded to say yes. Hermione returned her attention to Draco and Harry. “How long did you say it’s been since we were obliviated?” she asked, getting down to the important matter at hand.
“Potter, one of the do’s and don’ts was to not let anyone know you’re from the future. This clearly went out the window when it comes to you but perhaps we should keep it between us. I rather return to my time with my sanity intact.”
“Yes, but those witches and wizards left research which you can look into, piece it all together and then figure it out?”
“I’m sorry but if you want to do this we will have to get personal,” Hermione crossed her arms. She didn’t like where this was going.
He decided he didn’t care what the consequences were. He had to do something. If he ended up committed to an institution, so be it. If the world imploded, that would be fine by him. He’d rather live in a world with Harry, whether it was a good world or post-apocalyptic one, than a world without him. They say if someone loves you, they’ll move mountains to be with you. Well, Draco was about to move some fucking mountains.
Draco rolled around under the blankets feeling comfortable and content. He told himself he would not dwell on the future today and would simply enjoy his time with Harry.
“That’s a good idea. We need to make sure this works and with the potion and the elixir, we’re sure to push the limits of my emotions.”
“I haven’t even thought of doing groceries since you’ve gotten here. Alright, I’ll go get us some take-away, you wait here.”
It took two days for Draco to be satisfied with his forgery. Harry finished the Liquid Luck on the first day and went in to work the second day in order to not raise any suspicions.
“I know a lot of things about you…” Draco really didn’t know how much he was allowed to divulge. “When I went back in time…we…hung out. Things…um…happened…we talked a lot.”
Close friends and family gathered in the graveyard of Godrick’s Hollow. Most had their wands up utilizing the umbrella spell. Draco wasn’t sure how he ended up invited to the very private funeral but here he was, not using anything to shield himself from the rain. He couldn’t feel it anyways.
“Do you regret anything from your days at Hogwarts?” Harry asked. “Nothing like war related, just something small.”
“Harry, of course I’ll help. I’ll always help, especially if it’s a matter of life and death. And yes, I agree it’s best we erase our memories. Thank you for requesting my permission.”
Draco grabbed one of the books. Time Turner travel stories of Agnes Wonkerbat. He hated research. He utilised that particular department of the Ministry way too often to get out of doing it himself.
“Oh Harry!” Hermione gave him a hug. “It depends how deep the fear is but we could try. You have to understand that this has to go to a deeply disturbing point, we are talking psychological torture Harry.”
“That doesn’t matter. We’ll get through it. I just want to be able to be with you and if that means repeating some conversations, I can definitely live with it,” Draco squeezed Harry’s hand. Harry did not look convinced.
“Harry!” Cho on the other hand was instantly frazzled. “I haven’t seen you in ages, usually Ronald is the one that comes and collects anything you two need.”
“There must be something we can do,” Hermione pressed. “Draco?” Hermione looked at him. Draco couldn’t meet her eyes. This wasn’t fair.
“Do you think it’s safe to ask for Hermione’s help? She’s always been the strong one when it comes to research.”
With a sigh, I nod and grip my wand tightly, closing my eyes once more. Quietly, I whisper, “Number Twelve Grimmauld Place.”
, but Harry’d never forgive her if he died before speaking up. For some reason he really believed that Malfoy was worth the trouble. Maybe she'd better put a little faith in him. He'd had enough trouble as is, right?
Sleepily, I stumble to the back entrance of the castle, shoving the doors open unceremoniously. I feel like I'm in a haze.
“Potter, my wand!” Malfoy shouts from his position hunched in the corner of the counter below the cash register.
This would be his one chance to set things right. Everything, his whole future at Hogwarts, depended on how this breathtaking boy with messy hair and startlingly green eyes standing before him decided to respond.
“If they didn't I highly doubt they'd be throwing curses, ‘Mione!” I rise for half a second to throw a stunner that one of the men blocks.
“Dumbledore gave us a mission before he died and I need his… help. He knows things. Things that will help us.” Remus’ eyes turn glossy and he takes a single step forward.
I then see the nameplate of Sirius’ old bedroom room and push open the door, feeling almost drawn to it. It looks unchanged as ever. After his death I would come back to this room. I still can feel his presence as I did then, as if it was hanging off of the peeling wallpaper, ingrained in the floorboards.
“No, he can’t do anything,” Potter says. “He doesn't have a wand now and he's not getting one, so let's leave it at that.”
“In fact I do. The poison? It could’ve ended up with anyone. In fact, I believe it was Mr. Weasley who consumed it.
I make it down the two flights, then I can hear clattering foosteps behind the door. I draw my wand, ready to attack, and turn back to warn Dumbledore, when the words die on my tongue and my body goes rigid.
“Unfortunately, I do.” he laughs, “And I'd recommend you didn't risk your life with my friends in order to save your bloody Slytherin pride.” Weasley releases me and walks slowly, just a few feet behind Potter and Granger and a few feet ahead of me. “You'll get yourself killed that way.”
Malfoy inches closer, “You’ve been trying to stop this movement all year, and here it takes only moments for me to have you at my will.“
Draco peppered kisses down Potter’s neck, biting intermittently, loving the feel of Potter’s body underneath his own. Potter whimpered, lost in the overwhelming intensity of Draco’s ministrations. Never before had Potter felt such incredible sensation from any form of intimacy, especially not from mere snogging. He wanted more,
Malfoy raise a white eyebrow judgingly, but coughs into his elbow harshly, quickly banishing any previous appearance of his usual prissy, aristocratic persona. His face is greener than usual and his arms are covered in bruises and cuts, the bright orange of the room only serving to make him look more sickly. He's pitiable, at best.
Three more deatheaters walk in behind Lestrange and climb the stairs. I can not see them properly until they reach the top floor.
I hope you liked this chapter, and please leave a comment letting me know (I loveeee constructive criticism) and kudos if you did. Seriously, any comment! Even if you hated it! Tell me! (Okay maybe not that lol)
As Draco deepened the kiss once more, he pushed his weight forward until they both lost their balance. Potter toppled backwards with Draco on top of him, their audience of astonished peers utterly forgotten. Potter’s glasses clattered to the floor unheeded. Draco straddled Potter’s hips, gratified to feel that Potter was as hard as he already was.
“Don't think this changes anything,” I hiss, raising my wand ever so slightly, Neville’s mouth quivers open, like he's about to say something, before he gives out and falls over from the knees. It's only when his head hits the ground that I notice the edges of his hair whitening.
to live then, do you? You want you and everyone you know and love to die? Because in the end he won't spare you, be sure. Not now. Not after what you've done. Running off with a couple of rebels now, are you?”
“Harry move out of the way, he's a bloody death eater!” Remus pulls out his wand and points it at Malfoy’s now fully blond head, “Probably the one that cursed them too, huh? Cru-”
. I really hope you liked this, please leave a kudos and a comment if you did. Seriously, any comment! Even if you hated it! Tell me! (Okay maybe not that lol)
I shake my head, my eyes falling to the floor, “No. I can't do that. I barely let Ron and Hermione come along and Molly would never allow it. Besides, you've got Hogwarts.”
Draco smirked against Potter’s mouth in satisfaction, only for Potter to take advantage of his distraction by nipping at Draco’s bottom lip. Draco let out an exhalation of breath at the sensation, his mind going blank for a moment. Potter gripped Draco’s hair tighter, enjoying the effects, and nipped at Draco’s lip again.
Remus hunches over Hagrid’s unconscious figure, a deep red, web-like net of spells spilling from his wand. “We were attacked. I'm not sure how they found us. Someone must have told them we’d be moving Harry.”
“What do you mean?” His voice sounds a little higher with this, “How can you expect more! I’ve been planning to kill you!”
A full minute passes after the front door falls closed and I realize that I haven't moved an inch. Weasley sniggers in a derisory fashion, his girlfriend scowling openly at me.
“Malfoy boy, eh? What’re you doing so far from home?” the man asks in a  the man asks in a gruff voice, ignoring the fact that Malfoy clearly can’t answer with the tight fist around his throat.
“What's the plan now?” Ron asks, fidgeting with the end of his shirt. I can see the absence of his family getting to him already, maybe I'm the only one.
“The cupboard!” she exclaims, hand flying to her mouth. “That’s where I’ve seen it before! The real locket of Slytherin!”
Hagrid rouses and I stoop to his side, brushing the fringe from his forehead. Remus rises off his bent knees, addressing Arthur darkly.
“Hey watch it!” I hiss, pushing him back, but he hardly pays me attention. His and Weasley’s eyes are glued to Granger as she paces the floor, on the brink of discovery.
Harry rolled his eyes. “I don’t know why you’re making fun of me when you’ve already been through this.”
“I’m not your partner Potter,” Draco spat. “Your problems are not my problems so why would I pay attention to them?” Typical. He just lost the man and was full of regrets about the way he had always acted towards him and now that he actually had a chance to see him again he went straight back to being a jerk. Yup. Typical. Draco buried his head in his hands. When the other wizard didn’t have any snarky reply he lifted his head back up to look at him. He had grabbed one of the books and had it open at its index. Draco moved his butter chicken around in his plate.
He took another swig of the Firewhiskey. And another. He got up and stumbled to the couch. He drank at an alarming speed, enjoying the way the alcohol was fuzzing his mind. “Harry…”, he cried to the empty room.
Hermione nodded, a little exhausted from having put her best friend through a panic attack. “Did it work?” she asked.
He was torn between running down the stairs and creeping down slowly, not sure which action would ensure his hallucination didn’t disappear.
“Harry dies,” Draco blurted out. Didn’t matter how many times he had to say, it didn’t seem to ever get easier. Every time he said it the pain in his heart felt fresh again. Would the wound ever heal?
Harry shrugged and grabbed the bottle of Firewhiskey. He took two glasses and made his way to one of the lounge chairs. Draco took a seat in the opposite one as Harry poured the liquor.
“NO!” Whatever this was, Harry was alive. Draco was worried about doing anything that might change that. Maybe he had hit his head and the healers would fix him and Harry would be gone again. Living with a hallucination of Harry was better than no Harry at all.
“Six years,” Draco provided. “Harry tells me you returned your parents’ memories after the war without having to use torture so we were hoping you would be able to do the same for yourselves.” He looked hopeful but that changed when he saw Hermione slouch her shoulders.
The next morning, Draco woke up before Harry. Feeling like his heart was shattering, he got up without waking his lover and made his way to the shower. He sat on the tiled floor as the warm water washed over him, mixing itself with his tears. He bit his hand trying to hide his sobs. He didn’t want to wake Harry up. He didn’t want Harry to see exactly how heart broken he was. He had no regrets over anything that had transpired these past few days but the thought of it ending was a cataclysm of sorrow.
“There’s nothing much to tell. One relationship lasted 7 months and the next one was about a year. They both ended because the guys were way too into…well…” Draco gestured towards his arm that bared the dark mark under his shirt.
“How daft are you? Isn’t it obvious that her mother may have actually died and this witch may have actually gone back in time and saved her? Causing her to go mad with the memory of her mom dying conflicting with the new memory of her mom being saved?”
“Draco?”, the soft voice pulled him from his thoughts. He looked up from the headstone to see a puffy eyed Ginny looking at him. “Draco, we’re going back to the Burrow for tea. We have the portkeys waiting.”
Harry leaned back to look into Draco’s eyes. He saw kindness and concern. He saw tenderness and love. He pressed his forehead to Draco’s. Hermione felt like she was intruding on an important moment, so she quietly got up to leave.
“We decided the best course of action was to obliviate you in order to make sure you wouldn’t go mad with the knowledge of your death.”
“I’m sorry I can’t go get it myself. It sounds like you’ve had a long day.” Draco did feel kind of useless being stuck inside all day.
Before Neville could express any other kind of platitude Draco got up. He looked at Molly and considered saying good bye but couldn’t muster it…again failing to find courage.
Draco perked himself up on an elbow. “No. Honestly no. I know there’s a lot of biphobics out there who spew bullshit about the person not being able to choose and always going to want the opposite sex but I don’t believe in that. You love who you want to love and if you choose to love me then I trust that you’re not going to ditch me for a chick. Plus, I’ll keep you so satisfied in bed you’re not going to want or need anyone else.” Draco wiggle his eyebrows making Harry laughed. Draco loved that sound and enjoyed being the reason behind it. He settled back down and snuggled back up.
“I know but I’ve dealt with it and grown. I’ve accepted the death of my parents and made peace with it. They’ll always be with me even if their gone. I’ve realized I am not like Voldermort even though I ended up with part of his soul.” Ron and Draco made a face at the use of the name.
Harry’s breathing went back to normal gradually. Draco didn’t press him, taking his time reminding him to take deep breaths in and out. Once his breathing was semi-steady, Harry twisted around to nuzzle his head in the crook of Draco’s neck.
“Didn’t have the time, sorry. Got called on a nasty case. There’s something causing blackouts in East Lothian, up in Scotland. Would be a muggle problem if it wasn’t for the fact that everyone seems to be stupefied during the black out and not everyone is waking up from it. Now we have a bunch of wizards in comas. You wouldn’t happen to remember anything about it from your past would you?”
“Yeah I get it, you’re a man of honour. I’ll unlock my floo so you can go to his place if you’re up for doing it now?”
After the war things had been awkward as expected but the animosity seemed to have dissolved itself. They had been through too much pain to hold on to petty school rivalries.
Draco breathed in. “There you go being brave again.” This didn’t stop him from getting up anyways. He stood in front of Harry and licked his lips. This was probably a bad idea.
“Me? I did nothing wrong! I was minding my own business prepping some tea when current you showed up and I didn’t know how to act cause all I could think of was kissing you so I got all clumsy and spilled my damn tea. You then felt like declaring that I really needed to learn to use my hands. You said I wasn’t able to do so in first year when I almost swallowed the snitch and clearly still hadn’t figured out how hands work to this day. Arse.”
“It’s from the restricted section. You can only take out a book at a time and tome 7 has the T section so I figured it was a good bet.”
Draco didn’t say anything else. Leaving the books on the table, he dragged himself out of the room and up the stairs.
Hermione nodded. “Well promise me Draco, when you get back, you’ll come to me and make sure we become good friends, ok?”
“Do you think I enjoy being stuck here with you? This is the longest time we’ve spent around each other alone.”
“Not true.” A third glass was poured. “I avoided telling you how I felt about you by fear of rejection. Seemingly, I avoid it for the rest of my life.”
“Are you sure?” Harry asked. “What if…what if this affects you in the future? This is a pretty big deal.”
While Harry was on his mission at the Ministry, Hermione and Draco were sitting alone together at Grimmauld place.
Draco nodded. This was probably for the best. This way he could make sure there really was nothing found and he wouldn’t have to worry about it.
“My turn,” Harry declared. “If you were on a desert island with no magic and all the food and water you needed, what three things would you want with you?”
“Yes, here you go.” Harry handed it to her. “Look Cho, about what happened back at Hogwarts, it’s in the past right?”
Draco pursed his lips remembering that, yes, Harry Potter was dead. He had watched as his body had been thrown across the room and hit a cement wall with a particular crunch. He shook his head to clear his thoughts from the memory. He returned his attention to the book and read. The chapter was actually, and thankfully, quite detailed. Stating the rules and explaining why exactly one should abide by them.
“How things were?” Oh and there it was. An emotion. “What do you mean how things were? There were no things.” Anger. Yes. Good. Anger was a good emotion. Draco was familiar with anger. This he could handle.
“Hermione, genius once again!” Harry smiled, ecstatic at her idea. “Ok, I’ll go get the items needed for the potion. Don’t take this the wrong way, either of you, but I think I’m the one who should make it. I have a few tricks up my sleeve when it comes to potions.”
“No, no why would we, you’re bloody Harry Potter.” She was in clear awe of the man standing in front of her. “Right, Time-Turner. Right this way.” She grabbed her wand and turned towards the next door. She did the altered version of Alohomora that would open this specific door. When it did, Harry snuck up behind her and hit her with Confundus. He had the decency to feel a bit bad about it.
Knowing exactly why Harry was giving him that option, worried that their outing might make the papers if they were caught in any type of embrace, Draco conceding to going to a muggle pub.
What was causing the headache seemed to be the fact that he now had a conflicting memory regarding that day. Ron had cried out boggart but instead of casting Riddikulus, he heard Harry cast Stupefy. This time, Draco had rushed into the room to see the spider wobbling in place, frozen. They had continued their search of the house and even though there had been a few more nasty beasts and they had endured some cuts and bruises, everything had been secured by the end of the day and everyone went home alive.
Instead of going away, Harry joined Draco under the falling water. He sat behind him, a tight fit but they made it work. He wrapped his arms around and simply let Draco cry. Harry felt like he should be crying to. For the loss of his love and the loss of his own life. He was too much in a state of shock to let the emotions take over. It all felt surreal to him. He had missed a lot of work which meant that he never really had to face his Draco. It would be so easy to go up to him and tell him how he felt but after forgetting all this, he would go back to being sort of friends with the snarky prat and believing he would never be loved back by him. Harry held Draco tighter.
“No last words, ok?” he pleaded. Harry nodded silently. If this was Draco’s last wish, he would grant him that.
“Shut up! Just shut up!”, the red head was yelling. “Everyone needs to stop telling me it wasn’t my fault! I don’t want to hear it! He was my best mate! I was his partner! IT WAS MY JOB TO PROCTECT HIM!” Ron’s voice cracked as a sob took hold of him. He grabbed a hold of his hair and shut his eyes tight before reopening them and running out of the room.
When his feet hit the ground, he took a minute to will his head to stop spinning. He saw there was a light on. He had expected the flat to be empty now that its sole resident had passed. Maybe someone else had the same idea of coming over.
Now, when it comes to itemless time travel, countless wizards have tried only to stand there looking foolish as nothing happens.
“For years I wondered what it meant until the day in question came along. That was you? You saved my life!”
“I have to be honest…I don’t really do the dating thing a lot…don’t get me wrong I have hook ups, I’m no saint! But relationships, I haven’t really been lucky in that field. I’ve only been in two that could be considered sort of long term.” Draco wasn’t sure why he was admitting this.
“Fishing for compliments are ya! This is going to sound like such a cop out but I don’t know if I could pin point it to just one thing…you’re beautiful. Gotta say though I am pleasantly surprised to see those abs you’ve been hiding.” Harry winked. Draco blushed slightly…he worked out hard for those abs!
“’Mione,” Harry spoke softly. “Draco is from the future. We don’t know how he ended up here since he didn’t use a Time-Turner which is why we need your help. Because of the sensitive nature of time travel, we’ve decided it’s best to obliviate my memories from this encounter to protect Draco from returning to a different future. This is why we also feel that we should obliviate you, once you get all the information. We’re hoping you agree to help us.”
“I know that we’ve all worked really hard to get me back to my time. Is it ok if I have one more night here?”
“You two are going to look into what happened to it. I want to know where it went, who took it, where they went and why it’s not working anymore,” Robards ordered.
This was it. Moment of truth. He grabbed the Time-Turner. Nothing happened. He left the room and closed the door. He gave Snow White her wand back and lifted the Confundus course.
“I like being told I’m a good boy,” Draco rushed out. Harry’s eyes went wide and a wicked grin settle on his face.
If he thought about it, he would have guessed that he had been invited to the private saying of good bye because, over the years, he had become friends with the people currently surrounding him. He had even been invited to some of the Weasley’s Sunday dinners…mainly because Mrs. Weasley once found out that he eats alone at home 98% of his nights and this just hadn’t been acceptable. So yeah, Draco had entered the group of friends that surrounded Harry Potter.
“Ok, well, date me? Marry me? Adopt kids with me? We can call the first one Albus as long as we call the second one Scorpius.”
It was Harry’s turn to initiate the kiss, making a small moan escape from Draco’s lips. The snogging session was moved to the living room where Harry ended up on top of Draco on the sofa. He eventually came up for air, sitting up and straddling Malfoy.
Draco blinked as the realization of what Harry had said settled in. A gentle smile settled on his face as he approached Harry again, going in for a second kiss.
“We’re not married. There is something happening with me and past/present/whatever you want to call it Harry. We kind of admitted our feelings for each other but it doesn’t matter. He’s going to forget it all and nothing will ever happen.” Draco bit his lip focusing on the physical pain instead of the emotional one.
“Hermione, you figured out how to make a Time-Turner go forward. I believe you can do this,” Draco encouraged.
“Before we go off, can we talk about the fact that Harry dies? How do we fix that?” Hermione needed to know.
Draco shrugged. “You saved my life in the Room of Requirements during the war so I guess that makes us even.”
Harry actually looked a bit hurt by that but didn’t voice anything. Instead he asked Draco if he had found anything in the books. Draco told him about Mary-Winkle.
“Well, it’s not like we can do anything and thinking about it might drive ME mad,” Harry all but yelled.
Draco remembered how much it hurt to gain new memories once he was back so he could sympathise. “I’m not interested in having either of you tortured,” he told Harry and Hermione.
“Oh…honestly I like that. This means we can experience it for the first time together.” He got up for the sofa and extended his hand to Draco who took it and got up as well.
“I’m so right aren’t I!” It was Draco’s turn to laugh. He reached over Harry and grabbed his cup for a sip of tea.
Draco let him inside so Harry could disapparate without being seen. Once the man had disappeared Draco took a seat on his couch. Ok. This was happening. This was good. What if he messed this up? No. No negative thoughts. He bounced his knee up and down until he couldn’t take sitting still anymore and got up to pace.
When he went down to the living room, no one was in sight. He found his way to the kitchen where a note was sitting on the table.
“I wish I could go to the you of my now. I don’t like knowing you spend six more years hating yourself, thinking you’re not good enough and that you have to hide.”
It had never occurred to Draco that after six years, it would be possible that Harry had gotten over him and no longer wanted him. This thought, however, was now hitting him hard as he didn’t feel Harry respond to the kiss. He pulled away, horrified.
Harry took a couple of sips in a row. “Maybe we should obliviate me,” he proposed. “I don’t really like knowing that I’m going to die.”
Harry sat down at the table and idly played with the books that were still sitting there. “Too bad we can’t just use the Time-Turner to go into the future.”
For the rest of the week, Harry and Draco spent all their free time together. This caused them to get a lot of quizzical looks at work but everyone seemed too polite to ask what was going on.
“Open your mouth and I’ll administer the Veritaserum.” Harry obliged and Hermione let a couple of drops fall onto his tongue. She handed the vile back to Draco. She took out another from her pocket and gave Harry one small drop of it. She sat down. She took a deep breath and started
“Fine. Island with no magic.” Draco gave it a thought. “You know, it’s occurring to me that I rely on magic a lot. I have no idea how I would survive in a muggle world. Are you an option? Can it be me and you on the island? That would be ok I guess.”
Harry sat alone in his kitchen. Hermione had taken Draco to the isolated field she had chosen for him to time travel in. They had decided that it was best for them to loose their memories somewhere familiar instead of them finding themselves in a field and confused…less questions that way.
Draco nodded. Hermione approached him, wand out and pointed at the Time-Turner. She inhaled deeply, “I do hope this works. Semper Prorsum Temps Annorum.” Aquamarine sparks came out of her wand and circled the Time-Turner before disappearing. “Well, that was it.” She lowered her wand.
“Go to work? Are you daft? I just told you that you died and that I’m from the future and you’re going to just go off to work!”
I peek into Ron’s doorway. Malfoy sits a few feet away from Hermione, running his left palm up his arm nervously.
, I think. Still, I nod and respond, “We’ll find a way to get back into the castle soon,” but Dumbledore looses balance and slumps onto the ground.
Instinctively I pull away from her sympathetic touch- that awful pitying gaze- scratching the palm of my hand obsessively.
“You'll blend in with everyone else just fine now. Go outside and helps set up, we’ll be down in a minute.”
Potter presses his wand into the center of my chest; it stings. Granger and Weasley stand to the side with doubtful expressions on their face, probably wondering whether or not they should intervene. I can imagine they have to do so often. I want to laugh.
“Yeah well, here’s the reality of it: not everyone is going to be okay and safe.” I laugh scornfully. “We might as well sleep at some point because safe is a long way off. Dumbledore might have tried to convince us that this is all well and good, but we’re on their own in this.” I notice my voice raising volume.
Malfoy sees it as well and seems drawn to his portrait, or what's left of it. Strokes of chipped white paint dust the top of the char over Malfoy’s face. ‘Draco Lucius Malfoy’ the wall announces in all its burnt glory.
The trip from number 4 to the Burrow, from what I saw, didn't go as planned. I remember thinking, for a moment, that this might actually be the end as Voldemort appeared out of a cloud of smoke and Hedwig fell from the sky.
My hand searches Dumbledore’s neckline surreptitiously as I fix myself to stand, then slipping a chain into the pocket of my robes, and pull out my wand, raising it to the moon in consequence. The magic of a thousand wands light up the sky, the stark white chasing away the fading green, as another star joins the constellations.
“Do you really believe that selfish elf would let the likes of you do away with anything of his?” I interject. Once again their eyes are on me; I shrug away the feeling of anxiety that comes with this.
“I packed days ahead. I was hoping we wouldn't need it, but...” Granger mutters as she digs around in her pouch.
His eyes are wild and desperate, and my mind strays from our immediate danger for a moment. I know how it feels to be caught wandless in a dire situation.
“Am I supposed to believe you? I know you’d kill me if you had the chance, Granger. So sorry if that hurts your delicate sensibilities.”
I stand and face Ron and Hermione’s exasperatedly knowing looks, “If you two are coming with me, then so is he.”
Malfoy laughs, cold and harsh, “He’s not working for you. He’s a spy. He’s working for the Dark Lord.”
Suddenly, I can move again, but I can’t will myself to. The space where my heart is supposed to be feels like a black hole; empty and all-consuming. In my head I can hear the last words he ever spoke to me.
I cut her off by nudging her lightly in the ribs with my elbow at the strange look on Malfoy’s ashen face as the words shiver through him. She looks up at me, then over to Malfoy, and back to me. She raises an eyebrow at my apparent care, but nods and drops the issue without another word.
“I don't get it. We spent the summer here, you two down this very hallway. How could we not have seem -- or noticed,” Potter trails off. I look up to find him uncomfortably close, dark hair inches from my nose as he leans over Granger’s shoulder.
“Harry what happened? We were worried you left with Malfoy,” Granger says. Well that's a stupid assumption, why would Potter ever do a thing like that?
As we kick off I can see Madame Rosmerta staring after us, an odd expression painting her face. Maybe it’s just the light, but I notice it all the same.
Unnoticed by the preoccupied wizards, Neville leaned over to Theo and said in a quiet, awed voice, “Did you
Lucius Malfoy is a shadow of his former self, with a patchy beard spreading down his throat and his thin, greasy hair so filthy it's yellow. His adam’s apple bops up and down as he wheezes, “My Lord,” but my bare foot hits his throat before the word's even finished.
Potter paused with his fists raised defensively, narrowing his eyes at the blonde boy before him. His brow furrowed.
The eighth years had collectively begun meeting once a month in the Room of Requirements with the excuse of promoting Inter-House Unity. Their real motivations were largely access to alcohol, and time away from their studies to spend with others who had gone through similar experiences during the war. Last year’s Seventh Years had faced the brunt of the Carrows’ attentions, as they had been subjected to and taught the very worst, most complex Dark Magic over the course of their partial year. Headmistress McGonagall undoubtedly knew about their activities, but she turned a blind eye – they were all of age and she seemed to understand that they needed this outlet.
Potter’s expression seemed to clear. As Potter opened his mouth to speak, Draco braced himself for rejection as though expecting a physical blow.
We get close enough to the castle that I can see the balcony of the Astronomy tower. I turn to make certain that Dumbledore is still beside me and hear him mumbling unintelligible words under his breath. As we get even closer, I see that it was a spell;
Considering the possibility that he was already dead and nothing worse could happen to him, he followed the notes orders and consumed the vial’s content.
“Harry, you said this was important, life or death! What’s going on? Draco? What are you doing here?”
He went to his pantry and got some chocolate. Feeling better after the first bite he figured his best course of action was to go to Grimmauld place to see if Harry was there and living. He rushed towards the floo and caught a hold of himself in the mirror. His hair was a disaster and for some reason his lip was bleeding. Had he bit down on it at some point? He needed to clean up and change his clothes. Couldn’t do what he was about to do while dressed for a funeral.
This continued on about how only idiots think they can do it. Bla, bla, bla. Draco took a breath before continuing his reading. Eventually an interesting name was mentioned. Mary-Winkle Desgrace. The author explained how he found an old parchment from 1879 that talked about this Desgrace character. She claimed to have time travelled one night, filled with grief over the death of her mother. Upon her supposed return, Desgrace told her family what she had done. Her erratic ramblings, accompanied with the fact that her mother had not actually died, had Mary-Winkle locked up and never heard from again.
This is why he had avoided telling Harry how he felt for so long. This pain of rejection. Knowing you put yourself out there and were denied affection. Oh Merlin! He had kissed Harry Potter who had not kissed him back. How was he ever going to face him again? Oh and of course Harry would tell all his friends. How they would laugh at poor, pathetic Draco. He needed to quit his job. Maybe move to France or Italy. Or even Canada.
“Oh! Oh boy. This arse had tipped off the Daily Prophet to our date so we got to the restaurant and none other than Rita Skeeter was there with her Quick-Quotes Quill. Any conversation I tried to have was twisted and written down. And of course my date loved it and wouldn’t shut up.”
Harry entered the room. This was to be the tricky part – finding the item. He took a deep breath and walked straight ahead then took a left. Letting the Liquid Luck do its thing he found himself face to face with the only Time-Turner known to the Ministry. He cast the spell to undo the security spells and hoped that having the right wand would do the trick.
“Back so soon? Couldn’t figure out your case and passed it on to a better auror?” Why did he keep being so mean?
“Hermione is going to do her research at the library and come back later,” Harry said as he returned from the market. “Most of what she needs is in the restricted section so it’s easier for her to stay there.” Harry took out his cauldron from the cabinet and placed it on the kitchen table. “Oh, I got us this.” He took out a piece of parchment from his robes and handed it to Draco.
Draco blinked. He definitely had a headache which was making it hard to understand what Harry was rambling about.
Draco couldn’t get over this new information. “So you’re telling me that you have the invisibility cloak, the resurrection stone and at some point you had the elder wand?”
