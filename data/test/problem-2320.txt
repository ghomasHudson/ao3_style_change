There was a snort and a chuckle from the two other adults. Than the elder Malfoy bowed his head and appereated out. Remus however dropped down on their couch, looking exhausted. Fred rushed to the kitchen and grabbed him a cup of tea.
“Oh it’s okay, Harry,” Hermione said condescendingly. “Talking about it will help. It would be good for you to get it out.” Harry slide his eyes over at her, trying not to glare at the way she was speaking to him. She had done it before, but he never really noticed how superior she sounded when she spoke to him. He looked to his right, Ron didn’t seem to care, he was just nodding his head to whatever she said while eating everything in sight. Harry sighed.
He shook his head, just like he did every night when she asked. He knew they were both worried about Draco, but why she thought, their friend would reach out to him and not her he didn’t understand.
“Well,” George said, “I’m surprised.” Blaise snorted then tried to cover his mouth to hide his laughter, but it seemed it was the right thing do because Remus chuckled.
“I’m kin, Dragon,” He explained quickly, letting his brother go to hug George who smiled at him. “What I don’t understand, is why your Azeban and I’m Kin.” He told them after he let George go.
He wondered if he should worry more about the other’s health. Because it was clear something was off. But he knew that if he brought it up, Potter would get angry probably say Draco didn’t really care and that he was just looking for information or a weakness. Which was only partially true, sure it would be good to learn more about the other teen, but he was also worried about Potter’s health. After all it wouldn’t do for its only companion in the past and the wizarding worlds only hope against the Dark Lord to die.
Fred tried to hold back the nervous energy that seared through him, but by the time George walked back into their living room, he was sitting up foot bouncing on the ground. George gave him a look and turned towards the kitchen. He appeared several minutes later with three cups of tea.
But out loud he said, “What article?” He saw Ron and Hermione look at each other. There was a flash of worry in the bushy brunette’s eyes before she turned to him.
Fred, who was still standing close enough to Remus to feel the wolf’s power react, took a step away. Because as much as he liked the man, standing next to an anger werewolf didn’t seem smart.
That most have been the wrong thing to do, because the other boy whimpered and tried to bury himself deeper in to Draco’s back. Unsure what to do, he tried to free himself from the other’s arms. He got as far and removing the arm before the smaller boy left out a soft whine. A wave of distress came off the Gryffindor and Draco found himself unwilling to force the other away again. So, he maneuvered himself on to his back, and the sleeping body next to him moved with him. They ended up with him on his back and Potter’s head on his chest.
“How about Diagon Alley, The Leaky Cauldron” Malfoy asked from behind him, “I need to get a school book,” The blonde lied, “Then we can send an owl to the headmaster.” The women frown at them, but nodded.
“Zabini,I am unavailable right now. Come back tomorrow.” His professor started to turn away, “Wait.” He called again, reaching out to grab the man’s arm. Not his smartest move. He felt the man pull his arm back, and looked up to see a surprised look on the Head of Slytherin face.
“Umm…” A quiet voice asked, causing both of them to look over at the stunning olive skinned Slytherin, Fred really wanted to get to know better. He was sure his brother would agree, “Kill who?” The both chuckled.
He looked around the room. Sirius and Remus were partnered up, as were his parents. Pettigrew sat alone, but Harry knew there wasn’t a chance in hell he would partner with the rat. So, instead he tried to find another empty seat. There was a table, behind Remus and Sirius that was unoccupied. He quickly rushed to take it, hoping that someone else would join him before the class started. He really didn’t want the teacher to put him and Peter together if they ended up being the last two singles.
He felt nervous as him and Fred walked into Gringotts. He could tell from the way his twin looked around that he wasn't the only one. They had tried figure out what the letter was about, but nothing came to mind. As they walked, their path was suddenly cut off by an older looking Goblin.
“I feel bad for him. He’s had a hard life and the pressure the world puts on his is wrong. He’s just a kid.”  Their brother lowered his head. Fred looked at George, wondering which of them was going to ask the next question. He could tell George really didn’t want to, so he took a deep breath and asked.
“Mister Ellis, your turn.” He nodded to the professor and sat on the stool. He tried not to show his panic as she lowered the hat on to his head.
Now it was his turn to lean back, with a huff of air, he started to talk, “Remember in third year, Hermione took just about very class possible?” The blonde nodded, a slight irritated look on his face. It almost made Harry smile, thinking about how pissed the Malfoy heir must have been to know that Hermione was showing him up again, then he remembered that she wasn’t the person he thought she was and the humor faded. “Well turns out she had a time turner.”
He crawled into the bed and slowly drifted off to sleep as Malfoy continued to read at the small table. At some point he was woken up by the blonde joining him in the bed. A gap of space between them, and then he went right back to sleep.
"I am not." The blonde spoke as it was beneath him to do such a thing and Remus had to bite the inside of his lip not to throw out a comeback Siri would be proud of. Instead he lowered his wand and waited.
The next week was peaceful. Blaise returned to Hogwarts and the Weasley’s returned to their homes. His godfather’s and Draco had given him space after his reading of the wills. He used that time to do some reading and having Bill retrieve the correct documents for him. It was easy to get Remus to sign the acceptance of custody paperwork though the wolf spent an hour reassuring Sirius it was temporary until he was cleared in which the animagus told him he was an idiot they were sharing custody. Harry had spent the entire hour in Draco’s lap laughing at the two men.
“Hogwarts.” Again, both him and Malfoy spoke at the same time, coming to the same conclusion. Grimmhook wanted them to go to Hogwarts.
“Harry and M--Draco.” His twin said, moving around him to sit on the couch facing Malfoy. The man nodded. Fred looked over his shoulder at him, his eyebrows raised,
“You think …we’re what?” Malfoy asked, spinning his spoon around in his bowl. The blonde didn’t take a bite, just seemed to need something to do.
They both handed them over and waited as the Goblin read them over. Harry sat there nervous because if the Goblin was satisfied with their answers they would be returning to Hogwarts in just a couple days and while he missed the school. It was the closest thing he had to a real home, he didn’t know how he would react to seeing his parents, their friends, Wormtail, or even the others like McGonagall or the headmaster.
“A letter.” He said standing up, “We write a letter and have the goblins hang on to it until the right time. The twins will get it and hopefully be able to help.” He exhaled, “We won’t know for sure until we try it on our end though.”
It wouldn’t kill him or Draco but it would help make it look like they had been held prisoners for over two months. It had taken Bill and Snape a week to brew and Harry wasn’t looking forward to drinking it.
He sighed, and used his wand to pull the treats away from his brother’s arm and sent them flying to the other side of the room.
He looked over at Malfoy and saw the other boy looked at him too. Something was off about this place.  He noticed Malfoy had his hand inside his robe, holding on to his wand and that he was watching the people around him.
“Homesick?” Lilly asked as she sat down next to Pettigrew. He looked up at her and something inside him broke. Watching his mother sit there next to the man who would betray her. He shoved his food away and rushed to his feet.
“Oh.” Harry said looking at Draco. His mate looked at him and it felt like they were both searching each other’s eyes to see how the other one was taking the news. Harry felt like a hole was forming in his chest as he thought about Draco might not want this.
“Maybe we should talk somewhere else.” He said and waited for Lucius to stand. He nodded and got up. Once they were outside he turned to the man, “We can not go the the manor.” Lupin scoffed, “I know a place. If I may?” He asked raising his hand leaving it hanging just about Lucius’s arm. He didn’t like it, everything in his told him not to go with a potential enemy somewhere unknown. But he trusted his son,  he nodded, not missing the surprise in the wolf's eyes.
The same James that might prank him now. They wouldn’t really? He tried to reason. After all he was new, he shouldn’t know about the hostilely among the different house. So, pranking him for not sitting next to Peter didn’t seem fair. Though nothing in his life ever was.
There was a brief smell of something like annoyance when Severus joined him at the table then anger but it quickly faded. Remus wondered if the kid just wanted to work alone. He didn’t seem to harbor and ill will towards Snape or other Slytherins, at least not yet. That would probably come the longer he was at the school.
“I don’t think we will understand, not until we can talk to them about it.” Charlie said, reaching out to take his trembling hand. Then Charlie took the potion and dripped two tiny drops into the cup, he put the top on bottle then grabbed the cup off the counter.
Severus was not avoid the headmaster, no matter what the old bat said. He just didn’t feel the need to spend his evening listening to another insane theory about what happened to the Potter brat and Draco. He sighed dropping down onto his armchair.
“Mr. Potter.” Grimmhook said, “You would not be able to attend as yourselves. We would have to give you fake names and a good reason to transfers schools.” The goblin reached down and picked up two pieces of paper, “Now the school year, starts in a week. So, take these and if you decided to attended to school, fill them out and owl them back as soon as possible.” He took the paper with shaking hands, without reading it, he followed it up and put it inside is robe.
New note (6/23/19): Does anyone on here draw? or know someone that does? I'm trying to find someone to help me with a fantasy map for an epic story I'm working on but as I'm currently broke, its damn near impossible. I was hoping to find someone who does it for fun and wouldn't mind helping me out. Please email me if you or someone else might be interested.
“Lucius, you would be taking on Our Lord, whom we have sworn loyalty to. He is violent and dangerous.” Lucius tried not to acknowledge the worrying feeling growing inside his chest.
He felt his eyes start to water and had to reach up and wipe the tears away with the sleeve of his robe.
“These are signed documents from Albus Dumbledore with withdrawals from Mister Potter’s vault. On them he has signed as Guardian, but the Wills you both have read, He is not in fact, Mister Potter’s Guardian.” George went to say something but the goblin held up his hand, “There are also large money transfers to Petunia Dursley, Vernon Dursley, Molly Weasley, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger. All signed off on by Dumbledore. There a few couple smaller transfers in the names of Ginny Weasley and Dudley Dursley.” The goblin handed them a small stack of papers.
Decided that since the blonde was paying, he didn’t really have a place to argue. So, he just let the blonde add what he wanted.
“You can get all of them.” The blonde said, raising from his seat, “That’s why I gave them to you.” His tone, implied that Harry was an idiot.
“For now, Draco and Harry be careful how you act around each other, if the Headmaster figures out Harry’s binding have broken and that not only has he emerged but bonded, I fear what he would do. Blaise please make sure they do.” Harry turned enough to see the Slytherin grin at his head of house.
“Is he truly innocent?” He couldn’t help but ask. He had heard the rumors about it, even about Pettigrew’s supposed involvement but the Dark Lord didn’t seem to want to fill anyone in on the details and it wasn’t like he could ask at the Ministry.
“Yes, Professor?” He asked stopping to turn and look at the man. His ears picked up his two friends sneaking off down the hallways. Cowards, he thought with no real heat.
He wasn’t aware he had stopped walking until a hand wrapped around his arm and he was tugged forward. He ripped his eyes away from his parents and snuck a quick look at Malfoy. The blonde’s face was smooth and neutral like nothing about this was affecting him at all, but the tight grip on Harry’s arm said otherwise.
“Potter.” He startled and looked up from the book he was currently reading, so far it only mentioned time turners but it was the first book he had come across that even mention time travel.
“You think he killed Potter?” Theo asked from his spot on the floor. Blaise looked up at him, to find the tall burnett was staring at him. Blaise wasn’t sure about Nott, while he counted him as a friend, his father’s allegiance to the Dark Lord was well known amongst the Slytherins and it made Blaise careful about what he did or said to around him.
He also talked to Remus and Siri about the Potter seats in the Wizengamot. That was a longer conversation, that the custody. In the end it was agreed that Remus would sit in Harry’s seat for as long as Harry wanted. Sirius would be too busy with his own seats once he was free.
He heard Snape snap out a ‘Stop’ and suddenly the whole class was paying attention to the back table. He wasn’t going to move at first but than a wave of warm vanilla hit him
GUYS!! I have finally published my first novel, Malevolence!! You can find it on Amazon kindle (and Kindle unlimited) under the name C.A. Human. Hopefully soon, I'll be able to get my second novel edited and published tooo. So excited.
Malfoy must have figured out that something was wrong because he raised his brow in a silent, what happened?
He heard one of them gasp, but he couldn’t place who it was. The silence in the room carried on for what felt like forever to him, and his already fast heartbeat raced faster as he started to panic.
“What if something went wrong?” He asked. He was debating telling Malfoy about Hermione time turner and the warning Dumbledore had given them. “or we needed more than one person’s help?’
“I also have a denial of custody form signed by Albus Dumbledore towards one Remus Lupin.” Fred felt a wave of sorrow for Harry and Remus, they had been denied a chance at a few happy years all because of the headmaster.
“He wouldn’t.” Luc said, straightening his shoulders. He wanted to reach out and shake the man, because it was killing him not knowing, but walking into something blindly just because he was worried was stupid.
He needed to talk to Sirius or James. They might have an idea about what was going on. His two friends weren't hard to find once he entered the Great Hall. James was flirting with Lilly or for her part looked a little bored, but she kept smiling at James. Remus knew it was an act. Every time the redhead acted a little bored with his friend, his friend would do something outrages to get her attention. He shook his head and felt himself calm down a little at the familiarity of the room.
“I can apparate us to the Twins. I have been there before.” Lupin asked, not noticing his frustrated mood. He nodded and moved closer to the wolf. Lupin gave him a strange look, like he didn’t believe this was real. A feeling Lucius understood all to well.
He watched as one of the Weasley twins knelt down over the box. He felt worried as the young man handed out letters to everyone in their small group. He had to will his hands not to shake as he took his.
“Ye…” He started as he turned to again thank whoever it was. But the air in his lungs disappeared because he knew that face. It was younger less tired, less sad but he knew that face.
“A couple months ago,” Bill started, “I caught Mum and Ron talking at an Order meeting. He was complaining about something and asked her if Dumbledore would fix it. She saw me walking in and shushed him. I tried later to ask him what it was about but he just shrugged me off.” Bill frowned, “It gave me a weird feeling.”
Please take the time to read this. As you might have noticed in previous notes, I have finally self published my first novel, Malevolence, ( found on amazon and kindle unlimited). But I used all my money to do so, paying an editor and cover artist, even borrowed some from my parents. Now that the book is out I'm having a hard time building a following, gaining readers and fans alike. I have spent a ridiculous amount of time making an Author's Facebook, (links to all of these are on my profile page), an Instagram, a twitter (which I still can't figure out), tumblr
Then the professor entered the class room and Harry knew he was stuck. The Professor, Slughorn or something of the like, walked up to the board and started writing out instructions. The man turned once down, eyes roaming over the class. His gaze stopped on Harry and Snape and the man seemed confused but didn’t say anything.
“Good morning.” The panic in the green eyes made him chuckle, especially when the other teen realized he was still half pressed again him. His cheeks turned red and he mumbled something before jumping off the bed and running into the bathroom.
Black cursed, “This is my fault. I told him not to trust that old coot.” Lucius leaned forward curious as to why, but Lupin smacked his friend upside the back of his head. “You didn’t send Harry off, Merlin knows where. Now please go make lunch.” Black groaned but got up.
“Of course we are.” He said grinning at his brother.Whatever this was, it seemed like it might be interesting
“Then we will kill him,” Lucius said, feeling one hundred percent certain that if the time came he could kill the man he once swore to follow. It would hurt, as he once viewed Tom as a friend but that was a long time ago. Somewhere along the years he went from Tom to Voldemort to my Lord, that distance would save him from him from feeling any guilt, afterall if it was between Tom Riddle and his son, Lucius Malfoy would always choose his son.
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be working. So, today I created a mailing list and posted a link on my fb, twitter, and tumblr. It's my hope that those of you that like my writing, that like Urban fantasy, or M/M/M shifter (as that's the next to be published when I have the funds) books will go check it out, and join it. Or possible go to amazon and buy or read my book, share it, hopefully even recommend it to friends. This is my last hope to spread the word and start getting readers.
He saw the twins look at each other and nod, before they to joined them inside the circle. Severus wondered what they were doing here.
Harry snorted. Malfoy in his own way was trying to help. He sent someone he knew Harry trusted to talk to him. It was strangely nice of the pureblood but also not what he needed at the moment.
Remus sighed, wondering if this was a new rumor or joke going around about him. He wouldn’t doubt it and he would even bet it was his friends saying it.
When his eyes started to hurt from reading, he put the book down and looked at the bed, then at the bathroom. It had been in the back of his mind all day that there was only a single bed in the room and that at some point, they would either fight over who got it or ended up sharing it. It wasn’t really sure which he preferred, but he knew he didn’t want to sleep on the floor.
Something close to him was shaking. At least that’s what his half-asleep brain told him, so he went to roll over, but was forced to stop by the weight of a body pressed against him. He opened his eyes and turned his head, Potter had his face buried into his back and an arm and leg thrown over him.
Harry kept it extremely casual but couldn’t stop himself from little things like physically being close to Malfoy. The blond let him, which made him extremely happy. They had casually gone out a few times, making the gossip mill speculate on whether they were going out or not. Malfoy would sneer at the more pushy reporters while politely telling the nicer reporters that they were just checking Harry’s progress to see if he could physically be around people. He then plugged his physiotherapy business, which was not what the reporters wanted. There was always still a tiny write up about it but it wasn’t front page news.
Malfoy had been more gentle than Harry thought he would be when he told Harry that he did not date nor fraternize with his clients. He also said that if Harry was still interested after his therapy and recovery were completed then to ask again. Harry had still kept his face hidden but he was grinning. Malfoy had then lightly smacked him and barked at him to get back to exercising.
“Oh never mind Harry. Keep it for your next committee meeting.” Draco said tiredly as he headed to the dining room. Harry followed after.
“Thank you?” Hermione asked. “Don’t forget you speak at the junior assembly at the Hotel McGonagall.”
“I’m going to trust my mother when it comes to being fashionable more than you.” Draco said. Harry pouted.
“I’m sorry, Harry. He’s being very insistent that he speaks to you.” Hermione said sounding annoyed. Harry sighed but stood up to follow Hermione out. Draco frowned as they walked out.
A handsome, well dressed man is strolling the snow covered streets. The traffic is heavy but the foot traffic is even heavier in the city. It was only a few days until Christmas.
“I would have never guessed.” Hermione said sarcastically. Harry pouted at them but didn’t negate that fact. He just wrapped both his arms around Draco instead.
“Scor, you’ve been looking forward to this camping trip since you came home from school.” Draco said.
“Oi Harry.” Seamus Finnegan got their attention. The bubble of happiness Harry was in started to turn into trepidation when he turned to see most of the table staring at them.
“Oh yes, of course.” Harry agreed flatly. He glanced at the clock and kissed the blond, then stood up.
“Yes, well, more like acquaintances. They’re part of the committee to get the building up and running.” Draco explained. Fleur approached them to give them menus.
Harry would have tackled the blond in a hug but Draco held his left hand out expectantly palm down. It took a raised eyebrow and a pointed look at the box to get the hint. Harry took the white gold ring out of the box and slipped it on Draco’s ring finger. He looked at the blond as he lifted the hand up and kissed the knuckle. Draco looked like he was about to cry. He let the hand go and pulled the blond to him. Draco let out a watery laugh as he kissed Harry. He held the blond’s face, wiping the tears of joy away, as they kissed and smiled against each other.
Narcissa sighed delicately as she looked up from her book. She felt a minute shift in the wards that could have signaled a small creature, if she was ignorant. She knew the “slight” disturbance was heading towards her son’s room. She thought about what she should do.
“Harry is grounded! James told me he made that clear to our son!” Lily ranted. “Apparently not clear enough! Since James is conveniently out with the boys and my son, and his supposedly under lock and key, broom are gone!” She panted and then pitched her voice low in a mockery of James’, “These lock charms are impervious, love.”
“I expect you both to be presentable for dinner.” Narcissa said as she started to leave. Before she shut the door she added, “Use contraception.”
“So you know him?” Remus asked getting a nod from Draco. “In that case why don’t you two stop by my humble abode for some Yuletide cheer?”
“I wonder what Harry requested.” Hermione asked. She didn’t bother to read the rest of the letter since it just restated the ban that had been placed on the trio.
“Hey.” Harry said softly as he nuzzled Draco’s neck. He started lightly kissing the blond’s neck and only stopped when he got an annoyed smack. “I love you.”
“Ah Mr. Potter. Right on time. Simone will take your coats.” The man said as a smartly dressed house elf appeared. Draco turned slightly after giving Harry a look. Harry took the blond’s coat off for him and handed it to the elf. Draco did the same for him. “Please follow me, gentlemen.”
“Poor man, he said he had so much work to do. Harry, you must let him rest.” Minerva said imploringly.
“Don’t you see as an angel it’s quite possible that I could destroy you with a bolt of lightning.” Blaise said crossing his arms.
“Who made this?” Draco asked. It didn’t look like anything the elves would make. His mother ordered them to err on the side of healthy.
“What?” Harry asked flabbergasted as the seat stayed firmly attached to him even when he wiggled. He looked at Mrs. McGonagall who looked surprised and called out for her butler.
“I was thinking more of the times when I managed to sneak into your room.” Lucius said dryly earning a laugh from his wife.
“You see, we’re everywhere, helping people who deserve to be...” The man said but got distracted as he looked down at the picture of Draco. “To be helped.” He finished. “There are many people in the city walking around that you might look at one of them. It could either be the face of a murderer or the face of an angel.”
“Your tree will be delivered Christmas Eve.” Severus said turning his attention to Draco and handing him a slip of paper.
“Let’s go down and drink some. Let’s drink to us. To our happiness. To our many years together and forever. Then let’s smash the glasses in the fireplace.” Harry said.
“Of course.” Draco said as he headed to the front door. Luna helped them put their overcoats on and opened the door for them.
“Very much so.” Draco said. “In fact,” Draco walked over and lifted the hem of his robe up as he straddled Harry’s lap. He then grabbed one of Harry’s hands and placed it on his leg under the robe. His bare naked leg. “How about I show you how much I like?”
“On a chain around my neck? On my right ring finger as a promise ring?” Draco listed. Harry frowned deeply.
“Running errands. I want you all to get home, dried, and warm.” Draco said as he kissed the top of each boy’s head.
“Until you say you have no further need of me. Then I’ll be gone and forgotten.” Blaise explained. “Anyway, Draco is waiting. Go to the dining table.”
“Nothing says finality like making a toast, drinking your drink, then smashing the glasses. No take backs.” Harry said cheekily.
“Hence the not abysmal.” Draco said amused. Blaise chuckled as he helped Draco out of his overcoat and boots.
The blond man approached a shop with many Christmas trees outside. It was typically a florist/herb shop but for the holidays it was the go-to place for the freshest Christmas trees. The blond looked around, inspecting each tree, until he found the perfect one. He walked in the shop and raised an eyebrow at the scene before him.
Without straightening his appearance he quickly walked into the room. He stopped short at seeing Harry standing a few feet from the door with his hands behind his back. Draco quickly shut the door and activated the wards that made this room their safe place.
“You don’t have to explain. This is the way it is and this is the way it will always be. We’ve just got to get used to it.” Draco said spitefully. “I’ll tell Luna she can have the day off to Christmas shop while I take the kids out.”
“Well tell the boys all about him. James is trying to convince the younger ones that Santa isn’t real. I’d like for them to believe for as long as possible.” Draco said.
“The fact that I’m letting you lead me somewhere with my eyes shut is amazing. Can I open them now?” Draco asked as Harry led him down a street after apparating. He told the blond to shut his eyes as he led him to the restaurant and was surprised when Draco did.
The room was once more empty. Harry walked to the middle and looked around but Blaise was nowhere. Harry ran his hand through his hair erratically as he walked out of the office to join Draco.
“They’re your little brothers.” Draco pointed out. “They look up to you and just want to play with you. You’re never too old to play with anyone.”
“It’s Mr. Shacklebot, you see. And then a board meeting and then...” Harry started rambling and glanced over as Blaise got closer to them. “Then the junior assembly.”
Mrs. McGonagall stared at him for a few seconds but then smiled and finally left the room. The butler smiled in amazement at Blaise and then quickly straightened his facial features. He quickly followed Mrs. McGonagall out.
“Maybe I wanted to start a new tradition with you alone.” Harry said. “And everyone but you knows where I’m taking you tonight.”
“Draco, don’t be flippant about this!” Harry said harshly. Draco quickly turned to look at Harry with a frown. Harry shut his eyes and opened them again looking apologetic.
“Hmm, no. I’ll walk.” Draco said. After a few more moments of hugging Harry he let go and elegantly fell on the couch. Harry shook his head.
He turned once more and walked over to the alcove with blank parchment, quills, and ink. He grabbed the parchment, inked his quill, and tried to pen a professional sounding and looking note. It may have come off a bit threatening but it got the point across. He found a school owl and pet it while gently telling the owl where to deliver the letter.
“Scorpius.” His father said happily as he walked toward him. Scorpius was a little surprised to see him looking slightly disheveled, as if he had just rolled out of bed. Mr. Potter appeared behind them, wearing the clothes that he had on yesterday.
“I don’t care! Draco means more to me than my life! I’m not going to lose him!” Harry said vehemently. Blaise’s eyes lit up as he smiled.
Draco once more carefully unwrapped the paper and set it and the bow off to the side. With Harry’s help he got the top of the box open and audibly gasped at what he saw. Harry pulled the display box out of the gift box so Draco could see it better.
“You know this just confirms the rumor about you three being in a three way relationship.” Neville said teasingly. That made all three of them start laughing.
He ignored the indignant squawk from Harry as he turned to grab his wand. He smirked in amusement as he heard Harry fall off the bed. He summoned his shirt, checked the time, and fixed his hair by the time Harry wrapped his arms around him.
Draco ran his thumb over the engraving then made a small sound of disgust as he smudged the silver. He tried to buff it out with his shirt but it wasn’t working. Harry moved the tissue out of the way and pulled out a soft polishing cloth, included with the ornament. Draco polished the ornament and then stood up to put it on the tree, holding it in the polishing cloth.
Blaise looked at the cards in his hand and headed back into the office. He glanced out the office window and then walked back to the card catalogue. He tossed the cards into the air and instead of them scattering they hovered above the catalogue. Blaise waved his hands and pointed out where certain cards were supposed to go. He finished organizing in five seconds flat.
“Ron!” Harry said loudly in the quiet of the common room getting everyone’s attention. He hunched down a little but perked up when Ron immediately stood up to head over to him.
Harry apparated them outside the Weasley’s property since they had plenty of protected area to fly, thanks to Ginny’s Quidditch career. Even though it was freezing, flying warmed them up. They played a few rounds of seeker catch but had to end it when they lost the light. Harry debated on whether he should apparate them back to London or just crash at the Weasley’s. He was tired from flying and London was a long way to apparate.
Ron lightly struggled but started smiling at his laughing friends. Someone knocked rapidly on the door, prompting Hermione to drop the spells. Neville walked in and looked at them in amusement.
“Your black trousers and white button up would have worked.” Harry said. Draco narrowed his eyes at him. “What?”
“I can’t thank you enough for sending him to me.” Minerva gushed as she gestured for them to sit. “Meeting Blaise has been the greatest spiritual experience of my life.”
Harry headed up the stairs and opened James’ door first. His room was dark and he seemed to be sleeping fitfully so Harry quietly shut the door. He headed to Albus’ room next. He opened the door and Al looked up at him from his messaging parchment. It looked like the boy had some clay or mud smeared on his neck.
“With pleasure.” Harry said as he got off the bed and walked over to the blond. He then hefted Draco over his shoulder, getting an undignified squawk, walked back over to the bed, and gently dropped the blond on the bed. Draco looked at him so disgruntled.
“Ah then I have news for you. I’m going.” Blaise said as he walked into Harry’s office, Harry following him.
“Oh darling, there would be so much fewer men if that worked.” Narcissa said highly amused. “Let me guess, James said he’d follow through but didn’t.”
“It’s not a game. It’s a battle! They defend the fortress while we try to take it over.” The kid said.
“No! I am daft. I’ve been daft from the very start!” Harry said vehemently. He was starting to get worked up but calmed down when Draco grabbed his face and made him look him in the eye.
He walked into the room, taking his jacket off, and then throwing it on the closest table. He then squared up and stared Blaise down. Blaise watched him the whole time but didn’t say anything.
“Nothing! I just...” Draco sniffed and rubbed at the corner of his eye while not looking at Harry. “I just love it. Thank you.”
“Hermione.” Hermione jumped at the sound of Harry calling her. He jogged to catch up with her. “Sorry.”
“I meant as your fiancé.” Hermione said then in a gentler tone, “I know you love him, and I trust your judgement, but I still want to make sure he’s not out to hurt you.”
“Best Christmas.” Draco said with a content sigh. “Although, there is one thing that would make this even more unforgettable. We could make it a new Christmas tradition.”
“I did, but you know I want to make it special.” Harry said with a shrug. Hermione gave him an indulgent smile. “I wanted to do like an advent or something but an advent feels like it’d give away his main gift.”
“What brought this on? The end of the school year isn’t for a few more months.” Draco asked curiously. The flash of something in Harry’s eyes really got his attention.
“I will.” Blaise said and turned to see Draco standing at a window display. “You like that jacket, don’t you?”
“So you get a crash course in why the holidays are stressful.” Hermione said while narrowing her eyes slightly as she set a tray of mulled cider down hard on the table jolting Harry out of staring into space. Ron just stared down at the present as his ears started to turn red.
“Well, it’s not just any old Saturday.” Scorpius said as he sat on the bed next to Draco. Draco sat up and propped his pillows up behind him.
“I don’t know who he is, Draco. But I don’t trust him.” Remus said leaning in towards Draco while eyeing Blaise who was just smiling.
“That a girl.” Blaise said cheekily earning a small laugh. “Just go out and greet them in your usual warm hearted manner.” Blaise encouraged as he guided her to the door, the butler walking in to announce Harry and Draco’s arrival.
“You know what? Let him stay there. I need to have a chat with his father. It will involve a lot of yelling. And me hexing his arse.” Lily said. Narcissa nodded in understanding.
“Bedroom.” Draco gasped as he groped for his wand and held Harry to him as he apparated them directly to his bedroom.
“No. It was me. When an immortal finds himself envying the mortal entrusted in his care that’s a danger signal.” Blaise said and then gave Harry an intense look. “Take him in your arms and hold him tight.” He once more looked up. “Alright, coming. Kiss him for me, you lucky Harry.”
Blaise turned and headed for the door. Luna suddenly rushed to the door before he got to it and opened it for him. “Good bye.” He said laughingly.
“No ones perfect.” Lucius said and jumped when Narcissa made a loud noise. “Cissa?!” He asked startled.
“You make me happy.” Draco said making Harry feel all warm and tingly. “This, just makes me want to...”
“Potter.” Draco stated trying not to blush in embarrassment at the fact that the other man just watched him eat like a pig.
“Well then it’s time you tried.” Blaise said with a smile. He walked over to Draco and looped his arm around the blond’s, pulling him over to the skate rentals.
“Well I’m usually here waiting for you so I know you’re here. Also, honey?” Harry asked as he kissed Draco as usual.
“I thought that was your idea.” Harry said furrowing his brow in confusion. Draco sighed and finally got out of Harry’s hold to lay next to him.
“I’m afraid I can’t Minerva. I have a great deal of work to do.” Blaise said as he took the hand she held out. “But don’t keep Harry and Draco waiting.”
“I’m fine. Oh! You heard about Al and Jamie?” Lily asked. “They’re in their rooms. I was a very good girl.”
“Just walk. Like we used to. We can shop and watch the ice skaters. And get lunch together. At Fleur’s.” Harry said. He relaxed under the happy smile Draco aimed at him.
“No.” Draco said quietly and then stronger said, “you must leave. You have to go now. Never come back.”
James stared and pouted at the ground. Draco just shook his head and stood up only to hug James. James grunted and tried to get away but Draco just held on tightly. Albus and Scorpius ran over to them.
“Look at this.” Remus said as he held the bottle up for Harry to see. He poured the liquid into two glasses but when he held the bottle up it was still full. “This Sherry was of substandard quality but it was passable. Now it’s delicious, it stimulates, and it does the complete opposite of inebriate, no matter how much is ingested.”
“Our allotted time for being away is up.” Draco pointed out. He stopped teasing when he saw the wild look in Harry’s eyes.
“Ooooh.” Luna said lowly as she headed for the kitchen, glancing once more at the door with that same look.
“Hey come on! They’re passing out the medals!” The kid with the crown came over and dragged them back to the play area. Draco watched as James slowly tromped over to them.
“Just presents.” Harry said taking a sip and humming in appreciation. Hermione grabbed her mug and sat next to Harry.
Draco had checked in on the boys, satisfied they were all asleep he headed to his room. He checked on Lily in her crib, the little baby fast asleep. Draco couldn’t help it so he leaned down and gently kissed her head. Draco stood up quickly when Harry rushed in saying his name.
“Well then isn’t it nice of you to pop out to the store and grab some and some food to eat.” Draco said as he sank back into the couch, tucking the cheque back into the envelope and setting it on the coffee table.
“Father also said that with you here maybe we’d actually see dad.” Albus said, sounding a little snide about it. Blaise’s eyebrows raised in surprise at the tone.
“You’re a pain in my ass.” Draco stated. He kept talking before Harry said a perverted joke. “You go to your class and I’ll meet you back here.”
“First of all, it’s not that terrible considering.” Hermione said as she handed him the Prophet. It had a picture of him looking awkward and a blurry picture of his hand with his ring on it next to it.
Harry tried reading the newspaper but it wasn’t holding his attention. He stood up and started pacing. He decided to see what was happening in the kitchen. He heard the front door open and immediately went to see Draco.
“Well he’s been in love with Harry for years now. I don’t see why not.” Luna said and then hugged Ginny. “A baby born from pure love.” She said with a happy sigh.
The physical therapy had been terrible at first. He was expecting the pain so it wasn’t that. It was because he hadn’t been listening to an extremely professional Malfoy, which was disconcerting. It wasn’t until Harry almost landed himself back in the hospital barely a week later due to his own stupidity that Malfoy gave him an ultimatum. Either he gets with the program or Malfoy leaves. Well, it was yelled with bigger words and with more swearing but that was the gist of it.
Harry relaxed into Draco and absolutely melted when he was kissed so sweetly. Draco pulled back and kissed Harry’s cheek as he untangled himself from the others hold. Harry frowned as Draco walked to the door.
Board meeting 11 AM. Tomorrow. Thursday.” Hermione repeated back while writing it down in Harry’s calendar.
“I don’t do... discounts.” Severus said with such distain making the blond laugh and getting the attention of the two older men.
“Keep the soup warm, Harry had to take a phone call.” Draco said to Luna as she came to collect the barely eaten starters.
“I asked our cook to leave a meal out for you for when you get hungry.” Draco said as he made sure everyone was bundled up. Blaise went and fetched the baby carriage earning a kind smile from Draco as James placed Lily securely in it.
“Draco, look at the bigger picture. I want this new office to inspire hope. To be a place that tells people the law is on their side. I want-“ Harry started.
Harry stood in the very extravagantly furnished East Drawing Room in the McGonagall stately mansion. It wasn’t the first time he’d been to the mansion, of course, but this was the first time he didn’t take any notice of the room he was in. He was too busy thinking of that man with his husband.
Harry had bought finely crafted robes for Draco. They were black so they could be worn anywhere. They were definitely winter robes though because the entire inside was fur lined. He knew that the fur was humanely sourced and that there was a type of preservation charm that kept the fur fresh and clean. He had been too busy imagining Draco in them to listen too closely to the salesperson.
“Yes.” Draco said feeling dumbfounded and giddy at the same time. Harry grinned and finally kissed him properly. “Dear Merlin, at the rate you’re going, you’re going to propose to me on your birthday.”
“Lunch. One o’clock. You made the appointment over a month ago.” Hermione explained. She then turned and grabbed her large purse. She turned to look at Harry as she left the room, slowly closing the door behind her. “Goodnight Harry.”
“And what’s more, turns out it’s a museum piece, worth a fortune.” Remus said. He held Harry’s arm when the man tried to give it back. “You keep it. Give it to Draco as a Christmas gift. Perhaps it will bring you both luck. This might sound terrible, me being a broken down professor and you being the new and youngest Head Auror, but I feel sorry for you. I wish there was something I could do to help.”
“Oh. Yes. It just sort of happened.” Draco said relaxing. Blaise patted him on the shoulder as Draco turned back to his notes. “Let me work.”
“What?” Draco asked blearily as he forced his eyes open. He squinted at the person standing next to him. “Scor? Whas wrong?” His mind finally woke up and he quickly sat up. “Wait. What’s wrong?!” Scorpius wasn’t supposed to be home.
“Why would I make things easy for you?” Draco asked as he let out a pleased sigh. Harry just hummed amused.
“Of course. Have a good evening Professor.” The man said and then quickly walked away leaving Remus befuddled.
“Well, you’ve been warned repeatedly. So whatever happens happens.” Draco said pompously. Draco then leaned forward to kiss Harry. “You make me do stupid things Harry James Potter.”
Harry watched as Draco went up the stairs while Blaise watched him. Harry finally turned to look at Blaise. He took a few deep breaths and unclenched his hands from behind his back.
Severus raised his eyebrow in amusement making Draco roll his eyes. His manner etiquette kicked in when he was rushed. Draco shook Remus’s hand in a firm handshake.
“It says your name on your card.” Blaise pointed at the little information card that was on the dash. Neville hummed in response.
“He’s an astounding man. He pointed out to me what I could really do with my money. Help the hungry and the poor, those displaced and those with nowhere to go. As noble as your new building would be, housing and provision are more needed.” Mrs. McGonagall said. Draco smiled at the suddenly generous woman but startled when Harry stood up.
“Father! Father!” Scorpius ran over looking disheveled, an equally disheveled Albus behind him. “We won!”
“Yes father.” They said in unison. Draco leaned down and kissed Lily’s nose turning her unhappy baby noises to a happy giggle.
Hermione threw a notice-me-not charm at Harry as she walked away. She knew that small paragraph would annoy Harry. He was always so irrational when it came to Draco.
“Albus.” Draco said tiredly as he walked down the stairs, a boy a few years older than the two carrying a little girl with red hair right behind him.
“Yes?” He asked as he gathered his wits about him and turned. No one was there. He walked to the door to check if someone was outside the door but no one was around. He shut it and turned only to encounter a handsome, well dressed man standing by his fireplace smiling at him.
“I like that you’re inelegant. Makes it easier to hear you coming.” Draco said as he sat up and stared at all the presents. “You know, you keep giving me all these gifts. I don’t know if I can reciprocate.”
Draco hummed and brought the two gifts closer to himself. They were both in a familiar shade of blue boxes with blue ribbons, small T & C.’s adorned the boxes and ribbon. He pulled on the ribbon of one and lifted the lid up. He delicately lifted the ornament and stared in slight awe. It was a blown glass ornament made of translucent blue glass in what looked like a traditional Christmas lightbulb shape. It had strips of glass adorning the middle with Tiffany & Co. stamped right in the center. It had the signature blue colored ribbon as the ornament hanger.*
“Are you hungry?” Draco asked Harry. Harry nodded. “Do you want to go in the Great Hall or to the kitchens?”
“Not that! Please spare me from nerd speak.” Blaise said with a roll of his eyes. He then grabbed Draco’s left hand and raised it up, the ring catching the light. “What is this?”
Blaise opened the locked door and walked out, shutting it behind him. Harry walked over to the door and tried to open it but couldn’t. It wasn’t until he unlocked the door that he could open it. Harry just quietly sat in the chair by the door staring off into space.
“Before you leave, take this.” Remus said reaching into his pocket and pulling out an antique coin. “It’s not much but it started me on my career path to teaching history. It hasn’t been of much use these days though.”
“Yes.” Draco breathed out while staring at the rings in awe. He then looked into Harry’s eyes and said more firmly, “Yes.”
Harry dropped one arm to then lead Draco over to the tree they had bought at the start of the month. It was scarcely decorated except with a string of lights and a few baubles they had used as ornaments, such as his old Hungarian Horntail figurine. It liked moving around the tree and had claimed the top as it’s main perch. The one actual ornament they had was a metal snitch with their initials engraved on it and the year of their first Christmas as boyfriends. Draco said he wanted to save up for fancy ornaments like those from his childhood but had wanted something in his tree.
The text was mainly speculating on who it was he was married to. Not who he was engaged to. That made him laugh. The name dropping of girls and his past experiences with romance was annoying though.
Harry positively beamed at him. Before Ron knew it Harry tackled him in a hug making them both fall back on Ron’s bed. They both grunted in surprise when Hermione jumped on top of Harry.
They both sat down at opposite sides of the long table in stony silence. Draco ate his starter quietly as Harry stared at him. He glanced at his food and moved it around a little but didn’t eat any.
“We’ll be right there, Luna.” Draco said not taking his eyes off Harry as Luna left the room. “Harry if only you could see your poor harassed face.”
“We were talking about Malfoy.” Ron said. Hermione properly looked over her shoulder at the Slytherin table and looked back at Harry with a knowing look.
“So after,” Draco vaguely gestures at his arm with the Dark Mark, “I can soak up the sun on my own personal yacht?”
“Oh, yes, that too.” Lucius said. At the glare he received he said, “I don’t care that Lily is muggleborn.”
“Well, I... And th-the...” Harry pointed at the picture and pointed up at the ceiling. He then glanced at his watch. Noticing the time he quickly walked out of the office to grab his coat and hat out of the hallway closet. As he headed to the front door he noticed Blaise standing by the doorway to his office, still holding the index cards.
“If you glare any harder he might light on fire.” Ron said glancing in the direction Harry was staring and then immediately went back to his food.
Draco beamed at him as he grabbed the other ring. Harry almost smacked the ring out of Draco’s hand in his excitement, prompting Draco to hold his hand to put the ring on. Once the ring resized itself, Draco brought his hand up and kissed his knuckle right above the ring.
“They aren’t!” Harry said harshly making Ron jump. “They aren’t dating. They’re just good friends.” Harry said calmly.
Hermione stood back and watched as Harry started pacing back and forth. She let him get through his rant before trying to say anything. Even when he was done she gave him a few seconds.
“I dunno. You look like you got yourself a present.” Ginny said from the opposite doorway. She flicked her wand and he grimaced at the cleaning charm that ran over him.
“Why, there’s blue in your eyes.” Blaise said entranced but continued. “I see a man who loves his family. I see a man who’s adored. I see a rich full life.”
“Draco, darling.” Narcissa called out after knocking. She waited a moment and then opened the door. She raised an eyebrow at the door not being locked.
“That’s out of the question. They expect me. They would never do it if I sent an a..ssistant.” Harry said. He looked at Draco and saw his eyes turn downcast and a frown mar his face. “Excuse me.” He said to Blaise as he led Draco out into the hall. He opened his mouth to speak but stopped to look at Blaise. Blaise was looking at Draco intently but when he saw Harry looking at him he smiled and walked fully into the office.
“I was too busy snogging you in victory.” Harry said smiling at the memory of catching the snitch, flying over to the family stands where Draco had walked over to the edge while casually taking off his jacket, and then grabbing him to snog him in excitement. He was excited for his victory and seeing Draco in his jersey did things to him.
Harry felt dizzy as all his blood rushed south. Draco was standing in the doorway wearing his jersey. The blond smirked and did a spin for him. The jersey was a little on the broad side for the blond but only enough for the collar to be loose. Jerseys were made long to be tucked comfortably in Quidditch trousers. The length was just barely enough to cover Draco. And apparently that was all Draco was wearing.
“Mr. Potter,” Draco started in the most condescending tone, “‘have you been to St. Mungos to check which curse or potion you’ve been subjected to to even be in the presence of that death eater?’ Or ‘Is it blackmail Potter?’ ‘Are you going dark Potter?’ ‘What will all the witches think of you now?’ ‘How long have you been looking at blokes?’ ‘How could you cheat on Ginevra, your school sweetheart?’ I’m sure you could think of other things but what it boils down to is I’m the bad guy and you’re the Wizarding world’s sweetheart.”
“You make me want, Draco. You make me want everything.” Blaise said staring deeply into Draco’s eyes. Draco’s eyes widened in surprise.
“Draco.” Harry said getting the blonds attention. “The truth is, he says he’s a-“ Harry stopped speaking when Blaise stepped right next to him.
“Yes. Should she not?” Draco asked warily. He was confused when Harry rolled into his pillow to groan and then mutter something. “Come again?”
“I’m sure he just got held up.” Blaise said. He didn’t like the frown on the blond’s face. “Maybe he’s at home?”
“You’re engaged, not married!” Lucius said loudly from the window. He then yelped himself as Narcissa used a stinging hex on him and shoved him away from the window.
“Draco, I need to speak to this... gentleman. I’ll see you in a moment.” Harry said trying to get Draco to leave. Draco started to but turned back.
“Oh, I see. James Potter.” Narcissa said and laughed at the pained look on Lucius’s face. “I’m glad you’re heterosexual otherwise I’d worry you’d be like our son with certain Potters.”
“Oh Harry, my name and those I love have been dragged, drowned, and obliterated in the mud. I can handle it. I worry for you.” Draco explained as he went ahead and put the ring back on his left ring finger.
“No. Unless that’s what you want but I’d rather it be private.” Harry said nuzzling his shoulder. Draco cleared his throat.
Harry had only slipped up once with his crush in a physical capacity, which Malfoy didn’t discourage but didn’t encourage either. It wasn’t until the blond explained why the no romantic relationships rule was in place. He had had a few clients in the past try to wine and dine him. A few turned out to be in committed relationships and one just outright tried to assault him. Harry had been so angry when he was told about that incident. Malfoy asked him if he wanted to attack the guy and Harry said yes. The blond just laughed and told him the guy was in jail when Malfoy brought legal action against him, which caused a domino effect of all his past victims stepping up. Harry remembered the case because he’d met that Quidditch player and wished he never had.
“I’ll tell you all about it after I take a shower.” Scorpius said. “I’m surprised Mr. Potter is still here.”
“It probably is. I asked for this in more ways than one. Took for granted...” Harry petered out. “I suppose Blaise came just to confirm that I’ve lost the love of Draco and the children. I also must confess, old friend, that I was given a coin from you but could only see it’s commercial value. I don’t know where it’s gone.”
“They couldn’t throw a snowball before.” James said as he kicked at the snow, not looking at Draco. Draco handed Lily to Luna and gave James his full attention.
“I agree.” Neville said. “Too many people don’t stop to smell the roses. They’re trying to get somewhere too fast but they don’t know where. You two are the opposite. You know exactly where you want to go but you’re taking your time.”
“This is the list of people you and Draco will make house calls on, ending at Mrs. McGonagall’s.” Hermione said as she handed a piece of paper to Harry. She walked over and covered her typewriter.
“I sorta remember in school you had fur lined winter stuff. I hope you don’t mind that.” Harry said now nervous as the blond just stared at what he was holding.
“We went ice skating.” Draco said happily. “You should have seen me. I was gliding like a bird in the air.”
“We had a wonderful time.” Draco said as he walked over to hug and kiss him. “I wish you were with us.”
“Hmm, I wouldn’t mind a title but your majesty is a bit much.” Draco said as he turned back around while running his fingers over the pendant. “How does it look?”
“Are you sure? He and Draco were in here the other day and Draco seemed happier than he’s been in years. In fact, he was quite like his snarky, witty, sarcastic self.” Remus pointed out.
“Yes. How did you know?” Blaise asked as he approached them. Scorpius, the spitting image of his father Draco, hid behind Albus.
Just a reminder that this is based on an AU where Draco had nothing but his Potion Mastery and worked hard to earn his own money.
“Thank you.” Draco said. His eyes widened when he caught the time on his watch. “I have to go. It was lovely seeing you Severus. Professor.”
“Christmas tree shopping. I want the big one by the door, Severus.” Draco said as he pointed out the tree. “And can it be delivered Christmas Eve night? I want it to be a nice surprise for when the kids wake up.”
She only released Harry when she had to go the other way to the library. When Harry shuffled his feet she snapped her hand up to point down the hall. He looked at her with big eyes, making her roll her eyes. She gently bopped his head with the book.
“I’ve had enough camping to last me several lifetimes. I’d rather be here.” Potter said while looking at him with a charming smile that made Draco blush. He cleared his throat.
There’s an unofficial tradition for professional Quidditch players and their significant others. There have been revelations and celebrations for some. For others, fights have broken out, reflecting very poorly on the Quidditch player caught in the middle. The fans loved the tradition and when Harry became an official Quidditch player, the fans were excited to see him partake in this tradition. What tradition is this? The wearing of the jersey. Not just any jersey, of course, like the ones sold at games or in Quidditch shops. Actual official player jerseys.
I seem to like putting Drarry in holiday situations. I blame the tone of the movies. Very Christmas leaning.
“I’ll join you. He’s going to take it better than you think.” Hermione said in a matter of fact tone.
Finally putting chapter 17 up. Again this hasn't been beta read so all mistakes are mine. ALSO Chapter 16 has been rewritten so please if you read it before 1/6/19 reread it!
“We start with Charlie.” Fred said confident, “He is the least likely to have been involved in anything involving Dumbledore, he doesn’t like the headmaster. Always said something was off about him.” George nodded, “Then Bill, he likes Harry, I’m sure of it.” They sighed together and added in sync, “than father.”
“Good.” Sirius said. Moony whimpered and Remus felt himself wanting to wrap Sirius in a hug. When ever his friend talked about his family, it made him sad and angry and neither Remus or Moony liked that.
Which left him with one option. The Restricted section. If he has been home there were a number of professors he could ask for a pass to the closed-off section. But he hadn’t had the time to make an impression on the professors here.
Harry took slow steps following, letting himself fall just far enough behind he could whisper to Malfoy.
As they walked, Harry’s stomach grumbled and he noticed it was growing dark. He sighed, they had been out longer then he thought. He waited until they were back in their room before asking Malfoy what they planned to do for dinner.
“You will both have to take a full bottle of this,” Snape said, tearing Harry from his thoughts. The dark haired man handed him and Draco one small potion bottle each. Harry knew what they were. It was the reason most of the room looked pale. The potion was a reverse to the nutrient potion, custom made by Snape and Bill.
Nott was the only one to acknowledge him, with a small nod before the burnett turned and started talking to Goyle.
Fred frowned, “What if we ask him to take it? He is our brother he should trust us.” George snorted. Fred opened his eyes and grinned, “Okay, so most of the time he shouldn’t trust us, but if we tell him it’s important, he will.” His twin nodded.
He knew Percy was on the outs with his family. Had been for a while. Charlie was positive it was mostly embarrassment at this point. His little brother had been so sure that Dumbledore and Harry had been lying about You-know-who being back, only for the man to attack Harry in the Department of Mysteries (DOM). He knew he had sent a couple letters to his brother trying to get him to come home and talk to him. But he hadn’t known that the twins had tried as well.
“As badly as I want to keep kissing you,” the blonde leaned forward and laid a quick kiss in Harry’s lips, but pulled away before Harry could return it, “we need to go.” Harry groaned and dropped his head.
He ignored Malfoy, “We…” He said drawing out the we, to make a point to the blonde, “need to access our family’s vaults, but are unsure if it is possible.” The goblin tilted his head, encouraging me to continue.
“Mr. Lupin.” Headmaster Dumbledore called from behind them. He groaned again trying to think of what they had done recently to that could get them in trouble.
“From what I can gather,” Lupin said sitting down next to his friend, “Harry and Draco are somewhere together,
Also, I don't know if you guys know but I have a tumblr, under Nobodyzhuman. I try to post update info and teasers. I also take prompts for far to many fandoms haha.
He opened his mouth but the words wouldn’t form. It was like they froze in his throat and no matter how he urged them to move, they didn’t. He closed his mouth than his eyes. Maybe it would be easier if he wasn’t looking at them.
“Slytherin isn’t what people think,” The blonde went one, “We come off standoffish because we tend to stick to our own. And why wouldn’t we, people expect us to be exactly what you just said, cruel, mean, dark, very few are willing to see past the rumors.” Malfoy stood straighter, “Slytherins are intelligent, clever and are survivors. But people don’t like to tell their children that, because then they wouldn’t have a target to hate.” Harry could hear the angry in the other teen’s voice and he wondered how much the rumors bothered him.
Although it left Harry feeling guilty, the man would be punished for a crime he didn’t commit, Sirius had told him that the man had gotten away with horrible things, beating and curses against dark wizards. All because he was an auror and said they were Death Eaters resisting arrest. It had been Remus that finally convinced Harry to go through with it. The werewolf had pulled him aside and showed him an article in the Prophet where Owen had insisted Sirius be killed on sight if found. That the ‘murderer’ was better off dead than sent back to Azkaban.
Then Remus removed his arm and Harry had to bite back a disappointed sound. Slughorn moved away next and it was just Harry and Snape. The other student tilted his head a little then shook it and looked away and it was like he could breathe again.
He didn’t speak to the blonde as they walked back to their room, nor when he ate or changed and crawled into bed. He didn’t even make a sound when he felt tears fall, as he thought about the consequences on if he saved his parents.
Igorth must not have cared much about his responds because before he could utter a word the goblin placed the necklace over his head and when Harry felt it settle over his chest there was an electric spark that shot through him.
“You really can’t stay on your feet can you?” He heard Malfoy ask from behind him. He turned to glare at the other boy, but Malfoy just smirked.
They finally reached the end of the long walk, maybe it was only long to him, but it had felt longer than it should have.
It seemed that Slytherin was going to respect customs and leave Evan alone. He let his arm drop away and it seemed to break whatever standstill they had fallen into. Slughorn wondered off and Sirius dragged him back towards their table.
He gritted his teeth, “He would if someone tortured him or forced the spell from him.” He said, hating himself for doing it. He didn’t want to think about the horrible things that could be happening to his godson. But it was his job to think about things like that. Normally Lucius would be thinking the same. But his judgement was clouded by worry over his son.
“Sorry, we...umm…well when we found about this stuff,” He shook the papers in his hand, “We also learned some other stuff, but there was a Truth Circle involved, so...” He shrugged, " there were others there. We invited them over today to talk about it all. You guys can’t be there. Sorry.” He took a breath to stop his rambling, not used to doing
“This is connected to your inheritance.” Then he moved to another, causing Harry to shudder. He couldn’t tell if the sensation was good or bad, it just felt weird. Like someone was touching him but not at the same time.
Once he made it into the common room, he had to stop and look around. How different the large room felt now. Not just different from his time in the past but different from his first five years here. This room had been his safe haven for so long but this time instead of walking in and feeling welcomed he felt his skin crawled. He bit his lip to stop from tearing up at the monumental loss. Dumbledore, Ron, Hermione, and Ginny had ruined this too.
So personally the start of this chapter is a little boring but it's needed. I however loved writing the end, even if its emotional. This hasn't been beta read so all mistakes are mine. :)
“They could be useful.” Malfoy said. Then looked at the single book, harry had placed onto the pile. When he looked at Harry with a raised brow, Harry felt his cheeks redden in embarrassment.
He snorted and walked over and opened the window. The dark brown owl hooted at him and flew into the room. It dropped down on their counter, close to a fresh batch of Nosebleed Nougats. He watched amused his brother lunged across the counter, waving the bird off. George stuck his tongue out  as he moved the candy away from it. Fred chuckled at his brother. Who was then bitten by the owl.
“Huh, then these will be of no use. However, I have a few more questions,” He stood up, “ I believe we will be more comfortable over here.” He moved to the sitting area, Harry looked at Malfoy, the blonde just rolled his eyes and got up and moved to the couches. Harry quickly followed. They ended up on the same couch, sitting across from Grimmhook, who had saw a piece of parchment on the table and had a quill floating over it.
“Here.” He said and enjoyed the confused look on Malfoy’s face. When he found they were standing in front of a wall and not a room.
Harry sagged in relief and jumped off the stool before the hat could change its mind. He quickly made his way towards his table. A strange feeling hit him as he did. His friends weren’t here. He wouldn’t sit between Hermione and Neville. Ron wouldn’t be across from him muttering about the food or auguring with Ginny about Quidditch. His steps faltered. Where the hell was he supposed to sit?
New chapter :) Please let me know what you think. I'm debating doing more from this pov but want to see if you guys like it first.
He ate breakfast at a small shop, before he went about buy some toiletries they needed for the bathroom. He was on his way back, when a wave of dizziness hit him. He stumbled and barley caught himself on a wall, it didn’t last long and when it was gone, he felt tired.
He was a little disappointed when he didn’t recognize the owl. It meant that the letter wasn’t from Ron or Hermione like he was hoping. His two best friends had been almost silent over the summer, leaving him feeling left out and forgotten. He tried to reason that it was because they were unable to write due to secrets like the year before but that didn’t stop it from hurting.
“Two requests to claim the Potter family seats in the Wizengamot, both denied. An arranged marriage agreement between Harry James Potter and Ginevra Weasley signed by both Molly Weasley and Albus Dumbledore.”
“Neither have I.” Something about the bitter way, Malfoy said it, made Harry want to ask questions but he figured they weren’t friends, so it wasn’t his place.
He was so relieved when they were done, he had no idea why Malfoy or his Aunt seemed to enjoy shopping so much, he found it boring and stressful.
He silently took a couple of the bags and headed out of the store. He headed towards leaky cauldron, but there was a mumbled curse behind and suddenly he was being yanked in a different direction.
“I can’t.” He said, looking up to meet the blondes gaze. He could see understanding there, something he never would have imagined. It seemed that even the cruel bully he knew could understand the hurt he felt, at the idea of seeing his parents.
Charlie’s breath caught, George’s eyes had shifted to a deep blue, they seemed to reflect all the light in the room.
“It will be alright,” Remus whispered as they left the room, Sirius looked back over his shoulder one last time. Harry and Draco were both passed out on the small loveseat, the twins sitting on the arms watching over them. Which Charlie transfigured their clothes to looked dirty and torn. He sighed and turned away. He trusted the three Weasleys to look after his pup. He just wished he could be the one staying behind to keep an eye on them.
Not wanting to dwell on it, he quickly rushed up the stairs and into the 6th year dorm room. Thankfully it was empty. He went over to his bed and found everything was back to where it had been before his and Draco’s unexpected trip. He wondered if everyone had just left his stuff there or if the headmaster only returned it the night before. He shrugged and pulled a shrunken trunk out of his robe pocket.
“Sorry.” He whispered, “Thank you again for helping me.” Before Snape could say anything, he pushed passed him and hurriedly walked outside.
He tried to pay attention as Professor McGonagall started talking but he couldn't. Sure, he wasn't worried about the boy being a wolf anymore. Lilly was right. The headmaster wouldn't risk putting two werewolves together without at least talking about it. But that didn't answer why he felt protective of the other kid or why he smelt like pack. He felt Souris’s arm tightened and looked up to see the boy was sitting down on the stool.
“You two need to go to bed.” He said in what he hopped was a confident don’t question me tone. From the dramatic eye roll Sirius gave him he succeeded. James reached over to shake Evan awake but Remus quickly caught his wrist.
He sighed and got up to follow him. He hated that Sirius’s family treated him the way he did, and he hated that his friend always seemed to blame himself.
“Cut the Nettle into thirds.” The other student said handing him a plant and then a root, “Then slice the ginger into thin slivers.” Deciding it was better to just go with it. Harry took the offered ingredients and did as he was told.
Bill and the twins were still searching through the Manor. So far, Bill was in heaven because of some of the ancient Potter and  Peverell family heirlooms. Harry hadn’t known who the Peverell’s were until Bill and Remus gave an excited lecture about 3 brothers and the legends surrounding them. While Harry and Sirius agreed the part about meeting and beating death seemed far fetched they agreed that with a family that old and powerful it was probable that whatever Dumbledore was looking for was something handed down from that part of Harry’s family. That suspicion helped to narrow down the Weasely’s search.
The look of fear that crossed the man’s eyes as he approached the table made him feel uneasy. He held up his hand, “I’m here because of my son. I mean no harm. I swear.” The was a gently hum in the air as he made the promise. The wolf must have felt it because he relaxed and gestured to the seat across from him.
“My name is Grimmhook, please follow me.” The taller one said, and then lead them into a private room. The room, was larger then Harry had been expecting, at one end it held a large desk, large in width not height. Two chairs in front of it. But at the other end, there was a sitting area, two decent sixed couches facing each other, with a table in the middle. Harry could see a few items scattered across the table, but besides a few bowls he couldn’t really tell what was there.
“What kind of changes?” Harry asked, because he understood what the blonde was saying but this whole inheritance thing was freaking him out a little, he had never heard of it before and had no idea what to expect from it.
This time he did look up, “Because you’re different.” He said, trying to search his mind for the right way to work this, “When I first met you, you were stuck up, self-centered and mean.” He took a breath, “All these years, we argued and fought and standing here now, I don’t know why. Because you aren’t that person. And I don’t know when that changed. How did I miss that change?” He asked with a groan, “Was I just so caught in what I thought you should have been, a pureblood Slytherin, a dark wizard, that I missed what you actually are?”
After that the class seemed to fall back into his usual rhythm, the only things off where how Evan kept far away from his partner and how the blonde Slytherin Luke kept looking back and watching Evan.
George was starting to wonder two things, how far he and his brother could push flirting with the young Slytherin sitting on their couch before Snape snapped and murdered them and if they should just assume that the elder Malfoy wasn’t coming and start.
As he talked he watched Malfoy’s fingers disappear as the blonde slipped them under the cloak. “It’s an invisibility cloak. I thought they were a myth.” The Slytherin looked so awed that Harry didn’t have it in him to rush him alone. He let Malfoy fiddling with the cloak for a few more minutes before the blonde seemed to come back to himself and slip it over his shoulders, pulling Harry in with him.
Malfoy had left the library in a good mood earlier, so Harry was taken by surprise when he entered the Room of Requirements and had to duck out of the way of book flying at his face. He heard the book hit the wall behind with a thud and looked towards the blonde.
He was confused, because Malfoy’s eyes had darkened and Harry could see that his breathing had sped up. Shivers ran down his spine, he gulped and took a step back. Not really understand why, but doing it nonetheless.
“Of course.” Malfoy said, then like the day before he was up and moving towards the door, just expected Harry to follow him. He was so very tempted not to move, but the need for money out weighted him messing with the blonde, so he pushed himself off the bed and followed.
“Enough, Severus.” Lucius demanded stepping into the circle, two confused redheads watching from behind him, “This is Draco’s spell work. I would recognize it anywhere. Get in here.” His blonde friend glared at him, “Now.”
When it finally did, he shot to his feet running towards the willow. He heard Malfoy curse, again, as he chased after him.
His pulse raced and the urge to back away, suddenly become one to run. HE gritted his teeth and made himself remain where he was.
“His mini dragon from the tournament.” Fred said, “He kept it. It normally flies around the dorm causing little--”
“It seems,” said Fred, “That the younger Malfoy is quite talented, he wrote in a an exception for Mister Malfoy to tell Remus.”  The was a chorus of questions, but Snape stepped forward
When they finally found a small pup, they walked into it. There weren’t many people inside, and only the lady behind the bar looked up at them as they entered.
“Oh, just set a password of something of his.” He said with a shrug, hoping they bought his slight lie.
Again, the room fell into silence, Harry was trying to think of what to do next. If Malfoy believed him then they would have to work together to find a way back to their own time. If Malfoy didn’t then he would have to continue trying to make him believe, or at least stop him from running off to tell Dumbledore about them.
Harry woke up the next morning surprisingly refreshed and comfortable. Not something he was used to giving the nightmare he normally suffers when he sleeps. He was tempted to just relax and fall back asleep, but he noticed that he was also warm and pressed against another warm body.
Just a little bit asleep when I went over this. Please let me know of any mistakes. Thanks and enjoy.
He tried not to look over at the Gryffindor table as he walked towards the front of the room, where he could see the hat, resting on a stool. But he did. It didn’t take him long to spot Remus, and he stumbled when he saw the black-haired man whispering excitedly in the werewolf’s ear.
The blonde jumped and looked around. Harry had to cover his mouth to hide his laugh. He waited until Malfoy settled down before doing it again. This time Malfoy stood up from his seat and actually searched the area around him. It took a minute before the blonde made to sit back down but Harry poked him in the ribs before he made it to the chair.
He was holding a submissive, one that hadn’t quiet presented fully. Which wasn’t that strange but the fact that the young man seemed confused about it was. His family should have warned him about an inheritance if he had one and told him what to expect. He wanted to growl because sending a submissive out into the world without knowledge was a sure way for the young man to get hurt.
Snape hissed at him, pulling his arm away from their potion. A wave of something watched over him and he dropped the leaves on the floor. He took a step back from the Slytherin trying to resist the urge to lower his head and apologize.
He was about three chapters in and learned the Gringotts and the Goblins had a lot more power then he ever guessed what an arm full of clothes was dropped into his lap. He yelped and as he jumped he tried to catch them all before the fell onto the floor.
