Professor Snape stiffened.
That way of doing things is for a different world, for different people.”
He’d first seemed interested on Draco’s reference to Harry as his heir, but did that count as being truly “pleased”? Draco didn’t think so. He’d been somewhat angry that Lucius and the others hadn’t noticed that fact, but not one of the towering rages Draco had heard whispers about.
He flipped the cover open and found the table of contents, feeling frustration curdle in his stomach like sour milk as each of the chapter titles failed to apply to the situation:
Draco managed to speak around a line of drooling vomit as it streamed slowly out of his mouth.
He snatched a pinch of Floo powder and tossed it into the fireplace.
“Besides. I’d go to any lengths to please you, my Harry.”
“I take it Lucius has reported the same thing.”
“You should know more about your own turtle. Turtles don’t move much because their shells are so heavy. They can only move short distances, and very slowly. If you like I could lend you a book about turtles, Frankie.”
Gryffindor most certainly
He’d chosen a very small table for a good reason.
Draco smiled at him reassuringly.
“Molly Weasley thinks I’m too thin.”
the surveillance charms?” Harry asked anxiously.
“Sometimes…most of the time…I see really horrible things. Torture and murder. But sometimes…I overhear conversations…Draco…I-”
“We know, Tom.”
Draco cut her off:
! These amateurs are trying to swindle you, Lord Malfoy! And undoubtedly, plan to return later to rob you blind themselves!” The goblin said, rather disdainfully.
“~~May we eat this?~~”
“Potter has both his blood-father’s Gryffindor heritage, and his soul-father’s Slytherin heritage battling inside him. The first has been encouraged and wheedled out of him by Dumbledore, yet he retains a strong inner darkness despite all attempts to stifle it. You will recall that he was seduced by the desire to torture my mother’s sister, Bellatrix, with the Cruciatus curse.”
“Alohomora.” Snape said, then reached for the handle of the door, a look of confusion crossing over his face as it refused to move.
In under a second, James was by his side, watching the door. The soft glow under the crack was false moonlight – real enough to give the room beyond a soothing nocturnal illumination but not real enough to give his namesake any trouble.
The two men stood up.
“Do you suppose they’ll be alright?” Draco asked him in a low voice.
“That’s impossible!”
“Anyways, that asshole Archer was very confrontational about it and was actually calling for the Aurors to arrest them or something, but Blaise showed up and smoothed things over with legal mumbo-jumbo and a few threats.”
“Positive? About the Dark Marks acting up? What could be positive about that?”
“Okay. I’ll help you. What do you need?”
“Indeed not. But, I’m afraid I can’t allow you to actively seek a new husband until after Potter and I are wed.” Draco said.
from reaching for it.
With some effort Jamie slowed her breathing and returned her face to a neutral expression. Her eyes belied the attempt, dancing with merriment as she stood before his inspection, waiting for him to finish so she could burst with her exciting news.
?” She said, after staring at it in surprise for a moment.
Jamie was waiting, an eyebrow raised in perfect mimicry of one of his own expressions.
to distract you! Now let go of me!” Draco was trying to pull out of the dive but Potter was holding him fast.
“Tom, you’ll want to cast Expelliarmus at me, like I taught you before. I’m going to cast it at you. We have to do this at the same time so the wands will connect.”
Madame Pomfrey turned back to Draco and raised her wand in preparation.
“You older students, I know there is usually some horseplay involved with a bunch of kids of different ages thrown together into a close situation like this. I will let some degree of playful teasing pass. But, and you had better hear me, as the older student,
Draco felt oddly relieved at the reminder of the man’s hybrid status.
“Potter.” Draco said curtly. “And to think I’d presumed it was a problem in the washroom. Just because your filthy Muggles won’t bathe doesn’t mean you’ve an excuse for contaminating the magical world with your stink.”
“I’m sorry. It has to be this way.” Draco told him. And pushed him backwards into Nagini’s coils.
“There’ll be a note.” Weasley told him. “Look on its back, between the shoulderblades.”
Molly Weasley placed the spoon carefully back in the pot, and with a twirl of her wand, set it to stirring. Draco found his eyes tracking every movement…then staying with the spoon as it went around, and around, and around…delicious steam coming up…
The Common Room was abuzz with plotting Slytherins. From first year to seventh, every one of them was in that house because they were natural schemers with a flair for the intricacies of the higher branches of wizarding politics – not the public politics of who was running for Minister, but the more subtle intricacies of who was indebted to whom. Or allied with, influenced by, held influence over, was related to, in feud against, or as in this case, negotiating with…
“It’s been sent. He has it in his hand now.”
Draco let his fingers curl protectively over Harry’s ring once again.
“It’s just a projection of the pure wand that used to exist. The Dark Lord’s wand won’t recognize him because this Tom’s magical signature is still pure, and that wand has grown along with the magical signature of the Dark Lord.”
The infant blew a raspberry.
“I think…I think we should talk to him.”
“What-“
“Not as far as I’m concerned. I am
“I’ve a contract, magically self-enforcing as an Unbreakable Vow. You won’t tell anyone else, or use the information in any way without informing me first and gaining my approval.”
“I am Lord Thomas of Slytherin, likewise pleased to meet brethren of power.” He murmured.
“Hybrid marriage rituals are extremely dangerous.”
“You wanted me to back off.”
Narcissa Malfoy stared at him, speechless.
“Have you
“We’ve never used a Penseive before.” Regulus said with a shrewd glance at his brother.
Anything could happen to him while he was away, and Tom wouldn’t even know!
“Holy fuck!” Draco cradled his hand, stunned, looking up to see a horrified Harry Potter looking at Draco’s hand, then curling his limbs in to himself as if to prevent them from ever touching anyone else, peeking up at Draco’s burnt hand guiltily.
Tom nodded understanding.
“Yes.”
“Take this and clean it. I want a new towel immediately. You’re to regularly clean and replace this towel every morning while the room is empty. Understand?”
“Did you tell him about us?”
Potter seemed on the verge of saying something, then seemed to bite his tongue.
“Funny, I’ve seen you naked, but I’ve never been in your room before.” He commented.
“Second, in the interests of inter-house relations and school unity, Hogwarts will for the first time field a united Quidditch team drawn from the four House teams – which will compete against other European schools.”
“Why are you out of your beds at this hour?”
“Uh. It’s a series of books, they’re all sort basic introductions to the fundamentals of all sorts of different topics, for adults who never learned them but develop an interest late in life.” Potter explained.
Granger looked at him expectantly.
Dumbledore looked again to Draco.
Sexual play with Harry Potter was…different. Different because, while the sex was mind-blowing in itself, the pure natural physical sensations were a mere channel for the rushing tide of sex magic that completely overrode every conscious thought.
Tom grinned at him.
Molly harrumphed and disappeared.
There was no portrait that jumped out at Draco, nothing that aligned with his own observations of Potter with those around him.
of her meals, Harry? There’s enough trans fats and carbohydrates in one plateful to block up my whole digestive system for weeks!” Draco informed him.
“Now science has caught up to that discredited set of theories, as most of you know. We know that reality is not based on the obvious mechanisms of Newtonian physics but is subject to forces that are both subtle and powerful in their application. We named this college Merlin’s College because what you will be doing, ladies and gentlemen, is no less than what the average person would describe as pure magic! This very cutting-edge of technology has proven that there
“He said all of that, and I said, “I swear, as soon Malfoy is represented in my generation, I will challenge them to a duel and reap equivalent payment.”
“It’s fucking Quidditch, Potter! Beaters are
“Were you aware of any plans for a breakout or attack at Azkaban?”
“So, a duel is necessary. But, did Draco Malfoy kill your father?”
He settled himself and Scorpius down in the warded seat, pulled out his mirror and smiled as his husband answered almost immediately.
No, Severus knew his role in such plans.
“Draco…there’s something else, isn’t there? You’ve hated this boy, and now…this? This goes beyond personal sacrifice for the family, doesn’t it?”
“Oh. That was just the pressure-system shattering. There are now pieces of crystallized dragons-blood scattered all over the Potions lab, and especially inside that one cabinet. It’ll take them a moment to cool to lose their structure. Then the exploding acid will leak out and-”
Jamie smirked.
“I…I do?” Jamie said, her voice trembling a bit. Draco looked down at her and caught her widening her eyes expressively, a lower lip trembling just slightly.
powerful heir.” Draco smirked, his head tilted at a smug angle.
“I’m glad to hear you’ve preserved the fruits of my labors, Draco. Narcissa would not tell me whether you had been to see Our Lord in my absence.”
“But you didn’t use any spells except Lumos and Wingardium Leviosa.” He protested.
“Can you fight?”
have some perfume in it, I think to mask the chemicals…sort of like adding extra chocolate to make a potion taste nice.”
being someone I can safely love. So…there’s only one way to love you, and save myself. I don’t understand how you can love me, Harry, unless you are more sensitive to our relation through Jamie because you are an orphan. But that creates a danger to you as well. It’s best for both of us if we are married, so I can love you back, and we can be a family and
Draco sidled up to her, staring her down.
“Harry…I think it’s for you.” Granger told him.
“What?”
“Wait! I thought you said it had to go the opposite way to the…the…what was it?”
Draco silently opened the door, closing it softly behind him as he padded softly over to the side of the bed.
“Cut off his nose to spite his face.” Potter said, suddenly.
me, the only distasteful thing for you to do will be two words, at the end, Harry. Can you cast just
~Rita Skeeter~
Draco held his breath as the Vanishing Cabinet glowed with a strange dark light, the gold etched runes sending out strange patterns of shadow and deeper shadow on the floor in the space Draco had cleared around the device.
“Oh, I have the device right here.”
But what about Potter’s status? The Dursley’s certainly didn’t have a status in the Muggle world that was similar to Potter’s status in the wizarding world. Draco wasn’t about to insult his future husband with an under-ranked gift, even in a stupid muggle ritual.
[I bear witness to the master of the house, Draco Malfoy]
“It…it’s hissing at me…”
Draco nudged Potter's wand into his hand.
“I have a feeling young Lord Potter is in for a few surprises.”
“Will you notify Ministry authorities if he does contact you?”
the Dark Lord.
agreeing to let bygones be bygones was less important than angering the terrifying woman. In this matter, he and Arthur were victims at the hands of a mutual enemy, of sorts, which could only be positive for their negotiations between themselves, of course.
it could shave precious minutes from his morning routine…
“You say that, but people thought he was dead last time, too. Harry killed him in first year, even! And then another version of him in Second, who knows how many copies of him there are?”
Tom did feel sorry for the boy. Not that he wouldn’t take advantage to collect another vassal for his new family, of course, but it was a harsh fate to be backed into at such a young age. He watched as Heroditus Nott struggled with it, and then the moment when the decision was made.
“Do you also swear that in choosing such memories, you shall adhere to the greatest possible advantage of Draco Malfoy with respect to his future dealings with Harry Potter, without attempt to prevaricate, alter, or edit the extent of such memories in an effort to minimize that advantage?”
“The boy…he had blonde hair and silver eyes like yours!”
Draco squeezed him again.
“It’s…I gave it to ‘Mione so she and Ron could sneak me food in the hospital wing in the middle of the night.” Harry said confusedly.
Flint raised an eyebrow and repeated the gesture, three fingers separated from a raised pinkie and tapped gently twice on the breast, the opposite forearm, and the groin.
“I see you’re an early riser. Harry is still in bed, upstairs. Perhaps you can wake him and bring him down for breakfast?”
“That would be shocking upon first acquaintance!” Severus objected. “These children would revere him as a Parselmouth, but they are still Slytherins!”
His godfather raised an eyebrow and opened the door wider to let Draco in. He took his time composing himself in the straight-backed chair.
“Only back to the gates of Hogwarts.”
“Keep it quiet so you don’t wake the others!”
Harry’s eyes were glued to Draco, looking at his face in the candlelight, his shining blond hair, the trickles of water sliding down his toned chest, highlighting the glimmering pale skin in the multi-hued glow of the candles as it was slowly revealed, inch by inch, sliding out of the water until Draco was standing fully, the water covering him just below his belly button. Just barely high enough to conceal his raging erection.
“Good, we can move, and keep changing our field of vision so we don’t miss new targets coming in range this way. And keep ourselves moving so they can’t fix on us as quickly. As long as we aren’t repetitive. So now we change lead. You first, Potter.”
Then there was a blue flash as the trap on the doorway activated, and Harry Potter disappeared in the blink of an eye.
Potter’s clothes peeled slowly from his body, revealing more and more of that endless tan skin.
Harry shook his head, slowly taking off the ring Draco had given him that morning.
Tommy stared back at them with an uncertain expression.
The magic was surging and Draco could feel that Potter, already, was nearly on the edge of an orgasm. He backed off quickly.
Albus Dumbledore followed him in, moving quickly to Tom’s side.
“Protego! Defodio!”
Beside the dark haired young man stood a tired-looking man with graying hair, a bushy haired teenaged girl and a small crowd of red-haired people, apparently an entire family.
“Can’t we just be Harry and Draco for
“Remus Lupin. A pleasure to meet the one who finally put so many smiles on Harry’s face, lately.”
“Which is…?”
Jamie just looked at him for a minute, then snuck a peak at Draco. Draco kept his face expressionless. She’d have to learn how to handle awkward emotional Gryffindors in her own unique way.
“And at Godrics Hollow, too.” Draco reminded him, tightening the hug a bit, still murmering into the shell of his ear. “And you won, every time. Lucius has always spoken of you with disdain, because a Malfoy should never admit to intimidation. Things are different now.”
“Look ‘Mione, swans! I didn’t know they carried packages!”
“I…I forgot…where…oh Merlin, I’m naked in the Great Hall!” Harry’s face was crimson with embarrassment.
“Well yes. If I recall the lessons I learned at father’s knee, you were verily on the verge of seizing control of the wizarding world before the unfortunate oversight with Potter. Now that you’ve returned, and recruited a similar force of Death Eaters, there is only Dumbledore to deal with and those fools in the Ministry should fall into line relatively swiftly.” Draco summarized smoothly.
“Combat Tutoring” (appears to be centered primarily on tutoring in the use of Muggle projectile weapons, which apparently results in prolonged physical proximity)
“I…yes. Exactly!” Harry said, relieved.
Draco smiled.
“A few yearssss, you ssssay?”
pages!” the boy said, hesitating on and then emphasizing the word ‘Papa’ with a queer sort of pride.
Potter sighed momentarily, then caught himself.
“You gonna be okay, Frankie?”
“There you have it. Two little boys. Both appear quite powerful.”
“You have already set this in motion, or you would not come to me as if it were certain.”
“Draco-”
“But what are they going to do to us?” Frankie whimpered.
Slytherin’s heir. Or his heir-apparent after the Dark Lord,” Draco realized. The git had the magical gifts of
Well. Potter certainly hated Professor Snape. And he was also a Marauder. Perhaps it was time to turn his love of a good prank to Draco’s advantage.
“James. Regulus.” He began, stopping as Scorpius expressed his anger at being ignored.
Harry stepped forward to support the trembling old man.
“Um…a Muggle product. You put it on your face and neck…after you shave. For razor-burn.”
“Potter accepted an agreement by waving his hand. I don’t think he even intended to do it. He was angry when he realized what Placitum Perago meant.”
“Looks like it went a bit fast.”
“You’ll address me by my last name, Potter.”
His mothers eyebrows raised.
Draco paused a moment.
Exactly two minutes later, Bill Weasley entered the room, a lopsided and somewhat confused grin on his face.
you should make a decision, it should be made wisely. You are Potter’s contemporary, you’ve essentially grown up together. And if he survives this war you will live your life feeling the atmosphere of his full potential power in the world. That can be a very good thing or a very bad thing. You have a very different set of choices than this old man.”
Harry shined a lumos on the wand hovering above the receptacle.
“Regulus. James. I’m sure he’ll appreciate your gift. Now get out of here before-“
“Thank you. Now…there is only one other I think I should speak to immediately. Would you mind terribly if I made use of your floo?” Draco asked politely.
But the level of simple magical strength was likewise staggering. And this with a magical inheritance only from his mother. Harry, with his Potter father, his Mudblood mother, and the Dark Lord as a third magical benefactor, would far outstrip even this glowing assessment.
Draco carefully kept his face pleasant, not letting his eyes narrow. Lucius was clearly testing him, attempting to exert control over the situation.
Draco resolved to use this knowledge to his advantage before Jaimie grew old enough to become the object of Potter’s twisted fantasies, as she was a closer relation.
“I assure you Mr. Weasley, the Sorting Hat is doing it’s job as it’s supposed to.” Dumbledore’s voice carried smoothly over the angry redhead’s.
Draco opened his eyes and spoke levelly.
“Whatever can we do to persuade you, Mr. Malfoy! I am certain that any wards this
Well. At least he’d given him careful consideration before slipping into his annoyingly omniscient persona.
“Ronald Weasley.” Granger growled dangerously.
And many more enchanted glass shards, which found their marks in the ranks their own spells hadn’t touched yet.
Potter looked at him like he’d just had an epiphany for a long moment. Then he looked at Jamie.
“He will not be pleased to be intruded on.”
Harry Potter wouldn’t even have a chance.
“Do we? I only see the one reflection.” Ollivander said smugly.
He caught up with Potter wandering one of the more isolated wings on the 7th floor.
The goblin wrung its hands woefully. The Malfoy accounts were a significant bulk of the Gringotts holdings, and the strength of the goblins form of magic was connected somehow to the extent of the riches squirreled away in their vaults.
And in Cloud Zabini, a different kind of loyalty. A true friend, perhaps.  He had read about such wonders before, could it be too much to hope that after years alone, he could now have parents, a baby brother, and even a true friend?
Draco rolled over on top of him, holding himself up on his elbows so he could look down at his husband.
Whatever the future brought, he had made his own family, and with his magic, he’d protect it.
“Ah! Please, just
“No, Lord Voldemort. It is improper for the Lord of Malfoy to bow before the honored guest in his home, except during ritual exchanges of gifts.” Draco said, taking a few steps forward.
“Very well, Potter. If our marriage is to take a backseat to your war, then War we shall have.”
“I’m sure Hissy-fit gave you the limited account they could understand.” Draco said coolly, eyeing the creature disapprovingly. “Which is why they should have left such an explanation to wizards.”
“Is this at the Burrow?”
Draco snapped his attention to the matter at hand.
“The spell is ‘sino ostium’. You’ll just need to tap your wand to the target, the plate.”
Justin,
“It’s not an
Severus stiffened “I do not say that he has or will. But he has the capacity. And, with this, he has the power.” He held up his arm demonstratively. “I am not comfortable with my life and freedom placed into the hands of another. Even, and especially, a child!”
“Draco. My study seems to have switched masters in my absence.” His father said, with the perfect amount of sardonic amusement coloring his voice, the corner of his mouth twitching upwards slightly as if entertained by some irony. His face looked worn, wrinkled in places it had previously been unblemished, the cheeks hollow and the eyes with only a glimmer of the powerful force that had burned behind them all his life. This worn face was carefully arranged in an expression of simple peace and dignity, the face of a man who has suffered injustice and has come with power to reclaim his own.
Harry looked alarmed, then reached out to steady his husband with a hand on each shoulder.
“I heard about your engagement. A veela.
with only a few layers of cloth between it and Draco’s feverish flesh…Draco reached out a hand, practically feeling the white-hotness of that turgid flesh burning his hand as it approached where he knew it had to be-”

“We’ll have to be careful of that.”
been telling her.” Potter said helplessly.
His bloodline, though, there were those disgusting Durseleys for that.
“Your grandfather, Abraxas, used the very same to suck the life and magic from a captured Light Wizard, this heirloom is known to me! And you have gifted this Dark artifact to Potter?”
“Actually, personal revenge is a much more appropriate way of dealing with these things, Ron.”
NOW, RONALD, I’M SURE YOU’LL BE VERY HAPPY TO HEAR THAT YOUR UNCLE RON WILL BE VISITING FOR CHRISTMAS THIS YEAR. HE’S LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING YOU AGAIN, AS YOU’RE HIS NAMESAKE, AFTER ALL. I’VE PULLED OUT ALL THE OLD PICTURES OF YOU IN YOUR CUTE LITTLE FANNY FLUBBERWORM BLANKIE THAT HE GAVE YOU AT YOUR FIRST BIRTHDAY,
Though, odd, that Jaimie hadn’t seemed to have caught Potter’s attention in that way. He
Draco leaned in and kissed him lightly on the lips.
“Oh right, full name. Lysander Lovegood-Scamander.”
They sat there for a long moment, just looking at each other.
“I want you, Harry. Very much. More than I’ve ever wanted anything, to tell you the truth. Perhaps I’ve wanted you since I first saw you, to hear my mother speak of it – I don’t know. But I certainly want you now. As a friend, as an ally, as my partner, as my husband in bed and in our home, as father to our children. And…more than that, you are…significant to me in a way beyond that…I find that even if I cannot have you as any of those, as I could never have you for the past five years, I find you are important nevertheless, that I habitually define myself in relation to you.”
“I’m a Slytherin and a Malfoy. When have you known either to be
“This will be our home away from home. The place we go when the children are visiting their grandparents, or at school. This is our own little love nest away from it all. Welcome to Mount Erised, Harry.”
A pointing-stab with a slight twist at a mirror and it shattered, followed by another, and another, and another, and another.
“They are part of a larger artifact...very advanced magic. It’s…it’s part of my plan so we can get married, okay?”
Draco considered the phrase. After seeing in the scroll how Potter agonized over the pains of his friends, he knew the Sceptre was the perfect gift for the Gryffindor.
“Yes, I agree.”
end up with their rightful owners.”
"That's not enough." Scrimgeour interjected. "The boy is a known Dark Wizard and the son of You-Know-Who's right hand man. He should be in custody."
Harry turned to his husband.
“We don’t?”
as well, and that our current behavior is an excellent way of getting over the embarrassment…and perhaps learn from our example!”
Draco snapped his finger, and the plates and food vanished. He reached across for Harry’s hand, taking it in both of his own.
“Very well, let’s go into the Emerald Room, Severus.”
These were knotwork charms, set in every single twine of yarn around another…not at all a standard weave, Draco realized. The entire structure of the thing was a masterpiece of knotwork magic, Molly Weasley must have used a knotwork-hook extension for her wand and knitted
Draco smirked yet again, feeling very self-satisfied.
Harry won’t mind! Well you handle Ron and I’ll handle Harry. Yes, yes, anything is better than that horrid pub. Alright, I’ll see you later on this afternoon then, thanks again.”
Draco watched him, saw his drawn face, paled with the implications of his new position of weakness within the family hierarchy. Shadows from months spent in the company of Dementors.

James put a hand to his chin, thoughtfully.
“It wasn’t for me, father.” Cloud explained hastily. He turned to Tom. “Thomas Marvolo Slytherin, meet my father, Lord Blaise Zabini.”
any hidden cameras or recording spells, of course…”
“Just one memory, professor?” Draco asked skeptically.
making such promises, and had access to a state-of-the-art hybrid magical artifacts laboratory, the following dialogue was able to be overheard.
Perhaps the Dark Lord had the right idea after all. Horrendous literature, these muggles had.
The twins shrugged.
“How did Scorpius help? He’s just a baby!” James asked scornfully.
“Quit playing dumb Potter. It
“Jonas…do you have a pen and paper I could borrow?”
Harry’s comforting hand appeared on his shoulder.
“A civil war! That’s…terrible. With the things you’ve mentioned, all the possibilities, I could see that getting pretty horrible with the weapons that must be available to that kind of conflict in your world!”
Potter looked at his best friend helplessly.

Lucius considered his son, then his grandson for a moment.
“Finite Incatatem”
“Uh…I dunno about you, but I actually listed the recipe at the beginning. To take up space, you know.” Potter said, sounding a bit embarrassed.
“I’m not keeping any secrets if it would endanger-”
A snickering arose, and someone coughed the word “Potter” behind their hand. Draco waited for silence again.
have the greatest possible Blood gift in the magical world. Draco was not about to be outbid by some do-gooder Light family.
“And then you’ll be taking a flight to Tokyo!”
Draco felt a buzzing
“Who?”
“Animagus transformation is the ability for a witch or wizard to transform into the form of an animal. It’s very difficult, most wizards and witches never learn how to do it, but Sirius and my father both did it while they were in Hogwarts.” Potter told her.
“Miles… oh you still use English measurements too! That’s two hundred kilometers, though, that sounds terrifying!”
“That’s what house elves are for.”
The two friends smiled at each other, and clasped hands in farewell.
C. Harry Potter (remember Draco's vision about him)
And that was apparently the extent of mushiness the twins would tolerate without comment, and their chorused “awwwww” made Harry burst out into teary laughter.
disciplines, only recently starting to be integrated into the modern magical theories.
this magical courtship business all is!
Dumbledore seemed to suddenly notice the interest the conversation had garnered among the students.
“Does everybody have their wand?”
“I’ll say this once, and only once. The Dark Lord does not mark anyone until they come of age. In Wizarding Britain, that’s 17. None of you will be expected to choose a side until then. My personal advice to you is that you avoid doing so while you have that luxury. Unlike some students I could name from other Houses, who have very nearly died several times as a result.”
Draco nodded.
“I trust you, Draco. Don’t hurt me?”
“Ssssso many timessss, sssso many plansssss curtailed by punissssshments for his ssssloth.” The Planner mourned. “And yet, in thessssse dreamssss, ssssso many delightful ssssseeds of ssssuch delightful ssssschemes. It issss not ussseless, but moderation isss wisssse.”
“He called me in after I’d been here about five minutes.”
The Head Auror blinked again in surprise at how accommodating the Headmaster was to their suspect, but nodded slowly.
Draco frowned at the goblin.
“Professor, I should be out here – he’s here for me, I can’t just hide inside!”
Oh yes, Draco certainly would not mind having Potter’s attentions focused on him this way for quite a good long time. The Hundred-Year-Honeymoon spell would most certainly have to be among the many elements of the alliance, along with the decision of who was to carry the three Heirs they would need to produce for the various lines they represented between them, and of course things like doweries and such.
Draco shut the book and turned in his chair so he could see him. Harry’s face looked troubled, fearful.
my godfather, Professor.” Draco bit out, coldly. The tapping retreated.
“Pansy, go find the American witch and introduce her to some of our girls her age. Do try to be discreet with the portfolio this time, will you?” Draco spelled the American’s background check to separate from the binder and handed it to Pansy.
“You’ll lose everything. Quite possibly your life.”

ceremony to vanquish the Dark Lord, and then of course he’d had time to conjure a temporary mirror in the palm of his hand after Molly Weasley had hugged him.
“With the ferret? You’ve got it bad, mate.” Ron chortled.
Harry swallowed.
“But Hermione
“Most any bird can be trained, Harry. Owls are just more intelligent than most.” Granger lectured. “What’s wrong Ronald?”
“Perhaps we should talk to Tom about what was happening just then? What if one of the Death Eater’s children tried to pledge their loyalty to him?”
would be gold for generations to come, and the Black family name was in dire need of polishing.
Harry blinked at him, horrified.
Of course.
“No.”
Draco looked up at the twins.
“…drinking…”
“My head hurts.” He complained.
“Oh! I am too!”
Draco leaned in for a kiss, then leaned back, gazing down at Harry’s face for a while, a small smile on his mouth.
Draco kissed Harry’s adorable confused mouth.
“…such a charmingly traditional wedding…”
“The fathers ssssspoke of a powerful evil wizard.” The Dreamer mused.
Mr. Weasley was silent for a long time, apparently listening to quite a speech from the other phantom.
he could best get to the boy…and now he just had to wait a few more minutes and the hero of the wizarding world would be, quite literally, in the palm of his hand.
His father sneered.
Draco stared at him.
“NOW!”
Draco leaned forward and kissed Harry on the mouth, and Harry was suddenly devouring him hungrily, his hands eagerly pulling his robes open and exposing Draco’s pale skin to the air and to Harry’s exploring hands and tongue and chewing teeth…and that wildly powerful surge of magic that overloaded his mind with pain and pleasure and insane lust!
“I don’t know but I heard one of the really sixth years was talking about it at dinner, she said it’s better to sleep with the seventh years because what they’ve got in bed is bigger and harder every year, so it’s a growing up thing.” James explained.
“I can’t wait much longer, Potter. I want you. My magic wants yours. And you and your magic want me too. You know it.” He spoke into Potter’s ear, reveling in the way the boy shivered under his breath on his neck.
The twins grew excited at that.
“So we can’t make out here?”
“I see.” Draco opened the book and found an odd chart.
Jonas gave him a disbelieving look.
“Feed the baby, Harry. I’ll see you in a few hours.”
There was a general murmur of assent.
“Fuck. That’s not all.” Draco said. “The second explosion hasn’t gone off yet. If they’re inside, wait, what are you doing?”
would somebody a flower with thorns all over it, the vicious git!” Weasley growled, outraged.
blood! Whoever’s courting him is going to get quite a surprise if they’re successful!”
“What in Merlin’s name is going on here!
“Yes. If you’d been Sorted properly, you’d know how to do that too.”
“Oh Dragon, and you’ve hated each other for years!”
Harry tentatively wrapped his arms back around Draco.
Draco started. He had been very careful, covering his tracks, sneering at all the right times, even staging altercations in the hallways to keep the rumor mill churning with news of who had hexed who.
!” Draco gasped in sudden realization. “It was…it was trying to
“Well I suppose they wouldn’t hurt, at least.”
“A power the Dark Lord knows not, Harry.”
Draco sat back. The message was clear that as Lord he was demanding Lucius withdraw his loyalty to the Dark Lord. And of course, Lucius had no choice. Not unless he would disown himself from the family entirely. And Draco knew his father well enough to know that Lucius was first a Malfoy, and a Death Eater as a far distant second.
“Thanks.” Was all he said.
Draco smirked, pulling the little bundle out and doing a quick scourgify to remove the offending substance.
“Regulus.” He corrected sharply.
“Roses, yes, they were prevalent in some of the muggle literature I sifted through.” Draco agreed. “There was also jewelry…I noticed a hierarchy of jewelries based on the progression of the relationship, leading up to a ring which was symbolic of marriage itself.”
“I certainly can if I can influence the outcome.”
Lucius looked uncomfortable sitting on the seat Draco had taken as a boy, and that Lucius had no doubt taken long ago while Abraxas Malfoy was still Lord.
“Yeah, you’re right. Sorry, mate. You should open it, at least. You can always return it to Malfoy by the end of the day, we’ll help you with the proper polite refusal.”
He caught his father’s habitual sneer as he pulled out the hybrid device to make the call.
“He’s…he’s…” Draco was gaping in disbelief at the blatant favoritism. The Headmaster was
Potter shifted the handkerchief slightly so he could speak.
“And if I don’t choose correctly?”
Harry smirked back at him.
“Lord Voldemort, if I may interject.”
Draco frowned. The wizard was assuming too much.
“Oh. Well. Arthur should be home for dinner any moment now.”
“Potter-Malfoy” he interrupted.
, he swiftly recoiled from a potential danger, throwing the book he’d been pretending to read into the air as a distraction as he smoothly drew his wand and settled expertly into a defensive stance.
“No.”
And handing his book to Blaise to put away, Draco swept quickly out of the common room.
“I know what you’re doing, Malfoy! You’re distracting me by threatening my friends. And it. Pisses. Me. OFF!” Potter hissed into his face, spittle spraying into his eyes.
“She’s different at…home?”
Tom felt upset that someone had apparently been spreading rumors about him being an evil dark wizard, and now the fathers of his new brother believed the lies and would surely try to take Scorpius away from him.
go to Gryffindor, but that may not be best. You and your brother are very close…it might be good to separate you for a bit so you can learn to be your own persons, don’t you think?”
“Yes. I actually found it quite fascinating. It sounds like the Muggles have developed some…theoretical approaches that could be fairly useful in potions making.”
At that moment, Draco’s distinctive Eagle Owl glided into the Great Hall, circling momentarily before landing before a stunned Trio.
“I’m going to have to ask you to put that down.” He said calmly, before handing a pair of handcuffs to Draco.
He paused a moment as a pathetic sob broke from the boy’s throat.
“Sounds like a plan!”
“Effective. I guess I’ll see you tomorrow?”
’s trying to-”
Only one way to put this on footing he was well-equipped to handle.
“Wow, look at you boys! Every time I turn my back, you grow so much I can barely recognize you!” she smiled at them to let  them know she was joking and gave them another hug.
“I…yeah…it can fit two…if you…um…would you want to…” Potter stammered.
“We’re no where near ready to take down Voldemort, Draco. There are things you don’t know. Things that have to be done
“Born as the seventh month dies.”
“That’s not true! I’m not an evil wizard! I’m not!” Tom shouted.
Draco stopped at the foot of the stairs, turning slightly so his face was in profile to his mother.
Especially other people their age.
Draco frowned, second time tonight. He’d have to train her to suppress that reaction.
The deformed creature popped into existence, bowing obsequiously.
Tom frowned.
“To think of all the historically significant diaries…”
Draco nodded approvingly. This would finally be a way to give Blaise the information he needed to choose the winning side without any risk to Draco by revealing it.
An ambulance could be heard just outside the windows as Fred and George unceremoniously dumped their burdens onto the large revolving, heart-shaped bed that dominated the center of the room.
The former Slytherin just nodded in answer.
“There is only the Weasleys. I don’t see how I could possibly cause them to support a union between Potter and Malfoy.” Draco said.
The snake – all three heads – wriggled guiltily.
Flint blinked as if from a daze and shook out his hand, watching a moment as the plant scattered into little bits of crimson light and droplets of blood that spattered, unnoticed, on the older boy’s stubbly chin.
Unless…the Manor had suggested that Potter was somehow an Occlumens…
girly.” Potter complained.
“I’ve been moving assets and heirlooms into one of the family boltholes, Mother.”
Draco found himself smiling softly at the Gryffindor in an entirely unMalfoyish way, but couldn’t bring himself to care. It was just Harry, he wouldn’t tell anyone.

“Specially suited to the receiver, and the situation. They should show attentiveness to the minor needs and wants of the one you are pursuing. I believe the reason Lily finally took James seriously enough to allow him that one date was that he gifted her with a quill that would make a small noise when it needed re-inking – apparently Lily had the frustrating habit of not noticing that she was scratching with a dry quill until she looked down at several lines of fruitless writing.” Narcissa explained.
Harry’s head swung up at that.
“Catena animus” a low voice incanted from the doorway
“Tell me I’m right.”
“No, that’s cool, I’d love to see your familiar. What’s it’s name?”
“Only till Beltaine.” He muttered to himself, locking the door behind him.
Then his political adversaries:
Harry’s cheeks blushed lightly.
“That’s not very nice.”
“I’ve warded a little corner of Hufflepuff Heaven for myself and am resisting the urge to go check on the twins.”
“So people just fly around on them? It seems hard to get away from a flimsy piece of magical wood as the only thing between you and the ground!”
“A little…” Potter said timidly. “But if we have the recipe-”
“The battlefield marriage.” Harry said numbly.
“Too late, he already ate it!”
“No offense Draco, but your mother doesn’t seem very…motherly.”
“The Wizengamot will order you to.”
“Manners, Potter.
“Prolixe arbitra Narcissa Malfoy nee Black” Narcissa echoed.
“What? That’s ridiculous! And how would you know?” Pansy asked.
are Gryffindors!”
Harry led the way to a deserted classroom and locked them in with an assortment of anti-eavesdropping charms that made Draco raise his eyebrows.
“And he had to-, oh.” Tom looked at the beaten old man sleeping on the couch.
“Are you okay? Oh my god, why did you have to create something like that for me? I could have borne Cruciatus, I have before!” Potter said, distressed, trying to massage Draco’s face into answering.
“Most rash indeed, Lord Malfoy! Perhaps instead I could interest you in a new invention we have stolen from the Muggle world. It is called a credit stone, most of the more expensive shops now have the means to deduct an amount directly from your account simply by you placing your official Gringotts credit stone on their counter and tapping it with your wand!” the goblin hurried on excitedly.
to kill him.”
“Um. Well actually…that is…maybe that’s okay. I mean, you’re doing okay, so far.” He stammered.
“Defende in proelio.”
“You’re late, Potter.” Draco said, not bothering to look up from the menu in his hands.
“Draco, are we forgetting something? We must be forgetting something!”
“The body is made of elm wood. The core is the heartstring from a dragon.”
“My grandfather Abraxas betrayed the friendship he had with your father Bilius.”
Draco leaned close to his father. Perhaps it was time to draw him in, again. Lucius needed a reason to live again, something to work towards. The telling of a secret might be the start.
Jamie looked shocked.
“Then why the hell did Sirius give it to me?”
“Depends what kind of dreaming you’re trying to use them for!”
Lysander beckoned to the knob.
Tom hesitated a moment, then handed the child over willingly.
“Can’t I be? Do I have to cast the deadly curse, or is it sufficient to provide the opportunity for personal vengeance?”
Potter paused in the middle of a sentence, mouth…half-chewed contents lodged inside…hanging open for a moment as he pinned Draco with his green-eyed gaze. Then the moment passed and something the Weasel said got his attention again.
“You put them in there, Dad.” Regulus informed him, rolling his eyes again.
A. Tom Riddle (experimenting with an "odd bit of magic")
If he lived long enough.
Lucius and the other students ignored her as they sized each other up.
“Zabini.” Draco said his friend’s name, casually. Blaise turned to him and raised an eyebrow. Draco raised his chin and allowed the corner of his lips to tip up slightly. Blaise nodded in understanding and followed Draco and Professor Snape to his office.
Draco slowly stood, ignoring the ruin around him as his eyes scanned the area where what used to be his desk stood.
She let a pregnant moment pass before answering very quietly.
“Sssssecretsss that concern
“The fact that you exist proves there was once something good about Tom Riddle…at one point he was capable of love. That part survived. And that part is who you are, Tom.” Harry said gently.
their Papa called them, and their Dad would get a very upset look on his face like it hurt him to talk about things.
“About Potter. About the Dark Lord. About this bloody war and who’s going to win it?”
Draco took a deep breath, accidentally muddling his head with those befuddlement fumes again.
Draco smirked.
“What could you need to contact Harry so urgently for?”
“You must be Tom Riddle.” She observed, stepping smoothly toward the grand staircase that led up to the balcony. “I am Jamina Black, I hope you’ll call me Jamie like these two.”
Draco thought frantically. Under Veritaserum he might reveal his knowledge of the Horcruxes! He met the Headmasters eye.
an enemy at the same time?
The Slytherins gaped at him.
“Draco Malfoy. I know Harry looks up to you as almost a father-figure, I’m pleased to meet you as well. During the day. I…don’t do well around werewolves. Fenrir-”
“There’s one for each of us, you know. That’s how ninjas work.”
“Please be my guest, Mr. Malfoy.”
Draco frowned and swiftly made his way to his study.
The “Ritual Proper” list, however, was baffling.
His eyes, trained intently on the top of Potter’s head, and the curve of his jaw that he could see, and the delicious curve of his neck and just part of one shoulder…watching for any tension, any reaction.
“They’re going to kill us all anyways. Might as well get one of them, first.” James said solemnly.
Draco backed off regretfully. He was feeling the same buzzing as well.
“I have to agree with your father, sons.” Draco added. “And after you get your wands, before Hogwarts, we’re going to perform a secrecy ritual to make sure you don’t let slip Thomas’ identity to anyone. Not
“Thank you for tonight.” He said simply.
The twins, shaken at seeing their father so afraid, instantly disappeared to their rooms.
“Get the fuck out of here, ferret! Or I’ll turn you into a, into a little white rat!”
“You want him.” She observed quietly. “This is about you as much as it is about Malfoy.”
Draco looked away. The scene made him oddly uncomfortable. In any case, he’d seen enough.
The three heads conferred for a moment.
“But he hassss them anywayssss, young Lord Malfoy! Why do you ssseeek to dissstract me from thisss necesssssary disssposal?”
“As usual.”
Draco just waited silently until the room was empty.
it’s not just a sweater! Do
Ten minutes later, Draco was feeling very bored, and very annoyed with the silent Potter, who kept
“Two guests
“Oh, but the reverse is true as well,” he murmured with a sly grin.
So. The Dark Lord truly did dream of a brighter future for the wizarding world, and not one based on endless torture and pain. He wished for respect.
“Madame Granger-Weasley, I apologize for the interruption. There has been an…anomaly.”
“Oh no, if he’s going to be having
Now to find Potter. Draco wanted to set the foundation of the spell now, away from the interfering old man who apparently had the ability to sense new spells occurring around him.
“How to Win Your Mate All Over Again”…was clearly not relevant, as he and Potter were both quite human
Draco smirked, ignoring that he was probably in a similar condition.
Draco couldn’t imagine a space around him where another person could possibly fit in the room. Little rodents indeed.
Fred and George goosed Draco from behind and each caught him in a one-armed hug from each side.
It had been nearly twelve years since his impetuous godson had stormed his way into the delicate balance he’d struck between two terrifying powers, revealed the third power in the form of a completely unaware Harry Potter waiting in the wings, and proceeded to methodically tie the tightrope of Severus’ life into knots upon knots with layers of blackmail, deceptions wrapped in half-truths, ritual magic wrapped in seduction, and ultimately, miraculously, cheated the Dark Lord out of both his Horcruxes and his life.
that!”
“In that case, I would like to make a sizeable withdrawal.” Draco said, ice in his voice once again.
The picture of Potter was still trying to avoid coming too close to the surface of the portrait. Draco took a deep breath and tapped his wand on the sigil of the single red drop.
“Well done, very well done, my young Lord Malfoy. Has Dumbledore also been disposed of?”
“Do you think they’re cursed?”
“I know it’s hard, Reggie. I’m so sorry I had to sit and watch that happen to you and Jamie” he whispered fiercely. “It’ll get better with time, I promise. And you’ll still see him all the time. Think of it as you two splitting up for one of your plans. You both get to learn things and make friends separately, and then the two of you will know twice as much and have twice the crowd between you!”
“Yes, Professor.”
“We thought we had destroyed him entirely. The Dark Lord was conceived out of rape, and later embraced the hatred that act founded. He could not co-exist with love, and was destroyed by that brand of magic.” Draco finished.
have heirs…we will need a very powerful magical bonding, and the most powerful bondings have as their basis a consummation out of virginity.”
Arthur’s voice was hollow. This was clearly the first time he had heard this story of his fathers.
against him.
“You’re not going to do him any good sulking about, you know.”
~Percy Weasley~
Harry looked at Draco quizzically.
“But-”
~Tom Riddle~
“Go on, Harry.”
Draco glowered at the wolf, pointing an accusing finger at it.
“Um…”
“My mother, or Bellatrix, or Jaime, or I, can’t handle the ancestral magics either, because only
Oh. Well…
! Do not speak of those butcher in my house! Dentists are some of the very worst Muggle travesties of so-called medical expertise in existence!”
“But James just…just went with it!” Regulus cried, frustrated tears burning again.
“Which course of study?” he quizzed.
Whoever had come up with the name for the collection could be tortured later for their insolence, Draco decided. Preferably before the actual marriage, as he supposed his future husband would probably make the cessation of such behavior one of the conditions of the contract.
A whistle of wind from the dark tunnel slices through the enclosed area, causing bits of paper to whirl aimlessly for a moment.
“Surely the Dark Lord could not have offered a greater reward than the power he offered me as his Right Hand!”
Bill snapped out of it, and gave a sheepish grin.
“He’s the Heir of Slytherin. Not liking sex is not an excuse for failing to produce a blooded Heir.”
“I…it’s beautiful.” He said simply.
guidance in this matter. But I would urge you to think carefully and avoid irreversible decisions. Particularly the risky ones.” Severus said, guiding him to the door.
The two stared each other down for a moment.
Harry had just snatched up the Crystal Sceptre, and said something to Weasley that left him gaping like a fish, and swept out of the Great Hall, the rose still clutched in one bloody hand.
“…and lots of wild sex!”
“Fine. But…be careful, mate. Okay? Don’t let him alone with your food, right?”
“I’d have to be stupid to turn my back on a Malfoy. Especially one I’m in love with.”
Tom kept his voice warm, signaling this would be a recurring humiliation but one delivered gently, a tease that could be affectionate if his favor was maintained. For an already awed-over boy like Orpheus Greengrass, Draco had assured him, such a mixture of treatment in combination with the familial debt itself would engender a persistent desire to please him, if carefully tended.
Then…Sirius Black himself…
Harry and Draco sat up shakily, supporting each other as they watched the twins warily.
cunning. Let me be cunning for you, trust me enough to do the things you’d rather avoid doing. If you
don’t be dead…I can’t stand it if you…oh god…what’s
“You’re late, Malfoy.” Hermione Granger snapped as he entered the compartment.
“You’re right. I wonder why nobody ever thought of that.” Draco said slowly. “Merlin…he’s going to be…why has nobody thought of that?”
There was a long silence, broken only by Potter’s labored breathing through the handkerchief.
, Draco?”
- - - - -
“You were spying at James’ behest, then.” Harry surmised.
Harry Potter had his back to him as he removed the last of his clothing, the pale globes of his un-tanned bottom flashing briefly before Potter slipped into the water, grunting as the scalding water enveloped him.
“Prove it
“Mind your volume!” Draco hissed at her, before continuing in a more normal voice. “In any case, there’s a difference between making friends with Gryffindors and turning
“Keep telling yourself that, Malfoy. Maybe it’ll happen one day in your dreams.” Potter snapped back.
When they were dressed, Draco cast a warming charm on each of them then headed for the entrance.
The chunk of nickel slowly turned over inside the mixture, and began to sink. Through the base of the aluminum pan.
Yes, he was clearly correct. A white, rectangular box. No doubt containing something dangerously tasty. Hopefully fudge.
Potter was suddenly free from Nagini’s coils, and the Dark Lord was screaming in rage behind them as Potter quickly rolled so Draco was splayed under him, legs open and wrapped around him, his manhood still poised at the entrance.
“What’s wrong?”
~Cornelius Fudge~
Regulus Sirius Potter-Malfoy Black eyed the strange boy with suspicion.
in the alliance. And the greatest investment, the closest thing to
Draco grunted furiously at that, and Ron beamed at him.
“There’s a reason it’s called Dark magic. This is the least objectionable form of that ritual that is possible to perform.” He told her.
“And this is Scorpius Hyperion Potter-Malfoy!” he said the name with some relish, lifting the blanket so that she could admire the white-blond hair and the Lily-Potter-green eyes.
“But…Hermione, just imagine, I’d
“Fifty points from Gryffindor for endangering of a fellow student! And you both have detention with me
Lucius’ shock was only partly hidden as he took the boy’s hand and gripped it firmly.
Draco stared at him. The boy was daft. A bastard Lord of Black? He had no idea what he was saying.
“But Reggie’s always been my best friend.”
Jamie surveyed his exhausted state.
“What does it do?”
“Go ahead Jamie, I’ll catch up.”
He turned to the room, raising his voice to address them all.
~Dudley Dursley~
such guests enter the prefects bath.” Draco said smoothly.
“I am extremely busy, so I will make this brief. Many of the other teachers do not like Slytherins, and will treat you unfairly. I hope your Prefects have explained the reasons for this. I expect you to respond to their foolishness with respect and dignity as befits your status. You may complain to your Prefects, or if you think it is
Harry watched the too boys walk away together, feeling a sudden rush of his own memories of childhood introductions on this very platform.
year?”
“Trust me, I’m only doing this to make it better for you.” Draco said, right into his ear again. He could smell Harry’s aftershave potion, twice as strong as it was that night under the Cloak. He’d been hard as a rock since he’d started the delicate task of navigating a safe path among dinner-plate sized petals, oak-tree sized candlesticks, and one gigantic rose covered in thorns the length of his arm.
Draco had been brooding, hardcore, ever since viewing the troubling (and rather arousing) Pensieve memory that morning.
Lord would torture you for the source of it, Lucius.”
“Don’t press him about it, Harry. Please? Let him think you told me?” Draco appealed.
“You intend to still oppose him?” Lucius asked, incredulous.
?” He screwed up his face and gave Tom a stern look before lecturing in a very high, squeaky voice. “Infants are very fragile, maybe one day I will let you hold Scorpius…if you prove yourself
From deep inside him issued only a barely audible groan that carried every iota of feeling the young Malfoy had ever allowed himself to feel.
James Remus Potter-Malfoy peeked around the corner, his balled fist held up next to his shoulder in a signal he’d learned from his godmother’s television.
Granger looked at him carefully.
“Good morning. You must be Jamina,” Draco said, ignoring the glares from the studious types all around.
me.” Draco said conversationally as he unbuttoned his robes. He was naked underneath, as Potter would soon discover. “I don’t need your verbal agreement. The magic demands only
“Oh. Oh my. But what if you cannot gain his contract?”
But…where was this hopeless romantic interest?
“He won’t refuse. The ritual I have chosen will give him a choice of accepting or destroying the one he most desires.”
“So he can tell you about your father.” Draco told her. “And it’s family business. I’ll get you permission to go.”
Ah yes. Tipsy had been called directly from her rooms, where no doubt his mother had been reorganizing her jewelry or taking a bath or having tea or some such nonsense.
“No. Farther again.”
A statuesque woman with curly brown hair was projecting her voice with some presumably Muggle version of an amplification charm.
“One of those perks is…‘perking’ up about now.” Draco noted.
“What is this, Malfoy!”
“No. Actually, You’re Fred, and you’re George.” Draco said calmly.
“What is it?” Seymour asked, eagerly.
“Surely you don’t mean that old fool! Draco, what have you
“I don’t think you need to be worried about becoming another Dark Lord, Harry. Even if you
“How long?” Mrs. Weasley demanded.
So. Granger would have to be offered a specific project. Probably put in charge of the project, considering her rather controlling personality. And…a project she would find interesting. Perhaps her interest would be snagged by a project to combine Muggle and magical theories for potions making?
“Yes. No. Wait. There’s also this.”
“I’ll speak with your supervisor, then.” Draco said coldly.
Lucius pulled a hunk of nickel out of the correct container.
“As will I, father.” Cloud said, looking up into Mr. Zabini’s face intently for a moment. Then the moment was gone and Cloud turned back to Tom, ushering him comfortably towards the big red engine Tom had seen twice before.
“Yeah, well he
The groans from the Gryffindor side of the room made the Slytherins snicker.
“In any case, I really don’t think it’s relevant. We need to start negotiating a marriage contract now. For heaven’s sake Potter, you’re nearly an adult, this needs to be settled before you start getting
“Uh…let me be in front, if that’s okay.” He said.
Tom shook his head and offered his hand.
customers, such as yourself, Lord Malfoy, we have newly developed a-”
Regulus felt some bit of tension in his back soften as his brother sat down and put on the hat. There was something indefinably wrong about his brother being out of arms reach – he felt as if he couldn’t quite interact properly with others without the twin-dynamic playing its role.
Potter hesitated only a second before stepping swiftly to his right, Draco’s left, pivoting clockwise. Draco moved smoothly with him so that their fields of vision were perfectly aligned in opposite directions during the entire move, barely an inch of space coming between their bodies during the entire procedure.
“Who are they?” Draco asked.
Then, finally it was James’ turn.
evil.” Tom muttered rebelliously.
Draco Malfoy-Potter placed his youngest son in his crib and smiled down at him as the baby cooed and waved his little arms. Scorpius Malfoy, the final heir of their three fortunes. And brought into existence without Draco having to gain a pound, to boot.
“Good. Now get on out of here.” He said, looking after her fondly as she scampered away.
[I claim the Malfoy title]
“HOOOOOONKK!” They were jerked from their reverent embrace by the sound of the Weasley twins blowing party favors that
“Draco…”
“You know I do.”
“Come on, Potter.”
Draco slipped a finger along the edge of the pages, watching as they fanned past, hoping for some chart like that Periodic Table in the chemistry book.
“Slytherins are too stuffy, I want to have fun!” James insisted.
“Harsh, man.” Lysander didn’t take back his, or her, hand – instead it moved to rest comfortably on Regulus’ foot, picking absently at his laces as they talked. “Look, I know the score, right? People who get born alone just don’t get it. Especially that bloody Hat. It really sucks, and, like, no warning, right? Just, bam! And you’re on your own, and they all think it’s the best thing for you. Like, they genuinely believe it. No clue, man. None at all.”
Draco tossed in a handful of sulfur, a common intent-marker for Dark potions, and leaned forward to inhale the fumes that rose as the sulfur boiled into the glowing bile. He took a deep breath of the caustic fumes and exhaled the next incantation into the cauldron.
“RETURN THIS PARCEL TO ITS RIGHTFUL LORD IMMEDIATELY, YOU DESPICABLE THIEF! HOW DARE YOU TAMPER WITH MATTERS ABOVE YOUR STATION!”
Moody blinked in surprise.
“Harry. We’ve done this the wizarding way, but some Muggle traditions have their sentimental value too.”
“I spend a perfectly reasonable amount of time-”
“Come, we’ll watch over him and get some sleep tonight.
The last time that had been necessary was after the second fall of Napoleon. Dark Lords seemed to have a confusing habit of having to be defeated more than once.
“Oh! Well…perhaps Proposition four-twenty-seven isn’t such a great idea then.” Granger said, a bit haltingly.
Draco stood gracefully from his seat, rounding the table to stand right in front of Potter.
Pomfrey raised an eyebrow at the stupid question, while Draco rolled his eyes at his husband’s naivette.
Draco bent double, supporting his weight with a hand in the gooey mess on Harry’s heaving chest. Both of them panting to catch their breath.
“I intend to remain publicly neutral until the very last moment, but I do need both an ear and a voice in the Dark Lord’s inner circle. So, yes. A spy.”
“Avada Kadavra!”
“The Hat wanted to put me in Slytherin.” He revealed quietly.
“…but we heard them say they’d switch for this one…”
“Vulnus Vigoratus” Arthur intoned.
Starting a few feet from that, two neat rows of long white candles in finely carved gold holders were lined up like pillars, all the way down the length of the table to the right end, where a lovely setting for an intimate dinner was lovingly set up.
There was a long silence.
He opened his robe and touched his wand to his manhood and muttering a quick spell to get this last part started.
“Gryffindor’s Luck.” Draco muttered, thinking of Potter’s bloodline.
“Move the bassinet into our bedroom, please. Right next to our bed.”
“Barring the use of Veritaserum…I don’t think so. The existence of Horcruxes is so obscure that we only found out about them through some very extreme means. Magic will respond to the name and lineage that you rightfully claim. You understand you’ll likely be subjected to some very artful interrogation by your fellow students…and anyone else you come into contact with?”
"I'm willing to step outside." the politician said. The last thing he wanted was to be a direct part of an illegal interrogation by Veritaserum.
The boys leaned forward expectantly.
“Why yes. I think our need for your find institution’s services has quite come to an end. We will of course keep the accounts and vaults open, with a token amount inside, but the bulk of our assets we will be removing to another location.” Draco said calmly.
Harry tentatively poked at the package before carefully tearing the wrapping from it.
Draco took his shocked husband’s hand and kissed it before gently drawing him towards the door of the cottage.
“Could he have attracted followers so quickly? Children that age are impressionable, could something like that make the Marks react? We don’t know nearly enough about how they work.” Hermione said.
“That wouldn’t even work, Malfoy!” Potter continued to sputter.
“Actually, I’d rather decided I don’t like tattoos.” Draco said coolly.
“He placed his hands on my heir, of course I had to intervene. I must confess I am curious as to where in the magical world you and your family have been hidden? There hasn’t been an heir of Slytherin since the Dark Lord, and I am quite certain he did not produce an heir of his own. Who are your parents?”
Several hundred yards away a small group of people were running towards them…Dumbledore the lead. The Portkeyed wedding guests.
“Tell me, Harry.”
“I don’t know. The Patils got separated in our year, they were pretty close but they managed.” Harry whispered back.
“Ancestors Malfoy offer this token to the Seed of Potter-”
Draco smirked.
Draco found it interesting that his mother thought he would find Lucius in his study. The former Lord would certainly not be able to enter it without his express permission, after all.
“Jonas, you may call me Lucius. I’ve been to Boston on business, it’s an absolutely charming town I must say.”
- - - - -
of Slytherin House, some decorum is expected in public.” He told her severely.
Potter, as it is!”
Draco shifted and moved his face down to press against Harry’s solid stomach.
Harry was looking at him now, and Draco felt the pain and distrust in them stabbing into him more painfully than he’d ever imagined.
Draco had, of course, excluded from the list all the physical intimacies from handholding to lewdly described sexual acts…although some of those descriptions sounded anatomically challenging enough that Draco wondered if they were part of some bizarre muggle ritual.
“Dizzy.”
“So, everybody’s here. I’ll just come out and say it – Lucius and Severus have both reported their Marks went active today. We’ve got to figure out why, and if there’s a threat what to do about it.”
Tom made note of the group exhibiting stunned disbelief. There were enough witnesses to his display at Kings Cross that word would have gotten around, and it’d been a full ten seconds since Slytherin’s crest had appeared.
“Based on your predecessor’s performance, I suspect you may have some natural talent for the art.” Dumbledore continued, ignoring the interruption.
Harry paled, standing sharply to his feet.
Tom considered this. So the creature was a magical type of snake. Which explained why he could speak to it. And a familiar to one of the two thugs who’d claimed to be brothers to Scorpius.
“That’s beside the point.” Granger said dismissively, “Harry has just as much right to remember Sirius as his daughter. She never even knew him, it’s not like she missed him!”
Severus Snape bored into him with his eyes, finding the shield in place and giving up the Legilmency. His head tipped slowly in a nod of respect.
“Mr. Malfoy! Come in, come in my boy!” The Headmaster’s eyes twinkled that infuriating all-knowing twinkle at him as he came to sit. Draco had no doubt the Headmaster knew why he was here. Even if Potter had not told him, the history of the Crystal Sceptre was something the man would be intimately aware of, since his grandfather had used it in Grindelwald’s service.
Draco ran his finger along the words, chuckling softly.
“Shit! Those spells will never keep
“Severus! We told you he’s
“Are already impressed by the official one.” Harry finished, laying a finger on Draco’s lips.
His father’s face relaxed neatly into a look of peaceful contemplation at the news, followed by sharp understanding. There was a slight snap of disgruntlement in the very depths of the grey eyes that only Draco would have caught.
Draco! The
No. Don’t think that. Someone would come.
“Jamie. I
“Ever the thirst for knowledge, eh, Tom? I suppose some things will never change! Hopefully this time you’ll bend your considerable talents to better goals, I hope?”
Lucius had been…difficult since the war. He was still technically a fugitive, though Harry had managed to pull strings to assure a lack of proactive effort to recapture him.
“I seek to place myself in a situation that is perilous if I am not
“And so the proposition carries. The Jelly-Legs Hex is heretofore reclassified as a Schedule B Hex with a maximum punishment of five house points, unless carried out against a student more than three years junior to the perpetrator.” Anthony Goldstein, the clerk of this meeting, announced.
A forbidden and hopeless crush, then.
“Hi Reggie.”
“Harry! Where is your invisibility cloak?” he asked his husband tensely.
“Marvelous feat of magic, of course. Draco, I don’t believe I’ve ever hear of a more perfectly executed piece of bond-magic in all my studies. Masterful. Dangerous, but very well done. And integrated so smoothly with the courtship ritual too. The staged betrayal, the concealed revelation, the emotions plucked so neatly from both of you for the perfect magical mixture. Lovely work, just lovely.” Dumbledore rambled.
“Granger, Goyle. Thomas, Crabbe.”
He was sure the Malfoy family could survive such a persecution, they had before. But…three generations holed away underground would mean inbreeding and dissociation from the Wizarding world – resulting in genetic weaknesses and a complete loss of political power.

“Hermione told me the transference only works if it’s fully voluntary. I won’t do it.” Potter said evenly.
“Stand down, Moody. If he tries to run, you can hex him. Otherwise, keep your wand at your side.” Shacklebolt ordered.
Cloud just gave him a mock scowl.
Somehow Draco didn’t see Potter reacting positively to the pathetic stratagems illustrated in the trashy literature he’d uncovered so far. Draco was sure these horrid tales had some connection to the, no doubt, nonsensical pre-negotiation courtship rituals that Potter would expect of him.
“Yes, well all very well and good in a courtroom or at Gringotts but this is right here on a platform! You can’t just going around casting blood-magic whenever you feel like it and then say it’s alright because it’s a birthright charm! There’s no reason to even use such a thing here on the platform!” The man blustered.
Draco wasn’t nearly finished.
“How did Granger
“It is a hybrid of the old Celtic handfastings ceremony and the Saxxon-Latin Soul-Bond Ritual, using a number of symbolic and potions-based factors to increase the influence of the bond without sacrificing identity.”
“But I still intend to…
“I wish you the best of luck. I expect you’ll need it.” He shook Bill’s hand firmly. “But then, you
“Should be out here. Aurors can’t apparate. Time.” Draco said.
“My ancestor humbly begs forgiveness for his betrayal, if only he could be told his crime.”
“Now…let’s see what the excitement is about…”
Harry Potter? Is he
“Yes we do. The Black Heir will spend his first year in the House of Black.”
“I did. That’s the problem.”
“What’s in it for you?”
Harry Potter.” He shrugged elegantly.
“Hey!”
Draco smiled down proudly at his heir.
“Ugh!” Potter moaned.
“I will try to give you the muggle fantasies you’ve grown up with. Mixed with the proper wizarding protocols, of course.” Draco sniffed. “All
Then Potter let out a sudden yell, and stumbled in Draco’s arms, hissing in pain, a hand clamped to his forehead.
“But he won’t know we gave him Puff if he’s asleep!”
Blaise let out another long whistling breath.
prestigious line, as close to royalty as you’ll find in wizarding Britain. The only issue with that name is…there are those who will want to know your exact lineage.”
“Actually, I agree its very rude of you to continue calling me that, considering I’ve been calling you by your given name.” Draco interjected smoothly, ignoring the wands that had been quickly drawn and pointed at him.
Then the man was on them, grabbing Cloud by the collar, and proceeding to shout into his face.
The scar was leaking blood, which was smeared across his face.
For a moment Draco doubted himself.
Potter! Our bloodlines, his mother was a Mudblood! You would
Dumbledore frowned.
“Power, Potter. You can talk about Light and Dark all you like, but in the end it comes down to Power, and those who are too weak to see it. You have…
to be a potion. Perhaps some weaker variant of the befuddlement drought they’d sabotaged that morning, worn to celebrate the occasion?
“Think about the incident from beginning to end, and push that memory towards the front of your mind. I’m going to pull it out with my wand.”
“Harry, we have to stop!” Draco hissed just as Harry started to push onward, and suddenly they were both freezing cold as the anti-penetration spell Draco had taken to placing on himself every morning activated.
Thomas shrugged. After walking in on his future dormmate doing something that could only be called “extremely precocious for their age”, providing the necessary knowledge was a favor to himself more than anyone. Leveraging the exchange for his preferred accomodations made the deal all the more advantageous.
Again it was the Gryffindor who broke the silence.
Draco smiled his coldest smile, concentrating on the impenetrable wall of a glacier he’d seen on vacation two summers ago.
The Slytherins, except for Draco, shrank back under the invisible weight of that power. Draco could feel the pressure too, like Potter’s power was pushing out from his body, pushing the air forward so that it
“I… he said I have to kill Malfoy, and do it publicly, declaring how the Malfoy led Nott to ruin and then walked away the victor for the other side. To bring judgment for bad faith.”
“Not the Dark Lord.” Draco corrected. “He truly is vanquished. But, Harry, there’s something Dumbledore never told you about him. About his Horcruxes.”
“Merlin! That’s…my father compiled detailed reports on just about everyone who’s anyone, didn’t he?”
“You’re not James.”
“That will gain you the werewolf.” Narcissa noted.
But Draco was a Malfoy. Malfoys
The note that would accompany the first gift was a work of art in itself. Intricate swirls of calligraphy covered the rich gold parchment, gracefully drawing the eye to the words themselves.
“You? I hear tales of your rivalry in Hogwarts even here! You are no confidant to Harry Potter!”
“Or maybe, this afternoon, hey Potter?”
The twins eagerly chimed agreement, of course. They’d figure out the loopholes in that promise later.
? The boy-who-lived? He’s just a symbol. I’ve dueled him, he’s no threat to one such as you.” Draco sneered.
“POTTER!” Draco hissed in horror as the forbidden name came so effortlessly out of the boy’s mouth.
“Draco.” Draco corrected.
They stood back-to-back again, and Draco this time stepped to his right, going in the same direction as they’d gone before, pivoting counterclockwise. No new targets. Potter followed, and had to banish a random monster the Dark Lord had brought as part of his army.
“I have a feeling you don’t quite understand the purpose of this mission.” He said sourly.
Draco looked steadily at her.
Draco ate. In fact, he ate three servings. There were no appetizers, no entrees, no salads, just an endless amount of the same stew. It was
“I can do that.”
“What was it?”
Cloud laughed, realizing what he’d just said.
Ron’s mouth dropped open in horror at the mention of penetrative intercourse in the same sentence as his mother. Then dropped open again as the second half of that sentence struck him.
“I’m not expecting an answer right away.” Draco said. “Take your time to think about it. Not
“What?”
Draco didn’t like where this was going.
“You haven’t even gotten on the train and you’re in the middle of a ruckus. May I ask what could possibly cause you to cast a birthright charm in the middle of the platform like a beggar?”
“Yes what?” Draco squeezed harder.
“Well, the artifacts in question were all actually themselves stolen, and I intend to return them to their proper owners.”
The brass pan froze mid-swing, and once again Draco had to suppress a twinge of awe at the wrist strength that precipitated complete control over the instrument.
“I don’t want to live in Malfoy Manor.” Harry started off.
Clever girl.
Draco was getting a very uncomfortable feeling from the picture, somehow. Then he saw it. The picture flickered.
“Did you know? Did you already
“At least there’s no shame in losing out to Beneficium Superus.”
Draco allowed the corner of his mouth to turn up in a slight sneer. His best friend looked away.
“So you’re part of the Dark Lord?” Regulus interrogated ruthlessly. Tommy cringed.
Tom quickly turned to the Critic.
“You bargain well. And you’re right, it was wandless magic, focused. Clearly not overtly intentional. I doubt the boy even knows what he’s capable of.” Severus observed.
“Uh…actually…
“But what was that?”
out!” Draco whispered into Potter’s warm hand.
“I’ll get you a note.”
Harry went silent at that, and Draco squeezed his shoulder reassuringly.
of all people about the sexual side-effects of intercourse with a being as powerful as Potter!” Draco snapped.
“I believe we’ll be seeing Thomas quite soon. If he’s made the impression in Slytherin we expect of him, he’ll have been delayed for a few minutes for some last-minute alliances with leadership figures. Now as a Malfoy, I’m sure you realize that you are also expected to make it into Slytherin, so I want you to pay close attention to your brother as a role model, and try not to learn too much from those other three ruffians. Always remember, my son, be as wise as a serpent, so the lovable fools can be the innocent doves.”
Tom gave her a small smile. She was smart, he could already tell. Tom liked smart people.
After the memory had played itself out Severus carefully extricated himself from Draco’s mind.
Draco closed the scroll and ascended the stairs to his office.
And now, the Potters were suddenly back on the scene, their previous disgrace quite muted by the fact that the Lord Potter was also the Lord of the Great and Noble House of Black…and the bloody Boy-Who-Lived…and on top of those was now being publicly acknowledged by an unknown suitor as the Heir of either Gryffindor or Slytherin, depending on who you asked.
“It’s a fairly common practice Potter. You have the Black title, and no Black blood. That has very bad magical consequences for the House of Black. There’s really only one way to fix it. I have it on good authority that you despise my Aunt. Unless you’re harboring some secret plot to steal my mother while Father is in Azkaban, Jamie is really your best candidate.”
Not content with the magical application, Draco took hold of the solid doors of his wardrobe and tugged it forward, willing the sturdy furniture to fall forward and break into pieces.
“Oh my god, I wish you wouldn’t do that...”
expect the contents of our vaults will be ready by then.”
“But that’s the Sixth Law of Magical Dynamics!”
“Exactly.”
“Overpower?”
“Jamie, how do you like Potter?” Draco cut him off, turning to his cousin with an eyebrow raised.
James watched as his brother flattened himself against the wall and…ever so carefully, edged his head outward for a look.
? I’ve made numerous demands that the place be given over to Bellatrix or Narcissa, to no use!”
, of course, but extremely respectable.”
Potter winced again.
“Fidelius.”
this was Molly Weasley after all, nutrient-enhancement and appetite accelerant charms.
“You said I had to…”
! We must
Draco smiled wickedly at the Gryffindor.
“What do you think, Draco?”
“So what should I do if I’m not a blood-heir to anything but Riddle?”
“What do you mean by much more powerful? More powerful than the Dark Lord?” Blaise asked.
Draco heard Blaise cursing under his breath, quickly joined by Pansy as she was joined with Weasley..
Malfoy just sat, watching him as he finished his rant and sat back down. He let the silence stretch for a long moment, then spoke.
Draco let his legs slide up Potter’s sides, feeling his body shudder and his magic burn into his thighs, then leant down so they were face to face.
“Jamie’s fine. You know your Aunt Tonks is his Head of House, she’ll look after him for you.”
“Hmm…Potter-Malfoy, eh? I knew those two had it in for each other from the start. So let’s have a good look at you…you’re certainly quite cunning, but you let your brother redirect your cleverness into pranks I see. Hufflepuff would be better for you than Slytherin, certainly. I see you’re a very curious lad but I can see you don’t care for books or book-learning, you want to experience things directly. Definitely Gryffindor over Ravenclaw. Now I can see you’re mostly a pleasant fellow but you’re more interested in protecting those you already care about than meeting new friends. Hmm, yes you’re loyal but to a select few, and quite fierce about those…with that lust for excitement and adventure, you’d better be a GRYFFINDOR!”
“No need. I knew exactly what memories to give you.” His godfather sneered, handing him a single vial. Clearly still pissed off, despite the assurance of the Vow. The man clearly hated to be backed into a corner.
Harry shivered and shook his head.
Harry’s eyes opened, pinning Draco’s once again.
“But…I didn’t mean to sell anything, there’s no need to pay. I
“Cloud of Zabini.”
“I never did thank you…
“Gentlemen, I think this is quite enough public discussion. Lord Malfoy, if you would, please join us in my office?” Dumbledore said politely.
Then that same furious face was inches away, like a looming planet, and for the first time he noticed the green eyes were the same shade as the killing curse.
“Legilmens.”
“ENOUGH!” He shouted, the magic somehow twisting his voice into a deep and powerful bellow that shook the corridor in a way that wasn’t caused by the movement of the train.
“Of course. Memories of her father, remember?” Draco raised an eyebrow at him. “And of course, as her nearest relative I’ll be financing her end of the bargain.”
“Melin! ‘Mione, those swans aren’t delivering just any package! This is…I wonder who it’s for.”
“Potter. Just who I wanted to see. Jamie expressed an interest in speaking to you about her father.”
There was nobody there, of course.
Harry suddenly seemed to notice the entire Hall was looking at him and blushed crimson, turning his attention to his plate. In moments, the Ravenclaws resumed their debates, the Gryffindors their boasting, and the Hufflepuffs their…cooing.
The problem was, what to do?
“But Dragon, you wouldn’t even be able to cast a Lumos! Possibly for months!” she protested.
The idea of combining effects without losing potency was…worth further study. Draco resolved to commission another research project on that subject as well.
“I…I guess it wouldn’t be fair to take him to classes. But I don’t think I could be away from him for very long.”
“Shhh, dude, it’s not this place. It’s just a curse to be different. Nobody gets you. They just don’t.”
Tom couldn’t argue with that. He walked to the threshold where Harry and Draco stood waiting for him. He looked up at the two wizards, shyly.
“Who’s Voldem-”
“Chemistry?”
He paused, feeling eyes on him, and looked up.
Draco kissed him then, harshly, his teeth clashing against Potter’s pretty lips and drawing blood.
Draco congratulated himself once again for recognizing, in a stroke of brilliance, that the rarely-invoked wizarding traditions of adult courtship wouldn’t be sufficient – Potter would be expecting the Muggle rituals.
“I added additional glumbumble, and used less sopohorus.” Draco said truthfully.
Draco made a show of wiping his face with a handkerchief.
He raised his wand in salute, an eyebrow raised questioningly. Harry waved his hand agreeably. Draco felt a tingle of magic.
most certainly would be weird. The most powerful wizard since Merlin must be indulged his eccentricities, of course, but this odd taste for the flesh of family members was a bit hard to deal with.
“The Dark Lord is an immensely powerful wizard, and has been known to detect the use of his name in places of magical power.
“Yeah.”
“I will,” Harry said, in a voice that said his eyes were rolling underneath those lids.
.” Draco corrected him, rising from his seat. “I think I’ve given you enough information to allow that, if you’re clever enough to extrapolate.”
The mediwitch cast another charm and the yellow glow merged into his stomach and separated before his eyes, the color flickering until they solidified. Two spots of blue glowed inside his flat stomach.
“Now what do you see?”
Draco stared at the box suspiciously.
His long self-imposed isolation in his chambers made it clear he had judged himself an unworthy stain on the family tree.
“~~Guys, I have to make sure it’s safe for reptiles, okay?~~”
The many bits of acid were escaping their shards and exploding on contact with whatever they happened to touch.
Draco knew otherwise.
“I’m sorry Jamie. I suppose I shouldn’t have tried to open negotiations right in front of you like that. It was indiscreet of me.”
“I. Yes…I suppose so. Just…stay around till everybody clears the room I suppose.” She finally answered, slowing her movements with the rolls of parchment.
“I trust there will be no further aspersions on my bloodline from within my own House?” he queried, noticing the flinches at his slight emphasis on the
The goblin frowned.
He leaned in to kiss him.
“Do you think that would help? Perhaps taking a few of Granger’s classes would teach you some new instincts.” Draco countered.
Then the traditional message in the hand of the current Lord of the Suitor Family, identifying the gift as a family heirloom and an offer of alliance between the families.
“Is someone there?”
“See? So it’s night-time, he can’t fry us!” Frederick said, standing resolutely to his feet. The others followed.
Dumbledore frowned.
“We were his friends. The people Sirius trusted. Blood doesn’t mean anything.” Granger put in.
Jamie stood aside from the door, sullenly.
Harry seemed to understand that, and went for his own discarded clothes, rubbing his arms with his hands to warm them.
Draco stared at him incredulously. Bellatrix had brought
“It is odd.” Dumbledore admitted. “But the Sorting Hat is quite reliable. Miss Black. Can you tell me why you’ve been sorted into Slytherin?”
Draco swallowed. How did he not think about that! Potter was the more powerful wizard, and his magic less refined. Royal blood, yes, but infused with the relatively untamed magic of his mother just the same. Of
Draco rolled his eyes. Gryffindors. About as secretive as a flight of dragons.
Harry smiled at him, an expression that lit up his face and made Draco feel suddenly lightheaded for a minute until his face seemed to sort of crumple.
Draco didn’t move.
, Potter! Bludgers don’t kill and you know it! Beaters are
A test.
“We’ll be our own family.” He whispered.
Potter summoned his wand and conjured a glass of water for him, complete with a crinkly-looking straw which he held tenderly to Draco’s mouth.
“Um…” Potter looked really confused now.
“Yes, well. I have my own plans to deal with it. I have a special mission for you, unique to your status as the Black house elf. This is very important, but you can’t tell anyone about it. Including these people.”
In smaller script, most of the Slytherins were listed, along with a long collection of random wizards and witches Draco didn’t know, obviously the ones who didn’t like Potter and made it known to him, but didn’t much matter.
demonstrate familial love for outsiders.”
“I have compensated for his feelings in the ritual.”
“How are things on your end, love?”
“A-And then what?” A smaller boy asked him tremblingly, as if he already knew the answer but feared to hear it anyway.
“Oh! Cloud I apologize, I hadn’t intended to monopolize your new friend.” Mr. Zabini agreed, placing a hand on Cloud’s shoulder. “Do well and make me even prouder, son. I’ll be looking forward to break.”
Draco leaned forward and grasped Potter’s hair in his hand, pulling it back from his bloody forehead, squeezing it in his fist and jerking Potter’s face towards him, away from the wands on the grass, face to face, inches apart.
That caught Draco’s attention, and he found himself gazing at the giggling Hufflepuffs speculatively. Perhaps their orgies
“Well, I really hate to say it but when we were staking out the Potions room the other night I suddenly noticed Potter is bloody gorgeous.” Draco said reluctantly. “And, he’s cleverer than I thought. And he’s…well…”
As the two met there, Tom bowed to Lucius, receiving a similar bow in return.
“Occulmency will help, as well. Now, spend a moment clearing your mind, and then look me in the eye. I’ll be trying to jump into your mind the way Professor Snape did…only a bit less forcefully.”
~Remus Lupin~
in public, Potter! All the teachers have noticed, didn’t you know? It’s only a matter of time before the rumors start. Potter,
“I told you, my twin brother is Regulus.”
“Oh, don’t I know it. You’ve wanted him for years but I never thought you would actually…oh Merlin, this is
“…of gambling…”
Lysander shushed him, looking around a little at the attention his outburst had gotten. When their housemates returned to their conversations, he spoke in a lowered voice.
“Just the inheritance won’t be enough to make up for it.” Draco informed him.
Potter was openly sobbing now, refusing to look at Draco.
“Cool, thought so. So yeah, Australia, Antarctica, about eight different parts of Africa – watch out for the snakes in that place, they’ll give you some crazy times but so not worth the backlash, man. Oh, and we even popped up to that Muggle moon colony, duuude the Aurors were so pissed off about that, apparently everything up there is closed circuit television and they had to do so many obliviations and bring in squib experts to hack the computers, it wasn’t pretty.”
Draco sighed.
And then Harry was gone from under his hand, the great doors opening and closing behind him as he moved away into Hogwarts.
one. Not even your grandfather Lucius. Actually, especially him.”
Jonas stood at the bathroom door.
“Be thankful I’m not calling you Ferret.” Ron grunted.
“Reducto! Muffliato!”
Lucius felt a bit of discomfort as he realized that Granger was essentially unveiling the existence of magic to this large crowd of…well…many of them were Muggles. Although some fancy wording made it sound like anything but magic, she was pretty much spelling it out. He noticed some of the other wizards in the crowd were wincing a bit as well. He was starting to feel a bit…exposed.
Severus consulted a Tempus, “Almost exactly two hours ago, now.”
me to a…a…a
Draco just smirked.
! Now, no protests this time, I won’t have you wasting away after an ordeal like that. Magical displays like that take a lot out of you, young man. You’re coming straight to my kitchen to eat a proper meal.” She scolded him, somehow grabbing Ron’s ear instead of Draco’s to make her point.
“I’m telling you Ron, that’s despicable! How could you even contemplate something like that? It’s almost like a bond of slavery!”
The Slytherins watching snickered maliciously.
“She’s going to try to ‘fatten me up’.” Draco said sourly.

“I assume you’ll want certain assurances, sir. An Unbreakable Vow will be sufficient, I think.” Draco said.
Draco turned from the crib and cast a quick Alohomora at the door, finding not only his adopted son there, but a fresh-faced Cloud Zabini as well, curls glowing golden in the torchlight.
the Dark Lord!” Draco scolded his godfather, an edge to his voice.
“There’s a difference between being brave, and being stupid, Potter”
Lucius grinned in anticipation.
They were in the wrong place.

“Potter.”
“Yeah, Malfoy?”
It’s anger purged, the Howler continued on blythly in a more conversational tone, which was nevertheless amplified to epic proportions by the same spell, making Molly Weasley sound like a terrifyingly cordial monster talking to its prey before devouring it alive.
…A tentative footstep…
“Oh on the contrary, I think it was the most fortunate thing you’ve ever done.” Draco said.
Tom looked at him carefully. He was well muscled and his hand was well-positioned to draw his wand at a moment’s notice.
a Dark artifact. I’m not
Finally, with a small nod, the boy made his way over to the hulking vehicle.
“Oh, there are terrors aplenty. Less so, now. Our society is in a state of flourishing after the resolution of a decades-long civil war that got… very dark.”
“Very little is not possible, as it turns out.” Dumbledore said, twinkling.
“It’ll take an Unforgivable, Potter. Are you condoning Dark Magic?”
He promptly pulled it to his mouth and sunk his singular tooth into it.
“Did you know his father was a muggle?”
to go around saying his name!” Draco hissed.
“Look Dra-, Malfoy. I thought we had agreed it was too dangerous.”
Jamie looked down at her hands, blushing cutely.
spray wine all over the brilliant white tablecloth.
The grumbling from the Gryffindor table was getting louder as the new first year joined her friends at the Slytherin table. That was the third Slytherin in a row.
“You lead the way, Potter.” Draco whispered at the back of his neck…this time allowing his lips to graze against the skin, enjoying how that made the powerful wizard in his arms shiver with desire. A strange static energy was surging up Draco’s arms from where his hands contacted Potter’s hips…a powerful
Regulus just stared.
“Well, he won’t be able to keep his hands off me, of course. And we will sense and feed from each other’s emotions. Also, our souls will be irreversibly connected, as is usual for a soul bond. Only, instead of either of us following the other in death our souls would merge into the remaining body. We will have the ability to share power and knowledge.”
Only to leap backwards in alarm as Draco launched himself at the beast, managing to snag a handful of fur and dragging the animal backwards.
“What? Why not? They should be!”
He shrugged. They’d get over it. They’d have to. Harry’s hand was still tightly holding his own, giving him a brief squeeze now and then, despite seeming to give his friends his full attention.
Then the personal enemies:
“No idea, does it matter?”
“What?”
Harry pulled back, and pinched Draco on his waist as punishment for the first stolen kiss.
Harry sighed and motioned to Draco, who told the boy the tale of the man another Tom Riddle had become, the Horcruxes, the night Harry’s parents had died, the destruction of the Horcruxes and their battlefield marriage.
Rose petals led the eye to the massive face of the single red rose that opened towards them...

“You love
“Hmmm. So it operates upon the will through emotions. That’s quite typical since the connection is powered by Love magic. I think you may be able to extend your range of freedom, and the time you can be away, through Occlumency. I can teach you a few exercises to get you started.” Draco said.
“I’ll take care of you, Harry. I can’t change fate, and I’m no Gryffindor hero, but I’m good at plotting and manipulating and pulling strings, and I’ll do that for you, Harry. You’ll see. All that I do will be for you, so we can be together.”
“Lucius. I can see the burden you’re carrying. And, as confessions go, that’s a pretty heavy one. If you’ve wronged people, I can’t offer you forgiveness, it isn’t my place. But, beyond the question of forgiveness, who I see before me
wee babies he’s gonna need some toughening up!”
(See the end of the chapter for
Harry groaned and staggered to his feet, pulling Draco up beside him.
Draco sniffed.
Draco moaned.
“Is this how you dreamed of it?”
“But Draco, what if they are?”
“Wait…what are you-”
The boy whirled back to face him, dark eyes blazing, the wand magically reappearing in the hand that wasn’t busy caressing the baby’s soft white hair.
“Of course I have.”
Moments later a freshly-sorted Cloud sat himself gracefully on the bench beside Tom amidst polite applause, and the two boys shared a small grin between them as the Welcome Feast began.

“Better than some.”

“What issss thisss you speak of?”
“That was a
keep your hands off each other long enough to help me keep Ron from killing himself?” Granger cut in, her voice scornful.
Harry put a hand on his shoulder.
Draco’s frown was interrupted by Jamie grabbing a random box under the tree, reading the label, and shoving it triumphantly into Draco’s hands.
Snape paused, considering the possibility that Lucius Malfoy knew of his duplicity.
Harry stiffened.
In his mind’s eye he saw Albus Dumbledore sitting…on the floor? Yes, in his office, with his knees up to his chest. “I think it’s unwise for you to linger over these dreams, Harry.” The man put his wand to his temple and pulled out a silvery strand of memory, depositing it in a pensieve. “I think it’s best that you simply cast them away.” Draco saw Harry then, as Dumbledore saw him. Poor boy, he’s had no childhood at all. Will this be the year that he dies? No, better not to think that way. If Harry dies, we are truly doomed.
“Malfoy has survived many centuries of wizarding politics, wizarding intrigue, wizarding wars. This foolish rule you’ve invented for yourself, that everyone who you love will die because of you, holds a grain of truth. The Malfoy’s have a more accurate version. ‘Attachment breeds dependency, dependency spawns vulnerability, and the unguarded vulnerability will be the first target of your enemies.’”
Draco cocked his head. Placitum Perago was considered the less extreme type of magical contract. Instead of killing the one who broke his promise, it mainly just caused the original terms of the agreement to occur magically, at the breaching party’s expense. In this case, the timing of the promise could be important, however.
“Great! Okay, so reworking all the math…ugh….I guess the experiment object should be nickel.”
Voldemort looked at him suspiciously.
Regulus paused, the hand still comfortably in his, and looked to either side of Lysander for another half.
for a while, first.”
“Yes. He…you should know that in the past, he was Voldemort’s second-in-command. I suggest you be extremely wary of him. I…do not know how he would reactu to this bit of knowledge.”
“No, you will NOT!” a third voice interjected sternly.
“Maybe.” He said slowly. “We would have to get rid of Rose, though. I’ll talk to James about it.”
you to unhand my son. Immediately.” A silky voice said from behind the angry man.
“But I still won!”
“We’re his parents.” Harry said simply.
He didn’t mind admitting it. Brooding was a very Slytherin trait, going hand-in-hand with such stereotypically Slytherin things as devious schemes for personal gain, diabolical plots of dark revenge, and sudden unexplainable bouts of cruel, evil laughter.
“Give this to Potter for me. In private.” He told her, placing the talisman in her hand and closing her fingers over it.
“Good. I want you to see this perfectly the first time!” Draco said, and pulled Harry forward just a few more steps until they were standing just before the intricately carved crystal.
She turned to Tom.
. I’ve never hurt anybody!” Tom said insistently.
“The old man is very powerful, if he cannot be subdued in time...”
The spirit took even longer to answer this time.
“But it has the advantage of using unpurified elements, since any element that isn’t part of the base-six-plus-two framework won’t be reactive.”
“And I suppose you aren’t protective when it comes to
“Sorry.” Draco growled into his neck, and took a swipe at it with his tongue.
They were all also quite undignified.
“Pansy, I told you none of the pet names. Zabini, Goyle, Crabbe, good morning.” Draco nodded to his Slytherins and they instantly gave him their full attention.
“You’re invulnerable to most curses. But if you get hit my magic gets weakened. Keep that in mind, please.” Draco reminded him.
“It is my study now, father. You are a convict, and therefore unable to act as Lord under the law. I had a time convincing the Manor that you are not, in fact, deceased.”
Potter’s arms were folded.
“What? Whatever for?” Draco asked, bewildered.
“The Finite? Or the sex?”
“How…interesting. Well, it
“Options?”
Draco sighed “That’s why I wanted him there. My father is a proud man, and he’s taken recent revelations pretty hard. The other day he was talking in a way that made me very concerned. How is he managing with all those muggles?”
“Luciusssss! Ssspeak! What isss this theory your sssspawn tellssss me?”
“And are you trying to turn me Dark?”
Kreacher produced it from suspiciously deep beneath his ratty old towel, eagerly offering it up to Draco.
The Great Hall was, as usual, intolerably noisy. The Ravenclaws that weren’t reading were having spirited debates, some individuals carrying on complex conversations with two or three adversaries, and managing to eat as well. The Gryffindors seemed torn between raucous laughter, loud bragging, and outrageous expostulating on the great battle against the Forces of Evil. And the Hufflepuffs…Draco turned his eyes away from that particular table, feeling his face go pale. Today the Hufflepuffs were all…cooing at each other. Like a gigantic orgy, only without the sex.
Draco grabbed the wizard’s scroll and spread it out on the table. Several clips helpfully extended themselves from the tabletop and held the edges in place. Draco just stared.
“Quick, get it away from him!”
“Guys!”
“That…smell! You’re wearing something potent, I’m about to fall over from it!”
Draco just nodded and flicked his wand to levitate a trunk.
“If you boys could hold off your conversation until later, we still have a few things to discuss. Most importantly, whether Tommy should go to Hogwarts.” He cut in.
“Kreacher.”
Harry nodded.
“What is it?” Jonas breathed, running a finger down its length.
Potter paused, looking at Draco’s face uncertainly.
think Potter was ‘pretty’.”
“Potty likes kitty, hey? Maybe you should trade notes with that old squib caretaker, huh? I bet old Filch knows some tricks that make Mrs. Norris yowl like a werecat!” he continued.
Draco considered the boy before him. He wasn’t going to get much enjoyment torturing Potter as this pathetic figure. Someone had been beating on Potter, and it hadn’t been him, and for some reason that pissed the Lord Malfoy off.
The old lady chuckled.
“For whom?”
One more hallway and they stopped in an alcove with a nice view of the door to the Potions laboratory.
Draco thought about it. Best not to anger the Dark Lord at this point.
The twins were very nearly identical. Both an even mixture of both their fathers’ features, except that James had his grandmother’s startling green eyes while Regulus’ eyes were the same grey as her own. No doubt, a difference made by the two ancient lines each claiming a twin as its scion.
“Or…at least…it isn’t as one-sided as we’ve always thought.” Draco suggested.
The Malfoy line had never been exposed to young magic with less than three intervening generations of cultivation. Theirs was some of the most delicate, intricate generational magic that existed, excluding perhaps the Eouvalons of the Light side.
“There is no bluff. Potter would never refuse that choice.”
The group immediately looked to Draco, who was deep in thought.
“We…accidentally…overheard sssssome detailsssss while we were sssssleeping amongssssst the booksssss.” The Dreamer admitted.
Draco shrugged and rolled up the parchment.
The goblin looked positively scandalized.
“What kinda research?”
“Harry…hi…” Draco said dazedly, gazing up into his eyes.
“Hello Bill.”
“Thissss wizard had many headssss, each had to be destroyed to ssssstop him.” The Planner said.
offspring to draw on his parent’s magic, but holds the average of his older brother’s magical potential – far above
Draco smirked one last time, sitting himself carefully on the edge of the table before casting the last spell that comprised the trap.
But perhaps it was not until Draco had told him the prophecy? But if Harry had heard the altered prophecy, he wouldn’t be looking at Draco with wounded betrayal in his eyes…so it was either after the prophecy, or just before it.
Draco looked closer. What was the difference between the real Potter and what Potter thought of himself?
hand. The reason the ritual’s illegal is because it’s more common to force others to donate the parts.” He chuckled.
“Thanks for reminding. I had better get to it.”
“But Freddie he’s a
, and to
A few minutes later, a breathless Frankie Longbottom joined him at the Gryffindor table to somewhat more muted greetings.
“You cannot be serious.”
Draco lost hold of his broom, and tucked himself into a ball just before slamming into the pitch, tumbling over a ground that felt like a stone staircase.
! I know that now, you and the muggleborns you’ve allied with have proven that and proven that and I cannot read a single new magical text anymore without having my nose rubbed in my own foolishness. But those are
Draco tried not to visualize the decrepit old house-elf copulating with a statue.
“You’re turning all my friends against me, aren’t you?”
“I did too.”
“Very well. We have some questions for the young
Potter was quickly on his knees before Draco, cupping his face in his hands and examining him anxiously.

“No need for you to worry. I’ve
Silver eyes. Malfoy-blonde hair. The Malfoy pointed chin. The Black cheekbones and lips.
The students gaped as Draco rose and gave a gracious wave to the students.
“Granger, honestly. Look at them.” Draco drawled, indicating the clearly guilty look on Finch-Fletchley’s face.
When they arrived at Dumbledore’s office Lucius moved off under a disillusionment charm as Draco interrogated Jamie, who’d been staking out the office entrance most of the day.
There was no escaping it.
“When did it change, exactly?” Hermione quizzed?
His dad smiled down at him.
“Of course!”
“What are these gifts, young Malfoy?”
Harry’s eyes lit up, childlike, behind those glasses, and Draco suppressed the urge to remove them and snog him properly. Instead he stood up, giving his boyfriend a hand up and pushing him onto the couch between Fred and George, sparing a stern glance for each of them.
“Adding potions and additional symbolic variables verges on madness. Why are you doing this?”
Tom scolded himself for his inappropriate Muggle slang. In wizarding culture the Inquisition was still the stuff of genuine nightmares.
“I’ve given you more information than anyone besides my own mother. Be satisfied with that, old man.” Draco hissed angrily.
“I still remember all the chatter about the ‘pretty green-eyed boy’ at Madame Malkins. Once we realized who you had met your father was of a mind to forbid you from associating with him…of course I changed his mind, I doubt that’s a battle he would have won at that age.”
“Blood traitor! Sectumsempra!” Bellatrix shrieked.
Dumbledore drew his wand and started casting at the door.
Everyone but Tom declined.
“Shit! I almost forgot.”
The twins were thus summarily ousted from the scene of the action.
, Malfoy? You think I’m just going to…just…just…
And he
“New students are sorted according to their character into one of four houses. In another life, you were Slytherin. So was I, by the way.”
HOWEVER, I’M SURE I
Well.
“No, never.” He whispered.
“Um…Reducto and Muffliato…I had to concentrate on blocking the dangerous one but that left me with buzzing in my ears that distracted me for the rest of the match.”
Harry looked on, shocked for a second at the uncharacteristic behavior, then smiled slowly, sending a conspiratorial glance at the children.
Ollivander winked.
“No. Farther still.”
Now there were just shrugs of commiseration from the Gryffindors, calm agreement from the Ravenclaws, blushes from the Hufflepuffs, and from the Slytherins…well…it was pretty pathetic to have to be reminded of something as basic and necessary to civilization as personal
Lucius looked up from his book. It was a rather dense volume on the muggle arithmancy, delving further into the theory that had so neatly unwound the interaction between his magic, what he had always thought of as a mysterious force, and the mundane world. It was not light reading.
“Oh that's right! You can’t hear them! Awesome!” James brightened immediately. He looked across at Edgar, who was still trembling, eyes fixed on the snake.
“I’m quite aware of your dealings with my godfather, thank you.”
“Are there really Muggles running all over the place like ants?”
Draco snatched up his robe and threw it on before moving to the head-bag and removing the glamour of blood from the outside of it. He brought it over to where Voldemort lay, wheezing for breath, his body blackened and burnt from the exposure to such powerful Love magic.
there are things I still can’t speak of. Not even to you. Not because I wouldn’t want to but because they aren’t my secrets to tell.”
“Uh…” Potter sounded like he’d already taken the Draught.
“Harry. What did you agree to?” Weasley asked Potter seriously.
“Harry doesn’t like publicity. He said they’d figure it out eventually. And Draco said we had no obligation to do the Prophet’s job for them, if they don’t know it’s because they’re too incompetent to keep track of Ministry records.”
?” Harry asked patiently.
“Ew, no. I mean the fighting. Father said he always supposed they must have one of those relationships where they hate each other so bad it turns backwards. Whatever that means.”
“Well, thank you Jamie. Are you wearing your portkey?”
“Do we have a deal?” Thomas purred, leaning intimidatingly into the personal space of one Orpheus Greengrass. The boy looked caught between humiliation and a terrifyingly hungry adoration directed towards him. He met Cloud’s eyes across the room and rolled his eyes. After playing politics and power games with the fifth, sixth, seventh years all evening, talking a normal eleven-year-old out of the bunk by the window was childishly easy.
The twins just smirked and nodded, delighted at the surprise effect as everyone gabbed excitedly at each other about their parents.
Draco considered.
Draco smirked as Cloud’s eyebrow rose at being presented to the infant first. To his credit, the boy played along, gracefully bowing low at the waist and doffing and imaginary hat while raising a finger for Scorpius to latch on to.
“I’d say so. As usual.”
“I could fall asleep like this.”
“Don’t touch it Harry! I bet it’s a portkey!” Weasley warned.
“Dreaming? No, I mean in a pillow fight!”
He was immediately dropped unceremoniously on the floor, where one of the twins sat on him while the other wrestled him, protesting angrily, into his new sweater.
“I guess it has its perks.” He mumbled.
Dumbledore sighed.
“The headmaster is…getting very old.” Draco said, soberly.
“He can’t choose you! He’s just a baby!” Regulus objected.
“One does.”
Damn.
“That’s why the Unbreakable Vow.” She said, chagrinned. “I understand, it’d make it pretty obvious who was courting Potter.”
parents were wizards.
The boy’s eyes widened at being addressed by name, and in the language of snakes, his mouth opening and closing in momentary confusion.
~Albus Dumbledore~
Snape raised a thoughtful eyebrow at him.
“Vendolius Indutiae Exigo” Mr. Weasley echoed.
! Right there!” James sputtered.
“What did he do?”
“Come on, Potter. I’ve healed you and cleaned you up, fixed your…clothes, if you must call them that. I’ve got you completely in my power for the next few hours and I’m asking after your health. It’s only logical to be polite.” He explained in his most reasonable tone.
“Huh?”
“What? Surely the Dark Lord would have wanted information on the Boy-Who-Wouldn’t-Die. My father-“
Harry tucked his chin over his husbands shoulder.
Harry didn’t seem surprised.
Draco eyed the Headmaster.
“…with
“Oh! I recognize this phrase! It’s Heirloom, Magic, Blood! Harry, that’s the most prestigious wizarding courtship ritual in existence, it’s strictly for royalty!” Hermione gasped.
“Did your Mark just react to something too?”
Face smooth, expressionless.
Draco smirked. He’d been hoping for that. The
Potter in the center, of course.
“Merlin…what have I gotten myself into?”
you did.” Moody sneered, and with a quick word had slashed his sleeve from his robes…taking a bit of his skin with it. Draco gasped and cradled his bleeding arm. The Aurors had seen the unmarked skin, however.
“You wouldn’t last a week in the Death Eaters.” Snape sneered down at him.
“Yes, we’ll be a family Harry. You. Me. Our children.” Draco promised.
“I would like that. Jonas. It… I have made errors in the past, that have made me cautious, and… it will take some time for me, you understand. But, I would like that. As shocking as it is, I would like to be your friend.”
“I don’t see how even a Malfoy could possibly.” His great-aunt sniffed. “The Black name is dead. Still, I would see my home in the hands of those of the blood, at the least. Have you managed to cheat Potter of Grimmauld, then?” she asked eagerly.
Draco sighed.
“We just went through the mathematical proof. It is not only possible but a necessary result.” Lucius smirked.
“It will constrain you to ask questions only according to a certain form. This allows us to demand honesty from each other, but in a way that guarantees the protection of secrets that can only be divulged once married, or only to blood.”
“But…the Runespoor said…”
“Who’re these?” he asked, smiling.
And then the traditionally cryptic explanation for the selection of this particular heirloom as a gift for the child being courted.
“Things change, Mother.”
“You were just in the right place at the right time to help me help you save the world, my dear Gryffindor.”
Like lightning.
“Truly?” she breathed, shocked.
“That was my impression. But, it was still worrisome how disinterested he seemed in finding a solution to this.”
“Well, in first year-”
powerful wizard, it can be used to cure lycanthropy.”
“Draco?”
“Yeah. Too bad.” Potter said, rather sadly.
Unfortunately, a few less prestigious pureblood wizards of every generation had to be sacrificed to such a fate in order to channel that unfocused power into the long-term generational magic that was the foundation of the powerful collective wardings that kept the wizarding world protected.
“You’re not…surely you’re not
“I do.”
“In the Muggle world, people grow up, and then
“I need to use your device. To contact my son-in-law. I would like to send a…I believe the term is a fax.”
“Ok, here’s Frankie’s extra pillow. And Reggie, you can have mine of course! Ok, so the plan is to hide in one bed, and when they split up to get each of us at the same time, we all gang up on one of them!”
He would make it true.
to the Headmaster’s office?”
“Thank you. I’d like to suggest an amendment while this is still in committee.”
“Besides the taint of Felix Felices in their veins, you mean?” Draco smirked.
“Nothing but a lump of coal, I heard you talking back to old Mrs. Black out there!”
Draco grunted something and huffed at his husband to get off.
“Um…higher education for Muggles.”
“They won’t be quite
Draco was silent.

to win without one.”
The other boys crowded around. James hurriedly grabbed a few Exploding Snap cards from where Frankie had tossed them, and arranged them in a semi circle like their beds.
The Dark Mark.
“Remus knows things.”
“Well, it’s not like you should have just believed me. You’re the first outside my family to know I exist.”
“Nothing, Ron.”
“So every time we get put together, it’s because Snape is mad at
“Born to those who have thrice defied him.”
“What about this surprise for Harry?”
Mudbloods weren’t necessarily a bad thing. Just…dangerous. But then, most powerful, untamed things were.
“Sure if you don’t mind the inquisition.”
“Against Mudbloods and Blood-traitors, of course!”
Dumbledore arrived then, surveying the scene of the concluded ritual.
“But teachers can! And then we could use them!”
Draco chose to be generous.
to be followed to the letter, or there could be serious consequences.
Moody was mumbling something about faulty Veritaserum and Shacklebolt was just staring at Draco, shocked at the revelation.
Kreacher looked up at him, a crafty glint in his deranged eyes.
“Aww, you’re so cute in your new sweater!” Harry teased, leaning in to kiss him on the lips.
“What’s to become of me?”
“Who’s paying for all this, anyways?”
Once Jamie had left, Draco summoned another piece of parchment from his bag, along with a quill and ink.
“Hmm? Oh! The boy. Well, I suppose he’s about as normal as you or me, near as I can tell.” Dumbledore said. “Lemon drop, anyone?”
“Yes my boy. What else?”
“I do hope you still have it’s brother, Harry.”
“Good evening, Barrister Murdock, Barrister Seymour.” Draco greeted them, seating himself behind the forboding desk comfortably.
Potter looked even more confused.
“How long?”
“To that old windbag”
The laughter was suddenly audible, a horrible, sardonic, slightly bitter chuckle that made Draco cringe.
Draco pulled out his wand and followed Potters example.
Draco drew his own in answer.
had my way with you…I expect you’ll be willing to go through just about any…
“Tom can’t use spells with the wand that came with his soul, and the Dark Lord’s wand won’t recognize his magic. I tried to unite them with the Reflection spell but they acted like they weren’t the same wand.” Harry told the wandmaker.
“Till then, Malfoy.”
see, and that I am to do the same once I’m old enough to start.” He shuddered theatrically. “So I didn’t bring it up again. I hope he forgets.”
“It’s really quite enough. Please, don’t bother returning it, it was most certainly
Potter’s big green eyes widened in shock at the disturbing objects inside, and Draco leaned in to whisper to him.
“It was Tizzy and Dipsy, Master Malfoy!”
“What…I’m not like that. I wouldn’t…control people like that.”
what that legacy holds!”
“Wow! He looks really weird and awesome! Can I touch him?”
Weasley lunged and snatched the note out of Granger’s hand, his mouth opening and closing in shock as he read the fancy script.
“No need. The bond is irreversible. You’re old. After tonight there will be no real longterm threat to the House of Potter-Malfoy.” Draco sneered.
“So, in about ten hours, one-seventh of the scarab and alihotsy will start to meld. Which of course, will mean that the glumbumble will start to react to the dragons blood because it will no longer be dampened by the alihotsy. And of course, the magical energy of the dragonsblood will also no longer be expended on inverting the effects of a full one-seventh of the scarab, leaving us with a dragonsblood-glumbumble pressure system.” Draco explained.
Draco looked at his face, eyes scrunched shut and forehead crinkled with perplexed impatience.
Lucius stared. The man was a muggle. And he clearly had no idea that he was enrolled in a magical school. He allowed a small smirk to play on his lips.
The boy was interrupted by a cry from the infant behind him.
Draco stepped forward until he was standing between Potter’s splayed legs.
“So…we just decided…”
“A Half-Blood.”
Draco’s eyes narrowed in concern.
“Mr. Weasley is very busy at the moment-”
? Funding a muggle-based study?”
a welcome discovery.” The sneer was even uglier. Interesting.
“I don’t-”
“Of course, my boy. Of course.” Dumbledore reached for the little scroll just a touch eagerly. Draco decided he was right. Dumbledore prided himself on being all-knowing, and knowing Harry’s ritual gifts before Harry did was just the sort of gift that would tip the balance.
“~~Why scream? Snoring is so much more beautiful…~~”
“Have you tested your range yet?” he asked.
“Yeah. And you get me. Well, mostly. I’m different other ways too. But you get the twin thing at least, cuz you’re half, and you can get why it’s different to be different. And, dude, your Wrackspurts are almost gone!”
Mutters of surprise and consternation swept the group.
“Just imagine Snape’s office blowing up in the middle of the night, tonight, Potter.” Draco assured him. That actually seemed to help.
“We’ll just step into one of the rooms upstairs.”
Nodding to himself, Draco placed the vial securely in the rack at the back of his desk and unfurled the scroll.
Professor Snape stopped trying to unlock the door, his face going white, first with shock, then fury.
“This is what appears when you ask the Room for somewhere to hide things in. Apparently it’s been a popular request over the years.”
“He wasss unable to usssee it!” Voldemort reminded him.
Draco ran his fingers up Potter’s long, strong legs, then leaned forward to kiss him on the inside of his left thigh, just above the knee.
“Behind the bed curtains, so they won’t know we’re there. We’ll be in the foot of the bed, so they’ll only see the same lump in the covers that we’ve made to decoy them! And then we all jump on the one that goes for that bed while the others are beating up our empty beds!”
And in keeping with that determination, Potter showing up looking suddenly respectable brought on a topic Draco knew would have the advantage of putting the Gryffindor entirely off-balance, and at the same time serve as an obvious offer of peace.
“We’ll go around the other side.” Regulus suggested.
a choice, then.” Blaise spoke his own thoughts aloud.
Draco cuddled his husband close and kissed him on the cheek.
“And this peace may be an interlude in war.” Cloud quoted.
“No.”
~Draco Malfoy~
“If you’ll be my friend…I…I’ll show you my magic!” He promised into the darkness.
Draco groaned in frustration. His fiancé was completely oblivious to some of the more dangerous parts of magic that didn’t involve a quick A.K.
A pensieve suddenly appeared on a small pedestal between them.
“I intend to negotiate with him.”
“He is in the middle of a research school full of experimental magic. Some of that could resonate. We can certainly ask Hermione to look into anything going on that could cause this. And…we have a control to test that theory.”
What was the name of that creature who had appeared at the parent’s command?
And suddenly they were in the center of a crowd of Weasleys, all wanting a chance to hug and kiss and exclaim over the couple.
Potter leaned towards the nearer of the pair, admiringly petting its long curved neck.
Draco signed his name with a flourish, then placed the parchment in an envelope and sealed it with his ring. A quick charm insured anyone besides Potter who tried to break the seal would die painfully, then he handed it to Goyle.
“What does yellow mean?”
“What you said at Grimmauld reminded me…and…I should have held firm. I…I shouldn’t have given in to your Muggle romanticism.
“What? Breeding? No, you don’t get it, Malfoy. Muggles don’t
"Shacklebolt.
“You admire…Harry?” Granger asked incredulously.
“Well, one project at a time, dear Aunt. I’m currently seeing to the reunification of line-of-title to blood, next generation there will be a proper Black Heir.” Draco said.
“Las Vegas, baby!” Fred crowed.
Granger sighed.
“…in one of the more enjoyable wedding pranks…”
‘I suppose I do know how to push all his buttons. I most likely knew him better than those other two, even before I started building the scroll.’ Draco mused.
“I’m sorry?”
“The castle.” Draco murmered to Potter. “Younger students.”
“Severus, my boy. It appears to be locked, with quite a variety of Light and Dark spells…hmm…quite creative, actually. Whomever is inside clearly does not wish to be interrupted.” The old man said, stroking his beard wisely.
“Aside from those.”
“No, actually. I have a job for you.”
“So why don’t we go public now?”
“Draco if you’re saying what I think you’re saying…”
“Harry. I want you to swear an Unbreakable Oath to me that you will never use an Unforgiveable again.”
“Hey, Slytherin, is it true you can speak to snakes?”
“I would be happy to!”
Harry looked hopefully up at that.
“Nife pfunch, Malfoy.”
“Oh yes, my son was involved in developing that course, actually. I think you’ll find the name is quite a bit more appropriate than you expected.” Lucius smirked.
“Escribamens Iunctio.”
Tom frowned as he watched his adopted brothers suffer forced separation for the first time he had ever witnessed.
“What are you doing? I thought you were ready to fight!”
…with magic, is a small thing. Just a few spells and a trip to the joke shop in London. And reading through some really dreadful Muggle literature, let me tell you.”
Lucius was white with shock, now.
The quaint little cottage had been built on the apex of the small hill, overlooking a small valley with a charming little creek spanned by a cute footbridge.
“Will you pass this along to my father? Without mentioning Tom’s role, of course?”
Draco pulled out Granger and Ron’s wands, tossing to the ground at Potter’s feet.
valuable,” Jamie told him. Draco frowned. “To Potter, I mean. It probably would be to me if I ever knew he’d existed before this. I know I wouldn’t give up memories of David and Jane for anything.”
That was the easy part. Now the hard part.
have such an interest.”
“IMPOSTER! UPSTART! SCANDALOUS LITTLE PRYING BUSYBODY! INSIGNIFICANT, SIXTH-BORN PAUPER CHILD!” The pompous bellow reverberated throughout the hall as Weasley snatched his shocked hand away.
The portkey brought Draco to the gates of Hogwarts, and he entered the Great Hall just in time for breakfast.
Ron Weasley
“We- we aren’t taking him, we’re giving him Puff!” James said, his voice rising with indignation.
.” He said slowly.
Then he moved carefully sideways, stalking the naked boy he knew would be bathing in the middle of the spacious room.
Ron just shrugged.
“Egypt.”
A moment later he was standing before the Dark Lord.
“Now we have an active cell.”
On a more fun note, WWW products had been added to their trunks by Harry, then removed by Draco, then different products replaced there by Draco and removed by Harry to be replaced by still others which were surreptitiously removed by Draco…until eventually a negotiated settlement of assorted pranks had been ceremonially placed into the trunk by both parents and warded with alarms to prevent future tampering by either. Draco and Harry had then each (on separate occasions) quietly slipped other products into robe pockets with a quiet word not to tell the other. The three youngsters had, of course, agreed.
“Slytherin? Truly this is a surprise. Well, I trust you were not offended by my son’s skepticism?”
!” Pansy gasped in agreement.
“Why not?
Tom frowned.
Another attack, and Harry’s reply was an even more powerful borderline spell.
Draco sighed again. After twelve years of Muggle indoctrination, there was only so much he could do in the time he’d had.
Draco shifted away from the cursed mop that was trying to get into the action, its ropes curling seductively around his ankle and lower leg like tentacles.
The world was dimming…
“I’m her nearest living male relative,” Draco reminded him. “so you’ll be mostly dealing with her through me.”
he a wizard? He’d read about those subjects before but they were
“You’re planning something.”
In that case, there was only place to look. Which meant, finagling an invitation.
And now he sat curled up pathetically on the floor, his broken possessions scattered around him, debilitated by a pain he had never contemplated, never learned to resist, never dreamed of facing.
Potter’s hand moved to try and touch Draco’s hair. Draco quickly grabbed his other wrist to avoid the sacrilege.
Draco had timed his speech perfectly. As if on cue, the Head of House glided through the door, robes billowing awesomely behind him.
“Finite Incantatem!” Harry countered the magical cage with a flick of his wand.
Now to take a look at the latest addition to the scroll. Not that Potter’s half-blood lineage was any secret.
Damn Potter, he was far too clever behind that seemingly oblivious Gryffindor exterior. Draco reminded himself not to forget that his own godfather, surely the most masterful of spies, had been tutoring Potter in Occlumency.
Harry and Draco hurried into their bedroom, where shouting could be heard through the paneled door.
“If he behaves himself. And controls the other one.”
Moody retired to the doorway, muttering about constant vigilance and Malfoys.
Ten minutes later he found her, off by herself in a compartment full of Ravenclaws.
Draco raised an eyebrow.
curse-breakers will make short work of my warded locations?” Draco sneered.
! He could be counted on not to betray him, not to hurt him!
A shower of rice rained down on them as the townsfolk gathered to wish the charming young couple a happy honeymoon, and Fred and George snuck up on them and hoisted the two blushing grooms onto their shoulders, making them highly visible targets.
Harry seemed to have forgotten his own problems for a moment, and he and Hermoine…and the rest of the students in the Great Hall…were now staring at Ron with quite a bit of interest as the message went on…
Draco felt bereft of his touch.
“You will place this inside a container, and deliver the container with it till inside to my house elves at Malfoy Manor. They have instructions for its care and protection.”
“So you only let yourself care for someone until after you’ve married them.”
lay the traps that need to be laid, and
Now he had two reasons.
“Granger just arrived.” Draco informed his husband in an undertone.
Remus’ face changed suddenly.
“Who’s it from, mate?”
Jonas smiled back at him, weakly, but genuine.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t know it was you!”
“I do.”
“You know I would never endanger my son. Dumbledore, and Granger have been involved, and I don’t have to tell you that Harry and I are quite competent ourselves.”
“Draco. Would you…consider taking the spells off your hair tomorrow?”
Draco smiled and kissed the pouty lips.
“Because, my Lord. I see no indication that you intend to spawn another heir, and a heritage as powerful as yours calls for reinvestiture into the other pureblooded lines.”
Tom thought carefully.
“And Professor Dumbledore?”
“That’s…that’s
“But, the question is, what can we do about it? And, can we just assume it’s because of Tom the Marks are reacting? They didn’t when he manifested, after all. What’s changed?”
“Well I’m sure we can come up with a star that suits you. It’s important to stick to the naming conventions, my dear. The family magic could hesitate before recognizing you as Black, for example. Your blood runs true, dear, but names have magical significance and are easily ascertained.”
And then there was listed in much smaller print, just about every member of Gryffindor House, several Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs, and not one Slytherin.
every again!”
“The Dark Lord told me of your plans. Do you truly intend to bluff Potter into marriage with your life?”
“Can we sssssspeak to the Other now?” A second added.
Draco raised an eyebrow inquiringly, keeping his silence.
“Jamie. My name is Draco Malfoy. You should always give your last name when you introduce yourself. It’s very important to wizards where you came from. Do you know where you came from, Jamie?”
A Malfoy such as himself…a Light Malfoy.
“Oh. Of course. Well, Potter seems quite adaptable to this arranged marriage.”
Draco gave Potter one last smirk before he shrugged out of the robe, his own manhood hanging heavy and semi-erect in anticipation.
He bit his tongue, indecisive.
you shouldn’t be scaring people with it!”
“Finite. Accio wand!” Draco caught the wand and advanced on the boy, grabbing a handful of shirt and jerking him upwards while he was still horizontal. Potter was still horizontal as Draco pulled him face-to-face.
The girl hopped down from the stool and made a beeline for Draco.
“I’m not sure that’s a good idea, father. Cloud doesn’t have any younger siblings.”
Draco stared at the shirt, reaching out a hand to trace the ‘D’ when he felt it…that tingle of magic…that odd quirky Weasley magic, of course. But why would it be in the shirt? Perhaps it had some warming charms on it…Draco pulled out his wand and tapped it to his eyes with a spell to enable magical sight.
now, James. Outside.”
“So?”
why you’re always so happy to see me.”
“Time to say your vows, Potter.” Draco smirked.
Goyle moved to comply, and Draco composed the message in his head as he waited.
Potter was looking at Draco as if he’d forgotten he was there.
Though…if Draco was
“Yes. I’ve already approached Miss Granger about a research position after she graduates. His Blood-gift will please Dumbledore. And I’m considering the Crystal Sceptre as a suitable Heirloom.”
“Fine then. Fred. George.” Draco said, nodding to the appropriate twin in turn.
Malfoy!” Potter finally croaked.
“Okay?”
Then, a series of portraits popped up, like countless spots, replaying important memories…the moments that best defined the sources of Potter’s strength.
It was a credit to both lawyers how quickly they recovered from their personal shock.
used that information for my own gain, and it is now protected by Oath.” Draco assured him.
Draco pulled Potter inside the bathroom and positioned him facing a toilet before pulling out his wand. The opportunity was perfect for the last stage of the spell.
“Um…well…uh…” Potter stammered, “It
to our connection with you!” He snarled in his face, then released his hair.
“Not so much. We’re okay, we just don’t have much in common. He and Regulus stick together, I stick with Scorpius.”
“I can’t believe I let you talk me into that!” came the complaint.
“Well, if her father was one of the creators, then I’d say Jamie has at least an equal claim on it to yours.” Draco argued, hoping to at least learn more about the powerful artifact.
So the conquering hero was still a virgin at the pathetic age of 16. Perhaps useful information could be gleaned from this first stage of the spell after all.
Draco sighed.
- - - - -
“What? Enemies?”
those rituals were. Muggles were hopelessly casual and unregimented about things, they had none of the careful dances that magic ingrained into wizardfolk because the consequences of each gesture had no automatic magical result.
, wasn’t it?
“I don’t think it will be long.” Draco grimaced.
Potter sighed again, clearly enjoying the subtle aqueous massage he was receiving, and Draco suddenly felt the heat in the room multiply tenfold, a burning sensation coming to him through his wand, up his arm, and into what he knew was his magical core.
“What need?
“I’m not an evil wizard. I’m
“Really.”
Draco thumped his husband on the back of the head.
Draco just looked at the twins inquisitively.
Draco smirked and cast a quick tempus. Five minutes to midnight.
“What’s your name?” James locked eyes with the boy.
“Maybe that was a mistake,
“You had to go and tell them! You ruin all my stories, Hissyfit!” James pouted.
“And these out to the sides must be special abilities?” Draco mused, concentrating on a drawing of an eye off to the left. Ah. Dumbledore could see invisible things. How typical. And…there…he’s a Legilmens. And an Occlumens.
“I won’t hurt you, if you’ll be my friend, I’ll help you.” He shouted into the wind, edging closer to the pillar.
“A female Lord?” Draco actually laughed out loud.
“And will this- AH!”
“Uh, Malfoy. Can you predict the time it’ll go off?” Potter’s voice stopped him.
Voldemort hissed.
“Matrimonius et Animus”
“I have an idea for this time. But, they are older and bigger, and they have very long, hairy arms. This is going to be a war, and I’m good at making plans but we need my brother Regulus to help make them better. That’s how we work. So, if I save you all tonight, you have to help me get to Regulus after.  He’s with the Gryffindors. Deal?”
“It should be hers rightfully.” Potter said.
“And for once you are quite incorrect, Solicitor Murdoch. I in fact wish to dissolve the contract formed by my father, and also seek your help in drafting and negotiating a new contract with another party.” Draco corrected him.
“Potter. We may have a problem.”
Draco leaned back again, relaxed.
“You’re so much more than normal, Harry.”
, Tom Riddle.” The Critic added.
Harry flushed guiltily and turned towards her.
“It’s not funny, James! You
Draco sighed as he looked down at the two lists he’d been making.
“I…I was supposed to, before I…well…before it was all erased. I’d just gotten onto Platform Nine and Three Quarters when everything went wonky!”
At least he didn’t speak with his mouth full like Ron.
“There is a lot that has been concealed from your scientific community. Granger and my son think it’s time to reveal ourselves, and apparently they’ve managed to persuade the right people.”
In his rooms, Draco took a deep breath and slid the scroll carefully open.
“Well then. You’ve volunteered to donate the memories without compensation. I suppose it’s only appropriate, since you’re responsible for her inability to meet the man for herself. In that case, I suppose negotiation isn’t necessary. As Jamie’s guardian I’ll provide the Pensieve. I’ll warrant Granger can assist you with the necessary transfer spells. Once the Pensieve is full you can deliver it to me and I’ll handle things from there.” Draco suggested.
sticking out every which way!
The Dark Lord frowned.
The two sides of the scroll were, Draco supposed, like the Mirror of Erised and it’s evil twin.
Draco smirked at the prudish Gryffindor and pulled him by the hand to the edge of the crystal basin. Two drying charms, and they were dressing themselves, Harry doing so at a frantic pace.
Draco veered off to avoid another collision, leaning close to his broom to increase the speed. He had to put some distance between them or Potter was going to land them both in St. Mungos for a week.
Draco found that his own hands had been busy with Harry’s robe, and they were both somehow naked, Harry poised to enter him, the blunt end of his manhood pressing impatiently at his opening and the dribbling liquid burning like fire where it dripped on his thigh.
“What about focused wandless magic?” Draco pressed.
Harry scowled at the jibe, then chuckled as he stood to embrace his husband.
. That settled it. If being the heir of the Dark Lord, and through him of Slytherin, and through James Potter, of Gryffindor, hadn’t been enough, the Boy-Who-Lived had…well…“lived”. Bounced the Killing Curse off his forehead. With accidental magic. Killed the most powerful dark wizard of the age
“But it still works?”
“It’s good that he laughs now, and with those close to him. There’s no dignity in needless solemnity.”
Draco jerked his hands back from the scroll. Not something he was ready to deal with. Fine then. Albus Dumbledore.
Draco could still feel Potter’s magic in his core. That part of him no longer felt like a perfectly chiseled bedrock of ice, but like rich soup of acidic power, with sharp spikes sticking out in precisely geometric patterns.
“Did you think my father would let me get away without a repertoire of handy quotes to impress adults with?” Cloud smirked.
“Draco?” Came a tired voice from the doorway.
“The Seeker is the key to the game. But his friends are the key to that particular Seeker.” Draco explained.
“The magical community. Wizards. Witches. Magical creatures. I’ve lived my entire life in terror of what is happening here today. Of what happens after. The fear. The jealousy. The human experiments. The stake. I hope to Merlin my son is right and your people are ready for this.”
A long silence followed, into which came the sound of a door banging outside in the hallway.
A hand appeared from nowhere and grabbed his wrist, a thin shimmering layer of silk-like material was thrown over him and suddenly there was Potter, eyes glinting with excitement, less than a foot from Draco’s face.
“And well you shouldn’t. One Gryffindor in the Black line is more than enough for the next few centuries.” He smirked. Then saw Jamie’s matching smirk aimed back up at him and grinned widely.
“Took you long enough. Let’s go.”
“You’re right! That would be ever so fascinating! Muggles used to mix raw
“Nothing. Keep going, we’re almost there.”
“Potter, I
“What would you have me do? Go take classes at your Mudblood Institute?”
Harry pouted.
“I’m fine Ron.” Harry said, the moment broken, and he reverently placed the plant on the ground as he reached for the remaining contents of the package.
At the very least, the tactical landscape was starting to look much more favorable to the Light than it ever had. Draco frowned. Thanks to his father, and for that matter, the last several Malfoys, the family was pretty firmly entrenched as Dark. What if that turned out to be the wrong side?
Draco made his decision.
“It’s real!” she exclaimed, eyes shining.
“Imprisonment.” Draco snapped.
Draco nodded. So Harry could add Sight to his list of talents. It wasn’t a typical Slytherin or Gryffindor trait, which meant Lily Potter must have had some new strain.
Potter stood up, outrage all over his face.
“Merlin. You mean Harry Potter!” Murdoch exclaimed.
Draco thought about that for a moment as he finished perfecting his hair.
“To some extent. Those last few seconds were something similar to a bonding. But it was off-center because we were separated and it was in only one-direction.
…repeatedly…and cooing to each other in low urgent voices about beautiful glistening white swans, and roses, and mysterious gifts from the ancient past, and a secret admirer, and oh, isn’t Harry so
“What did the boy do?”
Clearly Albus Dumbledore was a child at heart.
“We’re his brothers, of course he’ll know us!”
Potter looked up at him, completely shocked.
“Black, Jamina!”
“Draco…I guess this is what you do in the wizarding world. But I was raised by Muggles too.” Jamie reminded him quietly.
“Of course! Do you not spy on your parents, whenever you can get away with it?”
Draco placed the tip of his wand at her temple and neatly pulled the silvery strand from her, depositing it in the bowl.
“It’s under Fidelius.”
Then he stepped a little towards Tom and offered him a formal bow.
Feeling suddenly sick with dread, Lucius quickly excused himself and strode quickly into a restroom.
Lucius smiled at the man. He didn’t know how a muggle had gotten into a magical school, his son and Granger must be playing fast-and-loose with the Statute of Secrecy, but he knew he wanted to be there when Jonas found out the truth.
“Very nicely done, my boy.” Dumbledore cheered. “Now what did you learn from that?”
Cloud gave him a reproachful look.
the name of the ancestral house of Black, but couldn’t quite recall it. He didn’t think he’d been Obliviated recently. Which left one explanation.
This section of the scroll was wholly unlike Dumbledores.
“That would be useful. Would you teach me, sir?” the boy asked politely.
“Can you?” he asked.
Draco smirked at his incapacitated adversary as he slipped his wand into his hand under his sleeve.
“‘For my family I dedicate all my spirit, my magic, my seed. The family before all.’ It is a promise young boys of certain families make daily to their fathers.” He explained, a fervent light in his eyes for a moment.
“In English?”
Draco shook his head.
Draco laughed.
“Draco…I…”
“He didn’t get very far this morning.”
“My father was at the Dark Lord’s right hand. My grandfather before him. They took excellent notes.”
Lysander didn’t seem to mind that Regulus was still holding his, or her, hand – but grimaced at the question, folding to sit Indian style at Regulus’ feet as if it was the most natural thing in the world, and continued chattering in that bizarre style.
Potter would probably be the most powerful wizard since Merlin.
to almost kill the other team, it keeps them on their toes!”
“Base seven with no addition. Okay, and then we can use an iron basin for electric current transfer. The formula is going to require californium, though.”
The grand entry hall of Malfoy Manor shuddered as two eleven-year-olds burst through the double doors that led to the library – where they were
“…and don’t forget lots and lots of hot, HOT, sex…”
Harry did, holding his breath as his husbands fingers slowly peeled away…
Lucius put on the heavy gloves and poured.
“But…you say I am him?”
Harry lifted Draco’s closed fist to his face and kissed it, tears dripping down onto Draco’s fingers.
to tell her all about Sirius. Merlin knows what
“Yes. On Beltaine, as is appropriate.”
Dumbledore considered this.
Ron started choking in the background at that.
Draco made sure the door was sealed, and cast a quick Muffliato just to be sure.
Draco smiled grimly.
There remained only one option. He would have to interrogate an actual Muggle.
“Draco! Why didn’t you say something?”
“Transanguis.”
“Draco? I hear water…”
“Don’t bother. It’s insulting.” Draco warned him.
“About a very powerful magical art-a-fact.” Regulus added.
The Malfoys could be destroyed. After the debacle in the Department of Mysteries, Lucius was fully confirmed as a Death Eater, no Imperious defense this time, and an angry populace was crying out for the rest of the Malfoy blood. Or more specifically, the Malfoy gold.
roll his eyes.
“Malfoy! I told you he suggested I should marry Jamie! She’s a first-year for heavens sake!”
“What do you mean, Fred and George?”
“I’ll do it.”
“I missed you! I thought you would miss me too!”
Tom grinned at him.
“It’s not there.”
“Well I still choose Reggie anyways.” James huffed, turning away with annoyance.
“He is hungry. Bring a bottle of milk immediately.” Tom demanded.
“Do you think I want
“Mind telling me what’s going on?”
“I will try to help you, but it will be costly. What were the terms, please?”
“~~We should bite it and silence it.~~”
Cloud looked disappointed.
“But maybe too much of it-”
“The ferret? Why the hell would he come!” Weasley burst out. Always dependable to demonstrate the Gryffindor temperament, those Weasleys.
And Severus! How could he be an ally
just like
“Why would you think such a thing?”
“My lab! They’re destroying my laboratory!” he sounded rather panicked, before resuming his assault on the door, the sounds of small explosions continuing on the other side of the door.
“Hello?”
“What-“
James’ head rose at that.
Withdrawing his hands from Harry’s, he clapped them, summoning the main course.
Harry stroked the surface of the liquid with his wand – tap, tap, tap. He turned to look at the boys.
“When does he ever need to punish me? He hates my guts!” Potter hissed.
The baby burbled up at him. It had a shock of bright blonde hair on its head.
“What did you hex him with?” Ron demanded angrily.
“Well, I’d say we should put to use what we have…the perfect spy.” Draco said, turning to his cousin. “Jamie. You’ve gotten close with those three lately, now that they’ve accepted you as one of their Marauders. Do you think you could get the information out of them?”
“It’s something for lifting burdens, I think. I can’t imagine how!”
“Oh, but with great deference to the Lord Malfoy, this is simply not true! Gringotts employ the very best experts with wards and curses in the world! Private resources available for a price may seem impressive, but I beg the Lord Malfoy not to be taken in by those…those tricksters with their…their…
Potions laboratory, which is due to occur in just a few minutes?!?” Draco hissed.
Draco rolled his eyes and tugged on Potter’s wrists to get his attention.
